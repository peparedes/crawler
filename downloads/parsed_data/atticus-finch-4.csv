I'd love to drown you in a sea of your own blood 
kisses to me and watch you choke on it 
how many songs do you wish to be written about you? 
this isn't the first and it wont be the last baby 
how well you fake a smile and some tears to match 
you wanted everything and more 
everything is ruined 
when i have you again 
your're mouth gets sewn up forever 
i'll never let you go 
Mrs. hardcore fashion show 
kiss your drama queen days good-bye 
those days are so long gone and this day so are you 
this is the last night your neck is not serrated 
this charade is getting older than suicide attempts 
say you love me 
say you love me and write it in your blood 
and you know what 
say it again 
se how fast your chest collapses 
we are all the lucky ones 
and i'll decorate myself with your insides 
and i can wear your face as a mask 
dont cry 
you just got what you wanted 
how cool you look now 
how much better would you look with your heart lodged 
inside the brand new cut in your throat 
your body is as blue as your hair 


OMFG this song is like my feelings on paper, to like the last dot on the last and and the last cross on the last t man OMG"

""Rum Is For Drinking, Not For Burning""

This captain goes down with the ship
All hands on deck stand hip to hip
I shout the orders shoot to kill.
I'm dressed to thrill,
I'm dressed to thrill.

And all my enemies,
I want their eyes to see,
Their captain walk the captain walk the plank
Destroy them, rank by rank.

Sail with me into the setting sun
The battle has been won, but war has just begun
And as we float, emotion starts to die,
We need to find a way, just to keep our desires alive.

Now set the sail to quater mast,
We'll jump the ship, we'll sink 'em fast. 
Men follow me to victory,
Red as the sun,
Red as the sun.

And to the cannons roar,
Their bodies dance ashore,
A pirates life for me,
I won't go quietly.

Sail with me into the setting sun
The battle has been won, but war has just begun
And as we float, emotion starts to die,
We need to find a way, just to keep our desires alive.

And to my damsel in distress,
You've made a mess of your new dress [x2]

Sail with me into the setting sun
The battle has been won, but war has just begun
And as we float, emotion starts to die,
We need to find a way, just to keep our desires alive.

Leave, Die, Live, Cry, Bleed

So i scream out at the night sky. Scream good riddance to my friends, my family, all my loved ones. The one who gave me birth, is now the one who kills me inside. Knives through my heart like an abortion 16 years to late.

There is no use fighting it. David versus Goliuth was a petty argument compared to the war i wage with my own flesh and blood. Blood is thicker than water. All that means is the gash must be made twice as deep.

So i scream out at the night sky. Scream good riddance to my friends, my family, all my loved ones. The love i though i had, nothing it was worth. So hard to tell from the outside, that emotional death was my fate.

You can make me run, but youll never break my spirit. Goodbye notes drenched in blood. For there is no use in having emotions. So much easier to leave in hate and not look back then to leave in love and have relationships to pack.

Bleed, Cry, Live, Die, Leave



Hope that evceryone is as happy as i wish i was. . ."

The start of Armageddon
And it's just another day
We all saw the news
Nothing to say
So many friends are missing
And family members gone
And we all pray to God
Help them be strong
And now we stand together
Remembering that day
The lives we live
Will never be the same

And we don't know why
The innocent die
Will this world ever
Find a way to change?
And we don't know why
But we know it's not right
We don't know why
So many had to die
We don't know why
So many had to die

Hate has turned to others
For their religion or their skin
But hate can't solve
The problem it began
Everyone is angry
People are afraid
And no one knows
What decisions will be made

And we don't know why
The innocent die
Will this world ever
Find a way to change?
And we don't know why
But we know it's not right
We don't know why

I feel it welling up inside and Robert Smith lied, boys do cry and with 
blood tears in my eyes i'm and Anne Rice novel come to life, i can't hide 
the monster anymore one can only feel desolate for so long until one starts 
to change in something the mirror doesn't recognize, I metamorphosize, the 
darkness has been biding it's time to claim it's latest victim, fresh meat 
for carnal desires, to become what i became, i viewed the sun for the last 
time. Will you still hold me when you see what i have done? Will you still 
kiss me the same when you taste my victims blood? so crimson and red i feel 
it flowing from your lips, my heart is dead and so are you. And it pulses 
through, the desire to change, to deconstruct all of my past failings, but 
where to begin because when you live in sin it's hard to look at saints 
without them reflecting their jet black auras back on you. And all i have is 
hope, and all i need is time, to bury in pine under six feet of time the 
lies i told me about myself, claw my way out pick the splinters from under 
my fingernails, i won't lose hope, i won't give in. Just live and breath try 
not to die again.


I wanna thrash right now for some reason. . .im really pissed off at my mom and i just wanna hit someone repeatedly with a piece of heavy mining equiptment at leave them bleeding in the moonlight (thanx to george carlin for that lol)"

I believe in the power of cartoons & jell-o. 
I believe in the ability to lust at first sight.
I believe in the ability to meet someone for a split second and never be able to forget them.
I believe that everyone deserves a second chance... and sometimes a third, and maybe a fourth.
I believe being alive isn't worth it unless you know how to live.. although I do have that problem from time to time.
I believe spoons are better than knives.. but the word 'spork' alone beats all.
I recently found out that the dryer does not eat your socks... gnomes come through your dryer from a portal and sometimes a sock of yours will fall in.
And I also believe regrets are worthless.

Well im wicked bored but pretty stoked to be goin back to school soon, it sounds wierd i know but all i do over the summer is sit in my house and realize that i have no girlfriend and no life and just hang out with dave and doug and kyle, on occasion. but itll be fun to be back in school i think, i hope me and dave get the same history class haha thatd be great, and for his other history class he had doug and kyle lol, he'd feel really dumb having sophmores in both of his history classes haha. well 5th period lunch still belongs to me and doug, i dont care what our scheduals say were havin lunch 5th period even if we have to skip 5th period class everyday haha. And science also is me doug and kyles, hey maybe ill get history class with AMANDA DONKER!!!!!! omg i would sooooo fail cuz id look at her allllll the time, she is soooo fucking hott! anywho im majorly bored and need to makeout with someone at least before school starts, makin out with doug dave and kyle is getting old. . .but i must admit daves catching game is getting mighty better, and i can fit my penis in kyles ear now (gauges) plus doug is just all around goin dominatrics on me every night soo it still is exciting, but its like a marriage thats like 10 years old. . .you just need to have that, got piss drunk off of tequilia and found a random girl at the bar that looked amazing (after you were drunk so she was most likely ooooogly but o well) and just went to a hotel and had some fuckin and suckin and touchin action goin on for 3 fdays strate. . .the kind of sex where your certian you have some kind of penial or vagarian desiese, maybe ever AIDS, but you couldnt give two shits cuz you wouldnt mind dieing cuz your soooo damn worn out from the last Alabama Crab Dangle she HAD to get in before you passed out and woke upo in the emergency room with tubes all over you and your mom looking at you like you were just cought jerking off. . . . . . .i would like a little of that now and again but its ok if i dont.

well that was interesting, i kind went overboard with the look like you just got cought jerkin off thing, but hey its happened to everyone. Well my children i will leave you with this, never trust any girl that is taller then 5'3"", has long sexy legs, has pink hair (or whatever color turns you on the most), Has breasts that are about a C cup but just perfect and perky, or a girl who you think your in love with. . .love is actually hate and hate is actually love, thats about how certiant we are about feelings, or at least thats about how certiant of what i feel i am.

He'll hate you now.
Remember how he held you for all those lonely nights, you know you shared, and remember how you never cared about anything he said. Well now he's dead to you so bury him instead.

Words out. I'm not the man i used to be. You knew it all along that i felt this way. So i put in this song, tear me apart for pouring out my heart. You know it wouldn't phanse you in the least.

I hate you now.
Remember how I held you for all the lonely nights you know we shared, and remember how you never cared about anything I said. And now im dead to you so bury me instead.

So here's the one about every heart you stole, and your so sure that your not a thief at all. Im the one who's stealing you and this ransoms overdue.

Everything that's in me says that I hate you now.


Well I personally think thats the best song I have. Well i dyed my hair today, again, and i put red overtop of the purple and got a really nice looking redish purple. Also doug, kyle, and lynne slept over last night and it was pretty rad. I put in my half inch plugs, they look sexy if i do say so myself haha. Im off to try to pigure out a few guitar riffs I can make up to get started makin those lyrics into a song since i wrote them at a ruff time in my life and they are like emo to the max haha.

Incomplete and total adoration
my gift to you my heart was yours
ten weeks you shaped it in one night you murdered it
torn from my chest im layed at your feet 
that first step you took was the worst
since then you've walked a thousand miles
in silence short of a mark i still have these memories
but we will never see what we could have been
remember when we talked about where we would be in a one year from now 
remember when u held my hand like youd never let it go
rememeber cause thats all you can do
well never make another memory
well never make another memory
I iwsh i would have died in your amrs the last time we were together
so i wouldnt have to wait with out you today
this time i thought things were real
you said they were what happend..
you were a priority was i an option
i let you see a side i dont share with anyone
Promises are just word unless they are fufilled
And here from the beginning all i had to offer was my heart
Im sorry that wasnt enough
So we will go our own ways and 
hopefully you will remember the things i told you
Hopefully youll understand that everyhting i said was in Scincerity
A broken Heart is not what i wanted from this 
but i guess ive learned from this
But arent you supposed to learn from your mistakes
I dont consider this a mistake
I just wish the story didnt end this way
Cause im still in love with the person helped me write it
Remember when u held my hand Like youd never let it go
Remember when we talked about where wed be a year from now

I think of awhile ago
We might have had it all
But I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow

But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you

But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night

You have your other friends
They were there when you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't leave your side

But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste

When I needed you most
When I needed a friend
You let me down now
Like I let you down then

So sorry, it's over

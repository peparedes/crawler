I've also discovered a taste for red wine, which is certainly not a good thing for several reasons. I'm going to Livebait tomorrow evening which should be absolutely wonderful, especially considering the 30%&nbsp;discount vouchers. I've been there once before, for my 22nd birthday.

I&nbsp;feel so lost at the moment, in pretty much every aspect of my life. I'm so tired of analysing and reflecting on everything without being able to articulate or decide on anything, that I&nbsp;don't really have the energy anymore. I&nbsp;just thought I'd have a hell of a lot more figured out in my life and mind at this stage of my life that I&nbsp;do. I'm ready to drop everything.

I'm going to Moscow with my mum for a week in a couple of weeks. It sounds pathetic as I&nbsp;really want to go to Russia too and my mum's paying for half of my trip, but I'm really proud of myself for arranging it. She'd mentioned a while ago that it's something she'd love to do, and I know she didn't expect me to follow through with it in a million years. I'm just pleased that I've done something that makes someone I love really happy. It'll be nice to spend a week solely with one of the handful of people on the planet that I genuinely love.

I hope everything works out."

"event","I&nbsp;haven't updated this in over four months, which is a fairly sad state of affairs. I moved house in July and it's turned out very well; I now live on Burley Road with Arwell, Byron and Dan. The location is perfect as I'm within walking distance of Hyde Park and Headingley, and town is only ten minutes on the bus. I've moved house every year for the past five but I'm pretty certain I'll stay here for at least another year beyond 09/10.

I&nbsp;don't recall much out of the ordinary happening since July. Thankfully I've calmed down and stabalised a fair bit, and I'm no longer intent on being out of the house as much of the possible. Not entirely sure why, but whenever I was at home my head felt like it was about to explode. It was probably a case of restricting opportunities to think or dwell on things. That said, even now I&nbsp;usually play football Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and go out Tuesdays and Saturdays, so I'm still not in the house much at all.

I&nbsp;still have mini 'episodes' every now and then and feel like I'm going to have a breakdown. It's really frustrating as I&nbsp;take it out on other people, and I&nbsp;really can't afford to treat people I&nbsp;care about like shit anymore.

It's now only a month til I&nbsp;go to Oslo, I'm looking forward to a break so much. I've got the week after that off work so it'll be a prime opportunity to unwind. I'll only be working about 10 days in December. I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;need to spend some real time with my family too, sadly I've probably neglected them recently. The speed at which life goes by combined with what I&nbsp;spend it doing makes me question absolutely everything. 

This is without doubt my favourite time of the year; bonfire night, cold mornings, Christmas on the horizon. It's likely that I'm going to Whitby on Friday until Sunday. I&nbsp;love the place so much and have managed not to go at all in the last couple of years. The difference between this visit and the last is fairly representative of the last couple of years as a whole.

"event","The last week has been one big meltdown, I&nbsp;don't think I've ever pissed off as many people in such a short space of time. It's the same old boring cycle; chance of happiness &gt;&nbsp;self-created drama &gt;&nbsp;block out the people I care about the most. I've gone too far this time though, and it will cost me.

It was my birthday last month, and it was almost certainly the best birthday I've ever had. In the space of a few days I saw Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Defiance Ohio, Vivian Girls, Mae Shi and Cursive. I also got the chance to see some of my favourite people who I don't get to see that often. 

25; how the hell am I 25?&nbsp;I see it as a 'real person' age, and I don't think anyone would disagree when I say that I'm definitely not a real person. On reflection it's been a pretty wonderful year. A&nbsp;fucking tough year, but a wonderful one. I've met a lot of new people and seen a lot of new places. Heaven forbid I'd ever be melodramatic, but in many ways I feel I've turned my life around. When I look back to a night in September, I was contemplating life without the one thing I can't fulfillingly live without, sat on my own in a church, watching Micah P Hinson with four cans of Heineken, and I'd rarely felt as alone in my life. Of course I still had lots of amazing friends and people who I knew loved me and I could rely on, but it was a psychological barrier that I needed to overcome, and to a large extent, I have.

I desperately need a change of scenery and some breathing space, and it really pains me that for once in my pathetic life I don't have any kind of holiday planned. It doesn't help that I'm still spending a ridiculous and unjustified amount of money on nothing, but I'm still annoyed. Does anyone want to leave the country with me?&nbsp;It scares me a bit that I'd probably just get up and leave to go anywhere, with anyone.

I move house in under two weeks. We're going to be at the top end of Burley Road, five minutes from Hyde Park Co-op and Headingley, I think it's a perfect location. I've already done my research of the essential landmarks; sandwich shops, pubs, cafes, etc.

Maybe this will be the week I&nbsp;sort my life out. Probably not."

"event","It's been another eventful month in my pathetic emotional rollercoaster of a life. Iceland was beautiful. Even though I&nbsp;was only there for a few days it was probably just what I&nbsp;needed; time to evaluate and weigh things up. What that means in reality, is me threatening to cry into my &pound;5 pint like a ridiculous self-absorbed idiot every night. I've had too much time on my hands recently, meaning I actively create dramas/things to worry about. Work's mega busy at the moment and I'm playing football again, so I back to hardly having any free time. It's just a bit worrying that the only way I&nbsp;can avoid sending myself a bit mental is by packing my week with so much that I&nbsp;have no time to think about anything.

I&nbsp;was talking to a few guys in London the other week and they offered me a room in a house down there from June. I've decided I&nbsp;really like London and it's an incredibly tempting opportunity. I still fancy living in Manchester too but this would be completely different as I'd be packing up and leaving all my friends and everyone I see on a regular basis and rely on behind. I've decided that as much as I&nbsp;do want to live in London and Manchester in the reasonably near future, at the moment I just have too much to leave behind in Leeds.

Leeds has got brilliant again in the last few months too., the good clubs and gigs are coming thick and fast. That said, I'm spending my next two weekends in Manchester.

I don't have any holidays booked or plans for summer. This makes me sad. Does anyone have any suggestions?

My current obsessions are falafel and lemon and ginger tea.

"event","SO BORED. I had an operation in hospital last week so have had a lot of free time 'recovering'. I&nbsp;tried to go back to work today but they sent me home after a couple of hours as I clearly wasn't in a fit state. I'll probably be home and housebound for another few days, does anyone want to come and drink tea with me? It probably didn't help that I still went out on Saturday, aided by wine, vodka and painkillers. I'm pretty sure that's not what the doctor suggested.

I&nbsp;am enjoying the free time a bit though as I was on the verge of burning out, I just don't usually have much free time to myself. I&nbsp;don't get home from work til half six Monday-Friday, I play football three times a week in the evening, Tuesdays I go out straight after work til late, and weekends I&nbsp;usually crash at someone else's. 

I&nbsp;can't believe it's mid-February already, when I consider the amount of change that's happened and what was about to kick off this time last year, it blows my mind a bit. Am I happier now than this time last year? I honestly couldn't say. I&nbsp;could identify so many things that are different in my life and myself now, and the vast majority are so positive it's untrue.&nbsp; Most people in my shoes would probably say they're a million times happier, but I have something in the pit of my stomach which will probably always stop me from being 100%&nbsp;happy. That's quite a depressing realisation.

There are some things going on at the moment that I probably need to keep a lid on. I need to exercise some self control and make sure I don't leave myself vulnerable to being hurt, or hurt other people that don't deserve it. The problem is that any kind of self control seemingly goes out of the window once I've had a bottle of wine. I just get so annoyed with myself sometimes, it isn't worth it and I'm not eighteen anymore.

I think I want to travel South America over summer, and I know a couple of people that could well be up for it too. Sadly I'm incapable of saving money like I used to be able to so I&nbsp;don't know how likely it is. I&nbsp;wish I didn't like expensive beer, nice restaurants, not being in the house and my iPhone; what the fuck happened to Jack Cooper of 2004? It makes me so sad that there are so many places I want to see and things I want to do and yet I'm limited by money and jobs. I&nbsp;know that makes me sound like a ridiculous hippy spoilt cunt, especially as my parents gave me a lot of money to travel last summer, but even so.

Someone's asked me to make them a 'slowcore' mixtape, I&nbsp;don't think they know what they've let themselves in for."

"event","Hello 2009. Part of me wants to give it a big&nbsp; 'Fuck Off 2008', but that'd be unfair on some of the amazing times I had too. It was such a fucked up, rollercoaster of a year that it consisted of some of worst experiences of my life and plenty of the best. 

I have no idea how this year is going to pan out, I have several ambitious and frankly unrealistic plans but I'd really like them to happen. Ideally I'd leave my job at the end July, go travelling again during August, then move to Manchester starting September. The rather large stumbling blocks being that this time I'd actually have to have a job sorted out in advance in Manchester for when I returned. Plus, I'd only do it if I could take some of my friends with me, and although there's interest, it'll be a practical nightmare for everyone to have jobs and the like sorted for around the same time. We'll see.

I'm going to sunny Reykjavik for a few days in the first week of March and I'm incredibly excited about it. It certainly seems to be the right time to visit Iceland considering their economic crisis, we've made a killer saving on the flights and accommodation. Since I'm flying from London it'd be a waste not to spend a bit of time there too so I'll have to make sure I do that. I haven't been in about eighteen months.

Not sure what else there is to tell, other than I'm deeply in love with Dana Scully.

"event","The new job's absolutely fine, even bordering on good. I get on really well with everyone and there's some fantastic banter. At times it gets a bit much being surrounded so many girls but I'm enjoying the change of scenery. I don't have any problems getting out of bed early again, which I thought I might have after four months of slobbing it. It's not ideal getting home at 6.30 every evening but it hasn't been as bad as I was anticipating. I still make use semi-decent use of my evenings, I just have less PC&nbsp;time, which is probably no bad thing.

I kind of feel like I need to make more of my weekends. At the moment it really is just go out and get fucked on a Friday, go out and get fucked on a Saturday. I have a fantastic time and generally do much more with my time midweek than I ever used to, I just want to get involved in a few more eventful things at weekends since I work all week, but I have no idea&nbsp; what.&nbsp; I don't think I have anything planned for next weekend so it could be the perfect opportunity to try something different, especially as I have money again.

I've got plenty of trips and good stuff planned; Christmas dinner and drinks with everyone next month, annual Whitby trip in mid-January, trip to Berlin for a few days in February, hopefully a big summer villa/pool holiday in July or August, and hopefully go to the Fest in October. I really want to get out of Europe for a bit but I&nbsp;guess it doesn't really work just for a few days because of the long flights. I really want to go to Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. There really isn't enough time or money. I've got the travelling bug. I've got itchy feet.

Last night was Juvi and it was great, there were so many ex-Leeds faces making an appearance; Byron, Alex, Blonde Ian, Blonde&nbsp;Rob. As great as it was it also makes me sad to realise so many of my good friends live in various parts of the country. Obviously I know it's a reality of life, especially when you make a lot of your friends in your university years, but it's still pretty sad.

I've read a fair few of my old LJ&nbsp;entries from around 2004/2005, and it's extremely weird. When you're 19/20 you think you're mature and know it all, and it's only when you look back on some of the decisions you made and things you did that you realise you're still just a kid and don't know a fucking thing.

Plan for this week:&nbsp;finally get to Starbucks to rinse a gingerbread latte. Finally get to the Christmas market to nail a brandy-topped mulled wine. Somehow get my hands on a Wolf Parade ticket."

I'm a big fan of Trio and Arcadia, and Challenge is the best it's been in years. It's been a strange six weeks, I've had the combination of a hell of a lot of free time and minimal cash. I've spent my Saturdays at the Cockpit or Bassment, my evenings watching films, drinking or catching up with people. 

I've had a wonderful day today. Instead of nursing my head at the PC in usual fashion, I decided to meet Suzie for lunch and coffee before Stephen appeared. We went to Wagamama accompanied by birthday boy Bonse before ending the evening with a couple of light ales at Foley's. I'm going home tomorrow for a couple of days which I&nbsp;really need. Even though in the main I've done fuck all for the past month I've had a lot to contend with, and a charge of the batteries is required.

I've managed to secure a new job too, working in HR&nbsp;for GE&nbsp;Capital. It's about time as I was beginning to struggle financially. I don't start for another two weeks, so in the time before then I'll be free to party safe in the knowledge that I'll have money coming in at some point in the future. After that I guess it'll be back to a world of getting up too early and getting home too late. I've had a life of relative leisure for four months and it's been nice while it's lasted.

Unfortunately my head is still completely fucked, only now I'm not really sure why, which is a bit of a problem. I've changed almost beyond recognition in some respects in the last few months and although it's been primarily for the good of myself, it's left me in a fairly vulnerable position and I&nbsp;don't like it. I've never felt alone, had my heart broken, or had anyone close to me die, and I'm realising it's only once you've been dragged through the emotional mire that you learn to appreciate the need to be close to a fellow human being. It's just a shame it's taken me twenty four years to realise this.

It'll be nice to get settled again and ditch the incessant train journeys, I&nbsp;dread to think how many different places I've slept in recently. I'm certainly not looking forward to washing my own clothes and buying/cooking my own food again.

I&nbsp;spent a couple of fantastic nights in Manchester last week; drinking too much, watching good bands, seeing friends and generally acting like an idiot. I really do need to get to Manchester more often, that's the first time I've been since the flurry of visits in January/February. Gaslight Anthem were incredible, I'd not been looking forward to seeing a band as much as that in years and it lived up to all expectations.

There's still a lot of good stuff coming up. Micah is playing a church in Leeds on Wednesday and unfortunately I'll probably cry. Sun Kil Moon is a couple of Thursdays away which I still need to sort out, then it's Ghost Mice, and the Mountain Goats in London on the 15th which I'm determined not to miss.

Most people still seem to have exactly the same group of friends they did as in school too, I suppose that's probably a positive thing, I just find it a little strange. I don't know, I'm 24, it's probably about time I started doing things that normal adults do, I just can't envisage a time when I ever will.

Travelling was an enjoyable experience, I'm definitely glad I did it. I can't believe I've been on four separate holidays abroad in under a year, totalling almost two months and twelve countries. I am incredibly lucky in some aspects and it's a shame I take that for granted at times. Portugal was only eleven months ago and that seems like an absolute lifetime ago, honestly, so much has happened and changed in my life since then that it really could've been years ago. Fuck, Sweden was only six months ago and that seems even longer.

It seems I have to put my next holiday/break/escape/adventure on hold for the time being and get my act together in the real world. I should be trying harder to find a job and I don't think it helps that I don't have the motivation of being broke to speed up the process. I've fallen back into the enjoyable yet often boring and unfulfilling lifestyle of going to bed late, getting up when I want and having too much free time; a lifestyle I haven't been accustomed to in three years before I started my job. Honestly though, I'm not ready to go back into employment, I've never really fully accepted the fact that most people have to work 35 hours a week for most of their life. The difference is that you can get away with it when you're 20, not 24.

I was pretty much banking on the last two months of free time, holidays and different places being enough to clear my mind and clarify my thoughts, but it hasn't. As nice as it is being at home for a bit and seeing my family, I don't think it helps. I only really feel comfortable and at home in Leeds as it's where I've spent the last five years, I need it to think straight. Hopefully, if all goes to plan, by next month I'll have a new house and job in Leeds to well and truly help me back onto the horse of reality, it's probably what I need.

I'm still really sad about leaving Broomfield Terrace, I loved that house and had some amazing, unforgettable times there. It makes me want to cry a little bit when I think of how moving out signalled the end of an era, no longer is everyone living in Hyde Park. Moving day was emotional beyond words.

I'm a big fan of change within reason, for example moving house every year or two, it's enough to keep things fresh in my life without being too emotionally demanding.

"event","Lots of great stuff's been going on in the last three months. I went to York for a weekend, had a meet-up day with my old Meanwood housemates, saw Lucero and Kevin Devine twice, discovered the Grove Inn, had a few brilliant Christmas parties and meals, the best Bassment night for ages on NYE.<br /><br />I'm going to Stockholm for four days with Gem in about a month which I'm looking forward to. Ideally I'd take the ferry to Helsinki for the day while we were there but it takes about seventeen hours which rules it out unfortunately. The average temperature then is -5 or something silly which should be good, I might even buy a coat.<br /><br />There are loads more good things to look forward to in the next six months too if they materialise; June holiday possibly to Switzerland/France and catching a couple of Euro 08 games, CentreParcs, summer travelling. Annoyingly all the planning and mulling over of the practicalities of everything is proving rather stressful. I just hope everything pans out as I'd like. <br /><br />I've just copied about a thousand old photos from Suzie's external hard-drive that she's managed to salvage from home. The vast majority are from 2004, without doubt the greatest year in my life, it brings a tear to the eye looking through them.<br /><br /><br /><img width=""457"" height=""344"" alt="""" src=""http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/startafire100/Jackdrunkard.jpg"" />"

"event","I've probably had one of the best two weeks of my life. Well, without doubt. Portugal exceeded all my expectations and was pretty much perfect. Carol and Vince who rented us the villa were both incredibly nice people and the villa was amazing. A great swimming pool, pool/table tennis table, proper bar, big TV set-up with Sky+, brilliant bedrooms. Usually at the end of a holiday I'm ready to fall back into familiarity as I was last year but this time I genuinely could've spent a longer over there and being back in Leeds last Monday just made me feel reflective and sad.<br /><br />Getting up to eat my sandwiches in the sun on our balcony, having a dip in the pool with maybe the odd game of volleyball thrown in, knocking out the odd game of pool or six, cracking open the Super Bock in the afternoon, listening to Tell All Your Friends every night, late night technically-superb wrestling moves on inflatable crocodiles, staying up til 4am putting the world to rights; it's certainly a lifestyle I could get used to. We actually did some stuff this year too, like going to a beach, a water park, a restaurant, into another town, it was good. I've got so many unbelievable memories that I can look back on but at the moment thinking about them just makes me want to cry because I'm not still there. This sums it all up quite well:<br /><br /><img width=""429"" height=""304"" src=""http://photos-431.ll.facebook.com/photos-ll-sf2p/v113/248/3/514269431/n514269431_130442_481.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><br />This past week I've had off work has been brilliant too. I need to stop drinking so much and eating so many Canos. A few of us went to Slam Dunk via the Angel on Tuesday and it was surprisingly great, definitely glad I went. After moving football to Wednesday Rob and I went to see Dartz! on Thursday night and had a couple of beverages in the slight breeze on the Dry Dock roof afterwards, seriously perfect drinking conditions. Last night was Juvi which turned out to be the best Bassment night for a while.<br /><br />I'm back at work tomorrow and struggling to face it."

"event","We (my fine self plus seven) are going to Portugal tomorrow which hopefully will be as fantastic a holiday as the week in France last June. We're getting a mini-bus down to Birmingham in the afternoon, flying into Faro at night, picking up our cars there and hitting it forty five minutes to meet the lovely Carol at these premises:<br /><br /><img width=""286"" height=""216"" src=""http://images.ownersdirect.co.uk/a43137.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img width=""284"" height=""216"" src=""http://images.ownersdirect.co.uk/a43139.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Last year we were pretty much in the middle of nowhere which I thought was absolutely perfect but I think there'll be more going on around us here. I'm fully expecting a week of swimming, drinking, table tennis, pool, barbeques, beaches and water parks. There's even a twatting PS2 there.<br /><br />We get back next Sunday and I've got that week off work too so I've got a few things pencilled in. I'm planning on going home to see my family on the Monday, coming back the next day to go to Slam Dunk, playing football on the Wednesday, seeing Dartz! at the Packhorse the day after, and I think it's Juvi on the Saturday. What a couple of weeks.<br /><br />Last Friday night I befriended a tramp at my bus stop. He must've seen me throwing up and felt sorry for me. We talked for about half an hour in which time we put the world to rights and he showed me his impressive weapon. He then jumped in our taxi and got out at the university, what a specimen.<br /><br />I'll see some of you in a week."

"event","I'm properly settled in to the house and I absolutely love it. We have Sky and the Internet installed now and my room is great, I'm really comfortable here. I much prefer this side of Hyde Park too; it's lovely with all the trees and cobbled streets and is a lot more peaceful than the student-riddled side on the other side of Cardigan Lane. Yesterday I saw two police officers force an entry into the strange 'pigeon man' house over the road but I'm happy to let that one slide.

Yesterday we had our belated house-warming party which was a success and mainly consisted of cocktail fountains, SingStar, wizard costumes, spilt drinks, Cano and general outstanding banter.
I've been to the Cockpit three times in the last few weeks too and it's been brilliant. The indie/retro room is pretty unbeatable and it's great familiarising myself with the place again after spending so much time there two or three years ago and then not going in about a year. So many amazing memories of some of the best times in my life.

Next weekend promises to be one of the best in history, I seriously can't wait, especially the Saturday. Friday night is Out Of Spite, then Saturday begins with PT Leeds v ROW football at Goals from 10.30am, then the first Premiership game of the season on Sky at 12.45, then OOS from about 3-11 which will involve the usual bands, car-bar, car park football etc, followed by Garage and Cano. What a perfect day.

I'm not looking forward to work tomorrow. I have a new job now, at the same place, doing project administration and analysis which has been pretty intense. It mainly consists of liaising with management, looking at various departmental processing issues, sitting in a lot of meetings, answering to the nutcase head of department, showing important guests around the place and checking my e-mails a lot. It's more interesting than the processing crap I was doing before but I'm not a fan of the responsibility and I'm quite a nervous person so communicating with people I'm not familiar with on a daily basis is not something I relish. The worst thing is that at the moment the position is unofficial which means I'm still being paid peanuts to do a job that should pay a lot more. The position will probably become permanent at some point and it's great experience to put on my CV, but I miss relaxing and talking to my friends for seven hours a day which is basically what I did before.

I ordered an iPod shuffle today which I'm looking forward to receiving. I usually enjoy listening to the birds sing on a morning but I'm desperate for something to make the depressing morning bus-stop silence a little less awkward, now that I live too far away to walk to work.

The Portugal holiday is less than a month away and it can't come soon enough."

"event","I'm all moved in to 4 Broomfield Terrace and everything is going swimmingly. The PC, sound system and TV set-up in my bedroom is perfect and I've even managed to get Freeview working and splash out on a new computer chair from Ikea. The street is nice and quiet and the ex-tenants and neighbours we've met have been nice. The living room isn't huge but it's lovely and intimate, perfect for pre-club gatherings and football nights.

We found out that the place didn't have a phone line installed and BT can't come out to install a new one til the 17th of this month which was frustrating at first, but I'm currently stealing a wireless Internet connection from the wonderful HAZZAS NETWORK, a network which was available for the whole of the last year and seemingly into this one as well. Thank you Hazzas.

I think Garage is on the cards for tonight which should be an experience, hopefully a brilliant one. I don't think I've stepped foot in the Cockpit for a good eight or ten months. I might have a wander to Headingley in a bit to see what things have been dumped on the charity shops in the last couple of weeks and see what I can pick up.

God I love Wimbledon."

"event","Two weeks of living here left. I know people always exaggerate about time flying and I'm usually guiltier than most, but the past year really has gone stupidly quickly. I've just claimed a big pile of supermarket basket things from the main complex bins that some students (they're all moving out around now) left which will be be perfect to transport all my CDs and DVDs in, as I'll be taking my Ikea shelves to bits so I can fit them in the car. It makes a change to be organised prior to moving time which I've never been before, and with this comes added stress that's never crossed my path before; I'm talking mail redirection, utility company final bill correspondence, TV license nonsense, and lots of other stuff that's seemingly never-ending. I'll be moving into my fourth different house in four years, hmm.

We're hoping to book some space at a storage company on our current street for three days before moving and four after. Mainly because we have to be out of here by 10am on the 30th don't get the keys to our new place til early afternoon  on the 1st, meaning it'll give me somewhere to put my stuff as we'll be homeless for over twenty four hours. Any offers of a place to crash for the night will be highly appreciated! Also, it'll mean not having to move absolutely everything during the excruciating gridlocked carnage that's inevitable on the first of July, just the necessities. So, that'll be my PC, a change of pants and a tin of soup, how incredibly sad. Oh what I'd give for one of our new neighbours to have an unprotected wireless network connection ready and waiting for me to steal whilst our broadband order is processed. 

I had my two wisdom teeth out on Monday and whilst it was a complete non-even in terms of pain and problems I used it as an excuse to milk the last four days of last week off work which is something I definitely needed.

This time last year we were eight days into the World Cup and I was two days into my holiday in France. How thoroughly depressing."

"event","Is it really Tuesday tomorrow? Someone must be kidding me, I'm convinced there's no way it was a week ago since my last day at work. I've slept in five different beds (well, sofas and floors) in five days and it's been a bit of a (ridiculously enjoyable) whirlwind.

After seeing Built To Spill in Sheffield on Tuesday we got the train to London to see Modest Mouse, and I think out of all the parts of the city I've visited, South Kensington is my favourite to date. Two fine drinking establishments in the Gloucester and Queen's Arms, a sandwich shop that even Leeds would be proud of, and surprisingly friendly people. Has anyone got a spare million pounds lying around so I can buy a flat there? 
Modest Mouse were pretty good but they disgracefully ditched the vast majority of the older, far superior material, and I'm guessing it'll be the same deal in Manchester tomorrow night.

Thanks to everyone who messaged me with the birthday wishes, I definitely had a good one. I got money to buy an iPod (which is the best one?), DVDs and CDs, a Pavement t-shirt and a membership to the Campaign For Real Ale society. When I was telling my dad about the ale membership he pulled out a life membership card and it turns out he joined thirty years ago, hmm. I spent the night watching as much as I could of the Champions League final that had been taped for me before I fell to sleep, and then on the Friday I went back to Leeds for one of the best Hospital Radio nights that's ever been.

On Sunday I got the train to Knaresborough to spend a couple of days with a load of my family and although the journey was beautifully scenic, the thought of getting on another train any time soon makes me want to die. My cousin was there too who for the past seven years I've only really seen once a year at Christmas. Even writing that threatens to bring a tear to my eye as between the ages of about ten and fifteen we spent almost literally every weekend in that period together and it's probably fair to say I've never connected with another being on this planet in the way I did with him. It depresses me to think that because of adulthood and the realities of life that I'll never get that back. Even back then I'd worry about us not being able to spend time together because of growing up and changes in circumstance, and although things are rarely as painful when they happen as you'd predicted them to be, it's still sad. 
Anyway, to properly catch up last night, to talk about the things we did years ago, to reminisce over the most minor of details from ten years ago that I'd have bet my life there'd be absolutely no chance of him remembering, and for him to tell me that he thinks about those years every day as I do, makes me feel strange. Happy, sad, relieved, anything, everything, but definitely strange.

Work tomorrow. Fuck off work."

"event","This time of year is traditionally dull and sadly this time around is no different. It's mainly a product of universities breaking up so a lot of people are all over the place for a few weeks. Unfortunately it means that aside from over-playing my records and watching Sky Sports News to death it means I spend an unhealthy amount of time scouring Amazon and eBay looking for things to drain my bank account with. 

I think I've only been to a single club night in the last month and that situation definitely needs rectifying, although I think even if a few people are around for Hospital Radio next Friday I probably won't be able to make it because I'm going out with work that night. Meeting people in there after the pubs close could be an option I suppose, we'll see. Possibly even doing Garage the day after; it's been too long, and you can somehow usually count on a good night.

I noticed in my Cottage Road Cinema newsletter that they've got a single showing of Babel on Wednesday evening, which I didn't catch at the Hyde Park or Vue cinemas so I'm going to go to that. I'm actually looking forward to it more than I should be, probably because it'll be preceded by an hour or so in the New Inn across the road which I have a heap of great memories of from when my old Meanwood house would drink there regularly as we failed the quiz miserably. I reckon I've probably been in there maybe twice in the last eighteen months and it makes me want to cry. It's a seriously lovely establishment with the finest landlord in Leeds and has apparently played host in the past to Jack Charlton and, wait for it, Monica Lewinsky. Hmm.

I'm undoubtedly a big fan of winter but when it comes to around this time of year I'm definitely ready for a bit of warmer weather. Playing football under blue, sunny skies on Wednesday afternoon was absolutely lovely and made me think I was twelve years old again. I was hoping for a gradual transition into spring and full-blown summer and discovering that it's going to be freezing for the most part of the forthcoming week was a bit of a kick in the teeth."

"event","Is it possible to develop such an affinity for someone you've barely even spoken to via the medium of a (disturbingly vivid) dream that when you wake up and realise it was only a dream and didn't really happen, you want to cry?<br /><br />The weekend was one of the finest I can remember; helped by the fact I must've walked at least ten miles in absolutely flawless weather. On Friday Gem and I got the coach to Manchester to see Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, and despite their beyond-awful band name and almost unforgivable lack of consistency, they have one incredible song that I was desperate to see them play, and it didn't disappoint.<br />On Saturday I had a walk to Nonce House where we all wandered to Goals to enjoy a stint of afternoon football. Later that afternoon we watched videos, drank ale and ate pizza, before I collapsed on the floor to be showered in a mountain of shit. <br /><br /> <img width=""448"" height=""337"" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y217/danph/Jack2.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><br />The amazing house in my last entry has already been snapped up unfortunately, as I expected, but some progress has been made regarding living arrangements for next year (from July). It looks like there are going to be five of us, in Hyde Park or non-twat Headingley area, and with any luck it won't be too long before we sort some viewings out. In terms of Hyde Park I think I'd quite like to be in the Hessles maybe, it's quite nice around there. The only place in Headingley I know that I think I'd enjoy is around the Beckett streets, just next to the uni campus. It'd possibly be slightly less convenient than Hyde Park but it's really, really lovely around there. We'll see.<br /><br />I keep threatening to look for a new job but the current one's so laughably convenient that it's proving a major obstacle. How many other people who work full-time and don't get out of bed at a ridiculous hour (7am) are back home by 2:45pm?"

"event","It's frustrating over Christmas when the majority of people go home for a few weeks as it's too easy to let my social life fall by the wayside, but it can be helpful in many ways because I'm more likely to do things that I wouldn't otherwise choose to if everyone was around. This weekend for example, I went and stayed with my family which I'll also be doing next weekend for Christmas.  I probably visit them about once a month on average but it must be a good six months since I've stayed overnight and not just for a few hours in the day, which is fairly disgraceful to be honest and makes me feel ashamed. I'd almost forgotten how great it is to watch football and drink expensive beer with my dad and enjoy the delights of my mum's second-to-none cooking.

It always feels strange going back though, eerie almost. Not in terms of seeing my family, that's brilliant and I love it, I mean it terms of driving back through all the places I grew up and lived out my 'other life' so to speak. It's like floating through a dream, or a kind of deja vu. I've only been moved out and living in Leeds for three and a half years but it genuinely, genuinely seems like another lifetime. I think the feeling of strangeness is probably a bi-product of being uncomfortable, almost nervous in seeing places that I saw every day from a time when I was less happy than I am today. Don't get me wrong, I have heaps of great memories and have always had plenty of friends, I just always felt excrutiatingly trapped and isolated growing up in a small town where I felt I had nothing in common with anything or anyone. I felt expressively and socially crippled, and moving away to a bigger place with new people to do different things meant I could breathe, open my eyes and as pathetic as it sounds, be the person I wanted to be. I guess having the throw-back to earlier times just makes me feel cramped and awkward.

Who's around for this weekend? I fancy going out to do something on either Friday or Saturday night so I can go home on either Saturday or Sunday. If I remember rightly a few of us went to Carpe Diem for a bit before moving on to Fab which was reasonable. I think Hospital Radio is on on Friday which I'd probably be up for if enough people fancied it."

"event","It feels almost disturbingly reassuring to be back on my own PC after finally getting it sorted. I should probably have scrapped it and bought a new one since it's six years old and I've had to replace the majority of the parts, but I having a sneaking suspicion I might just treat myself to a laptop in the next few months.

Who's coming to Gem's birthday night next Saturday? I'm surprisingly looking forward to it. I think the plan of action is to get the night moving at the German Christmas market with a cup or two of the potentially lethal mulled wine and rum, then move on to Wokmania (duck pancakes, you better believe it), then wander the city centre streets looking for enjoyable bars and pubs. I'm thinking places like the one next to City Varities, and the Packhorse (the one in town that's not the music venue, they played the whole Arcade Fire album the last time I was in), and other similar establishments.

I've been in desperate need of something to drag me out of my recent audial-lethargy and thankfully I've found it. I have so many records that I can rarely be bothered to have a proper look through for something that I'm genuinely in the mood for but the other day I did and couldn't have made three better choices than Neutral Milk Hotel - On Avery Island, The Shins - Oh Inverted World, and The Arcade Fire - Funeral. What's strange is that the first side of each LP is almost bordering mediocrity whilst the second side of each is absolutely incredible.

I think tonight I'll lay in bed with a cup of tea, the world's best ham cheese and salad sandwich, and a classic horror DVD. Perfection."

"event","For the first time since I created this journal in February '04 I've let a month pass without making an entry. After a time I stopped posting so prolifically (well, once a week) and promised myself that I'd update at least once a month, purely because I enjoy it, and also so I have some kind of record to look back on after a year, two years, whatever, to remind me of what I was doing and how I was feeling. Unfortunately I forgot that September was restricted to just the thirty days. Balls.

I remember a time when Resident Evil overwhelmed my whole life. For periods during the three years between '96 and '99 when the first three games were released I was a bit of a recluse. After school every day I'd stick Resident Evil on , I'd spend the bus journeys on the way to school thinking about it, and much of the school day doing the same, until I got home and could play again. After slightly lesser obessions with the first Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid games I lost a bit of interest which wasn't helped by the PS2 coming out which I didn't get meaning I couldn't play the sequels released on it. One of those sequels is Resident Evil: Code Veronica which I've only started playing properly for the first time this weekend and needless to say I haven't stepped outside since I got in from work at 3pm on Friday. It's like going back in time almost a decade and I absolutely love it; it's like going back to a time when you believed Father Christmas was real. Now I'm going to have to buy a GameCube so I can play the Res:0 prequel game.

It's great to have the Bassment back. Well, it was after Hospital Radio last week, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't severely disappointed after the opening night at Juvi. Much of the music was shite and the placement of the new bar means it's more difficult to get served which was pretty frustrating at first. I learnt how to manage it better at Hospital Radio though so it's not too bad, and the night was brilliant. Just like the old days.

Ah yeah, I'm doing a bungy jump for charity in the next few months if anyone fancies sponsoring me. I'm not sure what the charity is at the moment but I can assure you that it isn't me.

Time for a cup of tea."

"event","Ah, the token 'last night in this house' entry. I managed to get the keys for the new place today so I've already dropped off the vast majority of my things; well, everything besides my computer and a set of clothes really. I'd by lying if I said my mood hadn't been dampened by walking into the place to find the supposed phone socket half hanging out of the wall clearly in no fit state to attach a phone or Internet connection device to. It's ridiculous, who the fuck would consider renting out a flat or house in this day and age without a fuctional phone socket. So, my biggest worry of moving was possibly having to use dialup or a week or two and now it seems I won't have any access at all for what could be a bit of a while.

This time last week I was trying to grab an hour of sleep or two before the drive back to the port to ferry it back over to Plymouth, and the week before that I'd just gotten over the stress of Chris catching the ferry at literally the last minute, a few hours before running around on deck in the middle of the night with everyone in bed and taking a wee off the back of the ferry into the sea with Rob. Such unbelievably great memories.
I had a genuinely brilliant week though, and I wish I was back there now. One of the best things to come out of it is that I've been reminded of how great swimming is, after not doing any for approximately five years before last week.

I'm not sure what the rest of summer will hold after this weekend; a new place to live, different circumstances in which to live, back to work on Monday, two of my best friends moving to different cities, Bassment (or The Subculture, hah) reopening in September. I guess it could go either way.

Right, I better go pack this thing up and get some sleep, tomorrow will probably be even more stressful than today has been. I'll see you around."

"event","I wish it'd absolutely piss it down or something. It's not that I particularly dislike the heat, although I do, but that's more of a lesser grievance, it's more that I can't stand the general atmosphere of summer and hot weather. I detest the expectancy that I should be doing something differently and have never quite understood the point that I should sit outside solely because the sun is out. I'm not fazed by the weather at all and what I do is almost never affected by whatever exreme it's at.

I'm not sure what's been going through my mind but I've been having the worst kind of dreams recently. The kind where it's not too long before you're about to wake up, making it extremely vivid, which would be splendid if the content was anything remotely half-decent. I know there's nothing duller than listening or reading about someone else's dreams but I enjoy reciting them. The first one I remember is me, staring out of a window in anticipation at my family's plane attempting to land before hitting the side of a cliff and falling a long way. The second involved the world ending, and on the last day of it's existance I was crammed in a gradually flooding bookshop at an increasingly steep gradient with a lot of panicking people. I had one a couple of night's ago that I was sent to prison for a week for not paying council tax, although that could probably become a reality at some point.

The week after I get back from France (July 1st) I move into a new place on Meanwood Road which should be pretty good, and the height of convenience. It's a ten minute walk from the centre of Meanwood, a ten minute walk from Hyde Park, a five minute walk from work, the Merrion Centre, the Bassment and the centre of town, and a two minute walk from Sheepscar sorting office.

I reckon I should try to sleep or at least get off the computer because my eyes are hurting from excessive viewing of the World Cup."

"event","I literally haven't left the house this weekend, and whilst I fear that lethargy may well kill me, there's really not much that interests me at the minute. At least that's how it seems. Is anyone going to see This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb in Manchester on Wednesday? I'm looking forward to it, which I guess completely contradicts what I just said. I've even booked the day after off work.

I've been doing more thinking about housing arrangements in July when the contract on this place finishes, but no decisions have been made. The idea of a city centre apartment is quite attractive, for a year at least. I've found a well nice and cheap one but it's available from next month and I guess the chances of getting one in that block for when this contract finishes is pretty unlikely. Saying that, a big part of me is still really keen on moving back to Meanwood.

I can't believe summer is only three months away. As much as I want to go on a nice holiday, possibly to a nice place in France with a private swimming pool, it's tempting to book the two weeks off work for next month and book myself into a fortnight stay at the drug-testing clinic and lap up two grand. Ok, I know that'll never happen, but it's still tempting.

Does anyone know if anything inparticular is happening next Friday or Saturday? I have to do something. Balls to it; sandwiches, Red40 and Resident Evil is all I need."

"event","I'm seemingly obsessed with looking back at the archive feature of this website to see how I was feeling at the same point last year. I was pretty unhappy with things around certain points of December '04, mainly to do with university, and it makes me feel nice to think that it's better this time round. It's a shame I won't be able to do the same thing as accurately next year as I don't update my journal half as often as I used to.

I've been to Whitby to relax for a couple of days and it's really done the fucking trick. It's probably my favourite place in the entirety of the country I reckon. 
Last weekend was one of the best of my year, too. The Rainer Maria gig was awesome even if they did only play one song from my two favourite RM records; but, fucking Tinfoil, it was worth it. The Bombed Out all-dayer thing the day after was incredible aswell. The DIY punk rock friend and beer fest days are consistently up there with the best for sure. Dicky and Dan need to move to Leeds, I miss those guys.

I'm back at work tomorrow after a week off which is a bit of a cunt. I haven't been to a doctor but I'm pretty sure I've had/still have bronchitis. I can't go to any pubs or gigs this week because it'll probably make it worse again, like it did when I went to see Stars on Thursday.

I'm going to watch THE GATE tonight. You know when you have a vague childhood memory of something in your head but you don't know what it is? Well, I had that about this film; all I could remember was a kid with an eye in his hand and little demons running around. I found out what it was and bought it from eBay. I put on for twenty minutes this morning and it's every bit as good as it was ten years ago."

"event","The two weekends I've had since I started work have been enjoyable at
worst. I reckon I've seen more different people since Thursday than I
have done in a few weeks combined. As much as I did enjoy Thursday
night at the Fenton (and I <span style=""font-style: italic;"">did, </span>immensely),
it's probably not the best idea to drink yourself into a red-eyed
freezing cold mess of a state when you have to be up four hours later.
Actually, it's a great idea, nothing will stop me from doing what I
want.<br>
<br>
Work's going alright; I'm settled in and the job's easy and convenient.
I'm usually home by 4pm so I've pretty much got the whole day ahead of
me as I'm barely up and ready to do anything by that time when I don't
have to be anywhere.<br>
I found out that I have three and a half days of holiday to take before
the year's out, which works out well since Christmas Eve and Day both
fall on a weekend and the two days after that are bank holidays so I'm
off for four days without taking any time off. I reckon with the days I
have in credit I'm going to take the Monday off every week instead of
taking them together because I like the idea of regular three-day
weekends. Oh yeah, we had a bomb scare and evacuation last week too, so
I got paid for doing nothing all day. I'd have loved to see the place
go up in flames.<br>
<br>
It doesn't feel like the usual October/November/December months at all
this year I feel. When I think of those periods in the past I associate
it with dark, depressing mornings, but this year I can't help but think
of light, crisp skies.<br>
<br>
I can't believe I've spent the majority of this entry talking about my extremely dull job. I'm going to hang myself.<br>

"event","Despite buying a heap of new records recently I physically cannot stop listening to The Magnetic Fields. Believe me, I've tried, but I just can't do it. I think the first CD especially of 69 Love Songs may be the most magical thing ever. A couple of nights ago I dreamt that I gave everything up to go see them in the US, then I woke up for work.

Work? Yes. I've already done a couple of days at Halifax/HBOS and I've not quit. I've not even transformed into a fake, lifeless 'cornish pasty' haired motherfucker. It's alright so far I guess; I mean, the work's easy and it's convenient, but I just can't for the life of me envisage me working there for any length of time. The people I work with are nice people, I just don't really have much to talk to them about to make the time go by. The majority are non/basic-English speaking people and middle-aged women who I imagine are working to take their mind of the fact that their husbands are probably away fucking other sluts. 
Another thing that hit me was remembering something I often thought about during my time at school. I'd wake up at 7am sometimes and think 'what day is it? i hope it's friday', and my heart would sink when I realised it was Tuesday. I didn't hate school or anything, I quite enjoyed a lot of it, but I'd continuously question to myself what the point of life was if I was wishing the days to go by, and I can't ever see me avoiding the same conclusions at my current place of work. I'm not naive enough to think that everyone who works loves their job, far from it, and I probably sound like a sickeningly lazy bastard. I just find it a disappointing way to live life.

Explosions In The Sky were every bit as postively mind-shattering when I saw them last week in Sheffield and Leeds than I ever imagined. There are a few things in the world that are guarenteed to bring me to tears. The first occasion that springs to mind is the scene and quote towards the end of Stand By Me when it's been explained how Chris had been stabbed to death: ""Even though I haven't seen him in ten years, I know I'll miss him forever"". It melts me. Another occasion is when 'The Only Moment We Were Alone' reaches its intensily soaring peak.

I'm going to see Kevin Devine at the Cockpit tomorrow night. I'm paying fourteen pounds to watch him play a support set; that's how much I love the man."

shana baby, i know you're having a rough time right now and i just want to let you know that i am here for you.  things will be ok.  if ever you need a break from your house, you know where i live.  holla at your girl, bitch.  i'll give you love.  
i miss my husband.  i will see him around seven though, so i guess i can make it.  i loves him so much!
chris, don't think that i have forgoten about you making my sub.  you will do it. 
i love you

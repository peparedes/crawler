I just have a few things to say to some people

Lauren: I'm sorry i truly am.

Lindsay: I really don't give a shit what you think of me because you don't know me.  ""Manipulative dick""? then so be it i dont care.

Phil: If I'm the one your talking about on your journal, once again i don't care...in the four years of our friendship you hated the person i was becoming i know you did...you made fun of everything about me, when i was christian...some of the music i liked, the way i dressed, my bandana, my friends and so on and that got tiring.  now you hate me more than anything in this world i bet.  if you want to kill me come do itjust know that i dont give a shit enough to argue, fight with you or have any beef whatsoever because its dumb. blame me for anything and everything i dont give a shit.

Ok well anywayz...Avenged Sevenfold played first and I walked in not a very big fan of theirs but after seeing them and how good they are live I'm a converted fan man they're good.  Next was my fav of the night...18 VISIONS!  Man for like 3 songs he kept putting the mic to my face to sing along AHH! I loved it!  After seeing them it got me back into listening to Vanity. <small>very good hxc cd</small>.  Then after them was Further Seems Forever...very emo not a big fan at all. <small>tear</small>.  Oh man after that was a band that kicked everyone's ass...Dillinger Escape Plan...it was the most insane band I've ever seen in my life much kudos to them for being sooooo good.  And of course to finish off the night the band I've been waiting to see for a long long while...Poison the Well.  Oh man when they played Slice Paper Wrists and Nerdy I went insane I loved it...I lost my faith in them for some time cuz their new cd kinda sucks but all is restored from such a good live show.   Kudos to all those bands.  Anywho I gotta read some english schtuff  later on everyone...

it had such an incredible impact on me....the show and especially the ending.

i sobbed like crazy during the last episode and i must say, i simply love the idea of seeing all the people that we love that have passed on in the moments before we die... because its like, thats the greatest thing about dying. is that we will get to see those that have gone on before us.

and it is just beautiful to think about death like that."

"event","tonight i went to see Dark Water at alamo drafthouse. i was pretty psyched because it looked creepy.

well all i can say is that the movie took up 2 hours of my life that i cannot ever get back. i feel so cheated. i feel like i should make the movie sleep on the couch tonight.

they should rename the film ""lame water.""

i am watching full house now. who was your favorite character on full house? i must ask. mine was uncle jessie. 

any man that pays as much attention to his hair as i do is totally cool in my list.

this day went pretty well. i received three rather nice compliments:

""you have such a beautiful smile.""

""you look really cute tonight!""

""you have really pretty eyes...they remind me of angelina jolie's.""

and my most favorite compliment ever was given to me on one early saturday morning in june:

""you have a gorgeous mouth.""

i'm not trying to make myself sound all hot or anything. i am hot. and at the moment i am feeling pretty damn good about myself which doesnt happen often.

so let me have my little moment. and don't worry. by next week i will have forgotten all these compliments and replaced them with insults.

"event","tonight we went to the huge fireworks festival downtown. a friend of ours had all these vip passes and since every july fourth for the past 3 years has sucked, i decided what the heck.

my best fourths have occurred up north. when we go to my aunts house for food and fun and then onto another aunts house for a great fireworks show. but we aren't usually up north on the fourth so i was forced to find another option. 

and although tonight was super fun, it is still second to sharing the fourth with my family in ohio.

actually tonight made me feel rather lonesome. standing there, holding my head up to the point my neck started hurting to stare at the sky, my heart started hurting.

because honestly. what could be better then standing on top of a grassy hill, with a slight buzz on, watching sky flowers explode in the sky with your arms around the one you love.

on a day that celebrates freedom, freedom to do what you want, say what you want and feel what you want... all i can seem to feel is alone."

"event","i just got back from seeing a late night showing of Land of the Dead and i gotta say....i truly enjoyed it.

lots of gore and a pretty good plot. 

it was interesting. the couple next to me brought their 4 year old girl to the movie, in pajamas and she proceeded to sleep through the whole movie.

next to me.

wtf?

i've decided that if the dead really did start coming back to life in zombie form that i simply would not make it.

i don't own any weapons. i doubt that throwing an edgar allan poe book at a zombie would phase it at all. in fact, if the zombies were at all like they are in land of the dead, it would start reading it.

haha. what a sight to behold.

so whats going on you ask? summer break is what's going on at the moment. ya know, sleeping way too much during the day and watching too many infomercials during the wee hours of the night.

am i really 22?

today i went to something sad. a friend of mine's mom died and i went to the calling hours. don't you hate how sometimes you only see people when terrible things happen.

i couldn't stop crying. the kind of moment where you think you are going to make a really loud noise because you are trying not to cry yet at the same time not breathing enough.

i really hate crying in front of people.

on a lighter note i have a crush. yeah but we all know how that goes. 

yesterday my mom randomly asked me about my ex-boyfriend and it got me really sad. it has been way too long since i loved someone that actually loved me back. 

and even though he loved me i pushed him away. poor boy.


i am living a selfish life and i hate it. i have no one to appease. no one to bend over backwards for. no one to mess up my life and make me unselfish because i want them to.

because i love them."

"event","i'm supposed to be taking a shower right now but i decided to get on here and lament for a bit.

i'm going through that stage that i tend to go into every few months. the stage where i can hardly get to sleep at night. the stage where i get lost in my thoughts to the point where even now i'm not in our library at the computer, rather i am far off in the spring of 2002 when things were different.

i dont know what i am doing. i dont know what i am expecting from the people around me and i certainly dont know why the hell i am even breathing this present moment.

see, i already know the truth. the whole truth and nothing but the truth. yet, everytime i think about it, i still can't fathom it.

even though people lie all the time, it still hurts when people lie directly to your face. or in this case, there is no face to face.

there in lies the problem.

so here is how we'll do it.

i'll think of you as the total loser who fed me nothing but bullshit lies, who i dont want to see or speak to.

and you can think of me as the one that got away. the one that actually took concern to you. the one that was always to high up for you to even get close enough to touch. the one who slipped right through your hands.

the one who, even though you may not realize it now, you will always miss."

"event","there is something about me...either some personality trait or something, that makes people think its okay to lie to me.

(yes, i'm talking about you)

allows them to just forget to tell me the truth. 

maybe i'm genetically predisposed to it. 

like the disease that eats away the roots of my teeth, some of the people i care about in life are eating away at the only structure that holds life in place - honesty.

except there is no pill or mouthwash that can reverse the effects of dishonesty.

in other news, i burnt the crap out of my hand in school today. so bad that i couldnt stop the curse words from coming out of my mouth.

the saute pan didnt look hot and i got completely burnt by it.

"event","this morning when my dad woke me up he told me that superman died. if i had been a young child i would have freaked out because with out superman in the world, who would fight crime for us?

but at this age i just felt sad. and lonely. i remember when he had the accident very vividly, i remember that it helped re-enforce my fear of our horses.

it just made me really sad. i hoped he would have been the first person with his condition to walk because he had the passion for it and that...is priceless. 

on a lighter note, my weekend was quite interesting. next time someone tells me that we are going out to a ""lounge"" for the night, i will know that by ""lounge"" they really mean smoky club full of scantily clad women, obnoxious men and, basically, people wanting to get laid.

it was terrible becuase it is so not my scene. i cannot tell you how many times i heard the following phrases: ""i just wanna get laid"" and ""she's totally not gonna give it up dude"" 

the worst part is that i didnt even get a buzz. meanwhile, all those around me had one. therefore i turned into the only one not having fun. not having fun to a point where i couldnt even hide the disgusted expression on my face any longer.

did i mention that someone bumped into me and spilled my shot all over candice and myself?

did i mention that men i dont even know or remember put their hands on me as they walked by?

did i mention that the girl we were with would not commit to a spot in the bar and by the end of the night it felt like my madden's had brutally murdered my feet?

it was...interesting. and i learned somethings:

even if i was a size 0, i would not be one of these girls who wears a low cut shirt with my breasts hanging out and goes to a club to pick up men. or even just to dance. 

i will never, and you will never, meet anyone at a club worth bringing home to your parents. if you do, let me know.

the only men that hit on your when you're not wearing the low cut tops are the, what i call, ""sensible men."" Otherwise known as the guys that are way too old to be at these clubs. 

thats about it for that rant.

last week in church, i got the blood of jesus spilled on my skirt. luckily, it didnt stain. and i kinda dont want to wash it because its really really blessed now.

BUT now i have to wash the skirt because i got gum on it in that XXI store, better known as forever 21. i also got in trouble for taking a coat of a mannequin. it was hilarious.

last week, kara and candice found a list at the grocery store. it consisted of the following:

something
something
pregnancy test
condoms
lemon propel
sugar free red bull

apparently this person is planning on having lots of sex and they, therefore, need to keep their energy level up.

it was much more interesting than our list:

cheese pizza
orange crush soda
funyuns

we weren't planning on having sex. we were planning on making ourselves totally undesirable by eating crappy junk food.

mission accomplished!

alright. check ya later."

"event","last night my sister went out with some friends to have a drink. she really wanted me to go with her but i didnt want to. we had already gone out the night before and i really didnt want to drink again...plus my mom and i had to plan for this church thing.

so she goes out. i call her at about 10:30 to see if she could do us a favor: we forgot to pick up orange juice for my dad and could she pick some up on her way home.

she said yes and that she would call when she was coming home so i could remind her about the OJ.

by 2 a.m. i hadnt heard from her, so i call. no answer. at 3:00 - the same. at 3:20 and 4:00 -  still no answer.

so i get worried. i told my mom that i didnt feel comfortable going to sleep without hearing from her.

we decide at 4 a.m. to go look for her. we go to her friends parking garage cause i assume that she is just staying the night over there.

i wanted so bad for her car to just be there...just be there so i can lecture her tomorrow about how worried we were and how she needs to cal us when she is not gonna come home.

her car isnt there...not on the first floor, or second or fourth.

i feel sick to my stomach. we start looking around the area, but we still dont find her car so we go home.

we go by the store thinking that maybe she is there. she's not, of course, and as my mom goes in to buy OJ i just keep praying to God that when we pull in our driveway, her car will be there.

but it isnt. i look at my mom and i say ""i dont know what we do next...no one's ever gone missing before""

we go inside and make some 5 a.m. phone calls that would be all the more fun if they were just pranks. candice, neil, tim....my sister kendra.

we go up to her room and start looking for numbers. i leave the room and when i come back my mother is so upset that she is crying. i dont know what to tell her, i just make sure not to cry too because i dont want to upset her more.

i have one last option. her friend matt lives about 10 minutes away. maybe after the party, she went over there and fell asleep. so mom and i venture out one last time.

i've never been so scared in my life because if her car isnt there, then i have no more ideas or hunches. if her car isnt there, i dont even have hope.

we drive over there. i started thinking about what my life would be like without my sister, one of the few people in my life who can read me like an open book. i start thinking about how i would survive. i think ""this is just what happens. this is real life. no matter who you are, you cant always have all the people you love stay around for forever. it doesnt matter if your christian or muslim - people get taken away from you in an instant and there is nothing you can do about it."" 

i started thinking about the lovely bones. i start thinking about life events happening without her and  what it would be like to have this void inside of you on every holiday and every birthday.

i start wondering what i would say at her funeral...or if i could even bear to go. or how i would live with myself knowing that if i had just gone out with her, none of this would have happened.

how i probably wouldnt live at all but rather take my own life because the guilt would surely kill me.

we pull onto matt's street and when i see her car, i look at my mother and i just started bawling.

she had done just had i'd suspected before my imagination started taking me to all the dark places in the world. she was just asleep, not dead in some alley off of montrose. 

i was exhausted....all the worry and anxiety came out into my bones as a dull ache.

we took her home, and her and i fell alseep together just as we had thousands of times before.

only this time it was sweeter then ever....because a bad thing hadnt happened. 

and i can have all the people i love stay around me...forever."

"event","today, the mom, the kara and i went to arnes to look at some wedding stuff for kendra.

that place is crazy.

its really big and really crowded and resembles my grandmothers attic.

including the dust.

but we did end up getting some stuff after waiting about 30 minutes in the check out line.

as we were leaving, we kind of got lost because we were trying to avoid the henious I-10 traffic. we drove through this entirely too ghetto part of houston.

i saw a house with an old school vacuum cleaner on the porch with a note that read : ""$25.00 or best offer""

i cracked up laughing and my mom goes ""maybe it was from a garage sale?""

me: ""what, they only sold 1 vacuum cleaner!""

it was funny. then we drove past the hold warren zevon hang out, rockerfeller.

ahh, the memories.

last night kara, candice and i hung out at matt's house. we played board games and drank shiner blonde.

it was swell.

alright. i think thats about all for now."

"event","yes i know. its been forever since i updated this thing.

dont hate me though because now i have pictures!

so a whole whole bunch of stuff has happened since i last wrote in here.

i'm going to make a list:

1. Kendra is getting married june 26th. i am the maid of honor. we are flying down 28 of our family members to join in the joyous occasion.

2. Anastasia came back into our lives briefly. left again. and it now appears she may be back.

3. I had major dental surgery done in which 5 of my teeth were ripped out, 3 titanium rods were put in thier place and i now have a super cool smile.

4. I passed my American Regional mystery basket cooking final.

5. We got a pool put in.

6. We adopted another kitty after my mommy's cat went to heaven.

7. We have kittens!

Thats about it... minus some minute details.

I'll start with the surgery. As some of you may know, i was always missing a tooth after a certain horrific dental procedure. well on march 30 i got that all fixed up and here is the final result:

<CENTER><img src=""http://img2.photobucket.com/albums/v11/TXKat83/DSCN2854.jpg"" alt=""title or description"" height=""600"" width=""450"" /><CENTER/>

its pretty cool. after all my hours of crying and worrying about having it done, in the end it was worth it.

so about 4 hours after my 3 hour surgery was over, i carted my mom over the the ASPCA to ""look"" at the cats.

i'll let you in on a little secret. i knew full and well what i was doing, taking her there...MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

his name is kai and he is a snowshoe. he's the sweetest thing in the world! this was all Jesus - he fits in great and he is just awesome. for the whole week after my surgery, he slept in the guest room with me.

moving on.

our pool is the bomb! it got finished about 2 weeks ago. here are the pictures!

onto the kittens!

about 3 weeks ago a friend of ours found 2 kittens out in his lawn. he called us and we decided to take them in till we could find them homes. we actually got to bottle feed them! aww. but now they are eating more solid foods and soon we will find them good homes.

so there you have it. it sure was fun and they had cinnamon ice cream which made me a very happy girl. its funny because we go out to eat and kara has all these culinary questions for me. te he.

i've become a freak about food sanitization. i made my mom get rid of all the teflon pans and i catch all these unsanitary things that the TV chefs do. it totally grosses me out!

everytime i sit down at the computer, i listen to christmas music on AOL. i can hardly wait.

so today this guy cam to clean the carpets. well, it rained so hard that he couldnt leave so he just hung out, played piano and made us salmon croquettes for lunch.

it was awesome. he's part of the family now.

its so refreshing to meet new people....its amazing how we are all connected by common interest in this huge scary world."

"event","word on the street is that everyone wants me to update. (howdy relatives!)

so here goes.

well i'm off of the AOL wedding songs and onto the AOL break up songs station. this is proof that i have sunk right back into 'cynical mode' once again.

these past few weeks have just been a whirlwind of emotions. ups and downs.

first, warren zevon and johnny cash died. this really bummed me out. but never the less they are up there making some of the best music in the entire world. makes me look forward to going to heaven even more- i know there will be some kick ass music! 

secondly, i actually got the courage to tell my dad that i didnt want to be at UH anymore and that i really wanted to go to culinary school. that was probably the most difficult and courageous thing i have ever done. really. surprisingly it went okay and i am about 3 weeks into culinary school. i'm happy about it.

then, my grandpa passed away. just 8 months after my granny. its things like that that make me really dislike growing up. the older i get, the more people i love drift out of my life and it really tears me up. i'd much rather be two years old, sitting on the counter jamming my mouth full of oatmeal cream pies.

wait. i still do that. HA! haha....that was super funny. needed a little humor in there. hahahahaha.

okay.

and THEN this past thursday i was driving to school at like 6am and i rear ended someone. GO ME! :o/ could it get any better then that!? oh it could. turns out the lady i rear ended works for my dad. DOUBLE DOOZY!!! go kat. so now scarlet is all banged up. and its gonna cost like 1500$ to fix her. *sob*

hmmmm....thats about it. its cold here today in houston which is great. i siezed the moment and ran upstairs, put on a long sleeve shirt and made myself a nice hot cup of green tea.

i'm sure tomorrow it will be roughly 108 degrees outside so.

the vegan thing is going well. although i am about to get more hardcore about it.

no one is here at the house. kara is with neil in san marcos and i honestly have no idea where my parents went. i came out from my room and they were just gone.

perhaps they were abducted. or maybe they spontaneously combusted.

or they just got sick and tired of life and took the car and drove to vegas.

who knows.

well i got some homework to do. i will try to update again soon, i guess i have just been in a little bit of a writing rut. i need some inspiration.

and quick."

i am not proud of this.

mainly because i am not even dating anyone, yet i think of my wedding all the time.

NERD!

i have always had my song picked out too. the one that will be playing when i have my first dance with my husband.

""At Last"" by Etta James. the first time i heard it, i knew it was the one.

just like i imagine that the first time i meet the man for me i will know that he is the one.

but then i heard this song on the *coughcough* wedding song station by Norah Jones called ""the nearness of you"" and it too is a very good wedding song.

what the hell? i am having a dilemma over this and i am not even dating anyone, let alone engaged!!! 

i am such a dork.

"event","well cool cats, summer is over. school is back in full swing.

because of this, i am deeply sad.

so school has started and so far, i'm not the happiest girl in the universe. i always question whether this or that is what i really want to do. who knows. all i know is that spending an hour and a half in my car in traffic each morning is going to make me the biggest bitch to be around- in the world.

for real.

i get up at 6ish each day, leave by 6:45 each day and i dont get to school till about, like, 8:30. holy.

i have also noticed that houston drivers are by far the worst. each day i have a near death experience. and each day jesus has to take a second out of his busy schedule to save my lousy life.

i'm not happy at the moment. and i dont like that.

heres something funny- i saw this obsessive compulsive guy on campus!!! he checked his door locks 6 times before he left the parking lot. i thought this was hilarious but, alas, it got more interesting-

about a half hour later, he comes back....JUST TO CHECK HIS LOCKS!!! haha! then he went back to class. man....it was swell.

then i felt bad for him. in a way i envy him because i am so un organized but then it would be difficult to be super organized. one must find the delicate balance between un organized and obsessed.

true true.

so i figured i would give you guys a little update on the hair situation with some pics! dont get too excited, unless you really want to.

here we go:

it looks better in this one. not as 'big' as it did before. look, i'm wearing glasses. oh and the label on my shirt says 'hairstylist'

dont ask.

i liked this one just cause its kind of artistic. 'thier eyes were watching God'

so thats the hair situation.

i have been looking thourgh some of my old entries. its fun, visiting myself from about a year ago. my favorite  is still my <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~ijustwokeup/2003/01/25/"">100 things</a>. i had fun doing that.


well i suppose thats it for now. i will leave you with this cuteness for now. beware. below is something amazingly cute....BEWARE!!! I WARNED YOU!!

"event","i took a gamble....me. me who is not a gambler.

and i am now suffering the consequences.

i had this coupon for a free haircut at this place i had never gone too. that should have been the first sign- who is willing to give out a good haircut for free? so anyway. i was too impatient to make an appointment with my regular stylist so i decided to try this place.

said place will remain anonymous...although i should really tell you. and warn you never to go there.

i guess if you are really concerned, ask me and i'll tell you said places name.

so anyway this is what i started out with...i was displeased at the time but now how i LONG for it.

<CENTER><img src=""http://images.snapfish.com/3383993923232%7Ffp8%3Enu%3D3238%3E8%3B6%3E%3B%3B3%3Ewsnrcg%3D32324%3B%3C779%3C%3A8nu0mrj"" alt=""title or description"" /></CENTER>

i must have been blinded. that doesnt look so bad.

anyway, i bring in this picture:

<CENTER><img src=""http://images.snapfish.com/3383993923232%7Ffp8%3Enu%3D3238%3E8%3B6%3E%3B%3B3%3Ewsnrcg%3D32324%3B%3C779%3C%3A7nu0mrj"" alt=""title or description"" /></CENTER>

i explain to the girl how my hair is ultra thick and needs to be cut just right. i want it choppy and razored, thinned out with an underlayer so it lays nice. i tell her i dont want to loose too much length.

so she takes me to shampoo...she told me my hair was dry and lectured me which i hate! i dont pay to sit down and be scolded like your my parents okay.

i can't really understand her english, therefore somehow i end up gettin some 10 buck deep conditioning treatment. 

and get this: she had the audacity to say 'your natural hair color is much prettier than this color you've got now'

HELLO!

does she get the concept? I AM PAYING YOU TO DO THIS!! ha i mean...what? i dont even know how i reacted....obviously i didnt punch her like i would have if i hadnt been in an exremely uncomfortable chair with her hands in my hair.

but come on. if you ask anyone who knows me and how i looked with blonde hair they would surely tell you i am 10 times hotter with dark hair.

anyway. she cuts it....styles it. and it looks atrocious. its puffy and short and ugh.

they didnt honor the coupon either. so basically i payed 30 bucks for crap.

this crap:


<CENTER><img src=""http://images.snapfish.com/3383993923232%7Ffp8%3Enu%3D3238%3E8%3B6%3E%3B%3B3%3Ewsnrcg%3D32324%3B%3C779%3C%3A9nu0mrj"" alt=""title or description"" /></CENTER>

see how happy i look!  :o/ heres another!

<CENTER><img src=""http://images.snapfish.com/3383993923232%7Ffp8%3Enu%3D3238%3E8%3B6%3E%3B%3B3%3Ewsnrcg%3D32324%3B%3C779%3C%3A%3Anu0mrj"" alt=""title or description"" /></CENTER>

i came home and straightened it so it looks a tiny bit better...but i think i look like a 30 year old. 

really.

bah! kara asked if i cried....and i said 'i dont cry. i get angry...and violent' i was driving like a banshee outta there.

so i learned a few things:

A: never go somewhere that they are willing to cut your hair for free with a coupon. this is bad news.

B: never go to a salon that is empty...also a bad sign.

and thirdly, never be so impatient that you end up screwing yourself in the long run.

i also decided that i am never letting anyone who i can't understand when they are speaking, touch my hair.

okay...i'm going to go to bed now. i want to get up early and shop....maybe some clothes would make me feel better but lets face it. i am not to happy with how i look overall at the moment so i dont see how it will help.

whatev.

tell me what you think...and candice if you see this please assure me that i will eventually love it.....please?

how lame is that?

anyway, in my previous entry i discussed how abandoned shoes freak me out. well tonight while i was taking a drive on highway 6 i noticed something in the road.

and i thought 'what the...?' no, ladies and gents, it was not a shoe. it was a new york yankees baseball cap.

odd hmmm? i wonder who it belongs too.

dont get me wrong, i love the rain, but i really wish i could ask jesus to please tell all the creepy crawly things not to come out because of it.

i swear, its like all the geckos and frogs know i am scared of them so they all try to freak me out. right when i pull in the driveway- i see a toad. then pulling into the driveway-i see a baby gecko. i get inside where i assume i am safe. nope. as i am walking to the library i happen to look up and there is a huge gecko above the door outside.

holy lord.

yeah so i am writing this and twice already this little bity spider has come onto the computer screen. twice i have blown him away cause i dont want to kill him. if he comes back again....he's dead meat.

third times a charm.

"event","life is boring over in these parts.

friday i drove kendras truck, with a couch and wicker thing in the bed, to neils up in san marcos. it was fun but scary. every 5 miles i kept thinking 'okay, this is it. this is the moment when they just fly out and cause a major accident on I-10.'

but God is good and that moment did not come.

so then i drove home alone the same day. it was fun. i got to scream to the music which always makes travel more fun.

'ohhhh! we're half way there! ohhhh oh! living on a prayer'

sweet.

every time i am on the freeway and i see an abandoned shoe along the side of the road, it really creeps me out. i start wondering where the shoe came from. who it belonged to. if they miss it. if they are still alive. if they just got tired of the shoe and threw it out the window. 

i'll never know. but it makes the ride more interesting.

sorry my life is so bland. perhaps if something fun was going on right now, it would be cool. maybe if i saw something outrageous. or saw something beautiful. or if i was in love.

maybe if one day i was in the grocery store, picking out an eggplant, a young man came over. and casually he said 'i make a great eggplant parmesan.' i'd say 'really?' and then he'd start rattling off 'well, i find the perfect freshest ingredients, then i start with some herbs......' he'd keep telling his recipe and i'd be half listening, half in awe of how perfect he is. then, like a cliche, he'd say 'maybe i could show you some time?'

and then it would become our ritual thing. we'd find the coldest autumn evenings and spend them making eggplant parmesan. and i'd fall for him. and one day i'd reveal to him that i never really liked eggplant parmesan until i meet him. and that, that day in the store, i wasnt even looking for an eggplant. and he'd kiss my forehead and tell me he loved me.

and then maybe we'd get married. build a little life together. and then one evening i'd make him eggplant parmesan and he'd say 'we haven't had this in a while' and i'd say 'well i have something to tell you.'

and then we'd start a family. and as we got older we'd revel in telling our children the story of how we met.

and we'd spend our entire love together...our lives together, as the couple that was born out of hope.

the hope that love comes in the most unexpected places.

maybe.

but i think we know thats not going to happen anytime soon.

"event","so the thursday before karas surprise party, the necklace my cross is on totally broke. for the second time. therefore, a trip to the mall was in order.

monday, we meet kendra for lunch at 'sweet tomatoes.' kara kept calling it 'sweet potatoes.' i kept making fun of her. it was swell.

so then after that we go to memorial city mall. we go into mervyns because kara wants to look at the jewelry and boy did we have a time! first of all i tried on this total 'britney spears' esque hat.

a very strong one.

Perhaps because it makes me think of the past-

old friends.

happy times when i was younger

and life was simple

and i was truly  happy.

i have no idea what the song is about, but it is something magical-

something that makes my heart beg for younger days, of dress up and crushes.

teenage youth and small things that were so big back then.

my family. and times when all that was important was making sure to say 'i love you' to them before you went off to dream.

days when the things in front of me seemed more inspiring then the things behind me.

times unlike now, where everyday is a chore and a constant effort.

a constant reminder to 'be happy.'

kara and i jam out to this song in the car. and the best part is we dont care who looks.

so sorry i havent updated in forever. i havent really had much to talk about. not much has happened.

but i am feeling rather shitty. i'm just starting to see the bad in people and its really ugly.

i feel like some people only call me when they have nothing to do. or to see what i can do for them. 

they dont really call to see how i am. it blows.

this probably sounds like every single teen angste post ever written except this time its true.

i have also desided that man are a waste of space on this earth. i mean, seriously. what are they doing here? no i'm not gonna go as far as to not like men but i am just not gonna waste my time on a guy unless he isnt a waste of space. thats all.

i called my orthodontist today. it makes me sick to my stomach as usual.

oh i got accepted to the university of houston. woot. leave me congrats or else. weight watchers is back in full swing too.

and i have decided, also, that i am going to write anastasia a letter. she deserves to know whats been up all this time. and frankly, i miss her. besides little superficial things she was always a good friend. SHE asked how i was. :o)

oh i just thought. men are here for a few minute reasons: making babies, opening up jars and fixing things. thats about it.

i found some pics of me from highschool. perhaps i'll show ya later.

okay. thats enough boredom for now.

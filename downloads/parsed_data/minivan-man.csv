"event","I went to sea world yesterday with kandra melissa and corteo. it was alot of fun and I took some pictures which I'll upload later. So we went opn one of those rides where you get splashed with water. kandra and i stupidly got in the front row, so we were soaked. So its already cold outside and ive been sick for bascially the past 3 months. Then we go on a roller coaster to dry off. if works, were dry. But you guessed it I woke up today so sick I couldnt breath. so guess what. I didnt have to go to wild splash which i was dreading. anas dad had no choice but to let her go without me. I couldnt be happier"

"event","so last night my mom actually let me go out with corteo and elntz, I almost didnt have to lie about where i was going, I told her I was at the mall but ended up driving around and going to anthonys. But at least she let me in the car, I guess thats an improvement. It was a night like any other, an over packed car, murph smelling horrible, me freezing. We picked up ana and hung out but we ditched anthony which I felt kind of guilty about, oh well. Ana had money from her tip jar from work that day so we stopped at hess. Ana bought me skittles and some energy drink. Were standing in line and this creepy old dirty guy was looking at us. Ana walks away leaving me alone with this guy and he asks me if we are 18...eww. I told him were 15 and hes like oh god dammit Im sorry. gross gross gross. I was still nervous ao ana came over then she called over corteo. The cashier lent us a dollar and we got into corteos car. Ana screamed pedaphile at the guy as he was walking away. Right now Im waiting for tommy to pick me up and then its reneseince festival time. later"

Were sitting in joeys room and all the sudden i hear this like growl/scream right behind me. So i have now lept across the room and I am basically in steves lap. I dont think my heart has ever beat that fast. So like what always happens, I talk with them about scary shit get paranoid and then get to go home and sleep alone. yay. so needless to say I didnt sleep last night because the ""girl from the ring and the excorcist girls lovechild"" kept popping in my head and i thought she was behind me, so I atempted to sleep with all the lights on, it didnt work. so i re-did my lj again and I stole the background from ginas myspace, sorry.

"event","So I went to joeys last night, again. I hung out there with steve joey pie albino and shane. It was fun as usual. I love those guys, you know, even though shane calls me a whore every 5 seconds, all in good fun lol. Seeing as my phone randomly got no service for a day kandra was forced to call joeys cell phone 300 times trying to get in touch with me. This made him angry seeing as he had no minutes, sorry joey. So after yelling and screaming corteo finally found joeys house. I got the funniest video of pie doing ""the corteo"" and I watch it every five seconds. So I get in the car. Corteo Anthony Kandra and Murph. murph decides to skip the deoderant, bad choice, everyone yells at him for the rest of the car ride, not in a mean way though he didnt really seem to care. I was surprised to see that anthony actually remebered me. We went to the crystal beach haunted house and played hide and go seek, not that interesting. We went around after that slamming into trash cans, mildly interesting. We had to drop anthony off and we went 100 down his road and almost drove into the lagoon, muy intersante.It was pretty boring after that, we had some laughs. OH I almost forgot. I found out kandra is afraid of graveyards, I found this out on the way to a garveyard, not a good situation. An interesting night."

I went over to joeys at about 4 o clock and we watched this movie called september tapes or something it was supposed to be about a guy that went into afgahnistan and made a documentary and he did all this tsupi d and crazy shit and people died and all that and it was sad and exciting and we were under the impression is was real. Then we watched the extras and behind the scenes, and one of the guys that was shot in the heart, was being interveiwed. We were like whoa wait what happened. Turns out everything was scripted and yadda yadda yadda. So we went out and bought a case of bawls got hyper drove around came back played resident evil. so were all on sugar rushes and then sugar lows. Later around 11 we go to stevens house and we couldnt play with the pig kandra had been smoking and everyone was all mellow, nothing like last night. around 12 my mom called and said she wanted me home. So it was a pretty good night i got to hang with joey and see steve who i havent seen in a while and hang with matt pie and diony. all in all it was a good night"

Went to stevens house everyone there was either drunk or stoned out of their mind and i came home smelling like cigarrettes spilled beer and anthonys vomit. It was a lovely odor. BUt the coolest thing ever, me vessi and kandra went outside and we heard snorting noises and we just thought is was drunk kids being gay. We walk around the corner BAM there was a fucking pig. a pig! me and vessi freaked out and kandra fed it beer lol. mikey b showed up to her party so kandra was happy. I think hes actually gonna remember who I am for once. The whole tres bien gang was there minus cody so that was cool. Julius showed up only about 4 hours late and by the time he got his ass over here the party was over and i was pist and just told him to go fucking home. ugh I think I might finally be over this douche, took me long enough."

Then i assumed he must be outside. walked outside he wasnt there. tired to go back inside, guess what no re-admittence if your under 21. great. my brother shows up we drive around and then i spot julius inside the club, the guy at the door nicely lets me run in. turns out. he was backstage the whole time hanging with david he got his poster autographed they gave him some of their bottles of water AND the email address for their producer so he could look into getting signed.

"event","things seem to be feeling better now. Maybe Im sadistic but everytime I look at her trying to fit in and see her not talking to anyone, I cant help but smile. Sure its bitchy but I guess she got what she deserved. I do admit I look at her sometimes and think of the better days and how close we were and I start to consider forgiving her and trying again, but I always seem to stop myself. Honestly deep down I cant stand to see her like this but I have to stand my ground. Im feeling alot more loved lately and Im feeling better about myself. I had a picnic today at school during lunch, it felt nice. All my friends were around me and the florida sun was shining as we all laughed and ate, looking back on it it felt like a scene from a movie. I cleaned out my closet and feel so much more organized now and I love it. It feels like its going to be a great new year."

"event","I'm starting to miss everything, I dont want my mom to know though. This year everything has turned into a first, my first christmas without my dad, my first ski trip without my dad, my first birthday, his first birthday without me. Last year as the ball dropped he said it can only get better from here. I believed him and things proceded to get worse. I'd say that it can only get better from here but as soon as i say anything like that it gets worse. whats next i become an orphan. I wish I could blame this all on someone. I want to blame it on myself, on god , on the friend he was staying with, but i know there was nothing to control it. I miss everything about him. I miss his croked tooth in the front. I miss him trying to tan. I miss waking up in his house and seeing him get ready for church. I miss how we used to just drive around listening to music and I would watch him dancing around in his seat. I miss him fixing his hair in the mirror and always talking about how beautiful he is. yes lord help me I even miss him trying to encourage me to lose weight. I miss how health conciouse he was. I miss how he always smelled like sun tan lotion for no reason. I miss taking care of him and him calling me daddys little nurse. I miss how vain he was. maybe this is why Im so vain now like i have to make up for the missing ego. I hate my mom going on match.com as much as I want her to be happy I dont want another man in our lives. I miss grocerie shopping with him and I even miss  when he would yell at me for buying junk food. I miss him saying the prayer of jabez every morning. I miss his charm and his wit. His stories that he told me over an over. I wish I could be like him, for just a split second. I wish I could feel what its like to get out of every situation and what it feels like to be so slick. I have flash backs of speaking at his memorial. It hadn't hit me then, nothing had phased me. It felt like I was caught in some dream. People came up to me and asked me how I could have delivered such a calm speech. All I could say to the people was ""Im good at pretending"""

"event","i had the weirdest dream last night. i always have these dreams where i go to my camp and ive forgotten something of paramount importance like a toothbrush or shoes or underwear. Its just a stress thing I have and I always have these dreams even though camp isnt until summer. But this time I had one where i actually remembered everything. It started out a few days ago. I had gotten to camp and gone into my cabin and for some reason char was my only cabin mate. and then other stuff happened and it ended unfinished. Then last night it started out that I missed orientation because i went on a boating trip right when i got there. I was like the best boater on this weird little lake. At the end of our trip i fell into the water and couldnt get onto this like wooden dock because i was like too heavy for my own arms. Then when i got pulled onto the dock and for somereason i bought a carmel apple and shared it with everyone. So i got back to camp and went into my cabin. and the cabin was like totally cool like diff colors and awesome furniture. No one was there so I assumed they were at an activity. So I did the weirdest thing. Char is your readin you know this is wear you realize it must be a dream. I started oragnaizing and hanging things in a closet that was there and aI was cleaning and making my bed. So weird.

I heard a song yesterday that said "" shes gone on haitas from make-up"" and i was like THATS ME THATS ME. Ive finally gotten used to how I look without gobs and gobs of makeup. My skin has cleared up all thats left to do is lose some weight and I'll be where I want to be. I cant wait."

"event","well i am in new york.  i got the road runner cable internet to work, the plasma tv that comes with my furnished apartment is amazing (i'm not joking), and i don't get mtv because i have the most basic cable package time warner offers.  will get upgrade today.

the apt. is a mess because i have no place to store my stuff, really.  welcome to the wonder of nyc closets.  santiago seems stressed out and a bit depressed.  he has peed once where i set up the wee wee pad and once on a random spot on the floor.  i am afraid this move has stressed him out.  he's not used to the sounds of a big city.  he's used to the sounds of allston, which is REALLY quiet compared to nyc.

he barks at everything, and i am afraid bloomberg will come to my door and fine me with those new laws he's trying to pass where your dog cant bark for more than 10 minutes.  oh man.  

other than that i am in good spirits. i will hopefully have brunch with joey and maggie today, kicking off my residency in new york with a bang.  matt leaves later today, which is sad, but we knew this moment would come and he'll be back soon enough so it's ok.  

now i'm going to try and organize my crap, and it wont work, and i will get frustrated and sit down and watch more plasma tv action.  :)"

i got the apartment.  i am moving to new york in june, possibly the 5th or the 12th.

i will be living in a rent controlled apt on the upper west side.  i am very very lucky.

i dont have a job yet but i am optimistic (not really, i'm actually very very scared but whatever).

i am terribly sad to be leaving my friends behind in boston.

but new york awaits, and i need to get excited (i'm not yet.  maybe it hasnt sunk in?).

so yea, things are good.  i have tried to step back and appreciate what i have, and even though i do not have a job lined up, i do have very many positive things in my life, so i am trying to maintain a positive attitude i guess.

1.  i'm getting married.  leave for lunch one day saying that i'm ""meeting someone,"" then come back an hour later sporting a huge rock and smeared makeup.  make a huge scene and continually stare at my fake ring, whispering, ""isn't it beautiful??""

2. i'm pregnant.  call my boss at home late one night and quietly explain that i have some ""very private news.""  explain that i am pregnant with an out-of-wedlock baby and that my very religious mother will disown me if she finds out, so i am moving to new york, where my imaginary sister knows a doctor who can ""take care of it"" for $200.  

3.  i have decided to become an actress.  i will move to new york to pursue this ""life-long dream"" by trying out for herpes and tampax commercials.

"event","even though i totally want a great career and all that, and even though sometimes i'm afraid it won't happen, lately i think the best thing for me this year might be to find a way to pay my bills in new york (i.e., waitress and temp or something like that), and work on my movies, myself, enjoy the city, and apply to grad school, follow a dream.  because sometimes i feel like i'm rushing things when i dont even know exactly what i want to do.  maybe i just need to relax and let things happen when they will happen.  

just because i wont have the best job doesnt mean i wont be succesful.  when i quit my job in november i was miserable, and it was a terrible time for me.  i don't regret what i did, it allowed me to regroup and think about what i need.  

just because everyone follows a path doesnt mean i have to, right?  i'm not saying i dont want a job, obviously i'd love job and benefits security, but maybe that's not my only option.  maybe i can breathe."

"event","so even though i'm still sarcastic and cynical, i am the happiest i've ever been, i think.  i say this with some hesitation, however, because i always feel as though i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.  nevertheless i cant deny that for the first time in years i am happy, vibrant, not depressed or anxious, and generally in a good mood.  

this feels really weird to me, as though it must be a trick somehow, as though it can all end in an instant.  so for right now i'm trying to enjoy it and appreciating what i have RIGHT NOW.  

anyway, this doesnt mean that work doesnt suck or anything.  i still hate it here.  i just say it with a smile now. :D

in other news, i think fruit makes me hungry.  today i had an orange and immediately after i ate it i had the most incredible hunger pangs ever.

oh! i almost forgot! i almost got molested today.  not joking.
<lj-cut text=""disgusting old man story"">
so during my lunch break i was sitting at the Boston Commons (huge park) waiting for a phone call and reading a book, when i notice this 50-ish man sit in the bench across me.  i continue to read for about 15 minutes until i realize he wont stop staring at me.  i look up at him, only to realize that he was MASTURBATING!!! while staring right at me!! while 10 feet away from me!! 

i was totally freaked out so i stood up and walked to the other side of the park and called matt.  he calmed me down and told me to call a cop or something.  i said i'd think about it and we hung up because i had to go back to work.  as soon as i hung up, however, i realize that the old geezer is standing right behind me, finishing himself off!! he was following me!! 

i immediately ran away and found a cop who thannkfully was standing by, and told him my nasty story, gave him the guy's description and went back to work, completely freaked out.  disgusting.  the worst part was i saw his boner.  yea.  </lj-cut>

ok, that's enough for now.  i think i've freaked you all out enough."

Joe is from Puerto Rico, like me.  Occasionally he hits on me, tells me about his daughter, offers a smile and some banter.  But lately Joe has been giving me the coffee for free, charging me just for the muffin, saving me $2.50.  This adds up to a whopping $7.50 saved every week (yes, i spend a lot on coffee).

2.  i am nevertheless looking forward to leaving the hellhole that is boston, as i am so sick of being here i can hardly stand it.  dont get me wrong, boston is a great city.  i've just been here too long.  

3. i hate how burnt out everyone my age is.  everyone either hates their job, hates their situation to some degree, or wishes they were still in college.  do things ever get better for the post-college set?

Kwame:  Yes, he's hot.  Yes, he's from Harvard.  But Omarosa will be the end of sexy, smooth Kwam.  She lost Jessica Simpson, for God's sake.  You just can't lose the pop star.  This will anger the Taj Mahal's general manager, as well as the pop star herself, ending Kwame's chances.

Bill:  Ahh, Bill.  My sweet, panty-dropping Bill.  Cigar-smoking, business-owning, drool-inducing Bill.  You will win not only my heart and loins, but a quarter of a million dollars and the respect  of the Donald.  Perhaps there will be a glitch or two in the golf tournament but who cares?  You will be victorious.  And I will spend a few delicate minutes with my vibrator celebrating for you, with you.  :D"

so here's my tiny rant of the day:  this FCC thing is getting out of control.  it seems that the religious far right is taking over and enforcing censorship where free speech once ruled.  to me this isn't really just about stern's raunchy humor, or janet's stupid nipple piercing.  it's about people being able to say what you want.  yes, stern goes overboard sometimes, and janet's stunt was a bit much.  but come on, aren't we taking this too far now?  where is freedom of speech?"

"event","Random thoughts:

1. when you are a confused, secretive and very complicated person, it is not often that you feel understood.  in fact, you often feel as though you are never happy, never enjoying anything.  you feel separated from everyone you know. you are not unhappy, or even hateful, you just dont relate to anyone or anything.

2. there is little i don't obsessively ponder.  and yet there is so much i just dont know.

3. i barely eat during the day, yet i cant stop thinking about food.

4.  i feel closest to the one person in my life who is paid to see me.  i also look forward to seeing him the most.  

5.  this is all quite depressing, yet i dont feel depressed at all.  hmm.   

more later."

"event","here's what i think will happen in America's Next Top Model (aka BEST SHOW EVER) tonight.

I predict that miss shandi aka walgreens with a smile will take home the big bombastic prize, with miss yoanna coming in second.  however, i am having my doubts about yoanna because the judges seem to think she's obese when in fact she's ALMOST as great as Adrienne from the first season, aka THE HOTTEST EVER.

if it were my choice, yoanna would take it all, with shandi coming in second and mercedes third.  i love mercedes' personality but she is simply NOT hautre couture.  

ok, that is all.  :)"

"event","Mary Wills is over sixty but at a time when her contemporaries are looking forward to retirement, Mary has an unpaid full time job. She is a full time carer for her frail husband and frailer mother.

Mary is the sort of person you can imagine being photographed in the local papers clutching her OBE for community service. If David Cameron's Big Society had a poster girl, it would be Mary.

Mary is indeed in the papers this week but not because her kindness and self -sacrifice has received its just rewards. Instead, Mary is locked into a frightening and expensive court battle because the government wants to deport her frail mother, Myrtle Cothill. 

Myrtle's father fought for Britain in two world wars. She has no family in South Africa and no home there any more. She cannot walk unaided and is losing her sight. 

If this were not injury enough, Mary and Myrtle have been accused of lying by the tribunal chair - although the lie he actually mentions appears to be an error of arithmetic -Myrtle's age is wrong by a year on her court statement. I suspect that this may be the chair's excuse to himself for this reprehensible decision. 

There is a change.org petition to support Myrtle. It's been very effective so far because everytime it gets another 50,000 signatures, Myrtle gets a stay in execution.

If you haven't signed this petition already, please follow the link and consider signing it.

"event","I was inspired by <lj user=""desperance""/>&nbsp;and his post on Gaudy Night to re-read this. <br /><br />I'm very fond of the Lord Peter Wimsey series but some things about &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; are quite odd to the modern reader.<br /><br />The book was published in 1935 and set in the same year. <br /><br />Some bits of the book are timeless, Harriet is preparing to go to her old college reunion and is anxious about it . The characters in the book she's writing aren't behaving, her last relationship ended badly, Peter wants to marry her and she feels pressurised .&nbsp; She's idealistic about her college and Oxford life but discovers that a mentally disturbed prankster has been sending poison pen letters to the scholars. Harriet and Peter solve the mystery and resolve their relationship.<br /><br />However, other parts of the book read oddly to the modern reader. The shadow of Nazi Germany hangs over the book. Harriet has recently toured Germany , Peter keeps disappearing to put out diplomatic fires on the continent whenever Sayers wants him offstage and discussion of Nazi associated policies pervades the book. <br /><br />A minor character, Miss Schuster -Sclatt is an enthusiast for eugenics and sterilising the unfit -and indeed some US states had pilot sterilisation programmes at the time-without arousing horror or disgust in any of her listeners, who seem far more exercised by her lack of tact.. The contrast between our heroine's intolerance of minor social failings and silence on major ethical issues is staggering . Harriet is clearly not in a good state and perhaps her self absorption reflects depression rather than pettiness. <br /><br />It's possible that Sayers is making her views felt by putting these opinions in the mouth of an unpopular minor character . However, Peter,our hero, warmly approves of a suggestion that condemned murderers should be used for scientific experiments (as opposed to hanging) made by one of the more liberal dons -another Nazi echo . Padgett , the likeable college porter is made to remark &quot;we need a Hitler&quot; although it's not clear whether he means it or is subtly criticising the views of the tradesmen he's talking too, who long for the days when ladies were ladies . <br /><br />The other running theme is about women's roles and the tension between marriage, motherhood and vocations. Some of this is clearly used as a plot device- Sayer camouflages&nbsp; the obvious culprit in the foreground while subtly misdirecting us into a debate about celibacy and mental health .<br /><br />Does the novel merely reflect the approval for Hitler and eugenics that was widespread in the UK at the time despite the Manchester Guardian reporting concerns as early as 1933( -see link to pro Hitler letters protesting against the Guardian's &quot;unfair&quot; coverage<br /><br /><a href=""http://century.guardian.co.uk/1930-1939/Story/0,,126932,00.html"">http://century.guardian.co.uk/1930-1939/Story/0,,126932,00.html</a>), is Sayers cleverly using the topical debate to increase the tension in the book or are we seeing a hint of Sayers own views ? <br /><br />Either way, much though I like Peter Wimsey, I have no desire to live in the world of Gaudy Night."

"event","by Catherine Cooked Up<br /><br />It's a long time since we had a Catherine Cooked Up adventure and I'm feeling a bit stressed so here goes.<br /><br />In book the first, our trusty heroine strived to fit in at Hardcastle High and defeated Aardvark, the evil MCP robot from the future. <br /><br />In book the second, she discovered that all was not what it seemed in the cosy village of Hardcastle , when she discovered that her Auntie Cataclysm and that nice Mrs Sofa were really British secret agents .<br /><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""episode the first...""><p>It was 4 am and Bridget couldn't sleep. Tomorrow, Dr Sneerpout would  tell them who had won the coveted Hardcastle High Science Trophy and  Bridget wanted so much&nbsp; to be the winner. But how could her pathetic  little robot compete with the Alex H's natural gas powered car or Alex  M's enormous telescope?&nbsp; She'd even heard a rumour that her robot had  claimed that Bridget was his science project...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps a little trip to the kitchen might help ?  Auntie Cataclysm had been baking all week for the PTA Summer Barbecue  and Sabbat . Surely she wouldn't miss a teensy weensy double chocolate  muffin or ten ?&nbsp; Auntie had booby-trapped the kitchen door with semtex  but silly old Auntie had forgotten all about the window . In just a few  minutes, Bridget had improvised a pulley and&nbsp; harness from some ropes  and chains that Cousin Hazard had left in her sock drawer and abseiled  out of her bedroom window and was climbing in through the kitchen  window.</p><p>She was just trying to make up her mind between the  hazelnut and dark chocolate brownies and the muffins when she heard  voices.</p><p>&quot;Does Bridget suspect anything ?&quot; The voice was female and  seemed strangely familiar.</p><p>&quot;i hope not&quot; answered her Aunt. &quot;She  must never know the truth. &quot;</p><p>&quot;Surely she must suspect something? &quot;</p><p>&quot;Teenagers  are very self absorbed. I don't think she's ever noticed how many twins  there are in the village or wondered what happened to Uncle Cataclysm  or Dr Sofa . Why should she think that we have anything to hide? &quot;</p><p>The  other woman started to laugh but was hushed by Aunt Cataclysm. The two  conspirators talked on in whispers but Bridget could only make out a  word here and there. If only she'd thought to bug the cottage with her  Blue Peter Al Qaeda detection kit ! What an opportunity she'd lost .&nbsp;  Absentmindedly, she nibbled at a chocolate brownie. It was darkly  delicious and had an unfamiliar spicy tang .&nbsp; She reached for another  and a strange hand caught her wrist !<br /><br />&quot;Mine ! &quot; hissed Pandora .&nbsp;  <br /><br />&quot;Shhh !&quot; Bridget hissed back . &quot; Auntie will hear you!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not  a chance! &quot; said Pandora coolly ,although she did lower her voice to a  whisper. &quot;Once Mum and Mrs Sofa get going about their glory days , they  wouldn't notice if we danced naked on the dining room table. Anyway, if  they do hear us, I'll burst into tears and say you made me do it. &quot; She  selected the largest hazelnut brownie and nibbled it. <br /><br />Bridget  felt a familiar prickle of irritation. Her pesky cousin was so overdue  for a slapping that her palms itched with the effort of holding back. <br /><br />&quot;What  glory days ?&quot; she demanded . She didn't really care but she had to  distract herself somehow. <br /><br />But Pandora merely arched one eyebrow  and slipped out through the kitchen window leaving a trail of brownie  crumbs behind her. &quot;Don't forget to clear up the evidence , Bridgie &quot;  she called.<br /><br />&quot;Poot&quot; said Bridget . She knew that swearing was  wrong but she had to relieve her feelings somehow until she had a few  leisure moments to play Al Quaida and CIA again with the twins. She  silently thanked Cousin Hazard; all those ropes and chains were jolly  useful when a girl needed to make her own entertainment. Absentmindedly,  she took another brownie -what was that strange spicy taste ? Maybe if  she had another piece, she could work out&nbsp; what it was? She drifted  gently into a chocolate flavoured haze and it was only after some  minutes that she realised that the voices from the sitting room were  getting louder. It sounded as if Auntie and Mrs Sofa had been at the  cooking armagnac again .</p><br />&quot;Sophie, I  really can't stand it any longer.&nbsp; We were only supposed to be  undercover for six months and we've been buried alive in this godawful  hole for sixteen years. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hah ! &quot; said Mrs Sofa. &quot;They wouldn't  do this if we were men. Catch 007 or 008 doing bake sales for the  PTA&nbsp;and baby sitting for sixteen bloody years &quot;<br /><br />&quot;Don't talk to me  about 007 , Soph. Sid I ever tell you how that nasty little pipsqueak  tried to corner me in the filing cabinet at the Christmas party ?&quot;&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Frequently,  darling. Frequently&quot; drawled Mrs Sofa. <br /><br />&quot;I swear, it it wasn't  for the index linked pension, I'd be out of here tomorrow. Even Northern  Ireland was better than the twins! One day I swear I'll swing for that  Pandora .&quot;<br /><br />Bridget hardly knew how to contain her astonishment !  Could it really be that she actually agreed on something with Auntie ?  She reached for a muffin .<br /><br />&quot;We used to be crack agents, Soph. &quot;  continued Auntie .&quot; Remember the Cuba mission? Now the highlight of my  week is spiking the PTA dinner dance punch with LSD . &quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hey,  that was good stuff! &quot; Auntie Sofa drawled. &quot;Little Alex synthesised it  for me at home with his birthday chemistry set. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;And that's  another thing&quot;, moaned Auntie . &quot;You get the genius scientist clones and  I get the jailbait Mata Haris and that overgrown Minnie the Minx.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You  don't seem to be that badly off&nbsp; &quot; Mrs Sofa said tartly . &quot;That field  controller of yours must be clocking up the overtime. &quot;<br /><br />&quot; I can't  help it if Roger has a little crush on me &quot; simpered Auntie . &quot;Anyway,  our romance is part of his cover.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Oh don't make me sick!&quot; spat  Mrs Sofa .&quot;You've been after him since he moved in.&nbsp; You hussy, you! &quot;<br /><br />And  the two women giggled together.<br /><br />Bridget's head was spinning .  She felt as if her head would explode if she heard any more. Was it all  really true ? The twins clones ? Mrs Sofa a secret agent ! And that old  bag Auntie having a sex life ! Ick! No! Auntie must be at least thirty !<br /><br />Suddenly  she felt a little sick and dizzy. Maybe she should retreat to bed with a  few more brownies to keep up her strength? She reached for the plate  but there were no brownies left . <br /><br />&quot;Poot&quot; bridget said to  herself. &quot;Even Auntie's bound to notice. She let herself out of the  window and crept back to her room. </lj-cut><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""For a link to book two episode one ...""></lj-cut><br /><br />Here's episode two :<br /><br />Bridget felt strangely exhiliarated as she climbed back through her bedroom window. She loved adventure and Hardcastle High had seemed far too quiet after the excitement of Madame Lilian's Academy.&nbsp; She chewed thoughtfully on one end of her plait and brushed brownie crumbs off her favourite stripey jumper&nbsp; as she thought about what she had overheard. <br /><br />Maybe if the twins were clones, they weren't her real cousins ? And who could Auntie Cataclysm have possibly been describing as an overgrown Minnie the Minx?<br /><br />She bounced up and down on the bed . She was far too excited to sleep. Maybe the Alexes would be up ? She was sure they'd be pleased to see her -they were always inviting her round to play with their telescopes or look at Uranus and 4am wasn't really that late. <br /><br />Soon Bridget was at Sofa Towers&nbsp; and climbing into the Alexes bedroom window . For some reason, her co-ordination wasn't as good as usual and she tripped over the sill and landed on something soft&nbsp; and warm. The something screamed. <br /><br />&quot;Oh hi, Alex&quot; said Bridget breezily. &quot;Were you asleep?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Bridget ? Am I dreaming ? Oh, Bridget, my sweet rubber clad ninja girl ! , how I've longed for this mo&nbsp; ....ow !..&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; said Bridget in a sweet mendacious tone. &quot;did my foot slip ? &quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

They've sent me a letter explaining why they think I'm in breach of various laws on my roof repairs. I've sent a bland response back to explain that we're not and that the work has been duly certified by the buildings inspector . As usual, the real problem is that Mr Neighbour feels bored and unimportant in retirement .and is dealing with both by throwing his weight around . 

For the sake of a quiet life,&nbsp; The builders and I are answering his points and we've made some alterations to the work . I reckon that he's added about &pound;1400 (20% ) to the cost of the job and it's also meant that I had to spend the first day of my honeymoon working solidly.&nbsp; In the end I actually did 4 or more hours work on four days out of 15 which I'm a bit ashamed about&nbsp; but the other three weren't his fault (or my poor client's) and Roger did have World Cup to watch. 

I think I'm doing the right thing by dealing with everything in writing so that there's a record rather than having a meeting with him . I also want to avoid giving him the oxygen of attention . However, I'm really not sure whether I should just suck up his bad behaviour for the sake of a quiet life or try to deal with it. 

I've noticed that he's nowhere near as rude to me as he is to the builders and nowhere near as rude to my husband as he is to me, so he's clearly capable of modifying his behaviour,but I'm not sure how to persuade him to do it."

"event","Just a few days of honeymoon left and it's time to go home and find out if we have a roof again and whether the three little fur balls of doom have left anything alive in the back garden. 

Yesterday, we went to find the mediaeval wine cellar beneath Buda Castle for our Tokay tasting. The entrance is in the Hilton Hotel shopping mall between the Marzipan Museum (exactly what it sounds like and clearly devised by someone on far better drugs than I will ever get) and an art exhibition. There are twisty passages, there are stairs. Every so often, there is a tasteful display of grapes,bottles or posters to encourage you to venture on . There are more stairs,more twisty passages ,more bottles (empty),more grapes (plastic) .It is not clear whether we are playing Dungeons and Dragons or the Hungarian version of Mornington Crescent. 

Just as you begin to wonder if returning to the smoky sports bar of the Hilton would be a good idea, you are greeted by a strange man who seems extremely pleased to see you. After a while, you realise that this is the manager of the Faust wine bar and he is indeed extremely pleased to see you because he has been down there on his own for hours with nothing except a cellar full of wine for company. 

Hungary is full of strange grapes and grapes which sound familiar but taste completely different, such as Italian Riesling which apparently isn't Riesling and has nothing to do with Italy. 

Traditionally , Tokay is a sweet and rounded dessert wine made in the Tokay region with the Furmint grape ,but nowadays dry Tokays are made -the nearest thing is probably a very light Fino -they're fun to drink on their own and even nicer with a little goose liver pate or some ewe cheese gnocchi&nbsp; . 

Faust has about 80 wines for tasting by the glass as well as palinkas , which are a local fruit brandy which remind me of Terry Pratchett's phrase about drinks which should be called &quot;Say goodbye, Mr Brain&quot;. We managed a respectable seven Tokay tastings between us before heading back to the hotel for crispy duck with savoury strudel, but are going back to do a longer structured tasting on Saturday ."

The weather is extreme here. When we arrived, the Danube had flooded the streets which run along the river banks (the equivalent of Victoria Embankment  in London) and the locals were out taking pictures of parking and traffic signs which only just stuck out above the water. The river buses had been grounded because their quays were underwater and the staff on the boat restaurants were enjoying an extra holiday. 

Today, it's over 34 C in town again and the river is almost back to normal . It's too hot to be a tourist except in fits and starts. In fact it's so hot that the poshest pavement cafes have got portable air conditioning units outside. The zoo has outside sprinklers for visitors to walk through to stay cool and all the locals have Gone to the Pools , which probably won't do them much good as almost all are thermal . 

The coolest place in town is the lovely cathedral of St Stephen,with it's marble walls and high vaulted ceilings. Tomorrow we plan to take refuge in the mediaeval wine cellar several stories below the Hilton Hotel where we will be forced to work our way though a Tokay tasting to justify our presence... 

Up in the hills, it's a little cooler and we have breezes to cool us down. Litres of home made lemonade and the largest ice coffees I've ever seen don't hurt either."

"event","I've just finished reading &quot;Cruel World&quot; by Lynn Nicholas, an account of the treatment of children in the second world war and it's aftermath.

This is an ambitious and beautifully written book . Nicholas does not just cover the familiar ground of the mass murder of Jewish and Roma children , but also the cruel treatment of German children by the Nazi regime and the fate of stateless children after the war . It's clear from the book just how far the Nazi regime went in trying to use children as if they were state property . 

Nicholas also documents the failures of the Nazi regime to put its policies into practice and contradicts the received wisdom that the German population simply went along with whatever the Nazi regime wanted and that no one protested against the sterilisation of &quot;defective&quot; children or the concentration camps . 

Nicholas has also collected testimony from survivors including Hitler Youth activists, Jewish refugees and a Nazi female youth leader, who recount their experiences. 

Some of the material is familiar (at least to me) from family accounts but much is new to me and contradicts what I thought I did know.&nbsp; 

Nicholas has also won an award for her book &quot;The Rape of Europa&quot; on the fate of art treasures during and after the second world war ."

"event","Now that I've begun to get over the shame of being a citizen of illegal oil war Britain, it's time for me to start to wince about being Jewish after someone thought it was a bright idea to make a commando raid on an aid convoy in international waters while 3 German MPs and a former Nobel prize winner were on board.  

An Israeli government spokesman has alleged that weapons were found on board the lead ship but I'm not sure how plausible this is. There have been incidents of charities being used as fronts for gun running and the Israelis have made allegations about IHH before, but the flotilla was a coalition event&nbsp; and the charities seem on the large and respectable side for this -it's usually fairly small and obscure ones that are used. 

More to the point, if there were say, guns on board, why weren't they used to fight off the commandoes?"

Fallacy number 1 Hugging is transitive.

The situation - you're in the convention bar on Saturday night and see your friend Dave hugging an attractive Goth stranger. You wander over and greet both Dave and the stranger with a hug. A few minutes later the Goth offers to go to the bar for fresh drinks and does not return. Dave seems to be less pleased to see you than normal.

Amazing though it may seem, if you are a friend of fan B who is hugging fan C it does not mean that it's ok for you to hug fan C or that because fan C is hugging fan B that C wants to hug all B's friends.

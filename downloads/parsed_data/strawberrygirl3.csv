Had the five hour went to taco bell britt game over tim picked us up and we saw secret window. Then they came back to my house for a bit. Played American Idol. Yeah I know so what else is new?? Tired. Have to do my english narrative tomorrow. Tomorrow. Soccer game. Have to find a way to get home. Why does mom and dad bowling always have to interfer with the time??? I had having to find rides home. Anyways. Not that it seems like much but only have to go to school for 4 days this week. And I have an easy week because only have to babysit once during the week and have no math tutoring (even though I REALLY need it). Oh well. The weekends seem to go by too fast and the week too slow. Wish it was the opposite. Maybe write more later..."

"event","Honestly don't think I passed the pre calc test. And the health was mostly common sense except for the few that you actually needed to know what a vocab word meant and I had no idea. But the entire time I was just like just get through it because tomorrow is Friday and it's Becky's birthday and then we're going out and I can forget about this entire day!!

Babysitting last night was fine. At least I'm making money. Some of the kids are cute. But anyways. Today probably going to the movies with Becky and Brittany. Then sleepover at Becky's. Then tomorrow going out to dinner (maybe) and bowling. Ugh. Sunday soccer game at 5:55. I'll just have to drive fast to get home in time for the Superbowl. Except I can't make it next week unless it's an early game. 

I really want to go away for February break. I don't care where I just wanna go!! Maybe I'll take a trip to Warners aka Britt's cow-land. The only good thing being out there for the week would be 1) no one could find me or 2)if they did they wouldn't have the energy to go out there!!!"

So tomorrow is busy... 8-10 review session, 1015 test, 1230 test, 240 lesson, and 330 babysit. 

Today I truly found out that it doesn't matter if your 16 or 66, there is always going to be ""clicks."" That's just because I went to work with my mom and some people just don't get along! But my mom said something I probably won't ever forget. She said yeah you'll always have those in life but the real test is if you have tough enough skin to not care about it at all."

Math is like trying to kill me in every way possible. But I'm glad it's vacation time and hopefully Christmas vacation will come VERY VERY fast. I have a million things to do between then and now but at least I have that to look forward to. 

I can't believe tomorrow is Thanksgiving. It really doesn't feel like it at all. As much as I don't love snow I kinda wish it was here. It doesn't really feel like the holiday season without snow!

I love driving around with Dave. I don't really care about getting my liscense now. Except for that fact that we have different tastes in music but that's ok. He's driving so I usually get to pick whatever. 

I'm so tired and I slept a lot last night. I think sometimes when you just lounge you get tired. But I babysat today and ran errands and everything. I tried to read Scarlett Letter for English and it was so boring so I put it down. I think the book sounds good but the way it's written it's hard to understand.... 

I'm going now because I'm so tired. Maybe more later"

Maybe next weekend cause I sure wouldn't want to get sick. But instead. Me Becky Liz and Britt went to Friendly's and had so much fun. We were so loud but hardly anyone was there anyways. And then we went back to Becky's and watched Sweet Home Alabama. When I first woke up this morning I thought I had to get ready for school but then I was wicked pumped when I remembered it was Saturday morning!!! My report card was awesome. Today though. I'm cleaning... sucks. But tomorrow I'm going to soccer and I'm really excited about that. I wish the weekend wouldn't end because I really don't feel like doing my homework or cleaning or anything. Oh well. I had a really good day on Friday other than my mom getting all pissed at me. I love being in a good mood!!!"

"event","Well. Last night my original plan was sitting home..actually trying to con my mom into taking me to Barnes and Noble. But I went to dinner with Mike and Becky. It was fun. Went to Tully's. We were seated in the bar section and some of the teachers from WGMS were there... It was weird seeing your old teachers having a few drinks together. Anyways. After that we walked to Wal*Mart. We looked at all the Halloween stuff. I really need a costume. But this cute little girl started talking to me about a pumpkin carver kit. I was like wow now they actually make kits and she's like yeah we bought one last year it works great. I swear she was like 5. AWWW. She was the cutest! And I bought a couple of CD's I was quite pumped about that. THen we came back to my house and watched the movie the hot chick or whatever it's called. It was funny/stupid/weird. Oh well. It was fun.

Today. I drove this morning and mowed the lawn and cleaned my room and watched the SU game and I'll watch the baseball game tonight. I have to do my homework too because tomorrow is finally the CARMELLO ANTHONY game!!!!!!I've only been looking forward to this for ohhh about 2-3 months! Except I have to write a rough draft for my English paper.. darn. 

Today there were these really nice people from some church around here and they were raking everyone's leaves. It was so nice. They didn't take any donations or anything. AW. I just thought it was cute.

"event","Sometimes I wish I could just sit here and type every single bad thing I could ever say. But then I'd feel guilty and terrible. Sometimes I wish I could just sit here and say exactly what is on my mind. But what fun is it to read a journal that is all down and makes you feel down. Maybe I wish I could write a journal that people read and are like wow I know exactly what she means/how she feels/ what she is talking about. 

I gotta call Becky soon. It sucks when you feel distant from your friends. I mean. Honestly. I've babysat last night because I want to make lots of money for NYC. I'm really happy that I've got things to look forward to for the next month or so. It makes the week go by quicker and makes you keep working hard because you know something good is coming your way. 

My journal doesn't really have a point today. I'm just sitting and writing and writing. It helps. However. I wish I had my liscense and a car so I could drive around for a while and go do whatever I want. I'm hoping to go to the movies tomorrow. I really want to see Runaway Jury. I have to do my homework today though because I'm not going to be a procrastinator like I am every other day and save my homework for the lastest possible chance. 

I've felt so tired lately. I am going to bed at like 10 every night and waking up at 9ish. I getting up every morning before the sun even comes up. I just hate that. That's one thing I hate about fall/winter. 

I have this english ""project"" but in reality it takes the place of a research paper. I really don't want to do it. I'm sick of having project and looking things up and writing essays. I love writing but I can't stand writing essays about narritive elements and style and all that. I HATE IT! I hate having to take all my notes and making them sound very informative and formal. I want to write something creative. Something fun. Something that I WANT TO WRITE!!! I don't mind reading the novels we have to read this year but I hate papers that take an eternity. Except I'm doing really well so far this year. I almost wish the 1st marking period was over because my grades are so good. (at least what I know of so far). 

On Friday I cleaned like I've never cleaned before. Except I really felt accomplished when I was done. It was like wow I just did something out of my own will rather than having my parents nag me about it. I felt helpful!!!

Saturday was FINALLY the last day of the PSAT/SAT prep class. I hate getting up that early on Saturday mornings and having to go to school and sit there and learn! Curses. Learn in school. 

Hopefully I'll feel accomplished by the end of the day!! Then I should go start now!!"

Saturday I had that PSAT/SAT prep class. It's so boring and tiring but at least I'm going. And I slept over at Becky's house. It was a ton of fun. And I brought Tostitos lime chips and I LOVE THEM!!! They are so fricken good. I felt bad because I um had a little break down while I was there. At first I was like well no one is going to ask me what's wrong. But then again I was like giving myself a pity party so I was glad I didn't have to explain myself. But Becky called me tonight and we talked... at least she cares! I wish she didn't have to go away this weekend!!! I wanted her to go with me on Friday!!! oh well. My dad and I will do something fun this weekend. lol. My dad. I love him. Well. Not when he yells at me to clean my room but oh well. So I hardly got any sleep last night at Becky's so I'm dead tired now.

We watched Chicago... I love that movie. Obviously I've seen it before and if you've never seen it then why are you still reading my journal?? Ahh. I love the jail scene when they all sing their songs. they had it comin. ahh it's great. and of course razzle dazzle and all that jazz. damnit. i wish i could sing. 

Mr. Cellophane
Amos
If someone stood up in a crowd 
And raised his voice up way out loud 
And waved his arm and shook his leg 
You'd notice him 
If someone in the movie show 
Yelled ""Fire in the second row 
This whole place is a powder keg!"" 
You'd notice him 


And even without clucking like a hen 
Everyone gets noticed, now and then, 
Unless, of course, that personage should be 
Invisible, inconsequential me! 


Cellophane 
Mister Cellophane 
Shoulda been my name 
Mister Cellophane 
'Cause you can look right through me 
Walk right by me 
And never know I'm there... 


I tell ya 
Cellophane 
Mister Cellophane 
Shoulda been my name 
Mister Cellophane 
'Cause you can look right through me 
Walk right by me 
And never know I'm there... 


Suppose you was a little cat 
Residin' in a person's flat 
Who fed you fish and scratched your ears? 
You'd notice him 


Suppose you was a woman, wed 
And sleepin' in a double bed 
Beside one man, for seven years 
You'd notice him 


A human being's made of more than air 
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there 
Unless that human bein' next to you 
Is unimpressive, undistinguished 
You know who... 


Cellophane 
Mister Cellophane 
Shoulda been my name 
Mister Cellophane 
'Cause you can look right through me 
Walk right by me 
And never know I'm there... 
I tell ya 
Cellophane 
Mister Cellophane 
Shoulda been my name 
Mister Cellophane 
'Cause you can look right through me 
Walk right by me 
And never know I'm there 
Never even know I'm there


Hope I didn't take up too much of your time

I was feeling really crappy at the beginning of the school year and now things aren't really that bad. But for some reason I am feeling that crappiness again. UGhh. I hate writing like that. Makes me sound like everyone else who's unhappy in this world. Because I know that the LAST thing I am is unhappy. I've got a really busy weekend but I'm looking forward to it. I can't wait for November!!! I want to go to NYC soooo bad!!!! I'm saving like crazy for the trip. I am hoping my mom and I can go in October too. I haven't been there in like 5 years and I miss it!! 

I've been thinking about college a lot. I can't wait! Well. I like high school. It's fun always knowing that you're friends are close so you can talk to them whenever... (britt who lives out in timbuktu is the only exception) but I think I've learned a lot of ""stuff"" already and obviously I know there is more before it's over but hey two years are already up and we're already half way there. I'm applying to like every school out of state... I think. I'm thinking everywhere. Mostly south.. Florida, NC, Virginia, Maryland, possibly a couple in NY. And I'm thinking maybe a few in Michigan too. My dad went to a college somewhere in Michigan.. I think and he told me some of the campus's up there are nice. Of course I want to go on vacations so school visits would just make everything awesome. Spend some time in Florida.. can't beat that!!! 

I guess I really don't know what else to write. I feel really tired all of the sudden but I'm watching One Tree Hill again tonight. UGHH I love that show!!! I watch the WB like 24-7. Anyways. Adios."

Mrs. Kincaid said it was supposed to be much harder than course III and everyone knows that was hard enough for me. Just gotta keep up everything. Today I was so back and forth. The teachers would go on and on and I would think this is so pointless who cares. then i would think i gotta study gotta get good grades. then i'd go back to oh i'm going to fail then no i gotta try really hard. it's never ending battle in my brain. i feel alone. i feel like i need someone to talk to and be able to run and say everything i'm thinking. i'm happy but something inside me makes me think wow steph wow. not sure if it's a good or a bad. just wow.

Words and Music by B.Bryant/House of Bryant (BMI); Stuart, 
Metcalf Noble/Rogers Music Ltd. CBS Unart Catalog (BMI)

When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you 
All I have to do
Is Dream... Dream Dream Dream

When I feel blue
In the night 
When I need you
To hold me tight
Whenever I want you
All I have to do 
Is Dream... Dream Dream Dream

Of trees 
Swayin' in the summer breeze
Showin' off the silver leaves
As we waltz by
Soft kisses on a summers day
Laughin' all our cares away
Just you and I

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Any time, night or day
Only trouble is
Gee Whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

Oh I need you so
That I could die
I love you so 
And that is why 
Whenever I want you
All I have to do 
Is Dream... Dream Dream Dream
Dream

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Any time, night or day
Only trouble is
Gee Whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

And when the rain
Beats against my window pane
I think of summer days again
And Dream of you
And Dream of you
And Dream of you
And Dream of you
(Mr Sandman, send me a dream)
And Dream of you
(Mr Sandman, send me a dream)
And Dream of you
(Mr Sandman, send me a dream)





First Wives Club 
You Don't Own Me 

You don't own me,
I'm not just one of your many toys.
You don't own me,
Don't say I can't go with any boys.

Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Paaaaa,
And don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
And when I go out with you, don't put me on display.
(Pretty good),(I'm inpressed)

You don't own me,
Don't try to change me in anyway
You don't own me,
Don't drag me down caues I'll never stay

I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell yo what to do
So just let me be myself,
Thats all I ask of you.

I'm young(I'm young)
And I love to be young
I'm free(I'free)
And I love to be free
To live my life the way that I want
To say and do whatever I want
2X

No no,
You don't own me

Yesterday I went to my mom's friends and hung out with them. It was fun. They have 3 kids and then my mom's other friend had two kids that stayed there. we played cards and i swam and watched tv. and then we started planning our trip to NYC in November. I can't wait!! I really wanna go to NYC because I haven't been there in so long. 

Saturday I had to babysit from 7-10:30 then went to the mall and saw Jason Vs Freddy. Then I went to Mark's. It was fun. I haven't seen everyone all summer long.. plus I almost made Jared light on fire. Missy and I just cracked up the whole time. It was pretty funny. It was kinda weird going without Britt though. I had to go by myself and leave by myself... but I sitll had fun with everyone. Too bad my camera didn't have a flash. lol. 

Right now I should probably be reading seeing how I'm still on book 1/4. Or I should clean my room because I can't see the floor.... or maybe I should just be anywhere but here. 

I can't wait for the fair!!! My family hates the fair... but I'll get someone to go with me at some point. I have two an a half weeks to cram a lot. Reading with journals back to school supply shopping trip to the mall to buy some stuff get a hair cut. It's going to be a crazy end of the summer. But I guess I'm up for the challenge......."

Plus my brother is sleeping now and the last thing I want to get yelled at for is waking him up by the typing noise. He's definatly yelled at me before because of that.

Anyways. Wednesday. Dave and I just spent the day at Katie's. I was at her house until 8. We just sat on the front step and talked for a while. Whoever thought of people being so mean and firing the good people when there are plenty of mean rotten people to fire. Mrs. G told me I was really lucky my dad found a job back in Syracuse. I am lucky. And I'm fortunate. And I'm grateful. And it sucks that people have to move. And it sucks that people have to go through all this crap when they've done nothing. Mrs. G is one of the nicest people in the world. She makes THE BEST lemonade cookies!!! She made them for my birthday this year. I'll miss her a lot. I hate change and I hate good-bye. I'm just lucky it is not me. 

Britt is away this weekend. I gotta babysit tomorrow. School starts Too soon and I've done nothing yet. 

This entry sounds so.... not happy. But that doesn't mean good things aren't happening. Last night I went down to the Fin's and we played cards. Everyone played. And then we made smores and sat by the fire!!! And today we're going to the movies. I went to Friendly's the other day.. ew.... my drink was grose. I can't even write about it it makes me want to throw up. Anyways. I'll just have to write more later."

(As recorded by Eric Carmen)
ERIC CARMEN

When I was young, I never needed anyone
And makin' love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Livin' alone, I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone, nobody's home.

All by myself, don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
All by myself, don't wanna live
All by myself anymore.

Hard to be sure, sometimes I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure.

All by myself, don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
All by myself, don't wanna live
All by myself anymore.

I gotta talk to quick cause I gotta watch this movie but ya know. I'm jealous. I swear. Everyone I've ever known in my life I am jealous of! I hate that. It's one of the flaws that I have. I mean.

I really have nothing to write about. Having no car that works and my dad has one in Albany pretty much leaves me walking to do some errands and then being too tired to walk anywhere else. I need a car. It's kind of sad that I have to have a car to live in this town of Camillus where everything isn't THAT far away. But I'm lazy!!


I need to run. I tried to but my brother told me to stop b/c the treadmill was too loud to have him watch tv. And of course I was pissed and I would've said something to him but of course mommy was in the room. 

Ok. I guess I'm done. I shouldn't be so hard on myself but I can't help it!! I mean obviously I'll never be skinny skinny but I just hate that everywhere you look there are skinny people!! And it's kind of hard to explain. But sometimes it's just hard NOT to be hard on myself when I look around...."

I obviously was pumped about that. Hm. Then I've just been sitting home and watching TV> John is coming home tomorrow! I can't believe it. I dunno. Miss him. A little. But I love having everything to myself. And I love the fact how food and drinks last in this house when he's not home eating all of it! 

Hopefully I'll be able to do something with Britt Saturday night. Go to one of our houses and watch the end of the Melissa Joan Hart wedding. :-D What can we say.... I used to love being a little kid and watching Clarissa or TGIF. WOO. I used to look forward to Friday nights in front of the TV.To be a little kid again with nothing to worry about.... Oh well. I love fall of school. I just LOVE IT. Not that I'm rushing but seriously. The getting back into it. Everyone is relaxed hardly any hw. Friday night football games with doing something after. I don't mind it at all. Soon enough. Just gotta do so much now though! I still have a lot to do and summer is almost... hm"

Babysitting was just wonderful yesterday and today. And I also found out that this next week I don't have to get up at 7 to babysit on Wednesday!!! Yes two weeks off!!! Too bad the girl hates me to begin with. I didn't think a little kid could hate me but she definitely proved that wrong. It's not like I'm that much of a hate-able person am I???? 

Yesterday was a week till August! I haven't done anything!!!! :-0  I'll get it done no prob. Um... not much else to write about. Maybe I'll buy myself something at the mall tomorrow... or maybe I should just save my money and buy myself something useful.... something to ponder on."

Didn't do anything else today. Had a piano lesson. Went out to dinner with the fam (excluding John). I hate rain. And yet. That's all it is supposed to do all week long! 

I need to run but I'm wicked full and so I probably wouldn't benifit right now. My brother is bugging me to get on a website! Except I have to say he has been nicer lately.

"event","So Worked at VBS today. It was ok. I got to be in a musical instrument band and that was probably the highlight of my day...

I was so down today. I was tired and hungry and just felt all around shitty. So I slept. I got into bed at 3:30 and didn't get out for a couple of hours. I just kept thinking. I thought about people who have changed and how mad they can make me. It's not like I should even care but sometimes I guess I just expected people to not be like they are. But then again I got to thinking.... if I compare myself to three years ago or whatever I'm not the same person either. Who the hell am I really??? Obviously everyone has crappy days and today was one of mine. I feel bad for writing about it in my journal because if people read it it's not like they don't have problems of their own. But then again they can read it. Sorry. 

I feel bad in a way because I'm being wicked bitchy and mean to my parents. They didn't really do anything except annoy me with 80 questions. I hate it when you get home and they just ask you every question possible. And I dunno. I'm just not in a good mood.

But tonight I went to Barnes and Noble because I really need to start English at some point this summer. Four books might take a while. So anyways I was walking out when there was a whole thing for Harry Potter... did I not see a fricken Harry Potter book translated into fricken Latin!!!! I was like OMG. I am proud to say I actually knew a few words but it was like who would take the time to read this???? I wonder if magistra has read it yet.... too bad I wasn't taking that class again. I would buy it and have her spend a week reading it in class so I wouldn't have to do anything. Darn.

More churchy stuff this week and hopefully doing something with my fav britt when she actually has off work."

But the water was nice and it was really hot out. Then I went to the baseball game out at Gillette. Britt came too and we pretty much just joked about stuff the whole time. I mean obviously we watched the game but we just made fun of each other or laughed about things.... Tim's dad was being really nice to us. He was like poking me in the back and I didn't know who it was and I just looked at britt and started asking WHO IS IT WHO IS IT she just laughed and was like it's not me. haha. Oh man. It was wayy too great but then again it's one of those ""you had to be there"" kind of things. But Mr. Daniluk is really nice. Tomorrow starts VBS. Pumped. Not really. But it should be ok. Hm.

My dad came home from Albany today. He looked tired. And sad. It makes me nervous. I was afraid he had bad news or something.... but nothing yet. Then again I haven't been home long enough for him to say two words to me. I still hate it. Makes me nervous. Makes me feel scared. Maybe he really is tired and everything. I just hate those looks. I mean. It seemed like the way his face was he was going to burst out crying or something. I hate that. I hate that so much. It makes me feel like I have to not ignore him but just not have dinner at the table to make sure no conversations take place that anything about the capital of NY would be mentioned. I really don't like it there. I've been there once. Maybe I've never given it a chance really. It just gives me a bad feeling.

I went to Tim and Dave's baseball game out in Fabious Pompeii or wherever. They lost. But it was a good game. And I'm probably going to their game Sunday night. Brittany thinks that one of the reasons why I even live anymore is just to attend people's games. But why shouldn't I?? I'd sit home if I didn't go anyways. 

I gotta babysit tomorrow at 9. It seems like everytime I update I always have something to say about babysitting. At least it's only two hours and I get paid. Can't complain about that. 

For VBS next week they want us all to dress up... I don't think I'll participate in that. It's something to do with Construction and they want us to wear jeans/overalls/work boots/helmets. Sorry. But I'm not that into it.

I gotta get up and be at babysitting AT 7:30 tomorrow morning... I'm not happy about that. I'm tired now but when I get upstairs I probably won't be able to fall asleep. I was sooo tired last night and I didn't fall asleep for like two hours. I hate that.

Then we went jewelry shopping and it was even better. 

People confuse me. And make me mad. I mean obviously there are some people, and they would know who they are, that make life that much more meaningful. But I just hate how people say something and go around and do the other.

It would've been ok if i had sneakers on but um... nope. Played horse shoe things. Sat by the bonfire. Talked. Sat. I dunno. It was just a lot of fun and I'm really glad I went and just everyhing.

Kate's spending the weekend with me. It should definatly be fun. Maybe we'll invite dave over and watch some movies and just hang out and what not. I gotta clean my room though because we can sleep where it's nice and air conditioned. Go swimming. Go the the grad party. what not. 

Yesterday I went to the movie store whatever it's called Video King to rent a movie (obv) and my brother and his friend wanted some video game and there were like no joke 8 year olds who wanted to rent the movie Old School. Like hello. You're fricken 8 years old you're supposed to be watching like Disney movies or something!! Well the mom was like yeah ok. You can get it. I'm like are you kidding me??? She had probably like 6 of them with her and probably one of them was her kid. Ok. If it was my 8 year old watching Old School at a sleep over I would be like freaking screaming my head off at whoever let them watch it. Well. Not really to that extent but I would be pretty upset because come on it's obviously not a movie and 8 year old should be watching. But then again that's our world for you today. Even the lady at the front desk was like are you sure about this movie???? People... lol but seriously it was dumb.

I need some food so I'll be going now. Have a nice day..."

"event","So I got up to babysit this morning at 7 to babysit at 7:30 but then her plans got canceled because it rained so I went over at 8:30 and got home around 12. Not really sure what's going on today. Visiting Kate probably maybe out maybe not. whatever the day brings. I'm quite bored at the moment. Just relaxing which isn't bad just sometimes can get boring. I've already watched Goldmember about 5 times in the past 3 days. I'm hungry but too lazy to get up and make myself something. Maybe I'll get back to cleaning the room. It's like you start cleaning it gets messier than before then I work on it for a little while like 2 days and I haven't touched it again. I guess it's better than sitting on my butt though. Well. It seems like summer has just begun and then again it's already July... Maybe I should go do something productive that will take my mind off of things."

"event","Not that today was bad. It was ok. I went to my lesson which wasn't bad but my teacher has had soooo much to do lately I feel bad for her. She's the nicest person in the world and I feel like I should do something nice for her. But then we started talking about the g's and made me unhappy. I was going to go to Britt's softball game today but I ended up not... I think that was the right choice. I got to babysit at 7:30 tomorrow morning. That's 100% too early for me but the kid is very cute and I don't mind that much. Katie is coming home tomorrow for a little while so maybe I'll see her and then maybe if joelle and britt can do something then we shall paint the town... if everyone can that is. I'm not really in the mood for writing. bye"

I get home from school and i talk to chandal a littl bit, n she says she's sick n she's gun go lay down, i end up taking a nap.  Then i wake up n call chandal but noones home, and i have a message saying that she went out w/ shawna and nori.  I left her a couple messages b/ i was really depressed.  I called her around 11 and she answered saying she just got home, and nori had to use the phone.  I asked her to check her messages and call me back right after nori is done, she says she will.  I calll back about 30-45 min. later, and i could tell she had no intentions of calling me back. i rudely ask y she didn't call and y she didn't read her messages. then we argue about it.  I dont remember everything, but later on, as i'm crying into the phone, she's asking me whats wrong and i told her i didn't know and asked y i couldn't just be depressed.  She later asks, Do you want me to talk about how much i want to give you head, since there are two girls in here, b/c thats he only way i know to make u happy.  I then start to cry a lil harder but she doesn't notice..after bugging me again with why i'm sad, i say it's sad when the girl your in love with only knows one way to make u happy, and thats with sex.  she flips out on me, cusses at me and yells at me. she ends up getting off the phone with me as i'm crying into the phone. (earlier on i said i needed her and she said she would stay home and be with me tonight, to make me happier) I leave a message on her cell phone saying i didn't understand y she did what she did...then i call her dorm phone...nori (her roommate) says she left and she should be back in 10 minutes..i couldnt breathe, i didn't even say bye, i just dropped the phone. I laid there, really crying, crying harder than i ever have before, i havn't really cried since i was a baby.  I laid in the bed pleading with God to pick me up and save me, pleading him to tell me what i did to deserve this amount of pain, asking him what i did to her to deserve it. I wanted to die, I want to die. I didn't understand how she said she'd always be there for me, and then leave to go get fucking drunk.  How can you say you care about someone, and love someone, but then when they r crying their eyes out, your laughing and drinking w/ friends.  How can you fucking leave someone you care and love for like that. HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU DO THAT TO SOMEONE YOU ""LOVE"" AND ""CARE ABOUT""??  I don't understand what the fuck i did. She always yelled at me for never telling her what was wrong with me..and then i tell her and she leaves me like this, wanting to die..and her not giving a FUCK. how...how can you do this to me chandal...how??  I write this all in my journal terrified...terrified that even though i hate what you did to me, i love you, and i don't want to lose u.  And i know if you read this, you will think about leaving me, b/c i know if i said all of this to ur face, or on the phone your response would be ""click"", I guess that would give me a sense of dejavu...since that's all i heard last time I told you my feelings. *click*"

"event","This is a public service anouncement..Hello, hello. Trey is back, and has now decided to begin updating his ""LJ"" once again. If you have a problem with it, He would like you to know, You can suck Regis Philbin's fat, old, wrinkled penis.

Hey everybody, it's me, Trey, how's it been. wow, it's been a loooong time..i'm expecting a lot of comments welcoming me back, but anyway...
how's it been everyone? everything is good over here..i started school again i like all of my classes so everything is cool. I'm tryin to get myself on Ritalin though, but yea anyway relationship wise..everything is great not perfect, but great as close to perfect as it can be w/out being perfect i gots my perfect baby, chandal, but we are going out (bf n gf) we are just dating exclusively. but i love her like crazy she left me n went to college though, however next weekend i'm taking the bus down to go see my baby. it'll be cool her roomate will be gone so we can f- in her bed :) :) :) just kidding!! anyway i feel weird writing in my journal again. it's kinda..refreshing..anyway i love chandal she's crazy perfect..she's crazy smart, she's funnnnnny, she's cute, she's sexXxy as hell, she's weird in a good way, and she's not a prep (no offense to any preps out there) but wow she's amazing..but anyway we gotta stop talking about her, b4 i have to go n masterbate..Oh.. Jed told me a sad story the other night..this girl we know bianca, her grandma is the head of some adoption angency type crap..and the Parents of the Year adopted a little black girl,9, apparently these..""Parents of the Year"" were in the Klan..they sacrificed the little girl.. and another family liked their adopted child better than their real son..so they locked their real son in a cage, and threw him in the pool, drowning him.  So then on the way home we were talking about how fucked up people are and what we should do to stop people from doing weird shit like that..oh yeah this dumbass, Jed, we had to get to his house b4 1130 so he could see if he could stay out longer n stay at my house, so we r driving around on these country roads i told him to whip it around the next corner (tit was a u-turn, not a curve..and he f'n knew it) so he turns at about 60, and we f-in went on two wheels in his SUV and he swirved the other way so we went from being on only the right wheels to only being on the left wheels..but we made it successfully. before all that we had gone into springifled, chiled at the mall saw a movie, f-d around in walmart and rented two dvds from the video store..so that was my saturday night(and of course i talked to my baby chandal..but we fought :(, so i left it out)..sunday i wake up n i had to go with my mom to my aunts and set up her computer /c she just moved into a new house and didn't have it set up yet so anyway after i ate there i had to watch the little kids, and then i went home and talked to my baby chandal..and then at about 130 or 2 mike calls me from a-yo and e-yo's house and wanted me to come out and play football, so i went out there n played a big football game and afterwards we played a quick game of bball...then me and e-yo raced mike and bryant home.. umm then i talked to my baby and she took care of me and sang to me when i was sick :) i love her so much.. i crazy amounts of love my baby chandal, but then we got of the phone and i dreamt about her..not even seeing her, or f-in her, just of talking to her, i woke up around 8 and i claled her and talked to her for a bit n then i realized wow i'm not gunna be able to sleep at all, so then i let chandal off the phone at 920..n she said i could call back in 20..so i did and then we talked until she went to bed..but then my baby called me back not being able to sleep, n i told her to sleep again n if she wasn't asleep in 20 to call me n i'd call her back so she did, i was crazy happy that she couldn't sleep i know that's bad, but i missed her n i wanted to talk to her, so anyway we took some weird quizes n then her roomate went to bed so then we talked for awhile longer n then she ended up going to bed too..after awhile i got online n now here i am..writing in my ""LJ"" for the first time..in a long time. i think i need to work how my writing..most particularly, punctuation and capitalization. but anyway that was my weekend, i'm going to force myself to atleast write once a week, the only problem is the best time for me to write is when i can't sleep, like now, but i don't wanna do this all the time and always be slepy in school, but anyway it's time to end this entry i'll update sometime next week, 1"

"event","i woke up around 9..called kylie and talked to her, around about 930-10, jed came over and we played video games and talked to kylie on the phone, n then at like 1245 jed left and i tried to take a shower while i was still on the phone w/ kylie (i did it!) n then around...1 or 130 CHANDAL!!! came over and picked me up (chandal is my bestest bud in the world) anyway we went to springfield to the mall, checked out girls together and argued if they were hott or not, then she tried to make me admitt some guys were hott, she thinks guys know if eachother r hott or not, then we saw a bunch of my friends from p-burg, they never met chandal so i introduced them..they thought it was my new gf, they were like got damn trey, where'd u hook up w/ her at..she got any hott friends!?, then i told them she was just my friend and they were going to try but i told them how she would never date someone younger than her, unless it was me!! haha lucky t-rey, but me n her would never go out cuz we r too good of friends! anyway then we went to someplace n looked at bb rings/a new nose ring for her, cuz i didn't like the one she had in, it was too big so we got a couple bb rings and a smaller nose ring for her (she was looking realllllly fucking good), anyway i saw this self piercing kit shit n i was gun get it so kylie could finally get her tounge and bb pierced, but we went to look at tupac shirts, n i forgot all about it, so then we spent about an hour to an hour and a half trying to find the new taco bell that opened, we had like 5 of them, but they all closed down, and one just opened up tuesday.  so atfer we finally found it, chandal went to the bathroom, came out n yelled at me b/c i didn't look at her boobs, she had some black stain on her boobs and i never noticed it, so she went and changed shirts, then we finally ordered and we had to wait fucking 30 min for our food, b/c about 100 people were inside/in the drive-in (taco bell rules), when we were sitting down and eating this baby next to me kept trying to feed me her taco..n then she kept giving me napkins, its was kool/funny, so then after we ate we tried to get out of the parking lot that took awhile..then we just cruised around laughing n shit, trying to figure out how to get back to where we could find our way home...we were lost about 85% of the time, it was great though n we got home around 7. it was awesome spending time w/ her cuz i hadn't seen her since january, b/c she graduated early and moved to another town (i duno where it is) so then this was our first time being together since then. it was cool too, so when i got home i called kylie n talked to her for about a minute n then i told her i'd call her back later..i still need to do that..n then i got online talked to sam for a couple seconds, put her on hold n came to write in my journal, since i always seem to forget to do..wow holy shit i just hit the back button on accident, luckily when i hit forward all my text was still here, other wise i would have just said fuck it and i wouldn't have wrote! anyway, did i mention i didn't have school today? yea..i didn't have school today. so from looking at my gf's website everyone thinks she's a preppy airhead or something, i think sam said she seemed kinda boring or something liek that (maybe it wasn't sam) and ashley said she looked like a stupid prep, and chandal said she thought that kylie sounded full of herself n thought she was the hottest thing ever..i understand where they r comming from, but that's just her homepage she's nothing like that when i talk to her, she's funny n sweet n nice, she's smarter than most people think, i just love everything about her. i wanted her to come w/ me and chandal so they could meet eachother, but her mom said she had to stay and spend time w/ her stupid lil sister, gay! hey if anyone is ever bored and wants to do me a favor..u could look up information about Alex Haley's (ROOTS: The Saga of an American Family) plagiarism of Harold Courlander's book ""The African"", b/c i was doing a book report on ROOTS, and i noticed the plagiarism shit, and my teacher has no clue about it, so i figure if i do my book report about the plagiarism shit, it's an automatic A+, especially w/ my teacher, cuz she loves books, and she always loves it when i know shit about them she doesn't and especially when i teach her about it n shit..i duno i think that sounded weird but i duno how to explain it, so anyway i'm pretty tired of writing in my journal, so i'll ttyl 1-love

sam- i'll be waiting for that happy b-day call!"

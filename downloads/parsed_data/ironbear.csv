"event","Hello friends, it's been quite a while since I last posted on this forum, alot of things have happened, for the most part, all of them are good. Sorry I missed WTT, but cash is tight right now. Made it down to Gaian Mind, which is allways interesting. Spent all of my time in the sweat lodge, which is allways great. It had been a long time since the last sweat. I cherish the time that I get to sweat with my clan and the folks who come to the land. There's a whole lot of healing going on in that place. 

On the health front, I guess it was time for my wake up call. I spent 6 days in the hospital with pneumonia. It was the sickest I had ever been in my entire life, think I came really close to purchasing the ranch. I quit drinking, was drinking way too much for my own good, dropped about 50lbs, which makes a big difference as far as my arthritis feels and also my sleep apnea. It's all good.

On the personal front, still without a mate. It's been over 2yrs now. But thats ok, when the time comes for that piece of the puzzle to fall into place, it will. I am slowly learning to become more patient with the universe and what it has in store fore me. 

I finally sold the house this month! I have a contract on it, and the buyers wish to close at the end of july. I will be selling everything in the house, I mean everything! Power tools, home theater system, furniture, hand tools, sporting goods, a canoe, clothing, books, washer, dryer, Uh, you get the picture.

Once this is complete, I will be moving to Panama, not Panama City Fla., but the place with the canal. My best friend, who works for the govt., is allready down there, so I have a place to live and a car to drive. It's time to make a change. He lives in the rain forest, and he says it's paradise! I will be learning spanish, which will increase my marketability in the workplace. My resume is quite diverse, so I anticipate the transition will be relatively painless. I will still be around for a few more months, but am very excited about my upcoming adventure.

"event","Looks like we will be putting the house up for sale within the next month. At first, I did not want to do this, but after logically thinking about it, it really is the best option. For a number of reasons. It will allow all of us the freedom to do what we need to, it will motivate others to find their own place to live. It will put some money in our pockets, and along with the sale of the land in montana, rid of us our debt. This is a good thing. We will all be starting over, which in a way, is kind of scary, but is also very exciting. Am seriously thinking about leaving NJ, and perhaps move south, closer to my teacher and my clan. We will see."

"event","Yee folks, the hardest year of my life is over. It was quite a year. Lost a job, a wife, my balls, (but just for a little while), self esteem, etc. But I am happy to report I have recovered from this malaise and look forward to the future, whatever it may bring. I have found what I am looking for spiritually on the Native American path. Hell, my fathers father was full-blooded Cree, so it kinda makes sense why this feels so right to me. Nothing else has felt like this before.

For the longest time I have been living my life for othere, and not for me. At the time I did the best that I could, while making alot of mistakes in the process. For a time I felt that I did poorly in this endeavor. It was easy to think this way because I was focused on the negative aspects of this whole thing. And I do not just mean my personal life here, I am talking about personal, professional, the whole thing. Before I continue, I want to add that I attended sweat lodge this weekend in Va.

So after the sweat, I felt so energized, so alive, the best I had felt in a long time. So I just started to think about things, talked to some folks, and then I heard someone speak to me. It came to me through the voice of another, but it spoke to me just the same. It was the voice of the ancient ones, guiding me, just like I prayed for them to do. In essence, they told me my life had not been a failure, you had accomplished many good things, have helped and influenced many people. You have endured many storms in your life and have been made stronger bt virtue of this. They told me I am a very strong person, stronger than most, to follow my heart and not be influenced by the negative things said and thought about you. This did not come to me all at once, but over the course of 24 hours. So I thought about all of this. And you know something, they are right. My life has not been a failure, in fact, considering all of the shit I have been through, it has been quite a success. Would I have done some things differently? Yes I would have. But I cannot change that, sorry. As for those that are angry with me about what has happened? I can only look forward now, I refuse to look back. All I know is that I am not angry, I am happy. Not totally happy, but alot happier than I was. It is time to stop living for others, hoping they approve of me and what I do for them. If they disapprove of me or my actions, sorry.

I wish to give thanks to the lodge and the ancient ones for listening to me.

"event","I just want to wish everyone a Merry Xmas, Yule, Chanukah, whatever. I also want to reflect on this past year and the changes it has brought. It has been a tough year in many ways for me. Emotional, spiritual, financial, etc. Changes have occured that have shaken me to the core of my being, both good and bad. It would be easy to focus on the bad, and piss and moan about this and that. I know my last post was in that vein. It was done out of frustration and a lack of understanding in some ways. In a way that helped me to face certain issues and to deal with them, and this is what I am doing. I will be ok, I will survive and thrive in the end. We all will. I know that I need to face certain issues in my life and deal with them and to heal myself, so that I can heal others.

I am thankful for what I do have. I have a family that loves me, and friends that support me. I know that we have our moments, but I know the love is there. I have found the sweat lodge, and the pollen path. Only the creator knows how much this has helped me get through some tough times. I continue to be moved by the power in this path. This upcoming year will be challenging as well, but armed with a revised perception, and a better grasp of reality, the challenges that we will face will be dealt with and handled with clarity and wisdom, or at least we will try to. I love you all, and wish everyone a happy and prosperous new year.

"event","I just guess it takes longer for me to realise things. Reality has slapped me in the face and it stings a little, fuck it, it hurts. But it is what it is and I will deal. I usually try to keep personal issues in house, but I felt that I needed to put some things down on ""paper"" before I exploded. It was helpful to do that. Better than me going off on some screaming fit of rage. Not a pretty sight.

"event","It was all a lie
""I'll never leave you"" were the words spoken
You have left me
My spirit is almost broken

The love was not strong enough
The commitment not deep enough
To weather the storms that have passed
I guess they are right, forever nothing ever lasts

I made mistakes large and small
Brought from baggage I wish not to recall
The love not strong enough
The commitment not deep enough

But its not good enough to try and change
My head is so much different now
The love not strong enough
The commitment not deep enough

The lack of respect that I am afforded
Leaves my heart and soul forever contorted
The love not strong enough
The commitment not deep enough

You wish to portray me as a monster
Full of hatred and abuse
Embellishing events to add to your excuse
The love not strong enough
The commitment not deep enough

I guess I really thought you still loved me as you once had claimed
What a fool I have been, for this I am ashaimed
I let you tear me down by the way that you have treated me
That was then I say to you, your hatred will not defeat me

Your perception of our life together will certainly differ from mine
Your love love now nonexistent, your hatred well defined
I know what I have done, and what I have neglected
But I guess you giving up on us is not what I expected

You claim to be a warrior from lives that long since passed
But for us you do not wish to fight, your intentions are well cast
The love not strong enough
The commitment not deep enough"

"event","What a weekend! Feara, Dave, and myself drove down to Va to Joes, he is the medicine man who pours lodge at 4qf. We tore down the old sweat lodge that had been there for 4 yrs and constructed a new one according to navaho tradition. Then it was off to sweat! Let me tell you all something, I have found what I have been searching for since awakening. This path is right for me. I have experienced the power of it firsthand. It is good medicine. It has helped me to deal with issues that I have with my self and others. This is a path of healing and love and beauty, and it pleases me that I am a part of it."

Been having dreams about the lodge and the people involved with it. Before that, I never really dreamed that much. And if I did, it was usually something pretty weird. I really do see and believe in the power of this path. That is unusual for me. Need to take more control over my life, time to make me happy and not rely on others for this."

"event","Alrighty- lets just start on what happened yesturday... I was in a car accident. A bad one. We went to the Cabbore (sry if there is a spelling error) and then dropped Beth off at her house. We then were on our way home and decided to go through Loch Raven... the gate was closed but it would soon be opened in like a minute... so we were waiting there, parked on the side of the road, and a motorcyclist infront of us. The man finally comes (the one that is supposed to be unlocking the gate). As he starts unlocking the gate, he stops and says, ""They are not going to stop!""... a car (royal blue race car--> almost like in Fast and Furios) was speeding over the hill and smoke was coming off of the ground because they were trying to stop... the man who was unlocking the gate then jumped onto the side of the road... and the car broke the lock as it crashed right through the gate. This force on the gate, led it to bury itself into the ground on the hills by the road. The car kept coming, still very fast... the biker infront of us jumped off of his bike, landing on a pole (got and injured leg). Then came us. The car was at a very high speed, even though he was trying to stop at the top of the hill as well as broke the gate. We had a head on collision, giving me a leg problem, sonia a hip problem and both of us mental tramatizations. I cannot get this image out of my head, and I figured writing about it would help a bit, as well as drawing the situation on paper during class or something. Then came later that night...

We had a thunder storm... it wasn't a light one- it turned the power off, and the power as well as water are going to be off for a long time. While we had power at that time, i was watching alias (though the weather station kept interrupting and making me miss very exciting parts of the show...) Once the weather station stopped broadcasting, alias came back on... I saw vaughn and syndney come through the door where Sloan and Nadia were... but then... THE DAM POWER WENT OUT. Because the power went out, I was unable to do my homework as planned, so i figured it would be back on in the morning... I waited until morning, but there wasn't ne power... I did my painting by candlelight (it eended up having white spots on it because I coudl not see them in the dark)

I had history and got my test back. There is not an explanation for this one, becuase I studied my ass off... like usual... but i studied more and harder... but no. Mr. SMARTY PANT ASS WIPE DICK FACE BASTARD decides that he doesn't want me to even have a good grade (above a C) on his tests or even in his class.


WOOPPEEE."

I saw him hold the waist of this one asian girl... like how boyfriends do to their girlfriends... but he has a gf in college! wat if he broke up with her or she broke up with him and then he went for this other asian girl who goes to bryn mawr? I thought there was some kiknd of connectin or something... like... DAAAmmm... it just makes me want him eveen more than ever... its like how Kelsie Cooper likes Gough, and then she had to watch Caroline Galvez and Gough go out for a year... and they are still going out... poor kelsie...And then I have to hear people talk about caring about their ""lover"" (i hate that word by the way) and all of that lovey dovey shit... i just wish that one day he (matt) will realize how much i like him... one day."

It looks like he might have a bit of interest cause he told me i was cute and told my friend that I was pretty. I mean- gosh... can he look any hotter to me?? HECK NO... his looks, personality... inside and out he is beautiful. I look forward to the even days (school schedule) just to see him @ Gilman after 2nd period in the lobby...
One thing i just love, is a good smile... He has a great smile... not a fake one either.

"event","Some would say that I am desperate because of all these guys I like. Well I would say I'm keeping my options open. Even though there are a few guys I like, there are two that stand out of the group: Grizzy and Matt. (For those of you that dont know- that foreign guy-- French --ended up being 21 years old... yikkes) So, either way, Grizzy- Alex Griswold if u wanna know- goes to St. Pauls and I met him through a friend, another Alex.

Grizzy is very cute, tall, and blonde. He has a great smile and personality, and Alex plays basketball, baseball, and i believe he also plays football. The first time I met him was near the mid-summer at Batemans. There was anotehr guy with him, and he was very hot, a bit cuter sry to say, but didn't have as great of a personality as Grizzy did. The flaw of this guy is that he doesn't make moves... meaning the girl asks out the guy...i think i already did this task by going to the semiformal Fall Ball with him. It was a great night, but he never asked me out after that. My friend told me that he almost asked me out, but was afraid of rejection... o well... either way-- i still keep this guy under the radar just in case he pulls through.

Matt Hogan... i think u guys have heard a bit about this really awesome guy. Either way- just to get down to business-- he has a girlfriend... in COLLEGE.. i mean WTF. college? wat is an older girl dating a younger guy for? I dont know if I would ever 
understand that. Hes cute, has BEAUTIFUL blue eyes, black hair, great smile, and an outstanding personality. He writes extremely intriguing short stories, and I trade my poems every now and then for a short story. The other day when I was talking to him (I see him every other day after my 2nd period class and we talk for like 10 minutes) he smiled and seemed a bit interested... i dont know if he was, but it sure looked like it. Hopefully this one will break his dumbass relationship with that broad, and pick me up some suga

"event","Ok, so yesturday was bad, but can it get worse? I, all of the sudden, am extremely sick. It may be the worst I have ever been. To add onto the drama- it is Easter break with all of that great candy and food. We must not forget that this was the date in which Jesus was resurrected; a lot of people only think of the bunnies and dying eggs. 

Either way- I am sick... no lamb... no egg salad or deviled eggs... no candy... no celebrating the resurrection of Jesus... just sleep and television. I must tell you the symptoms of course for you to understand my pain.

Completely naucious and light-headed (whenever I stand up- i have to grab onto something  because of the  complete pain and feel of faintness, and I am not eating at all)

Sore throat-- cant swallow and it hurts to drink ne thing, but I have to so I can get better

Ofcourse--> I promised Sonia yesturday that I would go to the mall with her, and I was miserable the whole time. Despite the sickness, Sonia and I thought it would be fun to try on funny and weird prom dresses, but that didn't happen. We tried on elegent dresses that were just beautiful. It got to the point where I had to sit down every few  minutes, so we called my mom to pick us up.. ofcourse I got even worse as the day went on, watching this channel where people make designer rooms for impoverished people, stuff like that.

So here I am at around 8:10 pm in my room trying get through the pain... wow... im sry if this journal sounds like I am exaggerating, but its the actual stuff I am going through and I dont know wat to do right now cause I cant go to sleep so I decided to write a journal. Im just gonna go. Bye"

"event","Okay, so this morning my dad decides he wants us to take a family trip to Soloman's island... okay... interesting. So we leave at around 11:00 and drop off some Salvation army stuff first. It takes about 3 hours to get down there and ofcourse Sonia and i had to have a bathroom break (small bladders), so we stopped at Starbucks. Some how somebody *cough* *choke* floods the bathroom before I can get in there, but I found a place next door to go in. So we get there around 2:30 or something and I am getting hungry because I had a really small breakfast. After having this 3 hour ride to get to Soloman's island, we only spend 10 minutes driving around the place and then leave.... POINTLESS... ofcourse my dad promised us that we would get something to eat there, but NO... we didn't get ne thing to eat there... we just took one picture infront of this dumb lighthouse that is broken down, just one... and left. Then he has this AWESOME idea *COUGH CHOKE BARF* that we should visit St. Mary's College... O M GOSH. So we end up driving to the town of St. Mary's and it is in the middle of NO WHERE , i mean there isn't ne thing around there, and Sonia and I are getting extremely hungry. My dad has to read all of the historical facts about the college and walk around the place giving us a tour saying that the actual dorms are classrooms, when ofcourse they are dorms... he thinks he knows everything. He also mistakened the State House as the original one from 1676, IT WAS MOST DEF NOT. He went around the place asking random people why they decided to go to this piece of crap in the middle of no where junkyard college.. I thought it was kinda nice- it was on a river or lake or something, really pretty, but it was under construction (thats why he called it a junkyard). So either way, Sonia and I finally rebell and go to the car to wait for him to finish his little escapade. We STILL have not eaten since like 7 that morning... we end up getting out of that deserted place, but there are no resturants on the side of the road, this was awful because tehyu didn't even have a McDonals or even a Pizza Hut... i mean they usually exist every 1/4 mile. Then my dad gets some other idea where we go to this resturant (FINALLY SOMETHING TO EAT) called Earls, which is near this house they used to go to vacation in... well that didn't work out because it didn't even exist ne more. There was a hardware shop in its place.... yippee... more Kudos for daddy. So after going out of our way wasting time yet again, my mom (thank you very much, my savior) gets this such a great awesome idea that we go to Rips, a resturant we usually go to with our grandmother when we visit (not very often). So they say, o, itll be only about 15 minutes... guess what happens in the last couple miles of getting there after 25 minutes of driving... TRAAFFICC JAM... i mean- can ne thing else go worse? Ofcourse, my luck, there is a cop next to us so my dad couldn't go into the right lane and around everybody... instead he cut this really liberal lady off shoving our Bush campaign stickers in her face... turns out she was going into the same resturant. WOW. We finally reached our destination at about 6:30. I had not eaten for maybe 11 hours. We get to the door, leaving the liberal choking in our dust. (The reason I say Liberal is because of all these bumper stickers she held on her car). Its not like I am against liberals, but I wanted everybody to know the tension between my dad and this random lady in the boondocks. So, we finally get there... my sister as well as my parents got the same exact thing ""Roast Beef, A House Salad with Ranch, String Beans, and French Fries with Gravy on top"". Ofcourse I am usually different than my family and get fried chicken with cole slaw and a house salad with ranch. I ate all of my chicken, and I was really proud because it was a half of a chicken: One breast, One thigh, One wing, and One Drumstick. WOW. I am an eating machine. Well either way, we got out of there without being shot because of my dad shouting his political views. My dad decided to get some Mega Million tickets next door at the liquor store as well as some scratch off lottery things. We won 4 dollars. Wow. That covered our toll atleast. The best thing about the trip was the next couple minutes, even though they weren't perfect. We stopped by Ritas Italian Ice, the best chocolate and chocolate gelati existant in the world... unless ur in Italy, which I am not. Well, we get there and they dont have the chocolate italian ice, they get it 2morrow. JUST MY LUCK... ONE DAY. We are in the middle of no where and I am not going to go there tomorrow just to get a chocolate italian ice to satisfy my needs. I ended up getting a cappicino italian ice and chocolate custard gelati.. it was good besides the fact that the cappacino didn't taste like ne thing. We made it home around 7:30-8:00... long day... i am never going out of this house until I eat a whole BIIIIGGGG meal and I mean BIG. Nice talking to ya guys, and by the way- this is most def the longest journal entry I have writtten yet.. PEACE.

"event","Well...... my coach at meadow mill- Ossie, decided that since he is leaving- he wanted to have me play somebody (that wasn't competitive) every week. He wanted us to benefit from it too, so he set me up with this guy named Andrew who goes to BL.

This guy is sooo shy, just like me, so when we were warming up- nobody would ask to switch sides because we r used to waiting for somebody else to say something. I spent like 10 minutes on the forehand. Hes a sweet guy and everything, but im trying to break the ice n stuff cause that is the only time im not alone ALL WEEK.

____________________________________

Here is another guy, remember the foreign hottie?? well, hes French. My first impression was that he was SOO hot and he looked around my age- maybe 16... i asked him last time- and he was 21!!! i was like, WTF. there goes any chance of going out with a foreign guy

So i asked him if he was gonna come on a regular basis, and he said that he would come every monday to play with me. This guy is a beginner so itll just be a goofing off kinda match even though he learns quite fast

----------------------------------

Now, heres another dilemma. I like this guy that I see every day at squash, I mean- im not completely head over heels thinking about himn all of the time like him, but I like him.. and i have a feeling he might like me, so im gonna do something to get his attention. 
    The guy that I think about like most of my time is Matt Hogan... but he has a girlfriend (in college might i add... UGH)

Ive had a lot of conflicts with my english teacher and they are finally settling down, and she also suggested that I may have a learning disability, which sounds awfully true. I am going to get tested some time in the next year. Either way- she finally knows that I work really hard which is such a good thing to know.

"event","here is a dam dumb but really moving poem i read in english. I would like you guys to read it and then read my connection to my dam dumb daily life.

Riding A One-Eyed Horse

One side of his world is always missing.
You may give it a casual wave of the hand
or rub it with your shoulder as you pass,
but nothing on his blind side ever happens.
 
Hundreds of trees slip past him into darkness,
drifting into a hollow hemisphere
whose sounds you will have to try to explain.
Your legs will tell him not to be afraid
 
if you learn never to lie.  Do not forget
to turn his head and let what comes come seen:
he will jump the fences he has to if you swing
toward them from the side that he can see
 
and hold his good eye straight.  The heavy dark
will stay beside you always; let him learn
to lean against it.  It will steady him
and see you safely through diminished fields.
___________________________________________________

Ok, here is my little connection thingy. MY DAM LIFE SUCKS BITCH. This poem is talking about a mutual relationship between a person and their companion throughout life and obstacles. I need a dam boyfriend because I am blind in one eye and am unable to fricken see the dam spear flying at my head

Ok... so now im dead after living a life of being blind in one eye. Just because i didn't have a dam boyfriend to see me through and save me from this spear being thrown at my f***ing head I am dead because it struck me in the dam ass and yea.

"event","omg!!! u dont understand how i feel right now... I had the worst day ever, until squash. I was just practicing and i started getting bored- until this hottie came along and started watching me play. I pull a few tricks here and there to impress him cause its not very often that a hottie my age comes into the squash facility. He ended up askin me if I could teach him how to play..........

i mean WOW.. this guy had beautiful eyes, perfect hair (kinda spikey) and his accent was soooo cute!! He sounded like a french guy and was sooo sweet. He had on jeans and a sweatshirt. After playing for a bit, he said in his adorably cute accent, ""O MAN... its getting really hot... woo... i need to take this sweatshirt off..."" HE HAD THIS NICEST CHEST... HE HAD ABS TOOO... o m g. I ended up having the greatest time of my life, which I wasn't expecting to happen cause spring break just ended and all this bad stuff happened today and .. aaaah.. *sigh* ... and his smile. how can anybody be that perfect??? and approach me?? its a once in a lifetime thing! 

He was so sweet, and he learned the game so quickly, he almost beat me! Its like a fairy tale movie or one of those teen movies where girls meet foreign guys and go out with them... I ended up findingn out his name, and its Alex... fits him perfectly... a perfect name for a perfect guy. Its too bad though cause I was left almost emptyhanded... no number...no screen name... just a name and wonderful memories.

Hopefully I will see this stud sometime later this week and find out his number... maybe go to dinner or something.. i feel like im already planning my outfit! IM SO SIKED AND BLOWN AWAY!"

I'm not here to tell you what is right, yet what faith I have in myself and the people around me are going to lead the way onto an unknown road. God is the supreme being and is omniscient in every way. This does not mean that the individual knows what is to come in her life; she is walking an unknown path into eternity.

At this point you may be wondering wat the hell is happening to me in order for some magical shit to come out of my mouth like that. Honestly, I am not sure why, but I'm in that creative mood. Rather than writing this crap that nobody is going to read, I could be painting a new creation (it would turn out much better than my writing, I'm sure Mrs. Rogers would agree to that one ;)....).

"event","seriously... i dont understand... every time i walk into my room, I feel like somebody is right there watching me... its weird. *shudders*... Actually (correction) I am not in my room anymore, I moved into my brother's room, sry Paul, but I had to get away from the tooth grinder. I dont like it when I have to take off my shirt and the window is open or the door is unlocked... weirds me out. (that is wat happens when u share a room for a long long long long time)

Have you ever day drempt that something bad was happening? a robbery, a huge tornado, a great injury?? well i have. It usually happens when I'm lusting for something to happen in my life like a relationship or something coool... that dam day dream ends up making me feel worse than i did previously so its kinda worthless but o well. 
   For example--> Im hungry. We keep passing the dam resturants that are all over the place, yet we dont go anywhere and I start craving and its awful... we never stop to get ne thing to eat and then there is my sister eating a dam piece of pizza right infront of me. Then i usually become conscious because of somebody asking me a question *cough* MOM. 

That lady does not understand when to be quiet. She always states the obvious too... like ""Did u know that is a Mercedes?"" DUH... it has MERCEDES written all over it! Or... ""This kind of sandwhich is called an Italian Cold Cut. Its Italian because of the dressing they put on it."" DUUUUHH... i wasn't born yesturday!!! 

Darn it... im talking about food again... im hungry. ttyl
Dont u dare leave a message talking bout food or im gonna die."

(ahaha tiff!) or liek those instances that they came upon while getting drunk at wild parties over the weekend (hooking up with some guy or something like that or pulling down their pants in the mid. of a field and taking a picture of their white prissy underwear covered buttox... refer to pic in Commons)soon I have to go to that room where they talk about their unsucessful lives... but the good thing is- I get to talk to tiffie or hang our or something like that... TIFFIE: LETS RUN A PARTY IN THE ADVISORY SO THAT THEY KNOW WE EVEN EXIST! So ive got a few idealios:::::

A Healthy Party
A Mexican Party
Diff Culture Party (people bring in some food that reflects their background.. i.e: I can bring a lebonese dish)
Dessert Party

Or just a reg. party cause they dontn like original ideas cause they are too dumb to think of it. LOLOLOL.. i can imagine u laughin at this right now... haha.. ok ...... wooo... *BREATH*.. ok... or we can just have our own party at lunch one day and just involve ourselves n stuff like that.... sounds good???

"event","I feel that all of my journals so far have been really really negative towards like everything, except my ice cream poem... so I would like to start putting good things into this journal because equalizing it would make it better and more welcome to read...

SO either way.... yesturday my mom was reading my ims behind my back and obsessing about the guys that i liked trying to get info out of me so she can get a better understandign of me or something... very very annoying by the way.... so I basically drove her away by asking her to make me a bowl of Malfouf (its this lebonese dish that is really really really good...) ofcourse she had to heat it up so that took an extra minute... and then I ate it really fast in order to drive her out of the room again... so then I sent her to put my bowl away and then when she came back- i asked her to make me a bowl of ice cream.. and demanded specific things- my mom is like the queen angel because she is so nice so this is how I got her away by taking advantage of her niceness- so that was my highlight of the night because I enjoyed talking to these really funny guys online w/o interruption and I ate my favorite dishes at the same time (malfouf and a chocolate chocolate chocolate sundae...) this was ended by running away and takinga  shower while my mom picked up my sister... in which I listened to Destiny's Child ""Survivor"" CD, which is really upbeat, so I finally got time to make myself feel nice and happy instead of listening to a mellow band like Guster or Something Corporate who as Julie Taylor says ""FIRE BURNING BURNING FIRE AAAAAAAAAAAH"" ... she likes to make fun of them, yet I dont see a big problem in that band at all cause they are my fav. but watev. They dont talk about death and fire and burning, they just allude to burning when they talk about love and stuff... its not bad, i love Something COrporate cause they are the best...

well im going to end this journal so i can start a new one with a new topic cause i dont like one whole journal w/ many topics unless it was a busy day... ok im weird, i know... off to another..."

Close your eyes
Hold your head up high
Another day may come
Where you and I meet again
Again

Sounds fill the room
And yet we have not met
Not yet
Not yet met again

Your eyes are made of cherries
Heart filled with cold

My Lovely
Glory
Glory Princess

I scream
For you
My ice cream"

"event","O gosh... I think I'll have to start from the beginning in order for everybody to understand my dilemma. I went to a squash camp @ The Naval Academy last summer, and the way we got together is very ironic... He came a couple days late to the camp, and as he walked in- i promised myself that I would not like him cause thats just the way it was... so... either way- I ended up liking himi and he became one of my best friends by the end of the camp. We kept in touch of course and somehow we ended up loving eacho ther and it was awesome... except for the fact that I had not seen him at all for 3 months. This led me to become very sad... so one day I told him that it was too hard to not see him... because I loved him so much... and its not like I dont love him ne more either.

So either way... then came along the squash season.. and there was Dave.................... damn it... and now hes all weird around me... he wont talk... its as if he doesn't want to talk to me ne mroe (not that he is mad but he is distant).... this is angering cause I have to suffer another tournament this weekend because it is IN DELAWARE... at HIS SCHOOL (Malvern Prep) ... WAT THE HELL AM I GONNA DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO??! aah!!!

Im like lusting for him to say that he misses me and loves me still, but I dont think that this is the case because... he doesn't even talk to me ne more. I dont understand, I just dont. If I had a chance to kiss him, which i was never able to do, I would... even if it is this weekend and he is all awkward about it cause I still love him, I like him even more than Peter or Hogies or Max... i mean SERIOUSLY.

I hate love, its rotten."

Utterly brilliant readings that I have found in the Sherlock BBC fandom, fantastic writers indeed. <br /><br />And I have been successful in finding stories where John Watson plays a very competent ex-army character. I definitely like the equanimity and balancing nature of this character, how nonplussed and no-nonsense he can be. And the way he takes in stride Holmes' insults and instead comes back with mild but slight sarcastic commentary.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Very good. <br /></em><br />Although this is very fandom-based, probably. Truly, 3 episodes only, BBC? And the second season postponed up to next year? No wonder the authors out there have already crafted their personalities and given them new interesting quirks. <br /><br />The only thing now for me is to find some kind of fic where Moriarty is featured targeting John more directly. I've found good ones where of course John is taken hostage again, or threatened by Moriarty in some way, but I still haven't found one where there is conversation to length between the Professor and the Doctor. I'd like to read how writers explore that interaction. In other stories when John is captured he either remains silent or does not get to meet Moriarty directly. I for one want a very witty and mature conversation between them, I have the impression Moriarty acts crazy and obsessed towards Sherlock, but when talking to John, things could be more balanced.<br /><br />Or that is just me, I don't know. I always want to have an extra bit of faith (or fun) with the interesting villains.<br /><br />Well, that'll be all. Just randomness for today. Plus I don't want to forget the opening lines of this entry. They may sound rather cheesy and emotional, but my Lord in the real context, they are part of a fabulous complex shady fic with a psychological punch to bowl us over.<br /><br /><em><strong>ETA:</strong></em> I have found a good fic with a mature, lenghty conversation between Moriarty and John, a missing scene-type of story before the ending part of The Great Game episode.

"event","It's a bit of a surprise, but then again, oh Dear Lord, why should I be surprised by fancying the character that I DID NOT expect to?

I never seem to be able to make up my mind. Clearly, I am not consistent with my &quot;types&quot;.

In books and t.v. series and manga and what-have-you, I usually think: Probably I will like the characters that are utterly shaddy and mysterious and interesting. Or at least not the good-doer ones.

Let's revise some examples:

Out of the whole Harry Potter thing: Snape and Slytherins, thank you. Not the good-doers.

But then, in Lord of the Rings, my favorite one was Eowyn and her sense of justice. Hmmm.

And what? In Les Miserables, my favorite is Javert. 

And in Notre Dame, why, my favorite is Father Frollo. 

And in Gaiman's books, I usually go for the interesting ones too. You know, De Carabas, Crowley, etc.

So how come now that I am laughing my head off re-watching Sherlock BBC, my favorite character is John Watson??!! 

*tut tut* Sorry Sherlock, you've been dumped. And for a minute there, I even thought Mycroft could be my favorite one...but noooo. In the end, I bow and surrender. Okay, you sweater-wearing, Queen-and-Country ex-soldier Doctor Watson, you win. 

Now I go and hunt for fic, as usual. But first, I have to finish my thrice-dammed reports for next Monday. Heaven helps me, so boring!! 

And it just irks me, sometimes I think John extrapolates to Good Omen's angel-Aziraphale, and Sherlock to demon-Crowley. But I am definitely a Crowley-girl in that fandom. So why do I fail to be consistent? *waves her John Watson love flag*&nbsp;
 
I surrender happily, though, because my consolation is that Doctor Watson could be an utter -and dangerous- bastard if he wants to, so I assume there must be many stories out there where he demonstrates it. Hunting time it is.

*wanders away to get a cool drink from the fridge in this hot Friday afternoon....while ignoring the reports half-done on the table*

Not too hot or boring to be having epiphanies, I guess.

"event","It's been a very calm and content couple of days, lately.<br /><br />From a very simple perspective -although simple does not mean irrelevant- I think it's due to the fact that I finally did that bloody Adv Macro test I had been dreading.<br /><br />And I was not traumatized by it. It's well done and behind me now, so my mind and shoulders feel lighter. <br /><br />Also, I've come to terms with what 99% sure will be the topic of my Master thesis, and I feel agreeable and now, excited with it.<br /><br />The fact that it will require for me to spend this September doing an internship in Africa is playing a large role in peeking my interest. <br /><br />And since my stress level is going down, I've been enjoying doing some light reading and watching T.V. series. Again. <br /><br />It's been months since I gave Sherlock BBC a chance -back in Winter of last year- but I revisited the series with a more focused attention span this weekend, and I've enjoyed it much more. <br /><br />So now, I am happily and lazily hopping about different fandoms that I had never cared for before, books and T.V. mostly.<br /><br />Plus watching some reruns of Fry &amp; Laurie, that comedy double act that Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie used to conduct some good 10+ years ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I still go out to walk down the riverside almost every day. By early morning is cool and humming with cigars, by late evening is warm and a bit silent, with the occasional firefly dancing about. <br /><br />Oh, and I've been playing almost non-stop the music of The Decemberists, a band that caught my eye when it appeared in the post of great GO, Neverwhere and Sherlock writer in my F-list. I love songs that tell stories, and this band is all about that. <br /><br />And on the topic of the F-list, I found this very nice sort-of-reflection section in the LJ of 2 very talented graphic designers&nbsp;<lj user=""puka_pudge""/>&nbsp; , so I want to emulate it to close this entry. Just because.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/000a6b53/""><img width=""320"" height=""382"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/000a6b53"" alt="""" /></a></div>&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong><em>Live<br /></em></strong><em>I live for my expectations now, a very hard thing to do and something which still does not come as first nature to me.<br />I live proud in my realization that indeed one becomes more grateful with the passing of time and the effect of distance. <br />I feel lucky to say that I live for both the recollections of the past and the hopes of the future. <br /><br /><strong>Laugh<br /></strong>Infinitely glad to have learned to laugh at myself. <br />Scarily careful about laughing at others. With others, I am all for it, but at others? <br />Aside from that, smiles and laughter have always been both great weapons and source of relief. <br /><br /><strong>Love<br /></strong>What a damn cheeky girl that I am, but I have to admit, this has been a constant in my life. <br />And to be even more annoying, I am fairly sure it's a constant in most people's life, but it usually goes by unseen and unappreciated.<br />What is love, if not subtle at most times? <br /></em>"

"event","I'm just saying that the whole school drama is both hilarious and appalling.<br /><br />One would think we are back in High School instead of a Graduate School where ages range from 23 up to 50 or something. <br /><br />This very nice classmate of mine, the polite shy guy (who would do well in having a bit more of a tough attitude) is being <em>stalked/chased/haunted </em>by this pretty fake-cute lioness of a younger girl. <br /><br />I laughed out loud at the situation the first weeks. Funny shenanigans and all that.<br /><br />Now I am quite annoyed. Oh goodness, girl, give it a rest. You've freaked out the guy. He is not going to go out with you if you are all by throwing yourself at him and threatening his manhood or whatever. <br /><br />Seriously, where's this girl's common sense and pride? <br /><br />On another note, my mind is telling me quite loudly: &quot;be scared! be worried! study study study!&quot; <br /><br />Because we are about to finish this term and all the final papers and presentations and exams are here now. And there is this ONE exam that I am terrified of. Everything else is relatively easy. <br /><br />But this exam! And the more I study for it, the more boring I become with the contents and the less I retain the knowledge. And I feel quite useless about it. Studying for the exam is not working!! What can I do then? I know myself and I am aware that I work well under pressure, which means I will be studying like crazy 3 days before the exam takes place.<br /><br />But I really wanted to be prepared with weeks of anticipation. But alas, my plans are backfiring on me.<br /><br />My solution to everything? Re-read Good Omens a bunch of times, read GO fanfics, listen to Cyrano De Bergerac audiobook, cook Mexican food and give it away to my landlords and walk around enjoying the river side. <br /><br />Ahhh, study efficiency, where are thee?"

"event","And those words I direct to myself. After all, it has taken me over a year to come and post something again in LJ. 

I guess there's no point in screaming the &quot;I am alive!&quot; Obviously I have been absent from this scene because...well...I was living the infamous real life. 

What have I done so far? Starting from the most recent events and moving down towards the oldies:

-I gave this LJ something of an overhauling. And this is a very dubious term I&nbsp;am using, since I suck at coding and stuff. I keep telling my sister that I would saddle her with this remodeling thing, but she's very busy with her work and taking care of mom and the house...This morning I just shrugged my shoulders and decided to stop dilly dallying.

So now I've got a white-ish LJ with new icons and simpler looks. I rather like it. 

-I have happily gone into fan mode over some actors, sporadically and cyclically. Which means I gush over one of them for two months, then I fall in love with the other for three months, then I go back to the first one, then alternate with a new one. And so on and so forth.

Who? The usual ones. Giovanni Ribisi, Alan Rickman, Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Laurie and my newest shiny addition Mark A. Sheppard. 

I even enjoy watching Glee and had an attempt into really liking some of the actors/actresses...but goodness that fandom is a crazy lolistic thing. I turned tail and ran, coward little me. 

-I got very much involved in a new anime fandom, for the Hetalia manga/series. The featured stereotypes are hilarious if not a bit offensive from time to time. But in what kind of world we live in, hm? I like all the nation-characters, but England and Germany are my favorites.

-Every other fandom I was involved with before...has slowly faded into &quot;non-aware&quot; zone for me. It's really weird how once you land in Japan and start living here, things lose that &quot;OMG lookie!&quot; quality of days past. Plus the other series/manga had either already finished or their plots went down the drain. No good plot, no interest for me. And I am quite finicky with plot devices, so I guess I sabotage myself. 

-I've gone back to my old books and audiobooks. Howl's Moving Castle, Good Omens, Cyrano, Les Miserables, Neverwhere, Le petit prince, The name of the rose, etc. 

And have watched some t.v. series. House MD. is a given. New ones? I already said Glee, made me laugh and kept me entertained until out of left field came crashing in my new shiny actor (Mark) and thus...I've watched the last 2 seasons of Supernatural, the last 2 seasons of Battlestar Galactica, Leverage and Warehouse 13. AAAND I might have watched only the episodes where Mark's characters appear...but this is a bias I am happy to maintain. 

-Last but not least (actually this is the last item because it's rather huge) I've been here, living and studying in Japan. My Master is coming along fine. I've had the opportunity to travel around the place. I&nbsp;am planning on visiting Africa and Korea soon *fingers crossed* Food is nice, apartment is small but sufficient, people are weird but fun, language is a mess, and I just skip along and flutter around this place.

Sounds pretty joyous in such simplicity. Of course it's peppered with sad and difficult and frustrating experiences, but so far, so good. Balance and good attitude, right? 

That is it, fine long-time-no-see people.&nbsp; My last year in a nutshell. 

Now that I've got this recap out of the way, maybe I'll come by and start posting with less gigantic pauses in between.
 
 PS: Hmmm. I guess I should include this here, after all. Yes, the Great Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami was the most shocking and sad experience of these past months. On many levels, as a resident of the country, as a foreigner and witness, as a volunteer, as a student of disaster management, and as a friend of Japanese people who were directly involved and affected by it. What is Japan doing, what should the world do? Learn from it, improve and correct their ways. Chin up and move on, now.&nbsp;"

Nahhhh. I have lost anime interest, manga is my ICHIBAN THINGIE right now.<br /><br />So! Here goes&nbsp;my manga reading pending stuff and news:<br /><br />1.

"event","Hello all!  I come bearing giddiness and randomness!! Ahoy everyone! 

1. By mere chance I happened upon this manga: &quot;Koori no Mamono no Monogatari&quot; 

And I am in love with it. It's such a different story from what I usually like!! *OMG* There's no impending doom and gore and darkness and deep controversial arguments. 

It's actually a light shounen-ai story following a rather sad but inspirational plot. The key words being &quot;love&quot;, and &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;light&quot;. It's astonishing, really. I am in awe with the narrative style, and the choice of words (both in the original japanese and the scanlated version by the group Storm in Heaven) is simply beautiful. I particularly love this catch phrase: 

<em>&quot;Let there be light&quot;</em> 

Which is actually something of a prayer, repeated over and over by a demon in his earnest desire to protect a human whom he loves. 

Bottom line: I recommend it to everyone and their neighbors. And I am rather surprised of how scarce is Koori's fandom. 


2. In regards of my dearest D.Gray-Man fandom, I am in the finishing touches of a new fic. Which is the 5th in my &quot;Short Fiction Moments&quot; series (where all stories are Kanda-centric to the extreme, obviously) 

I've had tons of inspiration lately, not only from the latest manga chapter released, but also thanks to other writers like <lj user=""bloodiedangle""/>  and artists like <lj user=""sashima3""/> . 

As a result, this story has turned out to be HUGE in comparison with my original drabble-idea. And I don't mind long fics (personally I love lenghty stories) but the problem is that IT IS SO MESSY. 

It seems like something is not adding up.  Is it the verb tense? Or is it the point of view? Or too much explanation and few poignant constructions?  I suppose these are the moments that call for the famous Beta people. But alas, I've never played like this. 

Conclusion: until I stop doubting this fic, I shall not post. *is sad* I don't usually feel so insecure about my writing, but I guess I just haven't taken the time and care to go over it and edit. 

3. OHHH NOOO I still want to write more D.Gray-Man and now even the Koori no Mamono muse is running free around my head!! 

*headdesk* Go away, you're gonna be the death of me! Wait for vacations at least, darn it! 

*faints away*"

"event","Sadly, today I use this phrase <em>&quot;the calm before the storm&quot;</em> and turn it into <em>&quot;the calm, before and after the storm</em>&quot;. 

In regards, of course, to the unfortunate situation experienced in my country these past days, when heavy rain provoked serious landslides and floods. 

Starting the night of November 6th, and continuing through November 7th, huge amounts of rain unchained a series of events that ended up in (up to date) 198 deaths, 45 destroyed/damaged bridges, over 1000 destroyed houses, 80 still missing people, and the gran (and sad) total of  7000+ evacuated people (half of them are homeless now). 

And as much as I fangirl over manga and anime and books, well, my job usually slaps me across the face with these situations.

Red alert activated the national system of Civil Protection, and my building soon became the chaotic center of dozens of people (Firefigthers, Rescue Teams, ONU, UNPD, USAID, AECID, US Army etc etc) coming and going and yelling and ....well. 

Almost 20 days have gone by since November 6th, and finally some sort of peace is starting to set in. Literally, hm? the calm after the storm.

Destroyed villages are being cleaned, temporary shelters are brimming with people and needs, roads and bridges are being inspected. 

My office, my workmates and I, have a nice collection of mud in our pants and boots and hands. But we are getting people as much help as possible, finally leaving behind the mere emergency actions, to begin the humanitarian assistance labor. 

*sigh* After all this, I think I finally will get to fully check LJ and my other hobbies. These past days I have been only snagging some icons and reading one or two entries.  

I do have to say, though, this small country may have some serious issues (violence, poverty, policies) but if something makes me proud, is just how damn courageous everyone is. Still mourning, but working, still crying, but rebuilding. Any regular person is up to their waist in debris and mud trying to save a neighbor or a complete stranger.

Time and life goes on, I guess."

I shall soon kidnap many pretty icons LOL (big sis already gave me two new shiny ones) <br /><br />2. My eyesight is not improving after 14 years of wearing glasses XD<br /><br />Today my glasses broke, thus rendering me nearly blind in regards of everything that is located some 5 meters away. Ahhh, myopia you are one hell of an inconvenience. <br /><br />On the bright side of this, I shall shamelessly use this situation as an excuse not to go to work tomorrow. MUAHAHAHA. *ahem* I mean, I could have some kind of accident, deshou? I have to travel to another city to reach my office, and what if I get on the wrong bus ... or get hit by a car... or miss a red traffic light.....MUAHAHAHA!!<br /><br />Thank goodness the only boss present in my office for this week is a very maleable grandpa. Lets appeal to his soft side. <br /><br />3. My conscience won't stop nagging me about finishing 3 pending multichaptered stories.<br /><br />Isn't this a bit annoying? Goodness, 2 of those stories belong to fandoms I am not very much involved these days. <br /><br />*flails around* Go away, conscience!! <br /><br /><strike>However, Conscience has a long history of success over my persona, so I fear that soon my ff.net account will be updated. Oh the tragedy, letting Conscience win over me usually leads to not only finishing pending fics, but starting new ones that I have outlined somewhere in my laptop. This, of course, means using work hours in the office to write LOL</strike><br /><br />EDIT: Forget anything and everything about writing or whatnot. We are now in Red Alert at national level, the office is a complete mess, and emergency actions are taking hold of all our time. I've been deployed with the japanese experts, so....let's see how we survive this.<br />"

Two weeks? <br /><br />My old boss left his post (these guys swap every two years or so) in August of this year, and thus, a new boss arrived! Since this new boss knew very few of how things worked, well, I had it easy for two/three weeks. Ahh, life was so nice.&nbsp;<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Why this is givin' me headache""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">But then! BAM BAM!

SHE IS NOT WORKING, SHE ABANDONS THIS WAR AND NOW I AM REALLY ABOUT TO BE MURDERED.&nbsp; <br /><br />Or commit suicide, whicever is easier and less messy. <br /><br />My clueless boss is A REAL NO-HELP at all. And Dear Heavens, we got another lady co-workers to help us (also lives abroad) but she is so much trouble!! No knowledge, no experience, no patience. She's got a lot of enthusiasm alright, but that's not what we need right now. <br /><br />The results? Severe pain for me. I have these awful weird KNOTS on my neck, at the base of my skull. They really hurt like a mother. &nbsp;My eyes are beating me dead too. Arghhh.<br /><br />And we depart tomorrow to Mexico to continue the preparations before the big event starts next Monday.

*as I craddle a cup of formerly-detested coffee*

And I guess I should be doing something akin to mourning the acquisition of new ones

More than anything, I am pretty sure my family cringes at some of the new ones

*remembers the sweet umeshu that was served during our work-dinner-meeting this past monday*

My conclusion is this:

Your honor, the job is to blame. There's where I learned to drink coffee and alcohol and eat seafood. 

...

Ahhh the good times when no coffee was consumed and the shrimp and raw fish were regarded with a snort.

"event","<br />Hello everyone!<br /><br />Sorry for the long absence.<br /><br />As of late, I am terribly delayed in everything that has got to do with Lj, manga and the like.<br /><br />I&nbsp; have been in Japan for some days now, I came to visit my sister who is a student in the Osaka University since this April.<br /><br />So I arrived here like 2 weeks ago and I will stay until April 25th. <br /><br />Someone out here in Osaka, or Kobe or Kyoto? So far those are the closest places I can move to LOL <br /><br />Well, when I return I will have to go through dozens of LJ entries, I am sure. XD Sorry for not commenting for anyone and for being so anti-social lately.<br /><br />My sister is not feeling so well, the weather here is kinda strange even if it is supposed to be spring....so anyway, I want to support her with all my best!! FAITO FAITO!! <br /><br />As long as I am here, I will see if I can find some goodies to buy. Some Dgrayman and Kuroshitsuji doujinshi, at least!!<br /><br />Every time I come to Japan I say the same thing: &quot;I will buy manga and djs and goodies.....&quot; but LOL the time and locations are always against me. <br /><br />Today I will go outto some book shops with a girl here who is studying....check this out.....&quot;the yaoi fandom as a social phenomenon in modern asian countries&quot; as her research project.<br /><br />LOL She is such a sweetie and LOL we have had great conversations, I met her by sheer luck. And guess what....since they kicked me out of my sister room (against regulations to stay more than one week, it seems XO) now I stay with this other girl in her apartment. <br /><br />It is kinda weird, though. I feel very self-conscious of everything I do and say when I am there. I wish I could continue staying with my sister <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://nanaho-miharu.livejournal.com/profile""><img height=""17"" width=""17"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" alt=""[info]"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://nanaho-miharu.livejournal.com/""><b>nanaho_miharu</b></a></div>&nbsp; but&nbsp; it is impossible now... T__T <br /><br />Maybe this afternoon I will finally get to visit a Book Off store and get something. Yeeeyy!&nbsp; And yesterday with my big sis we got some cool clothes. But we have to be very careful with the money, everything is damned expensive here. XD<br /><br />So this is my update.<br /><br />I hope you guys are doing great! Take care minna-san!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

I returned yesterday to my country, and I went to bed and slept for about 20 hours. 

Still tired, though. XD

The work mission was...fine....and interesting. With the usual discussions, arguments, yells and whatnots.

"event","<br />Hello! <br /><br />It's been a long, long time since I posted anything in my LJ account.<br /><br />I don't know why, several important things have happened, and I keep thinking: &quot;<strong><em>ho ho ho I will make a post about this!&quot;&nbsp;</em></strong><br /><br />But then I loose all the inspiration and end up not writing anything. For example,&nbsp; I didn't make a Christmas entry, or a New Year entry or&nbsp;an&nbsp;LJ anniversary entry.<br /><br />I also didn't make an entry for my second trip to Japan, this last December. It was an incredible experience, both the many many places we visited, the amazing time in Kyoto and Kobe and Yokohama, as well as the Training Course we received. <br /><br />But I've got no post to account for it. Hmmm. Come to think of it, I haven't even finished my posts about my first visit to Japan last March. LOL. <br /><br /><strong>Ahh, procrastination, you rule me so. <br /></strong><br />These last couple of days have been a bit depressing regarding my job -which rules by its awesomness XD - but there are so many many things to do, and a lot of people just don't want to take responsibility.....it all contributes to increase my own work load. <br /><br />I have always been happy about it, though. You know what they say &quot;become a key piece within your job&quot; and &quot;do more than expected&quot; and jazz like that.<br /><br />However, I just got a little speech by some of my upper-powers, about how I should limit myself to a lower profile, because....<br /><br /><em>&quot;....let's accept it, you are a woman, and very young....the other men in the office don't want to receive instructions from you....so just take it easy, we know you are doing your best to improve the project, but don't help so much....you just... keep a low profile okay? &quot;</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />*sigh* I may be a woman and I may be 25, but I know very well how our work is not doing as well as it could. We could do so much better! Why no one of the upper levels takes responsibility! There's no leadership! <br /><br />And this chauvinist environment of my country seems to refuse allowing&nbsp;someone like&nbsp;me, to try and straighten things up. <br /><br />And here I was so excited and powered up. But if that's how people want to play....I'll keep on trying my best, if albeit quietly and subtly, because I for one, refuse to keep my arms crossed and do nothing if things start to fall apart. <br /><br />And on better news.... XDDD <br /><br /><span style=""font-size: larger""><strong>I got myself an Ipod Nano 4-G.&nbsp; *happy dance*<br /></strong><strong><br /></strong></span><span><span><strong>That's all in this update.

Hope to get nice thingies to bring back as Xmas presents for my family and friends. <em>*shifty eyes*</em> Of course I hope to learn a lot in the training program. Good thing the other 3 people who go with me (all of us from different countries but we work together in the same regional project) are damn nice and we get along big time! I am sure we'll have a blast. <br /><br />I'd like to send my Xmas cards when I am there too, so if you guys wanna drop here your address, I'd be very happy to send you a pretty Xmas or Ushi-doshi card XDD (because next new year will be the Cow/Ox year neeee!) <br /><strong><br /><em><strong>*whisper*</strong></em></strong> This year 2008 is the Rat/Mouse year, and isn't it great?

Fandoms/Pairings you're new to, but enjoying:</strong><br />&gt; I am reading a bit of CodeGeass now, but I haven't found it enjoyable yet<br /><br /><strong>5.

(but only if Lavi gets revamped LOL)&nbsp;<br />&gt; KanameZero<br />&gt; KuroFai (oh CLAMP please have mercy!!)<br /><br /><strong>6.

What fandom do you choose?&nbsp;</strong><br />&gt; D.GrayMan (but has hidden stash of many more fandoms LOL)<br /><br /><strong>7.

Two of your fandoms are going to collide in a spectacular crossover. Which fandoms would you pick?</strong><br />Well, I love <lj user=""nobeansprout"">&nbsp; work so much, that I have to say Vampire Knight and D.GrayMan<br />And I think I will be killed by saying this, but I really wish I could find a manga/anime where Severus Snape (HP) could appear as in crossover attempt (but so far, none comes to mind)<br /><br /><strong>9. You have to choose between reading bad porn about your fandom obsession of the moment, or no fic at all. What do you pick?&nbsp;</strong><br />*immediate answer* I'd read anything as long as I can read!! Plus, bad porn is good for laughing and for getting ideas for good porn<br /><br /><strong>10. You're asked to pick a theme song for one character/ship. What song do you pick, and for whom? </strong><br />&gt;Fire Dance (violin play Edvin Marton) for Kanda Yuu (DGM)<br />&gt;Hero (Nickel Back) for LaviKanda<br />&gt;Saving Me (Nickel Bak) for KuroFai<br />&gt;Faust (Paul Williams) and I'd do anything for Love (Meatloaf) for Severus Snape<br /><br /><strong>11.

The ship that makes you want to yell, &quot;Just have sex already, you morons!&quot; is...</strong><br />*blinks innocently* I don't think about that particular situation. X33 As long as there is angst and plot I am very happy XDD Nahh, really,&nbsp;hasn't NoahAllen suffered anough teasing by NoahKanda? Something must be done LOL<br /><br /><strong>14. The ship you're probably going to hell for shipping is...</strong><br />&gt;SoubiRitsuka<br />&gt;SiriusSeverus.<br /><br /><strong>15. The character you alternatively love to death and want to beat some sense into is...</strong><br />&gt;Lavi (DGM). Oh how I hate and love thee!! You are great when you are not being this 'I am a super mysterious enigma' persona. I&nbsp;guess that I can't help but compare&nbsp;Lavi&nbsp;(DGM) and Fai (TRC) and I end up deciding that Fai&nbsp;played his lying/fake&nbsp;part so well, while Lavi is lacking, in my book.<br />&gt;Heero (GW): you are a complete moron and blah character in manga/anime, but&nbsp;I love your alternative version when you are paired with Duo.<br />Summary: I like these 2 mostly because they&nbsp;are paired/complement/grow/improve beside my favs Kanda and Duo LOL&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>16. The character you're almost embarrassed to admit you like is...</strong><br />&gt; I am embarrased of my past like of Beyblade (although not the character Kai who&nbsp;was a great dork) but now I am proud of all my favs!! *pompons*<br /><br /><strong>17. Your very first fandom/ship was...</strong><br />&gt; Gundam Wing: HeeroDuo (I still love my fav GW writer so much!! <lj user=""sunhawk"">&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>18. The fandom you could read any kind of fic in is...</strong><br />&gt; DGrayMan, Tsubasa, HarryPotter but ONLY if the focus is Slytherins and/or Snape (LOL, I guess that means NO I CANNOT read any kind of fic of this fandom)<br /><br /><strong>19. The fandom you would totally write an anonymous Mary Sue fic in is...</strong><br />I suck at Mary Sue fics. Even if I tried to keep it light, I tend to over-complicate things.<br /><br /><strong>20. The show you would bring back from cancellation....<br /></strong><strong>&gt;Trinity Blood<br />&gt;Yami no Matsuei</strong><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />"

"event","Saaa, I have to accompany an official mission to Mexico, this time.

I leave tomorrow Wednesday and I'll be back home Saturday night.

*sighs*

I hope we get some free time to walk around and do some sight-seeing at least Saturday morning.

Last time I went to Mexico was 4 years ago, when I was still in the University and we had an students exchange.

So, fanfics, manga-reading and anime-watching gotta be on hold for this couple of days.&nbsp;

Or if I get lucky and I've got internet connection in my hotel room, I may write something during the nights. Not very probable though.....

"event","Okay, so this particular episode of my life was rather hilarious but kinda creepy, too. <br /><br />I never expected to receive a call from -lets call him the M boy- the M Boy and ask me out. The hell, eh? <br /><br />The M Boy, I have no idea what he's thinking. Heck, I have no idea who he is, for starters. He's a friend of a friend's friend!!!&nbsp; I have no more reference than that. We've gone out with a group of friends like 3 times only, and last time I saw him was like 2 weeks ago, when we went to eat pizza for a b-day celebration of a common friend (Lisa, let's say) <br /><br />And now he calls me to ask me ""hey, wanna go out to do, whatever, just go out and hang around or something?""&nbsp; <br /><br />I was kinda clueless. How did he get my cellphone number by the way?&nbsp; <br /><br />My answer:&nbsp;""okay, we can go out, to where and who else is coming with us? Our friends Lisa and Rica and Vanny?"" (all fictional names LOL)&nbsp; <br /><br />And the M Boy says: ""no, errr....like....errr.......hmmmm......as in.......hmmm.....only the two of us, you know?""&nbsp; <br /><br />O_O <br /><br />Oh poor boy, really. Poor kid, he's so screwed.&nbsp; LOL XXXDDD <br /><br />Just by his speaking pattern, you get the idea ne? He's kinda shy and laid back and&nbsp;something of a slacker, but&nbsp;all in all seems like a good person and he's.....so not my type. GOMEN KIDDO! <br /><br />Me goes: ""So, hey, you asking me out in date?"" (inwardly, please say no no no) <br /><br />He goes silent like a tomb for like 10 minutes. Oh god, I knew a massacre was coming. Answer: ""I think so?"" <br /><br />*facepalm*&nbsp; <br /><br />Me goes: ""ah, well, I actually think it's better if we go out like friends with everyone else, like we have done before, ne? So, lets call the others and arrange going to the movies or something for the second week of september because frankly I am full with work right now and I'll get a free day until those dates. We cool?""&nbsp; <br /><br />WAS I MEAN TO HIM? I didn't think I was.&nbsp;The M Boy said we were cool and that it would be great to go out with everyone again in september and then we said our goodbyes and ended the call. <br /><br />Ten minutes later I was in the MSN speaking with our common friend Lisa, who turned out to be the person who gave out my cell number and who encouraged the poor kid to ask me out. Oh Lisa, honey, what were you thinking?&nbsp; <br /><br />To my surprise, she was mad at me!!&nbsp; T.T Apparently I was damn cruel to the boy and damn it I look down onto my suitors and I'm a snob and et cetera.&nbsp; <br /><br />Which suitors?! And if the M Boy wanted me to outright tell him I was not interested, he should have also been straightforward, ne? I tried to answer as neutral as possible, I hate people who humilate others.&nbsp; <br /><br />AND damn it, Lisa, you know I like someone else!!! <br /><br />Lisa says: ""the person you like already has someone&nbsp;and he&nbsp;will never turn to look at you twice, get over it already""&nbsp; <br /><br />T________T&nbsp; Alas, I did not know friends could be that mean when trying to set you up. Of course the person I like already has someone else, of course I know I won't have any kind of relationship with him, and damn it, this person is about to leave the country FOREVER and I will never see him again. Why my friends don't believe me that this is actually painful for me? <br /><br />Lisa's words were kind of a low blow, but hey, truth is truth. <br /><br />I won't speak with Lisa about this situation anymore. I don't want to go out with anyone right now, so don't send over strangers to ask me out, please.&nbsp; What started as a hilarious thing&nbsp; (LOL the M Boy asked me out, what a cutie but of course it's not possible, he should know that!) turned out as a creepy thing ( my friend ganging up on me and calling me a snob while rather harshly ignoring my feelings about the whole situation)&nbsp; <br /><br />*sighs* What a day I had yesterday!! I need TO READ FICS ABOUT KANDA YUU AND FANGIRL ABOUT HIM to forget all this crap.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em><font color=""#993366"">EDIT:</font> Since I already ranted this long about this situation, let me add a&nbsp; couple of words.<br /></em></strong><br />I just remembered something about the M Boy. When I first met him like 4 years ago, he refused to greet me with a kiss on the cheek. Among friends, that is a custom here. I greet most of my friends, even men, with a kiss on the cheek. I found the M Boy's ideosyncrasy rather odd, but it was okay. Back then he never spent much time talking to me and was generally oblivious to my presence. I never cared much about him either. <br /><br />BUT....Two weeks ago when we met again to eat pizza for Lisa's b-day, the M Boy looked at me (we hadn't met in about 2 years) and then approached me and gave me the kiss on the cheek as greeting. And that day when everyone split out to their houses, he also gave me a kiss for goobye.&nbsp;<br /><br />So what's this, M Boy? It's because you just realized I'm a big girl now, ya know, boobies and all? *huff of indignation*<br /><br />And here I end this, I better go and prepare for tomorrow's party anyway."

"event","<p><em>I did get teary eyed when they told me he was leaving....<br /><br />Even if rationally I am aware of how silly is to like -as in a crush, as in 'I think I&nbsp;love this man'- him, him! who is married and who is going back to his wife in Japan and who obviously is not interested in anyone here........<br /><br />Even so, I was so happy to be able to work with him, and look at him almost every day, and admire the way he works and talks and acts and the little smile he has. <br /><br />A silly crush, maybe, but I am really really going to miss him.<br /><br />Just yesterday I received the news:&nbsp; he is leaving -for good, my god, for good- this September 23. He is happy to go back, to his wife and house and culture, I guess.&nbsp;<br /><br />After living 5 years in this country, it was only natural that the Office was going to transfer him back very soon. But I thought that at least until December.....that&nbsp;I would have at least until December, to continue liking him from a distance.<br /><br />As cliche as that sounds, ehh....<br /><br />But now I can only prepare for his farewell party, and act normal and happy for him and not overly-sad or anything. Although I am happy for him, I know he needs to go back. I wish him only the best.<br /><br />I only wish my person could be included in that ""the best"" for his future.

NAKED. X33 But as you have seen, there were other 2 female&nbsp;workmates with me. And although there was an onsen only for women -not a mixed one, of course the guys had their own place- it took me FOREVER to convince them to take off their clothes!! And that sounds so wrong, but is true!! One of them was adamant about wearing a swimsuit to the onsen. The okami nearly had a heart attack when in my still-hesitant japanese, I told her my friend wanted to know if it was okay to wear clothes for bathing. Of course it was not possible, so after much fuss and my explaining of Japanese culture, we finally made it. It was a funny thing at the beginning, because inwardly I was blushing like hell. I am very shy regarding my body, but outwardly, I was fresh like a lettuce.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we washed in those small wooden&nbsp;seats and then, into the hot hot hot water. It stung at the beginning, but after a few minutes, it was HEAVEN!! So relaxing!&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/000893k4/""><img style=""WIDTH: 181px; HEIGHT: 143px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/000893k4/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp; <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0008ac66/""><img style=""WIDTH: 150px; HEIGHT: 174px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0008ac66/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp; <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0008bgcq/""><img style=""WIDTH: 181px; HEIGHT: 142px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0008bgcq/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />And, well, where you expecting p0rn pictures? XDD We did take one while the 3 of us were wearing only these tiny tiny towels -really, no modesty at all!!- but I'm not gonna post it, LOL. After the relaxing bath, we got to have a traditional dinner while okami-san sang for us old folklore songs. It was such a surreal, beautiful experience!! And the food was delicious, although I almost don't like seafood, but that night, I ate everything with gusto: shrimp, lobster, fish, meat, rice, soups!&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0008ckkq/""><img style=""WIDTH: 181px; HEIGHT: 152px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0008ckkq/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp; <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0008dgsw/""><img style=""WIDTH: 191px; HEIGHT: 151px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0008dgsw/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp; <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0008ext6/""><img style=""WIDTH: 129px; HEIGHT: 174px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0008ext6/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><p align=""left""><br />The following day, to finish this part of the trip, we said goodbye to the kind people of the ryokan, we received a&nbsp;farewell gift (cute wild boar, local of the area) and then, we boarded the minivan and started our way towards Tokyo.&nbsp;<br /><br />That day was Sunday, and we were supposed to arrive to Tokyo by 2 P.M. and then visit Akihabara, Asakusa and some other great places!!

"event","*gush gush gush*<br /><br />Cats are -hands down- my favorite pets. I love them. I LOVE them to bits!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Have you heard this thing about people being morning people, or night people, cat people or dog people, and so on? Me, I am a cat AND night people like, WHOA.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strike>Kinda funny that my chinese zodiac -juunishi- symbol is the Rat, LOL!!&nbsp;<br /><br /></strike>Something like 3 years ago, I had a beautiful cat. Her name was Kiria, she was a Thai cat (I'm still not sure if siamese and thai cats are the same o_o since people tend to use the terms pretty loosely) She looked like this *so pretty!!!*<br /><br />&nbsp;<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/00075g6x/""><img style=""WIDTH: 170px; HEIGHT: 119px"" height=""196"" alt="""" width=""260"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/00075g6x"" /></a><br /><br />But *tears tears tears* she is not with me anymore.&nbsp;One day when I&nbsp;came back home from the Uni, they told me she had stepped out since the morning, and then she vanished into thin air. T_T&nbsp; I looked for her everywhere. I&nbsp;checked every house of the colony. I asked around. Two of my friends helped me to look for her too, during the days that I was away at the Uni.<br /><br />But my daughter Kiria was not found. I have dreamt with her so many times. One time&nbsp;I really thought my dream was real, and that I had found her. When I woke up, I locked myself in the bathroom for one hour to cry.&nbsp;<br /><br />SO! *shudders* It's amazing! Last week&nbsp;I went to a bussiness trip&nbsp;with my boss-san,&nbsp;a 3 days-long trip. When I returned home on Saturday afternoon,&nbsp;what a surprise was to find&nbsp;that my sister had&nbsp;found on the street in front of our house 4&nbsp;Thai&nbsp;kitties!!&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""They are Kiria's babies I swear!!!"">I WANT TO BELIEVE THEY ARE KIRIA'S CHILDREN!! *bawls*<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/00076yc5/""><img style=""WIDTH: 198px; HEIGHT: 145px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""316"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/00076yc5/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/00077q6q/""><img style=""WIDTH: 186px; HEIGHT: 145px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""318"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/00077q6q/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />My pretty, pretty&nbsp;big sister -who is a biologist and animal lover and is going to Japan next year for a scholarship- picked them up -against mother's wishes&nbsp;since she doesn't like cats or&nbsp;any other animal&nbsp;much- and we had them at home for around 4 days.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sadly, we had to give them away. Since I already have a cat *LOL* My cat is a boy, a big boy now, and he's a GANGSTER CAT, a THUG CAT!! *LOL*&nbsp;His name is Paris, and he was one of Kiria's first children, and we decided to keep him. When Kiria was gone, and my doggy Kero-chan died, Paris-kun became our only pet. *LOL* He's such a street-cat. Nothing like his mother, Kiria was a cat-lady.&nbsp;<br /><br />Paris-kun for you:&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0007ac5h/""><img style=""WIDTH: 173px; HEIGHT: 139px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0007ac5h/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />The last&nbsp;kitty that&nbsp;we gave away was my favorite. I had started to call her ""Kiria"" too. I even put&nbsp; a bow on her, before giving her to a friend of work. I hope he and his family take good care of her (although he told me today that his kids already changed her name to ""Sassy"") *LOL* She looked exactly like a baby Kiria: <br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/00079qr0/""><img height=""160"" alt="""" width=""120"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/00079qr0"" /></a><br /><br /></div><br /><strong><em>SUMMARY: I love cats, a lot. I wish I could have more. But *pats Paris-kun* he's now my only child. A very feisty, rude and lazy child. And fat, don't forget that!! XXDDD&nbsp;</em></strong>"

Ahhh, now it rains or is it just dew over there?&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Hello, all.<br /></strong><br />------------------<br /><br />I am thinking about growing a heart, lately. Just, you know, one a little bit smarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />This one I have is feeling stupid because I've reached the phase of: ""Uggghhhh I do NOT want to read Naruto manga anymore"" *sad sigh*&nbsp;<br /><br />Bye bye <strong>Itachi-in-my-mind-great-character</strong>.&nbsp; The mangaka just sold you over, and turned you into a cartoonish version of yourself. Chapter 403 just pictured Itachi smiling and crying and whatnot. *shakes head*<br /><br />Ahhh and Sasuke. I am seriously starting to.............*cries* No, <strong>GO-MEN. I cannot dislike Sasuke</strong>. He's my darling stupid-decision-maker boy. Ahhh he looks good in new chapter.<br /><br />Apart from that, is there any possibility that Sasuke is actually THINKING AHEAD and his foolish decisions are some kind of trap to be put into action later? No?&nbsp; <strong>So, new heart, the hell you'll come into view?<br /></strong><br />-------------------<br /><br />*is now happy*<br /><br />I've been reading <strong>D. GRAY MAN</strong> manga. My first impression? Boring!! Boring chapter 1, chapter 2....and then....I arrived to the chapter where ONE GREAT CHARACTER APPEARS!!<br /><br />And as usual in me, the reason why I love a manga (or at least spend time reading it) is because <strong>I FALL HARD FOR ONE (ONE!!) CHARACTER!&nbsp; </strong>Let me introduce Kanda Yuu, sort-of-co-protagonist in D. Gray Man:&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006k3ze/""><img style=""WIDTH: 129px; HEIGHT: 182px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""174"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006k3ze/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp; <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006prdc/""><img style=""WIDTH: 166px; HEIGHT: 123px"" height=""144"" alt="""" width=""193"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006prdc"" /></a>&nbsp; <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006q28r/""><img style=""WIDTH: 120px; HEIGHT: 188px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""164"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006q28r/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />Pretty guy with the worst attittude and bad-ass personality. Superb fighter and you get the idea, right? With a dark background story and other cliches lying around. Yes, of course I already read all the manga. You know me, obssesive reader. <br /><br />But this one I like! I<strong> even liked the character when I first thought HE was a SHE</strong>. *oooppps*&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh, and the tag line for this entry? Growing a heart?&nbsp;Yeah yeah, that one I read in some fiction story related to Kanda Yuu and other D.G.M. people. And&nbsp;liked it.&nbsp; So... *shrugs* <br /><br />Ahhhh,&nbsp;&nbsp;June 6 is Kanda Yuu's b-day. *snorts* Coincidence Kanda-san? I discovered you so close to your birthday!&nbsp;Omedetou ne.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />*is now sad*<br /><br />I am letting go of some dear traits of myself: <strong>I am drinking coffee</strong>. *cries again* I used to hate the stuff....and now thanks to the damn cold air conditioner of the office, I have to drink vile coffee and even need it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ara ara ara....it's time for me to go shopping and get boxes and boxes of tea, to keep in office and stop this nonsense!! Go away coffee! <strike>I don't hate you, though. I kinda like soft sugary coffee, but damn it I refuse to drink more!&nbsp;<br /><br /></strike>-------------------<br /><br />*is now just plain embarrased*<br /><br />My crush is not giving signs of <strong>GOING AWAY!!!&nbsp; </strong>Not that I want to let go of it .....or him to be specific.....but this is getting ridiculous!!&nbsp; *hearts* And I love it! Har har har!&nbsp;<br /><br />---------------<br /><br /><strong><em>Bye, all. Do take care ne?</em></strong>"

"event","<br />Argh...I can't&nbsp;believe I let myself post in rush only to rant about this.<br /><br />It's gonna be quick anyway.&nbsp;<br /><br />*sighs*<br /><br />I am not liking chapter 402 of <strong>NARUTO</strong> manga....AT ALL.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Summary:&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />1. Itachi was good. Congratulations on being one fucking great actor Itachi.&nbsp;But I don't like you as a good guy, bear with me.&nbsp;<br /><br />2. Sasuke was played like a fool since the beginning. And to top it all....he is a happy camper and will&nbsp;allow himself to be manipulated AGAIN. Go Sasuke, become more miserable if&nbsp;you insist.<br /><br />Still, that&nbsp;scene with Sasuke crying over realizing he DID kill his brother&nbsp;who loved him to the most&nbsp;absurd extremes....that broke my heart.&nbsp;<br /><br />But more than sad, I am disappointed at this story twist. And at Sasuke. I still like him and think his loses -and the truth behind those loses- make him a very complex character who is not in his right state of mind. The poor idiot thing.<br /><br />Ahhh I hope Kishimoto&nbsp;either rescue his character or just outright kill him in a somehow good way.<br /><br /><strike>But that was exactly what I wished about Severus Snape...and his death.....*growls* Don't remind of the unfairness of it......<br /></strike><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""THAT scene with tears...""><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006g17q/""><img height=""233"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006g17q/s320x240"" /></a><br />&nbsp;When Sasuke remembers Itachi's last words before Itachi dies...<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006h6q6/""><img height=""234"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006h6q6/s320x240"" /></a><br />And cries at the realization that his brother did it all for him...<br /><br />Still....I think the plot is so very absurd, the way the plot explained Itachi's couse of actions was illogical.<br /><br />There were like&nbsp; 3 different options in which Itachi could have acted, but he had to choose the worst one that had him killing<br />his family and traumatizing/targeting his brother?<br /><br />For the sake of the story.....of course Itachi had to take that path.&nbsp;Marthyr and all that.<br /><br />But I don't have to like it, do I?&nbsp;Because Itachi seemed to me much more intelligent, cunning and all in all capable to take wise decisions.<br /><br />And now, what do we have? A dead older brother with an spectacular hero/villain past who took a stupidly rash decision AND a younger brother who is taking another horrendous course of action.<br /><br />*sighs again*<br /><br /></div>&nbsp;<br />Please Sasuke, turn against Madara when you come back to your senses, ok?&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>*signs out*<br /></strong></em>"

XXDDD&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, actually I returned from the trip like 2 weeks ago, but I've been buried in papers - the afterwards horror of writing hundreds of reports has ensued.&nbsp;<br /><br />And I've also been traveling to the neighbouring countries, since work hasn't stopped at all!!! LOL&nbsp; Mother calls me ""<em><strong><font color=""#3366ff"">the little traveling ant""&nbsp;<br /><br /></font></strong></em>But now I want to stay home for awhile. It's tiring, this going back and forth all the time. I arrived yesterday, I stay one day in my country, then I leave again the following day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Pffiiuuuu!!! And you might be thinking: ""ungrateful kid! traveling is great!""&nbsp;<br /><br />I agree!! But the problem is that these travels of mine are BY LAND!! It's going and coming by car around 8 hours to reach one place, and then move on some more.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would be willing to start another long trip only if...if <strong><font color=""#333399"">I CAN GO TO JAPAN AGAIN</font></strong>!!!!! XXXXDDDDDDDDD&nbsp;<br /><br />*sighs* I'm love, you'll have to forgive me.&nbsp;<br /><br />In other news, I am following my regular <font color=""#00ccff""><strong>manga</strong>:</font> Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles, Naruto and Ouran Host Club.&nbsp;<br /><br />1.<strong><u> TRC</u>=</strong> no important updates. Boring Shaoran and boring Sakura only. *misses Fai terribly, is only happy that the splash features Fai again*&nbsp;<br /><br />2. <strong><u>Naruto=</u></strong> ouch. More story behind Itachi's death? Please DO NOT tell me he was a good guy!!! It would be such a lame plot-twist! I like Itachi as the bastard villain just fine!! He&nbsp;was perfect&nbsp;in his evil glory! AHHH don't ruin my beloved bad guys!!&nbsp;But hey, as long as the story keeps featuring Sasuke *whom half the world hate but I like* ......<br /><br />3. &nbsp;<strong><u>Ouran Host Club</u>=</strong> *whails* Ahhhh Tamaki!! Ahhh Lord!!! Tama-chan!! I love you so much! I almost cried when in the last chapter the other guys -Kyoya Oh brilliant Kyoya- explain how Tamaki refuses to approach love by himself due to his past. Such a sad thing! The last picture of Tamaki with his doggie and that sad smile on his face! It killed me! Please more Tamaki time!!!&nbsp;I need to email <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://forgottendiary.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://forgottendiary.livejournal.com/""><b>forgottendiary</b></a></div>&nbsp;so we can chat about this!!! <br /><br />And <strong><font color=""#808080"">NEW</font></strong> in my data base is the manga/anime series <font color=""#800000""><strong>TRINITY BLOOD</strong></font>. I bumped into it by mere coincidence, but I like <strong><em>Abel Nightroad ""shinpu-sama""</em></strong> so much!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Now that I am reading the manga (damn hard to find since it's licensed and banned from most sites) I can see that this Abel is a mix of several other characters I like of other manga: something of Tsuzuki Asato (from Yami no Matsuei) something of Vash Stampede (from Trigun but not so idiotic) something&nbsp;of Arucard (from Hellsing) and even a small reference to Chrnos (from Chrnos Crusade).&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyhow, I am working in my <strong>""Chronicles of May in Japan""</strong> but I have so many photos that I don't know which to put up. Ahhh I hope to have some time to post again this weekend.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Until then, take care! Mata ne!</em>"

Everything about it is thrilling and captivating. The sounds and the dark themes and the sad purity of the story.<br /><br />And even though it is not a completely original idea for a plot, the movie is superb. The unknown actors and actresses are nearly perfect.<br /><br />And the monsters scared me to an inch of my life. Not because of extreme horrifying features or because of the extreme abundance of blood -it was shocking, the short-lived but arresting violence- but because these monsters -or more realistically THE monster (in singular)&nbsp; is so weird and moves so awkardly.&nbsp;<br /><br /><p align=""center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006eezw/""><img height=""217"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006eezw/s320x240"" /></a></p><br />I love the detail that in the middle of the movie, the child protagonist told a fairy tale to her unborn brother: such a dark thing, a story of sacrifices and loneliness and eternal death/inmortality.&nbsp;The fable of a single graceful rose blooming in the pitches of hell.<br /><br />When I saw that part, I already knew, that the ending was going to be a beautifully sad one, because&nbsp;Pan's Labyrinth beauty is based in the odd but exquisite things hidden among shadows.&nbsp;<br /><br /><p align=""center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006fqc7/""><img height=""224"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006fqc7/s320x240"" /></a></p><br /><br />"

"event","<br />Ahhh today has been such a chaos!! I was in tears just a couple of minutes ago in the office.<br /><br />Literally. I was crying, sitting at my desk.&nbsp;As usual, no one's at the office at this hour. It's 06:25 pm.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love my work and I don't mind working late. I don't mind working hard.&nbsp;<br /><br />But today there was a confusion that had as a result one of my almost-boss, a lady who I respect very much and consider a friend- Mrs. V called me and implied this:<br /><br /><em><strong>""I can not believe that you are being so irresponsible""<br /></strong></em><br />I was left speechless. I tried to explain the situation: I was sent to the mission against my agreement.<br /><br />Of course I didn't want to go, I have tons of things to do back here at the office. I didn't want to go to a mission to climb up a mountain when work is still pending. But my boss-san asked me to go, and maybe he forgot that we had previously agreed that I DID NOT WANT TO GO, DAMN IT.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, Mrs. V calls me to order me to return to the office to do my proper work and not waste time.&nbsp;I felt really bad. Even if I explained, things still weren't very clear, since my boss who gave me the order to go is out of the country.&nbsp;<br /><br />So here, back at the office, working hard and late and alone as usual, I was crying and feeling miserable.&nbsp;<br /><br />But then I opened a mail from my mother and found this:<p align=""center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006cakg/""><img style=""WIDTH: 48px; HEIGHT: 323px"" height=""240"" alt="""" width=""32"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006cakg/s320x240"" /></a></p><br />And I felt very happy and thought:&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><font size=""3"">""Of course I am being protected. This is so very damn small in comparison of so many good tihngs GOD has given me.&nbsp;<br /><br />Somebody loves me and somebody protects me all the time""<br /></font></strong><br />And now I have a smile on my face. <br /><p align=""center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006cakg/""></a></p>"

"event","I've been meaning to post and rant about this.<br /><br />""This"" meaning ""manga"" LOL XDDD<br /><br />First: Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles= Beautiful splash cover of the last chapter.&nbsp; Dedicated to both Kurogane and Fai.<br /><br />However.....I can't help but focus on how damn sad is Fai in this splash. For TRC readers, whenever we had a splash featuring Fai we saw a myriad of expressions:<br /><br />During the beginning of this manga, Fai was always smiling = splash with smiles. Then we got hints of Fai hiding something horrible about his past = splash with secretive smiles. Then it came the Celes Arc and we got the eerie truth= splash with serious expressions or vampiric ones.&nbsp;<br /><br />But in this splash Fai's features hit me as the first time that -ON THE COVER- he is displayed wearing a honest sad face. Zoom and focus if you want to check. *sighs*<br /><br /><p align=""center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006aa4f/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""167"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006aa4f/s320x240"" /></a></p><p align=""left""><br /><br />Second: Naruto manga. It's a massacre of fans versus fans LOL XXDD<br /><br />Half the fandom is kicking and screaming about Sasuke's time on the spotlight. The other half is holding their breath. I am just glad that we finally get to see his fight with aniki Itachi. Who turned out to be a complete bastard in the end.<br /><br />I had thought that maybe Itachi was doing all this -being a royal ass and murderer etc- in some twisted effort to help ototo Sasuke with SOMETHING ANYTHING.&nbsp;<br /><br />But nope. ""I pretended to be a good brother but the truth is, my foolish brother, that I just want to pluck out your eyes 'cause mine are almost blind by now""<br /><br />Ouch. No more smiles or hope from this manga either. But I am damn proud on how Sasuke took the whole revelation, so calm and collected! (finally!!)&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p align=""center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006b8x9/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""164"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/may_unleashed/pic/0006b8x9/s320x240"" /></a></p><p align=""left""><br /><br />Not much from other manga such as Loveless or Ouran Host Club. I am considering to start reading other manga, but I am not sure which would be good. Hmmmmmmmmmm....<br /><br />SMILES are present regarding my thesis project! We are advancing =DDDD&nbsp;<br /><br />SMILES are present regarding my job and future trip to Asia =DDD We'll stay in Japan 4 days and we'll get to go to Akihabara!!! </p>"

No concerts and manga-trips!&nbsp;<br /><br />BUT I DON'T CARE BECAUSE I WANT TO GO!!!<br /><br />Jesus Christ!&nbsp; How did this happen?!<br /><br />So boss-san says:<br /><br /><strong><em>Boss: Make arrangements for a mission to Indonesia and Thailand, for 6 people during 8 days.&nbsp;<br /><br />Me: Ok.

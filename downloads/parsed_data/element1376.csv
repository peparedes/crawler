"event","today was completely mortifying.  got out of school at 10 adam picked me up infront of the school we talked a little about the funeral he dropped me off at jordans, i was so releved to see her it was like i could breath agin after having a plastic bag around my lungs. we shortly left to the funeral her in the most adorable pin stripped suit with greenish blue tank underneath me stupidly wearing a skirt  white short sleeve shirt and my chucks. we arrived not so descreatly but silently to find ourselfs under a lil tent thing the grey coffin in front of us almost like a death bead for our hearts waiting patiently for the tears to clens it. we where all crying almost as soon as we got there. theres something about watching ur closest friend cry that makes you cry two times as badly. me and jordan clung to each other staying close to let our consouse know that if we where to colapse out of gref they would be there to pick  the other up.  the cerimonie began and soon all of her japaness friends had a chant that help her soul pass to the other life and offered her  prayers in her new life.  some how even though in a different language i could understand every word they where saying. once agin it fell silent and the rain poured down harder and louder then befor  the sound almost defening but no one seemed to flinch or more or ever blink, we where all focused.    i think no matter how cold it got out there it would not have mattched how cold we felt inside.  i looked at her family the almost unbareable sadness i saw on everyone of there faces words can not describe. my eyes feel upon papa pike, ekois husband. though he was not crying the expression on his face was much  sadder then crying much deper then the greatest sarrow you cant even imagine,  more probably  then you will ever experience in your life. everyone cryed and cryed her friends chanted and chanted  some cryed and chanted.  when the funeral was over we went to the reception. this was were everyone put  up a strong front and smiled for the good of everyones health. the food we good the people were great.                    


The idea that life and death are two is the reasoning of dreams, deluded and inverted. 
 If, when awake, we examine our true nature, we will find noo beginning that requires our being born and no end that requiers our dying 
What we will find is the essence of life, which can not be burned by apocalyptic flames, worn away by flood, cut by sword, nor pierced by arrow... 
People, confused by their minds, fail to understand and awaken to the true, 
transcendental nature of there lives...

"event","a crazy old man came and layed down next to me at the park today while i was on my lunch break. he came over to me as a layed down on the grass and asked me if all the kids (there were at least ten of them) on the play structure were mine. at first he was just laying there, and out of the corner of my eye i could see him sit up and look over at me every so often. every once in a while he would ask me something, and while he was laying there he kept farting and he would randomly laugh, even when we weren't talking. 
after about ten minutes of just laying there like that, he started talking and just would not SHUT UP. he went off on religion and abortion, and the vietnam war, and music all in the 15 minutes i could stand laying near him. he said i should move to santa barbara where he lives, and later said we should move to georgia together since that's where neutral milk hotel is from, and because he had a full tank of gas.  he would be rambling at 897436 words per minute, randomly throw a question in there, and not even pause for me to answer. 
it was kind of funny until he saw my fry's badge and started talking about coming to see me at work.  i don't doubt that he will either, he was pretty nutty."

Unbeknownst to the passengers in the third car of the train, riders had already gained access to the locomotive and killed both engineers.  The freight cars were being looted, including the Wells Fargo payroll intended for a mine up the way.  There was a livestock car with a load of fine horses from Kentucky.  The whooping and hollering of the Kelly gang increased with each killing and each discovery of valuable profit.

""It looks like they have a dozen men.  We have six men and some whores, Clay.""  Mills was nothing if not grim when stating the obvious.  He had taken a kneeling position near the front of the car, with Call on the opposite side of the small space.  Defending the car would be difficult if the men rushed it.  Likely they could lose over half of their number.  The one quadroon whore was dead, with a flow of blood staining the varnished wood of the floor.  The little Chinese girl was laying on her belly, under the seat Mosby was opposite of.  Her black eyes blinked up at the man who had bought her contract from the slave trader who had brought her from the docks in San Francisco.  Mosby looked at the girl, trying to be reassuring in the half smile he gave her.  Inwardly, Mosby was assessing the facts of the situation.  He could try to buy their way out, but most of the money he had brought had already been spent back in Abilene.  Call rarely had more that ten dollars to his name, and Mills was in no financial shape to be any help.  The women could be offered up, but Mosby's deeply rooted sense of honor and chivalry wouldn't allow using women for that purpose.

Call was evaluating, while Mosby and Mills were doing the same.  His muscles were tight, from both the anticipation and from the long travel.  He flexed is fingers, before returning them back to the trigger of his sawed off gun.  He was impressed with Lilly, who had shown no fear or ladylike vapors when handling the Winchester.  He was more likely to fight with her than the farmer boys, who were uselessly holding pistols they had probably only fired at snakes and rabbits for the stew pot.

""Mosby, they can't know how many we got in here.  If we go out there, we're dead for sure.  We make them come in here, for a reason, we might have a chance.  We can pick them off one by one as they come through the door.""  Call rubbed his face, thinking.  ""We just need something to lure them, something they want enough to rush in for.""

Lilly laughed and pulled off her jacket, then released her pinned up hair.  ""Boys, those outlaws all want the same thing.  Money, whiskey and a good fuck.  Looks like they found the money.""  Out the window, the men were opening the leather satchel containing the payroll, and dancing jigs while shooting their pistols up in the air.  Lilly's long, pale blonde curls would show up nicely in the moonlight.  ""I'll invite the gentlemen in.  Ladies, get your asses up off the floor and make your faces known.  If they think it's just whores in here, they'll be right neighborly, before they kill us all.""

Jane rose, slowly, watching Lilly march down the aisle to the door.  She signaled the other women to rise, and to look out the windows.  ""Don't smile.  Just look scared and helpless.  Make them think we're whipped.""

""That shouldn't be too hard.""  Miranda got up and sat hard on the seat.  The men were tucked into corners without windows.  John and Call had rifles trained on the rear door to the car, while Mosby and the farmer boys trained on the front.

""<b>Don't Shoot!  Boys!  Gentlemen!  Hello!</b>""  Lilly stood, one sleeve of her camisole down off her shoulder, half baring one delicious breast.  ""Hi, there, ooh, aren't you a handsome one?  Boys, I'm not armed.  It's just us working girls here on our way to Curtis Wells.  We're Twyla's new girls.  Y'all know Twyla?  Looks like you boys got some money to spend.  I don't suppose you gentlemen would be interested in coming into our car here for a bit of a ride?""

Ebner Kelly laughed at the brazen harlot.  His filthy red hair hung lank down over his eyes.  ""Looky there, Slim.  A car full of whores to make this a perfect night.""

Slim was bald, with a scruffy gray beard matted with dirt and blood.  ""I don' like it, Eb.  Les' jus' kill them whores and go on down away from here.  There's plenty of whorehouses along the trail.""

""Now why should we pay right good gold for whores, when we can enjoy them right here?""  Ebner stepped off his horse, and then signalled for his boys to go up and check the girl for weapons.  When they found none, he turned to Slim, happy.  ""A train car of fresh harlots, just there for our pleasure.  I say it's providence, brother.  Let's enjoy their charms.""  He pulled out a twelve inch blade Bowie, and grinned as it glinted in the pale light of the moon.  ""Then we slit their pretty throats after we fuck them all raw.""

Slim reluctantly nodded, even though the hair on the back of his neck was standing up.  ""Fine.  But hurry up about it.  Someone's gonna come looking for this train when it don' make the next stop, Eb.  So git in there and rut them bitches, then let's git.""

The men all moved towards the car, whooping and pushing Lilly inside ahead of them.  As she came through the door, Lilly grinned at the women who were visible in the seats.  ""Look here, girls, what I found.  Some cowboys need lovin' and ain't that just our specialty?""

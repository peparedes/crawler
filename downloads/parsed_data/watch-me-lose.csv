I got my mom a book called ""The secrets of the red hat ladies"" or something like that, she loves to see those ladies around town and is interested in them, so this is a good book for her. I got a book for my sister, I think she reads this (do you liz?) so I will only say it caught my eye as something she would like, and when I showed my mom she said OH! That was a great pick, I want to read it too.  I got 12 mini christmas books for Emily, they come in a little box to play with, very cute. 
I have decided to go to Old Navy and get this coat I have been thinking about for Emily's birthday. Anthony has a $10 off coupon there, so if he gives me that I think the coat will only be about $15. http://www.oldnavy.com/asp/Product.asp?wdid=600&wpid=263466
Now I just need a gift for her mom's birthday, maybe a maternity top (she's 6 months pregnant.) And a gift for Ryan. 

My nail broke last night. It only happens when this one girl does my nails, I am gonig to get it fixed and make sure someone else does it. I also got a french manicure, and it has only been a week and the polish is rubbing off, so I'll need a polish change. 

Anthony told me this morning that he thinks his parents will be over on saturday to see his place, they have never been there. Yikes! We haven't cleaned in weeks, we will have to do a power clean on friday night."

Ah, it's nice to know that after today I don't have to be back to work till Monday. I had a half day yesturday to go to the doctors. They told me that the aspiritme (sp) in diet coke/pepsi is affecting my headaches! I have to drink real coke or water ofcourse. The doctors office was unusually fast, this was my first time at this office and I have now decided I am officially changing my specialist to them, great customer service. After, I went to get a pedicure at Avente's a swanky spa. I had wine and read Angela's Ashes while the poor lady scrubbed my feet. Ah, it's nice to be papmered. Then I went to my nail shop and got my nails done and eyebrows waxed (too expensive at the spa). Then I went to Old Navy, it was packed, I had to exchange a gift I got Anthony's nephews, I got the wrong sizes. Then I went to the grocery store because I was out of contact soution. I also got cleaner, I have gum stuck to my car seat! And I can't find anything to get it off with. I now am sitting on top of a plastic bag!  Hopefully this new stuff works. I was going to work on cleaning it off after work today but now it is pouring outside, so maybe Friday?

My car is fine and I had a nail in the tire, but I took it to the shop this morning and they fixed it-for free!

Well, this morning the alarm went off at 6, then 6:15 then I hit snooze one more time for 6:30, next thing I know it's 7:15 and Anthony is yelling he's cold, I took the covers. OMG! I have to be at work at 8:00 and I'm about an hour's drive away. Needless to say I jumped up threw the covers at anthony and ran for the door. Yuck, no time for a shower, but no one sees me at work anyway. So I made it (drove like a deamon) and made it with time to stop for coffee. 

Last night Anoth ny took me to the Melting Pot, a fondue resturant that he loves. It is so overpriced, but it is yummy. We actually went there on Thursday too, and he was still craving it friday so we made another reservation! I'll be full for days. 

Today we are planning to go to his sister's house to see her and her kids, we haven't seen them in 2 weeks, and that's probably a record. We are planning to have dinner there, Anthony loves her baked ziti. Then we are going to the movies with Liz and Nick to see National Treasure, I just love Nic Cage, I always have he's so sexy! I fell in love with him while watching Con Air years ago (hair extentions and all!) Did you know he just went shark diving with his new wife? Anyway, the movie will be great because he's in it. Have you ever noticed that in every movie he makes he has sex with at least one girl and always has a shirtless shot. I don't think I've seen him in a movie that hasn't, ok maybe birdie, no I think in that too.

Anywho. Next week is Thanksgiving. My mom signed us up to wrap books at Barns and Noble on Black Friday! I'll have to let you know how it goes. It's for Home of the Sparrow. We'll sit at a tabel outside the store, and people can pay to have their books wrapped, and the donations go to home of the sparrow. The funny thing is my mom and sister can not wrap gifts to save their life! This will be interesting."

I have decided to request off Dec. 20-22. We get a paid holiday from the 23rd to Janary 3rd-a nice perk for working for a university. I just would rather have the whole week off of christmas to chill and do holiday things, I don't want to be stressed out the entire week and then wham, christmas at the end of it. I hope my request gets approved soon. 

My niece's birthday is the first week of December, it's going to stink for her, because she will probably get jipped on christmas gifts. Plus her mom's birthday is christmas eve!

"event","Last night I went to my local hallmark. I had gotten a gift card in the mail because I have the gold card and I'm always buying cards. Ok. I pick out my three cards, a Sympathy card for my friend (his granddad died) a christmas card for anthony and a Hannukah card for his parents. I get to the counter and the 40ish year old lady at the counter says I can't buy a hanukkah card with this gift card. It has to be a Hallmark card and the hanukkah card is a ""tree of life card"".
 
Here's where I flip my lid. 

The sympathy card was hallmark gold crown, the christmas card was a shoebox card (you know...a tiny little division of hallmark) and the hanukkah card was tree of life...a division of hallmark! it even says hallmark on the back of the card. They refused to give it to me with the gift card and told me I was welcome to pay full price for the card, no duh! I said that's crazy I'll look for one that is ""hallmark"" well, all hanukkah cards are tree of life cards. 

I found one card, one in the whole freaking store that was not a tree of life but a shoebox card, this was not the same feeling of card, the first was centimental and the shoebox was a rude joke about speaking hebrew. I go back to the counter and they say oh, good you found something. I continued to point out that Shoebox is not a hallmark card but a division, just like tree of life, so why is shoebox counted? The woman said ""because I'm new and I don't know"" so I asked for a manager. There wasn't one, just another employee who said she was new too, but they'd ask the manager in the morning so they know for next time. I wanted to scream! 

I am writing a letter to hallmark. I used to work at one way back when, so I know that tree of life is a hallmark card. It was just so rude, how they kept saying, I could buy another christmas card, just not a hanukkah card. I'm not jewish and I was completly offended at this. I got the three cards (the bad hanukkah card) and let for angry and annoyed!

Any ideas on how to start my letter?

Today we are supposed to find out if my brother and his wife are having a boy or a girl. I can't wait, it's too exciting. They already have a girl, Emily. And I think they are going to have another girl, but who knows.

It feels like a wednesday, which is good, beacuse it is Thursday so the week will go faster. I have to work this Saturday, yuck! I dread getting up early. 

Anthony is doing a little better. I am going to see him tonight. 

The year is flying by! There are exactly 2 weeks till Thanksgiving. then there's Emily's birthday, and the Holiday Party at work, then Hanukkah then christmas then new years! Geeze! I remember last January like it was yesturday.

Work is so busy, I guess because I was out for a week, I have so much to do, and have big projects that I truly have set on the back burners and not are getting ready to boil over. It is also almost graduation time, so I've got the stressful job of making sure all these grad students are ready and have the right courses, doing audits is so time consuming."

Saturday we overslept, got up and went ot my parents house. We carved pumpkins and made caramel apples with the family it was fun. Then we high tailed it back to Bucks county and went to a costume party with his sister and brother in law. The party was awesome. I myself got smashed and had a blast.

Iwas so drunk, I don't really remember much except that the pope hit on me in front of Anthony, it was great.

I never understand this, I order catering for my department. Well, today we have a meeting with 24 attendees. So my boss had me order for 28. 2 people were no shows, but that just means my coworker and I could eat too. The issue is that there is always a ton of food left over because our caterer is cool, and he always hooks me up. I never know the true head count because I am just told to order for X number of people, I didn't know I was ordering for 28 when there were only 24 invited. The ironic thing is the meeting is to develop was to cut cost on campus...hum...maybe order less food?"

So I'm sound asleep and the phone rings, it's 1 am...It's Anthony and a tooth just fell out of his mouth! OMG I was terrrified, can you say tommyknockers! He doesn't know what happened he was watching football and pop the tooth broke in half and came right out. He had a root canal done last year and didn't get it crowned, so maybe it's that tooth? He wasn't sure, he could feel the sharp edge of the peice still intact but could not tell me for sure what tooth it was. He said he was in no pain and had called him mom who told him to call the dentist in the morning. I called him this morning and he still wasn't in pain and was going to call the dentist, now he's not answering his phone. When he went to the doctor yesturday and they gave him a cough medicine with codine, so maybe he's so drugged that he doesn't feel the pain.

But they were all out. So he got me Raising Helen. This was a great feel good movie, I even shed a tear, ofcourse I was tired and probably delierious, but it was a great movie. I had to watch it with Anthony sneezing and weezing in the background, I honestly think he is done being sick, but he just continues to act sick because he gets attention. Finally I told him to go to the living room, I just could not hear the movie. 
Then at 5 we got ready and went to his parents house, I haven't seen them in a month, which is a record for us. They just redid their kitchen cabinets and they look awesome, they now have the microwave attached to the wall, I love with style, so it's not sitting on the counter. Then we headed to his sister's house, her husband was working late. Anthony ordered everyone Outback take out, yum! Actually it was horrible! We called ahead and they do curbside pick up. Well, when Ant got there they came out and said we don't have swordfish, we'll give you grouper instead! so he called to check if that was ok, and we said yes because there was really no other option, then they go back in and 30 minutes later come out with the food and said oh, by the way we are out of baked potatoes!what the%%^#? That's the side, how can they be out? So they gave us no substitute for the potato. The fries were soggy and wilted, it was just not good. So we have now banned curbside. From now on we will dine in.
Anyway, I got to play with PJ and Shane, Ant's nephews. I love them so much, I guess I just really love kids, having a teaching degree and all, but when kids are related to you, it's just great. I helped with their baths and snacks they are too cute! They are just learning to play with each other and it's adorable. 
Today after work. I am going dress shopping with my mom, sister and the other bridesmaids. Then back to Anthony's. 
Back to work, have to get these kids admitted!"

Now I'm back at work and feel better but my ears are clogged, and there is something wrong with the heating system so it is ungodly hot in here and I am wearing a heavy sweater, it's making me tired again. Oh well, I am of course the only one in the office today. At least I am leaving at 2 so I might be able to take a nap when I get to Anthony's.

"event","So last night after work I went to the mall to get new glasses. As soon as I walked into Lenscrafters I found the ones I wanted, and that never happpens. So they take my measurements and say come back in and hour. I walked around the mall, but the mall is no fun when you have no money for shopping. So I finally got my glasses nad I like them, I had better for the price they were. I used them to drive to work today and found that they are a good prescription. They are stronger than my contacts so I have to get used to them. But I can't wear them when I'm on the computer because I'm not used to them yet.
After the mall I went to Anthony's he didn't get home till about 10:00 and he complained that he was sick, so I made him soup and he went to bed. What an exciting homecoming that was. I had to keep handing him tissues all night, not very romantic. I am probably going to see him tonight too. Hopefully he starts to feel better because he is having his wisdom teeth pulled next week and they won't do it if he's sick.

His friend who drove them both to NC took his video camera to do a documentary of their trip, so I'll get to see a little of what went on. Last night he called around 12 and said they had all gone out for a celebration drink, but I think he meant to say drinks, as none of them sounded coherent on the phone. Either way, I'll be happy to have him home.

I have been looking for a place to get my new eye glasses that takes NVA. Well, I just read on my company website that if you go to a place that doesn't take my insurance you can submit your receipt and they will pay what the insurance would have paid. So it doesn't really matter where I go. In that case, I am going to lenscrafters after work because you get glasses fast there."

Last month I sent away for new checks, not from my bank, but from checks unlimited. well, I'm ticked. I have worked with them before and always been happy. This time is different. I sent in my check to pay for the checks and a voided check. Well, it has been a month to date and I have not gotten my checks, they also have not cashed my check. I called today and they looked it up and had no record of my check so the lady said it probably got lost in the mail. Here's my dilema, if I cancel the two checks I sent them it will cost me $60 from my bank! (30 per check) if I let it go, I may never have the checks cashed and never get my new checks in the mail.  What to do? the check I sent them was only for $11, and the voided one says VOID in sharpie all over it. so no one could cash them except the place. What should I do?

finally we got a new furnace! Last night after work I came home and the furnace men had just left. I went up to my room which is normally a sweat box when the heat is on and it was now an icecicle! I think it must have just needed time, because now my room is nice and toasty and not a sweat box. Way to go furnace people, and just in time, the rain is enough to make your bones shake. 

Does anyone have a recomendation for where to get new eye glasses? I am going to call around and see who takes NVA. But just looking for rants or raves about a place, I always were contacts that I get for free. But especially in the winter, I oversleep and mondays are usually glasses days for me :-)

"event","Last night was crazy. I can't believe I'm up and at work. 
We are getting a brand new furnace and heating system this morning, we had a gas leak in our old one and just found it when we had the county come turn it on for the winter. So with this new system we have to move our cabinets away from the dining room walls so they can install pipes etc. Well, they are going to be here at 8:30am so we had to get a move on the moving. But, alas, my mom had also promised my brother we would babysit so in the middle of all the moving going on, we've got a 10 month old running around checking everything out. I have to tell you, I think his child is a mensa baby. She just turned 10 months, so really she is 10 months, 5 days old. Ok, she crawls, walks, run, has lots of hair, climbs up and down the steps on her own, follows directions (like give me your giraffe)She also has a huge vocabulary, she says mom, dad, help, uh-oh, go, and last night she said kitty for the first time! 

Back to the college students. I am sound asleep and I get woken up at 2:10am to the sound of drunk college kids yelling so loud. I look outside and 4 guys and a girl are sitting on the porch across/down the street. This one guy was so freaking loud. He kept yelling, about being an American and how nothing changes and blah blah blah and every other word was F*** this and F*** in the country. Basically drunk talk, then they decide to start yelling about black people, and nigger this and nigger that...and why can they vote... I thought for sure my neighbor was going to go outside and shoot them. we live in a mostly black/spanish neighborhood. I thought about calling the cops and asking them to come make them quite, but then I realized I used to be a drunk college kid too way back in the day. So I tried to sleep, but to no avail. Finally after 15 minutes of how the world would be better with out blacks, someone did come out and shut them up. I don't know what went down, but they went into their house and only the 2 quite guys stayed on the porch. It really stinks to live on a street with all college kids. Of course the tables were turned when I was younger and got to go to the colege parties, boy I'm getting old. After they got quiet it still took me about 2 hours to fall backto sleep."

"event","My week started off with a bang, literally. I was driving through town and was stuck in traffic and I start to pull forward and my car won't go. I had just cut someone off (my normal road rage) and I see in my mirror the guy geting out of his car! Oh god, he's going to kill me, right? Nope, he starts pointing at the front of my car, I get out and there is a river or red fluid running from my car. we're in bumper to bumper traffic and he is screaming over the noise to tell me my transmission fluid just fell out, he though it was an amazing site to see it happen. He says if I drive any farther I will ruin my car and I should get it towed. So I pull off the road into a parking lot and they guy pulls over to. By now my car will not reverse or  He must have been sent from god becuase I don't know jack about my car. He said he was a mechanic and wanted to know if I had a way to get my car towed or did I want to use his cell, I have AAA so I said I'll call them, we talked he told me it was an amazing site to see the whole car flush like that.  I think he knew I was upset and asked if I wanted him to check under the hood, I said ok. This guy was so nice, he said about a cars length away from me and had his hands up so  I could see them, he kept saying you don't have to do anything I suggest... I think he must have a daughter because he knew I shouldn't be talking to him. Anyway I call AAA and they say they are coming. I decide to have my car towed to this guys shop, ofcouse they are closed on Sundays. It was about 1 mile away so I didn't have to pay AAA anything. The guy asked if I wanted him to wait for the tow truck or if I needed a ride or if he could call me a cab etc. Really this guy was so nice I thought it was odd, you don't see too many genuinly honest people in my town. So he leaves and the car gets towed. so I call my family for a ride. no one is home! I had to then walk home, about 3 miles, in my flip flops.
Ok, I call and leave a message at the mechanics that my car is there and can they take a look and call me. As soon as I get to work (Liz has been driving me) they call and say the door to my car is locked and they can't find a key! So I run over (thanks to Liz) and give them the spare, they look through the car and can't finds the original. So back at work I call AAA, they say oh yeah the driver says he left it. Ok, I go round and round with them and on tuesday they decide they will foot the bill for a new key-yeah! The whole time I am thinkng my trans is broke and I'll need a new one. I finally get a call on wednesday that it is my radiator, long story, but I say go ahead and fix it. And keep the old one for me to look at. They fixed it that day and stayed open late so I could pick it up. I also got a call from the tow place apppoligizing, the driver found my key in his pants! and they made him hand deliver it to my mechanic and appoligize to them too. So now everything is fixed, and Anthony has offered to pay me the $500 it cost for the radiator. I thin khe feels bad because he is in NC and all th is happened and it was a stressful week. 





Jump back to wed. morning: liz and I are on our way to work and I ask to stop for coffee. I'm getting my coffee and liz is getting hot water for tea, and then it happened, she sat the cup down under the water spout and hit on, and the boiling water misses the cup and goes all over her hand! she screams, I run over, her hand is red...she decides to go to work and just put ketchup on it for the burn.(a greek remedy) Then it takes a turn for the worse. she calls me from her office and says she can't hold her pen! she comes over and I get some coworker friends to look at it and they say call the dr. well, she already did that and they said they didn't want to see her, that she was basically overreacting. So when I see her hand, after the 15 minutes from when it happened it is much worse, I call the dr's and say you will see her, she is in pain. So Liz decides to skip our morning meeting and go home, thank god. She gets home and our mom is there and when she sees her hand (30 min after the accident) she said they are going to the ER. So they go and liz has bad 2nd degree burns. She has to ice her hand and put creame on it and bandage it 2 times a day. he hand is wrapped like a mummy. She is not back to work yet, and is still in much pain. I had to change her bandages last night, and he hand is many different colors.

At least one cool thing happened this week, Anthony met Kathy Ireland at the the furniture market! But that's a whole different entry."

People think large familes are great, but I have 8 aunts and 1 uncle that are still alive, and they are have kids, and grand kids and on and on, the family tree looks more like a forest!

Well, we pull up and the inside lights are on, but something looks weird, there are no outside lights on. They are closed for construction! Oh, Anthony was upset, I think he had been dreaming about his meal all day, and that is depressing to know you have to pick something else. So we went to our favorite pizza  resturant, the name is Graememeam (or something close) and we always call it something different because we are never sure of the correct name, and it's funner to make up names. I think we had a better time than if we went to TGIF, plus you get 2 movie tickets with you pizza so we are thinknig of going to the movies saturday, any idea what we should see? we saw the forgotten last week, it was ok, Anthony took a nap, he wasn't too thrilled with it."

Put butter and sugar on thin toast and then put it in the toaster which ended in the toaster burning. Ate my WW bagels that I had hidden in a drawer(this really ticked me off). Ruined a load of my laundry and making the water and soap overflow into a nice little flood, resulting in me having to rewash everything after cleaning up. He did a load of laundry but didn't add detergent, I am still trying to figure out from the smell what he put in the wash instead.

Happy Yom Kippur early, and have fun breaking your fast tom. night. 

A few days ago George Bush was right up the street from my work, giving a speeck and now John Kerry is here, PA will be a torn state. At least we haven't seen any bad traffic from the visits in my area. 

Anyone watching the new show Medical Investigation? I love that show, I have been taping it so I can watch on sundays, it just interests me so much.

Well, AR is over, I am glad Chip and Kim won the race, they really held in, being the oldest to win I think, and the first married couple too. I saw in the TV guide that the next AR starts in two weeks. This makes no sense to me, they aren't giving time for people to get interested agian, don't get me wrong I will be watching, but it seems too soon. Oh, I can't wait for the Mole to return, and not a celebrity one, I want a real show. 

My thoughts on Joey v Friends. I have decided I am going to watch Joey, some may think it's not a great show, but I think it has promise, and they are just getting into the cast of characters, I'll watch the season and see how it turns out. 

Sounds like I'm a dork watching all these tv shows :-)

For those of you that don't know we found out last week that my sister in law is having a second baby! I'll be an aunt again. As for my niece emily, she is 9 months old and started to walk fully this week! She's adorable, not that I'm bias but she says ""mom"" and ""help"" and ""dad"" and ""go"" and ""uh, oh!"" and ""baba"" (bottle) all in the right context too!  Being a trained early childhood teacher myself I think this is amazing. She's so funny she'll drop a doll on the floor look over at it and say Uh Oh. 

Only 3 more hours of work! And then I'll be back again tomorrow, when will it end."

"event","Yeah, I'm still here---kinda.  I have been working on getting my circadian rhythm under control and that has been very trying.  I have also been mending fences and taking a stand.  As for the taking a stand, I am not going to say much about it.  I will only say that those close to me know how I feel about a certain issue and I have tipped my hand to them.  Out of respect for the people involved, I won't give out any details.  But you know me, I just HAVE to say something, right?

We have ordered a nice recumbent stationary bike so I don't have to worry about getting to and from the gym so there are far fewer excuses for getting the activity I need.  I can do much of the same things I normally do while riding, so it's cool.

I'm not where I want to be but I am much better off than I was this time last year.  

I miss my friends but I know if I spend any more time here than I've been spending, I'll get sucked back into the pit I was in before.  I need to develop my life on this side of the computer and that has meant worrying much less (if at all) about my computer friends.  I do miss you folks, though.  I am not strong enough to spend a healthy amount of time here so I am just going to continue updating when I get the inclination.  I am still not going to read my friends page because I know I will have to make all kinds of comments and then I will succumb to my urges and spend too much time reading/commenting.

I hope that I will be able to build the willpower to find a place in my life for my computer friends but I really need to do what's in my best interest.  Please know that many of you will be in my thoughts and have been in my thoughts this whole time.  I won't go into specifics out of fear of opening a dialogue.  See?  That would be temptation.  I hope that this will suffice for contact with me.  If it doesn't, I can reached by e-mail or phone if you have either.  If you want either just comment and I will tell you how to get in touch with me.

Be well,
Toney"

"event","Well, I was able to dig up a highlight reel of a documentary I was in back in 1992.  If you search YouTube for Singapore The Ultimate Field Trip, you will find it.  Have fun spotting me in it.  I will tell you that I am most easily seen at the end of the reel.

I wonder how the final product turned out.  I was quite a personality then, in a much different way than I am now.  The producer/director told me he was going to make me a big part of it because of my ""unique perspective"".  Based on the highlight reel, that never happened.  I remember all the shooting we did with my commentary on everything and I threw in a little of this and a little of that.  Perhaps the most embarrassing part (which I hope they burned) was me doing a poor imitation of the Wayne's World extreme closeup.  

I had a lot of fun in Singapore and even more fun clowning for the camera.  I was the only boy with long hair and all the Singaporean students called me Andre Agassi because he was the most famous man with long hair at the time.  What you must understand is that Raffles Junior College had/has a very strict dress code for young men.  Hair must be kept short and young men were not allowed to wear sunglasses while in school uniform.  Of course, no one told me this before I put on the RJC t-shirt for the gathering we were having at the college---with the headmaster of the school.

I was so nervous waiting for that luncheon because I was sure I was going to get dressed down by a strict headmaster.  Much to my delight, the headmaster thought it was the greatest thing for a brash, young American to be sporting the RJC t-shirt. He said it illustrated the bridging of the gap between East and West that they were seeking with the Student Ambassador program.  All in all, he was quite taken with me.

I look back on that time in my life very fondly.  I often find myself looking back more than forward.  At this point, my best days are behind me.  That is changing, though. It's taken many years to get to the point where I could decide on the direction of my life but recent events have made matters very clear to me.  I know what I need to do; what my calling is in this life.

For years, my soul has been hurting because I have been so far from my first TRUE love.  The Theatre is my first true love and I need to get back to it.  The majority of my positive memories come from my time in theatre.  That is what I need to do to be happy.  Sure, I probably won't make big, huge bucks but I will be working in a field which rewards me far more than any paycheck ever could.

I have caught glimpses of this truth a few times over recent years but it has never been this strong.  I have recently made contact with parts of my past and the people who share those memories with me and the pull is unmistakable and irresistible.  I look forward to working my way back up to where I was in 1993 and Lesley has already gotten me a few contacts through a colleague of hers.  Best of all, I am back in touch with the man who taught me almost everything I know about tech, theatre and he has welcomed me back with open arms and not the scorn I had imagined he would hold for me.

After blowing such a big opportunity, I was afraid that none of the people from my old theatre would want anything to do with me.  A lot of them aren't even involved in theatre any more but some of them are deeply dedicated to the craft and that has inspired me.  I know I have a long way to go before I can even hope of closing the gap that these years has grown but that journey will be an adventure.  For the first time in a long time, I don't mind being at the bottom looking up.  I know that this is a ladder I can---and will---climb."

"event","Well, Gary (my father-in-law) came over today and we made the connection to the antenna on the first try.  It took us all of five minutes to get hooked up and running.  It took more time to tromp through the snow and unscrew the cable line than it did to do any of the fiddling with connectors and such.  We were able to watch the Divisional Playoffs in HD which was nice for me since I have been so long without locals in HD.  Now, if I only I could get channels from another market.

I was a bit disappointed by the interface of the HD off-air receiver.  Instead of scanning for all receivable channels, I have to input my ZIP code and it provides the tuner with a list of channels I should be receiving.  I was hoping it was like every other tuner I've ever used and I would be able to pull in whatever the antenna can pull in.  I guess I don't really need to worry about it since we get the CW on a subchannel of our local ABC affiliate (I only hope they haven't canceled Reaper).

In other news, Lesley was rear-ended on the highway the other day.  She is all right; just a bit shaken up and sore.  Her car suffered only minor damage.

Not much else going on right now.  I'm just still dealing with insomnia and all its effects on my life.  I haven't broken 300 but I am not losing any weight either.  I need to get back into the gym but I have been half-awake most of the time and that's not a good thing to be when you are getting into a car and planning on exerting yourself, is it?

It's nice to receive comments from you guys.  I need to come around more often.  I think that's something I can work on in the next few weeks or so.  Not much else to say at this time.  Later..."

"event","I have officially changed my program to Radiation Therapy which means I will be pursuing a bachelor's degree.  I am taking on a lot of responsibility by doing this; more than I have in many, many years.  The RT program is daytime-only.  I can take the prerequisite classes at night but when I get accepted into the core curriculum, I will have no choice but to attend classes during the day.

This, of course, is all right because I will need to get used to being awake during the day if I am to pursue this career.  I am not too worried about it.  In order to prepare myself for this, I have scheduled my Anatomy & Physiology (A&P) class at 10am on Monday and Wednesday.

Classes begin September 29th so I have that much time to get myself in a better state of mind and body.  I'm really psyched about going back this time.  Sure, there is the usual anxiety that goes with going back to school after a withdrawal but it's not really that bad.  I have a new laptop for taking notes and I am going to try studying somewhere other than home to see if it helps.  While I haven't done poorly in the past, I could be doing much better than I am.

I'm not sure when I will become a candidate for the program but I am going to start getting some face time with all the right people so that they already know me when it comes time to interact with them.

-Comcast screwed us so we switched to satellite and will soon be switching to DSL (once Lesley gets her business stuff all changed over to the new domain).  
-We FINALLY have our own domain: SpoiledCooks.com.  
-I'm going Bluetooth with everything.  Well, not EVERYTHING, but I now use a Bluetooth MP3 player.  
-I have been wearing Crocs since fall and I love them no matter what anyone says about them.  
-I've started reading again.  I am working my way through the first Dexter book.  It's slow going but I am hoping it will get easier.  
-I am contemplating going back to study theatre instead of any of this medical business but the radiation therapy is too lucrative to dismiss easily.  I'll probably get my BS in Radiation Therapy and pursue theatre as a hobby.  
-I have found a dojo and once I have the money, I will begin training again.
-I have four level 70 WoW characters

Important news:
-My brother and his brood have moved to Michigan
-My mother is taking the steps she needs to take to get to Michigan
-I haven't had a <i>confirmed</i> sinus infection since my mishap in December with not following directions
-I did catch a dose of influenza after my gall bladder was removed
-I haven't finished bouncing back from my gall bladder surgery yet because of the flu and some other persistent malaise but I am not discouraged.
-A bike trail was opened and it runs into another town for a round trip of 10.6mi.
-A new meat market opened and we have been buying the BEST meats!
-I am eating much better (even if I am not eating as well as I want)

There are some other, more internal, things but I think those are better left out for the time being.  As a side note, I have been watching a lot of MMA lately because they show a lot of it on HDNet (which we get now).  It has inspired me to get back into the dojo and to look into getting involved with a local promotion in some capacity or another.  We'll see how it works out.  Don't worry, I am too old and out-of-shape to think of competing.  I could train or announce.  So that oughtta hold y'all for another six or seven months.  However long."

I slowly lost contact with her so I have no idea what led her to that point but the person I knew never would have done anything like that.  The problem is, I probably didn't really know her.  She was a very close and dear friend who helped me through some rough patches.  She was so full of Light.  It saddens me that she could allow that to be snuffed out and replaced by the monster who tortured her son like that.  I am still trying to wrap my thoughts around the whole thing.  I just can't process it!  She loved her son so much and when I knew her, she would have fought tooth-and-nail to protect him.  I guess circumstance can bring out a person's true nature.  The boy is now with his father, so that's the good news.  There won't be any lasting physical effects but the psychological and emotional scars will be with him for many years to come.

Even things not entirely under my control are working out.  My brother got his transfer to the Trenton (Michigan) station which means he will only be about an hour away from me.  My mother will likely be moving here some time this year, depending on whether her supervisor can help her find a job or not.

It's funny that my family is moving nearer to me just as I am getting to a point where I don't hurt so much being so far from them.  Why is it that once I learn to live without things, they stick around?  Oh well, I shouldn't complain about that.

My gall bladder is coming out in a week and I am hoping that it will resolve a lot of my remaining health issues.  After much deliberation, I have determined that this has probably been with me since about 1989!  It explains a lot of my problems which is why I was hesitant to attribute much to it.  I am always suspicious of things that seem to be too perfect.  I guess the proof is in the pudding, right?  We'll see how I feel on the 8th.  My brother will be here for my surgery because they'll be here house hunting, so it's going to be nice to have my family around at a time like that. 

In other big news, I have FINALLY found a butcher!  A new meat market opened up and the butcher is very friendly and patient.  The meat is high-grade but the prices are very reasonable.  Also, our favorite place recently closed and we were sad.  This is the little restaurant/mercado that was practically next door to us.  We don't have to be so sad anymore because the guy who used to own that place is cooking at another place.  Hopefully, he will find some investors so he can open up his own place.

I see a surgeon this Friday to find out for certain whether it will need to come out but the ER doc, my primary, and NP all say it has to come out.  The pain is tolerable as long as I don't move around much and don't eat too much fat.  I miss cheese, damn it! 

Right now, it's looking like this whole gall bladder thing could have been a large factor in holding me back and holding me down.  Having gone through all of this, I believe that I have been dealing with gall bladder issues for years and just chalked it up to abdominal cramping/gas.  I've had ultrasounds before and nothing turned up but I think I might have gotten further if I had been more vocal about what was going on with my side. 

You see, ever since about 1987, I've had pain on my right side when I lie on my back.  This is why I like to sleep on my belly and not my back.  

It's weird, I don't feel like there is much wrong right now.  I know that I have a lot of shit to work through but I feel like getting my gall bladder out will free me up to do some of the shit I need to do.

"event","Well, we decided to economize a bit by downgrading our High Speed Internet from 6Mb/s down to 4Mb/s.  4Mb/s is plenty fast enough for playing WoW and browsing the web as we do.  Right, so they throttled me down like I expected only they went too far and took me back to the 1990s.  I clock in at UNDER 768Kb/s!  That might be fine for a lot of web pages and even some video service but it really makes WoW unplayable for me.  What's worse, I can't use VOIP while doing anything on the web, much less while playing WoW.  This means that I can't play WoW (as if I were capable of doing that to begin with) while Lesley is making business calls.

Monolithic Cable dispatched a technician and he was double-clicking hyperlinks!  According to him, web pages are loading fine.  ""That looked fine to me.""  He loaded NASCAR.com (big surprise!) and it took long to download by my standards.  I'm used to nearly-instant load times even on the most graphics- and video-intensive web sites.  So he loaded a NASCAR video and it loaded fairly well with a couple pauses here and there.  So he was satisfied with the performance which means Monolithic is pleased with my performance.  

Lesley is IRATE!  Lesley doesn't get mad.  She gets annoyed and irritated but she hardly ever gets angry.  There really is no excuse for us to be getting speeds lower than DSL's lowest tier speed when we are paying for 4 or 6Mb/s.  We're seriously considering making a switch to DSL for our internet and satellite for our video service.  Of course, I have had my eye on DirecTV for a while because they have better HD offerings.

The Monolithic party line is that DSL is not faster than cable but even DSL's lowest service tier has a higher speed than we're getting right now.  I really need to do more research on DSL to see what my options are.  I know that AT&T has bundled service packages with AT&T DSL and DishNetwork video service and I think that might be what we need to switch to.  I am tired of dealing with Monolithic Cable!  At least with Dish, I would get the NFL Network and Big Ten Network for free.  I am an unhappy customer.

I think Lesley and I should shell out the money for a private domain name and switch to get away from Monolithic!

UPDATE:  Monolithic only offers the 4Mb/s service tier if you have no other Monolithic services.  I was told I was downgrading to 4Mb/s and I was downgraded to their 768Kb/s service and I NEVER would have done that!  Not ever!  I mean, seriously?!?  Why would I move to a service tier that doesn't fit my needs?  C'mon, people, really!  

You see, this is what I hate about Monolithic Cable!  One salesperson promises you one thing to get you to keep the service and that may or may not be available to you but they don't bother telling you that what they are offering you is only available under certain conditions.  Then, when you call up to complain about not getting what you were promised, there is no record of that promise so you either go with something else or finally get what you were promised because someone has some integrity and honors his/her word.  Oh, the joys of cutthroat salesmanship!  I'm still considering going to DSL even though we have switched back to 6Mb/s and everything is working fine.  Well, fine?  According to speedtest.net, I am clocking in at 18.5Mb/s.  I am sure that's either not accurate or not what I can expect to have most of the time.  All I know is that I am definitely above 6Mb/s and that's really all I'm going to worry about for now.  I'm tired and I have a massive headache which was not helped by this whole deal.  Shit, I could have slept in for a couple of hours instead of getting my ugly butt up to wait for the technician.  Someone please put me to bed."

"event","I would not advise attending a CPR course at 9am after not sleeping the night before.  I was doing all right until we got to the infant.  With the infant, I couldn't use my entire body weight so I tired quickly.  Of course, I didn't realize it at the time, but I really wiped myself out doing chest compressions for so long.  9am-1pm with breaks here and there really adds up later in the evening.  I am so sore from yesterday.  I thought my knees would be bothering me the most and they're not that bad.  I'm sore, but I really don't mind.  Actually, I rather enjoy it because it's pain that I have earned and it's bearable (right now).  There is a certain level of satisfaction accompanied by the soreness I've earned with hard work.  It's much easier to take when I exerted myself in a worthwhile endeavor.

Right, so next Friday, I will be taking the exam and should be certified!  Go me, right?  Class is starting to level out for me.  We're getting into what I like to call my kitchen.  My instructor was surprised that I could identify the gender of the skeleton in the lab.  A few of us could tell by the pelvis but it surprised him.  I've actually found myself teaching my peers during our study groups, which helps me reinforce my own knowledge.  I just need to get away from trying to remember from what I've learned before and learn from the current lessons.  It's a much better approach and HOLY SHIT, do I have a monster headache all of a sudden!  I think I'm starting to wake up fully.  Well, long, boring story short; I'm doing pretty well in A&P and CPR/First Aid is a total breeze (except for the physical strain which is bearable).  Thanks for reading!"

"event","Well, I am still alive.  I've been in PT and back in school, so I haven't spent much time around LJ.  Things are going pretty well for the most part.  I have more energy which allows me to cook more often and that's helping my marriage a lot more than I thought it would.  There, of course, are some bad things.  I have developed a problem with a muscle in my side and it's really been bothering me for a week.  I am also struggling with my Anatomy & Physiology course.  We're reviewing stuff I learned as far back as 7th grade and I have been depending too much on remembering what I learned way back then instead of absorbing what's being taught right now so I scored a little low on my first test.  I feel overwhelmed because things aren't sticking and I hardly ever have that problem.  I am going to form a study group and seek out tutoring to get over this hump.  I don't want my anxiety to build so I am going to do something about it.  Once we get out of the remedial sections which cover things like cellular biology and basic chemistry/atomic particles, I think I will be doing much better because we will be getting into my strength.  This too will pass, right?  Really, that's it.  There's not much else to report apart from the fact that my brother and his family will (more than likely) move to Michigan some time early this year.  He has applied for voluntary relocation to Michigan and he has glowing endorsements from two people who are hard to impress and whose word carries a lot of weight, so scuttlebutt is that my brother can have any post he wants.  It will be nice to have someone from my side of the family close to me.  My mother and uncle will move here as soon as my mother can find a job here or she retires.  Either way, she will be here within 5-8 years.  Thanks for reading!"

"event","<center><lj-cut text=""Cut for your convenience.""></center>Actually, this comes as no great revelation to me.  I already knew that.  I've known it for a long time.  It's just that I keep getting new reminders of that fact.  My blood sugar has gotten a little higher than I wanted so I have gone back to the beginning of my diabetes training.  I am not going to allow myself to be complacent because complacency isn't controlling my blood sugars anymore.  It was all right for a while because...I don't know why it was all right.  I changed what I was doing and started getting active and my blood sugar went up.  I wasn't eating any more than I had before getting active again.  My blood sugar just kept going up the more active I got.  It's supposed to be the opposite.  The problem wasn't how much I was eating as much as it was when I was eating and what I was eating when.  We're getting that back under control and I have gone back into PT for my shins.

Well, what I suspected turned out to be the case.  Because of my huge gut (it really is very large), my center of gravity is all off and out of whack.  In an attempt to keep from falling backward, my body leans forward which puts strain on the muscles in my shins.  My shin muscles (<a href=""http://www.exrx.net/Muscles/TibialisAnterior.html"" target=""_blank"">tibialis anterior</a> for those keeping score at home) are grossly overdeveloped from bearing the brunt of the way I have to stand and walk.  PT can't do much for me apart from relieving the pain.  In this case more than any other, I have to lose weight to get rid of the problem.  Stretching will only help relieve symptoms, it won't get rid of the problem at all.  Really, all I can do in PT is manage pain and tonicity.  

The good news?  They're putting my fat body back in the pool!  I am going into the pool for ""General Conditioning""!  Yes, that means I am going to be working my gut (not butt) off in the pool.  It's not an Olympic pool.  It's really something more like a giant hot tub.  There are steps and rails and tiles and water.  The buoyancy will take the pressure off my joints and I should be able to get more done before my body decides I've had enough.

I also picked up a good bit of philosophy I think I will add into my own.  When I pick up something to eat, I will ask myself if it's worth it.  ""Is this cookie worth the mile I'll have to run for it?""  If I'm going to have to work it off, it damned well better be worth it.  I don't want to eat any more packaged cookies.  If I'm going to spike my blood sugar and have to work harder at the gym, it's going to have to be a homemade cookie.  Only Grade-A junk for me.  The Big Macs and Whoppers are not worth it.  Half the shit I eat isn't worth it.  I'm tired and lazy, so I eat for convenience which makes me even more tired and even lazier.  It's a sick cycle and I've been stuck in its downward spiral for years now.

Fortunately, the converse also holds true.  The better I eat, the better I'll feel which means I will be able to cook more which means I will eat better...  See the pattern here?  

Change is not easy and changes like these are never instant.  I just need them to be as close to instant as I can.  Eating better doesn't mean I switch to margarine and eat salads.  Eating better means that I am more selective about what goes into my body.  If I am what I eat, I am shit.  Sure, the fats and sugars in the shit I eat masks the fact that I am eating shit but the evidence is in the way I feel.  The foods I've been eating make me feel like shit.  That's how I know I've been eating shit.

With my love of food and cooking, I should be eating a lot better than I have been.  I've come back to the one place I've always returned.  It all stems from fear.  I have issues I still haven't dealt with.  I don't even know how to deal with them, that's why they're still issues.  I should probably seek professional help for my problems but I am afraid of where that might lead.  I have a morbid fear of being hospitalized even though I have come close to entering in-patient care in the past couple years.  It's that willingness which has led to my recent breakthroughs.  While I have made up a lot of ground, there is a lot that I keep locked inside of me.  There are things I need to get out and I don't know the best way to do that.  I used to feel I could do it here but no one reads like they used to.  I appreciate those who still read, it's not that.  It's just that I don't have the kind of relationship with my readers that I used to.  People used to admire my strength for being able to put everything out here for anyone to read.  Now, that has worn thin on people because I tend to repeat myself in order to get to the evolution of the thought.  A private journal doesn't suit me because I need to SHARE this with someone.  I suppose that's where the professional comes in, huh?

Yeah, I have a name and number, I just need to get a referral to get an appointment and I keep putting it off.  I've been putting it off for almost a year now.  I think I am at the point where it's about the only thing that will help me.  I have some steps to make but I need someone to guide me to the point where I can make them."

"event","I really don't get it.  People get all snippy with me and then tell me that I am overreacting.  I also don't understand why people can't address the facts that I offer in an argument.  They completely ignore my argument and make it into a personal attack against me.  I know better than to respond with the same treatment but that doesn't stop me most of the time.  

I get into a discussion with someone about something and he says that the facts are a certain way but never explains how or why they are that way.  I explain why I think things are a certain way but he ignores that and goes off on me about something only marginally related to what I said and he simply MUST tell me that I am overreacting.  It's funny how people want to argue until they are blue in the face and then when they want to stop, it's over.  If I don't want to argue, it doesn't matter.  If I want to clear something up, it doesn't matter.

I think the problem is that I interact with too many spoiled brats who want to have it their way and only their way.  I welcome informed conversations, debates, and arguments but I never get them.  People want to make it emotional and throw tantrums and then call a foul on me.  It's not my fault that I expect people's assertions to have something behind them.  Okay, maybe it is my fault.  Apparently, people can neither read nor listen these days.  What can I expect from people who see nothing wrong with saying, ""I seen""?

See, I was taught that you back up your statements with thoughtful arguments.  I am more than willing to consider points but I am seldom offered any real points. 

""Oh, Concept A is right because the facts show they are.""

Of course, none of those facts are ever offered.  It wouldn't matter if I tried to sidestep or avoid any kind of debate because they push and push until they have had enough.  Then I am the bad person for pushing.  They dumped a load on me and then cry like a baby when I offer even a small amount of the same in return.

Jesus, why do I have to deal with so many children?  Now, a lot of these people are idiots and I can't expect any better from them but some of these people are SUPPOSED to be intelligent people.  The problem is that too many people think only of themselves and what they think/want.  Apparently, I am not sincere when I ask for something to consider besides hollow assertions.  According to my critics, I don't listen to or read anything anyone else says or writes.  Well, the thing is that there isn't much to consider when someone dumps an emotional load on me and calls it an argument.

I am tired of that snotty attitude that is so prevalent these days.  I expect it from petulant 12 year-olds but I keep getting it from adults.  They stomp their figurative feet like spoiled brats and tell me how mean/bad/dumb/insensitive I am.  I don't know if this is just a cultural thing or if I am contributing to it.  I try to offer things up in a way that is easy to understand so that I can say my argument is supported.  What's the point of doing that if people won't even consider half of what I say or write?

Holy shit, do these people read the things I write only to find fault with it.  People are so eager to find fault in me.  I don't intend to come across as arrogant or know-it-all.  I have simply had a lot of study and experience and I put that behind the things I say.  I'm sorry that I feel that there should be a certain amount of structure to language and communication.  

Yes, I understand the emotional value of catharsis but only when it is appropriate.  I am tired of people deciding it is all right to treat me like shit and then demand that I respect them.  I'll respect you but you have to offer me the same.  How can I respect you when you don't treat me with respect?  It just doesn't work.  I am willing to listen and to think.

Aha!  Maybe that's the problem!  No one wants to think anymore.  They want to watch their idiotic Will Ferrell movies and never want to think.  I like to think.  Everyone knows that.  Most people say I think too much.  That's true of some things.  It's not the thinking that's the trouble it's the distress of dwelling on matters.  So this is me addressing something so I can put it behind me.

I just want this to serve as a bulletin to everyone in my life.  If you treat me like shit, do NOT expect me to kiss your ass.  If you respect me, I will respect you.  If you treat me like shit, do not have the chutzpah to be offended when I disrespect you.  I'll grow up if you promise to do the same.  Actually, whether you agree to or not, I am going to be an adult.  If you will not treat me with the same respect I offer you, I just won't deal with you any more than I have to.  It's that simple.  There's no need for me to berate or beat you.  I'll just show you the back of my head (literal or figurative) because that's what you REALLY deserve."

"event","I walked nearly ten miles in two days while in Chicago.  Lesley had training so I went with her since I didn't have to worry about going in to work since I didn't get the job?  Bitter?  Nah.  It was nice.  I was all by myself during the first half of the day Monday and Tuesday and I got to see more of Chicago.  I thought I would be miserable on my own but the time flew right by.  I had an adventure on the CTA buses because I neglected to note the cross streets of my hotel.  I did quite a bit of walking just to get back to the hotel.

It all started with a walk to get breakfast.  I wanted to walk from the Westin Chicago North River to The Tempo Cafe.  Well, I ended up walking the nearly twelve blocks to get to the cafe.  I thought I would die after that first day but we did some more walking that night.  On Tuesday, I just did a little bit of walking and rode the bus to kill time.  I took the bus down for a while and then headed back when it seemed like the time to get back would get me back to the hotel just in time for Lesley to get out of her seminar.

I didn't really do too much but I had a really great time.  It's nice to be able to enjoy myself without having to feel like I need to justify or qualify my enjoyment.  I had a great time and that's all there is to it.

Of course, there is the aftermath to consider.  My shins are killing me because I have no arches in my feet.  I really need to get some custom orthotics to take care of that.  I am having trouble with my ""good"" ankle (the one I haven't fractured).  I figure it's just grumbling from the strain but if it still hurts like this on Friday, I am going to get some X-rays to make sure there are no stress fractures.  Asking my joints to carry all 285 pounds of me is asking a lot and stress fractures are a distinct possibility.

But back to more good news.  I saw my ENT today and he is amazed by how quickly I have improved.  He said that these kinds of improvements happen much more gradually.  I was actually able to sleep without my CPAP (I fell asleep in the hotel on Monday when I got back) and it didn't really bother me too much.  The doctor did nu,b me up to pull some nastiness out of my nose.  I'll just say that I cannot believe that stuff like that could come through my nostril, much less out of my nose.  It was unpleasant to consider but my breathing is much freer with those clumps out.  Yep, aside from intense pain from walking way too much, things are going pretty well for me.  Thanks for stopping by."

"event","<center><lj-cut text=""More of an explanation, really.""></center>All right, I know that some of my friends are going through some very time toughs right now and I have been pretty reticent despite my concern.  I'm sorry that a few bad apples have spoiled it for the rest of my friends.  I've just gotten some poor treatment from people who once called themselves my friends, so I have been withdrawing from this place.  I'm tired of people treating me like shit and then freaking out when I get even close to returning the favor.  Instead of getting into battles like I normally would, I have just pulled away.

Now that I've thought about it, I realize how selfish a large number of my ""friends"" are.  There are two usual reactions to that for me.  The most common reaction is for me to give them the ass-kissing that they want and to turn myself into some sort of stupid martyr for them.  What's that all about, anyway?  The other reaction is to get bitchy with them.  Of course, getting bitchy with bitches means they whine even more.  Funny that they whine more about me whining than I actually do whine.

I'm taking better care of myself and part of that is withdrawing from things that are unhealthy for me.  The sad fact of the matter is that hanging around with most of you is unhealthy for me.  I haven't made friends with well-adjusted people.  I've made friends with damaged people with issues as big (if not bigger) as mine.  I'm not saying that my friends are bad people.  It's just that too many of my friends are bad for me.  It would be great if they were just miserable, contemptible people.  They're some pretty nice people with a lot to offer me.  I just need to get away from them for the things they bring out in me.

I need more friends who are flesh and blood to me and not just an avatar and handle.  I need to make friends with people who bring out the best in me.  I need to make friends with people I can bring the best out of in return.  Take from this what you will because whatever you think, you're probably right.  What I am saying means a lot of different things to different people.

I wish my friends all the best and I hope that you are able to handle all the shit Life's thrown at you lately but I won't be around much to say that I am supporting you or that I am thinking of you.  Know that you are my friends and that I will always consider you such (unless you really hurt me, of course).  I may still post or I may not, I really haven't decided yet.

I really don't see much point in posting here much anymore.  I don't get much out of the catharsis of expressing myself here and there are only two kinds of people who read this anymore.  There are the people who mostly agree with me and there are the people who only read what I write to find fault with what I do/say.  Maybe this journal will have value for me again but I'm not really worried about it at this point.  That's pretty much it (for now)..."

"event","Oy vey, I woke up absolutely miserable.  Breathing through my mouth has made my tongue all hard and brushing only helped a little.  The pain was almost unbearable until my Percocet kicked in.  I am pleasantly surprised by the Percocet since nothing ever seems to work for me.  It dulls the pain even if it doesn't do anything about the burning sensation but with the aching tamed, the burning is tolerable.

This has been so much better than most of my other experiences.  I am dealing with this very well.  I wonder if it has something to do with my attitude.  I am not depressed and I think that might be making everything else easier to deal with.

I have postponed my appointment with my primary but I am going to keep my interview tomorrow no matter how miserable I am.  I am put on a good face for 30-45 minutes.  I really believe that I will lose any chance at this job if I try to reschedule my interview.  I know it's not a lock if I show up for my interview as scheduled but I know that going in tomorrow is the only way I will have a shot at this.  I should be feeling much better later this week but I really need to do this ASAP.

I think the prospect of getting this job has me really excited.  I know that there is some anxiety buzzing inside of me but I can't quite put a meaning to it.  Actually, anxiety might not be the right word.  Excitement is really the right word.  The excitement might even be helping me cope with this.  I just wish I didn't feel so miserable right now.  My instinct is to curl up in bed but that would make me feel worse.  I only have a few hours and I have an ice pack I can use to cool me off.

The staff at the surgery center was great.  All the ladies were very friendly and none of them tried to bullshit me.  They were honest when they answered my questions.  They let me know that the packing could make me miserable and they were right.  Thankfully, it's not as bad as they led me to believe.  Of course, they have to tell me worst-case and this is certainly not worst-case.

I don't know how well I will be breathing this afternoon when the first pack is removed but I hope it's enough for me to get the restorative sleep I need.  I know that I will be feeling worlds better with even just one night of decent sleep.  Once I was able to adjust my full-face CPAP mask, I was able to get some sleep which has helped.  It's just too bad that the full-face is part of the problem(s) I'm dealing with right now.  

Oh well, I am about one or three steps from the life I've been wanting.  That's really close and I don't think I can wait much longer.  I've said it before but I need to say it again...Life is good."

You know how I'm always quoting Duran Duran by saying, ""Don't say a prayer for me now; save it 'til the morning after""?  Well, I think this is that morning after.  Fortunately, the pain is bearable.  This will soon be nothing more than a memory."

"event","I love the new Bruce Springsteen album.  It's the first Springsteen CD I've ever owned.  Lesley bought it for me 'cause I'm a big baby and need all the comfort I can get after my surgery.  Even though it's going much better than I expected, it's still trying.  My pain meds are working pretty well and the ice picks up the slack.  Actually, it just not being able to breathe through my nose that is giving me trouble.  Whenever I drink something, the pressure in my ears goes crazy.

I would also like to thank Stace for the recommendation on Transformers.  I really like it.  That's all...for now."

"event","You don't start a new network by trying to hold the nation's cable and satellite subscribers hostage.  If any of you subscribe to cable, the Big Ten Network wants your money even if you don't know what The Big Ten is.  They want you to foot the bill so that I can get more Big Ten coverage.  So if you live in Florida and don't give a lick about sports at all, they still want you to pay for it.

The Big Ten Conference is under the impression that no one would have a problem with paying for a service that few people would actually want.  Sure, there are alumni from Big Ten schools in nearly every American market but I don't think there is enough to justify putting the bill on everyone.  The Big Ten Network refuses to allow cable operators to place the channel on a special sports tier [Ed: where it belongs!].

The consequence of this ransom is that I miss out on Michigan Football because my cable company refuses to be strong armed by the Big Ten Conference and its network.  I have an interest in the programming but, let's face it, I'm not going to be watching much ladies soccer or any track and field.  I would watch football and supplemental coverage.  Most of what the Big Ten Network has to offer is (at best) third-tier.  Unfortunately, they have taken away Michigan an Ohio State games from people who are devoted to those teams.  Sure, they're playing small market teams, but we don't care.  We want to watch our teams play and most of us are willing to spring for a sports tier package to see it.  Hell, I already subscribe to the sports tier and I wouldn't mind a small increase to add this channel.

I can only assume that the BTN is trying to follow in the footsteps of the NFL Network which bills itself as the fastest growing cable network in history.  The NFL has a lot more content that appeals to a national market.  The Big Ten Conference is a niche market and you don't spread the cost of a niche over an entire subscriber base.

I would suggest that anyone who subscribes to cable visit <a href=""http://www.puttingfansfirst.com/"" target=""_blank"">Putting Fans First</a>.  You might think this has nothing to do with you but you need to voice your support of cable systems who refuse to be taken hostage by a greedy company.

What really cheeses me is that Michigan and Michigan State both play at noon tomorrow (Saturday) and both games are slated to be on the BTN.  I won't get to watch either game.  I'll have to settle for listening to the game on Sirius.  This is NOT the way to build a television network.  I hope they come to their senses soon before they make a big mistake like putting the Michigan-Ohio State game on the BTN.  While ABC has a contract to carry that game, I am sure that there is some scenario which could see that game placed on the BTN.  Such as two other games running at the same time which have BCS implications.  BTN gets third choice after ABC/ESPN so it could be possible that the two BCS-deciding games could end up on ABC and ESPN which means the BTN would be able to carry UM-OSU.  If that were to happen, there would be riots in Columbus and Ann Arbor.  We'll just have to see how things work out..."

"event","Well, there is no getting around it or denying it any longer.  I am sick.  I have a full-fledged respiratory infection and it's not fun.  I am dependent on Xopenex again and the four hours between treatments feels like an eternity.  My appetite has dropped off sharply and all I want to do is drink Diet Dew and curl up under my comforter.  The only problem is that curling up under my comforter makes me very hot so I kick it off and then I am cold.  I hate being bothered by the cold.  I only mind the cold when I am sick.  When I'm not sick, I LOVE the cold.  I was made for cold weather.  But not when I am sick.

I know that I am a big baby <strike>most</strike> all of the time, but I am even more of a baby when I am sick.  Breathing is not easy and that makes me cranky.  Working to breathe means that I expend a lot of energy just doing that.  This makes the fatigue feel even worse.

I have had to reschedule my surgery and I am hoping the doctor will phone in a prescription for a Z-Pack without having to see me.  I just want to get my drugs and get better.  Yeah, I'm sad that I am not going to have my surgery at the end of this week but I can't let myself get depressed.  This was a strong possibility and I accepted it a while ago.  I have to remain focused because getting depressed now will make the sickness even stronger.  I will overcome this by doing what I know I need to do and not getting all down about it.

I have had a lot of emotional reactions lately, but it still pisses me off when people say I am crying, ""Woe is me.""  I am acknowledging my feelings so that I can deal with them.  It's funny, though; the people who complain the most about my whining whine even more themselves so fuck them, right?  I'm on a path and I can't let my usual habits push me off of it.  Things can only change when I change the things I do.  I can't expect anything to change if I keep doing things the way I've always done them.  My way isn't the right way and that's all there is to it.  I need to change my way so that my way is the right way.  It's obvious but hard to apply to my life.  Even though it should go without saying, it really needs to be said.  The problem is that I try to take certain things for granted and never really consider the obvious.  I always look for zebras, as the old axiom goes.  I need to look out for horses now.

I'll get through this easier than I have in the past because we've found something that works and then we will move forward with the surgery and we likely won't have to worry as much about this.  If you'll excuse me now, it feels like I'm under a few feet of water and I'm very drowsy.  Thanks for all the good wishes I've been receiving lately.  It helps to know that people care."

"event","Jesus H. Christ!  Why does this bother me so much?  Am I just so overwrought about other things in my life that this is that one, little thing that breaks me down?  So I didn't get the job, what's the big deal?  People get turned down for jobs every day.  

I think the problem is that I had built it up as something so great and perfect for me that I am having a hard time dealing with the reality of going back to work.  But, fucking shit, I feel like I am going to scream or cry right now.  What the bleeding fuck is up with that?  This is bullshit.  I am making a mountain out of a mole hill and that's not good.

I could try to rationalize myself out of this funk but I know that won't do any good.  I am well aware of the fact that I wouldn't be able to start until at least a month from now and they probably need someone right now.  I guess it comes back to the fact that only girls have been hired by the manager.  I think the roastmaster was hired by the owner and not the manager.  I need to let this go but it's under my skin.  This is bothering me way too much and that's making it worse.  It's feeding itself.  I don't know how to let go.  I have to analyze and obsess; it's a deep part of my nature and I wish to fuck I could change it.  This sinus headache and mounting infection don't help matters either.  It's starting to look like I will have to reschedule my surgery.  FUCK!"

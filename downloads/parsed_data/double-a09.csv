"event","if something were to happen to me right now and i could never talk to the people that i love and tell them exactly how much they meant to me, it would be the greatest regret of my life. 

Brandon: you are the love of my life. you have opened me up to possibilites that i have never dreamed of. you bring out the best in me, except when you tick me off with how selfish you can be sometimes. i want to thank you for helping me in the most important way possible. you've shown me that love is a true thing, that no matter what you can make it through with ""the one"" by your side. you've held my hand through everything...good bad...everything.
i love you with all of my heart and no matter what, that will never change. 

Grace: you are the best friend any person could ever dream of. you're not selfish in any way, you're the best listener in the whole world and you never stop caring. you're the one person i can always turn to you and not worry (too much) about what you would say. you always have your arms open, a shoulder free, and a smile to bright my day. you've made me a better person in so many ways grace. i love you so much Gracie-Poo. 

Bethaney: you have challenged my mind and emotions in more ways than anyone ever has. you're extremely intuitive (which gets annoying at times lol) so you always know when something's wrong but at the same time you dont pry, you just say something amazing and completely change my view on things. You're definately the most intelligent person i know. mainly because you're not just face value, you actually take things to the next lever. you're not just book smart, you're an all around ""uplifting"" person. i love you Bethaney.

Tariq: you are probably the best guy friend i've ever had. you do the stupidest crap sometimes but for some reason i love everything about you. you a great guy tariq. you're funny, charming, good looking...the whole nine yards. i can talk to you about anything and vise versa. i love you my favorite sexy indian.

Caden: when you came into this world, i was ""iffy"" on how things would turn out between us. but kid, you stole my heart the moment i laid my eyes on you. you're my best friend in a lot of ways, you always listen without butting in, you smile when i definately need it, and you trust me without all of the strings attatched. i love you ""Cader-Bug""

Julia: I wished for you upon a star. you were everything i ever dreamed of. we fight but hey, we're sisters. it's what we're good at. we have this bond that no one else has. it's like some sort of special sister bond. it wont ever fade either, not even with all of the fighting. i love you Julia.

Kati: We were instantely friends from the moment that we started hanging out. you have this karisma about you. it's like some kind of magnet that draws people near without even knowing it. you helped me through alot of stuff. you just seem to understand things that others dont. you're so smart and gorgeous inside and out. we've been through alot and times have changed but i love you Kati-bar and that is something that will never change.

Tony: you had this hora about you that i couldnt get out of my head when we first met. you made me smile just being around you. we became friends, best friends, a couple, friends. it's like a roller-coaster with you. but no matter how things are between us at that moment, even if we havent talked in a month, i can come to you and tell you my deepest darkest secret with no hesitation. i feel safe when im with you. i love you tony-bologna, i always have and always will.

Colt: i cant help but smile when im with you. it's strange how comfortable i was when i first met you, because that doesnt happen much. it was like i instantly trusted you. you've definately made an impact on my life. you're such a sweetheart colt and all i want is to see you happy. i love you you ""cutest SOB ever""!

Shey: You dont think enough of youself. and i think that's because people are constantly telling you how perfect you are. i dont know why you dont just tell everyone to shut up sometimes, including me! lol. you're so sweet shey and you have so much ahead of you. everything is going to pay off soon and you'll have everything you've ever wanted. i love you shey-win!

Paige: i hate how you contantly compare yourselves to others. (i know im a hypocrite) you are such a beautiful person in so many ways that i've only ever seen in you. you've got so many talents that you just havent unleashed yet. you're going to go far in life paige. just believe in yourself and the unthinkable. im so glad that i've had the chance to get to know you. i love you paige, my beautiful artist friend!

Mom: i dont hate you. i know i give you attitide but im a teenager. it's my job. Kidding. i love you moma. i know things that i could only learn from you. thank you for putting up with me as long as you have. even though there are a few things that i dont like about our past there is a promising future. i love you and never forget about 26cents.

Steve: You came into my life out of nowhere, or at least that's how it felt. you are my father in all ways possible. you've held those philisophical conversations with me as well ast the one's about your ""dumb-a**"" past. you've never treated me like a child and i have so much respect for you as a result of that. i love you my stevie-poo!

Daddy: you have always been my hero. you picked me up when i would fall, you'd push me down when i got a little too high on my horse, and you've always had an open ear. you are someone i can always count on for good advice and someone who will always pull my chin up. i love you fasea!

Misty: you have related to me better than any of my parents ever have. you've always been like a friend to me but at the same time an authority. i have alot of respect for you and what you've made of yourself. and those kids of yours...man i love them. they ARE my brother. i love all of you soo much.

Andrew: it seems like just yesterday i was debating whether or not you should be my first kiss. lol. you've always had a way with making WANT to be near you. you are someone i can talk to about anything...and i mean ANYTHING. you're a wonderful friend and an all around great guy. you and your brother have helped me through so much. i love you both.

Justin: i wish you wouldnt try so hard. people would enjoy your company, not that i dont, if you werent so obnoxious. you're a good guy at heart and i know that. you need to apply youself is you ever want anything out of life. i know you can do it. just try. love you hun!

Cody: From the moment i found out we were cousins i felt like you were family. i felt like i could discuss things with you and you would truely understand me. you've challenged my mind in so many ways. i really hope you can get out of here and change the world one day. you're amazing cody. i love you cuz. AKA: Captain!

michelle: you seriously need to get out of this place and unleash your knowledge upon the world. you keep things bottled up too much. it shows on your face. i think you just need to find something that you love doing and stick with it. we've had our problems but i still love you girl.

Mike: i am so pissed off at you for screwing up your life. you could've been an ivey league student. i know you've been going through alot but why you would let yourself go the way you have blows me away. i always looked up to you in everything you did. you were always like a big brother to me and i dont know what i would do if i were to lose my big brother. you so smart but you lack serious common sense. even after all of this i still cant be too upset with you. i just love you too much and it hurts so bad to see you this way.

Nana: my hero, my friend, my rollmodel, my everything. and i didn't even tell you. you're death was so unexpected and i thought i would still have forever with you. you were invincible in my eyes. most definately the hardest working woman i'd ever met. you never did things half way either. you would go out of your way to let us know how much you loved us. you were such an amazing person and so so beautiful. your happiness radiated from anyone you came in contact with. i like to think you're in heaven watchin over me but then other times i like even more to think you're right here...my gaurdian angel. i love you nana and i will never forget you as long as i live.

i am such a blessed person to know all of you. each one of you has made me into the person that i am today. and i love all of you so much. you guys are my world...my everything."

"event","hi, i know it's been a while but i really needed something to vent to. i've always had this image that my Junior year was gonna be the best one ever! i'd be driving, i'd have a job and i'd get to spend more time with my boyfriend and friends before they leave for college. well, i did get my license but i dont ever get to go anywhere because my mother still wont let me go. im not a child anymore. as much as she still wants me to be her little girl that stays home and does nothing but help around the house, THATS NOT ME!!! damnit! i have a job and that's going good so far but i dont think im going to be getting as many hours as i was hoping. ah well. i was hoping to have the best summer ever with my boyfriend but it was the suckiest one yet! i barely ever got to see him because of my mother again. and he wouldnt come over to my house either. which i really couldnt blame him for but i really missed spending time with him. he is the love of my life and i really dont know what i would do without him. im really just waiting for him to wake up one day and ask himself the question ""what am i doing"" and move on. i've put him through so much crap that i dont know why he sticks around anymore. it really breaks my heart to upset him in any way and i do it all the time. im really dreading this year when he's at college because i know he's not gonna come back as much and im really scared he's gonna find someone who'll make him happier. someone without a mother who's gonna hold him back. i dont even know what to do about that right now. im so scared right now because there's even more stuff that im not gonna mention on here and i dont know what to do. im just sooo scared!!!"

"event","i dont know if any of you have noticed lately but i've had a lot of stuff on my mind. so i decided to talk to my bestest friend Grace about it. the next couple of passages are notes that we wrote back and forth. i hope it'll help explain things. love yall!
                                                 Amanda*


Grace, Hey hunny. how's it goin? I've got to get something off my chest. that's why we've got this notebook right? okay, did you see how upset i got once we were praying for dakota? well, yes, it upsets me that he has to go through this, but lets face it...i dont know him. I miss it Grace. I miss being able to talk to God. but... i dont know how to explain it. i just dont feel right when i do. like im not ""worthy"" enough. like im...well, i know im not right with God. i am so confused right now. i dont go to church anymore. i dont like it. i guess what i really want is... i want them to try and get me to come back. i think i've been asked ""are you coming to church tonight"" maybe 3 times since i've quit going. (which has been Months!!!) And yes, i know it's not their ""job"" to get me to come back, but that just goes to show how much i've meant to them. It really hurts. that's why i've been so upset lately. the only person that i've talked to and who has asked me to stay is tony! the only damn one who cared!!! Jeff asked me some questions yesterday about my beliefs and he told me that the reason he was asking was to see if ""i really belive because i know my religion and what it's about ot because i was told to belive this...like i grew up with it."" he has a great point. so many people are like that and i think, in a way, that im partly like that too. i dont want to be like this. i want God and i want to feel like he's here and loves me. i dont feel like that anymore. 

                      love you
                         Amanda



Amanda,
Wow! that's definately a big load to carry around...and im sorry that i havent talked to you about it lately. i remember when we'd spend the night together and sit up talking about our faith and stuff. that helped me alot and i miss it. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT WE DONT DO THAT ANYMORE, it's just that we're so darn busy! maybe now, with softball and marching band coming to a close, we can get together. there are so many things i've wanted to do with my friends this school year that i just havent been able to do ya' know and something i've seriously been thinking about, is trying to maybe have a little bible study group. After going to all those youth retreats and stuff with church, i've come to realize just how valuable talking with my peers about God and Faith is. i think you learn more that way than going to church. 
About you church, it kinda makes me mad that they havent done more to get you to come back, becuase yes, amanda, that is their job. As christians, we are responsible for encouraging our church family to worship and fellowship. i dont know them personally and i cant judge their hearts-only god can do that, but i seriously wonder what kind of reasoning that have behind that. i know it's not the same and i know you might have a hard time getting there, but you are always welcome to come to my church. if you ever want to go to church, but dont want to go to yours, then call me and we'll come and get you. that's a promise.
And about this not feeling worthy thing, i am truly sorry that you feel that way, but i also want to tell you that really, no one is worthy of God- no one deserves him, even the strongest christians. That's the beauty of God's grace- it's a gift freely given to us. Grace is a reassurance that when we stray from God, he always welcomes us back with open arms. God loves you so much and that will never change, no matter what. and we all have a little doubting Thomas in us- it's human nature. God IS with you (all the time) and he does love you, you just have to let him. 
And i know you Amanda. you never believe anything just because someone tells you you're supposed to. you arent a hypocrite like the christians that caused Brandon to lose faith. ya know, in a way, loving God and letting him love you is pretty scary...i mean it's truley a huge leap of faith, in more ways than one. You can't see God- you dont have any hard evidence (except for the bible) that he exists. you just have to feel, and know with you heart that he's real and here all the time. no one can make that decision for you- but you've already made that choice...you've accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior. he has a seat for you with you name on it right beside him in heaven. Dont ever forget that!!!
                i love you like crazy,
        (and so does God- you know he's gotta be somethin if he loves a girl as special as you!!!)

love always
Gracie"

"event","can someone answer a question for me please? HOW COME PARENTS HAVE TO BE SO NAIVE? i swear i wont ask for anything again....just answer me this. i mean, they're our parents. they're supposed to love and care for us. i know i know, we're teenagers. we're not supposed to get along 24/7. but i think you should feel welcome if something's going wrong in your life and you need someone to talk to. dont they want us to come and talk to them when we're troubled or facing a hardship. if we're told to talk to you...but then we dont feel welcome because you say ""i dont want to talk right now"" every time we try...then what should we do? im not trying to put myself on a pedestal here because i most definately have my own faults. there are times when i treat ""her"" horrible and i deserve ever bit of punishment that i receive. no one's perfect. i honestly feel like im 10 ft deep burried in the mud and i cant get out. i dont know what to do. i wish i could just talk to her. i want her to hear what i have to say. but she wont listen. have you ever heard the saying ""you're listening but you're not really hearing""? well...take a moment to think about yourself and see if you practice that. because if you dont, then you really should try to start. trust me, you're missing out on so much. why cant everyone just take a moment to ""hear""."

"event","well this is my first entry and im not exactly sure what to say. let me start with how my day went. 

my day consisted of watching screaming, fighting, annoying brats all day. (babysitting) dont get me wrong, i love the kids to death, but dont ya wish you could just lock them in a closet sometimes? i sure do. other than that...my day was pretty good. kinda blah though. i had a lot of time to ""think"" between the screaming and all. (ha)
one thing i did think alot about though was my boyfriend. he just got accepted to UGA and is definately extatic. (who wouldn't be) now there is somewhat of an age difference between us. (not horrible or anything but there is) well the question of the day has been...""where does this leave me?"" we've gotten into this conversation many times before. normally ending in the whole ""we're gonna spend our lives together...3 years will seem like nothing when it's over"".that sort of stuff. i love this guy with ALL of my heart and i believe we'll be ok. but that doesn't take away from the ""scariness"" (i guess you could say). yea, it scares the crap out of me knowing he's going to be gone. we'll see eachother almost every weekend, which is more than alot of college couples can say but that doesnt change anything. i dont want to sound selfish...and i know i do (especially after re-reading this) but i guess i just love him so much im afraid of losing him. i think that's what scares me the most. he's going to be going through such a drastic change once he gets there...who knows what will happen?!
another thing that happened was:
    ok, he's always sort of had this dream of becoming an ""actor"" (and he's amazing at it by the way) but then he comes to me today and asks me ""forget what you think i would like to do or anything like that, what do you think would be the perfect job for me"". well we talked about that for a little while and he starts saying that since he's been with me he's not really set on the whole acting thing anymore because he wouldn't ever be home and he wants the true ""family lifestyle"". so basically he's iving up his dreams because of me. oh dont get me wrong...that is unbelievably considerate and sweet in it's own way but i dont want to stand in the way of the future and accomplishments he is so capable of. i just hope he thinks about all of that before he makes a huge mistake. 

hey! im liking this thing. being able to vent like this is pretty cool. hope everybody has a great day tomarrow and dont forget...
          ***""never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game""
love always,
Amanda*"

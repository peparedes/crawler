22 yowf presented with 20/50 VAs OD, 20/25 OS.

I was able to ret her down to 20/20, which was excellent. Fit her into Purevision torics OU with 20/15 vision (after BSBVA) and RTC 1 week for CLC.

Had to apply LARS due to some rotation on the lens and it worked perfectly, bringing her from 20/25 to 20/15. Gorgeous.

All of this, with about -5.00 -1.00 x180 Rx in both eyes. Very pleased with the results."

I'm feeling very good about the prescriptions I gave them for glasses, though, which is great since I've never actually dealt with adds before. Trial framing was a good idea.

Need to look more carefully at lens extraction patients to see their pseudophakic lens. 

Also missed a Weiss ring from a complete PVD. I noticed it during HP, but didn't pull out to focus on it. Assumed it was a floater. Bad assumption. Shows me that if you notice something, LOOK AT IT. 

All in all, I felt better leaving this time around than last time. If each day can be a little bit better than the last one, eventually this will start to feel like second nature, I can only hope. Because as of now, it's requiring incredible amounts of mental energy at every step. 4 hours feel like 8.

I had my very first patient on Monday. It was a 12 year old little Hispanic boy. He had meridional amblyopia and hyperopia. My refraction was crappier than the previous one so we just kept his prescription the same as last year. I couldn't get a view of his retina because he wouldn't keep his eyes open. Bad photophobia and was falling asleep.

All in all it was a pretty disheartening experience, but I knew it would be rocky going into it. This coming monday I have a 48 and a 51 year old. Should be very different.

Wes called yesterday and gave me some tips on how to get my time down and give drops to kids. Good stuff.

I just finished the first year of optometry school. That bears recording. It's really amazing the amount of material they cram into your head in just 8 months. I guess 24+ semester credits will do that. The workload is ridiculous at times and all you can really do is try to hold on. Regardless, things went better than I expected. I'm maintaining my excitement for the specialty, I'm developing the fun, diagnostic clinical skills, and every day brings me closer to being able to leave the classroom and actually get involved in patient care -- the light at the end of the tunnel, wallpapered with tests. It's a very cool profession.

I'm also (most likely) heading back to work at Sears Optical for the summer. I need the paycheck badly enough to sell my soul to that corporate devil for a few more months. I'm almost overlooking their evil just to be able to interact with patients again. Sitting in a classroom 24/7 can become nauseating. 

But it's Summer. And I plan to squeeze the life out of it."

"event","Wow. So I haven't posted in my journal for a very long time. I may as well take a few minutes to jot down a few thoughts.

What's the occasion? I'm cramming for a ridiculously complex pharmacology test and love any excuse I have to take a break. So we're heading into week #8 now, the mid-point of the semester. I've been crushing all of the tests that have come my way, so far, so I'm pretty happy about that. There's a lot more neuroanatomy involved in optometry than I had realized, but that's okay. Just requires some detective work and critical thinking to figure out exactly what the hell is wrong with the patient, WHERE it's wrong, and how best to fix it. The farther I get into this curriculum, the more I realize this great sense of responsibility I'll have for the health of the people that will come to see me. I'll be prescribing drugs, and those drugs can cause extremely bad side effects if I'm not careful in understanding their medical history. On the one hand, it feels powerful and exciting to be able to change someone's health and quality of life for the better, but definitely scary to think about giving them the wrong treatment...

Anyway, other than school, I've got almost nothing to talk about. It's just constant reading, writing, and thinking. The weekends are worse than the week because there's always a test or two I have to cram for coming up in the next week. And it's impossible to study for it during the week because your time is taken up by classes giving you new material, labs, lab reports, and the millions of different clubs, guest lectures, and events. I do manage to make it to a few parties here and there and have gone bowling with the class a few times. A lot of them are a little younger than me and are still in that ""all I want to do is get fucked up and pass out"" mentality. That's not really my thing anymore, so I'm still hoping to find a group of people that like to party sometimes, but also just like to chill out and converse in a mature sense. That's a hard balance to find in people, it would seem...

So life is just an endless stream of information, at the moment. Eventually that will open up into actual patient care and information application, but I've still got a while to go. One thing I do know, is that I've found a career choice that feels pretty good to me. And that was my ultimate goal from the start. I don't want to kill myself every time I think about going to work, like I have in so many of my other jobs. Still single, though, with no end of that in sight. Pretty damn used to it by now. I try to focus on all the positive aspects of it. All the things I missed when I was hitched to someone else. But I'm doing pretty well all-in-all. Time to get back to that drug list... memorize 130 drug names, actions, uses, and side effects. For one freakin' test. Insane."

"event","I spent a good deal of time at my Aunt Laura's house today with a TON of my extended family I haven't seen in many years.  Everyone's in town for this wedding tomorrow. Luann, daughter of Bobby, brother of Jeanne, daughter of Opal, my grandmother, has HER daughter getting married.  Man my family is complicated... Anyway, we all hung around drinking lemonade, eating pizza, and grilling each other with questions about what our lives are like. I mainly went because my cousin Wes, the one that sparked my idea of optometry by choosing it for himself, was there and I hadn't seen him in a long time.  We chatted back and forth about the profession a little, but until I grasp the specific lingo, we can't really share too much.  He's starting his fourth year and will have to decide what to do next, which will be interesting to watch.  

Pretty good to see everyone.  I sort of decided to hide myself from all this extended family since I didn't agree with them politically or ethically and because my immediate family (excluding my mother) was always kind of the black sheep of the group.  We had a very different mindset than 'the clan', to use my mom's terminology.  At this point in my life, though, I'm putting those differences behind me and just trying to enjoy them for the people they are. Decently-natured, funny, talkative people, caring people.  I won't have many more chances to see them all together like this so I'm glad I took the opportunity.  

Excited to watch the Wimbeldon finals on Sunday. Andy Roddick and Roger Federer. Should be excellent. Unfortunately I'll have to watch it at the gym since I don't have cable at home, but that's okay with me. It gives me something interesting to stare at while I'm on the endless bike. 

I've also dived head-first into home cooking. Gone are the days of frozen dinners and canned soup. Fresh, healthy, properly-spiced food is fantastic and I'm really excited to be doing it.  

I looked at my schedule for the first year of this Optometry nonsense. Holy good god. I knew it was going to be hard. I've been told by countless doctors it would be hard. But it's really. going. to be hard. I have confidence I can do it. It's just going to stretch me to my absolute scholastic limit. I don't know what that feels like, and I'm afraid it might hurt."

"event","Ahhhhh, so I got back last night from a trip to Lincoln City with Sam and Alicia.  Had a perfect time, except for one stupid mistake I made.  We ate an incredible home-cooked salmon dinner the first night, rented two terrible movies that we weren't even able to make fun of, and swam in the Oregon ocean.  That last point bears repeating.  We got in the motherfucking Oregon ocean.  That big stretch of icy-blue water that shakes warm-blooded animals to their core.  The only reason we were able to do so (well, Sam and I anyway.  Alicia will get in the water even if icicles are forming in her hair) was due to the absolutely gorgeous weather.  We couldn't believe it.  The two days we were there were the most gorgeous I have seen our state's coast, hands down.  We threw the frisbee around on the sand, watched kites, ate some great food, and had more booze than any trio ought to.  Oh yeah, so we swam, right?  Well, I apparently figured swimming with the damn house key in my shorts was a good idea...yep, lost it.

So there we are at 4:30 in our swimsuits with no wallets, no phones, no keys, and no connections.  We knocked on a neighbors door and asked to use a phone book and phone to find a locksmith.  It was an old man with a house full of baby toys, clothes, books, and other junk.  He said he had a baby living with him but we never saw nor heard any baby... anyway, after I called all the locksmiths in the area with no success, I finally decided to have a guy from Newberg come up even though it would cost a bunch more due to the drive.  But we needed in.  And quick, because it was starting to get pretty damn cold outside and we hadn't had any food since around 11:30.  The guy told me we'd see him in his white van with squeaky-ass brakes.

About a half hour after he said he'd be there, he pulled up next to us, rolled his window down and asked ""Do you know where Logan road is?"".  He had forgotten the address I'd given him and didn't even know he was on the correct street...sigh... Steve.  Steve gets to work on the lock.  Then he tries the side door after 40 minutes or so.  Then he goes back to the front door after another half hour. Finally, after about 2 hours he got us inside.  It was 8:00 and I had originally called him at 5:00.  But whatever, we were thankful to be back in.  He re-keyed the locks and gave me a new set.  I gave him a beer and his money, and he took off.  We discussed whether or not he was high.  He looked, talked, and behaved like it, but he may have just been a strange sort of dude.  We saw him at Safeway a little while later.  

So besides that bonehead mistake of mine, the trip was a total success.  Very, very relaxing and fun for all of us.  I'll be going out there at least one or two more times before school starts up.

And I'm heading back to Pendleton around the 29th of this month until the 2nd.  

I weighed myself on a scale in Lincoln City and wasn't happy in the least with the result.  Serious gym routine, here I come."

I actually had a pretty decent day.  Got some cooking and cleaning done, finished up the Seinfeld DVD series (I saw only 5 episodes I hadn't seen during regular broadcasts), got the scoop on all my extended family from mom, and hatched plans to head to the coast tomorrow with Sam and Alicia for a couple days!  Very excited to dip my feet into the freezing pacific ocean again.

One drawback of getting up early is that you get tired before midnight even comes around.  So it's not my bedtime, but I'm going to have to make it become so.  Goodnight."

It's definitely a buyers market and it would've been foolish of me to simply shell out 4 more years of rent when my savings could actually be invested and returned.  I invite anyone that wants to come out to do so.  I'm not having a formal house-warming party mainly because anyone I'd want to attend is too far away or doesn't like me anymore.

"event","I've been laid off!!!  With one fell swoop of her gnarled, pointy, gold-ring covered hand, my former boss - one Ms. Dr. Kamelia Massih - has ended my illustrious career as an optician.  Since the job had turned into a mind-numbing exercise of anti-reflective coatings and progressive addition lenses, I'm not too sad to see it leave.  I was never interested in selling stuff.  I just wanted to work around and with optometrists and this was the only way I could do it.  So long, sales.  You will not be missed.  So now that I've filed for unemployment benefits, I've got a few months before school starts up at the end of august.  

I move in two weeks to my place out in Forest Grove (very excited) and from there I start a metamorphosis I've been planning for a long time.  You see, there are some shortcomings of mine that I desperately need to fix.  Now that I'm equipped with a decent stove (where fried eggs don't slide down to the corner of the pan due to those FUCKING slanted coils), I'm undertaking a serious goal of learning how to properly cook.  Sure, I can follow a recipe no problem, but I want to get to the point my brother is at.  Where cooking is just like food chemistry.  Tossing ingredients together in a calculated effort to extract the perfect flavor and consistency.  It'll be many years, but I'm looking forward to the learning process. Food!  Also, it's about time I got my lazy butt back into the gym.  Exercise and eating right.  Who knew that mom was right all this time? :)  

Sprinkle in a few quick trips back to Pendleton, the Oregon coast, and southern California and you've got the makings of a pretty decent summer vacation.  Of course, I'll have to keep looking for work in order to file for my unemployment benefits, but in the state with the nation's second highest unemployment rate, I have low expectations of actually finding anything.

So if you're coming through Portland and feel like kickin' it for a while, just give me a call!  I've got all the time in the world..."

We went to the summit of the still-active Haleakala volcano and hiked down into the black/red/yellow/white sands in the crater.  We travelled on a one-lane two-way road along a shear cliffside mountain to reach the northern tip of the extinct volcano area and hiked along it's rocky shoreline to find a blowhole - an area where sea water is forced through a hole in the rock and spit up in the air a hundred feet or so.  We've snorkled (my first time) and seen tons of fish, coral, eels, and today we finally spotted two large turtles amongst the reef.  Very cool. Yesterday we drove along a long, long, LONG winding road through beautiful, lush green valleys and mountainsides towards a town called Hana.  The town sucked, but it was never the point.  We stopped along the way to see one of the island's black-sand beaches, with strong currents and waves crashing on craggy rocks.  We found some dark freshwater caves nearby with crystal clear water and smooth, wet, overhead rocks reflecting the water.  It's been a very fun exploration of this island.  We covered almost the entire thing.  

And today I finally got time to just lay on the beach and listen to the waves while the warm sun peaked out from behind various clouds.  It's an absolutely beautiful place here and I'm SO glad I've had this week to decompress after my application, test, and interview.  With the best of luck, my acceptance letter will be waiting for me in my mailbox when I get home.

I'm with mom & Tony, and Jeff & Jess.  I use ampersands to denote the fact that they are both couples.  I am noticably single and fifth-wheelish, although Jeff & Jess have made me feel welcome with them.  We went out and got wasted on the second night and had a great time, and we'll all find the less travelled paths that mom & Tony don't feel like exploring.  However, when the nights come and they all crawl into their beds with their corresponding other, I retire to my bed alone.  And I must say it feels VERY alone.  But what's new? 

We fly out tomorrow evening and I get into Portland around 7 in the morning.  Obviously I won't return to work until the next day, so I'm hoping to get my filthy car washed, filthy house cleaned, and watch a movie or two.  Then it's back to boring, old life.  Blech.

"event","My interview is tomorrow morning.  I'll step onto the campus for the first time since I made my visit to it from SOU with Sam so many years ago.  Back then it was just a desire of mine.  Hope of a possible outcome.  I've fought hard through many obstacles and questioned my decision many times, but finally I'm getting my chance at higher education.  It's very satisfying to accomplish a goal like this...at least up to this point.  After this step, it will be completely out of my hands, having done everything I possibly could to make myself a perfect applicant.  And my reward will be four terrible years of mind-crushing classes.  25 credits per quarter, no joke.  It's still an uphill battle, but I think I'm finally ready.  Pacific University, here I come."

"event","I was dreading this test for 3 years.  And now that it's over, a huge weight has been lifted off my mind.  I feel good.  Really good.  I was told a score of 330/400 was the benchmark to shoot for to get accepted.  I think my 350 is a better-sounding number.  I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be starting Optometry grad school in September. :)"

"event","It's now less than two days until my test.  I have not prepared as well as I could have.  Whether or not that will actually affect my score will have to be seen.  I'm basically trusting my brain at this point like I never have before.  Long-term memory has never been a forte of mine, but I think I know all this science stuff pretty well because I actually enjoyed learning it.  The worst-case scenario is that I'll have to put my plans off for ANOTHER year, which would feel very defeating, but isn't the end of the world -- although it would probably feel like it for a couple of weeks.  Everyone has wished me lots of luck, others are more confident than I am that I'll breeze through this, and we're all very sick of hearing me drone on about it :)  So I'm going to go into this thing with a positive attitude, not rush through it but won't drag either, and after 5 horrendous hours, it will be over.  One way or another, it will be over."

"event","I've been neglecting this journal lately.  Mainly because I don't really have anything interesting worth remembering.  For lack of a better descriptor, my life is 'mundane'.  I work, I watch the occasional movie with a friend, I eat, and I sleep.  Oh yeah, and I study.  It hasn't been the 3-hour-a-day cram session I was expecting to throw myself into (and I'll probably be worse for the wear because of that), but it has been the major focus.  My new tactic of relieving the stress is to remind myself that I'm not expected to pull out an A like any classroom exam.  But I do need to get a solid B.  Since the time for learning any new material is completely lost, I have to rely on my long-term memory to get me through, which I've never had to do before.  Everyone I know, including myself, is sick of me talking about it.  My fortune cookie a few weeks ago said ""Talk less of your plans, you'll accomplish more of them"".  Wise words indeed.

So the test is in two weeks.  December 1st.  I'll know my score before I leave the testing center and can gauge my chances of going forward with this plan of mine.  Until then, nothing new to report.  Work really isn't half-bad.  And I have re-developed a love for Lighthouse Bleu Cheese dressing on my salads."

"event","Yesterday I received the fruits of my 13-month horrendous labor at Sears Optical.  My doctor, the esteemed Dr. Richard Zoller, O.D. wrote me a letter of recommendation for my Optometry applications.  Without hyperbole, it is the most incredible thing anyone has ever said about me.  It boosts my confidence that I will be accepted to the school of my choice.  My professor from Ashland should be sending me my academic letter of recommendation any day now.  Then all I have to do is finalize a few essays, get this fucking OAT test out of the way (test date: Dec. 1st), and impress them with my linguistic skills at my interview and I should be golden.  And the day I receive that acceptance letter, there will be much rejoicing."

"event","Since this journal has become nothing more than a place to keep my thoughts for later perusal, it seems fitting to me that I have been neglecting it as of late.  My thoughts have been very limited.  I am very sick of my job at Sears (having a second interview at a private practice this week in order to fix this problem), I am just about ready to submit my grad school applications and take my entrance exam, and other than various social engagements, I don't really see much of anyone anymore.  I suppose it might help if I actually knew someone.  Other than Sam and Alicia, and my two female co-worker friends that dislike each other because they each like me, I'm pretty much alone in the city.  School might change that.  Then again it might not.  I've never been too optimistic of meeting decent people.  There are a lot of idiots out there.  I've always thought so and I'm sure it affects my ability to make new friendships.  I should be more open-minded.  But if being open-minded just means I'll have more friends, mostly idiots with a few gems, is it really worth it?  And then the phrase ""fuck it all"" usually enters my mind around this point of contemplation. My early twenties have turned out to be about as disappointing as my late teens, unfortunately.  My heart has been grabbed, caressed, shaken, ripped, chewed, thrown, and stepped on.  My accomplishments are still completely limited to an academic nature which, really, means nothing to anyone.  My goal of an optometry practice remains singular.  But there's no evidence that will satisfy me any more than a different path. I constantly think that I could use someone by my side for support and to give my overflowing reserves of love to. Yeah yeah yeah. He wants a girl. One that lights his soul. We've heard that one before. He either fucked it up or was rejected. So what're ya gonna do? The time for a personality and image overhaul has long passed.  I leave things up to hope.  A hope that the deep-down decent, intellectual, loving person that I am will someday be accepted by someone.  But in the meantime, I'll go to bed -- and wake up -- alone.  As I have for the past 2 years.  And will continue to hope. I hope that someday I'll look to this journal entry, once I have found love, and be able to smile. Since the wait will have been worth it."

I'm extremely nervous about the outcome and just have to sit around and wait for the results now.  It's completely out of my hands.  The lab final was retardedly difficult, as everyone coming out of it agreed.  Well, if nothing else, it was certainly a nice big fat ""fuck you"" from this class that hates me as much as I hate it.  I just want to pass...that's all I care about now.  Sadly, I'll even settle for a freakin' C.  How bad is that?

On the up side, I'm looking forward to a 9-day vacation starting on sunday! Turn off my brain, get away from all the progressive lenses with their anti-reflective coating, and just chill. the fuck. out. 

Oh yes, and back to the down side.  My aunt Jeanne Hampton passed away just two days ago. She had failing health for quite a while and eventually decided to get off of her dialysis.  The funeral is today and I basically had absolutely no way of attending it with this final and covering for coworkers who requested the day off.  She is in my heart and thoughts today and forever.  She taught me that personal drive is required for this life and that family is incredibly important.  Rest well, Jeanne.

And on the...in between side.  Emotional ridiculousness.  With a cherry on top."

I know I didn't get everything wrong, but I was making way more guesses than I like to on a test like this.  This could be one of my famous ""I think I did terrible but actually did fine"" moments, but there's a good chance I did poorly.  Luckily I was sitting with a decent grade before the test so it would take a huge bomb to drop my grade very low.  I was never gunning for an A in this class.  I just want my B.

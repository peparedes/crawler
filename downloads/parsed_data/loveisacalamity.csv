"event","Hello world!

This is probably going to be the last time I post in quite sometime as a result of school which is preventing me from having a social life of any shape or size ahrghh!!
Point being, I am a few measily paragraphs away from completing all coursework for the year and it feels.. well, almost scary. Turns out I'm sitting on a B+ for my history major, did I mention that history is my least favourite and worst subject? I'm just stocked hey!

Turns out I might be going to Sydney for NYE with Ryan. GT's. I'm so tired I'm not sure if I'm even making any sense. I've been working 9 - 11 hour days for the past three and my brain is on the verge of a burn out but it doesn't seem to be stopping me from being in a good mood.

That's prob. because I have the best friends, the best family and best boyfriend IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

Goodbye world, hope you are all as chuffed as I am! xx"

"event","I always say that I'm going to write from the heart because prose without emotion is futile.

I wrote something recently, a short testimony describing the many ways in which my life has changed and how it's affected me personally. I look back at photographs on my computer of me a year ago and I hardly recognise the person in them. I hear stories of the past, the things I did and said and the ways that I acted, and I don't feel ashamed, if anything I am just relieved that it's over.

Thankyou Maddy, for being there to listen when ever I've needed you (and of course your gorgeous snorty laugh, Sonia the jellybean queen and my msn pal, thanks for being so open with me, through your honesty I now feel comfortable opening up to others, Josh, possibly the biggest most beautiful teddy bear I've ever had the pleasure of meeting, he's taught me so much and told me so many amazing stories and for that I thank him. Yianni, well we all know Yianni as a clumsy hottie who has not only made me laugh until my stomach aches but has also talked me through difficult times and always offered his support. Doolie, you're weird like me and that's why we get eachother. You drive like a maniac but you're always there when I'm upset, even if it's over something stupid. and Fran, well, Fran is basically like the brother holding my hand every step of this new journey. Ryan, my boy, thanyou for all of your patience and determination in helping me get well. Thankyou for all the love, support and encouragement that you offer me, and thankyou for our wonderful relationship that only we get that I wouldn't trade for all the money and fame in the world.

<center>I love you.

Yesterday Juliette recieved, I couldn't get to sleep until really late because I was so excited and motivated to do good things.

Life has changed alot. I feel like I am a different person now, in fact, I know that I am. I feel different. The depression that I've endured for so many years seems like a dream, like it never happened. I don't feel bitter and angry towards anyone because hate is only a useless form of wasted energy. I haven't been out heaps lately because the city doesn't appeal to me anymore, and I can't drink because of the meds I'm on although the idea of drinking is a little off putting altogether. I'm meeting some of the best people I've ever met in my entire life, people that I know I never want to let go of. I can't really explain it. I don't care if people think I'm crazy or mislead, it really doesn't matter. You can bitch about me and I won't fight you, because I don't want to hate anymore. People can spread gossip and that's ok because I know it's not true. I never used to know myself, and now I do, and I'm not my worst enemy anymore, I'm my own best friend."

The dream felt so real, she ran upto me in the street as she always would and grabbed a hold of my hand and her skin was so soft. My mind knew that it wasn't real and must have somehow convinced itself that the entire idea of bumping into Verity in the street was absurd. Just as I opened my mouth to speak to her my sister tore me away from her, not maliciously, but because we were in a rush to get somewhere. I woke up feeling just as I did when I found out about the accident, as if I never really had an opportunity to say goodbye, maybe it was symbolism, I don't know. Anyway, I feel a little better for getting this off of my chest."

"event","i am in a very industrial doc sort of mood. this is good. let me brief you.

if i were a colour i would be a very dark one, like the colour of industrial docs. the untied laces represent that my life is a bit of a mess at the moment, being all over the joint & all. the stitching around the soles of the docs demonstrate that there is some order and neatness to my life, however small & invisable it may seem. the hard, steel cap in the shoe represents how i am feeling - hard & cold and not the most sociable person. the over all aesthetic pleasure gained from viewing the docs is much like the one gained from staring at me wearing them. haha. oh. what a stupid analogy."

"event","The day of yester was quite beautiful, I was graced with gifts of many sorts. Giant rainbow coloured lollypop sweets, books, clothes, music & the most wonderful hand made Japanese journal from the Micah because he knows just how to make this girl smile. We dined in style and feasted upon fine food & wines before retreating home to wrap ourselves up in eachothers arms & reflect upon the pleasantness of the night's events.

Now I am older. I don't feel it or look it I don't think. I do however, look forward to this weekend which shall be spent with good friends consuming beer and vodka and perhaps even some of that deadly Chartreuse i've been reading & hearing about from novels and alcoholic aquaintances.

If you wish to attend such festivities, they will be held this Saturday. Meet myself & others at 8pm sharp at the Exeter. We will then proceed to various places throughout the city (working in time with happy hours mind you!). Hope to see you there.

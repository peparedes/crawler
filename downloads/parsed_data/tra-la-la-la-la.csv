I am now...... www.livejournal.com/~keraunophilliac . Please add my new account if you love me ^.^ 
I just figured seeing as i made my first account with a blank mind and just grabbed tra la la la la out of the air ..... and it's a crappy name.... so here i am.... keraunophilliac! And now i won't lose a whole heap of  posts because i forget to change the year from 2005 to 2012 *angry face*  so yeah..... 

I want to print out all my old posts... but that would take forever.... blergh... i'm just scared that one day the website will cease to exist or lose all the information and a big part of my life that i've repressed willbe completly lost in cyber space.... mmmm i should really get on to that printing out of my past... put it in a box .... then print it out again and put it in another box in another house incase this one burns down.... with a memory as bad as mine.... it's hard to remember anything :("

"event","I need to curl up and sleep... for a very long time. I need to stop listening to depressing music whenever i feel fucked.... I should just ban the smiths from my cd player. Went to Cat and Aarons on saturday, which was ok..... although seeing Aaron act like a guy in front of Crazy MIke and Cameron was weird.... i forget Aaron is a guy until he's put into a macho'ish situation. But once again it was wonderful to talk with Caitlin, i really enjoy talking to her cause she's so intelligent and really opens my eyes up to alot of things. 
I'm feeling really fucking shitty right now..... and i know it's not real, i know it's just the chemicals going insano cause i havn't taken my medication.... but it still feels fucking real and horrible and like my insides are being eaten out. When i feel this bad it's hard to rationalise*sp* but i'm trying, and at least that's stopping me from spiralling i guess. I took a sedative so i should be fine soon..... sleepy and i'll go and listen to my brand spankin' new sex gang children tape(PROUD) and read.I got out prozac nation but i don't think that would be a very healthy choice considering, so i think i'll stick to the extremly close to porn comics and sudoku puzzles.
On a slightly more self involved note, my hair wont stay up properly, my skin WILL not stay good for any period of time, and i' ve been too sick #FLU# to excercise, so i'm feeling bloatey and bad hair--ey and disgusting. Self esteem has never been so low as now... well since i was 14 that is. 
I get to see Lest perform on friday..... i'm extremly excited and nervous at the same time, because i don't see her anymore i'm scared i'm going to waste our short time together, that i'm not as much fun to be around as 'james' or 'leah' or 'mo' ..... she's got her world...... i mean fuck.... she rolled around naked on X with leah and mo...... she lives in the same room with james....... i'm not a part of that...... i've lost my best friend .... she's still my friend..... just not my best friend ....... a best friend knows everything about you.... and you know everything about them.... you can do shit all with them and be fine with that..... sit around hardly saying a word watching bad tv but being happy....... or some shit.... fuck it..... i'm getting sedated... well as sedated as 1 sedative can get me HAHA ..... ok no i've rambled too much bullshit already
goodnight.
btw.... feeling great now... haha by the end of the post and i'm feeling a million times better (which doesn't exactly mean i'm happy right now haha) .... seroquel...mmmm.... how could i live without you (:"

"event","I feel super empty right now. I miss being depressed, well not exactly but it's hard to explain. That's all i was, and now i'm not, it's like there's nothing left of me. Perhaps i'm just full of self pity bullshit... i don't know. I just don't feel too crash hot right now. I took some dexys half an hour ago, still havn't kicked in, but i'm not use to taking dexy's so i'm not sure how many i need to take to feel speedy and good. I've got pills to make me sleep and pills to wake me up and pills to make me happy. That's probably a very unhealthy lifestyle. <P>
Oh well. I had a fun last few days, although for some reason i was starting to get that stomach ache and feeling of dread i get before i start getting depressed, it makes no sense cause i've been taking my tablets... but there it was, and now i'm scared. but also kind of excited in this sick way. I don't know, maybe it's just i want something i just don't know what it is. I just feel really empty like there's something really big missing. For now i'll just fill that unexplained hole with pills and alcahol and friends.<P>
Speaking of friends.... it's hard to give all my friends the attention and time i wish i could give them. I'm such a bad friend.. i know that... i need to make more time, more effort... (wow i feel them kicking in) ... more love et cetera. I need to get off my fat arse and spend time with those i love. Which i have been doing.... but ... well... it's hard to make time for everybody ... which makes me sound haha really full of myself.... but it's true... and esp. since most of my friends have jobs and school and uni and the such. Blergh. <P>
Saturday was alright.... i think i had more fun getting dressed up with Prew before hand then i did at the actual club... but it was still a really good night, the bad thing i think was the sad lack of money so we couldnt' get really pissed *pout* But the DJ was beautiful and although he started out playing some god awful tracks... he was very open to suggestion and obliged t our requests .Thanks to Prews subtlety haha i made out with a (skuppy)boy at excom just b4 i left, which was fun, brief but fun.<P>
 Most people were on X... it was cute but the look on Prews face was priceless.... i don't think they noticed how much they were annoying her though :P ahhh the wonders of drugs . I saw Tom again..... god i miss him... and seeing him again just made me feel so nostalgic.... imust make a point of spending time with him (again with the time!)<P>
 I'm so goddamn fucking lucky to have the friends i have and i love them all so bloody much and i try to be a good friend it's just so hard ...... most of them ahve seen me through the worst times in my life(so far...haha mz optimism) and i hope they know i want to be there for them too.... although i never know what to say.... you're sitting there and they're telling you their deepest fears and experience and you have no idea what to say... wishing that the brainy gods will give you some sort of witty yet encouraging thing to say to them to make them feel better. BLAH! <P>
I'm getting ever so slightly better at drawing on my eyebrows which is so exciting.... i know it's sad.... but they're really hard to do i swear! Everybody was giving me complaiments about how beautiful i was on saturday... ok ok so it was the people on X and they would probably have said the same thing if i came in looking my worst..... but it was still an ego boost :P 
So in conclusion... people on X rock because they think you're the most wonderful beautiful thing they're ever seen ....for about 5 minutes.... plus they make Prew put on her cute angry/frustrated/annoyed/stabby face .....sorry Prew... but it really is cute. *hides*<P>
I am home now...... feeling all speedy ! yay! wishing i had of stayed at Prews now.... we could have drunk goon... and played monopoly....... and watched family guy! Oh and on my way home i went to get a drink at macca with my last $2.60 in the bank... and my card was declined.... twice..... it was embarressing...... i had checked my balance seconds before...... he was nice and said i could just pay him back another time... but i still felt poor and stupid.<P>
I can't wait till my boots gfet here..... oh ohoh oh ohhhh  they shall be GREAT!
They're all knee high and buckley with big platform sole.<P>
Hehehe It's  come to point form because i can't stay on one topic :P
I can't wait to modify and make my new jacket 'mine' ... thinking of going to the shop thingo in wooloowin and getting lots of studs and going on the net and getting a cinema strange patch and bllaaaaahhhhh so excited .... which is lame..... no it's not lame.... just voicing it is lame..... i am lame... lame lame lame.... but would you want me any other way? 
.....actually probably yes 
.......... I have only 25 minutes until my off peak downloading can begin YAY! i'm gonna download the rest of corpse bride and be the first of all YOU to see it! *MWAHAA* And some more spaced...nothing like good old fashioned english comedies. Does comedies have an ie? or is it comedys? Dictionary.com is my best friend.
Wow i should get dexys off dad more often.... it's good to just write and write and write.... i think i'll take them when i start exercising again... i mean...... it'll help a fuckload
Cat and Aarons next Saturday :) for drinks and intellectual conversation and perhaps some trivial pursuit 
""Peter, what colour is a fire engine?"" *giggle*
Only Prew, my cousin and skitz are online.... Prews busy, my cousin...well i havn't got much to say to him:P, and i don't talk to skitz cause he was mean to Akhen..... so methinks i should watch some more the dick van dyke show.
Tar tar......."

I've applied for lots of coles myer jobs, it's time this lady of leisure did something with her life. My biggest wish is to have a job, go to bed at a reasonable time, get up early, go for a run, eat breakfast,  go to work, get home and watch neighbours and eat dinner, and then on the weekend go out with friends, and then do it all again next week. Mmmmm to be a normal functioning citizen ~dreams~

I'm sick of having to take the good with the bad, ie. spending time with people that i like that also happen to be around people with really bad make up and think that they're so GAF because they have a cradle of filth shirt on and they're wearing make up that consists of red and black smeared over thier faces (melting off) . God i know i'm a superficial whore but really.... when i'm trying to sleep listening to such memorable quotes as <b>'hahaha emos suck, they think they're so goth but they probably don't even know who the murderdolls are' </b>*twitch* No no i need much alcahol to go through that again. Adding to that the fact that i have to save money for bond when Shelley and I move out. But I do so want to see a bunch of people, beautiful people. I know i'm a horrible person..... haha everyone says i'm 'cute' and i say 'no no i'm a horrible person' and then they giggle like the fact that i could be a horrible person is cute.... they'll soon learn.... *Crazy eyes*
I finally got to have a conversation with Bek.... that girl is so fucking lovely, i should stop being so scared to talk to people. Haleys trying to teach me to be more punk, and i think Prew was as well... but i can't quite remember cause we drank quite a lot of vodka... however i'm far too much of a lady to be punk :< Goodness i even spat... whilst calling Haley a fucking tit.... doesn't quite work on me, even if my hawk is up. schmeh

(note:there shall be many exclamation marks in this post) I was all on my lonesome and right at the back.... but jesus fucking christ i could see her face and her legs and her feet and when she done her orgasm head throw back thing and her dancing between the pianos i thought i was going to die!! I cried so much *blush* but in all fairness i have been waiting for Tori since Celeste started coming to school and singing leather and cornflake girl when we were 9 ....i'm turning 18 next month! 9 years of listening to Tori..... of having her songs there in every situation and emotion. 
Basil was there(he was with Rachaels old housemate and Colin the carpenter..... Brisbane is soo small).... that made me sad.... esp. when tear in your hand played and i remembered when i would listen to that non stop post Baz.
Speaking of which.... so much bloody eye candy at the Tori gig..... mmmmm Tori's honey attracts pretty goths and hippies.
Eye candy.... all it is at the moment.... i can't get him out of my mind and he's the only one i want.... it's fucking annoying.... me the poster girl for polygomy actually is only interested in one person right now :( It's down right disgusting and i hope it stops soon. In the meantime i'll just hope that his girlfriend dies a horrible death and i can rush in to be a shoulder to cry on ;) ....*stop thinking evil thoughts stop thinking evil thoughts*"

"event","Morticias was excellent.... even though two people didnt' turn up that i was really looking forward to seeing .... Dale and Akhen.... feel bad!! .... thus my  intended very small group of about 4 or 5 people turned into .... well actually 4 .... but only because of the beautiful mr. Joseph (my god that boy never ceases to amaze me as to just how sexy he can be)
As for getting there early and helping set up.... well i blu tac'd some posters outside and spent the rest of the time smoking drinking and listening to fucking awesome music...... so basically the night started out at 7 for me. However i felt really really bad that i was kind of useless..... although i'm sure i made up with that with my always interesting and witty conversation.... heh. 
Overall.... my fake 18th was lovely :) Got very trashed with Jordan... which was wonderful.. i hadn't seen that trashy boy in quite some time. Spent the whole night flirting with the bargirl... fuck she was beautiful.... but i was too chicken to ask for her number ::hangs head:: She gave me double shots and a kiss on the cheek when i had to go ::blush:: 
Speaking of beautiful girls..... Lola the Vamp was fucking amazing..... oooh i hope i was sober enough to not be too vocal with my.... feelings..... but god she was awesome..... i think i should like to see more of her shows.
Stayed at Davids that night..... goodness that boy knows more about my sex life than anybody else..... god i blurt out some fucking embarressing things when i'm pissed.... 
Am home now....  just about to go have a smoke and watch rowan atkinson live..... ::nods::
 Hopefully have another wonderful dream tonight like i did the other night..... made me want to get on a plane and fly straight to Sydney as soon as i woke up so i could make that rather vivid dream come true...... unexpected and kind of creepy but enjoyable while i was sleeping ;P
Downloading about 20 music videos right now, life couldn't get any better than with fast downloads.

p.s. like my new icon? i like it cause i can manipulate her into saying anything i like :P"

On other news.... i am once again in love with Jim Croce. *sigh*

"event","I went to Megan, Lauren and Will's housewarming party on friday where i :
-got very trashed
-wrestled with a big metalhead in the kitchen over beer
-had a punk do my mohawk up so that i looked like a punk
-Spat on said metal head
-Tossed beer at Snailz when he commented on Celestes laugh
-Made a friend
-Almost lost a friend (well so i thought in my drunken state)
-vomited numerous times over the fence of the school across the road with the forementioned 'new friend'
-- we thought it would be fun to see what it was like to be bulemic so we stuck our fingers down our throats, resulting in much vomiting
-Saw a beautiful beautiful boy and so proceeded to walk around staring like a zombie at his back and asking around who that beautiful boy was.

and not in that particular order.

I'm far too influenced by my hair style at the time of absolute inebriation. *Sings*  ""come with me... and you'll be ... in a world of pure inebriation"" and also at that point i generaly fall in love with 
<lj user=frenzy666>.... which is very annoying cause he's such a great friend, and when i get drunk and 'fall in love' with him it takes away all the fun of getting drunk with Dale.... and that's a fuck load. I've always found him one of the best people to get drunk with because he doesn't judge and he just goes along with the flow.... hmmmm beautiful boy :)
speaking of which...

Next day.... ventured to Sandgate to see Caleb.. .he helped me make my deck much much better (God he is a fucking genius)
Then off to Celestes house where we drank wine and talked and talked and talked like we havn't done in so long. It was fucking intoxicating to spend time with Celeste again..... without James there as well. I love the boy heaps.... but Lest and i need Grrly time... ie. get drunk and talk about James and my 'love' of the week ....or in fact day:P ... nah it's so much more *happy sigh* 
My last post went completly invalid once i saw Celeste :) 

Hopefully moving out with <lj user=miss_pink_paws> . So if you know of any 2 bedroom places around city area that are not too expensive.... that would be much appreciated. A house  decorated by Emilie and I????? most beautiful house in brisbane ;)!
hmmm that update was much longer than the 'quick update' i was planning on. Ahhh well if you've read this far then you must really be bored or love me heaps >.< hahaha

I don't think i should do anything for the next month or so. I've found the perfect place to live in new farm and i need to save to get bond. My mother lost $5000 so for once in my life i have to do something without my mothers help.  So this should be interesting. 
<P> A place all to myself.... i cannae wait. It's going to be so beautiful. And my shopping list will look a little something like this :
                               -wine
                               -rice

I love that song on the bonds add 'hey playgirl' god it makes me peppy.

*PEP*

I really am getting sick of most people. Some people i know... or knew rather,... are so stupid, and i am one who puts a lot on intelliegence so therefore for me to be in the company of unintelligent people it pisses me off. Also, people who don't know bands, that pisses me off. He he i have been internet-less for quite a while now and i need to vent all my hatred! 

<P> 
*PEP PEP*
I guess i'm just sick of wearing my heart on my fucking wrists.(EVERYBODY i have spent more than at least 10 minutes with have seen me cry) I'm sick of people hurting me, i'm sick of being weak, and unlike my father who has lived with a lot of the same problems i face, i will stop them from taking over my life. I found out yesturday that my dads g/f has a brain tumour*sp* and will be dead within 2 years... I have grown really close to her. But now i'm seeing my dad do exactly what he did to us, to another family, and i'm emotionally involved with them all(except for the 14 year old girl, she's one of those uncultured gits who cuts all her jeans into pants that are too short to even be called hotpants. I told her she's going to get raped by a dirty old man. That made me smile. Creepy thing is she keeps copying me. I hate stupid white trash.<P>
<P> Anyway, i have decided to act hard and cold and maybe someday after i've lied to myself enough, one day i really will be cold and hard. Then i can actually read <i>certain</i> peoples livejournals without feeling stabby pains in my stomach *STAB*
<P><P> Morticias was fun. Proud to be a small part in quite a lovely transformation. Danielle was sooo beautiful *blush* but i don't think she likes me very much.... but hopefully i can change that. Celebrating my fake 18th thier next month. hehe that should be fun, meet some beautiful people who have beautiful taste in music.... mmmmmm a gothic club that actually plays gothic music >.<

"event","Alright.... past few days.... hmmm perhaps the past week or more.. yes that should do quite nicely...
Well  the one thing that is clouding my whole mind and taking over all my thoughts is the woman i saw on the train the other night when i was coming home from Calebs. My god, i swear i saw murderdolls more than a few  times on that train trip!;) (don't worry it's not supposed to make sense)
But Fuck was she the most perfect woman i have ever seen, she was this Russian goth with the most beautiful hair and eyes and make up and jesus christ was her accent sexy! *swoooooons* I wanted to go and say hi to her but i was far too in awe and scared and nervous and all thatk, plus i speak english and she was with a friend already and ..... bleh.
But before i saw 'her' i was at Calebs house which was so fucking awesome, got drunk off beer!!!! yes Kelly not only drank beer but actually drank enough to get her drunk! :| Played magic..... kicked some geeky ass! ;) My deck is not only the prettiest but it also is rather deadly. It's so great to spend time with Caleb, which i would have been doing today except i am so ill right now, all sniffly and blockey and fluey:( and i forgot to take my medication for a few days so my head feels like it's going to explode... God i whinge...
<lj user=""morath"">David </lj user=""morath""> Was over for a couple of days which was nice because i had a reason to get pissed and he had somebody to get pissed with. Oh! and my father bought me a car finally..... it's a piece of shit dihatsu charade or something >.< bleh . but it's drivable apparantly so that's all i need right now. One day.... oh one day that dodge shall be mine. And then! only then! will i be truly goth.
Speaking of being truly goth.... i got work at Morticias! granted it's only volunteer work(all thier money goes towards keeping it running) but still it's something to put on my resume, it's experience and i'll have lots of eye candy. ;) All and all i'm a happy camper right now.
Ahh one more thing before i go, i have, after Calebs success with this, decided to close in my circle of friends. Basically i want to have a smaller circle of friends and focus on them, rather than having hundreds of friends[slight exageration] all around Brisbane and having far too many places to go and hardly any people that i even like very much or that put any effort into our friendships. So basically if you still want to be friends with me just dont' leave it all up to me.
Well that's a sufficient update for now, i shall leave you now with the horrifying news that thier is a flying cockaroach in my room :\ that is determined to kill me, it flew STRAIGHT AT ME! :| No bullshit, i ducked and swerved and i thought it was on my nightie so i ripped that off as quick as i could and i almost ran out into the hallway without my nightie on :$ and i wasn't under the influence of hallucinagenic sleeping pills this time!"

After reading your letter, after reading those names, i had to go and take 5 sleeping pills to calm me down. Which is ridiculous i am aware.... but it's how i feel, and i can't control that(believe me i've tried) the very sight or sound or even idea of thier names make me feel like my body is completly covered in third degree burns, makes me have to take 5 pills so i wont end up taking 100 in ten minutes time. I can't help it... and i have improved a hell of alot since it happened, i mean i can walk out of my house now, and maybe one day i can come to your 28th b'day party and i'll be fine, but for now i don't think i'll be able to go, i'll just ruin your night if i do.

"event","Verse One]
I didn't tell anyone about what I seen or heard that day, mums the word still 
I'm scared to plant ideas into your head while your rebellious side is fertile 
Hurdles are getting knocked down
I'm running a losing race 
Your legs aren't the only ones marked up How many dreams have you chased? 
If I could have said this to your face maybe you wouldn't have to write like I do, 
Except I use paper instead of my body now; it's something you might want to try too 
From haikus to horror stories, it's something in our blood that we share, 
Something in our blood that appears on the surface of our skin when we bring it there 
My facial expression said I didn't care 
Hate and aggression must've made an impression on the little kid who stared, 
Sitting on stairs when I would bother to bring my skates 
My feeble attempt at being a strong, big brotherdoing father figure 8's 
Ripping my cape on the ground that it dragged on 
Tripping on fate and hearing the sounds of a sad song 
Listen, it's great sharing time now that dad's gone, 
But what's with the choice of words?
Or the body parts that you decided to tag them on? 
I'm a bagabond who moved to modern day Babylon and then back again 
With minimal contact and you know I can't ask your mom what's happening 
You've got such beautiful gifts What are you doing ruining the packaging? 
How ironiccome to thinkI probably put this ink on my back for him 
I want you to laugh and sing more, 
But you dropped anchor in a place
where dreams go to die and you're keeping your ass indoors 
I'm asking for you to stick it outand see things through 
You're asking for me to zip my mouth and keep it just between me and you 

[Chorus]
If I could have been there from the beginning if I could be there right now 
if I could promise to be there when you need me, would it raise an eyebrow? 
How would your body be different if I still dropped by for visits? 
Is it my place to put a smile on your face? 
Could I erase your body language telling you its all been said before? 
Or change the words you wrote, exchanging your scars for my metaphors? 
I'd add them to my collection while smiling 
Next time you want to paint with razor blades and need a canvas use my skin 

[Verse Two]
You're hiding your sins well, but I see the hell that your limbs speak 
Tongue in cheek Lying awake in bed while other kids sleep 
The strength of evil begins to keep your grins weak 
No matter the length of the needle
marking up one's body is so much more than skin deep 
Feel the pin prick The grim reep what they sew and you're trained to say that you're fine 
Your thresh hold for pain is greater than mine 
So I'm waiting in the lines that you give mepatiently, 
While you get cut in the lines that THEY make YOU wait inin ways that they can't see 
If there's a vacancy as far as room in your life goes, 
say it to me Don't do it with a knife under your clothes 
Because the anguish of hidden skinis letting my ghosts be shown 
Plus the language its written in hits especially close to home 
I'm most alone when I'm out of touch with the people who feel this type of pain 
You might just aim for a day that its rainingto strike a vein to take my name in 
Changing your uniform and altering your mind set 
Has your pointer finger decided if it was a fault of his or mine yet?I bet 
I know the dialect It's nowhere I haven't been before 
With skin that's sore Battle scars that rise from our inner war 
Are decorative medals of honor that our father decided to pass through inheritance 
And it is repetitive when the kids head in the direction of evidence
proving the pain and hurt is relative 

All this pain and hurt is relative 

(repeat chorus)

<P>
Spent from wednesday till monday basically with Rachael... which was just lovely :) Got to see many people i love and met some new people ^Rachaels new roomate!!! i'm in lust!!!^ yes well *ahem* Didn't take enough pills with me... the a.d. kind.... so i got home feeling rather fucked in the head, so sorry anybody  who had to/tried to talk to me last night especially i wasn't myself. Not saying i didn't mean all i said, my mind is full of such paranoia of late. Or perhaps just realizations, whatever it is i'd rather not have them. Ignorance is wonderful, stupidity is the key to happiness.  I found out the beautiful Ben is living in Sydney !!!! So i shall be going there soon and then i might go down to Melbourne!! (Rachael is leaving for Melbourne in about 2 weeks :( my mummy ) Although i came to a very very good decision that i shall go to Sydney when it is much cooler! 
Saw Jordan that was nice... however i was bored and tired and slightly drunk and pissed off at the time :P so not much conversation was made... but it did remind me how perfectly pretty and lovely he is so i should try to hang out with him soon. Also saw the always bubblicious Sean and we signed a contract that he is now my lover :P legally!! 
<P> Should i  go to the angelspit do this saturday??? Brody shall be doing her Burlesque show so i think i should
Ahhh pills kicking in ... i should go to bed so i can wake up nice and early tomorrow like a normal functioning citizen."

I have decided that for my 18th i shall be having a dinner/gathering/party type thing at Draculas. I havn't yet been there but it looks fantastic and sounds perfect! It does cost a pretty penny or two .....or $59 and it has to be payed when i book it, and seeing as most of my friends are bums i thought i should warn now that you will need $59 minimum by about march or April methinks. So far on the list of people to invite are as follows...
Caitlin and Aaron... and Bob if he'll get off his arse and come hang out with us!
Lest and James
Caleb dear :)
Timothy
Dale
Claire
and many more that wish to come and can afford it! And i have learnt from my lesson from my 17th party that as wonderful as all of my friends are, i do have friends from too many different subcultures and bringing them all into the same building is a very bad idea! :|

The dress code for this Draculas do is fancy! over the top! Lavishy dressed and make up to match!  :)
However knowing me i'll keep changing my plans for my birthday... but i really do hope that this one eventuates. mmmmmm  i'm going to have a bondage cake! ;)"

"event","Can't really say much. Am definatly going back to Sydney soon. All i have to do is work out living arrangments.... i don't want to spend so much money on some greasy motel. Must be in newtown as that is where i love, that is where my iced chocolate addiction can be fed, and that is where all the beautiful people walk past so casually. Would muchly like to go to the batcave again, however this time it will be before i take my sedatives. I will drink much more this time and i may perhaps even socialize, if i'm feeling particulary crazy. Methinks this shall be liberating, venturing out all on my lonesome. Kind of scary, who will look after me in Sydney :( ?"

After a few drinks you start to feel lonely. Hence<br>the reason you find the most readily available<br>person and start making out with them. Who<br>cares right? You can always use the excuse 'I<br>was sooo drunk!'.

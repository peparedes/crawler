I love you Julie, member of Julie Eat Cake, lover of pie, icing on the cake of life, Charlotte, friend, and roommate. You are a favorite, and will always always always remain so. 

May we rememeber forever that we were once the greasest foursome in the history of the universe part two. That no one will ever compare to our greatness. No one will laugh, joke, play, dance, sing, or goof like we do. 

What we had was beautiful, and nothing can ever take that away. 

I will miss you as a roomate but never as a friend becuase you will always be in my heart.

"event","There once was a little chick named Chig. 

Chig's mother had told him once that he could be anything he wanted to be...in the whole world. 

""If you can dream it, you can do it,"" the mother told her son one afternoon.

""Mommy, I want to be a pork chop!"" The little yellow bubble of fur told his wide-eyed mother.

She looked at her son and replied,""Except that, little chick, except that.""

""But Mommy, I want to be a pork chop.""

The little chick's father stormed into the hen house at hearing this exclamation, and banished his son forever. ""I will have no pork chops living in this house!"" he shouted as Chig hastily threw his few belongings in his little suitcase made for a chicken and ran off into the sunset.

Chig, after acting on broadway, starting a new dance craze, and starring in several Wallace and Gromment productions, at last found a way in which to fufill his life long dream. He slapped a piece of ham on his back, creating a ""pig suit"", and then became Sonnie's dinner.

My fingers are still frozen from the walk back from the Market where Julie and I both had absolutely delicious salads and chicken parmesan. Yummy. On the Way back SnowBall Phil got stuck to Julie's Pants because she was, alas, not wearing galoshes, like me. We had some good times with Snowball Phil, who lost a lot of weight by the Greenhouses. But its ok, he gained it all back before he suddenly disappeared again by the math building. After we lost Phil into the infinite abyss, Julie and I sang a couple rousing choruses of ""These are a few of my Favorite things"". A song that fits perfectly at the moment. We jumped in puddles, I did a dance fit only for those wearing galoshes, and sang, very off key, at the top of my cold, cold lungs.

We got back and I took off my wet galoshes, and then Julie reminded me we were going to set out a pan in order to make snow ice cream. Now, I'm not sure if this is actually any good, but if it is...YAY.

Also, I forgot to tell the story of what happened to me yesterday.

I woke up at like 7:30 cause I'm dumb and insist on taking a shower in the morning. I figure I've got like a ten minute cushion in which I can sleep a little longer. I wake up ten minutes later, get to our bathroom...and our damn light won't turn on. I stand there flicking the switch for like 5 minutes cause I'm still not quite awake. And then make a decision. I need the lamp by our bed. I can't take a shower in the dark, that's ludicrous. I also can't leave the door open, because I don't want Julie waking up and thinking I'm nuts cause I didn't shut the bathroom door. So I go back to the bed, and spend like 5 minutes messing with the nightstand, trying not to knock over water again (like I did the night before), while getting the lamp out from under it. Finally, as I fall back on my bed with the lamp on top of me, I retrieved it from its place between the nightstand and wall. (Wouldn't it have been weird if it was bed and wall...like the song.) I take the lamp and the extension cord to the bathroom. I plug it is, turn the switch, and it doesn't work. I can't get the switch to turn the other way...the knob had fallen off earlier. So What happened? I ended up taking a shower like half an hour late and in the dark. I left the door open, which was weird feeling. I also left Julie amazed with my determination to take a shower. I think it was God telling me not to sleep in.

I'm watching Beauty and the Beast, its a winter wonderland outside, I don't have class for 2 more hours, and my fingers have fully defrosted. Life is Fantastic!"

BTW we didn't actually buy 49 burritos, we bought 6.

Sonnie ate 5.I had 6 tortillas, queso, and the other burrito.

My flat pattern class got cancelled and that was exciting. I also worked with Guache in Illustration, which was exciting, I love my little 2"" face.

Within the last two hours, I have contributed to the consumption the following: Two pieces of orgasmic cheesecake (One with Berrys and regular cheesecake, the other with chocolate swirl and wonderful chocolate sauce), half a Sara Lee Cherry Pie, Half a pint of Vanilla Ice Cream, Half a tube of cookie dough, half a tub of queso (with chips). THERE WERE ONLY THREE OF US. Well, Katie did help eat the cheesecake. But, not really. And they were HUMONGUS pieces of Cheesecake. 

We made a late night United Run (bout 10:30)to get the Pie, before we realized Nick had made the Cheesecake, but after we knew we'd eat the Queso. The cookie dough was an impulse purchase. Also, what is pie without Ice Cream? 

I ran around for like 15 minutes screaming Pie. Talking about how PhePhe is Julie's Homegirl, and running into someguy's car. Oh yes, The guy was sitting in his car, on his cellphone, when I almost crushed my PIE into his headlight. However, there was no collision, so all is well. 

We also were pimp dancing to music I've never heard of, and making cops think we were drunk, when we most definately were not. They never said anything though, which just shows...something. 

I am so sick right now.

I scared so many people screaming PIE at them. And I also think that I confirmed to Nick that I am, in fact a Crack head.

But I'm not. 

Oh yes, Julie got her parking spot back, which is possibly the best accomplishment of all.

There were also many episodes of Gilmore Girls to be watched. 

I have a great and t00by love for LUKE.

I did nothing productive to day.

Actually, thats not entirely true. I went to school and shoe shopping.Plus I did a bit of sewing on my dress. I'm still not sure on how to do the skirt. I'll work that out this weekend.....in Austin. Woohoo....I'm so excited.

Stupid Government and history, etc. Not to mention I have been working my ass off on the Musical, which I don't plan on getting a credit for, and the Medieval wedding, which is just fun. We have to go around an beg corporate places to donate lots of stuff. So far Lone Star Wings, Fat Daddy's, Daddio's, Wal-Mart, Sam's, Tate's Barbecue, many printer and paper places have helped us out. So far we are meeting our budget of ""get everything for free"". Oh yes, and I lended my services to making the actual wedding dress. Don't all wet your pants now, it was a pattern.

In recent news (as in not 1399...haha...you don't get it) I saw 50 First Dates with Mikey and died laughing when Drew B. beat up Rob S. with a baseball bat. Sweet Jesus it was funny. Speaking of Jesus I saw the funniest thing while at the Movies. 

Ok so you you know that The Passion of the Christ came out this weekend, and a bunch of Bible groups went to see it. Anywho, I was taking a piss and noticed the business cards of no less than 4 different Churches trying to catch new converts in their treacherous web of Christ-ly worship. I nearly died, it was so funny.

So over the weekend there was the TAPPS District Art competition. My dress got first in crafts; I was throughly excited, and my on-site drawing got 4th, which means of all things that I get to go to Austin. I (Would be Italics, but I'm a bit behind on the whole computer thing, so I don't know how to do that.) get to go to the State Art competition, which is the same weekend as the State Academics, which Mikey gets to go to. How throughly exciting. Also I think Midget and Marie are going for seek and sketch and on-site photo. It should be fun. 

School Work has sucked ass as of late, I can't seem to catch up in Calculus, and its pulling down my GPA. But wha wha wha...it could be worse. At least I'm passing. However, I'm pretty sure Post has pegged me as the git to ignore this semester. Maybe if I just shut up then I'd be slightly less annoying. Oh Well. Have I ever Shut Up before?     

That seems to be the precise problem with me lately. I bring up the stupidest things and make them into issues. I think I see to many movies/ TV shows/ Read to many romantic plot lines (And I don't mean Fabio-esque men with their shirts half open and the women with the heaving bosoms. I mean romantic, as in ideal. An ideal sort of situation. Its a simile folks. Oh and did you know there is no simile for the word simile? thought it was a bit odd.) Like the other day I was talking to Mikey and got mad at him for something stupid, this makes absolutely no sense now but trust me...I understand what I'm talking about. And that is all that matters.

You know recently I debated about trying to write a book. hmmm. Ive desperately though about it for a while. Having one masterpiece of great literature....really literature, with symbolism and meaning. Writing the great American Novel. Kinda with a Catcher in the Rye attitude (With slightly subdued cussing), but a Frankenstein meaning. (Not that I want to write a book about a monster, but you know Mary Shelley wrote the big F when she was 18 or 19, I forget which. Though I guess it would be hard to classify Frankenstein as the great American novel, because its Brit-lit, but hey. Its still one of my favorites. Any-who I mean write with as much depth behind the psyche as Shelley did, not necessarily about a monster.) I think maybe I've enjoyed my English classes way to much. (Although really I don't think that will come until I start rambling about how Greek Heroes aren't heroic because they are indestructible. Thanks Inman, you've taught me all I know)I dunno, maybe someday, after many revisions it will come out and people everywhere will read My Literature and call it art. 
 
Maybe someday English classes will study Me.

Nope

Pretty Sure that won't happen. I will grow old and remain a mediocre woman with a spunky attitude and a shining outlook on every life but her own.

Oh Well, if it is my destiny....It will be.

I'm gonna run.

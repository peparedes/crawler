"event","Halloween is coming up, and im going with angela, angela and cody. Weird huh? 2 codys and 2 angelas, this is going to be confusing! And whats even weirder is that there going out too! I'm really excited though, cody and angela are going as milk and cookies, and me and angela are going as peanut butter and jelly. Me and Angela are going to make our own costumes, which should be alot of fun. Hopefully costumes take a while to make, and arent just like a 1 hour project."

"event","Today went well. I took my Spanish exam and got a 135 out of 140. I had already taken my basketball exam and got an A also. Since I had already taken my basketball exam I got to leave at 9:25. Then I went back to school at 11:32 to see Angela. I said I was coming to get Nick and Brandon, but the only reason I went was to see Angela. I got to see her for about 20 minutes. I could've seen her longer, but Nick and Brandon were waiting and she felt bad for making them wait for me. I don't blame her, I just wish I could've seen her longer. Even though I see her everyday I still miss her if that makes any sense."

"event","This is so gay!!!
My mom couldnt dive mto the horror pops concert, even though shes known about it for almost a month!!
So this means I missed both an awesome band and a chance to see Angela.
Also, had I been at the concert that night I wouldnt have gotten bored and reached into my drawer to find a guitar pic, and gotten cut by a knife and cant bend my finger.
GAY!!!!"

The highlight of my trip was either the skatepark (which sucked) or meeting an amish guy named paul at the airport. I didn't know amish people even used airports. But i'm really glad to be back."

Then Justin's frined Amanda came over...and in about half an hour justin and amanda were in the guest house with the door locked and I heard moaning....so we know what was going on....but in the middle of it justinsd mom came out and was about to unlock the door....and right before she did I was like Ms. Bonnie, I want a candy bar, let's go up to the store...and it actually worked!!! Justin owes me big time....although that is a pretty gross story....but it was hilarious"

On a different subject, I read some comments on my journal that Angela left me that were just so sweet that they left me speechless...I love that girl so much, she's got me wrapped around her finger, I would do anything for her....and tomorrow is the last day of school, I'm really not sad though...i'll see all of my friends next year, and i'm going to see Angela in the summer(hopefully i'll see her alot) so I have no worries. This year has gone by so fast though.....so begins a new chapter....."

"event","Wrestling was awesome today, there was no conditioning, just nothing but wrestling. (  Conditioning is all the running and exercises that we do ). I wrestled the same Sophmore three times. The first time he beat me 6 to 10. The next match I pinned him and won, and the third match I slammed him HARD, and then pinned him and won. But after the matches and everything I saw something that I really didn't like. This one wrestlers girlfriend came in and was waiting for him to finish so that he could show her the new kitten that she had bought, and he just started yelling at her about how she should never come in the gym when we are wrestling and told her to go wait in the car....he used plenty of obsenities and even dropped a few F-bombs. I just hope that I NEVER act like that to Angela, and that I always treat her the way that she deserves to be treated......On a different subject tomorrow is the last fuly day of school!!!!YES!!!!! Summer will be great!!!!! Except for the ten day focus camp...ugh! I won't go into detail about what that is.....it's nothing gross though, if thats what youre thinking...."

It's also strange that around my friends I can always think of something to say, yet around her I draw blanks, or i'm too nervous to say what I want to.  Like when i'm cuddling with her at school I just want to tell her how much I care about her.  Or when we're walking in the hallway and she is literally two inches away from me, I just want to reach out and put my arm around her....but when I try I just can't.  I also hope that she isn't getting annoyed because i'm always around her whenever I can be....it's just that I care about her SOOOOOOOOO much, and I worry that I won't be able to see her much over the summer."

I was pretty mad at him....I mean it would have been really funny if it were any other girl that he filmed though.....
No plans for tomorrow, I guess i'll just hang around the house, unless one of my friends calls. This is the last week of school, gotta make it fun, and say goodbye to some. I thought up a pretty good prank.....it works in theory, but i'm not sure if it will work in reality. The plan is to take powdered laundry dtergent and spread it all lver the soccer fields, then in the morning when the sprinklers turn on it will creat huge bubbles all over the field, it would be hilarious. Although it would be alot of work, so I probably won't do it."

It's fun but i'm SO sore afterwards! I gave Angela her birthday present today....it's one day early but I wasn't sure if she was going to be at school on her actual birthday. It was a Flogging Molly shirt and a Dashboard Confessional cd. She seemed to like them......which made me really happy, because I love when she is happy.
And for some strange reason I thought about her alot after school today......I mean I think about her after school everyday, but today I just couldn't get her off of my mind, even when I was wrestling. I can'y wait until she gets off of grounding either, so I have something to look forward to on friday nights (it's just not that exciting to go to the movies or other places like that with my guy friends anymore)......and I also hope that I can see her this summer.........see what I mean, I can't stop thinking about her.....I intended to write this entry about how much fun wrestling is.......but I ended up writing like 3 lines about wrestling and like 10 about her!!!!!! But it's ok, because she is more pleasant to think about than sweaty men jumping all over me (I don't enjoy thinking about things like that, unlike travis) lol j/k, although travis does have some homosexual tendencies......"

Next I was happy because i got to talk to Angela. then my arm felt a little better and I started to skate.... A guy there saw me and asked me to do a run for him to see, so I did and he was really impressed....I then found out that he was the owner of the skatepark and he asked if I wanted them to sponsor me!!!!! Of course I said yes, They gave me a free tee and i canj go now whenever I want for free. Finally I went home and told my mom about my arm and she took me to the emergency room...........The dodctor said that my rotator cuff was messed up, then he satrted talking medical jibberish......the doctor said I couldn't skate for at least two months....pssshh like that's gonna happen, but all in all I guess that it was a good day."

I read through the f-list a bit, but when I realised that I haven't checked it for months, I sort of gave up. Sorry.

I probably won't come back again for a few months.

But what's been going on?
I went to see Billy Talent with Boy. IT. WAS. AWE - wait for it - SOME.

Also got a cat. His name is Elvis and he is adorable and wild. We think he's actually a liger. A mini-liger. He fights with his reflection in the oven door and climbs on my legs.

Got tickets to see Green Day in June - also awesome. Last time was so fabulous, so I really can't wait.

Guess that's it, really. Going to see someone named David today, am totally freaking out about that. He seems nice enough, I just suck at social interactions. I end up just going ""eh... uh... yeah..."" and laughing nervously. I also shake, sweat and scratch my hands compulsively.

Finally, I love Kelly Clarkson."

"event","Merry Christmas and Happy New Year friends!!<br /><br />Also, happy birthday <lj user=""knivey""/>!!<br /><br />My christmas was lovely, spent it as always with the family, eating and opening presents, then came home to Boy and gave him presents. It was nice and calm and just lovely. Christmas is better when you're in love.<br /><br />Last night, New Years Eve, spent in a &quot;radhus&quot; (townhouse?) in Alings&aring;s, Boy's hometown, with his friends. It was quite fun. I&nbsp;sang, didn't expect myself to do that. I ate mushroom soup, thankfully I have a cold so I couldn't taste much of it. I got very drunk, thought not quite as drunk as last year. Actually, nowhere near as drunk as that. I've definately had more fun, but I've also had a lot less fun, so over all the night was a success.<br /><br />I'm pretty much gone from LJ these days. I'll be around now and then, but you're more likely to find me on Facebook or Twitter. So if you're interested, you're more than welcome to <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/soetlakrits"">friend me</a> and/or <a href=""http://twitter.com/soetlakrits"">follow me</a>."

"event","I haven't really been around much, have I?

Sorry about that.

I know I'm kind of late to the whole Christmas card deal, but I figured I might send out New Years cards instead, if anyone wants them. =) I love getting cards, so if anyone wants to send me one, reply (comments are screened, ofc) and I'll reply with my NEW address. I live with a boy now. =)

Life is going along alright at the moment. Still unemployed, it's rough, but I'm alright. It's getting to the point where I've stopped sending out applications because it feels useless. All I get is automated replies saying &quot;We're sorry to inform you that you were not one of the applicants chosen for this position&quot;. If that. But oh well. I spend my days playing Sims 3 and waiting for Boy to get home so I can touch him.

I'm more on Twitter these days, so if anyone wants to follow me there, I'm <a href=""http://twitter.com/soetlakrits"">soetlakrits</a>.

Also, I'm going to see Eddie Izzard on Sunday, so I'm pretty much ecstatic about that 24 hours a day atm."

Since when were they dating HIM/HER? Since when???&quot; And then you wonder how you could have missed all that seemingly pretty standard information, but somehow you feel too ashamed to ask for clarification because it seems like info you should already know?

Please copy the topics below, erase my answers and put yours in their place, and then post it in your journal! Please elaborate on the questions that would benefit from elaboration. One-Word-Answers seldom help anyone out. </em>

<lj-cut text=""Here it is."">

<strong>1. First Name:</strong>
Emma.
<strong>
2. Age:</strong>
21. Getting older.

<strong>3. Location:</strong>
Gothenburg, Sweden. On the west coast, aka the best coast.
<strong>
4. Occupation:</strong>
Unemployed/student. I spend most of my time crying on the couch. The student part consists of a night course in popular music. So I'm a bum, basically.
<strong>
5. Partner:</strong>
YES. Me and the Boy (whose name is Peter, btw) have been together for over a year now, holy crap. I adore him, and I sometimes kind of get the feeling he adores me too. It's a nice feeling.

<strong>6. Kids:</strong>
God no. I killed one baby, I have no problem with doing it again, should it come to that. Honestly, I highly doubt I will ever change my mind on this matter. I would not be a good mother, and bringing a child into my life would be a huge mistake.

<strong>7. Brothers/Sisters:</strong>
Yeah, two of them. Older brother Patrik, works as a nurse, and older sister Sofia who works as a sort of receptionist. I'm not terribly close to them, I mostly see them when I'm babysitting my nieces, or when the family gets together, which very rarely happens. I am seeing Eddie Izzard with my brother in December though, I'm very excited.

<strong>8. Pets:</strong>
I had three cats at my parents, but have still not gotten around to getting my own kitten. I will, though.

<strong>9. List the 3-5 biggest things going on in your life:</strong>
There is nothing going on in my life. Being in love is still mindblowingly big to me, though. Being loved is even bigger.
<strong>
10. Parents:</strong>
Mom and dad. Mom works in a home for the elderly and/or the sick. Dad is some sort of electrician or something at Volvo. He works with boat engines, I think. I've never really known what it is he does. I was never that close to them, but it seems to be getting better since I left home.

<strong>11. Who are some of your closest friends:</strong>
Tess. She's in China - again. I would say Boy is a close friend too, since I would want us to be friends, and I think we would be, if we weren't together. We started out as friends, after all. Well... I think we did. Stephanie is quite a close friend too, though I don't see her much.
</lj-cut>

So I'm crying alot lately and thinking about how I don't really feel like living anymore. Wat? Right now it seems like Boy is the only thing keeping me from killing myself. I guess I'm just sick of being lonely and unemployed and feeling worthless.

I think I'll go hug Boy."

"event","It would seem I am unable to feel happy for others, even (or perhaps especially) when I am happy. It's like I need everyone else except those closest to me to be miserable in order for me to feel genuinely happy. I mean that just can't be healthy. If I see a couple being adorable on the street, maybe holding hands or kissing or just looking at each other as if nothing else exists, I can't go ""aw, that's cute"". No. I can't stand looking at it, and yet I am disgusted by it for some reason. Yet, when I am out with Boy, I need to be close to him all the time. I am clingy, and if it weren't for his issues with public displays of affection, I'd probably be stuck to his face all the time. I need to show everyone around me that I'm no longer alone and pathetic, which I guess just makes me even more pathetic.

And it's not like I can actually tell anyone about this. I am ashamed. I feel horrible for being so clingy and needy and I kind of hate myself for being like this. I want to talk about it. I need to talk about it. I just can't. Because I feel embarrassed. I shouldn't be like this. It's not normal. It's not normal to be jealous of other peoples happiness, when I am actually happy for once. Now more than ever I should be able to feel happy for others.

And really, I should be able to see people kiss on TV and in movies without having to look away or change the channel. That's the most fucked up thing about all of this, I  think. I can't watch romantic comedies anymore. What's that about?"

I sort of disappeared for a while there, didn&rsquo;t I? Sorry. I wanted to start over, new journal, new username, new layoutBut I haven&rsquo;t really gotten there just yet. I deleted ALL my old journals (well, the ones I remember having, anyway) as well as my entries. Fresh start, you know? No real reason for it, I think I was just bored one day. <br /><lj-cut going="""" been="""" text=""&rdquo;What&rsquo;s""><lj-cut text=""What else has been going on?""><br />As for real life, I&rsquo;m trotting along rather nicely. (Trotting?) Every day, my relationship with Boy (I love that I can use the word relationship a positive way now) seems to grow stronger each day. I&rsquo;m not quite so insecure anymore. Not about the relationship or Boy anyway. My insecurities nowadays is directed to myself, and even that seems to have diminished. I&rsquo;ve lost a bit of weight (7-ish kilos, in fact), and I no longer feel quite the same disgust when I look in the mirror. I still don&rsquo;t exactly like it, but it&rsquo;s definitely a step up from where I was before. <br /><br />I&rsquo;ve started seeing a counsellor, mainly to try and deal with my social anxieties and those types of issues. We just recently started talking about my fear of telephones (well, telephone calls, really) and until next Thursday my &ldquo;homework&rdquo; is to call the dentist and make an appointment. This phone issue is the one thing that really has an impact on my life. My other social fears do too, but not quite so much, I don&rsquo;t think. Plus, I think if I can start to overcome one fear, the other ones will sort of follow quite naturally. Or they&rsquo;ll at least be easier to deal with. I hope. <br />I mean, I&rsquo;m 21 now (!), I can&rsquo;t be a grown woman and have a panic-attack every time I have to make a phone call, or beg everyone around me to make the call for me. Some things are okay, I guess, like asking Boy to call LG-support for me when my computer is on the blink, because he will always be better at that than I am. But I need to be able to make dentist appointments for myself, I need to be able to call for an ambulance in case something happens, you know? <br />It&rsquo;s just so embarrassing to talk about it, even to a &ldquo;professional&rdquo;. I feel strange, different, abnormal, childishBut the more I talk about it, the more I start to realise that this is a real problem and that it actually interferes with my life more than I have realised before. <br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />But mostly, it&rsquo;s all good stuff. The strangest thing of all is that the goodness started after a really shitty evening/night/day. To make a long story short, Boy&rsquo;s friend (who I have never really liked) got upset because of something I had blogged about or whatever, and started saying things like &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t people accept that we are friends? what do they have against me? maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be friends anymore, that&rsquo;s what she wants. jealous people are so difficult&rdquo; and generally being a whiny little bitch (as always). I wrote a long email to her, where I apologised if what I had written had upset her (which I was genuinely sorry for) and that was resolved rather quickly. But I was still upset that I felt like I got no support from Boy, and stayed upset through the night and all through the next day. When I met up with Boy for lunch we had a two hour talk/argument about it all, and after a while I started to feel like I actually got through to him, and it was resolved. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been feeling a whole lot happier, safer, calmerJust positive feelings all around. Obviously with some dips, but overall, it&rsquo;s been awesome. <br /></lj-cut><br /><br /><br />Okay. I&rsquo;ll be back. Promise. &lt;3</font><br />"

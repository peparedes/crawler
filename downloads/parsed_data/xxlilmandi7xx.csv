"event","Ey wats good? I'm bored as hell once again ... oh and I'm sick again too!! I dunno I guess I didn't loose my cold from last week cuz I still have one hell of a cough and I had a fever last nite. So I didn't get to go surfing today with Deja and Baez cuz it was totally flat. Like I mean 5mph winds which suck so yea we didn't go, so maybe next week.Ummm I might go to the fair tonite with Paige ... but Paige might be goin to Andrews so I might go to the fair and chill wit my jew (Maegan) or wit Lesly Kim n Mell. 
      So yesterday we played against Piper and we lost 10-6 ... I blame myself. I let 3 runs in because I messed up and went to 2nd base when I was suppose to go to 2nd. But oh well everyone did sumthin wrong.
      So yea I'm bored so Imma go watch 'Without A Paddle'. I'll holla at u all lata.

"event","Hey wazza .. nada much here I'm bored. So yea I didn't go to softball practice today cuz I wasn't feeling good after school and because Heather and Paige weren't going so it wouldn't of been fun. (Ha ha Tiffany got caught and now both Megan and Jen no that Tiff likes Megan.)So this weekend I am most likely going surfing with Deja, Baez and Paige might come. If Paige doesn't go then me and her are chilling at the movies I think. 
     Ummmm nothing much has been going on with me and my love life ... I still like Gabriel but it sux cuz he got suspended cuz he got in a fight for no damn reason. Ummm I am also crushiin on other people, and they no who they are. Theresa is suppose to give me a makeover one of these days, so  I can look prettyful and yea maybe change.
    Well I gotta go do HW so I will get bak to this journal thingy tomorro after our game. I hope we win!!!!

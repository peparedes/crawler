"event","To My One and Only: Audrey <3

I don't know how to put this in the best words so bare with me hon. Last night I was bummed that you weren't allowed to go out but I was thankful that in the least we were able to see each other at the movies. If I could only begin to explain what I felt last night even when we said goodnight and you left us. Nothing could get better when you're holding even the littlest of me, like my hand or my arm..I can't help it. I can't help but look at you like I've been touched by these emotions you've given me to handle over a two week period. You don't realize how much feelings I have for you and neither did I until last night. By the way, the picture of all four of us came out great especially you baby, looking as beautiful as ever. Kissing you, treating you good, touching you from the tips of my fingers, looking into your eyes like I've been stunned, talking on the phone with you until late hours of the night, and so much more is how I express my feelings for you. I can't put into words just how much I have for you, I can only do that by my actions. Audrey, you give me so much strength inside. You're there for me when I need you or when I wanted you to be there. You came to support me at my games, you held me when I had bad news from my mom, gosh when I look at you I see everything that I want in a person. I miss you like crazy right now because we haven't talked since last night and there's a bunch of things I need to tell you. There's no one else I want. I want you to be with me babe. I love everything about you. You make me feel complete, like I belong with you. I'm grateful and very lucky that you gave me a chance to be with you. And for that I cherish every moment we're together because I don't know what the next day holds..I pray that you're in it. I would do anything for you because you fill my heart with such happiness that its making me cry. Damn I could have the world just fall down on me right now but having you by my side makes everything alright. 
I realized this when I went to the party I was talking about with Joey and Ricky. I had invited them but they never called back. The party was held at Vanessa's house with a bunch of her friends and family. I stayed till about 2:30am. Everything was going fine because we were both talking about how happy I was with you and she was talking about how much she missed Laura (ex gf). She was also talking about a GUY whoa haha that she's gonna start dating. Yet, she started crying and told me she gets emotional when she's messed up or whatever. She told me she missed me and that she was stupid for hurting me. I was like its okay don't worry about it. She said she saw me so happy with you and she didn't want to ruin anythig and I was like ""you won't because she trusts me and I trust her with everything I have. Yes, I'm happy and I'm sorry that I can't go back to you Vanessa."" I told her,""I can't do this"". I was honest about my feelings for you and how my feelings for her were completely gone. I told her the differences between both of you. I was like, ""Audrey makes me happy, I can trust her to always be there. I asked her to go to my game the first time and she went to two of them already. Audrey says things to me and shows me instead of just bullshitting me. Audrey really does have everything that I've always wanted in someone"". And with that I left. I didn't feel bad either. I know I was right. That's when all these feelings hit me, as to how much I adore our special connection we have together. I haven't cried out of happiness in a long time that I can't even remember the last time. You have my heart. I know this because I tend to get really emotional and I take everything to heart. Sorry. Furthermore, I didn't go to Montrose because I had told you there was no point in going without you. Plus, that whole thing about Edie. I was going to chill with Elisa over there but it didn't make the situation any better. She even told me off for not going lol.
Audrey, I want you, I need you...You're someone very special to me. I want to give you everything that I have little by little. I mean, what am I waiting for? I'm scared, really scared to get hurt 'cause I've fallen so hard for you but I need to remember that I trust you. Here it is baby, you can have the best of me.
P.S. There's one more thing I want to tell you but I'm gonna wait for the perfect moment. Its good don't worry. hehe *Muah* take care for me. I<3YOU.
Tamara <3s Audrey"

I love him in every way
i dont understand what i mean to him
How could i have made his life happier?
my life is only shit without him
he wants me to find someone else
that i deserve better than someone who is always unsure of anything
why does he push me away?
i'm so confused
he is practically all the happieness in my life.

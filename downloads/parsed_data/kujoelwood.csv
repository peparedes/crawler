"event","When you love someone
He has taken hold of you
He makes the sunrise dull thats coming through
Just remember when your the dying one
You'll belong to him
To make him love you is a war with God
But some things are just not meant to be
Whether it be fate or destiny
Now to see yourself with him is just plain odd
But you'll belong to him

You'll be so alone without him
Maybe he'll be lonesome to

Be with him for who you are
He's a God who'll make you wet with tears
Sing ""Glory Hallelujah"" through the years
For you have been set free my dears
Soon he'll belong to you
See the butterfly who set you free
The sunshine seems so bright today
You see everything that is hit by the ray
You sit under the tree and fell the breeze
He'll belong to you
You realize you have let him go
The funny feeling in your stomach let
You feel the moment that you met
He's the one you've come to know
He'll belong to you

You'll be so alone without him 
Maybe he'll be lonesome to

The look he gets on his face
When gracefulness and beauty he sings
It feels like you have been with wings
To get to him will be a race
So You'll belong to him
But now you don't really care
Cause your so over him
The chance the book of love will open again
In the future you will share

That you wish he'll be so alone without you
Maybe finally you'll be lonesome to 
12-9-04

When you become in love
He'll be so with you forever
You can never hope for the seperation of the dove
Oh, you can only hope for his letter

The promise he'll be with you 
It's a dream only you can dream
You can only hope it's his dream to
The tears, if he doesn't, will be rain

You'll be so lost without him
Being lost to him is unthinkable
To see him differently is only something you can claim
Seeing him get hurt is unbearable

He thinks he knows you personally
But if he knew would he understand
That you want your relationship to have meaning
To hear him proudly exclaim he's yours is grand

It trembles at his voice
Let all the Earth Rejoice

"event","I really dont like this girl named Jessica Bhatia....she has been going through guys ever since i have known her. To me she is really easy....you know what i mean....she is a really stupid whore who really throughs a fit if she doesn't get her way. she needs a guy to be happy and that is sad. ;( she can't sing worth anything...i bet if she tried out for american idol she would be on the worst auditions tape....she claims she is a reborn again christian but if you really were would you really be that serious with a guy as she was with her last boyfriend. i hope God strikes her down and have satan torture her in the deepest circle of hell so it will be legendary...
she is so hideously ugly...i really dont understand why guys would even go for her....she is a stupid whore who gives guys what they want...
Jessie if you ever read this..i hope you already know what i say is true....you stupid bitch"

"event","I have not been feeling all that great in last couple days because the bf is being a dick and ya...I really don't know how I am supposed to deal with that. The friends with the whole ordeal are acting like nothing is wrong and they keep talking to me. They dont seem to take the hint. I try to avoid them as much as possible but still...The bf is ignoring me today. i have never really had a bf and so i really dont know what to do or how to act. if anyone reads this...can you please give me some pointers...i would really appreciate it.
My stepsister is here and i really have not seen her because she always at her family's house. its like we dont even exist for her. but i am ok with that its like she isnt even here. i cant wait till she leaves though.
my dog doesnt really like her because he doesnt know her and ya....he growls every time she tries to get near him
she dyed her hair red and her father didnt say a word. when i put highlights in my hair back in oct. he had a fit. he didnt do anything to her. when i got my cell phone (let me tell you i havent even had it a year and i am a senior in high school) (i had gotten it in july) he had a hissy fit too. she gets one but he doesnt say a word"

"event","I got blamed for flirtin with my friends boyfriend. Our friend Peter told me that she is blaming me for it. He said it was for a heads up. I talk to her the next day about it and she says no. Then a few days later, Peter tells me that he wasnt even supposed to tell me. So therefore she lied to me when i confronted her about it and she is blaming me for something i didnt do because i only see him once a week for about ten minutes and i barely talk to him then....so i really dont see how she could blame me for such a thing. I had this problem with someone else and its difficult because i always get blamed for this kind of stuff...I wouldnt do that to a friend. I am just not going to talk to her anymore if she is going to be like that"

"event","We are irish dancing in my schools dance class. Its really fun and the girl who is teaching it is really cool. I am friends with but a lot of people dont like her for alot of reasons i dont know why. She is really nice if you are on her good side and once you get to know her. But she is teaching irish dancing and its really cool. I have always liked it and always wanted to take it but i never had the chance to. Now that i do i really like it. I think i might take classes and i think i like hard shoe better but it doesnt matter. I am going to have alot of fun i know. Everyone thinks its so hard but it really isnt because they just have to concentrate. well i think that is all for today"

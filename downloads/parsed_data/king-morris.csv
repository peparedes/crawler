"event","Yester evening, my primary man servant drove me on a diplomatic mission to the human ""coffee"" establishment located on Williamson Street in the grand region of Madisonia. There he attempted to show me their local custom of eating children, by repeatedly directing me to ""Eat the children! Eat the children!"", no doubt referring to the half dozen of small human children scampering to and fro. I do not know why he was so enthusiastic about developing within me a taste for the flesh of the young, for his Creme Cheese Danish satisfied my royal stomach well enough. I ignored his confusing requests with slight irritation."

"event","Primary man servant, I bid you to relinquish your current tasks and come forthwith to remove these ticks, whose cavities have grown swollen with Royal blood. My duties as Ambassador to the Veronian State have been disgraced with these wretched creatures. I also fancy a small bowl of sustenance tablets. Forthwith, servant!"

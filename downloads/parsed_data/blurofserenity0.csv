"event","so yeah...
never really made a super real entry on this thing. don't really know why. but whatever, right? i guess things have been going pretty well, all in all, but not without some kind of sacrifice. but, whatever has been sacrificed, i have few regrets involved, probably cause i have the sweetest man on the face of the planet. 
i think what troubles me is that i feel like a loner in all other aspects. i've never fit in with any group of any sort pretty much. always kindof the outsider; very few people are really close with me, which isn't necessarily bad, but i don't have a lot of friends. not quite like high school any more, but that's what life does: it moves on. 
i'm not all depressed about anything...just mindlessly babbling. guess i'll move on now...
i am sad though because my roses are wilting. they did last about 2 weeks though. guess it was just their time..."

i'm so afraid of messing up.

sometimes i think i'll end up messing up by worrying about messing up so much. like by acknowledging the possibility, i'm inviting it or setting it to motion."

"event","school...blah...yesterday, for the first time in a long time i felt that twinge of failure at most everything i was doing. in photography, my pictures aren't really coming out all that super great, but then again, i like to make mine more abstracty and contrasty that the teacher would like us to at this juncture. at least i didn't fall down...then in poetry, the teacher had saved my poem for last of my group and i felt like it was to say how much it wasn't that great of a poem...which i knew that...but she dwelled on it for awhile. i think she felt like i was using it wrong or something. she asked me if i had a comment, and i just said i didn't like it. and she left it at that. oh well. guess i don't get poetry :( at least when the teacher in spanish called on me, i actually knew the answer for once. yay. sadly, it was a wild guess and i just happened to get it right. 
what can i say; i suck.
maybe i'm doing something right somewhere...sure hope so. 
::crossing fingers:: maybe tomorrow will be better...only spanish and then the weekend...oh wait, then i get to work. grr. 
gripe gripe gripe. 
i had a thought today: i hope that when i get older, i don't lose my forms of self-expression. i mean, i feel like its already happening, cause i don't draw like i used to (and so my abilities are declining) but i still try to take pictures and write, but i feel like that's not really going so hot right now. but i watch my parents, and i think that is a contributor to their stress and frustration. my mom does needlework now and dad builds model airplanes and plays with guns...but still...
i think that has something to do with my best friend's problems as well. she quit trying at all the things she used to do because she felt like she failed at them before she really got started. :( even with encouragement, she would quit. so i will try not to be like that.

ON THE UP SIDE...
its been nice talking to you lately, scott, and dragging you out with my gay friends to get ice cream lol. thanks for always listening to me gripe. i guess that's why i asked you about the favorite part of your day the other day...sometimes it seems like the good gets buried under the bad. so i try to dig it out periodically lol."

Parade of Emotions

hello
the simple hello
leads to pleasant smiles and
rosy flirtations
(including those warm embraces).
unexpectedly,
something goes awry. 
what once came naturally
becomes forced 
and mechanical.
behind plastic smiles
lie different emotions.
the relationship an illusion,
one person always left, 
hoping...
        wishing...
                 waiting...
yearning for something more.
the other remains content
with the way things are.
unfulfillment brings disappointment.
and so the story ends, 
sad, bitter
alone.
grief-stricken, we say
good-bye."

"event","i like white russians (the drink, silly); only the pre-fabricated bottled ones by kahlua though...i had one in a bar once and it wasn't near as good. mmm 

so i made this entry the other day and managed to erase it somehow...not really sure how, but i lost it and it sucked. 

got to see 28 days later tonight. pretty cool movie. pretty graphic at times though. awkward hanging out with some people from earlier high-school years as well. especially since several of them tend to act like they're still in early high school. oh well. i think what got me most is that my best friend of many years tends to act as though she values them more than me and other friends even though we've been there for her through her especially difficult year while these people have not. oh well.

blah blah blah"

"event","warped tour today. pretty fun. except for the whole standing in the sun for hours on end, dehydrating myself for the sake of seeing a couple of bands that by the time i am there and trying to enjoy them, i'm wishing it was over already. during the used i was feeling that way. but, by the time glassjaw came on, i had eaten and drank more water, so i felt better and was able to fully enjoy that set. all in all, a pretty good day. stupid jared refused to put on sunblock and is currently suffering those consequences, though he wasn't as burnt as he could be. adam got sunburned on his face and neck a little, and i only got a little pink on my shoulders, and i didn't even realize it until i came home and threw myself immediatly into the bath tub to get cleaned up from feeling so disgusting. andrew wk is really funny. we watched him. jumping aroundish. not really a fan of the music so much, but he puts on a good show. invited people from the audience up onto the stage to dance around with him. adam got the lead singer of glassjaw's autograph because i spotted him standing near us. adam didn't know what to say to him though so he didn't really talk to him. pretty cool there though. blah blah blah"

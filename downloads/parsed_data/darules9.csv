"event","just watched american history x beggining to end for the first time. it was really good. really powerful. my dad thought it was weird. but thats because he came in the middle of it, and didnt get its full meaning. its scary sometimes. thinking that there are really people like that out there. seeing things like that make me question my own purpose. like, whats going on in this world? how did things get this way? why is there so much hate in the world? why cant it just be a better place? i mean, the world is not suppose to be perfect by any streatch of the imagination because nothing can be perfect, but i dont think it should be like this. yeah, i live in a small town, and all i know is what i see on the news, or am taught by teachers or what have you. ive never seen the world. but honestly, im scared shitless if i actually go out there one day. thinking about what i do know scares the shit out of me. the fact that theres a genocide in darfu thats been going on for almost 20 years. that from past wars, countries are still digging up mines, mines that are hidden, that a little kid could be playing in his yard, and step on one amd die for no reason at all. that it'll take years and years and years to clean up. i honeslty dont know nearly everything thats happened / happening, but its just so messed up, i cant bring myself to even want to learn about it. but then again, part of me wants to try to help. no lie, ive thought about maybe after college, like, joining the peace core or soemthing like that, and actually trying to help people. like, yeah, after college people usually get a job, try to make money for themselfs, get married, have kids, raise a family and just live their own lives. well, thats all well and good, but theres so much more that needs fixing out there. i want to try to make this world a better place. i knwo whatever i do wont change the world. but if i can change one persons life for the better, then ive done a little. and that little will make the world a better place. well, bed time i guess..."

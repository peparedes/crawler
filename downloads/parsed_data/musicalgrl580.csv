Ok so you hear a cast list of Alexa Vega, Paris Hilton and Sarah Brightman and you cringe, right? But for some reason, they are all really great in this film! That music is addictive as hell and I can't stop listening to it. It's a rock opera, and all the songs, well most are shot in music video style, jumping from place to place and scene to scene. I'm thinking I'll order it online soon because I haven't loved a movie like this in a long time. And just by chance, everyone in the theater department is discovering it about the same time. I saw it for the first time the second week of class, and my friend Kerry saw it with all his GSSU friends a week later just because someone they knew had it. I was talking about it at an APO (Co-ed Theater Frat) rush event and people kept interjecting their thoughts on it and none of these people had seen it with us. The movie is a year old, but it's starting to experience super popularity right now among CNU theater students if no one else.

There's this character in it, Graverobber (yup), who you would never in a million years think of me being attracted to. He has long hair, wears gothic make-up, the character is a sort of medical drug dealer, and some reason I'm hot for the Graverobber. He doesn't have the best voice, and he's pretty good looking, but usually long hair cancels that out for me. But he just sort of exudes hot sexual bad boy and it's hot. Only bad bit is his character basically has sex with Paris Hilton on screen a few times since he's her dealer. But he also rescues Shilo a lot, although there's one part in the deleted scenes where it seems like he's trying to seduce her, though it's a bit difficult since he's trapped, hung up-side down in a tomb where Shilo finds him to ask for some Zydrate. I love the song Zydrate Anatomy, it just goes through my head on repeat. 

Anyway, you can watch it on SurftheChannel, or you can buy or rent it, it's kind of amazing! So I suggest it. Though is gets really gory at bits, it's called Repo because the repo man comes to repossess organs that people don't pay for. 

Interesting thing about the Graverobber though- the actor who plays him wrote Repo, and did all the illustrations for the comic book storytelling where all the backstory gets filled in. 

SO good."

"event","I really do, I specifically listen to indie music as I walk around campus, because I feel like that's just quintessential college student. I wear lipstick EVERY DAY, and straighten my hair every day, and I wear heels almost every day. The only shoes I brought were heels and sneakers for those days that require more movement. I still read the Belle De Jour novels, imported the third one and it arrived the other day. I even have a Jane Austen plushy sitting on my desk. I have an Audrey Hepburn poster and a David Tennant Poster I picked up in Edinburgh that are on my walls. 

But in other news, my room got detripled, so I'm in a different bed now, and the room seems massive, we have like 10 square feet of empty space in the middle. It's kinda lonely, though I don't mind my new bed. though it doesn't give me a creepily great view of the entire room. Creepy because I can see my roommate very well from my bed and I feel like a creeper if I look down now. But I have a lot more space, although my mug-bowl from Paris got smashed in the process :C it's glued back together except for about 10 percent that got hurt the worst and that 10% just happens to be a hole at the bottom :(. Very Sad. But I talked to my parents and they said they may be going back to Paris next October with my sister so they would buy me another. That made me happier by far. 

I spend every night lately talking to Jeremy for at least an hour. IMing people from fairfax and I've connected again to Jacob, we IM about his ever changing love life, since he and Piper broke up he's tried to get back on the dating scene, and it seems Piper might be happier with out him (but I've known that for awhile). I totally creeped on robinsondrama and found the cast list for Rumors. I started IMing and congratulating people AND I found out that Rachel (my fave and my 'daughter' in Fiddler) got an amazing part AND Madison is her understudy! That made me so happy. All summer I was telling Rachel she was better than Madison and deserved to get better roles because Madison's head has become the size of Saturn since she kept getting leads and Replogle made it clear she was his favorite. And then THIS happened. I sent Rachel a text saying 'I told you you were better than Madison' Evil, maybe, but it felt like justice. Julieanna also got a good role, and so did Alex (who I'm starting to love just a bit since he's started changing for the better). I'm so proud of all my Robinson friends, I'm excited to see the show. 

College seems very chill compared to Robinson, my courses aren't more difficult, they're a faster pace but I got AMAZING teachers (except my history teacher, I think I know more than him about half of what he's teaching). I LOVE Frau Carter and all the other teachers. Her especially, she makes our german class all about hitting on someone in a bar in Germany and how you start the conversation. College german is all conversational, less learning to say things like cat and tree. 

I've really started to listen to listen to Lilly Allen non-stop, she's fabulous. I love love love her music. It's clever, cute and sometimes just awesome girl bitchyness at exboyfriends. I <3 her big time. And she's gorgeous. J-Bethea would like her I think, simply because she looks like Katy Perry/Zoey Deschennel- his two loves. 

Anyway... one more hour til German...what to do what to do..."

"event","I decided to do my laundry tonight because I got invited to a theatre party where the theme is SNL, so I'm gonna be Tina Fey as Sarah Palin, not too hard. Except it's gonna be a really low budget Sarah Palin, it's super hot out so I'm not gonna do the full suit, just a high wasted pencil skirt with a white shirt. My audition outfit :/ oh well. 
My CA is driving, CA stands for 'collaborative artist' and it's upper classmen who take little freshman under their wing and teach us all about the theatre dept at CNU, she's giving me a ride, kind of. Her room mate's boyfriend is giving me a ride and she's in the car. Apparently he's buying a keg, so I'm just gonna have to watch out. I don't think I'll drink, I don't want to do anything I might regret. I'm really glad that I got invited to a legit party in the drama dept, they're all really nice and want to get all the freshman involved. 

ok so, everyday, every night, Derek- the guy who goes here who I went on a date with back in Dec of senior year, gets more and more awkward daily, more and more 'I'm gonna hit on you and insult your boyfriend whom I've never met'. It's bugging the hell out of me. I miss Jeremy like crazy, and I hope he can get down here soon. 

one of my goals worked! kind of. I had a goal for people to only see me with lipstick on, and today I was too lazy to put it on before heading to breakfast with the 3rd floor, and one of the guys came into Regattas and when I said hi he said 'Woah, I almost didn't recognize you without your make-up and lipstick on. I hope guy from my german class, Dan, didn't recognize me, he was outside Regattas when I went in. 

Ugh, the homework is starting to kick me in the face. Mostly because I'm a freak and I like to take detailed notes and that takes awhile. Tomorrow will be brunch/homework/pearls auditions/mass/homeowork/dinner/homework

I kinda hate being so busy-not a lot of time for fun reading. My sister got so much reading done in college- I must be too social."

"event","I'm have a great time, I love the people, the food, the campus. I'm just always busy.
Last night I got invited to go to a movie night at Santoro- the party dorm, and everyone was telling me not to go because if a guy invited you to Santoro it means he wants to fuck you. He seemed really nice so I went anyway, and nothing at all happened, partially because I'm good at keeping a foot away from guys.
Now you're wondering- why would that be a problem? He should know you have a boyfriend.
Well the guy sits next to me in German, we've only gone so far as 'what's you name, what's your phone number, where are you from' in my German class, and those topics are all we had talked about. I personally, feel kind weird saying 'oh my boyfriend' all the time, I feel like thats a bit weird, so I only talk about Jeremy if it comes up in conversation- I don't like to make a big deal over the fact that I'm in a relationship, everyone in my hall knows because I have picture of him all over my desk and dresser, but if it doesn't come up, I don't mention it. So since Santoro guy never asked, I never said anything, but after the movie, the way he talked to me, he was so sweet and nice and the way he said things- I'm pretty sure he likes me, so now I've got to find some way of slipping Jeremy into conversation so I don't lead him on. I even insulted things I liked that he liked because those things could have led the conversation in a romantic direction and I couldn't have that. I just wanted to get to my dorm as quickly as possible so I could say good night and go. 
I told Jeremy about it and he said he wanted to visit, meet any guy who's ever expressed any interest in me and make out in front of them. I told him that was stupid and mean. He agreed. 

I didn't get called back or cast in the fall shows- not surprising- I'm a freshman girl, and only 2 got called back out of 20, so if only 10% got called back, I don't feel bad at all. 
ANYWAY, there's an Alpha Psi Omega picnic this afternoon/night so I'm gonna go to that- it's a co-ed theater fraternity that I hope to be a big part of, it's just like ITS point system, so I'm gonna do EVERYTHING I can for them and hopefully pledge next year. 

Classes are not too tough, but I was talked to a sophmore yesterday who said you think you're doing well- and then your grade is a C. So I'm gonna try and be the Hermione of CNU, and work super over hard. Suck up and write way above and beyond what my theatre teachers ask of me, except the voice teacher, she's super chill so I'm not gonna worry about that one."

Confessions

- He probably knows, but I had a massive crush on my stage combat teacher, Craig, when I was 15/16. somewhere during the beginning of 11th grade it calmed down to harmless admiration. Now I just think he's super cool and wish we knew each other better

- I'm horribly jealous of Hannah and have been since 7th grade, with her skills and talents and general awesomeness. She's really cool if you don't know her. 

-I seem to be chronically jealous of all my friends-Because they are all very cool people and very individual- I feel like a pop culture cut out- not unique at all

-There are two versions of me I present depending on where I am, with my friends I'm myself. With people I've just met, I try to put on the persona of the person I want to be. Basically Emma Peirson in Hotel Babylon. 

-I read literature mostly because I want to be well informed, not because I actually like it. 

-I read cheesy trashy racy romance novels

- One of the reason's I'm waiting til marriage is because sex scares the shit out of me, I can't even handle baby needles in the arm for heaven's sake

- Shakespeare is the only playwright that I can read like novels, his plays paint a picture (mostly because they didn't have sets)

- At times I wish I were more slutty, I feel awkward if my shoulders are showing- though I pretend I'm cool with it. 

- My body and I have a love hate relationship with my body

- (To a special someone) I thought you were pregnant when we saw each other at that party, but dismissed it because it seemed too impossible, so I wasn't exactly shocked when Jeremy told me. Congrats though- I think you will be an amazing mother. 

- I feed off attention, I love it, it's pathetic how much really, I know it's bad but I can't help want it.

"event","I got into an accident on the way home from Jeremy's house. No one got hurt, his car doesn't look like anything happened at all, my car on the other hand... wheels are out of alignment, light is smashed in. He said I was at fault, but I'm not exactly sure, he was stopped in the middle of the road right after a traffic light, it was a really bad place to be stopped, and he was talking to someone through his window, I call that slightly irresponsible. It's not horrible, it's just really super inconvenient, insurance is taking care of it, and even though it makes my rates go up, I'll be able to drive for another two weeks after Europe anyhow. So it's not a huge loss, because I'll be off the plan soon anyway (I'm not allowed to drive in college, my parents don't think college kids should have cars- dangerous). It's super inconvenient though, because I have so many places to go this week! So much to do.
My parents and I called insurance and it's all covered, but I still feel crappy, and I keep randomly crying- but that's to be expected after this sort of thing. My parents are basically taking the 'life moves on' frame of mind to this, but I wish it were winter so I curl up in a blanket with some hot coffee- coffee makes everything better. 
This could work to my advantage, in the book I wrote, I took an unexpected turn which took away some of the climax, but I could put the character in a mini car wreck... hrm, I'll have to contemplated this one. 

You know, today I thought I was just gonna put up a mini entry saying 'yay, I got a new phone, it's pretty and maroon and I have unlimited txting now... alas. 

I hate life sometimes.... I was so happy. It was bound to happen I suppose. God does this to us when everything is going about 95% right. He just throws us a curve ball to keep us in check and on our guard and remind us that life is fleeting. Huh, now I'm thinking some moderately deep and questioning thoughts. Slightly unsettling"

I didn't realize how short I was asking for until I got cut and I was like ""Oh, wow... thank god this stuff grows back""
It's still shoulder length... it's just... It's usually halfway down my back!
alright so I'm getting ready for college! It's exciting! I've got my pink bed set, my pink iHome, pink laptop, pink coffee mugs (sadly my coffee maker is black), I'm hoping to get a pink trash can and hamper... my poor roommate. I just noticed all my perfume bottles are pink. And my sticky and a fair number of my books, and my lava lamp (ok now it must also come with me to college). 
Sad thing- I realized I can't audition for something for at least 2-3 months because now my headshots don't look like me and it will take that long for my hair to start to look it does in those shots, alas, I just wanted to cut off damage, and I told her to cut off more than I was prepared to part with. Oy.
Funny, I'm bringing a million pink things to college, I own like 3 pink shirts.... woah. sad
Can't wait til England! I want to get hit on by a British guy SO badly! preferably a scot. watch me get hit on by a chav, that would suck! those are the lowest of the low in britain, the word fourteen has a T in it, I promise! It is not pronounced Four-een. THATS NOT A WORD!!!
I've become a Hotel Babylon addict recently, I basically watch anything and everything I can find online. It's sad really. I even ordered the book that the show is based around, that'll be fun to read actually.
Also ordered Secret Diary of a Call Girl, I want to read both whilst in England, I think it'd be funny and if there are any tv fans out there, they should recognize the books and hopefully will start conversations with me.

Like I've fallen in love with and love him, and YES it seems sudden, considering we've only been dating a month, BUT I think I've been in enough relationship to know that I really do love him, if I don't see him for a day, that days sucks, not one day goes by where we don't talk. My feelings for him are so different from every other boy I've been with, I never want our relationship to end, with a lot of boys I put a ticking clock on it, when I think it'll probably end, I haven't with him. 
And I've kind of been absorbed into his family, he and his sister are going to church and youth group with me tomorrow and his sister is going to see my prom dress so she'll can help him find a tux to go with it. Caitlin (his little sister) is becoming like my little sister, I give her boy advice and teach her simple life lessons that only girls know. She has two older brothers so there are a few things she's never learned. It's kinda funny, but I go to Jeremy's house to hang out with him, and what ends up happening is I'll go over, sit on Jeremy's lap or have Jeremy's arms around me and just talk to Caitlin while he and his brother argue. Apparently Brandon's really upset because I've stolen his brother from him. Yet he continues to take pictures of us together, he apparently wants Jeremy to turn me into a gamer, but we all know it's not going to happen. 
His parents also love me, at least they pretend to, and they dont mind that Jeremy and I spend a lot of time in his room with the door closed... But Jeremy has to keep his door closed or his cats will get in and destroy things, and we go into his room because it's convenient and comfortable... 
I love him, it's weird, but we remind me of my parents. How we're so young, but yet I don't feel young with him, I feel right. like it's right. and we're right together.

"event","For probably two years now, I've been under the impression that I am probably a shallow person. I would tell myself that I would only date attractive guys and guys that would pay and be able to drive. And I think I mostly continued to think this because people kept saying that I was shallow and telling me how shallow. Not like it was bad, just like stating a fact. 
But I DON'T generally date attractive guys, I've noticed. Brantley- eh, he was OK but weighed less than me. And my current boyfriend is adorable, but he's not really attractive. But something about him being himself makes me so happy and so happy to be with him. 
By the way, if you've EVER seen a show at fairfax high school, chances are, he was in it! He was Lumier in last year's Beauty and the Beast- Craig should know who this is! Jeremy Tuohy, possibly the funniest, sweetest boy I have ever met.
So I was like his second kiss ever apparently, and first girl he has ever made out with. It's super adorable and I totally don't mind how innocent he is, it's only frustrating when I'm in a super flirty mood and he gets freaked out and confuse. But he and his family are the most adorable thing in the world. His sister and I want to have a Gilmore Girl's marathon, and I believe Jeremy and I need to have a Simon Pegg marathon. I love that man. 

It's a bit freaky, but I think I may be falling in love with Jeremy. We went to a Ceili which is an Irish social dance thing tonight. And he danced with me, like the waltzes and reels... I suddenly understand romance novels so much more, dancing with a guy like that really is an experience. Jeremy leads REALLY well, somehow we just after awhile *CORNY ALERT* seemed to almost float together on the floor. IT WAS GREAT! 

I wonder if a first week of a relationship can be telling. Because after a week or two with Brantley, I felt like it wasn't gonna work and needed to end sometime soon, I found myself wanting friend time more than Brantley time. and Here I find myself wanting to be with Jeremy. Jeremy and his family and his friends and Jeremy and my friends and family... 
He makes me so happy, just our conversations, he is the nerdiest, most fun guy I think I've ever been with. 
He's a super nerd (loves D&D and WoW), not amazingly attractive, and super innocent. He's the opposite of what I thought I wanted. Yet I want to be with him more than I can even say. Life is funny, ain't it?"

It's a massive princess dress, eight layers of tule on the skirt!!! It's pink and white and AMAZING!!!! 
Also bought a lot of tops and jeans and some nice pairs of shoes and a jacket so that I look AMAZING when I go to Ireland, England, Scotland and France. Oh and I bought a princess pen for college. I've decided I'm going to decorate my dorm Princess like. It's gonna be awesome and happy!"

Oh, year the show is great. Wonderful really, but I'm gonna need A LOT of rest. Except my boss scheduled me for everyday this break but monday. I told him I had religious conflicts at night (because we have mass thursday, friday and saturday during Holy Week) so he just gave me the early shift everyday. yar... at least I'll get money, and it's spring break so hopefully people will actually come in, even though it's supposed to be dreary and rainy...

OH! So exciting news about Fiddler on the Roof: We have a real live chicken on stage! 

Oh and I figured out who my future husband is... Hadley Fraser... I LOVE HIM!!! He's all british and amazing and british! And Iove him.

But not for this one :D 
<lj-embed id=""10""/>

Yeah, I even had a dream about him
I was at a show he was in, and before the show started (it was like an understudy show or something) he and Marcus Chait (another guy in Pirate Queen) and some producer guy called me up on stage and then took me to dinner and Hadley at first was a bit mean and rude but as the night went on he was nicer and at the end of the night he said ""I love this girl"" in a friendly way to Marcus Chait, so obvioulsy we're going to meet and maybe not hit it off immediately but he'll soon realize he loves me and that we're perfect for each other and marry me.

:D"

"event","So I've been to two maryland schools in the past two days to review their cappies shows, and both shows were phenomenal, AND the schools were nicer than ours here in VA. I mean maybe they're academics suck, but the schools had color and fun set ups... I was really jealous. Their houses sucks for visuals, but the sound was great and the shows in general were really great. My cappies reviews were raves, I almost felt bad because I'm not sure people will like how super into it all mine sound. But they were genuinely good shows (although the fight choreagraphy was horrible for all and looked super fake!) But! the singing was wonderful for each and so was the acting! It was nice to be honestly excited about a show in a review for once. 
I think I fell in love with both Gaston and Lumier in Wootton's Beauty and the Beast! They were good-looking, adorable and REALLY entertaining! Like every time they came on stage I was smiling or laughing and generally enjoying their existence... the beast was ok but he didn't really make me empathetic of his plight, so I wasn't so into him.  
It was good... all I have to say
I have to go work now..."

Ok, funny story...
So in seventh grade there was this boy with a locker almost right next to mine, and I just remember looking over between classes thinking, he's really cute. And I quickly became kind of infatuated with this boy I didn't even know, but I recognized him vaguely from elementary school. Turned out my best friend, Rebecca, knew him and talked to him online every once and a while. Well I told her I liked him (I found out his name on a the 7th grade field trip where we all had to wear name tags) so she invited him and I to an AIM chat together and then left so we ended up talking summer before 8th grade, then met face to face on the first day of 8th grade. Kinda funny, but we became really good friends. Somehow, even though everyone thought we'd get together, he ended up dating one of my best friends, and I ended up dating one of his. 
9th grade we were really great friends but I started liking him again and I told him right before winter break. But apparently two other girls had also done the same thing and he ended up asking out Michaela... That was a bit depressing. But we still were pretty good friends through out ninth grade
10th grade, for the first half of the year we were good, but we grew pretty distant, didn't see each other very often at all, stopped talking on AIM... Half way through the year we just stopped talking, no reason, just no reason to talk
11th grade, he would stop me in the hall here and there and try to start conversations, but I was just kinda like 'why do you even bother talking to me, we have nothing in common anymore'. So I would be polite but I wouldn't be really enthusiastic.
But like a week before school started this year we started talking on AIM, comparing schedules and what not. We didn't have any classes together but we somehow kept talking everyday. First day of school we said hi, and then he drove me home on wednesday and thursday. And quite a few other times... And we met up every football game and hung out...Talked at homecoming.
But then one day, I had theatre sports and I was talking to him before I went to help 'set up' and he was like 'maybe I'll come' and he did and we hung out and were flirting and... hung out.....
And after the football game yesterday we uh...hung out... but funny thing
When he kissed me (I never thought this happened, it was scary almost) I could barely walk, my knees were shaking and I could barely stand. Apparently weak knees does actually occur... it was...scarily surprising...
Just thought that was a fun little story over the course of 5 years..."

2. Open the book to page 42 (or the closest one...in this case, anyway).
3. Find the first full sentence.
4. Post the text of the next seven sentences in your journal along with these instructions.
5. Don't dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.

Shakespeare himself has in all likelihood not served in the wars and has never seen a soldier's thighs pierced with arrows. He has probably only read about porcupines (though he may have glimpsed the one kept in a small menagerie near the Tower or London). But as a boy, he has almost certainly seen his fair share of morris dancers-wild Moriscos""-leaping about in a kind of ecstasy. From such sights he constructed his astonishing image of the unstoppable Cade. More important, from the accumulation of such sights and sounds and rituals he constructed his sense of the magic of the theatre.
But it was not only these traditional folk rituals, with their illusory but compelling air of timelessness, that exercised a powerful imaginative influence upon him; a particular event in his neighborhood, widely noted at the time, seems to have strongly marked his vision of the theatre. In the summer of 1575, when Will was eleven, the queen had gone to the Midlands on one of her royal progresses-journeys, accompanied by an enormous retinue, on which, bejeweled like a Byzantine icon, she displayed herself to her people, surveyed her realm, received tributes; and all but bankrupted her hosts. 

Yeah, that's seven sentences....

Oddly enough I got this from Hannah, who also had something on Shakespeare. For me, Will in the World just happened to be close at hand..."

"event","AWESOME! Well, not the dance, the dance is always lame, but Taste of Robinson, the Game, Dinner and the After-Party were all AWESOME! 
Let's go through it one by one shall we?
Taste of Robinson: I showed up to help, and there were way too many people so I just kinda stood in the back at first, wandering here and there, partaking in free spirit bread. But eventually I started to help with spray painting children's hair and painting faces. And that was all good...Josh had to go for a hair-spray run that took like 2 hours.  Jesse filmed random stuff and put it on facebook and youtube... I like how Sam called Sarah a Jew is in every video. Lots of just random funny bits.
The Game: We won, 61-8... and I paid attention for a good deal and actually understood what was going on.  Jesse disappeared half-way through with to hang out with Emily Sirney and her friends, and a lot of people left before half-time. Madison and Alex were being all couple-y, as were Josh and Stacey... So I was feeling a bit awkward, but my non-drama friend, Aleks (yes, that's how he spells it) came to hang out with me, so that was cool. Oh, and I got Jesse's hat from Emily... He eventually got it back...
Pictures/Dinner: I got to Sarah's house 10 minutes late, I had to run all over my house to get stuff for sleeping over. But when I got there, a few people were still late so I didn't feel too bad. Jesse got me a rose! And gave up his seat for me, gentleman that he is. Mrs. Russell was awesome and help me safety pin my dress b/c the zipper kept going down. We then did the obligatory pictures outside. Which I TRIED to post to facebook but it wont let me... Everyone looked awesome, except Micah's date who didn't dress up AT ALL, it was sad. Oh and Rory didn't show up to pictures so Sarah took pictures with ALL the guys and Johnny Depp.
I drove Jesse and Sarah to dinner at Otani's, because I'm the only person who can drive more than one. Our reservations were for 6:30...we didn't get seated til 7, but the food was amazing. And waiting wasn't too bad, saw a lot of people we knew. And Jesse isn't a bad conversationalist at all! We actually were able to keep conversation going quite easily. He told me at one point that this homecoming dinner was much less awkward than last year. So that's good I guess. We ordered the same thing, and I ate super fast and ended up eating two of Jesse's shrimp and some of his vegetables. Skinny boy! But he did take a drink every time I said 'America' so good for him! And he covered the bill *yay* and they gave us ice cream! Apparently Hibachi places just do that, they give you soup, rice and ice cream, when all you actually ordered was shrimp. 
Dance: lame... the music kinda suck, only good part was ""every time we touch"" it always is. Jesse didn't really dance, and I locked my keys in my car so my mom had to come and give me a key. She was not happy... *This morning she apologized, claiming early menopause made her a bitch* 
After-party: bonfire with marshmallows!!!! and when the fire started dying down the guys decided to jump over it. Logan ever cartwheeled over it. And alex jumped and summersaulted over it...into Sam's crotch. Poor Sam may never children... We watched a really bad horror flick I don't even want to think about, and then clue.... 
I had some weird random dreams, involving cigarrettes, Ben Johnson being scared, me calming him down...
Oh and when Jesse isn't asleep he just lies like a corpse... he was sleeping pretty close to me so when he moved I would wake up- and he went to the bathroom a LOT!

In the morning, Sarah's parents made us breakfast, and lots of coffee thank the lord, other wise I would have never been able to get home.
I gave Jesse a ride home, since he lives like two minutes from my house. It was kinda funny, cuz I took a different route home than I guess he's used to, so he kept thinking he knew which way to go  and be like 'turn left up here' and I'd be like, 'nope, right, Jesse' and then he'd be like 'oh...wait, we're not where I thought we were'. How's the boy ever gonna get around once he gets his license?

Yeah, so that was homecoming..."

"event","The bad thing finally happened. For days now, everything has been going so well, I just knew something bad would have to happen to either balance it out or ruin it all, because that's what life does to you. It screws you around and screws you over. 
It wasn't even like a bad 'thing' it was just one of those rehearsals that make you wonder why you like theatre. It was boring, and pretty lonely. I'm starting to realize how unfair high school is, and how crappy life can be. 
Yeah, I'm being emo, but I feel I deserve it, at least for tonight, I'm sick and I'm sad. I'm drinking my stress coffee- whenever I'm stressed, I go for coffee, even when I'm sick and it's bad for me. I also have an apple juice to balance it out cuz I'm a goody-two shoes like that. I'm also starting to a get a stress headache and I feel like a stress cry is on it's way very quickly. 
I don't think I can explain this on here, I'm gonna have to actually journal about it. It's really hard to explain if you don't know every little detail of my existence... All I can say is that from about 6 pm on, nothing went right, and I feel like one of my friends that I was finally growing close to and bonding with, I lost. No particular reason, just said friend gravitated towards the new people in our cast as did others, so here's Ella feeling alone because she has to wait for her entrance, which she knows will never come at the pace rome works, all alone. 
That combined with some general stress and upsetness (I just made that a word), it has not been a good night. 
And now my ears are congested, my nose is still stuffy, my cough is just worse, and I could use a sick day like no other. 
I'm sorry for the downer entry... just... things like this need to be talked about and let out so that they dont eat you up and kill and cause a total break down. Hopefully everything will be better tomorrow."

My mom made me some AMAZING soup that I ate 3 bowls of last night, and then all that was let over today- I asked that she make more... But now I'm just drinking green tea, hoping it helps. I ate two tangerines today, vitamin C and all that good stuff. I was so tired during the entire school day, and tried to take a nap when I got home... 
I really have nothing to write about, it wasn't an especially eventful day.
 I talked to Mr. Adylette who I think wants me to go to CNU, but he knows nothing about Pace so he can't really recommend or dissuade me from it. It's still my number one, with CNU and Catholic at close seconds... Bit weird- he told me about a girl at Catholic who ended up dating one of her teachers (Grad Student) still seemed a bit sketch to me. 
And I'm bored... I could do my PreCalc homework... but I really don't want to yet. 

Oh Rome let me cast Charlie and the Chocolate factory by myself (well, josh and I conspired, but I had the final say). That was awesome! And I like directing these small children, they listen to me and I have the power to knock a few of the divas down to size. They need it. 
It'll be fun I think. With Josh as Producer, Alex as assistant producer and Juicy, Madison, Erica as crew chiefs... 

Yeah... nothing terribly interesting to say...
My friend who isn't Catholic (but dating a guy in my youth group) is considering coming to our youth group every week and maybe a few masses. AND tonight she's coming to my CLC ice cream social, so I'm SUPER excited! (It's Jessie Maines if you know her, Hannah/Patricia) 

Oh and it was confirmed, Jesse asked me to Homecoming, and he bought my ticket today so that was good. He told me not to lose it (and we all know I have hard time not losing things...) so it's safely on my piano, waiting for Saturday. Apparently we're also going with Josh/Stacey/Britenae/Sam/Micah/some woodson guy/Sarah/Rory/Alex/Madison to Otani's and then Sarah's house for an after party. And supposedly Madison and some one else's moms are driving us every where (since half our group can't drive) 

And gosh darn, I was a cute toddler... I was looking for senior happy day pics, and for a while I almost gave up hope because I was an ugly baby, but I was a very cute toddler. So my first xmas is one of the choices, I was almost 1 by that time, and my first birthday with me sucking on my fist... As well as Halloween as a clown, my fourth birthday (where I looked very pretty in my party dress, if I may say so) And my kindergarden graduation in my catholic school uniform- it's adorable... 
so yeah"

And I don't really have a lot of homework yet so that's pretty awesome! And I got a free shirt at school for my awesome spirit day outfit! (I wore my mom's austrian dirndl (native german style dress). Only downside: Sam, Bnae and Josh all called me a wench. Gosh darn!

Oh and I think I got asked to homecoming by Jesse... But I'm not sure, it was probably the weirdest way you could ever be asked. Conversation at lunch was:
Ella: I don't really want to pay for a ticket...
Josh: I don't really care, it's only ten bucks
Jesse: Wait, tickets are only ten dollars?
Josh: Yeah...I'm taking Stacey, asked her just the other day
Ella: Oh good!
Jesse: Ten dollars isn't bad for homecoming tickets
Ella: Oh I know! Prom's like what, 50? 60?
Jesse: Ella, do you want me to pay for your homecoming ticket?
Ella: Are you going to homecoming?
Jesse: I might
Ella: Then sure, you can pay for my ticket, Jesse

But when the conversation was over I still wasn't sure if he had asked or even what had just happened...
(Hannah, please don't ask him about that, ask Josh if anyone)

And now my throat REALLY hurts, and I think it MIGHT be allergies... One can only hope...
Gosh darn my lack of homework, I guess I'll just read my choice book for IB English... I'm reading The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox, it should be pretty good. I like it so far. Although the incest (except not really, a girl slept with her step-brother) is a bit weird... it's kinda messed up

Might write more later- enjoy it because once I actually get busy I might only write once a month"

"event","Jesse Bethea is too sweet. You can't be mad at him. 

So because of Academy, I'm late to my first two classes everyday. BUT I usually have enough time to stop by the trash can quickly everyday before heading to 4th or 5th. Today, I wasn't really in the mood to talk to Jesse after all the facebook messaging that had ben going back and forth, so I just kinda stayed away from him. This is going to sound lame, but I noticed him leave his circle and kinda walk in the direction of mine so I headed away. And before I know it, there's a Jesse attached to my backpack. I'm a terrible person, I kinda ran saying over and over ""I have to go to class."" But he was like shouting ""NO! There's something I have to give you""
So I stopped and he says ""Whenever Ted did something to upset Lily, he would buy her a beer..."" (As soon as he said this, I couldn't stop smiling) ""Well I couldn't really bring you a beer, so I thought this might work"" And he handed me a can of coke from his backpack. 
I was so amazed, and kind of upset, because how could I be mad at him when he did something so sweet and heartwarming. And kind of personal joke-ish because I was probably one of three girls he knows who would actually get that. I thought it was unbelievably sweet and I talked about it to like almost everyone I saw in 4th and 6th who knew Jesse, which was like 4 people... but still. 
I was also tired and dead at the beginning of rehearsal so I went straight to a couch and got comfy in the ever wonderful fetal position. Stupid ITS meeting got moved down to ramp... so I had to get up, and then people took my spot. I kinda avoided eye contact with Jesse- I dunno, I just still felt a little off (and check my facebook status, I don't think I'm very healthy right now). But we eventually slipped into our quasi-friendship of usual so that was cool. And I drank the coke he gave me to keep myself awake durring the read through

and now i have some precalc homework that I don't understand the end of... I'll ask Stacey on the bus I guess...

And did everyone see Tina Fey's Sarah Palin impression- flawless."

Because at least that way I don't have it getting back to my friends who don't read my Lj cuz I don't really trust them.

Robert Downey Jr. is really cute in Gothica 
Being Rome's AD for Charlie and the Chocolate factory should be interesting
Precalc is annoying
9/11 was really terrifying- there's a documentary made by two french film makers who accidentally were right outside the world trade center that day. The most real footage I have ever seen.
Some people need to lighten up and get over themselves (I very well could be one of them)
Don't make Sam laugh too hard, he throws up
Being rejected for no particular reason hurts... a lot
Apathy is disturbing
I wish I had cool teachers I could hang out with and talk to again, like McCarty and Kuhn (who emailed me back about college recommendations)

Adam and the Ants- fun band

"event","So the auditions and callback of the fall play occurred. I didn't even get to read for the role I originally wanted which was a real bummer (apparently I didn't have 'the look' they were going for- which is one element of the theatre world that will always bug me) but I did get to read for the reporter and that was actually really fun. I was all pretentious and awesome- Bnay compared me to a) a slutty/sexy librarian and b) Sarah Palin [with the glasses on]. Stacey told me this morning that when I went up for Susan (the reporter) Rome said 'do we really need anyone else to read?' which was flattering and made me happy. BTW: if it wasn't clear, I got cast as the reporter

Oh, and Rome decided to schedule the production class's show for the same weekend as the Academy show, so now none of the upperclassmen can do the class show and we have to do 'research' while the freshmen work. Things like this (and how he treats me with no true respect) just make me wanna just leave drama asap. Not worth it! Ass whole. 

Oh and for Hannah and Patricia, little update on Robinson:
Sticks and Stones is going to be an awesome show, even though the casting is a bit strange here and there... Stacey and Josh have started casually dating, they're not going out, just a few dates here and there. Oh yeah, and Stacey dumped Jacob via email (because he said 'gotta go- email me if it's important') on Sunday. And she couldn't very well do it in person, him being in Texas and what not. The drama department seems a bit lacking without you guys, and the Hispanics are trying to take our trash can from us, Bitches. 

General stuff

I finished How I met Your Mother yesterday. I TOTALLY KNEW Barney was in love with Robin. CALLED it! From the moment he was comforting her after she got dumped by the bum canadian- knew it! But I don't always get the references or the jokes and sometimes when I'm not quite alright I forget character names... so Jesse's been giving me a really hard time about that. In fact Jesse is just giving me a hard time (period). His new favorite phrase is 'Ella, sometime the shit that comes out of you mouth...' and then he threatens to slap me. Bitch. And he was one of the people who seriously encouraged me to watch HIMYM, and now he gets mad if I finish his quotes for him, even though he makes me say something HIMYM related when he wants to leave the table so he can say 'I said good-day!' 
I was thinking of asking if he'd like to go to homecoming as friends (since Emily has a boyfriend now, and he hasn't actually talked to her since June), but now I'm not so sure I'd want to. If he keeps being a jerk. And when I try to just not talk to him at lunch, because he's being kinda mean, he pokes me! And then he'll say something funny or nice and I'll forgive him. GARH. 

At church, I've been quoting Barney's Legendary, and I always cite HIMYM, you know, so other people can see the awesomeness. But now I get asked to say the 'Legen- wait for it, hope your not lactose-intolerant, because the next half of this word is-Dary!' they all find it so very entertaining.... 
And there's a new hot guy at much church, he goes to Nova. And he's not really new, I've seen him at workcamp and Rally before, but he's never been to MY church til now, and he's SO attractive. And so sweet and soft-spoken, though he looks like a James Dean 'rebel-without-a-cause' type *melt*. And he works at a recording studio!!!!! *LOVE* 

Oh and I've realised how insanely stupid I was when I was younger. Even at sixteen... we do a lot of growing in these teenage years. We can look back and even though our personalities aren't that different, the way we view things, our basic rational thoughts are very different. I think what's really made me realize this was meeting up with people I haven't seen in a year (like Tom, who I used to have a crush on, but now I just seem him as an average person and I realize that my crush on him was just me idolizing this older man and it wasn't real). We talked for like a good twenty minutes and while he still looks at me like a cute little girl, I think he noticed that I'm maturing because he changed how he was talking to me like mid-way through conversation. He started to talk to me as an equal(instead of a young child)- and it was AWESOME!  I love having intelligent and informed conversations now, it's like a new high. 

I don't have much homework right now, because my teachers give it out in odd increments- lots of homework all due at one, and then a lull that lasts at least two or three days, then lots of homework.... then a lull... 
thankfully the 'lots of homework' is assigned right before a weekend, so I can do it on weekends and then hang out with friend from Sunday through Friday. 

But for now I'm going to say good-bye and farewell."

But as Chris and I were talking yesterday, we starting talking about how right now we're living really easy lives, living off our parents, hardly any worries of real importance, but within a year it'll be different. Within five years we'll be on our own, in the 'real world'. And if you think about it, or at least when ever I think about it, 'the real world' is such a strange term. It's basically just taking care of yourself now, it's not a different world, so much as new and different responsibilities.

In other news...
Ella is officially a How I Met Your Mother addict. I've been watching it non-stop, the other day when I was hanging out with various drama peeps including Jesse and Stacey, we continuously quoted it together, it was legendary! Yeah I said it! And Doogie Houser is next in my netflix queue!
But what I last saw from Netflix was this movie called Prince Charming from 2001 with Christina Applegate (the actress who just had breast cancer) and Bernadette Peters and Martin Short. It was kind of adorable. The prince and his manservant (Martin Short) were turned into frogs after Prince John broke the Princesses heart. They were to remain frogs forever until a maiden kissed, fell in love with, and married the froggy prince. So 500 years later, in Central Park, Frog Prince John is kissed, a love triangle ensues, magic goes awry... It's all very funny! I recommended it for a light hearted adorable comedy. 
BTW: I recommend knowing your shakespeare to watch this movie, the movie involved a group of actors who put on a different shakespeare play nightly. It's very cute, and the references are adorable. Christina Applegate is very pretty, and the guy who plays the prince is adorably attractive and chivalrous- even if in the beginning he does anything in a skirt. 

In other news, I have no other news. Except maybe that I played Sims2 for like 8 hours today... I'm pathetic... But  I did a lot of cool stuff with my Sims, WITHOUT cheating!

And I'm currently experiencing what I like to call a surge of Scottish obsession. Every time I read these books I suddenly feel so much closer to my scottish heritage, like I belong there. Like I should be in the places this  book describes. And who know, maybe I should be. Last summer when I came back from Scotland, my dad told me  I should have looked for the plaid of Bean, cuz apparently my great-grandmother was also scottish, not just my great-grandfather. So I looked up Bean for the first time today and it turns out that the Bean 'lands' are actually where this story starts. Inverness- where the lochness also is. 
And now I want to learn Gaelic so badly! Like you don't even know! Next summer, my parents said they would take me to London, Wales and Edinburgh. I just have to tell them where I want to go and find out some of the information for them. So now I need to go to Inverness no doubt! And Edinburgh, and talk to people about Gaelic... 

oh and I might as well give a pitch for Outlander as well. I've been telling a lot of people about it, and all those who know it or have read it know how amazing it is. 

ok so, WWII just ended, a woman and her husband are on their second honeymoon after being separated for 6 years by the war. The woman (claire) goes out to this stone circle one day and suddenly, when walking through and around the stones, is pulled through to somewhere entirely the same but completely different. She sees her self in the middle of some sort of battle, very confused she runs into the woods. She thinks she's just interrupted a  filming of some sort, but where are the camera crews...? Suddenly a man dressed as a Dragoon appears... and he looks just like her husband....

IT""S SOOOOOOO GOOD! She later meets a man named Jamie, and Jamie is just the most adorable, amazing man ever! 

The book's got a lot of graphic sex and violence, btw. But it's amazing! And the second book is JUST as amazing! The second book doesn't have the same romance element, but it's a continuation of an amazing story and it's unbelievably amazing. A lot of reviews of the book that I read out of curiosity said things like, 'I didn't expect to like it, but I LOVED it.' and something actually really caught my attention, one person said that it helped her to understand love better. What love is and what it means. These really are beautiful, amazing books- and I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone. 

I'm so glad the third book is sitting here in front of me! Now I just need to buy the fourth, trade my sister for the fifth, and buy the sixth...."

"event","I've gone from page 100 to page 430 in the course of a week of summer school... yeah.... I read a lot in that class. Well we do a work sheet that I complete quickly and then I read, at lunch I don't really know anyone so I read, on the bud ride I read (more to avoid the strange people than anything). 
But I didn't read much today... spent a lot of time talking to this kid, Derek, who is basically ME in male form. And instead of talking about hair, make-up and hot guys, he talks about cars, rims, and who knows what. We quote In the Heights together, he starts a line and I'll finish it. And he's CUTE! and a singer! DO YOU KNOW HOW RARE THAT IS? Well rare in the fact that he's single and in my grade. And his ex went to my school- and this will sound bitchy- but she was not that pretty, so I'm feeling moderately confident. I don't think anything will happen.... but I think I've at least captured his interest... at least a bit... 

Oh, a Chris and I hung out after senior portrait- just talked, ate ice cream... kinda boring... chris only wants to sit and talk, and talk and talk. I think the only reason he likes to hang out with me is because I listen. Last time we hung out we were joking and flirting... but this was just boring... But while we were talking he texted his friend, Dan, because I told him how Dan had made me cry in 6th grade. And then Dan asked in a text if chris was gonna hook up with me, and i just LAUGHED. 

But all in all- life is kinda bland/boring lately. I read and watch surf the channel... A LOT. 
and facebook, A LOT
and check LJ, A Lot
see a trend?

my friends, except for chris and rebecca, all live super far like 30 minute drives. ugh... and my parents will only buy me one tank of gas once they raise my allowance. I need a job...

Oh, visited Craig today... and told Sarah R. to say hi to him. She was kinda psyched when I told her he was inside, probably cuz I talk about him when she talks about Casey. I'm really jealous of how much blood she gets to work with with Casey... IFTA didn't do bloody SC... sad stuff that."

do the youth listen... no! So I'm forced to use underhanded tactics to make them see the error of their ways, and if if they didn't see the error, at least I stopped the ho from actually being a true ho. I don't regret telling him you wanted him to cheat on his girlfriend with you and I don't regret telling you to get over it- he doesn't want you and your just distancing yourself from all your friends and being a bitch



ok well... I'm done with that for now

Summer School is BORING! and not that hard... which is good but at the same time- it worries me that the SOL will be tough since this seems so easy and quick right now. Truly crash course in Geosystems. 

I'm usually in a show or a theatre program right now... it feels wrong to be in class for an actual class..."

"event","Why don't you write in your livejournals? My life ISN'T interesting, I need to read about others and live vicariously through them. And you know I do want to know what's up with everyone. And its nice to be able to relieve my boredom by reading about people and what they're up to.



But other than being exasperated by you guys lack of writing...
We had this long talk in CLC about judging people and I already knew I judged people, but I think this talk made me take a step back and really look at how negative that judging has been to my life lately...

And I'm really starting to love techno and dance music... *shrug* *guilty smile* I'll probably never actually talk about it to people, kind of a guilty pleasure.

I'm starting to envy people in relationship and with great friends who are free to do stuff. All my friends hang out during the summer, and while I would love to hang out, I don't get out of summer school til 2:15, and either people already have plans or are already out by that time... I feel so lonely and friendless- or at least seperated from friends. 

Oh and supposedly the bangs make me look older... A girl in CLC asked if I had aged since the last time she saw me...three weeks ago...But I do find myself worring if people are only SAYING that they look good cuz they don't wanna hurt my feelings... I'm really paranoid about how other's perceive me, it really is a terrible trait of mine. *wince*

well... thats it for now
Summer school seems easy enough- two guys who do drama at their schools found out I did drama by over hearing a conversation I had with Tamika and suddenly I had two boys in Geosystems trying to chat me up about theatre... odd stuffs"

"event","Ok, so got my hair cut yesterday and it looked great! yesterday... today I woke up and my bangs were all wavy and the hair was poufy. And I took a shower and it was awful! I spent HOURS trying to make the bang behave. But that didn't help any because as soon as I walked outside I got all sweaty and my bangs got all nasty. and now I have to wash them and blow dry them AGAIN before I go to Julieanna's house... I'm kinda really upset about the bangs... I don't even know why it bugs me so much, it's JUST hair. And it also kinda saddens me that my hair doesn't go past my waist anymore, now its just 4 inches or so below my shoulder... but it kinda works... but it's SO short :(

Besides that, spent the morning watch The Soup (Joel McHale(sp?) is freakin hilarious). Also watched the Nanny like usually in the morning. Didn't have my morning coffee til 11:30- and had double my usual amount so I was shaking for quite sometime- but it was SO good, so it don't regret it. And I read for like an hour... that was ok- the book is very upsetting, it's the 5th book in this series I've been reading since 7th grade (new book comes out each year). Well I'm just not very happy with how it's going right now. I kinda wish for the good old days of the 1st and 2nd book... those were the best ones. 

Also visited Craig and his stage combat II's. SO MANY girls, it was weird, there were more girls than guys in the class. And they weren't even girls who were tom boys- they were like girly-girls (for lack of a better word... calling them feminine just seems odd and formal). The girls also seem to want to show off as much skin as humanly possible. I felt almost prudish in my loose jersey top (but my shorts were itsy so woops).  One girl waved at me, and she seemed VAGUELY familiar, like a girl who took SC1 last year. And apparently they cut the school day by a 30 min. I'm guessing for budget reasons. But anywho, talking to Craig was cool, I feel kinda bad saying this- but I can tell that he's aged since the first time he was my teacher 2 years ago. OH and SC got nicer weapons! WTF!?!!? We had CRAP equipment for the past two years and now shiny new sword and daggers all of a sudden! AND they got the main hall way! I feel cheated *pout*. I was glad, though that I didn't retake the class, just cuz I know I would have been bored taking the same class for the third year, doing the same things. Craig's impressed me though, he has actual lesson plans day by day. None of my drama teachers have ever had lesson plans that I know of. They try to but within a few classes the 'lesson plan' falls apart and is forgotten. I'll probably drop in again next week, my portraits not til 2:30, but I need like an hour or so to get ready at home so I'll leave summer school at 1-ish.

My jaw is being a bitch lately. Just saying! I was recommended to go to a physical therapist, but with my schedule as it is, my mom wants me to wait a month or two so that I actually have the time to go for five weeks strait. And money's a bit tight right now- what with my sister being in Rome- and this isn't covered by insurance so we want to wait to see if I need. And I could definitely cope with my jaw as it is if I need to. Just can't take big bites of anything... And I may never be able to fit my fist in my mouth again...*sigh* what a shame. 

And on that note, hope you all enjoyed reading this long, boring and a bit pessimistic blog entry. Have a nice day!"

"event","CAI is over much to everyone's sadness and disappointment. It was an amazing show full of lots of amazing singing and dancing and it was all in all quite a blast and I know I'm so much the better for it. I got to meet many actors that I love and admire, I got to meet a writer whose work I was extremely impressed by. And I got to realize something that hadn't really truly clicked with me before. Broadway actors are pretty darn normal. I'm not sure they realize how much we love their work, and if they do it doesn't seem to phase them in any way shape or form. All the people I met were very cool, very laid back, and not at all full of themselves. It was cool.

Now summer school is starting up on monday- grrrh! Geosystem... hardly my favorite subject to start with, but 6 hours a day is gonna be hell. *DREAD*

But I saw American Dreamz last night, I was really sad to see Hugh Grant die. Even if his character was a total sleaze. 

And I saw North & South with Richard Armitage (Guy of Gisborne in Robin Hood). It was BRILLIANT. Seriously worth the 5 hours it takes to watch- you can find the entire thing on YouTube, or you can netflix it. It's like Jane Austen but set around more serious topics like the starving and destitute factory workers and their union in the North of England. And there's a really adorable love story going on between the factory owner and a girl whose just moved north who is making friends with all the factory workers... It's adorable and made me feel just a little more culture and refined for watching it. Now I just need to read the book. I also need to read all the Jane Austen books that I've watched the movies of.
Oh and the lead female in North & South  has also been in Torchwood (Tosh's lesbian lover in Greeks Bearing Gifts) and in My Family and the daughter Janey (not that that means anything to any of you)- but those are two of my favorite shows. And I was watching the movie and I kept thinking- I KNOW her... but where?


Oh and the finale of Doctor Who... well it's bittersweet and that's all I'll say..."

"event","Just saw the second to last episode of Doctor Who of this season....
I cried!!!!

and that's all I'm gonna say about that since Hannah is a butt and hasn't seen the series yet. (and I mean butt in the most loving way possible)

Other than that...
CAI:
It's been a great first week, although our choreographer annoys the hell out of me most the time. That's how things usually are for me. But I'm realizing how insanely weak I am compared to professionals. The three broadway actors that came to us (well, dancer/actors) all had great stamina and were strong and confidents and basically amazing. I'm starting to TRULY realize how much work goes into this profession. And I'm not sure I could actually afford to live and work in New York ever, even though it's my dream. Starting in DC is definently an option, but how am I going to survive out of college? I wont be able to afford an apartment... EEK! So many worries are popping up before they need to. All I can think is how I need to work while I'm in college and save up so that I can eventually afford a place to live and afford to be out of work for a few months at a time. Even the most successful broadway actors can be out of work for months on end. The girl we met from Cry Baby, Cameron Adams, she found out five days prior that her show was closing and she didn't have a job set up until 2 months from now so she's out of work for two months... 
Ack, being an actor scares me so much. I love performing, and I LOVE portraying a character on stage and creating a character, but I am so scared that I wont make it. But I have to- I have to work and be 'successful' and by successful, I don't mean famous, I mean- able to make a living doing what I love. 
And like one of our teachers says- we don't work because we want to, we work because we have to. And that's the drive that keeps us trying our hardest at auditions and even doing shows we hate sometimes, because we HAVE to. 

Although you can't box yourself in with only theatre stuff- because if all you do is theatre how can you reflect life? So I've start to read magazine articles, and I don't mind informing myself on things in the world. It's good to stay up date on whats going on outside of theatre and to have other interests and passions. It also makes you a much more interesting person. I think...

Ok so this entire entry either sounds really smart or really stupid... but whatever... It's cool... 


Oh lord, I have an audition with Bob Cline tomorrow, and it's a mock audition so I shouldn't be worried, but still- he teaches at my number one school! Oh lordy, I better practice..."

"event","Have you ever thought you liked some one So much, and you hadn't seen them in forever so your attraction to said person went WAY up? And then, you do see said person again after almost a year of not seeing each other and after a few hours of even just being near the person you realize... you have no attraction to this person what so ever. it's an interesting thing...

BTW: scissor sisters SO reminding me of the Patricia and Juicy right now! Just listened to filthy gorgeous and was like PATRICIA! in my mind of course... not out loud... 

And Kiss You Off! reminded me of when Jacob dumped me... yeah it works (in my favor)... believe it or not

I'm actually really glad that we didn't stay together since I noticed how toxic he is.... especially to a lot of the girls in the dept. We talked about toxic relationship in CAI briefly and that IMMEDIATELY came to mind. Hannah- you certainly dodged the bullet.  
Oh and all the dance we do in CAI is already changing my body- I can feel muscles where the aches and pains are starting to dim- and I usually do not have muscle! This is amazing! Oh and I look better in my new dress that I just bought, already. I looked crap in it just a week ago- yay fast changes!"

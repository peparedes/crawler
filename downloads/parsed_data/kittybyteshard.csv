"event","I'm so in love with Ryan.  Its really hard now that hes at college.  But i will get to see him on the weekends and when he comes home during the week.  LIKE TOMORROW!  I am so excited i cant wait to see him!  I'm gunna run and jump on him!  Give him the biggest and bestest kiss he's ever had!  Hes picking me up form school tomorrow.
  He's such a dork, but hes MY dork!  Stay away bitches! i will kick anyones ass who even THINKS of trying to take him from me!
  He's so good to me too.  I wish he was here right now.  I mean after living with him for three weeks and falling asleep next to him every night and waking up next to him every morning, its weird sleeping in my own bed, sleeping is weird ion general now that hes not here. Im used to being with him every day.
  I guess this is gunna take some getting used to, but i know that he and i will make through in the very end.  I mean as long as we try right?  I don't care that hes an hour away, his distance from me doesn't nor will it ever change how i feel about him. He makes me smile when i have no reason to, he makes me laugh when i'm crying, he wipes the tears from my eyehes my teddy bear at night.  HJe means everything to me.
  I love him so much.

Baby I love you.

Sis your the best ever, i can't wait until we have our first road trip.  It should be lots of fun.

Peace out all!"

"event","ok so I'm at Ryans house waiting to go to concord with him.  Hes looking for a shoe right now.  Anyways... I love him sooo much.  he makes me so happy.  I can never Actually get mad at him.   Its great I pretend to be mad. then we kiss and make up.  My sister is telling me to be good to this one.   I am .  Don't worry there is no way i want to fuck this one up.  I don't think even Crispy made me this happy.  But then again Chris is so fucked up in the head that he would mess around with my Sister and then date my best friend...  ANYWAYS.  Me and Ryan bought two mice.  Tweak and Daisy (this is actually the second Daisy that I have owned. the first one was a spaz.)  
..::looks for a chair::..
No chair for Sarah.  Its gunna be so hard for me when Ryan goes off to college.  I'm gunna miss him sooo much.  I mean we have been spending every waking moment together.(I found a chair.)  Ive spent the last four nights at his house.  I love him soo much.  Hes siiting in the room being retarded.  Going through his college books and making me all sad.  He doesn't know it though.  He does now cuz I told him.
I'm so fucking tired we had to get up early to go take care of the horses.  HAHA He's so cute.   I love him.  He woke me up this morning with a kiss.  Thats so sweet.
we just invented a new word.... ""indianishy.""  now he won't let me touch the indianishy knife.   loser.  ok I gotta stop tying like a loser.  I just have nothing interesting to say today. work sucked.  Instead of working games because we were shorthanded I got stuck on the fucking train.... I hate the train.
I'm hungry.
I'm Tired.
I'm out.
Peace."

"event","ok.  firts off i must say my newest boyfriend is amazing.  I fell for him really hard and really fast.  I love being around him.  He is so great.  He makes me so happy. I'm gunna miss him when he goes to college but I know We can make it work.  His name is Ryan Frazier.  He is 18 and will be 19 on the 28th of August.  He drives a Mitsubishi Galant.  And He loves me.  I am really hoping that this one works.  I am so sick of being in shitty relationships with shitty guys.  Anyways.
  So It was me Ryan, Ryans brother Mike, and his girl ( Whom is the shit, I work with her.) Becca.  We all decided that we wanted to go out one night.  We were just driving around laughing our asses off.  we passed places like Busters, Friendlys, Movie Theatres, Bowling Alleys, and Wal Mart, Jokers, and Chuckie Cheeses.  Which place did we go to?  CHUCK E. CHEESES! cuz Ryan wanted to go.  It was so funny.  we walked in the doors and the guy asked us... ""you all 18?""  of course we said yes.   Why does it matter? I mean how ca a 17 year old like myself get hurt or lost in CHUCK E. CHEESES???  Anyways, so me and Becca found it absolutely hysterical that we were in there.  We played some games won some tickets, laughed at the guys, cheeted at whack-the-lights(HAHA) and then with the tickest we won, we got me a Mr. Potato Head!!!!!   It was so awesome... we then went to friendlys.  I had to be home at ten or eleven.
  My next adventure was with my sister, her boyfriend Glen Me and Ryan.  First we all went to busters to play pool, where we realized that me and my sister suck.  the guys totally kicked our asses.  Anyways then wee went out to dinner at friendlys.  Big Mistake!  HAHA me and sis were playing paper football and giggling like crazy.  I put GLenns elbow in Ketchup, after mae mae pured it on some left over cole slaw.  the guys decided that we can't go anywhere together.  It was great.  acting like three year olds laughing our asses off, and having the time of our lives.
  I hope i get to see Ryan today, even though  I just spent the past three nights at his house. I dunno I just don't get sick of seeing him.  Mum Said if i clean my room I can see him when he gets outa work. What she don't knqo is i woulda seen him neways cux i would have told him to come over whether it was clean or not.
  Anyways I gotta go get back to cleaning.

I love you Babe.

My big Sister Is the SHit! I love you!

See Ya'll Lata!"

I don't control how his mind works and what rolls out of his big mouth,  (there are some things he has said that i wish he wouldn't have but did/does anyways.)
  Mallory I hate to say it but I have to.  Listen to me.  YOu have him.  You have won ok?  I already told him even if the two of you did break up, I wouldn't go back to him.  So you have him. 
  YOu know what? Fuck it.  Cunt am i?  Bitch am I?  I don't care  I find it a compliment to know that chris can't get me out of his head.  Fine...  I don't care.  Bye."

"event","yeha, so i have yet another boyfriend who is leaving me... Chris Beames.  we have been dating for a week and he will be moving to florida in less than two.  it's the same boyfriend as previously mentioned.  but i have come to realize that every time i get even remotely attached they seem to go away.  I hate it.  It's not fair.
  I have also come to realize that i can no longer be afraid.  because if i am to live the rest of my life affraid of everythng then i am to be condemmed to livign in a hospital with some one sitting outside my door while i sleep.
  I also now know that the only true friend i have is me.  I am the only person who will not abandon or leave me alone in the dark.  I have to be strong,  i have to love myself in order to get by.
  i hate the heat.  it makes me throw up every morning and dehydrates me.  ugh i have to be to work soo too.  just what i need more heat.  although i must say that i do love gteting  paid to stand around and press buttons all day.
Well i guess I am to now wait for my ride.  Later."

  I' sorry Sis, But:

(Sounds of someone puking) 

""There I go--thinking of you again 

 
You don't know how sick you make me 
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach 
Every time I think of you, I puke 
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
You may not think you do, but you do 
Every time I think of you 

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem 
But off of the dome would probably be a little more, 
more suitable for this type of song--whoa 
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of 
Sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink ta 
So fuck it, I'ma start right here by just be brief-a 
Bout to rattle off some other reasons 

If you only knew how much I hated you 
For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through 
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you 
Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-who 

 
You don't know how sick you make me 
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach 
Every time I think of you, I puke 
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
You may not think you do, but you do 
Every time I think of you 

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter 
But I thought a song would probably be a little better 
Instead of a letter 
That you'd probably just shred up--yeah 
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of 
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta, a stupid piece a 
Paper, I'd rather let you see how 
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle 
You're a fuckin' cokehead slut, I hope you fuckin' die 
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye 
I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut--I hope you die 
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie 
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad 
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back 
It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna yak 
-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag 
What else can I do, I haven't got a clue 
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to 
But every time I think of you now, all I wanna do 
Is pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke 

 
You don't know how sick you make me 
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach 
Every time I think of you, I puke 
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
You may not think you do, but you do 
Every time I think of you, I puke 

Fuckin' bitch""

I went swimming in the river at the boat launch today. it was so awesome... a tad bit cold... but still awesome... ahah lets just say that i was the only one in a bathing suit.  Jesus and Crispy decided to go in their boxers.  I went in first...  the pussies ahd to run in arm in arm to make sure they both went in at the same time.  It was a lot of fun.

I wish i could hang out with chris more often.  I get to me him and all but i just don't think i see him enough.  Call me dependent but i love him and i just wish i could see him alot more.

Her and I were like sisters, then when i disapeared she randomly started to hate me.  But something made her realize what was going on,  and now i think we're all friends again.
  Then of course they could all be secretly planning to pull one over on me.  But I won't know until the time comes.  
  I told Mal I would meet up with her whenever she wants, I can't wait to see her.  
  
  Chris took me to the movies today.  We saw StarWars.  It was a pretty good movie.  I'm actually waiting for him to call me when he gets out of work.  (scratch that i'm calling him now, fucking hold music...) maybe I can see him tonight.  0He wants to take me to an art museum tomorrow but I'm still sick because of him.  we'll see how I feel tomorrow.  
 Anyways...  I better get going... I should get some sleep before I go on a midnight stroll.

"event","Well... Today just had to be.... the absolute.... BEST CHRISTMAS EVER!!!  I spent practically the whole day with Chris...  Which obviously was... awesome.... He gave me the nicest Christmas present... a huge teddy (which makes three stuffed animals for Christmas...Emmma gave me a teddy and Chris bought me a cow...)  A letter, which was a personal thing between he and I... and a CD that has all songs that he thinks were written just for us...  
  I gave him a box of rainbow sharpies... to color on CD R's... Ten CD R's and Blank cases.... a box of condums... (HEH) and a lighter, and a peronalized framed poem that I wrote just for him.... MAYBE I will share taht with you all later.... MAYBE...  We ate Dinner at my house around four, then we ate at his Mom's house around 7...  Watched part of the sound of Music (surprisingly I have never seen that movie...)  And came back to my house around 9:30 and We read "" How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" together on the couch....  
  Wow... I don't think I can ever Get sick of him, I love him way too damned much!!! I just wanna go to sleep in his arms and wake up so that he is the first thing I see in the morning...  I want to bare his children.... (Lily, Connor, Mark, )
  I love his family too... me and EMmma ( his l;ittle sister) act and hang out like we're sisters... I call his Dad, Dad... and his mom, Mom...  He loves my family to pieces... and I think on our first Christmas in our own place imma get him a Puppy...  Maybe he'll get me a kitten...
  I am still so torn as to the whole Meghan thing, I cannot even bare to hear her name mentioned...
  I have another continueing problem as well, the urge to cut is getting stronger... THe desire to see my own blood fall is getting Greater... The longing to drive a blade into my skin is getting harder and harder to resist...  I'm not exactly entirely sure about if i will be able to fight it forever... but everytime i think about that Meghan thing I cry my soul out, and everytime I cry my soul out, I want to cause my self physical yet un-feelable pain... and the more I want to cause my self this pain... the harder it is for me NOT to cause myself this pain...
  I appear alright to everyone... but no one really knows... knows what I'm feeling, What I am mourning over...The pain and agony that is swallowing my soul, my entire being... taking me from my what once was happy self...
  I can't completely complain, or say I am not at all happy...  I am in love with some one... and I will do whatever it takes to keep him by my side... I will try my hardest to make sure he is happy... I will do whatever I need to to please him... [ well ALMOST whatever...(lol I love you baby)]
  I need him to stand by me... I need him... I can't make it without him... I know he won't hurt me... and I know I will try my hardest never to hurt him...  I love him...

I said to Justin "" hey you knwo I never threatened you...""  and he said  ""yeah...""
  What does this mean? It means that meghan is a complete and total britch frace, and I should Hurt her in teh frace with a fork!
  Poor Justin had to change his phoen number, his sn, and his email adress cuz she wouldn't leave him alone... he's pissed cuz she now has a job around where HE lives!!!! 
  I liked Justin... I did... He was perfect for Mae Mae... I mean the old her... now she is a pyschopathic Psychotic,Stubborn, Untrustworthy, Lying, skanky, pathetic, sleeze...  She's pushing all of her friends away... doing things with the worng people with otu having a care about or for how it may or will make others feel...  (heh, I'm too tired to reminiss)

Anyways... I have to go, If you can think of something to say that may help me, please do.

"event","I have just realized I don't give my baby enough credit... I love Him, and I don't ever want to hurt him again... I know I get ignorant and childish... Stubborn and naive...  Immature and pig-headed... (gods this list could go on and on...)
But I know I do it now, and I am going to do my best to stay with him and work on the qualities that have been deemed unsuitable for relationships...

So Many people ask me... WHY? Why do you love him?  well I can tell you...
1) He respects me and what I say. 
2) He respects my opinion.
3) He respects my body. 
4) He loves me. 
5) He loves me for who I am. 
6) He loves every part of me, even my untollerable rantings, and annoying mood swings. 
7) He thinks I'm Beautiful, (haha even my Godfrey nose is beautiful to him.) 
8) He's stayed around for so long, and hasn't fucked me over, as he has promised me. 
9) He's sweet to me, even after I have been unimmaginably cruel and callous to him. 
10) He would/has/could never Betray me. 
11) To him I am the most Beautiful person. 
12) He always is looking for me to get help, or thinking about OUR future, (not his or mine, OURS) 
13) He always wants to make sure I am perfectly fine with desiscions, and if he doesn't ask me when he is making them, I know he will come to me afterwards and tell me, and if it upsets me (no matter what stupid reason it upsets me for...) he will try to make me see his side, and make it up to me.
14) He wants the best for me.
15) He wants me to be happy, and will risk or give anything for that to be so.
16) He pushes for me to achieve my goals and follow through with my dreams.
17) He gives me the negative side of things even if It's not what I wnat to hear( Why is that a good and lovable trait? Because everyone needs to hear the truth, no one should be locked behind their misleading and untruthful minds forever.)
18) He not only cares about me, but about my brothers and parents, and how things at the house affect everyone in the house.
19) He is always willing to give up time for me ( well except when I wake him up too early...)
20) He is always willing to help me with my bad habbits ands problems and personality issues when he doesn't need nor deserve to go through the trouble.  My problems always become his.
21) He's willing to change for me ( Though I wouldn't change him for the world.)
22) He's always there, waiting, whether I push him out or push him away, he will always be waiting.
23) Well, Most importantly, He loves me.

I didn't list nearly enough of the things i love about him, like his smile, and the way he smells, and the goofy way he dances...  But I think all of you ignorant people who say that we aren't in love will see or at least start to see that I love him.  I love him very much.  I would give or do anything for him... I want to bare his children... lol little Connor and Kiana... maybe we will adopt a few too... Because you know what? this planet has millions of children that need homes and love and care, why do we continue to fill this worl, this undesirable place of dwelling with more mouths to feed when we can't even feed the ones already on it?
  America really is a selfish and cold0hearted country...
But anyways, I'm getting off the subject... I wrote this entry to remind me, and Chris, when I get how I often Get, Why I love him, and that I always will... no matter what I say to him.
  ""I will give you your wings, I will help you to fly...""

"event","Yeah... I'm just waiting for chris to pick me up so i can go to work... I feel so bad though... all the times i bitched about sis, and now... i have really fucked it all up... I wish she didn't think i use her, or taht i don't trust her in general... i just don't trust her with him, she has a past, and i remember it oh too well... ( by the way, thank oyu chris for telling her everything i said, after you said you wouldn't... u need to work on ur promises...)  
I should prolly go and make sure she really does have those pictures as password protected... knowing her, she may want payback.
I don't wnat her to go anywhere, and I think it's really too bad that she can't trust me with her issues... taht's why i ""don't trust her"" i dont trust people who don't trust me... like my parents...
anyuways... I can't think of anything better to say... cept i'm sorry...
and it really is too bad she thinks i use her..."

  Haha he actually said see ya... I never left of course but i was ready to hurt him when he started insulting my firends...

Fucking decker ( Dubby Dog ) he really misses mom, he's pissing all over the house... its like he's saying ""I'm not gunna stop until Mom cleans it up.""  HAHA  
  Dad was doing the socks and was liek... ""well these must be your mothers socks, none of em match... oh i know what i'll do, I'll put them in a big sock, that way, it'll look like one giant foot!!!""
  He is such a goof ball sometimes...
But when I went out side to bring out some recyclables, and attempt to have a cigaratte, he followed me asked what i was doing, and i told him exactly what i was doing...

"event","Aight... I have decided that if people can't stop leaving rude messages complaining about me bitching IN MY FUCKING JOURNAL, I will just make all of those entries private... People are just stupid and immature...  
   Oh Damn... this is turning into a Bitching Journal Entry...   I don't think a LITTLE bitching will hurt ne one.
   I hate how mae mae thinks that she has teh RIGHT to tell me that i need to leave town and get help, or that i shouldn't go out with Chris, Whom is the best person that I have ever dated mmore than once.  I love him, I'm happy with him, and I don't think Mae MAe, who has been having guy trouble herself, has the right or the best advice to give to me...  I'm not going anywhere, I will do whatever Chris wants me to do for help.  I wish she would just stop interfereing.  
   Yes I love Chris,  I do.  I want to spend the rest of my life with him.  And I am hoping that he will stop taking everyones problems onto his shoulders because it is going to kill him. His friends problems instantly become his own, and he can't help every one.  Even though he wants to, It will tear him part inside and he will not have time to take care of his own problems.  
   I know I'm not the only one in his life,  and I know I'm not the most important person to him.  But I wish He would make HIMSELF more important, otherwise he isn't going to be able to ever consider bimself mentally stable... If he keeps on taking on other peoples problems he won't be stable.  
   I don't care what Mae Mae thinks about me and Chris being back together, nor do I appreciate you telling him not to go back out with me.  He is 20 years old, nearly 21, and he has his own mind which he can use to think for himself, and he has a mouth, which he can use to speak for himself.  
   I have sworn to do my best to abide by his rules and follow his demands. Why?  Because I want to make Chris happy...  I love him... I don't care what you say about that... You can say I don't know what love is... but thisa feeling inside of me is nothing other than love.  I can promise you that.
    I have to go... I will finish this when i have time

  P.S. Have the respect for me that you won't post rude comments... you have somehting to say write it in YOUR JOURNAL....

"event","So... My mom is on a cruise... in the Bahamas... WITHOUT ME!!!  GR! she left me with my beligerant father... HWom I have yet to see without a beer in his hand...  He kicked Chris out the other night... He threw his shoes down the stairs and told him to get the fuck out... That was Sunday night... Saturday I went out to Movie night with Mae Mae...  I was sick on Sunday and I didn't want to go to school, but my dad would have made me, so I just sorta skipped.  But then I went to work and Chris brought me home. I helped him as much as possible on his art project, but I was so sick, and exhausted, I fell asleep.  He went upstairs, Got my sleeping bag, my giant stuffed cow, and my blankie, Tucked me in told me he loved me kissed me on the forehead and went home... 
  How cute is that?  Awe... I love him... He can be a pain in my ass... but I do love him none the less...  
  On Monday I went to his house and burned a CD.  WHich I am listening to right now.  The song at this moment is ""Smoke on the Water"" By Deep Purple.  Anyways... Yeah still sick... And I have been for the past Three days.  But my Dad won't let me stay home from school.   if I stare at the screen mindlessly for too long, I will fall asleep. Gr.  I wish I was at home sleeping.  
  I can sorta type without looking... it's rather fun.  And if I continue practicing while I write in my live journal, I will be able to do it with ease.  I want to go to the mall today,  But I haven't gotten my first Paycheck yet.  I will soon enough... Friday... Then its going into the bank except for like 30 Dollars... How else am I supposed to get presents?  Well ok... I will steal Quite a bit of em... But you know how it is... gotta confuse some of the people... brb must blow nose...

...

...

Ack... Cough cough...  
I wish I was in in-school... Well sorta...  I don't want to have to do all my classes over again next year, cuz if I miss anymore days, I might have to.
  I feel bad about Pat, or well, what how Pat feels about Chris, don't get me wrong, I love Chris, and I love Pat (not like how I love Chris) but still, Pat is right aout what Chris may do when he turns 21.  I just hope he's wrong...

Gotta go to class, I love you all... haha sorta...

"event","ok... so... WOW... What a FUCKING KA-RAY-ZEE night!!!  and thank you to all of you who made it that way!!!

Mae Mae and Chris Endured at leats two hours of me bitching and saying some of the meanist things that i didn't believe it possible for me to say to the people i love th most... ( yeah i know.... u all prolly think i'm like Bi-Polar, which i prolly am, but if u were with the gang last night, u will know of everything that happened and what is going to be written in my journal, at least the meanings of them.)

After me crying for hours i finally told CHris how much i love and need him.. and that me trying to get us to break up was a test i was giving myself to see if i really needed him...and i do...

So after we decided taht i was going to movie night... WITH MY DAD'S PERMISSION!!! YEAH THAT""S RIGHT!!!  Chris and i sat down talked and went over the demands and circumstances at which we would start dating again...

SO... We are... and to tell you the truth... I couldn't be happier...  

Me and sis went to talk about my Mental/Medical disorder (though we are not entirely sure of the name of it we have settled on Cancer in my finger.) See i have some disorder that makes me dissasociate from people and i severely over re-act... not to mention that cutting myself is a disease...

So after evrything was said and done... we... being me diamond and cHris in Chris's car, and Mae MAe and Malakigh in hers.... not to mention Bruce in Chris's... we head for Bruces house... and when we arive.... we realized we for got something....

PAT!!!! 
"" OH SHIT WE LEFT PAT AT IRVING!!!!""
When we retrieve our beloved Jesus from Irving.... all he had to say to us was..."" y'all bitches bitches goin' ta hell....""

we get ack to bruces... watch some movie where Rose mcGowan is a psychopathic Killer.... then... me and Chris brought Pat back to biddeford... then we all went home...."

I think I'm Done with Chris... he has taken anything i could have held onto... he won't say i love you... he talks to my ex-sister more than he does to me... and if he does talk to me he is rude and edgy... it's like he hates me... like he's trying to get me back for all the times i was mean and bitchy to him.... My sister... wait no ex- sister that Galvin girl... is pissed at me cuz she thinks that I told justin to DIe...

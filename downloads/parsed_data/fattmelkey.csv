"event","I just got out of surgery a little while ago, so I'm writing with an IV in my arm. It sorta hurts. Anyway, I'm on morphine so if I say something bad, it wasn't me :-) Well, this has been nuts. Things really have gotten worse before they got better. Frenchie, my calico cat, died 2 nights ago, I got a cold last night, and my teachers gives me way too much homework. I feel better now that the surgery is over though, although my leg hurts. A lot of my family came, which was pretty cool. It's so nice to be reassured that people care. I can't remember anything from when I got into the OR, even though I was awake for a while. When I woke up I was shaking like crazy. They told me it was the morphine. I think my cold may have contributed. Just though I'd update. I'll talk to you all later and I love you guys.

PS-Please come visit me this week at home. I'd love to see you all."

"event","So... I got my cast off... Definitely not as happy a time as I thought it would be. I saw a look on my doctor's face I never thought I'd ever see. It was the look of total frustration mixed with shock and depression. He told me that my leg is worse than it was before I got the cast on. He said that I probably had an infection in my leg which might be a tumor or maybe a simple infection.  He told me I'd have to get an MRI, then we'll treat it. He didn't tell me that he thought it was a cist (I think that's how you spell it) at the time. My mom looked up what it was that he thought it most likely was last night. It is a cist and it will deteriorate my bone if we don't get rid of it soon, which will result in amputation (which definitely won't happen, but is scary). The two ways of getting rid of it are surgery and radiation. I hope to GOD this is not what it is, but I won't be sure until after Wednesday. I'M SOOOOOOO SCARED...

I came home from finding out about my shitty part in the pre cast show (I missed the U of M game, in which they lost, to have the directors pretend to look at me and treat me with no respect). I had also been forced to do karaoke at my church after drinking a Mountain Dew, and embarrassed myself BADLY. All of this combined with the fact that I can't do cross country, my band members (will elaborate later) don't ever want to practice, and my family is always in a shitty mood. I almost lost it last night. I started shaking, repeating things, and started to cry. Why do things all happen to me at once?!?! Am I destined to live a fucked up, unhappy life?!?!?!

Probably...

One a positive note, I finally started a band!!! We are called Ace On A Detour ( anyone at the Pit stuff might know where it came from. We are pretty good. WE ARE GOING TO OPEN FOR COLORBLIND ON HOMECOMING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm sooooo excited!!!!

On another subject, Miranda, and Kate, could you call me? I would call you but I don't have your cell numbers. I'm soooooooooo sorry I didn't get to say goodbye, but I had plans already made. Miranda, thanks sooooo much for the movie. It made me REALLY happy!!!!

Congrats to Steve on getting Amos!!! I need to hang out with you soon, buddy!

God, I feel numb and dizzy. I'm willing to bet I've offended someone by this journal, but at least they know what I'm going through."

Chem-I swear that there is like none of my friends in there (except Carlee and a 1 or 2 others, and if there is anybody that reads this that is in my chem class that I didn't know about, send me a comment). Spanish was definitely not that bad though, but I think the class is too small.

This year is sooooo weird. I feel out of place everywhere I go, even if I am not. Maybe it's the cast, the lack of sleep, the fact that I've been single way too long (and it's still not getting better), the fact that I can't walk (which I mean I can't play sports by) or maybe I'm nuts!!! I could also have a bad itch on the leg with a cast :-) All are possible and probable. 

I need to just chill out. I need to hang out with people in high school SOON!!! Please call me if you're bored. 

I know that things will get better. I just was not in a good mood to begin with. 

Anybody that would like to go see Fall Out Boy, Starting Line, Motion City Soundtrack, Boys Night Out, and Panic! At The Disco, please call me at 424-9834, or just leave a comment.

But man I love music. I am currently almost done learning how to play Konstantine on the piano, and Hurricane and Fall on the guitar by Something Corporate. I've probably already said this but I FUCKING LOVE SOMETHING CORPORATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Did you all know that the lead singer, Andrew McMahon (one of the most talented people in rock music today), has leukemia? I know this is old news but some people still don't know. Anyway, before he found out he had it he started a side project called Jack's Mannequin? Everyone buy the cd. I hear it's fooking sweet!!!
So we enter another school year... I don't know whether to be happy or depressed. I mean, I get to see my friends every day now (even though half of them graduated :-( , but at the same time I have the stress of school. I am on a musical roll right now and school might screw that up. I hope not...
I cannot wait for Company (WTF on A5!!! At least we get lunch together... CHINA BUFFET!!!), West Side Story, and hanging with all you people who read this journal again.

ANYONE INTERESTIED IN JOINING A BAND READ THIS!!!
I need a serious bassist, and guitarist for a band. If you can play well (and like emo and punk) leave a comment below.

Anyway, I was on vacation this weekend in Niagara Falls (which is hell for a handicap). I still had fun though. The falls are amazing!!! It seemed that God was showing his power through water! It was loud and scary, but at the same time beautiful and inviting. The rainbows were amazing also! I got to eat at Hard Rock Cafe, Planet Hollywood, and the Hershey store. They were all really cool! Did you know that Twizzler's are different in Canada, EH? 

On the way back home I stopped by the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame!!! I need to make a pilgrimage to that place at least once a year from now on! I even got a harmonica!!! It's SWEET!!!

I am dealing with the cast better, even though it's starting to smell :-( Ewwww!!! Walking on crutches so much has made my arms numb! I don't know if they're getting stronger or weaker, because I can't feel them!
 
I GET THE STUPID CAST OFF ON SEPTEMBER 12 (Mark it on your calendars, I'm going to PARTAYYYY!!!)

On a sad note... STEPH LEAVES TODAY :-(  :-(  :-(  :-( This sucks... GOOD LUCK AT WESTERN STEPH!!!

I spent last night (or tonight) with her and I had a great time and I will miss her so much!

I have to go to a cross country meet today... I hope to God I don't cry... It's so hard for me to not be running. I'm usually good at controlling my emotions but this injury has broken (haha) the mold for me.

I am filled with musical inspiration at the moment and have been for a few weeks. IT'S GREAT!!! I'm learning something like 2 or 3 songs on the guitar and 2 or 3 on the piano!!! And now I have a harmonica!!!

Anyway, I will update soon. PEACE, LOVE, AND ROCK AND ROLL TO ALL!!!"

"event","Life sure is weird. Let's see, since I last updated lots of stuff has happened. I'm going to update everyone on what has happened, and yeah, lots of it's REAL emo. But hey, what did you expect.

First, I found out that I have a severe stress fracture in my left upper tibia. I tried not to show how much it bothered me, but I have cried a few times in private since. My CC season is practically over, and I can't do anything. Running is one of the biggest things that I do. WHY ME?!?!?

Second, the show was great!!! Except for the fact that I was dancing on my broken leg, and that I seemed to be the only one without a significant other.

Third, I got a full leg cast on. I had a stress attack the first night and started beating the cast on the floor and cutting it with scissors, all while balling like hell. I haven't slept that great yet...

Fourth, I told someone that I liked them and got turned down, even though the person said I still had a chance, but that's BS.

I'm officially announcing that I too am going for Tony with every fiber of my being. This show is going to become my life, because my CC season is fucked, and I want to BADLY act for a living.

I went to a Lugnuts game the other day with my family, which was fun, and I got my cast signed by a minor league ballplayer.

And finally, I went to a Switchfoot concert on Tuesday, which FUCKING ROCKED!!! By the way, their new album is going to be sweet! And did you know that they actually wrote ""Only Hope"" from A WALK TO REMEMBER? 

As I'm sitting here at 1:32 in the morning writing this, I think of random things like how bad it sucks to have a broken leg and how badly I want to become a rock star. Remember this (even though I've probably already said it before), I WILL BE A ROCK STAR OR I WILL BE ON BROADWAY SOMEDAY.

That is all, Good Night, Or Morning."

As I was reading the new LJ's, I came across Steph's. The title caught my attention and I was worried right away. When I got to the bottom, and noticed I wasn't there, I knew something was wrong. Whatever the reason, if she thought she had said enough about me previously, if she was angry at me, or just forgot me, I understand and I think that she must have reason. 

Steph, I just wanted to let you know that I am soooo sorry for anything I have done to hurt or bother you. I love you sooooo much and would never try to hurt you. Having said that, I have to say that life would not be as great as it is if it wasn't for you. Having you in my life has changed me... and ""I do believe I have been changed for the better."" All because of you. You are an amazing person and I don't know what I will do without next year. I'll be ""lost without you"", and I know, I'm quoting way too many songs. I know I'm a choir geek and I am proud to be one - again because of you. you are sooooooooooooo talented (notice all the o's - that stresses the fact:-), and I wish I could be more like you. Everyone loves you. You're Wendy and we're your lost boys. What can I say that I haven't already told you? 

Stephen, you're my brother! I have gotten to know you so well in such a short time it's amazing! I would not have been in swimming if it wasn't for you, and you helped me to feel like I belonged in lacrosse more. Thank you for dealing with my ""Freshman Ways"". You always happen to make a joke when everybody's not happy (Lacrosse), and I thank you for that. You have helped to make this year a little easier.

Miranda, you're such a nice person! I don't think that I have ever seen you really angry, even when I smacked your butt real hard! I think that if you do become a teacher, you will be an awesome one! Since I met you, I have only wanted to continue to know you better. You are a cool person. Why I had to wait until around Prom to really start talking to you and hanging out with you makes me angry, but I'm glad I did meet you.

Kate, you make me laugh! We may not always agree on politics, but you're a fun person to be around. You tell it like it is, and I respect that. I only wish I had gotten to know you more, since you're going to another state soon. I do admit I miss your butter churning a little bit :-) I wish you luck in whatever you do in life. 

Emmy, I am so glad I got to know you this year, even if it was at the end of the school year. You are a fun person, and your laugh is contagious! You are an extremely talented dancer, choreographer, artist, singer, and photographer! I look forward to seeing more Emmy's Angels performances, and I hope someday you'll teach me how to dance!

I know there have got to be people that I forgot, and if it was you, I'm sorry. These are the Seniors (or new THS Alumni) that are in my life now. I love you all and good luck in life!"

"event","Prom was freaking awesome!!! I had such a good time! It was so much fun going with Miranda. I danced with Stephanie like I promised. The after prom was freaking awesome too!!! I have so many buises and burns from the obstacle course, which I beat most people at. Don't deny it either. By the way, I let Stephen beat me at the bungey cord thing! I swear! That ship slide thingy was really tall... I also did flips in the moonwalk with Kendall. I was pissed that I couldn't stay at Doug's, but I still had a great time. I EVEN WON TWENTY DOLLARS TO GARFIELDS!!! Well, I g2g now. I have homework to do."

Today couldn't get any worse (well it could, but I'd be dead or in a prison with a gay guy).  Well, at least I have a lacrosse game today.  You all have to come!!!"

I have a lacrosse game today at 6:30 at Cyltec, which is across from Ten Pin Alley, and you all HAVE TO COME!!! It's going to be a good game."

"event","Hey guys. I'M SOOOOO STRESSED!!! I have two huge projects due. The one that's due Thurs. is probably going to be harder, and I haven't even started it.  I have an orthodontist appointment today and I haven't wore my retainer in forever.  My grades are shitty. Prom is Saturday (which I am also VERY excited about).  I can't plan anything for the summer until I find out about Children of Eden or Fiddler on the Roof. I have no money. I also have a small stain on my pants. OH! And to top it off my M GO BLUE FOR MOTT'S bracelet broke this morning. There's more, the other problem I have is that I forgot what my other problems were. 

I wrote some poetry last night. I might post it on here today or tomorrow. It's a bunch of quotes that I created, that might hopefully be famous some day (I did steal one from wephen stolfe, but it was too good to be forgotten). Someday I want to put them all together to music, because I love music, and that's just what I do with the poetry I write. I WILL BE A ROCK STAR SOMEDAY!!! Either that or I'll be on Broadway. Both ways, you guys can say that you knew me when I was a retarted freshman :-)

I had a pretty good weekend. I hung out with stephen on friday after lacrosse. Then Stephanie came over and that made things even better. After watching Toys, Stephen, Stephanie, and I went to Sal's and then to Gary's house, along with Colter and Emmy. We talked for a while and Gary said that he was going to burn me some CD's.  I thought that was pretty cool. The only problem that night is that I was late getting home ( Thanks, Stephen and Stephanie :-)

On Saturday I started my CAD project, which will be awesome! After that I went to Ann Arbor to see my cousin's play The Crucible. It was an awesome show! They have extremely talented actors and actresses at my cousin's school, and she was awesome too! A funny thing that happened was while I was walking to the restaurant that my family was going to eat at, we saw Edith drive by and asked if we could get a ride to the restaurant, and we slowed down traffic a bit while getting in and out, and I forgot to close the door after I got out.

On Sunday I played tennis with Nick LaGreca, which was fun. Then we went and got ice cream and walked over two and a half miles to my house! We hung out for a while, then Nick went home and I watched TV with my mom for the rest of the night.

Oh! I forgot to mention that on Saturday my parents told me that I could go to Prom!!!
Now I'm suddenly happy! I LOVE LIVE JOURNAL!"

-My hair is long
-Wait! I just got it trimmed...
-I want to write a song
-I think I need to go to bed

I LOVE ROCK, singing, theater, music, lacrosse, MUSIC, Cross Country, MUSIC, being crazy, SUGAR, MUSIC, Mountain Dew, Friends, writing MUSIC, playing guitar, and just being my crazy self.  

Well, some stuff going on in my life...  Oh yeah, I think I'm going to the Prom, because I was asked to go with Miranda (and yes, of course I have to have a dance with Stephanie).  I scored two goals and got two or three assists in lacrosse today.  OOOOHHHH!!! I almost forgot. I somehow managed to get my math homework done by doing an elaborate plan, which actually worked!!!  I just used a big word, which actually worked!!!"

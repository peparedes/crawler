"event","Whew! In hit eighty degrees today, eighty freaking degrees ya'll! That's crazy. It was beautiful. I was already exhausted with the consistent cold weather that had been inflicted upon the DC metropolitan area. I came home after chillin' with one of the homies, jumped in the shower, and the halter dress was on! It felt so nice to have the breeze rub so intimately against my mocha legs-- it was a seasonal orgasm, you just don't know.

The streets of downtown silver spring are beautiful. Spending my afternoon out, raping the weather of its aura-- truly a beautiful experience. I was almost sentimental, this was the first time in a long while in which I actually left the house just to become intimate with the weather. Mothers and their children, couples, friends....you know that spring is definitely in the air. Lord knows what tomorrow may bring, but whatever it does I pray the lord will allow me to revel in it like he allowed me to do today.

"event","If there is one thing I appreciate almost more than life itself is my space. I need space. The last couple of days have been clustered with phones ringing off the hook by males I truly wish not to talk to anymore. It's not that I don't wish to talk to them due to any particular action, but it is merely due to the fact that I have become uninterested. And no, it's not because I get bored easily, it's because I just can't find the room to tolerate certain habits.

Problem with Guy #1-- his voice. His voice used to sound extremely attractive to me, it had an inviting air of thug appeal, now, it just sounds like he's mumbling 1000 words per minute. Most of our conversations are consumed with inquisitive phrases such as ""huh?"" ""what?""...I just can't tolerate it. I find myself becoming more frustrated with 'ol dude as our conversations progress because I just can't understand him! I don't want to act rudimentary and pull the eighth-grade, Mr. dialtone move-- but it looks like it's coming down to that. I keep telling him that I'm busy, and I am no longer trying to pursue a relationship--not because of his voice, but also because of his character. He's always retorting to violence as a solution to all his problems and i'll be damned before I put myself in a situation to be physically abused.

Problem with Guy #2-- his tendencies to succumb to asshole-like character. I mean, when dude is in a bad mood he takes it out on the whole world. When I want to give him his space, Lord knows he needs it, he starts crying like a little sucker and gives me the ""no, baby, please, I need you..."" What the fuck? I'm so tired of it. He's 20 years old and crying like a 15 year old who just got rejected by his desired homecoming date. Wack ass simile, but the comparison is understood. I just lost my train of thought...but Guy #2 is wack too.

I'm probably being picky. Actually, I am not. I think I've just had an epiphany-- I've realized my worth. I don't deserve average, I deserve better than average. I don't know why I'm always coming across these drug-hustling millionaires who take me as some chick wishing to be their next ""baby momma."" Hell no! I have a future, I'm going somewhere. Lord, let me receive the light. I don't know...I just so tired of encountering falsified love..love that won't be shit...love that ain't worth shit..."

"event","I'm a very strong-minded individual and 85% of the time, this aspect of my being intimidates them.  But I've learned to accept my individuality and my mental endurance, it does not bother me any longer that males can't seem to understand the concept of being mentally and physically independent. As cliche as this shit may be, I hold my own. I don't want to inflict lecture upon anyone, but like I tell folks...we often criticize ourselves for being strong-minded rather than complimenting ourselves. I love my strength, my ability to endure, and my ability to visually dissect a person without their knowledge. These abilities/skills are a blessing because they have saved me from the snakes that hide in the unweeded garden of the world. I'm not prissy, I'm not conceited, cocky...and whatever falsified characteristic people tend to conflict with my independence. Where does my opinionated, strong-minded characteristics come from? Acceptance. The acceptance of who I am. 

Disrespect--- that's some shit I will not tolerate. Excuse my unecessary blurts of profanity here and there. I refuse to allow people to back talk me, attempt to degrade me, hell, even have the absurdity to embarass me. I'm often mistaken to be the subtle, nice one who is extremely tolerant. Well, I am tolerant, just not when it comes to people going out of there way to disrespect me. And moreso, I strongly dislike when caucasians feel the need to come at me and say the reason for my acceptance at Georgetown University(currently attend) and George Washington University (ill be there fall 2004) is because of the affirmative action law. NO! I was accepted because of my 3.85 GPA, the numerous advanced level courses I've taken throughout high school, my insatiable drive of becoming a medical doctor, my attitude, my political activism, and the list goes on and on. I'm not in school because some punk ass dude in the admissions office said -- ""hey, she's black, we need her in our school to promote diversity,"" no, I am here because I am a hard working woman who knows what the fuck she wants. People need to get a grip, if there is a personal problem you or anyone else has with affirmative action, take your ass down to capitol Hill and holla at your damn congressmen. Yes, lately, I have been putting people in their place, and if I wasn't putting them in their places at least they were not in my face..heh.

Go Terapins! Ok, so I do not attend University of Maryland, so what, those are my peeps and I'm glad they kicked the shit out of the Duke Blue Devils...that's what they get for doubting the red and white in the first place. You don't want none son! And once again, go Terapins for winning today against (insert team name here because I forgot)! Maryland is on the map again! Toodles."

"event","Ok, yes...I have officially abandoned my livejournal. I'm suprised my memory still maintained the password...moving right along.

I just wanted to say, I love the Lord. I love Jesus for the change he has brought upon my life. Most of the time when the Lord has done me so good, I tend to forget to take a minute just to thank him. Thank him for everything he has done. Thank him for wiping away my tears and giving me joy from my sorrows. I thank you jesus. 

I'm not on some religious escapade either. I tend to look back on my past and reflect on how much I have grown, how much I have changed. I have truly become a better person. Moving forward, become successful...making company with famous people such as Dorothy Heights and Donna Brasil. You just don't know, I know I'm becoming something in this society, and I thank the Lord for detaching me from those who served as nothing but venom in my life. Thanking the Lord for saving me from the ticks that masked themselves as my friends, sucking every inch of blood from me without my notice. I thank the Lord for giving me the strength. The strength to stay away, stay away from those who I once deemed as necessities in my life. I am independent, I am intelligent, I am successful, I am beautiful...and all praise goes onto the Lord. The Lord, the most supreme being in my life, the one of whom I adore...the one I maintain passion for. 

People try to hate...but it is only because I'm doing something right. The negativity...the drama...the anti-happiness gets zero play in my life. Those filled with envy and hate, I no longer retaliate...in fact, I pity you..and can only hope that you can some day find the spirit of the Lord within your hearts. Word."

"event","The Symposium at Howard University School of Law was one of the best experiences I have ever had in a long time. Guest speakers who attended the conference were Jesse Jackson Jr., Walter E. Fauntroy, and Betty Kilby Fisher. 

Jesse Jackson Jr. was the truth. He spoke on his intentions or proposal on a 28th amendment to our Constitution that would make it a right for every person to receive a free public education of equal high quality! Betty F.'s story was inspirational. It was captivating to hear a story of someone who went through the era of the implementation of the Brown decision. Her story inspired me even more to stay focused on my education, especially as an African American. The road and the struggle fought by African Americans in the past just so you and I could be the where we are today was not an easy one. I purchased Betty F.'s book-- Wit, Will, and Walls. The book is basically a autobiography of the struggles of her life and the determination of her father to ensure that his children received a quality education. Now, Walter E. Fauntroy is the truth! He broke it down, he suggested that on election day everyone voted for A.B.B (anybody but Bush)! For those of you who don't know, Walter E. Fauntroy was Martin Luther King's right hand man during the Civil Rights movement. He walked next to MLK during the ""Walk on Washington"" and he stood by him when they attended John F. Kennedy's funeral. The man is such an innovative speaker, I took a picture with him, once the film is developed I'll post it.

I received everyone's autograph. It was real, it was inspirational, it was the best learning experience ever. Although I agree on the idea that we still have a long way to go to fulfill the promises of Brown, but at least I can proudly say that we, as African Americans, have definitely made some progress."

He made me smile, he made me laugh, the sound of his voice sent chills down my spine. I cared about him, the thought of him alone was enough to caress my mind. I felt free with him, free enough to call him up and just cry because of the emotional stress I would temporarily endure. The realest friend for real, just wanted to see me, hug me, touch me, love me? Who knows...I will probably never know... I chased him away...my reluctance....my avoidance...my fear...it was just too much. Time doesn't wait for anyone, I guess the same rule applies to love as well. If I could start all over....I probably would....

<b>*Fastforward*</b>
At the time, he is here...in front of me. Visually I am blessed because the one true being that I could feel at one with is now here with me. To act now feels way too impulsive, but to act later may result in feelings of untimely regrets. His caramel complexion, his almond shaped eyes, the base in his voice...shit...I swear I'm having a mental orgasm. Shit seems so surreal...what I have been yearning after for so long is finally here, and I'm acting like a ""b"" word...I'm having an altercation with my emotional fears. <a href=""http://dirtydesigns.net/sensuous/myboo_a.jpg"" target=""new"">He's beautiful.</a>Damn, I think I'm falling..."

"event","Today, Today, Today...wow...today.

Realization is the most intriguing vibe in the world. Friday, I plan to attend the Brown vs. Board of Education Symposium at Howard University. Of course, they intend for me to speak at the event, so of course I have been online and in my history books trying to dig up something compelling about the Brown decision. My topic of discussion? The lack of fulfillment we as minorities have continuously had to face 50 years later.

It's amazing, 50 years ago Chief Justice, Earl Warren, declared that ""separate but equal"" was indeed unequal, basically overriding the decision made in the Plessy vs. Ferguson case. It was the landmark of the future to come for african americans worldwide. But today, I say that the fulfillment of the Brown Decision is lacking. Statistics show that blacks are among the top 10% of high school dropouts and are among the least likely to participate in higher education through attending higher level institutions. 

Things like this revive the sentiments of Marcus Garvey in his whole ""Back to Africa Movement."" It makes you wonder if things will ever improve for African Americans in this country? We as blacks have instilled over 300years of blood and tears on this American soil, and yet we still rock the bottom of the scale when it comes to ""success"" in this country. When will we rise...man...when will we rise?

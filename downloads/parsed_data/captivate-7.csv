"event","Today was one of those days were I missed my dad a lot. Certain things remind me of him, like today when I was driving down the road and saw a hard hat in the middle of the road, but there was no construction work for probably ten miles. When ever we would be in the car together we would play a game where every time you saw something completly random you had to point it out. We would see some of the craziest things sometimes.

I always wonder why bad things only happen to good people. It just doesn't seem to make sense. My dad was such a great guy. The man never smoked a day in his life and gets lung cancer, yet there's millions of healthy smokers out there...

I get to ditch the crutches Monday, thank God. I've had these things for almost a month.

Abby has a dance competition tomorrow, so I'll be there most of the day..."

"event","I had an acoustic night at Ritter's the other night and it was my first paying show. It was also the first time that it was just me. I figured at the end of the night Charlie would give me 50 bucks, maybe 100 if I was lucky, but as I was packing up my stuff he came up to me and said ""You did really well tonight, kid,"" and then handed me 400 bucks. I tried to give Ryan half but he said he'd rip it up if I tried. I did, in this order:

""If We Are the Body"" Casting Crowns
""Outside"" Ronnie Day 
""Understatement"" my song
""Not Forever"" my song
""Hands Down"" Dashboard
""This Time"" my song
""Vulnerable"" Secondhand Serenade
""Pretty When You're Drowning"" Ryan and Ben's song

Ryan played with me on ""Understatement"", ""Vulnerable"", and ""Pretty When You're Drowning""

That was the first time I ever played ""Not Forever"" for anyone that wasn't Abby, Ryan, Brandon, or Katie. I wrote it a few months ago when I was thinking about my dad a lot. The night before he died he and I were talking about how when people die everyone thinks that they're gone forever or that they'll never see them again, but it's not forever. I'm going to see my dad eventually. It's just not going to be for a long time, hopefully.

I can't believe that it will have been nine months on Friday. That was the worst Friday night of my life. That was the worst night of my life period, but I guess that's expected. I can honestly say that I wouldn't have gotten through it at all without my family, Abby, Ryan, and a few others. I'm closer now with my brothers than I ever have been. 

I still can't believe Brad's getting married in August, which is still weird to think about. Amanda... Amanda's great. She was just what Brad needed. She mellowed him down. Before her I swear I thought he was going to die of alcohol poisoning. Bright's kind of everywhere right now. He works like crazy and is never home. I don't know if he's going to go back to school in the fall. He's only got a couple semesters left, but I have a feeling he's not going to go back. I've been praying for him, that he figures out where he is in life.

I'm tired."

I finished my first year at UF with a 3.72 GPA, which was pretty exciting. I'm home for the summer and besides work, I'm free to spend the rest of my time with my family and Abby. I can't believe it's been over a year and a half for us...

I'm working at Ritter's which is really exciting. I bought my first guitar at Ritter's, so that's pretty cool. We played so many shows there, too. I'm probably going to be able to have a few nights on stage, too.

Brandon and I are coaching a County Rec football team. A bunch of hyper 11 and 12 year olds aren't really the easiest to deal with, but they're pretty cool kids. They like us and they're good players, so that's all that matters.

I'm going to try to not suck at updating this thing.

I won. 

I never would have thought I could do that. It was so awesome when they kept calling the list of eliminated things and they never called me. My playlist went like this;
Round one: ""Black Baloon"" Goo Goo Dolls on guitar
Round two: ""Chariot"" Gavin DaGraw on piano
Round three: ""Beyond Words"" Tenth Avenue North on guitar
Round four: ""Slide"" Goo Goo Dolls on guitar
Round five: ""Hands Down"" Dashboard Confessional on guitar

"event","2006 was certainly the most trying year of my life. After losing my dad in September, I didn't think that that we would ever get through. My biggest fear is not having control of my life, so when Dad got sick I didn't know what to do. It was like everything that I had been working for and everything that I had wasn't worth it.

No matter what I did and no matter how much a prayed, Dad wasn't getting any better. I guess I hid exactly what I was feeling because if I pretended that I was fine then everyone else might feel fine too.

I've learned a lot in the last year or two, and the most important thing by far is that your family is the most important thing you have. My family has always been pretty close, but I've never really appreciated them the way that I should have.

Besides football, Brad and I have never really lived the same kind of lifestyle. He's always been a big partier and I just haven't. Seeing how much Brad has matured in the last two years (he's getting married for God's sake) is remarkable. He really held us all together, and I didn't realize it until afer everything kind of died down.

After Bright couldn't play football anymore at USF, he kind of disappeared and hardly ever came home, but in the last year we've become incredibly close. He transfered to UCF and stayed at home. The majority of my nights before I left for Gainesville were spent with Bright. He's not as bad as I've always made him out to be, and I kind of feel guilty.

My mom is the most beautiful, strong woman in the world. I can't imagine the feelings that she has every day. Yeah, I lost him too, but they were together since they were in 10th grade. She is amazing, and I am so proud to be her son.

I have so much more to say right now, but I'm really tired, so I'll finish some other time."

Everyone hre is so edgy lately. You can tell it's finals week because everyone is so stressed and pressed for time. This morning I was in line for coffee (yes, I drank coffee. mark it on your calendar) and the girl at the counter was so rude to every customer she had. You could hear her mumbling something about stupid polital science test keeping her up until 3 in the morning.

I think I did really well on the ones I've had so far. I had one Monday, one today, and I have two tomorrow. I'll be home either Saturday or Sunday this weekend until January.

I'm really glad I came home this weekend. I've still got two more days, which is good. Thanksgiving wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. We had it at Brandon's and Brian carved the turkey and whatnot. We still had all the pies. Bright still ate the blueberry one, even though he's allergic. He puked for an hour afterwards, but he said it was worth it.

I said grace, and I didn't mean to, but I made my mom, aunt, and gradmother cry. So I guess I'm filling my dad's shoes, or something. Which, of course, is impossible, but it's a step or two up from moping around.

I missed him a lot yesterday. It was the first holiday without him, and it was pretty awkward at first. I think Brand really lightened the mood, though. He was full of jokes and whatnot. 

We must have been at Brandon's until two this morning playing cards. Ryan must cheat, or something, because he won at least ten rounds of poker. Brad was drunk so he lost every single hand. Bright was curled up in a ball dying because he's fat and ate blueberries. Alex was falling asleep because he had chased his brother around the house all day. Abby left at 1, but it was really good to spend time with her. I'm taking her out in a little while, because I feel like a bad boyfriend. Katie kept demandging we play spoons, which she did beat all of us in, and Brandon never stopped eating the whole day. From the time I got there in the morning he was eating and he ate throughout the whole day. He was even chewing on some beef jerkey when we were all playing football. I don't know how he's not as fat as a house.

So I guess over all, Thanksgiving With the Hartmans wasn't that bad. There was blackberry cobler, so I guess it made everything worth it."

"event","I didn't think it was possible to miss one person so much. With the holidays approaching, I'm realizing how much I'm dreading going home Wednesday for Thanksgiving. 

Thanksgiving was my dad's holiday. Christmas was always spent at Brandon's and Thanksgiving was always at our house. Dad loved everything about Thanksgiving. He loved carving the turkeys and having a piece of every kind of pie on the table. He made sure everyone said what they were thankful for before anyone even thought about touching their food, and he always said a grace that has put my grandmother to tears before because it was so honest and full of God.

For the first time in my life I don't feel like celebrating. I don't want to go home and I don't want to be around all of my family. As selfish as it sounds, I don't want to be around all the awkwardness and pity. I know I need to be there for my mom. Honestly, I think that's the only reason I'm going home. Brad has Amanda. Bright never seems to care. But mom... she doesn't have anyone. 

He was the only one she ever loved. They started dating when they were in 10th grade and were married for 26 years. They never broke up once. I know how bad his death has hurt me, but I can't imagine how she must feel.

Imagine being with the same person your whole life, then after 30 years it's all over. I don't know if that's a risk I'm willing to take, which is why I've really got to think long and hard about if Abby and I will still be together when I come back to school next Sunday.

I adore Abby- don't get me wrong. She's certainly been there for me this whole time and it would have been very hard to get through it all without her. We've been together since October 13, over a year, and I honestly do love her, which is why I don't know if I can really do it any more.

I don't want to risk losing her like my mom risked losing my dad..."

My dad was a great man and did so many wonderful things. As cliche as this sounds, and anyone who knows me knows that I believe cliches are dumb, he wouldn't have wanted us, and me specifically, to mourn. He would have wanted us to carry on and to have fun.

So that's exactly what I did today. After an hour long game of football with the people that I care about the most, and my dad cared about the most, my brothers and I sat out in the back yard. None of us said anything for what seemed like forever until Brad finally broke the silence. He said ""I know I haven't been around much the last year, but I promise you guys, even though we live in three different places, I'm going to be there for both of you. I'm promising you this right now. I <i>will</i> be there.""

Family is what keeps me going, and I'm so thankful to have brothers like Brad and Bright, a mother like mine, and even more family to be so supportive.

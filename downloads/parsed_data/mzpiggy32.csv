"event","Well,I didn't have to go to school today...so that was a relief.  Work, I had a lot to do...which was good for me, cuz then I didn't have to be sittin around doing nothing.  At least I didn't have to work at Bebe tonite.  Anyway...after work, Jonathan kept me company while I did errands. I got my nails done, I did groceries, I dropped off some film which is ready...whoo hoo.  We ate at my house and watched a movie.  Tomorrow I gotta buy some black pants and a present for my mom.  I also gotta stop by the Dry Cleaners and drop off some clothes.  Just a mental note for myself.

Lately I've been thinkin about Dani...I miss her alot.  I'm just wonderin how she's doing?  Where she's workin?  How her babygirl is? How Ryan is?  When I'm ready, maybe one day I'l give her a ring.  My manager Judy told me to just do it. And see if she invites what happened that nite into the conversation....and to just ""talk about it"".  We'll see.

I can't wait for summer to get here!  I need to get in my bathing suits, and lay at the beach!"

"event","Well, really, I'm supposed to be at the mall right now with my boo...but my mom called because of some sort of emergency...and Jonathan and I got into a little misfit so I told him to go by himself.  Shit, and I'm looking all cute.  Oh well....

Today was kind of a weird day, not everything was going as planned.  See, first, I wanted to make an album of the Colorado trip on my computer for my brother and his wife.  I spent a long time scanning these pictures.  I worked on my album.  I thought I saved it....apparently, I didn't.  OHHHHHH GOSH I wanted to shoot myself.  Then, I was bored, had nothing to do...relaxed, watched some TV...and decided to go online.  Finally when I had something to do, my mom comes home!  Yelling here, yelling there: ""Do this, do that....all day here....bathroom dirty!  Carpet gross! Polvo here, polvo there!""   grrrrr.  Well, at least she was kind enough to lend me money so I can start Xmas shopping since I do not get paid until Xmas Eve. FINALLY she left.  Then I took my kitty to get her stitches off.  That turned out well.  Came home, read Jonathan's email, which said:

BAby Ive been trying to call u don't pick up, I want to go pembroke today are u still going to work? Give me a call later to go with me!

So I called him back.  Mr.Working Man was freakin grumpy.  Well, I gave him a break and decided to get ready.  Now I'm ready, and just when I was about to leave...Mom called.  After I learned that I had to stay home, I really wish I hadn't picked up...................Oh shit, my mom's here!!!! I can go, I can go!!!! Sorry to cut it like, but I'm going shopping!"

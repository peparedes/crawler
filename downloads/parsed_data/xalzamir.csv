and anyone that knows my veiws on x would know why i have choosen to leave that in its once a month useage catagory.

but now i can say that i'm a
ex-stoner-pot
ex-tweaker-meth
ex-coke head-coke
ex-space cadet- disasociatives-nitrous,ketamine, dxm, and pcp.

thankfully my own personal veiws on opiates, aka, i fuckign love opiates. has kept me from every touching heroin, so i can happily say that i am not an ex-smack kiddie.

lol unfortunatly, the worse of all drugs is still a plague to me. aka tobacco.

lol i even quit alcohol. o.0.

lol still kandy kid, but then again, it's better than being a tweaker or a coke head.

hallucinagens were never too big for me so that is why they are not among the list above.

the one downside to this is that i honestly fully expect to relaspe at some piont. i rather dislike reality. :(
but untill that faithful day, soberity is actually more entertaining lol

still here bitchs, :)

<lj-cut text=""random medical shit"">
and if i go in for the adhd, they will eithre put me on wellbutrin, or meth. welbutrin is a MRI-multiple reuptake inhibitor. which would screw around with my seratonin and my  Norepinephrine. which i already know are balenced. which would make me a rather unpleasent person to be around. and while meth would fix my dopamine imbalance, daily dosing of meth scares the shit out of me. and i'm sorry possible addiction to that is not what i want. there is a 3rd choice-Cylert (pemoline). which had been discontinued due to almost certian liver failure. so i think it's best for me to live with the adhd.
</lj-cut>

and now there is the sad relizations that i have come too...

<lj-cut text=""*sigh*"">
now i love my friends dearly. and always will. but even in my delusional,sometimes self-destructive, and highly unconventional approach to my problems. I've had a clear cut goal. to become the person i need to be. No more no less. now not everything i've done is a step to that goal, but most are. and to make it worse i've known exactly what i was doing for the last 9 months. and everyday i look in the mirror and make sure i'm still on that path. but when i look at what it is that i will end up as. be it in 3 days or 3 years. one thing remains the same. the person i will end up as. will not be accepted by my old friends. because who I was and who i will become are 2 completely different people. with only the smile and the good nature remaining the same. nothing else will be accepted. so to spare myself alot of pain, and to spare everyone else from the overwhleming resentment i have for their *tough love*. it's time for me to move on and out. it was nice to have my best friends and inner circle within 1 group and they themselves be connected to each other. it's not worth the pain that this *tough love* inflicts. i've been working hard to make alot of new friends, and while not all of them are as good as the old ones. a select few are better than the old ones. so it all balences out in the end. it's been a wonderful 4 years but all things must come to and end. this only really applies to my best friend and my inner circle friends-minus 3 who i know will accept who i will become. :-) no names. now yes i know some people will say that it wont fix anything, and i'll just hurt the new people as well. well, considering the only things that cause any amount of emotional pain, that makes me want to run is this group of friends. and i don't have to worry about what so many of them think as they have given me the time to reshape myself and have accepted me everystep of the way. I don't have the established bonds i have with so many now with them so, that keeps me from hurting them. so why go thru chemo-teraphy for a non-malignant tumor that can just be cut out? why should i cause even more damage to my emotions and my body, when i can just leave it behind me? people i consider on the outsides of that inner circle this does not apply to either, but I want as few direct ties to the group as possible. if anyone is still confused as to who this applies to, wait a bit, i'll find and talk to you. :-)

and last is a inside joke for mary.

<lj-cut text=""vampires"">
something i remembered about the status traits in vampire. is that unless they are world wide. they do not follow you from city to city. so this untrustworthy trait i have with ya'll, no longer festers when i leave. and get new friends. :-)

"event","we all know the 2 main ones, regret adn relief.

but what about all the others, i am here today to discuss the other r's that have invaded my life. the other r's are, remorse, resentment, realizations, rememberence, and rage.

let's start with remorse.

remorse- over the past year, for a long time i was haunted by losing friends, and relizing my worst nightmare hundreds of times-losing friends-, and al though, i can see why and what, happened now, it still hurts sometimes.

resentment-i have begun to resent all my old friends and myself, for the event of the past year. i resent them for as my memory slowly returns, i see what so many did, to me. and i resent myself for the lies, the insecurity, and of course the replacement of the old friends, and the folly of it all.


relizations- as i am someone with only time to spend, as i have no job, and now no car. i get to think alot, the isolations is such a wonderful tool sometimes. i knwo now that i am begining to open myself up again to the world. open it up to people again. somethign i said to my buddy patrick. i had only known this man for 24 hours, when i looked at him, smiled and told him i trust him. he opened himself up to me and told me bout his life. trusted me to protect adn babysit his girlfriend. at faire, when we were all fucked up. and i am nwo openign my self up slowly to my havok friends. i'd liek to start openign up to my old friends again, but the problem lies in just as they have seen my dark side, i've seen their's too, so i'm rather aperhensive about reachign out to them now, jsut as most are to me. in the end, 
<b>you cannot be trustworthy until you are willign to trust</b>
and that is the relization i have made over time.

rememberence- as stated befoer slowly my memories are beginign to return. while in other aspects they are fading. i am remembering many things about other people, includign things i forgot on purpose, but for now i'm mostly just confused :-)


rage- the last r that has invaded myslef, comes from, the rumor mills, and the repeated use fo the phrase-i miss the old jonnie-  at this piont the rumors have died away, thankfully, but for the subject of the old jonnie. there is no old jonnie or new jonnie.  i am and will alwasy be that overly cheerful asshole that alwasy greets you with a smile and a hug. 


it's insterentign that in this entire time i have never felt, regret or  relief.

final quote, 

<b> Sometimes the hardest choice is the right choice</b>

and her is the scary color quiz thingy.

I think its because gods have eternality and humans have only today. And so why should we forgive sins if we wont be here tomarrow? As humans we are naturally selfish, so why forgive when we may not even live to reap the rewards of forgiveness. In advent children, cloud asks he sins can be forgiven? Vincent reply with ive never tested it. When i think bout this i wonder the same thing can a sin be forgiven? And he so what must be done? For my own state of mind i am willing to do anything my life and my health are no longer bearable with the weight of sins and mistakes. Even if some are due to external forces it is still my burden to bear.

what his means is that, i figured out how to stop worring over he people lost.

in he end, i just needed closure from them. and after thinkgn about it, they already gave it.

so, with that knowledge i finally stoped worrign about them an tryign to change their minds. 

i mean why worrry ABOUT PEOPLE that make it apparently clear they don't give a flying fuck about you.

*note* i said worry bout,i still care about these people and would do anything for them. which knowing my luck, they'll just end up usign me like so many before them.  but cest'la'vie. not like i care, meebign used lets em know that the person is doing ok in their life.

but with that large amount fo stress off my shoulders, 

i can move on to more recent problems. and someone i hae recently learned to care about.

that is all.

lol oh yeah, mr.anon, lol it' clear you don't know me and whoever directed you to my journal, must have not mentioned that insults and similar attacks, tend to make me smile :-) but your welcome to add my lj and make your posts as a *friend* and not as an anon :-)it takes alot to anger me, but not alot tohurt me emotionally, your not in the position to do either so, :-), just add me,lol talk some sense into me when i'm beign retared :-)  i don' mind, infact i listen rather well, as long as what yur pedelling sn't against my personal morals. i'll just ignore it if it is. :-D, but i do listen to people, and contemplate what they say. best i can offer is that i'll listen, hell,i'll evenhelpou wih your own problems if you want :-)


thank you to all that have suffered thru my retared stages, adn i ask you to bear with me thru this one, as i've fianlly figured out what i didn't deal with. adn  now that i know,i've got another project. :-)"

bu when ou say it to them, directly so they know it's you, it takes courage and willpower.

if i turly know something about someone, i'll say it to their face, ifi don't then i'll often hold it till i know.

cowardice to me is refusing to say/do something to/for, the sake of another, for what ever reason.

a lovely anon post on m journal,
basicly telling me to stopbeign a coward and kill myself.

now i found this raher entertaining. simple cuz it's a reason to live.

aka, my very exsistance is a plague to someone, lol, what other reason to be than vengence. :-)
while yes living for others is noble, vengence is more fun. :-),

ok and ya know maybe i am a cowardwhen it comes to that. but i's hard enough to overcome someone else's will to live, let alone your own.

so i urge you mr/miss.anon if i'm such a coward do it yourself, and prove me right. :-)"

We were made in the image of god but we lack divine spark making us capable of mistakes and imperfect. The few out there with this spark are unsure of how to use it which leads to more mistakes and eventually suicide. Constatine said it best you think your crazy long enough and you try to escape. Me personal i have been so caught up in my own mind that i have forgotten my true gifts. Over half way to true enlightenment and i get derailed and have to start 3 steps back with no direction this time except a broken trail of mistakes to teach me and haunt me until i find a way to overcome my uber healing and immune system people are not meant to heal a quarter inch deep gash in 30 minutes or have a major vein heal shut with less than a trickle of blood or be immune to some of the most dangerous disease short of cancer but enough of that. A path of mistakes is all i have until i can forge the right path. Broken friends with no way to repent. My own personal curse has become more than i can bear i an here to help people not hurt them"

"event","when a promise is made, and one of the parties involved stops carring, doesd the promise mean anything?

ano obvious answer is No it doesn't, well unless your me, promises have always outlasted the people. o.0


but on to the subject of this post.

Once again my emotions have taken me somewhere dark and unhealthy.

but so much makes sense now, 

the term* if life is so bad, death must be a paradise*, i've found to be rather incorrect.

their is an inherent joy in living, which is unmatched. while their is a simple un distrubed peace in death.
the down sides to this is that to live is to be in constant pain, while in death their is no pain.

the pain of living is amplified by emotions and the human ability to care. to care about anythign is to invite that pain into yourself.
the more we care the greater the possible pain. 
now 2 thigns. 

1.physical reason to be a cutter- the body nturally drowns out mental adn emotional pain when physical pain is done.
2.-i finally understand the emotionless sluts and truly apathetic.- by removing emotions from the equation of life, you cannot take another pain into your own life. thus making everything that much easier on you.

and now for that broken vow.

i fell deep enough last night to turn the blade on myself again. dispite the vow never to do that again.  unfortunatly, i did nt know the level of emotional pain until after i did. 
a quater inch deep  gash in my arm adn i felt nothing at all. their was no pain, the emotional pain over rode my physical pain, i cut twice in 2 places, to see if it was just a fluke, and niether had any pain. they bled but not pain, nothing. thus confirming that the emotions that were present where genuine and in some case epic in porportion.

as a testement to my body i watched this deep gash in my arm close and seal up in 30 minutes, a cut that should have requires stitches will be nothign more than a dark scar. in a few days.

but i've lear that if you care deeply enough nothing will override that. not even pyshical pain. '
armed with this new knowledge i'm thinkign about goign back to the emotionless phase now that i understand more of it.

<lj-cut text='a poem written a while back'>

this poem was written for a number of old reason but some continue to haunt me now. 

in my travels,
in my times
i've done things
i've meant little.

but i've always been there.
no matter what or where.
and now i'm lost,
a love nothign but a ghost.

the dried tears still
stain my face.
the feel of her lips
still a lingering grace.
unknown if i'll ever
know that again
the broken dreams
have long began.

a broken spiral,
all i have left.
to a time where
happiness rained from
the sky, and things were
simple and not shattered.

i long to run from this
cold emptiness that
has come about.
a place alone and broken.

and return to a place
of warmth adn love.
but hte road is too
long to walk or run.
and i worry my pride
will not survive the
journey.but it is
somethign that must
be done, to rturn to a
place in her arms.
so far away from
a long cold emptinesss
that is alone."

time flows like a river and history repeats.

a TRUE hopeles romantic, is NEVER broken/missing pieces, 

none of this bullshit people play off,

a hopless romantic knows what they want, at all times.

they know the means and actions of love an hate. and never use the words out of context.

a hopeless romantic rarely heart broken, heart pains, and nightmares are common, but never heart broken.

they look for new ans more inventive ways to be romantic,

and now the EMO POSERS!.
*edit*
terms like* i'm broken* and *i don't know what i want"" are common place for a romantic poser.

love and hate are said like they mean nothign at all.

every person is a broken heart waiting ot happen.

they only knwo a few ways to be romantic, 8mainly the ways you get off of google.*


so as one of the last last remaining true hopeless romantic's, i'd like to say

i love animals, which of course leads to love poeple as well. as people are nothing more than intelligent animals.
but when i was 6 or 8 years old we had a mouse problem in my house. and my mom caught a mouse between the door of our store room and the floor, 
she called me over and forced me to take a brom handle and jab it down and crush the mouse's skull. now i naturally cannot hurt an animal.
but being that age, i did so anyway, and i remember throwing up an crying imediatly afterwards. since that day I never be able hurt an animal or a person. *which of couse got the shit kicked out of me ona daily basis.*

the only person i've ever been able to hurt pyshically was myself, but that stems from an extreme self loathing, and utter conious disregard for self preservation.

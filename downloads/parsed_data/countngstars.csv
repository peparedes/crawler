the other day i looked at the calendar and there was 44 days left of school.
now i look- 19... 
tell me that isnt crazy?!?

any who..
i am finally enjoying highschool. 
grad bash was awesome! I mean.. yea, I had bad luck, because a lot of things happened to me, and no one else. lol.. but other than that, i enjoyed it. 

i have gotten extremely close to those that make my last days of high school rock! and i love it. 

i look back and laugh.. because all the shit and drama that cause stress upon your life is something you'll forget once you graduate. 

ten years from now, what do you think you'll remember most?

not all the drama... 
but all of the smiles, and laughs you have spent with your closest friends. 

you might not remember what you wore, or your friends names (although that sounds harsh), but you will remember you had a blast when you were with them. 

at one point in my life i thought <b>SMSH = DRAMA</b><br>but now... <b>SMSH = LOVE</b>"

tomorrow-school. blah. 

some random, anonymous person comments to my last entry. so they begin to ""put me into place"" by talking about my articles in the newspaper for the school. If I have insulted you in any way, about your fashion and/or style, MY APOLOGIES. Did not mean to hurt your feelings about what I thought. Half of the things I wrote were from actual designers, and opinions from other people. 

Any who...see you all in school tomorrow. Night"

"event","I had so much fun last night. I had to work a party for my mom and I ended up acting like I attended the party rather than working it. My uncle was the bartender and he hooked us up with so many drinks. My favorite were the Apple Martinis and the Liquid Cocaine Shots. 

Good News is I made $220 in one night. How cool is that?!

I went to sleep at like 5:30 AM, and woke up at 9:45 AM... lol-that was funny. I felt like throwing up, but I was still kind of out of it. What Ever. I never drink, so when I do I get bad as hell. My Tia was hilarious she had to pee and she didnt want to go to the bathroom, she almost peed her pants! hahaha


well Happy New Years Everyone! Hope you had FUN!"

"event","it is so funny how ppl dont talk to me during the school day and then when they have no one to talk to afterschool they act like you're their bestfriend...


it is time for people to grow up... you are already 17 and 18 years old, just because i dotn feel like talking to you sometimes is my problem not yours... and when you have to act childish and ignore me makes you look stupid not me...



i am now hanging out with a different group of people during lunch, the ones who dont think theyre better than anyone else, and the ones who you can act like yourself and and you wont be lonely with.... makes me feel so much better to get this out of me....

[edit] 
i myself am in my first real relationship with a guy named gio, who is immature, annoying, and has problems, yet very humorous, caring, intelligent, and has a strong personallity... if you could find someone and accept every part of him then you found the ""one""  .... right? or just maybe mr. right now.. but really that is all i want at the moment-- i dont want to look at the future, make plans, or have hopes and dreams... i just want to live day after day wondering whats going to happen next... 


i dont plan on having someone write my life story-i want it to happen by itself, like me typing this lj update

that's how i think a person should live their life."

wow--- i am on a role on being a happy camper!!! i havent had a real smile on my face for so long, but for the past 2 weeks it's been all me babY!!! 


i dont even know why i am like this--i think i have changed a lot... i used to be kinda dependant on friends, and now that i know no one is a true friend, i just act like w/e with them.. if they want to spend all the time in the world with their b/f and then spend time with me i dont give a shit... i'll still talk to them.

if they want to act like idiots one day and then the next day come to me like it's all good-i wouldnt give a shit. 


GOOD NEWS... gio is graduating this friday from fire academy... im so happy!!!!

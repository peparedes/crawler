"event","I look forward to using my blog as a personal journal for my friends and family to read. In college it is difficult to stay in touch and daily talk to my friends who are scattered across the country attending different schools. I enjoy  writing about daily activities inside and outside of school so that I as well as my friends can recall the fun things I have done and learned in school. I am able to look back on all the fun and interesting new things I have done. I will use my blog as a diary so that I have a restricted space where I can express my thoughts to those I am closest to. It is also fun to view other people's blogs and learn about them. By using a blog like livejournal which many students have, I am able to interact and communicate with my friends through reading about their own lives."

"event","I have powershot s200 digital elf and I use it to take pictures all the time. It goes everywhere with me and I am always finding pretty places and funny moments where I use my camera. I normally plug my camera into my tv and let everyone see all the pictures I have taken and sometimes I even make short videos with it. I have downloaded some of my pictures to my computer so that all my friends and family can view them as well."

"event","I learned a lot from Mr. Donald's discussion about bloglines and rss feeds. I learned that bloglines really are an easy way to search for things over the internet. I selected tennis and i found many websites that were helpful and specific enough to meet my request. It was also really simple to save the website and check for updates. Bloglines are unique ways to find news articles through weblogs as well as through RSS. Once your register a username there is easy access to thousands of useful news sites. The site enables its users to have a list of feeds or sites that one frequently visits. Once you are a user you should definitely take advantage of the many extras on the websites such as bookmarks, email subscriptions and much more."

"event","Power Point presentations most often are for the use of presenting a group of information to a class. The format common for these presentation is inputting bullet points containing broad topics and themes that guide and organize a group's speaking. It is easier to see colors on a power point that are compatible with one another and it is often better to include a few key images or photos that are visually appealing to the audience."

"event","Through the power point and the websites I found out easier ways to narrow or broaden my searches by using the tools from various search engines along with search directories. With google's more options, I can input keywords I need for my search and omit certain words I do not need as part of my search. Also I learned that the campus library has a variety of search engines that can help me find information for my classes which is helpful because it is a more efficient and accurate engines to use rather than a very broad engines like google or yahoo. I also learned how to put my search into different languages, placing parentheses around certain words, minus signs, etc. in order to make my search more specific."

"event","I learned from yesterday's class that once something is written in a tangible form it is automatically considered copyrighted. Also I learned that it is difficult to prove that someone stole one's work because it is one person's word against another person's word. Also I learned that participation in music, movie, or game file-sharing does not count as a form of plagiarism because that person has not stated that it is his/her work but he/she are simply borrowing that work. Overall I got a better understanding about author's rights and the responsible use of one's work."

"event","I have a dell 8600. I have Microsoft Antivirus and Symantic Antivirus. I am constantly updating both of these programs to ensure that I do not get any viruses, Trojan horses, etc. on my computer. My computer is normally pretty fast but recently it has not been opening programs as quickly. I am thinking about deleting documents I do not need and stop downloading programs that take up a lot of memory on my computer."

"event","so yeah I have a boyfriend now.. since of Saturday.. he was waiting for me to ask him out for the longest time but I had to make sure I wanted to.. so I finally made my decision and it was ""yes"" His name is Chris.. he's 15 but in 8th grade.. (what happened there?) whatever doesnt matter.. first off he got held back and I dunno about the extra year..
well most 15 year olds are in 9th grade but anyways.. I love being with him.. we laugh alot .. get into marrage like arguements.. and were always fine with eachother.. to me.. at this moment hes not the best looking thing in the world but hes amazingly kewl.. and I love him.. after 4 weeks.. im not in-love with him.. and yes.. sex is great.. Im happy to be with him.. wish us luck  ^_^"

"event","Well....HAPPY BIRTHDAY JULIO!

Today was great i'm glad that everything that they planned worked and i'm glad that i was part of it. You really have no idea how GREAT it is too have friends like these. i think julio couldn't put it any other way. It's good to have friends that u could be STUPID with and they won't think ur retarded, they'll love u for it.

For me i thought that the transition would be really tough for me...i know that it has been 2 yrs i'm here...but without the box in the beginning(although we weren't really the box yet) i don't know what i would have done/become. I think that i might not have been how i am now. so THANKS GUYS....u've kept me sane it's good to know that i could vent on one of u guys. i know that i'm rambling but what julio said really got me thinking how lucky all of us really are.
 
So...thanks guys for being my friend....and if u get like annoyed at me or anything...or u don't consider me a friend...i consider u one so thanks anyway.

BYE GUYS!!....i can't believe constantine is GONE....I REALLY WANT SCOTT TO GO. JUS TO CHANGE THE MOOD I'M FEELING!!"

"event","well trini was REALLY good...i don't know what to write so i'm going to write this poem here that someone gave me.....:) it's by Laurieann Kelly

Sometimes in life,
you find a special friend:
someone who changes your life
by being a part of it.
Someone who makes you laugh 
until you can't stop; 
someone who makes you
believe that there really
is good in the world.
This is forever friendship.
When you're down,
and the world seems dark
and empty,
your forever friend lifts
you up in spirit
and makes that dark
and empty world suddenly
seem bright and full.
If you find such a friend,
you feel happy and complete.
You have a forever friend
for life."

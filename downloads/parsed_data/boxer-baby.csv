"event","today i slept til 12:30...lol not unusal, then went out with my mom shopping, that was okay...ended up finally breaking down and talking to her, hadnt thought i could before...still kinda depressed but im a lil better now that ive talked to her about everything..then we went to target and got the new shadows fall cd, lol took me awhile, really wanted the green day cd, but they didnt have it..kinda pissed but oh well, ill try best buy i guess and then went to the taunton mall and returned some clothes at old navy but they wouldnt give me the money and i really dont like that store so my mom used the card and is going to give me the money so thats sweet...went to hot topic, lol i'd forgotten how much i love that store, found the cutest skirt, jeans and t-shirt (the shirt says im not with stupid anymore, lol i LOVE it) going back tomorrow to get them along with some other stuff from there and prolly american eagle and hollister, lol what a combination...its all good tho...im sooo excited to be going back to school on sunday, i cant wait to go back and see all my friends, i miss everyone soooooo much!! im really just hoping that it will take my mind off of everything thats causing me to be depressed cause ill be away from it and ill be with my friends that love me lol and will keep my mind off of ""it"" tomorrow im goin out with my mom again, gonna go get that stuff from hot topic, maybe then go down to the north attleboro mall so that should be fun, but for now, im going to sleep cause im wicked tired! goodnight!"

"event","Well today was my birthday party with my family because i wont see most of them before i leave for school on the 23rd. got some cool stuff, also got to watch the eagles kick ass lol...of course!!!!! after that kristy and i went to her grandmothers house for a bit to see how the weather was going to be, then when to TGIFridays to watch the Pats kick some serious ass!!!! lol GO PATRIOTS! gotta love 'em! super bowl here we come lol it was a great time...esp kristys lil surprise lol (sry hun, i know you hate surprises, but come on, you know this one was great!) know im sitting at home, talking to people, kinda upset about a few things...but i'll be okay, always okay...pretty much cant wait to get back to fpc, though i dont want to leave kristy lol she just got here!!!!! but then, maybe up there with everyone and everything to keep me occupied and distracted, the pain will go away, although i suppose, sometimes pain never goes away so who knows...god, now im sounding way to emo...but ya know what, someone ask me if i fuckin care...i honestly just want to get through the next few weeks w/out totally breaking down...possibly the next few months....

 ... I know what it's like when memories make you wince, and love letters read like obituaries, and photo albums are the books of the dead, I need no reminders, no more reminders, I'll forget the past and lay it to rest, if I had my way, I'd cut the calluses, off your breaking heart, if I could get past the sternum, cauterize those wounds with, every kiss I could give to you, I'm holding your heart in my hands, the reason it still beats, am I being too cryptic? am I being too obscure? am I being too cryptic? am I being too obscure? love kills, romance is dead, and I don't even trust myself, but I love you, and you can pull my wings apart, and pin me down under glass, until the end of days if it can help you, discover that we share the same pain, I just hope you write your thesis, before your subject is dead, no life after death ..."

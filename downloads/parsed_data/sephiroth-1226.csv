"event","Hmm.  I just feel...empty, as the title would so imply.  Do I miss her?  Not in the least.  What I miss is the feeling.  I am by no means desperate, I have plenty of time to wait.  By fact, I have already convinced myself I will die alone, so oh well.  What I miss most is coming home from work knowing i'd get to see them.  Falling asleep with them on your mind.  Feeling whole when I think about them.  Im sure it sounds terrible, but its true. In reality, i've only missed two, the last not one.  Camping is coming up.  Base jumping, which = jumping off a cliff into water.  Knives, fire, pandamonium.  Eric comes, Andrew leaves.  So it truly begins.  Time to grow up kids."

I dont know why, or how for that matter, a dream has rattled me so badly.  Thank you to Jill for listening to it.  At this point, I dont know what to think.  As I woke up, it was like coming out of a pool, gasping for breath.  *Sigh*  Who knows...



Windmill, Windmill for the land 
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sinking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

"event","So last night, well, this morning rather, we're sitting around at Kate's telling stories.  Stephanie then asks me if I have ever done anything good or worth while in my life.  I had nothing.  Have I really done nothing at all in life to benefit people but me?  Now don't get me wrong, I am by no means looking for pitty, for as most of you know I despise it, but it just really hit me hard.  I don't know why.  We set a date for camping, so that will be fun.  TGIL had her birthday party the other day which she claims I was invited to, but I know for a fact that I was not.  The party was talked about only a few times and I was never told a date or time OR invited.  I would remember if she did, seeing as how I idiodicly hang on her every waking word as though it were the very bane of life itself.  Oh well, not like i've ever done anything to deserve love anyways. =P  Wow, i'm very tired, and have work in a few hours.  Night.

"event","Wow.  Where to start...

                Well, we'll start with Saturday.  I worked until 6, then picked up Will and Kate.  I then went to Jade's grad party.  Why?  No idea.  But when we got there, I was ignorred for the 15 minutes we were there, no eyecontact was made, and it was just all out awkward.  Oh well.  I went, so no what-ifs I suppose.  We then went to Christi's and played with fireworks.  I was lucky enough to burn myself multiple times.  We also made a torch out of my socks.  After that, we went to I-Hop, and end night.  
                Yesterday, Sunday, was graduation day.  Worked early, then off to Bradford for the ceremony.  Spent 2.5 hours sweating my ass of for a diploma.  As I ran outside to freedom and coolness, there was TGIL (The girl I like) I walk up to her and say hi, next thing i know shes crying in my arms and im wiping her tears.  We agreed to do something later that night.  Well, as fate would have it, she managed to read my lj, and yelled at me for never telling her this stuff, even though her feelings were not in fact mutual.  So, we went to a hill, looked at the clouds and watched the sunset, and rolled down it.  All that time I just wanted to put my arms around her and hold her.  I am a fucking idiot.  She likes another guy.  But why cant i just fucking move on?"

A far greater anger then what i've been known to encounter.  And hate.  So much hate.  So much anger.  They make me strong, but destroy me when I don't use them.  This isn't natural.  It can't be.  I hae no reason for so much hate.  So much anger.  But what else is left when your heart is bled dry?"

"event","Well, again, I haven't updated in a while, but I feel now would be a good time to.  Why?  I'm not overly sure, but oh well, we'll see what happens.

     I wrote Jade a letter, and now we are talking again.  Good?  We'll see.  Hopefully.  So far, awkward to me, and of course the sadness is still overwhelming, but oh well.  I promised i'd be there for her, and I will.

     On to other recent things, last night I had a dream that I was back in the ward.  It was truly horrible, the worst dream I have ever had.  I woke up nearly in tears, a cold sweat pouring over me.  Later, I went to school where we went to Kemper Center to lead Peer Mediation Training.  Will and I were in charge.  We basiclly train people to slove fights.  It was fun, but I don't know, i've just been in a rough mood lately.  Somewhere between sad and angry.

     Saw Star Wars.  Loved it.  


                          Warning: Spoilers ahead!! 



     Well, I'll tell you the things that worked.  First off, Hayden actually worked for me in this one.  Don't know why, but he did.  Sure, there were a few awkward parts with him and Padme, but damn, he was evil AND cocky.  Every battle scene ruled with the acception of Grievous's, but we'll get to that later.  Finally, the score was amazing.  Can't beat it.

     Now thw Cons.  First off, Grievous died way too easily.  Second, wookies DO NOT sound like tarzan.  Order 66?  COP OUT.  Vader was supposed to go hunt down every jedi one by one, but no, he didn't.  Finally, no Qui-Gon.  Only his name, but no Qui-Gon.  *Sigh*  Oh well.

     Thats it for now.  Out."

Well, lately i've just been hanging around with my friends, and of course living by Jade's philosophy: No regrets.  God bless her.  Anyways, I would first like to appalogize to ""the rat"" who was mentioned in an earlier post.  Fact is what they did was justified and, reall, I just miss talking to them.  Moving on, today was good until, well, I don't really know how to put it, but it just sucked.  Something someone said and a certain situation.  IM me if you want to know.  And finally, to close the post, i'm angry.  I am very, very angry, and I don't know why.  The past few days it's been pouring through me.  Hate, mallice, rage, violence.  I don't know what to make of it.  Well, thats all for now. 3 days untill I line up for Star Wars and 4 days until I see it!  I'll putting in a post the night after with pros/cons/spoilers/etc.  Until then, look around you and realize what you have.  Live every day like it was your last.  No regrets."

"event","Well, it's been a rouch few days.  Lets start with Tuesday.  I come home from school, still with a mild cold.  Well, at about 4 I get a hold of Kate and we go to her house to set up for the party.  After we're set, we go pick up Eric and Andrew.  Then we pick up Will.  We then go to Salvation Army where Eric gets a matching vest for his pirate suit hes wearing and Will gets an old 70's biker jacket after trying to haggle with the crazy old Mexican cashier.  Then it's off to Game crazy where we buy 3 NES games: Something Muppets, Pac-man, and Dr. Mario. Shaping up to be a pretty good day so far, until Kate's mom calls her cell.  Well, somebody decided to put their nose where it doesn't belong and call Kate's mom and told her we were going to, and I quote, ""wrestle and break the house.""  So now Kate's mom is mad, we're mad at the backstabbing rat who called her mom, and Kate is now upset, so naturally we're all now upset.
     Well, we end up going over to Kate's anyways.  We hang out in her basement for a while, then decide to go crash Mike's party.  Well, we get there after trying to tell Kate we don't want to go, only for her to run like a chicken with its head cut off.  For those of you who haven't guessed she likes this guy.  So, here we are, all talking to him at his door.  Why?  Because theres no party till later!  So Kate, who drove my car there, runs to the car and starts to drive off, only to almost imediatly CURB MY CAR.  Well, I almost put my foot through the driver's side window and got her the fuck out of there, driving back to Kate's unbelievably pissed off.  Upon arival, i've cooled back off, and we play more Dr. Mario.  The girl I like (TGIL) calls and its time for me to pick her up, which is more or less what i've been waiting for all night.  Imediatly after I hang up the phone with her, Christina, my ""little sister"" and fellow St. Luke's patient calls me, and shes having a bad night.  I bring Will with, we pick up Christina and TGIL, and I drop Will and TGIL back off at Kate's and me and Christina go driving.  Well, we talk, and the poor dear really has been having a hard time.  We talk and she starts to feel better, and her friend calls.  I drop her off there and go back to Kate's, hungry and eager to finally start my night.
     I get there and Andrea, Will's lady friend and also an old friend/love intrest of mine is there.  I haven't seen her in a while so it was nice to talk to her.  The rest of night consisted of TGIL flirting with me then ignoring me then flirting then ignoring.  We later built a fort, then went to sleep in it.  As the night went on, Will and I stayed up all night doing nothing.  I mostly sat there, knowing TGIL was about ten feet from me, yet so much farther away in reality.  Thats what the previous entry was about.  Well, 8 a.m. comes and Will and I are bored as hell so we wake everyone up, clean up the fort, then decide to go to I-HOP.  Then at the last second Kate bails.  Everyone goes home pissed.  TGIL and I end up going to Common Grounds for breakfeast and chess, then I drop her home.  I go home, shower, don't sleep till 3 a.m.  I haven't had much sleep, I still have a small cold, TGIL wants nothing to do with me, i'm broke, and i'm just all around pissed.  The anger has stuck with me these past few days.  I really can't stand many people right now, and I don't know why.  And thats pretty much what i've been up to.  The fucking end.  Bitches."

    As far as today goes, I got up at 1 with a throbbing headache, ready to vomit, drowning in my own snot.  Hot, huh?  Then I watched Jason X, which obviously didnt make me feel much better.  I'm slowly fighting this cold, and I pray i'm ok by Tuesday.  We'll see what happens.  Friday i'm supposed to go to greatskate with a bunch of work folk.  Dunno if i'll go, because they're all bringing their girls.  Ah well, we'll see.  Night all.

     Took my placement test in Greenbay at 8 and got home at about 3ish.  After that i went to Kral's then to Andrew's.  Finally got around to watching Akira over there and watched first season of Clone Wars.  At about 11 we went and got supplies for Kate's party then went to her house.  Everyone got there at around 12:30, including, to my surprise, someone whom I did not expect to see...

     Well, in all honesty, she made my night, even in the little time I had to talk to her.  She always seems to make me happy, and I don't know why.  I forgot to tell her how gorgeous she looked, but oh well, chalk that one up to speechlessness on my part.  At around 3 after we had all been beating the crap out of eachother in the basement, Andrew and I went outside to cool off, then she came and told me she had to go, so I gladly took her home.  Aparently she didn't have a very good time with the guy she went with and said she wished I would have asked her.  We talked all the way to her house, and of course, saying goodnight to her sucked because, well, she was gone!

     Ok, so I like her, even though she doesnt like me.  A guy can dream, can't he?  So I went back to Kates where we kept beating the living hell out of eachother, then around 5 I took Andrew home and I also went home because everyone pussed out and went to bed.  Assholes.

     So, in short, she made my night, and she knows damn well who she is.  I just wish I had listened to my gut before and asked her out, but hey, friends is fine I suppose.  I'm always going to love her, seeing as how I have for the past 2 yearsish, and i'm always going to look out for her.

     Happy Prom people, and hooray for my 1st entry!  Roxz0r''!"

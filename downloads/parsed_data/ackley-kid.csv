"event","i suppose that it has been quite some time.

life is good.
quite good.
too good.
God is good.

somedays i like to be silent
  and today is one of those days.
i do not have much to say because today i feel unworthy.
i am realizing who i am and who i am ""called"" to be.

i watched hotel rawanda last night, unfotunately for the first time.
i cried. my body shook.
and for the first time i did not feel so callous.
so.callous. though.
and that is what i hate. i was still somewhat desensitized.(sp?)
i watched this movie where hundreds of thousands of people were getting slaughtered and i was not sitting there and just watching. 
    i was reacting to pain in other people's lives.
and i fell silent.

all that kept going through my head was
fuck the devil.
for those who know me, that word has never exited my mouth. i cannot say it. it is too harsh. too cruel. too undeserved for anything. anyone.
and last night as jim and i were riding back that repeated over and over.
where is the hate coming from?

my friend chelsea went to rwanda this summer and gave more insight that she had learned. land of a thousand hills--they had to walkfor days sometimes just to go and murder villages. can you imagine having so much hate in you and walking for days just thinking about how your mission is to slice people to death.

my body freezes thinking about it.
i am scared. so scared.

when we got back to jim's house i cleaned up the kitchen from our dinner mess and he packed for his mountain weekend. only after about an hour could i really talk.
we lied on his bed and talked about it.
i will not remain still.
jim writes letters. lots of them. 
to congressmen, governers, cooperation presidents. and i love his voice.
and i will have a voice too.
and not just a voice, but action.

but i think it starts with love.
my judgements have to stop. truly.
if i want to be follower of christ, then i need to love his people.
no matter what.

love never fails.

thank you god for your world, your people, food to eat, clean water to drink, for love. for jim. for every person around me that has ever invested love into my life...
i hope that i can do the same."

""There are plenty of Christians to follow the Lord halfway, but not the
other half. They will give up possessions, friends, and honours, but it
touches them too closely to disown themselves."" (Eckhart, 15th century
mystic)


Dear Tigers,                       10th May 2005

Well, here's to moving towards the halfway mark, and beyond! Over the
last few weeks I have been preaching upcountry with a number of people
who counted the cost and were prepared to give up possessions, friends,
and honours, and even to disown themselves:

Pastor Juvenal was the only man in his whole area to refuse to 'contribute' 
financially to his tribe's rebel cause. He also preached from the pulpit
that the church members should not side with the rebellion or resort to
armed conflict. Consequently, the rebels came on a number of occasions to 
kill him. However, as with the martyrs of Revelation 12v11, who 'did not
love their lives so much as to shrink from death', he was prepared to
disown himself and die. He survived many close shaves. Recently, with the 
disbanding of that rebel group, the commander who had tried to kill him
sought him out and shook his hand, saying: ""Congratulations! Truly you
are a man of God! We tried to get you, and were determined to kill you,
but God always protected you!"" The commander invited Juvenal to the
demobilisation camp to preach to the several thousand troops, who were
duly amazed to see the famous rebellious(!) pastor still alive. Many of
them repented and turned to Christ.

Then there was Ephraim, who runs our Scripture Union northern office. He
was returning by foot to Burundi after a year as a refugee in the Congo.
He felt he simply had to get back to his homeland, but soldiers from the
other tribe took him and tortured him. He told them that God was calling
him back to Burundi, and so they could try to kill him but he knew his
time had not yet come to die. They just thought he was mad, but as they
kicked him to death, he told them that he forgave them and loved them in
Jesus' name. They left him for dead in a crumpled heap and pouring with
blood. However he revived, and is now being used extraordinarily in the
schools and churches around Ngozi. ""That was the day I learned what real
forgiveness is about,"" he told me.

Two weeks ago, Pierre preached with me at a dilapidated church situated
in an area in the hills decimated by the war, its devastation contrasting 
with the stunning view across the lake to the majestic Congolese
mountains. The month before, a group of ladies had been praying in the
church when the mud walls caved in on them. Thankfully none of them died. 
So now they are rebuilding. Pierre said in a matter-of-fact way:
""Soldiers killed my father who was the pastor, and two of my brothers.
But Simon, when you have Jesus, it's OK.""

How those guys challenge and humble me as I consider my own cushioned
existence, self-absorption, petty grievances, and fickle faith! I have
never plumbed the depths of human grief that almost everyone out here
has, so how can I really understand? What do I really know? Who do I
think I am urging them to forgive those who raped or butchered their
loved ones? Such are the questions I ask myself as I stand before people
to share the Word of God, feeling suitably inadequate to the task.
Nevertheless they accept and embrace me and the team, particularly as
they know that we are amongst the few who risked travelling through such
dangerous areas over the last few years, willing to die to bring them the 
liberating message of Christ.

We had some friends out to visit for a couple of weeks, and so took a
road trip to Lake Kivu in Rwanda, which is where I proposed to Lizzie two 
and a half years ago. As Lizzie drove the truck, with Mark and I in the
back lying on top of our luggage and enjoying the sunshine, an impatient
car pulled up close behind and beeped aggressively, wanting to overtake
on the narrow section of road. Lizzie duly clattered through a pothole
with a fresh cowpat in it, spraying the driver as well as a bunch of
soldiers jogging past. That was the biggest laugh I've had in a long
time. The moral of the story, which I've already learnt the hard way, is: 
don't get on the wrong side of Lizzie Guillebaud!

Back to work now, and things have been very mixed. The church I preached
at last Sunday saw the leader excommunicating three deacons in front of
us. A dear friend and key partner at the Children's Future Hope orphanage 
has stumbled badly, and we are trying to move forward wisely with new
accountability in place to support her and see her fully restored. The
university work (Union des Groupes Bibliques au Burundi) is kicking off
with a new leader, Pastor Xenon, after virtually imploding as a movement
over the last year. The APRID team reaching out to Muslims remains
divided, whilst Islam continues to grow so fast; and Jehovah's Witnesses
are spreading like wildfire. But at the same time the Youth for Christ
gang are doing great stuff, and we too at Scripture Union are seeing
amazing fruit. A highlight from last weekend was meeting with a group
upcountry, some of whom had risen at 4am and walked a staggering 40km to
be with us by 3pm. The response to the gospel message was hug!
e. And then a couple of hours later we had set up in an obscure village
to show the Jesus film. Around 5,000 people gathered, with literally many 
hundreds wanting to receive Christ.*

Elections have been delayed, but will hopefully take place in August. We
are hopeful for peace, although a couple of days ago another three people 
were murdered in an ambush on a stretch of road which we used last week,
so although there is a semblance of peace, these things keep you on your toes.

So, plenty to pray into from the above. Thanx so much for being involved
with us. Following Jesus is so very exciting, fulfilling, challenging,
gutting, exasperating, discouraging, exhausting, thrilling, REAL! Here's
to not settling or stopping halfway, but going all the way,

i have probably seen ""god loves you"" or ""jesus loves you"" millions of places since jesus became a reality for me, yet it all seemed so commonplace. hm. right word? 
yes, that could ease any kind of hurt i was feeling. i always had the visualization of just resting in god's hands and him wrapping a cloud of comfort around, but it seemed so temporary and fleeting.
i knew that it was true--but i knew that is was true based more on faith than knowing and having that revelation.  
how appropriate (ha.) that i feel so much like His child today. 
i am clay that my potter continues to try and mold. 
but now, 
i think my artist kneeding me and taking the cold and hard lump and making it warm and pliable with his own hands.
how awesome that the artist who created everything i think is beautiful looks at me and says, ""i want to mold you.""
why do i restrain myself in giving him control? ha. what kind of piece of art do i think i can create? 
like a friend says, we only imitate his ultimate creation.


he brought me to his banquet hall,
and his banner over me is love.
sustain me with raisin cakes, 
refresh me with apples,
because i am lovesick.
let his hand be under my head
and his right hand embrace me.
...
my beloved responded and said to me,
""arise my darling, my beautiful one,
and come along.
for behold the winter is past,
the rain is over and gone.
the flowers have already appeared in the land;
the has arrived for pruning the vines,
and the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land;
the fig tree has ripened its figs,
and the vines in blosson have given forth their fragrance.
arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come along!""

i have a very weird feeling going on inside of me though.
as jenna and i were sitting on her bed last night we decided we'd completed our semester, we met some incredible people, we studied all night long for exams, and we had our college experience...ready to move on.
ha.
but in me, something kept feeling like i was leaving for good and i needed to say goodbye to a lot of close friends. i know or at least am pretty sure that this is not true--but they do say when somebody special to you leaves part of you goes with them...maybe that is it.
i do look foward to more friendships as dynamic as ours, though.
     maybe not as dynamic--but surely close.
            there are 10k people here.
i am left with a pair of dirty socks, camping and hiking memories, two friends that he left part of himself to, and respect.



i am excited about the break though.
it should entail oodles of time with my family of which just in the past few days i've been reminded of the deep love i have for every one of them and friends.
""onething"" in kansas city with jenna should be incredible. i pray that God will start working in my heart now to prepare me for the great things that will happen there.
....ha...and also prepare me for spending some time with the family of mr.  adam perez. 

i submitted some photography to ""miscellany"" , the art and literary magazine here. i am not sure how that will go--but i figure i need to get a reaction to my photography some how. hopefully one of the photographs will make it in and it will encourage me to pursue it a little more. the photos were random: a series of 3 of a tree outside of my house that i have become obsessed with-one is through my window, one is from my porch, and the other right at the tree on a foggy night, a photo from the dominican of a little girl, the ""wet roads"" picture from lake j last year, and finally a photo of my grandfather and cousin that is mostly their shadows.

my laundry is done--so that means packing...

i was not ready for this weekend.
this week rather.
i have barely even made it to my knees to eventually get to my toes.






ah.
last night we went salsa dancing.
i can't not dance.
it was definately far too crowded, but indeed fun. 
we danced until 2, but this time i didn't have to wake up for 8am classes. (which have obsviously proved to be taxing)
i didn't get to dance with wilmer, my partner last time but met a new friend.
he was a good dancer, but didn't talk for about 15 minutes. i was not sure what to do...
especially because after you have been salsa-ing through a few songs you assume the person is enjoying it and would like to know more 
than you moves. ha.
he could not speak english. he apologized and i told him it was ok with my thumb and index finger in a round circle and my other fingers up. 
i then attempted to say that dancing was a language. it was lame. i know.
but, fit so well.
and i really truly believed it and somehow it seemed so romantic. 
but only in the way that even just dancing, soley was romantic.

jenna told me that the way i dress is romantic. i liked that.



tonight as i was lying on the bricks in front of the buist dorm giggling away i stopped and just looked up. ohhhhh
it was the clay like leaves and trunks that reminded my of nights at the park.
i smiled. and then hurt.


i've been able to read so much lately.
maybe that has been the cause of my two week funk.
i think so.

i am sitting with my legs crossed up on my chair becaus their is a palmetto bug chilling out below me. they digust me.
i am fine with large spiders crawling up my sheets and near my mouth, but these bugs are awful. walking around charleston i feel like i am in a sewer because they just scurry around everywhere. a few weeks ago i smashed on that was chasing me around my room and white guts came out.
hm.


i will be ready for this week.



and so...
i will dance before the LORD."

"event","the more and more i become overwelmed with the glory of God, the more my heart overflows with His love and my need to share this intense love with anyone and everyone envelops me.

often i have times when i doubt God. i doubt the existence of Him, i doubt that He can solve anything in my heart. i doubt that the reason for my living has a purpose. the devil takes hold of me. the devil uses his greatest and i believe only tool: deceit.
i become enchanted by worldly desires. i want to do things for myself and myself only. whatever relationship i pursue becomes purely for my benefit. i go to church to look like i am still ""running the race"".
yet, i have stopped dead in my tracks. my feet aren't hitting the ground hard, my heart slowly stops pounding, and i drag myself backwards, my feet slugglishly pulling me back. i cause others to stumble. they assume i am still looking ahead, that we are still running the same race. 
the devil grabs me and soon it becomes alright that i am walking backwards. i can still see ""the goal"".
this is comfortable. it is ok. it is lazy.i remember running and how good it felt and i think that it can sustain me.
by this time my back is turned-- everything is a memory. that is good enough.
i am lonely. i have people surrounding me. nothing goes beyond my head. my heart builds a wall around it.
i have it all though. right?
people. cool clothes. not only people, but those who think it is still me. people who think i am still the person God created me to be. 

my self-control is lost.
my discipline.
my ability to communicate with my maker.

and then, 
i walk outside, the sun hits me--hits my eyelids. i close them. i can feel the heat. the wind blows in my face.
and this overwelming peace seeps through all the holes in my body. 
i hear the violins play in the background.

i surrender.
i remember.
i love.

i come to jesus. i lay everything i have at His feet. i become mary--i wash His feet. He redeems me. He has made me whole. He forgets about my backwards steps and pushes me to run ahead. better than that, He gives me enough strength to run faster than i ever have. i take my place. my eyes are fixed, nothing is in the way. there ain't no mountain high enough. i praise Him. 
the goal seems miles upon miles away, but it does not matter. i do not look back except to tell the others along the way of this ""man"" who took my hand and encouraged me to get back in the race. that is what i was made to do He tells me. He knows.

i get discouraged. i tell Him i don't think people will understand. He says they probably will not understand now but, when they let themselves they will find it.  what will they think of me? i wonder.
He holds me. 
He asks my whose favor i am seeking? 
i remember His intimacy.
i remember His rhythm.
i swallow. ask for grace, and let my mouth overflow with His words and His love-- His everlasting, pure, and holy love.
and He blesses me with everything. and sometimes i recognize that. but mostly i ask for forgiveness for not recognizing it.

then He gives me a day like today..."

"event","so, i am in charleston and i think that i have adapted quite well.
it feels very normal living by myself. i never realized how much up-keep there is though, mostly due to my inability to put things back where they belong once i am finished with them. 

but i enjoy it.
i like hand washing my dishes after i have made a dinner of exactly what i like.

and goodness, i am listening to badly drawn boy's new one plus one is one record, and it may be my favorite. i was not ever sure that anything could beat the hour of bewilderbeast, but it is definately a possibility now. oh, it is beautiful.

anyway...
i have met some pretty cool people thus far. i have yet to see anybody that i know here. maybe soon.

and i FINALLY have a roommate.
nichole is moving in next week.
we're very different, but get along very well. we talk almost every day and she reminds me a lot of my friend, kirby, from episcopal.
we met in the lunch line at orientation.
it was a blessing. 
  and one of those things that God could only have put together and figured out.
  
i went to a church service on sunday. it was a nice church--their college service starts downtown this week. i felt very alone because i knew nobody, but i was able to fully worship the LORD i love, and it was good to know that i really just need Him. the music was rockin' and the pastor talked about how real and deceitful the devil and how we must flee from that and replace his lies with the Truth. i have to remind myself of that everyday. every minute, jeez. we fall so quickly. i know. 
in the beginning i had a hard time leading my day as worship, i was beginning to believe the lie that i needed people to be satisfied. as wonderful and great friendships and relationships with other people are, all i need is God. we were partying over on queen street. yay.

i am ready for my 8AM! class tomorrow.

"event","i am here at the richard's for my last night.
i have been evan michael's nanny and although my task seemed easy, i am learning very quickly of how badly i want girls.

the house is quiet now.            sometimes evan
 likes to turn the volume up on the television as loud as possible-- just for laughs.
he also enjoys sporatic screaming around the house.
when he gets mad at me for not giving him ""everything he wants"" his favorite way to clue me in that he is upset goes two ways:
  one- ""you're a dirty, ugly, stinky girl!""
  two- ""nobody knows how to take care of me. i only know. in the whole entire earth. i am the smartest.""

the evenings i have looked foward to most.
each night has started with oswald chambers' <i>my utmost for his highest</i> and then <i>the upper room</i>--two daily devotionals. i then would take notes on my learnings followed by reading a book of the new testament. i've really enjoyed this time of silence and absense of distractions.
getting in bed i have been reading <i>middle passage</i> by charles johnson, a national book award winner.

when i went by my house today to take my laundry I LEFT THEM THERE. i don't know why i even grabbed them with the other pile of stuff.

i have watched enough television with evan to hold me for a few years. yikes.
no mas.

anyway, now i have checked both e-mail accounts and am waiting for any updates on livejournal.
or phillip to call for our evening chat.

my travel bible that christimae gave me for banquet last summer has become such a part of me that, like a story i heard on this american life about a guy who could find anything, i can feel its pull and how out of place it is right now. i am glad that i finally have a real true desire to read God's word intensely instead of just making myself do it.



i ordered furniture for my apartment today. for some reason i have to call back tomorrow for the GALLANT desk that i'd like. i found most of it from a caompany called IKEA. its wonderful. excellent prices.

"event","on numerous occasion i have thought about updating. 
each one just gets farther away from my last update and i feel as though i'd have to go back a re-cap the previous days.

today was productive. 

but lets go back before then...
i went to boston on friday and saturday. 
       (my dad had a meeting there and invited me along)       
it was wet and cold--but i enjoyed myself just as much as the last time i went.  then, the weather was just right for my red cardigan and old woman sunglasses.
               sometimes dark, wet weather can be exhilerating when you push through it and make it refreshing.
    my dad and i went and bought to black umbrellas and walked the streets.  
my favorite stop was anthropologie. my store. not only did they have the amelie soundtrack and aimee mann(whom i was listening to the day before i left) playing but they had the exact audrey hepburn bigoraphy i got for christmas. 
   it is nice to go into a store and feel right at home.

anyway...
later that evening my dad and i took a taxi to fenway park to see boston kill seatle. i saw a grand slam...and it was darn pretty. and graceful. and it made the whole evening
my dad ate his first hot dog in three years there as well.
i liked sitting in wooden bleachers that squeaked when you put them down. there weren't cup holders and that was odd.
     i slept in the most comfy and lucious bad that night. my bed felt like one of those massive feather body pillows that you see on television, but never for a real at a friends house.

we woke up, flew back to jax and straight from the airport headed to 
charleston(booboopeedo...)south carolina.  on the way we listened to john grishams ""king of torts"" book on tape. i was a little hesitant about listening at first, but my dad assured me that it would be enjoyable.
    it was.
in charleston we were on the apartment search.
    on sunday we attended church at trinity united methodists---one of the oldest churches in charleston. it was beautiful. sitting behind me happened to be my counselor from  years ago at crestridge, and we chatted it up as well as exchanged phone numbers.
    after lunch we walked around looking for ""for rent"" signs and addresses like 180a queen street that we discovered in the paper. sometimes we knocked on the door see what the inside looked like because it was hard to get in touch with the realtors considering it was memorial day weekend. one lady offered us tea and gave us a wonderful tour of her apartment.
    i loved so many of the apartments. 
          the so many that i loved were in huge houses built in te 1800's that had been split up into many aparments. my favorite were the hardwood floors that creeked when you walked on them.  and the porches on the side that were slanted apparently so the rain could easily slide off. 
   we probably went into 20 apartments.
  also in charleston was a lovely art festival. spoleto. that night we went to see alvin ailey. i love alvin ailey. especially amos.

this after noon was lovely.
i rode my bike to one of my favorite spots on the river and read and wrote in my new red journal for quite some time.
god and i had some intimate moments.


two passages i read in <u>the four loves</u> by cs lewis today:

on friendship--
it is when two such persons discover one another, when, whether with immense difficulties and semi-articulate fumblings or with what seem to us amazing and elliptical speed, they share their vision-- it is then that Friendship is born. and instantly they stand together in an immense solitude.

on likings and loves for the sub-human:
many people-i am one myself--would never, but for what nature does to us, have had any content to put into the words we must use in confessing our faith. nature never taught me that there exists a god of glory and of infinite majesty. i had to learn that in other ways. but nature gave the word glory a meaning for me. i still do not know where else i could have found one. ...and if nature had never awakened certain longings in me, huge areas of what i can now mean by the ""love"" of god would never, so far as i can see, have existed."

i'll apologize now for the 10 million times i talk about the dominican, but when you have such an amazing and life changing experience, it is hard not to want to tell everybody about every detail.  it is funny though, it is hard to talk about when asked.

"event","this week.
hmm.
sunday-to-sunday.

my heart has been busy lately. 
between tearing it apart and trying to keep it pure and holy for my gracious god, i have discovered a fuller capacity for love. 
            love is patient. 
      and not self-seeking. 
   and i am not sure that i have fully grasped either yet.

gracious. god.
i do not deserve the beauty that he puts in my life.
often i forget of what i am able to do.
i get so frustrated when i have to make decisions. and choices. 
like with schools, with what i want to do in the next fifteen minutes, what i think my future should be--
i am privileged enough to have so many opportunities.
i complain about the stress these decisions cause.

this world is temporary. my citizenship is in heaven.



i played football on saturday, after the surprise picnic for adam at memorial park.
all those boys make my laugh. constantly.
it reminded me on how my neighborhood was in elementary school.
we were constantly outside either playing horse, burying treasures, or just getting dirty. we used to play ""war"" or capture the flag for hours on saturdays. just running around and being sneaky.
we always got dirty. man.
and did not care a bit. 
very rarely did we even wear shoes.
but while playing football i stopped caring about my white shirt getting grass marks. my toes dug into the cold wet and slippery grass every five seconds. i left smelling like cocoa after he hasn't had a bath in weeks. and i was completely content.

god gave me the ability to laugh.
and enjoy.
and that was beautiful."

"event","sometimes my days are so long that each section becomes a day of its own.

every three or so hours a new day starts and i become more tired from the day that has just past.

its on nights like these that i wish i had some kind of art studio. i have so much to say that really can not be expressed with anything restrictive. i'd still like to make a canvas dance floor and use my feet as brushes. i think that might be a true way of expression for me. i don't think i can adequately do it with a paintbrush and paint or just my movements. i need to see it. i need to understand everything that it is worth.  
when i have a house of my own i would like to be certain it was three things:
a bedroom where my bed is near the floor.
a sacred space. a room devoted to god. to silence. to prayer and meditation.
an art/dance studio.

my throat hurts and i am not sure if that is because of my lack of sleep or just because i am sick or both.


thank you lord for the constant joy you graciously give me and the abiltiy to recognize my joy and my fleeting happiness. 
thank you for days when the cold wind can feel so natural and refreshing against my skin.
thank you god for the fellowship and laughter with friends.
thank you for the way night whispers to me.
thank you for emotional nights and renewed mornings.
thank you for your word.
thank you lord for your intimacy.
what a mighty god we serve.
here i am."

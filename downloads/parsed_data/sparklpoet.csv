"event","SO, yeah. Once again my LJ has fallen on the wayside. But that's mostly because I write all my little thoughts on Twitter (twitter.com/elliB) and my 'big' thoughts on my new blog (http://ellibmusings.blosgspot.com)... I also intern at www.autostraddle.com (""girl-on-girl culture"") helping find pics and links and proofreading and transcribing interviews and all kinds of stuff like that. So if you care to see what I'm up to these days, check those out."

"event","So... I didn't do NaNoWriMo. I didn't plan ahead and I epically failed. So much for writing again. BUT it's 2009 and I'm determined to do what I need to do to be happy. I've been doing a little bit of pre-walking but tomorrow (today?) I'm going to start 'officially' training for the 2009 Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer 3-Day! I'm so itchy for new ink. I'm going to work out a large (arm?) piece and go back to Robin. Number 17, baby! I've been obsessively listening to T&S and AFP/DD for... months? and I'm not about to stop. School has been frustrating but I will get it figured out- grad school will not continue to evade, at least not forever! I need to start going to the theatre more again. And start reading more again, even if it means re-reading the HP books before starting in on these piles of new books. I'm going to keep reading all the (queer) blogs that I can find. In 2009 I will go to a girl bar. Not just a gay bar. But an actual GIRL bar. No resolutions, only goals."

I think I am going to try this National Novel Writing Month deal... 1,666 2/3 words a day between today and November 30th to complete a 50,000 word novel. The focus is quantity over quality, just to get people writing. Then I can take what I have in December and try and edit it into something cohesive and readable. I think I'm going to try a memoir of sorts. More like vignettes or stories, dreams, memories. Snippets of me. That's what I'll call it. Maybe. Or maybe in the end I'll just have a bunch of crappy short stories that I can turn into a couple of poems. We shall see..."

"event","About 2 years ago I wrote her a poem. Because she asked me to write something for her. So I wrote her a love poem. A gorgeous gem. Then things went sour. And over a year ago I erased said poem from all my blogs. Because it hurt to read it. A lot of poets/musicians... when they write something down they can separate themselves from the emotion. I can't, not right away at least. But now I remember that poem, how it really was a good one, initial subject matter aside. And I wish that I had it again. To post, to share. To jumpstart my muse. But I no longer have it. It might be stuck on my dead laptop, but that's no help. And I'm sure she still has it because she is sentimental like that. But it's not like I can ask her for it... ""Oh hey, I still have your drill, your movie, and your sunglasses... Do you think I can have my love poem back?""

The corporate matching from Beth/ITW went through and my donations are up to $1925!! $2200 (the minimum amount I need to raise to be allowed to participate) here I come...! Now if only my training were going as well. I need someone to walk with me, to help keep me motivated. I mean, I know that I will survive the walk, but I don't want to feel like a zombie by the end of it, I want to have built up enough endurance to enjoy the whole walk. So if anyone wants to come walk on the lake/beach with me some nights after work, that'd be so cool... and of course, any and all donations are much appreciated!"

"event","So here I am. The fireflies are out tonight. So are the fools. I got sick of sitting in my apartment so I grabbed some essentials (pencil, paper, Ipod, keys, ID, cash) and headed for Foster Beach. It's a little past sunset. The sky is beautiful. 'Out Tonight' is playing on MyPod- how apropo. 

Now don't get me wrong- I love Chicago. I love my family and my friends. My job is pretty cool. But I'm in another one of those funks where I want to sell all my shit, drop everything and just go. Move. Something. Everything. Last time I wanted to teach English in Korea. But that's 2 years in a tiny room. That's only a little different than what I have now- 2 rooms in a predominantly Vietnamese area. I'm just so sick of this country and its excess and its politics and its hypocracy. That's not to say that I'm above it or free of it or anything. But I'm drowning in it. And I have to do something. I've tried different things. I bury myself in cds and dvds and books. I give money to the DNC, the HRC, IL PIRG... all these places. I've signed up for this Breast Cancer walk. But it only makes me feel a little better. I'm not making any great changes or contributions. No one is going to remember me. Hardly anyone even knows who I am now. Not that I need to be 'known' but everyone wants validation and acceptance, right? So the thing I've been thinking about lately is moving. Far away. I want to see things. Different things. Beautiful things. More beautiful things than I can see here. The other day driving home from work I saw a 12- or 13-year-old boy randomly walk up to a 20-something year old girl, give her a flower that he had picked, and then walk away. It was random and beautiful but it makes me sad that it is so rare and noteworthy to see something that simple and meaningful. 

I want to live in Spain- the art and the architecture and the history and the language and the coexistance of many peoples (and religions). And it is a predominantly Catholic society where same-sex marriage is legal and accepted. I want to live in Canada (Toronto)- it's a lot like the US, but it's cleaner and less crowded, and again, same-sex marriage is legal. And how many wars has Canada been in lately? I want to live in India. I've always admired the culture, art, food, dress, religion- everything. I was fascinated by Devon street, growing up in Little India. The cost of living in India is so much lower. And the people have so little but seem more kind. Or at least less judgemental. I don't know. I've never been. It just appeals to me. I could have a beautilful, 2 story, 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom bungalow there, with a private garden and terrace, reserved parking, ocean view and more for just over $100 thousand. That's unheard of. I could just sell all the crap I own (aside from a few essentials) and buy property somewhere in Southeast Asia and live off the money I have and write and adventure and talk to people and try and give back at least as much as I take from society and the planet. 

How easy would that be? How much more simple? I don't think I could live without my music and a few good volumes to read, but really, besides that, how much of my shit do I need? None of it, really. I realize that most of you think I'm all talk, and I probably am. That doesn't mean that I'm not sincere. Just because I don't sell it all and flee the country doesn't mean that I don't really want to or that I'm not capable. I'm just afraid. Of being alone. Of missing my family (and close friends). Of being forgotten about. So maybe someone could come with me. We can start an adventure together. Travel the world. Photograph it. Write about it. Soak it in. Talk about it. Appreciate it. Breathe it. Live it. 

Maybe someday. For now I am going to walk a bit more and then go home (and type this into MySpace because I'm lame like that), and go to bed and get ready for another fun-filled stretch at work. The cops on ATVs just flew past, leaving tracks in the sand and the scent of gas in the air. So the aura is ruined and my time here is done.

Another note- the song on MyPod as I arrived home and sat down to type this was Frou Frou's Maddening Shroud. Again, very apropo. See for yourself- here are the lyrics:


Sometimes I like to get away from this maddening shroud
Sometimes I'll have you know, it's all insane
Maybe it's time for me to pack it in
Maybe it's time for me to jack it in
Maybe it's time for me to halt

I've got a good mind to throw it all away
Throw it all away
Throw it all away
I've got a good mind to throw it all away
After all, what is it worth

Sometimes I like to get away from this saddening crowd
Sometimes I feel my life is all in vain
Maybe it's time for me to pack it in
Maybe it's time for me to jack it in
Maybe it's time for me to halt

I've got a good mind to throw it all away
Throw it all away
Throw it all away
I've got a good mind to throw it all away
After all, what is it worth

Some days my strength walks out
Some days I can't go on
It is for real
We can walk about
We can work it over and over and over and over and over

I've got a good mind to throw it all away
Throw it all away
Throw it all away
I've got a good mind to throw it all away
After all, what is it worth

I've got a good mind to throw it all away
Throw it all away
Throw it all away
I've got a good mind to throw it all away
After all, what is it worth"

Ok folks, by now you should all know that I am doing the Breast Cancer 3-Day that raises money for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and the National Philanthropic Trust Breast Cancer Fund. It is a 60 mile walk over 3 days around Chicagoland, and it runs from September 8th-10th. In order to walk I need to raise at least $2200. If I don't reach that goal I either can't walk OR I can pledge to pay the rest myself (I'm given a 4 week period to fundraise the remainder or my credit card will be charged the difference.) I have set my personal goal at $2500. As of today I have $230 accounted for on my personal fundraising HQ (any recently mailed donations haven't been procesed yet.) There is currently a challenge to reach your first $500 within 60 days of registering. I have been registered for about 2 weeks, so if I can really get my fundraising going I can meet that challenge. It is quick and easy to donate on my webpage OR you can print out a form and mail in a donation. There is even an option to give your donation in monthly installments, so if you want to give a sizeable amount but can't swing it all at once, you can pay it in chunks, and I get credit for the whole donation right away. And you can do me a HUGE favor by passing this info on to at least one other person. Soon I will start having fundraising parties and the like. I'm even collecting my change in a jar (and thanks to Nhung our cafe at work has starting collecting their tips.) But I need your support. Even a $5 donation gets me closer to my goal. And if you work somewhere that has a charitable matching program, that's even better. If you already made a donation for me- THANK YOU! If you are considering giving me a donation- THANK YOU! If you want to go with me on one of my walks to keep me company or to keep me motivated or anything- YOU ROCK! I started my official training last week-  I walk 4 times a week around my neighborhood and along the lake. Two days a week are set aside for cardio/crosstraining- yoga or rollerblading or the like. I am doing all of this while working 40-hours a week (usually including weekends) so it's been interesting fitting it all in, but I know it's worth it. So please consider helping me out in any way that you can. I appreciate it and so do all the women (and men) who benefit from the Susan G. Komen Foundation.

Thanks for your time!

"event","So I just got in from an almost 2.5 hour, 6+ mile walk (about 9500 steps on my crappity pedometer...). I'm just taking a break to cool down and eat some yogurt and peanuts. Yum. I walked flat paths and hilly ones, on pavement, sand, gravel, grass and rock, I walked fast and slow. I'm at a really great starting point for my training. I walked from my apartment to the top of Foster Beach (the start of the Lakefront Trail) down along the water to Montrose Beach/Harbor, all into and around in the Bird Sanctuary/Nature Conservatory/etc., back along the water along the golf course, all the way down into Belmont Harbor (as far as you can go until you are stuck by the boat inlet), back up and out of the harbor area and then all along LSD and the tennis courts and baseball fields, back under LSD at Foster, a little through the beginning of Lincoln Park (the actual park that spans the lake, not that neighborhood) and then home.

I mapped out my training schedule today using the3day.orgs recommended schedule and this running journal that I bought. Actually, on the website there is a 24-week recommended training schedule and then a 16 week schedule for late starters. This is the end of week 20, so I worked out a hybrid schedule that starts next week (the weeks run Monday-Sunday so that the last week ends with the Fri-Sun walk itself). Their schedule is pretty basic-

Monday- rest
Tuesday- easy walking starting at 3 miles and building to 6 miles
Wednesday- moderate cross training starting at 15 minutes and building to 45 minutes
Thursday- moderate walking starting at 4 miles and building to 6 miles
Friday- easy cross training starting at 30 minutes and switching to 45 minutes after a few weeks
Saturday- easy walking starting at 5 miles and building to alternating days of 10 and 18 miles
Sunday- easy walking starting at 3 miles, peaking at 15 miles, then ending at 8 miles

The only problem I am going to have is figuring out the long weekend walks as I have to work Saturdays and almost always work Sundays. I might switch one of those to my resting days and one of those to the lighter cross training or short walk days and do the longer walks during the week on my days off. I'll have to see each weeks work schedule to figure that out. Or I can just work and walk ALL weekend and then really, really rest on Mondays (which may or may not actually be my day off of work...).

Easy walks are '2-3 miles an hour on flat surfaces.'
Moderate walks are '3-4 miles an hour or including up and down hills.'
Cross training is 'any activity that increases your heart rate and involves using your whole body' and it 'includes bicycling, the elliptical trainer, swimming, rollerblading, pilates, yoga or dance. Duration of the activity is what we are trying to incorporate, not the intensity or type of activity.'

They also say that splitting the long walks into two sessions a day is fine, and even recommended. The other thing I need to figure out is my cross training activity. For the shorter/easier sessions I can do the various yoga dvds and balance ball type stuff I have here. But for the longer/harder days- I have broken, crappity roller blades back in DP and an icky, old, useless bike that is still in DP because I have no place to keep a bike here. But I have a few weeks until those more intense cross training days start, so perhaps I can invest in some nicer blades or a membership to the pool at a nearby Y... we shall see.

Now I need to go shower and work this cramp out of my right foot. Then it's out with some peeps. :)"

...and I will walk 500 more... 
Current mood:  determined 
Category: Goals, Plans, Hopes 


(...if you add the months of training to the 60 miles of the event...)

So my credit card took a huge hit today. But it is all going to be worth it. Aside from the metric shit-ton I spent on my brothers bday gift (it's not every day your baby brother turns 16, after all) and a few small books and cds I bought for myself, all the money I spent today was for a good cause.

I am now fully and officially registered for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer 3-Day. I will be walking 60 miles around the Chicagoland area from September 8th-10th 2006. I had to pay $90 to register, give the first donation toward my goal (I have to raise a minimum of $2200, I set my goal at $2500), I bought a bunch of the tshirts and bracelets and water bottles from the site (I needed the things plus that money also helps the organization), I bought good shoes and inserts, ankle and wrist weights, knee braces, walking books/journals, a pedometer, etc. etc. etc.

I registered as an individual but I can start a team if I want, or if I find a local team, I can join. If anyone is interested in walking with me, let me know, maybe we can start our own team. Even if it is just 2 of us. Every bit is seriously worth it.

Some of you know that my mother has had precancerous lumps removed of several occassions, most recently just this past fall around when I moved out. My grandmother and some of my aunts have had the same. My great aunt, Taunta Elli, had (among other types) breast cancer. These women are all my mothers (and my) blood relatives, and I therefore have to be careful myself, I have a pretty positive history. I don't even know what the history is on my father's side.

The foundation provides you with 3 meals a day while on the walk, focus and training sessions in your area to prepare for the walk, online guides and coaches, a phone number and email address if you have any questions or concerns, your own site to gather and monitor your donations (http://www.the3day.org/chicago06/bizzybit), a handbook, the donor forms- everything. As you walk each day they transport your gear (sleeping bag, tent, clothes, etc.) to the campsite, and like all long walks/runs/rides, medics and sweeps vehicles are everywhere along the route so if you feel you can't make it, help is there.

I am really excited to start walking and working out more and more (Especially since I can just go over to the friggin beautiful beach and train all summer. Yay for walking in the sand- so good for toning!) to get ready for this. I am actually motivated for something. Something big.

Please do whatever you can to support me- even if it is $5 and a kind word, a lift when I walk too far to make it home while training, an ear when I have to bitch about not wanting to walk anymore, a sign and a smile when I reach the end- anything.

so i am mostly moved into my apartment now, just some junk here, and all that but i still dont have cable/internet and i wasnt able to get any installation date before sept 28th! ah! oh well. i will bum tv off of friends and mommy. like on wednesday i am coming here (home-dp) after work to see the season 2 premiere of Lost. w00t. but i think i can scam internet off the other wireless networks that my laptop seems to be picking up on. yeehaw. and david thinks that if i just screw in a coaxial cable i might be able to use it as an antenae to get local/regular tv. so i can ignore the news and watch friends reruns :)

i'm mostly over the homesickness because ive gotten to see everyone now and i brought my kitty over today. mostly i was seriously bummed cuz ive never lived away from family or alone at all and i had to tv or internet to connect me to the outside world or a kitten or a roomie to talk to and i was so tired and stressed and my mom had to have more surgery (lumps in the breast) and blah blah blah. its still weird but my mom and i have planned for me and kitten to come visit every week or 2 to keeps us all caught up and everything.

i should go now cuz im tired and i hafta drive back to my apt and parking is a bitch to find and i have to work in the am..."

"event","so apparently my mother was not specific enough about the termination date of my upstairs phoneline so it is no longer. now i have to pop down here occassionally and use my mothers dsl and since i will not have my internet up right away when i move out, i will have to rely on the kindness of my friends and the chicago public libraries. the conrad sulzer regional public library on lincoln isnt too far from my apartment (by car), i used to go there for all my gradeschool projects and papers back in the day, i think that library is big enough to have public internet terminals. we shall see i suppose. i'd like to go back there sometime just to see how it has changed over the years since i last lived in chicago.

on another note, packing is so depressing. it's never been my favorite thing. suddenly home doesn't look or feel like home anymore and your entire life is reduced to cardboard boxes. and you think, is this what i am? if i were to die, this is what my family would have of me? a few cardboard boxes of books and cds. a few garbage bags full of old mail and magazines. dusty shelves of unwanted junk. that's all that i am."

"event","So, as most of you know, my mom has asked me to email everyone again and let you know how things went, at least as well as I can. I haven't been into the hospital yet today so all I have to go on is what we learned from the nurses and such yesterday. When the doctor went in this time to check out the hip it was determined that the rotator cuff/cup needed replacing, that somehow it wasn't staying in there right even though it was so fully cemented. So he cut it out and replaced it and it immediately popped out. So he put in another and that too popped out. So he figured the locking mechanism that holds the ball joint and everything together in place must have gone bad. So he had to quickly order in a half of a prosthesis to replace the top half of the hip. He was able to leave the stem in the thigh bone this time though, so the muscle and tissue there didn't have to endure much more damage. The whole ordeal took nearly 6 hours. Mom was glad that the doctor experienced the hip popping out first hand, right there on the table so he could actually see what was wrong himself. He was having a hard time figuring it out before because all the xrays and such came back fine and he knew how heavily he had cemented replacement #2 after #1 didn't work out. So they say that the 3rd time's a charm and we are really hoping that holds true. As far as we know there was no more infection or anything inside there. Mom is at Westlake Hospital room [removed]. Her phone number there is [removed]. I am sending this from moms email because I am on my computer which is sans yahoo/DSL and I don't have everyones email addresses otherwise. And I'm not quite sure that I got everyone and all the right email addresses, so pass this on if you think you need to. You can call her at the hospital if you want, if she can't answer David will, or I will once I am there. I think she should be there at least a few more days. I don't know if she will have to go to rehab again after or not. She doesn't want to if she doesn't have to, you all know how she can be. Not sure when the next email update will be, depends on what information I get and when. Don't be afraid to call or email. My email is sabrinakat99@yahoo.com.

PS- Here is part of moms email for anyone that may have missed it for whatever reason:
""Now for the news on surgery. Most of you already know that I have been having alot of problems with my new hip and that I still have tremdous pain and less use of my right leg. After many appointments and steriod injections it has been decided that I will need another surgery on my hip implant. The implant that is there is not working right and it is loose, which can't be left the way it is. Over the last 3 months alone my implant has gotten worse to the point that it has caused great concern from the surgeon. He will be going back in surgically on July 19th and will attempt to fix whatever problems he finds. There isn't a guarantee that I will have less pain or more use of the leg after this surgery, but not doing surgery will most definetly cause more problems and I will eventually loose the use of my right leg. When the surgeon goes in he hopes to find just a loose implant, which is an easy fix, but he may also find an infection and/or that I am rejecting the implant. It is possible to have a allergic reactions to the implant, although it is a very slim chance that I do, but also an infection within the bone as well. I did have a very severe infection after the second surgery and it could have traveled to the bone and I would not have had any other symptoms other than the ones I already have. The surgeon thinks that I have soft tissue damage since this was an issue with the second surgery. Either way, I need to have him go back in to see what is really going on. This surgery is more risky than the first two and I will have more blood loss. I am not sure how long I will be in the hospital, but I will have Elli e-mail you with all the news and updates after the surgery."""

"event","So today I met with The Apartment People. I filled out paperwork. I saw 7 apartments between 5 buildings. I ended up applying for the 2nd apartment I saw in the first buildling. It's a little smaller than some of the others I saw and some of the others had hardwood floors, but I felt better about this building and location and management co. So here are the particulars:

930 W. Winona Apt. #212
That's the southern area of Andersonville, it's just off Foster and Sheridan, a bit east of the Neofuturarium. :) Right near the lake and the red line. It's a one bedroom with tons of closet space, and L-shaped living room/dining room space and a small walk-through galley kitchen, hot water radiators, ceiling fans, many windows and an ac unit. They paint for you, you get to choose from a variety of their pre-approved colors, though sometimes they will negotiate a different color. There is relatively new greyish berber carpeting. The building itself is really nice, 4 or 5 floors with an elevator, it's I shaped with an uncovered parking lot in back and a parking garage below. Nice laundry room with machines that take debit and credit cards. Each unit is ready for either comcast cable and high speed internet or cable/DSL. I had to pay the first months rent to take it off the market while they do my credit check and all that and then there was the $50 application and credit check fee. I should find out if I get it by Monday. Then I have about 4 days to go in and sign the lease where I will pay the last months rent in lieu of a security deposit. There is a $15/mo pet fee. And parking spaces require a separate payment and lease so I've skipped that option for now. I will have the place by Sept. 1st but I won't be due to pay rent again until October. If I don't get the place I get my first rent check back and we look again. If I get it but for some reason don't go and sign the lease, I forfeit that rent check. That's The Apartment People's insurance since they are a free service. So hopefully I will hear from them by Monday, go Tuesday or Wednesday and sign the lease, pay the last months rent and choose my wall colors. Then on Sept. 1st I'll start moving in. Yay. :)"

Population of Ethiopia- 70 Million
# of Orphans- 4 Million!
# of Orphans who lost their parents to AIDS- 720,000
# of Orphans who have HIV- 250,000
# of US Visas issued last year for Ethiopian adoptions- 289. That's it.

In Ethiopia it only takes about 3 months now to go through the whole adoption process and it costs $15,000 to $18,000 (fees and travel costs), which is about half of what it costs in most other countries. Married couples and single women are eligible to adopt. Single men aren't allowed to adopt in many places. That needs to change. In India there isn't even set law or process for the adoption of their children to anyone that isn't Hindu. Not quite 500 adoptions of Indian children by US citizens took place last year. The children are placed in the custody of their new parents to be legally adopted back in the parents home country. Single men aren't allowed to adopt in India either. In China only married couples and straight, single women can adopt. It's actually illegal to give your child up for adoption in China, so most are abandoned into a sort of 'underground railroad' for orphans, who are mainly female due to the 'one child per family' and land inheritance laws. But despite all that, the adoption process from China is among the most reliable. I could literally go on for days here.   Adoption.com   Adoption.org   Check them out.

I've wanted to adopt for so long now and everytime some celebrity adopts and all this info makes the news, it makes me cringe. Not at the celebrity parent, God bless them for doing it (Mia Farrow is a saint. She's adopted 10+ older and special needs children all on her own. Angelina Jolie. Calista Flockhart. Sharon Stone...). I cringe because the media speculates at why they've adopted or who they've adopted with instead of seeing how great it is, especially for that child. I cringe because numbers like these hurt. And I cringe because most people don't take notice of these painful numbers unless a celebrity adopts. I've spent time in the past going through various adoption websites. China. Russia. Various former republics (USSR). It's so sad. Some of them feature the children like cars for sale. But it's the only way to get any attention. Some of them still have such high costs and strict requirments it's a wonder any of their orphans are adopted. A family at our church adopted a little boy from either Russia or a republic several years ago and then just a few years ago they adopted a little girl from China. My pastor adopted his daughter from a teen mother in Arkansas. A family I used to sit for adopted their first little girl. A former high school teacher of mine is in the process of adopting a little girl from China. Two of my cousins, who are blood siblings, were adopted from Argentina when they were 11 and 7. I love that I know so many adopted children/people. One of my cousins was forced to give her first son up for adoption and I'm glad there was someone there to take him in and love him. Same thing for one of my aunts. My mom was a live-in caregiver for a family with 2 children- a daughter with down syndrome and a foster son. I lived there with them too for a while when I was little. My mom wanted us to become a foster family, and I was all for it, but my stepdad was afraid he would become too attached and have a hard time when the children left. I want to adopt at least 4 kids. And I want them to all be from different countries, from these countries where there are orphans in the millions. And there are so many ways to adopt. Infant adoptions. International adoptions. Foster adoptions. These are the things our country should be focusing on. We want to make the world a better, safer place? Then we should be doing it by actually caring for the children that are the future of this world. Not by being the world police and taking down regimes and then setting them up to fail."

my stepmom emailed to say that for whatever reason our bank one/jp morgan rep has just been hanging onto our checks for the last few months and should be sending them out anytime now. in the future they will be sent directly to us. also, the irs approved the inheritance taxes that they were given (er, that they took) so the extra lump sum that was put aside (just in case they didn't) will be distributed to us besides what the settlement already has set up for us. but who knows how long that will take. and i have a ~$700 credit with us airways to use by jan. 5th since we didn't go to cancun in march.

my moms 3rd hip surgery is the 19th. it is basically a '3 strikes and you're out' deal but we are looking at it as '3rd time's a charm.' and her mammogram came back not so good again so she is also looking at possibly another lumpectomy. hopefully that will be enough. like shes not gone through enough already. prayers are always appreciated.

we had to have a plumber come out for the second time this week (yay mr gutowski!) because today when we flushed the toilet stuff was coming up the side of our driveway (where there is a little drain). better than what happened on tuesday though- i was showering and the water stopped draining and the toilet was making noises and air bubbles were coming up so i flushed it and the water came up instead of going down (and the bottom of our water heater rusted out...) so now there is a hole in our yard next to the house (where mr gutowski had to replace old old piping) which should hopefully be fixed by mid-august when i want to have my bbq. oh, and my stepdad and brother replaced the water heater. so all is good in plumbing land.

i have to call the Apartment People back to make my appointment to go in. i registered and searched their site and there are plenty of nice places in my range in andersonville, edgewater and lakeview, many with hardwood floors and dishwashers and the like. not sure about utilities and parking for most of them though. and the apartment people dont give you the addresses or square footage until you meet with them and agree to see some places. but its a free service so... what the hell.

i started pricing notebooks at dell.com, gateway.com and hp.com. they are all reasonably close in most areas, but in other areas they are all over the place. they all seem to have base prices around $600. dell and gateway are both including free wireless cards in most models and hp has many more options/accessories for less but no wireless card. im so torn...

eek. i gg to sleep since i work in the morning and then i have to get steven from the train again so he can try and get my moms yahoo/dsl to work... but then we can go out and do something since i have saturday as my paid holiday since i worked all of the 4th of july weekend, including the 4th itself.

oh, also- i need input from people as to when in mid-august is good for a bbq. let me know if you have work, school, vacation, etc. so i can try and plan it when as many people as possible can come. i may even be inviting my dad, stepmom and sisters. eek. please let me know asap. thankyouthankyou."

then we rode back and just stopped in front of a random house and decided we wanted to go swimming so we rode our bikes over to vicki's house and got some water then josh met us over there bc he had to go home to get his bathing suit then we sat in vickis backyard and drank water...after that we rode our bikes back to alexs and went swimming

that was fun of course and we mostly fought over the tubes with josh and alan lol

"event","SO MUCH FUN TODAY

well first i went to alexs at about 1:00 and then about 15 minutes later vicki rode her bike over. then we went swimming for a little bit, got cold, went inside. then we went on the computer and talked to josh. we told him to go over alans house. lol alex n vicki-hey alan can josh come over? nooo im playing with joe. the little josh? haha nooo josh szypa! that was a fun phone convo. so then we invited josh over and we went outside to wait for him and we're like alan josh is coming over. really? yeah. seriously? YEAH haha then we see him turning the corner on his bike. and we started playing dodgeball boys vs girls and that was very fun!! vicki's purple ball haha. then we went swimming. josh n alan kept tipping me n alex over on the tube. and marco polo haha when i tagged josh. i like dove for him. lol...then we made a whirl pool..no we did the whirl pool before the marco polo game but w/e. that was funny-alan was so into it then we played GOOFY and that was fun. type of dog...white black grey and fat haha then tv channels, josh-home economics lol 

then we went underwater to scream at eachother lol

after that we got out and talked about school lol. he was superman for halloween!

after that we went in the front and played dodgeball again. and i tried riding vickis bike...dude that thing is messed up haha. after that i took josh's bike around the block and when i came back alans like what took you so long did u go to 711 lol then he wouldnt pick u p vickis favorite ball so i was gonna get it but alan threw it so i had to chase it down. lol it kept rolling down the street since it was so windy.


then after awhile at about 6:30 vicki and josh left. josh left first then we rode our bikes with vicki to where she had to go. she had to go to the cross walk but it was so funny bc she was so scared so me alan n alex were yelling at her to go haha then when she was across the street we were yelling at her so that she would go online after so we know she didnt die lol and im like watch out for cars but it was so loud bc it was a main road so shes like what?!??! haha

then when we got back to alexs alan stayed for a little while later and we sat on her driveway and talked about random stuff. like computers,keyboards, broken arms, tornadoes...and stuff like that lol then we looked at pictures from the wedding alex went to in california. after that alan had to go bc he had to eat then i left at around 7

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P><BR>bo was sick i think bc he kept coughing and he didnt do tht good--then he started crying while he was thanking the band and then just started getting all choked up hehe and since he broke his leg while he was singing sweet home alabama he was trying to walk around and he was limping and like he always does-carrie the microphone stand around with him lol</P>
<P>nikko danced-he did the moonwalk and stuff and he was really good he threw his st louis hat in the crowd-man i which he threw it to me lol i looove him</P>
<P>anthony was good-yeah he was really good he sorta went into the crowd and just stood&nbsp; in front of these girls the whole time he sang lol but yeah he was EXCELLENT</P>
<P>jessica opened up the show-she was realllllyyy good </P>
<P>scott did good too hes like, i would dance but if i fell i would kill everyone in the first row lol he was funny-with the other things he said...then him n jessica sang a duet and they did veryyy good</P>
<P>nadia was good-i think outta everyone she did the worst- i mean she wasnt BAD it just wasnt as good as the other ones i guess-but she had this outfit that looked like it was a skirt and jacket then when the next song started she unzipped it and it was one piece and there was another outfit under it lol</P>

<P>constantine-um ok i could careless how he did-but ppl were cheering so loud for him and i was so amd =/ lol i dont like him...he did pretty good i guess but his hair was in his face the whole time and he looked like a monster or something-then he almost fell lol thts what he gets for trying to show off</P>
<P>carrie-she came out last but she did very good. she sounds so much younger when she talks when u see her live rather than on tv-she is a VERY GOOD singer!!!!!! omgsh i wish i got her autograph lol it seemed like she sang less songs than bo but she sang the same-sinwagon, alone, independence day, and inside your heaven-but toward the end of inside ur heaven the other contestants came out and started singing</P>
<P>(^^that wasnt the order in which they performed i just felt like doing it that way^^)</P>
<P>and then bo and carrie sang bless the broken road and that was veryy cute!! they played their guitars but bo just kinda had his arms resting on the guitar-it didnt look like he was playing it llol oh well he was ill</P>

"event","Goodnight"" he said. 

""Daddy"" she called ""Do you love me??""

""What? of course i do.. why would you say that?"" her dad said.

""A lot?"" she asked

""A lot."" he said and kissed her goodnight once again. It wasnt until he was half way out the door when she blurted

""Daddy if you really love me a lot you wont be mad about what im going to tell you..""

""What? What's wrong? Is everything...-"" her dad said worried

""Mommy.."" she said clutching her fathers arm ""Mommy is gone.. the bad man hurt her.""

Her father was tense now. He pushed his daughter away
""Nonsence"" he said ""Your mother is away at grandma's""

""No daddy, shes not. She came home last night early and the bad man came in with the shiny"" she said now heavily breathing, holding back the tears

There was a sudden silence

""Sometimes i see the bad man.. he comes and tells me stories when you're working late and mommy's gone to bed."" she continued ""But last night he was mad..""

""You are sure of this?"" he asked

""Yes, shh.. the bad man comes tonight""

""Stop this! Where is your mother? he cried

She closed her eyes as tears ran down her cheeks. ""Mommy's in the closet""

Her father eyed the closet in disbeleif. He shakily walked over and slowly..slowly.. turned the knob

It was then that the window cracked open just a bit... and the large, bloody fingers creeped through...
""Daddy"" she whispered ""He's back""

2 hours later a friend of hers asks her to go for a drive ...she goes.....

her friend swerved to avoid a truck....hitting a tree instead

her friend was killed instantly....shes in critical condition


This is the conversation between her sister and her boyfriend

Sister: omg ( crying )
Boy: what? whats wrong ?
Sister: my sister...your gf was involved in a major car wreck
Boy: is she ok ? ?????
Sister: shes in critical condition
Boy: i'll be there in 10 minutes


He shows up to the hospital room ...standing outside the door
going over the last conversation in his mind over and over as he
heard the machines beep and beep and breathing tubes pump


Boy: she wanted to give me something or tell me something
Girls mom: yeah this...

it was an envelope smelling like she did sealed with a kiss in lipstick

he opened it.....

it said ..... your everything to me....i love you with everything i am
and everything i have...i want to spend the rest of my life with you

sealed in it was a ripped movie ticket from the first movie they went to

and the first picture they took together

he kissed the picture as a tear fell from his face onto the picture

it looked as if in the picture she was crying

then the machines flatlined....3 minutes later she was pronounced dead


If you have any heart...any soul...or want to be happy you will repost this.
if you care for someone ...do not let something like this ever happen

Post this in the next 200 seconds and you WILL have THE best

day of your life THIS SATURDAY. You're number one *love* Will

either kiss you, ask you out, or call you or better. If

you break this chain you will have a lousy day on Saturday, and

you know you can."

"event","definitely had ALOT of fun at the shock game with alex

well first my mom dropped me off at her house then we drove over to the torey's and watched tv there for like 2 minutes then they drove us to the shock game-on the way there we watched some of the pacifier-def. a cool movie

when we got there we got our food then went to our seats. then the dancers came out and we were like screaming ambers name and shes just looking around waving at random places haha i love that girl-then she finally found us. then she started to fight with the shock's mascot haha that was funny. 

when the game started every time there was a timeout me n alex would jump up (while they played music) and start dancing so we could get on the screen but they never showed us =/

then they made the fans stand up and the dancers ran around with boxes of pizza and whoever was screaming the loudest they would give em too and so before they started amber looked up at us and like practically said she was gonna give us em (she nodded her head lol) so we were trying to scream really loud so we didnt look like we got the pizza for nothing-but we werent that loud lol but she still gave us the pizza hehe love u amber <3

then they ended up losing =(

oh yeah! there was this like depressed guy sitting in front of us and he was SO weird. he was a grown man and everything but omgsh. rachael was trying to make a hat out of a balloon but it popped and he looked back us and i could see him staring at us in the corner of his eye..freaky. then he moved and a little while later rach saw him sitting on the other side of the court...haha he hated us

and then this girl who was leaving early gave nikki this ticket that allowed her to get one autograph from a shock player so she did that.

when we left we went back to the torey's and just stayed in there front lawn while the parents talked and there was this frog and drew picked it up then it jumped on him then jumped away then a little while later me n alex were afraid we were gonna step on it so we like ran to the car and nikki was like, ur stepping on it! i freaked out lol then alex said it to me again and i still freaked out so i said it to her and she freaked out...hehe 


then mrs sandy drove me home and my bro said we rented the pacifier so i watched from where we left off in the car

now im really tired so i think im gonna lay in bed and watch tv

absolutely cant wait until tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =D

"event","well yesterday was fourth of july

so me my sister n my bro want to get some of the neighbors and play baseball like we usually do ok? so we go and nobody and i mean NOBODY is home...frank was at the beach theo n mary were up north and sarah n aaron were in ohio...ok so we thought yesterday would suck

we had a bbq..with nobody i knew. they were all my grandparents friends =/ the best part was the food--but then theo n mary came home so we played with them that took up time then it got dark

so fireworks were going off n such and then sarah comes home!! yess my boredom has ended..so we went to theos garage and watched fireworks...it just had to rain

then mary stole her bros bottle rockets and we went in there backyard and started lighting em off but then mary..who doesnt know much about fireworks..lights one up (while me n sarah are in the shed) and has it pointed to the shed. if you didnt know, bottle rockets shoot out of the bottle. so me n sarah are freaking out bc the bottle was right in front of the shed door and we couldnt get out and we thought it would like catch the shed on fire! but then mary kicked it and it was facing my backyard. im like face it to ur house! my dogs are more valuable lol yeahh it was fun




oh yeah and florida was fun too...theres one story i have to tell:

ok so while we were in florida we went out to eat and there was this realllllyyy hott waiter (but he wasnt waiting our table--darnit) so michelle and lauren tried getting pic of him but couldnt bc he was never in the right spot or w/e. since i couldnt see him from where i was sitting i had to turn around to look at him and he saw me like practically staring at him (hes like 18) then a little while later while michelle was trying to take his picture he saw her with her camera at him!! hahahaha so lauren n michelle wouldnt stop laughing then at the end of the dinner he came over to our table and gave me lauren n michelle roses-made out of paper. yeah it sounds tacky but come on! they were so detailed and looked real (besides the color of it) omgsh it was soo funnny...anyway just thought i'd share that

"event","finally the last week of school

we had our awards thing today-i only got 4. i was sooo tired today at school i cant believe they made us have classes

math-did a pointless wkst. i was totally out of it. i had a stuffy nose and a really bad head ached

ss-i asked mrs francuck if i could call my mom to see if she could bring me medicine but she said she'd just pick me up so i went home.

i came home watched some tv then slept for awhile.

then i woke up and i was freezing and i was all pale so i went to my bedroom and slept there but when i woke up i was hott. w/e

then i came back downstairs and watched some tv then i layed on the couch and decided i should update my lj.

i might not come to school tomorrow either if i feel like this

cant wait until tomorrow
carrie's single comes out (me n amber are getting it ;) )

so thats all...gonna go lay down again

"event","<P>i dont remember what we did yesterday at school...what i do remember was that it was so fricken hott and i cant wait til summer vacation</P>
<P>well when i got home from school i had to babysit and so when i got there the mom had to leave rite away bc there daughter had a dance recital but then the dad didnt leave til later so i just sat there and watched tv...so when he left it was just me with this little hyper 1 year old</P>
<P>so the baby (anthony) was being good watching sesame street but then he decides to run to the door and bang on it and turn the knob to try to get out and he was like crying n stuff so im like stop, you know? and he had his pajamas on so i didnt want to let him out but he wouldnt stop so i just held him and went on the porch with him and he was good but then i took him back inside and he was SCREAMING. i swear i have never heard a baby cry as loud as he did so on my sisters cell phone the ring tone is hokey pokey so i turned that on and he started dancing so i was like ok this is good but then he started crying again so i got him milk and he was quiet the rest of the time</P>
<P>then today i slept as long as i could bc i had to be at their house again at 12:00 and babysit again (the girl had another recital) but the dad didnt go this time he just did yardwork so i just played with anthony (the baby) and so i went in the backyard where the dad (and two other ppl (friends) were) and he told me that i could just sit down n didnt have to watch him bc they had him so i was like ALRITE lol but then for at least a half hour anthony kept walking in and out of the house, its a sliding door so i guess he finds that awesome. but then i gave him a banana and he squished it in his hands i was like omgsh! he had banana every where but that got cleaned up. but the mom left at intermission so i wasnt there long</P>
<P>now im gonna go take a shower</P>

<P>in the afternoon we had all our classes in the cafeteria. i finished my cycle but i didnt want to read it to the whole grade. </P>
<P>then i came home and my bro and alexs bro had golf lessons and we went to the beach and saw this like dead fish or something in the water and so me n nikki were trying to get it with a stick or somehing bc it was in the water (out of our reach) so then we realized it was a shell but it was kinda big and it had like two holes (one on each side) so were trying to get it then my mom comes and goes what are you doing? were like trying to get that shell and shes like, thats a ducks head. OMGSH i seriously freaked out. when u looked closely you could see the beak and the two holes were its eye sockets but it had no eyeballs. and it was just the head! i like ran outta there. then a bird pooped on my moms nose. lol </P>

Thanks for being such a great friend and a even more amazing person with a heart the size of Texas and California both put together. I am finally over certain people that brought me down to my lowest. It was all a learning experience for me and hopefully I will NEVER make the same mistake. It still hurts on some days, but i guess shes happy in what she does. So I still need a job, but I think I got one cause I ROCKED on my interview! I love this girl and she loves me!"

"event","So only three more days until I wil be returning to Houston. It feels weird that I am putting all this behind me. I am gonna miss you so very much. I know that I pushed you away in every way possible, but that is what love does. It pushes you to the edge for the other person. I gave up every last thing I had for you, just wanted to let you know. I let every person walk out of my life, cause all i needed was you. I still love you and probably always will even though i know you are in someone elses arms.

Seriously why cant i just take you to another counrty and be happy with you. Seriously I treated you like a princess and you treated me like a toad. Mixed emotions flying everywhere. What am I trying to prove to you anyway. You have Jason, Brad, Austin,...ect, and you dont need me. At least deep down inside you know that there is a lving caring sensitive guy that would have probably did anything for you. But wait you always wanted that right? WRONG as soon as it comes out you are like WTF who are you and i dont give a shit about you. Go ahead a spill your heart cause i am about to put my foot through it. Be numb to everything and just imagine in a couple of days i will be gone out of your life forever. I bet deep down inside you are laughing and having  party so you can be FREE?"

"event","So i found out how much my tuition is going to be this semester. An overwhelming 6,125 USD. In fact I have been rejected for every scholarship that I have applied for, bank loans, and even financial aid. It seems like every resource is dry. My dad doesnt sound to excited to put out money for my education. It is not even that big of a deal, but that was one of my life goals was to be the one in my family that would graduate from college and be something. I dont want to just pass by with money, I dont want that to be an issue. I want jobs fighting for me cause I have the skills needed. I think I am at a valley in my life. So I am trying to accept the fact that I might have to take a semester or even a year off of school. I am going to miss everything and everyone. I havent told anyone yet, so if you read this you are among the first. I can probably get a job delivering medical supplies and save alot of money. I WILL finish!"

Not sad in a tear kinda way...wait yes it was, but it made me be so appreciative of the things that happen. I felt like loving everyone after wards, and it makes me want to be a better person. I know I am mean sometimes, but I have good reasons. no i dont. i have just been dealt a bad hand recently. anyways yeah it makes me love my dad even more cause his dad died in the movie. it makes me sad, cause my pops is getting old to and i am gonna have to deal with it eventually. everyday is not guaranteed so i have to take advantage of all the wonderful people in my life and that are so important to me. thanks for putting up with a lot of my stuff! i know i have a brighter outcome than yesterday!

"event","So no matter how bad I want it gone, she has a piece of me. A piece that I thought was in my hands. I really wish it didnt end on these terms. I guess it is payment for the past. It is just that there are so many memories here, and I cant get away. I am thinking of leaving school for a semester or two. Everything that could have gone bad did. I am in debt up my ass, wrecked my car, am lost in life, my financial aid was rejected, ive been drinking way too much, but still dont feel happy.I want answers! I want to know truth! Cold hard flat out truth! What if all this time I wanted truth and there is none. Only a persons morals and understanding to live by. It makes no sense to me. Geez I miss mom. Eight months and youd think I'd feel better. Having dreams of her here, then waking up and her be gone again Does it ever end. I could have did more, maybe if I prayed harder, or if I hadnt been caught up in the world. I need a mothers love, and you cant find that just anywhere. She knew all the right answers to say and the best advice. She was just and pure. I still remember the laughter, her loud voice, her smell. Oh what I would trade just to hold her again, or have her caress my hair till I fell asleep. anything would do."

It is because you are greedy for attention, that is the answer. I dont owe you anything. At times like these I am glad all this happened.

It feels like the weight of the world is pressing down on me, but I WILL come out of this. I was listening to Casting Crowns today before my chem lab and the song Extravagent Love came on and I almost started crying. Where have I gone to? It is so hard to turn back to God and know with out a doubt that he will take me back. I know he will, but have I gotten lost so bad that he doesnt recognize me anymore. Please say no! If I only had a person that has wore the shoes I tread around in. I am dying from the inside out. Please come rescue me JESUS!"

Maybe she will  finally be happy, maybe. I had a great weekend. Lilian came to SM on friday and we ate at Mamasit's talked a whole lot. We were bored so we went to the hooka! It was her first time, so it was intersting. Sat. me and some boys from good old Falls went out for the night. It was really fun. We went to the ATO house, it got busted up after only being there for like 45 minutes, went to Gordo's for some dancing. After that, I ran into Olga and they were having a after-party at the Ridge. So many people were there, and they had 5 kegs! Stayed there for a bit then went to Sagewood for another get together, but it was all rednecks so i felt out of place. Went back to the Ridge and ran into Roni. Went back and called it a night. All together, I am home safe and no one died! Great!"

1. My mom died. 
2. I turned 19..so young. 
3. Dropped Pre-Cal
4. Have only 20 meal trades and there are 41 more days?
...does that mean i only eat every other day?
Yeah my life is taking a drastic change in both good and bad. I am becoming stronger as a person, but weaker in christ. I miss being close to God, but dont know how to get out of all the junk that i put myself in. I just want to change cities and school and names and gender....did i say gender? It is so complicated to tell people who dont know christ what i want to do, and i sounds so weird when saying it to a regular person. ""I wanna become a worship pastor in music and hopefully a youth pastor and change lives o teens and young people and send them out to preach the gospel in every nation for christ."" Their first response is..""What is worship, then do they get paid good."" If they only knew the places that God has taken me from, then they will know why I desire the desires i do. I know what i am doing is wrong, and know what i need to get rid of, but the battle between flesh and spirit continues. I think i should have been on the bible, it would make a great chapter when it finishes!

I got a ticket for speeding, then the cop was like ""Can i see you liscense?"" Shhizznat....i left it in my room back in TX State. So the cop was like no liscense= no driving. He called a freaking tow truck and my car got towed! I had to call my dad and tell him that i got a ticket and the car got towed. He is like 100 miles from me, so i have to wait for one of the people from my church to come get me. While sitting like a bumb by the pay phone I calculated about how much it is going to be. 

1. Towing Fees-         168.30
2. Speding 86 in a 70-  179.00
3. Driving w/o liscense-161.00

By this time, i was like crap i havae 7 dollars in my account and how am i gonna pay for this...Drugs? maybe. The people from my church come get me and take me to get my car and thank GOD for CHRISTIAN people, they are so nice and giving. They pull out their credit card and pay for the towing fees! Here come the real sucky part. They came konwing that my mom is in the hospital. She has cancer and pneomia, so the pump all the fluids out of her lungs to do X-Rays andthey find cancer all over her lungs. She has until tonight to live or maybe tommorow. It gets worst my little brothers b-day is tommorow. He is turning 6. I feel like dying! NOW!"

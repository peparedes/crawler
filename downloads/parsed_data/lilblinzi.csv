Welp I got my hair permed and I really like it.  Ash I agree...I look better with curly hair.  Tonight was soo much fun at work.

It felt cool bc I have only worked 3 times and this was my first time actually waitressing...yay!  I still have lots and lots to learn but I like it.  School is going really well too by the way.  I am starting to be able to talk to Justin a little more which makes me happy...**smiles**!  He is too cute!  Anyways nothing new is really going on in my life.

It was horrible. I am toooooooo tired tonight....makes me sad.  Welp...Orli called me tonight and that cheered me up a little.  He is too cute and I miss hanging out with him.  On the other hand, I think it is best if we don't hang out too much.  With work and school I don't really need any more distractions.  Ahhh I already have a huge distraction........Justin from New York.  He is toooo cute and my mom enjoys teasing me about it.  ""Linds he's looking at you....ohh he just smiled.  Awww go Lindsey!""  ahhhhh its not cool guys.  Makes me sad.  Anyways I have a hair appointment tomorrow.  I am getting my hair permed.  This really nice women came in and she owns a salon and said she would cut my hair and perm it for 45 bucks since I am such a good waitress.  I think she was trying to make me feel better..lol.  Well I guess I am going to go to sleep now.  I love you all though!"

My brother is in A LOT of trouble.  My mom is freaking out.  Everything is just sooo gay.  Today is Ashley's birthday and her, Angie, Erin, and Nessa are all in ybor at the clubs celebrating.  I was supposed to hang out with them but I told them I wasn't allowed to go to ybor and they went there soooo whatever.  I talked to Steven tonight.  It is weird......now that we are not together we can actually have a civil conversation.  Hell we actually talk.  We never talked when we were together...we had one screwy relationship.  He made me feel better tonight...he made me laugh.  It kinda reminded me of how we were back when we first started dating in October.  Good memories.  Whatever....its over I know it, he knows it and I guess it is cool to be able to talk with out there being weird tension between us.  I like it.....it will never happen again but whatver.  It's life!!  I feel like shit....I'm gonna go.  Love ya lots"

Josh and Lance hate each other and were arguing...etc so we bounced.  Josh went home I guess and the rest of us went cruisin.  I drove Tiff's car.  We decided to go to the beach so that is what we did.  Tiff stripped...lol.  Her and her albino sea turtles....what a gay!  Well we went swimming for awhile and then we took Beau home and went back to Nessa's house.  I had fun though...dancing on tables, watching Tiff rape poor Jen, etc.  It was funny...lol.

"event","WOW....these past two days have been great!  Friday night I went to the Rodeo with Bree so she could see Andy.  It was hmmm...kinda boring.  Levi pissed me off and burned me on the arm with his damn cigarette.  ASS!  Well we were there for like an hour then bounced and went to BCBs.  When we got there we went inside and chilled for a few minutes and when we walked back out...Levi had parked his fuckin truck behind me...blocking me in so we couldn't leave.  IT was SO GAY!  Andy and him were being jerks...for seriously!  So we hung out with Calvin...he is a cutie!  Finally after Levi and Andy left we kidnapped Calvin and started to head off towards Bahia.  Tiff called so we picked her up too.  We had lots of fun.  We went swimming in our clothes in the dark and it was funny.  We were there for a long time and then finally left around 12:30.  Calvin and I...well he is cute and I was really mean yesterday.  OK OK yesterday was the bestest ever!  Bree, Andy, Beau and I all went to the rope swing in Sun Dance.  We had a blast.  My boobies are bruised thanks to Beau and his oh so deadly pinch he has goin on.  FUCKER!  SOOO CUTE THOUGH! My Orli called and wanted to hang out but I was with them and didn't have room in my car....tear!  So I told him we would hang out later on that night.  Well after we left the rope swing we took Andy home and then picked up Calvin.  So now it was me, Bree, Beau, and Calvin.  ahhhh that was weird...lol.  I have huge crushes on both guys!  Just crushes but still.  We went to Bahia and went swimming again.  HMMM two hotties without shirts all wet and glistening....it was a beautiful thing!  Beau kept drowning me and dunking me and I was a happy girl.  I had fun!!!  He bit the shit out of me...can't complain though....muahahahaha!  We all ended up getting into a huge sand war and I got my ass kicked naturally since Beau is on the damn baseball team at school.  Hmmm I was not talkin to Calvin very much and he was acting weird.  Bree says it was bc I was all over Beau and was being mean.  She is right...but I had my reasons damn it!!  Well after awhile we bounced and dropped the guys off at Beau's house and made plans to hang out with them later on...((forgot about my Orli)).  Well anyways later on last night Bree and I went and picked up Beau, Calvin, and Mike.  ahhhh surrounded by hotties!  Crazy I tell ya!  It was interesting to say the least.  We all went to BCBs and hung out.....then me and Mike took Bree home and then went back to BCBs.  I hung out with all of them and then we were going to leave and then Orli and Brad showed up so I talked to them for like 15 minutes.  I was supposed to hang out with them but I had to take the other guys home...hmmm...oh well.  We had lots and lots of laughs last night.....great day great day!  Welp I can't go into too much detail, I am running out of time so I must go...love ya!"

It started to pour and we really wanted to play in it so we bounced and went to Apollo Beach park.  We played in the rain for a long ass time....it was great.  We did our thing...bitch about guys and all the drama that comes with ""crushes"" and whatnot.  What gays I tell ya!  Hmmm I have a problem...I really like Orli you guys.  I don't wanna but I do.

"event","Ok....so I need to catch you guys up.  The 4th was amazing....till the end.  Bree came over after church and chilled with me.  I was PMSing and that made me really sad.  We drank our special drinks and were feeling pretty good.  We laughed a lot......my sister is one funny hoe.  Then later Nessa came over and made me all happy like and so did Tiff.  I had all muh gurls wit me!!  We chilled at my house, danced around for awhile molesting each other....lol....then we bounced.  Daniel called and asked me to come see him so we did.  When we got there he decided to shoot fireworks at his little brother....meanie.  Well we were kinda bored so we left.  We were going to go to a party but decided not too.....so I called Daniel and told him we weren't going to meet him there.  Welp we decided to go to Channelside.  We had sooo much fun on the way there.....we got hit on, hit on some hotties, busted guts and just had a blast.  Once we got there we had to walk like 3 damn miles to find Shawn, Steven, and James.  We weren't there too long before we all got bored and bounced once again. Well well well......we then got lost in Tampa for like 2 damn hours.  We went in circles.....FUCK THOSE DAMN STREET SIGNS!!  They lied to us!!  We had fun getting lost together though....in the meantime Daniel called and wanted to know what we were doing.......after we told him we were not going to Danielle's he decided not to go and wanted us to hang out.  So that is what we did.  All for of us gurls and Daniel, Scott, and Alex all went to a  park and chilled.  They guys drank while us gurls chilled.  Nessa drank too.......she's a pro!  Welp Tiff started feeling bad and everyone was tired and cranky so we bounced around 2am.  Tiff really scared the shit out of us but it is all good.  Well here is what happened....told by Tiffany.....

All I remember was Lindsey saying ""stay with me"" over and over. I dont remember getting out because I almost passed out while driving. I dont remember Scott stopping to check if I was ok. I dont remember anything. I had to hear it all from them. I was breathing so hard...I remember that. And then apparently I stopped. I lost consciousness and I didnt breathe. My eyes rolled back. Still no breathe. I dont know what happened but something brought me to. But it was no use. For the next 30 minutes I was in and out of consciousness. Lindsey was a pro bc she has been dealing with this with me since 7th grade. Bree kept me laughing and talking about how Jon bit me..lol and Vanesa was a mean driving machine. I still feel weak. This one was one of the worst ones Ive had in a while bc I cant remember a thing. I realized something though. Those girls are like family to me. I practically died and they were with me til the end. I love you guys....
 
 
 Tiff we all love you too!  Even though that crap was scary it really did bring us closer together.  We had soo much fun together that night gurls.  We really did get closer!  I love you guys tooooo much really!  I would die without any of you.  That's right....all of you.....Tiny, Crissy, and Samantha!  hahaha......lol.   Welp after we got back to my place we all just talked about cute guys and bonded a bit.   Man gurls we can really have some wacky conversations that early in the morning!  Well I guess I am going to go for now...love ya lots!"

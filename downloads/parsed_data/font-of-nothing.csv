"event","So...  I cheated a couple of nights ago and watched Conversations with Dead People.  While I was watching it, I knew that this episode was coming up, so I made a special point to notice Jonathan.  In CWDP, he was saying how he missed high school and how he cared about all the people from high school.  Kind of full-circle for this episode. 

Nice to see Buffy wearing some practical patrolling clothes such as trackpants.  

And Wesley makes a score!  Ha!  I love how the Wesley character develops.  He's one of my favorites in ATS.  I love his dark site-  with Lilah.  And also how he betrays Angel. I mean, sure, its disastrous, but it shows his strength.  

Hah.  School paper has obits.  

You know, the whole Wesley/Cordelia flirtation is inappropriate.  As is Angel and Buffy.  I mean, I'm certainly not the morality police, but Buffy's 17 and she's involved with a.... what's Angel now?  239 or so?  

Angel just said, ""No matter what, I'll always be with you.""  At least for 10 more episodes or so.  

I haven't read Othello, so I'm not sure if I'm getting all these references.  I think that it's probably a reference to Angel and Angelus-  how together, they complete the whole person.

""I've been with dozens of girls like her.  More""  Heh.  Damn.

Angel just said he's 243.  My guess was pretty good!  I actually saw some of the ATS Angel in there- when he said, ""I am funny.""  

I like how that one girl is always thinking that she hates Buffy.  Haha.  Man, it really would suck to hear people's thoughts.  Jonathan just though, ""Am I normal?""  

Xander just totally guessed the lunch lady and everyone ignored him.  Nancy is the girl who hates Buffy.  haha.  Buffy said she's scary.

How did this episode time out with Columbine?  It was before, right?  Maybe around the same time.  It happened when I when I was like 20, so that was like 1998.  I guess Earshot was after Columbine, according to my scientific calculations.

Is Willow planting the idea in Jonathan's head?  

Apathy on the rise, No one cares.  :)

Larry's out, now?  Haha. I love how he thinks that Xander is gay.  Funny.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  

I love how Angel and Spike or whoever, use that old burlap sack to cover themselves in the sun.  Looks like it's always the same one.

Wow.  Buffy has been really casually dressed in this episode.  I like it.  It's interesting how you know.. really terrible things can be happening and she still manages to dress beautifully, but not this episode. I always figure that she picks out her outfits for the week in advance, so that no matter what's going on, she's wearing something cute.  I keep meaning to lay out all my clothes for the week on Sundays.  Maybe I'll do it tonight.

When I had this revelation in my life- that no one really thought about me much at all, it was so freeing.  It's like when you are young, your brain hasn't learned that the world doesn't revolve around you yet, so you think that everyone is just sitting around judging you, but really most people are so caught up in themselves and their problems, that they don't think about you at all.

I love the furniture in the Sunnydale High School cafeteria.  Nice mid-century modern design.  

Hahahahaha.  ""What am I St. Buffy?  He's like three feet tall!""  So mean!  

I'm suprised that Giles and Joyce didn't have more sex.  I mean, why not?  They would have been a great couple."

"event","OMG.&nbsp; How can they not be having sex?&nbsp; There's no way I could resist Angel.&nbsp; Also, I mean, I love Buffy, don't get me wrong, but I really don't see what Angel sees in her.&nbsp; I mean, the Angel we know and love probably really wouldn't be so into a high school girl.&nbsp; 

Interesting case of Buffy letting a demon go.&nbsp; Seems like we're starting to get a little more gray area.

So, Faith goes to Angel for help.&nbsp; But it's a set-up.&nbsp; But that's the basis for their later friendship, right?&nbsp; 

I'm not feeling very writey today.&nbsp; More watchy.&nbsp; The girl makes Gadot look punctual.&nbsp; Haha.

So, why do those the mayor want Angel to lose his soul?&nbsp; Just because he is diabolically evil?&nbsp; 

Love how Buffy just leaves school to go talk to her boyfriend.&nbsp; I mean, I understand leaving school to go fight evil, but to talk to your boyfriend?&nbsp; That's kind of irresponsible.

So, Angel's faking evil, right?&nbsp; Can't remember?&nbsp; Angelus and Faith are super sexy together, though. 

Aw, Xander called Cordelia CeCe.&nbsp; I like that.&nbsp; 

Hahahahahaha.&nbsp; That's a great scene where Angel hits Xander.&nbsp; Especially since he's not even evil.&nbsp; Heh. 

There are a lot of comparisons of Angel to a dog in this season.&nbsp; Wilow calls him her puppy and Faith just compared him to a dog-&nbsp; something to love.&nbsp; 

Ah, yes.&nbsp; Kill me.&nbsp; Become me.&nbsp; Man, that's the best bit to come out of this episode.&nbsp; 

Why would Buffy need a break?&nbsp; Cause Angel acted evil?&nbsp; Don't get it.&nbsp;"

"event","Ok, prepare to be confused.

First of all, where have a been for the past year and a half?  One thing's for sure, I haven't been watching any Buffy.  Okay, so I may have snuck in an occasional Once More with Feeling or Hush, but no serious Buffiology.  So, forgive me if I'm a little rusty.  

I return to this journal with Doppelgangland, one of the most confusing episodes of Buffy ever, if I recall correctly.  So, here goes nothing.  

Little Anya backstory.  Why does Anya keep going to high school?  I mean, where is she living?  Early Anya is kind of disconcerting.  So different from our real beloved Anya.

Is this the first time that we see D'Hoffryn.  D'Hoffryn is to Anya as the Master is the Darla.  

Snyder just had pictures of kids on his desk.  That's kind of sad.  Since he gets eaten and all.

Heh.  Faith called Wesley Princess Margarette.  Haha.

Man, what a creepy relationship between the Mayor and Faith.  The mayor is to Faith as Giles is to Buffy.  I guess Willow is getting tired of tutoring everyone all the time.  

Hum...  Ok.  Yeah, I'm confused.  Does Anya know what happened in The Wish?  I mean, she wasn't there, was she?  Where was she while all that was going on?  Oh wait.  Giles summoned her, right?  So, I guess she remembers.

Wait.  Didn't Oz kill vamp Willow?  I guess she got sucks out of the alternate universe before that happened.  

Willow isn't nearly as good at being a post-transformation badass as Fred.  

I like how K's Choice is opening for Dingoes Ate My Baby.  You know, Angel and Oz aren't so very different.  I could see them becoming friends.  Maybe Oz should have hung around L.A.  I guess they are maybe too similar though.  Could have made for some boring scenes when both of them just sitting around being stoic.

Heeee.  Willow's being kind of naughty lesbianish with this Sandy chick.  Also, I remember that the Sandy that Willow just ate is the same vampire that Riley meets in the bar later, right?  Although Willow didn't exactly complete the transformation, so how did that happen?

Maybe that's what's happening now, while we're at the library.

Why would vamp Willow be surprised at how normal Willow looks?  I mean, she was her just a few months/years ago.  Hah.  She says that she thinks that she's ""kinda gay.""  Lol.  Man, that was some pretty early Willow is gay referencing.  Well, not really.  I guess she discovers her gayness in the next season.  I wonder if Joss had already decided that Willow would be gay.

Poor Oz.  He's still inside freaking out thinking that Willow is dead.  Does Willow's skirt change in the middle of this episode?  Everyone at the Bronze is acting like they are bored.

Wouldn't Wesley, a grown man, hanging around a high school arouse suspicion?  It's a little creepy.  Especially since he's all lusty after a student.  

Man, Willow just totally punched Anya.  

I bet vamp Willow is all confused by Angel being there and not being her puppy.  If they can send Willow back to alternate universe, couldn't they send Anya back too?  Oh wait.  Cause they don't want her to have her powers back cause then they'd all be dead.  Man, this is so confusing.

Hahaha.  I forgot how that ended.  So funny.  Poor vamp Willow.  I like how she almost drops the F-bomb.  heh."

"event","Sorry it's been so long.  For those that don't know, I'm having some health issues.  Bleh.

Poor Buffy. Always drowning.  

I don't know how Buffy ever sleeps at night.  If I know that demons were real, I don't think I'd ever sleep again.  

Why does Cordelia always have some legit reason to go to the library and no one else does?

Wesley and Cordlia meet.  Sweet.

I remember suspecting that Wesley would be evil when I was watching this.  Heh.

You know, I kind of agree with Faith.  It was an accident, she didn't mean to do it, what good does it do for her to go to jail.  She would never be able to explain why she had a stake and was randomly stabbing people with it.  I mean, I would feel guilty like Buffy, but I don't see why they have to tell anyone.  Okay, maybe Giles.

Faith says that she and Buffy are ""better"" than everyone else.  Hmmm.  I think Buffy agrees with that deep down.  She certainly acts like she thinks that she's better than everyone else a lot.

Buffy's got a new jacket.  

I mean, come on.  Like Giles would believe Faith over Buffy.  I can't believe either Buffy or Faith believed that he did.

How could Xander bang Faith and not tell everyone?  

They take sex really seriously on this show.

Man, I forgot about how Faith almost rapes Xander.  Crazy.  I mean almost kills Xander.  

How humiliating for him to have to be saved by Angel.  

This is an important moment though.  Establishes the relationship with Angel and Faith.  All this S&M talk is kind of explicit for Buffy.  ""vanilla"" and ""safe word.""  Kinky.

It's almost like they make Faith evil.  She accidentally killed someone and then everyone starts treating her like she's a homicidal maniac.  

Man, Wesley really fucked things up here.  

Why in the hell can't Angel get out of that volleyball net or whatever?

Do I really need to point out all the dark slayer stuff?  Good vs. Evil and all that?  I mean, everyone reading this is aware of all those themes, right?  I sometimes try not to talk about the stuff that is kind of played out.  

Okay, so why did Faith save Buffy?  Just out of the goodness of her heart?  Was it her slayer instinct? 

And now begins the creepy Faith/Mayor relationship.  Love it!"

"event","I think SMG hates Eliza Dushku.  It feels like she's the first actress that SMG is kindo of threatened by or something.  

The mayor.  Such a great character.  I love how he's such a neat freak.  So creepy!  Speaking of.... the really uptight woman at my old job kept baby wipes at her desk and they were called ""Tushies Wipes"" and she would always mark over ""Tushies,"" like that was offensive of something.

If I was Willow, I'd be like totally sick of tutoring Buffy.

Wesley!  Wow.  His character changes so much.  

I was thinking about how Alyson and Alexis were meeting during the taping of this episode.  And then I was thinking about how old Alyson would have been and if Alexis were a pervert, but she would have been 26!  She does not look 26!  I'm 28 and there's no way I could play a high school student.  Good for her, though, huh?

This is so cute... how Giles' character has really come around.  Now he's like the rebellious one.  Buffy characters always start out as an extreme, then they come around and then they bring someone else in to replace them...  Giles and Wesley, Cordelia and Anya, Kendra and Faith, and I'm sure there's more... maybe Xander and Andrew?  I hate it when Xander makes fun of Andrew for being a geek...  

Alright, back to the show.

You'd think that after the whole Helpless situation, Buffy would really be done with the council. 

That's a really great moment for Buffy.... when she doesn't drown.  It's like the final stage in getting over the Master incident.

Buffy wearing leather pants!  That can't be good.  Remember what happened when Angel wore leather pants?

Wesley and Angel meet.  

Fat demon.  I think he's just horribly done.  I mean, none of him moves excepts his face and arms.  When he takes he's laboring breaths, you expect to see his body rise and fall.  But no.  Just twitchy arms.  

Wouldn't the cops like all know who Buffy was by now?  

Classic mayor moment, with the boyscouts.  

I wonder why Joss so often makes his bad guys totally useless- like this fat guy jr the Master trapped in the church or the First or the Annionted One...  people that can't do anything, but for some reason they have a whole slew of killer minions.  And why do all these minions dress alike?  Like the Bopsy twins?  

Now Fatih's a killer.

This is a shining moment for Giles.  

""When he rises, you'll wish I'd killed you all.""  Not quite chubby.  That was some ominus shit the first time around though.  

The mayor is made up of suiggley black worms.

Love the mayor's to-do list.  

Wow!  Buffy's wearing the same coat again!  

""No, you don't get it.  I don't care.""  Great Faith line."

"event","This is an awesome episode.&nbsp; So clever.

This episode is all about perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

They're kind of mean to Xander in this episode. They're never that mean to him in other episode, really.&nbsp; Are they always that mean from Xander's perspective?&nbsp; Xander just said that he tested a little slow.&nbsp; Awww.&nbsp; I never thought of him as being slow.&nbsp;&nbsp; And Cordelia's a total bitch.&nbsp; 

Oz is definitely cool.&nbsp; 

This is great.&nbsp; How Buffy and Giles are all dramatic with the dramatic music.&nbsp; 

Xander is totally on the outside of this episode.&nbsp; i mean, Willow and Buffy were just talking about the end of the world and then they barely mention it to Xander.&nbsp; 

How can Xander put the apocalypse out of his head like that?&nbsp; Wouldn't you be a little worried?&nbsp; Does he have that much faith in Buffy?&nbsp; 

So, these zombies that Xander's hanging out with... do they have souls?&nbsp; I know they're dead, but they don't seem evil.&nbsp; I mean, they're bad, but probably no worse than they were when they were alive.&nbsp; 

I remember the first time I saw this sex scene with Xander and Faith I was totall shocked.&nbsp; I mean, this was way beyond what Buffy had ever shown before.&nbsp; Good for Xander.&nbsp; I mean, poor Xander.&nbsp; I wonder how he feels about that whole experience.&nbsp; 

Major Buffy and Angel drama...&nbsp; they're so intense.&nbsp; It's almost like they didn't have the script for this episode.&nbsp; Buffy is kind of making fun of itself in this episode.&nbsp; 

So if&nbsp; Xander just got all his friends out and let the high school explode, I wonder if that would take care of the apocalypse problem.&nbsp; 

Yay!&nbsp; Xander got his cool!&nbsp; I know I spend a lot of time hating on Xander, but I don't really hate him.&nbsp; I only hate him because of what he does to Anya.&nbsp;"

"event","Dude, if Buffy and Angel are trying not to do it, maybe they shouldn't be having candlelit picnics and rolling around on the ground together.&nbsp; If I was Buffy, I'd be trying to find a cure for Angel's curse, or another way for him to get his soul or something.&nbsp; She needs to be thinking outside the box.

I like how the first to go of Buffy's powers is her talent for snappy comebacks.

I can't believe that Giles would do this to Buffy.&nbsp; It's so upsetting.&nbsp; At least he uses an alcohol swab, I guess.

And Buffy's dad sucks.&nbsp; She looks so sad while she all in a trance.&nbsp; 

I guess it's no biggie for the council when a slayer dies.&nbsp; They just get a new one.&nbsp; Plus, this time, they have a spare.&nbsp; You'd think that the council would recognize Faith as THE slayer rather than Buffy since the slayer line goes through her now.&nbsp; 

What kind of pills are they giving that vampire?&nbsp; What are they supposed to do?&nbsp; If they're a blood substitute in pill form wouldn't that be like a major breakthough?&nbsp; Couldn't they use them for Angel or Spike or something?

Angel getting Buffy a book for her birthday kind of makes me think that he doesn't know her very well.

Mr. Pointy reference.&nbsp; 

Have I ever said how much I like Angel's house?&nbsp; It's all concrete and clean lines and modern.&nbsp; I love it.

Finally Angel tells Buffy that he saw her before she was the slayer.&nbsp; She doesn't even ask how or why.&nbsp; If you were Buffy wouldn't you just like be DYING to know how Angel knew that she was going to be the slayer before she was called?&nbsp; How did Whistler know anyway?&nbsp; PTB, I guess.&nbsp; Do the PTB decide the slayer line?&nbsp; 

Disabling a slayer is pretty stupid any way you look at it.&nbsp; I mean, your'e in a fight against evil and you disable your greatest weapon.&nbsp; 

Seeing Buffy like this reminds me of The Grudge.&nbsp; The whole time in that movie, I wanted to scream, ""Kick it's ass Buffy!"" at the screen.&nbsp; 

This Zachary vampire is talking about turning Buffy into a vampire.&nbsp; That would have been a really good idea.&nbsp; To have Buffy fight a vampire that used to be a slayer.&nbsp; I mean, surely, some other vampire has wanted to turn a slayer into a vampire before, right?&nbsp; And surely it's happened before...&nbsp; all the vampires and all the slayers throughout time... 

You'd think Quentin would call Giles Rupert instead of Giles.&nbsp; 

If you were Buffy and you were all weak, wouldn't you have gone to get Angel to help you rescue your mom?&nbsp; He'd be a major asset here.&nbsp; 

Oh, the pills do something else, I guess.&nbsp; Strange that a vampire would need pills for a medical reason.&nbsp; 

Seems like Buffy and Giles would give up the council now instead of later.&nbsp; I think I'd be pretty much done with them after this.&nbsp;"

Joyce.&nbsp; I just love her.&nbsp; She tries so hard.&nbsp; 

Interesting role reversal.&nbsp; Buffy comforting Joyce.&nbsp; 

ooooooooooh.&nbsp; the occult!&nbsp; We all know how members of the ""occult"" go around killing children.&nbsp; 

Amy has dark hair.&nbsp; She doesn't have dark hair anymore when she's deratted.&nbsp; 

I think that this is the first time that we get a clue about how Willow's mom is less than great.&nbsp; 

Funny how Joyce has all this faith in the mayor.&nbsp; In the government.&nbsp; How silly.

""suffered neck rupture.""&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I don't think I ever noticed that before.&nbsp; 

Alright, so Willow and Amy are clearly evil.&nbsp; 

Is this episode supposed to like evoke feeling of McCarthyism?&nbsp; Or the Salem witch trials or what?&nbsp; Obviously it's referencing something but it's just kind of all over the place.&nbsp; Book Burning, Witch burning, oh and fairy tales, of course.&nbsp; 

Hahaha.&nbsp; King Friday....&nbsp; that was a really funny line.&nbsp; 

Ironic how Buffy is questioning what she's done for Sunnydale so shortly after The Wish.&nbsp; ""We fight because there are things worth fighting for.""

Does the red hat on the door mean something?&nbsp; 

And poof!&nbsp; Amy's a witch!

Oz is quite the little hero.&nbsp; 

I wonder why they would have their witch burning inside.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp;

This is stupid, but does it really snow in Ireland?&nbsp; I mean, obviously, it does.&nbsp; But don't&nbsp; you always think of Ireland as being all green and sunny?

Angel has facial hair here.&nbsp; This opens up the whole ""Do vampires grow hair?"" conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, since angel didn't have facial hair when he became a vampire and he does in this episode they do, right?&nbsp; But he doesn't grow a beard when he's locked up under water by Conner for like 3 months.&nbsp; Plus, there's always Willow's question about how would he shave.&nbsp; Thoughts?

I love how Daniel is looking up, praying and Angel looks up where he's looking kind of expecting to see something.

The First was always the most scary big bad to me.&nbsp; I know that he can't really hurt you, but it's just how you can't really see him, or talk to him, or confront him.&nbsp; Or fight him.

Hehe.&nbsp; Joyce is all weird about Giles cause they did it.&nbsp; 

Man, I'd be so happy to open up my door and find Angel standing there.&nbsp; Even if he'd tortured me last year.&nbsp; Maybe especially if he'd tortured me last year.&nbsp; But probably not if he'd killed my husband.

So what are your thoughts about why Angel came back?&nbsp; Did the First really bring him back?&nbsp; Could the first have brought him back?&nbsp; Was it Wolfram and Hart?&nbsp; Of The Powers that Be?&nbsp; 

Dream cameos.&nbsp; 

Everyone always makes a big whoop about how Jenny touches Angel, but I don't think that she actually does.&nbsp; She just put her hand really close to his face.&nbsp; 

""The thing I remember most was thinking how artful is was.""&nbsp; Another death=art.&nbsp; 

""A drunken, whoring, lay-about""&nbsp; Angel as a man.&nbsp; Spike was a better man than Angel.&nbsp; That's one of my favorite topics.&nbsp; Angel versus Spike and who deserved redemption more.&nbsp; Spike was a better man, a better vampire, and even better after he got his soul...&nbsp; 

Okay, The First as Jenny touches him there.&nbsp; 

Bringers are creepy as hell.&nbsp; 

Oz just talked about having a dream about being in a play and not knowing your lines.&nbsp; Like Willow in Restless.&nbsp; I can't believe that Willow and Oz haven't had sex yet.&nbsp; Come on!&nbsp; They' ve been dating like a year.&nbsp; What have they been doing?&nbsp; 

Haha.&nbsp; It's kind of funny when Angel jumps out Buffy's window.&nbsp; 

In this episode, there are three bringers.&nbsp; There are many more in season 7.&nbsp; 

""Alright, I get it!&nbsp; You're evil!""&nbsp; I love that line.&nbsp; This whole conversation.

""Dead by sunrise!!""&nbsp; Arrrrgh!&nbsp; 

This scene with Buffy and Angel is seriously one of the best written scenes in the entire run of the show.&nbsp; It gets me everytime.&nbsp; This whole thing is so honest and profound.&nbsp; Like I just want to quote the whole thing, but ""strong is fighting"" is like my favorite line ever.&nbsp; 

And the snow.&nbsp; This episode is just a classic example of the forces of Good and Evil fighting for a soul.&nbsp; It had to be the PTB that made it snow.&nbsp; This is just a great set up for the entire Angel show.&nbsp; It's like the whole run of the show distilled.&nbsp; Which side will he be on?&nbsp; Is he good or evil?&nbsp; Which side is he on?&nbsp; Who are his allies?&nbsp; He's just a great character.&nbsp; 

By the way, I've been watching a little Angel on the side.&nbsp; It really pains me to say it, but I almost think that I like AtS a little better than BTVS.&nbsp; it's got more depth really.&nbsp; It's less black and white and a little more gray, although Buffy is moving a little more in that direction in it's later seasons as well, with Anya and Willow and Spike.&nbsp; It shifts from being a show where they characters are good but have weaknesses to be a show where the characters are in a real struggle between good and evil and not just externally, but internally.&nbsp;"

Anya.&nbsp; My alltime most favorite amazing Buffy character.&nbsp; So excited.&nbsp; Oh it just makes me cry to think about what happens to her.&nbsp; 

That demon looks familiar.&nbsp; Like maybe we've seen him before.&nbsp; Or we'll see him again?&nbsp; 

Faith hasn't been hanging out much?&nbsp; No shit.&nbsp; I totally forgot that she was even in this season.&nbsp; Good Buffy/Xander/Willow moment. 

Oh yeah, I went to Dragon Con and saw Nicholas Brendon.&nbsp; I was like 30 feet from him.&nbsp; He's pretty much exactly like Xander-&nbsp; not very bright, annoying, doesn't make sense all the time...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also saw Clare Kramer and she was great.&nbsp; Nice and smart and funny and down to earth.&nbsp; 

Oh, and Andy Hallet, who, I'm pretty sure was drunk.&nbsp; He showed up like 45 minutes late with a drink in his hand and barely said anything.&nbsp; 

Alright, back to the show...&nbsp; Poor Cordelia.&nbsp; I really feel bad for her.&nbsp; Stupid Xander.&nbsp; He's such a shit.&nbsp; I mean why wait until Willow is happy with Oz to start being attracted to her?&nbsp; Why do that to everyone?&nbsp; I know that WIllow has some responsibility in all this, but she's always loved Xander.&nbsp; She couldn't help herself.&nbsp; Xander's such a selfish jerk.

yay!&nbsp; So excited about Anya!&nbsp; I like how her a Cordelia hit it off right away.&nbsp; They share such similar fates.&nbsp; Anya looks like she feels bad for Cordelia when Harmony plays that Johnathan trick on her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She does, I guess.&nbsp; Anya is such a complex character.&nbsp; She's so removed from human emotion and suffering, yet it's that suffering that makes her who she is, you know?&nbsp; I love Anya.&nbsp; It just seems like Anya fits in better as a human when she's not a human.&nbsp; Cordelia looks great, but she also look about 28.&nbsp; 

""I wish Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.""&nbsp; 

I wonder why Willow and Xander would have been vamped but not Harmony.&nbsp; That's kind of ironic, huh?&nbsp; 

I like vamp Xander and Willow so much more than real Xander and Willow.&nbsp; Would they really be scared of Gile's big cross?&nbsp; So interesting who the good guys are here.&nbsp; Giles and Oz.&nbsp; And um...&nbsp; Is that Larry?&nbsp; And who's that girl?&nbsp; Cordelia should have remembered who she is so that they could recruit her in the real world.&nbsp; 

Oh, nevermind, Cordelia's dead.

This Willow and Xander killing Cordelia scene.&nbsp; It's very sexual.&nbsp; And very symbolic.&nbsp; 

Cleveland.&nbsp; Is this before or after we find out that there's another hellmouth in Cleveland?&nbsp; 

Why would Angel have come to Sunnydale if not for Buffy?&nbsp; It's interesting how different Sunnydale is without Buffy, but even more interesting how different Buffy is without Sunnydale.&nbsp; She's a lot more like Faith.

Oh, Angel was waiting on Buffy.&nbsp; 

""Death is our art.""

One can only assume that this line is a reference to Sylvia Plath's Lady Lazararus.&nbsp; 

Dying
Is an art, like everything else,
I do it exceptionally well.

Cassie's poem in Season 7 is practically a paraphrase of Plath's ""Mirror.""  One of the writer's must be a fan of her work.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Plath, of course, if talking about suicide in her poem, though.&nbsp; And the master, clearly, is not.&nbsp; But, he is dead.&nbsp; Dead and resurrected.&nbsp; 

It's strange to think about this Master as being the same one that sired Darla.&nbsp; Especially considering his relationship with Angel and how he was actually jealous of him, in my opinion anyway.&nbsp; I guess if Buffy had never come to Sunnydale then Darla would still be alive, right?&nbsp; Or would Angel have killed her anyway?&nbsp; I think that's highly unlikely.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that Buffy is pretty much the only thing that could make Angel kill Darla.&nbsp; So, I wonder where she is.&nbsp; You'd think she'd be all about the Master.&nbsp; 
Anya is so angry!&nbsp; She's not very Anya like. Becoming human seems to just like instantly change her.&nbsp; It makes her funnier anyway.

You'd think that the vampires wouldn't have made the cages out of wood.

Xander stakes Angel.&nbsp; Buffy stakes Xander.&nbsp; Chilling how unaffected Buffy is by either of these events.

Oz stakes Willow.&nbsp; 

And the prophecy is fulfilled.&nbsp; The Master kills Buffy.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; 

So, does Anya not know what happened?&nbsp; She doesnt' remember that it was Giles who destroyed her necklace?&nbsp; I bet she'd be real pissed off about that.&nbsp; This whole alternate reality thing gets really compicated when you think about how none of them even know that it ever happened.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; None of them know.&nbsp; That means that they don't know that Anya was a demon, right?&nbsp; How do they find that out?&nbsp; I can't remember."

Spike!!!&nbsp; yay!&nbsp; 

He says ""home sweet home.""&nbsp; Do you think that he considers Sunnydale home?&nbsp; Such an interesting thing for him to say.&nbsp; Also interesting that he's clearly drunk driving.&nbsp; 

Man, seriously, Oz is so sweet.&nbsp; Not the Pez witch, but the think about her part.&nbsp; So sweet.&nbsp; I'd like DIE if my husband said something like that to me.&nbsp; 

Sure, Buffy is ""chosen"" but over and over again she's given the opportunity to escape and she chooses to remain the slayer.&nbsp; 

Somehow I'd totally blocked out all this Willow and Xander drama. I remembered that they got caught kissing, of course, but I forgot about all the drama leading up to it.&nbsp; 

Haha.&nbsp; So funny how Spike tries to put his hand out under the little fountain trickle first before he sticks it in the pool.&nbsp; 

And again, the magic shop looks TOTALLY different.&nbsp; The front door is all over the place.&nbsp; It was on the left side of the building when Jenny and Dru were there and now it's on the left and then later, when Giles owns it, it's in the middle.&nbsp; 

Spike is being pretty mean to WIillow.&nbsp; This is a lot like the scene later where he bite her when they're in college.&nbsp; Where Oz is trying to hurt Willow and he ends up just whining to her.&nbsp; 

They're all slime and antlers.&nbsp; :)

Ever wonder why Spike doesn't make himself a new vampire girlfriend?&nbsp; Like Willow perhaps?&nbsp; Vamp Willow and Spike would probably get along pretty good.&nbsp; Actually, she'd probably be too mean for him.&nbsp; 

Now Spike and Joyce.&nbsp; I looooooooove them together.&nbsp; This scene is a classic.&nbsp; Where Spike is making scary faces behind Joyce's back.&nbsp; So funny.&nbsp; 

So cute how Buffy and Spike are all bickering and Angel is just ignoring them.&nbsp; 

Whoah.&nbsp; That's a serious set-up that Cordy died.&nbsp; I even thought that she died for a minute even though I totally know better.&nbsp; 

I understand if you're 45 and you break up with some guy because you know it's not going to work out long term even though its great in the short term, but Buffy's like 17.&nbsp; She's got time to waste.&nbsp; I'd stick with Angel for a while."

Oh....&nbsp; Willow and Xander are having guilt. 

There's a little Buffy/Faith sexual inuendo for ya.&nbsp; 

The whole concept of watcherness is a good one.&nbsp; Do they choose that profession?&nbsp; Are they chosen?&nbsp; Are all watchers British?

This makes me want to do Tai Chi with my husband.&nbsp; Buffy and Angel make it so much sexier than those old people in the park.

I think, clotheswise, this is my favorite era of Buffy.&nbsp; I guess that's because I was like 19 or so when this season was on.&nbsp; People tend to get stuck in the era that was happening when they were around 19 or so fashionably.&nbsp; That's my theory anyway.

Why are Buffy and Angel acting like it's so bad for them to kiss and stuff?&nbsp; Are they really that afraid that they won't be able to control themselves?&nbsp; I mean, after why happened last time, I think that I'd probably be able to resist.&nbsp; 

Why is everyone all wigged out about Buffy hiding Angel?&nbsp; Cordelia:&nbsp; What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again?&nbsp; Um, cause it's Buffy's choice who she sucks face with.&nbsp; They should be all happy!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; Angel's back and he's nice again!&nbsp; yay!&nbsp; 

Ugh!&nbsp; Xander and Faith plotting to kill Angel!&nbsp; Stupid Xander.&nbsp; What's his damage?&nbsp; 

Evil!&nbsp; 

Okay, is it just me or does that scene where Gwendolyn hits Giles with the statue totally remind you of the scene in A Clockwork Orange with the penis statue?&nbsp; 

Willow is great here where Buffy is getting attacked and she's all just standing there watching.&nbsp; It's adorable.&nbsp; 

Wow.&nbsp; That was a really bad stunt double for Gwendolyn.&nbsp; 

And Faith and Angel meet for the first time!&nbsp; 

Did Buffy just kill a human?&nbsp; Gwendolyn was a human, right?&nbsp; I mean, she had an evil glove, but she was still a human.&nbsp; 

Okay, yeah, she's a human.&nbsp; Giles just said that she used to be a watcher?&nbsp; She what does that mean? Is it justified by the fact that it was actually the lightening that killed her, even though it was Buffy who cut off her hand and made it happen?"

Buffy gets dumped by Scott.  Ridiculous!  She's way too good for him.  

The Mayor! This is such a great season.  And he's so clean!

Buffy and Faith are going on a date!  To the homecoming dance.  Awww.  

I don't really remember this episode.  

Contemporary American Heroes was Buffy's favorite class.  That's cute.  How could someone not remember Buffy?  She's so..... prominent.

Damn.  Cordelia gets harsh.  

Oh!  That demon is Cosomething from the Meensomething clan.  Like Lorne!  I wonder if he's from Lorne's dimension.

I like Buffy and Xander getting ready together.  They're really sweet.  I secretly always wanted them to hookup.  I mean, I love Willow and Oz and I don't really like Xander, but sometimes Willow and Xander seem so sweet together.  Not to mention the Lisa Loeb song.  Love her.  That crayon speech doesn't make me cry still though.  

I can't believe that Willow would help Cordelia over Buffy.  

Scott is a nice guy.  I don't hate him or anything, but I just didn't like him with Buffy.  I really like Buffy's look in this episode.  Kinda of 50's housewife.  

Man, Cordelia is bitch of the year in this episode.  

And now Xander is interested in Willow!  I REALLY don't remember this episode.  Is it possible that I've never seen it?  Surely not!  Is this the episode where Cordelia catches Willow and Xander kissing?  I've seen that episode.  Is that this episode?

Haha.  Slayer Fest.

Faith says things that are just so out of the normal Buffy range.  Like, ""Are they screwing?"" last episode.  

Cordelia's body is very womanly.  Like not high schoolery.  

Cordelia's hair keeps changing to different levels of curliness.  Like majorly different.

Why would Oz need a feeding overnight?  Seriously, can't he make it from sunset to sunrise without eating?

Nice how Xander doesn't even try to stay awake.

I'm so not attracted to Scott.  Scott doesn't really seem to have a beast inside.  Maybe that's why I'm not attracted to him.  Maybe that's why Buffy is not attracted to him.

Oz's werewolf would have to be pretty freaking smart to get out that window and then get back in.  

Did teachers smoke in school in 99 or whatever?  No way, right?  I graduated in 96 and teachers didn't smoke in school then and I'm in Georgia.  Buffy is in California.  

""Demons can be fought.  People can change.  You can change.""

Man, poor Oz.  He's being so unlike himself.  I just love him.  So witty.  

Holy shit.  Angel.  All growly and shirtless.  

Can you freaking imagine being Buffy right now?  OMG.  I don't know how Buffy could keep that a secret.  I'd be on the phone to Willow in like under 30 seconds if my boyfriend came back from the dead.

Alright, you really can't watch this episode without commenting on the bondage aspects of it.    Angel's all chained up and Oz is in a cage.  

At least Faith stayed awake.  Buffy fell asleep on Oz watch too, and Giles didn't care.  

A world of brutal toment.  Buffy knows that Angel is back, but if she didn't, wouldn't that make her just feel horribly shitty?  That she sent her love to a world of eternal and brutal torment.  That's worse than dead.

Did Buffy just remember at lunch that she left Angel chained up in the mansion?  Did she think that it was a dream?  It was like she was at lunch all ready to eat some jello and then she just remember about Angel.  How could something like that slip your mind.

This is so heartbreaking...  where Buffy is asking for help from the counselor and he's all dead.  

I really don't like the after school special with a supernatural twist episodes.  Like this one about domestic violence.  Or Beer Bad or Go Fish.  I like this episode because of the Angel and Oz stuff going on, but the whole Debbie thing is just filler.  

This episode feels almost anti-man.  All the men, well most, are monsters.  And faith even says in the beginning that all men are animals or something like that.  Being a monster is different than being wild or primitive.

I love the look on Oz's face when Pete attacks him.  He's like so passive, but passive becuase he like knows that he's going to kill Pete.  That werewolf suit still looks pretty ridiculous.  Oz makes little puppy noises when they tranq him.

Oh yeah.  Sexy shirtless Angel in chains to the rescue.  So sweet.

Willow is finally starting to dress cutish.  

Scott Hope.  Isn't he revealed to be gay later?  

Is Happy Burder to same place as Doublemeat Palace?

Mr. Trick is awesome.  His lines are so funny.  ""Makes DC look like Mayberry.""  

I love Buffy dream sequences.  This one is giving me chills.  

Giles is kind of wary about Willow's magic even way back here. 

Our first shot of Faith.  Dancing with a vampire.  Perfect.  Strange how some vampires get stuck in a fashion rut.  I guess if you live long enough you're bound to get stuck somewhere.

Faith is telling all these vampire stories, like she's just been a slayer FOREVER, but really she's just been a slayer for like what, 3 months?  

I know that the council doesn't care much for Giles, but you'd think that since he's like the  watcher of the slayer, he would have been invited.  

Scott Hope is short.  

Kikistos.  I think we touched on this back in season 1 with the master.  But if anyone would like to discuss how vampires age differently and who is older and all that, please go ahead.  All I have to say is that my theory is that there are different demons who can make vampires vampires.  As the vampire ages, the human body becomes more and more like the demon inside of it.  The Master was becoming a bat-like demon and Kikistos is becoming a um...  pig like demon.

Buffy thinks that Faith is creepy.  Just like with Cathy.  Everyone else likes her and Buffy thinks that she's creepy and Buffy's right.  

Now we're talking about why Buffy can't let Faith be the slayer.  Buffy says that the only was you get a new slayer is if the old slayer dies.  Who do you all think that rightful slayer is?  I'd actually have to say Faith.  Buffy died so she's not the slayer anymore?  Is Buffy ""wrong"" to keep acting as the slayer?

Buffy just called Faith her new bestest little sister.  There's some strange connection between Faith and Dawn.  How Faith seems to know that she's coming and all that.  

Faith had a female watcher.  That's really cool.  I wonder if the PTB gave her a female watcher because of her dead mother.

So weird to see Faith running and screaming.  Like really scared.

Buffy just said that the first rule of slaying was ""Don't die.""

She doesn't follow that rule so well herself.  

Trick actually just called Kikistos ""the master.""  Hum.  That's interesting.

Where did the Acathala statue go?  Did like Giles come and cart it off?

And why did Angel come back?  Was is really the First?  Was is Buffy putting the ring there?  Was is Buffy finally letting him go like a set it free type deal?  Or Jasmine?  Or Wolfram and Heart?  What do you guys think?"

What I like aobut this episode is how it's a somewhat accurate portrayal of friendship.  It seems like Buffy and Willow are never really the same after this.  Like Willow doesn't really trust Buffy anymore.  Things like leaving town for months without saying a word damage friendships.  Buffy keeps it real.

Aw.  Sweet Giles.  Now that I'm a little older, I relate to Giles so much more.  Not relate really, but just view him as more of a empathetic character. 

More mayor is evil foreshadowing!  I love this season!  

Buffy is wearing wedges.  

Joyce has some nerve inviting Giles over for dinner when she just totally blamed him for Buffy running away.

I'd be a little more freaked out if I found a dead cat in my basement.  Especially if I lived in Sunnydale.

When that cat is digging it's way up, they should have done a one paw sticking out of the ground shot like they always do when vampires dig their way out.

I love seeing Angel in the sunlight. It always seems weird, even though they find ways to get him in the sun a pretty good bit for a vampires.

Why would you get up at 7am if you didn't have to go to school or work or anything.

Anyone else think that Joyce and Pat might be a little more than friends?  I'm just saying...

Gross body fluids on the burn victim's pillow.

Ok, then.  Here we go.

It's so good of Willow, Xander and Oz o keep slaying event while Buffy's gone.  Trying to slay, anyway.

This whole Oz is still at school thing...  That's lame.  Like how David Silver graduated with the rest of the kids on 90210. They should have just let Oz graduate, but still hang out at school with Willow.  That would have been just fine.

Hum..  So ""Lily"" has the tattoo of Rickie on her arm.  I wonder if she still has that after she's Anne, when she's on Angel. 

This is a strange episode.  It's like Buffy takes on homelessness, religion, and communism.

Poor Joyce.  I guess she's accepting this whole slayer thing now.  
 
People keep calling Buffy a kid or a child in this episode.  

Um...  how about some misplaced anger at Giles?  

I posted once about how this episode was a statement against communism and some people argued back that is was pro-communism.  But given Buffy's general position on government, I'm sticking with anti-communism.  Lily just said that the police would only make things worse.  That's a general theme in Buffy and proves itself try a couple of times.  

I actually think the whole purpose of this episode is to teach us that time passes differently in other dimensions so that when Angel comes back, we can understand that he's been in hell for like years.  

Glad that stake disappeard or else Cordelia would have been a goner.  Do stakes usually disappear?  Turn to ash?  Can't remember.

So here's the fighting with the hammer and sickle.  

It looks like there's a giant crucifix down there.  What's up with that?  Is this another underground church?

"event","I can't believe that this episode is in this season.  I think my biggest problem with it is its placement.  It's just a fluff episode right in the middle of some serious drama.

It's good to see them at the beach though.  They don't go to the beach nearly often enough to be living in California.  I can only remember one other time, when they go in the day with Tara and Buffy and Riley are playing football and then it starts to rain...

Oh, poor Jonathan.  

Oh my gosh!  That's the guy from Prison Break!  I never realized that was him.  I totally gotr suckered in to Prison Break, but then I missed the last two eipsides.

It's always surprising to me how Principal Snyder gives a rat's ass about sports.  He doesn't seem like the type.  

Cordy just said how disgusting Lincoln was.

So why would Buffy go out with this Cameron guy in this episode and not that Ben guy from the last episode?

Did your high school have a steam room?  

That was pretty brave of Xander to stand up to Cameron like that.

If something was killing off a sports team, I would suspect their rival team.

So this episode is about Swampthing and steroids.  It's so a season 1 episode where they just rip off existing horror monsters and teenage stereotypes.  

Jonathan peed in the pool.  Haha.  I wonder if Willow's sugestion that Jonathan drove into the black arts is what started him down that path...

Buffy just said that she's a swim groupie, like Swim Fan, which I never saw.  Buffy's a little slow to react to the screams.  

Is Wentworth Miller British?  He suddenly sounds British.  Oh!  I looked it up and he is!  Awesome!  I totally heard his accent peaking out.  

I don't think Xander is sexy.  Sorry.  I don't like him.  He's an Anya heart breaking bastard.  He has some funny lines, but still....  poor Anya.

Oh, that was a pretty good plot twist.  Even though I've seen this episode before, the fact that they were being eaten by the monster but that they were turning into the monster...  I didn't see that coming.  

You'd think that Buffy and Giles and crew would keep a pair of golashes handy with all the sewer patrolling they do.  

Oh, and now they blame in on the communists.  Haha.  Love Joss.  

Nice.  Love how the coach just throws Buffy into the sewer to be raped by fish monsters.

Okay, that was pretty funny, how Cordy was offering the monster bath toys to improve his quality of life.  

Ugh.  THat makes me want to go swimming in the ocean even less that I already did, which was not much."

"event","Ben.  Hum.  He seems like a nice guy.  

How would it hurt to go to a dance with him?  Buffy always says how she wants to be a normal girl with a normal guy, but she always sabatoges it.

I love how Buffy wears so many cross necklaces.  It's subtle.

It's strange how they use season 1 Buffy in the show opening.  She looks so different from season 2 Buffy.

Poor school janitor.  Can you imagine being the Sunnydale High School janitor?  I wonder how many bodies that dude has found.

We haven't seen Snyder for a while.  

Willow the teacher.  What does Willow end up doing carreer wise?  Didn't she want to be a teacher?  I guess she's still in college when the show ends, but what was she studying? Was that ever said?  

Who is that teacher?  She's been in some other stuff, right?

Hum.  There's a monster in Xander's locker.  

Willow looks like she's wearing pajamas.  

Lochness monster?  Haha.  

OH yeah, this is the sad Giles episode.  

I kind of think this episode should have been called ""Love is forever""  It applies because it is said repeatedly in the dialog and because of Giles still loving Jenny and Buffy still loving Angel.  

Jasmine in the garden.  ""Night blooming.  Like us.""  I didn't like the whole Ats Jasmine storyline while I was watching it, but I like it more in reflection, especially the whole moral ambiguity of it.  I guess I'll talk more about that when I get to that...  in like a year from now.  I think I'm going to start watching Angel after season 3 of Buffy though and watch them in order as they aired.  

I know we're in Sunnydale, but two teachers killed at the high school in a matter of weeks would cause a major uproar anywhere.  Poor Giles.  I remember that- after death.  Being desperate for any connection to someone who has died.  

Cafeteria food.  Glad it's been a while.  

Snakes in a School!

Principal Snyder.  He knows that the school is on a hellmouth.  And the city council knows.  And the mayor knows.  That's all important stuff.  Early evil mayor foreshadowing.

And Willow's first spell!  Well, exorcism anyway.  Is an exorcism considered a spell?  Probably not by the catholic church, huh?

I can't tell if Spike is jealous of Angel or of Dru.  The sexual tension between the three of them is great.  They're all so sexy.  

It's strange how Angel was all obsessed with Dru until after he sired her and then she was just like some crazy chick always hanging around.  I'm actually surprised that Darla put up with her.  

I really like the storyline with the history repeating itself and all, but I could do without the other stuff.  The snakes and the arm and all.

""To forgive is an act of compassion, Buffy.  It's not done because people deserve it.  It's done because people need it.""

Then Buffy references passion and how that made James do something evil.

I love how Cordelia is always there to point out the symbolism.  Makes it so easy for the rest of us.  

She's under the spirit's ""thrall.""  She's under Dracula's thrall later.  Thrall is such a funny word.

I love this scene.  Total chills.  

This was an early cross-cutting experiment for the Buffyverse, later perfected in Fool For Love.  

I love it when Buffy calls Angel ""Bitch!""  

Oh man.  When Buffy and Angel kiss.  Poor Buffy.  And Angel didn't seem to like that one bit.  

And yay!  Spike can walk!  

Great episode.  I can harldy believe Go Fish is next.  It's right up there with Bad Eggs and Ted as my least favorites.  The other one I don't like is Him in season 7.  Uuug."

"event","Eeek!  This episode scares the shit out of me and my husband is out of town so I'll be all alone tonight trying to fall asleep.

Ok, here goes.

The flu.  Really?  The flu?  Buffy?

Thank God Xander was wearing that horrible jacket!

I wonder if a slayer has ever died of natural causes...  like cancer or the flu.

Buffy is screaming about vampires in front of Joyce.  There's the whole Normal Again inconsistency rearing its ugly head.

Joyce and Giles should so hook up.  Not in a Band Candy kind of way.  

What thing is Cordelia talking about?  She's the only one with a ""thing"" on her face.

Man, I hate that guy.  Seriously.  He's fucking creepy.

The kid Buffy looks NOTHING like Buffy.  

Wait, did Giles bring Buffy a bottle of wine?  I mean, surely not, but it looked kind of like wine and then he said something about grapes.

Hum.  Giles is saying that death and disease are the only things that Buffy can't fight.  We revisit that theme with Joyce later.  

Why is it all dark in the children's room?  Even during the day? 

Do they have Krispy Kreme in California?  I guess so, huh?  

I bet if you were like a doctor or a scientist or something, this episode would be driving you crazy with what is probably an increduble amount of medial inaccuracy.  

I think it's so creepy because it has such long fingers.  He looks sort of like Abraham Lincoln.

Okay, like the children's ward would have basement access.  

Now my cat is acting like she sees someting I don't.  I hate it when she does that!"

"event","Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!  The next three episodes...  I can hardly wait!

Passion is one of my all-time favorites.  

My bedskirt matches Buffy's comforter.

Angel is such a good artist too!  Artists are sexy.

Jonathan.  

Xander says, ""Does this look like a Barnes and Noble?""  :)  So funny how none of them know how to deal with other students in the library.

I've always hated how Ms. Calendar asks Willow to teach the class.  That's so unrealistic.  

Willow's bullitin board says ""sheep.""  What does that mean?  

Okay...  Buffy's got garlic hanging on his headboard.  Does that give some validation in the Buffyverse to the vampires hate garlic myth?  

Hahaha!  When Angelus says that it might be handy to have Spike around if he needs a really good parking space...  haha.  So funny!

The Magic Box.  It looks totally different.  They're so sneaky with the set changes.  

Willow mentions the snoopy dance.  :)  

oooooohhhh.   A creepy Angel drawing.  of Joyce!  That's no good!  

Elbow patches!

Alright, Giles and Jenny are all lovey dovery.  Ugh.  I just can't stand to think about what's about to happen.  

So, how long has Angel been sitting there?  Was he sitting there while Giles was in there?  

Angel is like all bad guys.  He dosn't really run.  He just lumbers along.  Okay, he's kind of running now.

And he doesn't even eat her.  He just straight up kills her.  For some reason it seems more acceptable somehow when a vampire kills for food.

Buffy tells Joyce that Angel was the first.  Any evidence that that's not true?  The Buffy character has sex in the movie, right?  And Buffy seems surprised that Xander is a virgin in season 1.  But I guess that I'll just accept that Angel was Buffy's first.  

This is so awful.  When Giles finds Jenny.  Finding my husband dead is my biggest fear.  I can't even imagine.  And the setup...  like thinking that she'd done something all romantic...  oh, it's horrible.  Poor Giles.  I don't know how he could ever forgive Angel for that.  I love Angel, but I'm fascinated by the whole issue that comes up in the last season of AtS about whether or not he is worthy of redemption and the comparison of Angel and Spike.  Spike was a better person before he was a vampire, Spike was actually nicer and less cruel when he was a vampire and Spike chose to get his soul.  I know that Angel feels tremendous guilt about the things that Angelus did, but that is so self-indulgent.  It's hard to explain what I mean, really...  but it's almost like Angelus is Angel's true nature.  Angel is evil and his soul just keeps him guilty.  I guess that's what ""passion"" is.  Like our core essense.  Angel's passion is evil while Spike's passion is love.  

The most sick part about this is that Angel lingers outside of Buffy's house to see her reaction...  not Giles'.  

This scene is interesting...  how you don't want Giles to kill Angelus even though he's a horrible monster..  

And Buffy punches Giles!  


""Passion, it lies in all of us. Sleeping...waiting...and though unwanted, unbidden, it will stir...open its jaws, and howl.

It speaks to us....guides us....Passion rules us all. And we obey. What other choice do we have?

Passion is the source of our finest moments. The joy of love...the clarity of hatred... and the ecstasy of grief.

It hurts sometimes more than we can bear. If we could live without passion, maybe we'd know some kind of peace. But we would be hollow, empty rooms, shuttered and dank. Without passion, we'd be truly dead."""

"event","I feel kind of sorry for Cordelia, knowing that she's not as shallow as she seems.  It actually kind of irks me how Buffy and Willow hate on her.  

It seems like Buffy fights a lot when she should just be staking.  

Just thinking about how Buffy has power that she doesn't use.  In the opening to the show, they show her doing her dirty dance with Xander.  She's so seductive.  She could totally use that more.  

Amy!  Still sweet, too.  Oh, not sweet.  I remember now.  This is the first episode where we get a hint that Amy is going down a bad road.

I like it that Buffy is actually wearing a backpack like a real kid.  

Poor Buffy.  This is such a sad time in her life.  It's bad enough that the love of your life dies, but now he's evil and trying to torture you.  I don't know how she does it.  I'd be a total mess.

The dingoes!  I guess this is like the essense of Buffy.  I mean, it's like during this time in the show, it just really reveals its nature or something.  I don't think I'm making sense.

You can tell that Cordelia really feels bad about breaking up with Xander.  And I actually don't really feel bad for Xander.  How many times has he hurt Willow?  He deserves a taste of  his own medicine.  And then he reacts so ridiculously with the spell casting and all.  Although, I suppose if I was a teenager and I learned that magic was real I probably would have tried something like that.  

Oh, here's Buffy being all seductive on Xander again!  

Haha.  I love it when Ms. Calendar is rubbing on Xander.  

Oh my gosh.  The scene where Xander pushes the card catalog up to the library door and then Buffy opens it in the other direction.  Haha.  That's classic.  

Amy turned Buffy into a rat.  That's some serious foreshadowing.  

Giles is a little hard on Xander.  Ha.  The lunchlady is after Xander.  

When Willow says, ""I'd rather see you dead than with that bitch.""  I almost believe her.

Why in the hell would there be a black cat in the school basement?  

And some Joyce and Xander sexual tension.  

So, Angelus is attacking Xander because his death would hurt Buffy.  I guess he doesn't know that Joyce is trapped outside.  

I guess Dru is a little scared of mobs after what happened in Paris.

And again...  the door opens in the other direction.  :)  That's a great gag.

Yay!  And Cordelia comes into her own.  She's not a sheep!"

"event","Does Willow know that Amy's mom is ensouled in the cheerleader trophy?  I don't think so.

Willow and Oz would have such cute pastey red-headed children.

There's Larry overcompensating for his homosexuality.

""I think it's nice if he's not just being an animal..."" 

I'm not really feeling Xander and Cordelia this time around.  Cordelia is so much better in Angel.  Well, the first three seasons of Angel, at least.

So, you'd think that there would be a ""Werewolf Slayer"" out there somewhere.  I guess werewolves aren't as big of a threat or something.  

I wish that they'd taught self defense in my high school.  I always wanted to take karate.  

You'd have to think that when they thought up the idea that Oz was going to be a werewolf, they would have had to have realized what I risk that was.  I mean, it could have gone horribly horribly wrong and ended up some sort of joke.  I think that if had been any actor other than Seth Green they wouldn't have been able to pull it off.  He just plays it so cool.

Why would Buffy tell this guy that they were hunting werewolves?  Aren't they supposed to be like top secret or something?  

David Boreanaz is a really good actor too.  Even when he's Angelus acting nice, he acts differently than he does when he's Angel actually being nice, you know?  <lj user= ""buffyfan30""> is right.  It's because he smiles more.

""People for the ethical treatment of werewolves.""  :)

That werewolf costume is pretty ridiculous.  

Funny that Angelus is a little scared of it.  Of Oz.  You'd think that Angelus would be able to like smell that it was Oz.  

During the morph, Oz looks a whole lot like Eddie Munster.

I have an Aunt Maureen just like Oz!  

What crazy piles of crap Oz has in his house!  Just like stacks of crap behind him.  I guess his family is kind of sloppy.  

Alright, I can see why they suspect Larry, but why would they think that if it wasn't him, it would be another student?  That's a pretty wild assumption.

Willow is just a teencey bit self absorbed here.  There's obviously something wrong with Oz, and Willow thinks that it's about her.  

This is such a great scene.  Where Larry comes out.  

Xander kills Teresa, the vampire.  And Buffy and Xander almost have a moment.  Almost.  Maybe.  

Love how Oz just has chains and shackles sitting around.  

That's a really really horrible outfit that Willow is wearing. It's like those rubber pants that fishermen wear.  Like the Gordon's fisherman.

It's about time someone got a tranq gun!

"event","Surprise is where Buffy starts getting really really really good in my opinion.  Just looking at the episodes in the rest of the season gets me all excited.

You wouldn't think Spike would have such a modern wheelchair.  Dru looks like a bridesmaid in that dress.  

Ok!  Angel ate someone!  He's eeeeeeeeeviiiiiiiiiiil!  

Angelus is way funnier than Angel.  Much better sense of humor. Angelus smokes I guess.  Cause smoking is eeeeeeeevviiiiiiiil!  

Geez.  This episode is so heartbreaking for both Buffy and Willow.  

OMG.  Angel is black leather pants and no shirt.  

Jenny just says, ""people are going to die.""  Um, yeah.  They are, honey.  

""To kill this girl, you have to love her.""  One of my favorite Buffy lines.  

Now Buffy is wearing all black.  

This episode is just so emotional that I can't really put it into words.  There's so much going on.  

This ep is sad for Giles too.  He found out his girlfriend is evil.  Well, kinda evil.  Not evil, actually, but, you know.

At the mall.  This whole grenade launcher part is kind of silly, but whatever.  They had to kill him somehow.  The judge is like not a concern in this episode.  He's just a plot point.  

This is Giles' shining moment.  When he says that he respects Buffy.  I mean, technically, he's endorsing his minor student having sex with an adult, but, you know... special circumstances.  

""I'll just let it burn."""

"event","Sorry I haven't updated in a while.  I started a new job this week and it's keeping me busy.  It's good though, cause I hated my old job.  

I have the bed-skirt that matches Buffy's comforter.  Just a coincidence, I swear.  I love dreams in the Buffyverse.  Haha.  Willow and a monkey are speaking french.  

I know every time Angel is on screen, I have to talk about hot hot he is, but he really is.  

It's Buffy's birthday!  This episode and Innocence just really bother me.  I just want to yell at Buffy and Angel not to do it.  But....  I mean, if I was Buffy, I'd have had sex with Angel long ago...  but, as it's been pointed out, I'm not Buffy.  

In this scene, Buffy and Angel are both wearing white and the bed is in the background between them.  There's some symbolism for you.  Of course, if anyone asked Joss about that, he's say it was an accident.  he always says that about his most clever moves.  

Willow just said that she likes Oz's hands.  Another hand reference.  

Willow and OZ are too cute!  I hope that they grow up and get married and have lots of little red haired babies.  

Dru is taking care of Spike here.  What does that mean about her feelings for him?  OMG.  I love this where Dru ""can't abide"" the flowers.  That was like me when I was planning my wedding.  

So, do Dru and Buffy have the same birthday?  

Wow.  This is such an important episode.  There's the obvious with Angel... but we also find out that Jenny is not what she seems and the Spike and Dru are alive...

Giles just said, ""Dreams aren't prophesies.""  Oh!  Haha!  Oz!  ""Hey, did everybody just see that guy turn to dust?""

Um...  how the F does Angel know that the arm belongs to The Judge. 

Ah.  The ring...  ""The hands represent friendship.""  More hands!  Not to mention the judge's arm, which is basically a hand.  

You think maybe Angel and Buffy let the guy get away with the box kinda sorta on purpose?  So Angel doesn't have to go?

If I had called my mom in high school and told her that my guy friend and are were going to be up all night studying, she'd been like, ""Whatever!""  

No offense, but Dru's party looks cooler than Buffy's.

Oh no! Don't do it, don't do it!  

Angel's bed was white this morning and it's red now.  I guess it's just made up now, but symbolic.  

Wow.  Buffy really does let herself be vulnerable around Angel.  All crying and stuff.  

No!!!!!!!!!!!!  

I mean, I love Angelus.  Maybe more that I love Angel actually.  But, it's just so heartbreaking when he goes bad."

"event","This is probably my least favorite Buffy episode.  But here goes nothing.  

Ha.  Like Joyce is such a strict parent about how Buffy dresses.  

Lots of product placement so far in this episode.  Ally McBeal.  Sketchers.  

I actually forgot that this was the Gorch brothers episode.  Maybe it won't be so bad afterall.  

Buffy just said that she thinks about ""saving the world from vampires"" to Joyce and Joyce said, ""I swear, I don't know what goes on in your head.""  More evidence againt the Normal Again mental hospital plot.

It's so cute how Xander and Cordy just like kiss. It's so innocent. I guess they could be doing more and we just don't get to see it.  What do you guys think?  Are Xander and Cordelia doing it?

I guess this is kind of a precurser for the bigtime negative consequences or teenage sex coming up later in the season.

""Please.  Like Angel and I are just helpless slaves to passion...""

I had to carry around a 5 pound bag of flour for my baby in high school.  I named it Heather Lynne after my two best friends.  

Ugh.  I hate how that thing goes into Buffy's ear.  I get all freaked out about things climbing in my ears while I'm asleep.

Angel just tells Buffy that he can't have kids.  Little does he know...

Back in the school basement.  I'm pretty sure my high school didn't have a basement.  This does look a little like the school basement in the Buffy video game though. 

Man, I would be totally freaking out if I was Buffy.  Vampires...  fine.  Whatever.  Little scurrying creepy crawly things.  Ewwwww!

Okay, the way that Willow's shirt is rolled up in the back is completely ridiculous.  

Alright, what's the moral here?  Have sex and you end up a slave?  

Joyce and Giles are bonding.  I always wanted them to hook up.  I don't mean ""hook up"" cause I know that they do that, but I wanted them to be a real couple.  Wouldn't they have been great together?  

There's Johanthan again!  He's so adorable in these early seasons.  

I've  actually gotten a few good chuckles out of this episode... where Xander tells Buffy to be careful and then falls...  and when the guys hands Xander to big rock and Xander just throws it down.  

I guess this thing is like a squid or something.  Squid inspired.

Awww....  Angel and Buffy being so sweet.  Surprise is the next episode.  I'm all excited about it."

"event","This scene where Buffy fights the vampire in the pumpkin patch is a lot like the one where she fights the vampire in the Christmas tree farm.

Angel and Cordelia. Chatting it up.  I love Buffy and Angel together, but surprisingly I think I may prefer Angel and Cordelia.  Not this Cordelia.  ATS Cordelia, but I love seeing them together and interacting.

Man, Principal Snyder sure does make them volunteer for a bunch of crap- the talent show, parents' night and now Halloween trick-or-treating.  

Larry.  He keeps reappearing.

I love Willow in this scene.  Where she's sneaking into Giles' office.  

Okay, so Willow and Buffy have the watcher's diary and they're reading about Angel and all we find out about him is that he likes pretty girls.  

They tell Cordelia that Angel is a vampire here, but she doesn't believe it.  I don't remember her ever actually finding out.  I mean, obviously, she does, but when?

Dru is already expressing jealousy over Buffy.  Asking is Spikes loves her insides while he's studying Buffy fighting.  I love this scene- with Spike and Dru.  She's so delightfully crazy.  

Wouldn't it have been funny if Willow hadn't put on the ghost costume and then she turned into a....  hooker?  Haha.  

Damn!  Will Willow and Oz just please get together already?  

Ethan just says, ""Showtime!""  I believe we hear that again.

So, does Willow becoming a ghost here qualify as her dying.  I mean, she drops dead on the lady's front porch.  

Buffy being all helpless reminds me of SMG in the The Grudge.  I wanted to just yell at the screen for her to kick that little screaming kids ass.

All right, let's take a second to talk about the juxtaposition of roles here.  In the beginning, when Larry was about to kick Xander's ass, Buffy, a girl, saved him.  Now, when they become their characters, Xander is saving her.  This has all sorts of connotations about gender roles and whatnot.  A lot of the time, when I notice stuff like this, I don't write about it, because it seems so obvious, but I suppose I should be documenting stuff like that.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't even know why I'm keeping this journal really, but there it is.  I do notice stuff like that.  

I like this episode, but my favorite episode where they forget who they are is Tabular Rosa.  Now, that's a good episode!  

Oh, I think I remember when Cordelia finds out the Angel is a vampire. Dur.

So, Angel is about to stake that guy, who could just be a guy dressed up like a vampire for Halloween.  In fact, that's the most likely situation, sine vampires are supposed to stay in on Halloween.

Oh!  Larry is dressed as a pirate!  

This may be interesting in regards to how much of Buffy's choseness is associated with her body versus her soul of whatever.  Her body has superpowers, so does she still have superpowers even when she's the princess?  In Tabula Rosa, she still has superpowers, but she's still herself there, she just doesn't remember who she is.  Here, she is actually transformed into someone else.

Giles' sordid past is only mildly interesting to me.  It's good that he becomes less of a stereotype, though.  

Okay, Cordelia made it through this episode without realizing that Angel actually was a vampire.  

And Willow made it through more self confident!"

"event","I know that Buffy is the slayer and all, but why does she feel the need to stop other kids from getting in trouble on the field trip?

I wonder how much of this stuff about Incan society is true?  If I was a history buff, I bet stuff like this would drive me insane.

I know a lot of people hate this episode, but I'm not one of them.  Isn't this the ep where Willow meets Oz?  Finally!  I'm so sick of her fawning all over Xander.  

If the exchange student had been a boy, where would he have slept?  In Dawn's room?  

Oz!!!!  

Like they don't have Twinkies in South America.  Well, maybe not.  Anyone from South America?

Feeding on the life source...  that's pretty much like a vampire.  


""You were the chosen one.  You must die.  You have no choice.""  Is this saying that Inca Mummy Girl is a slayer?  I guess so, huh?  That's pretty cool.  

OMG.  Willow is so cute.  This is one of her more endearing moments.  That eskimo suit.  Bless her heart.

Man, IMG totally had lipstick while she was in the bathroom and she killed the bodyguard.  She was putting it on in the mirror.  I wonder if that was bad writing or due to editing decisions.  

Oh!  Jonathan! I didn't realize that this was his first episode.  That was a close call for him.  What if he had died?  That would have been terrible. I loooooove Jonathan.  I'm so glad to be in season 2.  

There's some bad editing in this episode.  I'm an editor, so that really bothers me.

Xander looks like a prisoner at the end of this episode. 

Edited by Regis B. Kimble.  I'm going to have to look him up.

*EDIT*  I looked him up.  He actually edited and directed a good bit of Buffy and Angel, including directing Earshot, which is a great episode.  Inca Mummy Girl must have had lots of post-production problems or a bad continuity director or something."

"event","yay!  Spike!

Really...  why does Buffy care so much about high school...  Once I realized that, you know... monsters were real and that it was my destiny to kill them, high school wouldn't have seemed so important.  I mean, I ddin't know any of that stuff, and it wasn't that important to me.  

Ok, Spike.  ""Home Sweet Home.""  Why does he say that?  It's not really his home.  Has he ever even been to Sunnydale before?  I remember that I used to think that he had lived there for some amount of time, but I don't know why I thought that.  He's just there for Angel, right?  Or the hellmouth, I guess.

""I fed off a flower person.""  Haha.

Drusilla!  Yay for her too!  Spike loses his vamp face when Dru comes in the room.  

Wow. The two of them are so great. I love how the keep getting mesmerized by each other.  They're like Ronald and Nancy Reagan.  

Spike's scar is REALLY prominent.  

How about the guilt trip that Joyce lays on Buffy here?  ""we had to leave everything and move becuase of you.""  I mean, it's true, but do you really need to throw something like that in your child's face?

Another Scooby shirt for Willow.  

Why does Buffy stand up for Sheila?  I'd be ratting her ass out.  Yep.  She didn't show.  She sucks!  I'm awesome!  Buffy needs to learn how to market herself better.

This episode, where Spike is stalking Buffy just doesn't really have the tension that it once did.  I mean, who's scared of Spike?  

Spike gives Buffy the slow clap.  

I just love everyone in this episode.  Even Xander. ""Ok, that's it.  I'm putting a little collar with a bell on that guy.""

No one has a cell phone?!  This is 98, people.  Even I had a cell phone!

Spike's persona really works, but I mean, who's idea was it to make a Billy Idol inspired vampire?  ""Let's have a really evil vampire who kills slayers who looks like...  who.....  how about Billy Idol?  He's terrifying!""  

Joyce looking through that hole in the wall is so much like when she's inside the wall in the dorms in Restless.  

This is the whole infamous scene where Spike calls Angel his sire.  I think we all know the theories on that, so I won't waste time talking about it.  ""You were my yoda."" is a great line though.  

Then he says, ""The last slayer I killed begged for her life.""  I don't really remember Niki begging.  Or the Chinese slayer, although Spike wouldn't know if she begged since he doesn't speak Chinese.  

Joyce!  To the rescue!  

This conversation between the principal and the cops...  the ""usual story"" bit.  It indicates that Snider knew that they were vampires, at a minimum.

""The Annoying One.""  :)

This is so great when Spike kills him.  It's just so irreverent.  And that was some shocking shit the first time around.  No one saw that coming."

Buffy's in a grave for the second time.  How many times does she end up in a coffin?  

Seeing Cordelia and Angel interact is so strange.  I mean Cordelia is obviously into him (who wouldn't be?) but he's completely oblivious to her.  

So, this episode is a homage to Frankenstien.  Making a person from parts.  

""Ms. Calendar's my father.""  Why would she say that?  What does that mean?  

I understand that they have to put a major character in jeopardy in lots of episodes, but I'm getting kind of tired seeing Cordelia and/or Willow getting abducted.  Cordelia is a really good screamer though. 

The great thing about Buffy, especially starting in season 2 and afterwards, is that you usually feel compassion for the bad guy.  Like this guy, Daryl.  I mean, he didn't ask the be brought back from the dead and be a hideous walking corpse destined to always be alone.

Awwww!  Xander saves Cordelia.  Very slowly.  But saves her none the less...

I didn't write much about this episode.  Maybe I should watch it again."

"event","Willow and Xander are very endearing here.  

Wow.  So Willow and Xander alost kissed...  I wonder what would have happened if they had actually kissed.  

Buffy just called Willow and Xander losers.  That's kind of harsh.  

Buffy's got some post death traumatic symdrome.  

Seeing Buffy's parents interact is strange.  It seems kind of easy to imagine them as married.  

Buffy's lost some weight over the summer.  

Poor Willow...  I like Buffy as a bitch.  She's harsh and sharp, but dancing with Xander lie that is just so mean and not just to Xander but to Willow and Angel...  It's like she's just saying, ""Fuck all ya'll!""

Okay, Cordelia is a real person now.  She just completed the transformation from souless bitch to becoming a real person.  And now she's been kidnapped.  

Ah!  The classic ""bitca"" line.  I love that.  

So funny how the principal has so much power...  It's like they're all terrified of him.

Buffy's first torture!  How sweet!  

And they're all happy and friends again.  I gotta say this friend group is very forgiving.  But a lot goes unspoken between them too.  They don't really talk issues out alot.  They just kind of muscle through them.

Friends Forever!"

"event","""I may be dead, but I'm still pretty, which is more than I can say for you.""

I was so glad when Willow got over her Xander obsession.  You know, I don't really like Xander.  The way he was so oblivious to Willow and then what he did to Anya.  He's funny and all, but he's just not like a really good guy or anything.  Riley was actually a nicer guy.

This sequence where Buffy stakes a vamp is a good one though.  Very dramatic and well shot.  This whole episode feels like it has a little higher production value than the previous ones.  I guess maybe they threw some more money at it since it was the finale.  

Some major earthquake damage in the library.

It's so funny how The Master and The Anointed are just hanging out in the underground church all the time.  I know that The Master is trapped there, but they don't even have a television down there.  What could the possibly be doing all day and night?

I really hate Buffy's rings this season.  

""Willow's not looking to date you and if she is, she's playing it pretty close to the chest.""

Okay, Xander's pretty pitiful right now.  I'm feeling for him.  

Jenny Calender.  

Okay, prophecy stuff.  Giles says that some prophecies are ""dodgy"" and that Buffy has thwarted them before, but this one is different.  It's the ""codex.""  That there is nothing that is written in it that has not come to pass.  Okay, so basically this is telling us that some prophecies are more prophetic than others.  

Wow.  When Buffy says, ""Do you think it will hurt?""  That's really sad.  We all wonder that about death.  

That was a great scene.  We never really see Buffy like that again that I can think of.  Just scared and sooooo vulnerable.  I think her first death really makes Buffy realize that nothing is certain.  That she has the power to change things.  

You can't help but really admire Buffy in this episode.  She's so brave.

Giles just said that The Master is as old as any vampire in history.  I have more to say about this, but I don't feel like pausing so I'll come back to it at the end.

Buffy does give in a little too easily. It's like you can just see it on her face.  She just gives up.

Thankfully, Angel is always dressed for a dance. 

The Master takes a really long time to dust.  I wonder if that's related to his age.  I guess so.

So The Master has bones?  WTF is up with that?  

Ok, let's talk about The Master for a second.  We know he's really old.  Even back when he made Darla which was like 300 years ago (?) he already looked like he looks now.  All bat-faced.  The other really old vampire that we encounter is Kissytoes, or whatever his name is.  The one after Faith.  He's got hooves.  So, what does all this mean?  Are we to assume that as a vampire ages, he or she becomes less human and more physically like the demon inside them?  And since The Master and Kissytoes look different, does that mean that there are different demons that can make someone a vampire? Or maybe it has to do with the bloodline.  We know that The Master is part of The Order of Aurelius.  Maybe The Order of Aurelius look like bats and other bloodlines look like other demons?  

This was a really great episode.  So good that it didn't even feel like Season 1.  Season 1 gets way better towards the end.  I want to introduce my sister to Buffy, but I hate to start her off on season 1 because I'm afraid that she won't make it through. 

Alright, Season 1 is in the can.  I'm all excited for season 2."

There's Harmony again!  I just love her.  

Man, the boy's locker room is way nicer than the girls.  You'd think they'd use the same set.  Maybe it's just lit differently.

Willow is wearing a Scooby-Doo shirt.  

Xander is carrying his skateboard again.

Why would Cordelia be trying on her dress at the school at night?  That's some silly writing.

Angel!  Yay!  

I wonder if Giles views Angel as younger than him or as a peer or as older or what.  If feels kind of like they are bonding right now.  

Clea DuVall.  She's a really great actress.  Her great acting almost makes everyone else look bad.  I really feel for her in that bathroom scene.  There's nothing worse than feeling unheard.  

Also, living on top of a drop ceiling is pretty infeasible.  

Can't Buffy hear her breathing?!  It's like Darth Vader is up there!

Okay, so they're dealing with a sort of metaphysical/existential perception of reality.  It's actually a pretty interesting plot.  

This episode really humanizes Cordelia.  I guess they did that so that you'd care when she's about to get killed, but it's really great.  There are lots of parallels between Buffy and Cordelia.  They're both very alone-  isolated.  

You'd think that the FBI guys would be interested in Buffy.

It would have been really cool to have Marcie or another invisible student FBI assassin in a later episode.  I know that a girl almost disappears in season 7, but it would have been really interesting to encounter an invisible person who was trained as an assassin in a later episode and they'd have the back-story already in place for it...  If I ruled the Buffyverse...

Ok, I'm calling this episode the best of the season. It has some good character development with Cordelia, Buffy, Angel...  The ""Angel"" ep was a good one because I really love all those history lessons, but with my 20/20 hindsight, that episode feel really incomplete as a history of Angel. I know that it served its purpose at the time...

It also deal with something a little deeper than say...  the fear of technology theme of I Robot, You Jane.  The whole existential ramifications of this episode could have been really interesting if they had been a constant throughout the series... the perception can actually alter reality.  I guess Nightmares had some of that in it too.  It was about a literal manifestation of the abstract concept of fear.  

Good episodes."

"event","""Can I have a little support here please?  I'm not just some crazy person.  I'm the slayer.""

Joss seems to have thing for puppets.  They are quite creepy.

Cordelia singing The Greatest Love of All.  :)

Principal Snyder.  

Being forced to be in the talent show must be Willow's biggest fear, based on later episodes such as Restless, but she seems to be handling it pretty well.  

There's a dancer/band rivalry?  

Man, Joyce acted fast when Buffy screamed.  And why would Buffy need Joyce's help?  That's kind of sweet.

""Everyone look at me like I'm in a bunny suit....""    Haha!  And our first bunny reference.

Ok, so what's up with Snyder?   I was never really clear about how much he knows...  

Slayer in the 30's.  Korean trick.

Not only is he a creepy dummy, but he's also a pedophile.

I can't remember exactly what happens here, but something's telling me not to trust Sid.  

Snyder's ears.  That's funny.

And Xander saves Giles' brain.  Xander really does do a lot of saving.  He's totally unsung.

Oedipus Rex.  And then a strange little American Gothic homage at the end.  

I wonder why they called this ep ""the puppet show"" since it wasn't technically about puppets.  I guess dummies are a type of puppet, but not the first thing that jumps to mind when you hear the term.  It must be also applicable to something else...  like perhaps Snyder's control over Giles, Buffy, Willow and Xander.    Or something I'm missing?"

"event","""Besides, I can just tell something's wrong.  My spider sense is tingling.""

This disc has been a hard one for me to get though.  3 not so great episodes, which make me realize that the first season of Buffy was not as fabulous as the rest.  

So, this episode is basically about fear of technology.  It's a clasic theme, and I guess it falls into the old ""man versus science"" concept-  like Bladerunner.  Computers are not to be trusted, dontchaknow.

The Spanish Mission!  When I got the Buffy video game, it was all about the Spanish Mission and I was always kind of WTF is that, but I just saw an exterior of it!  

Alrighty.  Somehow the demon was transformed into words in a book.  Magic.

Dave?  Who the fuck is Dave?  Oh, and there's Jenny Calendar!  Alright, so Giles represents man and Jenny represent technology.  

If I lived in Sunnydale?  I wouldn't be hanging out alone so much.  

I'm not even going to start about how unrealistic this episode is computerwise.  

05-06-79-  That's just what the computer said that Buffy's birthday was.  That's not right.  

This scene reminds me of a scene from I Know What You Did Last Summer-  The shower in the locker room left running...  I guess IKWYDLS was made after this.

They're talking about all the things he can do from inside the computer.  It sounds like a Y2K discussion.  I wonder if people were talking about Y2K back then.  I don't remember.  Probably.  This was 97 or 98, right?  

Xander just said, ""Well, it wasn't busy either, so she's not online.""  Those were the days...

Willow's house.  She just checked her email like she had dsl though.  Wicked fast without dialing up.

Technopagan.  I've never heard of this outside of the Buffyverse and I know a lot of weirdos. Shit, I might be one.

Now he's a robot.  Shoulda seen that coming.  Robots are always evil.  Except our roomba and it kicks ass.  

Willow gets sassy.  

""None of us are ever going to have a happy normal relationship.  We're doomed.""  Ha.  

Well, I got through  it, but this one felt like homework."

"event","""We are talking full-on exorcist twist.""


This has got to be a dream.  Yeah, Xander just saved Buffy.  And now he's a rock star.  Haha.  I don't remember this at all.  This is interesting because of the gender roles in the show.  Buffy is the hero.  The whole show is basically a study in gender roles and turning those on their heads.  it's great because Buffy remains so feminine, but she's still the hero.  Last night in the commentary, Joss said that a problem with Buffy was that you could never really put your heroine in physical danger because she was such a hero- that instead he had to put her in emotional or psychological danger.  This theme of Buffy saving Xander versus Xander saving Buffy keeps coming back though.  We all know that Xander literally saves her life at the end of the season, but that still doesn't really seem to equalize things between them because there is such an expectation that Buffy would be dependent on a man.

Oh look!  Angel.  Why does Angel always have some place to be?  He's always ""gotta go.""  

Okay, now Ms. French is talking about how the female preying mantis is larger and more aggressive than the male.  This, or course, applies to her role in the show, but also to the ongoing theme of exploration of gender roles I was just talking about.  

Giles just said that he read about a reference where The Master cut off a vampires hand as a punishment.  Hands are one of my favorite symbols.  Your hands are your power.  I can think of at least two more instances in the Buffyverse, both in Angel, where the hands are removed.  I'll have to keep an eye out (hahaha.  eyes are another one!) for references to the removal of hands and/or eyes, both symbols of power.  

This vampires got a Freddy Kruger hand.  That has to be a direct horror movie reference.  Strangely, the removal of his hand which was intended to punish him and take away his power actually made his stronger and gave him extra power.

Buffy just said that he could ""shave with his hand.""  :)

Angel is a girly name.  Xander's right about that.  I always wished they'd named him something else.  Like maybe Gabriel or something.  Like a more subtle Angel reference.

AND.....  Xander's a virgin.  How old is he supposed to be?  Like 15?  He doesn't look like any 15 year old I've ever seen.  

I don't know why she would transform into the bug before she dragged him down to the basement.  It seems like that would have been a whole lot easier with hands.  

Oh, I just missed another hand reference.  This show is full of them!  They just did a flashback to Xander's dream and in the dream he hurt his hand and Buffy says, ""Aw.. you hurt your hand."" and then Ms. French is holding Xander's hands and tells him that his hands are so ""hot."" and then her hands turn into the preying mantis hands and Xander tell her that her hands are so ""serrated.""  Haha.  But what does it mean, all this hand referencing?  It has to have something to do with power, since this episode is dealing so much with gender roles and power-play.  Anyone know what hands archetypically symbolize?  Power, right?  This is good stuff.  I always kind of thought of this episode as fluff.  

So now we have some young virgin boys helpless in a basement in cages.  

I'm a little unclear about the science here.  So, she's supposed to mate with them to what end?  Would she get pregnant with some half human thing?  Would it be like Xander's baby?  And there's not mention of her having ever successfully hatched her eggs before, but since she's been around doing this for a while, one would assume that there would be babies.  Maybe she eats them.  

Ago, so Xander is completely helpless against a sexually aggressive female, which is sweet.  It takes another women, Buffy, to kill her.  Even Giles fucks up his role, which was to record the bat sonar.  Oh, okay, now he got it.  

This is a silly low budget fight scene, but pretty quick, at least.  

Also, the usual horror recipe is that virgins are safe.  It's after they become sexually active that they're killed, because young girls, in particular, must be punished for having sex.  

Of course, we see some of that later on in Buffy.  

Oh, this episode ends with an egg hatching.  Hum.  I don't think that ever comes up again, but it's a nice little twist.  One that lets you know that Buffy is fallible."

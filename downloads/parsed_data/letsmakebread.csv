"event","so lately has been weird.

since i've been out of school i've done a lot of ""hanging around."" not really doing anything. just basically helpin people out or being with people. i pretty much stick around here and do the same old thing. but thats OK because its summer, and i have so many night to waste.

recently i've been doing some work on my car. nothing heavy yet. just some routine oil changes. right now my big project is installing my car audio system (sounds gay, but its fun.) im not all about 'bumpin' systems and that shit. i just want my appleseed cast to sound clear. hah. so thats going OK. i have a lot to do, and i can't drive my car till its done. im hopin to start in an hour and hopefully finish early tommorow. im like halfway done now. 

last night was weird. kinda shitty. we went to hampton beach to this gay apartment party. everyone was shitfaced and destroyed. i've noticed lately that a lot of people have fun just getting so shitfaced they can't walk, see, talk, anything. how is that funn? why doesn't anyone just wanna chill out. you can get messed up, but in a chill way. i don't know.

friends are good. i've been chillen with julian and charles and that crew a lot. its fun. ian sometimes too. i can't wait to start work. <b>M(me ian julian) + $12.50hr + our old school= mayhem! </b>

jessie and i are great. except for a few little small mishaps. but thats all good. we are going to school next year at UVM together. im wicked excited. a lot of people tell me ""oo, thats gunna be weird."" or ""thats gunna suck."" but its not. i love being with her so im not worried. i was talking to someone about this the other day. that like, even though its been almost 2 years with jessie, i still feel like i just started going out with her. you know, that good feeling you get when you first start going out with a girl and your completely in awe of her and can't believe she would pick you. idk, maybe im just retarted. but basically i've had the best time since i've started to go out with her, and i don't plan on ending it anytime soon. so im wicked excited to go to school with her. hell yea.


my parents suck. a lot. i really hate them. like for real. i appreciate all that they do for me. no doubt. i understand that they pay for my school, and all that shit. but i really hate them. they treat me so much worse than my sister, and if you were to see the way my mom treats me, you would probably want to remind her that im almost 18 years old. idk. i really can't take it anymore. i can't take coming home every night and being ""checked"" for pot or alchohol. i can't take being yelled at for working on my own car. i can't take having to tell my mom the exact plans of what i'm doing every day of my life. it sucks. people always bitch at me because they say i'm mean to my mom, but they have no idea what i have to go through. whatev's.

news: 
dont really have any. im gunna go down to philly with cliff and julian at somepoint in august. 

julian and i are swapping an engine into his jetta in my garage during july. 
next week we all wanted to go camping together. but i've havent heard any news about it. so i doubt its gunna happen. 

my birthday is comming up in  about a month. that should be unreal. your all invited. i think. il have to see what the plan is. 

im going to waterfest with julian and cliff and posibly another person in july for 3 days. thats a big car show.

nothing really else.

so thats that. i'd like to keep in touch with all my friend this summer. espesially fenwick kids. so deff call me when i get my phone. which should be soon.

"event","so i haven't really kept anybody posted on the college thing. ill let you know that i am very please. I did not get rejected from any of my Schools.

Schools i got into in order of me wanting to go there.

1. University of Vermont

I got a lot of scholarships here, and i could go to this school for less than 10k a year. thats pretty cool. i loved it. i went there yesterday. im 90% sure im going here. Burlington is incredible.

2. Boston University

Very cool. They gave me 30k a year, but its so expensive that i would still have to pay 13k a year. i love boston, but BU dosen't have a campus, so i dont know. i am going to go look at it again, just to make sure im def. not goin there.

3. Providence College

Awesome school. the campus is incred, and providence is sick. they only gave me 14k out of 31k, so thats a lot of money that i would have to pay. also, their engineering program is fucked.  i would have to go to PC for 3 years, and then Columbia Univ. in NY for 2 years. and i would only end up with 2 B.A. sucks. so eff that.

4. Northeastern University.

Sick school, sick location, sick campus. they haven't sent me any financial stuff, and i dont like the co-op thing. and i'd rather go to BU.

5. Trinity College

Eh school. Pretty cool campus and program. i hate hartford. yes its my town of birth, but i dislike it. very ugly. CT blows. im sorry. they gave me 22k out of 42k. so thats kinda out of the picture.

6. Boston College.

I hate BC, i wish i had never applied. rich white catholic kids litering the campus. 20min on the T from boston. ew. makes my skin crawl. not to mention they dont have my major or any engineering programs there.


so thats it. its between UVM and BU, but im pretty sure UVM is the gem.

past happenings:

vacation started for Fenwick on tuesday of this week. and we get all of next week off too. so im pumped. nice needed. relaxation.

then its just 4 days of school and we are done with high school for ever!!!! YAY aprild 29th!!! hooo rahh.

i installed Allison's Cd player in her bimmer wednesday. i had to re-wire the entire car. took me 9 hours. but it came out pretty good. i hooked it up to a switch, but she doesn't want it any more, so i have to go fix that quickly. her car is cool. like mine.

o right. i got a new car everybody. its sick.
1988 BMW 325IX. i love it. its all wheel drive, silver/grey color, 5spd, fast as hell. its beautiful. i have to replace the sunroof and fix a hole in the exhaust. then she is ready to go. im pumped. it had 1 owner, he was a bmw mechanic. so there is a folder in it that is really thick that has every service history report. they tally up to about 17k in repairs. its sick. i bought the car for 3k. what a deal. i love it. come take a whip in it with me.

my phone is dead. im getting a new one soon.

there was a hypnotist at MHS last night. i wanted to go soooo bad. like wicked wicked bad. and i couldn't. i actually really depressed that i didn't get to go. especially cuz weaver took off his shirt. :(

see weaver, i told hypnotism was real. and u didn't believe me.

im going to go see girl next door (GND right john!) with steve ritter. so i have to showa. later."

"event","yes, it is true. i have a snow day today. which is incred.

i started track yesterday, i hate it. not because of the work/activity, but because of the kids and my coach. im very heated, but im going to tough it out i guess.

what i have to do today and why i am thanking god that i have a snow day:
-read 200pgs of ""hell to pay"" (anti-hillary book)
-write a 7-10 page paper on the sybolism of the handkercheif in Othello
-study for a calculus test 
-do so much AP physics
-spanish shit


so yes kids, i am going to start reading, then maybe drift off to sleep. then maybe read again. then maybe go out. who knows. its a snow day. anything can happen!"

"event","how yall been. well its been some time, but i finally got my comp back. this is a good thing. especially because i am extremely behind on my VHS class. im talkin like 2 weeks. bad news.

today hasn't been the best week. i actually had a butt load of fun with julian earlier this week. we got ourselves back into video games after a 4 year falling out. which reminds me. donate to my fund: <b>please donate money to my Tony Hawk's Underground/ Need For Speed: Underground funds. I need to reach a goal of $100, however any donation is appreciated. im dead serious.</b>

yeah, so we played some vids. we rule at mario kart 64, probably the most classic of classics. great game.

but this week wayne, rachel's dad, past away from cancer. which is extremely sad. he was a man that i will never forget. he got me into cars and helped me fix mine when it broke every two seconds. everytime i think of brake pads i will think of wayne. the guy never lost his patience, even when he had like 4 broken cars in his driveway. he never hesitated to let us use his tools, even though they had to go back in the exact spot. truly a great man who raised a great daughter. so yes. very sad. 

whoever wants to support rach at the wake and / or funeral should definately come. if u need info just IM me.

so other than that, life has been decent. school is finally not important, for the 1st time in 4 years. i can finally just relax and do jack shit. school shall become even more of a blast.


alright, fenwick folks. we need a senior skip day. we need to do it. no pussying out this year. i say we do it the day after a day off, so we get like 2 days off. it shall be sick.im gunna pick a date and start spreading the word. whose with me? i know teh bog is.


i've been boarding a lot lately. its great fun. 


nothing much more to say. im in that dreaded ""waiting to hear back from colleges"" phase, that blows, and its been depressing me heavily, but o well. i just have to deal.

i quit winter track. i've been so sick lately and there is no way that i woul dhave been able to survive practice. plus the last meet was today. so o well. but i shall be resuming track during the spring. good times.

"event","hello all. i stayed home from school again. today marks a month since i have been sick. and today i feel really shitty. i think its from my medicine i've been taking. its like HxC.

im watching comedy central's remix. its so funny. o man.

lifes been simple lately. i watched all three indiana jones' dvds. that was cool. and jessie saw lord of the rings (fellowship) for the first time last night. now only 2 movies and 7 hours to go. 

tonight i think i am going to Gage's house. but most people are going to the friggen secret santa. except for julie and I. but i was invited and julie wasn't. thats lame. i eleceted not to participate in secret santa because julie was rejected from being included. which is stupid, esp. because only 1 or 2 people didn't want her included. and i guess 1 person has a personal vendetta against her. haha. funny right. but o well. julie and i will have fun tonight.

somepeople are really annoying. it sucks when its your friends. they like, criticize you, and others. and do all this jazz. never apologize for it, and always think they are right. thats annoying. now imagine being friends with someone like this, then imagine them asking you to take the blame for a piece of one a their mistakes. haha. that didn't really make sense. but i know some people will understand it. either way, it sucks, and makes me question my friendships. :-/

so battle of the bands is coming up. which is cool. im gunna be a judge. haha. the bands are pretty ridiculous, but dez, steve, and teh bog might do something, and they would def win. but the battle of the bands is open to all. IM me (letsmakebread) if you want to come. its not gunna cost much.

im pretty bored. i might watch a movie or something. 

so i wanna get some use out of this threedom pass. amanda (brenden's gf) has one. which is cool, cuz shes probably one the same level as jessie, and they can like, have fun with eachother. so that would be cool if we went  up. dez seems to think that he would just stay in the lodge, but im gunna get that kid on a board. hahahaahah.

i haven't run track in almost 3 weeks. thats bad. but i've been sick. aparently the coach is tyring to give me shit. eff him. i dont really like the guy. i liked the old coach better.

school is ridiculous. its so friggen fun. its like mayhem all day long. for example: in my spanish class we had to write a skit based on a story we read. but beaton was in my group, so we decided to write it about every story we have read this year. hahahaha. o man, good times.

i need a car!!! fyi, if anyone sees a BMW 325ix, 325is, or 325i for sale, call me (7816390685), that would be cool!

so teh bog is gunna get a SAAB. that is ill. i remeber sophmore year when we walked around and saw like sunbaked red SAABs that were incred. that would be cool. and hes gunna get it stick and be a man.

I saw the show insomniac for he 1st time. its great. that would be a great job. 


haha. this is random. but i can just picture the reactions of somepeople when i dont show up for secret santa. ""ugh, i can't believe he went to gage's, what an asshole"" or like ""if he thinks he's friends with us, he would have came"" something like that.  haha, or maybe they're just not gunna care. probably not gunna care.

alright, im getting bored, and if you are still reading, you're bored too. so ya."

"event","so its 2004. pretty scary. i remember back in 5th grade thinking about how i would graduate High School in 2004. god damn. its been 8 years since 5th grade.

vacation was funn. i only went to school for 2 days the week before vaca so i basically had a 3 week vacation. thats pretty sick.

didnt really do much. i party'd at stan's house. that was decent. trevor drank soap. thats was wicked funny. especially because i am a vetren to the sport. steve sniffed sour creme. that was wicked fucked up.then we went to denny's at 3 and had the worst meal of our lives. but hey. good times. good times.

i went snowboarding with chandler, davis and of course trev. that was great fun. trev. let us stay up at his house near attitash. very funn. good talks lol. mike and i are pretty much the same level snowboarding. which is good because it was fun to board with his. davis was alright. and trev. was good, but he skied, so i had no concept of talent. but im pretty sure he's good. he spanked us all when it came to speed. :-/

it was great being back a attitash. i remeber the days of weaver and i boarding there ever sat. btw brian: i had breakfest there again, they raised the price of hash brown and 2 pancakes to 4 dollars!!! NO! o well, still cheap.

got some good presents. jessie gave me really good ones. this is what i got, even though you dont want to hear it. btw, all i asked for from my rents was the indiana jones' dvds. and i didnt get them from them. lol.

rents:
-threedom season pass to loon, cranmore, and waterville.
-good snow pants
-family guy season 3
-2 shirts
-slippers (sister)
-beef jerkey
-toothbrush/deoderant/toothpaste
-pimple junk
-gum
-and then like $600 from my cousins/uncles/aunts

jessie:
-stomp tickets!!
-a buzzer for my hair
-cd stract remover refills (impossible to find)
-indiana jones dvds!!!
-new cell phone
-maine t-shirt
-pajama pants


so yes. very merry chirstmas. my rents spoiled  me because i get literally nothing last year.

you know that family guy joke:
""you know what i haven't had in a while...Big League Chew""

well, trevor took us to a place that had it, and i was so psyched that i ate it all, and i got the worst stomach ache. but still good.

we played a lot a poker. that was fun. i was so lucky. i won 20 bucks. that was sweet.


so all in all. pretty good vacation."

nothin new in my life lately. i sent out all my apps a few weeks ago. that almost felt good. i really don't know where i wanna go. its between UVM and BU. but i guess we'll see. I thought i knew what i wanted to do, but now im not so sure. 

i've been pretty depressed lately. about a lot of things. mainly college and the fear of acceptance/rejection. its really hard to try and stay happy when i know im not. but hopefully things will work out.

i stayed home from school yesterday and today. im sick, but not really. i just need some time to myself. the two days off felt good. esp. since im not going to school on friday. so vacation for me starts on Thurs! yes.

school is a blast. i have so much fun with everyone there. i dont really do anything all day. i just kinda reek havok upon everyone.

im doing winter track aswell. its fun. i love hurdling, and i can't wait for spring track. good times. y'all should come see me hurdle at some point. im not half bad. 

boredom has been taking over my life. o god. i've been so bored lately. but only during the week. weekends are good times.

i finished my christmas shopping, for the most part. i still need to get jessie something. and im not really sure what to get. :-/ hopefully i'll think of something soon. 

the friends are good. i have a lot this year since i ran for prez last year at school. its fun. outside of school friends are good aswell. jessie is a blast. although meg has been pissing me off. shes not acting her normal self and i refuse to deal with it. i understand shes goin through a tough time, but hopefully it will get back to normal.

ritter has been really fun. we chill a lot. hes a good kid. he got into stanford. which is neat. 


in other news. my car shit the bed. well not really, i just dont feel like fixing it. so my rents said they would buy me a new one. which rules cuz i have 0 money. What i really want is a 91 BMW ix. but that might be hard to find. but hey, you can always hope.

i just don't want to be stuck with an American can or Japanese car. European all the way!

well kids. im fresh out of updates. but ill try to post more."

For those of you available for commissions, I'm looking for more specifically illustrators and concept artists. I do not have the time, energy, or (sadly) heart to work on a project any longer, and want to give this person some references of those that might be able to help her out.

For a book about lesbian hookers/pimps set in The Tenderloin District 1960's. Simple character illustrations for thank you cards. Potentially web design, mock up jacket art, etc further down the road. What she wants is the two main characters. If you give me your contact info I can pass the info along to her and she can call you to discuss the project further.

"event","Okay, so I'm a little irritable because I missed two things I wanted to go to yesterday because I've been sick. I'll be working on Halloween so no parties for me. I've had a fever since I came home friday night from work. And it STILL has yet to break. My neck and throat are both very sore (yet the sound of my voice hasn't been affected), it's hurts to talk and turn my head. While I can feel a 'nasal drip' in the back of my throat, I'm having no trouble with my breathing. All of yesterday I had these intense (though brief) pressure headaches every time I got up from sitting/lying down. Those are gone (I think). Yet my head is kinda cloudy feeling, and it's hard for me to focus. 

So the real reason I'm writting this post here is some art pet peeves I have.

In some of the LJ art communities there's a lot of lj folk who post crappy photography (along with stick figure art, but I'll get into that latter on). Yes yes, I know. Who am I to judge the quality of people's photographs? They could be learning. Yadda yadda yadda. What I AM sick of, is pictures that don't have the sharp focus, lighting and or color contrast that makes (to me) a photograph interesting. Granted some of them have good composition, and COULD be good photos if they put more effort into shooting the picture than they did posing themselves and or the model. And THEN people reply to this saying it is fantastic, when the result is a muddy, grainy, and unfocused picture. It's like people are AFRAID to give constructive criticism. Which doesn't really surprise me, because often when it is given (I mean true constuctive criticism, not ""Oh this is crap"". It's ""Oh this is crap, and here's what you can do to not make it crap..."" However, subsituting crap with another 'nicer' word is probably a good idea. Bah. No. Actually, if people are going to post their art in a public forum, they need to grow a back bone and not get so butt-hurt. It's art. You're posting it to be judged, not everyone is going to like it!) the artist backlashes as well as the other people in the community. WHY?! That is so rediculous! Maybe because I'm very objective about the art I post publicly. But I've had people tell me some of my stuff is shit. If they can give me a why, I'll listen to them. I'm not hurt over it. My desire is to become better. Not everything I draw/paint/photograph/whatever is going to be a masterpeice. In fact, I couldn't call anything I create/have created, a masterpeice.

Another thing. Is when people discredit 'good' art because it only took the artist *add short amount of time here* to finish. Really. Why the FUCK is art judged by how long it took you? Some people are trained to work quickly and accurately. I'm included in that group. I trained myself to do that because I can only focus on one peice of work for a certain amount of time. After that time is up, I get bored with it. Which is why if it takes me more than a couple of hours to complete. It usually never gets finished. So naturally, I learned to work faster without skipping steps. ""Wow! That's fantastic! That must've taken you forever!"", ""Well no, actually it only took me a little over an hour to do..."", ""Oh, well then you should've probably put more effort into it."" BLAGHHHH! I've had that conversation more times than I'd like to count. Drives me up the wall. Though this is not to say I think people who take a fair amount of time to complete their stuff are any less... Whatever... In fact, sometimes I wish I had that diligence so I could finish some of the paintings I felt had good potential, but took me to long to ever complete.

I think the last thing I'm going to write about before I fall back asleep, are art teachers offended by nudity. I'm not reffering to porn or erotica. Nudity, as in oh look a women and or man is lying casually, naked. Or oh look, there's a naked back. At my old highschool there was one teacher I absolutely detested. My senior year, I was so disgusted with her, I disconnected myself from the fine arts program and stuck with the performing arts. There were a couple people who wanted to included nudity as a subject for their AP Art portfolios. She wouldn't allow it (she is a VERY conservative woman). She even went as far as to manipulate the subject matter of her students portfolios in order to make herself look better when they all got their AP scores back. I saw her PAINT ON at least 5 students works (it wasn't just a brush stroke either, she would sit and paint on whatever they were working on for about 4-5 minutes). Stuff that was supposed to be done by the students and to be graded as such. This was the first time she was to teach an AP class and she wanted to look good. Like, she taught them to be masters! I have a BIG problem with this. I think that if you teaching someone, you should only paint on their work if it's not going to be judged. If it's just an exercise. Go for it. But if it is something that they are supposed to be done by themselves (and have signed a form declaring that this work is not reproduced and their own) than I believe it is wrong. I actually got into an argument with a customer at work who recognized me from my work in the fine arts department there. She was arguing, well that's how she could learn. If someone showed her how to do it. Oh, it's highschool so nudity isn't really apropriate. Good GODS! If I was allowed to watch a woman give birth, as in full-frontal-nudity-baby's-head-coming-out-of-a-vagina in the 7TH grade, how is 'tasteful' nudity not appropriate in the 12th grade?! And Mrs. ** was really a sweet woman who meant well. I was being to critical of her. Bullshit. I am a critical person. But I won't take some one manipulating my work to make themselves look good. Which is exactly what she did.

You wanna know the funny thing about it? I don't think anyone in that class got higher than a 3 (and those were few and far between from what I heard) on their portfolios. And the ones who did get 3's were the ones who's choice of theme/subjects she disliked the most."

I feel like I'm missing a couple? Am I? Have I said I'd go to something (Seriously confirmed and or seriously considered...)?

Help me out here.

Oh and I'm not for sure if I should spend Thanksgiving with friends or family. My folks and brother are going to be out of town, I'm going to be working till about 3:30. Last year was pretty much the same thing except I was working till about seven, and it consisted of a movie and pizza. Best Thanksgiving ever. Really. I feel that because I did that last year, I should probably go to a 'dinner' this year. Maybe I can swing both. Hmmm...

My motto for the day:

I'm finding that when I post updates I actually work on the damn thing. I'm sick of putting a fair amount of effort into paintings (both in real media and PS) and not finishing them. SO! This is what I've got so far on it. I'm nearly fifty-percent done. I've got some ideas for the back ground. But I'm not sure yet. I don't think I'm going to use what's in the picture I'm copying from.

Life update on other journal. I'm happy. Life is dandy.

And it does not suck. Nope. :)

Though I've come to the conclusion that licking sticky substances as a means of getting them off my skin may proove problematic in the near future."

Okay. I remember this meme going around, but I couldn't find the exact text for it. And I realize I've been doing a lot of memes. I still owe the doodle memes. And I promise I will get to those. I've just been lacking comedic creativity. So here's something else:

<b>Comment here on what you want to see from an aspect of my life. And I'll reply to you with a photo. It could be work, pets, friends, siblings, hobbies, anything. You tell me what you want to see, I show you.</b>

You don't have to repost this in your journal, or tag anyone. Just fun an' games kiddos!"

"event","More questions: 

This time asked by <lj user=op_lattethunder>

<b>1. If you can trade places with any living person in the world (gender doesn't matter, they can be anyone) who would it be and why?</b>

Someone who was born into money. Just to see what it was like to not have to work for something for a change. My inner lazyass would love that. But it's always been something that's interested me, because while I have no desire to have lots and lots of money. It's something completely different than I know.

<b>2. How did you become such a stupendous badass?</b>

I created a twin. She's my confidence. Because really I don't have any. However, my twin has tons. When I need to do something that requires confidence and guts, I take her out of the closet and unleash her on the world. Oh, and I can't stand not knowing how to do something. So I learn. And then I teach my twin, not that she cares. She'd do it even if she couldn't. It's all a front. There's Timid Redhead, and then there's <b>The Redhead(tm)</b>.

<b>3. What is your favorite memory?</b>

Standing under the castle Disney World's Magic Kingdom during Concert Choir's '05 tour. Me and the nine other CC folks that were with us randomly singing Ave Maria, and my dad having my mom on the phone tearing up slightly as he listened. There are few things in life that will top that experience. It's why I love music, singing, and people. And it makes me cry a little bit. :)

<b>4. If you were stranded in the middle of the desert (islands are overrated) and you only had your backpack full of whatever, what would you put in your backpack to survive both physically and mentally? Remember, it has to all fit in your backpack.</b>

Any materials I needed to build a transportation device out of owl droppings and cactus needles. Because who the hell wants to be stuck out in the middle of a desert? Oh... Wait... They do that thing in the desert once a year huh? And then there are spin offs of it aren't there? Ya buncha kooks!

<b>5. What is something you're really not good at that you wish you were?</b>

Dancing. It's something I'm wretched at, but so wish I was good at, because it's such a social thing. And it's fun. Granted looking good while your doing something isn't everything. But it'd be nice... Oh, that and flying. I'd like to be really good at flying. So far I'm pretty much glued to the ground, so I figure that count's as something ""you're relaly not good at""."

"event","I was tagged by <lj user=tatjna>

<b>Once tagged by this entry, the assignment is to write a blog entry of some kind with six random facts about yourself. Then, pick six of your friends and tag them; no tag backs. This explanation should be included.</b>

-When I was little, I absolutely hated my hair and freckles. It wasn't until about freshmen year in high school that I liked it and didn't want to dye it some other color.
-My family moved to Japan for about two years when I was 3 months old. I remember nothing of it. However, I do believe that's why I've never been picky with food. I will try everything and anything once. And I usually like most everything I've tried (except for spam).
-Because of severe and constant ear infections, I was mostly deaf for about a year and a half when I was 9. I was sent to the principal's office a number of times because teachers thought I was purposefully ignoring them. I also got really good at reading lips.
-Despite being artistically inclined, I use the left side of my brain more than the right.
-I will be more attracted to an average looking guy who has an accent from either Ireland, France, Italy, or Spain than an attractive guy from US. It makes me giddy like a school girl.
-I don't like letting other people do things for me if I can do it for myself. I have an almost obsessive desire to do things myself. As if I have to prove myself to everyone. Granted I do know my limits, and won't try and lift a hundred pound object without help. But I find it amusing when people offer to carry my luggage, set up my tent, etc.

I tag <lj user=op_lattethunder>, <lj user=kat_eyz>, <lj user=trouble166>, <lj user=gryphalcon>, <lj user=pzonivy>, and <lj user=drmablondie>.

And now for <lj user=tatjna>'s questions: 

<b>1. What do you think of appearance medicine/plastic surgery?</b>
I think it's silly when people get it done when it's something that healthy dieting and exercise could easily take off. Or when they get stuff done (nose jobs, cheek implants, etc) so that it'll boost their non-existant modeling/acting career. But I know enough people who have lost signifcan't amounts of weight on their own, but they've still got the extra skin, and they get an operation to remove it, in which case I'm not against them. 

<b>2. What is your tattoo (the one in your icon)? Does it represent anything, why did you get that particular one?</b>
It's a wolf pawprint with some linear designs. It represents a couple of things. First, is that the pawprint has always been some part of my signature when I finish a peice of art. The other is a representation of a connection I feel to Wolf. I got this one because it was small, simple, and asthetically pleasing to me. 

<b>3. You create beautiful art in Photoshop. What made you choose that medium?</b>
It's clean and inexpensive. Really. It's something that I can manipulate it easily and quickly. If I'm stressed out, and I'm at home, school, or even at work. I've got my laptop with me and I can just sketch out a doodle. Less of a mess than bring my markers, pencils, or paints with my sketch book. Also, I can take something I worked out in PS and then transfer it onto a canvas to work on it more after I've gotten all the kinks out of the begining sketch.

<b>4. Naked dancing on the full moon, or just naked dancing? Or fully clothed? Why?</b>
All of the above? I sweat a lot. So dancing naked I'm cooler, and I don't have wet clothes clinging to me. Under a full moon? For the small amount of rituals I do, they usually incorporate dancing in them as energy manipulation, normally I don't (probably only because I've got neighbors who can look in my back yard). I've done it a couple of times when I'm camping. It feels as if it's freeing. Maybe it is maybe it isn't. But it sure is fun!

<b>5. You get to go live in a country of your choice, all expenses paid. The catch - you have to live there for a full year as if you were a citizen, job and all. Where would you go and why?</b>
France. Hands down. I guess because I spent a while there last summer. I like the culture, the scenery, the people and the language. I also know the language. As to what part, probably in and around Bretange. It's close to various places, so even if I was working I could still visit and travel to the places I wanted to see. When I was there before, I felt very creative and inspired. So I could also be productive artistically.

So here's the part of this meme. If you want me to ask you five questions. Go ahead and leave a comment. The catch is that you have to post the answers in your own journal. 

Now I'm off to Disneyland!"

I haven't made a lot of progress on it, but a noticable amount.

-Darkened/highlighted hair
-lowered hair line
-Darkened right(our left) eye
-reshaped, lightened nose
-colored more of the right(our left) arm.
-colored left shoulder
-defined chest
-smoothed out/corrected highlights and shadows on the face

Besides it being a painting for fun, I'm trying to work on three things here. One, get back into full paintings in PS. Two, minimal layers, so far I've got just two. One with the color, and one for the background. And the third, I'm trying to work without erasing anything. I don't erase when I'm painting with water colors, or oils, so I'll try it with this medium too.

"event","For the small few (that I know, lesse here, <lj user=op_lattethunder>,<lj user=lifeofreilly>,<lj user=btrswtsymphony>, and maybe <lj user=drmablondie> are the only folks on LJ. Plenty of people that I don't know have seen me dancing) that have been dancing with me and or seen me dance, you know that I am an absolutely horrendous (though most of the time on-beat) dancer. I have all the grace of a toddler. This is why I don't often go dancing. I'm actually very self-conscious of it, particularly because I know such talented dancers. And recently some of my social circle is surrounded by those who love to go dancing.

So, what's the big deal? I love dancing that's what. I love moving to music. I love being involved in music. And while I can sing. I actually believe I have a fairly pretty voice, if different. You can't just <i>go</i> singing. You can just go dancing. Because there is something about listening to energizing music, and dancing in a crowd of people, the feel, of the contact of feet to floor, the pushing of bodies, and the vibrations of the sounds, is exhiliarating. 

I've learned to embrace my horrible dancing. That I'm probably the source of much amusement to those watching. I mean come on, a mass of red hair, flailing long limbs? How can you not be entertained? In all my awkwardness, people can still tell I'm having a good time. I'm being silly and loving it.

And that is something more people need to do. And why I love my friends. Because they're all silly as hell and I love it!

Oh, and listening to Seven Nations and dancing my heart out for a random 15 minutes of celtic rock had nothing to do with this post at all... Nope. *grins*

Yet I feel graceful with the poi, probably because I'm giving my arms, hands, something to help them move and follow...

And now for something completely different: ""What about taking blood from the tails of ugly red-headed rats?""

<img src=http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c162/Faelin05/Doodle%20Journal/Uglyred-headedrat.jpg>

For those of you 'out of the loop'. There was a dinner conversation about taking blood from the tails of rats. Then it progressed into the polartiy of red-heads, how they either tend to be gorgeous, or butt-ass ugly (<lj user=forktronica>, was it the ""five-head""?), and then went back to taking blood from rats. And then Whitney commented, ""Well, what about taking blood from the tails of ugly red-headed rats?"" I can't remember how that fit into the convo, but it was funny as hell.

One other note: I'm in an absolutely fantastic mood. It still hurts. But I'm kind of glad it does. Nothing really has in a while ya know?"

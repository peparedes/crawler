"event","Been helping out at Super Summer Spectacular (a.k.a. Vacation Bible School).  My mom, Melissa, Amy, Teresa Q, Becky, Michelle, a youth and I are teaching 4-5 years old.  SOOOOO cute!!  Here are some fav quotes:

From day 1: After singing and before the bible story Natalie A. raised her hand and said "" There's a tarantula in the playground"" 

From Day 2: ""Why do you have polka-dots on your arm?"" - Aisha, refering to my freckles
""Ok, that's what we call a rhetorical question"" - Becky, to Patrick, after he said no when I asked if everyone wanted to sing.

From Day 3: ""Do you want to play wif me?"" - Max"

"event","Yay!  So excited about Camp X!  Had a counselor meeting today and it was really cool.  The camp theme verse is:
""And do this understanding the present time.  The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now that when  we first believed."" Rom 13:11
It was nice to see everyone and hang out with goofy, fun, into God people.  I also got to see to newest addition to the Okubo family.  She is SOOO CUTE!!!  Jenn actually let me hold her, and she fit perfectly into my arms.  

And now, great quotes  from tonight:
""Well, there's no one for me to avoid garlic breath for"" - Michelle
""You shouldn't go to camp/church to get fed, you should go to get hungry""- Keas
""You are there to nurse them.  Well, not like...you are there to be nurses""- Keas
""So you can write Creation next to that.  There's gonna be a lot of C words coming your way, because if it's not alliteration, it's not spiritual""- Keas"

"event","<sigh> Hanging out at my dad's office right now...He and my mom are at a meeting, then my mom's going to take me to my Gap orientation!  Yay :-)  I'm excited...and sleepy...interesting...
I've checked out about everything I can online: email, facebook, and now livejournal.  I must have the most boring entries ever.  So I will now include a funny anecdote:

Nery: Someone called you an owl
Average Person: Who?
(get it?)

Nery: Hey Mr Terecido, someone called you an owl
Mr Terecido:  I don't care, they can go to hell

Me: Hey Michelle, someone called you an owl
Michelle: <pause>  Whhhyyyy?
Me: No, wrong response, let's try this again.  Michelle, someone called you an owl
Michelle:  Is it because I stay up late?
Me: No, someone called you an owl.
Michelle:  Was it Eli?
Me: No, it wasn't Eli
Michelle:  Was it Ana?
Me:No it wasn't Ana
Michelle: Was it Stefanie?
Me: No it wasn't Stefanie.

And then I gave up.
And found five dollars."

"event","Hooray for birthdays!  Right now I'm chillin' with S-dog at the Sanchez Crib.  Pretty fly.
Kinda frustrating day at first, but now totally cool.  Went to Gap for a training class, and it turns out that the class is scheduled for Monday.  Booooo...Oh well.  Went to Target and got both Margott and Stef's bday present, so all's well that ends well.  Will write more later....maybe...eh, probably not."

"event","Hooray for baby gap!  I got the job and i'm so excited about it!  Today I had my first orientation day thing...I filled out a buttload of papers then watched a cool dvd and a couple of corny videos.  Tomorrow I have another class thing, and then i'll go get on the schedule to work!
Besides that i've worked some at Bali, and got to visit New World.  I went to their concert last night and it was really good.  Erica kicked butt!  Yay! Afterwards I got to have a really cool dinner with Eli, Michelle and Stef and Cheescake Factory; early birthday celebration, yum!

Tonight the celebration continues!  Stef's fam, Michelle's fam, and my fam are going to eat really good food my Mom's making and have a good time :-) Yay for birthdays!"

"event","I knew I wouldn't write in this sucker much...I'm surprised i'm writing now...I mean, who's even gonna read this?  Oh well...
It's so good to be home!!  But I miss my UF friends.  Definetely not the classes part.  The past 3 or 4 nights I've had dreams about being at UF with all my friends.  Had a scary one too:  Pura Vida was at Lake W, and alligators started appearing, and one chased me!  Would have gotten me too, except I woke up...Booya!  Can't catch me!
So, I have 2 job interview Wed!  Yay :-)  One for south miami hospital and one for Baby Gap.  I'm also gonna head into Bali Cafe (no, not the exercise place like Stef thought, although one look at me and they'd definetely want to hire!  Just kidding) Thurs and Friday to work some there.  It should be pretty sweet.  I'm probably rusty, but at least I'll get some dough.  
It's my bday in 10 days!  Dang, I'm getting old!  And sleepy.  I should probably get to bed...Good night whoever is reading this.  Sweet dreams..."

"event","Things I like about college: my bed, my room (sometimes), homegroup, GCL, music and friends.
I'm not really crazy about much else...unless I'm forgetting something...I guess I shouldn't complain;  I mean, how many people find a church and friends right off the bat?  Plus, Caedmon's Call liked G-ville enough to come and play here...

It's just not home.  I miss miami!!  I can't wait to go home!  I'm super excited.  Thursday I get to go to Stef's first concert, and Friday I get to go visit school and movie night at church! Yay!  Those things among others.  I'm also looking forward to just sitting around my house.  

I signed up for classes today.  A whole bunch of music classes, and chemistry.  Chem 2 Honors, actually.  I'm a bit worried about it though, cause my friend Ryan told me it was suicide.  And if chem 1 is kinda kicking my butt...oi vei!  I don't feel like worrying about it right now, though.  I have time to change it if I decide to.

Still not feeling well today..."

"event","Well, I decided to finally start one of these bad boys.  I'm honestly still not sure exactly how this is suppose to work, or how faithfully I will write in it, but, hey, i figured it was worth a shot.

Today was a pretty weird day.  I haven't been feeling well of late. Looking forward to Wed. when i get to go home!!  WooHoo!   

I don't really have much to say today.  I slept alot, and have put some time into setting up this journal.  The rest was school stuff...

So I think I'm done for now...pretty lame first entry I guess.  Maybe I should make stuff up that's fun to read:
    Today the hottest guy ever came up to me and asked me to marry him.  I of course said yes, and have come to find that not only he is hot, but he also is sensitive, rich, musically inclined, and in love with Jesus.  Wow.  What a keeper.
Just Kidding...no but seriously, it was a really cool dream."

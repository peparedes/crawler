"event","Today was really awsome but sucked at the same time. Bad news first igot my prgogress report today and got in trouble for it even though my grades are better now. So because of that i cant goto the finch show tomorrow which wouldnt be that bad if i hadnt allready bought 3 tickets lol so now i'm out 50 bucks o well. I might not have to go camping this weekend so thats all good. Now for the good news. Devin had been trying to put in a good word for me with Crush ( thats what i'll call her for now) for awhile now and he succeded but i was to chicken to make the first move. so last night at work he gets me all pumped up to ask her for her # so we could kick it sometime. All day i kept thinking of backing out but devin wouldnt let me so right before sixth period i was ""talking"" with devin outsde his class waiting for her to walk up. Finnaly she comes around the corner and she says ""long time no see"" and gives me hug and we start talking. After devins reassuring look i ask her for her # and she gives me it and gets mine from me. may not seem like a big deal but lets say its been awhile since i have tried getting a girls #.

Sidenote: i have a question, maybe someone can help me out with a reply. I really want to tell somebody else how i feel about them strait out, no dancing around the subject. I'm not sure if it will make things differnt but i really want to get it off my chess and maybe she might have something to say back. Reply with your advice."

"event","Can you hear the desperate cries 
that are calling out your name?
Twisting your arms, 
holding out their hands and 
tugging at your sleeve,
Do you feel this underlying sense of urgency or 
are you as blind as me?

I hit the ground and I'm still running 
but I need a place to stay tonight,
I swear I'll be gone in the morning 
I just need somewhere now

I can't bear the thought of losing,
I dread the attention winning brings
And ever since the day I came here
I can stand without your strings
I'm so sick of all these people
But I'm scared to be alone
And if this life has taught me anything
I forgot it long ago and so I

I hit the ground and I'm still running but 
I need a place to stay tonight,
I swear I'll be gone in the morning 
I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes.

The heart is something 
You can't control
We either choose to follow 
Or be left on our own
So we're leaving here on 
A less-travelled road
As desperate cries grow louder, 
I know we're getting close, getting close

i'm at the point where nothing seems better
only things get darker right before i fall asleep

that i'm good at failing with the best intentions

i'm tired
of living a lie

have no air to hold

i cant be fixed i'm way to broken
all the pieces are lost along with my faith
in my own room i lay here silent
giving up on my heart as it gives out on me

"event","Well just another day of work and nothing exciting. just had lots of time to think which i think was ok i guess. I have gotten to the point where i'm ready to quit. i quit at trying to please my parents or their godamm expectations of me. i quit trying to be a nice guy cause as we all know ""nice guys finish last"". i quit searching for someone (not as like a life partner but just a really good friend who is allways there). i just want to stop all of it. this gonna sound retarded but, all i want is not to want anymore. a night with out drawn out convos in my head or terible nightmares (they're back again) would be bliss. i just want nothing more than my guitar and a empty notebook. those are my best friends."

"event","Today was cool i had people and we rode gokarts till i got in trouble cause we kept breaking them. Then i went to work nothing to exciting. sometimes i think this thing is stupid. all i do is complain and let others read it. pointless. why is it that girls have such and effect on my life? it gets so old sometimes. i try to talk to people and just find someone that understands me but when i do talk to someone its like they dont really care. i need a purpose, a reason for why i'm here, why i go through the stuff i do. i know there are are other people out there who feels this way but i feel so alone. its not that i need gf or want one. i just need someone thats there. i need to keep my self more guarded from people. i'm tired of spilling my guts just so i can be the one who gets hurt cause i said to much. i expect way to much of people and i'm learning that maybe i'm the only one i can count on. trust is so hard to find these days. i keep looking for someone i can trust with my self but i am at the point where i'm just ready to give up. i should stop trying and just face that whatever it is i'm looking for i cant find. how did i get to this point? where has all my hope gone? lol and i saying all this to a computer how low is that. time to quit bitching and just close my self up. no more letting people in, i cant be dissapointed anymore."

"event","Time to update, I'll start with friday. i had a show friday night at the epidemic so my devin kyle and some of our friends went out to eat at dennys after school sorta of a tradition. we were so hyper and loud at this table that wasnt big for all of us. there was food being thrown (and spilled on me). after that we went and loaded up the stuff went and did our sound check at the epidemic. Then i went and picked up mel char and janel so they could come see us. We had a really good show made a few mistakes but i had so much fun. it was great looking in the crowd and seeing so many of our friends especialy the girls in our shirts we made. at one point jessica was up front watching us play and there was one song i wrote about her that we played and kyle said we saw her crying, idk why but whatever. it was akward cause i had a few ex girlfriends in the room but it was all good. we sold out of all of our shirts maybe got some new fans so i would call it a success. after the show i went to mels and hung out and watched tv. and when i left i got my sober KISS so it was the perfect way to end a perfect night:D Last night kyle and jarred spent the night and we drank alittle bit and just talked and that was hella fun ( i recomend getting a degree in underwater basket weaving lol) then today janel came over and rode go karts and went swimming it was hella fun i got sick but i feel better now. School tomorrow :P so i'm gonna go kick it with my family."

"event","For the third weekend in a row i have gotten drunk and its been great. Friday night went to mels and watched a perfect score with friends. i guess mel and nel started a book awhile back that was supposed to be for me and it had some pretty funny stuff in it so i hope they finish it this year. After her house went to kens and got drunk and spent the night there. i broke a cup so i felt bad but ken said it was all good. Tonight went tipeeing with some friends got about three house and almost got caught at one house (close call with scary dad). stayed out till about 2. pretty fun weekend. there has been one thing in the back of mind though that i have been really trying to forget. I wish i knew how cause my life would be so much easier. its so dumb i'm not even gonna try and explain it. i need a way to fall alseep faster that way i dont think so much."

"event","Ok here I go. I have to say that recently it seems my life just keeps getting better with every passing day. I had a great weekend that made up for a crapy week. Friday was fun going to San Fran at 1 in the morning. But i have to say Sat was my favorite. Went out sat night with some friends and ended up going to alittle party at this old empty house. I had alittle to drink and i ended up kissing Mel again. For the record i must say that i really really have enjoyed hanging out with her, and i keep hoping that we might get another chance to kiss ( maybe a sober one?) lol.  Anyways its been cool talking with her lately and she has been a really good friend. i really am thankful for her, even though i dont know where we exaclty stand or if we even stand. We might hang out friday, not sure  but i hope so. And today kyle came over and we raced go karts and mini bikes and i must say it was very hardcore with some near crashes lmao. then went to dinner and now i'm here. Sometimes i wish i was more interesting and talked about cool stuff. if anyone knows that akward feeling of butterflys in their stomache and not doing what to say or do next, thats exactly where i'm at. i love that feeling. any advice is welcomed"

"event","I need to get this out for myself or i'm gonna go crazy. Last night the shit literaly hit the fan. Jessica came home from New York and i was really missing her and looking forward to seeing her that night camping. We were supposed to talk soon to work things out between us. But while i'm there i see chris slide his hand on her leg. I seriously exploded on the inside. i confronted her about it and she said they were together. I told her i was done couldnt handdle this anymore. i walked away feeling the worse i have ever felt in my life. I felt betrayed, replaced, forgotten, all alone and hurt like my heart was on fire. i did the next logical thing, i drank her away. i didnt want to feel a thing so i just kept drinking. sometime in the night she takes me on a walk to talk. i dont want to say alot cause i'm drunk and i dont want to say something i'll regrett. so i listen and she says that we really fucked things up by dating and that she hoped when i said i was done i dint mean with being friends with her. she said she did this to save us. Well her solution for her might work out fine but it just causes problems for me.I honestly want to be her bestfriend but there are parts of her i'm not ready to give up. Plus her getting with chris just totaly makes me feel like crap like i'm not good enough for her and i feel replaced. how can someone say they care for you and still love u but then do this to you. i would of never expected this from jessica. so things seemed alittle better but i still didnt feel good i wanted to say more. so again i just started drinking and then smoked chewy. i figured since we arent together and i'n not good enough for her i would smoke because she had asked me a long time ago to stop. But if she dont care then i dont care. I'm so confused and i need advice cause unlike jess who has chris now, i have no one.
I guess it doesnt matter how much you love someone cause in the end it just falls apart anyway and nothing u do is good enough to fix it. she never even gave me a chance to talk to her. funny i went from counting days till she would be home and now i'm counting ways to avoid her. love hurts to much."

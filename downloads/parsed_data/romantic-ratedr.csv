"event","I was waiting for a cross-town train in the london underground, when it struck me. I've been waiting since birth to find a love that would look and sound like a movie. So i changed my plans, rented a camera and a van. Then I called you. <i>""I need you to pretend that we are in love again.""</i> And you agreed to. <b>I want so badly to believe that there is truth, that love is real. and i want life in every word, to the extent that it's absurd.</b> I greased the lense and framed the shot, using a friend as my stand-in. The script it called for rain, but it was clear that day. <i>so we faked it.</i> the marker snapped, and i yelled, ""quiet on the set!"" and then called, ""ACTION!"" I kissed you in a style Clark Gable would have admired. I thought it classic. I know you're wise beyond your years, but do you ever get the fear...that your perfect verse is just a lie you tell yourself to help you get by?"

"event","Ok. This is probably going to be a long update. so if you don't care about me or my life, then you probably won't want to read it.

well...i can't remember which days I did what. 

All I know is that:

Michele and I went over Brits house. We went to the movies and saw The Stepford Wives. It was a strange movie...I don't know what i think of it. But Matthew Broderick was in it, which was the best part. Then, we went home and slept. We woke up the next morning and went to 'practice'. i went home after that.

Later, i went to mattus house. the people there were:
jimi b, emfo, joey, nia, rhiannon, mattu [obviously, seeing as how it was his abode], danielle, steve, mike[?],david[?]. and...i think that's it. i practically broke my foot. i 'fell' off the trampoline. i slept over emfos that night.

the next day, sir dave farrar and paul came to pick us up. we went to the movie theatre, because paul had previously left his hat there. no luck finding it. then, we drove around in circles for an hour trying to find the chinese buffet. so we just decided to go to ""panda express"" at the greendale mall. complete ripoff. there were no pandas. then, we went back to Pauls house...where his vicious dog kept harassing me. We watched a movie which was kind of dumb...but still funny. Emfo and I 'lulled' Dave to sleep by caressing his head. They dropped us off...and I went home soonafter.

I slept over Micheles. This morning we went to the Salvation Army in Whitinsville for many hours.
I came back to micheles, and slept on her couch for 45 minutes. Went to work from 4-7.

Then I came back to Emfos. I was the first to arrive. Mattu came soonafter. And I styled his hair. He was wearing Emfos moms pants. And he looked hot. I'm going to post pictures later. Then we sat in the tub and talked to Danielle on the phone. I watched part of Aladdin.
We went outside and were dancing in the dark at the end of Emfos driveway. Dave, Paul, Jimi B, and Danielle [not mattus danielle] came. We hung around for awhile, and Paul made us coffee. I went swimming with Ryan Fournier.
[did i mention ryan fournier and ken showed up?]
Michele couldn't come. That was a drag.
But it was a good time had by all.
...dave lost his deodorant.

but yes. comment or something."

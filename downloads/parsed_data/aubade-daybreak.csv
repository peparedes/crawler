<b>[</b> Kira. 

Kira Yamato is the pilot of the Strike. 

The man in the GAT-X105 Strike which the ZAFT and the Le Creuset team had invested months in pursuit, and innumerable men, armed units, resources to intercept. The pilot that killed Miguel. Wounded and scarred Yzak. Killed me. 

Then befriended me. Exchanged with me a vouch of trust and esteem, neither of us truly knowing the identity of the other. What irony this is. What painful, twisted, convoluted irony, of which no less is fitting for this terrible city. I wonder if he knows, if he has been similarly inflicted the pains of this sadistic paradox. 

Athrun. How long... how long had he known? How long had he been fighting alongside us, against Kira? Knowingly crossing artillery and acrimony with his best friend behind the face of the Strike, himself behind the face of Aegis? 

When had he had a change of heart?

And Yzak. Who wanted more than anyone to unveil the identity of the Strike's pilot, wanted more than anyone to destroy him. And now, to find out in such a manner his own comrade's change of allegiance... his sense of isolation and embitterment must be beyond what any of us could understand. 

And I... I don't know what to think. I don't know what to do. The dead doesn't change sides, have to reinstate or reevaluate the reason for his allegiance. But <i>I</i> must. To turn my back against Athrun <i>or</i> Yzak is unthinkable. To make an enemy out of Kira, <i>again</i>...

Happy Mother's Day, dear <i>okaasan</i>. 

May this melody quell your heart and bring you peace. May this song carry these words and thoughts to you. Please shed no more tears for me, for I am here, and I am well. I am sorry I cannot be there to watch the end of the war and experience the brilliant new era with you and <i>otousan</i>. Rejoice it for me, and no matter the distance, I will surely feel it too. Thank you for looking after my piano, <i>okaasan</i>. I wish you and <i>otousan</i> good health, and all the joy in the world.

Love, 

Nicol.</lj-cut>

This is a song I wrote for my mother, in tribute today to all mothers, yours, mine and ours. I hope it reaches them, no matter where they are, and I hope it carries your thoughts and emotions to them. As the piano serenades this song to the approaching night and the day's end, I wish all our mothers peaceful rest, and sweet dreams.

"event","It had been... a full day. I visited the operahouse to spend a bit of quiet time with the old Steinway and record some tracks. I haven't composed in a while, and it felt very liberating.

<b>[</b>I don't know what came over me today. I'm not like this. Never, not to Athrun. But seeing him express such distress and <i>anger</i> that I've never seen in him before, watching him lose grasp of control and getting caught in the thickening, swirling madness around us... I wonder, if the town is finally beginning to change me too, and the thought frightens me tremendously.<b>]</b>

"event","Two days ago the colors left us. Today, sound had departed. It certainly poses a greater inconvenience than the former, as proven by the theft of Athrun's ZAFT uniform, and our temporary incapacity for oral communication. 

Despite the difficulty of searching for his uniform in the current situation, Athrun, as I expected, turned down my offer of assistance. He must want a fair match between him and his friend, this amiable thief Sly. Thus I occupied myself with studying some sheet music, and while I was searching the drawers for extra manuscript paper, I chanced upon these old photos: 

<a href=""http://img218.imageshack.us/my.php?image=nicolandrustysquishsmall1ip.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/7804/nicolandrustysquishsmall1ip.th.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"" /></a>

<a href=""http://img218.imageshack.us/my.php?image=athruncolor3qb.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/2554/athruncolor3qb.th.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"" /></a>

The first was taken with Rusty after graduation from military school. The second was when I first tried my father's old 55mm double lens camera, and stole a shot of Athrun for a test picture. I haven't seen both of these photos for the longest time, and certainly hadn't expected to see them <i>here</i>. There's no plausible way that they could've travelled from my photo album at home <i>over there</i> to the desk drawer in this apartment. Everyday the town does something to confound me as to just what kind of powers it possesses. 

Though, shocking and strange as it was, I'm happy for their unexpected appearance. They're items of nostalgia that bring me back to times and places I haven't revisited in much, much too long."

"event","While this city possesses some notable ominous overtones, it certainly knows how to keep its residents occupied, sometimes even busy enough to forget the persistent ticking. I suppose this is a good thing, despite even the situation with the eggs a few days ago. There is something oddly artistic in the workings of this place. Days ago the town was assaulted with a shower of eggs of all colors in the spectrum, and today I woke to a monochromatic morning of whites, grays and blacks. A strange experience, but at least not an alarming one.

<b>[</b>Athrun. He is here too. He has just arrived several days ago through the cockpit of-- Aegis? No, Justice, he said. His new mobile suit. I never thought I'd see him again. I've dreamt, sometimes, and contented, prayed, that dreams stayed as just that. The dead are not known to be haunted by dreams, but this place is beyond anything that's known or commonly perceived, as I've come to realize over the past months, and Athrun unfortunately came to terms with in just three days. 

I didn't know what to feel when I met him. I didn't know what I should've felt. I did feel, was overwhelmed with, joy, relief, nostalgia, and all the emotions in between when one meets an old friend. As well as all the emotions when one meets an old friend he is not meant to meet again. The only way I knew to keep those emotions from constantly clouding my thoughts is to focus on helping him as much as I can. 

And as wrong as it is that Athrun is in this city, that the dead is to reunite with the living, I'm glad that I'm at least able to do a little more for him this time than simply dying. It's a selfish thought, I know, to disrupt natural order based on what <i>I</i> want, on <i>my</i> desire to help Athrun. And I think I'm willing to let me be just a little selfish, just this once.<b>]</b></lj-cut>"

"event","<b>SPOILERS AHOY</b>

He had been here for what felt like months. There was nothing in this town that gave any indication of time other than the carousel in the town's center that danced in its circular paths to the tempo of invisible clockworks. So while it was like death in a way, it was not in so many other aspects. The City had too much pulsating vitality that seemed to resonate from the very core of the land on which it stood, and the people, the buildings, the air surrounding the town, all seemed to be pressing slowly toward some sort of end or finale like a disquieting <i>stringendo</i>. 

But Nicol had gotten used to it, the sensation of being gently pushed toward no day or time in particular, or the intuition that death probably was not like this. He knew he was dead the moment he woke in this realm, when he opened his eyes to find himself standing in the square of an unknown city, before the roaring spray of a large fountain. The pain of Strike's sword scorching his skin lingered like a ghost but left no mark, and as he gazed into the fountain he received the affirmation that he had already got. At the end of the slideshow of his life in a mirage of watery spray, he saw and heard Athrun scream his name, a snippet Nicol was not sure he recalled, and was not sure he wanted to remember. He nonetheless appreciated, pocketed, and held these memories dear to his heart, for this was all he had of his past life in this strange town. 

Whether or not this city was the afterlife, the netherworld, how death really was supposed to be, Nicol no longer cared. The persistent tick-tock of the unseen clock gears no longer bothered him, and he set his mind and heart to stay in this place, live a life in this place, till the world brought whatever it would when the clock wound down to nil."

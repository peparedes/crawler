<lj-cut text=""Come all ye young men who follow the siren call/The land's not for adventure at all/your hearts lie with the waves, your souls with the deep-"">

William Turner was born in Glasgow Scotland, the youngest of eight children in a strict Catholic household.  His father, while a good and decent man, took to beating his children and wife whenever business with their locale shop would go sour-driving young Will Turner and his brother Albert to England where they, )at the ages of eleven and fourteen respectively) joined up with the merchant vessel, <i>Dancing Dragon</i> as cabinboys.  Will served loyally, until the Dancing Dragon hit an Atlantic Gale.  His brother went topside to work with the sails.  The force of the wind threw his brother out of the rigging whereupon he landed on the deck and shattered his spine.  

Moments away from death, Albert made his younger brother promise to always take care of himself and (mysteriously) to ""Live life to the fullest, for we never know how short it will be.""  bothered by those words, William stole away from the Dragon and enlisted in the British Navy, citing his experience on the Dragon, and lying about his age.  Not wanting to question (They were in the tail end of a war with England) they assigned him to Captain Dalton of the ship ""Royal Endowment"" 

William Turner grew up in the chair of his shipmates on the ""Endowment"" and later on the ""Wildcat"" where he was first known as ""Bill"" Turner.  He served with honor, but a growing distain at the politics and ""self-serving"" nature of the officers that he had to work under.  He came to realize that he was built with a love of the sea, and resolved to quit-resigning any potential for an officer's commission. 

After his tour had completed, the next stage of Bill Turner's life began in a barfight.  A former crewmate accused him of deserting and the two began to fight-the brawl ultimately broken up by the tavern owner and his daughter-the barmaid. 

Annabeth Markham-Turner was (at least she thought) a girl of good and respectable standing.  She enticed Bill to stay at the inn, working odd jobs for her father.  The two were married shortly after that, and Bill found work on a trader bound for the Far-East.  He returned to find Annabeth, and his son, William.

Bill Turner took to being a father like a duck takes to water.  Content with only one child, he doted on the boy as much as his time was allowed-which wasn't often.  He'd do his best whenever visiting ports of call to bring back a tale for the lad, or a present of some kind.  

When William was 10, Bill heard about a new business venture in the Caribbean, that would require his absence for a year, maybe two. He kissed Annabeth and William goodbye and set off in serach of his fortune, thinking that if this truly was the payoff he was looking for there might be a chance to retire and leave the sea all together.  He envisioned a house, quiet and by the sea, where Annabeth and William waited, his son growing up to some honest trade-a Blacksmith perhaps, or even a lawyer. 

The ""Caribbean Venture"" as Bill speaks about it, failed so spectacularly, that people would associate his face with it for years afterward.  It was all he could do to take what little money he had-returning back to Anna and his son with his proverbial tail between his legs-

Only to have the Spanish trader he bartered for passage on be captured by the infamous ""Black Pearl"" a new pirateship just out of Tortuga.  One by one, Bill watched as the crew were slaughtered until he was stared down by their Captain, a crude sort of man with an uneasy gate about him.  Bill Turner prepared to die, thinking only of his son in his final moments, before Jack Sparrow leaned close and asked him for Rum.

Taken aback, Bill Turner couldn't help but laugh.  He directed the good Captain to the rum stowed below, and Jack promised not to kill him until thte morning.  Taken prisoner aboard the Black Pearl, Jack confessed that he really didn't <i>want</i> to kill him, and asked him what he'd like in trade for his life.  Bill promised to work for Jack Sparrow, growing to like and respect the pirate.  

'Bootstrap' Bill as he came to be known, turned out to be a fair sort of pirate.  Experience on both Merchant and Naval vessels lended valuable insight when the Pearl was being chased by either sort of vessel.  

The only part that he would later come to regret, was that he never told his wife or son about his new vocation.  The money he sent back was six to seven times larger then what his ""doomed venture"" might have earned, and he hoped feverently that William might go to school, become educated, and make himself a better man then his father. 

Bill's part in the mutiny was more peer pressure then anything else.  When they marooned Jack on the Island, Bill spoke out against the crew's treatment of their erstwhile friend.  Barbossa gave him a chance to repent, and Bill quieted-until the curse was finally discovered.

Bill's Catholic upbringing had never failed him, and while he doubted the belief in a supreme ""God"" in the universe, he couldn't deny that everything had a motion and a purpose to it.  ""-How can we live life when we condemn an innocent man to die?"" He believed that his share in the curse was penance for his sin against his friend-and his sin of lying to his family.  Sending away the only piece of the treasure he'd taken for himself, Bill prepared for any punishment that the crew might met out, but even he was surprised by the harsh nature of the punishment that Barbossa devised.

He stood at the bottom of the ocean for a year and a half-until Jones and the Dutchman made an underwater dive and spotted him.  Realizing that he wasn't going to be able to barter his way out with rum as he had with Jack, Bill sold his soul to Davy Jones and took the offer of a hundred years before the mast in payment for freeing him from the lonliness of the deep.

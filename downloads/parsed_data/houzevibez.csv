I have decided to just fking quit with everything....either they want to move to fast, or not fast enuf, or dont want to commit, but dont want you to commit to anyone else. I think i need to just get away from this place before i lose it. Give myself a chance to start over, and get into a new place....meet new people and maybe find someone worth caring about....or maybe im just sick of being hurt and taken advantage of....fuck, i dont know anymore."

"event","my dream came true this morning....it was awesome. i know its crazy.....

i ended up having to rescue chris and geno from humble last night. it was cool - seeing as i was heading out to brenham anyway. i left my house @ 6...and got to geno's at almost 10. even tho i wasnt there long....i try to take for granted every chance i can when im with him, just cuz i know that it'll end up being a few weeks b4 i can see him again. its amazing how one person can make you feel. especially when he told me...... <wink>

i went to UTMB to see Isaac. his temperature has been normal for the past few hours, and if his breathing gets better and his temp. stays normal for 24 hours, they'll let him go. jeanetta and jeff are just chillin up there-home away from home. jeanetta hasnt left the hospital since isaac was admitted...shiet,if my 2 year old son was in the hospital with pneumonia in both lungs - id fking be living there too. 

I guess i'll go back up there tomorrow....maybe i'll take them some real food - cuz hospital food sucks - i know - i work in one.

im exhausted - geno and i were up till 4 this morning and i woke up at 9:45am. drove for fucking ever to get home.....and BLAH

i miss muh bebeh"

"event","I will never understand how my mom's mind works. Knowing that i had to study last night for a final and type a review that was due this morning, she comes home at 9pm with a new (announcer voice) *4-in-one* printer/fax machine/copier/scanner. i just dont understand it. Earlier she was talking about how much money she and my dad lost in stocks over the past year, and she doesnt think we'll be able to afford our house - but she can go out and buy that when we already have all but the copier...ANYWAYZ

I got to see muh man thursday night. Like i said b4, you never realize just how much you miss someone, until you see them after not seeing them for like a week. hehehe - i know that people get sick of seein us all huggie n kissie...but ya know, new relationships are like that. The trick - is keepin it that way. Maybe thats why jeremy and I didnt make it. after about a year - he was too high to even remember that he had a g/f.....im glad i found better ;)

So - i made a 97 in intermediate AutoCAD, a 98 in yoga (i missed a couple times and she took off points for that) and i turn in my final in strength of materials on monday. i found out today tho, that my instructor from my autocad class, who is awesome, is teaching my commercial architecture class next semester. She also said that she'd be willing to write me a letter of recommendation for my app. to UH architecture school. So that gives me her and the engineering design graphics chairmen for recommendation letters. App. deadline isnt until march....so ive got alittle time to keep looking.

i need to shower...i was up till late talking wif Geno while he n david watched Snatch, and overslept for class this morning.I was glad to hear david laughing.....he'd been sounding WAAAAY to depressed in his journal. 

i wish i could go tonite =/

"event","Last year, on this day, I made it to Katy Mills mall early enuf to get front row parking. Jeanetta and I ate lunch at Moe's and had a few drinks to get the day of shopping done. We went from Katy Mills to Willowbrook Mall, to First Colony, and then home. The alcohol sure made Christmas shopping fun.....I spent today @ the Galleria.I got there, once again, early enuf to get awesome partking....no lunch or alcohol to get started, my i managed to stay there 5 hours, Christmas shopping for the many people on my list. All thats left, is my immediate family....and of course,muh man. The only reason i didnt get stuff for them yet is cuz, i have no earthly idea what to get them. My parents are weird about stuff....and well, what do I get the guy who has made me more happy in the past 3 weeks, than ive been in years? Im actually started to believe stuff i didnt b4....oh well, ive got 23 more days to come up with something......

Speakin of....muh sweetie came and went shopping with me today....him and Spoons. Spoons ""jail-bait radar"" was working over-time. I was there for a few hours b4 they got there so I had most of my shopping done by the time I met up with them. Gawd, it was sooooo good to see Geno ;) Its like, you dont realize exactly how much you miss someone, until you see them. We left the Galleria and went to Atomic to check out some vinyl. I found a few things that were aight....nothing worth touching my tables for, but Geno found a vinyl set that had some awesome disco house that he had apparently been looking for. Becuz of the look on his face when he listened to it (and the fact that all vinyl was 50% off) I had to get it for him. He was so pumped up about......

Grrrr...finals start tomorrow for me....ugh - the price we humans pay to actually get somewhere in life. AAANNNNDDD 
4 months and 16 days left till Im a free woman again..... 
So many things to look foward too....so little time.

"event","Finally, the circus has left my house. Man, it gets crazy around here. My mom like hates that I get ""unsociable"" around certian people in my family. My sister-in-law's a bitch, and i despise her attitude, and her mom - OMG she spends more time with dead people that a freaking mortician. Her husband died 3 years ago - and she's ALWAYS at that mosileum(sp?), its crazy. But everyone's entitled to their own weirdness.*shrug* 

So anyway, my headache's back....I wish i knew what was causing it. Everyone SWEARS its stress, but im not stressed out. I swear. Then again, how else do you explain a headache thats lasted for more that a month straight. I give up.

Okay, now I think im just rambling to satisfy myself. Boredum, according to my mother the shrink, is another form of anger....I guess she's right. I know that if I wasnt on probation, I would definately be out partying it up with my homies.....screw the legal justice system....i did that guy a favor selling him that stuff...hehehe. I just gotta remember: 4 months and 18 days left of this stewpid ass shit. I have to admit, the past year ana half flew by....

by the way....where's geno....he was supposed to call me right back, but that was an hour ago...."

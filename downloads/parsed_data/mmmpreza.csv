"event","Wow is the only thing that has come to mind in the past few months. Ive been through so many different things, that i dont even know where to begin. I guess Ill start with some good things. I Finally graduated, way way back in June. It was a great time, because it meant the end of an era for me, and the beginning of a new one. The party that night was great too, got to hang out with my class one last time. I had a ton of fun. The worst thing that happened that month however, was something that nobody saw coming. It was like a blow to the head. A good friend of mine, and other friends of mine, Committed suicide. We couldnt believe it. We were all dumbstruck. This boy, Brad Quashnie was the best person i knew. So nice, loving, caring. He had been through soo much, but he kept on going. Then out of nowhere he killed himself. It sucked real bad, because no one ever knew, and what was worse, we will never know. That month was the worst. Ill never forget Brad. Lets see. After that unfortunate string of events, I kept going. I missed out on the Japan Trip, cause it got cancelled, due to lack of management on the teachers part. I also missed senior week, but It was for the best.I was granted the right to get a project car, and it is currently being worked on. Its a 92 civic Hatchback, and its gonna tear up. Ive grown closer To Robert Libely then ever before. Hes such a great friend. We went hiking, and it was cool. I drove Mike Williams car, and while driving it, it died. So i helped replace the tranny, by getting one in Albany NEW YORK! I drove an entire days worth just for that. Now we're getting a diff. one, cause that one is messed up. So much crap. Im never driving another persons car again. I then went camping with Dillon, Zach, and their Dads. It rocked. We had a ton of fun, and went water skiing and cliff jumping. Works been sucking, but its almost done. I cant wait. Ive discovered that my current manager Scott does no work, what so ever. Its sad really. When he tells us to pick it up, its retarded, cause he doesnt do any work at all. He seems to enjoy picking on me especially. Ive done nothing but work my ass off, and all he can do is ridicule me. All the other places ive gone to, They love me. HEs just an asshole. Ive worked At Trading lane, 7th street, Middletown, and Jefferson st. and love them all. We get along great. Sides I dont work at my store any way, cause im leaving, so scotts trying to phase me out. I think thats pretty gay. Im going to go to Harold the DM soon about all this, cause its not fair. The Jefferson street run is cool, cause its the midnight run 12-8am. Jenny works there to, and she's looking out for me. We just got back from Otakon, and it kicked ass. Zach, Sac, Dillon, Myself, Jason, and his woman all went. Sac made the best ACE ever, actually the only one this year. I tore up as the buffest Zoro, and Dillon was the biggest luffy. I bought a sword that looks identical to Wado, Zoros white sword. My hair is green too. lol. Me and the zachs both got drunk friday, and saturday night, and it was hilarious. There was this pretty cute chick there too that wanted to marry me! i gave her my email, so i hope i get to talk to her some more. Yorks only a few weeks away. I cant wait. Until next time..."

"event","Work sucks. It sucks a Lot. Being a Shift supervisor is crappy. I was fine with the job until a week ago. Scott says two, but really its only one. We have a money problem. Imprest, or the amount of money the store must have at all time has been short a lot. Altho its not a big amount (only 11 to 10 dollars) every one is kirking out (including me) to find where it went. Since it happens on my shift, I get in trouble, but Im not taking the Fucking money! So Scott and I are pulling hair trying to find out who is taking it. So far no luck. Ive been written up twice. I dont think i get too many more chances, despite the fact that im not the one doing this shit. The other part of work stress, is getting people to do stuff for me. Im still feeling that out, and scott thinks i can do better. Well there were a few days where i could, so i give him that, but for the most part, im doing a damn good job. Then theres stress from my FCC class. Im two tests behind, and i need to catch up, but have no time, so im stressing about that. AP tests are this week too and havent had time to study. Havent had time to do anything fun either. The best time i had this week was going out to eat with Sara. That was amusing. I hate this shit.

We both got messed up, but he got it so bad that he crapped himself twice! I peed on a dryer and started preaching through a depression part. So they say anyway. I dont remember anything after i changed but it was good times. Bj got alcohol poisoning tho. I felt bad for the boy. He has to build up a tolerance i guess. I was fine, except for the 4 hours that felt like someone soccer kicked me in the back of the skull. Then fast forward to wednesday. I got nailed really bad with whatever i have, and missed thurs. and fri. sucks. I missed a damn week, and the term ends next week! Shit! Fcc test coming so got to study that too. I lost GALAXIES GOD DAMMIT! That really pissed me off. You have no idea. So now im just gonna wait till fall to start playing again due to the fact that ill have broadband. Ugh. That sucked. Got Re2 in prep. for RE:Outbreak. Oh man the countdown begins. The outbreak will come, and the horror will begin! I cant wait!!!! Thats enough outta me. D,Z,Z and J will bring money tommorrow I hope.

"event","Well as promised here is the second update. This one involves not so much fun. More or less my love life, and relationships. 

Janelle is back. YAY! She leaves soon. BOO! She decided to go home and go to college! YAY! She quit smoking! YAY! She still doesnt get how I feel! BOO! Im still on a rocky road. Why is it that the one girl I want I cant seem to land!?!?! I had her, then she said we should stop before it goes anywhere. Well you know something? I dont want it to stop. I want it to go somewhere. Its not just physical dammit! She is the first girl that I love for just being her. Her personality, the way she makes me feel, the way I act around her. Id do anything for this girl. Shit Id follow her back to MAINE! She says Im a fool. Maybe i am? But I know what i feel dammit and it hurts. This might be the first time ive ever felt this way. I look back on the few ive been with already, and realize she is the first one to drive me wild. I cant believe this! they say things happen for a reason, but I say fuck it. They say theres someone out there for everyone, well this is the one I want! ARGH!!! I have to make her understand how I feel I guess. That Bryan ADAMS song ""Everything I do"" thats how I fucking feel. But Im still being denied. Im being used again it seems maybe. We are friends. But I want the relationship. Not everyone has someone I guess. But I know how it feels TO have someone, and being alone sucks. All that searching, then you find someone you think you want, and then you cant have it. It slaps you in the face. Its cold. It sucks. And then I have Katlynd. I will be contacting her tommorrow. Its about fucking time. This has been a Long time coming. I dont even know her anymore in a sense. But id like to learn again. I messed that up, and I still want that companionship. Well thats it. I got it off my chest. goodnight, and I want a girlfriend!"

"event","Well hello all. Havent updated in abit so i will do two at once! Ive been in a weird mood where im up one minute then down the next. Maybe im Bipolar? That would fucking suck. I hope im not. Anyhoo. Saw Dawn of the Dead with a ton of peeps tonight! All co-workers too. Myself, Janelle, Kristin, Loren, Rachel, Aziz, Joe, and his wifey Heather. Let me just say this movie is what Resident Evil two would look like if it was done right. In my opinion this movie was resident evil two. It was great. Except for the part that these bastards can sprint, the zombies were identical. Such a good movie. They even snipe Burt Renolyds' zombie and even Jay Leno zombie! That was great. I stopped by Dillons after school to show him some uber new movies for upcoming fighters, and he showed me the new trailer for Final Fantasy7 Advent of Children. Oh my goodness does that movie look sweet. I cant even wait! VINCENT! ZAK! CLOUD! and dare I say it? SEPHIROTH CLONES!@!@?! It looks nutty. Then we scoped out Samurai Showdown 5. Thats going to be my personal best pick for 2004 fighters this year. Altho, we did see a brand new title by Sammy, the dudes who did Guilty Gear. We all know how obscure and underground the first one was, and all the advancements in fighting games it made. Well it seems Sammy is pioneering another new brawler and it looks to be a shoe in. Under the title of THE Rumble Fish (weird name huh?) the roster of selectable characters are small, but the ingame looks insane. The characters are a cross between 2D, 3D, and Cel shadings. The system is fast paced, and seems to be combo oriented. The most important inovation it seems tho, (besides the new graphics engine) lies in the fact that for the first time, fighters in a 2D style game take real battle damage, and slowly lose parts of clothing. The more a character blocks, or takes hits, the more damaged the garment. One character almost lost his entire shirt, but it looked sweet. Anyhoo, Dillon and the rest are now aware of the cost, so the collection will be in soon. Tommorrow I have a bake sale, then a party. Im getting trashed cause i dont work. I hope its a good one, I need to blow off steam.

Turns out it was just some hardcore gas, but at first we thought it could have been internal bleeding because I got hit pretty good during the tournament yesterday. Speaking of which, i took Second place in forms in my division! YAY! Sparring i got beat pretty bad tho...Everyone competed and in my opinion did a fairly good job. Altho Jase and a few others should have placed because Traditional is soo much better than that show off crap. Tradition is dead, but not forgotten. Our school will someday revive it. It was scary. Our school was like the only traditional TKD school there! Oh well. Tired now. Didnt go to school or fcc, but i need cash so work. Well ill drop a line later. Bye!

"event","Greetings and Salutations! ITs me Raymond PRice everyones favorite whiner! Its been a few days since an update and I need to type to remember. LEts see... Last Night I saw 50 First Dates for the second time. I took Janelle. We had a good time I think. I gave her my Vday gift, because she was away for vday. I hope she liked it. Im still confused about this relationship thing. Im still the friend. It sucks, and it doesnt suck. If that makes any fucking sense at all. I just have to stop getting my hopes up when I take her out, because every time I do, they get crushed. I emailed Katlynd and told her how I felt, and she emailed me back. Things are cool i guess, but I havent actually spoken with her yet. We need to go out and have coffee or something soon. Maybe next weekend... Friday I skipped school with a friend of mine, Ray Wolfe. We washed our cars,went to TnS for my intake questions, ate at Arbys, went to Best Buy, and saw 50 first Dates for the first time. Now hold up. That sounds kinda gay doesnt it?? Well it wasnt just me and him at the movies! He met some chick who goes to TJ high, by chance, and she had a friend. I got the friend, who in my opinion is hotter. Her names Tina, shes a sophmore, and a Cheerleader! I called her last night before I went out with Janelle. I hope she calls me back. I want to get to know more about her... I also priced my sound system for my car. About 220. So next paycheck I get, I get to go shopping. Next week, I will also be dropping my car at TnS for a day to get my intake in. Then bug dad about getting Taxes done so I can Lower my car.
Ok thats all about me. I work till 4:00 today, and Im going to contact Dillon,and Zach and Jason, and have them over so we can talk with Emily. Otakon is going to be crazy. Whats going to be crazier than Otakon?? Japan!! thats what. Ok well Ill write again later. Peace out."

"event","Wow is all I can say to start this post off. The ""relationship"" I was in deffinently took a turn to the newside. Now I know how it feels to have great feelings for someone, but get nothing in return. However, this relationship is not bad. I hold no ill will towards Janelle. In my opinion, its better to have loved and lost, instead of never loved at all right? I know, cheese. This relationship opened my eyes tho. I know what i want now. Its taken me a long time to come to a realization about things. Janelle has come from a very hard background. Her past relationships with others were crap. She even admitted it to me. But for some reason, this guy Adrian, she still holds feelings for. She was hurt. I guess in a way I feel similar in regards to her. She once said that its like going after the one thing you know you cant have, and you keep hoping and trying, but itll never happen. Plus she went out with him for like 4 years, so of course theres feelings, but this guy has two kids, and hes only 18! He needs to step it up. Had Janelle stayed around she'd have ended up with the kids. Its not that she doesnt have feelings for me, but shes just not ready. Im cool with that. Im more like a ""brother"". Ugh. But this has taught me a lesson. Ill probably keep in touch with her. AT least id like to. I know nothings going to happen now. OR at least in the near future. But id like to be her friend. Be there for her if I can. Supply support. Once shes gone itll probably better. I knew she was leaving so what did I want? I really dont know the answer myself. Just another adventure in love and heartache. Speaking of which, Ive finally, Finally, come to grips with what went on with Katlynd. I wasnt ready. But now I think I am. I hurt her. I cant stand that. I chose some stuck up Soccer brat from a private school over someone who had real feelings for me. I harbored the same ones. Still do, but instead i ignored them. I hope she can forgive me. Well thats all the drama in my life, for now anyway. I cant stand this shit, but you know me, im a sucker for a cute girl. Well thats it from this end. Im out."

"event","Well ive been through a lot for the past week it seems. I really dont know where to begin. Janelle and I are at a crossroad at which we've never been before. We're friends, but theres something more there. Ive never met anyone like her. She has lived through so much and has come out stronger. Her predicament in growing up is quite similar to my own, except for different circumstances. This was what hit off the comrade ship we share for each other. After that Wednesday night however things changed. We expressed our feelings, but then we both kinda felt bad. I know she's leaving, so i just want to be with her until she leaves. She needs a friend and im there for her. She acknowledges my feelings, and shares similar ones, but she says she feels guilty, thus making me feel bad for invoking those feelings. I say we can just be friends, and i say I can cope, but deep down Im not okay with that. She knows that i think. So now we're just in lingo. I guess we'll just try this friends thing some more, but I dont know how long i can take it sitting still. I just want to be there for her, and maybe fill the void, take away some stress and pain. But it seems i might just be adding to the problem. I dont know dammit!!! and it sucks. Oh well V-day is soon so maybe it will work out. Its nuts. Other than that im pretty good, still alive, lifting weights. TKD today for the first time in awhile too. Also debating an ear ring. Why you might ask? Because i feel like it thats why! And lastly Im going to be buying a croch rocket. Its about time i learn how to drive on two wheels. Besides they're pretty cheap. Well im out!"

"event","Wow. That's all I have to say. It's been awhile since I've been to school ontime, and no delays. We had a 5 day weekend because of the snow. It rocked. Alot of crap went down over those five days as well. Lets see. On Sunday I went out with Janelle and we saw Somethings Gotta Give with Jack Nicholson. That movie was hilarious. It was going to be kinda intiment too because at first it was just us, then a few people showed up. Oh well. Then we headed to TGIF, and had Megan again. This time I made up for not leaving a tip. By the time we left, the snow was coming down like rain, and it was pretty crazy. I then took her home, and then went to bed. Next morning, suprise suprise, no school. So I woke up, worked out in the basement, then went sledding. Zach and I were out till about 930. We were having a great time until we were ready to go home. Zach says ""Man it would suck if you lost your keys."" Jokingly, of course. Then it happened. I couldnt find my keys! They were lost! So we hike to Zmans house and we get flash lights and then we search it up and down for an Hour!(in Woodsboro) In defeat I have Zach drive me home and I pray we have a spare witch we did. So back to the car, and out of sheer frustration I do crazy burnouts, Donuts, figure eights, drifts, and the grand finale, a large 360 and then a revese 360. It was great. Then home to sleep again. Tuesday. Sledding again. This time it was a large crew. Me, Dillon, Zach A., Zach M., John Zhang, Jase, Ricky, Jenna, and her friend. Dillon got some good footage, and we were there for like two hours. I searched in vain for my keys, because it snowed harder that day than any of the others. Then saw Underworld at Dillons house. It was great. Then home to sleep yet again. Then Wednesday. FCC class for the first time, except that the teacher didnt show up! So no class. So I decided to hang out with Janelle. I picked her up, got groceries, and then hung out at Wonderbook and Video until she had to go to work. Then, on the way home I saw dad on the side of the road. So I stopped and we looked at the Ford van on the side of the road. Then I waited for him and took him to our driveway after he parked at the church. Then we got stuck. It sucked. So after warming up, we dug out. Then I went to go pickup Janelle. We then headed to the movies yet again. We saw Mona Lisa Smile, which was a decent movie in my opinion. A good depiction of the time period. The best part was that it was just me and her this time. No one else. So it was pretty good. Then I drove her home and came home. It was about 1240. Mom stayed up and was pissed at me, but I was like whatver. I really didnt care. I had a great time. It was one of those spur of the moment things. Yesterday school after a 2 hour delay, then took dad to Hanover to drop off ellie's car. Speaking of cars, my car needs work, and turns out I wont be selling it until next year, because I'll be getting a WRX!!! WhooHOOO!!! Ok well thats about it. Work today and tommorrow. So thats whats been going on. PEACE!"

I worked off and on this whole week. I work today dammit! Umm havent done much. Yesterday was awsome, because all I did was sit on my ass. Its been awhile since I could do that. Sunday was awsome. I took Janelle out and we saw Along came Polly. That movie was hilarious. Ben Stiller never ceaces to amuse me. Then we went to Fridays for a drink. Non alcoholic thankyou very much! We talked for about an hour and a half, then we went driving. Went all over. Discovery, Woodsboro, Copper oaks, even past our house, but it was late, so we didnt stop. Took her home where we talked some more. I love this girl. Shes great. We click, but we're not serious, and I like that and I dont. It's a good relationship. Then worked, and slept. Picked up JDM Insider and Initial D volume 3. Both were awsome, especially JDM insider. It just makes me want to go to Japan even more! Dads being gay about the car stuff again. I dont know why he doesn't understand that its not that difficult to do what I want. I hardly ever ask stuff of him. It would be nice if he would agree to it, because it would be a great bonding experience, I think anyway. Other than that, not much. I feel kinda bad for not hanging with anyone this week. Oh well. Screw it. thats it for today, so Peace out! and beware the PANTY MAN!!!!"

Since every one of the witnesses showed up today, the defendant pled guilty, and we left. Simple as that. I missed third and fourth, so that was cool. I got my SATs from December, and I only increased a little. 1080. Oh well. I have my term 2 final tommorrow in Cisco, so I hope that goes well. Also have to write essay for J-exchange before Friday. This weekend I also have to remember to go to my detention, because I missed it. This thing was from when D-man and I dipped on ap lit back at the begining of December. Mom and Dad will be gone for the next couple of days, so itll be pretty chill for abit. In other news, back in the dating world. Went out on Friday of last week, and I had a blast, and as far as I could tell so did my date. We saw Bad Santa, then went out to eat. Theres something about her. When we were out I had so much fun. I hadnt enjoyed myself for a long time. It was a long time coming. Ive grown from my experiences I think. Im rambling so Ill let people go. Until then, Stop smoking!"

Still am actually, or maybe just lack of sleep or combo of both...I also vow to not drink beer, because it tastes like complete ass. Even with saying that I had 5, and 2 shots of captain morgan (shit burned), and an entire case of coke. Then water, burritos, and some Swisher cigars to finish off the night/ morning. The only gay thing was that James lal drank just about the whole thing of captain morgan in like 45 minutes. Big nono. He was messed up for the rest of the night. Then Zach had his limit, and crashed through a screen door. That was kind of amusing. So yeah back to school I go tommorrow. I had my night of relaxation, so now back to hell in a handbasket.

"event","Well you know what? Ive realized that I have no fucking life and that relying on others always leads to disappointments. For example this evening supposed to go out, but now ""oh dont come over"" so whatever. I realized I had more fun on new years eve last year at Heathers than any other year, considering it was the first time I actually did a damn thing on new years. Plus all I ever do is work, and so here I am again tired, bitchy and home doing nothing except being bored and pissed. Well I guess Ill eat something or play some video games, but for the most part I am tired, so I might just say fuck it and sleep. who knows. It seems im the only damn person not doing anything for new years so everyone have a fun holiday and be safe, dont drink and drive, and remember there are those who can be hurt by your actions so be careful. Well thats it from this end. Maybe I should find a girlfriend, or at least get a car I can focus on, because right now I think Im missing out. PEACE"

"event","Well I know my devoted fans out there are dying to find out all about my christmas and past events....(yeah right,who reads these damn things except myself? oh well screw it here goes) So christmas was good, tons upon tons of anime stuff this year. I really handnt had a year like this in a long time. I got the rest of GTO on DVD (god I love crazy teachers!), GTO volume 14 and 15 in manga form (MAYU is such a bitch, he will get his!) A ton of random Naruto stuff (best of all mini plush ROCK LEE!) clothing to pimp myself out, cds out the butt, and other useful stuff like money! Then after xmas we ('rents and myself) went to York to get some more clothes for me. Then I spent the night at dillons after seeing the Last Samurai. Critics suck. Tom Cruise was good. There were maybe two parts when I was like ""umm... why does tom get to live?"" but other than that he was good. Then I had an outing with L who I hadnt seen in a long time. She was deffinently looking good. We saw Lord of the rings (my second viewing, but its a good movie!) and ate at quiznos and chilled at Starbucks ( not in that order) Then back to her house for smores and to see her basement. Its completely different. It must be nice to have money to throw around. Then back to get Dillon who was staying over. Last night actually. He wittnessed the greatness that was Pulp Fiction. God I love that movie. Cant beat it. Then off to College Park with Emily today. We hit up Starland, Pandoras Cube, Cluck U and then TYsons corner. I got my Cube back and bought volume 8 (although it wasnt Dammit!!!) of naruto. Then I bought The Naruto game. Oh my god. IT is the best game ever! I mean Rock lee and Kakashi? what else do you need! Well I need to stop for now cause Im on the other phone line. So talk to people later. peace out"

All of the movies were good, but that one has a special feel to it that the others lacked. Crazy action, and the music made the movie. Placed forth out of five students who placed in the skills USA competition at cisco. That was cool. TKD got canceled, so went back home and did homework. Also payed emily for her present and for the game cube mod. Also If you read this emily try and get volume 6 from PANDORAS today!!!!! Well Im out. Work to 12 today and tommorrow, so Ill be beat.

We just took our stuff and walked out the door. Then we tried to see Last Samurai, but that didnt work, so we headed back to his house and started working. Mrs. Trullson came home and kinda flipped, but she was glad we were doing our project. Then had to work. Non stop people, and we're open to freaking 12 this whole damn week. Then I went back Dillon's house and finished the project. It was pretty retarded. Went home and then didn't sleep until 1245. Ugh. Im tottally outta it. In other news, Im getting the game cube modded so I can Get the NARUTO fighting game. It fucking rocks! Also thanks To emily for Volume 7 of naruto! Just need to get volume 6! Well Im out.

I have to make a powerpoint tonight On Romantic Impulses of the 1820s. Very boring. Then I have to make copies of a survey and make predictions about the results for AP Lit. Also I have my FCC finals, and I work tonight! Owen Meany is a great book, but it is due on next tuesday which sucks because the book is long. Last night at TKD I sparred and fell (ouch!) then I sparred Dillon. I won! Before class however, there were thugs about at Jase's house. They were causing havoc in a neighborhood of nice old people. That just wouldnt fly. These kids were just throwing snowballs, then Tree branches, and then themselves at cars! We had to stop them. I caught them first due to my inate athletic ability, plus because I was so pumped to test my skills. Jase snuck up behinde them. We we're just about ready to jump em when a cop rolled up. A female cop who seemed more intimmidated by us then the rugrats, she seemed new to the force. She seemed green, and it looks like she let them off easy. So me Jase Brad and Dillon are going to be waiting to go thug bashing as soon as Mrs. N tells us they're back. We will strike like ninja, and they wont do it again. I know they wont....HAHAHAHA!

Even if I wasnt a fan of DBZ Id still call this a great fighting game. I dont know what the hell the game mags are talking about, but this game rules! Well, no SATS, no school yesterday, and no work for the past few days. Church tommorrow, and reading. I hung out with my boys for awhile yesterday, and I was going to spend the night, but for some stupid reason dad drives all the way in to follow me home in the dangeroust part of the night. It was really homo! Played some MArio kart double dash. Deffinently getting that game. Going to do the Couch sled with my NHS buddies (not the National honor society! my renegade friends who make jackass look stupid) at the woodsboro hill. Went sledding.

"event","Hello all its time for the mega update! Well The past couple weeks have been interesting to say the least. The first step on my new education has begun! I got accepted to York! YAY! Go me! Well now I need to go get some scholarships! Also, I've been working and making money which is always a good thing. Jennie my manager, is gone due to family tragedy (sorry!) so Joe the crazy stock room manager is taking over. Oh well. Jase cancelled not once but TWICE on me, to go see Matrix this past weekend. So I still havent seen it. I will tho dammit! I must! I bought some stuff too. I picked up Initial D volume 1, Hard Drive, Ill Nino's second Album, the last two manga volumes of Love Hina, and The 13th volume of GTO. So I indulged myself some. I have a paper due today, and feel bad about not finishing, so tonight it will be done! Also have senior interviews, which means I get to wear my new suit, cut my hair and shave, because currently I am one hairy mofo. Max Payne 2 was awsome as well, but a tad short. Lets see, Indoor soccer is coming together slowly, and it seems like the old crew will have a great time. Lastly on my list, I have decided to sell my Subaru. This decision came afeter weeks of thinking. I originally didnt plan to do this, but after wittnessing what a Honda could do, it stayed in the back of my mind. I just had to have that platform. Dont get me wrong, I love Subaru to death, but its time that I learned stick, as well as tuning on that particular platform. By that platform I mean either an EF or EG hatchback. I shall keep the Honda through college, and as a daily driver. Then I will return with more money and be ready to get a Subaru again. For now tho. I shall be leaving my company, and joining a new one. Until then ""All that lies in me, all that dies in me. How can I live without you?""-Ill Nino ""How can I?""

Hanging out and all. I miss that. I've cut myself away from them. It makes me feel sad. Its like i have no friends. It sounds funny I guess, but I just dont know anything anymore. I dont even have time to hang out with Dillon or John. Jason is always with his woman, and me? Im just all alone. Working and schooling. I need a break.

I cant really spell the Korean name, but I can americanize the way we say it. It is called Hi an Samdan. Its a really cool form, but some of the moves are hard. I will master it! Sensei Jase has been kicking our asses, but I know its because he knows we can handle it, and become even stronger. I sparred Jase for the first time in like a year. He completely destroyed me, but I got a few of my own points in. My roundhouse is deadly! It just goes to show how much I still need to improve. One day Jase, one day.... Yesterday I got my test back from FCC that I thought I bombed. I actually did decently, since I do hate math. Then off to work. Jenny was going crazy with decorating, but it was fun. I got a raise!!! I got it pretty early too! Thats cause Im such a hard worker! I looked at my damn schedule wrong, and it turns out I have Friday off, not Saturday. Thats good in a way, because now I can see Revolutions sooner! I still havent heard from Ayane, so I guess she doesn't like me!:( Heh. She hasnt even met me, so she's probably like, who the hell is this guy? Lets see what else? I saw a girl named Christine who graduated last year. She gave me some advice/cheering up (not really, but it helped me a little). So, yeah, well Im going for my date with Hillary (I hope!) Going to aske today. Well gots to get back to Cisco!

"event","Holy crap everyone! Yesterday was the craziest day I have had in along time! School was good, and then I came home. Mom wasnt home, and I had a call from Joe. I was like ""No way in hell IM working on a Tuesday!"" Then I headed upstairs to my room. I walk in, and I was like what the hell? I had a brand new tv on my floor! Mom left a note, and said that it was one of my early college furnishings. I wasn't complaining! I was overjoyed. Then we took Sam (the dog) to the vet, because he hurt his toe. After that, the incident of doom.
I was getting ready to leave, and right before I left for TKD, my mom lectured me about being late. I really had no time to listen to this, but humored her. I then left. I was driving along fine, with the heat blasting. I exited New Midway, and hit the long stretch of 194. Right as I hit the quarry section on my right, I blacked out. Not like a seisure, but sleep. I was overcome with this immense weariness. I think it was from the heat. I also believe it happened because Im familiar with the road. I travel that way like 5 times a day. SoI blacked out for like a minute it seems, (probably only 20 seconds) and I jolt. The thing that woke me up was that I felt my steering wheel turn in and dift to the right. The first thing Im thinking is that moms driving. Then I realize Im in the drivers seat, and absolute fear and dread over take me. The guard rail is coming at me at like 60 mph, and I cant do shit to miss it. I thank my quick reaction time for not wrecking my car. I immediately swerve, and only cause a minor scratch on the side of my car. (I was damn lucky!) Now Im feeling like I just dodged a bullet, and adrenalin is coursing through my body. Never again will that happen. I was soo scared! I call the scratch my third ""pinstripe"". AH!!! It still bothers me! Then went to TKD, worked out, came home and slept.
Today, and right this minute, I have to take my Semester 1 final in cisco. Luckily we get two shots. I really dont want to take this test. GRRR.
Well congrats on your win L, and yeah, we can hang out again if you want. Just call me or something, and good luck tommorrow.
Emily! I need to steal your scanner!
Until then, Guard rails are the devil! SATAN!

That was fun, because I hadnt seen her since SATs, so it was all good. Also quick shout out to L, Congrats on that scholar ship! And dont worry, youll get into The Mount. Lets see, I also saw Chrissa who was supposed to be in Arizona, but came home for the Battle of the bands. She was looking good as ever. Yesterday, I hung out with B-kun for most of the day. We went to Keiths comic shop in Westminister, and then headed to Best Buy, and Game Stop. Then went to Office Max and Talked with John Price (no relation), everyones favorite A D D man. Brian and I got invited to a Comedy showing, so we went, more on that later. We then proceeded to TGIF to wait for emily to get off. While we waited, we ate some hot wings, and talked about the hostesses. Some of them were pretty hot! Then we came home. I did Purchase VF4:EO while we were out. I couldnt resist, because it was only 20 bucks, and I needed a new 3d fighter anyway. I then stayed home and played VF for a few hours, and then called Chrissa. Turns out Dillon, Brad, Jase, and Chrissa were all at the battle of the bands, so I headed in. We hung out, saw our band perform and just had fun. Chrissa got in trouble because her parents found out that she was home, but her parents werent too pissed. Becky was in our performance for color guard, and did pretty good. Also got surprised, because alot of the tkd people were down there too. Jonathan, Melanie, and Anand were there. Saw Chris Kotchs aunts, but I mistook one of them for mrs. Kotch. I always forget that she has two twin sisters, so I felt kinda dumb, but chatted with them anyway. Lets see... Oh, played old school doom at a Lan party after we left the bands. It was at Daves house, and it was real fun. Then Headed out to the comedy sketch. It was being held at the old Frederick Hotel that just got turned into appartments thats by the court house. It was like a whos line is it anyway thing, but it was really funny. Then saw Johns appartment (in the hotel). It is really nice. Id like to live in a place like that. Finally got home around 130 in the morning. Whew. what an update. This morning I spent a few hours playing vf4, and I love it. Now I must get dressed, and help mow the lawn. Also have to read stuff. Well until then, Love people and use things; not love things and use people...~Raymond"

I had to change my whole style last night and believe me it wasnt easy! The self-defense part was hard as well, because I missed like 2 months worth of class. But I passed with flying colors! Ill be tested for my Blue before the end of this year too! I was technically green anyway, just not official. My arms still hurt too. I have to work tonight till like 930, and I dont want to, but I did get off this whole weekend! I really need to ask Hilary out, even just as a friend. I just didnt have it in me. Im such a freaking loser. I always tell myself nothing ventured nothing gained, so I just need to do it! I hate school. I have a lot of crap due today, and I just dont feel like doing it, but I probably will. Good news is my exhaust will be built next week so thats cool. Also recruited another player for my indoor team, Brad! He hasnt played for awhile, but I peaked his interest, and is now in! So soon Ill have a decent team! well I gotta get back to work blah. L if you see this when you get home, Ill call you, but I wont get off work until 915 or later, but Id love to come.Until then, Life is like a pubic hair on a toilet seat, at some point your going to get pissed off.~ Raymond"

"event","Well this morning was interesting. I came downstairs, and I heard my mom crying. I wondered what about and she told me. Harry Zufall, one of my moms friends was killed yesterday. I was friends with the Zufalls son aaron. I was shocked to discover this because the Zufalls are the nicest people in the world. I couldn't believe something like this could happen. It just goes to show you how fragile a human life is. One minute your here the next your not. I remember Mr. Zufall as a kind, loving free spirit. My thoughts and prayers go out to Mrs. Zufall and the rest of the family for suffering such a loss.
Life is a humbling experience, raymond"

"event","Hello all my fans! Well Just got back from the TKD, and am dead! I lost my wallet, and I almost had a freaking heart attack because I couldnt find it. But its ok! I found it! you can return to your daily lives as usual. Another happening today was that Mrs. Trullson gave me some fudge, peanut butter truffle to be exact, and it was good. But while I was eating it she thought I was allergic to peanuts and started freaking out!! I was cracking up! Plus Hilary wants my senior pic, so nows my chance to get that date Ive been wanting. Well I also want to hang out with L too. Anyhoo got Spartans, and everyone have a good evening!

Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl<br>(Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum<br>(Egyptian).
The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life,<br>the number 0, and the element of fire.
His sign is the eclipsed sun.

As a member of Form 0, you are a determined<br>individual.  You tend to keep your sense of<br>optomism, even through tough times and have a<br>positive outlook on most situations.

"event","Well I really didnt do an extensive update recently, so here goes.This past week in school has been crazy. Monday was the only day we had a full day of school, so that was all good. Tuesday I had my second TKD class, and Sensei Reese was there, so I got beat into the ground! The next day I was so sore. Wednesday, I didnt see all that much action. Dillon and I hung out too. Dillon and his Family are gone right now. They are at the beach for their family vacation. Yesterday, I visited York College. I loved it! The only thing that is holding me from getting in is My SAT scores. So Hopefully the one I took on Saturday wen well... I really hope I did well. THe dorms were typical, but were clean, and seemed fairly new. Plus once Im there for a couple years, I can get into an appartment, so thats what Id like to do. I cant wait. I also have my B-day coming up, and Senior week in a few months, as well as the best part...JAPAN!!! I cant wait. I just want the school year to be over so I can go abroad. I hope that I have a good experience there, because Ive always wanted to go there ever since my sister went when I was in sixth grade.Ive been waiting for this! I guess you could say that this trip is my graduation gift from the rents sooo I dont mind. I need to start working on my computer so I can get it up to snuff as well. Lastly! I met with Ben Hartlaub on our way back from York. I want his cars!!! I probably won't get them, but Ill employ him to work on mine, so I can get mine to look similar to his. Well until then, Life is a challenge, roll with the punches, because tommorrow will be another day! ~Raymond"

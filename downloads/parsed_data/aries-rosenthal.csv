"event","YAY!!! WE MADE IT BACK.... UNINJURED...SOMEWHAT!! xDD; Let's see... Where to begin....&nbsp;

Good News: WE MADE IT TO SOMERSET.
Bad News: -.- ; We got lost along the way.

Good News: CHARMAINE (Sweet 16 celebrant) LOOKED AMAZING!!! (even though we were forced to attend her party ish )
Bad News: x'D ; ...... We er... kind of... er... How should I say this... Almost set the table on fire (LONG STORY BUT IT INVOLVED THE CANDLES!!)

Good News: YAY!! GOT TO SEE MY FRIENDS!!!
Bad News: ; ; We had to leave... And they had to leave to get back home as well...

SUPERLY AMAZING NEWS: WE GET TO SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN IN A FEW WEEKS (Or was it days?)&nbsp;

Reason being: .....ANDRE'S 16TH BIRTHDAY'S COMING UP!!! xDD; NO STUFFY DRESSES AND BAD DJs!!!&nbsp;

^o^; Andre brought up the idea to her parents (WOO!! ) to have her 16th birthday party at Six Flags... And her parents said maybe... Which normally means yes... So.... xDD; All hell shall break loose.&nbsp;

Bah. I'm so tired! Not from the party itself... @@; But from walking all over the place in high heels because I got lost in the hotel... (High heels hurt!)&nbsp;

&gt;o&lt; ; I can't wait to see you guys soon! You really know how to make the sad thoughts go away! ( &gt;.&gt; ; Not by holding me down to take medicine though... )

-----------------------------

xD; Despite getting lost and all the other incidents... This day wasn't so bad for once. It's actually a first!"

"event","How ironic. The girl that always has something to say doesn't have anything to say this time. I just didn't have anything worth entering yesterday since I lost my voice. The loss of one's voice... Silence. It really gets to you. That or an anti-social Pinay *Nuu Joisey resident just has her moments. 

*New Jersey. I've been gaining a heavy Brooklyn/Joisey accent since I started high school. I don't know why though but I've also started typing things how I say them in real life. Jersey becomes Joisey and crayon becames crayin. Just damn amazing isn't it? XD

Yes. I don't have much to say... I just feel like spamming this entry with pictures of Kichi, my MNF Shiwoo. But unfortunately... My camera's broken... So I have to rely on my cellphone for pictures.

<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y104/Crazed_Asian_Girl/Kichi2.jpg"" />
Kichi: Ne... D'you think your cousins will like me? I mean, they aren't always that accepting of your friends. How much more a doll? Remember that brunette's reaction?
Me: Of course they'll love you! They love everything that I do. My god, they practically stalk me just to figure out if I have a new hobby! 
Kichi: If you're sure...

Me: I mean, who can resist that face? You're Kichi!
Kichi: ..... 

Later on... Kichi was tired after a long day of being hugged and anxiety of meeting my cousins in a few days so he decided to take a nap... Only to be woken up soon after...

Kichi: *wakes up* Guh...

Kichi: ........

Kichi: HUZZAH!!1 BACK TO ASIA I GO!!!!! BUY MY TICKET NOW!
Me: >>; But I don't have enough money... That and we aren't stopping by Seoul if we're going to the Philippines... We're going straight to Cebu, the place where I got Ai from.
Kichi: ......... BUY TICKETS!!! HUZZAH!!!
Me: *anime fall* 

^_^; I can't wait to meet Uno and Joey when/if I go back to Cebu! Kichi seems excited but I guess it's because he's an MNF Shiwoo. XD; Oh how I love this boy!"

"event","Well... Nothing much happened. Field trip and such. I was asleep for the most part.  Knew everything that the tour guide was talking about and ended up correcting them. Sometimes I think I know too much for my own good. This knowledge will probably be my downfall one day but hell. Enjoy what you can while you still have it eh? I didn't really enjoy this trip as much as I thought I would. I was pretty anti-social for the most part. I don't have that many friends in my classes since no one seems to share the same interests as me. I guess you could say that I'm just that person in the background that people ignore until they request for my use. Oh well. I'm used to it. I just hope that next year, there'll be a new person in my classes that shares my interests and we could be friends.
Kichi's coming to RAD club tomorrow. I hope he'll be okay in my locker for most of the day. I feel sorry about leaving the little bugger all alone in that locker with my books but where else shall I put him? I'll scare the crap out of my homeroom (Hell. I'd love to!) but then I might get reported for ""Satanic"" objects again. I can't fit it in anybody else's locker since they wouldn't agree. And I can't carry him around with me. (Such a shame indeed!) I hope he'll be okay. 

Well, I don't really know what to call this post. Whether it be emo or bittersweet, that is for you to decide my dear reader. Vale for now."

Screw this. I can't do happy. I guess the closest thing to happy right now is that Kichi's coming to school on Thursday. There's a chance that I'll get reported for Satanic/Gothic material... (Yes. It has happened on numerous occassions.) But screw them. Kichi's coming to school! But he's staying on my lap the whole time... Unless Sawa-kun wants to hug the hell out of him because of his MNF-ness...

Well... What other ""happy"" things should I put in? I'm going on a field trip to Brooklyn and I'm going to get mugged tomorrow? Oh no. That's not happy at all. But what do you expect? I can't do ""happy."" It's part of who I am. I might be able to smile and laugh but it doesn't mean that I'm happy now does it? Meh. Just not in the mood for typing much today. But hell.

"event","Well, I hope you enjoyed my crappy first person POV. I was feeling kind of emo earlier. But all the emo-ness is gone now.
I just got back from a surprise birthday party that I helped plan for one of my best friends. It was so tiring too! Giving all those people rides, hiding in a restaurant, and comforting the birthday girl since she started crying out of happiness to see everyone. Unfortunately, Kichi couldn't come.... My dad wouldn't allow him to get out of the house for a party at Houlihans. Yes. I know. I spelled it wrong earlier. I felt so bad for him though... He's always sitting alone in my room nowadays... So I thought I'd bring him some company instead! 
My friend's mom dropped me off at my house and I offered to show my friend Kichi since she wanted to see this ""$700 doll that I spent most of my money on."" Little did I know... That when my friend's mom saw him.... She was the first one out of the whole family to guess that he was a guy. O_O; Big surprise! I also didn't know that she collected dolls too. Yet the most expensive one that she's bought was only for $150. 
Kichi got lots and lots of love from my friends and their families. Even if Kent still believed that Kichi was a girl... But... When will he ever learn about Kichi's true gender even after I proved that he was a guy? I guess that is something that god can't even answer. 
'Oh no! Schizophrenic 14 year old spelled god's name with a lowercase g!' 
Just for a fact... I have figured out that I'm not a schizo. I just have a split personality that takes over at times. And I cannot say whether or not I believe in this 'god' so I guess I'm agnostic. At certain times, I believe there is a 'god' when a 'miracle' happens but that only comes once in a blue moon. And whatever those other people tell you... I'm not Satan's daughter. I'm just another ""troubled"" child. Hmm... Does the world ever run out of them these days? Yet again... Another question that god can't answer. 
Well... Over all... This day was pretty okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just a normal day with people and elephants... Yet I must say... I really hate my English teacher now since she isn't counting the test grade that could bring my average up to a B and she hasn't even mentioned anything about the extra credit. Yet I have also received good news. My old math teacher... The religious fanatic one that is bent on changing everyone into religious math loving fanatics like her? Yeah... A couple kids from my old school told me that there's a chance that she's retiring this year! ^_^; That means no more crazy lady chasing me around to talk about math with! Yay! 

justiceextinct and clockworkruki, I hope your grandmother gets better. Feel better soon!"

"event","So my oldest sister came back from Kuwait this week. She had been there for a month, she wanted to see if see could live there on her own. I was glad that she came back, but it wasn't long before I remembered why I was glad she left. She is the most self absorbed person in the world. Everything she says pisses me off. Last night she came at me after I had made some smart ass comment like I usually do, and I hit her. Oh wait guess who got in trouble....ME. But I didn't really care because I won. Well there you go another chapter in my crazy life."

"event","So it's been a very long time since I've had time to sit down and reflect on my day, not that I have time right now, but whatever. So today Jia wasn't at school and that kind of sucked. She gets me through a lot of the day. Instead I sat and looked at prom crap with the sherif. It was pretty fun(lie). So it's been SSDD for a while know (just incase you don't know what that means Same Shit Different Day). Everyday I want to hurt Mrs.Zimm very badly and everyday I put on the same smile and hide myself behind jokes. Whoa! Depressing moment this way <------. Sorry getting a little to deep, but hey sometimes I like to talk about feelings. OK?!


Hey and what is up with boys not liking me?"

"event","So I just got back from Omar's house. I had a lot of fun with his cats, they were nice this time. Today was a good day. Swong gave me an cool stuffed animal for Christmas and Mr nelson said I was born on Gods b-day. Sam said Christmas is Jesus' B-day. Mr Nelson said well isn't Jesus God. It was pretty cool. But some assholes were mean to me today. OH wait for no reason, yeah thats right. It was pretty cool. It made me feel good. I can't wait for Christmas."

"event","I had the most amazing time at french club. We stayed after school to cook french food and I ended up having a great conversation with the french foriegn exchange student. She has to be the most interesting person I have ever met(well she may be a close second to Jia). I don't know why, but hanging out with her just put me in the greatest mood ever."

"event","A girl&nbsp;I know works at a PetSmart and says four cats were abandoned there. Their local shelter took the two males, but they could not take the females and both will have to be put down unless someone can adopt or foster them.

Please, if you know ANYONE&nbsp;who can foster or adopt, let me know! We're trying really hard to make sure these girls find someplace nice to stay. Its not their fault that they were abandoned, both the females are super sweet.

Thanks if you can help, it would mean alot to me.

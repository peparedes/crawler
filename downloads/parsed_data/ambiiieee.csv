But i guess she knows whats she wants out of life and what ever comes her way, but she likes what she sees and thats what she likes to say, Then you never realize the screamin, whats it all for, no ones listening anyway, and i doesnt make sense anymore,  there is love in this world that makes it turn, but maybe sometime you'll see, this very world will burn. like i said before, you're a hippy in your heart so go out there, turn the world around and ill show you where to start.

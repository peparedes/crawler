I took my Dad and Steve to see George Carlin Sunday.  It was one of the best shows I've seen, he is so damn funny.  I wouldn't recommend going with you father or future relatives unless they're really cool (like Steve and my Pops).  Lets just say Pussy Farts and Vagina donors aren't usually in the pre-approved topics for parent/child.



I started waitressing at Sycamore today and have mixed feelings about it.  The money is needed badly amd its cool seeing everyone again but that is where the majority of my summer will be spent and thats depressing."

"event","Mel and I drove home last Friday to surprise some party goers.  We fully expected to drive back for State's last bball game but three cases later and that didnt happen.  However, because we were so smart we had to make the trip back to East Lansing anyways because all of our stuff was still there.  We had some left over free pizza, i took a needed nap and then it was back home (the Chicago soundtrack is great for road trips).


I had a few appointments to take care of while I was home.  First was a hair cut and dye but that was canceled.  Then a Dentist app. after which she told me I needed a root canal.  You can imagine my excitement when I woke up at 7:30 Tuesday morning and spent 2 hours at the oral surgeons.  From there I went to Beaumont and spent another two hours there.  THe only thing that saved the day was I went out with Angela, Brandon and Jeff for dinner and some pool.  The best part of the night was definitely when Jeff's parents, who I've never met before, had me talk to his brother on the phone who lives in Nebraska.  He also went to State and his parents offered to fly me to see him because they thought I was cute.  Too funny.


Now I'm sitting for the kids and later it dinner with Ang for gossip and then JcPenny's sale.


Thursday UPDATE:
Angela has the flu so dinner was posponed.  Instead my mom and I went shopping and then met Connie and Sandy at Hamlin's Pub.  After a few rounds with my mom(not) I went to Robs to visit Craig.  His directions, however, sent me into a creepy driveway with a giant fisherman.  I was so distracted on the phone with Craig that I ran into a yellow chain that streched across the entrance.  In my confusion I assumed it was rope and kept going as it pased over my car and across my trunk.  Apparently chains like that are supposed to keep cars out, I instead ran right through it.  Don't worry I only found one small chip in the paint.  No I am not blonde, though sometimes I wonder if there was a mistake.

Thursday morning I went back to the dentist to have my root canal filled and then they decided to clean my teath while I was there.  Then I got my hair cut and ran into Target.


Hopefully having some more friend time tonight, after the OC of course.  Visiting teachers tomorrow for anyone who wants to join!"

"event","So its been a fabulous weekend.  Thursday Kyle came up and suprised me.  We had a party thursday night in our dorm with my cousin Dan, Kyle, Craig, Derek and a bunch of others whos names i never knew.  Friday was the same, the 3rd floor RA yelled at us and I tried my fake ID....IT WORKS!!!!!!!!! Thanks Lynn  i'm so excited. Saturday night i used my ID again and the guys who own the store love me.  Then Tina, Erin, Mel and I had a few drinks.  After that I decided that tonight was the night because it would lame to try it on Monday. I kissed with 19 guys, one for each year and Tina but she was just a bonus i guess.  Not bad for my 19th Birthday.  At least i met my quota...Pictures in the morning for you....LOVES IT!!!!!!!!!


Trust me, you would be proud

Meri was in Dakota's musical Brigadoon a few weeks ago and she did such a great job.  I'm so glad she found something that she really loves to do.  Kyle played a role that fit him perfectly.  He was a drunken New Yorker who made everyone laugh.  The play was great and it felt good to be home for a bit.

Danny picked me up Thanksgiving weekend on his way home from Western and we stopped at Tanger Outlet to do some Christmas shopping.  My mommy went to Indiana for the Weekend so Wednesday I cooked Thanksgiving dinner.  Meri and I worked 8 hours Thursday and I made some amazing cash.   

That cash, however, did not stay with me for very long.  I woke up at 4:30 on Friday and Connie, Steve, Sonia and I were at Sears by 5:45.  We shopped from 6-10:30 and spent an obscene amount of money.  We went home and realized after all that shopping we now had returns to do.  So we were back at Lakeside by 3 and didnt get home again until 8.  I have know idea what got into me because usually I am not a fan of shopping.  However, it was quite an experience and I believe I've filled my shopping quota for the year.  

The sunday before I came back to school I had the privilege of spending time with Craig.  We had lunch and then I went to his brother-in-laws where out of the 9 people there I was the only female.  Is it surprising that didn't bother me?!  Anyways after an interesting night of 7&7s, porn and Phil's brother hitting on me it was time for me to go home.  Craig and i decided to follow Nick's drunk ass home but the cold weather somehow got in the way.  The next thing i know I'm pulling onto Craig's street where there is a Smashed truck and an angry Mom.  Not pretty.  

SO now I'm back ""on the banks of the Red Cedar"" where finals are looming.  Thusrday night was spent in Harla and Danielle's room celebrating Danielle's Bday with many others.  I still cant believe they have a coffee shop open until 11.  Friday night Sarah, Danielle, Jason, Brad, Fish and I went to the MSU vs. bowling green Hockey game which was cool except we didn't win.  In other news, MSU suspended my internet for 7 days because for all the gay hairy stud porn I have on my computer (: O  

Mel brought me some pictures from a few weekends ago when Kyle was here.  WOW  another three years of college and there will be enough embarassing pictures of me to last a lifetime. Ya for future reference my pants are under my pillow but at least you didn't have to see my tits!  O well at least I can remeber going out the next morning unlike a certain roommate I know!  Crazy but good times indeed.

Meri, Mom and I leave for FLorida in 17 days and I can't wait to see Mickey again! I might be in Canada for New Years Eve (hopefully spooning with all the other hot people planning on going) but that is tentative.  

Perhaps I'll update again when I get the internet back...but probably not."

After the musical we witnessed the Miracle Workers last game and let me tell you my Wednesday nights will be empty and sad now that I can't cheer on the best broomball team there ever was.  Anyways afterwards we took a trip to Denny's where we got the worst service but at least it was real food.  

Connie and Tyler came to visit last friday and we went out to eat and did a little shopping.  He is getting so big and it breaks my heart that I don't get to see him all the time.  We celebrated his first birthday on October 30th during the Michigan Vs. MSU game....we won't go there.

Last Sunday Sara and I helped society and gave blood. That night was pickup for our basketball tickets.  Sara didn't keep hers but i found new game friends.  Wednesday was the first game against GVSU.  I sat with Tina and Taylor from down the hall.  We won but it should have been by alot more.  It's crazy to see all the students in there IZZONE shirts cheering.  I hope we have a good season!

Yesterday's football game was crazy, definately the best of the season.  I can't believe we blew it against Mighigan and Ohio and then Kill the number 5 team in the nation.  Damn it was a good game though.


Alot coming up:Meri's in Dakota's play next weekend, Harla's birthday, Thanksgiving after that, finals and the Christmas

I'll be home the next two weekends!!"

This will definitely be the best weekend yet.

I went to a self defense class today with sarah and danielle.  It was really informative.  We learned some moves so that all the rapists here will walk away with a shattered nose, skinned shins and gouged out eyes.  Its pretty sweet!

where to begin.

Wednesday - Mel and Sara got peircings

Thursday -  After trying 3 times, i gave blood and was proud.

Friday - After classes we walked back to Liquid Tatto, where I got my tunge peirced!  Now the fun begins!

       -  Maija came up so Sara and i decided to crash at mel's.  Then we found out that Mike, Craig, Eric, Phil, and Cutie were here.  Anyways, the night wasn't that great for a few reasons but idk cuz i'll be cool anywhere. so we hit the sheets early.

Saturday - I got everyone up at nine so we could get the day started.  We said good bye to Maija, then Mel, Sara and I proceeded to the tailgate.  OMG it was nuts.  People here love to party.  My cusin Lynn was here from Central so I hung out with her for a while and she is so fun.  After walking around for a bit, we met up with Sarah, Danielle, Ashley and Kristen (lovely ladies!).  The game was sweet.  It was only hot for the last hour and of course Spartans dominated!  The school spirit here is amazing.  Found out Kyle Cook is #74 on offense, which is cool cuz i would always see him in the trainers room when i was a baby Freshman (like i am now).

Hopefully tonight will be fun!!"

Sat night Julie and Mike came up and we walked around for a bit then randomly met up with Gina, and some other former LCN kids at a party.  That got broken up so from there we then went to Kevin's frat and saw Eddie who we met the previous night and is cool.  There was no juice there and it was warm as hell so we went to Matt's apartment next.  He's another one of sara and mels friends but hes really nice.  Julie picked us up at 7am that morning and drove our butts home, where i slept until 2 (Sunday was a recovery day).



I'm excited for things to start. I signed up to donate blood next week.  I also might do the snowboarding club, and the Med Tech club (since its my major).  hopefully the rest of the year will go as well as this first week has gone.  hope everyone else is having as much fun as I am.

Today was visiting day for us.  In the morning we had breakfast with Mel and saw her room.  then it was off to Sarah and Danielle's, Laura and Steph's and Kelly and Sarah's.

Well I know that sometimes when they do that its because I'm young and they assume I won't spend money or alot of it.   I walked into Value City today and baught a lamp, a throw and 2 pillows with out ever being helped.  I carried the box and stuff around the store myself as I looked for a second lamp.  Finally after it was obvious I was on my own, I went to pay.  Its not like they were busy because when I was leaving these two salesmen standing there chatting with eachother were like ""thanks hun"" ""make sure you visit us again.""  So as I walked away I said ""Yea cause you were so helpful this time.""  Geez that makes me angry!"

I've had many conversations with Connie about wedding plans.  We've visited several halls and discussed menu's.  We've browsed dresses and dreamed of flowers.  Its going to be another insane year but I think it will be fun to be a brides maid!

Danielle's bonfire was good.  I talk to Mike about his european adventure and then kyle arrived and the subject changed to how much you'd you do someone of the same sex for.  surprisingly not that much.  o yes and sheep vagina was part of that talk as well...wtf?  When everyone left Danielle's we didn't feel like ending the night so Kyle, Chris and Mike came over for a little bit.

Friday i went to a surprise party for Angela (not that i was invited, long story) and kosko cakes are the best.  The next morning Ang and I went out to brunch then we took a trip to the secretary of state where she registered to vote then we got my absentee ballot so i can vote at school!!!

last night was good bye to Central goers and now its off to pack up my life!

Then we went and watched the best display of bowling I've ever seen by Josh Dutt.  And people like Chris, John, Cliffy, Don and Nick were there too but the best part was how Josh was there. Actually watching others bowl was surprisingly more fun than you'd expect.  Laura and I talk about how awesome its going to be next year and about how we need to party together more.  When bowling was over Kyle and I went home and watched the end of a movie with Meri and Taylor.  Too bad i didn't get to spend time with Sarah since she's the person i went out to see. Oops.

We made up for it though because work was hilarious today and we're having a Sycamore sleepover Saturday night which is going to be crazy.  15 girls and then Ricky.  can't wait!

"event","I saw Kill Bill last night with Sarah H. Sara C. Craig and Cutie (Dereck) which is a pretty cool movie so now i have to go see the other one at the cheap show yes!  Angela's grad party was at bath city on saturday and after that Sara and I went to Mel and  Ashley's parties.  SO to sum up the night sara lost my keys, others lost their clothes, there was no sex to be had by anyone, i killed my toe and eventually made it to work the next morning thanks to Harla (I HEART U).  The buddy system is going to have to be in full effect once we're at State or we'll never make it through freshman year.  


On a sweet ass note: I'm going to the Tiger vs. Yankees game Thursday!!!  Its gonna be soooo good, I can't wait!!




Have a splendor-ific day."

"event","So i haven't written in forever and decided to copy off of Jill and use my time here in the MSU computer lab to update!  Yes i'm at orientation and the only crappy thing is picking out classes....now do i take fly-fishing or fencing?  My grad party was a few weeks ago and was fine no major ordeals like the last gathering.  I recently enjoyed a homemade shocker-cicle with some sexy men (mine was more of a fuck you-cicle but thats no matter).  But the most exciting event recently had to be the Heavy Weights party.  it was crazy but thats why it was soo good.  Now i'm off to watch Office Space with some lovely gals.

"event","No school today so i thought i'd take this opportunity to let you know whats going on in my life because i know how much you care.

Prom was AMAZING definitely the best dance of my high school career and one of the most fun nights of my life.  Kyle was great the whole night (don't worry my toe has fully recovered).  The dance was fun as you can tell by my lovely picture on the announcements.  The after party at Jeff's was interesting...Sarah's first drunken practice for State, circle of death, shots, DJ in Jeff's mom's bathroom, me playing mom and Dotson took advantage of me.  Couldn't have asked for anything more from prom night.

Softball...lets not talk about it

Haven't worked in forever and missing some of my work buddies and the cash flow i'm used to.

Took my AP tests, Lit and U.S. gov weren't so bad but comparative gov kicked my ass!

Cedar Point Thursday (yes i'll be one of those dorks walking around with my calculator but i'm still going!!!!!!!!)

Graduation on June 8th

My Fiesta on June 13th

Orientation on June 24-25

"event","Just had the most wonderful weekend of my life (minus the 12 hour bus ride there and back).  

Bus Ride There - uncomfortable and sucky
Radio City Music Hall - Beautiful
Planet Hollywood - ""Individuality""
Giant Toys ""R"" Us - I don't want to grow up pictures with the girls
Fame - A great performance
Times Square @ night - Spectacular

Ground Zero - sobering
St. Paul's Cathedral - emotional
China Town - Craziness that included drug busts, cops, watches, purses, ""bling bling"" and Sara's mad bargaining skills
Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island - Breath taking
The Lion King - AMAZING!

But on the bright side, i haven't seen a cop in a week and that is a relief after my encounters on break.  ""We're in Kansas already?!"" ""Wait i'm confused""

Just won the first two games of the season.  A few hits, plays, a belly slide and OMG did it feel great to be back out there.  Home against Chippewa tomorrow @ 4.

Why you might ask, well i have been too stuborn for last 2 weeks to give my mom what she wants...which is an apology she doesn't deserve. On the one hand if i forgo my pride and give in to her i get my stuff back but then she thinks she has triumphed. I hate that feeling of surrender. But on the other hand, holding out and staying angry only make things worse and cause me to lose more ""privledges."" <STRONG>DAMNIT</STRONG> Looks like i'll be playing the role of the bitch again tonight and ask for forgiveness, sweeeeet. </FONT></P>

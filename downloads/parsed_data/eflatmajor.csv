"event","this easter i made it my mission to Plant Things, since my sister had taken over every part of the house except the garden. so now, i have many wee seedlings! there are some flowery things - lupins, hollyhocks and some other latin things i can't spell, and also some veg - tomatoes (i know, not strictly veg), radishes, and ROMANESCOOOOO (am v. excited).

also i have some carrot seeds to plant, and we've sown some runner beans in one of the big pots in the garden wot are just beginning to poke their heads through. YAYE. plus, maman accidentally planted a potato in a pot some time ago, and now it's growing crazy leaves everywhere.

there is so much more i want to grow, but this'll have to do for the time being. the soil in our garden is pretty clay-ish and the poor seedlings wouldn't do so well in there. also, my dad's penchant for randomly planting mini-trees in the back garden, which subsequently grow into MONSTER ALL-ENVELOPING REDWOODS, means that they scab all the moisture off any nearby plants. so we are going to have many makeshift vegetable beds, mostly out of big tubs like the old cool box and the old recycling bin. heee.

in the meantime, the mouses have been keeping the lawn short (read: bald) for us. and there are THREE blackbirds fighting over one brownbird in the lilac tree in the neighbour's garden. quality viewing. :)"

"event","the times review of our opera is KILLING me:

http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article6010089.ece

Alessandro at the Royal College of Music, SW7 - Richard Morrison ****

<i>They don't hang around at the Royal College of Music. Before Handel's romping overture is half done Alexander the Great plonks a whopping kiss on the lips of his handsome Macedonian captain, Clito. And the audience hardly has time to gasp before the Battle of Ossidraca is staged as a strobe-lit rugby match, with Christopher Lowrey's Adonis-like Alexander diving for the winning try. 

As you might have guessed, William Relton's production doesn't have much to do with Ancient Greece, or Handel's London. It's relocated to the 1920s Oxford of Brideshead Revisited, replete with croquet lawn, white-tie balls, backcloth of dreaming spires (Cordelia Chisholm's designs), chorus of hearty rugger-buggers and lots of ex-public schoolboys getting drunk and desperately trying to convince themselves that they are interested in girls rather than each other. 

Alexander's choice, when he's not fondling Clito (the characterful bass James Oldfield), is between the sweet Roxana (Susanna Hurrell, matching light-touch coloratura with nimble dancing) and the scheming Lisaura (Sarah-Jane Brandon, formidable figure, ear-catchingly lustrous tone). After Lowrey has displayed the flexibility of his plangent counter-tenor he plumps for Roxana. 

By then, however, the production has taken a startling turn. Alexander has become a crazed black-shirted dictator who, after demolishing a flowerbed with his fencing foil, finishes off his rugby opponents with a pistol. A directorial conceit too far? Perhaps, but also a reminder that the real Alexander had his megalomaniac moments - and also that the Roaring Twenties did slither swiftly into the Fascistic Thirties. 

What's undeniable is that this annual collaboration between the London Handel Festival and the RCM - and between the period-instrument pros of the London Handel Orchestra and the student voices onstage, under Laurence Cummings's pungent musical direction - has again produced a riveting show. True, there isn't the vocal virtuosity that Handel might have expected from the stellar cast he assembled in London in 1726. But in the little Britten Theatre the vitality of his vintage arias comes across crystal clear.</i>

hahahahah. i'm loving that he actually -got- the direction. also, i wasn't aware that my male chorus persona was in gay denial, but hey. whatever floats your boat. :D"

have spent the evening trying to keep two randy guinea pigs from humping each other. see, neither is particularly fond of being the humpee, so it always ends up in a fight. luckily this only happens for a day or two every now and then... piss. i was told that two girls wouldn't fight. :p

opera scenes are on on thursday evening. yaye no more wingrave! but BOO no more regularly scheduled rehearsals with hott baritone. on the upside, this means a)opera coachings now free for ridiculous new operatic rep, and b) less baritone angst. unless, that is, we make excuses to see each other anyway... which is highly likely. FAIL. :)

(n.b. there has been further drama in that department this week, but am too knackered to go into it now. may elaborate tomorrow. bleh.)

in other news, i really want to go see les arts florissants at the barbican on the 4th march, but all the cheap seats have already gone. which also means no-one else will want to come with. lame. i may end up forking out 20quid to sit behind a pillar by myself, we shall see."

FAIL of the day (so far): i just ate a whole pack of strawberry cables, only to then discover that they had wheat in them. arse. now, to play the waiting game... somewhere in the vicinity of a toilet, preferably. sigh.

FAIL of the week (obviously not counting fails involving hott baritone): i got a british youth opera callback. but how is this fail? i hear you cry. well, my pretties, if i get offered a role with them i will have a nasty dilemma between doing that all easter and all summer, or doing the college opera chorus at easter and les azuriales in nice in the summer. either way, i will be pissing someone off. perhaps i should sabotage my callback by drinking lots of red wine and eating lots of very salted crisps the night before. no-one wants a husky cherubino, even if they are interpreting him as gay.

positive things i have thought of whilst writing this:

- wheat-free oreo rip-offs!
- making valentines!
- finishing knitting projects!
- getting to learn wolf's <i>begegnung</i> for lieder comp!
- listening to magali and the corsican cafe bar guy talk in rapid southern french!
- 30 rock! (particularly the rural juror)
- ben nelson!
- ben fogle!
- obama!"

"event","did i mention that on sunday i went to john lewis in london and whilst agonizing over yarn substitutions i ended up being advisor to every fecking customer in the haberdashery? i actually successfully taught a girl the long tail cast-on. and had an argument with some old biddy over why the long tail cast-on is better than the shitty thumb cast-on. and then some girl came up and asked me how i would stop stockinette stitch curling up. RANDOM.

today, instead of staying at college and finding some clara schumann to sing, i instead went to starbucks with magali and we drank decaf coffee and she asked me all the english names of all the musical symbols and terms we could think of. it was slightly scary, because it was like being 11 and doing theory grades all over again. aaaagh.

now, i am totally screwed for tomorrow, since i have found no new rep for 2 weeks. whups. :D

it is my birthday on thursday! i will be OLD. (don't hit me.) methinks maman might be getting me shiny things off my amazon wishlist. that is, of course, if i sent her the link right. does anyone know how i can grab the link to my wishlist? i suppose i could send an email notification to myself, but there must be an easier way. hrm.

daddy suggested today that he would take me to london sometime to buy me a birthday present. i counter-suggested that he take me to a pet shop instead and get me 2 guinea pigs. :D incidentally, he agreed that he would as long as maman was ok with it. unfortunately there is a vital flaw in this plan, which is that maman will NEVER be ok with it, unless i just go out and buy them first and bring them home. once they're in the house no-one has the heart to take them back to the shop because they are TOO AWESOME. this is a tried-and -tested formula. srsly. it's worked twice. :D"

LET ME SING THEMS OKTHX' probably wouldn't have sufficed. managed to concoct a load of bullshit about being fascinated by french post-impressionism in the arts/mahler's brooding and ominous orchestral colours. yeah. absolute shite. :D

college is HARD. everyone is fucking amazing. that's all i have to say about that for the time being.

maman decided this week that it would be a really good idea to put my <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/eflatmajor/2334791363/in/set-72157600658336476/"">stripey hand-knit baby merino mitts</a> (that weren't even dirty, since i've not even worn them yet) into the washing machine. result: epic feltage. they're now half the size and i can't put them on. >:O BUT, at the same time, she actually *handwashed* a largely acrylic cardi that i bought very recently (i.e. could replace) that happened to be THE SAME COLOUR. unsurprisingly, she is now forbidden to wash anything i've hand-knitted. i mean. aaagh. i am getting past this purely on the fact that i am not having to pay rent this year. :P

AAAARRRGH. i have nothing to do until 3pm, when i have a half-hour coaching, and then i can go home. ah well, i suppose i can do something productive like <strike>going to john lewis and buying up their entire stock of rowan wool cotton</strike> finding some nice rep in the library.

am rather excited about doing ravel's <i>sheherazade</i>, since it is lush and sexy and the third song is clearly about liam:

<i>Your eyes are soft, like those of a girl,
Young stranger,
And the fine curve
Of your handsome face with shadowed down
Is more seductive still.
Your lip sings, on the step of my door,
A tongue unknown and charming
Like dissonant music.
Enter! And let my wine comfort you...
But no, you pass by
And from my door I watch you depart,
Making a last graceful gesture to me,
Your hip lightly bent
In your feminine and weary gait...</i>

AHHAHAHAHAH OMG it kills me. (sometimes, the jokes are not for you. :D)

this afternoon while we were in town maman dragged me into debenhams and made me try on jeans. this did not improve my mood, since it is a scientific FACT that no jeans fit me, ever. i am proportionally odd for my height and weight, in that i have a big waist and smallish thighs. unfortunately, all jeans in the uk seem to be a 28/34, whereas i am closer to a 32/30. curses!

on sunday i also managed to have evil tummy bug of doom, featuring hardcore cramps! and crashing all night on the sofa because of its proximity to the loo! was not fun. stupid useless immune system.

yesterday evening was weird. there was a blackout down out street from about 7pm till 9pm, during which time we ended up getting fish and chips for dinner because we couldn't cook. obviously couldn't have the fish because it's battered, but i did have 2 monster pickles all to myself. mmmm, acidic veg whilst recovering from a stomach bug! well, tummy did not seem to mind. it was tasty in any case. :)

1. <lj-cut text=""partay!"">on attempting to wash all the kitchen cupboards in the flat and realising that it was going to take me more time than i actually had, i called in the cavalry - jenny and richy - for a cleaning partay. they came over and donned rubber gloves and scrubbed my kitchen, for which i shall be eternally grateful. richard also drank a whole litre of vodka by himself and got pesto on the walls (which sort of defied the point of having a cleaning party). good times. :D</lj-cut>

2. <lj-cut text=""spanner in the works"">was about to leave the flat to see andrew on saturday when my dad called and told me he was arriving a day early, i.e. in three hours. cue ridiculous panic, since had made plans to be with andrew overnight. this was resolved in clever handover plan in which i dropped my spare keys and a glasgow map off at jenny's on the way to andrew's, so that my dad could meet up with jenny when he arrived and get them off her. apart from a couple of hitches on the way (my dad not being able to find st george's cross right in the centre of town; my dad also not being able to work out which flat door was mine despite the copiously detailed instructions i left him) all went to plan - i got to see andrew and dad got to sleep in my bed for the night. score.</lj-cut>

3. <lj-cut text=""dumpage angst"">so on saturday me and andrew went to the balloch sea life centre at loch lomond where me and jenny went a couple months back. it was awesomez. they have excellent bogey fish and monstersharks who like biting things. then we went and had late lunch and hot chocolate, followed by a stroll by the banks of the loch before going back to partick for the night. 

weirdly enough andrew seemed to shut off emotionally, particularly in the morning, and his parting words at the bus stop went something along the lines of, 'well... it's been fun. see ya.' o.0 9 months and that's all i get?? spent the next 36 hours feeling, er, somewhat used. :( but then, i talked to richy (who's known him way longer than i have) and he pointed out that andrew is an emotionally guarded person anyway and the fact that he clammed up was most likely a defence mechanism, and i shouldn't be worried that he doesn't care because the fact that there was a change in his demeanour at all says that he does. must think CBT: where's the evidence that he doesn't care? :)</lj-cut>

4. <lj-cut text=""moving day"">sunday was a bit mad, what with me and my dad packing up the rest of my stuff and loading it into a van that was clearly far too small to contain all of it. monday morning came with extra added flailing - more packing, more cleaning, more ranting from dad (NOT helping the situation), an emergency trip to B&Q to find elastic things to lash stuff to the roof, and all before 9am. oh, and then the estate agent guy arrived EARLY and i hadn't even finished cleaning yet or checked the inventory myself. at which point my dad just fucked off and had a fag in the van instead of helping me. i was so stressed out i was almost crying. by the time i'd handed the keys over and gotten into the van i just couldn't speak. (which for me, is rare. :D)

we stopped at M&S so i could get some food for the journey, then embarked upon the epic 7-hour drive back to slough in ridiculous wind and rain that threatened to spill all my belongings off the roof and all over the motorway. somehow this was narrowly avoided. :) the ride absolutely killed my back because i was sat in an awkwardly-shaped van seat and surrounded by boxes and bags of miscellaneous belongings. and when we got home, we had to unload everything and arrange it all in various piles in the shed or in my room. ouch. today my back has been absolutely killing me, as well as my wrists and my stomach muscles and, well, everything. boo. at least i've got some time off to recover. :D</lj-cut>

so am back in the ghetto now, with no-one to play with. tell me exciting things!"

aaaaargh there is so much to do and so little time. and my brain is not functioning properly due to a lack of sleep (he he) and i can't seem to construct conherent sentences.

this week is going SO QUICKLY and am starting to panic. don't like it. need to do more packing. and halp, just remembered liam is apparently coming to stay tomorrow and i need to wash towels. aaaa.

"event","for fuck's sake. me and phil have had ridiculous bust-up and are now in fun non-apologetic stalemate. here is what happened: phil asked me to walk him to his bus stop in the middle of a torrential downpour because i had an umbrella. which i did, even though it was completely out of my way. but he then proceeded to hog the whole umbrella, shake it over my head and steer me into puddles. and when we got to the bus stop, it wasn't actually a bus stop, it was a pub. and then he laughed at me and went in, and didn't even say goodbye or thank you or give me a hug or even invite me in. and i had to meet liam and richy in town and i was all drenched all the way down my back and up to my knees and i was shivering. so about 10mins later i phoned him up and shouted at him for about 30 seconds about what a wanker he was, and now he's not speaking to me. oh, fuck off. i've called him worse before :P

in other miserable news, i have stage production for carmelites for the next 6 days and i am not looking forward to doing a 60-hour week with the director, who continues to be unimaginative and unresponsive to other people's ideas/questions/problems. particularly both choruses. she can't think on her feet and so much time is wasted while she works out what she wants to do with a problem. in addition, we're all going to be dressed in various woollen layers of nuns' habits and it's going to be ROASTING. wah.

good things:
- my living room smells of melon!
- my boobs continue to be larger than life!
- i have cheques to cash!
- i get to learn fun repertoire over the next few weeks!
- liam asked me to the ball on saturday and so we will be a HOTT POWER COUPLE! awesome :)
- i have a consultation lesson with janis kelly on july 2!
- andrew is back from america a week tuesday!
- obama!
- buttons!"

"event","bloody masterclass bloody shite yesterday. ok, well -i- sang well, but the guy was so dull and boring that warren actually called me up half an hour before i was due to go on to warn me. when i got in, the audience who hadn't been part of the mass exodus at the end of the last set were half-dead - two old guys were actually nodding off in their seats. the guy refused to acknowledge amy man who was playing for me, even though she was entirely awesome. he proceeded to patronise me throughout, telling me i was a dull performer and not letting me get a word in edgeways to defend my interpretation of the song text; he told me to do all sorts of things i've been learning for 4 years -not- to do, like singing non-legato and off the voice i.e. breathily. omg. i don't really think i took anything away from that half hour other than not to be a smug choral tenor. GRRR.

on the upside, my head of dept told both my teacher and myself that i had been his favourite (yay favouritism!) and that i had worked on a far more in-depth level than the other singers. hmm, dubious. also the audience were clearly with me throughout (mostly because i decided to play the bubbly undergrad card), and several students came up afterwards to tell me they had preferred the way i had sung the piece before he had tampered with it :)

today was also MARRED by getting told off by bitter admin staff for: swearing, using my phone in the computer suite, having a carton of apple juice in the computer suite, talking in the computer suite. despite the fact that these are not against the rules and that everyone else was doing this to a far more annoying extent than i was. oh and then liam went off in a strop because i wouldn't listen to his FUCKING RAVEL QUARTET for the fifth time over while i was trying to talk to jenny. and accused me of bullying, despite the fact that HE was the one slapping me repeatedly to get my attention while i was trying to thank jenny for buying me some chocolate. >:-O

- tasty andrew got back from 2 weeks climbing mountains in ethiopia yesterday. he called me up today to say hi. *glee* i think i may have made a tit of myself on the phone but hey, what's new? scaryphone is scary, particularly when you're besotted with the person on the other end.

- am craving wildly coloured sock yarn, like colinette jitterbug or similar. i also have Hard Cash from my badass singing exploits at the weekend (which damn well nearly killed me), and Free Time (mostly, however, being spent recovering from weekend). dangerous combination. also i have to go to london on thursday for an audition. there are too many yarn shops in london. send help.

- <i>dr who</i> fans: david tennant was guest hosting on <i>the friday night project</i> again last weekend. it was possibly the most awesomely homoerotic thing i have ever seen (with the exception of the legolas/aragorn eyesex in TTT). definitely worth hunting down on youtube or whatever download service you have. omg they were reading out dr who/captain jack slash!!

other things on the SUCK side:

- i have the most bunged-up cold ever and cannot taste chocolate, or anything else for that matter

- i have to sing tomorrow, and the day after - ALL DAY

- the royal college just told me i have to have Nasty Evil Financial Support Form sent in by MONDAY so they can have a month's processing time (real due date is 30th april). unfortunately, my form will NOT be sent in complete, because both my referees are out of the country and half my paperwork is up in glasgow. i could panic, but i just don't have the energy

in happy shiny news, we all went to this skank car boot sale on monday and maman bought me a TAMAGOTCHI OMG for 50p. bargainous. it is so shiny and awesome. right now he is four days old and has little arms and legs and chirps at me when he wants playing with. weeeeeee! i am so easily amused. \o/"

"event","trying to remember what i actually did this week so's i can actually post a coherent update... come to think of it tho, have done pretty much bugger all since saturday, when i managed to pull off a mozart requiem with barely any voice. scaryscary. since then i have half-learnt a mozart aria, avoided singing in performance class for about the seventh week running, and watched <i>the history boys</i> (which was rubbish, because no-one in the real world talks like that or cares about the plight of frustrated 17 year-old public school gayboys with too much money). check me out with unpopular opinion of the week. yaye!

me and jenny went to loch lomond on sunday to get the fuck out of town for once. admittedly the weather wasn't great but it's not all it's cracked up to be. awesome ducks tho. daddy the birdwatcher will be jealous, oh yes.

on weds i took a mental health day, i.e. skived off the whole day. slept, went to big tesco, had andrew over in the evening. we cooked indian food and played super mario world. then he belted it down the road to catch the last train home and i watched him from my window, it was possibly the most hilarious thing i've seen all week. people you know + frantic physical exertion = COMEDY.

when i am older and kirstin is a rich and famous opera star, i will be her PA and carry her cases around and wear a headset for liaising with her security team. or, failing that, i will be the fangirl in the front row at all her concerts who comes to stage door to get a wodge of programmes signed and then flogs them all on ebay. heee.

maman is coming to visit on tues! whee! she will be here for 6 days to lavish me with attention and tasty foodz. mmmm, spoilage."

today was the final of lieder comp which i somehow managed to get into out of 42 entrants. didn't win tho - incidentally, dickinson did, but it doesn't bug me as much as i thought it would. i think this is because i am aware that i am not the only person who will have been narked by this adjudication. :D ah well. i didn't expect to win, anyway. just glad it's over and i can concentrate on learning my pieces for my recital on tues. aaaaagh.

keep being ill. one week it's a chest infection, the next a tummy bug, the next something else. am such a sickly child. was sick at 5am on monday for absolutely no reason whatsoever, and my throat has been swollen and shit since then. useless. of all the fucking weeks to be ill. will be so glad when all this is over next tuesday, and can go back to singing debussy 24/7. heh :D

saw andrew tonight! he is shiny. we talk about things. he is nice yaye. :)

onegin performances started this week. i am utterly shattered, physically in particular - methinks it's going up and down the 6 flights of stairs from stage to dressing room that does it. also, the rake kills my calves. interestingly, the rake at turandot in the summer was steeper, and we were on it for a shorter but more intensive time, but it didn't make my legs ache like this one does. weirdness.

american politics is way more exciting and far less complicated than british politics. over here they never explain anything to you because you're expected to know what the fuck's going on. at least with foreign politics, if something weird comes up they explain in on the news. what's more, in scotland they have all this extra crap like MSPs and scottish executives. aaaa. someone marry me for my US green card pls.

"event","spent last night in the pub with my dad, who was the acoustic musical entertainment for the evening. he asked me to do a couple songs with him, after which he asked the (drunk, male, over-40) punters if they would like to hear his daughter sing something from <i>the sound of music</i>. *facepalm* so i did. but completely against my will, thank you. and i got 30 quid off the landlady afterwards, which was well worth making a tit out of myself for. so there.

had a lovely start to the new year when maman got mugged today in the eton college playing fields by three asian guys. luckily she didn't have any cash on her or any of her cards, just her phone and some other bits and pieces. they still pushed her to the ground and scared the life out of her, poor woman. what makes me angry is that she's probably the same age as their mums. no fucking respect, that is. i hope their mothers find out and give them a bollocking.

speaking of which, i tried to call my mum's phone (which they'd nicked) just to see if they'd pick it up and OMG THEY PICKED IT UP. at which point i passed it to my dad, who shouted death threats at them down the phone for 5mins until they decided to hang up. probably not the most sensible plan of action, especially since our address would have been in my mum's diary which they also had. but in any case it was comedy :D

other related hilariousness: the police were round to take a statement from maman and my sister came in wearing these ridiculously tight, bright red pyjama pants. the male copper was totally eyeing her up, so obviously that my dad actually noticed. hehehe awesome.

hope your new years are equally entertaining, though perhaps without the large slice of racial hatred :D"

it seems that my dad will be spending his fortnight off work in a state of perpetual drunkenness, which is going to be hella fun. i have spent the past two days generally trying to ignore his slurrings as they tend to be attention seeking and negative, and i'm just not in the mood. generally though he is in the pub for most of the day, so we don't have to deal with him except for a couple hours in the evening :D

first of 2 london auditions tomorrow; the second is on tuesday, but i have to come back up to glasgay in the meantime for rehearsals. suck. in the space of 5 days, at least 24 hours will be spent on trains. :P

<i>onegin</i> production has started, making my timetable an absolute nightmare and generally knackering me out as we spend 3-hour stints in a boiling hot studio getting frustrated with dance routines which are constantly being altered because the choreographer can't decide what the fuck she's doing. dehydrated to fuck.

last night i dreamt it was new year's eve and i pulled fraser the clarinet guy. and today, hott george will not seem to leave my line of vision. perhaps he is crushstalking me, and not the other way round. :D

i am itching to knit but it seems that whenever i try, it fails spectacularly. fucking legwarmers. fucking lace. fucking gauge. i need fucking chocolate."

saw tasty andrew again yesterday. is still hott. is also still rather shy and quiet. ah well. we went to the lighthouse and froze our nips off, then warmed up in starbucks. stupid glaswegian cold snap meant we were too cold to initiate ridiculous snog/gropefest in the middle of the street. boo, hiss. still, is nice to know at least one person on this planet wants to get into my knickers, even if he doesn't quite know how to express it verbally. :D

tomorrow am off to the farmers market with mousey liam to see if they has any romanescoooo. i miss fractal foods. yesterday we went to wetherspoons (awesome cheap pub chain), which seems to be the only place in town with wheat-free indications on their menus, and i had tasty prawn curry with poppadoms and chutney and a drink for only 6 quid. score. (it also came with naan bread but i gave that to liam. :D)

opera chorus beginning to come together musically, but the dancing remains atrocious and looks set to stay that way, since our choreographer insists on changing the steps each time we rehearse, confusing everyone and wasting precious rehearsal time. can't wait until the director arrives and the shit really hits the fan when he realises she's done absolutely fuck all in the past 2 months. whoops! :p

am sure i had more of interest to post here, but can't remember any of it. arrr."

"event","had a tiring day yesterday, what with having not one but two rsamd postgrad auditions (i got sent through to sing to the scholarship panel, which was nice) coupled with ridiculous hormones which kept me alternating between being randy as hell and maternal all day. :P voice completely useless today as a result, and generally had a short fuse... not really helping was the news that dickinson was offered a scholarship for the masters opera course on the spot, and that they told andyroo to his face that he would definitely be getting a bursary. for fuck's sake. no-one gives a shit about the high mezzos.

speaking of voice type angst, am sick of never being able to find any oratorio rep to sing. it's awkward because i'm too light for most mezzo stuff, but am not light enough for soprano stuff. arrrrr. the pissing legend margaret marshall is always on at me to sing in oratorio class but i have nothing. we WANTS to, preciouss.

tasty awesome things:
- went to the post office today and stood in the queue for freaking ages to collect a package i'd missed, and it was from <lj user=""art_geek""> and had PINK MOUSE WOOL in it wot went with my cardi and also a pack of all the sock needles i will ever need in my life, ever. there was much squeeing (and people asking me who had posted me an iron). :)
- tomorrow i have a HOTT DATE with tasty andrew. hope he snogs me again. :D"

tomorrow i have a hot date!! with richard's friend. we were texting and then he just asked me out. am excited because from what i remember in my slightly inebriated state, he was very pretty in a very young jian ghomeshi type way. mmmm. we are going for coffee. i shall tell you all the gossip afterwards.

tonight we sparkled some cheap-ass sparklers on the steps of the academy (they were tiny and each lasted about 10 seconds, hehe). then me and liam snuck into the cinema and went all the way up to the top level to see if we could see the fireworks from there... wasn't that impressive tho, so we left and went down to the river where we caught the end of the big display on the green. it was shiny. :)

liam is sad. he is ill and he misses home. i don't blame him in a way - it's very beautiful where he lives and all the people are beautiful too :D i can't cheer him up though and it makes me sad. wah.

"event","i was reading an article in observer woman magazine yesterday called 'what do women want?' and stumbled across this absolute gem of a paragraph which i totally HAD to share with you all:

<i>""With geeks and nerds, the dynamic is different again. The supremacy of all things technological has lent nerdishness a new, even vaguely modish fascination. Nevertheless, their appeal remains that of the female taking charge, removing the NHS specs and exclaiming: 'Why, Geek Boy, you're beautiful'. A nerdophile confesses: 'I know it's unpalatable, but I get a kick out of the power dynamic - the slavish gratitude, having him in my sway.'""</i>

two words: NAIL and HEAD. this is totally what i am all about. perhaps this is due to the fact that my dad is big and brawny and loud and i have absolutely no control over him at all, and so in a boyfriend i want the complete opposite - skinny, intelligent, quietly contemplating, badly-dressed and long-haired (dad is bald, hehe). oh, and of course, i want to be at the very least, his equal. heeee. boys are funny. :)"

on tuesday i effectively found out that my entire vocal support is a giant pile of bollocks, hence why i still have issues with my chestbone sinking slightly. which means complete revamp, whoo. i have spent most of the time since angsting about it and wondering why, after 3 years of conservatoire training, i still have not managed to achieve the simplest of things. :( and plus, it's a race against time to get it sorted for my recitals, because my head of dept told me at the end of last year that the only way i would get a first class degree would be if i sorted out my posture. and it's the support that's screwing it all up.

then yesterday i was incapacitated for most of the day with the most excruciating period pains, which had me writhing around on the floor in agony (literally). ibuprofen did not seem to work on this occasion. :P of course, though, at 4pm it stopped abruptly and i was able to drag myself into college for onegin rehearsal, which on this occasion was a hilarious mash-up of sectionals and DANCING. yay grand ballroom scenes. and apparently we are all going to get big dresses! omg!!1

i also got the weekly meaningless apology from andyroo, because of course he'll start treating me like shit again tomorrow. HAR.

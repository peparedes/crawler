Take 3 minutes and try this...it will
freak you out! The person who sent it to me
said her wish came true 10 minutes after they read
the mail. BUT NO CHEATING! This game has
a funny/spooky outcome.

Don't read ahead...just do it in order! It takes
about three minutes.

First..get a pen and paper.
When you actually choose names, make sure
it's
people you actually know and go with your first
instinct.
Scroll down one line at a time...and don't read
ahead or you'll ruin it!








1. First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a
column.





2. Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write down
anytwo numbers you want.







3. Beside the 3 and 7, write down the names
of members of the opposite sex.







NO LOOKING AHEAD...OR IT WON""T TURN
OUT RIGHT!






4. Write anyone's name (like friends or
family....) in the 4th, 5th, and 6th spots.








5. Write down four song titles in 8,9,10, and
11.







GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT PEOPLE!!!!







6. Finally, make a wish.








And now the key for the game.....




   
1. You must tell (the number in space 2) people
about this game.








2. The person in space 3 is the one that you
love.









3. The person in 7 is one you like but can't
work out.








4. You care most about the person you put in
4.








5. The person you name in number 5 is the
one
who knows you very well.








6. The person you name in 6 is your lucky star.







7. The song in 8 is the song that matches with
the person in number 3.







8. The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7







9. The tenth space is the song that tells you
most about YOUR mind.






10. and 11 is the song telling you how you feel
about life"

"event","nothing to do. just a cop-out. there's always something to do.. i'm just far to lazy to admit that fact and get up off my ass.

So the past week i have found myself consuming alot of beer and cigarettes.. good for the health? i'd say not. Anyone notice how things that momentarily make you feel better seem to be far worse for you than anything you can imagine? if someone could explain this irony to me.. it'd be greatly appreciated."

"event","I love how my dad yells at me everytime i take my cellphone anywhere.. he's convinced it belongs to him.. so we have to drive all the way back out to my house.. only to show him that he'd left his on the seat of his car.

Tonight, Brandon and i decided to follow some rich lady around in her mercedes to see how long it would take before she called the police... we clocked it at seven minutes.

 So tell me.. is anyone else going to feel like the biggest tool in the world having to accept their diplomas? I'm definetly not sticking around for that... the hats are gay. just plain gay.

i love writing in random paragraphs. that's all."

"event","well, i'm sad to say.. but the relationship wars have begun.. *rolls eyes* what a useless waste of energy.. but i find it intriguing how some people just can't let things go.. and need to KEEP pushing.

   I don't like being around my friends when they're drunk and i'm sober.. because that means i have to take care of them,lol. i realized this last night. :) chad was all loaded... and we boxed.. long story short.... chad now has a black eye and a fat lip.

   while i'm on the subject of chad, i might as well through in the fact that i feel really bad about him and britta breaking up.

   that's all.. bye. :)"

"event","Sheeesh, getting one of these nifty little journals is a barrel of hard work. Who would have thought that every name i decided to use.. someone else had already picked it? I'm pretty sure they're out to get me.
   ""come on josh, break the computer... you know you waaaaannnnnaaa"" 

   Anyways, props to tori who helped me through this whole traumatizing event, and for getting me one of the code-thingys. (she threatened to beat me if my journal wasn't updated often.. :S) But i'm gonna pack it in for now. I'm still mad about it taking me four hours to get an account. jesus."

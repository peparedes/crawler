"event","I don't know what to do anymore.  School will be over next week.  I'm better but still not even close to being alright.  I've changed in so many ways, changed so many of my thought patterns, but I'm right back to feeling like I did before I even started school.  I really needed to talk to someone today but my one friend was busy watching a movie with her father.  My other friend wasn't even home, then when I messaged her on AIM, she typed at me for maybe ten minutes and never even asked how I was or what was up with me.  Even though I always ask her.  She just left, saying that she'd been irritable today and needed relaxing.  Why is it that when I need to talk to someone no one is there? I always try to be there for my friends when they need me.  I must be doing something wrong somewhere.  I feel like such a horrible person still.  I just need to graduate, take my exams, and get the hell out of this state.  I am so very much in the wrong place.  Maybe if I was far away from here I could actually do something with myself. I wouldn't feel so damn stifled.  I hate it here.  I hate my job.  I hate how routine everything has become.  I hate how my friend is changing.  I'm glad that she's happy but she's not the same person anymore.  She's becoming all ushy-gushy sweet and sentimental.  So I think it's time to part ways again.  It's time to move.  It's time for change.  I'm done here.  I can't change anymore here.  I can't grow anymore.  I am not a happy camper and no one and nothing here can make me happy."

"event","I have discovered new power metal in the form of Master Plan.  This is a song off their new album, and it perfectly illustrates why I listen to this stuff so much.  You can't listen to it and NOT be utterly galvanized to face your life with a renewed sense of purpose and determination.  

<a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/?dfjnwtddzzd"">This is the song Wounds.</a>  It's a lot more optimistic and hopeful than it sounds.  If you like, I'll put up the album.  Also, when I am done perusing the new Dragonforce, be prepared to receive a screenful of blistering power metal that will be sure to rouse the warrior inside you no matter how hard you try to repress it!

"event","...that it's a good choice.  At least, that's what I think anyway.

Now, what this applies to actually, is myself.  I ended up talking to Kat today (who is now recovering from her surgery and is high as a fucking kite on painkillers, but still more intelligent than the majority of humanity) and apparently I am the eye of a shitstorm.

I didn't know that anything at all was going on, because of course no one is talking to me about what's going.  Because it's all about me to begin with.  Come to find out, Mel and Pat (the other two union stewards) as well as Sandy (who is the resident loudmouth and busybody) are royally pissed off that Kat ""left me in charge."" 

First off, morons, she didn't leave me in charge.  This is who with it the other two union stewards are: Kat is the Chief Steward.  Mel is her Second.  She asked me to stand in just in case there is a problem so that I can help out.  NOT THAT I AM IN CHARGE! =_=  They don't even know they're own damn chain of command.  Sandy, she's such a moron and a wannabe upstart, is trying to get a petition going to replace Kat.  The woman still hasn't gotten it through her head that NO ONE in the department is going to stand behind her.

Now, Mel actually went down to our Local and pitched a fit at Todd (who is our Union President) about Kat asking me to help out.  He was claiming that Kat only told him ""three or four days"" before she went out.  She told EVERYONE, Union Pres Todd included, at least a month beforehand.  Mel is also trying to make this a ""race issue.""  Kat is white, and I look white.  I'm actually Mexican, but I also have a lot of European blood, so I look really white.  Mel and Pat are both Black.  Sandy is Black by injection. (How anyone could have sex with that whale I'll never figure out, but that's just me being catty. Meow!>^_^<)  So how can this be a race issue?  We're an even male/female mix as well as white/black/mexican ratio.  

No one is happy about this, except for Kat.  Pat talked to her about it, but she explained to him why she picked me and he's cool with it now.  Todd has also approved me.  I'm just getting stonewalled now because Mel is a backstabbing two-faced bastard.  He wants the title of Chief Steward, but he doesn't want the responsibility.  As is usual for people. (they make me want to puke)  So the only reason he's pitching a bitch now is because I'm fresh territory and he thinks that I'm going to ""take his power"" away from him.  Dude! I'm the least experienced person involved in this! D:  I'm just hear to listen in and prevent arguments and undue violence from breaking out in the workplace.  I've got nothing!  I'm relying on these guys to help ME out, because they've got the experience.

They haven't even given me a copy of the contract yet to read over.  They are also trying to say that I'm a big gossip.  I don't talk to anybody at work, or hang out with anybody, or anything like that.  Sure I'm a bit piqued at this because dammit, I just want to help.  These people are fucking pathetic trying to start all this shit.

However, every one of my co-workers that I asked about this prior to accepting Kat's offer was very cool with the idea of me being the one to represent them in her stead.  How can I not find this absolutely hilarious when I, the least social person in the department, is now a huge gossip and power mongering tyrant.  And I haven't even gotten a chance to do anything yet!  I kind of feel like a famous politician at the moment because of this.  And I love it! xD  This has got to be one of the most hilarious things that's ever happened to me.

Scurry on my little minions!  Wear yourself out with your personal dramas!  I'll be taking care of business."

"event","I have to natter on about this series now that I've finished watching it.

<lj-cut text=""Yeah, this probably contains spoilers..."">
I have to say that this is one of the most intelligent anime I've seen in a <i>very</i> long time.  All of the Machiavellian mind fuckery! *__*  It was amazing!  It was such a tongue-in-cheek metaphor for our ""end times"", and its use of metaphor within itself was just magnificent.  Wheels within wheels.  L with his sweets, Near with his toys, Mello's chocolate.  I also really enjoyed how each character became isolated in his or her aura color when they were thinking really hard about something.  Aizawa being green, Matsuda yellow, L blue, Light as red.  Each color was so very fitting.

I have to say that Ryuuku, L, Aizawa, Matsuda, and Mogi were my favorite characters.  (That's how good this anime was.  Even the secondary and tertiary characters were brilliantly executed and full of personality.)  Everyone and everything in this series had a purpose and a function and the only ""error"" that I could pick out in all of it was when Light suddenly started calling ""N"" Near and Near answered without hesitation.  For all of the secrecy and cloak and dagger up to that point, it was just a glaring error.  Not that it made much difference to anything at all, it just didn't fit.

Yagami Light - Pride goeth before the fall homes, but I have to hand it to this guy, he really was one of the Big Boys and not just some stupid kid playing at power games.  He had an ideal and he stuck to it.  He was blindingly intelligent and underneath it all, he was a good kid.  However, absolute power corrupts absolutely.  That was so clearly illustrated when he first gave up the notebook during his confinement.  The change was startling and I don't blame L one bit for being as confused as he was.  He was also the first ""villain"" that I truly detested.  Why? Because he was just like every other megalomaniacal and delusional tyrant that tried to take over the world.  He took away the one true gift that any of us really have: free will.  You can't control people.  They will always fight it.  All you can do is educate them as much as possible and hope for the best. Light however, wanted to be god and wanted to be recognized as god.  He wanted people to conform to what his ideal of a ""perfect world"" was.  The world is the messy jigsaw that it is simply because it IS so full of people and no two have the same idea of anything.  He was completely delusional, arrogant...he was Lucifer rather than God.  So full of light and passion and heady idealism that he became blinded by it.  Everything he did, he did knowingly, and I laughed and laughed and laughed when his perfect little world started to crumble around him.  The sheer number of times he had to pass off the notebook to avoid getting caught should have been a glaring clue that maybe, just maybe, he was a little bit in the wrong.

Amane Misa - I'm getting her out of the way now because I fucking <i>hated</i> her.  All she was was a bad Harley Quinn knock off.  She was just too stupid, but her bubbleheadedness and pretty face made her the perfect beard for Light.

L - I don't think I've ever seen anyone so lonely in my life.  This guy was stupidly brilliant and adorable.  He was such a neurotic little mess!  All I wanted to do was give him a hug and feed him more sweets, and to watch him work.  He was damn genius, but as usual, those smarts put him so far out in left field that he just couldn't function normally with other people.  Also, he was like freaking Batman.  He had more money than god and a doting old ""butler"" who just happened to be an ex-soldier/sniper.  Their dynamic made me giggle so very much.  L knew he was right about Light and Misa the entire time, but that soft heart of his always made him doubt just a little bit.  I think he genuinely liked Light as he was an actual match for him.  Their mental fencing must have made him so giddy and fizzy inside.  And Misa.  She's a pretty girl.  He's a young guy.  He had <i>SUCH</i> a crush on her.  I felt so bad for him because she would never notice because he wasn't conventionally handsome(he totally had that quirky kind of cute that you either love or hate) as Light was.  (Not that Misa would have been any good for him but sometimes you just want a pretty person to smile at you and only you. >_>)  I was SO pissed off when he died.  I was about ready to call it quits with this show then and there.

Near and Mello - And that brings me to these two.  I was so very pleased when Near admitted that he wasn't as good as L, that the only way he could ever match or surpass L was because of Mello as well.  That was my initial impression and why I was left so dissatisfied with L's replacements.  However, they managed to do a decent job of it and get the rat bastard to confess himself.  I don't think I'll ever understand fandom's ruckus over Mello.  He was nothing special and certainly not attractive in the least.  Near was ""near""ly a carbon copy of L which only made me want to kick him.  In the end though, they both proved useful, but I was still left unhappy and unimpressed with them. (as it took BOTH of them to replace L.)

Ryuuku - OMFG!  This guy has to be the biggest troublemaker in the entire freaking universe!  Intelligent as hell and bored out of his mind; a very bad combination.  He was sweet, funny, energetic, and just ridiculously adorable.  He was in it all for the lulz, which I <i>totally</i> respect as people are hilarious.  He and L had the purest drives in this series.  Except for Rem, who was just too serious for her own good and who's good heart got the better of her for Misa's sake. (the wretched little bitch SO did not deserve that sacrifice!)  When I die, if I get to see a Shinigami, I really hope that it's like Ryuuku.  Then I could be sure that all of this wasn't in vain because at least SOMEONE was getting some entertainment out of it all.  Also, apple addiction. I totally identify!

Yagami Souichirou - This man has my complete and utter admiration, and also my compassion.  He was a truly good man.  He did everything he could to see justice done all the while playing by the book himself.  If he made any mistakes at all it was being blinded by his own hope.  Light did not deserve this man as a father and he deserved a much better son than Light.

Matsuda - He was just freaking adorable.  He was definitely the comic relief of the crew (except for Aizawa's unintentional hilarity).  He was cute as hell and utterly genuine in all of his actions.  I can't believe that I suspected him of treachery early on, but then everyone was a suspect at that point.

Aizawa - Dude, his wife and daughter are the luckiest women on the face of that animated planet.  He was such a stalwart badass but all of his motivation was from that soft gooey heart of his.  He was so funny every time he yelled at everyone to be more serious, but then he goes and cries when he gets his hair cut to disguise himself!  You don't get cuter than that!

Mogi - Always doubted himself so much, but he always passed with flying colors.  Especially, as serious and quiet as he is, he had to play super energetic and supportive as Misa's manager.  I think the playacting rubbed off on him a little bit because he was certainly more open after that.  Just watching him with that huge smile on his face, both hands in the air, and cheering her on at the top of his lungs was utterly precious.  Then he goes and sits on the couch all ""that was totally unbelievable.  I can't do this."" xD  I just wanted to squish him!

I think that's everybody. ^^;  I just really enjoyed this series.  Watching Light's rise and consequent fall was an experience.  And slash moment: When L was drying off Light's feet after they came in from the rain!  I so don't like the idea of an actual pairing between the two because Light is just an asshole, it's amazing on an intellectual level.  As superficially distasteful as it is, Light really is the only decent match for L.  They could compete with and match each other in everything, and they <i>enjoyed</i> it.  L deserves that at least, someone who can actually challenge him.  I loved the way they beat the shit out of each other too.  Their interaction just made me happy in a really stupid, fangirl kinda way. x3 (but it was all intellectual! I swear!! >_>)

"event","My friend <lj user=""chaoticthief""> showed me this video the other night because I am a huge fan of the show ""Ghost Hunters.""  Jay and Grant...these guys are supposed to be the cream of the crop in the paranormal investigation field.  They have such a unique approach to things: go in trying to DISPROVE a haunting, rather than prove that a place is haunted.  Jay was always saying ""...they don't perform on cue,"" in reference to ghosts/hauntings.  

They were so noble about it too.  If children were involved they bumped the case up to top priority and got right on it.  They constantly offered counsel and solace to frightened and confused people.  They made such massive inroads on obtaining actual credibility in the field to the point where skeptics couldn't just dismiss them as a bunch of quacks and weirdos.  They were simply too professional, too scientific about it all.

Then they go and do this.  I would really really like to <i>not</i> believe it, but the evidence is too damning.  Watching this really wounded me, and disappointed me in such a grave manner that I can't even really fathom it myself.  

Sure, this sounds really silly to be this distraught over a television show but if you'd had the experiences I've had, if you'd had as many people calling you crazy and staring at you like you're a lunatic as I have, you would understand where I was coming from.  It was like <i>FINALLY</i> someone was validating all the weird things that had happened in my life.  They were opening minds, ushering in the beginning of a new way of viewing life and death.  But no.  The world and its greedy, grasping hands wins again.  

Way to make credibility yours guys.  Congratulations on destroying all the work that you had heretofore accomplished.  I applaud you on your epic and monumental failure.

"event","Tomorrow The Kat is going on leave from work because she's going to have major surgery.  She's also our department's dayshift union steward.  Because she is going out, she needs someone to act as her alternate and represent the dayshift people if there are any problems.  

She said that she needed someone who was smart and that she trusted.  Someone who can keep their temper and play nice with the stupervisor.

She asked ME to do it.  ME!  I have absolutely no experience with this kind of thing and what makes it worse is that everyone I asked about it today at work was totally cool with the idea! D:  ME!

I think I want to do this. D:  But I don't want to fuck up and let everybody down.  This is a lot of responsibility!  And it's for three months.  I just...I don't even know.  I'm just totally shocked that she would ask ME of all people to do this. ME! D:  

My first thought is: what the hell is she thinking?!  Second: I have no experience at this!  Third:  Can I psychologically handle this much responsibility? D:  because there is a LOT of shit that goes down in our department, and I would basically be the dayshift DA.

I am flattered beyond reason because both Kat and Kathy thought of me for this.  These two are a couple of the smartest, strongest women I've ever had the opportunity to meet.  And they think I would be up to this!  I just...I don't even know what to think.  

I'm babbling and repeating myself now.  Wow. o_o  I have to seriously, deeply consider this because this is dealing with peoples' livelihoods here."

Aye, all of this election hullabaloo has made me a bit reflective today.  While I was at work, this song came on my MP3 player and I started to think about just how much I've seen in my twenty-eight years here.  Sure, it's not as much as Miss Ann the 106 year old lady Obama mentioned in his speech, but I've seen a lot.

This song was written for when the Berlin Wall came down, but I think the sentiment behind it is very relevant to where we stand now.  I was ten years old then, and I just remember being so happy about it.  I had just learned what the Berlin Wall was for in school and I knew it was a good thing it was gone.  I also remember being able to buy chunks of it at K-Mart.

I've lived through Reaganomics, seen Star Wars (both the movie and the space laser project Reagan headed), women truly beginning to come into their own.  I have seen the advent of the AIDS epidemic and the widespread panic and prejudice that followed in its wake.  The tearing down of the Berlin Wall, college students confronting tanks in Tiananmen Square, shell shocked soldiers coming home from witnessing Jihad first hand in the desert, only to be sent back there almost twenty years later.

I sat and watched in horrified silence as the World Trade Center collapsed, taking with it a huge chunk of New York's iconic skyline.  Did you know that September 11, 2001 was the <i>second</i> time terrorists tried to destroy those buildings?

I've seen my country prosper, and I've seen it decimated by natural disaster.  The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was, up to this point, the greatest gathering of sheer <i>giving</i> done by my people.  So much money, food, clothing, time, and effort was given so freely.  We did the same when the tsunami destroyed the tiny islands around southern India.  

America has done great and terrible things, like being so blinded by religious zealotry and pride that George W. Bush was elected to two terms of office.  I've seen the rise of the internet, and cellular technology.  Our <i>Rowe v. Wade</i> is being waged over embyronic stem cells.  Our Vietnam is being fought on the outskirts of Darfur and in the wilds of Iraq and Afghanistan.  We have the sense now though, to not call our soldiers ""baby killers"" and spit on them when they come home.  We're just grateful to see them come home alive.

CDs, MP3s, and iPods, have replaced my tape cassette playing walk-man.  I can't remember the last time that I listened to a vinyl record.  Hell, I even know what an Eight Track tape was!  We've gone beyond FM into HD satellite feed radio that can be heard from anywhere in the <i>entire world.</i>  What was yesterday's magic is today's commonplace.  To think that right now all I have to do is sign into a little computer program and I can chat in real time with my friend Jillian who lives in Australia.  Previously that would have been a hell of a phone bill!

I'm just amazed at everything I've seen and lived through in such a short time.  Now I stand here and I see yet another historical moment: the first black president of the United States.  Just forty years ago his relatives and the majority of my work friends' were still fighting just to have the right to vote!  We have come so far!

And we stand on the brink of Great and Miraculous Change or Absolute Disaster.  Our planet is dying, our environment becoming too toxic and destabilized to sustain healthy life.  The entire world economy is perched on the rim of another Great Depression.  The entire world economy.  We have evolved into a true world community in the past ten years.

I know this sounds like a whole lot of ruminating rubbish, but really, it just blows my mind.  These are only the major things that I've seen in my life.  There are a thousand and one little details that make up what is now me.  Have you ever tasted Crystal Pepsi? *laugh*  How about used a Sit-n-Spin or Skip It?  A Lite Brite? Or tried New Coke?  When was the last time that you exchanged friendship bracelets or put friendship pins on your Reebok sneakers?  Or do you just TXT UR BFF NAO?

I am amazed.  And surprisingly grateful.  Even for all of the catastrophes, both personal and the not so personal."

And then something in my lizard brain kicks up at this and inherently rebels against the idea of Rules and Form.  I see it for what it is, my <i>addiction</i> to Form.  That is what causes me so much pain.  There is something in me that <i>craves</i> solidity, rules, <i>control.</i>

That is what makes this world, this world after all.  The desire of Form, Pattern, of <i>Order.</i>  It's completely governed by those Laws as well because it's Space-Time that dictates and holds Form.  Because if we <i>do</i> exist, we must inhabit a specific coordinate of Space-Time.

If you examine all of the theories in astrophysics you have t contend with the idea that Space-Time is a fluid, flexible thing that is entirely relative to one's perception of it.  Thus, this world is Illusion, ""a hungry ghost made of mist and air.""  That is what an Illusion is, a bending of sight and perception by means of a specific arrangement to create/effect a specific idea/image.  So wouldn't that make Order and Form the Great Lie?

That we really are just fluid, fluctuating <i>transient</i> and formless energy, that can Do and Be Anything that it wants to?  That the natural state of ""things"" is a completely abstract idea?  Ever changing, ever flowing, and completely without Rules or Constraints of any kind?  Absolutely Free and absolved of all responsibility to anyone/thing, except for that which one chooses for one's self?  

So much culpability, so much personal responsibility and self-governance...what is one to <i>do</i> what such limitless possibility?  And nothing illustrates the smallness, the pettiness of the human virus.  They always have to try and control everyone and everything, infect it and mutate it into a likeness of Them.  It's arrogant and pathetic.

And it leads me once again to the knowledge that I have to begin studying and practicing again.  I have to break open my own head so that I can Know these things as more than Intellectual Ideas, but with that deep abiding lizard-brain <i>instinctual</i> Understanding.  

That the world is <i>mine</i> for the Making."

2. I will respond by asking you 5 questions.
3. You should then update your LJ with the answers to the questions.
4. You should include this and an offer to interview someone else in the post [only if you want to].
5. When others comment asking to be interviewed you should ask them 5 questions.

These are questions from my dear <lj user=""penny_fig"">

<b>1. Tell me some of the places you've lived so far in your grand life.</b>
Honestly, I've lived my entire life in the ever so fantastic (/sarcasm) state of Michigan.  Now I've moved a dozen and a half different times living in different cities like Brownstown, Southgate, Westland, Dearborn Heights, Southgate, Southfield, Southgate, Southgate...I'm noticing a pattern here!  I think the main reason that I'm still in this state is because I don't know just where I want to move to yet.  It's somewhere mountainous though.  I do know that.

<b>2. What are some traits you find deplorable in mankind?</b>
And here I was thinking that these were going to be short answer questions!  There are millions of things that I despise about mankind, but the chiefest among them has to be the general lack of <i>THINKING!</i>  People just blunder through life without putting any thought to anything that they do or say or even think.  They just blindly accept whatever is spoon fed to them by their talking picture boxes.  That also dovetails into laziness, fear, sentimentality, and just the overall <i>weakness</i> of the human condition.  I mean really people,  PUT YOUR BIG GIRL PANTIES ON AND SUCK IT UP!  There are MUCH worse things that can happen to you.  Trust me on this one.  I find the arrogance of the human race utterly deplorable because it is <i>unearned.</i>  They go around calling themselves ""special"" and ""powerful"" and this, that, and the other thing, when really they know absolutely nothing about how life actually works or the nature of the universe.  Honestly, how can people think that we are the <i>ONLY</i> intelligent life out there?  Really.

<b>3. What is your favorite historical time period?</b>
Oh wow, this one is tough.  It's such a toss up between the apex of the Grecian era, the Renaissance, or the Wild West/late Victorian/Edwardian.  The first because so many brilliant minds were coming to the fore and introducing new ideas, new ways of living, etc.  The Renaissance speaks for itself.  It was one of the greatest periods of change and learning in human history.  The last, purely for the fashion, the cowboys, and Jack the Ripper. x3  That ""man"" right there is a spectacular piece of conspiracy.  That, and again, there was just so much <i>pioneering</i> going on.  You can never go wrong with expanding your horizons.

<b>4. Do you prefer challenges or the easy way out? Don't be ashamed if it's the latter. I hate challenges, personally. :B </b>
Everything with me has to be a fight.  I can't even accept help when I need it without trying to justify that I can do everything on my own.  I'm also an adrenaline junkie, so the hardest and faster you hit me, the happier I am.  Full throttle, pedal to the metal, balls to the wall, and all sorts of other cliche euphemisms is how I like to live my life.  Nothing brings out a person's true character like a good solid challenge, and I have a real thing for Truth.

<b>5. What is your opinion on marriage? Is it meaningful, meaningless, or somewhere in between?</b>
Marriage is an institution, but who wants to live in an institution?  For me, the concept is a pointless one because I can't stand anyone enough to want to put up with their personal bullshit for the rest of my life.  No thank you.  For other people though, it may be the best thing in the universe.  What kills me about it though in this day and age is that you have all the Right Wingers screaming about how it's supposed to be between one man and one woman.  However, the majority of these one man-one woman couples are jumping into things too fast.  They get divorced within five years, cheat on each other, and wreak havoc in their childrens' lives because they were impetuous morons. Yet, the majority of the gay couples that I know have been together 10+ years and have several children whom are bright, intelligent, and rather well-adjusted individuals.  Go figure.  So that's what I think of it: that if you're going to do it, STICK WITH IT!  Marriage IS for life.  If you don't want to, or are not <i>absolutely sure beyond the shadow of a doubt</i> that you want to spend the rest of your life with this one person, DON'T FUCKING DO IT!  >_>  I'm done now.

"event","...or at least that's what the guy who held the elevator door for me said.  I had to agree with him though because I was running my ass off at the time!  I did about four and a half miles in forty-five minutes while carrying 30-45 lbs. of glass microscope slides and specimen containers.  It was fanTAStic. x3  That was my second to last run of the day too, so what impressed me the most was that I managed to pull that from somewhere around the vicinity of my ass.

Oh and another really hilarious thing happened at work today!  I just have to fucking laugh at this kid so damn hard.  Really.  See, in my department at work I am one of seven white people.  The rest of the people I work with are black.  Anyway, what happened was there is this clinic out on 12 mile road.  It's like a semi-rich country type area out there.  So my buddy Derek had to go into the basement of this place to do his pick up, and he stopped to go to the bathroom.  He ended up walking in on this skinhead kid writing all over the wall:  I HATE NIGGERS!  JESUS SAVES!  and other honkey lingo.  Then, the kid turns around and sees Derek (who happens to be a rather large black man) and yells at him: I HATE NIGGERS! and fucking SPITS on him!  So Derek blasted him in the face.  As he deserves. x3  Unfortunately the kid's buddies were there waiting in their pick-up truck, so he couldn't do too much more to him.

I mean really though, how can you be that backwards and provincial still? What era are you living in?  It just blows my mind and makes me writhe with hilarity at the sheer absurdity of it all!  I also wonder just what that kid will do if Obama gets elected. xD  Do you see why I despise so many Americans and why I feel the need to say that no, I am NOT one of THOSE Americans.  =_=  So yah, that was work in a nutshell.

Last night was cool too.  One of my favorite shows to watch is Ghost Hunters, and they did a VERY cool show last night.  They got to go to Waverly Hills Sanatorium in Kentucky.  This is like <i>THE</i> place to go if you're into the paranormal, or a paranormal investigator.  Something <i>always</i> happens, and boy did stuff happen last night!  Shadow People everywhere.  Strange creatures flying through walls, and child sized figures running across the hallway and you can only see it on the thermal imager.  That was just some of it.

On top of that, just seeing the place was amazing.  It's 189,000 sq. ft. and 63,000 people died there from tuberculosis.  The original tables are still in the morgue, and there is an extra room attached to it where they used to stuff the bodies when it got too full and they couldn't get them out fast enough.  That happened even with a body chute!  Yeah, just picture walking up the stairs from the basement to come into work, and along the other side of it there's just a smooth cement ramp with a hook line pulling body after body down it.  Yeah~  Would be awesome except for the whole tuberculosis thing.  I can live without that.  Literally! HA! XD

That's enough out of me. x3"

I'm not so much surprised by the woman's actions.  It's the fact that more and more people are supporting her as they days go by.  It almost makes me ashamed to be an American, merely because I'm associated with her by nationality alone.  It also kind of sucks when I have to explain to my European friends that no, I'm not one of the stupid Americans."

I can't fucking sleep 'cuz
I'm hearing every word you said to me
echoing in long tunnels of memory
and I can't sleep
'cuz your words are haunting me
bringing me to bleed
breaking down everything
I ever thought was me
Your words still raining down on me
""I never wanted you""
the phrase that shaped me
sticks and stones may break my bones
but your words will always kill me


I'm praying for rain
make the sky cry my tears
'cuz I don't have time to mourn
gotta keep marching on
feeling the loss
pour down the rain
maybe the chill will bumb th epain
'cuz I can't stop
no matter how much it hurts
what's taken away from me
and I'm praying for rain
'cuz I can't cry
so if the sky
sheds a tear for me
I can tell myself that it's okay
And I can't stop
but it's catching up to me
everything I've had to suppress
that I couldn't let myself feel
and I'm praying for rain
to wash it all away


I know a nervous little man
he tells me the most useless things
of shopping, fur coats, and broken dreams
He fidgets and twitches, wasting more time
as he speaks of moments lost
Every movement, a shattered shell of motion


<u>Doldrums</u>
The sea's becalmed
Leviathan awaits
listing in dead waters
you should be terrified right now
nothing can save you from the beast you've summoned
hand tailored to your demise
nothing can save you from me
Can't take the heat?
Hide belowdecks
huddle inside yourself
all the little lies you told
to justify yourself
NEVER LIE TO ME AGAIN!
that was the beginning of the end
The stars aligned
and Fate divine
is smiling on Vengeance
the one true beat,
of my black, dead heart,
that you made
then tore apart
Never leave me...ha!
Nothing left of you!
For I will do all the Devil's afraid to do to you
my one and only,
my beautiful liar...
called the demons of Truth from the depths of guilt
and now it's killing you.
For I will have my way with you
and there's nothing you can do
save a freshening wind
to blow you in
from dead waters

"event","I have some pure, unadulterated, sheer good news.

YESTERDAY I TOOK THE FIRST REAL NAP I'VE HAD IN YEARS! 8D

Yeah.  I came home from work yesterday, happily exhausted, and crawled into my bed because I wanted to rest a little bit.  Next thing I knew it was 830 at night, and I didn't even remember falling asleep!  THEN! I got up, made some dinner, then went BACK to sleep until my alarm went off this morning.  >_>  So that's just one thing.

Another is that, whereas I am still staying up stupid late before it happens, I am actually getting tired and sleeping at night.  I'm getting a buttload of exercise at work, and I don't have to deal with any people for more than a handful of minutes at a time.  Not only that, but I don't have to see Saggy Basset Face anymore! 8D HAPPY DAY!  I no longer have to repress my homicidal urges because I no longer have to see the thing that causes them!  You would not <i>believe</i> what a stress reliever <i>that</i> is!

I am actually in a good mood.  I'm depressed, but it's not the crippling abject misery that I usually feel so this is a vast improvement.  I can deal with this, no sweat.

I have my own place.  I have a new car.  I have a job that keeps me decently occupied during the day and that I actually enjoy for the most part.  I have time now to actually go back to school.  Things are looking up for the very first time in my life.

Gods above and below does <i>THAT</i> feel strange. o_O"

See, the very first thing I did while starting my brand new route today was walking into the Cytopathology lab to check for any slides or anything, and what do I do but have my right ankle give out on me so that I trip and fall right in front of everybody.

The best part?  I now have a huge knobby bruise on my left knee where it connected with the floor and I've been limping all day.  JOYGASM! 8D

<strike>And I get to walk anywhere between 2 and 6 miles every hour, on the hour! It felt GRRRRR<i>EAT!!</i></strike>"

"event","On Friday night we had our first frost.  It now officially <i>smells</i> like autumn.

Saturday night, we had our second.  It <i>feels</i> like autumn.  I also put my friends on trial for ""murder"" in front of a goddess in my D&D campaign.  I always get so nervous when it's my turn to DM.  Even though it's just the two of them, I get sweaty palms.  My limbs get twitchy, my breath shortens, and I want to look everywhere and focus on everything <i>but</i> them.  

Sunday, it was quiet.  Except for the two stray dogs that were running around the parking lot of my apartment complex.  One of them was a full-blooded pit bull bitch.  She kept barking at everyone.  She was protecting her ""friend"", the male dog she was with, because he'd been hit by a car and was pretty badly injured.  He had a five inch flap of skin hanging off his ribs on the left side.

Today...today sucked.  No one told me on Friday what I was doing today at work, so I ended up showing up an <i>hour</i> early for work.  After nearly getting myself flattened on the highway by a semi-truck that wasn't watching where it was going!  Seriously, how hard is it to see a BRIGHT YELLOW CAR THAT'S HONKING ITS HORN AT YOU?!  Moron.  To top off the suckage today, I had to do my old route so I had to see Bitch Face today.  And can you guess what she did to me today? :D  Try totally screwed me over on time.  AGAIN!  

Yavette covered my route when I was on vacation, and then while I was training last week on my new route.  Guess who never had a problem? :3  Yeah, exactly. I am <i>SO</i> glad I do not have to deal with her saggy jowled basset hound face EVER AGAIN!  As I get to do my new route tomorrow, and for the rest of the week at least.  Hopefully, they'll just let me keep going since Keith is being trained on his new route.  *sighs and crosses fingers*

The icing on my cake, had a minor mental collapse yesterday that carried over into today.  The even better news?  It's going to be lasting for at least the next two weeks! JOY!  I really really hate having PMDD because now that I have my own space I can actually be <i>okay</i> mentally and emotionally.  Except for this.  Which cuts my ""good"" time in half.  Two weeks out of a month.  I guess I should count my blessings in that I have those two weeks each month.  I used to not have any at all. :/"

"event","Forgive me if this doesn't make any sense.  I don't think it's really supposed to.  This is one of the short little stories that run through my head at random times.

<lj-cut text=""Wisdom is a Heavy Burden"">
He knew what had aged Jesus in the Bible.  Wisdom.  Or more precisely, the gaining of it.

The thought haunted him as he sewed another stitch into the binding of the book, and cigarette smoked curled into the still dusty air, a forgotten smoggy zephyr.  The bindings on the composition books were always too tight.  You could never get into the margins of them, and he liked to fill every inch of the paper with his thoughts and words.

That was just a tag end thought though, because the real character in question was Jesus.  Why he was so protective of children.  The answer was obvious: because he wanted them to be happy and have the childhood that was denied him.  Being the son of a neglectful, and when he did pay attention to you abusive, father had a tendency to make you grow up fast.

There was the fact too that Jesus was definitely ahead of his time.  You know that all the other kids avoided him because he was ""too smart"" and they thought him strange.  Precocious children were always thought of as ""strange.""  Yet another thing they had in common.  

Now to sew on the cover.  Even if the bindings were tight, he still liked the squiggled covers.  Something about the irrational designs pleased him.

Then, there was the whole time Jesus spent with the Essenes.  They tought him how to heal, and walk on water, and do you think it would be easy to put that kind of learning into a child?  A twelve year old boy, just on the verge of manhood and full of all the restlessness of youth? No, that would make it even harder.  Yet, it was done.  No childhood.  Had to grow up too fast.

So lead the children unto him, because he will keep them safe, and young, and happy.  Tears would never splatter down and cause ink to run in dark rivulets across the page if he was around.  No sir.

But he wasn't around.  Jesus had been a man who loved and suffered, and then had his face appropriated by The Church.  All totally without his permission.  They made a man into a god, and refused to acknowledge(except peripherally) that he ate, drank, pissed, and fucked like every other human on this planet.  Even if he was in touch with his inner angel, his messiah, his Saving Grace.

Just ask the pretty redhead sitting next to him at his last meal with his friends.  She'd probably tell you a completely different story, and he can see all this because he's got more insight than the average bear.  He can lure the bees away before going after the honey so that he doesn't get stung half as much anymore.  And...no.  Stop.  Put the kabash on that thought and go back to the original subject.

This isn't about roly poly bears and honey bees, because Heaven and Jesus' mother Mary both know that if he had had a little more fluffy stuffing in his life, Jesus would probably have ended up a lot more like Christopher Robin instead of suffocating to death on a cross for his father's mistakes.

But Compassion is another Wisdom enitrely.  That was sewn into another book in another lifetime and has been long since forgotten.  Just like Jesus' humanity.  So instead of laughing, he gets to hang in all the suffering that should have been his father's for all the vampires and cannibals to behold.  The Cruelty is lost on them though.

Why? Why is it so easy for them to just gloss over everything and not look at the details? Why?  Who the hell are They to think they'll be Saved? That they're anything like good enough?

Anger.  That was a familiar passage and the words of it burned through his mind as his current project went sailing across the room, the worktable having been shoved ruthlessly over.  Coffee and cigarettes went flying every which way, staining and singeing all they touched.

Another wroth bellow echoed through the room as the fire dared to grow and consume his Words.  He ruthlessly stomped it out, quashing the bright young flame, and tearing through the pages scattered beneath his feet.

Why couldn't they see? See that they were just the same?  He was Special too.  He knew things as well!  Jesus would know though, when they finally got to meet.  And he could tell Jesus that it was okay, and they would both know together.  The vampires and the cannibals and all the horrible fathers of the world would be left alone in their own little waking nightmares.

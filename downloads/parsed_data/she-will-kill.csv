Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.

Plus, I saw a shooting star tonight on the way home from a good time.

I think it meant things might try to start looking up.
Either that, or the world is dying and everything will come crashing down soon.
Lets hope for the first one."

Pictures are good... so this is what I've come up with after about an hour of  messing with it.  I'm sure in my spare time I'll change it up a bit.  But as for now, I'm done.

So, things are going well.  
Everything is in it's place.
I had an interview today, with some nice people.
It's not much moneys and it's no benefits, but I've got a little bit of time to still get THAT job.
I'm living off of extra sweet tea, car rides where I get lost, ""The Rock of Love"" and ""LA INK""
and the comforts of having a very sweet man near me and a nice lofty apartment that seems to always be too hot.

Hopefully soon I'll be making some friends.
I've got a few people that I need to meet within the next week or so, or they'll probably stop asking me to do things. ;)

I miss my family and friends back home immensely but things will work out.
and the phone DOES work both ways...just because I've been so busy to not have called you, doesn't mean you don't matter....fucking pick up the phone and call me.

We went into D.C. last weekend for some drinks and fun...
I enjoyed myself a lot.

This weekend is my birthday...
I don't think anything is planned.

I think a bunch of us are going camping at the end of the month.
We have tickets for the Tiger Army show and the Horrorpops, now just gotta get the ones for Hank III.
:)

Things are just fine
in this tornado whirl wind 
of a mind.

I'll update again soon.

P.S. If you want to get me the best birrrrfday gift ever, I want a hairless pussy for my birthday!

i still come to lurk once in a great while.

my life is getting ready to take off.
i'm excited and completely scared at the same time.
however, still no job opportunities,
but i'm not worried.

ever since i started taking Percocet, i've had such crazy and some-quite-awful dreams.
the first one was of my mother and stepfather trying everything in their power to kill me.
the next was of my father slinging grey paint in a nearby field to be able to track a tornado's path before it hit the area.... it then destroyed our house.
and the third was of my late grandmother, and her huge walk-in-closet, that turned into the ocean
and her telling me to go on ahead of her, 
because the water was fine, 
and crabs pinching my toes wouldn't hurt too bad.

thats hard to believe.
anyway,
there were more, but i dont remember them and you dont care.

i think all these dreams are saying something to me
even if its stuff i already know.
<i>i know better.</i>
to know thats all it is.
yes.

therapy is going good.
i'm walking, but still recovering.


i'll be happy and healthy again soon.
i can already feel you.

The Shield was a hot item yesterday....
because of Liz's picture and the article
but even more of a hot item this morning.

Its been stolen? Taken off stands? For whatever reason... THEY ARE GONE!
Thats illegal.
and hasnt happened ever... at least not in the past 7 years since Patricia has been here.
They are said to still be in the HP/Ed Building/Outside the Shield newsroom, but thats it?
This pisses me off.
Now its really raising some controversy.
Now even more articles will most likely be published.
A police report has been filed.
Security is going to investigate.

And this is allllll so strange...
and yesterday was National Coming Out Day...
does this tie in with things?
It just so happens that such a controversial issue came out during this week...
but is there a connection?
Also there was a debate about Gays on Campus last night in the Forums.


Last week all the copies of the Aerie were taken.
Now this shit is why I like journalism.
Detective work.

This is exciting."

ones that have stuff in common with me.
there are a few.&nbsp;
but a girl needs people her age to count on, and talk to...&nbsp;
and know that they will understand her fully, and be there.
i'm on the prowl.

i'm so sorry jenna.
your brother was much to young to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;
but if you are the type to believe in a better place,&nbsp;
then i'm here to tell you now, he wont be in anymore pain.
and be grateful for that, and happy for him.
he was a good kid.
and i love you.
you are in our thoughts.

I'm offically done with work for the summer. Thank the holy Jesus.
However, the rest of my&nbsp;summer has filled up pretty fast already.

Classes are killing me. I'm completely burnt out.
I dont want to study, I cant study, I almost refuse to study....
I suppose I'll be kicking my ass all this week to get 2 weeks worth of shit done before finals.
I'm a fucking cunt.

I just need a break.

I'm going to see Dane in 10 days.&nbsp; This makes me quite happy.
And we may actually have stuff to do since I've been using Myspace as a tool to find people&nbsp;
that ""look interesting enough"" to ask them where we should go and visit while I'm there.
Yes, I'm Lame. But it works.
It will be good to get away, get to somewhere new, and see my baby.

School starts soon. I'm broke.
But I have a plain little apartment, that i'm planning on making into a neat little home.
With the help of yard sales, vintage stores, hand-me-downs, and flee markets.
Anyone have any cool/cheap curtains they'd loan me, sell me or give to me?"

And I have too.&nbsp; But this time, it's going to happen.<br />Especially since it woke me up at 7 o'clock in the AM on my only day to sleep in.<br />My mind can be a fucking bitch.<br />But I'm dealing with it.............</strong><br /><br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut""><strong>I'm tired of hurting people that care for me more than life itself... <br />and I care for them, just the same, <br />but it's like I have some sort of BLOCK. <br />and i'm tired of always being dejected. <br />I'm generally not upset all the time, but I guess it seems that way to certain people. <br /><br />I've been reminiscing lately as to when&nbsp;I use to do drugs, alot. <br />Because I cant figure some things out. <br />except that :<br />I was happy then. I was carefree. I was tough.<br />I was blind. I was stupid. <em>I wasnt in control</em>. <em>I was immature</em>. I was disrepectful to family, friends, and my body.<br />I didnt know how to deal with things so I turned to something to help with it. <br />It just happened to be the most immature and ridiculous thing&nbsp;I could do.&nbsp;<br />And it finally caught up with me, got me in trouble.<br />I lied, I lost,&nbsp;<strike>I regret</strike>,&nbsp;and finally learned.<br />But at the time, it helped, and it made things <em>okay </em>for quite awhile. <br /><br />But now that I'm older and (<em>hopefully</em>) more mature and smarter... <br />and have been clean for a few years... you'd think i'd be ok. <br />But the fact is, is that I don't think I ever got the chance to deal with things on my own.(because the drugs took care of that)&nbsp;<br />And that is why I feel so behind right now. <br /><br />I <strike>need to</strike> MUST be stronger. <br />Not just for myself. <br />But for Dane, my family, and for some of my friends. <br /><br />I used to be scared of nothing, worried about nothing, was never self-conscious, I stood up for myself. <br />All that has changed. <br />I'm still there... just a little blurry at times...but pretty much a coward.&nbsp;<br />In situations that I would normally say or do something now... i just dont .<br />well, nowit either takes a few good drinks, or something to really really piss me off for me to do something about it.<br /><br />Some of the simplist tasks scare me now. <br />Things that NEVER used to at all. <br />and this worries me. <br /><br />I need to get back to what I was, but this time, have a spine. <br />I can still be tough. <br />I know its there.<br /><br />The learning and growing is going to start now. <br />and if&nbsp;I dont shape-up, then <u>someone can punch me in the face, I swear.<br /></u></strong><br /><br /></div>

i totally spent money today that i didnt really have any business spending.

like the day started off fine. 
i spent $5 on various vintage items, 
then spent $15 on a matching 1950's set of nightstands, 
then 50 cents at another place in Henderson, 
$12 for dinner at some uptight-lesbian-hating-bar-diner thing, 
then a whopping $55 at the mall tonight.

i hope i have enough gas in my tank to get me home tomorrow, cause i sure as hell only have quarters left in my purse.  
i'm lame. and stupid.
but really all of that stuff is for my apartment next year... or my belly, 
except for the last purchase from the mall, that was pure greed.
oppps.
*shrugs*

now, onto studying for a final that i'm most likely going to fail anyway.

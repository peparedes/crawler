Just something I don't have. 
And you all fucking wonder why.
You constantly put me down.
And make me second best.
I'm just a person.
I'm allowed to make mistakes.
And have my flaws.
And these words of pain I'm writing.
Is my way of telling you, I don't exactly give a shit.
We can talk all day, if you'd like.
And you'll tell me your bullshit lies.
And I can crack a smile.
But you really should know.
I'm not listening.
You wonder why my face is always stained with tears.
But I can't tell you, that sometimes it hurts so fucking bad.
A knife across my throat.
I can't scream into the darkness.
And my morbid thoughts.
They were created all by you.
Aren't you happy? 
You've created this monster inside of me.
Isn't that something wonderful?
You've made me go off again.
And I'm going in circles, trying to figure out what to do.
And how to ease the blood sucking pain.
I wonder too, what you would do.
If I was finally to get so fed up with this thing called life.
What would you do.
What exactly would you do?
I wouldn't be here anymore.
For you to torment.
What then?
How will you find another me, to tease.
And pick.
And hurt.
And fuck up, the way you've done me?
Just look at me.
Can't you see it?
This is you, it's not really me at all.
All your horrible words, they're going right back to you.
Because I'm not here anymore.
You've taken over, and I'm just another lost soul.
I'm sitting here, waiting on you to get over the shock.
Yes, I've just told you to shut the fuck up.
Why? 
Because I'm sick of you, and how you're treating me.
I think you should just go now.
Find another whole to make half.
And let me be me, something I know I can do.
Without you.


....>_> I have a really bad headache. But I guess that's what I get for banging my head on the wall a few times, as hard as I possibly could. 

Oh yeah, for those of you who are slow on the news, I have a new Xanga.
http://www.xanga.com/xSomethingSecretx

I'm a Harry Potter fan and all, but this is fucking hilarious..

the tears slowly ;; rolled down her face
as she whispered to h.e.r.s.e.l.f ' *

                       What song are these lyrics from?

        And the beauty that I'm faking lets me live my life like this...

Do you know? DO YOU? DO YOU!?!?

Do you want to know the truth? Do you?
WELL, you can't HANDLE the truth.

Coming back from the picnic thingy.
We heard The Ghost Of You..
And we sang.
Then..
we heard Sugar We're Goin' Down..
And we sang more.
We sang our pretty hearts out.

I LOVE YOU GUYS!

My foot hurts. No.. I just.. hurt.

The Used, My Chemical Romance, and Fall Out Boy, are going to star in a pr0n0 together.

And tomorrow will be tomorrow.
But yesterday,
It's forgotten in the sand.
Just another past, and this is just one more present.
One more day, that I have to deal.
And it's a repeating process.
Can't I just take a damn break?

....I dunno. It just came to mind, I guess.
I'm just a weee bit sick of certain things.

Like how every single day, I feel as if I'm about to go off and in the world, I have no purpose. That thought and that feeling makes me sick.

My hands are cold. =/ It sucks, my nose is cold. I'm always cold.

Ramble. Ramble. I ramble alot. But it's sometimes fun! Wheeee...
Yeah, okay. So.
I'm effin' bored.

..::: Your bitter goodbye, is ringing through this quiet night :::..

I've just noticed, everyone is just about in love with Pete Wentz. Nyaha. Oho, the irony of it all. -Shrugs- I still love all my MCR boys, and other band boys, and stuff. -Nods- Just so people know. I haven't moved on to another band. I'm still a huge fucking fan.

::: I hope you know, you were my best friend :::

This may be the angst in me. But I think it's fucking funny, when someone says, ""Oh, I know how you're feeling."" I only say that, when I really know. -Rolls her eyes.- 

::..:: When The sky is falling, I know I have you, and That's all I need ::..::

"event","OH MY GOD, another poem. And I actually titled it. BY MYSELF. Do I get a cookie? Please?

Title: Forever.

Would you dance with me, if I asked you to?
Is this step to the right, too much for you to bare?
And this little piece of shelter we share..
Are you even there?
Sometimes I have to ask, and wonder.
And to dream and cry, it's the worst.
My worn jacket can't keep me from the wind much longer.
And the damage being thrown, I just can't back away.
This step back, a dance, and it's made for just us two.
Can we move to the left? 
We'll be safe under the spotlight. Unless..
You take the chance, and dare for another fight.
I swear, I'll hold onto you forever.
Just say you'll love me 'till the end of time.
And I'll tell you I love you a million times, if I have to.
I'll mean it every single time.
And even in the end, I'll never let go.
Not even when our skin is wrinkled, and I'm about to go in my forever place.
Where I shall rest.
Not ever, will I part with you.
I'll be there 'till the end.
And not even death could tear me apart from you.
Let's not take a step back. Not too much.
Because I just want to move forward with you.
And I don't want it to rewind.
Could we twirl, and I'll fall into your arms.
And you can hold me untill the very last star fades in the sky tonight.
This is ours, and it's forever to be held. 
Let's share a single kiss, and make it last.
To be stained in our memories, with a forever you and me.
A forever, us.


Sooo, whatcha' think?


Player Hate On Me... Josh Tobin... YO.... 'Playa Haters'.... Yeah, old. But funny. I'm changing it now.

I made a post on Gaia. Liek woah.
-Screams- I dunno, either.

I'm in a semi-good mood.
SEMI-EVIl.
You're the diet coke of evil, bitch.

Kit-Kat lurves that Toro Kid. FOR REAL.

-Cough- -Blink- Pete has a nice bum. -Snorts-...
I dunno what to write. Waaaaaah.

Bye.
Love you all.

"event","Sorry Natasa, you probably wanna kill me. But I just got home, and now I've gotta go. Just posting this. 

My confidence is thin, and I can't see.
Not even when I blink away those damn tears.
My heart is beating, and within every beat.
I want it to slowly fade away. 
And drop me off the face of the earth.
My blood is red, and it bleeds within.
It's a taste of me, and my every flaw, and desire.
My smiles are a pain inflicted inside.
And it's where I hide, away from you.
My life is on standby.
And I can't find a way.
Beneath this layer of pale skin.
You can sense the broken pieces of the one.
And the way, I can wait a million times, for you to just say it.
My eyes, are the mirror, and window for you.
It shows what I've always worked to hide.
But sometimes you just don't see.
And my memories.
They're all lies.
It was never you and me.
And it was never this perfect.
My tears stain, and if you touch them, you'll burn.
This dream, is what it is.
A fake dream, that I've made up, and drew.
It won't be the same. Not ever.
And not today.
And my dream is breaking, like the thousand corpses inwith me.
They're breaking. And the bones are falling.
And this is all your sick doing.
Why. 
Oh God, please tell me.
Why did you chose me to be your victim?
And tell me why.
Why, you had to break me like this.
And..I'm...falling..
down.
Into your coffin, locked and cursed.



Tell meh whatcha' think.
My lip is bleeding. It tastes so good. -Vampire-
Anyways...

"event","-Burps- A poem I wrote. I think it's one of my favorites!

I can feel my salty tears, burning at the brim.
I can't blink them back, or wipe them away.
They're there to stay.
As your doll, I'm broken.
I smile for you to see. 
But inside, I'm dying and falling.
I can't find my way, and I don't know how.
Lost in my emotions.
Inside I just want to be me, again.
I feel numb.
I can feel my heart break.
Into thousands of pieces.
You can't hear them.
Doubt you can even see it.
Whether you care or not.
I'm losing the fighting battle to be alive.
A strive that makes no sense.
I want to be at pure bliss.
When we touch and kiss.
But I can't, And I don't know why.
Pull my trigger. [x2]
So I can see my end.
Pull my strings.
And see me come to life.
With an automatic smile.
A life with joy.
Let me see you, for the very first time.
Our neverending love romance.
Love's last kiss.
For the first time, I want you to see.
Just how messed up I am.
I can't rhyme you something pretty, or make the words flow onto this paper, like magic.
Blood and tears, I cannot share.
Can't you just look me in the eye?
Or are you scared of the scars you'll see?
Love, I want to know.
Is it just how this feels?
A complicated row.
In circles, we go.
Pull my trigger.
And set me off.
I'll tell you just how I feel.
And keep my message in a bottle.
Locked away, in your thoughts.
I can't tell you, now.
No, you've gone on.
Were you ever even there?
In my past. In my dreams.
Is this true?
Are we real, and is this something pure?
We forever share.
Can I tell you a lie?
Just to make you smile?
Pull my trigger.
Let me fall.
Tie the knot. 
And I'm in pieces.
You're there, and I'm here.
Bundled with the flaws.
With no resist.
See eye to eye.
No, we cannot.
You can't look at me.
Too afraid.
Pull my trigger. [x2]
And let me fall forever.
-[End]-

Yeeeeeah...another poem....


Inside, you can't breath, you're locked.
Run and hide, that's you. Coward, you are. Down and gone, I can't believe I took a second chance.
Why I let my eyes wonder, for a second glance. I knew you were bad from the start.
Beginning, to end. You're weren't anything but my horrible dreams. 
A fake lover, that I never did discover.
I was too wrapped up into your lies, to see the truth that was behind.
My blue eyes can't shield, I'm always lost, and gone.
You've torn me, and I can't piece myself back together.
I feel dead, and I blame you. 
You're a joke, and now everyone's had a laugh.
I can't smile, because it hurts. And I'm screaming for you to notice me.
How you hurt me, and never bothered to give a damn. 
You're another line, and I'm another victim.
How many other people, have you done this to?
You're not a dream, and I'm not another one of your toys.
You're my heartbreaker, and I'm just another one of your sick lies.
Outside, you show the beauty and trust.
Something that's another lie.
You can't fake it quite well.
You're on the surface, and we can all see.
Only, I couldn't then.
The tricks you made, and the lies I take.
I wish I could of seen, what you were.
A fool, with no heart, at all.
Frozen, like ice. You can't feel, you've been long gone.
You killed me, with a simple whisper.
Your acts and lies.
A display of affection that was never real.
A bullet to my pathetic heart, and a drop of blood from my lifeless soul.
Can you really bleed, if you're far off gone?
I want to kill you, as you've done to me.
Let me have the last laugh.
A sad story to be told, from me to you.
Our stage, for all to see.
What a loser you are.
And what a person, you've made me.
I'm fading.
A spark with no real light.
Goodbye to you.
Goodbye to me.
Goodbye to our sweet nothings, and my sweet dreams.

It's funny. I never thought I'd feel this way again. I can feel myself dropping. Dropping, and down I'm going. And I'm without anyone who can reach out and grab me. Or anyone who want's to.
It's funny. How life works. It's cruel, yet beautiful. Sad, yet, you can smile. I know this may not make sense at all, and I'm sorry.

You've got to laugh, because if not, you'll cry.

The amount of pills I'm taking counteracts the booze I'm drinking
and this vanity I'm breaking, lets me live my life like this
and well I find it hard to stay, with the words you say
Oh baby let me in
Well I'll choose the life I've taken, never mind the friends I'm making
and the beauty that I'm faking lets me live my life like this
And well I find it hard to stay, with the words you say
Oh baby let me in
And you can cry all you want to, I don't care how much

You'll invest yourself in me, we're not working out
And you can't touch my brother and you can't keep my friends
and we're not working out, we're not working out
This time I mean it, never mind the times I've seen it

Well I hope I'm not mistaken by the news I heard from waking
and it's hard to say I'm shaken, by the choices that I make
and well I find it hard to stay, with the words you say
Oh baby let me in

Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough For The Two Of Us - My Chemical Romance

I didn't go to school today. I just didn't feel like it.
I was sick. I suppose.
I'm torn, I'm broken. And I'm going in circles. I'm falling, and I'm drowning. There's no exit. No escape. I've got nowhere to go.


I wrote some of the cell-fic out. And Cat wasn't on today. -Sigh.- Sooo, yeah. She couldn't see it. And I haven't typed it all out. :/ I'm re-writing some of it. I hope she doesn't hate me, too.

.....I feel dead.

You can't truely smile, unless you've shed some tears.

I'm really not, woah-kay.

A poem... by me....
----I've found my way back, times before. But now, it seems I can't. Lost in this nothing,
And nowhere to go. You're not there to hold me, and you can't even glance at me.
I'm drowning in this deep sea of emotions and feelings. I'm screaming, but you
can't hear me. I don't recall it ever being this bad. Total darkness, no light. You expect
too much. You take too much. I don't think I'll make my way out, this time.
No one to save me, when I fall. A single smile, could help me. Just to let me know
that you're there. There I go again, I'm off into my thoughts. I'm so alone, and you
can't see this. No one does. Not even myself. I smile pretty for you and everyone else.
I don't want people to worry, .. you to worry. I don't want anyone to know how
much I hurt, inside. No one really cares, though. As long you smile, and make-believe.
Ask no questions. You'll get no lies from me.---

Wowie. :/
You get what everyone else gets, you get a lifetime!!!

Really?

Another poem.. by me :/
--From your silent looks. To my heart you took. Sweet dreams to me. Goodnight to you. So long. Forever goodbye. Silent words. And a flaw in your smile. A gleam in your eyes. A neverending spill of tears.

The blood never tasted so sweet on my lips. And your fumes never smelled so lust-filled the times before. This is my quick suicide. My heart-felt death. A rose. A tear. I shall never get, or see. My quick goodbye, that no one will hear.

So much, for a true romance, and a one way ticket to Heaven. Fall from grace, into the thousand pains on the inside.
You put a bullet to my heart. And watch me cry. This much, I can not take. You crushed me, without a second thought.

A vulrenable side of me. Wanting you, and your love. Even if it hurt, and was wrong. Sometimes so wrong. Yet, so right, how can it be both? But we were shattered and we were thrown, into your endless schemes.

You tocuhed me, deep inside. Made me feel, like no one else could. Now you're throwing me away, like I'm nothing at all. What exactly, am I suppose to do? You like it, I can see. You're sick, I can see it.

And, you've killed me again. A stoney face. And a sadistic smile. A silver gun. A blast to my broken heart. Kill me, and let my blood dry on your hands. Maybe, just maybe, one day, you'll love me, as I love you...--

Song lyrics time.. again...because it's on, and making me cry..

The singer finished singing and she's walking out
The singer sheds a tear, her fear of falling out
And it's hard to say how I feel today
For years gone by and I cried

It's hard to say that I was wrong
It's hard to say I miss you
Since you've been gone, it's not the same

My worries weigh the world, how I used to be
And everything, I'm cold, seems a plague in me
And it's hard to say how I feel today 
For years gone by and I cried

It's hard to say that I was wrong
It's hard to say I miss you
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
It's hard to say I held my tongue
It's hard to say if only
Since you've been gone, it's not the same

Worse than the fear it's the lie you told a thousand times
before
Worse than a fear it's the knife
But it's hard to say how I feel today
For years gone by and I cried

It's hard to say that I was wrong
It's hard to say I miss you
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
It's hard to say I held my tongue
It's hard to say if only
Since you've been gone, I'm not the same
It's hard to say (God, it's hard to say)
Since you've been gone.
I'm not the same

Hard To Say - The Used

You all much think I'm pathetic. -Sighs.- I know.


O_o

I'm soooo tired. But I can never sleep. Makes a bunch of sense, eh?


I need to cheer up. :/
But I won't. :/

-Cries- Someone care, please? Someone hold me and wipe my tears away, that's all I ask!... No one cares though, and I need to stop this. Gaah!

.

I'm dizzy.. and I don't feel good. I haven't gotten sleep lately. And I think I'm going to crash soon.

I'm listening to I'm A Fake - The Used, at the moment. o_o

I'm really tired. :/

Lovely story.

Sorry, I've got alot on my mind lately, so shoot me?

...Another poem......

You never knew when to stop. You'd just keep going. Even after my throat hurt from screaming. You'd never blink, even after every tear I'd shed. You kept going, even after I got the knife, and cut. You liked it. I knew you did. You'd finally killed the one thing in your life, that was strong. I was complete and whole, but you took it away, and I never knew. Not untill it hit my, full blast. Like the knife that hits my bare soft skin, every time I cut. And the deeper I cut, the prettier it gets. And like a bullet proof vest, I thought I was stronger than all of this. The sound proof room, I thought you'd never hear my silence screams. I wonder if it was possible that this was all a bad dream, you faked, and make me believe. I thought it was true, when you told me you loved me, and that I was your only one. You've crushed me like velvet and now I'm broken like the glass you threw. I don't want to look back, but you're there, and I have to. You were my wish, and you gave me exactly what you thought I deserved. A broken heart and a crumbled story, filled with my dripping blood, and salty tears, with a smile to cover it up.

...Yeah...........

I was going to type something and then forgot....What I was going to type...hmm..
OH!.. I've just realized, I never give any of my poems titles. Which is kinda odd. :/"

"event",": | : Lock and load. A joker at the guns hand. Stuck inside, you wouldn't want out.. Put the beautiful lyrics on hold. Maybe you can look at me, without an overdue glare. A sensitive smile. This just isn't you. Where is the angst person, that you once were. A mending heart. Never too late. Like a shield. A broken glass, that cut you too deep. You're another repeat in my sad poems. Didn't you see the time pass, like a beautiful death? On it's very edge. So egotistical, you can never breath in, and think about the petty pain you inflict. You thought you could see the inside out. You've got too much time on your hands. Your pathetic past time is to make her cry. Won't you break yourself this time? : | :

: | : Lock and load. You're another sad story, in this tattered journal. The last page is inked with blood and tears. Shaking, you can't see. You're just a nightmare, stuck in a dark world. Filled of your silent cries and screams. It's too late for anyone to save you. She's made sure that you're too far gone. Is it possible she turned the tables? Switched the reverse, and has you on your toes? You're a sick person, left with nothing. Calling out to your last hope. You dream, things will be the same. You know you're doomed. Lost in a world, that was once hers. : | :

: | : The person inside, has nothing left. You're dead. A cold shell. You're lost, you say? I laugh in your face, gleefully. I spit on your pained face, with a silly sadistic smile. You swallowed too many pills, and cut too many times. Something in the horizon. Still a dreamer, yet never a believer. Can you kill the inside ghost. She's there. And haunts. Something you once did. You think you can get out, but we know you can't. Lost in pain. Drenched in your washed tears. Torn from the waste. You're slowly slipping. : | :

: | : She wants to rip you even more. You can't deal. You scream. Giving her satisfaction. Something you've decided you don't want to happen. She feeds off of you and your lonliness. You think she's sick and morbid. She screams and shouts. You cowar away. Her being you. You being her. You've completely switched worlds. Isn't so pretty after all, is it? You can scream untill your throat splits. No one will ever hear you. The world has gone on. Forgotten you. See? You never meant a thing at all. : | :

: | : She's won the battle, and you're dead. Inside and out. You're bloodshot, and drained. You've became her little doll, she can dress and poke. Her little puppet she can slice and dice. You don't even fight at all. You can't care, because you're lost. Lost and broken. She has made you, this. As you once made her. She has you under her radar, and it isn't so fucking great after all, is it? She's killed you, and you can't do a thing about it. You're dead.  Into the waste land. The pits of hell, you go. : | :



I've decided to make THIS into a poem...

I feel like an idiot.
I feel like a loser.
I feel like a friend who wasn't ever good enough.
I feel like a poet who won't ever make it.
I feel like a daughter, who was wasted away.
I feel like a sad excuse for you to get away.
I feel like a sister who will never be known, or understood.
I feel like a student who will get lost in the books.
I feel like a total and complete dumbass.
Can anyone fix me? Anyone at all.
Step right up, to your next patient.
One who's crazed and lost.
Glazed over eyes, as she watches her life flash in front of her.

I really don't know how this happened, but I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone at all.
Well you see it started off as a simple joke. My life with the punch line, and I'm not the last one laughing..
I thought I could control it, but I never could. It was like my fix. My favorite little past time.
So now I stand, in the corner of my mind. Adding up numbers that don't quite make sense, marking the minutes as lines in the sand...
I fear, I'll get to myself. Though, I don't think you see. I'm slowly inching away from everyday life. A new sick obsession, covers me in blood, who was I last week and what have I become?
I never know which way to turn. And you wonder why, I'm always so quiet and scared.
My quarry lacks interest and my laugh are wry, i'll be washed up in the bay and watch you as you cry..
I sometimes wonder, if you ever care at all. Or am I your last project, and staged joke?
You've put me to the slide, with old love letters and blood stain ink...Was I too easy easy or to hard to think of?
You've kissed me times before, but you just didn't feel. Is it me, or our we frozen? Our hearts forever gone.
So let me crave this more then death, make me choke on all the glass. When we're moving in the past, forever frozen. Forever fallen, never say forever. 
Our broken hearts. Our final goodbyes, made of stone. You can't speak at all. I kiss you once. The sweet memory before our dying wish, made of dreams, and together we go.

It's pretty 'Cause of Cat's lines. :D"

And your guitar. That you rock so hard. Hard? Oh Shit! I forgot to study my vocabulary for Earth Science. Do you like Earth Science? I like the science in your hair.

Frank, Franky dear. I do give a damn. Damnit. You're hot, aren't you? Your hair is on fire. It looks that way. You rock out, also. I want to steal your gloves. The ones that look like those skelleton hands. Was that really your head? On Ash's computer? That was weird. You are pretty, aren't you? You have pretty eyes. Better to stare at Gerard? Or something. It's okay Frank. We all like Gerard.

Mikey, you look so. Innocent. I wish to poke your eyes out. Under those kool glasses. Where did you get them? Where did you get your pants? May I be the friction, in those jeans? I like those jeans. Or pants. Nice ass. That's right. Ass. Ass. And once more. Ass. You're so little and skinny. But you have a rather plump butt. Especially in those jeans. Can you breathe in them? Those jeans. I think I'll steal 'em. Right now. You better not run away. You better not. I will run after you. And I shall make you. My Mikey. Mikey- Mikey. I like your hair too. Yes, the hair. It looks soft. Like your ass.

Gerard, ah, Gerard. Lead vocalist. I like your brother, you know? How do people get so hot? Seriously. Tell the truth. Don't lie, Ger-ard. I will hurt you. If you like to meh.

 Are all Way brothers. So hawwt? how did they become. Like that? And you, Mr. Gerard. What the hell was that? That look on your face. In that Helena video? Heh? Tell me now. Mr. Gerard once so pale. Now a little less pale? Yes, you look like Elvis. I think you are reincarnated. I love you. And your brother. And the whole band. Damnit. I never really noticed. How much of a body you have. I seen you in one picture. With a bullet proof vest. And I also saw muscles. Nice. Very nice. Ass. Plump ass. Nice voice. Very sexy. High-pitched voice. Yeap-Adorable. You have chubby cheeks. You like eyeshadow. I like you. And your voice. It is what I, fall asleep to. As if you are screaming. In my ears at night. It is verry nice. Who's Will? Will, you marry me, Mr. Way? If you say no, will your brother say yes? Such dramatic faces in these music videos. All of you. Gerard, yes you make. The most convincing, sexiest, pee-pee in your pants, facial expressions.

Mikey: I want some cheese.
Frank: I want a poptart.
Ray: -Walks in with a plate of poptarts and hands them to Frank- Here you go.
Frank: -Squeals and licks his lips.- Thank you.
Ray thinks this is hot, and cute, so he sits down before he pounces the other guitarist.
Mikey gets up, looks in the mirror, hanging on the wall, winks at himself, and walks out of the house.
Gerard: ... Where's he going?
Ray: -Trying not to pounce Frank, still.- I dunno, probably needs some fresh air.
Gerard: -Nods, then notices all of the poptarts.- What, do we have a whole pantry of those things?
Bob: -Nods, taking a bit of one.- Actually... we do.
Ray laughs at the look on Gerard's face.
Frank is busy stuffing his face.
Gerard: Oooookay...
Frank: -Puts the plate down, still with two poptarts on top. He ate the other two.- Raaaaaaay.
Ray: -Blinks and gulps.- Yeah?
Frank: -Giggles- I love you!!! -Pounces Ray and kisses him.-

I joined gaia. I made a post on Xanga. 
...And poems keeping popping out of nowhere....



I'm your hopeless dream in a bottle.
You tuck me far away.
Never to be seen or heard.
Like a dirty dream, you don't want me to be found out.
Can't you let me out, even for a little while? 
Show me to the world, but no, you're ashamed.
Of me, you are.
What is so wrong?
In this world, there's only you and I.
Let me out, and see.
We're one of a kind, two people in love.
Who could become one.
Me, your hopeless dream. 
Stuck, so lonley in this bottle.
Let me out, and love me.

..........It stinks........

Oh, one of my old poems! Lookie!!

Take me into your arms.
Let me bleed there.
Hold me untill I die.
Maybe you could save me.
Or maybe you'll see my last breath.
Bleeding rose red.
Hold me tight.
Don't let me go.
Watch me silently as I began to go.
Don't cry.
Don't worry.
This pain is almost numb.
Bleeding rose red. 
Take me into your arms.
Don't let go.
Say goodbye to me, if you wish.
Bleeding...
You were oh so sweet.
Kiss me once more.
Rose...
I can't think now. 
I think my end is near.
Red...



o_o
I want some pretzels.

Hm.

Bye.
Love you all, - Jen <3 lurve."

"event","I want to write something pretty.
Beautiful, and pure. 
Breath-taking and original.
Something true and real. 
Something amazing and gasp-like!
Why?
'Cause I want to.



Here it goes.

Try Number One...


Slice her beautiful features in your next original act. 
Take her down with you, in your hopeless everythings.
Fake her a make-believe world.
Show her all pretty dreams, that you'll never make come true.
Make her smile when you tell her all of those lies.
Give her your pretty promises, that you'll break.
Things you never had intentions of following through with.
Hold her in your arms, lovingly.
Make her think that she's your everything.
She could use the ego-booster.
Drop her like a pen on a busy forgotten sidewalk.
Break her like you intented to.
You can make her cry. 
But she'd still love you a thousand times, over and over again.
Tell her you're sorry. 
Watch her run back to you, with a saddened smile upon her face.
Let her know, not to be scared. 
Let her believe it won't happen again.
You didn't mean to, you know it's a lie.
Wisper sweet nothings in her ear.
Make her feel real, when she's just your human puppet.
Something, when you get bored of, can just toss aside.
Don't let her know you found another.
She'll fall and break.
Make her feel special. 
Cover her in pretty jewels.
Didn't you know, you can't buy a brokenhearted girl's love?
She knows. She doesn't want to believe.
She can see you two in the middle of the night.
Dancing, together as one. In the shiney moonlight.
She cries, and hates you. But she can't let go, she loves you.
She wants to leave, and she will soon.
You'll realize too late, she was your everything.
She doesn't want to admit, that you made her feel so many things.
She sees you, and she can't stop from calling out.
She whispers, and cries. Falls and breaks.
This kills you, yet you don't know why.
Wasn't she just a childsplay?
She kills you with the tears.
You don't know what to do.
She shakes her head, glaring through teary eyes at the other girl.
She wants to know why.
You can't tell her. You don't know why.
She turns to go. You can't stand to look.
But you stop her, you plead. You cry, and fall.
She wants to know why, a good reason to stay and listen any longer. 
She can't bare one more lie.
You don't know. Is it good enough.
Will she buy it? It's the truth this time, and you know it.
You love her, and hold her dearly. It just took you forever to see.
You spill it all to her, like a song, she's waited forever to hear.
She slowly smiles, but how can things be this perfect?
The other girl leaves, without a glance back.
You stand and take her in your arms.
This time, you smile and mean every word you say, and whisper in her ear.
When she looks at you with questioning eyes, you read and see.
In a gentle voice, you answer the un-asked question.
It's love.



Dun dun dun. Does it suck? Is it good? Am I a complete weirdo for writing it? Do I just need to give up on writing poems, or what?

I shall try Try Number Two, later-like.


I'm going to be in a wedding on the seventeenth.
I don't want to be.
I have to wear a poofey-white-dress.
Save me?

Please!

.... Yeah, so. I'm writing a fic. Where Frank had to go to jail.
He's scruffy.
YUMMY!

........
Anyways. I'll type it out soon. Or something.

I want something sweet.

Today, was okay.
Boring.
Lame.
Tiring.

Boy, I complain alot.
About boredom.

Oho. I could just say.
My day was shitty.
End of story.


But it wasn't all that shitty.
KATRINA CAME BACK! 
And I was like woah.
And she was like woah.
And Ash was like woah.
Not really. But something like that.
And she had a red drink, that looked like red-wine.
Ash and I stole it... somewhat.


My second period teacher.
Is so damn stupid.
I swear.
God.
But weird, too.
She wants to be gangsta.
Yeah, go figure.
And all I can do is act along when she comes to me, being stupid, and laugh, like I'm laughing with her.
She's got another thing coming. 
I just want to yell,
""I'm laughing at you, STUPIDASS. Not WITH you!""

Yeah, mean. I know.
But God, you try being in her class.
RoLlInG oN tHe FlOoR lAuGhInG...


I'm going over to Ashley's for a little tomorrow.
Help her with her LJ.
Yeah, 'cause I'm cool like that.
Bizzzzzies.


I said Shiznitch in class.
It was funny.

Mr. Ray likes my hoodie.
And is secretly trying to steal it.
Yes. 
He is.
I know.
I know all. 
Really...


I'm bored.
And blabbing.
Ramble.

....Tasa is suppose to comment.
Yes, she is.
If she doesn't.
Then, like.
Yeah, she's mean.


I'm going to end this for now.
 Bye.

Love you all.
Pansies.


Love, -JEN!!!! (Hey! That's me!)...."

Okaies....


So you woke up, and everything was black. 
You've lost your place. 
Under the staryless skies, that you've always plead.
You want to stop the pain.
But it keeps cutting into you.
Like a razor, innocently hanging out of your hands.
Lifeless? No, not yet.
We're not quite there. Hang on though.
You wanted so much more for yourself.
A life, perhaps a good time. Some cheer, a smile or few.
You've lost yourself in the crowded streets of lonliness.
Goodnight, and goodbye. Say it to, all of the things you've ever loved.
You're not coming back. 
Your petty pleas. Your salty tears. 
I don't want to see it. 
Falling, into your bittersweet ending. 
I'll tell you goodbye, one last time.
Look into those gemless eyes, once more.
You've lost your place.
Take it. Take it.
Your last ragged breath.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
I'll hold you, one last time, as you say your own final goodbyes.


Yeah, that.. came out of nowhere. Wowie.
Anyone wanna give me a bunch of money for gas? To go somewheres...
Don't ask why, pansies, just do it. :D

Haha, you're all lovely pansies?.. >_>



ColdPlay = Awesome.
Yeah.


Mikey Way has some beautiful fucking hands. Dear God.

Don't ask?
Don't tell.
Don't say a WORD.

...Word...
Hiccup.


No one cares. 
Not about it at all.
She doesn't love you.
He doesn't want it.
The love has been driven away.
Give me your hands, we can get out of here.
Before we're ruined, and trashed. Like a thousand unwanted love stories.
I can see you in the corner. You wanted it just as much as I did.
You're sitting, looking pretty.
With a innocent smile. 
A burning fire. A lifeless charm.
Make me fall into your neverending sayings.
Will you remember the times, that we once shared?
You're my own storybook. 
I know I have you. You know you have me.
One more time. 
Can you be my everything.
My little piece of sanity, that I'll always tightly cling to?
Driven out, and away.
We're strong, and make it through the blast.
They're trying to trash us, like a cheap t.v. daytime-drama.
Hold me tight. And never let me go. Maybe I can be your last little piece of sanity.


That just hit me too...

It all probably sucks though.. >_> I dunno, you guys tell me.


Weeeeeeee.
Bye.
Love you all.

It goes...

Bert McCracken.
Berty Bert.
You have a crack.
Perhaps you sometimes like to do crack.
For I do not know, because I'm never around you.
Bert McCracken.
You're a pretty one.
With a crack.
Bert McCracken.
Tell me please, why am I obsessed with your name, and the word crack.
It makes me giggle. Not quite like you. Your giggle is almost imposible to imitate.
Bert McCracken.
Tell me, where are you?
And where is that crack, I know you know!
Bert McCracken, who has a pretty crack, though I do not know. I've never seen it.
Only Branden's crack.
Nyaha...


Yeah. Random. Boredom. Don't ask.

Would you marry me?
If I told you, that you have a nice crack?...


OKAY. ENOUGH.

-Giggles- Crack is a funny word. Heh. Heh.
Okay, seriously. Done.

Sooooo lately. Yeah, wonderful. I don't want to talk about my life lately. I probably seem like a ranting person, which I shall tell you, is true. I do rant and blab. It's quite fun, also.

Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii know something you don't know.

You are never coming home.
That, my friend. Is depressing.

It's fine, I guess. I'm making good grades, and I haven't killed myself yet. So yep. All is good.

Well, the other night I was talking to Cat. About My Chemical Romance.
The talk got to me.
Alot of things have been getting to me, lately. 
I don't understand why.
I think alot about, ""What If?"".
My what if's aren't going to be answered. So I wonder why I constantly think about it.
Anyways...

Back to the conversation.

I adore My Chemical Romance.
Not because they're hot as hell. No, not just because of that.
They are awesome people. Who are entergetic. Good people. They're music is beautiful. They're lyrics are bittersweet. I really love them and they're amazing. They've touched me, in ways other bands can't. There's been a few, close to what they do. Like The Used. Or some other bands. But My Chemical Romance, they're brilliant. And they're beautiful. Inside and out. During our talk, I'd started crying. Pathetic, I know. But, I mean, they're just so.. Gah, there's no words.
I have a to-do-list.
Meeting them and telling them, just how much they mean to me, and how much they've changed some of my thoughts and views on life, and such, is on it.
I'm obsessed with them. I admit. It's not healthy. But I love them, and they really do help me through hard times. As corny as it sounds.

Yeah, so. Anyways.

I'd like to thank the following people. Just for being there, when I need them.

Candice, Cat, Ashley, Katrina, Courtney, Natasa, Shawn, Shelly, Nex, Daven, Tim, Jacki, Kayla, Michell, Jason, Anita, Mick, Britness-Fudge, Ryan, RaRa, Christina, Dan, Daniel, Amber, Tony, Michele, Johnny, Erica, Stacy,  Ali, Ash, Josh, Elly, Brandon, Kevin, Corey, Cody, Jake, Kris, Joe, Mandy, Kyle, Jasmine, Britney, Justy, Cec, Cons, and I think that's it. If I forgot anyone, I'm sorry.

So yeah, that's what mood I'm in. Thinking all the time. I still have a cold. I think it's from the lack of rest and such. Hm, oh well. 

School. Well, is fine. Good grades and what-not. Boring, though. I'm in all advanced classes, and yet, I still am bored. Work's too easy. >_<

Aaah, I'm gonna end this. So yeah. Bye! Love you all!

Oooh. Wait.. Random lyric time!

'Cause she's bittersweet, she knocks me off of my feet. And I can't help myself. I don't want anyone else. She's a mystery. She's too much for me. But I keep comin' back for more. She's just the girl I'm lookin' for.

Yesterday was hell. But today I'm fine without you. Runaway this time without you. And all I ever thought you'd be. That face is tearing holes in me again. 

And all the wonds that are ever gonna scar me. For all the ghosts that are never gonna catch me. If I fall. If I fall (Down). At the end of the world. Or the last thing I see. You are. Never coming home. Never coming home..


Done.. For now... tomorrow, I shall post more, I think. Hehe."

Steal. I find out. I kill you with my bare hands.
I do not joke around with my writing.


No, I'm not alright. I haven't had the time to be alright. I can't think. I've gone insane. Lost in pain. Drenched in your blood. The moment you walked in, I'd turn to dust. A fragment from the little memories you held.
You thought it was a game. My game. I believe this is real. I let it get to far. All of it. My emotions got the best of me. Where have you gone, my sweet love? Where have you gone? As I stand here, I wonder. What might have been. If you hadn't.. But you did. If I didn't, and gave you your last chance, but I did it. Went on, with my little devious plans.  I can't deny it any longer. Can't turn away. Or pretend. Nor can I say that you do not still have apart of me. Falling away. Inside, I can't stop the pain. Outside, I'm just fine. Like it never happened. It doesn't show. I can stand here, with your blood all over me. And smile, a sweet smile. I can look down into your pale face. You're dead, and I know it. It gives me a happy, yet sad feeling. I can look into those eyes. The ones I use to fall into. Endlessly. I can see through you. Your soul, it is open to me, as a book. A book that I can read. But, now is no use. For you are dead. And I killed you. Yes, I can smile, and proudly say I did this to you. Took your life, greetidly. No, I'm not ashamed. Not scared of what will happen. I think you deserved it, you and I both know. After all you put me through. You, us. As a whole. We had to deal with your actions. The good and the bad. The part that you still hold, deep within me, is twisting. To an end, it shall come. It won't be there any longer. I won't care. I'll be better. Even happier, knowning I did it. For me. Yes, and even for you. I've had my little bit of closure, now I can walk away, as I am doing now, and never look back. You're gone. Forever. Never to return. I turn on my heels, still covered with your blood, with a sick smile. Something close to a smirk on my face, and walk away. Knowing that, finally, I'll be okay.


Yeah, that's one...


I can see you on the other side.
Smiling, like you've done no harm.
I'm stuck behind this glass.

I see my life.
Ahead of me.
Behind me. 

I'm acting this part out.
I'm not real.
It's not real.
...It's all a fake.
This isn't the real me.

In this play.
This act for two.

On this lonely road.
Going nowhere.

I have to watch you abuse me.
Could you just stop it?
You take me for granted.
You use me.

I'm stuck..
I can't change it either..
I let you do this to me.


There's another...

Tell me, my love. Where did we go wrong? 
How did it get this way? What happened? Could you tell me? 
Answer one of these questions, if you will.
Don't just sit there, and stare. It's making me uneasy. 
I can't concentrate. Think, you're invading me. 
How did you do this? Take every little part of me. 
Then you'd kill me. Kill me well. Bleed, and cry. 
Scream, and plead. You did these things to me.
I hadn't noticed the wrong turn that we took.
How we got this way, is a mystery to me.
It's an everyday thing. Same thing. Everytime.
I didn't notice the dirty looks of discust, you'd throw at me, out of the corner of your eyes.
Take a chance, if you dare.
Tell me you care.. if you really mean it.
Time and time again, you'd deny it.
Alone, into the dark, you would love me, and hold me.
So tell me love when to strike, tell me love, so it's how you like. 
So tell me love, when to crack your ribs and make things right.

Tell me, my love.
Have you noticed? 
At all..how I'm slowly being ripped and torn to small pieces.
Can you see my tear-stained face?
Like a knife, like the blade.
That you hold. Constantly slicing through my heart.
Can you hear my loudest cries?
They're all the quiet ones.
With the pretty little silent sobs.
Have you noticed, the forced smiles?
The smiles I show, with the watery tears.
Threatening to fall, and ruin my act. 
Do you see my lies?
That I tell. To keep everything in control.
Except for myself. I fall.
I fall hard. To the ground.
Like a raindrop, from the gray skies.
Do you see it?

Tell me, my love.
Do you care?
As you walk by, do you stop.
Stop to see if I'm okay?
Crying on the floor. 
Laying there, waiting to be held.
How could you just step over me?
As if I'm nothing at all.
Can you see it in my eyes?
All of the pain, that you've caused me.

Tell me, my love.
Do you see this knife in my hand?
Can you step over my body, covered in blood.
As my breath, slowly fades away.
Can you see inside of me?
My eyes. They show you, my soul.
My soul, that is being torn.
Torn into little pieces.
Ripped. Demolished. Like it was nothing.
Nothing at all.
Like it's not apart of me.
No, I don't mind.

Tell me, my love.
Can you take me by the hand?
Hold me close, as we see our last moments.
Can you kiss me, a true kiss.
So deep, and pure. 
Something real, and true.
Under this stary sky.
Would you tell me a lie?
Even if you hate me.
Sweetly tell me, that you love me.

Tell me, my love.
Can you kill me?
Could you truely, take my life.

Tell me, my love.
Deep inside, could you admit your secrets.
The ones you lock deep within yourself.
The things that you hide away...
But I know about..

Tell me, my love. 
Could you ever love me, again? 
The way you use to. With the secret kisses. 
Beautiful smiles. 
Could you hold me the way you use to?
The way we felt. Fit together.
So perfect.
What happened?
Could we become one again?
Like we use to be...

Tell me, my love.
Tell me all of these things.


And that's it for now. I'd like to thank Cat on the last one. She helped me out with two lines. Thankies, Cat.

That's all for now.
Bye.

Oh, Mick. I need to talk to you, soon. About the layout-thing.."

Eh, I'm a bit glad the weekend is coming to an end. Even if I do get piled with work at school. At least I have something to do, and my mind can't wonder...

My mind never stops thinking.

Never shuts down.

Nope, no one cares if you're losing yourself. Not at all. The world is one cold place. It's not as happy and joyful as I use to think it was. I miss when I was in my pretend little world. Where everything was perfect...

So unlike now.

They suck. Really. I have bad ones. Where I kill myself.

I still haven't seen the video. -Pouts.- And I want to see it oh so badly. 

My Chemical Romance <3 I really love them. I know this sounds really, well, I dunno. But they do help. They're lyrics are beautiful and make you (Me..Dunno about others..), mesmorized. They're wonderful musicians. Really.. I'm not trying to sound weird or something. It's true.

Yep. She said she's an old lady.

-Yawns- I appear to be sleepy too..

I read this book yesterday. It was a really good book. I think I fell in love with this book.

It's called, ""Keeping You A Secret."".

It's about this girl who's just realizing she's a lesbian. She finds this wonderful girl who she loves. But she has a boyfriend and has to break it off with him. He turns against her, as does some of her friends. Her mom finds out, and kicks her out. She's only in highschool. She's trying to make it, and she feels lonley without her girlfriend... 

I don't want to give it all away. >_> If someone decides to read it. 

It's really interesting though.

G U N   I T   W H I L E   I ' M   H O L D I N G   O N.

I want to fall. Off a cliff. With something at the bottom though. I'm just wondering what it'd feel like. If it's like you're flying or something.

"event","Daaah.. This is the same post as Xanga and myspace. Yep yep.
Here ya' go then..

Well, I just got back from St. Augustine. I have one hell of a headache too! I had fun though. It was pretty cool. We went to Potter's Wax Museum. There was maaaaaany things there. I saw Jar Jar Binks. I thought that was kickass. Uuh, I saw some old wax people. Like old presidents and stuff. OH! I saw Bush, yep. Wax-Bush. I flicked him off. Many times. God, I hate Bush, that idiot. Anyways. There was Darth Vader, Brad Pitt..who didn't look like Brad Pitt, Anakin Skywalker, C3po, R2D2, uh, Hitler, Freddie Cauger (Spelling?), yeah.. he looked so real, and it was freaky. There was also Frankienstien... Bunches of stuff. It was awesome though. O_o And I should have some pictures later on this week from it. 

Then we went to two art gallaries. I found a few paintings I want. But, I shall never get them for I am poor. Which sucks. There was one I really wanted but it was like... Thirteen thousand and something dollars. I wonder what my dad would do if I told him that I wanted that paitning. Hmm, probably laugh at me and tell me to get a job. Which doesn't exactly sound like a bad idea. But, I'd rather not get a job right now. I can get one later. Annnyways.

We then went to some gift shops and got some stuff, looked around. I got this frog thing, and some incense stuff. It smells good! Then we went to Lightner Museum. It had old stuff, and .. stuff. Haha, Well, there was this one mummy thing. Which was funny, I stood behind the wall, and scared the shit out of Ash when she came around. Uuh, then we went around, dodging and stuff, as if we were FBI people or something. We got some weird looks, but we didn't care. Lol. Then in one room there was a bench and some old stuff to the side of the room, (Like coins and stuff), there was slow music playing so we started doing the Waltz. These people came in the middle and was clapping for us! Hah! Yeah, then we went to the old ballroom. We danced there too. There was this guy who kept staring at us, It was freaky, then when we left, he followed. I thought we were in a bad horror film. But then again, I've thought I was in a bad horror film before...

Then we just walked around some, enjoyed it out there. It was fun.We took pictures.. which, again, I sould have some soon. Uuh, then we left. Went to Stake And Shake. I fell asleep waiting for someone to bring us menus. I was tired and had a bad headache, which I still have. Uh, we all ordered chicken fingers. Except for someone who ordered chilli, I don't remember who. But, those chicken fingers were good. With french fries, root beer and coleslaw. Yep, it was good. Then I stole a little bit of Kat's milkshake. Like a few sips. Then I put chicken in it, and she drank it. I tried to put some in Ashley's buuuuut, she said, ""ew"".. So yeah. The rest of my friends just shook their heads when I went to put it in their milkshakes. Oh! I just realized, I was the only one without a milkshake! HAH! Go me!..Yeah so.

On the way home, we went through a bad storm. And I got used as a pillow. So I barely got any sleep on the way home. But halfway home, I layed over Kat, Ash, and Shawn while saying, ""Sleepy sleepy sleepy"", they just laughed and let me sleep. Oh, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge was in the cd player, all the way there, and all the way back. Which annoyed the shit out of some of my friends who love rap and hate rock and stuff. Buuut, us rock lovers won. Like always. Not like I asked it to stay in there though. 'Cause now I have a bunch of MCR songs floating around in my head.

Well, I think I'm gonna end this now. buh-byes. <3 -Jen"

But certain people are always there to pick me up. Or catch me before I hit the ground. It's nice knowing.. that no matter how bad life gets, I've got people who are there for me. Who actually care. Yeah, I might of had a bad childhood.. but I'm finally finding reasons to be happy.


Well, anyways... Enough with that.. I'm getting up at six.. to go to the mall. Ack it shall be hell. I'm trying to think of some stuff for HBP. but not having sleep for three days, is making it hard. Annnnnnnyways.. yeah.. bye."

I went and seen The Sisterhood of Traveling pants yesterday with some friends. I cried alot. :( -Sniffs- Oh well, I'm allowed to cry. We played hide and seek in the mall, and and and got chased by a obese security guard. Fun! I've gotta go now into HP1 before Court kicks my ass for not being in there. I love my friends!"

I've YET to work on my Xanga site. -Shoots an evil glare at her 'nice' brother-. I started on my Gee/Bert. With the help of Candice :D <3 <3

"event","Okay, so the vibe was wrong. Sunday sucked alot. It really, really sucked. God, I want to give up sometimes. I really do. Everything seemed to go wrong. So wrong. I had a emotional break down/Anxiety attack yesterday, go me. My stepmother is giving me a hard time too. I feel really lonely, sad, depressed, and lost. I probably sound all emo and shit right now, oh well. This guy I'm in love with, he's really a mystery to me. I don't think he even loves me. He says he does, but sometimes he sure and hell doesn't act it. Time shall tell, I suppose. I feel pathetic. Anyways, on to a non-depressing matter. I'm STILL thinking of writing that Gerard Way/ Bert McCracken slash. It'd be cool. Also, I am still working on my Xanga site. I'm STILL hopeing it'll kick ass in the end. I'm hungry..well, that was random. I'll also write an entry later today. I just had to write some stuff now. Oh.. my friend Michele (Mich), got me to join this Doll War thing. It's cool and all, except I need tons of gold. (To Buy clothes...). I'll put the link later on today. (In hopes you guys will help me!). All you've got to do is click the link and it gives meh gold. Muwahahahahaha. Ah, music. It calms me. I feel kinda better. If only I could sleep, then I'd feel really better. Damn insomnia! Damn it to hell! Hmmm. I'll write more later today. Bye!"

"event","Well, I think today will be a better day, than yesterday. Which that coming from me is very odd, because I hate Sunday's and I think that I'm cursed on this day. I just have a vibe that today will be okay. For once. I went to the movies last night with some friends. The movie was awesome, kinda sad at the end though. (We saw Lords Of Dogtown. Yay! I finally got to see it.). I'm awaiting the day when the sixth book for Harry Potter comes out, mind you, the days are slowly passing. But yeah, last night was cool, we all went out and had some fun. Then my friend brought up this idea to go to this club, but I was so tired already. So, I guess we'll go out next weekend or something. Club? Me? I'm so innocent. Really. Oh! I so can not wait untill The new Willy Wonka comes out, it's going to be so kickass because of Johnny Depp. 
-Grin, drool, grin-. It comes out, July fifteenth I think. (The day before HBP comes out!) Wow, I'll be at the mall alot in July. Too many good movies are coming out. Also coming up in exactlly ten days, is my birthday. Yay, or boo? I'm not so sure if I'm happy about turning sixteen. It means I'm getting old. And that I have to always act all grown up- like. I can be serious, but I like to laugh and have a good time. Ah, anyways. Status on my Xanga site: Still working on it. My nice-smart-computer-personage-brother, is gonna help me on it. Bwahahaha. I'm listening to The Used..again. I don't really have anything planned for today, except to be lazy.. oh and a family dinner type thing we have every Sunday. (See why I hate Sundays?). I love my family and all.. but.. Yeah. And about the Gerard/Bert slash I'm still thinking of writing it...so.. Anyways, enough blabbing for now, I'll write tomorrow. Bye!"

"event","Well, today has been a bust and it's only noon. I was suppose to go get my hair streaked and those plans fell through. I really wanna write a Gerard Way/Bert McCracken slash, but I'm not sure if I'd do so great on it. Ah, well this is my first journal entry. Last night was totally horrible, I kept crying because of a guy. So now I have a stuffy nose. I really do not know what I'm suppose to write, lol.. so I'll just blabber, something I'm good at. I'm working on an Xanga site. I'm totally hopeing when I'm done with it that it'll kick ass. I'm listening to Bert sing as I type. -Sighs.- Okay, enough of me being a dork. I think I did something to my hand, because it really hurts. I'm suppose to be going to see Lords Of Dogtown tonight. (I really hope that plan does not fall through.) It better be a good movie.. well, I think I'm going to get on yahoo now and see if anyone I know is on. Ta-ta."

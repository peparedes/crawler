"event","So this was my first weekend off in three weeks, and I was super excited about it.  Richie's parents called him on Friday to ask if they could come over on Saturday or Sunday with their friends from CT for a barbecue.  Richie explained to his parents that we were way too busy this weekend and that we could not have anyone over this weekend.  We are having a barbecue on September 10th which they are coming to, and that is just two weeks away.  Richie's parents called us all weekend long...they called Richie's cell phone like 5 times on Saturday plus our house phone...we just didn't pick up.  Then on SUnday morning they called again early and left another message on our house phone, and then called my cell phone!  I was so mad...I mean we already explained that we were doing work on our house, and could not have people over.  Richie went upstairs to work, and I was cleaning downstairs...the phone rang again.  I answered this time...I was so very mad.  It was the son of the people that were staying with Richie's parents...he said ""Chrissy...this is Keith...can we come over around 1 for a barbecue?""  I said ""no.""  Then I got Richie and told him that he needed to talk to his family...his Dad got on the phone and talked to Richie and asked him again if they could come over.  They are just crazy."

It touched upon suicide, death of a child, and a high school girl losing her virginity to a college kid.  I was thinking that it didn't seem appropriate that movie was rated PG, but then again maybe younger kids would be unable to understand what was taking place in the movie since you don't actually see anyone dying or anyone having sex."

Everyone there knew all about my house hunting, job, and apparently my mother tells everyone I make a lot of money.  The thing about the house hunting...is basically I am completely exhausted of looking at houses...I think we may just decide to rent for another year.  So then I have to tell all these people the same story of how we have looked at houses upon houses and have not found anything yet...and yada yada yada.

I told him that first of all I found it strange that he found anyone to be hitting on him either male or female was scary, and secondly that a gay man would not be interested in him.  He is completely uncultured, and he is lucky that I was interested in him!  Ha ha ha.  Anyways once I talked to him about this he seemed releived, and once we got there he was fine.

My old roommate from college Trina emailed me this week.  I had not spoken to her since she declined the invitation to my wedding.

She emailed me to tell me that her father had died last week, and when she came to Boston to take care of things she went to her parents' house.  While she was there she went through some things that she had stored away and found a bunch of stuff from college, and stuff from when we were even younger.  So she sent me an email.  I told her that I was sorry for her father, and also sorry that I had been so upset with her. I am sorry that I was so upset with her....I guess I was just very disapointed that she didn't feel that it was important enough to make time for.  I guess I am still somewhat upset or disapointed or whatever.

I just can't believe that after the church through him out when he got divorced that he still can feel such an obligation."

"event","I have never been to Vermont before.  I am thinking about taking a few days off from work to go there.  It isn't far from Boston.  I really want to take like a really good tropical vacation, but of course Richie and I are saving so we probably should not be spending a lot of money on a trip.  I really dislike saving.  I see so many things that I want, and I don't buy them.  That makes me sad.  I did buy some new socks yesterday at Target.  I splurged because they were Valentines socks...and I love Valentines.  Everything is pink and pretty for Valentines Day.  My Granddad always buys me a heart filled with chocolates."

"event","So I am still in negotiations with the house.  That I don't even want to think about.  This week I have been ridiculously busy with work, and yet absolutely unproductive.  I feel as though I bang my head against the wall all day.  Each day I leave the office I feel more and more useless.  I think I am going to go to my Granddad's house tomorrow night.  He loves me."

"event","I had dinner with my parents last night.  I took them out to dinner.  This was the first time they have ever let me take them to dinner.  We went to the Hardcover.  It was very delicious.  My mother was laid off from her job a couple of weeks ago.  I find it strange to think of my Mother going on job interviews.  She is old...well 50...and I imagine not many people would want to hire her because of her age.  

Christmas is almost here.  It is as if the entire holiday season passed by me.  I don't feel in the ""spirit.""  I didn't even enjoy buying presents.  I feel as though Christmas is more of a hassle than it is something to be enjoyed.  Perhaps it is because of the whirlwind year I had.  The whole marriage thing and the signing on with a new brokerage...these events were tremendously significant, and life changing.  

I almost have my hands on the account I want.  I want it so bad I can taste it.  I think it is only a matter of time before I get it.  I have been discreetly working on it for a long time."

"event","I am so tired right now.  I ate five donuts this morning because I was challeneged by a coworker.  He thought that I wouldn't be able to eat four donuts in one sitting.  I certainly proved him wrong.  Now I have come down from my sugar high, and I am ready for a nap.  However, I am at my office...so I am not going to get a nap.  

Christmas is coming so soon, and I am not prepared.  I also am not in the holiday spirit.  Some badass kid stole my credit information and charged up a storm!  That really made me angry.  Also since Richie has told his family that I do not like them I am assuming that spending time with them will be awkward."

"event","Well California was great.  I had an incredible time.  I felt like I did when I was in college.  So much fun. I came back, and then went to DC...which wasn't even close to the amount of fun I had in California.  I did get to see many interesting things.  I also had some really delicious Mexican food.  I couldn't wait to get back to the office though.  It is nice to be back."

"event","Last night I met this guy at a bar in Newton.  He was from South Dakota, and he was very boring.  He was also sweating profusely.  I talked with him for what seemed like an eternity.  All he was talking about was Wal-Mart, and using all of their flashy buzz words.  I hate talking to boring people.  It seems as though I am forced to talk to dull people more than I should.  Anyways...I broke free, and mingled with some more interesting folks.  I hate when it is business, business, business...I mean I know that when I go out with those in my industry that the topic will come up, but goodness don't these people have lives outside of the office?  I was thinking about that as I drove home last night.  Then I thought about how many hours I put in at the office, and all the client dinners, trips and events.  I am on heading straight on a path of dullness.  I will become of those people discussing at great lengths the cherry market, or projecting the success of the ""grapple."" I will start analyzing diesel fuel prices in my spare time, and researching loop holes in the DOT regulations.  I am hoping I can be saved before it comes to that.   Perhaps if I make myself do one interesting thing a week...."

"event","Do you ever wonder why old people feel like they need to hang onto everything?  I think it is very sad.  I was cleaning up my Grandad's today and there was so much old stuff!  Expired, expired coupons, old mail....just scattered about.  He doesn't want to let go of any of it.  I had to throw some stuff away, and I felt bad about it.  

Today was busy at work, and I was quite happy about that.  Lulls are not comfortable.  Tomorrow I have a dinner thing that I need to go to, and I was dared by some people in my office to wear my bunny costume.  I am not going to do it, but I did contemplate it.  It would be so funny to see all those people in their business suits, and I would walk in dressed as a bunny.  Ha ha ha.  We were talking about the movie legally blonde...and how she is tricked into thinking it was a costume party.  Anyways...I will leave my bunny suit at home for now."

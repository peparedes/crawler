"event","hey. well yea on friday i went to dolphin, only the people that said they would go didnt, and then the one person that i knew was going kind of sold me out, so yea in pure crisis and lonliness, i called kris- told him i was stranded, and it turns out he was in dolphin anyways with arturo rodrigo and aldo and felix, but drigo felix and aldo were in a movie which the assholes didnt let me into, especially scince it was the manager looking at the id's to get into the movie. so i went outside returned the tickets and stayed by the ddr machine allll night talking to kris melanie and arturo and i talked to herrera a little bit and luis e. and some other people... 
and last night kris came to my house to watch the rest of eurotrip and to get his belt(drigo gave me felix and kris a ride home on friday after dlophin and kris forgot the belt that betty gave him back in the car so he asked me to bring it in my house) so yea he came over and after watching the rest of eurotrip and watching all of perfect score (awesome)""do i look like i need the answers?"", "" i think you need a pyimp:wink::lick lip:"" me and kris were bored so he had been saying he wanted a haircut and he was getting one soon and i was getting ready for dolphin and doing my hair, so we decided to give him a haircut, so of course i gave him a hair cut and it came out pretty good.

"event","well i didnt post yesterday but it was a normal day, wake up at crack of dawn, go to work with ryan, his 2 brothers, and his brothers girlfriend, get home, eat, go to dance, get home, eat, talk to ryan,and do stuff i havnt done yet, and then sleep.
ok, on wednesday for some unknown reason i had this ear ache and it hurt A LOT. so w/e i thought it was an earache and it would go away-scince i was born ive had ear problems,sort of runs in the family- well it didnt stop, and last night it got so  bad i just started crying in my bed in the middle of the night because of the pain and this morning when i woke up i didnt go with ryan to work because the messeger service at the doctor building thing said the doctor gets in at 9:00 so seeing that shes a doctor and she can do w/e her <3 desires, i went in at about 9:30 and they told me:
:: My mom an i walk in::
::mom knocks on little window thing::
nurse-what are you doing here?
mom-well chelsea has an ear ache the daocotr is supposed to come at 9 i was told
nurse-hahahahah-no she comes in at 1:30
mom-::ready to kill::....ok....well come back then
::leaves the room::
so yea i completly wasted my time and lost work hours =/ if you havnt noticed im always eager to go to work :
1.because the more hours duh! the more $$money$$ 
2.because work is fun i use all these cool machines and stuff
and 3. im with ryan and i get extra points with the parents[;)]for helping out - OH YEYYY-YAAA!!!!lol
well yea i chose to stay at work the rest of the day so i wouldnt miss more hours, i ended going to the last appointment- turns out i have an ear infection, and i have to take these pills the size of horse tranquilizers, its lyk a big peice of chalk in my mouth,and i have to take 2 of the every 12 hours, then i need these ear drops, 5 drops avery 5 hours, then i have motrin- 2 orange happy pills an hour before i dance, so my head doesnt split in half because of a head ache, from all the motion and loud music pounding on my head=/
today when i went to dance i was COMPLETLY drugged i was sooooo o.d.'ed lmfao

Let me inform you of a little thing ryan does which i hate, he completely and totally disreguardes the fact that i cuban and always fashionably late(lol). He sometimes is a very punctual person but thats only good SOMEtimes...And hes always lecturing me and getting mad when i say ill be there at 1:00 and i get there at 1:20 or something like that.If i remember correctly i think it was last tuesday that he told me that he would ask if i could go 2 zip with him(where his parents work-he works there too), i hadnt gotten an answer from him if i could go or not till last night at about 12:30- 1:00 am therefore i had no clue and was still up,even though i had to wake up at 7:15am. he said he would be at my house to pick me up at 8:00am so im up my moms rushing me(no reason at all) and i drank my tea calmly and my pop-tart (not pop-tartS because i made 2 but saved 1 for him-yes awww w.e)i even had time to put on perfume and do my hair! i looked at the clock it said 8:06am so i decided victory was mine and i could bother him the rest of the day that he was late and that i win and he should die lol jk but as i was waiting for my moment of victory they clock started to laugh in my face by saying 8:24am so i called his phone countless amount of times-no answer- so i called his brothers phone:
me: hey ray,ryans being an idiot he wont answer his phone,where are you guys?
ray:um...ryans asleep.
me: ::conjuring death plan::what?!?!?!
ray:yup hes asleep...
me:WAKE HIM UP!!!
ray: ::screams:: ""ryan wake-up""
me: HIT HIM!!! I DONT CARE WAKE HIM UP SAY IT WAS ME!!!!
ray: ok ill tell him to call you

phone: ''click''

"event","my brohter tried to make me look bad in his LJ but i got him 2 this was his story:
 
   I hate my family sometimes, they can be really stupid sometimes. Im normally a very calm person right? So today I was listening, downloading, and organizing music, just like yesterday. Danny, my neighbor comes over for like, half an hour, then goes home, and my sister went to the computer like 5 minutes before he left, and she's a control freak, so naturally, she tried to take over, like always, and she put her music on, I was okay with that, I was on my computer, she was on hers, she had her music on, and I turned on mine, very very low I might add, and she wouldnt have it. She told me to put on headphones on, and I didnt want to, cause headphones are annoying. So I said no a few times, eventually my dad got involved like he always does, and he said the same thing-""put on head phones."" So I said ""give me head phones and I'll gladly put them on."" He said that they were inside the closet, and Im like, wtf?! where inside the closet, its a big closet and im not about to look for something I dont even really want in the first place, am I right? So eventually I gave in and said whatever, I'll put on the headphones, but my sister kept turning off the speakers and I told her not to, and she kept on turning them off, so I went, and pushed her hand away to turn them on again, and she pushed me away and started to punch hit and scratch me, I didnt hit her back, I only pushed her back in order to prevent any further pain on my part. We both go to the council of elders (the parents), she told them her side, ""He breathed fire and tried to burn me, then he started shooting me with arrows, then he hit me, then he burned my room, and killed all my friends, wait. I have no friends, well he breathed fire all over my new clothes, now I have to go out with you mom, and drag matt along like always and take 5 hours to pick out one shirt."" Yeah, she likes to exadurate..Anyway, I got a bit angry at them because they gave me shit for something that wasnt my fault, then they grounded me for today and tomorrow, I tried to bargain, my laundry for a trip to Kris's house, and they said okay, but of course they cheated, when I finished, they didnt let me go, so here I stand, or..sit. In front of the computer grounded for today and tomorrow, geez, this sucks. I got in trouble for something I didnt do, breathing fire on all her new clothes I can understand, but everything else, thats irrational. Give me feedback, tell me what you think, your take on this.
*and this is what i got him bak with for every1 to see:

   the real story~
this is to my annoying brother as well as the rest of the world:
do not feel bad for my brother because as some of you know he likes to lie or change some details of the stories he tells people so id like to defend my self and set the record straight- 
yes my brother was on the computer listening to music, i was watching t.v he left the room and i went in, after about 15 min. he came back and decided to play the weirdest most irretating song ever louder than my own music (""very very low"" my a**) obviously its not fair that i was there 1st and he tried to take over(and the day before, he was downloading allllll day and listening to the weird songs allll day as well, so i didnt bother playing any music...)so i asked him nicely-because i knew i'd get in trouble any other way-""matthew can you please get headphones"" matt: ""no"" ok so that went on for about 10 minutes then i got a bit forceful-frustration-so i got the ultimate power~my dad, we both explained and my dad thought i was right so he asked my brother to get headphones,my brother trying to be superman attepmted to stand up to my dad by saying he wouldnt get them,he told my dad to get him the headphones and then he would use them -with attitude, something my dad doesnt like at all-so my dad basically said f**k you,get them yourself (although worded nicer)so after trying to be rebellious my bother i mean brother* get them and put them on in the orcess of gettin the headphons he left the music on and walked and moved extremely slow on purpose so i turned the music down he came back turned it up then i turned it off! then i kept my hand there on the volume control and told him not to touch me so being an idiot he pushed my hand away, so i pushed him backand got up (preparing for war)so he swung at me and i went crazy but hes no angel either so that finished we both left with battlewounds his arm and my head were both very red lmao so we went yelling to the living room where ""the elders"" were and once again they thought i was right so he got bi**hed at and grounded fir 1 day only 1 and then just for glory there he attempted another act of rebellion and said ""give me another common' 1 more day"" so my mom jus kindof did the nodd for the im-gonna-kill-you-look thing, then he just stayed in his room and then came here to post this stupid changed story
post back and tell me who YOU think was right 
dont feel bad we wont care its just for me to know lol

***and in a reply sum-1 said: oh yeah, younger childs always win. patric could have a bloody knife in his hand as i lay hunched over on the floor, covered in blood and he'll be like .... KRIS STABBED ME! and he would win
**matt responded with: Finally, people understand. Chelsea could be holding my heart in her hand, about to eat it, because she is the spawn of satan, while I lie dead and bloddy with a hole in my chest, and parents would scream at my dead body, ""MATT, HOW COULD YOU?!! WE BOUGHT THAT SHIRT FOR CHELSEA YESTERDAY, AND YOU ALREADY GOT BLOOD ON IT?!!?,"" then my dad 'll say something like ""GOD MATT, YOURE SUCH AN ASSHOLE, I SPENT MY MONEY ON THAT SHIRT!""

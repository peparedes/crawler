I sit on a big blue bouncy yoga ball at an old farmhouse table. My white laptop computer is open before me. Directly over the screen I look across the room and see a cabinet against the kitchen wall. It is six feet high, and the top half is a glass door revealing three shelves. Each shelf is cluttered with little jars and bottles. Some of the glass jars are clear. I see greens and browns inside. Are these botanical specimens? Each shelf is crowded to overflowing with the little containers. The top shelf holds a large clear jar full of brown straws...cinnamon sticks. The middle shelf holds a jar of lavender flowers and deep mahogany berries - the kind used to season gin. Throughout the the clutter of glass bottles there are small pottery crocks that are clearly ornamental.

This is no neatly organized cabinet. I'll bet that the owner needs to take out most of each shelf's contents to find one desired item. Maybe she wishes it were alphabetically organized. Maybe she enjoys rifling through the bottles each time. Maybe she knows exactly where each item can be found. 

The brown cabinet with the spotted glass door holds herbs. Stack atop it are baskets. They are arranged in the shape of a crown. I blur my eyes and see just the white space around it. The combination of tall skinny cabinet and flaring baskets appears to be a flaming torch. The woven patterns of the baskets aiming every which way recalls the pattern of flames.

Woody herbs, dried roots and shaved bark inside. Pottery vessels inside. Wicker  and cane baskets on top. Wood cabinet. All earthy and earthly. All waiting for transition: herbs waiting to be ground and sprinkled on foods or mixed into incense, baskets waiting to be filled and put into service. Herbs waiting to transform, baskets waiting to go afield. And the large negative-space impression: torch. Wooden wand waiting to be transformed, flames reaching outward.

Both images - the microcosm and macrocosm - one and the same."

Headmaster Dumbledore,

Enclosed you will find the Pre-BATs results for Ronald Weasley.  This young man is a credit to your school and we are certainly looking forward to having him join us next Autumn.

Also attached is a proposed schedule for independent study that we feel would best suit Mr. Weasley's needs for improvement.  While Divination is not a commonly needed skill for an Auror, that has been included as well; during his Divination tests, Mr. Weasley predicted that the proctor would die half a dozen ways before the end of this year.  A passing grade for this test was issued when Mr. Fogg, the aforementioned proctor, did in fact meet his end when he was hit by a lory traveling the wrong way on a one-way street while crossing to buy a raisin scone.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

Phineas Falafal"

Mr. Ronald J. Weasley
Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry



Mr. Weasley,

Upon review of your Pre-BATs scores, it has been determined that you would be an excellent candidate for early enrollment in the Auror Training Programme.  In particular, your marks on Defense and Transfiguration were excellent and are well withing the range that we require from candidates who have already completed their schooling.

However, praise for those particular marks aside, your Charms and Potions scores were only marginally average for an incoming trainee and your knowledge of Divination and Magical Creatures is shaky at best - although you do seem to know rather a lot about the giant man-eating spiders of the Middle East, which is curious to say the least.

According to the Wizarding Majority Act of 1950, no person under the age of seventeen may enroll in the Auror Training Programme; being as your birthday falls during your next term at Hogwarts, we feel that the interim would best be served by partaking in independent study along with your normal classes in all areas, not just the ones in which you need improvement.  While this is not a requirement for your acceptance to the programme, please remember that you will need to undergo a final round of testing on the NEWT level prior to beginning your training with us.

If you have decided that this course of action is not for you, then we wish you will.  However, please understand that you will not be able to renege on your refusal once it has been noted in your personal file.

Otherwise, we look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,

Phineas Falafal"

Baffled, Daughter Missing

The quiet&nbsp;street of Culbreth Terrace was rocked this morning by sirens and lights as police cars, ambulances and investigators lined up and down the kerb, all heading for the brightly lit home of Doctors Michael&nbsp;and Catherine&nbsp;Granger.

According to&nbsp;one investigator's statement, sometime after midnight last night, a group of unknown persons forced entry into the Granger home, literally removing the back door from its hinges.&nbsp; The assailants then made their way upstairs and slaughtered the two dentists.&nbsp; When asked for further details, officials declined to comment, citing their open investigation.

Mr. and Mrs. Granger had two daughters, Mary Elizabeth - who was&nbsp;alseep down the hall the entire time her parents were being murdered and is now being treated for shock at a local hospital&nbsp;- and Hermione Jane.&nbsp; Hermione attends a private school for gifted children, according to friends and neighbours, although no one could say exactly where the sixteen year-old girl is.

Investigators ask that anyone with information about this senseless crime, or those who might know how they can contact the missing Granger girl about her parents, please alert the appropriate officials.</FONT></P></FONT>"

Hogwarts student and friend of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger went to bed last night secure in the knowledge that her Muggle parents were safe from the war that has been tearing our world apart bit by bit for generations.

Yet when she woke this morning, it was to the discovery that she was an orphan.&nbsp; Ministry officials had no comment at press time, other than to remind reporters that these murders fell under the jurisdiction of the Muggle police, who also declined comment on the grounds that any information could potentially damage their ongoing investigation.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></EM>"

<i>by Marin Maltese, special correspondent</i>

On Tuesday afternoon, the Finch-Fletchly family was going about a typical family afternoon, enjoying the weather together.&nbsp; Justin Finch-Fletchly, Sr. had taken the day on holiday to spend it with his wife and youngest son, Marcus.&nbsp; No one knows why Mr. Finch-Fletchly made the decision to take the day to be with his family, although it has since been proven to be a fatal one.

At approximately 3:15 pm, while the Finch-Fletchly family - minus their oldest son, Justin, Jr. who currently attends <i>Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry</i> - sat to tea in their house, a group of unknown individuals forced entry past the wards and locks on the back door.&nbsp; Much like a Muggle home-invasion, the family was thoroughly beaten and abused before Mr. Finch-Fletchly and Marcus were sent on to join Merlin.&nbsp; Mrs. Katherine Finch-Fletchly was found hours later by a neighbour who was concerned when her firecall was left unanswered and was immediately sent to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies.&nbsp; Officials have yet to properly question Mrs. Finch-Fletchly, but according to the neighbour who found her, she was raving about wicked demons and soulless creatures.<lj-cut>

Finch-Fletchly, Sr. and young Marcus were both found dead at the scene.&nbsp; At press time, Ministry officials had not yet revealed exactly how the Finch-Fletchly men had been killed, although an inside source has told this reporter that it was ""horrific and inhuman.&nbsp; I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.""

While this is the first such daytime attack since the days of He Who Must Not Be Named, over the past two weeks the Wizarding World has been rife with unexplained and exceedingly violent murders.&nbsp; The Ministry is baffled, only able to send the two survivors to the hospital with unanswered questions and a pat on the hand.&nbsp; Law enforcement officials only seem to show up long after the damage has been done, citing faulty wards that failed to notify them of violence within the home.

Known as ""Potter's Law,"" the Domestic and Dark Magic Violence Act of 1990 mandates that all wizarding homes in the UK have special wards placed on them that will notify the appropriate officials in the event of an invasion or attack on the resident family.&nbsp; Ideally, the wards should be tripped the moment the perpetrator (or perpetrators) cross the property boundaries with violence on their minds.&nbsp; Aurors from the nearest office would be dispatched to deal with the situation and further loss of life would hopefully be averted.

The DDMVA was passed in the memory of James and Lily Potter of Godric's Hollow.&nbsp; They were both slaughtered by He Who Must Not Be Named, leaving their only child, Harry alone in the world.&nbsp; While the world knows Harry as the Boy Who Lived, advocates of the DDMVA pointed out that there might not have been a need to call him that if there had been adequate security on the Potter home that Halloween night in 1989.

Critics of the act were quick to respond with the rather obvious notion that a few government-designed protection wards would hardly have stopped He Who Must Not Be Named.&nbsp; Regardless, the DDMVA was passed by a clear majority vote on 22 June, 1990 during the Midsummer Wizengammot session.

Yet in seven homes in two weeks, the wards have inexplicably failed.&nbsp; The perpetrators of these murders have destroyed entire families, taking hours to do their work - hours that could have saved any number of the sixteen victims (fourteen fatal) had the wards not been ""faulty"" as Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, was quoted as saying in a recent, hurried press conference yesterday afternoon.

""Quite obviously there is nothing that the Ministry of Magic could have done to prevent these tragedies,"" Fudge said.&nbsp; ""The victims are loosely connected only by the merit of having school-aged children, though the... [physical] nature of these crimes would indicate that they have nothing to do with the children.&nbsp; There is no pattern to the violence, either, although [Ministry] Arithmancy experts are working double-time in an effort to predict and prevent the next attack.&nbsp; We will stop this.""

Questions have been raised about the possibility of the killings being connected to the return of He Who Must Not Be Named.&nbsp; Fudge, of course, denies any such allegations.

""There have been no Dark Marks found at the scenes,"" Fudge said when asked for a statement.&nbsp; ""And everyone knows that You Know Who likes to leave calling cards.""

Never mind, of course, the distinct possibility that He Who Must Not Be Named has learned from his mistakes from fifteen years ago.

It is quite clear that the Ministry of Magic is going to fail the Wizarding World when it matters most yet again.&nbsp; And so it falls to the common wizard to save the life of his neighbour.

<i>The Daily Prophet,</i> along with <i>the Muggle-Born Wizards Alliance</i> and <i>the Magical Equality Coalition,</i> is hereby offering a reward of 250,000 Galleons to anyone with information that leads to the capture of the person or persons responsible for these recent crime.&nbsp; Interested parties may contact Max Muldoon, Editor-In-Chief of <i>the Daily Prophet</i>; anonymity is assured for the safety of all concerned."

The Ministry of Magic certainly has had quite a lot to answer for over the past two years.&nbsp; First, there was the controversial return of the Tri-Wizard Tournament to the three largest wizarding schools in Europe.&nbsp; While traditionalists hailed this as a way to rebuild a once strong and stable world through the children who will one day make up the ruling generation, the more cautious worried that such violent competition would only serve to divide the Wizarding World further.&nbsp; 

Of course, that particular venture ended worse than nearly anyone could have imagined; with lies, cover-ups, and murder.

Then, just a few short months ago, the cover-up initiated by Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, was blown wide open by the unprecedented and bold appearance of He Who Must Not Be Named within the very walls of the Ministry itself.&nbsp; The ensuing investigation has been bogged down by beaurocratic double-talk and repeated attempts to thwart the attempts made by the press and this reporter to inform the general public of what the Ministry has - and has not - been doing to protect the general public.

And now the latest series of Ministry blunders, the continuance of Dementors as the guards at Azkaban Prison, has proven to have disastrous results.&nbsp; After the revelation of a Ministry official using the Dementors for personal gain, there was a public outcry against those dark and unnatural creatures; if one person could control them so easily, then what if He Who Must Not Be Named got it into his power-mad mind to do the same?

Some say that perhaps that has already happened.

Early this morning, at around half past three, four cloaked figures somehow managed to slip past the prison wards - wards that have been nearly doubled since the much-publicised escape of Sirius Black three years ago and the less widely-known escape of the Lestranges last year - and evaded detection by the unnatural guards to free two of the most notorious prisoners since Black himself.&nbsp; According to officials, Lucius Malfoy and his sister-in-law, Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black, were being held in maximum security cells deep within the prison.&nbsp; 

Yet after last night, both of these infamous prisoners are somewhere out there.&nbsp; They could be hiding anywhere, officials say, and a full-scale search of all potential hiding places is under way.&nbsp; Yet this reporter is sceptical, because the Ministry of Magic has yet to recapture any escapees from Azkaban Prison without the involvement of Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&nbsp; Perhaps Minister Fudge, whose abilities have been called more and more into question over the past few months, would do well to enlist assistance now, before it is too late."

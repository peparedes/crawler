"event","What is it about moving that makes you want to drink?
Like correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it just a tradition when moving to get a case of beer and down'er while hauling heavy shit? 
Today I am starting to pack up and move all the crap from the youth centre to the new locatation and without even thinking, I was all ""man, I sure need a beer."" then I remembered that I was suppose to be having beer b/c I am moving!!!
Now I want to go get beer. Is this a good idea or a bad one? I am at work, but on the other hand I AM moving, so what do I do? I also have a practicum student, so is drinking on the job setting a bad example? 

Why is the weather so shatty latley? It defo feels like fall now, I'm thinking about putting my fan away that has been in my bedroom window all summer. It's almost time to wear shoes again too and I hate shoes....I love me flip-flops.

Big Brother 5 is on tonight.....it's such a stupid show but I am so addicted to it and feel like a huge nerd when I watch it b/c I don't answer the phone and seclude myself from any human contact until it's over.

Gay show was on last night but was a re-run, wonder when the new gaytastic season starts....they also need more grrls on it and get rid of all the dick shots.....

I was looking at engagement rings online last night...wonder if this means that I am truly ready to get married and commit myself to one person forever......I think I have always been in that frame of mind but just waiting for the right person to come into my life until I was serious about it.

Well,back to moving.......with no beer in sight.

AND MOTHERFACKER IT'S GOING TO RAIN.
WHY ME.
It's been sunny like every Saturday this summer and the ONE Saturday I am holding an event, the weather turns on me!
This is what we call 'Shelley luck'. Shelley has the worst possible luck in the world and it seems that someone or something in this solar system is out to get me. No no, I'm not claiming 'victim', I just think it's weird that a lot of bad things happen to me....but then again, many good things happen as well.
I also saw that we one another medal....in trampoline.
Bouncing is a sport??! PLEASE, that's not even a sport!! 
I think we are now tied with Antartica and Timbuktu for medal counts.

"event","So I have this practicum student at the youth centre and like......she will be my future client one day I reckon.
I appreciate that she is trying to get her life together in the fact that she entered a program that trains her to work in social services so she can stop being on welfare.

What I don't appreciate is her lack of motivation, extreme lack of hygene, zero interest in what she is doing here, general appearance and her dilusional views on her career and life. She has a 3 year old son that is in need of clothes,food and what looks like medical attention and when she gets her paycheque for this program she is in, she spends it on her tattoos and fast food.  Did I mention that all her clothes are tattered and she wears the same dirty outfit 3 days in a row? Did I mention she doesn't wear a bra...around teen boys? Did I mention she showers once a week if that? How about the fact she doesn't talk? I know I am being judgemental and who am I to critisize someone?....

I am a social worker and it is my job and my training in the field that allows me to look at the gaps in a persons life and hw they can better it.....this is what makes it ok. Plus the fact she is working in a youth centre and should be conducting herself in a certain way, which includes dress and speech.

I dunno. I guess I'm just frustrated at this moment b/c when I hauled my ass into work on Saturday and came in ready to do a bunch of shit at 1pm with her....she came in at 1:20 and w/out even saying hello to me, plunked her ass down and ate a bunch of McDicks for 30 mins. 
If she was actually hired by the Agency (which would never happen) and if I actually had the power to fire her, I would have done so weeks ago.

I learned a lot this summer. Shelley got her groove back which was something I was sorely missing between January and June'04 due to a number of jackasses that messed with my life and karma will surley get them in the end. 
....groove meaning self-esteem,confidence and belief that I am meant to be in social services and the power and control I have over my own fate in this industry and no facker can shoot me down from where I belong.
.....I learned not to trust friends you have only known for a short amount of time....in fact, trust no one
.....that I am a kid at heart and alwas will be
.....that I have found my life mate thanks to technology
.....to learn to forgive and forget and let time do it's job in mending the soul...

"event","So as I was driving to work, I noticed there was this church along my route called 'Church of God'....and I started to think that maybe they should have a 'Church of Satan' or a
'Church of Cats' or a 'Church of Pizza'...mmmm that would be a yummy church.

But seriously, why would you call a church this? Isn't it kinda obvious that if there is a church, it is where you would worship God? Maybe they wanted to make it clear that they do worship God in that church and not Satan, which perhaps they have been accused of in the past. I just thought it was kinda bizarre.

I started to think about how when I was a Cobain wannabe grungester back in grade 9 and 10 how ppl in my circle of friends were only allowed to like either Pearl Jam or Nirvana, but not both. It was like some weird political thing, like you had to side with the deeper side of music which would be Cobain, or with the bouncier music which was Vedder. You would be outcasted if you even thought of crossing over or had an album from each band. I chose to side with Nirvana, but I think I also secretly like Pearl Jam and occasionaly borrowed my bro's CD. One day a friend of mine came over (who was also a Nirvana sider) and was flipping through my CD collection and saw Peal Jam's Ten in it. The CD was yanked from it's case,flung across the room and a million questions ensuded as well as the slur 'motherfucking trader'. Good thing it was my brother's CD.....honestly.....I remember spending weeks trying to prove my Nirvana loyalty, which included buying more Cobain style clothes and aquring more posters. Man those days sucked.....but were so,so interesting

Anyways,not sure where I was going with that, just a random thought to share.....

~today i am not going to talk about work~

Instead I will talk about music. 

'Shelley's music blurb for Dummies':
I can't belive I use to like that Lillix song. I think I must have been on some hard core drugs. They are so awful it hurts my teeth. And how about that new Alanis M song? WTF is that. It's horrible and they play it so much that I must have lost 5 pounds from constantly getting up to turn the station each time I hear it. I use to like raver techno music about 4 years ago after living with a rave-a-holic at UVic. I no longer am that turned on by it.I think it would be cool if I had a mullet, listened to Willy Nelson and Dwight Yokam and wore only flannel shirts,black tight jeans and steel toed work boots. And what if that was really ME and I thought it was totally acceptable and cool to look like that? Would my friends still be my friends? Would I live in Penticton? Would I drive a motorcycle or a pick up truck? I would for sure be a hardcore lesbian and buy the movie Monster (on VHS) and watch it at least once a week b/c I would love that movie....that and GI Jane.

"event","So the news of the week is.....
My boss quit last Thursday, the very same day she was sex-phone-operating and told me to do whatever I wanted and she didn't care.
So this has now made me the boss. I've been offered a promotion and a raise by the Exec. Director of the agency for the summer and they are hiring me an assistant this week. The only probelm is that I do not know if I want this. It is a lot more stress and requires a lot more focus and organisation, both of which I lack in extreme.
The good part about it is I have no one watching over me anymore and can fudge my hours I actually am at work.
I am going for a job interview on Monday for a very stress-less/mindless summer gig.....and don't know if I want that either b/c it will do nothing for my resume but will give me the much needed stress break I so badly desire this summer.

Fack being a grown-up. Fack making choices.

I washed my car today, that was pretty exciting. I then put grass seed on the lawn and watered it. I also did a dark load of laundry and now it is drying. I am about to go to the gym in 20 mins and that will probably be the highlight of my day.
I feel like I should be suntanning but I hate getting all hot and gross after lying in the sun.

She also told me that I can leave work anytime after she does just as long as she 'doesn't know about it'-hint hint.

"event","I don't think it's possible to fully watch and concentrate on a movie when you are seeing it with someone you are 'into'.
I have always had a major problem watching movies with someone I like/am going out with as I never really am 'watching' the movie, more pining over the person sitting next to me. Sure I stare at the screen and laugh/cry/make comments when appropriate which is usually cued by others around me, but when it comes down to it, I couldn't tell you a single thing that happened in the movie once it's over.
I think that seeing a movie with someone you like/love is a scapegoat to supress the natural biological and slightly socially unacceptable fact that all you really want to do is just crawl into a dark corner and get all over each other. Seeing a movie allows you to be toegther and enjoy each other w/out 'being together'. It makes both people seem much less horny and more into 'buliding something' .....when the truth is you are horny and building something means being on top of each other.
Don't get me wrong, I do like movies and I do value my relationship and all the building that comes with it, but I know that in the movies, I want to be making out while watching the movie b/c...well I love and adore my gf and the time we have togther is precious these days. 
So don't think I'm this horn-dog pig and all I want to do is 'f' b/c I am not a man so that is simply not the case.......just some insight to the human psyche if you will.

Hi. I'm Shelley. I'm 25, a student,a homeowner,an artiste, a friend, a lover, a realist who wants to be a dreamer.
I guess this journal thing fits in with my writing degree somehow and I'm hoping it will inspire me to write more since I don't have much time or passion to do it anymore.
So news....lets see.....Currently I am in the second week of my summer job and it's..ugh....how do you say....kinda stressful and a wee bit boring. I hope it gets better and a lot more fun.
I just finished watching 'Love Actually' as the love of MY life is nuts about the movie so I owed it to her to see why. I liked it....not as much as she does, but a very thought prevoking film none the less. It made me realise how lucky I am to have found love and to never let it slip away again. It also made me think that everything happens for a reason and everything occurs on it's own agenda w/out us being aware of it (which goes for love and other matters). You cannot force love, you have to let it find you, and this I became aware of at age 24 when I found the grrl I know I am suppose to be with for a very long time.

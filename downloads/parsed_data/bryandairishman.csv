If the dawn means the day is upon us, I say forever I will hide in the shadows.  And if maturity means I am condemned to the cold, I will forever burn bright in childishness.  If they tell me to settle for one who is less than ideal, I will always, always be alone.  And if the tide brings in a trend of apathy, I will drown in my passion before it is taken away.   And finally, if being warm, happy, content, and well-adjusted means selling myself to become what they say I should be, I will scream in the pain and agony of my abnormality for all eternity."

""You've got a disease that there is no known cure for.  We have run the appropriate tests and found alarming conclusions.  This is a very troubling circumstance.  But what is more troubling is how you developed this condition.  It seems that due to constant exposure to the dangerous realities around you, this extremely rare virus has infected you.  I am afraid there is no known cure. On top of this, the disease is extremely contagious""

Perplexed as usual, I had to ask, ""What is this disease?""

The answer: ""An unyielding hunger for the truth, a passion for the people around you, and sorrow for those who still lie in darkness. To put it plainly, you have a heart.  We must amputate immediately."""

 Before i left Atlanta, i was working on getting a friend at least one gallery show. i sent emails, had meetings, etc....i even branched to Louisvile, knowing that i would at least be there to visit my family. Well, it seems to be paying off. i have 4 places interested in showing his stuff. 
 
So what is my problem?

 Well, said friend and i are not speaking at the moment due to something stupid that i did. He isn't taking my calls, returning my emails, etc...i don't even know if he EVER wants to work it out. Part of me is thinking to just say fuck him and tell the galleries that he isn't interested yet a part of me is thinking give him a couple of weeks to cool off and talk to him about the offers.

Any advice?"

"event","Ah the roller coaster of life.

In recent news we have lots of hours at work next week, YAY!  So a 40 work week is likely, which is great b/c money = good.  Which is even better with bills being due and such. Augh, I have to order checks.  

I just got back from helping Jess on her web-project and I realized something odd.  I <i>like</i> editing.  I actually get a kind of high off it.  Every spelling mistake, or grammatical error found feels like a mini victory.  I don't know if this means I enjoy finding flaws or am an english nazi.  Either way is a bit unsettling... Yet...  I <i>enjoy</i> it! I'm bouncy now, and feel like I've done something useful aside from work today!

******

Persona 4 at first glance:  Will the cutscenes never end? I spent at least 2 hours watching my character move and interact with little or no input from me.  I feel like the fight system has been dumbed down slightly from 3, or maybe its just the color scheme... The bright yellow wears on my nerves a bit.  
And three separate times someone hurts themselves in front of my character. The auto prompt? 
"" Oh, that looked like it hurt.""
"" You should probably leave them alone""
Are you Kidding me???  Someone nose dives into a trashcan, gets kicked in the junk, and hits a phone pole and I'm supposed to leave them alone?  My instinct says go help, yet my character walks right by the scene...
The female voices: Just... off!  Chie sounds like shes in her 30s! The only female voices done right are a teacher and a character who DIES within 5 min of meeting her.  I can do better voices.
I don't hate it... it's just there is enough slightly wrong about it that it's annoying.  Sigh, I'll still play it once through."

I love how my company never fully schedules us hours.  They leave some for the end of the week, so we employees feel like we're getting a good deal if they allow us to stay later.   But who really feels good when they ""get"" to stay later?  Why not just schedule all of the hours and then I don't have to get called in every freaking day I'm ""not on the schedule"" ???
This happens at least once a week for me.  I get a call saying hey want some extra hours, or want to come in early?  Um... NO.  I don't! Making more money is a good thing, but when you don't scheduale me to work.... I make plans!
Like fixing a computer! ooooorrrr hanging out with a friend I havent seen!  So I have to choose between making money and doing fun things, which I guess everyone does to a degree, but it would really be fun to not have to do that. 
Flipside: Yes, I am aware that it is a measure of trust that my bosses put into me.  Dependable me, me who rarely if ever misses a shift, and has called in a total of twice the entire time I've worked there.  In essence, they own me, whoo hoo.

Ok, maybe there's a bit of Scrooge in me, but as much as someone loves me 
I would rather not recieve a gift from them than be given a useless, unwanted
piece of junk.  If you're a friend, let's go DO something together!  Spend
the TIME not the money, and it might be more fun!  Or maybe, instead of giving 
me the same thing you bought me 2 YEARS ago, a giftcard! 
Now it's not that I'm ungrateful for the gifts I've received, on the contrary
my mother gave me a hot wheels car, and told me it was the best she could afford.
That's hysterical!  I laughed when I saw it.  My father, who I'm at odds with, 
has given me a 500GB harddrive. 500GB!!!  
Not that I need such a huge one, it's still a nice gift.  
All I ask is, don't give a gift to simply give a gift.

Lots of them include little things like remember to read my bible every day, or practice the guitar, and

try everyday to stick to a routine.  Routine is very boring and I am manically against it.  Those of you 
who know me well know my attention span is next to nil and if I don't care about something, 
it will probably never be attempted, done, or finished.  But if there is something that you know that
I need to change (i.e. I do something weird for no reason and it grosses, weirds, or anything else you out)
let me know.  I'm probably not aware of it.

It's all Nessa's fault!!!!
Phanta's music makes me shiver, its so awesome.  The music
is so full, like rock opera.  And they put a harpsichord in some of 
their songs which is one of my favorite instruments.  

I love Strobo, WAIVE, and Phantasmagoria.  

I hate Vanessa."

the song has been completely ripped from Japan's band Strobo (Strobe)'s third single!  The single, titled ""love letters"",  was released on Jan 24 of this year.

hello....

So I, um, actually forgot I had an LJ.  Heh, silly me.  So Chicago... Yeah...

Haha, I've actually been going to school for the past forever, and just graduated, (Go me!!) 
and working so I officially vanished from the online scene.  BUT I was informed that I had an LJ recently,
and lo and behold I found it.  I think I deserve a prize.  
 Upon recently graduating, I have decided to once again pack up residence, being as basements are cold,
and I appreciate a critter and child-free environment.  Finding a job with the newly minted certificate is going to be slightly interesting.  Plus the fact that I need a place to practice my skills so to speak.
SO what the heck has everyone been upto???"

I hate Chicago, with a passion.
Don't get me wrong, I love the stuff here, and I love it on the weekends, but living here just bites.
People here are crabby, impatient and just plain rude.
My only salvation comes from knowing that I'll be going back to school soon, though I havent a clue how I'm going to restart this whole process.  Someone just shoot me, please!"

"event","I actually buckled down and did it... I joined a gym! Yup, a full year-long membership. I'm going to start going tomorrow! As part of the membership package, I get a free consultation with a personal trainer to help set up a fitness program. I think I'm going to go for a month or so, see what kind of results I'm getting, then meet with a trainer after that to help me create a program for myself. Very exciting. :) I also joined Weight Watchers online. The point tracking is so much fun! haha. Once I lose 10lbs I'm going to buy myself a nice new pair of runners. My goal is to lose 41lbs overall, so to make the goal seem more manageable I'm going to break it up into 10lb minigoals, with rewards at each level! 170 - new runners, 160 - manicure, 150 - facial and some nice makeup, 139 - new bathing suit (bikini perhaps? lol) and clothes! Ideally July 9 is my goal date. If I feel comfortable and confident with the way I look before 139 then I'm fine stopping at that point, but its nice to have a physical number to go by. I'm going to plan on going to the gym 5x a week with strength training sessions 2x a week. I'll try do 45 - 60 minutes of cardio per session (depending whether or not I'm doing strength training). I might even try attend a class or two. Pilates seems pretty appealing at the moment. 

Anyhow, just wanted to share my excitement. :)"

"event","I wonder what exactly it is that is keeping me from overcoming the obstacle of eating healthfully. Here is what I ate today:

Tim Horton's Iced Cappuccino (350 calories)
Tim Horton's chocolate chip cookie
salami sandwich (on whole wheat bread.. heh)
bowl of chicken soup (this was one of the better choices I made)
a box of Kraft Dinner (definitely not so good)

So.. overall.. I had no fruits or veggies, and basically ate a whole bunch of processed crap. Bad, very bad. I think the main reason is we have very little money, so we don't have a lot of fresh produce or healthy foods in the house. I'm going to have to try spend a little money on things that are good for me like fruit, veggies, whole grain breads and lean meats so I can attempt to pack a healthy lunch and prepare a nutritious dinner. On Thursday or Friday I'm going to head over to the gym I used to be a member of and purchase a membership. I don't care if it's expensive, because when I was a member I actually did go regularly. I just didn't have the money to renew that membership at the time. Regular exercise is something I'm going to have to incorporate into my life sooner rather than later. 

Here's what I plan to eat tomorrow:
Breakfast:
1c bran flakes
1/2c 1% milk

Lunch:
1 container of ff yogurt
1c cantaloupe
2 slices of turkey breast

Dinner:
Large salad with chicken, a bit of cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. 

Snack:
not sure yet! A piece of fruit or some veggies maybe.

Let's see if I can get through tomorrow."

"event","I haven't posted here in ages. I haven't been losing weight, or exercising or eating right. Today everything is going to change! I'm eating a healthy breakfast, lunch, and dinner no matter what. I read an article n a magazine about how even though you may not be gaining weight on the outside in your 20s, you're putting fat around your organs and setting yourself up for future health problems. That really scared me! My goals for the next month are going to be: exercise for at least 30 minutes 4x a week, eat 1400 - 1500 calories per day, get in all my vitamins, and drink at least 2L of water. Lets see if I can do this for real this time. I'll keep everyone posted. ;)

height: 5'10""
weight: 171 (surprisngly! I'm usually 175.)
BMI: 24.5... in the normal weight range, but still at the higher end.

Goal:
139lbs by the beginning of April

that would mean a loss of 32lbs. If I were to reach a weight that I feel healthy and comfortable at before then, I would stop there."

Both of us are going to help motivate each other to get to our goals by July 1, then we'll reward ourselves with something fabulous, we're not sure what it will be yet. I think this is a great way to give me that extra kick in the butt to really keep pushing myself on this whole weight loss thing! I'm going to start going to the gym with my mom too, who is really looking forward to getting in shape. That will keep me motivated in that aspect of my life! These next few days will be hectic because I'm moving out of residence and going back home, so I won't have the opportunity to post for a little while. By the time I do, which is likely going to be Sunday, I'll be starting the SBD and aiming for 45 minutes of cardio 5x a week and strength training 3x. I'm going to post a weekly weigh-in on Monday's because that's going to be the official first day of this. I'll do an update on measurements every 2 weeks too, just for something fun that isn't my weight. haha. The goal is to go bathing suit shopping on July 1, so lets hope I'm looking decent by then!"

I'll do a 30 minute jog in the morning, then 30 minutes at the gym later in the day to break things up a bit. Once I get home (12 days) I'm going to start preparing meals for myself so I know everything that's going into them. I'm going to cut out sugar (excluding fruit), dairy, and all white stuff (white bread, white rice, pasta, poatoes) and replace it with smaller portions of high fibre foods. Here is what my first grocery trip will look like:

-apples
-pears
-oranges
-bananas
-berries
-spinach
-romaine lettuce
-cucumber
-tomato

At 12:30 I'm going to have an apple and a granola bar. I won't be able to eat an actual lunch because I have work til 3. After work I'll have a cup-a-soup, 3 crackers and a fruit cup. For dinner... ramen and a can of tuna (my pathetic version of a tuna casserole.lol), hey it's all I can afford on my measely budget! Then as a snack, a piece of fruit, or 3 more crackers. That equals about 1100 calories, so I might have a banana with a tsp of peanut butter to get in a healthier range! 
The gym is also a small possibility at this point, depending on how much of my history essay I get done. If I'm finished by 7pm, then I will go for an hour!"

"event","I'm back at school and all is well so far. I've joined a gym, and have been eating a lot healthier. My goal is to eat 3 small meals plus 2 snacks a day, and go to the gym 6 times a week. It will be an intense schedule with my classes, volunteering, and possibly a job if I can manage to snag one. I want to keep really busy this semester. Whenever I'm not studying in the library, I want to have something to do. I'm downloading some exercise videos (pilates, tae bo, and Carmen Electra's striptease!) so I can do those a few times a week too, just to spice things up. I've also been using www.fitday.com to keep track of what I'm eating and my activities. 

Aside from the healthy lifestyle I've been trying to live, nothing much is different here. I'm already behind in my readings, but that's because I still need to buy a few books! I will do that tomorrow, then get all caught up and hopefully stay that way for the rest of the year. 

I suppose I don't have much more to write about, so that's all for now. I'll try updating more often."

I woke up at 11:30am, and decided to close my eyes for another half hour or so, only to wake up again at 8pm. I have no idea how I could have had such a long, uninterrupted sleep, but I managed. Now my sleep schedule is completely backwards. I also haven't eaten anything in over 24 hours, so I can't wait til the cafeteria is open at 7:30! I took a shower at 2, and from then on, tried to catch up on some reading. After I eat, I'm planning on going to the library til about 6, when I will meet my friends for dinner. I'll buy a muffin and yogurt to keep me going through the day. Hopefully I won't cave and leave the library sooner than I'm planning!

He feigned interest for a bit, but that was the most I ever got out of this. I'm sure as soon as I stop trying to find love, it will come to me. That seems to be the way the universe works for the most part. I'm a touch sad about this revelation, because crushes are always fun, but this has gone from a crush to..hmm.. an annoyance I would say. Bah to that. 

A lot of studying needs to be done today, which is why I am up so bright and early! I need to shower, grab some breakfast, find a nice deserted place in the library and stay there for several hours. I think I will take another 30 minutes to relax before that shower."

My weekend was very tiring. Lots of getting up early, running around, and eating food that is very very bad for me. Oopsie. The ""health regime"" will restart tomorrow (today?) at breakfast. I will have a scrambled egg, one piece of brown toast, some fruit and water. It is fairly likely that I will end up having Pita Pit for lunch, and then probably some sort of chicken for dinner. I really want some chocolate milk right now, but it is too far away, and I am rather unattractive right now in my pjs and wet hair.

Oh, speaking of wet hair, I bought a straightener this weekend. Finally! How excited am I? It won't arrive for 2 - 3 weeks, but I am still very excited about it. I need to go to the mall to stock up on some hair products as I am running out. I might look for a winter jacket as well, depending how much shopping I feel like doing.

Like I've said in my last few posts, I'm really stressed lately. Not even about school at this point, but money. Yep, that isn't exactly a nice feeling. I still owe about $1000 for this semester, plus $2240 for next semester and about $300 on my Visa. Uh oh. I don't know how I'm going to afford Christmas presents, going home for reading week in February, or going to those concerts in March. Hopefully I will be able to get a lot of shifts over Christmas break and make about $300 so at least I won't have to worry about the Visa. Then I'll have to keep a pretty steady job throughout the semester. Ack.

Things are starting to get really stressful, which is saying a lot because I am never stressed out about anything. I have an assignment due tomorrow and one on Thursday, neither of which I am looking forward to working on. I know it will be the greatest feeling ever when they are both finished and out of the way, but I am just so unbelievably lazy. I bombed two of my midterms (60% and 61%), so I'm not exactly feeling great about that. This assignment is worth 5% more than the midterm, so I'm going to try do really well on it and hopefully that will bring up my average. I will also have to study like crazy for the final. I want at least a 70% average. Last year I would have had an aneurysm with these marks, but now I'm not even sure how I feel. I know I deserve them because I barely studied or went to class, but still. It's a slap in the face. My parents will be so disappointed in my if they find out. Ack. I will have to keep this on the down-low.

What other aspects of my life need talking about? I am currently playing MSN games with ""the boy."" Oh joy, look what I have come to. In an attempt to increase his attraction to me, I have decided to keep him blocked for a week. What this will accomplish I'm not entirely sure. I don't honestly think it's a good idea...it's just a last attempt to scrounge up some feelings from him. I'm sure actually talking to him and getting to know him even better would probably make more sense in the long run, but I am clearly not being logical at this point. Stupid Hazel.

Tomorrow I will attempt to purchase Coldplay tickets, if I manage to get the presale password. Joy. Seeing one of my favourite bands two weeks before final exams in spring is sure to lift my spirits. 

I suppose that is all for now. It is late and I still need to shower and finish an assignment before bed."

I'm so busy lately! The workload in my classes is getting to be quite a bit. Christmas break is just around the corner and I'll finally be able to relax-thank GOD. 

Did I mention how excited I am for Christmas? lol. I got an e-mail from my mom the other day asking to e-mail her my wishlist.. You know how much I love wishlists! I'm asking for an iPod nano, the full series of Sex and the City on DVD (you can buy the set on Amazon), the first and second seasons of The OC, chunky necklaces, clothes (mom knows my style) and anything from Sephora. I know it seems like a lot, but I obviously won't get everything I ask for (especially since the first two items alone total $600+).

Hmm..Let's see what else is happening in my life. Not a whole lot, that's for sure. I'm not sure if the guy I like is into me. He still has a thing for his ex-girlfriend, so that complicates things. I can never seem to pick ones without any issues or attachments. *sigh* I'll chalk it up to bad luck or bad taste or something. heh. Sometimes when we're talking I feel like he is coming around, but I can never be too sure. No one has ever really liked me back before, which is a very very sad situation. Either he needs to come right out and tell me he likes me or I need to get over him immediately. There aren't exactly a ton of guys around here to be interested in, but I guess I just have to make do.

I'll throw in some other favorites for fun.
t.v. show - Queer as Folk, Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm
book - Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, anything by Stephen Fry

drink - raspberry iced tea, cream soda, fresca, sparkling water
artist/group - pavement, the faint, hot hot heat, dandy warhols, bjork

"event","&nbsp;<strong><em><font color=""#ff00ff"">Hey everybody.&nbsp;<br /><br />So today I got to see the Live chat and let me tell you it was hilarious. I love the Jonas Brothers, they are hilarious. Joe played his and Nick's ringtones, and Joe sang to his, and Nick's was the James Bond Theme song, someone said it was the Pink Panther, and Kevin said somehting like ""That's not the Pink Panther it's 007."" I thought that was pretty funny, but maybe that's just me.<br /><br />In and Out,<br />~Danae~</font></em></strong>"

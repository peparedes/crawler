"event","I am really sick of putting things across multiple channels! You all know where the other one is, go look there if you really want! Bleh!

<lj-cut text=""A bit of stress!"">
So, I'm moving to Bastok sometime in the near-ish future! <font size=""1"">I'm really nervous.</font> I can't wait to see what it's like there! I mean, I've visited it <i>a lot</i>, but visiting a place and actually being counted among their number, that's kind of different! Like I know the Elvaan in San d'Oria treat you way different if you're not one of ""their"" Adventurers. I bet that's true for Bastok and Windurst, too!

I don't really plan on being there <i>long</i>, just, you know, to see what it's like. A little. Because, let's be honest, we all know I don't like Bastok that much. It kinda smells funny, and it doesn't really look that nice. Plus I'm just not as fond of the general layout of things! 

I know, I know, I learned my way all over San d'Oria first, so <i>of course</i> I like it best, right? I dunno. Windurst's so HUGE, I still have to look at my map sometimes when I'm over there. (I PLAN ON VISITING WINDURST AS A CITIZEN SOMETIME, TOO.) Also, Windurst is full of Tarutaru, who are short, and who talk funny, and who like to make threats.


I don't even know where everything in Bastok <i>is!</i>

... I wonder if they'll let me back beyond that one guard in the mines once I sign on under them.....
</lj-cut>

I'm really liking my new dagger! I used my old one for what felt like forever, though I know I've used other ones longer, but still. I was really used to it...! The new one isn't that different, but now that I'm used to it, it's definitely a little better. Not, like, hugely so. But definitely better! I can swing it faster, anyway. Whatever.

I had a linkshell for a while! Then it died! Then I had another one! Everyone dropped out and someone said it was 'on break' so I stopped wearing it. AND THEN I HAD NO LINKSHELL FOR MONTHS. It <i>sucked.</i>

And then I finally got another one. It, uh. I don't know! Died! Somehow! I was asleep, and when I woke up, it was broken. Beats me.  I've seen one of the people from it running around recently, but it's been a while now, so I haven't asked him. He probably doesn't remember me, anyway.

But now I'm in Aniko's social 'shell, which is pretty cool. This is totally weird, but it's lead by a guy I met waaay back when I started Adventuring! He was in the first party I was ever in! I wanna say he was the leader. We went out to La Theine and had our faces rearranged by an akbaba. hee. Haven't asked him if he remembers me. Highly doubt he would. Still, that's pretty cool that he's still around.

(Speaking of Ani, she totally gave me some awesome stuff pretty recently. THREE CHEERS.)


Agate's been retired a while now. I never really said anything on that, 'cause I was pretty upset for a while. I still miss her lots, but I call her out and we go riding, which is cool. She always looks happy, so I guess they're taking good care of her, but still... Not the same, you know? She's my little girl! I wanna go visit her and take her on walks, or tell her stories when she's sick or hurt!"

Of course, then Najelith (who got nabbed by the Undead earlier) and her rescue squad turned up just as the Mamool Ja ran off, and they were too freaked out to, you know, <i>clear the hall out</i>, so then a bunch of us got locked inside and had to take a really tiny, dark passage to escape.

Um, yes! So I got some tree cuttings off a big blue thing that I can't ever spell the name of a bit back, and since I'd had to buy some new pots to grow Agate's food and wasn't using them anymore, anyway, I decided to see what they'd give me!

"event","The Egg Hunt is on again! I kind of hate this event! Because <i>I can't not do it!</i> But it eats up all my time and also some of my gil, since the Moogle never gives you an F or an A egg, and how can you spell RONFA <i>without F or A</i>, I ask you?! YOU CAN'T! So you buy them!

Fortunately, the bazaars aren't selling them for too much this time!


SO GUYS. There are new eggs this year!  ... <i>Furnishing</i> eggs, not letter eggs. XD NO, HAY, THE MOOGLES INVENTED NEW LETTERS AND PUT THEM ON THE BIRD EGGS.


Um. Anyway! The San d'Orian one - the Melodious Egg! - plays a little tune at like 6 in the morning. Maybe at other times, too, but that's the only time I've been in to hear it. The new Bastok Egg's called the Clockwork egg and it is <i>a clock.</i> CLEVER NAME! So now I have two clocks! And two noise-makers. Though one noise-maker is also a clock.

Honestly, I like the clock better than the eggs.

And the new Windurst one is called a Hatchling Egg and it <i>stares at you all day it never STOPS</i> and its eyes <i>follow you</i> and it's ... eerie kinda.  Also, it makes like a cawing noise or something and scares me when I don't expect it. I RECOMMEND THIS ONE LEAST. :x

Those idiots in Norg, who I should not be speaking such of as they will undoubtedly tie my tail in a knot, have finally decided to share their <i>sneaky, sneaky stealth</i> with us lowly adventurers.

I can be quiet-walky now.  YAY ME!  Now I can hang up my mage hat. Or possibly set it on fire. Using the fireplace, not my own skills. Because I kind of have a notable lack of those.


ANYWAY, been helping Nabi out a bit, getting items! FUN. (CONGRATULATE HER.) I am back in Konschtat <i>hunting sheep-like creatures again.</i> I keep looking at the sheep. We are supposed to be looking for rams. It is a bit annoying and I feel very <i>silly!</i>


Also, I have been spending a bit of time over in Al Zahbi! It's kind of cool, since I got mercenary status! Naja scares me witless, though. <i>Stay away from her.</i>  The Beastmen - as you all know, yes? - invade town pretty regularly, so we ADVENTURERS OF AWESOME show up and help beat them back away! It's kind of terrifying, but kind of fun! I nearly get killed a lot.

And right now I'm Fauregandi in one of those crag-like structures and the Princes - who are up here, as well! - are about to start fighting some Orcs, and my little group (Aniko is with me) is just discussing some strategy before throwing ourselves into the fray.  I am so, so nervous.

But fortunately, there is another area that we cut through! It was very pretty!  I wonder what happened to it.  Something to look into. Maybe it blew up, I dunno.


So we made it to San d'Oria - and that was disorienting, let me tell you? We exited through Jugner on the far side of the lake - without swimming across or anything, before you ask! - and found ourselves in <i>East Ronfaure</i> instead of King Ranperre's Tomb like we'd been expecting.

So, people are being allowed to raise their own chocobos! I want to get my own, but I don't know how well I'd be able to take care of it.  Can I raise it in San d'Oria, or would I have to be in Jeuno?  'Cause I don't really like Jeuno.  Sure, good place to visit, but it's so crowded! The view is very nice, though.


Nehima and I were supposed to make plans to do some stuff together, but, well... I don't think we will.  That is okay, though! I know she has other things to do!  Me, I want to keep practicing my ninjutsu, maybe get half-decent at it.  I don't like it, but I know it really helps me, so I try not to complain <i>too</i>, too much.

Nabiki's been busy and Zied's shown up again.  Crytuf retired.  Not sure why.  Maybe she got sick of Shadowlotus's mocking. XD  Though I can kind of relate to getting sick of all the stuff we have to deal with as adventurers.  It can get annoying!  Guards talking down to you, always being broke... It's fun, though, so I can't ever imagine actually giving it all up.  Taking breaks is nice sometimes, though.


But there is a problem with taking breaks! I am kind of broke! If you don't go out and earn your gil, obviously, you run out! Need to go farming again, but I kinda want to start / pick up clothcraft again.  I liked what I did of it, I just ... kinda stopped for some reason.  Not sure why?

Actually, Nabi and Zied and I went out worm hunting a while ago.  We got some stuff that'll sell, but I don't know if it's been put up yet.  Zied's even lazier than me sometimes!

But you know that Mary's Horn thing, that has to be made from that rare type of sheep in the highlands?  I didn't think she had one, so I decided to try and get one for her!

Of course, the sheep looks almost the same as all the other ones, so it's kinda just dumb luck, and even if you <i>do</i> find one, the horns have to be in good condition.


So I figured I'd go for either that or gil, since sheep leather, which you can make from sheep skins, sells really well and is easy to make.  I mean, I was going on, like, sheep genocide here, so sheep skins weren't gonna be a problem.


And then I pitched camp in Konschtat and never left ever again! =D


Actually~ I spent a lot of time killing sheep and stuff.  I made over 400k off those stupid skins!  Well, leather. Whichever.  

BUT! The best part is that I found the special sheep! Twice, even, but it only had a good horn the first time.  And Nabiki even didn't have it!  I hope she was very happy to get it. ^_^

<lj-cut text=""Yay!"">
I was just killing things in La Theine trying to improve my Ninja Skills and generally not doing very well at that.  I'm just not into it, you know...?

Um, anyway, people were talking on the LinkShell (not ours, another one; Aniko and I are both members) and were trying to pull together an exploration party for Cape Riverne.  I was supposed to be going out there anyway, to investigate some stuff that was weird or something, so I said I could come if they needed me.  So I got to go along!


...It was sooo pretty there!  Really, <i>really</i> weird, though.  Things were floating all over the place and stuff.  I mean, the <i>land</i> was <i>floating</i>. It was weird!! But so pretty...! o.o

I hate traveling through distortions, though.  Makes my fur stand up all over the place and everything and it's really uncomfortable and weird. >.<<i></i>;



GUYS THAT WYRM?  THE ONE THEY SAW ALL THAT TIME AGO?  IT WAS REAL.


And there people with these airships fitted for <i>war</i> came out of <i>nowhere</i> and tried to capture him!  They tried to kill us!  We managed to beat them, but it wasn't exactly easy... and next thing I know I'm in... Gustaberg.  No, I don't know how.

Well, we helped the Wyrm get free - Bahamut!  It was <i>Bahamut</i>.  And does anyone else think this is is a little creepy and foreboding?  ""Foolish children, you will never break free of the chains of Promathia..."" I wonder what she(?) meant... Isn't Promathia the Twilight God...?

But Prishe and Ulmia had gone into town, and I figured, what the heck... and tried to find them... She was yelling at the airship people.  ...x.x;; Maybe she'd never seen an airship before... She got thrown in jail to cool off a little, but Cornelia brought her to see Cid.  Cid thinks it was Jeuno who built the airships we saw, because Duke Kam'lanaut asked him to help on a similar project during the war. Prishe said she knew someone who may  be able to help, so we headed to Jeuno...

They arrested me. 


._.


I don't even know why! They were just like, ""grr!"" and I was just ""meep?"" and Aldo was all ""Leave my guests alone, stupid heads,"" and so they did, but then I had to go turn myself in, anyway, since it'd be a really stupid idea not to.  I mean, I have no idea what I did, but if I ran away, it'd only look suspicious, right?

I guess way back when that kid was, like, <i>everywhere I looked</i> or something, my being near him (like I could do anything about it?!) made me... I dunno.  Be helping him or something.  It made no sense to me.  Shush.  Where the heck was the real Archduke, anyway?


...Um, I got sent off to do some stuff to ""prove my innocence,"" anyway, so... back to San d'Oria.

Ended up killing a giant plant while in Jugner looking for someone (name escaping me right now...) and, by the way?  The Cathedral people?  No help.  At all.  'Cause they were the ones who sent us out and eventually into the giant plant...


From San d'Oria, it was off to Windurst, where those <i>stupid, stupid Tarutaru</i> were causing <i>more stupid trouble</i>.  Aaarg, they drive me nuts. @_@ They were trying to convince people that they were their kids!!  Yoran-Oran sent a bunch of us out to find some feathers to repair a mirror that could prove he wasn't related to them, so we ended up in Attohwa Chasm.

It's this crazy-dry maze place where dark plumes of miasma rise up from the ground... Did you know ""attohwa"" means ""dry"" in ancient Mithran, and wow is that appropriate?

The ground was cracked all over.  It wasn't even anything like Altepa, because Altepa is a desert, and not nearly as <i>hot</i> and <i>dry</i> and <i>utterly miserable</i> as this place was.  We wandered around and got attacked by antlions... which, by the way, don't exist in Altepa anymore.  We found a Mimeo stone being guarded by one of 'em, but we killed it.  ...unfortunately, to get it into the feather form we needed, we had to climb up this plateau-thing called Parradamo Tor to reach the ""Cradle of Rebirth"" to throw the stone into it...


Um.  Wow.  Okay.  That ""hill"" is evil.  It's got almost straight up walls, so you can't really walk up it, but there are small little edges running all along it, and, if you have reeeeally good balance, you can use them to climb up towards the top.  Fortunately, I am a Mithra and have very good balance! ^^

In some places, the miasma came out of the ground and we had to wait for it to go away again, and in some places we had to cross over bones - you know the giant skeletons like in Tahrongi?  They were big like that. o.o; Sometimes you have to slide down the hill to reach more ledges, 'cause the one you're on will just stop.


I eventually found a path to the top more through dumb luck than anything, and threw in the rock... Aniko kept slipping down the thing! >.<<i></i>  She's really lucky she didn't get seriously hurt!


It was really, really pretty up there, though.  I got to see sunset <i>and</i> the sunrise, 'cause I was waiting, but I eventually just had to leave... =\


I kinda wanted to see Tiamat, who I've heard lives in the chasm somewhere, but I have no idea where I'd even begin to look, and I was out of silent oil...


Anyway, I brought the guy the feathers, but I don't know if it was enough (maybe he needed more feathers?) and I left... I dunno what to do now.  Maybe go talk to Cid again, he seems to have half a clue about what's going on...

In the other half of the room, there's this switch that opens a hidden door (lots of hidden doors around here o.O), but if I go through the door, I won't be able to get back into the safety of this room, because there's no way to open it from the other side.

"event","Partied a little the other day.  We killed crawlers.  In the crawlers nest.  Thrilling?  Before that, though, I was farming stuff in Tahrongi, so I made a little gil. ^^

Party was actually a little crazy.  We kept getting links on the things (we weren't in a real good place, really), and once, nearly the entire party was murdered by three crawlers all at one.  Not entirely sure how we actually managed to survive that.  Also, a doom scorpion was running around in the main area.  That was kind of freaky, because I kept thinking it was gonna COME FOR US! See, it ran literally right through our group chasing someone, so I thought it'd be coming back, but it never did.  So. I dunno.


Then Crytuf and I wasted a loooong time killing crazy Cardians in the outer Horutoto (probably not spelled right XD) Ruins.  We adopted one as a pet for a while, too.  He was very cute.  ^^  Silly Two of Cups.  ^^  &hearts;

"event","There were only a few things I would have changed. ^^

Like I wished Nehima would've remembered that she said she'd come see me on my birthday.  But I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

<lj-cut text=""Okay, so..."">
I got up and checked my delivery box and - from Ayarei and Kihara, I got the stuff that goblin wanted in exchange for enlarging my bag a little!  So now I have more room in my bag!  Also, Aya must've sent Nabi the stuff for some kabobs, because I had a few of those, too! ^_^

Also I am still happy about my own presents to myself; a new bed and some deft rings! ^^


San d'Oria was ranked first again, too, and there are some new areas for me to deliver supplies to!  I like supplies quest!  They're a really good excuse to go out and do pointless things! XD


Anyway, I'd never done a run to Li'Telor or Kuzotz or Vollow.  There are a bunch of other places, too, but those three are all under San d'Orian control!  Of course, the monsters there could all kick my silly little tail, but whatever.


Aniko wasn't real busy, so we decided to go to Cape Teriggan 'cause we're crazy!  Finding a teleport to Altep was a little expensive, but!  Shortly after we'd arrived, this really fast <i>thing</i> went <i>right</i> past us!  It was that super-speedy cactuar you hear about!  It ran right in front of us!  How cool is that?  The weather was acting up, too, and - guess what we saw??  Tornados!  Sand tornados!  It was so awesome! XD  I got sand <i>everywhere</i>, but it was worth it!  Then I got mauled by a manticore, but that was okay, even though it really hurt. x.x;  Actually, I also got mauled by an Antican, while I was recovering from the manticore mauling, but whatever!

We went on to Kuftal Tunnel and we entered it and ack!  A robber crab tackled Aniko!  I was kind of stunned for a moment because - woah - once my eyes adjusted and stuff?  There were, like, a zillion monsters.  The crab didn't hear me, though, so I snuck back out.  Apparently - those people who work for the black market?  From <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/brinkoftwilight/13081.html?thread=216089#t216089"">this</a> conversation?  They'd brought a whole bunch of the stupid things near the entrance to the tunnel!  Jerks!

But the things left after a little while, so we headed back in, and managed not to get lost on our way to the cape!  Cape Teriggan was really pretty - full of things that could eat me, but pretty! ^^  We found the outpost with no problems and I gave them their stuff. ^^  Also, I discovered I had a map of the area, and this made me very happy.  Maps!  Ani and I headed for the Twilight Beach and looked around, and we checked out the Valley of Sorrows (kinda - there was a cliff, so we didn't get real far), and it was all very pretty!


Then we headed back and I picked up more supplies! XD


So we headed out again - this time for the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah!  Zi'Tah is so-so-sooooo preeeeetty~! o.o  I love Zi'Tah! We dropped off the supplies again and got stuck in a <i>massive</i> thunderstorm, and then we headed into Ro'Maeve.  Scary place!  Things aggro a lot there, but after one initial mishap with Ani and magic and a weapon, we didn't have any problems.  Place was crazy big.  Crazy pretty, too, but, at the other end, was the Hall of the Gods.


... =O


Seriously, you guys know I like to exaggerate and stuff, but... there weren't really words for it.  You entered into this huge hallway, where the lights glowed on and off, and, at the end of it, there was... there were these statues.  Promatia and Altana, on opposing ends, and several other statues lining the sides.  It was flooded, so there was only the one walkway in the middle.  The ceiling was so high up, I couldn't see it.  It was just incredible!  You know the feeling when you first saw a rainbow appear over the crag in La Theine?  It was like that, only multiplied by... some huge number. I don't even know what to say!

As we stood there, the sun rose, and - from somewhere - I think maybe the walls were somewhat translucent - rays of light came in and lit up the entire area.  It was just... wow.  I don't really know what else to say.  It was just wow.

I didn't really want to leave, but I was really tired by then, so... we headed back.  


I went to San d'Oria and, instead of heading straight to Jeuno, decided to ride a chocobo to Bastok (it is fun to do!), and the silly stable-people who cannot keep track of their chocobos asked me to bring it back to Bastok with me, so of course I did, and when I got there, they gave me a page from the Dragon Chronicles as thanks!  

Oh, and I picked up the supplies for the eastern Altepa outpost, which I'll probably do tomorrow, and now I go to bed!
</lj-cut>

It was much fun! ^__^

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #808080"">i have the song that was on that summerland episode memorized. i made my friend watch it when she spent the night. i think my other bff fell of a clif or something because she hasn't called me in like 4ever or e-mailed me. i hope she's ok. well, i went to roll pprs with my dad again and these hot guys were there and so was my bff and they sped by us really fast and smiled at us. :~) well, i can only be online for another 10 min cuz my dad has ""buisness"" he has to do. i don't know why my friend's dad always picks her up early. i'm surprised he waited until noon this time but it makes me mad that she can't ever just hang out with her friends and have her parents not cut our time short. like one time 3 of us walked to the Elliott park and talked for awhile about how we missed our school and just about everything. we wern't doing anything wrong but her parents drove up and told her they were going out to eat at her fave restaraunt so she left us there without her and we got really mad. her parents are nice sometimes but they aren't her friends. we are. i think its good that she'f riends with them but when we&nbsp; really need her why do they take her away from us. that really makes me mad!!!</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","I'm 95% sure that I will be leaving Mount Pleasant before the summer is through, or even possibly mid-year, after first semester. My mother made me an offer I can't refuse. My mom and Step-dad are selling our house because they want to move to Hartland into a bigger house. My parents said that I can HAVE their house, all I have to pay for is $400 a month plus utilities. My brother would still live there and Abby would move in with me. $400 split between 3 people. 3 bedroom house, 2 bathrooms, huge kitchen, all to me, abby, and my brother. Of course, that means I have to transfer to Eastern, which is fine with me. I don't feel like I have anything holding me to Mount Pleasant. I need to get away from all the negativity and drama in my life. I want to be closer to my family because I do miss them, and they've been some of the only people who have cared about my existence in the past few months. I'm just sick of waiting for people to come around again. I've heard from abby, several times might I add, about people talking about how they don't like me. that's fine, I really don't care, i'm over it, i'm moving on. they're the ones stuck in their hate for me. I'm done apologizing for what I have done, I'm not doing it anymore. So i'm leaving. and i don't want anyone to write comments in my lj because they feel guilty or because they think i need attention, because my mind's already made up.

all i have to do is get out of my lease, arrange some things with central and eastern, and move back home."

"event","List seven songs you are into right now. No matter what the genre, whether they have words, or even if they're any good, but they must be songs you're really enjoying now. Post these instructions in your Livejournal along with your seven songs. Then tag seven other people to see what they're listening to.
 
1. Tori Amos- Silent All These Years.
""Years go by will I still be waiting for somebody else to understand? Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty and the orange clouds raining in head. Years go by will I choke on my tears till finally there is nothing left? One more casualty you know we're too easy easy easy""
-Just a beautiful song

2. The Veronicas- 4.Ever.
""Come with me tonight we could make the night last forever, come on baby we aint gonna live forever let me show you all the things that we could do, you know you wanna be together
and I wanna spend the night with you""
- It's Mindy's fault that I love this song so much now. It really has no significance in my life except that I heard it at EVERY keremy party mindy and I attended last year, and it will forever remind me of the Mindah.

3. Sin With Sebastian- Shut Up And Sleep With Me.
""Don't you listen to those old conventions, no try to suppress your real intentions, you're open minded, at least that's what you keep on sayin', don't be afraid of doing what you're best at""
- This song is just funny

4. Regina Spektor- Braille.
""She was lying on the floor and counting stretch marks, she hadn't been a virgin and he, hadn't been a god, so she names the baby Elvis, to make up for the royalty he lacked""
- Her music requires thought and I really like that. it's not simple pop music, and I need that sometimes. I also like how she compares stretch marks to braille.

5. Bob Dylan- Lay Lady Lay.
""Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed. Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead. I long to see you in the morning light. I long to reach for you in the night. Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead""
- This is a significant song for both Abby and I. We want a big brass bed so we can lay in it and sing this song to eachother.

6. Ani DiFranco- Sorry I Am.
""And I don't know what it is about you, I just know it's not what it was, I don't know why red fades before blue it just does, and I don't know what it is about me, that I just can't keep still, I keep thinking someday I will make this all up to you, and maybe someday I will""
- This is my song for Mindy, Ani puts my feelings into words so well.

7. Melissa Etheridge & Indigo Girls- You Can Sleep While I Drive.
""You know I've seen it before, this mist that covers your eyes, you've been looking for something that's not in your life, my intentions are true, won't you take me with you
and baby you can sleep while I drive""
- Reminds me of just wanting to pack up and move away, something that has been appealing to me more and more. i almost can't wait for college to be over so i can get out of this state.

i'm not tagging anyone, if you want to do it, do it.

ps- ani has a new album coming out august 6th!"

it'll be nice to just have one place, where all my stuff is now.

today, i have to go to abby's graduation. her parents and grandparents are going to be there. i've met her mother but not her father. and her grandparents....don't exactly know about me yet. it shall be amusing today.

working full time at wendy's. sick.

mindy brought me chocolates at work yesterday because i was having such a bad day and pretty much having a nervous breakdown on the phone with her. it was sweet. what was even funnier is that abby came to visit me on my break and she brought me food she had made and also some twizlers. it was ironic that both mindy and abby got me candy to make me feel better.

i wanted to go to kristen's party last night but i ended up having to work a 10 hour shift since beth wouldn't stay because she's a bitch.

i'm in a rediculously silly mood. i think it's because abby is playing motown music and cleaning. we are both a little crazy today, especially with only 3 hours of sleep.

until later folks..."

"event","life has been good to me lately, like extra good. what the hell did i do to deserve such luck? i have no fucking clue...

it has been nice to be in a relationship with someone outside of my circle of friends. this new idea of an actual ""private life"" is an interesting one. i like not sharing every little nuiance of my relationship, or to have my relationship play out in front of an audience. the relationship feels more secure, and seems to mean more to me this way. i really like it.

and i also feel it's not necessary to write about my relationship in my livejournal, which for me, is a first. abby and i know what is going on, and that's all that really matters. she also doesn't need me to write in my journal about her. she knows how i feel about certain things, and i know how she feels. i am just so happy with her, and that's all y'all need to know:)

so anyway, i am SO ready for school to be over. i am seriously lagging behind in my classes. i just don't want to do anything anymore. i have 1 more quiz in logic, 1 more quiz in poly sci, and 2 more papers due. it's so tempting to just blow it all off.

gsa elections are tonight. jenny told me jokingly that she was going to the office of res life at 8am tomorrow morning to sign over everything to ben and i, and then getting us together as quickly as possible to sign over the bank account. she's so ready to be done, as are so many other people. and i believe i am ready. it shall be interesting.

i guess that's it for now. oh yeah, except i'm getting drunk tonight to celebrate after elections at kristens. it will be the first time i've been drunk in the middle of the week since freshman year.

"event","last night was the most emotional night i've had in a really long time. mindy and i talked after i got out of work. we both started out a little hostile to eachother but by the end, we were talking like we always had, like best friends. we were laughing and carrying on like nobody's business. she told me that she had missed me, and i told her that i missed her too. i learned a lot of things from our 2 1/2 hour conversation, a lot of things that confirmed for us both that we weren't right for eachother. because of my jealousy and control issues, i kept her from a lot, she was almost under lock and key, and that's not fair to anyone. and she never told me a lot of the things she had heard, or thought about me before last night, and it was completely dumped on me last night. i guess what hurt the most was finding out about all the people who are nice to my face, but then talk shit about me, and hate me. to be fair, i expected it. i honestly left there wanting to move pretty par away. i had no idea that so many people dislike me, and my new biggest fear is that word will spread and nobody will show up to gsa next year.

so i left, and i started thinking about everything mindy and i have ever done together. i was sobbing for the next 2 hours, but it was a good cry. i still care about mindy and still love her but i'm not in love with her, and no matter what anyone says, we spent everyday for almost a year together, and it's hard to break out of that and not feel some sort of pain. mindy and i talked again and i apologized for everything and we were both crying. we both came to the understanding that we want to be friends, because as she put it, we have the potential to be great friends, and we are both going to need some time before that happens. 

i woke up this morning feeling much better about everything"

So now I say the things I want to say
Sometimes it's better letting go this way
I'll always know
Down in my soul
We really had so far to go
I've given all I had to give
And now it's time for me to live
And I won't look back
And I won't regret
Though hurts like hell
Someday I will forget

And this is letting go
This is letting go 
This is letting go
This is letting go"

so here it is; a lot of people thought we were happy together, we were at times, mindy more than myself. we did have a good relationship if one was looking from the outside. we probably looked like the perfect couple, but we were far from that. we had been having problems for a while, problems that neither of us talked about outside of our own relationship, and sometimes even within. i had been unhappy for weeks, and about 2 weeks before i cheated on mindy, i told her that i was having problems. that i was becoming bored with our relationship, and that i wasn't sure that i loved her anymore. i was never excited about anything anymore, and pretty depressed. i'm sure that most people would have never guessed that i was unhappy, because i don't like to show it. i'm not a very emotional person. some of this might sound selfish to most people, but honestly, i can't sacrafice being completely unhappy forever. everyone deserves to be happy, and the truth is i did treat mindy like shit. i had been treating her like shit for a while, it was my way of showing my dissatisfaction with our relationship, albeit, a terrible way. i wasn't treating her like shit in front of everyone else, because, i'll be honest, i care about how i am percieved by everyone else. i'm sure if i was doing and saying the things that i had said to her in public instead of in private, everyone would have thought a break up was necessary, as did i. our differences, something that originally attracted me to mindy, ended up creating more problems, and in the end, i believe, caused my loss of feelings. it's interesting how the most trivial of differences end up being the most catastrophic. 

fast forward to saturday night, yes i made a mistake. i should have broken up with mindy before anything ever happened. but i can't go back and change anything. i'm sorry that i've hurt her this bad, and that there isn't anything that can make it better. i know she knows that we aren't right for eachother. she can find someone who will love everything about her, just as i once did. i like abby a lot, and eventhough i have no idea where she and i are headed, i feel like moving on is the best thing for both mindy and i. some might criticize me for moving on quickly, but, in my defense, i had been ready to for a while, i just didn't go about it in the right manner.

so i'm sick of seeing pitchforks and fire everytime i walk into a room with people who were friends with both of us. i'm laying low for a lot of reasons. there's a lynch mob out to get me, wouldn't you hide? i need most of this time to myself. i'm feeling like a puppy dog that just peed on the carpet. i knew it was wrong, but i did it anyway, and now i'm hanging my head because i'm recieving nothing but angry screams.

so i'm sorry"

"event","it's quite interesting to be public enemy number one. what's even more interesting is that besides the fact that a lot of people hate me, somehow my private life has become the vehicle for judgement on my ability to be a leader. how does that happen? i am conjuring up images of bill clinton as i type. so since apparently i can't be a leader now because i fucked up my relationship that has nothing to do with my ability to lead, i guess i'm going to do all those people who don't want me to be co-president next year a favor. i'm officially withdrawing my nomination. i will have nothing to do with the GSA from now on."

"event","tonight mindy and i went to a presentation from a ""Dr."" on why ""natural sex"" is best and why contraception has caused the problems of our society. 

this woman was re-god-damn-diculous if you ask me.

first she defines ""natural sex"" as sex without contraception, with someone you love and want to spend the rest of your life with, as well as sex for procreation. she advocates abstaining from sex unless it is for procreation, even within a marriage. 

these are some interesting quotes from the presentation;
while showing graphs from the UN about population rates, which helped ""prove"" her point, she says. ""Don't trust the UN, I don't"", so therefore, by discrediting what she is citing in her presentation, she discredits her entire presentation because an argument cannot be valid if any of the premises to the argument are false. 1 point for me.

""Elle Magazing, a feminist magazine says......."" when was the last time ""Elle"" magazine was catagorized as a feminist magazine? she obviously does not understand the feminists viewpoints. i am not claiming to know all of the feminist viewpoints, but i know for sure that they frown upon exploitation of women, and therefore shun most magazines such as vogue and glamour because of the emphasis put upon women to be objectified by men. dear ""Dr. Janet"", just because a magazine is marketed to women more than men, does not make it a ""feminist"" magazine. 1 point for me.

she also claimed during the presentation that since clyamydia and syphilis rates are increasing faster than HIV rates, that we should be focusing more of our money and research on those diseases. okay, 1. we already know how to cure those diseases. 2. ""Dr. Janet"" is what i would like to call, a member of the religious right, which is apparent becuase of the strong religious overtones of the discussion, the religious right is the main advocacy group that wants to shut planned parenthood down. planned parenthood is the nations largest provider of STD treatment. it doesn't make sense for her to say we should focus more on clyamydia and preventing and treating it, when people such as herself, advocate the distruction of an organization at the forefront of doing such a thing. 1 point for me.

so anyway, i disagree, and i feel better now that i pointed out contradictions in her argument.
i love you all goodnight.

"event","so tonight at work i was rushing around and ended up cutting my index finger with a corer for the tomatos. this little thing has several sharp prongs in a circle that take out the core of the tomato before we slice them, well i went to grab it and slipped and ran my finger down the prongs. ouch. i have 8 perfectly straight lines across the top of my index finger. only one of them cut enough to bleed. but it looks like i tried to commit suicide, lol.

in other news, the drag show is coming up on friday. we've been practicing like hell. everybody better watch out, cuz nsync is back in the house, that's all i have to say.

i have basically a week and a half off of work for pride week. not intentionally, but drew didn't schedule me so fuck him. i can't wait for pride week. paul wesselman is doing a workshop on how to bring christian communities together with the gay community, that'll be cool.

mindy has been sick. she hasn't had a period in about 3 months and she's had constant stomach issues. i spent all day taking care of her and running around town to get her various things.

my new phone is on backorder. i don't know when i'll get it, hopefully soon.

i'm running unopposed for GSA co-prez. so i can't lose, after elections, it's official.

went to triangle in flint last night with a few lovely ladies:) it was fun, but not my kind of place. i've definitely decided that i like to dance to techno more than rap. the ride home was fun. the girls dared me to drive over the zilwaukee bridge without using my hands and i did it. i know, we are lame.

i'm going to start working out since i have this free time. i've lost 22 lbs. since the beginning of may 05', without working out and just eating better. i'm 10 lbs. away from my goal so i want to start working out to get there. i do not have a single pair of pants that fit me anymore, if i don't wear a belt, they fall right off with 2 steps and my belt is on the tightest hole and my pants are still lose. so to remedy this, i'm buying new pants on tuesday with zack!:)

i would like to finish this entry with a ""shout out"" to my wonderful girlfriend. i love her, she is the best, and you all know it! boo ya."

"event","i got a brand new, 30gb, color, video, photo, ipod for free yesterday. and all because my other one died. suck on that bitches!

my girlfriend is asleep right now, and i took cute pictures of her, because honestly, she is the most beautiful person to watch sleep. she'd probably kill me if i showed them to anyone though.

we went shopping yesterday becuase both of our tax returns came in. she was so excited and it was a lot of fun. mindy bought some new pants and shirts, ohhh and some sexy underwear from vic secrets. she actually has pants that fit her now, and i can see that ass better now, whoot whoot for me:) i guess i shouldn't objectify her like that but hell, she likes it too. he he, right baby?

mindy and i are fine. we had quite the fight on tuesday/wednesday. basically a complete miscommunication. i still have a lingering feeling that erika and jen hate me, eventhough they have said otherwise. but whatever, it wouldn't be the first time.

it's been a busy day/week. i'm ready for school to be over eventhough i love it. i might have a straight set of 4 poly sci classes next semester because i'm done with my UP's. that'll really test my love i guess, especially with the intro to imperical research methods class that i've heard is absolutely dreadful.

DC was fucking amazing, exhausting, stimulating, frustrating, and fabulous all at the same time. in short, drank too much, was over caffinated the entire time, sang drunken kareoke and managed to STILL be the best singer there, and did important stuff with HRC too.

already making plans for this summer. might be taking a road trip to New Orleans at the end of may with a few GSA people. i don't think the steering committee can say no to me anymore, i am pretty sure that i've secured the position. plus, june will be crazy because of having to run all the pride's in michigan, then there's hotter than july, and then before i know it, school starts again. somewhere in between, i have to find time for a few people that i need to see. plus, i still need to work a lot this summer.

i should probably update this thing more often, i still assume that everyone knows what is going on in my life, but they don't. i kinda like it that way.

i can't think of anything else, so that's all you get for now"

"event","so, my father and i were discussing the idea of my being president one day. i was joking with him and he said, ""you'd never get voted in, only the rich people get voted into office"". and i thought about that and determined that mostly, that is true. would anyone from a college lesser than yale or harvard be elected by the general populous? i don't know. so then for my psc105 class, we read an article about how people aren't voting and yadda yadda. the article explored reasons why only half the eligible voters vote, and they pointed out the apathy towards people who don't care about ""them"" (mostly middle class and poor voters)and how, in order to increase voter turnout, we need candidates that are approachable and come from the same background as the poor and middle class america, which got me thinking, someone not from a well-to-do background should run. any takers?"

workin like a dog. mindy told me she was proud of me the other day and that she looked up to me because anytime wendy's calls me to come in early or pick up a shift i do it because we need it, which i thought was sweet of her. she says even though she knows that picking up an extra shift at microtel would be beneficial to our finances, that she is extemely apprehensive about doing it, and she looks up to me for always saying yes even when i haven't slept or something. she's cute.

speaking of the princess, we're doing great. we haven't had an actual significant fight in a few months now. and we are sappy and loooovvvveee eachother:)

phil and i decided that cagdas and mindy should form a support group because phil and i are the A type personalities, the dominant, work a holics, spending more time with gsa that them, and they are the small, cute, neglected partners forcing to deal with mine and phil's overachieveing tendancies.

i'm running for gsa co-pres, and at the same time, being concidered for a position on the HRC detroit steering committee. which is by the way, sweet. phil, ben d. and i had our interviews today with the HRC detroit governors and i swear it was more nerve wracking than any other interview i've ever had. i can't wait to hear back from them.

i'm going to see erin next weekend/beginning of the week. if brokeback is still in the theatre, i'm taking erin to see it. she must. i'm forcing her. and i'm going to class with her, hopefully, and if not, i'm going anyway.

dr baugh came up to me the other day and told me that i need to start speaking my opinion in the class. i've stayed quiet because it's psc105 and i know all the shit and she knows i know all the shit but apparently she wants a ""strong female voice"" in the class, and i'm apparently it. i heart her. i'm going to make her sign my major with me.

i got to see the wonderful jillian suidan today. and i've officially decided that i'm moving into jenny's house for the month of june because of all the PRIDE's the steering  committee will be in charge of planning. and i'm stealing jill as my new sister.

ferndale is amazing and i can't believe i had never been to just for us. i'm lame. i bought 3 new gay stickers there though. they say 'hate is not a family value"" ""homophobia is a social disease"" and the other is a mudflap girl in rainbow. hot.

"event","Things I Hate:

1. people named john lee clary who claim to not be racist or bigoted anymore and go around making speeches about how un-racist he is, then write's on his website, and i quote ""In almost all homosexual relationships between men, one acts like the macho man and the other acts like a sissified pansy. In lesbian relationships, usually one has the role of the butch bull dyke, who suffers from the ""I wanna be a man syndrome"", and the other plays the role of the submissive female. Can you imagine the ridicule that poor child has to go through from other children? Can you picture how a child has their bull dyke lesbian ""parent"" come to school to pick them up, and the other kids see a female dressed like a man, wearing comfortable shoes, a sleeveless muscle shirt, short hair with grease in it, with a wallet and comb in her back pocket, hairy legs and a moustache! Or a child's ""mother figure"" shows up and it is a limp-wristed pansy talking all effeminate and sashaying around like the wimp that he is! That child is put through hell because the parents the child lives with are perverts who can not control their unnatural desires."" as well as, ""Hey Muslim! This is America! Love it and love Jesus or Get Out!""  http://www.johnnyleeclary.com/

2. Neo-Nazi's for making one of their ""rules"" that and i quote, ""Domestic violence and the abuse of our children will not and can not be tolerated"", they even say that rapes/child molestation will be punished by death. then they go and make a man by the name of John Edward Snyder, a convicted sex offender, to lead their youth unit. smart.

3. people who have no interest in politics whatsoever. way to be a waste of human flesh.

4. my car for constantly costing me hundreds of dollars for stupid fucking repairs.

5. alarm clocks, especially mindy's. that damn thing is so fucking loud i just want to beat it with a sharp object.

6. people who like bill o reilly, ann coulter, georgie bush, newt gingrich, sean hannity, the pope, tom delay, jesse helms, ect. because they ""are down with jesus""

7. people with fat asses.

8. when my girlfriend, who is in love with hilary duff and hates lindsay lohan, listens to lindsay lohan, sings her songs, then claims that she doesn't like her.

9. when gay boys don't know how to dance.

10. when kitain poops and it fills mindy's apartment with the most disgusting stench, therefore forcing mindy and i to open her window and take turns sucking in clean, fresh air, so as to not die.

Things That Make Me Happy:

1. Melinda Sue Versluys

2. peeing in the shower because it's fun to gross mindy out and make her run towards the back of the shower so as to not get in the way of my long stream of urine.

3. Watching the L Word, getting turned on by the sex scenes, then doing it.

4. the look on mindy's face when i do something really special for her.

5. faking a doctors appointment so i can turn a paper in online instead of getting my ass out of bed and turning it in at class. i really just wanted to sleep for another hour.

6. when mindy's mom cuts my hair. it's free, and she is an amazing hair cutter upper.

7. remembering how much fun it is to talk on the phone for 2 hours to your best friend, because you haven't talked a significant amount in 2 months.

8. having fantasies of living in hawaii, on a beach off the side of the road, living in a van with best friend. we are such rebels.

9. wearing boxer brief's that are suppose to look good on men, but look better on me.

10. liberals."

"event","so, for the first time in a long time i feel fat. i know, i'm not ""fat' per se. but that's how i feel. i've been eating like a fucking cow and i don't even have the excuse of pms to back me up. rarr. it's pissing me off because i sit on my ass all day. eating so much wouldn't be such a problem if i would move my ass besides going to class and work. i seriously need to start going to the sac or something.

i will not be a fat heffer any longer.

ps- dear liz, my ass will be more than fabulous next time you see me:)"

went shopping at meijer last night for 3 hours! you know you're becoming an adult when you can spend the same amount of time and money as your mother does in that store. mindy and i were overly excited about the fact that we needed a cart. i know, we're lame.

Planning Pride week for April is coming along well. we're shooting big this year and it is going to turn out great.

i'm applying for scholarships through the point foundation. they gonna give me money cuz i'm gay, whoot whoot!

mindy and i are getting a shared cell phone plan so she can contact the outside world and so i won't think she's dead everytime she's more than 1/2 an hour late home from work.

"event","Why must one suffer through this thing they call school? Ok, I get it, it's suppose to help us in ""the real world"". You know what would help me in the real world? Actually being allowed to live in the real world not how to solve quadratic equations and remember every fact about an election that happened 100 years ago. I know that its suppose to help us become more well rounded people, but wouldn't letting us decide what we want to learn be a lot more useful? If that was the case I wouldn't complain about school because I could just take English classes and be done with it. I don't need all of this other junk to be a journalist. Why do I have to learn it then? Anyway . . . my birthday is in 2 days now and I am very excited. I hope no one forgets it again. Party at my place Saturday whoot whoot . . . ya I don't know what else to talk about. Exams went pretty well I guess. I don't want to start bible class tomorrow. When you have an atheist for a teacher I think the whole concept behind it is lost. Oh ya, and when your headmaster (a priest) steals money from the school. It is perfectly acceptable to learn morals and stuff from these people lemme tell ya. What a weird world we live in."

"event","Jon Toener . . . what am I going to do with that boy? I'm just trying to understnad why you say you hate Jamie? I thought she was your friend. I thought I was your friend and then you snap at me. I know Jamie hurt you when ya'll broke up but I thought you were over it and you got a new girlfriend and you seemed happy and now this happens. You know what. It's your problem and you have to fix it. I'm just going to pray for you because something is wrong that your not telling me about. 

As for what I was writing earlier . . . I just don't care anymore, and I'm tired of all of the fighting and I would like to drop it thank you very much. I think my room will never be finished because unlike in the world of trading spaces redoing you room in 2 days is not only extremely difficult but IMPOSSIBLE! And tomorrow the torture chamber that is school starts again and I will once again be bombarted with way too much stress for one person to handle let alone when I'm trying to fix my room up for my party on Saturday that might not be happening now because I don't think anyone would want to come. Anyway . . . back to painting."

"event","Ok, I thought the point of this thing was to tell how I feel about things in my life and that's what I've done. The fact that my ""friends"" are all getting mad at me for expressing myself through it is insane. I'm at a time in my life right now when I don't know what to think about different aspects of my life. I'm not the same person I was a month ago. And I'm glad. If my ""friends"" can't understand that and try to accept it I give up. I know that everyone is different and that is what makes us different but sometimes its these differences that cause our downfalls. I'm feel sorry for anyone who was upset by my first entry because it hit to close to home. I know I'm not perfect and I don't claim to be. I'm just worried about all of the people I care about because I hate to see other people ruin their lives. Quite frankly I'm just fed up with the whole idea of friendship in general because I don't understand the concept behind it. Tomorrow I have to go back to school and face all of my friends and it is honestly the last thing in the world I want to do. I would rather sit at home alone and celebrate my 16th birthday alone than be forgotten again like last year. Do you realize that last year on my birthday Chelsea was the only one to even bother giving me a present or making me something on my actual birthday? Everyone else just forgot and gave me something the next day. The next day wasn't my birthday it was just another day and it didn't matter. My friends abandoned me on my special day. What is that all about? I try and try to reach out to ya'll and I feel rejected over and over again. I'm too upset to write about this anymore so I'm going to go cry for a while and maybe I'll write more later."

"event","If I compare my friends from school and those from other places like church and Parker and all his friends and my friends from my past hobby, swimming, many clear differences can be seen. Take my friends from church, my best friends, Allyson, Paul David, and Jamie. I love them so much and they mean the world to me. Do you know why? Because we have the same beliefs, the same opinions about practically everything, the same morals, the same sense of humor, and most importantly we are willing to drop everything just to help each other or be near each other. Like Allyson getting up at 3 in the morning so she could drive all day just to make it home in time to watch the football game with PD and me. Or PD giving me rides everywhere because he knows I can't drive and hate having my parents bring me everywhere. And Jamie who even though she should be my arch rival invites me to parties with only U-High people there just because she cared enough to ask me. Ok, if these are the perfect friends why do I have any others? Parker, Marko, and Ashton are unlike any other people I have ever met. I was forced into a relationship with Marko and Ashton because they were Parker's best friends. If I compare Paul David and Parker his differences would make your headspin. Parker spreads most of the time doing nothing productive inspite of this ambition to be something better, his laziness keeps him from accomplishing anything. Marko and Ashton are very similar in nature, except from Marko is hilariously funny in doing so and Ashton just amuses me for some reason I can't explain. I love them anyway. They inspire me to become a better person every day just because in the long run I don't wan to be like them. I could have my life set for me right now. I could still be with Parker living in my little bubble, but it was really him who made me realize I coudln't live like that anymore. They aren't the angels that Allyson, PD, and Jamie are and I don't expect them to be. I know one day they will come around, but until then I can't do anything to stop them except pray and try to live my life as an example for them. Now, lemme talk about everyone from school. I don't want any of them reading this to be offended because that is not my intention, but I am truely worried about all of you. Ya'll are stuck in the middle and that's the worst place to be. I should know, I've been there. You don't want to be bad because you have a sense of right and wrong but then again you don't want to be good because you want to have fun. I think of ya'll kind of as a shower, not cold enough to help sober you up and not hot enough to help calm you down. Ya'll are lukewarm and comfortable and perfectly content to straddle the thin line seperating good and bad for the rest of eternity. There is no grey area and I am worried because ya'll seem to think there is and there isn't. Ok, sex, drugs, and alcohol are bad, but dont you understand that its not just these things. The term ""love"" is bad, the feelings behind it, motivations behind friendship, gossiping, doublecrossing, lying, deceiving, and being fake. They are all bad! I am worried for all of you because I don't want you to travel to the dark side like several of my afor mentioned friends have. Come into the light. Please. Do it for me. I know that I can't change anyone's mind for them, but I feel that I have to express my opinions about it and hope for the best. Sorry if this was a big waste of your time."

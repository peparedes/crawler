First off, My cousin, He is doing good, he is coming home WEDNESDAY!! When he comes home a nurse will have to come over once a day.  He is still going to be on medication through an IV, so my aunt and uncle had training yesterday for it. So hell be on that for 3 days and then thats it.. The drs said that he doesnt need anymore therapy, but if he ends up needing more they will come to his house and do it. So everything is great!! He was suppose to come home in 10 days, now its wednesday.. so I will see him soon..

For me, nothings been happening, just working, and then took the kids trick or treating yesterday.. Thats about it.. Today Bobby has a game.. Next sunday is his last one. Thank goodness, he is always sooo miserable after football.  Thats it, so if anything happens Ill update.. Byebye"

"event","Well my cousin is doing good. He leaves atlantic city medical center today, goes back to rehab for about 10 days and then goes home! I will probably go up to see him next week, since I know how to get there. It takes an hour though ugg..  He had an infection in his head from all the dirt and that caused the swelling to go back up, which now the infection is clear and the swelling is down.. The doctors said that when he gets out of there he is going to be PERFECTLY FINE! Thank God!!! The only thing right now that looks bad is that he is soo skinny, he just keeps losing weight.. But one, hospital food is nasty, and two Freddie can eat and they only give him small portions.. The way he eats thats like a little snack.. So hopefully soon hell start gaining it back.. and another good thing, which is very exciting.. HE CAN PLAY HOCKEY AGAIN! He is soo happy about that!  I think he has finally given up about him getting back on his 4 wheeler.. He kept fighting about it and now he has realized ya kno, its not a good idea.. My grandmom went up there I think monday, and Sunday night at midnight she was baking him cookies to try and fatten him up.. They have been taking him food, so that he doesnt have to eat that crap.. His hockey team sent him a whole bunch of candy and stuff.. So hes doing good and hell be outta there in no time.. Thank god.. So If anything changes about that Ill update, but I dont think it will...

As for me, I havent really been doing much, just working and stuff like that.. Started xmas shopping and stuff.. I also bought my coat for the year and thats about it.. Oh and Im trying to get a new car lol.. Of course.. I want a 2004 GTO and I think Im almost there.. I just keep mentioning it.. haha.. Well Thats about it for me. Update later Byebye"

This morning I woke up later than usual.. Then I got ready and I was getting dressed and I found out some bad news.. How come when everything seems great something horrible happens.. Well my cousin was doing great, it was honestly a miracle.. He was supposed to be getting out of rehab in a week.. And now I found out that they had to take him back to Atlantic City Medical Center this morning, because the swelling is coming back and he is really confused.. So Hopefully hes fine, but damm.. it was all so perfect, recovering so fast, and then this.. The poor kid.. he was so happy he was gettin out in a week, and he already had plans to go shopping and do this and do that.. He told me Tuesday he wants to go to the outlets in AC near the hospital.. and now hes back in the hospital Its just horrible.. I should of known everything was too good right now.. It sucks..
Well I have to finish getting ready for work.. I was supposed to be there 15 mins ago.. Ill update later.. Goodbye.."

"event","First off, Monday I went to 6 Flags with Adrienne, Joe, Dustin and Nikki.. We had fun.. We didnt ride too many ride because the lines were too long.. But we did ride skull mountain, which was corney. Then we went to the Dolphin show.. It was cute.. When the Dolphin show was over it was dark out so all the people came out, and it was funny.. Because I was trying to act all tough so they wouldnt scare me, I did good with that, but Nikki didnt.. She went screaming and running from this one guy, and she jumped on the Merry Go Round to get away from him.. That was funny. I got home around 10:15. 

Tuesday I just relaxed, then I went up to the hospital to see my cousin.. He looks soo good.. He seems perfectly fine.. I didnt notice anything different about him. Thats soo great! There was this one boy in there, he was his aide, Man, he was cute!!!!! Goodness.. And my cousin roommate was in there, I guess his story is, that he stole his dads car and just went out driving around and hit someone and killed the person.. Uggg, thats soo horrible.. But they both seemed to be doing alright.. The aide was soo cute..

Wednesday I went to work.. ugg.. boring.. then I came home because Bobby was supposed to have practice, So I picked the baby up came home for a little and then took him for a haircut.. He sat through it this time.. Then I went to the field to show my mom and they didnt have practice so I came back home and Im just relaxing.. Im tired, Its been a long week..

Tomorrow I have a dentist appt, and Im probably not doing anything else.. Im going to be lazy tomorrow.

Friday I have to work.. and Im not sure whats going on this weekend.. Maybe something good will come up.. 
Update later on.."

"event","Well My cousin is doing very well, they moved him to the Rehab, he'll be there for a while.. Hes walking better and hes talking alot more and hes not delirious anymore, so hes doing well.. The rehab is in Marlton, and it takes like an hour and a half with NO traffic to get there, so we havent gone yet.. Me and Bob are going Tuesday were leaving at like 2 or 2:30.. He cant have visitors until 4:30 because they work with him all day, Its like being in school, he gets up early, Visitors have to leave at 8:00, because he has to lay down and relax, then shortly after go to sleep.. I think its funny, because what 13 yr old goes to bed at 8:00? Not many.. But hes happier there because hes up and he can get on the computer and hes aloud to call his friends and stuff.. The other night, my aunt took my lil cousins to see him, Austin was really really upset, he doesnt handle that kinda stuff well, they were both crying because looking at him is like a shock.. it doesnt look like him at all.. But he kept telling them ""Stop crying, Im fine"" so they arent too upset.. But everything is good.. Ill let ya know more Tuesday night after I see him.. 

Tomorrow Im not doing really anything, Bobby has a game at 12:00 against Woodstown.. Then I have to run to a couple of stores and get a few things Then thats it.. Im going to come home and relax..

Monday I am going to Six Flags for Fright Fest with Adrienne, Joe and Nikki.. They said something about Frank and Dustin, but Im not sure if they are going or not.. But it doesnt matter who goes Ill have fun... Hopefully its not too scarey lol, or Im going to be running! Nah, Im usually fine until I hear a chainsaw.. Thats when I flip out, and I can hear one coming for a mile away! So Ill have fun.. Were leaving around I guess 12:30 then leaving there around 7 or 8.. So Ill let ya know how it was after I go to see my cousin on Tuesday.. 
Alright Im out.. Going to go finish cleaning up my room.. I made a very big mess..
Love yas.. Faren*"

"event","Well first off, Aparently my cousin looks a lot better than he did.. My parents went to see him today.  The other day he was really delirious from the medicine still being in his system.. It was funny.. He looked at his dad and said ""Look at that dumbass"" and hes never cussed before so my uncle was like ""What?"" and freddie said Look at that dumbass and my uncle said that dumbass and he said the dumbass standing in the puddle.. and he was in the hospital so there was no puddle or ""dumbass"" so it was pretty amusing.. And Freddie had a cup of tea and he my uncle went to go pour it out, he poured it into the toilet and flushed it and freddie looks at my aunt and said Thats nice hes just pissing infront of us.. So its been pretty funny at the hospital.. I havent gone up yet because Im sick and he doesnt need to catch it.. So Ill probably go one day this week after Im all better..

Today I didnt do anything I sat around the house and just relaxed because I feel like Shit! Im coughing and sneezing and my eyes are watering and I had a sore throat, the sore throat went away.. But I just feel horrible.. I dont even know how long Ill be working tomorrow because if I still feel like this Ill probably go home..  Well Im about to get off here and try to go to sleep early because Im sooo tired.. 
Love yas,

My cousin is doing pretty good, He is fully awake and then had him up walking today, not for long because I guess his legs were hurting.. He was talking some more today.. Yesterday is when he first talked so My aunt stayed at the hospital over night incase he woke up so he wasnt alone.. and cuz she was excited that he was talking.. lol but everyone was!

Tomorrow Bobby has a game, he has to be at the field at 2 for practice then his game is at 4 in Bridgeton.. So I will have the baby.. yeah.. This football is really a pain in the ass.. Then tomorrow night I dunno what Im doing, probably nothing.. unless someone wants to chill..

"event","Well not much to update, Just that My cousin developed pneumonia in one lung last night. ugg.. and he still doesnt have any movement on his left side of his body, like if you tell him to move his arm he cant, but today when the nurse gave him a bath, when the cool water hit his left arm he starting moving it and trying to get his arm away from the wash cloth, which is better, they still have him knocked out.. They will probably be waking him up soon, if the pneumonia clears up quick.. 

Today I went to work for a few hours, then ran over to the mall because I wanted this Dooney and Bourke purse so bad so I went and bought it, It was alot.. Then I picked up my little cousins from their bus stop then brought them to my house.  Around 4 their grandmom picked them up and we were going to go up to the hospital tonight but then it was to late, because visiting hours are only from 5-530 and then 8-830, so it would of been pointless to go and not even be able to see him.. So instead we got Taco Bell we just got done eating and now Im about to go watch a movie and then get back online around 10 or so, because thats when the guy I like usually gets on.. Ill update later if anything happens..

I thought is was gonna be fun, and I spent ALOT of money on prom, and it was just so boring. They kept playing Mexican music and spanish music, and i dont care if they mix it up and shit, but thats all they played! And the food wasnt good, so. I wont be going to prom again. It just definetly wasnt worth the money! Then after prom me and age were suppose to drink, but we were so tired and pissed off about prom we didnt, we just went to bed, we were so miserable.  Then this morning, I got up around 10 and just sat around and did nothing at all. I didnt even get dressed today, im still in my PJs So yeah..

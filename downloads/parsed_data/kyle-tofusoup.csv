"event","No updates for a long time, or at least it seems as though it's been a long time. I got a job at Kroger as a bagger and I hate it. But it's money, and now I can start buying CDs again. We got a new computer, a good one, and now I can play games on it. So I bought World of Warcraft. And it has sucked away my entire life. All I have done this summer is work and play WoW. Work. WoW. Sleep. Repeat. And that is&nbsp;not necessarily&nbsp;a bad thing, because I don't sit around in a dissatisfied bored stuppor all day and eat. I eat two meals a day, if that. So I'll probably hopefully maybe lose some fatness. 

So that's pretty much all that's been going on this summer. I hope the world at a large is leading a more productive summer than I am."

"event","Anuther one of those days. I got about 7.5 hours of sleep last night but I was exhausted all day. My parents think that I am on that lame heroin + Tylenol PM, ""cheese"", that's been all over the news because drowsiness is a sign. As if. I woke up this morning with the weirdest feeling that I don't feel I can fully articulate in a LiveJournal entry. I woke up with the weird feeling that I didn't belong in the room I was in. It was like reality was bending in and out of comprehension. It all seemed very detached. Maybe I was stuck in a dream, I don't know. Anyway, that lasted for about twenty minutes. Also, I had Slowdive's ""Some Velvet Morning"" stuck in my head, which, oddly enough, seemed to fit that weird experience perfectly."

"event","I saw that Alexis posted an old Cherokee myth on MySpace and so I'm gonna post some old Creek myths and legends, me being roughly one sixteenth Creek:<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3 align=""center"">THE CREATION OF THE EARTH<br /></h3><p>In the beginning the waters covered everything. It was said ""Who will make the land appear?""</p> <br /><p>Lock-chew, the Crawfish, said: ""I will make the land appear.""</p> <p>So he went down to the bottom of the water and began to stir up the mud with his tail and hands. He then brought up the mud to a certain place and piled it up.</p> <p>The owners of the land at the bottom of the water said:</p> <p>""Who is disturbing our land?"" They kept watch and discovered the Crawfish. Then they came near him, but he suddenly stirred the mud with his tail so that they could not see him.</p> <p>""Lock-chew continued his work. He carried mud and piled it up until at last he held up his hands in the air, and so the land appeared above the water.</p> <p>The land was soft. It was said: ""Who will spread out the land and make it dry and hard?"" Some said: ""Ah-yok, the Hawk, should spread out the soft land and make it dry."" Others said ""Yah-tee, the Buzzard, has larger wings; he can spread out the land and make it dry and hard.""</p> <p>Yah-tee undertook to spread out and dry the earth. He flew above the earth and spread out his long wings over it. He sailed over the earth; he spread it out. After a long while he grew tired of holding out his wings. He began to flap them, and thus he caused the hills and valleys because the dirt was still soft.</p> <p>""Who will make the light?"" it was said. It was very dark.</p> <p>Yohah, the Star, said, ""I will make the light.""</p> <p>It was so agreed. The Star shone forth. It was light only near him.</p> <p>""Who will make more light?"" it was said.</p> <p>Shar-pah, the Moon, said: ""I will make more light."" Shar-pah made more light, but it was still dark.</p> <p>T-cho, the Sun, said: ""You are my children, I am your mother, I will make the light. I will shine for you.""</p> <p>She went to the east. Suddenly light spread over all the earth. As she passed over the earth a drop of blood fell from her to the ground, and from this blood and earth sprang the first people, the children of the Sun, the Uchees.</p> <p>The people wished to find their medicine. A great monster serpent destroyed the people. They cut his head from his body. The next day the body and head were together. They again slew the monster. His head again grew to his body.</p> <p> </p>  <p>Then they cut off his head and placed it on top of a tree, so that the body could not reach it. The next morning the tree was dead and the head was united to the body. They again severed it and put it upon another tree. In the morning the tree was dead and the head and body were reunited.</p> <p>The people continued to try all the trees in the forest. At last they placed the head over the Tar, the cedar tree, and in the morning the head was dead. The cedar was alive, but covered with blood, which had trickled down from the head.</p> <p>Thus the Great Medicine was found.</p> <p>Fire was made by boring with a stick into a hard weed.</p> <p>The people selected a second family. Each member of this family had engraved on his door a picture of the sun.</p> <p>In the beginning all the animals could talk, and but one language was used. All were at peace. The deer lived in a cave, watched over by a keeper and the people were hungry. He selected a deer and killed it. But finally the deer were set free and roved over the entire earth.</p> <p>All animals were set free from man, and names were given to them, so that they could be known.</p><br /><br /><br /><h3 align=""center"">HOW DAY AND NIGHT WERE DIVIDED</h3>  <p>The animals held a meeting and No-koos-see (Nokosi), the Bear, presided.</p> <p>The question was, how to divide day and night.</p> <p>Some desired the day to last all the time; others wished it all night. After much talk, Chew-thlock-chew (Tci<strike>l</strike>oktco), the ground squirrel, said:</p> <p>""I see that Woot-Kew (Wotko), the Coon, has rings on his tail divided equally, first a dark color then a light color. I think day and night ought to be divided like the rings on Woot-Kew's tail.""</p> <p>The animals were surprised at the wisdom of Chew-thlock-chew. The adopted his plan and divided day and night like the rings on Woot-Kew's tail, succeeding each other in regular order.</p> <p>No-koos-see from envy scratched the back of Chew-thlock-chew and thus caused the stripes on the back of all his descendants, the ground squirrels.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 align=""center"">THE ONLY SON AND RABBIT <br /></h3>  <p>A widow had an only son, whom she cautioned never to pass beyond the mountains, which were in sight of her home. ""My boy, never pass the mountains, never go beyond,"" was her constant warning.</p> <p>One day while hunting he reached the top of the mountains and on looking into the valley beneath he saw a lovely city, surrounded by green meadows, lakes, and groves. He was tempted to visit so lovely a spot and yielded. He saw scenes of beauty and fair maidens.</p> <p>When he returned home in the evening he sat by himself and looked lonesome and his mother saw from his manner that something unusual had occurred.</p> <p>""My son, you have passed beyond the mountains."" ""I have, mother; I had beautiful visions.""</p>  <p>""Ah,"" sighed his mother, ""that is why I warned you. All who see the lovely city are never contented elsewhere. I knew home would<a name=""page_18""><font size=""1"" color=""GREEN""><br /></font></a></p> <p>lose its attractions when you wandered over the mountains. Since it must be so I will do all I can for you.""</p> <p>The next day she made for her son a wonderful costume. She sent him to the forest to catch all manner of singing birds. She made for him also a flute. When all of her preparations were completed, she arrayed her son in the new costume and arranged for him a peculiar headdress, on which sat the singing birds.</p> <p>""Now try your flute,"" she said, and at the first sound of the flute, the birds began to sing, keeping time to the music of their master.</p> <p>""Go, my son, to the beautiful city beyond the mountains. When within the city, ask for the council of the king and as you enter the, council ground play on your flute, while your singing birds accompany you.""</p> <p>He passed the mountain and as he approached the city he began to play, while the birds sang. The crowd which gathered and watched the stranger with the wonderful birds told him where the king dwelt. He entered the council, playing on his flute, while his birds sang.</p> <p>A seat of honor was offered the musical stranger and all were enraptured with his music. Ere he had been there long, no honor was too great for him and everyone strove to do him some kindness. Soon it was rumored that the daughter of the king was to be given as a bride to the young stranger.</p> <p>One day he invited the king and his council to go with him to a river near the city. On reaching the stream he quickly cast aside his costume, plunged into the water and dived under and crossed the river four times, when all the fish came to the surface and were killed with arrows and a great feast was enjoyed.</p> <p>The Rabbit, envious of the wonderful stranger, had followed the crowd and while all were intent on killing the fish, he stole the costume of the musical youth and ran away to the woods. On coming out of the river the garments could not be found. No one knew what had become of them.</p> <p>The next day when the council was assembled, behold the Rabbit strutted in, puffing and blowing with all his might at the flute and, as the birds would not utter a note, he hit at them and said: ""Why don't you sing?"" He was dressed in the costume of the stranger and before he could be seized he said: ""Well, come with me to the river and let us enjoy another feast.""</p> <p>Away he ran and the council followed him. In he jumped, casting the costume and flute on the ground, and though he crossed four times under the water not a fish appeared.</p> <p>As his head came above the water they all cried:</p><dir> <dir>  <p>It is the lying Rabbit.<br /> It is the lying Rabbit.<br /> Seize him, seize him.<br /><br /></p></dir> </dir>   <p>He was tried by the council and chased from the council ground as an envious and rascally deceiver.</p> <p>The king's daughter was married to the wonderful stranger and, as their hands were joined, the singing birds flapped their wings and sang with wild melody.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><h3 align=""center"">TURKEY, TURTLE, AND RATTLESNAKE<br /></h3>  <p>Once upon a time the beasts, birds, and reptiles held a council to devise means of destroying their enemy, Man. It was decided that he must die. The Rattlesnake, being the most poisonous, was chosen</p>  <p>to kill him; the Turtle was selected to bite off his scalp lock; while the Turkey was to run away with it. In accordance with this arrangement the three repaired to the cabin of Man during the night and while he was asleep. The Rattlesnake coiled himself up near the door, so that he could strike Man as he came out, the Turtle took a position round the corner of the house, and the Turkey stationed himself behind it.</p> <p>When morning came Man awoke and stepped out. The Rattlesnake heard him coming and when he was sufficiently near struck his fangs deep into his leg. Man fell down and died. Then the Turtle crawled up to his head and after much labor bit off the scalplock, and the Turkey seized it and ran off with it. In his race he accidentally swallowed the scalplock, and ever since a scalplock has grown from the breast of the Turkey in honor of that event.</p>"

I was in some kind of astral world, in the woods. It seemed like daytime but the sky was dark royal blue and the stars were all incredibly visible. I was running through the wood and then I jumped. Into outer space. Then I just floated to a planet. But I chose which planet to go to. I went to that planet as easily as I might walk to 7-Eleven down the street. I don't remember what the planet was like, because I woke up shortly thereafter.

Very bright, vivid dream. Lots of colors.

Today was one of those days.

I didn't get enough sleep, so my mother was literally screaming to get me up. I had gross oatmeal that had several heart-healthy ingredients that I can't pronounce. I lost my I.D. card, so no lunch. To add insult to injury, I found that card in Newspaper... the period after lunch. I had to stay for band until 4:30, then Driver's Ed from 5:00-7:00. So I couldn't come home to satiate my hunger from having nasty oatmeal and no lunch. Driver's Ed was a nightmare. I answered 84 questions in an exhausted stupor for two hours in a silent, cold room.

And my hair was feeling abnormally greasy.

"event","<i>I WATCH T.V.<br/><br/></i>I find it annoying when the privileged suburban asshole wannabe-intellectual morons that think they're smarter than you try to put forth the notion that T.V. makes people zombies that revolve their lives around it, and thus think that by boycotting it they're making some sort of statement.<br/><br/>Television does not make people revolve their schedules around it. <u>Weak-minded people</u> who have <u>nothing better to do</u> let television control their lives. It is not television's fault. Many creative, artistic, intelligent, and comedic minds are attracted to T.V. The majority of television shows are better than the majority of movies.<br/><br/>So, self-righteous douchebags of suburban America, please do us all a favor and <b>shut up</b>."

"event","I saw 300 last night. <br/><br/>No, that's not right.<br/><br/>I <i>experienced </i>300 last night.<br/><br/>I will not hesitate to label it the greatest motion picture I have ever seen. I love artsy, stylistic adaptations of comic books and graphic novels (except Spawn, unfortunately), and 300 does it so <u>perfectly</u>. It follows the comic almost verbatim, which is a good thing. Blood splashes, heads fly. It is so amazing. It is a visual punch in the face. The color and contrast and cinematic detail in that movie is astounding.<br/><br/>Critics say that it's artfully excessive, that it lacks heart. But that misses the point. It is supposed to be visually excessive. And it does not lack heart. Reading the reviews for this movie has convinced me that whatever critics have to say does not matter. This movie was executed perfectly. Sin City, and now this. Frank Miller is God.<br/><br/>If you have not experienced this movie, you are doing yourself a grave misjustice."

"event","<font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL""> The universe (he said) is the Great All, and offers a paradox too great for the finite mind to grasp. As the living brain cannot conceive of a non-living brain - although it may think it can - the finite mind cannot grasp the infinite. </font><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">The prosaic fact of the universe's existence alone defeats both the pragmatic and the romantic. There was a time, yet a hundred generations before the world moved on, when mankind had achieved enough technical and scientific prowess to chip a few splinters from the great stone pillar of reality. Even so, the false light of science (knowledge, if you like) shone in only a few developed countries. One company (or cabal) led the way in this regard: North Central Positronics, it called itself. Yet, despite a tremendous increase in available facts, there were remarkably few insights. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""Gunslinger, our many-times-great grandfathers conquered the-disease-which-rots, which they called cancer, almost conquered aging, walked on the moon - "" </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""I don't believe that,"" the gunslinger said flatly. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">To this, the man in black merely smiled and answered, ""You needn't. Yet it was so. They made or discovered a hundred other marvelous baubles. But this wealth of infomation produced little or no insight. There were no great odes written to the wonders of artificial insemination - having babies from frozen mansperm - or to the cars that ran on power of the sun. Few if any seemed to have grasped the truest principle of reality: new knowledge leads to yet more awesome mysteries. Greater physiological knowledge of the brain makes the existence of the soul less possible yet more probable by the nature of the search. Do you see? Of course you don't. You've reached the limits of your ability to comprehend. But nevermind - that's beside the point."" </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""What <i>is</i> the point then?"" </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""The greatest mystery the universe offers is not life but size. Size encompasses life, and the Tower encompasses size. The child, who is most at home with wonder, says: Daddy, what is above the sky? And the father says: The darkness of space. The child: What is beyond space? The father: The galaxy. The child: Beyond the galaxy? The father: Another galaxy. The child: Beyond the other galaxies? The father: No one knows. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""You see? Size defeats us. For the fish, the lake in which he lives is the universe. What does the fish think when he is jerked up by the mouth through the silver limits of existence and into a new universe where the air drowns him and the light is blue madness? Where huge bipeds with no gills stuff it into a suffocating box abd cover it with wet weeds to die? </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""Or one might take the tip of the pencil and magnify it. One reaches the point where a stunning realization strikes home: The pencil tip is not solid; it is composed of atoms which whirl and revolve like a trillion demon planets. What seems solid to us is actually only a loose net held together by gravity. Viewed at their actual size, the distances between these atoms might become league, gulfs, aeons. The atoms themselves are composed of nuclei and revolving protons and electrons. One may step down further to subatomic particles. And then to what? Tachyons? Nothing? Of course not. Everything in the universe denies nothing; to suggest an ending is the one absurdity. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""If you fell outward to the limit of the universe, would you find a board fence and signs reading DEAD END? No. You might find something hard and rounded, as the chick must see the egg from the inside. And if you should peck through the shell (or find a door), what great and torrential light might shine through your opening at the end of space? Might you look through and discover our entire universe is but part of one atom on a blade of grass? Might you be forced to think that by burning a twig you incinerate an eternity of eternities? That existence rises not to one infinite but to an infinity of them? </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""Perhaps you saw what place our universe plays in the scheme of things - as no more than an atom in a blade of grass. Could it be that everything we can perceive, from the microscopic virus to the distant Horsehead Nebula, is contained in one blade of grass that may have existed for only a single season in an alien time-flow? What if that blade should be cut off by a scythe? When it begins to die, would the rot seep into our universe and our own lives, turning everthing yellow and brown and desiccated? Perhaps it's already begun to happen. We say the world has moved on; maybe we really mean that it has begun to dry up. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""Think how small such a concept of things make us, gunslinger! If a God watches over it all, does He actually mete out justice for such a race of gnats? Does His eye see the sparrow fall when the sparrow is less than a speck of hydrogen floating disconnected in the depth of space? And if He does see... what must the nature of such a God be? Where does He live? How is it possible to live beyond infinity? </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""Imagine the sand of the Mohaine Desert, which you crossed to find me, and imagine a trillion universes - not worlds by <i>universes</i> - encapsulated in each grain of that desert; and within each universe an infinity of others. We tower over these universes from our pitiful grass vantage point; with one swing of your boot you may knock a billion billion worlds flying off into darkness, a chain never to be completed. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""Size, gunslinger... size. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""Yet suppose further. Suppose that all worlds, all universes, met at a single nexus, a single pylon, a Tower. And within it, a stairway, perhaps rising to the Godhead itself. Would you dare climb to the top, gunslinger? Could it be that somewhere above all of endless reality, there exists a room?... </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">""You dare not."" </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""ARIAL"">And in the gunslinger's mind, those words echoed: <i>You dare not.</i></font></p>"

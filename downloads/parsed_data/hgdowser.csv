I am 21 now.
I have been through a lot since June of '04

So, what do I have to show for my aging?..slow progress.
No degree. :(
No place of my own :(
No kids :)
No marriage :)
NO Bad Habit :)
A Car that starts every time!!! :) (knock on wood**)
A caring family :)
A person who says part of their soul will always be with me. (I wish I could tell them the same, because thats exactly how I feel.) :)"

So, I went to Rhiannons wedding reception..
I knew navy guys would be there..and I knew that I'd click with someone..
but for some reason..
I am so tired of those ""player""..i'm so white sometimes..anyways..TYPES.
This guy was pretty hot. We eyed eachother when I arrived at the Church for the wedding..and I knew that something might happen..
I mean attempts were continuous..but he was trying to decide between me and someone else.. I guess I shouldn't have handed him a garner(sp) snake..But still..LOL
blah. later that night he tried grabbing my shoulder and having me sit next to him..but i slapped his hand..
wanna know why?
Because he suggested I take him out on the dance floor..and I just smiled..but I walked away to go change out of my dress..and It took me for EVER of course..the whole YMCA song..to unzip and change into something more comfortable..anyways..i walk back to the covered area..and I see him on the dance floor with this other girl (she will remain nameless) i was sad.
but oh well.
shit happens.

The story of the day would be..

It was my last break today. I was walking towards the lunch room at work, with my co-worker Jeff. I was explaining to him that all I wanted was some cookies, or chocolate ice cream. Something sweet!..you know? because I didn't eat dinner earlier..(my work schedule is 1-9:30..pm) my last break is at 7...I didn't eat dinner because I felt sick..so all I ate was some easy mac...earlier..and a tiny bowl of cereal..That might be a lot to some people..but I eat a lot at 3 usually..
anywho..I wanted the cookies..so I told Jeff that I was going to go to my car to get some change..well 
I walk back to the lunch room..find the cookies I wanted were completely out..there werent any left in the vending machine..well I walk around the corner and theres Jeff..eating the f'n cookies I wanted. 
I didn't tell him SPECIFICALLY that I wanted those cookies..but 
I BURST INTO TEARS 5 minutes LATER..when I told my friends Haley and Jen. :( 
I can't believe I cried over cookies..but it really made me mad. The guy never gets those cookies..it really annoyed me..
I cried for a good two-three minutes..and let everyone see. lol. It was great. 
I still haven't talked to Jeff. He is kind of irritating me. Jeff is this 30 year old guy, who kind of likes me..and it kind of grosses me out, but he is nice to talk to. blahck. anywho..that wwas my EMOTIONAL DAY. lol

that, and I don't know. 
something else.

So, I did a friend a favor and picked this girl Sarah up, who actually seems like she might be a good friend...well the guy gave me a couple hits from his blunt..so that was nice. She is a scorpio..sorry just had to throw that bit in there. Anyways, So, I picked some vodka and rum up after work Friday, headed over to Amys place in Ballard, (AWESOME BTW)..and met the new roommate Tommy-Anne..lol..Amy thought it was Tambian..and I heard Cambian over the phone..so we just call her. T.A. Well, we had plans to all three go to Jakubs party..but he was outta town in Olympia (jakub is amys old sailing mate)..and he goes to UW. Well that fell through and we decided to go to T.A.'s friends party..(her ex) but he didnt answer his phone..so we ended up going to Dmitrys friends party..yes..I ended up with Dmitry that night..again. 
Yes, this is the guy that has a girlfriend guys..
blah....why me? 
I can't stop. Anyways, us three girls ended up in three different places..during the night. And i ended up in getting in a blow out with some guy who spilled beer on me. What I didn't realize was that the entire house was a russian sausage fest. lol hahaha
and i dug around in a couch..there is a lot more that happened...but i just felt like typing some of it down..so i can think clearly.

I've met someone who seems like they would be a good friend, but...well, there is something more. 

They have a girlfriend.

& I am pretty interested.

Out of the NORM. I usually stay away.

In other news,

My job is something I'll never get tired of. I don't care about going. I don't really rush getting anywhere after work..I'm content. Its always like this. The people there are another family to me.

I plan on working there for another year, maybe two?
I plan on getting my associates degree whenever I feel like taking the (hard) math classes. I struggle with math..Always have, always will. 
I don't like the homework. My mind doesnt work with numbers, it works with words. I memorize locations..and I don't really read instructions..because they have steps..which include numbers.


I am going to be athletic again..which means..20 hrs of cardiovascular exercise a week. I am trying to lose at least 8 lbs, and start building more muscle mass..and sculpt my body. I am pretty determined, and very motivated. I am actually very excited. Problem is..when classes start..where will I be? I won't think about it. My best friend wont be at EvCC anymore.

<P><STRONG>hella! oh man. so i helped move my aunt out from like 9-10am to 4pm. then i&nbsp; babysit until like 9:30. i made a phone call and asked a friend if they could do me a favor and buy me a fifth of bacardi and a pint of absolut vodka. thanks to him. :) then omg. amy and i decided we'd get drunk alone for awhile, and decided that we'd make a few calls or texts. so we did. and we got like 7 people to come play with us! it was really fun. i got a hold of callie and fae...and they brought these kind of interesting people over named indio and raven..and they had a baby ferret. it was so cute! the name was junior..and it kind of bit me! the bastard. lol but before that we went to visit kareem rachel taylor steven seth and this girl at bowling. it was neat. but amy and i got tired of it because it was like a bunch of 15-16 year olds..so we decided to leave..and ended up getting this guys number..he was like ""were having a party"" so we exchanged numbers but he wasnt all that cute..but his friends may have been.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>so thennnnnnnnn we all eventually ended up at amys house. it was Me, Amy, Raven, Indio,&nbsp;Callie, Fae, Kareem, Ian, Brandon, and..sigh!! this really really cool attractive guy named Nick.&nbsp; So hot! mmmm</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Apparently Shane (trollwithaxe) came over last night..but i didnt realize. the boys didnt leave until 5..in which i then passed out..after receiving a few great kisses.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>we played spin the bottle and went aroudn the block half nude. GREAT stuff. it was really fun. im glad i had a good night :)</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>i did miss someone last night though. </STRONG></P>

"event","I am definitely looking forward to next quarter. Its almost Spring time!! I love the Spring
As bitter as I might be, I know I will pull through. I've already had so many dreams before I had found out the truth, so my mind and heart was setting itself up for disappointment and heart break. I am so glad to have had it all confirmed..and looking at the confirmation wasn't as hard as I thought it would be coming from the persons fingers. (via keyboard) It's weird. I am somewhat relieved in a sense..and then again still a  little tender. I don't know why. Maybe its more the fact that someone that was supposed to be my good friend started dating the love of my life for 1 1/2 to 2 years after we pretty much ended things. Give or take a few months.
Oh well. What did I really get out of the relationship in the first place--besides my first love, mediocre to great sex, and the experience of a long-term relationship? I guess I've grown wiser--in some aspects..and I really have a good idea of what I look for in a person (personality wise).

Right now--I am not really looking for a relationship or sexual encounters. It does not sound appealing..
I could go on and on about who I want, who I don't want, etc, etc. But it doesn't matter. The fact is, I enjoy the freedom I have. Not to do just bad things, or to do whatever I please..but to have an option..and make a choice that only effects me. I'm glad I don't have to worry about anyone else, besides my family and friends ya know? But I don't have to lie to them. I don't lie to them. The only time I ever lie is when I am usually afraid..but even then I don't. So, I guess you could say..I lie to people I don't want to deal with..one in particular..but I guess thats still bad. Oh well, I will no longer have to deal with that, and I am somewhat happy about it.
So, in the end..I get what I want. 
To be left alone..and no longer be bothered. Although, I am still bothered..and still ""lectured"". oh well.
Sometimes I still can't help but think about the good times in Vegas..and what not, and a tear starts to roll down my cheek, but that was one good time..
I can still look forward to many good times, with many other friends, and few other boyfriends that I may have in the years to come.
So over all, my feelings right now are mediocre..and focused.
I am about ME, my close friends, my family, school, my animals..and that is all.
IF you want to be someone that I am about..just make better friends with me, and don't date the love of my life after we break up. You were never a real friend..I should have saw that in you, before I decided to become your friend.

GOOD LUCK ON FINALS EVERYONE..and have an awesome Spring Break!! ;-)"

I want to be permanently happy. Although that is probably impossible. haha. Its ok to want that right?
I mean, I don't like being sad or depressed. I do like being alone at times..but then I have so much time to think, and I'd rather not do that..but if I'm alone and have nothing to think about I'll be bored..and no longer want to be alone. What a vicious cycle..
So I am moving on..working on it at least..
trying to maintain happiness..and surrounding myself with happy go lucky, non narrow minded, non gossip speaking people. I mean..Im not pointing at anyone directly. I just have a couple guidelines to being my friend. I mean, everyone does right? No drug use? I guess this would be narrow minded in a way, but I dont want to deal with anything unpleasant right now. I just want optimism, and love in my life..and SUNSHINE.

Why do you care if I am seeing someone else?

If you are angry with me, you have a right to be..
But If you want to talk to me..or invite me to coffee..don't expect me to jump out of my seat..
Don't you treat me like a drug-addict..because you don't know what I really do.
You hear from others..and believe what you REALLY want to believe. 
But not all of its true..


""I did more just because I was trying to look out for her..so she wouldnt do it all and die""
Sounds to me..and looks to me like they just wanted free drugs.

I would think like that because I am a drug addict, eh?
No. If anything..I am addicted to oranges..I eat those every day.

If you drink 1 beer a week, does that make you an alcoholic? I don't think so.
If you decide not to attend church..does that make you NOT a Christian?

To be honest, I've tried, I've used...and I really don't plan on anything anymore
No one has to believe that..I am not promising anything..Its a choice..a choice that I have made..Not because of you.
Not because of rumors..or because of the truth.
But because I have decided that it is not worth it.
I would prefer to keep my body healthy as long as I possibly can.

My apologies.

I love you all.

I've been spending an awful lot of time with my mom. I like it. Today we watched a movie together because we have similar class schedules.
This quarter is almost over, and I've reached most of my goals fitness wise. 
On the menu for dinner tonight was:
Salmon, Noodles, and Creamed Peas..I really like creamed peas. haha

I snacked on some reduced fat cheez its, they are my favorite..they just have more tang.
I love my friends, and I love Spring.
I am so excited to wear skirts and flip flops. 
I thought I wanted a boyfriend for awhile, but you know...I don't know what I want.
Nothing for now. :-) Friends at the best. I like to flirt occasionally..as long as it doesn't go anywhere.
I have my eye on a few cuteys. ;-) But no one in particular..and if they are..not worth mentioning right this second.
So, in the car on the way to my workout class, I decided I'd trim a lot of my hair off. It has been driving me insane..TIME TO CHOP IT OFF FOR SPRING/Summer..and go lighter. I'm sick of my natural color..now I see why I always dyed it cool combos. :-) Yeah, I've done it all..except I haven't had dreads..or extensions..although I have considered extensions. 

I saw Rachel walking and talking on her cellular telephone today..as I was leaving from visiting Jack the cat.
I was supposed to go to KZ's yesterday..but me and my social anxiety..I was too afraid to knock on the door..

I wonder what Amy's doing right now..I miss that lady."

"event","Hey Mom?
Yes.
Can I miss school on May 1st? [insert innocence here]
Why?
On that day Hispanic people all over the world will be united to protest the immigration laws in the U.S.   They're skipping work and school in protest. [sober expression]
Really?
Yes, really, Mom. [earnest delivery]
Well...  in that case... [hopeful look]
No.  Absolutely not.  You will NOT skip school to protest immigration laws or any other laws for that matter.
[sheepish grin] Yeah, I didn't think you'd let me.  I was all like 'Hey I want to protest!' and my Hispanic friends were like, 'but you're WHITE.'

Even the Hispanic friends knew it was a ridiculous request."

"event","1. I rub my feet together when I'm tired.

2. When I'm sick I wear my favorite soft shirt and watch Moonstruck.

3. In times of crisis, I seriously contemplate moving or going back to school or both - the more serious the crisis, the further along I get into the process.  To date, I have applied to 3 law schools.  

4. I sleep with 3 pillows.  Each is necessary for a different reason.

5. I sing in the car.  In broad daylight.  In traffic.  Barry Manilow."

and i can't convince myself to care
i think im gonna become a mental case
if i don't have you there
you meant more thatn the world to me
everything about you
and you just couldn't see
i didn't know what to do
it was a match made in hell
but it just made sense 
those times we stood out in the rain
the thunder was our music 
the lightning was our friend
and we danced
we danced those nights away
and now they're gone
and your gone
did you know i miss you?
i miss you
so tonight i walk in the rain alone
the music is playing 
but i have no one to dance with
i miss you tonight
and every night until you return 
but your never coming back
but i will still miss you every night
until you return"

"event","people come and go through life 
like a reason for living
friends can be gone in the time
it takes you to forget they are there
no matter how much you've been through
no matter all the promises you've made
but all those people, friends, loves, 
every moment of your life that you spend with them
makes you who you grow up to be
and we are all eternaly children
and we ware alone
we are born alone
we die alone
no one can possibly know 
what we are honestly feeling
no matter how well they know you 
and love you
its all so superficial
you are alone in the battle 
that we all call life
and you can't change it"

i awoke to find my world
of comfort and dependability
crumbling to pieces around me
and i was left standing in the middle
of all the reckage
it was a day not unlike today
the dark clouds rolling in 
acting to a metaphor to my disaster
and time stopped for a brief seccond
not long enough to regain myself, 
but just long enough
to realize existance would neve be the same
and in that brief moment of still, 
i knew that i never appreciated 
how damn lucky i was"

she considers even her closest friends
her enemies
shes afraid to let any one in
to see who she really is
uncut, imperfected, the real her
it pains her to think 
this is really her life
all of the lies and the agony
but it is
and she takes no pride in it
and how she conceals it 
but she does
and every morning when she wakes
she wonders 
how much longer can i do this?"

"event","it hurts me just thinking
of how we used to be
when you were with me
i could bary my problems in you
where i thought theyd be forever 
like i though you'd be with me
until the end of time
it was like we were ment to be together
like it was fate
and i know you loved me
i know you did, no matter what you say
and i loved you 
as much as i possibily could 

i still dont know what happened 
and i dont think i ever will
it will always be a mystery to me
but that mystery just leads me to guess...
its probably all those times i fucked up
and the times i never had a scarcastic answer
to your questions during all the long talks 
that could make you laugh 
to cover up the fact that i had no idea 
what you were talking about 

but i miss those long talks 
thats only one of the things i miss 
about you and me
i miss being the first person 
to get to notice that you got a new shirt

and i miss having you come to me
with all your problems
not afraid at all to show me 
that you truly didnt know everything
because you knew i would love you 
whether you knew everything or not

i miss your never ending complements 
about my hair, cloathes, eyes, 
all the stupid things
and how you thought i was so much better than you
which i never really was 
and i never will be


i miss the way you'd sneek up behind me 
and grab my waist 
and cover my eyes
and make me guess who it was
and every time i would pretend to be suprised it was you
even when i knew
because i could smell that distinct sweet smell
of you when you were more than 10 feet away
and damn i miss that smell

i miss the way you could know what i was thinking 
just by looking into my eyes
and you could make sense of my feelings 
when even i couldn't possibly understand them
but you could 
and i didnt even have to ask you to tell me what to do
because i could look in to your eyes
and i could tell what you thought i should do

i miss never being afraid to make a mistake 
cause i knew you'd be there 
no matter what
to pick me up, dust me off 
and motivate me to keep going

and i miss the encourgement you gave me 
to follow my dreams 
no matter what other people said
because you thought that was the only way 
i would be truly happy
and you told me that if i was truly happy 
you would be too

little did you know
there was only one thing i truly need 
and it isn't 
what you thought it was...


most of all i miss having you by my side 
holding my hand 
through all the rough spots of life
and helping me to grow 
into a better person
i miss having you!"

just wishing she'd stare back
she can't understand why he's wasting his time
when she tells him she'll never feel the same

or even notice her walk by
she asked if he still loved her?
he replied.
 ""i loved you! i really loved you!
and now you finally realize?
you dont even know what it means to love
like the way i loved you.
It means completely loosing yourself in someone else.
you could never understand that could you?
your so self absorbed
it's all a game to you, isn't it?
all those nights i sat on your front lawn 
hoping you'd come out
just so i could see you

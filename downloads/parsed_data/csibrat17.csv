I got accepted to the Academy of
Environmental Science.

I was going to do CDE from there
and only have 1 class at AES but
I decided to go to AES full time
with 3 classes (English IV and
two sciences). The principal is
going to let me fill in my fourth
class in his office on the computer
doing FLVS Economics.. how cool is
that?

Heres the schedule.. I know ya'll
are jealous!

It's gonna be freakin awesome!! and

so I won't be alone ;)
I know she'll get accepted.. she does
good in school.
AWESOME...
I'll be smiling at school for a while

"event","<center>So ya, I'm actually posting
on Live Journal, a real post
this time...
I'm kinda pissed off.. Like
a half an hour ago I drove
to the corner store with my
step dad. Before we even got
out of the driveway he blamed
me for something that I didn't
do which was a stupid thing
any way.. well I get like 20
feet out of the driveway, (I
Guess he was mad at me for not
talking to him) and he grabs
the wheel and turns it to the
right... I slammed on the brakes
and put the truck in park.. I
seriously thought about opening
the door and walking back up the
driveway and leaving him to drive
to the store by himself, but I
didn't.. Instead I went with him
and I drove like a maniac and I
stayed in the truck while he went
in...
At dinner he had to make his stupid
comments because one of the kids
was whinning about something he
said ""What a bunch of babies""

F*** YOU

Your seduction technique can be summed up with ""charm""
You know that if you have the chance to talk to someone...
Well, you won't be talking for long! ;-)

You're great at telling potential lovers what they want to hear.
Partially, because you're a great reflective listener and good at complementing.
The other part of your formula? Focusing your conversation completely on the other person.

Your ""sweet talking"" ways have taken you far in romance - and in life.
You can finess your way through any difficult situation, with a smile on your face.
Speeding tickets, job interviews... bring it on! You truly live a *charmed life*</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>

Here are some lyrics that I love!
If you care... I just felt like
sharing...

I was raised in Pocohantas Illinois 
Everybody thought of me as one of the boys 
Cause I'd run with a crowd that was tough 
At fifteen I was tending Big O's Bar 
I'd sing till two AM for half a tip jar 
Spent my youth singing truth, paying dues 

I'm the biggest thing that ever came from my home town 
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let em dow 
If it's the last thing I do before they lay me in the ground 
You know I'm gonna make Pocahantas proud 

I knocked on every door on music row 
But they looked down at me and said ""girl go back home"" 
You ain't got what we need in this town 

But they couldn't whup the fighting side of me 
You know where I come from we don't give up easily 
Overnight took all my life to be found 

I'm the biggest thing that ever came from my hometown 
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let em down 
If it's the last thing I do before they lay me in the ground 
You know I'm gonna make Pocahantas proud 

At twenty seven I had baby Grace 
I was born again when I saw her sweet face 
And I knew she was the greatest thing I'd ever do 

I'm the biggest thing that ever came from my hometown 
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let em down 
If it's the last thing I do before they lay me in the ground 
You know I'm gonna make Pocahantas proud 
</font>

Okay, here are the rules. The first player of the games starts with ""6 weird habits/things about yourself"" and people who get tagged need to write a blog of their ""6 things"" as well as stating this rule clearly in the blog. In the end, you must choose the next 6 people to be tagged and list their names. 

1. Since I have had Mrs. Powell I correct everyone in my family who says/spells something wrong.

2. Im 21% Tom-Boy, I love to ride dirt bikes and yes, when I was little, I played with legos instead of Barbies (Still love them).

3. When I get sad I read all of my Dad's letters dating back to 1998 until the present.

4. My mom and I <u>always</u> have weird dreams containing Alligators

5. I find that Gay television shows/people are funnier than straight television shows/people; Will and Grace, The Ellen DeGeneres show, Ellen, My Uncle, Michael Jackson.

6. The only way I can eat Macaroni and Cheese is with Ketchup, and the only way I can eat Hot Dogs is with Mayonaise and Ketchup

A while ago I put in
a job application at Cody's
and I went in for a job
interview... I've been
waiting for like 3 weeks
for a phone call that I
believe I'll never get...

Jessica called me the other
day (from Sears.. YA On The Job)
and told me that someone quit
and that I should fill out
an application for Shoes Dept.

I got a call today from one
of the ALMIGHTY people at
Sears and more than likely I
will get the job.

I have an interview on Tuesday

GO ME!!</center>"

Sooo, you all have probably
been wondering what's going
on with me... hahaha... I
shouldn't kid myself, it's
bad for my mental status...


Anyways, Yesterday, Garry
(My Sexy Little Snail) asked
me out!

:-D

I said yes...

I love this guy!
I liked him since 9th grade
but never said anything bc
someone else I know liked
him and was all over him...

That is one reason I am happy,
Another is that tomorrow
I am going to the Daytona
Speedway to watch the Supercross

YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!


That is all, I am at a loss
for words...

So yesterday
London was here and my family
decided to have a bonfire outback...
It was me, my Mom, Kurt, London,
Kameron, Sissy, Rachel, Aunt Lisa,
Uncle Rodney, and Kristina... I thought
that was enough people but my Mom
decided to invite stupid Debbie
over along with her husband John.

Everything was going fine until
the middle of the night. Debbie
came inside from the fire to get a beer
and started having a conversation with
me (I was inside testing out my new
PowerPoint). Debbie = White, Me = Blue

<font color = white> By the way you act I can't tell
if you like me or not </font>
<font color = blue> When I act like that, Im just kiddin
(I was ""staring her down"") </font>
<font color = white> Well you shouldn't do that, I don't
know how to take you, alot of people
don't know how to take sarcasm </font>
<font color = blue> well thats just me.. thats how I am </font>
<font color = white> Ashley, your too young and too pretty
and too smart to act like your mother, don't
act like her.  We all love your mom but
sometimes the way she acts is too much </font>
<font color = blue> well maybe those stuck up people should
go to sarcasm school </font>
she looks at me for a few minutes *evil*
and then she hits me in the arm...
HAHAHAHA ur right

I told my Mom and Kurt what happend,
Kurt said his blood was boiling...

We went out to the fire and half the time
I stood away from everyone leaning on a
fence post waiting...

Finally John and Debbie left... I was waiting
for Debbie to come up to me and ask what was
wrong...

""OH, I was just thinking about what you said...
Should I change for 5 people or stay the same
for 100?""

I wanted to hit that @#%$@#$!@# sooo bad,
I was clenching my fist.. open, shut, open,
shut...

I punched something, I can't remember what it was
and my knuckle is hurting me still, since last
night.. It hurts to move it..

I've never gotten into a fight, and that bitch
will be suprised when she thinks little
""sweetheart"" Ashley lashes out and starts giving
her an earfull.

I've got so much to say to her, I can't wait to
see her again...

Im white in color, but like a Puerto Rican at the
mouth</center>"

I feel as though my
life here is temporary...
Don't get me wrong,
Im not going through
any stage of depression,
I just...

Anywhere I go, I can
feel me literally somewhere
else... like Im not supposed
to be there.. Almost as if
there is another ME existing
somewhere, escaping fate..
choosing paths better for me..

I cant see past this year...
I was imagining what it would
be like when my aunt and uncle
got a house on their property..
but Im like... I won't know,
I probably wont be here...

School sux.. I dread it
I used to love it, now the
only class I enjoy is
Ms. Crawfords

Today I begged her to teach
English IV...

I asked her if she was.. she
said she didn't have any clue
what they were going to do
with her, I said... PLEASE
FOR THE LOVE OF.... ME, TEACH
ENGLISH IV! She laughed and
said she was considering it.

London is coming home this
weekend for his birthday...
Something is keeping me from
getting excited and I feel
guilty... I love him so much
He is soo cute...
I talked to him on the phone
Sunday, and he's like, Guess
how much money I have in my
account, and I guessed...
He told me it was $218.00
I said Dang boy.. looks like
your going to be buying me
a car, he said maybe.
I told him I was just kidding
but he sounded so serious, ""I
will, but I don't have enough""

I feel sometimes like he is all
Im living for...
I feel bad because I make comments
to my mom about school sucking and
I can tell it hurts her...

I must go



""This too shall pass""
and I say ""I hope so..""</center>"

Yesterday was great,
First period I took
a test which I didn't
""finish"" (lol) that way
I could study over the
weekend.

Second period, Ms. Crawford
and Ms. Guisti were having
""OUR CLASS RULES"" Wars.
Ms. Crawford was like.. Ok
I dare someone to go run into
Ms. Guisti's class and be like
""Ms. Crawfords class is the best!""
and run out.. so Brennan and Kyle
did...
A few minutes later 2 of her
students came in (they sounded soo
enthused... *not) and said
""Ms. Guisti told us to tell you
our class is better.""

So then we sent like 10 people over
there with pompoms and they did
a little cheer for Ms. Crawfords
class....

and then... lmao

Ms. Guisti's whole class came over
and Ms. Crawford locked her hallway
door and ran to lock the courtyard
door... she was going so fast I told
TaLeisha ""She's going to lock herself
out.""

Well.. She didn't have to.. she
successfully locked the door, and
then Logan pulled it shut on her...
she was out there screaming NOO NOO
LET ME IN.. <b>LMFAO</b>

and then all we hear is MR. SIMON IS
COMING.. MR. SIMON IS COMING...

and we let Ms. Crawford back in and
opened the other door and guess who
was there... MR. SIMON!

OMFG.. It was hilarious... Ms. Crawford
was like.. ""We are all pumped up for the
Pep Rally"" and Mr. Simon didn't even care..

But still Ms. Crawford had to go through
all the Mr. Simon crap.. so therefore, I
think we won!

Yay.. Go Ms. Crawfords (2nd period) Class!!

Oh ya.. and Juniors totally
kicked butt at the pep rally...

<b>JUNIORS RULE</b>

To bad all the pep rallies are fixed..


Last night my cousin Rachel (15) and
Kristina (8) came over.
Me, Rachel, Kameron, Kristina and Sissy
were all jammin to MC Hammer.
Rachel and I were trying to teach the
kids how to do the ""Runnin Man"" it
didn't go as planned, but I think part
of the reason is because we can't do
it either.. lmao

Ahh... Whatta day...
Lets do it again sometime!</center>"

HEY!
Who woulda thought school
dances are gay?!? Therefore
it is easy to see why my
motto ""Dances are for fags""
fits perfectly...

ha!

I am here tonight at my
computer while people
wasted $8.00 (single) or
$15.00 (couple) and then-some
for DRESSES AND SHOES AND
HAIR HICKY DOOS AND SHIRTS
AND DRESS PANTS AND.. eww

And I had a blast the whole
day while they had to pay
who knows how much for 
music and crowded rooms for
4 hours.. thats funny!

I went to the parque with
Amanda and the kids.
Amanda and I played B-Ball
for a half hour and then
for 20 more minutes we
played catch.

then for another 20 minutes
played on the playground
with the kids

When we got home I rode my
dirtbike and she rode her
four wheeler

I just took a nice hot shower
and now my mommy is bringing
me a chocolate shake from
Mickey D's

Needless to say, I think I
secreted 5 lbs of sweat off
today... Yay for me right?!?

Too all the people who aren't
fags.. I E> U and GOODNIGHT..
for those who are... EWW
COOTIES

P.S.-I have music and crowded
rooms at my house, If I woulda
known that you all were going
to be gay and pay for that, I
woulda had a ""Dance"" here and
charged you $5.00

.... Damn</center>"

TODAYS THE DAY...
I dont know how I
feel, excited, nervous
overwhelmed...

My Aunt Lisa, Uncle Rodney
and Cousins (Amanda *my lover*,
Rachel and Kristina) are moving
here.. they will be here in
about.. oh... 4-5 hours...

I will finally have somebody
to hang out with..


On top of that, yesterday I
signed up for Florida Virtual
School, Im taking Economics
and American Govt. and after
I am done with those I'll take
Chemistry (unless I get into
the Academy of Environmental
Science) then all I have to
do in school is:

Algebra II
English IV (might take online)
Drama x 2
World Hist (might take online)

and bing  bang boom IM DONE!!

I may actually get to graduate
early, which would be good
because staying at school for
no reason would suck, I barely
have a social life there anymore
so...

YAY



k.. im gonna go.. got places to go, 
stuff to do, people to see and people to screw</center>"

So...
Just so Beth knows..
Im still here, I didn't
fall into a place of
non existance.. lol

I guess if I didn't update
there would be no way for
you to be able to tell if
Im alive or dead, so, that
explains your concern...

Im alive single, alone, happy,
healthier??

My mom met some people that
needed their house cleaned, and
we all ended up going to their
house last night and were there
for 4 hours... we all need some
friends..

Unfortunately there was no hot
16-17 year old guy, nor a 16-17
year old girl, so I spent my night
entertaining a bunch of children..
Ages- 5, 6, 8, 8, 9 and the baby

I found out that I have been
volunteered by my mother to baby
sit the 3 kids there... I didn't
ask for her to do that.. but right
now I could care less because any
thing out of this house is more
than the life that I have here.

The mothers name is Wendy.. How
Ironic.. I asked my mom what it
was like to say her own name.. she
said weird.. of course

Wendy asked me how much I charge..
I made a really stupid face (I
know I did) and said.. I dont even
know... They don't pay me.. and they
all laughed...

Thats my night... except for the
excitement of HAVING A PRINTER..

Thank god..

That is all

I do exist

<font size=5>BOO YAA!
KUZCO TOPIA!!!</font>
I CAN OFFICIALLY
DRIVE AT NIGHT NOW

I've done it before,
but now its <b>LEGAL</b>

So when someone says
""Are you legal?""
I can be like yep!
and then I will see
what they really meant
and I will say.. oops,
I meant I am legally able
to drive in the dark,
silly goose your not
getting in these jeans..
I think they are too
small for you...

lol.. IDK wtf I am
talking about..

Im soooooo happy lately
I haven't been social
with my closest friends
lately IDK why but I have
been talking alot more
with everyone from my
other classes, I am soo
happy, IDK why...

Things are great, Moms
doing ok, we found out
why she was soo bitchy
for a while, it's 
because she stopped
taking her anti-depressants
and Kurts doing better
with me..

He is definately the
better driving instructor
of the two..

Mom makes weird noises
at me if I dont stop at
the exact eighth of a
second that she wanted
me too but I do really
good.. No accidents yet

If I do something I
could have done better
Kurt tells me and lets
me know how I can improve
and he doesn't get all
frustrated and say ""I
am driving on the way
back""

He lets me drive basically
100% when we are out
and about.


Tonight CSI and Will and
Grace is on so I will
be occupied with that..
I am pround of myself, Im
not a total computer
junkie anymore.. I've only
been on here like 2 times
in 3 weeks...

I eat lots and lots of
fruit and cut down on the
other crap, I've been doing
push ups every night...

I feel great, too bad I don't
look it..

Well I think I have written
enough for now..

Cheeky li'l blights..

So...
Yesterday I finally got
out of the house, went
to the mall at like 5:30
and stayed there till like
8:00

I saw some people there I
really didn't feel like
seeing out of school but
you take that chance when
you go to the only ""hang
out"" in Crystal River

My sister was dissapointed
to see these people too
it was funny..

She say's the funniest stuff

I got online with my PSP
at the mall.. it was totally
awesome..

I can play SOCOM online with
other people, but I didn't
try it while I was there..

I'll have to go back soon

My classes are going well
I found out that in my Anatomy
and Phisiology class we are
taking a field trip to MOSI
on February 6th to see the
Bodies Exhibit... that is
going to be so freakin awesome
it sorta goes along with what
I want to do with my life so
I see it as an awesome opportunity

We are also going to be dissecting
a cat, a rat, and a fetal pig..

I LOVE IT!!!!

History seems like it will be a
breeze.. well for me anyways, I love
history so it sticks with me well

I just wish that I wasn't offered
AP History and English honors so
late last semester.. I could have
been in those classes

Oh well

My classes are good



And again Happy Birthday Beth
Happy Birthday Sarina


Beth.. Im really sorry I couldn't
come, If I could drive I would
have been there so quick..

When I get my lisence, Im never
going to be at home...

I drive alot now as it is.. lol

Im sorry that I cannot be
there for your party...
If I could drive I would
be down there so quick...
Probably 48 hours before
the party started...

LMAO..

I was just thinking about the
time when you had a sleep over
and we kept hearing stuff on
the news about Hurricanes and
I was like, what if a Hurricane
comes, where are you going to
put your hamster?

And then I was like OH!
You could put him in the dryer
with a little scuba mask, that
way he would feel at home in
a wheel that he could run on...

LMAO...

The good OLD days..

I love you and I wish you the
best!

I'm really depressed...
You would think that
I would be happy
graduating in a year
in a half and all,
but I'm not too excited
about it..

I feel totally lost
and no longer in control
I can't imagine life
after high school..

How am I going to survive
in college?

What am I going to do?

What if I can't get into
college?

What if I don't get any
scholarships?

What if I don't pass?

What Career will I go into?


TOO MANY QUESTIONS...

I think after high school
I am going to community
college to finish all my
math and science *etc* classes

and then head into college..

I'm so scared.. No more
""Holding Mommy's Hand""


On top of that my NFL
team just lost the Playoffs

I know it's probably not
a big deal to you all, but
I have been praying so much
for everything to come out
right, not just the games
but life, and none of it
is happening, I always find
myself doubting God...

Is there a God?

and if so, why does nothing
seem to go right in this
stinking life of mine?

Why would he let us all suffer?

Anyway..

Sorry for being down.. I'm
depressed, thats all I can
say.

There is way too much to
handle right now...

I'm so stressed

My mom keeps making jokes about
me moving out and making a new
house with out my bedroom in it
because I will be leaving soon,
but it isn't helping me at all

I've already cried into my pillow
today, I think I shall again...




Good night</center>"

Well..
Thanks to Drew Bledsoe
My day is ruined...

Why do the Cowboys have
to have such a retarded
quarter-back

and as for number 77...
I bet he will get his
ass chewed out for making
the cowboys have 7 FLAGS...
Not 1 flag.. not 2 flags..
S-E-V-E-N!

The Redskins haven't won
a game against the Cowboys
in 10 years, and tonight..
they did it...

7-35

Wow...

oh well at least this game
didn't matter..

24th is the on that matters
Cowboys v.s. Panthers..

Lets hope Bledsoe doesn't
fuck that one up...


Other than that.. Nothing
going on... Monday, School
which equals the start of
exam week... bleh...

Not gonna pass geometry if
I dont get higher than a
D.. which I think I can do

I also have LATE appeal to
turn in bc I didn't know
about it last week...

Hopefully they accept it..
or I will have to repeat
the 11th grade 1st quarter..

GREAT!!!</center>"

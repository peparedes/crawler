"event","Lately I've been thinking about how much I take for granted.. and about how ridiculous my bad attitude has been recently. My problems are small. They're petty, but they piss me off, and often times I let them ruin what had the potential to be a good day. A precious day of happiness wasted, that I can never get back.

I just need to get some perspective. For God's sake, I live in Arrowhead. I love my parents, I have amazing friends, an amazing boyfriend, and I still find the most retarded things to complain about.

Sure, if one of your friends has a bad day and they're in a bad mood, a lot of times you'll try to make them feel better.. (hey, that blows but yahno, at least you don't have ball cancer!) But does it really help? Yea, usually not.. an hour later they'll be bitching and moaning the same as before (not discluding myself in this allegation).

Cause nothing like that has probably ever really happened to them. You probably never lost a parent, a sibling, a friend.. never had everything you've ever worked for blown to shreds in a hurricane.. never been disfigured in an accident.. If something traumatic had happened to you, the smaller things wouldn't phase you so much. You wouldn't act like your world was ending when your girlfriend dumps you, because you've already experienced what that really meant. You'd already know what it's like to <b>really</b> feel like the world is ending. You'd have <i>perspective.</i>

It kinda just makes me wish the worst thing to ever happen to me will just happen already, so I can live the rest of my life in bliss.

Yea.. this probably doesn't make sense and I'm not even sure what point I'm trying to make.. haha just got lonely and bored and felt like writing..."

One thing I've come to learn is that probably the biggest warning sign is when someone gets mad at you for believing everyone else and the things they have to say about this person in question. Everyone else is usually right.

Live and learn I guess. At least I know better now, I'll never let this happen to me again."

I've got a <u>hunger</u> twisting my stomach into knots
that my tongue is tied off
My brain's repeating if you've got an impulse
<i>let it out</i>
but they <b>never</b> make it past my mouth

<i>Our youth is fleeting</i>
old age is just around the bend and I can't wait to go gray
And I'll sit an wonder of <u>every love</u> that <b>could have been</b> 
If I'd only thought of something <i>charming</i> to say






somebody please get online and talk to meeee! ;["

"event","Wellllll, Sunday Tierney came over 8]  and at about 1 in the morning Andre and Kevin Wilson decide to drop by so we hung out for a while, they're so effin cool, I love those bastards. Then at about 2:30 my mommy woke up and was like what the fuuuuck and so they had to leave haha. And THEN Charlene called me and said she was gonna walk from Peoria to Travis' house with Matt and Travis and from Travis' to my house BY HERSELF because she's a baby retard and I was <b>sooo scared</b> she was gonna get raped or arrested for being out past curfew or something, I was freakin the hell out. So I called Kevin to go get her ass at 3 in the morning. YOU'D BETTER LOVE ME BIA BIA!! Kevin is seriously the shit. <b>THAT WAS SO COOL OF HIM.</b>

I felt like a monster ;[ But I got the cooooooolest sunglasses, anc char lent me $5 so <b>thank you</b> very mucho babydoll and I'll pay you back!! At 12ish Kevin called wanting a Nintendo 64 controller so he could play Mario, lmao. He wanted it so bad, he was getting really mad at me.

"event","Well yesterday was an interesting day at the mall.. First thing I did was go get that skirt from Lithium that I've had my eye on for like a month. It wasn't cheap either, $40. Then we see this huuuge line outside Industrial and we found out <b>Metal Mulisha</b> was there. SO THERE WERE HOTT GUYS ALL OVER OMG THANK YA JESUS HALLELUJAH!@#$% We waited in line for like half an hour and didn't move like one inch seriously. So we left and walked around la de da, came back, Metal Mulisha is gone. La de da we went to PacSun and I was like OOOH SNAP WHERE'S MY SKIRT. We ran around a good 45 minutes looking for it and the mall was closing so I like flipped a tit, we went to the customer service desk and everything, they didn't have it. *sniffle* :(

I babysat the brattiest little 8 year old girl for 14 hours to get that effin skirt! RRRAWWWWRRR!

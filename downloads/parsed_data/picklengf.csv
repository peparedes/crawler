"event","<font size=""3"" color=""#800080"">We've had a listing on swinglifestyle.com for....must be a couple of years now. Although it has been fun a times, it hasn't actually accomplished the goal of finding us a well suited, fun couple to hang out and play with. Whenever we do connect via email with a couple we find interesting and seem interested in us, it seems to break down right about at the point we say&nbsp; ""Hey, do you want to meet out somewhere and say hello"". Don't know what's up with that. I'm sure sometimes it's difficulty with schedules and sometimes it's cold feet.<br /><br />We have actually met two couples from SLS. One couple seemed a lot more wild than us, which takes some doing. We're the sort of folks that people would be shocked to learn we're quietly producing home made porn for jollies. The other couple we met pried for such identifying information such as exactly what house on our street we live in (which is why we were meeting them out to begin with). They seemed a little like potential stalkers so we steered clear.<br /><br />So we end up emailing with a lot of people, but not meeting many. <br /></font>"

"event","<P>Hi everyone! In the spirit of the approaching holiday, we decided to try out some new costumes&nbsp;for erotic role play&nbsp;and let you all know what we think.
<lj-cut text=""And here's the reviews!"">
We started by hitting our local mall costume store. We found that for a reasonable price, we could pick up material to carry out a myriad of fantasies. Police and prisoner, devil and angel, or fishnets for everyone! The stuff isn't durable. Some of it is wearing out after only a few uses. But it's a good way to&nbsp;explore without much of an investment.

First on the hit parade was a french maid's costume. On the left is the photo from the package and on the right is my lovely wife modeling it.&nbsp;
<IMG title="""" src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/105149144-M.jpg"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG title="""" src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/99582325-S.jpg"">&nbsp;&nbsp; 

We found it to be excellent for playing out that upstairs maid fantasy! Picking up a feather duster is worth it too.


Then we tried out a nun's habit and priest's robe. They were a cheap experiment at $17 each.
<IMG title="""" src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/105149151-M.gif"">&nbsp; <IMG title="""" src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/105149158-M.gif"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG title="""" src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/105141702-M.jpg"">

We found these to be great fun! It was naughty as can be!! We'll likely invest in a better quality cotton habit when these fall apart soon.

Our final costume was the best of all. This time we sprung for a high quality&nbsp;school girl outfit from flirtcatalog.com. It was stunning!&nbsp;And will last and last! Yay!
&nbsp;<IMG title="""" src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/105153638-M.jpg"">&nbsp; The catalog photo from <A href=""http://www.flirtcatalog.com/store/product.asp?dept%5Fid=3230&amp;itemnumber=72FL206"">http://www.flirtcatalog.com/</A>


And my lovely wife modeling!

That's all for this Halloween. If you want to see more of our pics, including further states of undress, just sign up for the exhibitionism_2 community. We make photo posts there fairly regularly. I don't post nudes here because I don't want to bother screening for minors.

Say, does anyone know of any good Halloween parties in town? We're all dressed up with no place to go! ;)

"event","It's a sad fact that there just isn't enough time and funds to try all the sex toys available on the web! But in our selfless dedication, we've put some of the finest through their paces. Some of them over and over again...All so we can bring you this review. ;)
<lj-cut text=""And now the reviews!!"">
 <IMG src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/85395789-M.jpg"">&nbsp; Our first toy is the marvelous ""Hands free cyber ring"". It's a super-soft, super-stretchy cock ring with a slip in bullet vibe. We found it does a nice job of transforming a nice hard dick to a <EM>vibrating</EM> nice hard dick, much to the happiness of all. This is one of the best toy purchases we've ever made. Highly recommended! 
<IMG src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/85395792-M.jpg"">&nbsp; On the other end of the spectrum is the ""dotted delight"", which should be called the ""overly textured warted alien dick from hell"". It was advertised as ""<!--StartFragment --><SPAN class=itempage2 id=_f65c13c794655e97_lblLongDesc><I>amazingly soft</I></SPAN>"", but isn't. Should bear a label ""not for human use"". You could rub something raw. 
<IMG src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/85395782-M.jpg"">&nbsp; What sex toy exploration would be complete without a double dildo? The nexus in a cadillac of doubles and at $89 it just about costs the same. We bought this along with a ""texas two strap"" leather harness ($55) hoping it would allow a gal to feel it while she banged someone else. In practice it didn't work very well. The harness didn't hold the dildo well at all and we discovered she didn't especially want insertion while she banged somebody. Since then, we've used the nexus and harness separately. The nexus works as a dildo with a big handle now and gets occasional use. 
<IMG src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/85395785-Ti.jpg"">&nbsp; This is the ""champ"". It's a long slender silicone toy that works well in my wife's harness. We mainly use it for when she want to play ""bend over boyfriend"". It's long and smooth (important) yet has enough girth to put color in your cheeks. Prefered girth varies a lot from person to person, and there are many girths available in basic silicone dildos like this. 
<IMG src=""http://pickle.smugmug.com/photos/85395780-M.jpg"">&nbsp; The famed Hitachi Magic Wand. This is just about the best selling plug in wand vibrator out there. For the life of me, I can't figure out why. I turned this thing on and it came to life with frightening noise and power. It felt like a tool I'd use to strip paint off a car. (Think craftsman power sander.) I was not putting this near any sensitive areas. But maybe I'm not understanding it...maybe it goes <EM>under</EM> the mattress.

We'll meet them out somewhere (to be safe...don't want someone knowing where you live before you've had a chance to find out if they're crazy) for dinner or lunch. Unfortunately, due to conflicting vacations we have to wait another couple weeks to meet them face to face. In the mean time, we're emailing and exchanging nekkid yet non-identifying pics.

There are actually lots of local folks from Ithaca, Cortland, Elmira, etc. with profiles on SLS. Most aren't really what we're looking for. But there are some that may be just the thing. It's a thrill to explore!

I'll post an update as news warrents.

6. Played ""Wild Thing"" on electric guitar in front of my whole department at work.
7. Had nude photos developed at Ritz at the mall. Picked them up in person an hour later.

There were only four dancers working, but they were very friendly. They all just LOVE to see my girlfriend. One said she liked it when girls came because they're ""so much more fun than the guys"". We liked watching the stage dances and my GF got lots of extra bonuses for the dollars she slipped into dancer's garters. For example, she came home with lip gloss on that she didn't go with! ;) I came home with boob prints on my glasses. It was loads o fun!"

Joining a community is easy. You just go to the community information page <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=exhibitionism_2"">which is here.</a> And click on the ""To join the community click here"" link. After you've joined, you can see all of the community only posts.

You are a wild woman when you get it on.<br>
You will fondle and lick and stroke and suck to get you want you want.<br>
<br>
Only some people can handle your eagerness in bed, but those who can will never stray.<br> 
You have the sexual appetite of a man with the stamina of a woman.<br>
It often feels like you could have a zillion orgasms.<br>
<br>
Your way of picking up lovers-to-be is no less outrageous.<br>
You will often go out on a limb in public to lure someone into bed.<br>
And you succeed easily, as many people are turned on by your aggressive flirting.<br>
<br>
Your sexual goal for self-improvement should be to learn how to love the little things in romance.<br>
You can learn to embrace the sensual, lighter pleasures in life...<br>
As much as you already appreciate the raw, physical aspects of sex.<br>
<br>
Madonna and Christina Aguilera both have red sexual energies full of passion and brilliance.<br>
<br>

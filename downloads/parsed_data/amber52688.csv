 (sorry, I always wanted to say that)

  So Prom was an event. Not suprising considering that Prom is one of those events hyped since infancy. Its falls into the whole High school is the best time of your life motif that some people foolishly buy into. I myself hate high school and pep rallies (or spirit assemblies as there called at my school, home of the eagles since B.C.) and cheerleaders, and the homecoming game (I'm not big into football... now hockey I can watch) and whatever else is hyped up and springs forth nostolgia during the last month of school for seniors. Despite my anti- schooldom I still enjoyed Prom. Yes, there was literally a seperation from my group and the rest of the student body on the dance floor (thats okay our half of the dance floor was less crowded), yes I went dateless and most of the group that I went with had dates (however I did dance with 4 guys and a number of girls plus group dancing) and yes once again I was asked if I was drunk (this time by Casey) at a school dance due to my mad dance skillz and endurance/stamina despite the fact that I am outspoken about sobriety and beer/tonic/wiskey/spirit etc... abstince.  And still despite everything I had a great time.

  Its been so long that my life has been weighed down and my energy so drained that I barely made it by. Prom was an oppertunity to restore my soul and dance it all out and dance it all out I did. I danced longer, crazier, and more spectacular than anyone else. I was soaked in sweat but I still kept going. Prom was bliss in that sence. Plus word on the street is that I looked smashing. 
 
 After Prom we went over to Adam's house to watch Grandma's boy and party hardee. It was the prom set of Danielle, Brianna, Adam, and I and the out of high school set of Ellie and Jessica that attended. I couldn't get through half of the movie, I ended up passout on Adam's floor. I did manage to down half a giganic bottle of water, a Denise created Nacho Bell Grande, and two peices of cheese pizza. My body ate it up so fast. 

 I slept on Adam's couch and Mary picked me up the next day. I was suppose to go to a baby shower but I was too tired to go.
 
 I'll leave you guys to make sence of these pictures..

 Instead of updating everyone on the Amberness happenings (a story to tell at another time my friends) I will be debuting a what if scenario. 



*Parental control is a reality dating show on MTV. A daughter or son of two parents is dating an undesirable. The parents hold an audition for a new date for their off spring. The mother picks out a date and the father picks out a date for their kid. The next day the kid, the parents, and the kid's boy/girl friend are all grouped together. The kid goes out on a date with the mother's pick and then the father's pick. The boy/girlfriend watch with the kid's parents as the kid is followed with a video camera on their date. The parents make comments and the undesirable makes comments (usually of a semi-hilarious nature). At the end of the series of dates the kid descides whether or not to stay with their current mate or to ditch the undesirable and start dating one of the parents choices (on occassion the kid decides to rid themselves of all attachments and opt for the one is the loneliest number mantra). The kid goes through all of the dates and tells each potential mate good things about them and bad things about them. 



*Veronica Mars is the best show on television period (.)



*Imagine if you will that Logan and Veronica are back together (perhaps they will be due to the greatness of the Rob)



[Mr. Mars does not like Logan Echolls, especially since he's dating his daughter Veronica. In a desprate attempt to salvage the damage that Logan has inflicted on Veronica (views not held by LoVe fans) he enlists the help of MTV to find Veronica a more suitable and perhaps non-tried for criminal offenses date. He holds an audition for Veronica's next date and finds a suitable choice (it was difficult- he had to reveiw such great catches as lamb, vinni, cliff, leo, star bucks guy, and duncan's cousin earl). The next day Mr. Mars, Veronica, and the oh so delicious Logan (sorry... I'm trying to be impartial) gather. Mr. Mars reveals that his choice for Veroica is  Cassidy Casseblancus. Veronica and Cassidy go out on the date only to be ridiculed by Logan back at the Ranch. He's so threatened by the beav that he takes the oppertunity to take a nap. Veronica and Cassidy appear to have fun. When Veronica gets home she leaves Cassidy to wait with the other men and deliberates who she's going to choose. She comes back (after comercial break of coarse) and faces everyone. ""Cassidy, you're a real sweet, loving, honest guy. Any girl would be lucky to have you- and Logan you're a self absorbed, ego maniac whose main interest is your own. So you guys can both understand why I have no choice but to choose Logan. {Logan and Veronica passionately embrace-man handle- make out, whatever your terminology).



**Part of the LoVe phonemina is that they have an animosity which is fueled by attraction. I'd thought I'd be clever with it. Anyway I hope it at least got a smirk or mild amusement from you guys."

 So I am done with the Monte Cristo project for Brown, now all that is left is to format it to MLA style. I also have to fix the header so that it reads the page number next to my name, I need help with that so I'll just ask someone at school tomorrow. I am so tired. I was going to do other stuff but I think that once I'm finished I'll just sleep until 6. I still have a lot of homework left to turn in but I'll get to it eventually. I am  going to have to quit Arbys. It takes too much away from my work."

"event","Hey LJ,

 So I've had important phone calls all day today. Yay! The first in the series and the second as well was Lisa who called to give me lots of baby sitting days in the spring and summer months as well as to ask what day I'd be graduating so that she can schedule it in her planner. Lisa is coming to graduation, yay! I love my Lisa, and Greg, and Gage! I can't wait to hang out with Gage again, soon he'll be making me ""bounce"" on the trampoline for countless hours. I've even missed Greg's ""nuke 'em all"" mentality. Extremists can be fun, especially the ones that are really kind and big hearted underneath their I hate everyone mask. 

 The third and last phone call belongs to a lady by the name of Sharon (at least I think her name was Sharon) from the Easter office inquiring as to whether or not I was still interested in going to Eastern. I was like ""yes!"" and she said that they were just waiting on my act scores and I told her that there was a ""complication"" with the Febuary test date and that I'd be taking the April 8th test. She said to make sure I had the results sent directly to Eastern and that I'd here whether or not I'd get in shortly after. She said she looked forward to having me there in the future! Yay go me! Okay, I know theres a big chance that everything will blow up in my face but right now there is hope! I want to celebrate with choclate or ice cream but after the ice cream sandwhich fiasco of a few days back I digress about the icecream. Guess what? I ate half a head of cabage for dinner! It filled me up, but I still finished off the rest of my box of cheez-it's, I am such a snacker. I want celebration food... an Arby's cookie would be nice. I have so much work to do! I am happy! This is such a turn from yesterday. I'm happy I took a personal day from work. I know that since I'm getting these babysitting days that I can put my 2 weeks notice in sooner than I expected. I think I should be done by May 8th. Yay, soon no more Arby's. A great graduation/birthday present. I want celebration food before instant star comes on!"

 So  I have a mountain like pile of homework that I have to get done today or else it is unlikely my grades will be something to write home about. More likely they'll be something I'll have to erase from my memory via psycosis and hypnosis. I can avoid all of that if I get my but on track today. I may have to pull an alnighter but thats not a prob, I got to sleep in today. I called off of work because I was sick so I have all of this time to do what I'm suppose to. What fun!"

"event","Hey LJ,

 The next two days are winter break so I guess I should sleep in and stuff. Well...at least I would if I didn't have to read brave new world, finish the project for brown, and go to work both days. I'll manage some shut eye however. I'm listening to Jack Johnson right now, I like his sound. I'm kind of in this weird mood/feeling place right now. I just piled off a bowl of some off brand cereal something crisp (I love it whatever it is) and feel replenished. I'm tired but I want to read some of the meg cabot book before I go to sleep. My plan tomorrow is to wake up at 10 ish maybe 11ish and read as much as I can before I do the whole shower thing and then the whole hi ho hi ho off to work I go jaunt. I'm tired but it doesn't ache my eyes, sleep. YOu know that feeling, the I'm fed and feel content and I'm drowsy but in a nice kind of way. It feels pretty good to feel. When I'm sick I like the kind of feeling it gives me at the heart of it all, you know if you strip away all of the stuffie nose aching head/ear whatever drama there is this kind of calm content feeling, like you're body gives you some kind of tanqilizer to get you through it all. Thats kind of cool, you're body is with you're mind the whole time, the perfect couple. I don't even know. I'm just writing. I wanted to write and I am (now I'm pathetically listening to Jesse McCartney. I can't help it, I like pop music. Bring it on."

 I just had some lunch a while ago and cold diet pepsi is bliss. I desprately need to take a shower and will in due coarse. I'm trying to download life house but Mercora is being a beotch. I have to listen to the veronica's yet again, there driving me crazy! I need different music. I am too eclectic to be stuck in this music hell. Not that there bad, I love them, not 24/7 though. I watched my soap all my children and will watch general hospital in a few. I have to call Ellie to see if she is in town. Before I make a visit I should take a shower and brush the teeth. The day is so bright and blue and sunny-I love it! I'm actually going to have a meeting with the Admission officers at Eastern, a certain favorite teacher is taking me. Thats to come in the next week or two. I will look over the ACT registration stuff today or tomorrow. Oy with the poodles already (did anyone see that episode of the Gilmore Girls, speaking of which one of the greatest compliments I ever received was from this guy Matt who said that I reminded him of Rory in a good way. Yay for me.)! Jessica when you read this comment, I know Ellie and Melody are still breathing, I need to know that you're alive aswell. By the way if you could message Deedra/ give me her e-mail that would be great. I would like to establish connections at Eastern."

 I came to work all messed up today. Thank God Sherry was there. She told me to make myself whatever I wanted and to sit down and take a breather. Adam gave me a hug as soon as he found out what was going on and Rick was really sweet and let me off work early so Adam could give me a ride. Work definately soothed me. Soon, Adam me and Ellie are going to hang out. Right now where all kind of screwed up and mutual bonding time will be good for everybody. It still hurts but now I can smile and mean it. I smiled a lot at work today. I even flirted with this guy who was out with his grandparents who goes to central, that also helped my morale. My mother on the other hand... I'll tackle that one on a later post. WAtch V-Mars, it is one of the only good things left for me! Let it be good to you too! Bye! Love and peace and all that mother jazz."

 Muhahahaha! and the plot thickens... So I was wondering how the whole Hannah thing would play out, of coarse I had my theories, and the lovely Rob Thomas decided to throw us a bone. Hannah is the daughter of the false witness/plastic surgeon (who works with the Fitpatricks) who placed Logan as the killer of Felix. I love the scene where Logan bends down so that the doctor can see him through the window right after Logan and Hannah kissed. It was total diabalicle evil Logan that the fans love him for. Yes, poor Hannah is a victim in this all but as this show has taught us good girls can't stay pure and naive forever. They have to break inorder to gain street smarts and grow as Veronica has and more recently Jackee has. The whole being played by Logan thing might actually fair well for Hannah, I mean her dad is shady and that could affect her. I liked Hannah as soon as she first appeared manning the carnivale both and throughly enjoyed the charm that Logan put on, it was oh so yummy and satisfying but they didn't have any chemistry...unlike Logan and Veronica. I loved that scene between them, there he was actually being true about his affections. It was great...""I'm sorry, we're all out of liquid evil."" There we're many highlights of this episode, I enjoyed it so much, it definately made me uber amber happy. I loved the whole cleaned up Eli look. I mean oh my gawd! All he needed was to wear some decent clothes and shave all that facial hair off and he was a total hottie. I knew Weevil had it with in him, seriously I thought to myself you know outside of his character he must look good in real life, that biker crap slows him down, and my thoughts were totally delivered on this episode. Hottie... not much romantic chemistry between him and Veronica though, I mean they do have great chemistry but its more of a friend peer on the same level power wise and admire each under it all kind of chemistry. I love the last scene where Veronica confesses she didn't turn him in so that she could go to the amusment park, well we know it wasn't totally that. I mean Weevil did escourt a very cute six year old around that must of yanked at V-Mar's heart strings, I know she did mine. So, any way, Beaver got hot. I mean before he always had this charm, fresh faced cutie thing going on but seriously he definately grew up! His neck veins...yum. Seriously its like he was projecting hormones through the tv screen, especially when Dick Jr. was trying to pop him one. I love him and Mac together, he keeps her gigly and she keeps him on the light side, something that was in serious jepordy with his 0'9er status/ brother/ and friendship with Logan. I did love how Logan stood by Beaver when he took Dick down (that sounds dirty). That was ingenius, the whole male drag queen prostitute bit, I mean I smelled it coming but it still rocked. I loved the scene where Wallace was throughing the balls over the dunking both, it was very endearing. Jackee has pulled a complete 180 or atleast has softened and realised that there are good people, its just that theres not that many. The whole Terrance and Mr. Mars thing made me sad, Mr. Mars' boyish faith was stomped on. I was mad that they didn't show the new trailer and UPN hasn't posted it on the website yet. Its a matter of time though. What did you guys think of the episode?

So on a more Amberish note I finally realised something, that I need to wake up. I can't do this just get by or didn't get by but managed to stay alive thing anymore. I finally woke up from the trance I was in, I just hope it lasts. Its gonna take a lot of work but I can't back down. My parents, my family is not there for me. I know I'm getting the boot when I'm 18, its not surprise, its quite the topic of conversation. Act's are this Saturday and classes are still in session. I need to get my ass in gear. I know it sucks and its going to continue to suck but I don't have a choice, not if I want to be the person I aim to be. Tomorrow I have to chat with some teachers, one in particular, as well as  get my priorities in check."

 So I did something I do well today, I didn't go to school. Don't worry I'm fighting my counter-school attitude by not sleeping so that I am up in time to catch the bus. Who cares that I have a sleeping disorder? I sure don't right now... that's cuz I'm listening to the Veronicas and am way to upbeat (the band has nothing to do with V-Mars). My not so smart manager gave me my check today and I so cashed it at the liquor store. We're not supposed to cash it till tomorrow. I know I seem diabolicle but I'm actually less than I appear. I cashed it after 8 and banks close it before then so I think I'm in the clear and if not I don't care. Let him get in trouble. Yes, I do mean that statement. Today he spent yelling at me because I was doing too many positions. He told me to stick to mine. Yet he left his and the orders got screwed up so I went back to covering the positions. I really fed up with my job. I mean I love the people there and what the job represents to me and what its gotten me through, but people I'm not good with systems. I see through them, partly because I'm a wholistic thinker and can put everything together really well and partly because I hate society and am anti-establishment. Its really messy thinking about it all. In our society there is the economy driven establishment, where there is a hierachy or sorts and workers below them that do their jobs and follow the rules of the establishment (look up Nietzsche, he has awesome views on morality and how what is seen as right is set by the ruling party). One may think that this is marxist but its not, at least according to western propaganda. Its equality but with a twist! Anyone can rise to the top but that doesn't mean everyone's at the same place. There is a class system, at least money wise. The poor, the middle class, the rich, etc... So, no, America is not marxist because its to multi-faceted. Its run by the economy and the government whereas marxism is the government and kills the economy because everyone is at the same place except the big brother figure (ex.1984) and no one can change there position. Thats why America's so special, it gives you control over your status, well excluding same-sex marriage, 'cuz thats not aloud. Sorry, too many play on words and paranoid theories distort my writing. Yeah, anyway I hate society. Its hypercritical and full of insert discrepency here (mine are: whack jobs, i.e. fundamentalist idiots, pretentious idiots, cult leaders and followers/drug doers/abusive parents people babysitters teachers kids bosses etc who do so- by abusive I mean violence, psychological crap, emotional/and people who don't think for themselves but buy into solely the ideas of others... I mean there are exceptions, but generally the former ususally nails it in the head). I'm not into darwinism, it bothers me because I associate it with the big bang theory where as I'm a there is a God fate/freewill astrologist. I read Freud's theory on society and it stuck with me because its biological and to me thats not appealing but I rationalized it and basically excepted it though I don't except it. It causes a lot of conflict with in me. Any way it deals with the ID, the ego, and the super ego. Its all basically society has come to be as a part of our evolution, that we developed culture and relationships because we supressed basic needs like sex. Its all, we couldn't be just thinking about food shelter water and mating anymore. We were evolving and in order to that we had to tone down our barbaric impulses and blah blah blah. So when ever I think of society I think of how Freud saw it and I see marxism, the uniform. I'm more of a pick random clothes off the floor kind of person than say wear the same thing as everyone else person. Oh, yeah. And the messages that America has been shooting out through advertisement, like ""be cool, be you"" or individuality being the anti drug thats all about keeping our economy running people, its to fit the need of the government. We are being led. In the pages that I did read of it (I finally gave up out of bordom/ Mrs. Pearson's hate of the book but I wish I held strong b/c during the class discussion the 2 minute hate and winston's torture were mentioned and they definately gave me plenty to think about) had messages like ""war is peace"" etc... so that the government could control its population for its own means. Yeah, I do know this sounds radical. Come on, I'm  full of skeptism and I'm also riding a its 2:30 something in the morning on a school night high, so don't totally write me down as a radical thinker. Well, actually I am. Thats partly why I trust fewer than five people."

 So they let me off early, yay! Now I'm warm and in the confort of my own home. I was lucky and Caitlyn ended up giving me a ride home, it was a bitch walking to work with those winds and the snow. I had to stop at Jessica's house and pay her back for the payed membership she got me with her credit card. We talked for a while but I hope sometime soon we'll have some one on one time because she is a very comforting presence and awesomeness. Here dogs have gotten so big since the last time I saw them.  (Oha and Jessica/Melody/Ellie, Cordellia and Willow are on V-mars, in semi-regular spots, come on, watch the show).

 Steph and I were talking on line and somehow I came around to shedding some insight on my dad. I thought it was worth being mentioned here:(I'm talking about their weird demanding work hours) they've been doing it for so long, there used to it. i think the work makes my dad meaner, actually i know it does. its hard to be empathetic when he takes it out on everybody emotionally. i know how it feels to walk in the snow to work. when it snows he's out there unloading the truck. i want to be able to relate to him but he does things like put key locks on the tv's and has motion detector lights set on auto. if i want to take a bath or the shower i have to get up mid way and wave my arms around outside the tub so the lights come back. he constricts freedom. it ends up making him as miserable as he makes others feel. i'm happy i'm not him. thats a depressing way to be. pulling people down to your level so that you don't feel alone in the misery"

"event","Hey LJ,

 So yet again I was looking at the posts and I decided to comment. I have a problem though, I wrote way too much, however this is what I think will happen:

Okay in the spoilers for Veronica Mars, in episode 16, Logan is suppose to tell Hannah why he is really dating her. The spoilers also say that Logan searches Hannah's computer. Rob Thomas gave an interview that said that Logan will have a love interest more his age (after Kendall) but that with Logan you have to watch his intentions. Also, didn't Rob Thomas create Medium or have something do to with that show (another really good show by the way)? I searched the actress the plays Hannah and found her on an episode of Medium. When Rob Thomas has a favorite he uses them, he liked the actress that auditioned for Veronica so much that he gave her the part of Meg. Meg did end up dying though. Okay, the LoVe shipper in me wants Veronica and Logan back together so my theory has heavily to do with that, its biased. I think Logan dates Hannah because she has something to do with proving him self innocent, like maybe she has something to do with the Fizpatrick's (in the spoilers though Hannah's mom has a problem with something to do with Logan and the trial so maybe she isn't involved with the organized crime...) or helping his case. I personally beleived that Veronica and Logan will get back together. They've never had sex before. Logan gets involved with Kendall and uses sex to kind of get over (though he hasn't) Veronica. Theres a scene where Logan comments on Veronica and Duncan's sex life by saying something to the effect of ""if you cuddle afterwards your not doing it right"" This points out Logan's shallowness when it comes to sex and relationships. And as for Veronica and Duncan the first time they had sex she thought she was raped (yes, I know that was cutting and I'm sorry...) but when they had sex without being intoxicated or drugged it was kind of a cutsey kind of thing, I mean I'm sure they enjoyed it yet. I think that somehow Veronica and Logan will end up having sex and it will kind of this transcendent experience for them (please don't shoot me for referencing buffy but the first time Angel and Buffy had sex he turned into a vampire b/c he had complete happiness and passion and the curse that was placed on him dictated that as soon as he was happy he would be all grrr again because he didn't deserve happiness), a deep kind of soul-matish love or bond will be discovered. I mean Logan grew so much being with Veronica but they really didn't have a shot under the circumstances at the time. Logan is at this crossroad where he is trying to prove his innocence but he's still causing trouble. I mean the guy's like is hell, his mom died (atleast supposebly, as far as he knows anyway), his first love died, his father: killed and had an affair with Lilly and tried to kill Veronica, not to mention he's framed for murder and his house was burned down. He's pushing back though and creating more problems. I want Logan to be proved innocent but what is he going to do once he is? Probably get into more trouble, thats why Veronica had to let him go. He has a lot of potential but needs to come to terms with his life as well as find his thing and the right influences. I think that through Veronica change for the better can occur with him, or she could inspire/keep him changed. Theres some things in the works now that look promising for the reformation with Logan. On the last episode of Veronica Mars Weevil was kicked out of his group/ gang and blackmailed. Veronica is friends with Weevil not just because of the protection but because he has potential and diplays humanity. If Weevil can find his own path and if the link between him and Logan mutates into friendship thats a possitive influence on Logan and step in the right direction. Beaver and Mac look like they'll hook up which would bring the Beav to the light side (I mean he has a lot of potential but he's passive, he's to easily swayed and has done stupid things to fit in) then Logan will have yet another possitive influence. And as for dick...theres not much hope for growth but if he hooks up with a good girl and is intrigued enough maybe he'll drop his bad actions. If Logan can get himself together than him and Veronica will have a lasting relationship. Veronica still cares about Logan, when he saved her at the river styx and they got back in his car she looked beyound tortured and inwardly conflicted.  She doesn't want him to keep putting himself in danger, she doesn't want to loose him. During the scene at the dance with Jacke and Logan it wasn't just about Wallace. I mean as soon as she found out him and Kendall were together she put her two cents in (but for Veronica her 2 cents are like 50 billion dollars compared to most people) as well as tried to protect him by giving him heads up. There is a spoiler about Veronica confronting Logan about Hannah, do you sence a pattern? Also, most every episode they have one signature scene where they're together and the chemistry and witty banter (called the new four play by the LoVe shippers) is shinning through. Oh, and to cover another strand. Remember when Veronica was on TV talking to the psyic? Jacke said that she told her about the boob cream but not about Lilly. That is errie and may be forshadowing something, maybe cataclysmic. I mean the ghost of Lilly has already appeared in the show. If Rob Thomas is involved with medium then I don't think we can discount this. Will Logan end up getting Veronica hurt... it could be nothing but with this show you never know. Also I'm just can throw a bone out there and say the mayor caused the bus crash in order to win the election, you know good publicity to take care of the situation, I mean he did tell his daughter not to ride the bus home. Sorry for writing so much..."

 I was at IMDB trying to find out who the director of Veronica Mars was (I want to search for their interveiws to get some more info and possibly spoilers... I don't know if Its Rob Thomas, I know he heavily contributes to the editing storyline and writing of the show... so anyway I found this post from this girl who totally made me laugh b/c of how advid a fan she is. I totally agreed with her comment, its sad but I was thinking along the lines of the same thing:

They will definitely get back together. There is a connection. This is sooo Old School but they remind me of Joey/Pacey/Dawson. Pacey being Logan and Dawson being Duncan. The way that Veronica and Logan are always snarky with each other and so were Joey and Pacey.

please dont relate the awsomeness of v mars with the lamt teen angst from dawson's creek. logan is nothing like that pansy pacey. who the hell names their kid pacey. logan is funny, sarcsttis, rude, but has an amszing heart which he does show off for those he cares about. like when he though veronica was being kidnapped and taken to the camalot inn, did he hesitate to go save her and fight for her if necessary no. that pantywaist pacey would probably be to afraid he's gonig to get bruised to fight for his woman like logan does.

 So I skated through school today, I had a good aerobics workout though. Not much going on in that department besides from me advertising Veronica Mars to the best of my ability. I so need this show on more many seasons. Opra's on........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................now. I was counting down to 4. 

I was suppose to see the chronicles of narnia for my friend Brandon's birthday except I had to back out on the deal. I buy my own groceries and owe Jessica money. Sometimes even I need to be responcible. I'll get my paycheck next Wensday (same day as new Veronica Mars episode... Logan and Heather, ew, I have a theory about them. If anyone is interested comment about it). I'm living pay check to pay check. Sadderness. 

I pissed my mom off. She looked really mad. Somehow I don't care. She's a user. Yes, I am speaking badly about the mother of the amberness... it goes deeper but I'm saving it for my memoirs.

Its so cold in my room and Opra's been on for 4 minutes. I guess there is balance in the world. :) Its hard looking at my lj user pic, I want them to be together...

So, next on the agenda is me getting a life. Nah, I'll just get through this dry patch, the following hurdle, the calm break, the period of anxiety, the season of fear, and the month of antisipation and I'll have completed my senior year. I got to get out of this place... in more way than one."

Please watch Veronica Mars! I'm pulling out all of the stops here... its so worth it. Trust me. If you never watched I'll catch you up. I mean I have video clips at my disposal, not to mention a link to direct you to a music video of v-mars/rent and v-mars/buffy. Come on, thats quality stuff guys. Half a million viewers... the show needs half a million viewers. There budget sucks and the more viewers the bigger budget which equals an even better show. So you can help save a show and make it better. Now don't you feel special... well you will when you start watching.

 So, I talked to Mrs. Panci today. Lately I have been feeling not myself. She put things into perspective with me. I need time to process it.

Okay, so I dyed my hair! I thought it was an amberish blonde yesterday but today its definately more light blonde, its the light that makes it look golden. 

Went to school late and had taco bell for lunch. Finally tried their fresco chalupa's (of coarse had it with beans instead of meat), they were good. I'm kind of hankering for choclolate and find myself plotting to venture to krogers.

I talked way too much today in world lit, everybody must think I'm a know it all. It was good though because I like to talk about books, especially when many don't have that great of an understanding of the work in question, I like to put my 2 cents in. I'm hungry for some choclate and sorta tired. I have to study for the act's tonight, I'm taking them the 11th, What Joy. 

I'm sure there will be more to say as the night progresses but here's some Veronica Mars to tie you over:

 Veronica Mars was pretty good, I can tell their setting up the rest of the season nicely. The scene with Weevil on the bus reminded me of me today. We're both seniors in high school who have to suffer the humiliation of the bus... well of coarse his is more so, I mean being beaten up by your gang and disowned by them not to mention have your bike trashed and former gang mate black mail is pretty tough to live with the next day at school.

 So I got paid today, it was like a hundred dollars. Half of it is gone now though, I had to buy groceries. I bought lots of healthy vegitarian stuff but did manage to stop by the dollar store to get  my candy fix. Please do not inquire on the amount of tootsie pops I consumed, I'd rather not say. They were good though and I don't feel to full so I put myself about even today on the whole food consuming scale. Jason Mraz's new music video is so funny, I was laughing out loud. None of you have submited anything in regards to the scavenger hunt, so I guess I'll just scrap the idea. It was innovative, you must give me that. Mrs. Gwaltney let me borrow some advanced readers today, the one I am currently reading made me laugh numerous times. I can't beleive I'm reading it. I really need to refine my tastes. The book in question is pure garbage yet I'm a good ways through it. Perhaps its me researching my future competition or perhaps its to avoid the 1984 garbage mandeville has us reading for ap. I don't care to dwell any deeper than that. I'm going to start exercising again, like I usually do when spring is a few months away. I'll be happy to lean down some of this bulky muscle I've gained from strengh training. I bought like 8 gatorades to help me in this exercising endevear. This year I want to transition into an endurance runner, I hate being a sprinter. Marie W. may give me her bike as mine has gone to hell. I can't wait to go back to my biking but I still have a good two months, maybe two months and a half before the weather subsides. Its freezing in my room right now. Tomorrow Floyd and I are going to decorate a cake for catie and possible give it to her. I don't know what's gonna happen with the transpertation but it will be funny to find out. Byez!"

 So, I just got a myspace page. I've been spending a lot of time on it searching people. Man, and to think I'm against the whole trend of teenagers being addicted to the web.
 Work was work today but at least I got to see Adam. He seemed happy to see me, that made me feel better. I'm still a little vulnerable though. I mean, with the whole stephanie re-emergence into my life and my best friend getting a new set of friends everything has left me mixed up. I'm possesive of my friends, my really close ones, and that's why I'm having such a hard time with the adam not paying me attention situation. We're all aloud to go a weekend ignoring our friends especially if its for them to spend time with their main squeeze. I just freaked out. I do that a lot. I'm sorry guys, the Amberness sucks sometimes. Its better that I admit whats going on than hide it so thats why I'm writing all of this."

"event","Hey LJ,

 Is it wrong to want complete loyalty? I feel so sad. I'm listening to Jason Mraz's cover of stand by me and I really want someone to stand by me. I guess we all do. I'm feeling comprimised and sad. I know that that's a lot to ask but everyone deserves to have someone you can always count, so one whose true and loyal to you. I just called Adam and I am angry with him. I feel like he's made this little community with Ellie Jess and Melody that doesn't include me 'cuz I'm the fifth wheel, I feel like he's found something better. I know I should support him in this because I want for him what he wants its just that Adam's been there for me more than most and its like he's left his post so that he can finally be happy. I don't mean to be dramatic I'm just feeling so melancholic about it. I mean I talked to Stephanie tonight and we're friends again but the big thing with her was that she didn't stand by me. Not completely and our friendship ended because of it. I realize that it wasn't a great situation to be in and I don't blame her anymore or resent her. As soon as heard life was rocky with her from Jacky I had to get in touch with her and be there for her. All the resentment I had couldn't hide how much I cared about her. Adam was supposed to take me to see underworld 2 with him, it was something we had both been planning for a long time. He started dating Ellie and its like his priorities drastically shifted, like when casey was dating scott. He tried to get in touch with me and was given the rub by little brother because he's a jackass but I feel like Adam uses my situation as an excuse, Like he didn't want me there with him and Ellie. I mean underworld was our thing. And now its not. I feel like we no longer share a common bond besides a job. I'm so independant all the time because I have to be and I have so few people I can count and its like I can't even do that, Like i have to bear the whole world on my shoulder like Atlas. I have to do it all alone. That scares me so much, being completely by myself. There has to be some one out there who can be there and who will always be there for me. I completely understand Adam's priority with Ellie it's just that it shows me how alone I really am. I'm not saying anything against those guys, to tell you the truth I love them being together its just my insecurities are put on display. I know how completely unreasonable it is to expect someone to live for you, because is that not loyalty but to be true to a person and everything they are. I definately can't keep on expecting that from my friends like Stephanie, like Adam, its just I feel like I need that kind of devotion. I want to give someone else that kind of devotion to, I did to Stephanie and Adam its just I get hurt. A lot of this has to do with filling in the wholes that my family left, I need support. I have to be so strong all the time and feel so different than everyone else. To be honest I hate society and most people. I need somebody who I don't hate, like adam and steph, but who will be complete in loyalty. The more I write this I realize what I'm asking for goes beyond friendship. There I go again trying to fill in wholes with other ones. Let's just start knew, I have these wholes and I'll always have them but I need something so possitive that its greater than what I've lost. It's not easy keeping myself together, its painful and tough and depressing. I don't want to feel alone anymore."

 Before 8pm I went to Krogers yesterday. I bought food because I was hungry and my few dollars were burning a hole in my pocket. On my way back home the rain fell like snow but sounded like itself. Everything was dark and wet. The 7 block, ie the mini malls' stores, all were lit which gave light to see the cars in their parking spaces and the blurs of cars moving around. The cold etched my skin with wind and chill. There was a feeling of darkness but of life- like the kind of darkness many people don't see because its covered for them or because they covered it themselves. I keep on stumbling on these scenes that one day I hope I have the eloquence to depict in verse. It takes time."

 So, I spent the day waiting. I still have dollars to go but patience- the wallet, is growing thin. My AP English teacher says that cliche's equal bad writing, which also equates to repetiveness being bad. I disagree, its all about the usage. If you're skilled you can handle the cloud nines and the very verys. But thats for cheddar and the mac is the why I was waiting. To be blunt (smirk... good ol' 'beautiful' james)I was waiting to hear from Stephanie.

 So, guess what song I'm listening to right now? Its very theraputic, a matra to add to my collection of mantra's. Its one love, lyrics by the bob (marley) and cover by mr-az. It makes me happy.

"event","Hey LJ,

 So today was spent reclusively. I called Adam and talked to him for a while about how his date went with Ellie and tortured him by complaining about my period. He got me back by telling his parents I was on the rag and mentioning to anyone that would listen my parents absurd theory that I'm a lesbian. The whole lesbian theory doesn't add up, I get all hot and bothered just by looking at a picture of Johnny Depp and harbor strong feelings for the lead singer of the killers... he's too hot. Yeah, a pattern may be noticed about how the guys that I listed are all unattainable and unaquaintable to me. Its not to say that I haven't been attracted to guys more closer to me geographically its just that theres the whole mess of the real world vs. the escapist make beleive world Johnny and Brandon live in. In the make beleive world its safe to fanasize about a guy because he ""turns me on"" because he can be anything I want him to be. In the real world I feel like I'm surrounded by uncompatible guys, most of whom seem to be on some kind of narcotic, alcoholic fix, or have attitude goneria (might as well compare it to a std, its about as attractive). Theres been one reliable guy in my life but theres a difference between best friend and boyfriend. I need a guy whose sensitive, charming, intelligent, compassionate, whose not addicted or on narrcotics/ alcohol, strong, and accepting. Oh yeah, the whole mutual attraction and interest should definately be there or I'd either have a gay friend or just plain straight friend. So anyway steering clear of my likes moonlight walks on a beach spiel, today was a rather domestic one. I did not once leave my house but on several occasions opened the fridge door. I've working on my colleage thirty without actually being in colleage. Its a way I work through my depression. I eat. Its not very healthy. It the trend continues as it has I'll be the next kristie allie. I'm a melanchotic addict at times. I picked out all of my eye lashes. I'm really depressed. Its bareable and thankfully not too tinged with loneliness. *Breathes out heavilly and snorts and satirically inward taunts the heavy breathing out*. Josh turned 14 a few days ago, I managed as in tradition, to miss the celebrations by playing ddr w/ adam and escaping to eastern (not ohio), all parties were pleased with my absence at the festivities. I want to write but can't. I was in the pre-writing, brainstorming, researching, compiling, beginning drafts stage when my weaknesses came to clear to step around. I want to be a writer of teen fanasy. Right now I'm not equiped to be. I need many classes on psychology, philosophy, history... to answer the questions I've been asking during the pre-writing processes, the wrighting-creating process. I can't construct without it. I've been studying publishing houses on book ends. If I run across a name I don't know I research it. Chicken house is a division of scholastics., for example. Mr. Keys told me about how the publishing houses are condensing. I've noticed subdivisions of scholastics and randomhouse, there like these monolithic structures. I wanted to work at a publishing company but it doesn't seem like it'd be what I romantasized of a network that consisted of real people that I'd see and interact with, cozy and friendly enough to know most personaly and share the same love of reading, writing. More truly its a place where economics play best. I'm not into that corprate scene. I don't want to contribute to turning writers into dollar signs and treating there sales as the most important thing. Mrs. Pearson predicted the rise of e-books in the future and internet publications. She suggested that I get into computers. I think I'll take her advice. I'm planing on majoring in english (not education) and minoring in philosophy. Its safe to say my job oppertunities will be limited. Anything that gives me an edge is probably welcome. Last semester of high school doth approach... I embrace it with open arms. I need to graduate soon. The whole being ruled by the edicts of the educational system, at least at high school level, is not for me.

 So, Mary's mother died. Mary is Lisa's sister in law, her brother Dennis's wife. Lisa had to go to the funeral today so I volunteered to watch Gage for her. It was pretty unexpected, her getting the phone call. We were cleaning the laundry room and her sister Ginny called to tell her. 

At about midnight Lisa took Josh,Gage, and I to tace bell. There was this one where it was opened, including the diner, until  4am. It was pretty cool hanging out in there. The only down side was Josh ordered Two combos! This kid is really something. The day before that he tried to order an extra large blizzard from dairy queen. I swear. His mouth and his stupdiy drove him home. Its not very likely Lisa is going to have him over again. 

I just got up and had some raisinets for breakfast. I'm probably going to  have something else. I'm just waiting for Gage to get up. He woke me up at three am 'cuz he was out of his bed playing movies in the room where I was sleeping. It took 10 minutes to get him off to sleep. As long as your consistant he listens."

Ughh... I'm so nervous about tomorrow... :( It's about one and I have to be up by 7:30... I guess I'll go to sleep eventually. My mind keeps racing about a bunch of things.. Such as my fucking sticky keyboard... Sorry if this is just me rambling...But guess what? if I'm on your f-list and you choose to read it,IT'S YOUR PROBLEM, bitches... mwhahaha..That's my philosophy about LJ in general... This LJ is for me and those who I choose to let read it and those that express an interest.. If you don't like wat you read... don't read it! It's really that simple. I know that sounds like lame bitchery... and it is, but you lovely people and i do love all of you in one way or another... didn't pay for dis space... I do.. and I feel that i can say what I want and I think that goes for all people and shouldnt be limited to just me or just another person. Like say if i really didnt want people reading I'd either take them off the list or do a post where they can't read or whatever. This is the space where I get to talk, and I think I should have the right to. And if I want to talk about how disgusting my room is or how i'm terrified about my first day at work.. i shall and if your along for the ride great and if your not.. read not this Journal of Live...

 As I've said millions of times, or so it seems, sorry its been so long since the last time I've updated. If I had it my way I would update atleast twice a day but unfortunetly I do not. I'm at Lisa's right now (not the lovely peanut butter but an equally as lovely person) and she let me go on her computer b/c she rocks. She also gave me this magazine with this article on Johnny Depp, which just made me feel awesome.

  Okay, so I happened to notice the vast amount of comments that I received for my last entry. I have to say, that was probably my most popular entry ever. Of coarse I didn't read most of the comments, I went to my e-mail and read like maybe two from anna. I was quite surprised that alyssa posted, not surprised enough to actually read what she wrote but surprised none the less. its a shame that my most commented entry has to go unread. However I think its very funny how people have enough time to comment so many times on my livejournal. *Anna and Bridgette, you two are very sweet and I owe  you both an ice cream for being so positive. You two are great sisters. 

  So yesterday was great. Lisa picked Josh and I up to help her clean her house in exchange for goodies. I settled on ice cream and Josh choose this Detroit hat. Lisa also took us out to del taco (disgusting, basically) and to get movies from block buster. We didn't end up cleaning yesturday but that is our mission today. Lisa let us sleep over so we all slept until 12:30. I got my period today which is kinda cool cuz if i'd gotten it yesterday I couldn't of gone in the hot tub. The hot tub and pool were nice. Especially the hot tub. I talked to Adam the other day and we caught up on stuff. When he was on the phone with me a buyer came over to talk to him about buying his car. It was a pretty lucky phone call I guess. Um... Sherri's the new general manager at arby's cuz Bob got another job. I'm happy for her.

A lot has been going on with me lately. I think a big entry will cite this claim in the future. Right now I'm just kind of relaxing my nerves. 

Jessica, I still have your present at my house. I keep calling you so that I can drop it off but I always get the answering machine-Working girls are busy but the money makes it worth it.

Anna and Bridgette rock.
so does peanut butter.

"event","<P>Hey LJ, So my mom just changed the light bulbs in the office so everything is now really bright. She's trying out a new painting style to the office as I speak. My mom loves those home and gardening shows. Okay everybody (I feel like Dr. Nick from the Simpsons) I can finally finish my rebuttal to the stephanie letter. I noticed I have two comments, there from Stephanie and Jake. I'm not going to read them for many reasons. The hilarity of it is Stephanie lied. Here let's play spot the lie. Its easy, I'll highlight the lie in the letter. All you have to do is read. Enjoy: 5:42PM - To Amber, you really were one of my best friends... In case you didn't know, it wasn't up to me that you had to move out. I have only ever been a friend to you. I opened my house to you and let you share a bedroom but hey, I guess that wasn't good enough for you, was it? It isn't my fault that you had to leave so stop blaming me. Maybe if you had gotten a job like you said you were going to (instead of just mooching off my family) then my mom may have been more inclined to let you stay. She really couldn't afford to support another child on her $9 an hour salary... hell she can barely afford to support herself, if you don't believe me on that then take her second job as proof of that now. You really are being an ungratefull bitch and I'm sick of it. I didn't want this to be an end of our friendship but I guess I have no choice in that now do I? You really need to grow up and stop pretending like every one is against you. You weren't friendless three weeks ago, I was still your friend. The only reason I'm not now is from your own doing. You really need to realize that, tho yeah your life might not be the best, it still isn't that bad. Eddie was right, you really do exaggerate things. I can't imagine what it is you're telling people that happened, although I'm sure it isn't the truth. I would have thought that you would have been mature enough to call me up and tell me what you thought, instead of letting me learn of it from your LJ. But no, I've realized lately that you don't confront your problems, you just run away. You ran away from your parents rather than tell them how you feel, and now you're running away from me rather than talking things out. So yeah, grow up. <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Oh, and you don't have to make your LJ ""friends only"" anymore, I'm through reading it. After all, I only read that of my friends.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>I decided to bold it too to add more of an effect. Its very funny that she would comment, which implies that she read my livejournal after she said she would not anymore. Drat, I guess I'm not that lucky to have her stop reading my LJ's. I guess they're just that addicting.</FONT></P>
<P>So anyway this is just a rant that will take the place of my rebuttal. I wrote it yesterday after I got booted off of my computer:</P>
<P>Your mom didn't have a second job when I lived at you house- me ""mooching of your family"" didn't drive her to that. I wasn't the cause for your mother's second job. And as for your mother &nbsp;having trouble taking care of&nbsp; you that was pretty evident when your mother moved you in with relatives. You have scholarships to colleage as well as aid. You have medical care under my child and your mom gets food stamps. Your mom has gone on/ planned two out of country trips over the last year. If she's having trouble supporting you then why is she continuing to vacation out of country? Not to mention you don't have a job yourself have already graduated and are almost 18-adult status. How is it my fault your mom had to get a second job or that the first only pays nine dollars an hour, especially after I only stayed half a month at your house? And as for the term mooching of your family I say ha! I actively helped manage ""your room"" not to mention did my share of chores. And as for the not having a job while living under your roof i was under the impression that you were aware of how I left my social security number at my house. With out a social security number how can I get a job? I can understand how you could beleive that I was a mooch if I used my lack of social security number as an excuse for not getting a job but I didn't. After a few attempts of getting my social security number including requesting it from the school I managed to get it from my old job as well as get put on the next available schedule at Arby's. I went back to an old job I didn't like so that I wouldn't be such a burden. In that time period you didn't even get a job. I didn't run away from my problems Stephanie, I faced them. I did therapy with my parents as well as sought guidance from many adult individuals such as two school social workers and a school counselor. I considered many options including job corps and emancipation. Due to parental consent needed for those paticular options I could follow through with them. I couldn't move in with any other family members because of extreme poverty, alcolism, or abandonment (that would be my real father on two of those counts, but the two former counts fell on many of my family members). Oh yeah, and since I didn't want to be raped with a curling iron I opted not to go to Vista Marie's. It was dangerous and oppressive at my house. I made a decision to try to live somewhere else and it didn't work out. Not because I gave up but because your mom kicked me out of my house because she was in cahoots with my parents. You knew before hand and you didn't even warn me. You didn't even stick up for me, or try to contact me afterwards. You tell so many different stories Stephanie. On one hand you were scared to call me because of my parents and on the next you say I don't have it so bad and to stop exaggerating. Make up your mind- not that it matters. I don't need you to define my experience b/c when you do it it fits your mood. The state of things don't change because you say they do. Stop venting your frustration out on me. Our disdain for each other is mutual. I said my peice and you said yourse. I don't have time for your drama anymore. And if you do thats sad because you could be doing other productive things like getting a job or working on gaining morale fiber. We're not friends, why discuss it?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So yeah that was the rant. I through responding to her. I'm not going to read her comments or Jake's for my own peice of mind. </P>
<P>So anyway I cleaned a lot today, watched the new degrassi and instant star, ate pizza, and gave my dad no choice but to let me on the computer considering I scrubbed down the bathroom for 1 1/2 hours not to mention various other things. The babysitting buisness is shifting towards very promising. My mom just made me fliars and buisness cards. I'm going to post them soon but I have to study for the high school equivalency exam and the act's. Casey got a 26 on her act's but is going to take it again and actually study for it this time. I really think she can pull a thirty on it.</P>
<P>*Something amusing Josh said to me today: ""You're getting fat. I'm going to start calling you mini van."" There you have it, yet another nick name graces me.</P>
<P>adieu from Mini Van, honk honk</P>"

"event","Hey LJ,

 Sorry I haven't been able to update lately people. I've been trying to update lately but my mom wouldn't let me on the computer because:her apprehension to let me on it because of the viruses her computer received due to the boys downloading stuff, her having to work the closing shifts, family from tennesse coming in, and her whole power struggle thing she does with holding possesions infront of me. I asked dad if he would let me on his labtop and he said, ""I don't mean to be mean (pause) but I don't want to make your computer use a habit."" I know what I made of that comment but I'll leave you guys to have your own opinions. So anyway, after nagging my mom upteenth times she finally caved in and let me get on the computer to update. So here I am.

This past week was very eventful. I had an awesome time with Lisa (not the beautiful peanut butter) Anna, and Bridgette seeing the premere of Charlie and the Choclate factory, eating taco bell and going to the Harry Potter party. Lisa paid for my ticket to Charlie and the Chocolate factory as a late birthday present dispite the fact that I had the money to pay for it ten fold (the baby sitting buisness has been booming). Lisa opted to see darkness falls instead of c and c because she thought the latter would be stupid based on the preveiws. The movie turned out to be amazing and not just b/c Johnny graced the screen. It had everyone beaming and chanting the movie's hyms after it was through. I got a nice pop and popcorn buzz to boot. Taco bell was great, Lisa picked up the tab for all of us. Anna got two free cinnasyx because she found a dead fly in hers and I saw Trina and her gang. The harry potter party was the highlight of my evening. As soon as I got there I started answering trivia questions and basically knew them all. I was covered in stickers from answering the questions correctly. I spotted a lot of school friends and jessie, ellie, and katie. Anna and Bridgette had loads/tons of fun on the heavy nostolgia. I was beaming b/c of the anticipation and because I felt like I belonged there. In that waldon books lay people who had a similar infatuation that I did, Harry Potter, that united us all. I don't think I've ever had a feeling of belonging to that scale before, it was almost overwhelming. Anna, Bridgette, and I won an honorable mention in the costume contest (yes I dressed up! Ofcoarse, I'm Amber) for our ensemble peice of Anna, as a which, conjuring bridgette, as moaning mertle, as a patronas to cast away me, as a dementor. We won a deluxe box of every flavor beans. I chatted up strangers and made new friends everywhere I went (I was being really active and involved). I was number 91 in line due to picking up my reservation slip late which is poetic justice since i reserved the book in January. I traded for number 92 because Stephanie was close to my spot in line. I didn't want to have her try to talk to me or have Anna and Bridgette yell at her not to mention I wanted to perserve the good time I had.
After I said my good byes and got home I started reading. Dispite the constant interruptions of chores and finding new locations due to noise I finished reading that same day. I couldn't sleep for hours after finishing it because of how distraught I was not to mention my brain was buzzing w/ theories. first theory/ R.A.B. is Regulas Black. Second theory/ Wormtail will be crucial in the last book due to him owing Harry for saving his life in the Prizoner of Azkaban.

So my aunt evalin and cousin angie and three little cousins came to visit me from tenesse. I spent a lot of time with them and we ended up bonding. Jessica, the little cousin that bonded with me most was named Domn just like Dom Mon!

So I said good bye to my family early this morning and spent the rest of the day brainstorming/outlining a novel I'm going to write. I fantastically outlined the whole plot from beginning, middle, and end and have plan for an action packed sequel. But first I have to write the origional. I have ""listen to your heart"" as a chant to get me through the drafts.

Mom gets paid tomorrow and said if I clean she'll give me money. I like money.


Since it's been awhile since I've been able to come on live journal I haven't been able to read respones from those who read my journal. I remember leaving a pressing  entry so I had a hunch that I'd get a responce or two. I was right. The following is the responce I received to that journal. They posted it on their livejournal. Here is what it read:

5:42PM - To Amber, you really were one of my best friends...
In case you didn't know, it wasn't up to me that you had to move out. I have only ever been a friend to you. I opened my house to you and let you share a bedroom but hey, I guess that wasn't good enough for you, was it? It isn't my fault that you had to leave so stop blaming me. Maybe if you had gotten a job like you said you were going to (instead of just mooching off my family) then my mom may have been more inclined to let you stay. She really couldn't afford to support another child on her $9 an hour salary... hell she can barely afford to support herself, if you don't believe me on that then take her second job as proof of that now. You really are being an ungratefull bitch and I'm sick of it. I didn't want this to be an end of our friendship but I guess I have no choice in that now do I? You really need to grow up and stop pretending like every one is against you. You weren't friendless three weeks ago, I was still your friend. The only reason I'm not now is from your own doing. You really need to realize that, tho yeah your life might not be the best, it still isn't that bad. Eddie was right, you really do exaggerate things. I can't imagine what it is you're telling people that happened, although I'm sure it isn't the truth. I would have thought that you would have been mature enough to call me up and tell me what you thought, instead of letting me learn of it from your LJ. But no, I've realized lately that you don't confront your problems, you just run away. You ran away from your parents rather than tell them how you feel, and now you're running away from me rather than talking things out. So yeah, grow up. Oh, and you don't have to make your LJ ""friends only"" anymore, I'm through reading it. After all, I only read that of my friends.

This is my rebuttle to this comment-
I used to think I really was one of Stephanie's best friends. I thought that Stephanie was the litteral answer to my prayers to god about having a best friend that wanted to hang out and would be a great asset to my life. I prayed that after Casey and mine's friendship fell apart. However, I look back on Stephanie and I's friendship now and have doubts that it was even real. I thought it was. I don't know how it couldn't of been due to what we shared and the times we had together. Still, the question was never of our earlier friendship it was of the test. The test was me moving into her house. That day that I moved out I was so scared, I didn't know what was going to happen. All I knew was that I could count on Adam and Stephanie. I doubted that I would be able to move into Stephanie's house, I thought that her mom would revoke her permission she gave months before for me to move into her house. When I came to Stephanie's house I told Adam in the truck to take me to a hostel because I had this feeling that I wouldn't be aloud to move into Stephanie's. He said he would never let that happen and that he would take me to his house if that happened. This entry is to be continued because my 'dad' just came home and said ""what are you doing on that computer?"" I said, ""typing my lj"" he said ""who said you could be on this computer"" i said ""mom"" he said ""i told your mom not to let you on this computer"" i said ""well she said i could"" he said ""i don't want you to be on the computer because you don't do anything around the house"" i said ""yes i do only you don't look at what i do do you look at all the things i don't. you treat joshua and me very differently"" he said ""hurry up with the computer and get off because i need to get up early for work. its very important"" i said ""okay"". bye. i'll try to continue in the future."

and put to rest the day

Make introductions to each other years after we've met

and say good bye before we greet

bathe in darkness

hide from the sun

laugh instead of cry

weep instead of laugh

Yell when it's quiet

and whisper when its loud

swim instead of running

fly instead of walking

deny the lie

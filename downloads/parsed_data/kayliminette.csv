I've been at Tracey's house since last tuesday and then all this shit happened with my family and I've just been so confused with everything going on in my life. I don't know what to think about anything anymore.

"event","<font size=""3"" face=""book antiqua"">ya know what? FUCK IT. I'm so damn tired of playing games, of people expecting me to be how im not and then getting mad that I let them down or something. Its lame and I'm sick of it. I'm me, take it or leave it.

And ya know what else? I'm sick of being between my parents fighting. I know they hate eachother, hence the DIVORCE. So why oh why do they feel the need to rip eachother apart to me every fucking day like I want to hear how much they cant stand eachother and that they never loved eachother and it was all a mistake? My mom let it slip that I was never supposed to happen. Thats great. Thanks mom. 

I'm just tired. Tired of games, of lies, of bullshit, or smiling when It hurts too much to breathe. I'm so tired."

"event","<font size=""3"" color=""FFFFFF"" face=""comic sans ms"">I stopped and looked at the world today. People were breathing, talking and walking like usual. 

It was the same rhythmn and the same things I've seen before... just a little bit different... I felt something in my chest that didn't let me breathe for about ten seconds. I didn't know what it was and I'm not sure I know now... but I'm still trying to figure it out. 

The world is a place I do not recognize anymore. Maybe I never did. Maybe that's why I never did anything to make it safer or better, I only sat staring at endless roads thinking I was being deep and profound. For long time I thought that every time I saw the beauty of nature I was being romantic and poetic, but that was just a lie I told myself to justify just sitting and doing nothing. I wonder for how long I'm going to keep lying to myself...and I also wonder for how long we people, as a society, are going to go around talking and walking and breathing, pretending we are the only ones who matter, and thinking only about ourselves. 

And if it only takes one movie like the one I watched. If it only takes one song like the one I listened to. If it only takes one touch, one person, one sound, one day, one instant...then why do I always forget so quickly? How can we be so blind? 

Someone told me once that we do make a difference... if one didn't make any difference, no difference would ever be made, he said. I just don't want to sit around and wait anymore. If it's through a word, a story, a kiss, a look, a vision, a smile, a movie, a melody, a push, a letter, a book, a figure, a ride, a drink, an expression, a note, a name, a try, a touch, a look, a thought, a prayer, a visit, a step, a line, an essence, an idea, a fruit, a flower, a post, a coat, a penny, a dream...

... only the day I can say I've tried it all will I truly reach happiness.

Its amusing how life has a way of sneaking up and smacking you with reality right in the face. I took the time to look around today and what I saw really took my breathe away. By just appreciating the little things about life it made all the problems I view as overwhelming seem trivial. I love how things can change all in an instant with one different perspective. I love being able to laugh at what once threatened to break me, Irony is amusing.

Sorry bout' that I know how much it pissed you off Jaxx and Scotty! But neither one of you update either so shut it. 

<font color=""CC99FF""> Today I played with Tracey and Michelle for a bit and that was oodles of fun. I learned their card game kinda...its confusing yet oh so much fun to watch! I've been playing with Trace a lot more as of late which is good because shes FUN. On Friday I went out to play with Brittany and Sara! We ate at Village Inn where Brit works which was fun stuff, THEN we were <i>supposed</i> to go to a party at Jesse's (PISSY HESSE) house but he was being a butt about it and we got bored and all he was doing was sucking on Brit and being all lame so we left and then kidnapped Joe and went to play.....LASER TAG!!! It was lots of fun though. Then we played basketball @ Brit's but her grandma got all iffy and Brit had to go inside (keep in mind it was only 9pm) so then Sara, Joe, and I went and saw Shrek 2 which was suprisingly good! Then Joe had to go home and I went to Sara's and we ate yummy cake stuff and then I went home but I was only home for lik 10 minutes before Gabe came over and we talked for a long time. THEN SATURDAY IT WAS HORRIBLE OUT AND I HATE NEBRASKA AND TORNADOES AND I ALMOST DIED! But I was at Gabe's after work so I ended up there for a long time until it was safer out and then I came home at like early in the morning and yea. Worked Sunday.... thats about it. Fun stuff.

I went swimming with Nicholas today! It was good fun, but now I feel really gross. I'm all meh feeling. Work was okay for the most part - Me and Dave played in the back a lot again. GOOD TIMES.

Scott got home a few days ago. It made me oh so very happy. I missed him whole bunches and now I feel so much better because hes here.

It sucks to know that you have someone who cares about me and that I could be with right now and I cant. Its horrible feeling. 

BUT ANYWAY.

<font color=""#66FFFF"">I've been working like a bitch lately and getting ready to be done with High School FOREVER. Mixed emotions on that one but at the moment I'm just excited. So lets see, my weekend...

<font size=""5"" color=""#66FF99""><b>Friday</b> <font size=""3"">= I Worked until 10:15 and then on the way home my car broke down because the alternator is messed up so I need a new one of those, thats gonna cost about $400. Nice huh? So I called my dad to come get me and him and our friend Andy came and got me and had it towed. So all this drama was done by about 11-ish so I called Rory and we went to a little party type thing @ his friend Jaye's house, which was okay - I got home at around 2 or 3 am. 

<font size=""5"" color=""#66FFFF""><b>Saturday</b> <font size=""3"">= I had to be at work by 9am and I was done by 5pm, my brother was up here so I hung out with him for a while. My dad's friend Kerry came over with his daugher Taylor who is 3. Her and I had a bunch of fun, I chased her around and then we played ""Tigers"". Haha, little girls are funny as hell. Then around 10pm Gabe and Jaxx came over and we watched 'Scary Movie 3' and some creepy old movie. It was nice. Then we went out and layed in the grass and talked for awhile.

<font size=""5"" color=""#66FF99""><b>Sunday</b> <font size=""3"">= Work at 10am. It was fun too. They were taking pictures of all of us for some reason and I got mine taken laying in the Juvi's room in the bed! It was oodles of fun. Then I helped Erin set up patio furniture outside and THEN I plaed in the back with Joel. I sat on the conveyor belt and rode it up and down stairs. It was fun! AND THEN... we had cart races!! My team won of course. But then I had to actually work. On the way home from work my dad and I got in fight about something stupid in front of my brother, he had to come pick me up because my car wont be fixed until tomorrow :-( Now I'm getting ready to go out with <font size=""6"" color=""#FF99FF""> Mo-Town (Maureen),<font size=""6"" color=""#FF0033""> E-dog (Erin)<font size=""6"" color=""#FFFF00""> D-Roc (Diana) <font size=""3"" color=""#66FF99""> and <font size=""6"" color=""#6699FF"">Laurizzle (Lauren) <font size=""3"" color=""#66FF99""> should be fun. 

<font size=""3"" color=""#66FFFF""> Well I should be off, see ya'll later ok? By the way, I love u Jaxx, now I talked about you, happy? BYE GUYS!"

"event","<font size=""3"" color=""#FFCCFF"" face=""Century Gothic""> So... as you probably read, Julie had her baby yesterday. It was a girl and she named it Zoey. It was 8 lbs 1 oz and it was 20 inches! I talked to Julie today after school and I got to go up and see her and the baby and they're both doing great. It made me so sad seeing her there like that though because Ryan totally walked out on her and the baby. Asshole. I swear guys are horrible. But then again every once in a while you meet a half-way decent one who restores your faith in the opposite gender to an extent.

<font color=""#CCCCFF""> But yea, I talked to Lyssa again today and her and Sean are still all shitty. I guess she had to contact his Master Sergent and forward him the e-mails and play the messages that Sean has been sending her to him and he told Sean that he needs to leave Lyssa alone, and if he contacts her again at all he can be put in the brig AND she can file a civil suit, as well as, get him in touble for stalking. Pretty scary.

<font color=""#FFCCFF""> I FINALLY got a hold of Dustin today, I was really flippin' worried about him. I guess he ran away because him and his dad were fighting again, I really miss him. Its weird - we used to talk all the time, like literally every day. And now we rarely talk. Hes gone so down hill these past few months it breaks my heart. I remember one night when I was upset and my mom's boyfriend hit me then kicked me out of the house I was walking down the street at like 2am and Dustin came and picked me up and we went to his house and he just let me cry on his shoulder then he played his guitar for me and sang to me until I fell asleep. Hes just amazing. I need to keep in touch with him better. 

<font color=""#CCCCFF""> Well, I guess I should be off - I don't have to work tonight so Im prolly gonna go DO something! YAY! I better shower first though, I still have Brandon spit all over me and flour in my hair. Stupid boys. Cya'll later!

"event","<font size=""3"" color=""#CC99FF"" face=""Impact""> It was so damn disgusting outside today, seriously. It was hot and humid and bleh. But then around 8: 45 it started lightening out and raining and then it started to thunder and we had a fun little storm for a bit. It was pleasant - but now its way cooler outside and not all HOT and sick. 

<font color=""#FFFFFF""> I thought I had to work last night so I was all bummed out BUT turns out I didn't have to so I got to play with Tracey, Angela and Michelle! It was oodles of fun. We rented a ""scary"" movie - except it sucked. And we all got gummi candy - and got sick from it. Haha, but it was fun I swear. Before Michelle came over Trace and Ang and I all went to a park by Ang's house and we were playing in the sand and then we had ourselves a little sand fight, only it was more like me and Ang throwing sand at Tracey and then running away. . . but still! I had sand all down my shirt too it was scratchy. FUN STUFF.

<font color=""#CC99FF""> But anywho. . . I got an e-mail from Dustin's mom today asking me if I knew where he was, it was weird because I haven't talked to him in a few months and she seemed really worried so now naturally <font size=""6""> I'M </font> worried. *sigh* So much drama I swear. 

<font color=""#FFFFFF""> Someone is supposed to call me tonight, but I'm not holding my breath on that one. He's kinda flaky. Its weird because I let myself get all attached to this ONE person who I can't even say why I'm attached to him now. I mean hes an awesome person and a really funny, sweet guy. But I hate how he makes me feel like I dont really matter much, only when he wants some. I hate that I let myself be all. . . manipulated, no thats not the right word. . . I hate that I let someone make me feel so shitty that I would do something with them that I dont even really want to do. DAMNIT. Oh well. I'm done. I wish I could just quit on guys ya know? I wish that I could just wake up one day and have it all be crystal clear and turn around and have some amazing guy right in front of me and just KNOW that he's the perfect one and thats it. 

<font color=""#CC99FF""> My friend Jaramy sent me an e-mail because he said I seemed reall down about my love life lately and just in general and this is what he said to me :

""After a while you learn the difference between
Holding a hand and falling in love
You begin to learn that
Kisses don't always mean something
Promises can be broken
Just as quickly as they were made
And sometimes
Goodbyes really are forever

True love lasts through good times and bad""

So true right? I thought so too. I have awesome friends.

"event","<font size=""3"" color=""#FFFFFF"" face=""impact""> Today was hard. I didn't want to tell anyone here about losing Matt so I had to pretend that I was okay. It was one of the hardest things that I've ever had to do. Everything reminded me of him, or things we'd done together. It was the worst when Addie was talking about sky diving. . . Matt and I were supposed to go last January but I moved and we never got a chance to go. I swear this is killing me inside, I haven't told anyone about losing him except whoever reads this and I really don't care if they know. Its better that they read it here than me explaining it because I would break down.

<font size=""3"" color=""#FF33CC"" face=""impact""> I'm so angry, last night I sat down and talked to God for the first time in a long time. I opened my Bible and He showed me this verse that just broke my heart and I finally let down my walls and just screamed at Him, I told Him everything I'd been feeling inside and just gave it all over to Him and by the time I feel asleep I had this inner peace. 

<font size=""3"" color=""#CC99FF"" face=""arial""><b>How long, O Lord? 
Will you forget me forever? 
How long will You hide Your face from me? 
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, 
Having sorrow in my heart daily?
How long will my enemy be exaulted over me?
* Psalms 13 *</b></font>

<font size=""3"" color=""#FFFFFF"">But when I woke up this morning and remembered Matt I just layed there and cried, it was so hard to go to school and put on this smile while I was screaming and crying inside. I hate the way I feel. Its so hard."

"event","<font size=""3"" color=""#6633FF"" face=""impact""> You know. . . its sucks so much i hate it. I feel like everytime I get attached to someone i lose them in some form or another. Whether I move or they do, or we just grow apart or if they die. God I've lost so many friends and people I love to death. First Ryan, then Corey and now. . . Matt. God what the hell am I supposed to do! I loved them all so much and now what? Now they're gone. Ryan and Corey chose the paths that led them eventually to their deaths but not Matt. He was meant for so much more than this. He could have been anything he wanted, he was talented and smart and funny. He always made me smile when it hurt to, made me laugh when all I wanted to do was cry. DAMNIT. I'm so angry with God for taking him away from me. I don't understand why. . . It hurt losing Ryan and I thought I would never ever be okay again and then I moved here and met a bunch of new people and I met Corey, and through him the hurt I kept inside slowly faded. . .until I lost him too. And now Matt. I'm never going to open myself up to anyone again - not like I did with them. I can't do this anymore, say goodbye. Its too hard. I love you Matt forever - I know I'll see you again someday, but what does that do for me now? Nothing. Now I'm left alone without you to help me, alone without you to make me smile. Damnit God what do you want me to do! Why do you keep taking the people I love away? I feel so empty and lost. . . I dont think I'll ever be ok.

<font size=""3"" color=""#00CC33"" face=""impact"">*I don't think I ever told you
But I know you always did your best
And the hard times, they only made us stronger
As I sit here all alone I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on 
When You're gone....

I'll never be the same without you

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
I say this prayer for you tonight
Because nothing is impossible.


<font size=""3"" color=""#FFFFFF"" face=""impact"">R.I.P Ryan, Corey, and Matt. . . 3 lives intwined briefly with mine, their deaths will echo through my heart forever."

Not much has been happening here, umm I have a paper due on Friday that I haven't really started and don't really WANT to start so I'm trying to get motivated to do that... umm I have to have 4 more hours of community service to do before the 7th, which is what? Friday? Damnit I hate civics! 

<font size=""3"" color=""#FF9999"" face=""Arial"">So I went shopping again today, I realized that I shop a lot but so what! I earn the money I should be able to spend it how I want right? Plus as long as I look cute its A-ok.

<font size=""3"" color=""#FFFFFF"" face=""arial"">I saw a guy that I haven't seen since I was out here for 7th grade at Papillion Jr. High. It was so weird, I was walking through the mall and someone called my name but ya know how you call someone when youre not really sure its them? All quiet and kinda weird? Yea well he did that and I turn around and theres Gabriel! I was like ah! Its weird how I recognized him right away though, he looks really different. So we hung out for a bit and he helped me pick out clothes and I helped him with some shoes and we decided to hang out on Friday so yay!

My sister sent me this e-mail so I'm gonna share it with you:
<font size=""3"" color=""#99FF00"" face=""arial"">WORDS WOMEN USE 
****************************** 
FINE 
This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up. 

FIVE MINUTES 
If she is getting dressed, this is half an hour. Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given 5 more minutes to watch the game beforehelping around the house. 

NOTHING 
This is the calm before the storm. This means ""something,"" and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with 'Nothing'usually end in ""Fine"" 

GO AHEAD 
This is a dare, not permission. Don't do it. 

LOUD SIGH 
This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement oftenmisunderstood by men. A ""Loud Sigh"" means she thinks you are an idiot andwonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over ""Nothing"" 

THAT'S OKAY 
This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. ""That's Okay"" means that she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake. 

THANKS 
A woman is thanking you. Do not question it or faint. Just say you're welcome.</font> 

<font size=""3"" color=""#000000"" face=""arial"">Funny stuff huh? I thought so too....Well I'm off to start my paper....*gasp* Can't wait to be done! 18 more days and BAM its all over, I'm happy - but sad....*tear* Cya!</font>

Just went to work, I switced hours with Carrie cuz' of her friend's bachelorette party, then when I got off of work I went up to Missy's and we just chilled for a bit but then Andy came over and man I <b> strongly </b> dislike that kid - so I left after he was there a bit. My dad is out of town with my brother up at out friend Sleepy Dean's house in Wisner an' my step-mom was working until like 11:30ish so my new friend Jakob came over and we hung out and he amused me so I wasn't too bored. And then I took a shower because Sarah B. made me promise to wear my hair curly tomorrow :-/ so I had to de-straighten it. And thats about it.

"event","Its so beautiful outside! Its cold and rainy and overcast, I absolutely love this weather. I'm watching Vh1's the fabulous life of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. They're so beautiful! Damn I would do either one of them in a heart beat. Anyway. . . I went shopping today and got some really cute shirts! Yay! Plus I got some cute shoes too. I'm a sucker for sandals. Oh well, so I was so homesick today at school and this stupid bitch(I'm not gonna name any names...) wouldnt leave me alone! GOD I WANTED TO BITCH SLAP HER! She was like ""Kayli whats wrong, whats wrong whats wrong"" incessiently blathering at me it was incredibly annoying. Then when I left the room to get away from her she FOLLOWED me out so we could talk about why I was annoyed with her. You have no idea how much self control it took to walk away and not just smack her. But anyway. I'm more calm now, listening to Jack Johnson always seems to mellow me out. He has the most awesome voice and the best lyrics, like this song called Posters.

""Posters""

Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else 
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like him at all 

So he ties it up, he tucks it in, he pulls it back, and gives a grin 
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all 

He gets his courage from the can, 
It makes him feel like a man 
Because he's loving all the ladies 
But the ladies don't love him at all 

Cause when he's not drunk 
He's only stuck on himself 
And then he has the nerve 
To say he needs a decent girl 

Looking at herself but wishing she was someone else 
Because the body of the doll it don't look like hers at all 

So she straps it on, she sucks it in, she throws it up, and gives a grin 
Laughing at herself because she knows she ain't that at all 

All caught up in the trends 
Well the truth began to bend 
And the next thing you know man 
There just ain't no truth left at all 

Cause when the pretty girl walks 
She walks so proud 
And when the pretty girl laughs 
Oh man, she laughs so loud 

And if it ain't this then its that 
As a matter of fact 
She hasn't had a day to relax 
Since she has lost her ability to think clearly 

Well I'm an energetic hypothetic version of another person 
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in here 

Well I'm a superficial, systematic, music television addict 
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in 

Here comes another one, just like the other one 
Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else 
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like a him 
And so he ties it up he tucks it in, he pulls it back and gives a grin 
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all 
He knows he ain't loved at all 


Isn't that awesome, so true too. *sigh* So I managed to successful piss of a group of people last night. Its funny even when I'm not trying to be a bitch I seem to make people want to rip their hair out. Oh well whatever. I had an awesome talk with my favorite cousin Johnny!! Hes so great,I miss him a lot. I really wish he didn't live in Colorado. He was supposed to come up here and paint a whole bunch of stuff @ our house or something but then his mom, my aunt Margie, had to have surgery on her back so he stayed there to take care of her. Isn't that sweet? I think so. I think hes 21 or 22 and I haven't seen him in so long! *tear* 

But besides that not too much is new, I don't have to work again tonight! YAY! Well Imma go lay down for a bit, lack of sleep has been weighing on me a lot lately. Catch ya later?"

"event","Holy crap I'm so sick of dealing with stupid ignorant people. And yes there is a difference between stupididty and ignorance. It such bullshit I swear.

Fuck. I just want to scream right now. I have such mixed emotions at the moment. I'm almost done with high school and I'm so glad to be done with the drama aspect of it, but at the same time I'm really really sad. I wish that I could be back at Paloma, graduating with my friends and the people that I love. But I'm not. Looking back at how much I've had to give up and how many people that I've said goodbye to because of decisions my mom has made. I'm so angry with her and with myself for holding such a grudge against her. I would give ANYTHING to be back in California, in Menifee, sitting out at the table in front of Angela's house laughing about nothing and watching the guys messing around. I took that for granted for so long and now I know that it will never ever be like that again and thats another part of my life that was taken away from me before it should have been. I sound like such a whiny bitch too but for once I want to care about how I feel, not how everyone else feels. I'm sick of sacraficing just because its easier for everyone else that way. I guess I'm basically disheartened right now. I feel like I shouldnt get attached to anyone ever again because I'll always have to say goodbye to them right when I start to love and care about them. 

Thats enough of my sadness for the moment I guess. Sorry but I just needed to vent.

Oh well I got yelled at by Jaxx and Sam for not writing in it so I figured what the hell. Only about a month and a half before I'm done with high school forever and on to bigger better things. I'm not sure what I want to do ""when I grow up"" but at the moment I think I want to be a coroner. I know what ya'll are gonna say, ""Eww gross, you mean cut up dead bodies?"" Well to those who think that all I have to say is fuck off. Being a coroner is more that ""cutting up dead bodies"", its a science - figuring out how people die and seeing how all the bodies function and stuff so THATS why I want to be a coroner, not out of some sick fascination with death or anything morbid like that. I guess my sister's fiance went all psycho on her and threw a big glass something or other at her and told her he was going to ""put her in her place"", that just goes to show that even nice marines can be psycho assholes too. I spent Easter with my mom and my Grandma and sister and I hated every minute of it. So boring good god. I'm tired of being the go-between with my parents, its driving me crazy. I love them both but apparantly I'm not allowed to love them equally. Whatever. I left my job at Walgreens because the manager was a huge bitch and I got sick of her bullshit. I had an interview with Linens n' Things yesterday and Kohls today and I have 2nd interviews with both so hopefully one of them works. I've really been missing California lately, I think its because I feel like I'm losing it. I mean it was so much a part of me for so long and now its gone and I don't want to lose it. I'll get back there someday. I've been hearing a lot about a bunch of the people I used to go to Cornerstone with, and they've all changed so much I guess. People grow up I guess, but I'd still prefer to remember them how they were and not how I hear they are now. Well this has been long enough so Jaxx and Sam can shove it. Love ya'll *wink*"

"event","Yea only 5 more days until I'm out of here and back in California! I'm so damn excited... But all I have to say is my dad better let me go. He's actually not being too much of an ass lately so we'll see how it goes right? Anyway!

I haven't really written much in this lately, I was up at my moms thursday nite until last nite so I figured I'd just catch up on it all now. Yea so I didn't have school Friday so on Thursday nite I went up to Pender Nebraska, this small ass town that is seriously like this big |---|. Everyone knows everyone and their parents knew eachother and their grandparents all knew eachother and etc... So yeah I was dropped on this atmosphere and I about went crazy. I guess we lived there when I was like 5 or 6 (I hardly recall this but ok)and I had all these people being like, ""Hey Kayli! Remember me?!"" And all I could do was smile and nod because I had no idea who the hell they were. Yeah so my little sister wanted me to go to her school and she could show me around and stuff so I went and it was a K-12 school so she was showing me around and there were all these High School kids talking to her and stuff and shes in like 5th grade so it was weird. Then I got hit on by like 4 guys who all looked like preppy farmers. It was quite an experience. 

But then when I got home last nite my dad started in yelling at me again for some random thing. I guess it was nice to get away from him and my step-mom and just NOT be yelled at for every thing I do. Me and my mom talked a lot and we ""bonded"" I suppose you could say. 

My older sister, the marine, may be coming to see me in April!! I'm all excited! And she may be bringing her fiance who just got back from a tour in Iraq(hes a marine too)! So I'm happy. Well I have to work tonite so I should go but I'll flip ya on the catch side k?! Oh and I got to talk to Scott last nite!:-D so it was a good nite. Later ya'll!"

Well she keeps telling me that she isn't going to let me go if i dont ""quit the attitude"", ok first of all....like she has ANY say in what I do? Secondly I hate her so why would I be nice to her? And I wasn't even DOING anything to her! I mean I've been so good and quiet lately just so I can go but she keeps telling my dad all this bullshit about me being rude to her and stuff and ofcourse he believes her, not like he was my dad before she was his wife or anything. I hate the both. And if they dont let me go.....Fuck that I would make it hell for them here."

"event","Today was a long day. I actually got to sleep in relatively late, but then again I didn't get to go to bed until like 3 something in the morning due to a bunch of drunk people in my basement once more. But anyway, I slept in until almost 12:30 and then I got up and called Lindsay back (she had called twice) so she came and picked me up like 15 minutes later and we went to Plato's closet so she could sell some jeans there and look for some more. I bought 2 really cute shirts there, then we went to Target to look for some sunglass frames for her to get perscription lenses in but they didnt have any cute ones so we went to Khols because I needed a black over shirt and she wanted a skirt. Well neither one of us found what we wanted so we went to Supertarget to look there for sunglasses but the optical center had JUST closed (scurvy bitches) so we looked around and I got two new CDs. I swear I'm addicted to CDs. But they were good deals, I got Start Something by lostprophets and an acoustic mix of ""punk"" songs I guess you could say but its really awesome and they were both only $9.99 so hell. Well then we went back to Khols (twice more) to look for stuff and I ended up with a TON of shirts and she got some really cute stuff too.

But I didn't mention the best part yet.... it rained! Hardcore style too. I was very very happy. I love the rain, and the fact that it was warm enough to rain and not snow made it all the more great. Its supposed to snow again tomorrow though damnit all. 

But yea - I suppose I should go now and try to fix my hair, its a mess from the rain - all curly again :-( so I'll whip it into shape. Love you guys. 

P.S. - heres an awesome song for ya'll, I figure I'm listening to it you can too! We'll share a moment... *tear*

*Sway*
When the sun comes down
When the rain wash away
All the hopes I can bring
Into another day
Another day

When your trees start to sway
And the wind makes them move

I can tell that
You don't know

[Chorus]
To all the fights I've conquered and beyond...
The times have changed and I will now move over slowly...
The truth is I still feel lost without you
Hard to find a new soul
The silence takes its toll

You sway
When you are lost...
You sway
When you don't know...
You sway
When all you want is to find home...

Theres a light pausing
Feel the volume of the sky
Mark your place in time with another question why...

Time flickers in the night
Always lookin to be right

[chorus]

You sway
When you are lost...
You sway
When you don't know...
You sway
When all you want is to find home...
You sway
When you are lost...
You sway
When you don't know...
You sway
When all you want is to find home...

Home...(repeated)

You sway
You sway
You sway

"event","Anger Swells inside me and I feel consumed by hatred. I hate your face- contorted with rage, I hate your voice screaming my faults, I hate your words cutting into my heart, I hate that you make me hate you, I hate that I can't find who I was before you broke me, I hate the way you make me feel like I don't matter, I hate that she let you break me down again and again, I hate the tears that fall at night, I hate the pain overwhelming me, I hate your lies and your apologies, I hate the person you've made me become, I hate the visions of running away, I hate the sound of my little sister's tears, I hate that you make me wish to die, I hate that you're still around, I hate that you made me lose everything and everyone that made me happy, I hate everything about you. I can't fine my way back to who I was before you broke my spirit. Will I ever be ok? When will I forget the words you've said or stop dreaming of your face. When will the pain in my heart fade and the tears stop? Why can't she see how much he hurt me. Why doesnt she care? I hate them both.

I used to think that I had everything all figured out. Now I know that only two things in life are certain: I'll lose anyone I ever care about, and I don't know anything anymore. I can't even count the number of people I've had to turn my back on anyone I love and care about. They say that change is inevitable, well I say change can kiss my ass. I hate that I've lost who I was. I love so many people out there in california - they're some of the most amazing people I know. I could be 287% myself with them and they loved me for who I was. They were my family. Now they are gone. I should have seen it coming. I was too happy, I found people who loved me and I loved them - so ofcourse I would have to leave them. 

I feel like my heart is breaking. The only time I feel happy anymore is when I'm talking to my friends from California. I'm at the point in my life when everyone is supposed to be saying goodbye and going out into adulthood and college and knowing exactly what path their life is taking, but I feel like I'm fighting SO hard to keep the people I have in my life that I love. I have no idea what I'm going to do in the future. No idea. I used to have all these dreams and goals and ambitions, and now I just feel lost.

Someday things may clear up. I'm just tired of looking for ""someday""."

I decided that I'm mad at God for giving me curly hair, he can take it back and give me some nice straight hair please. Curly hair sucks hardcore, well sometimes it looks really cute and I like it but at the moment I'm tired of dealing with it. 

I want it to be the 11th so bad! Then I'll be in California with Ang and everything will be so much better and I'll be happy again. I wont think about how much its going to suck having to leave them all again. I wont! Maybe I just wont come back. I doubt anyone would even notice. Hell, I don't care if they notice!

I should get ready to go to work but I really don't want to. Hmmm... Oh well...

But I'll just say that I've come so close to just saying screw it and walking away...walking away from it all. Wouldn't that be fun for my dad and his bitch wife (my step-mom), they wake up and I'd be gone. I wonder if they would even notice. Hell I wonder if they would care.

ANYWAY. Thats enough of Kayli's bitching for the moment. I talked to my sister today - her fiance is getting back in town from overseas next week and shes all excited, I'm really happy for her. She seems really happy. I'm glad she deserves the best.

So my ex boyfriend called me randomly last night from the hospital of all places... yea so he called me and wanted to ""talk"" about the past and the future he wanted us to share or something. It was weird. I didn't know how to feel. On one hand I cared about him so much at one point in time that on some level I wished it could be that way again, but on the other hand he broke my heart over and over and I could never feel that way about him again. 

Plus someone else already has my heart.

So Aaron e-mailed me today from Hawaii, I haven't talked to him since they all left here and moved there. Hes doing good and I'm soooo glad! He's 21 now! I was like damn has it been THAT long since we talked?! But anyway...

I'm gonna go now hope ya'll enjoyed my ramblings tonight *wink*

I went to Goodwill again tonight and It was actually pretty fun. I like it there - the people are a lot of fun and the clothes crack me up. 

School today was kinda iffy. I mean nothing ""bad"" happened it just felt weird. Like people were pissing me off because they kept pulling on me and bugging me and I just wanted to smack them all! UGH! Plus the night before kind of sucked and I ended up crying myself to sleep and then I couldn't stop thinking about it today at school and I about made myself cry during 2nd period but I couldn't because people were being all stupid. Oh well.But then I got to talk to mi amor so that made it all ok. 

I want to crawl into bed and sleep for hours and hours and hours and never wake up. I love my bed.

Spring Break is gonna be so damn fun! We have so many  memories and plans and everything. I'm all happy, I can't wait to see her and the guys. 

It rained last night! I heard it and ran outside and stood in it. Rain is so cleansing, it has such an ability to wash away all your impurities and make you feel so....right. 

Ah so I'm all tired right now! I've hardly slept in days and days, my body is all thrown off. I need to sleep for a few days and just get all caught up.

Tonight like 8 people told me I smelled good and this one old lady was like, ""I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound rude - but you are absolutelty beautiful."" I was like wow, thanks!

Life is filled with some of the most beautiful and amazing moments - precious events that mold who you are and what you become. People you meet and love, and maybe even leave, who sculpt your future. Close your eyes and picture life without them. Life without hardship, without tears. 

I used to think that I would never escape the deep sadness within my heart. The tears I silently cry at night. But looking back now I think differently. For every bad memory - every moment of pain that I have felt I can name 2 or 3 good ones. Without the bad you wouldnt have the good. With out pain would you know happiness? Without tears would you appreciate smiles?

I used to wish everynight that I could change this aspect of my life or go back and erase what had happened at any given moment. But now I realize that I wouldn't change anything. I wouldn't take back the pain, the harsh words, the tears or even the emotional damage. My life has been turned upside down over and over and I am grateful for it. Grateful for the bastards who broke me mind, body, and soul. Grateful for it all. Because without them I wouldn't be me. And me is exactly who I want to be. 

Wow I wasn't intending to be so deep and emotional in this, I guess I was feeling. . . inspired. Anyway thats enough of my incessant ramblings.

Jeff called me tonight out of nowhere - I wish he would just leave me alone and let it go. He wants there to be something between us still and there isnt anymore and he can't understand WHY I don't love him now. I mean sure he cheated and lied and broke my heart, but he said sorry so its all ok now right?

I talked someone I haven't talked to in a long time earlier. We used to be so close and now we hardly even talk. It breaks my heart how people can grow apart so easily. And deep inside I know that its my own fault.

~Void~

void,canceled, simply annulled.
Endlessly aching, unconsoled.
Life without you, cause without reason.
Touch without sense, time without season.
A shallow face, anguished and marred.
An empty space, scaled and scarred.
Sweetly abiding to a cynical charade.
Secretly hiding behind a fictitious facade.
Still, lost within this this heart of glass.
This fragile and yet unfeeling mass.
Lies the remains of a love that once glowed.
The gift to you I once bestowed.
But honor and pride now bereaved -
By your love for me so misconcieved.
Ripped from my inner depths, impeding - 
Mind, body, and spirit bleeding;
Nows crushed to sand from your ruthless hand.
A cold stare I just can't understand.
I feel that somehow, somehow I'm dying.
At least my soul and all thats underlying.
A simple void, is that what I've become?
The hollowed sphere on a pendulum.
Swinging back and forth, emotion to emotion.
Never once stopping, nor slowing the motion.
No reason, no answer, no justification.
The creation of a sterile imagination.
Just passing through time as time passes me.
Merely a nothing -nothing merely left to be.
Sightless and soundless, unseen and unheard.
Mindless and boundless, obscure and absurd.
All empathy living ungraced, unemployed.
I live my life dying, unembraced, a void.

Thats how I feel...its odd how a good day can get so much worse after one conversation.

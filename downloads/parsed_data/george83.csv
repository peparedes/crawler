Ok hello peeps, I've had a pretty good few days :),except for the fact that everyone around me seems to be in love or in relationships except for me.  Never being in love is very hard, Im 21 and never been kissed lol and that is very very irritating all I want to do is to have someone special in my life.. 

someone I can cuddle, 
someone I can look in the eyes and tell them theyre beautiful,
someone I can spoil rotten

I have all this love to give and noone to take it :S.  I've got to get out more and break this protective shy case im in, but to make friends you've got to go out and to go out you need friends so im in a sticky jam here lol :S."

"event","hi everyone, im dieing with the cold here at last check i had a 102 temperture lol.  But thats not the thing thats bothering me at the mo.  Im just so confused Lauren who has always been so sweet and kind to me before has all of a sudden turned against me :S, and i dont know why.  This always happens when i try to meet new people they always turn agaisnt me i guess im just not a good person.

But I'd really like an answer y?? is it cause im shy, my stutter or just the fact that im just a retard plain and simple.  Oh well Im never going to find out, it was nice knowing her though.  I just hope that 1 day she will have the heart to talk to me again :'("

"event","Hello all u peeps out there :)

yes im in a cheerful mood today, dont know why i just am :)

I went to the pictures tonight and seen The Grudge, though I was disapointed in it not been as scary as I heard it was an enjoyable movie :).  Also I met Lauren and her cousin Grace there.  Even though I was shy I enjoyed their company and I dont think i did that bad to be honest, I've done far worse when meeting new people lol :).  Hopefully I can meet up with her again soon and I shouldnt be as nervous next time :).

Also congrats to Man Utd today after a good 3-1 win over Newcastle :) its about time we started scoring again lol :P

so back to the old grindstone tomorrow, oh well not long till im off for 4 weeks i spose :D"

It puzzles me how that prick of a drummer from Sum 41 could end up with a nice girl like Avril Lavigne lol :P she promised to marry me it :P.  Ok it was a dream but boy it was a good dream :P.

Anyway sitting here last night bored out of my mind, I scribled down another of my crappy poems, it crap I know but it lets me get my frustion out :P

I call it disposable bullshit :P

enjoy ;)

you cant just toss me away,
I wont go far anyway,
you see my love for you is true,
even when youre face is blue

This may seem obscene
I just wanted to hug you close,
didnt mean to cause a scene,
my heart is in tatters,
but now youre gone it dosent really matter,
I'm going to eat til I cant get any fatter,

you cant just toss me away,
I wont go far anyway,
you see my love for you is true,
even when youre sniffing glue

Im not disposable,

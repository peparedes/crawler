"event","Wow..here's what i did on saturday:

studied for geometry

wrote my speech thing for church

contemplated natalie's plan to sit in her locker...thought about joining her...decided i would

got online for 15 minutes and got discouraged about the geometry final

contemplated my ugly face

contemplated how someone was practically my best friend last year and this year really doesn't like me

contemplated how some people i judged last year are my friends this year

overall...contemplated and studied

I feel happy now....blubberbutt500 added me to their friends list..gives me joy..have to figure out who that is

This song by relient k reminds me of gnatalie:

so it was jeremy in 1983
in his ocean pacific t
who got a bloody knee
on his skateboard
in the half pipe
in the backyard
that tuesday night
and i'm only gonna pierce my left ear
and i've been working on this mustache all summer long
and my favorite band will always be tears for fears
and i'm gonna wear a pink tux to the prom
cutting class through the first floor window
he's driving fast cause he never did a thing slow
and i look up to my big bro
cause in the 80's all the ladies grabbed his hand and couldn't let go
and i'm only gonna pierce my left ear
and i've been working on this mustache all summer long
and my favorite band will always be tears for fears
and i'm gonna wear a pink tux to the prom (a pink tux to the prom)
doo doo, a doo doo doo
pink tux to the prom
doo doo, a doo doo doo
pink tux to the prom
i am gonna wear a pink tux to the prom
live without a care...what could possibly go wrong?
when you're president of the breakfast club
and you're not hesitant to fall in love (to fall in love)
to throw it away to fall in love with the 80's
i am gonna wear a pink tux to the prom
live without a care...what could possibly go wrong?
i am gonna wear a pink tux to the prom
live without a care...
cause you threw it away to fall in love with the 80's
doo doo, a doo doo
doo doo, a doo doo
doo doo, a doo doo

Love Melissa"

"event","Maybe when the room is empty,
maybe when the bottle's full,
maybe when the door gets broke down love can break in.
Maybe when I'm done with thinking
maybe you can think me whole
maybe when I'm done with endings this can begin.
This can begin
This can begin
If you could be my punk rock princess,
I would be your garage band king.
You could tell my why you just don't fit in, and how your gonna be somethin'
Maybe when your hair gets darker
maybe when your eyes get wide
maybe when the walls are smaller there will be more space.
Maybe when I'm not so tired
maybe you can step inside
maybe when I look for things that I can't replace
I can't replace
I can't replace
If you could be my punk rock princess
I would be your garage band king
You could tell my why you just don't fit in, and how your gonna be something
If I could be your first real heartache I would do it over again.
If you could be my punk rock princess you could be my heroin.
I never thought you'd last
I never dreamed you would.
You watch your life go past
you wonder if you should ...
If you should be my punk rock princess so I would be your garage band king
you could tell my why you just don't fit in, and how your gonna be something.
If I could be your first real heartache, I would do it over again.
If you could be my punk rock princess I would be your heroin.


Whoa Ohhhh, you know, you only burn my bridges
Whoa Ohhhh, you know, you just can't let it sink it.
You could be my heroin
You could be my heroin

"event","Yay!! I'm so excited about my new jornal.  Well..here are some cool lyrics by Yellowcard:
There's a place off Ocean Avenue
Where I used to sit and talk with you
We were both 16 and it felt so right
Sleeping all day, staying up all night
Staying up all night

There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street 
We would walk on the beach in our bare feet
We were both 18 and it felt so right
Sleeping all day, staying up all night
Staying up all night

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

There's a piece of you that's here with me
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see
When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by
I can make believe that you're here tonight
That you're here tonight

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

I remember the look in your eyes
When I told you that this was goodbye
You were begging me not tonight
Not here, not now
We're looking up at the same night sky
And keep pretending the sun will not rise 
Be together for one more night
Somewhere, somehow

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

That is probably the best song in the world.  Wow..last night was really scary.  The house i was spending the night in got struck by lightning.  I was just like sitting there getting ready to watch a movie and then it was like BANG!!  Everyone screamed really loud and we went and hid in the hall thing.  Scary but exciting.  Well..i saw thirteen going on thirty today. It was positively frothy.

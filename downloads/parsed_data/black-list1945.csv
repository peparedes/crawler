"event","whats up kids. well BLACK LIST hasnt been practicing as much as we should be. Here are my thoughts - Substance abuse can ruin bands. its ok to smoke some pot or drink some beer, but when white drugs get involved things start to get sketchy. im doing my best to keep that shit away from BLACK LIST but people are gonna do what people are gonna do.

anyway this past week has been cool. i got in a fight the other night but didnt realize it until the next morning when i woke up and my knuckles were all raw and bloody. i stubbed my toe on my way to the computer this morning and to tell you the truth im not too happy about it. people need to start commenting on this thing. last night we went to the galaxy to see loogie, the stiches, the avengers, and the crowd. we got in for free and got to hang out backstage which is highly overrated just like X-tina."

"event","Its been a while since the BLACK LIST livejournal has been updated. Due to Alex's inability to not be a flaky bitch, the BLACK LIST E.P. is being recorded tomorrow. (Sorry those of you who have been waiting for a long time. tomorrow it will be here)BLACK LIST would like to thank Tubby Hippo Records for the studio time.

Well yesterday we went to the Galaxy to see D.R.I. and The Scabs. We got there a little early to hang out and drink some beers before the show. Then this fat fucking slob rent a cop kicked us out cause we're not allowed to drink there or something. So we drove to another parking lot and drank the beers then we snuck back in. After the Scabs set was over we had about 15 minutes of time to kill so we thought we might as well smoke a joint outside. Right as the joint was being finished another security dude kicked us out for smoking. This time we did not get back in. This made BLACK LIST very angry so we went around the back and started a fire. (nothing too big just enough to get the point across)"

"event","I watched ""Hurt"" by Johnny Cash tonight.  I had wanted to delete it, but I couldn't.  I don't think I've ever been hit as hard by a single song, or video.  I always dread thinking that was how my father felt when he was getting old, and dying.  That everything around you goes away, and that you will still be standing in the same place.  It scares me.  It scares me that I will one day think that way, that everything will just come up around me, and I will be left behind.  I honestly cannot wait to be old.  To tell my stories, and share the times of my life with my grandkids...  But I fear being shunned, and put away.  I remember what happened to my grampa art.  And for what my aunt and uncle did to him, I will never forgive them.  At 96, against his will, they threw him in a home.  They forgot about him, and left him to die in someone else's care.  He died 2 weeks later.  I hope my kids will care enough about me to take care of me when I need love around me the most.

oh well, I'm definitely getting ahead of myself.

I write this knowing you won't see it.
Disinterested, sick, I don't know which.
But I hope you'll one day know how I feel... how I have always felt.
It doesn't matter if you think I lie.
I know I don't.
You're lovely.
You're that I always dreamed of.
Through a crowded room, your light shines through the darkened faces.
Your smile, no matter what you say, warms my hear on even the coldest of days.
Look what you have done to me.
A girl, known for being carefree, is now so miserable, and reduced to nearly nothing.
She's alone, left in the dark, left to dream of the days before.
The days when she was happy.

""When I cry, they tell me that these are supposed to be the best years of my life.  Why would they lie to a girl whose down on her luck?  I remember when the best day of my life was yesterday, and the sun was always shining in my mind's eye.  Those days have long since left their mark, their snapshots, and their memories.  In truth, the days long since passed blanketed my eyes to what could happen, so when it did happen, I was left awe-struck and pining for the past.  So what happens to the days past?  The days I will remember for the rest of my life?  They are in the breat pocket of my father's hospital gown.  They sleep in his ashes.  My memories of good live in him.  But he is tirelessly taunting me with my subconcious, making sure he won't be forgotten.  Well, believe me, that;s one reality I will never realize.  After leaving all I have ever known, I find myself opening doors expecting to find him on the other side, arms wide with a smile ear to ear; I look at pictures strewn across the house and relive the day, the second it happened, then I always flash to my brother saying his final goodbye to him.  He told him it was okay to leave.  What lies!  He told him we could take care of things and he'd be good for him.  Bullshit.  What bullshit to say to your dying father.  Well, dad, you shouldn't have believed him cuz he just fucked us over.

And good try, mom.  ""You need a father-figure.""  Yes, to go along with the ""best years of my life.""  My uncle will never be a father figure to me.  I love him unconditionally, but I have to face the fact that I'm going to have a void in my life too big to cover with an uncle.
<i><b>Bottom Line:</b> I miss my father like a hobo misses clean underwear.  God, bring this hobo's undies back to her.</i>""

(Old journal entry.  Crazy, yes.  I remember writing this.  I was sitting on my bed, laying my head on the wall.  I was crying, of course, and I kept getting uncontrollably angry.  My teeth were gritting and my fists were clenching.  I thought I was going to punch through a wall.  Mostly all over the part about my brother.  Yeah.)"

""Creative outlet
My only friend
You'll never betray me
You can always mend
My aches and my pains
Fill that gray space inside
Yet you always give me a place
I feel safe in to hide
O, my creative outlet
What would I do without you?
I sometimes fear I'd be normal
And lose my twisted view askew.

I hold the gun
My worries have lifted
As I watch the rising sun

You're shaking beneath me
Under the weight of my thumb
Frightened, trying to see
Praying to God to be numb

The sun hides away
shielding from my power
Beneath a cloud it lays
Too ashamed to cower

The cloud blocks the light
The only source of my brawn
The dark sweep blinds my sight
And interrupts the creeping dawn

You soar high above me
The blackness on your side
Your power overtakes me
and rises like the tides

My control has been lifted
You hold the gun
My worries have shifted
As I watch the dying sun

I'm shaking beneath you
Under the weight of your thumb
I shudder at what is to ensue
I pray to God to be numb

I'm a burden.
Thorn in everyone's side.
Why don't I take my own advice?
Why don't I listen to myself for a change?
What if I made a point?
What if I knew what I was talking about?
<i>What if?
What if?
What if?</i>
That is all that surrounds me now.
What if I was who I once was?
What if I was lovely?
What if I had said no?
What if I had done what I knew was right?
What if I had stayed instead of left you there?
What if you had loved me?
What if I ended it all with one blow?
What would happen then?
What if you missed me when I'm gone?
------------------------------------>

Impossible to tell
the sickening truth
from the blissful
blanket of lies.
But who needs truth
when the lies are
so inviting?
If I could live in a world
full of your lies,
I would be perfect;
I would be your queen;
I would be surrounded by the beauty 
of my dreams;
I would feel loved;
I would be happy.
But the lies,
no matter how comforting,
are nothing more than a
storybook.
The fiction you wrote
for me to live by.
To walk my days with
white satin-cloaked eyes,
candy coated to a
bittersweet serenity.
But what am I to do 
when the book closes and
you're through with 
this child's play?
Am I to end like
my fairytale?
--------------->

Sleep once more.
The day was more than
cruel to you.
Its what you deserve.
A sweet release from the everyday.
A calm hiding within
the writhing pit of
the storms.
Dream away, my love.
Here I will lie.
Forever by your side.
Never to headline in
the marquee of your
dreamworld.
Sleep sweet, my love,
its the only way you know
to drown me out.

"event","She was caught.
It had taken them years to track her.
She knew how to cover herself;
She knew what she was doing.
She slipped up once,
and that was enough.
They took her in,
ball and chain.
Threw her down
and clipped her wings.
She jumped and screamed
And battled and shook.
But they had all left her.
They left her tied down,
without chance of escape.
they sealed the cages
and they hid her away.
So there she sits
thoughtless and numb
dreaming of the days before
when she could fly like the rest
before she got caught.
--------------------->

A life
A single life time
To be wasted in one
continuous comedy of errors
Is not a life at all.
Although there is comedy
amidst the countless errors,
I never see it.
The humor is unsaught.
All I see is error,
all I let myself see
is the error I've become.
a tragedy of errors
seems more suited
for a life as staid
as the one i drag myself through.

An ivory feather rests on the water.
It is well travelled,
Having stolen many rides from passerby breezes.
But those days are gone.
The water swells the bottom of the feather
It made a wrong move coming here.
Its simple independency is now as futile
As its escape from this pool.
The trees bid their farewell. 
---------------------------->

A phone rings in my head.
Yet on the line, all I hear
is a droning buzz.
A doorbell sounds in my ears.
Yet beyond my closed door
lies only the blowing leaves.
A door closes in my mind's eye.
Yet no one has come
or gone in weeks.
A voice calls out to me
and echos through me wholly.
Yet no one has said my name.

okay, anyway, I went to Amanda's to spend the night.  It was pretty cool.  We destroyed barbie's (great way to de-stress), watched <i>Edward Scissorhands</i>, then right after midnight we went out in the parking lot and threw poppers!  Some chick was out there and introduced herself, and i think she thought I was stoned off my ass.  I was going nuts.
Then we went in, cuz it was colder than martha stewart outside.  Then out came the bacardi rum and the cinnamon schnapps.  And it was all for me!  She had some pot, and I wasn't interested, so I just got shitfaced and smoked a cigarette.  I don't really remember much after that, besides talking alot. hah.  I guess I thought I could drink my problems off my mind... but fuck... all I did was talk about michael. hahaha, I'm a fuckin waste of time.  Amanda said I woke up to go to the bathroom, and I got up out of the bed, then fell back over and ran into the doorway. hahahaha... me drunk amuses the stoned.  eh, it was a good time.  Her mom is so great tho... She <i>so</i> knew mandy was smoking in her room... she didn't do anything. hahahaha  it was her mom's pot anyways..  ehh, just a mild bender to start off the new year, and I really fuckin needed it to loosen me out.  But I guess I got too loose, cuz I'm hungover today.  I can't walk up the stairs right,haha.  I have to go to the hennings later on, and someone is gunna call me on it... them and their 3 story house!! damnit!!  yargh, I need to go make myself useful somehow.  and I'd like to apologize if anyone tried to call my cellphone last night, I had shit reception where I was...  oh well...

"event","Well, it turns out michael and i really didn't know each other.  I knew we didn't know as much about each other as we should, but I didn't realize it was so bad until last night.  We had come to the agreement to call it quits, and get to know each other first.  But he asked me if I was okay with it, and I said I was fine with it.  Then he asked, ""Are you sure?"" and I said yes.  He didn't even know me well enough to tell when I'm lying through my teeth.  I cried myself to sleep last night.  Honestly, I have never cried that much, I thought something was wrong with me.  I didn't even cry that much at the hospital when my dad died.  When I woke up this morning, I looked in the mirror, and my eyes are swollen, almost shut.  I hadn't had an idea of how much I truly cared about michael until last night.  Shame he'd never read this, right?  I wish I knew how he was acting last night as we were talking.  I'm sick and tired of AIM.  I wish you could express true emotion on it, but I'm fed up.  Anytime any of you want to talk to me, <b>PICK UP THE GODDAMN PHONE.</b>  Maybe if we had talked on the phone, he would have realized how blatantly I was lying, and how much I was crying...  oh well, it's too late now.

Well, for the first time today, just like I was told, I thought of some of the really good times my dad and I shared, and I laughed instead of cried.  It felt rewarding, actually.  I thought of one night where him and I sat on the porch wall, back when we still had one, and we watched a thunderstorm.  And, as you all probably know, when there is a thunderstorm in Florida, it's a <i>THUNDER</i>storm.  We had just sat there for a good two hours and watched the lightning together.  And a few other nights, my dad and I sat out there and talked.  We talked about anything and everything.  I remember the porch at my house in Florida was such a great hang out... whenever anyone came over, we wound up sitting out there and bullshitting.  Good times.

No calls from Matt yet today.  I'm hoping he got arrested last night. ;)

Lately, I've been a mixture of really pissed off, and really sad.  Matt called a bunch of times today.  Thats one reason I'm pissed off/sad.  He's spending the holidays in South Florida, hanging out with my friends, and enjoying the high life.  He called me the other day from the side of Atlantic Blvd. to say that he saw Kelsey the night before, and that Florida is so gorgeous, and he was going to the beach..  ugh.  I made up some bright excuse to get off the phone.  I honestly don't want to say it, but I have to come to terms with it:  I really hate my brother.  He messes with me too much, and I don't think I deserve to sit through it anymore.  I've matured and developed a mind of my own, and that mind tells me to ignore his shit.  And so I will do.

Yesterday was my dad's 9 month anniversary.  That may have been a reason why I didn't feel like getting out of bed yesterday.  And I didn't.  I can't believe it has been that long already.  Time really flies when you're trying to ignore it.  Can you believe I've lived here for 6 months?  I surely can't.  But like I told Karli earlier, I'm still in a state of denial.  I think my October trip home really helped that denial too.  Oh well, I'm going to come home to stay.  And when I finally do, I'm not leaving."

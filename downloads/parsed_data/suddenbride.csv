"event","Probable honeymoon destination? Iceland. 

Why? Cause. 

I had thought it was a nice place to go anyway, cause, lets face it, hot is nice, but sand is gay. I hate sand. I dont like sweating, I dont like not having to wear many clothers. I dont like hot basically. So I thought it would be nice to go somewhere more interesting and as far as I know, Iceland has really nice hot spas and things like that. 

T thinks its a great idea, and apparently has always wanted to go there, so thats nice, that we both had it in mind. He loves Sigur Ros tho, but has promised that we wont spend the whole time trying to stalk them, so thats good. 

Today we went to the Thames Festival with my mother, I want her to get to know T and like him, but she seems determined to remain ambivalent. Its a bit irratating to be frank. (baaah)

Anyway so we went there, it was ok - she narked me after about half hour as usual (I dont understand how she is my mother, to be fair, shes so incredibly differnt to me its unreal) but it was quite fun, T managed to get himself soaked by running about in spurty water sculptures, it was very sweet. 

So we came back and she briefly left me alone before phoning me and irratating me a little more, she wants me to help her do something, and blah blah, but the fact remains I tell the woman I am getting married next year, her daughter, and shes just so factual about it, she hasnt said congratulations or been remotely even fakely happy for me, and it makes me terribly sad. 

I wanted my mother to be happy for me. Otherwise... frankly, who will be?! I wish Nana was still alive, she would be stunningly happy for me, I know she will be, wherever she is. I miss her so terribly.

"event","Grr, this is a confusing issue. 

I need to speak to the relevant councilly people, but am a bit scared to do it for some reason, I dont know why. 

Basically cause of James school and everything, I want to stay here in Kew. The school is just down the road, literally not even a hundred yards, and its a great little school. One of the best I have seen anywhere, and were almost certain to get in what with living so close. 

However, I am concerned about if Mum will let T move in here. It would be a squeeze anyway cause of the amount of techy stuff he has, but its more than manageable. I have too much shit anyway, most of which I need to get my arse in gear and sell. 

I dont know what the rent would be, or even if Mum would allow it. She might decide its not what she had planned and scrap the whole house, and seeing as its currently trying to morph itself into a pile of rubble then I can see why she might think that. 

HOWEVER I really do not want to move. I want Tom to be able to move in here after Christmas, Job etc being all in place, and then we have enough time together before the wedding that if one of us decides (highly unlikely) that we simply cannot live together then we have the option. 

I cant see that there would be anywhere else in the school catchment area which is even remotely affordable for us. 

I can go back to work part time when James is at school - perhaps - but only if it works out we get more money that way rather than less. Its a minefield. Grr the benefits system GRR!

I miss my friends.

"event","No no, not the scary japanese horror film, nor the crap American remake, but my engagement one. 

Or at least the plan. 

I had a look at some various ones for ideas with T today and we decided this is the best one for the job. We both like it and its in budget. What do you think?

"event","This is the journal of E who met T and fell in love. 

Slightly over two weeks ago, on 30th August 2006 I met the man I am going to marry. 

Two days later he was mine. 

Two days after that I knew I was in love with him. 

Two days after that, he asked me to marry him. 

And now, in these crazy two weeks I have:

* Lost a friend, or someone I THOUGHT was a friend, who had nothing remotely positive to say about this turn of events. 
* Met the inlaws
* Chosen the church
* Told a select few
* Enquired after venues for reception
* Told the vicar of our intentions 
* Set a date
* Fallen so madly in love I could throw up everytime I think it might be taken away from me.

We have to see the Vicar on 30th September, at 11.00, hes thrilled. He knows Ts mother and step father and they both work for the church. 

Its moving very quickly, but its all right, so its fine. 
I wish that I could share this with my mother, but today I realised that, or at least, made the assumption based on what I presume to be glaringly obvious points, that she severely dislikes T. 

Now. My next missions are such:

*Proper engagement ring for the Xmas annoucement, we are keeping it quiet pretty much till then
*Dress investigation
*Bridesmaids, and all that jazz
*DIET!

That will do for now.

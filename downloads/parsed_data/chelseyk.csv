You seem to be straight forward, but you keep a lot inside.
You're laid back and chill, but sometimes you care too much about what others think.
You prefer a variety of friends and tend to change friends quickly.
You tend to dream big, but you worry that your dreams aren't attainable.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howdoyouliveyourlifequiz/"">How Do You Live Your Life?</a></div>"

i dont know that we'd be perfect for each other, let alone ideal for oen another. who the F knows. we don't really know each other that much and it kills me. i hate this roller coaster of emotions he has a way of putting me through. it kills me, but stupidly, i get off the ride and right back in line for another go. oh well. another pity party for me. woohoo"

"event","SO DC boy and i talked all day yesterday while at work on AIM. We talked mostly about sex--mainly because of a comment he/i had made the day before and we both wanted to address it further on Tuesday. it was quite the interesting day, if only a day talking about sex! and what day isn't good when all you talk about is sex...maybe a day where all you do is have sex? haah

We both have lots of hangups regarding sex/relationships and i think they might be very similar which is a good thing because we can understand one another and yet it  is a bad thing because the same things are keeping us from attempting something between the two of us. i honestly think (and i say this with all honesty and not just something optimistic) that we're both afraid of letting go and being together because we're afraid of getting hurt. Trust is an issue for both of us even if we don't voice it or identify it as a trust issue. DCboy keeps saying things like ""i need to feel comfortable around someone before i'll be naked with them"". Although he doesn't say that he needs to trust a girl before he'll sleep with her, it's definitely implied. and i'm in the same boat. 

I am a strong woman, independent and not afraid to be alone. BUT am also afraid to be left alone and/or hurt so i am aggressive and turn people off from me--it appears to the outside person that i don't ""need you"" so they say fuck off and cut me out of their life, but in reality, i am trying to just protect myself from getting hurt. And in return i attract weak men that are looking for someone to provide for them (that's not the right word, but i can't think of the word i'm looking for). All of my exes have been weak in one way or another, needing something from me and in return i gave it to them but was the dominant person in the relationship. THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT ANY MORE. I am tried of having to be the man because these guys are too weak to grow a set. i need a guy that is just as dominant as me so that i an be submissive and be the woman. i so desire to be the woman and have someone take care of me and feel protected, but that never seems to happen. the men that are like that are usually scared off by my perceived personality and yet they never get to see the real me, the one that is actually very vulnerable and needy. i don't think that i am overly needy, just the basics. i want to be able to be myself with someone without worrying about getting hurt. 

with that said, i think that DCboy and i could be a good fit. i think he's actually dominant enough to take me, but also support me enough so that i feel comfortable with him and be myself. I also think that he has his own issues that i could support and make him feel comfortable. i think we both realize what it means and feels to be uncomfortable with someone you're with and don't want that. i think that we could be good for each other. i know that i'd never intentionally hurt and i'd never leave him for another woman, so i've got that on my side ;) and i think that if we were to try to be together he'd give it enough of a chance before wanting to find something else. it takes him a long time to build a relationship (and to subsequently sleep with someone)  that if he is going to invest that time into something he wants it to go somewhere, at least that's what i think he does, what he infact, he really does, is still a mystery to me.

so here's the dilemma... and i need HELP!!! 
if we hang out this weekend and the opportunity arises, do i sleep with him? (something i've wanted to do for almost 7 months) or hold out because the one who withholds sex has the power or tell him that i don't want it to just be about sex, it's gotta be more than that or just sleep with him and see how it goes? i fear, that with the last of those options that i am going to really like it and fall deeper into him and won't be able to get out of the hole i've dug for myself. i just don't know what to do. i've been thinking of telling him that i need more than just sex from him. that if it was only sex i wanted i could find it, but that i want something more and something more with him. 

i just don't know what to do, i'm torn. i want to sleep with him, but don't want it to just be about sex....fuck me.
hahah

"event","so suzanne yelled at me today because i hadn't updated in a while. i guess i just haven't had anything intesting to say and had no desire to share that lack of interest with the world.

Although, i did go to boston for a long weekend with soooze and the family. it was fun. glad to get home but was fun while it lasted. warped tour was fun (but SUPER muddy!) and the freedom trail pub crawl was fun as well, i would have liked to keep crawling instead of staying Jose Macs, but still very happy to finally make it to Macs. 

i ""applied"" for grad school today. sorta kinda, i think. i paid the fee, so i guess i applied. i applied to Strayer University for an M Ed in Education Management. not sure if its exactly what i want (i might for the MPA instead of M Ed), but the plan is to do well in these classes so that i can show growth for when i apply to a real school. Although Strayer is over 100 years old and i thought it was just one of those crappy online schools, but i was wrong. maybe it'll be worth it. i want to get several degrees so maybe this is a good start. it's right around the corner from work so it'd be ideal to take a class or two while working here.

although not offical, i've been promoted to program officer. woohoo. i'm trying to develop my job description because the job is almost entirely open except for the duties that are MCs. I want to pick three states/urban areas to start my focus on. i'm not sure where i want to go. all the places i have any personal interest in have already been taken up by either MC or previous efforts (mainly CA and Boston/MA) so we'll see where end up. Any suggestions are welcome! i'd like to work in areas in which i know people and could ask them for advice and, mainly, see them when i'm in the area. 

ok it's after 6 and i'm still at the Fing office, i neeeeeed to go home :)

"event","Ok, so it's been a stressful couple of weeks. This will be a pretty comprehensive update. i feel bad that i haven't updated in a while on here or in my 'real' journal, but i've just been too pooped to do anything and now that i've moved i'm not sure where my journal is right now....hahah 

1. the move: well the move is done. it was rough. so happy it's done. i love my new place. it's excellent. cotter (coworker) came over and helped load the truck up. at my new place some random guy and my new landlord helped unpack. thank god they came, otherwise it would have been HOURS to get things done. i was completely exhausted and mom wasn't doing so well either. so thank god they came around. Kendig was supposed to help move, but he got lost (majorly) and ended up showing up just as we were finished-literally. he followed up the last set of boxes. haha.

2. the new place: over all i love the new place. i've got mad crazy room but not a lot of closet/storage space which sucks butt, but i'm dealing. i'm not completely unpacked yet but am hoping to get things done this weekend. i spent MAD amounts of cash while moving in, hopefully i won't have to go shopping for any length of time! haha the only thing that sucks so far is the commute, it's about an hour or so. yesterday it took me 1.5 hours to get home. might have to work on that...

3. boys: 
        A. well Kevin came down and i had quite possibly the worst weekend of my life with someone, it was that bad. he was horrible. a jerk to me. made me pay for everything (except for a $2 bottle of water). and i didn't even get a thank you out of it. WTF. and secondly he's SUPER inexperience when it comes to the bedroom. it was bad. he didn't return any favors and generally seemed very disinterested in the whole idea of sex. not a normal guy by any means. i've discussed with others my thoughts on his sexuality. Is it because he's so inexperienced that he doesn't know how to treat a girl right or does he just not care b/c he's gay or something along those lines. i know it's a broad statement to claim he might be gay just based on the fact that he wasn't into me, but really, let's look at the evidence. he had a girl (a girl is a girl is a girl, no matter what she looks like) that was willing to do whatever he wanted and didn't take advantage of the situation. to top it all off HE DUMPED ME before he left. WTF i didn't know we were together and in a position to be dumped. HAHAH WTF i couldn't believe it, i couldn't look at him, otherwise i would have laughed my ass off at him. i just kept looking down, mumbling something about long distance relationships. hahah
       B. Kdawg: things with this kid are moving slowly but exciting. he's coming over for dinner and a movie next week (breakfast at Tiffanys and i'm not sure what i'm cooking yet). we seem to really hit it off on the phone and enjoy each other's company when we're out. the only problem is that i'm not attracted to him physically and that worries me a bit. that i'll settle for him just b/c he's around and i want some, but not really honestly into him. i dont know. we'll see. ""she was easy and so was i"" (josh kelley lyric) haha
       C. DCboy: well i think things with us aer done. finally and forever. i've tried to continue a relationship with him on the friendship level, but nothing has happened. i've put myself out there over and over again, so i can't get blamed for not trying. i worry that i'll compare every guy i meet to him. he's by no means perfect, but damn close, at least for my standards. i just don't know. i feel like he's my other half and we'll end up together but the realistic side of me knows different and better. i hate being in this position. it's always tough to be vunerable. i just wish i knew why he didn't give us a chance. i certainly though we had 'it' or at least enough of it to try and see where things go. maybe he felt it as well and didn't want to put himself out there and get hurt again. he seems to be a serial dater b/c of fear of repeated hurt from females. i just dont know. i really want him but know i can't have him. 

4. work: 
     a. well my boss Sarah is leaving in a few weeks for a new job. i'm SUPER excited for her, it's what she really wants to do, but i'm also a bit worried. we already had a crazy fall planned and now we're down to 2 people and i have a feeling that meg will try to do it all no her own instead of ask for help and that offends me. i can handle more responsibitly, i'm a slacker b/c i'm bored, not because i'm stupid. haha i wish that they'd start to include me and make me feel like an equal. i'm worried that we'll not find an ideal director and meg will have to step up but i won't be able to. i not sure...
           i. this could be good for me, i could really step up and sort of define my role here at ___ which could be cool, but on the other hand, i might not be able to. i might be kept at assisant and all that entails. i dont think i can handle another year of 'assisting'.  
           b. i'm still looking for a new job. i really really want to work on the Hill and not sure what i need to do to get there. We got a resume from someone on the Hill that wants to leave an Ed policy job for Sarah's job, WTF. i would kill to have this girls job, it is my dream and i want it. i need to get in. i need to get back to school to get an additional degree.
           c. i found a job with the Charter School Leadership Council which we should work with but always seem to be blown off by them. i'm not sure if i should tell SC or MC that i'm applying in case the heads over there give a call to them to chat about me. it's quite the dilemena i do believe. or at least i think so.

5. AFU: I haven't been there in almost a month, or at least it seems that way. I am working this weekend and am not looking forward to the commute AT ALL. maybe i'll be able to quit and not have to work any more there. although i'd miss it, but it's a tough commute to do. we'll see. if i get a new job in which my pay raises any amount, i'll definitely quit. i can afford to live where i'm living now on this pay, but the AFU pay just makes it a bit easier and more enjoyable. we'll see.

6. other:
       a. i got an email this morning, i'm going to be able to attend an intimate Josh Kelley performance at XM radio. I am BEYOND excited! i can't wait. and by intimate, i mean less than 40 people! WTF. i'm SO excited. i can't even express it at this point :) i can sorta invite someone, i wish i had someone that loved JK as much as i did...i thought about emailing DCboy to see if he's interested, but i'm tired of looking desperate. maybe i'll reserve the spot in hopes of finding someone else that's interested. we'll see.
      

I think that's it for now. maybe i'll think of more later. wasting a bit more time at the office and then headed home for the weekend. thank GOD it's friday :)

-i found out yesterday that my boss is leaving for a new job in a few weeks, i'm totally excited for her but that leaves M and I in a bit of a lurch so that's not good. AND today M went for an interview for a new job (she didn't tell me, but i'm smahart. wicked even. i'm a little worried if both S and M leave within a couple of months, that'll surely suck for me becuase i won't get a promotion/raise and will be stunted in my work b/c i won't have a boss to answer to. i dont know. i wish i could find a perfect job for myself-but that'd be just too easy! although I did find a Hill job yesterday that I need to apply to ASAP working with domestic issues, so that might be a perfect fit. I think i need to revamp my resume so that i get more interviews. my experience is impressive but i'm not getting any calls and that worries me. maybe i'll stop by B & N today to see what they've got to offer. hmmmm

-boys. why can't the one i like be interested in me OR the ones that like me be interesting....

-unpacking. it's not going fast enough for me. i need to take a day off and do it...maybe i'll stay home tomorrow....

-K visiting this weekend. i'm unsure about how things will go. i hope my mood seriously changes SOON. otherwise it'll be a long ass weekend. 

whatever

"event","Well it's been forever since I've posted anywhere, even in my offline journal of deep dark secrets. Interesting. Not sure why I haven't been posting, lots of possibilities but none of them are legit...

lots of things going on in my life:

1. moving! this weekend to SE. i CAN'T wait. this will be my new neighborhood www.hillcrestdc.com I'll have 6 (yes you heard right, SIX) windows of my own! score! no more batcave for me!

2. klepto- maybe he's the reason why i haven't been updating. I talk to him for hours and have nothing else to say/write. that could definitely be it. he's enjoyable and i'm excited about his visit, but it's just all to parallel to my last LD relationship that i'm a bit worried. but sooze has given me some solid advice on how to deal with it so hopefully things will be a-okay and fun ;) i'm worried thought that he'll be too bland/vanilla for me. he isn't very wordly, nor am i, but compared to him i'm well above average. i'm concerned that i'll be bored and will have to do a lot of teaching and not enjoying. i dont know. we'll see soon enough. sooze thinks that i might teach him a thing or two which might be a good thing for women down the line from me. that's why i think i like DCboy so much--we have so much that we could teach each other, whereas with klepto, i'm not so sure he's got anything to teach me. 

3. kdawg- another K name, what is it with me and men named with a K. we went on a 'first date' last night to dinner and drinks. we had a good time. he called to make sure i made it home okay and emailed me this morning. sooze thinks he's seriously into me. i'm fine with that :) he's not my dream man, but he's a nice guy that could be fun. he's not a college graduate and that concerns me, i think there is something to be said about going through the process of college, even if its just some stupid state school that you drink your way through. He's a smart kid, but doesn't have that edge that i want. i feel like i'm having to, again, teach him things. but he seems geniune in his desire to learn and that's fun.

4. dcboy- i think i'm done with him finally. i still consider him a friend and wouldn't mind calling on him to ask for help/advice, but i don't think he'd do the same for me. we talk less and less now adays and as sooze says, i think he's giving me the 'fade', so i should take cue and move on, which i'm doing quite nicely.

5. friend situation- things have been going well in this regard. my coworker invited me over for her 'game night' for her best friend and i had a blast and got really drunk ;) i was also invited to another party on saturday night by one of the people that was at the party for Liz's last night in town. i'm not sure if i'll be going yet. for two reasons: 1. i'll be moving that morning, not sure i'll be up to drinking all night after that; 2. it's my co-workers best friend and i don't want to step on any toes...i haven't decided if she's cool with me going yet--i haven't been able to gauge her yet. another co-worker also has included me on many of her shenanagans, so that's been nice. her group isn't exactly my type of people but that's okay. they provide variety.

6. work- well work still stucks, but the intern's last day is tomorrow so that's a good thing :) i honestly can't wait until she's gone. she's stupid and retarded and PLUS she hates Joe (BU guy who arranges internships). who the hell hates joe, he is amazing. but whatever. i guess its just a matter of opinions. 

7. other- found out the the ex moved into a house with the girl he ""cheated"" on me with. I call it cheating but i'm not sure if there was physical cheating or just emotional cheating on me. that's fine--whatever. but it's interesting that he's finally moved out of mom and dad's place BUT only with another female. i'm not sure if he'd ever move out on his own or even anywhere with A and that concerns me that he'll never truly be independent. although i already knew that, but this just 'seals the deal'. I am certainly NOT jealous of his current gf, i don't need no husband or worse yet, i dont need no child yet. damn. i've worked hard to be able to take care of myself, i really don't want to be taking care of anyone else any time soon (at least not in the motherly sense of the work- feeding/laundry/etc). I wouldn't mind taking care of someone though in a healthy way, relationship-wise. i think that'd be a good thing. 

whatelse...
-my mom is coming into town tonight and i'm super excited. i haven't seen her since April and she hasn't been down here since Christmas so it's been quite a while. i'm glad she'll be able to see my old place and my new place all in one trip. 
-i'm headed back to boston for warped tour with sooze in Aug. I was supposed to go to a red sox game with J-Stew, but not sure if that'll happen now that he's in looove with C. i'll be a little bummed if i can't go, but i also COMPLETELY understand.
-bostonbrenn is the love of my life :) too bad i'm not his. well everything except that he's a diehard republican and isn't open to other ideas. at least DCboy was open to other ideas, i didn't come close to changing his mind, but at least he listened--or at least pretended pretty good. hmmm


that's all for now kiddies

"event","Well i went to see Michael/Howie/Gavin on Wednesday night. It was a beautiful thing. 2nd time for Michael, 1st for Howie (GO MAINE!) and xth time for Gavin (can't really remember how many times) but i love that kid. Tolcher was interesting. i liked him better this time than last time in June. He seemed to have more of a stage presence and was really enjoying himself. I wish the crowd would have been more into him so that he could have felt cool. that's what sucks about assigned seating, the opener fans can't move up front for their guy and then move back (if they so choose) for the headliner. but anyway. 

Howie was entertaining. i'm not sure if he's alwyas that stiff or just nervous or wasn't feeling the crowd, i'm not sure. but he had a fab opportunity to get lots of new fans and he didn't seem to meet the challenge. i found him to be super talented just not crazy on the stage-although that's how gavin used to be back in teh day, so maybe he'll loosen up more. but whatever. collide was fab-u-lous and someone proposed during it, so it was a nice time.

gavin, oh dear gavin, what can i say about ye? i love him so much. he's great. i wish he woudl have played more unknown songs (relative, she holds the key, dreams, full of herself...) but he stuck mainly to the CD and a few favorites. no 'let's get it on"" (although i've noticed since ALvin left he plays it less...) but he did sing ""a few drinks..."" which has to be one of my favorites, espeically when everyone comes out and sings the chorus with him--that's great. part of me liked knowingl everything that was going on, i knew, for the most part, what his set list would be...what song he'd play next and how he'd sing it. part of me enjoys that familarity but then again, i wish he'd mix it up, esp. for those diehard fans that have seen him numerous times and want to hear the less popular (but even better than the record) songs. 

He owned the stage and the entire venue, all 7000 of us, it was amazing. he has certainly learned how to work the crowd and use the entire stage-i'm glad that he has. suzanne made a comment last year about how his songs were cool but he wasn't very fun to watch, i hope that's changed now for those who are seeing him for the first time. i know that i get  a kick out of him every time, no matter what's going on. 

speaking of 'hardcore' fans, i finally got to meet my 'enemey' Riz. He's so annoying on every post he puts up and i can't take it, but figured it'd be worth meeting him so that maybe i'd have someone to hang out with while at the show. he (and his friend) were completely rude to me so i said ""see ya in the show..."" and walked away. He and his friends ended up standing just feet from me and  instead of calling me over to chat with them he ignored me.what an ass. and of course he was in his 'suit as a gov't employee' fuck that. who wears a WOOL SUIT on a summer day?! WTF?! PLUS he could have brought clothes to change into like EVERY OTHER person out there. i think the gov't would understand (if 'they' even noticed) it just makes him look like the prentenious man he is. part of me is happy that we're not ""friends"" i can't stand people that are OBESSED with things...yes i've had my fair share of obessions but reality was always and i mean always part of the dream. i knew that i'd never make out with Chris Dyment, but did that stop the dreams? no. but with Riz and his friends, they are obessed without reality. they think they are ""friends"" of these rock stars. they aren't friends, they are crazy fans. yes, tolcher and/or gavin might recognize them, but that doesn't make them friends. Fuck, Chris Dyment recongized me, but i never considered us friends, not in the slight...wtf

anyway, here is Riz's xanga so that you can read for yourself his snotty 'tude. i can't stand the kid. http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=thegreatriz
read away and enjoy.

need something good to look forward to, not sure what it is, but need something--well maybe calling Kevin M (steve's friend) tonight will make me smile. Although, it seems pointless he's in MA and i'm in DC, but he's a sweet guy. AND he's cool- he's on a Sox vacation...St Louis and Chicago...now that seems fun! :)

"event","SO i'm not sure what exactly to make of all this. We went out on friday to see Washington Social Club (good band, will def check them out again) and it was all strange, tension like. I likened the event to a first date...we don't know if we like each other, if there will be a good night kiss or what. It's like our first date but we've already made out...back to square one all over again. is this the beginning of us 'dating' again or the end of our 'relationship' beginning of our friendship? i'm not really sure. There was one point in which a kiss would have been perfect (as well as perfectly normal timing) and he didn't go in for it. it made me think a. he's a wimp and PDA's are this thing; b. he's waiting for me to make the move or c. he's just not that in to me. which one is it? conventional wisdom would make me believe the answer is C but with him, nothing is conventional, so i am honestly unclear. i'm admitting it people, i'm lost and don't know what to do. well i know what i should do, and that includes getting rid of him from my life completely, but that's just to easy, what would my life be like without drama. i like this kid and want something to come of all this work over the past, almost, 6 months. i think we helped each other get over recent break ups (although he was heartbroken and i was just eh...) but i'd like to spend more time with him.
i thought about us being ""just friends"" on saturday. that maybe we can't make a relationship between the two of us work, but maybe we can be friends. i'm not sure it's what i want, but at this point it'd be something definitive in this sea of wishy-washyness. eh i just dont know...suggestions anyone?"

"event","so i think things with DCboy are finally over (but then again, who the fuck knows with him and his fuckin' games he plays). Guys claim that girls are the ones who play all these mind games, but rarely, is that the case. it just seems like every guy i know plays games at some point and most girls are just like ""eh..."" and are sort of straight forward. I have been nothing but open with DCboy and i thought that would be best, but i guess it wasn't good enough or wasn't what he wanted. 

guys all say that they want independent women and when they get them they don't know how to handle us and when you're ""needy"" or less than independent, they freak out 'cause you're so demanding/needy on them. what the FUCK do they want? i guess the same is sort of true with us girls. We say we want somene sensitive and crap and when we are presented with them we don't know how to handle them and freak out calling them pussys. so i guess we're both to blame for this wacked out society we live in with men acting like women and women acting like men.

i just don't understand why two normal, sane people can't get together and have fun and leave it at that. why does everything need to be wrapped up in drama. why can't it be easy? Well maybe not easy, just easier than it is...

but what the fuck do i know...that's right folks, nothing. i know nothing when it comes to matters of the heart. I thought i was in love back in college with j.c. and i still think about him a lot, but now that i'm older, i can't honestly answer if i was in love or not. it makes me sad to think that it wasn't love because there were serious feelings for him, but i have to wonder, if i'm not sure, then it probably waasn't love....

hmmm...


kevin said he'd come and visit me this summer :) that'd be fun. he's a nice guy although i'm not sure about his friend--i might not be able to handle long intervels of SC. haha. but kevin is fun and sweet and i'm sure i could show him a good time!

I have an offer to go visit a much older friend in CA this summer. it's sort of a standing offer but i'm not sure if i should take it...

thinking about going to london/england for a few weeks maybe next summer..staying at Pax Lodge and traveling around...maybe that's what i'll do. hmmm unless i can think of something better to do.

later

he actually went to tahrir
bunch of times
he talked about how all those people who died
how horrible that was
that each of them was our brother or father or neighbor or whatever
that he had a friend
who went to tahrir one day saying he was ready to die for his country
and he was killed that same day
and that he himself wished he had died in tahrir as well
that he used to be the type to not bother speaking up if he saw something wrong
b/c it was too much of a bother
like if a cab charged him extra he wouldn't say anything to avoid a confrontation
or if he saw something wrong outside he would move on and think ""the next person will say something""
but that now he started being the one to speak up
that we all should speak up when we see something wrong, especially now
that we should never allow a dictator to rule over us again
and that if we don't make changes now the same thing will happen again
only there won't be protests every other day
and if we let another dictator rule over us then it's our own fault
b/c we're too cowardly to see it through all the way
in which case we deserve it and worse
that all the fathers who refused to let their grown offspring go to tahrir were wrong
b/c they are the reason we suffered 30 years under mubarak
b/c they refused to speak up
were too scared to
and that if something like this happens again in the future
and he has kids
he will take his kids to the protests himself
he got really emotional at one point and was all in tears and stuff
was really v v touching
and we had like a moment of silence for the ones who died

I want to start by saying I fully, 100%, blame <lj user=lyntek> for this post, my addiction to the subject of this post and the current lack of space on my hard disk.

This is also your official spoiler warning for Doctor Who, Season One, and a few spoilers for older Doctors!

<lj-cut text=""Let the Doctor show you what's beneath the cut!"">

<img src=http://pics.livejournal.com/summerbreeze21/pic/0000fd1e align=left hspace=5> I've never seen the older seasons of DW so this is my first brush with it. And I have to admit I was hooked pretty fast. 

The premise is pretty simple. The Doctor is a time traveler, his ship (the TARDIS) disguised as a blue telephone box. He travels in time and space to watch history happen and usually takes along a companion for the ride. The Doctor meets Rose in the first episode and invites her to come along with him, and she does. Later on in the season they pick up Captain Jack Harkness, another time traveler.

Christopher Eccleston plays the part of the 9th Doctor, but I'll come back to him later. From what I have been told, the part of the 8th Doctor ends with him ending a war between his race and his enemies by destroying them all. The 9th Doctor is the only surviving Time Lord.

<img src=http://pics.livejournal.com/summerbreeze21/pic/0000ey7e align=right hspace=5> I was instantly taken in by Eccleston. It's mostly his grin, like a kid in a toy or candy store; very infectious and I was instantly charmed. I thought his acting throughout the season was great and was already starting to mourn the loss of him by episode 3. I just couldn't see how anyone could make me enjoy the character as much as Eccleston did (and I still can't, but that's not the point). I don't think words can do justice to how much I enjoyed his version of a Doctor I never even knew of before him, and to a certain degree I find it regrettable that he was my first exposure to Doctor Who, because the possibility that I might enjoy the next few seasons less due to the lack of Eccleston is very real. On the other hand, it was a really really good first experience.

Eccleston aside though, I think the Doctor as a character is incredibly cute (wrong word maybe? XD). From the enthusiasm, the jokes and grins and the way he enjoys showing off in a way that's not at all annoying, to the anger that pours off him during certain memorable occasions, I was really just happy watching the character unfold without worrying much about anything else. It was fun to watch, and interesting, and I don't really need more than that to watch something.

<img src=http://pics.livejournal.com/summerbreeze21/pic/0000cbhf align=left hspace=5> I can't mention just one character in here, much as I would like to go on and on and on about the Doctor and Eccleston. However, <a href=http://pagefillers.com/dwrg/doc9.htm#3>this review</a> expresses all I want to say about Eccleston in much better words than I can come up with, so I will now turn to the other two that made this so much fun to watch.

I'm going to mention Jack first because I am totally biased. Captain Jack Harkness shows up in episode 9 where he tries to con the Doctor. He fails (obviously XD) and ends up joining the Doctor and Rose along on their trips. I loved the interaction between the three of them that they showed in episode 11, it made me grin; they were like a bunch of hyperactive kids, best friends forever. Of course that doesn't last; by the season ending things go very very bad and poor Jack gets the short end of the stick. He's such a fun character though, what with the constant flirting with anything on legs. XD &hearts;

Rose's turn. Because <lj user=lyntek> insisted I should watch episodes 9-10 first, I didn't have the best first impression of her. But by episode 2 she was growing on me and I can honestly say now I'll be just as sad during season 2 as I was during 1 because looming ahead is the event of Rose's departure. BBC sucks. Q_Q Contrary to her looks, she doesn't act overly ""blond"" and ends up saving the Doctor a few times, although she does have her oh-so-stupid moments as well. I haven't completely figured out the relationship between her and the Doctor yet but they seem to be pretty close overall.

I also want to take a moment to mention Mickey, Rose's sometimes-boyfriend, because he has so many awesome moments and probably gets under-appreciated what with all the love for The Doctor, Rose and Jack. &hearts;

<img src=http://pics.livejournal.com/summerbreeze21/pic/0000gpyc align=right hspace=5> One more character(s) needs to be mentioned - the Doctor's enemy, the Dalek. <lj user=lyntek> described them to me before I got to see them and I kind of laughed at the pictures. They don't really look creepy, but god - the voice really is the stuff of nightmares. XD I think my youngest sister would be completely creeped out by it, and a bunch of them talking all at once doesn't really sound pleasant since they have this tendency to shout ""Exterminate!"" in chorus. XD The episodes where they show up are my favorite of the season because it's always memorable and the Doctor is always so, so good in them. &hearts;

I won't say all the episodes of Doctor Who are breathtakingly awesome. Some of them are normal, others are beneath normal. Most are creepy in some way, all except one or two have extremely funny moments. The seasons are 13 episodes each so watching all of it isn't much of a chore. However, if you want the best of the best and don't mind missing out on some things, these are what I would recommend.

<b>Episode 2 - The End of the World</b>
This episode isn't really all that special plot-wise but I thought the idea was amazing. Was already hooked from the preview - the Doctor said ""welcome to the end of the world"" and I wanted to instantly go and watch. I still really like it although it doesn't compare to the episodes that come later. But it's a good episode and a good way to start.

<b>Episode 6 - Dalek</b>
This is the first episode that has the Dalek. Eccleston was great in here, every second of it. A little bit of the history comes out (I think anyway, am not 100% sure) and the interaction between the Doctor and the Dalek made me extremely happy. This episode also has what is in my opinion the best line of the show.

<img src=http://pics.livejournal.com/summerbreeze21/pic/0000h76z align=left hspace=5><b>Episode 8 - Father's Day</b>
This one focuses mostly on Rose and shows how much the Doctor cares for her. It's a really sad episode but the story is good and it has tons of great moments between the Doctor and Rose. Not really critical to the overall storyline though but definitely worth the watch.

<b>Episode 9-10 - The Empty Child and The Doctor Dances</b>
Jack's entrance into the series. I found these to be pretty creepy. :X The story itself is pretty nice but not critical to the overall plot. Recommended because of Jack and Jack and oh, Jack!

<b>Episode 11 - Boom Town</b>
The Doctor in-depth. Kind of depends on episode 4-5 but they show a short preview at the beginning so you can skip those two completely if you want. Not critical to the plot, but since it shows new information about the Doctor and the TARDIS and is overall amusing I still recommend it.

<b>Episode 12-13 - Bad Wolf and The Parting of the Ways</b>
The end of the season. I love these two the most; there's very little to laugh at, more to cry at since this is the end of Eccleston (for me anyway D:) but gorgeous episodes anyway. Starts off a bit weird, don't let the beginning turn you away; it's totally worth it. The Doctor, Rose and Jack were all so &hearts; in these two episodes.

</lj-cut>

I'll probably start to download the next season soon and hopefully David Tennant will charm me as easily as Eccleston did. *tentatively optimistic*

"event","LJ issued two statements on <lj user=lj_biz> concerning the banning of artists who, according to them, had posted art showing minors in sexually explicit situations and what was supposed to be a clarification of their policies. These posts are <a href=http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/241884.html>here</a> and <a href=http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/242136.html>here</a>.

The part that had me curious was this:


<blockquote>* How is LiveJournal determining whether figures depicted in drawings/artwork are underage?

A number of factors are involved in making this determination. Any stated age of the individuals present, the apparent age of the people or characters present in an image, and outside knowledge of the person or character's age are all taken into consideration. The only one of these factors which can be evaluated alone is how characters present in the image are drawn, and this is only done when there is simply no other information available to help determine age.</blockquote>

Seeking more information, I posted a question to both threads and did not receive an answer. However, my support request finally did get one.

Am posting the exchange here and leaving the post unlocked (and uncut, sorry!) for anyone who feels the need to link to it. Will add to it as I get more answers.


<blockquote><b>Original Request:</b>
I would like to ask about this part of your policies:

""* How is LiveJournal determining whether figures depicted in drawings/artwork are underage?

A number of factors are involved in making this determination. Any stated age of the individuals present, the apparent age of the people or characters present in an image, and outside knowledge of the person or character's age are all taken into consideration.

In the case of series/books/anime where the characters in question are minors, a lot of artists including myself increase their age in both art and fic (alternate universe genre/future genre). In that case, if the artists post art/fic with these characters and a disclaimer that says ""the characters depicted are over the age of 18"", would that be enough to protect the poster? Assuming that, especially in the case of art, the characters don't look 7. If not, could you please tell me why?

In the case of series/books/anime where characters are, in fact, not minors but look like minors (example: the anime Ouran High School Host Club has a character called Hunni who is at the time of the anime 15. However he looks 7, so at age 20 he will still look very young) how do these policies apply?

<b>Comment:</b>
Image of the character in question, Hunni: <strike>http://syu.less3.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/260406_ouran_0007.jpg</strike> (<b>edited for this post only:</b> try this link: http://www.anime-source.com/banzai/images/topcharacter/84mitsukuni.jpg, the other one doesn't seem to work anymore)

I've been informed that Hunni is in fact 18 in the anime and still looks 7. I would still like to know how your policies apply in this case.

<b>Answer:</b>
Dear LiveJournal user summerbreeze21,

Stating an age for a character as being 18 or older, and drawing them as an apparent 7 year old engaged in explicit sexual conduct would be treated as a minor. Stating an age for a character as 18 or older, and drawing them as someone who is 18 or older, would almost certainly be treated as the character were an adult. It would likely qualify as a ""questionable"" violation if the character had a stated age of 18, and were drawn to appear as a 14 year old, and be treated as explained in part (b) of http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/242136.html.

<b>Comment:</b>
Thank you for the response, even though it took almost 2 weeks.

I would like further clarification in the case of a character that is stated to be 18 but, according to LJ staff, looks 14. This concerns me because in many cases this is due to the style of the particular artist and is not in fact an indication of the character's age. In cases such as these, where a warning is issued to the poster, does the poster get the chance to argue against it? Would showing other samples of the artist's art that contain the same style be enough reason to revoke the strike?

<b>Answer:</b>
Dear user summerbreeze21,

Thank you for your follow-up questions. LiveJournal is aware that there are many styles of art where a character is made to appear younger than they actually are. However, for the purposes of enforcing our policies as described previously, the visual appearance of the person being depicted will always be given high priority in determining whether the material is a violation.

The situation you describe is one of the scenarios that led to LiveJournal revising its policies to give a 'warning' of questionable material, rather than invoking a suspension immediately. It gives the warned user a chance to remove such material and any other content they have posted that may fall into the same categorization to avoid any action being taken against their account.

The warned user would always be able to appeal the decision by contacting the Abuse Prevention Team with their concerns. It is unlikely, though, that additional samples of the artist's work would have any influence on a decision, as decisions are made on the reported material individually. Please let me be clear that this is not to say that 'an appeal would never be successful' -- it is only to indicate that the specific act of showing additional material would likely have little to no effect on a decision on its own.

<b>Comment:</b>
Thank you for the follow-up.

I understand the points you clarified better now, however I still have a few questions. I can understand that LJ would rather be safe than sorry and that styles that make the characters look younger can be a risk. However, <lj user=rachel> stated in the lj_biz post that an age statement on the art of the suspended users would have been enough to keep them safe. That thread can be found here: http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/242136.html?thread=14176984#t14176984

This directly contradicts with what I have been told and I am curious about why what <lj user=rachel> said is not feasible, since unless the art (containing an age statement) shows a character that is, without a doubt, less than 18 (this would mean the character doesn't even look like a teenager since seeing the difference between a 16 year old and an 18 year old is extremely difficult) there should be no reason to give the poster a warning. If I am wrong about this could you please explain why?

My second question is what would make an appeal successful or what should a warned/suspended user do to show that the art/fiction in question did not contain a minor if LJ is already convinced of the fact that it does depict underage sex?

<b>Comment:</b>
It's been a week since your last response and I am still waiting for an answer. Please don't make me wait another week.

<b>Answer:</b>
Dear user summerbreeze21,

I apologize for the length of time it has taken to respond to your follow-up questions. The Team attempts to respond to all inquiries within a few days, but during times of heavy load or in regards to more complex situations, this can cause a longer delay than we would like.

An age statement is unlikely to ever qualify, on its own, as the sole determination for the age of a depicted individual. Though it can provide assistance in determining age, the actual appearance of the character as drawn will always take precedence.

There are basically three categories of ages that are being discussed with regard to these policies. Let me address each one individually and how the 'appearance' of the character would be affected, or not affected, by the presence of an age statement.

1) The first category is images or artwork that clearly depicts a child under the age of 13/14. This would be material that nearly all dis-interested third parties, looking at the image or drawing, would easily assume the depicted person to be a child. To use your original example of the 'Hunni' character, people who are fans of or are interested in these works may realize that the character may in fact be 20 years old. But to anyone outside of that realm, the appearance of the individual as drawn is that of 7-year-old. There would be virtually no difference between such an image and a separate drawing of someone who was actually 7 years old.

Therefore LiveJournal is choosing to act on such images regardless of the 'story arc' of the characters or the art style being used. In these cases, an age statement that the character was over the age of 18 would likely have no bearing on the decision and resulting actions.

2) The second category is images or artwork that depicts individuals in the 'teenager' years -- not yet a legal adult but no longer a child. In these cases, there would likely be a far greater discrepancy on what dis-interested third parties would say was the age of these individuals. A 16-year old may appear 20 to some people, 16 to others, and 14 to others. Therefore, this is the general age range for which the 'questionable' policy was adopted. Because it is no longer clear to a majority of viewers that the person depicted is a child, the LiveJournal user will be given a warning and a chance to remove that image before further action is taken.

In these cases, the presence of an age statement that the person was 20 years old, for example, would be taken into account during the decision process. The age statement provides an indication of what the intended age of the character is, which can be used as a guideline while reviewing the content. Again, though, an age statement is not a 'get out of jail free' card, so to speak. The physical appearance of the character will always take precedence.

3) The third category is images or artwork that obviously depicts individuals who are adults over the age of 18. This category, as you noted, is rather self-explanatory. All or nearly all third parties would assume the age of the individuals to be over the age of 18, and therefore the presence or lack or an age statement would not be a critical factor. As the image or artwork is clearly depicting adults, no action would be taken.

To address the comment made by staff member Rachel, I apologize that her statement was made in such an 'absolute' fashion -- as you are already well aware, there can be no absolutes in regards to these issues and policies. As explained above, an age statement alone will never be the sole factor in determining the age of depicted individuals.

To address your final point, we do not have examples of what might constitute 'additional proof' that could be used to appeal a decision that has been given. In general, though, it is unlikely that discussion of 'art style' or the book/series from which a character originates would have very much effect on a decision that has been given. In the case of an appeal, I can only say that we would ensure that the decision and original material is again reviewed thoroughly, with the likely addition of at least a few more staff or Team members to give additional perspective.

Should you have additional questions, please feel free to reply to this request. Please let me also state that I understand your frustration in these matters, as you and many other users are trying to get as many clarifications as possible. The unfortunate reality is that this is a very difficult subject to draw lines around -- there can be very few 'black and white' absolutes when dealing with these topics.

"event","I've been nagged at to make this post for a while now. I've caved in b/c...I don't know really. Posts on Gaia annoying me I suppose?

If you read this, be warned that this contains a lot of political opinions you may not like. This is the truth as I know it, and is not meant to be offending to any party.

<lj-cut text=""Palestine, Israel, Lebanon and a lot of rehashing, b/c that never comes to an end"">

<b>So how did it all start again?</b>

The Palestinian/Israeli conflict has been going on longer than I can remember, way before I was born. The short condensed version is that the people Hitler put in his camps had no place to stay, and England offered Palestine. That's the basic truth; Israel invaded Palestine. The conflicts since then have been numerous and not known to most of the world. What did stand out though, was when Muhamed El-Durra, the young Palestinian boy who was walking home with his father, was shot and killed for no reason. 

I'm sure a lot of people will remember that incident since it was all over the news. I won't bother to rehash it, but I will say that from that time, more people started paying attention to what was going on. It also increased the rate of suicide missions. I know a lot of people think Hamas goes too far, but think about this for a moment. It's their only way of fighting back against an oppressor.

Lebanon/Israel is another thing entirely. I don't know as much as I would like about how it started, but from what I have heard Hezbollah took captive an Israeli officer, and Israel retaliated with missilles. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about this, like I said I don't know many details.

<b>Preconceptions that piss me off.</b>

-Muslims do not equal Arabs. This is not a 'muslim' thing, it's an arab thing. The two are mutually exclusive; we have christians, jews, buddhists, etc here too you know. There are muslims in America, all over Europe and East Asia, and they're not always arabs.
-Not all muslims are fanatical. Not all muslims are terrorists either. That's like saying, 'all americans are white, all europeans are stupid, all africans are poor'. Does it sound insulting from the other side? Saying all muslims are fanatical is extremely insulting. Sure, some people are. But then, you have those in every religion. Stop generalizing.
-Israel is not the victim. They started this, be it with Palestine or Lebanon. If they stopped, if they actively worked at a peaceful solution, the conflicts would stop. Hezbollah and Hamas would have no reason to attack them anymore.
-Islam is not a violent or intolerant religion. Saying that ""muslims view anyone who isnt muslim as infidels"" is a load of crap. One of the main principles of Islam is tolerance. There is a verse in the quran that translates to ""you have your religion, and I have mine"".
-Hamas and Hezbollah are not terrorist groups. They are fighting for their freedom. Resistance groups. If someone invaded your country, wouldn't your country do the same?
-Arabs don't hate America, England, Jews, Christians, etc. Some people do, of course, but not the majority. A lot of people do hate Israel though. Can't blame us for that.

<b>What it all comes down to, really.</b>

The basic truth of the matter is that the land belongs to the Palestinians. The other basic truth is that Israel doesn't want peace. 

It is sad that people find it so easy to forget the real victims in this. You pick up a paper or check the news, and if an Israelian died it'll be front page, bold headlines, public outrage. But dozens of Palestinians die every day, and all they get is a small news article. Israel has made itself into the victim, successfully so.

A lot of the mistakes people make would go away if they actually bothered to sit down with a muslim and asked about their religion. It's not as strict as it seems and does make sense.

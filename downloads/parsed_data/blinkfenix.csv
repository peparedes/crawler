"event","I dont completely understand how playing games with one of her friends is hitting on her. We have broken up, and she still insists on trying to control every aspect of what im doing. Everything has to be by her rules, if it doesnt benefit her why should she do it.&nbsp; The only reason she came over to give me my stuff any of the like 3-5 times she only did it because we had a chance at getting back together. So of course this time when there is no chance she is goin to take my ....MY&nbsp;STUFF&nbsp; and donate it to someone else..... excuse me? 
Do i hear Federal offense coming in her direction like a baseball from a pitcher.&nbsp; You cant just take my shit and donate it, or give it away, its mine and belongs to me, and im sure its prolly mario party which i have not seen at my house and im pretty sure i left it in her rez apt for her and us to use. 

She also has the nerve to say i never cared.... Examples of me caring- valentines day, when she was in trouble, spending all of what money i earned in landscaping on her or us,&nbsp; nothing really on me unless it was for work or occasionally a video game, or on her parents, and one day in the year my family....aka christmas, which in any case i spent so much on her the only thing i could buy my family was in the 20 dollars and cheaper range.&nbsp; my mom got a freaking picture frame, i cant imagine how shitty she must have felt.
Hardly ever seeing my friends, like i saw friends 3 maybe 4 times a year, that was birthday, and when they came into tim hortons, or when i went out because me and her had a 1 day to less than 24 hr break up.&nbsp; i came to toronto every&nbsp; other weekend or at least tried to even though i was broke, in the hole, at one point i was -369 dollars, and im never that deep, i only have 500 overdraft protection.
I did pretty much everything that she told me to.&nbsp; my friends call &quot;can you hang out man&quot;&nbsp; ..&nbsp; &quot;can i&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;no&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;no sorry guys i cant&quot;&nbsp; 
I didnt have any of my friends in my phone- i had to relinquish my phone because i couldnt be trusted&nbsp; so she could check who ive been talking to. i canceled my car insurance so i would have enough money to come up to see her and my car sat in the back yard and died,&nbsp; 



This is all i want to write for now"

"event","as i hate being the third wheel and i was never or never felt like the third wheel around my friends girlfriends or stuff like that, it comes as no surprise that i am the third wheel around my own gf and her best friend,&nbsp;&nbsp; she might as well be her bf they get along better&nbsp; anyway,&nbsp; she makes her laugh something that i have a hard enough time doing even though i spend every day with her. it doesnt seem to matter, when she is around i might as well not exist,&nbsp; i try to talk and i talked over,&nbsp; its like my life i try to live and i get walked over. i get used&nbsp; im a doormat a step for people to whipe their feet on&nbsp; welcoming them into something better. im just the piece of shit you wipe all the dirt off before u take your shoes off and go walk on the real nice carpet and relax.&nbsp; just apparently im one welcome mat that doesnt want to let my victim go.&nbsp;even though the carpet is calling out to her.&nbsp; although&nbsp; its by choice hopefully that she stays.&nbsp; im really jealous of her best friend because i cant do that to her. make her laugh , make her happy&nbsp; get along so well, share all the inside jokes of years.&nbsp; i guess im my own enemy on this one, no one can help me make her laugh at my stupid jokes, no one can make her get along with me 100% of the time.&nbsp; but i keep trying to make it work and i feel its like&nbsp; trying to keep up a house of cards as its falling down. impossible.&nbsp; but i love her and she yells at me all the time.&nbsp; and i cry and she&nbsp; hugs me and makes me feel better ..... occasionally.&nbsp; i was playing gamecube while she was cooking&nbsp; and waiting for her friend. so when she asked me to stop i was fine with that. but i had to save it&nbsp; and i knew i didnt have enough time&nbsp; to get to the savepoint so i turned off the t.v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as to be able to save it later when i had time to.&nbsp; but she was just mad i played at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; but when she decides to play i sit and watch intently because&nbsp; i dont mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; but she wont&nbsp; watch me play nor will she ever its interesting as long as its one game and she is playing, mind you she doesnt mind when i play the 1 game&nbsp; that she likes, but&nbsp; as soon as its any other game, she doesnt want me to play it unless im home, which 1) i want to be with her and 2) i dont want to be home.&nbsp;


its almost as if she tries to not pay attention to me at times.&nbsp;
she tried to send me home, and really i dont want to&nbsp; because one she wanted me to be there and two i wanted to be there.
i wish i was her, to be so care free and loving and connected at the same time, not jealous and full of stupidity,&nbsp;
cut me down
bring me down to whatever you want to me just give me that connection, i would give anything to be as close to her as her best friend.
i love her so much and i wish things were as good with us as it is with her and her friend.






















i fuckin hate myself
i hate how i like my games&nbsp;
i hate being ignored
i hate being the third wheel
i hate not being able to make her laugh
i hate not having that connection
i hate that i cry every time i realize
im not right fo her&nbsp;
but i love her to much to tell her that again"

"event","&nbsp;i have thought about somethings
it occurred at work today
a man from another tim hortons came in and was chatting with a co worker of mine about the new uniforms. she asked why he wasnt wearing the new uniform yet and he replied&nbsp; "" too many fatties "" . A given my colleague was slightly aggitated and offended because she herself is slightly over wieght.&nbsp; she proceeded to make fun of skinny people as he left, and i myself a skinny person was slightly offended&nbsp; but she was more making fun of how ""he had his pants hiked up and left nothing to the imagination, and he didnt have much of a package"" (she sed) and commented that if i had done the same with my pants id prolly have a package, i just shook my head, because one she is old enough to be my mother and not attractive in the least and two im very much in love with someone else.
but in light of her making fun of skinny people and him&nbsp; making fun of fat people i created a word for these people,&nbsp;
and that word is&nbsp; "" weicist or weightist"" im not sure yet, but is a person who makes fun of another persons weight.&nbsp;
as it goes with racism and sexcism

and contrary to popular beleif im not a racist or sexcist or whatever they call people who hate gays and lesbians.
i accept every race and welcome them, i dont discriminate against colour but am known to say things like "" i got jewed "" as sarcastic as it is some people find it offensive and given it prolly is and i have been trying to avoid saying such&nbsp;said remark. also i have refrained myself from using "" stupid jew ""&nbsp; for people i dont like, that IS offensive and i have stopped saying it.&nbsp;&nbsp; i DO have a problem with people who cant speak&nbsp;the english language, if&nbsp;you are going to move into a country at least learn to speak the language. unless of course you are visiting, but then try to bring a translator to make&nbsp;your journey easier for us and for yourself, if we cant understand you we cant help you, or we may misunderstand you and give you something you dont want.&nbsp;

and for watever they call people against gays/lesbians, i say hey go be what you want to be, your sexual preference has nothing to do with me, go ahead be gay/lesbian not a problem to me, but being as it is that i was almost raped by a man i dont like being around one specific gay man. but if you leave me alone and respect my sexual preference i will leave you alone and respect yours. i have been hit on by men and i dont hate them for it, im not afraid of them i just prefer to be with women.&nbsp; and no im not a hompophobe, people like to assume this about me too. i just have one thing to say &gt; im not.&nbsp; but i do have to say my perception is i dont&nbsp; like homosexuality in itself yes that is true i think its wrong but hey i cant stop you from doing it.&nbsp; its like trying to connect two headphones to get sound, it jsut doesnt work u need headphones and a cd player thats just how it works, my view is purely for procreation however,&nbsp;
for pleasure purposes, it doesnt bother me because i know im not in it to procreate right now lol. 

as for sexism i highly beleive my mother is a sexist, i think she hates men that arent a certain way, and&nbsp;she also thinks every bad driver on the road is a man. I like to clearly point out when it isnt just to piss her off. i personally of course&nbsp;think each gender is equal in its own&nbsp;right.&nbsp; just that some women arent as strong as men, but there are some women stronger than men. but women speaking in terms of biology arent supposed to be the strong ones, they are the natural care givers and men are the supposed hunters and protectors. now i dont think that applies today, but biologically speaking thats how men and women are made, that is their biological purpose. now in todays society i dont think thats true at all, in fact id rather&nbsp; the care giver rather than the hunter.&nbsp; likley because im scared of actually having a real job because i wouldnt know what to do, but parenting ive seen done and ive helped to do it&nbsp; and i know how to do it therefore id like to do it because i know how to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

well thats my thoughts on those touchy subjects. maybe&nbsp; next time ill reflect on religion!!! hahaha j k"

"event","<p>i like to be gentle, caring, nice, generous, polite, curteous,&nbsp; but im also the opposite of those at times,&nbsp; sometimes im a hypocrit to and ill admit it<br />i work at tim hortons and any person who oders a whole sh it load i get pissed but when i go thru drive thru i order a whole shitload....&nbsp;<br />i wish ppl would apologise to me for what they do, cuz im always apologising for what i do<br />it may take me a while but i'll do it eventually<br />i would like ppl to say something to me first but i know they never will<br />i wish ppl were more accepting of me but then id prolly get worse,&nbsp; its hard to break a habit,&nbsp;<br />when all compliments fail try just telling the truth it works better than trying to be poetic and romantic,&nbsp; i like being poetic and romantic&nbsp; it feels more special, but the truth is way more real, say what u mean, these are things i need to do,&nbsp; as well as some others,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />i hate myself<br />i want everyone around me happy<br />i spend pretty much every day with someone and i dont care that my mom says i spend too much time away from home..... i hate her anyway.&nbsp; i wish i was with her 24/7 i wish i was with her now</p>"

"event","i feel horrible, everytime, she hides something from me, i think it must be important and she just doesnt want to lie cuz she doesnt lie, but that it would hurt me
and suposedly its for the best, but sometimes id rather just know about it.
i love her so much it hurts like chopping my own leg off with a rusted broken saw.
but i cant help but think im letting her down
that im the reason she is in pain
but then sometimes i see it, the glimmer of happiness, it doesnt show often or even much around me but then i read what she posts and it fills me with joy to see that she loves me, because i love her and want to be with her always
i jsut wish i wasnt so much of an asshole, that i was more considerate, im always thinking of her but when she is arounf my inhibitions fail, my suave personality dies, my abilty to sweet talk and charm women is useless, its like im superman and she is kryptonite,&nbsp; so wrong for each other but so right at the same time,&nbsp; she takes away my abilities and makes me the real me,&nbsp; superman is fake and his powers are everything, but instead of being powerless around her i just feel real, i dont feel weak&nbsp;, i feel like she is the only person who knows who i really am, because to everyone else ima fake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

i love u and will always forever till i die kristin, i hope u feel the same way"

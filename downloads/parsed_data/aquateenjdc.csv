"event","I don't know what to do I must have really screwed up cause now nicole doesn't even want to talk to me at all. she totally ignored me last night and I don't know why. I just i don't know I am confused does she really love cause I feel if someone really loves another person they wouldn't just completely cut off contact for no reason. I feel that love means no matter what there is a person you will go to for and with anything. but I seem to be the problem for her so much that I sometimes question if she would be better off without me and get scared thinking that maybe she is thinking the same thing. I can say one definite thing I AM TIRED OF WORRYING AND WONDERING. I want all the worrying to stop. the only way for that to happen is for me to be told if nicole truly loves me or if she feels I am an un-neede burden and I should leave her life and leave her alone. I hope she truly loves me but she is the only one who can answer that."

"event","All I was trying to do was make nicole feel better and then for no reason she decided to ignore me. I knew the fact that ""she convinced me""! not to come up would make her be mad at me. she repeatedly said that it wouldn't but I guarantee if i was up there that she wouldn't have ignored me. that i guess is what really started my hatred of talking on line and over the phone if we are face to face then it is kind of hard for her to ignore me but if for some reason she decides she doesn't want to talk. then I am screwd over the phone and on-line. which i think is very un fair. I am not one of the people that is talking about her behind her back, i am not one of the people that doesn't include her, I am one of the peole that loves her and tries to make her feel better when the other people make her feel bad but i am the person who gets the brunt of her anger and sadness and the main person who get ignored and treated like i have done something wrong. It shouldn't be that way. It should not be me getting punished for trying to help and those people who are the problem get treated like they have done nothing wrong. I don't know maybe trying to be a good boyfriend is the problem cause that is what it seems like sometimes. I can't begin to explain how useless and pointless it makes me feel when i am treated this way. I am being selfish right now cause I did nothing wrong and I am being punished. if she has some sort of problem with me that makes her take everything out on me I wish she would tell me or let me know when to go away."

It sucks but it happens. when it happens what do u do. how do you turn the switch back on. or do you have no control over it. does it mean something when your loved ones don't seem to enjoy you company? well time will soon tell I guess."

"event","Bad to say but I am at a breaking point. I don't know what I want anymore. I try to be happy but when the best thing in my life is deteriorating how can I be. I wish we could get past this and u could get past what ever problems u are having but I don't think u will any time soon. If u are fed up tell me, if u want me to go away tell me, but don't keep me around if u are always gonna be angry at me. I guess I just feel let down because if I was being an ass or if I was being a bad boyfriend I could understand being treated this way but I get treated like the bad guy for trying to cheer u up or make u laugh or just for trying to be nice to u. I don't want to feel like this. They say take the bad times with the good but lately there are 5 times more bad times than there are good. I am just so sad to be saying any of this stuff because I wish we could just be like we used to be happy and happy together. But hey if nothings wrong u just tell me and I will believe u but if u feel the same way as I do then we need to solve what ever the problem may be. I will always love u no matter what and I hope u feel the same way."

"event","I am very confused right now. Something is wrong with me. on my way home from work i started to cry. I don't know why but I did.I've been sad alot more lately. I don't know why that is either. Maybe its because I'm scared maybe its because that is just the way I am or maybe its a personal thing. I can say sometimes I do feel like I am the only one who is totally commited to my relationships. It is small things like not saying i love u or when someone gets angry they ignore me, or makes me feel bad for being upset when i can't spend anytime with her.I understand total commitment is a hard thing to have but what bothers me the most are little comments about the future. when the words u or I are used instead of we. things like this make me wonder do u see me in your future or not.I can remember a recent example of this. WE were out eating and I waved to a little girl and said see I am friendly towards kids. and the response that I got was thats good for when u have kids. but I guess I look at things to hard sometimes and can see things that arn't there. I have noticed one more thing. I can sometimes,and this is rare, feel a sense of resentment when I am with someone or talking to someone and I just don't know why. maybe resentment is the wrong word but I can't think of a better word for it seeming that someone doesn't want to talk to me. but like i said maybe I am looking at this to hard and seeing something that isn't there. I love you nicole and i hope this doesn't make u mad if you read it."

"event","ok I figured out what is wrong with me.for some odd reason I need to have contact with the people I love and I mean real contact. I have noticed though that I need to realize that sometimes some things take precedent . homework or other things are very important and I have to realize that. I guess it will have to be if I see nicole for 30 minutes during the weekend when she is back then I guess that is 100 times better than not seeing her. I do sometimes no matter what nicole says get the feeling that she is getting fed up with me and with our relationship. but that is just an impression that i am getting. and i also feel that we may be growing apart or maybe i should say i feel that she is growing further away from me. I could be totally wrong. hopefully I am. but this could all be in my head but that is why I am typing this because i am saying things that are in my head. I love you always nicole and I hope u feel the same still."

"event","Am I wrong to be scared of losing everything. Am I crazy to think happiness only comes in small doses when i am alone. Is it weird to be hurt by words. Does distance take away the longing for and the thought of loved ones over time. These are some questions that are always in my head. I don't know why but I think sometimes I may be scared to be happy because it seems when u are the happiest is when the worst things happen in life. 
I wrote a poem: 
TEARS ARE LIKE RAIN DROPS THAT FALL AND CREATE
FEAR IS A FIRE THAT BRUSHES CREATION AWAY
THE HEART IS SO FRAGILE IT IS BOUND TO BREAK
AND THE TEAR CREATE MORE SADNESS AS THEY FALL DOWN MY FACE
HAPPINESS IS FLEETING AND BOUND TO FADE
ONCE SADNESS COMES IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO STAY
A SMILE IS FOR MINUTE BUT TEARS ARE FOR DAYS
WORDS CAN BREAK HEARTS OR BRING A SMILE TO YOUR FACE
LOVE IS CONFUSING IN SO MANY WAYS
LOVE CAN CHANGE FROM DAY TO DAY
LOVE IS SO WONDERFUL AND WORTH EVERY PAIN
CAN'T GET TO LOVE WITHOUT A FIGHT ALONG THE WAY
I don't know why I put that in here. I can say that I am happy. The happiest I have been for as long as I can remember. I am thankful every single day I can wake up and be able to read the words or hear the voice of the women that I love and that i do want to spend the rest of my life with. Some times it does seem that I am put on a back burner so to speak but u know what it doesn't matter as long as I can hear her I will be happy no matter what life brings. It does sometimes make me a little sad to think that she would prefer to hang out with her friends than talk to me but that is her choice and I am not the one to tell her how to manage her time or how to enjoy herself. I f she doesn't want to talk to me I would be sad but I would let her have the freedom to do whatever she wants. because I trust her to never do anything that she knows would ruin our relationship and if she doesn't want this relationship I trust that she would tell me and wouldn't lead me on. I can say I am the luckiest person alive because I met her and she changed my life so much for the better. So I will end my entry the same way i always do because it is just as true today as it has been and will be everyday for the rest of my life. I love nicle and hope she reads this and likes my poem and will not be upset by anything in the rest of the words. I love nicole always"

"event","I figure something out about myself today I am a solitary person. I don't need friends to be happy. I am happy because I have a girlfriend who I love and who loves me and that is all I truly need to be happy. I also realized that there are not many people who are solitary. Everyone else around me seems to like having friends, actually some of them seem to need friends to be happy. I guess that is what confuses me about some people, I guess since i don't need friends i don't understand why any one else does. I could sit here and talk to my girlfriend all day and be extremely content and happy but it does sometimes seem to me that that is not enough for her and I actually understand why that is now. friendship is an important aspect of life but every person has a different kind of friendship that is important to them. I hold the friendship me and nicole have close to my heart because it is the most important kind of friendship to me. nicole says our friendship is important to her too but she also like having friends outside of our relationship. Its awesome cause she has found a group of friends up at school that she can in a word call her own. a group of friends that is all her own because neither me or her parents will ever meet any of them so the only person who has contact with them is her. but this is a lot of words to say I am a solitary person and nicole is not so we don't need to argue over each others ways of life we just need to except."

  I seem to have come across that delema lately. I am in love I enjoy my job and I'n used to that being all that I have but lately i fell lonely a lot more and never feel very happy unless I'm talking to Nicole. maybe that is it because for the past few days I haven't been able to talk to her much at all. I understand she is sick and has a life up there at app. but I just wish zi could talk to her a little bit more. But other than that I can not fiure out what the hell is wrong with me. well enough complaining. I love ya nicole."

"event","I am weird. I am the only person I know that can be lonely when I am surrounded by people. today even while I had my mom, mary,doug,his employees,and the neighbors all around but I still felt lonely. I guess I am weird in the way of it doesn't matter if i have a hundred people around that are all there to see me It doesn't matter unless the one person that I really want to be there. I am always lonely. I am waiting for the day that I don't have to be lonely anymore. that will be a short while away but i guess what they say is true, "" you have to deal with the bad to get to the good"". I also miss nicole so much that sometimes it hurts and I want to cry. she was telling me about her back hurting and it was hurting me because i wanted so bad to be there and hold her and make her feel better or at least help her find a way to feel better. but enough of my complaining cause me complaining and whining about this won't fix anything. Now on to something better, sort of, Nicole went to the doctor and found out that her back pain wasn't serious and got medicine to help her get better. I got to talk to her some today but I glad for that because I got to talk to her before i went to sleep, right after i woke up and when she found out why her back was hurting, so I don't have to wonder why and worry as much anymore. I love you nicole."

"event","This weekend was a weird mix of work and weird conversations. I had the whole week off from the theater but I still worked everyday but thursday and friday at target. me and Nicole were having I guess you could say some bad conversations this week and we made a few promises to each other. we promised each other not to end any more conversations on a bad note, I promised not to get upset over stupid things anymore and she promised not to be a "" meanie weenie"" anymore. I keep telling her she isn't mean she just seems un-interested in our conversations lately and I don't think shes mean. I told her she doesn't have to hide when she is in a bad mood from me because when we are together forever we will deal with each others bad moods. I love her so much that it kind of hurt me when she said maybe she is trying to push me away because she doen't want me to have to deal with her being up there and me being down here. I hope she knows the only way I wouldn't have to deal with that is if we weren't together. I hate when we have a bad conversations because It means so much to me even if we only get to talk to each for 10 minutes I love every minute of it. I also right now at this point in time promise to try my hardest not to get in any arguments with Nicole especially over something stupid that doesn't warrant an argument. we argued about something stupid and I don't want to ever do that again. I thought about it a lot and realized I trust nicole more than I've ever trusted any one in my entire life. so I shouldn't worry about stupid things like that. I love Nicole more than anything and I don't want to screw up what we have because this is the most important thing I've ever had in my life I truly want to spend the rest of my life with her and I know we can last forever and live a long and happy life together. One more time I love nicole with all my heart and am very excited about our future life together."

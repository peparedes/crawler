"event","SO...let me give you background story as to how this happened:


my mom's best friend from Highschool (lynn) went on to do hair/makeup in Hollywood. She soon got attached to the hip with Billy Bob Thorton, and now exclusively works with him and people she is reffered to from him. 


So, my mom bought me and her a pair of tickets to go see Wicked at the Pantageas Theatre in LA last night (July 5th). We were going up to Have lunch with Lynn and meet up with her early, but she then realized that she had to go to ""do Billy's make up for a shoot"" and we just had to come along. SO, my mom and I seriously, hung out at Billy Bob Thorton's house all day. And he was the nicest person ever. 

<lj-cut>
He lead us to his living room, where we hung out and watched Ellen while he got his make up on 

<img src=http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y74/MandyShell858/LA005.jpg>


He also had a Tinsel Christmas tree in the corner of his living room

<img src=http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y74/MandyShell858/LA004.jpg>



Yeah, I know these are crappy pictures, they were taken all covert op. style. I was like, this is totally wierd that this is in his living room, I have to capture this on film...so I felt like the paparazzi all hiding my camera, taking pictures...ANYWAY



Then, Lynn got us some watermelon from the kitchen, and Billy came in to socialize ""so, you like that watermelon?"" it was so cute how hospitable he was. He kept urging us to go out and play ping-pong, so we did...but were totally distracted with his dinosausr fountain...

<img src=http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y74/MandyShell858/LA006.jpg>




and for Chris, I got a pic of his pool...

<img src=http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y74/MandyShell858/LA007.jpg>




So I unfortunately didn't get any pictures of me with Billy because, he was working the whole time, and I would have felt wierd being like ""can I get a picture with you."" 


So, it was just so surreal, that I spent the afternoon at Billy Bob Thorton's house, an academy award winner...and he like, showed me how to use his awesome remote control for his TV, and I played Ping Pong on his Ping Pong table, and I layed down next to his pool on his hammack...who knows, angelina and him might have fucked on that hammack...and I saw his baby on the baby monitor, it was just so cool. 






So then we finally went to Lunch with Lynn at a Sushi restraunt in Beverly Hills...good times, the best sushi ever. If you are ever over there, it's called u & Mi sushi...

</lj-cut>,

Next, onto Wicked. Stephanie J Block was absolutely amazing.
<lj-cut>,

<img src=http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y74/MandyShell858/stephaniejblock.jpg>

She has an amazing voice, i love her. love her, love her.
I am totally going to be Elphaba for Halloween, and everyone is going to be like ""who is that wierd musical theatre girl...but I'm going to do the first scene where she comes on, in the little blue hat and the blue turtleneck and coat...so cute. Anyway, it was a great production. The Galinda was awesome, but at times reminded me of Mary Catherine Gallager...on crack. She was seriously bouncing off the walls, (which i love) and reminded me of Nicole Sullivan from Mad TV...
anyway, good times...

I'm now going to study for my ""server final"" tomarrow, then crash...big time...

"event","OMG, so much to talk about. First the really good news, I got called back for Bet in Oliver at Starlight. I also got called back for ensemble in Oliver and Sound of Music. I am so excited. I am going to my CCt audition in about an hour and a half. I use to have horrible auditions, and then I started doing more and more karaoke and then I found a song that I can nail and that I'm really compfortable with and I have been having great auditions. Yay for me...


The really exciting news is that yesterday, I spent all day in LA at the CBS studios watching American Idol live. I went to the dress rehearsal at 1 , where I was put in the front row. It was amazing to see everyone so close...Nadia was beautiful (well, so was carrie and vonzell, but nadia was just stunning). AND the most exciting part was COnstantine....Having eye sex with me the entire evening. It was so hot. Like, he winked at me....and then when they were standing in a line at the end...he looked at me and was smiling. So hot. I want to have that man's babies. Granted he fucks me with his eyes (the camera) every week when I'm watching him at home...but this was hot. He definetly knows how to work the ladies. My mom and I didn't have tickets to go to the real taping, so we decided to wait in line and try to be stand by's (or seat fillers as I would call it) and we were in the back right on the floor. I got to touch simon, because he walked right by me...and I realized how much I like Randy. Like, when Paula and Simon would walk by, they were just kind of pouty and what not, but Randy would go around shaking the little kids hands and was always smiling and laughing. i really like him. 

Fun times...

Oh eyah, after the taping, mater and I went to Cheesecake factory and as we were leaving we saw scott savol cross the street (which we almost ran him over...don't know how we missed him) and we stopped for him to pass and he kind of did the ""thanks"" wave and my mom rolls down the window and says ""HI SCOTT!! WE JUST SAW YOU! GREAT JOB!!!"" even though is her (and my) least favorite...


OH YEAH...another funny thing...some chick was passing out wristbands promoting John Stevens (the crooner from season 3 who SUCKED) while I was in line...and she tried to give me one...and I was like...""eew, why would I want that, he sucked' and she just gave me this nasty look and was like ""well, I would think if you like american Idol, you would like him..."" and walked away. It was great. I felt bad because it just kind of came out of my mouth. Oh well...I'm a bitch, what can I say. 


My show, anything goes opened last weekend. it was smashing. you all should come see it. It isn't like any other show at City that I have seen, it is actually really good! hahaha, tah tah!!!

I am pretty much realisticly shooting for CCT this year (hopefully even get a big part...can anyone say ""rizzo?"" haha). If all else fails, I have a guaranteed role in ""Night of the Iguana""

I am so tired. Boo...Oh, this is my first Sunday night where I am home early from work, and I got to catch up on Desperate Housewifes. I love that show. 

Oh yeah, and the biggest news of the weekend...I broke up with Ryan and I am moving into my parent's house on Tuesday. I'm really excited about being single and independent again. 

That's about it...

"event","Amanda, when it comes to psychic abilities, you have an unusually strong talent in the area of Precognition 

This means you have an uncanny ability to look into the future and know ahead of time what is going to happen. You might, for instance, simply know that you're going to get that job before the interview even happens with a certainty that exceeds what you would expect to have simply knowing the facts of the situation. You might have a sense of dread before going out for the evening only to later have a flat tire on your way home. These little hunches are easy to ignore but for you especially, quite often lead to a true prediction of what is going to happen. These predictions can be used to generate positive outcomes, and the more you know about how to use your talent, the more you will be able to distinguish between fantasy of the future and an actual reality you are seeing happen, before it has actually happened."

"event","SO -- Tomarrow is my audition for Anything Goes at C(SH)ity College. and I had a dream last night...let me just repost what I already wrote on the Myspace JT forum...hold up:

""Ok...my thoughts are: Should I post this and sound like a big tard...OR...let this message board stay as inactive as it is...then I figured, I AM a big tard, so post it anyway...


SO-- Background info: I have wierd dreams that are rediculously real. Like when Heather was in town, I had a dream that we were just having a normal conversation, and then she tells me that she is pregnant. It seemed so real, so the next time I saw her, I was all ""are you pregnant"" It felt real enough to ask...wierd, I know, and it has happened numerous times...

Another bit of background info, is that tomarrow I am auditioning for Anything Goes at City college, and I would like to be hope...hope-fully (hehehe...see, like I said, big tard)

last night, I had a dream, that I was all ready to audition and I had my little tap shoes and everything...AND THEN, in walks this crew of people who did JT and were like 1-2 years ahead of me: Courtney Oliver, Zicciah Topping-Reddcliff, Anne Buck, Lindsey Hubbard, Leah Bernardy...Everyone...and here I am...thinking I had no competition, the part's in the bag, and then all of a sudden, in walk all of these talented people (armageddon style, how they all come in the door at once). 

SO---

to easy my fear, if you are a JT alumnus (or current), please don't audition for Anything Goes at city college tomarrow....that would make things very scary!


Thank you for your time.

SO If Ashley Linton shows up tomorrow (taking a break from her Les Mis tour) then i am officially psychic!!!

Rollerblading is not as easy as the girls I see rolling past me on the boardwalk make it look. Seriously, you would have been laughing your asses off if you would've seen me yesterday trying to ""blade"" in these things. I think it's about time to invest in a good pair of knee pads, because I guarantee that I'll need them. I swear I will use them a lot and they will not collect dust in my closet. This is the year to get fit and in shape...I have gained so much weight since I have started working at Marie Callenders (hello, free pie till your heart's content everynight before we throw them away...you would gain all that weight too!) BUT I have been SO GOOD lately. I have been excersizing almost every day of the week, and my body is starting to feel better. Go me! (watch, now that I actualy say that out loud, I will stop excersizing, and gain 20 lbs).

Anything Goes is M/W/Th from 6-9 and Fiddler is t/fr 6-9, Sat 9 am. Plus, The actual shows won't conflict with eachother. I haven't done more than one show at once (Rocky doesn't count) since summer of 2002...Once ON this Island, Suburbia and Smokey Joe's Cafe...that was hell, plus trying to work...Sure this way I'll have no free time, but I will be doing stuff that I love. 
PLUS...I haven't had the opertunity to do a big tap show (since I have learned how to tap..Crazy for You doesn't count...I only knew how to do shuffle step:if that) So, even if I get ensemble, I would be happy, because I could dance. 

Exciting stuff!

I just need to pick out a song for my audition. I don't sing Opera, but I can...and the director for City usually puts girls with ""opera voices"" as the leads, so I thought I would try an experiment and sing ""Think of Me"" from Phantom or ""memory"" from cats...What should I do..."

ANYWHO. It is good stuff, I'll find out tomarrow what the dealliyo is. Since it was an open audition, I got to see everyone's piece. OMG, I swear Sheila (catherine O'Hara) from Waitiing for Guffman auditioned. ""California will be a sight for these weary eyes!"" I wish someone was there to share the experience.

"event","Ok, for those of you who don't know, there has been this old guy comming into Marie Calleneders every day since I have been working there (and probably longer). He always drinks a 1/2 caraf of merlot (plus another glass)...and this is at lunchtime. So he is always getting trashed, and therefore, completely sexually harrases the waitresses. every single day he asks me ""hows your love life"" or ""hows life in the fast lane?"" And since I am the only person there who encourages it, he takes it rediulously far, by saying things like ""you need to leave your boyfriend for me..."" or ""I would take such good care of you..."" and stuff like that. So he obviously wants to be my sugar daddy. But he is the DIRTIEST OLD MAN I have ever seen. He cracks me up though. I can't believe some of the things he says. Like one day, he says to me (I'm a 34 C mind you) ""Boy, you sure are flat chested!"" and I was all like ""um, dutch, have you seen my boobs lately, I don't think so"" and he's like ""oh yeah, I look at your boobies all the time!"" REDICULOUS! And then the next time I waited on him, he was staring at my chest, and I say ""Dutch, what are you looking at?"" and he says ""your boobies!"" 

There are so many stories I can tell, it's just rediculous some of the things he says to me. Anywho, the moment you all have been waiting for...DUTCH!!!

On the other hand, as amazing as I think he is, I am really sad that him and Jennifer Aniston broke up. Granted I didn't know them personally, but they always looked so happy together, and she was the one person in Hollywood that I could definetly see him with (especially not skanky Juliette Lewis). 

Anyway, Troy is amazing. Everything about it. From Brad Pitt, to Orlando Bloom to Eric Bana. It's just great."

"event","New years eve was quite fun, and simple. I made dinner for Ryan and myself, and I drank an entire bottle of Beringer's Founder's Estate (Merlot)...we watched Wicker Park with Josh Hartnett, and then went downstairs and flipped on the tele and watched the ball drop and watched fireworks. We busted out the Champagne, and then I threw up, and then some roomates came home and we all talked and ate Santanas. I just got 2 new roomates: Holly (from Texas, who is a total sweetheart) and then Bobby (from New York who is a soccer friend of Ryan's brother). I ended up passing out upstairs watching Van Wilder.

and that is the story of my new years eve.


...New years day on the other hand was horrible. Both Ryan and I got ""talked to"" at work by the GM, because someone reported ""inappropriate actions"" that we were doing with eachother. First of all, yeah, Ryan and I are a couple and work together, but we never do anything at work. No kissing, no hugging, nothing. We have been together for over a year, and I think now is an inappropriate time to be talking to us about ""behavior."" I felt like I couldn't do anything because I know I am innocent and this man is so frekkin intimidating. Next he proceeded to get onto me about my hair. He said that before I got promoted to team lead, my hair was always nicely pulled back, and once I got promoted to TL, he said that my hair was all over the place. That is dumb guy speak for: I GOT BANGS!!!!Frekkin rediculous. I am the best damn team lead there. I make sure everything is done, I'm not lazy, I do all the stupid shit they ask me to do (that no one else does)...even my appearance: my clothes are always clean and wrinkle free, black socks, shirt tucked in. I am a frekkin model employee. But just because Ihave long bangs that I brush aside, I get in trouble. So he is asking that I pin them back. WHAT?

I am over it. Completely over it. If I get fired for stuff that I did not do (the ""inappropriate behavior"") or get demoted for something out of my control ( Bangs) I will frekkin sue!

"event","I am so glad that I have balls of steele. Marie Callenders closes at 10 pm. The manager always goes and locks the door right when our coo-coo clock chimes. She forgot...so these two regulars (a real asshole guy) come in (I have waited on them before, and they are two of my least favorite customers) at 10:03. I say to them, ""I'm sorry we're closed"" and they continue to give me a blank look. I say again, ""I am sorry, the kitchen is closed, the restraunt closes at 10 pm. Sorry"" and then my manager walks over and they demand to be served...she lets them ( because by law, if the door is unlocked, then we have to let them in). I tell the cook that we have 2 more customers and to stop what he was doing. he says ""sorry, the kitchen is closed"" and I say ""I know juan, but they refuse to leave, they are being stubborn."" Well, I guess the guy heard me. I'll admit, I was coping a bit of attitude, but only because he was so rude when he came in and he was incredibly rude to me the last couple times I waited on him. 

So this bitter, cranky old man asks the busboy what my name is, and he says ""Amanda"" and so then the man asks the busboy to get me, because he would like to talk to me. I go over there, and at the same time, my manager, Andrea, goes over there. she is standing inbetween us, and he starts yelling at me ""I demand an apology!"" While pointing his finger at me.
me: Excuse me?
Him: You heard me, I DEMAND an apology!
Me: what exactly did I do to apologize for?
Him: You spoke down to me and my wife!
Me: What exactly did I say?
Him: That isn't important!
Me: Actually it is...what did I say?
Him: You were talking down to us the second we walked in! You don't know us!
Me: Because you know what? I have waited on you before, and you were nothing but rude to me!
Him: That's not important. Lets talk about right here, right now. 
Me: Well, you asked why I was rude to you, because I know what to expect now!
Him: I don't know how you were brought up, but you have no respect for people!
Me: That's fine if you believe that.

Then my manager steps in and has been trying to stop the fight this whole time. She keeps telling me to just let her handle it. We keep arguing. It gets pretty rediculous. I don't ever apologize to them. I wasn't even waiting on them. My boyfriend Ryan was. They tipped him .85cents and they got their whole meal comped. So in the 5 minutes that they took after they paid till they left, me Ryan, and the other co-worker, Matt...made SO MUCH NOISE up front. we turned the muzak all the way up, and kept dropping stuff like glasses and soup wells. It was priceless!!!

well, that's about it for the night. BYE!

***ASide from that, I have been trying to keep busy with Christmas shopping and Myspace.com. Yeah, I know, I'm a dork.

I bought my first Louis Vuitton Purse yesterday...and It was one of the happiest moments of my LIFE! Seriously, I've been wanting a mulitcolorue purse (white) for frekin every (ok, like a year and a half...maybe 2 years). This is exhilerating.

I had a Cheesy Holiday sweater party at my house on Friday. You all suck, because none of you were there...but it was good times. There weren't that many people there, but we suprisingly drank an entire keg. That has to say how drunk we all were. 

Then last night was the Marie Callenders X-mas party. Fun stuff. more drunk-ness...but that's me almost everyday, it's kind of sad actually. 

Oh well, I'll post more later...but I've really been on Myspace.com lately, and have been posting there. Check it out yo...

The old people at Marie Callendars love asking the young waitressed (like yours truely) if they are in school and what they are studying. Every time I get asked that, I make up a different story. One Time I am an anthropology major because I really want to work for the zoo, and the next I am an art history major...then other times I say that I am transfering to UCSD's dance program next semester. It all changes. There was this one girl that I worked with (who quit a couple months ago) got d$20.00 from a rich regular as a ""graduation present"" because she told them that she was graduating. I might just try that sometime...

Anywho, I have work on the brain because I have been there way to much this week. I just got home and am about ready to collapse.

Random question of the night:
What song should I sing for my Chorus Line Audition. I'm a alto/mezzo so nothing tooo high. I wanna be val (tits and ass) so maybe a song on the slutty side... 

Opinions? I am stumped."

"event","I finally got the internet after about a year of not having it.

YAY!

So, I'm trying to locate everyone's AIM address and everything. I remember about 3 people's AIM names...myself being one of them. 

The last year has been a whirlwind (in a good way). I moved out of my parents house last October, and I lived with three girls (My friend Heather being one of them, who lived with me for only about a month) and that living situation wasn't the best. They were messy and we didn't get along that great. Then my best friend, Ryan moved in with my friend Myles...and that was great, untill we got our fourth roomate...Justin...who was sloppy...18 and still in high school(...not that that's bad, but he was very immature) and hell to live with. Everyone eventually moved out of that house and I am now living with my boyfriend, Ryan...

...Ryan and I started dating last November, and things have not stopped being great. We live in this beautiful 5 bedroom house in PB/LaJolla. I am very much in love with him. We haven't spent a day apart since we got together. 

...I still work at Marie Callendars. I am a supervisor now, and I am still over-working myself, almost more than ever now. Waiting table 40 hours a week is pretty tough. Not to mention, most of our customers are old and grouchy. That's an excruciating combonation. 

...Still doing theatre, mostly at City College, because the rehearsal schedule is only 3 days a week, and I can easily work around my schedule. Last semester I did Wizard of Oz and I was ""Gloria""

SO, that's my last year in a nutshell. I'll post more later...BYE!

Yesterday I bought a brand new cell phone (nokia 6560...bomb ass phone!!!) It's little and silver and has a color screen and polyphonic ringtones. It's so exciting!

I also went to Fred's Mexican Cafe last night with some cool guys. I was all ready to use my ID (or marie's roomate's ID) and I wasn't asked for one in the end. I did get unintentionally pretty drunk though. I had to do Oedipus Rox/Amphibious Jamboree alst night and I felt my performance was enhanced by an abundance of alcohol. I think it should be tradition for the next 3 shows. 

SPEAKING OF WHICH...everyone should come see OEDIPUS ROX! and AMPHIBIOUS JAMBOREE (both musicals) at 6 @ Penn theatre in Hillcrest (on the corner of 6th ave. and Pennsylvania). 10:15 pm Friday and Saturday nights. 

After the show tonight, I am planning on going out and drinking with co-workers. That's always fun. 

I am watching Romy and Michelle's High school  reunion on ABC family, and this movie kicks ass! I forgot how much I like it. And even with a new face, SAndy still isn't hot...

Ok, well... I guess that's all. Peace out ya'll!

I moved out of my partents house this weekend and I'm now living in fashion valley with 3 other roomates.

The show I'm in, Amphibious jamborree opens this Saturday at 6 @ penn.

"event","I just woke up after getting home at 6 am after seeing Clue at Sins o The Flesh in LA. It was a good show. I would have to say my favorite part was the Mrs. White/que card part. The writer/director and Collen Camp (yvette) were there and had a question and answer forum afterward that was REALLY interesting. I'm glad I finally went up there to see Clue. Great job!

My problem is that I'm shy and don't talk to people I should, like people on my livejournal, because I have a fear that no one will recognize me (which no one does). 

In other events, I am trying to move out with Heather in about a month, and saving all my tips from work. I'm excited but I know that I'm gonna be burnt out from working soon. 

I am desperately trying to learn my lines for the show I'm in ""Amphibious Jamboree"" as well as ""Oedipus ROX!""  In A.J. I am a french 3-legged-frog who alternates every other word with my other head. It's fun stuff. In Oedepus, I play this rich bitch named Aspen who is trying out for Oedipus Rox! and I end up getting the part of Jocasta. Oedepus Rox! Is Jim's play that he wrote and is directing. It's frekin hilarous.

Oh, and by the way...Netflix DOESN'T have the movie ""The Apple"" and I am pissed!!! If anyone has a copy or knows where to get it, let me know. 

Thanks yo!

This week, I'm getting trained for server at Marie Callendars. Pretty soon, I'll be rollin in the big bucks. Hells yeah! The downfall, is this week, I'm working 6 days, and going to school 2 (for very long periods of time). Sucky!

The Rocky banquet was Sunday. Also good times. Everyone has to go see our show on Halloween. I'm going to be Janet at the midnight show, which makes me really happy. I'm also doing trixie at 9pm, and I'm going to do Goldilocks trixie (in my halloween costume). The cast for Halloween looks good. I'm excited about our shows. 

Side note: I won best breasts again this year. Oh hells yeah...


Anywho, I am lacking in sleep these days and am a walking zombie. I'm not loosing weight because I eat like shit and drink too much. Yet I am still in the gym 4 days a week and doing cardio (dance class) 2...yet no results, because I have no willpower (what can I say, I am around pie 30 hours a week!). 

Tonight is film class with Chris(saint02) and we'll be watching ""Out of Sight."" I'm excited because George Cloony is possibly one of the most beautiful men to walk this earth (speaking of which, I saw Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and the mustache he wore was kind of creepy). J-lo is in it, and I know everyone on my frieds list reading this is going to throw up when I say this, but I really like her...so I'm excited to see this movie. 

Oh yeah, like I said before, I have a really cute Goldilocks costume that cost too much money for halloween, so I need lots of use out of it, so if anyone knows of any halloween parties this season, tell me...so I can get use out of my costume...
yeah...

ok, well...That's all this month, I'll talk to ya'll later.

"event","Haven't been on the computer in a long time. I haven't had time to check my mail or update my LJ. 

Life has been really busy lately. Between School 2 days a week (all day long...8am-9pm) and work the other 4...Plus trying to fit in time at the gym and other things, I am physically exhausted. I was going into work today, and I guess someone read the schedule wrong and got there before me...so I got to go home... YAY! I am still going to be really busy though. 

Last Friday, Chris, Heather and I went up to Hollywood and saw a taping of ""A Minute With Stan Hooper""...One of my favorite actors/comedians...Fred Willard (Christopher Guest movies...That's RIIIGHT!) was in the show. I was so excited to see him. I was also excited about the L.A.M.B. Purse by Gwen Stephani  that I saw at the duty free store on Hollywood Blvd...and I said I would get one in San Diego. But no, when I got home, there were no Gwen Stephani purses in San Diego. So last wednesday, Heather and I drove back up to Hollywood and got my purse. Now I'm happy. 

Other than that exciting news, Jim is doing his play at 6-at-Penn with Nick in early November, and everyone should go see it. It's called Oedipus Rox! (Like Oedipus Rex...the rock opera, kind of like rent...) it's really funny. 

That's really all I have for now. Big Pie sale at Marie Callendars. I'm going to bring some pies to the banquet next Saturday, so if anyone has requests (other than chocolate satin), then just tell me. 

that is all...

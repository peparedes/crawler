The air is cold and thin
Thoughts are haunting me as I look around
This will never end and I'll bleed forever

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell is where I belong

<i>I've come so far - it's been so long</i>

Don't know why it started or where it came from

Outside shell is strong - confident
But slowly eats away
Like a man plagued with disease, I try to fight
Through my pores it seems to seep...
I'll bleed forever

And you sit there and do nothing
You're content with doing <b>nothing</b>

There's nowhere to run and hide
when you're living to die
Stuck alone inside your head,
<b>better off dead</b>
The phone would ring in the empty house,
no one's around.

But in my life, I wanted more, I needed more
I taste more"

"event","Two nights ago I was shot
A bullet sunk straight through my skull
A friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
No pain as I awoke, but dead
Seeing the face of the man
The time as he lays down his gun
I knew this was going to take place
White silence, so peaceful, so numb

No one knows the time they're changing
No one will see through:

You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my Mother shed tears
(and taste the blood she cries
and taste the blood she cries)

No:This gun has stopped time in its tracks
Has altered the course of my fate
Destiny is shattered and timeless
Closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace

I'll watch you call, calling for me,
you can't bring back time...
Close your eyes or look away,
fate exposed and won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
descending entity in me

My voice has been taken from me.
The more I listen, the more I have to say"

"event","nothing ever changes in this world
patterns form. 
we like to mix it up sometimes.
people die. 
new pieces are formed.
split in differnt directions.

<i>some of us can only follow orders.</i>

<b>WE ARE WEAKLINGS

POWERLESS</b>

new borders are formed
new laws are made
they are broken and torn down.
we rebuild
or is it nothing but distruction?

i find myself asking the same questions again.

what is my purpose?
what do i do next?
where is this taking me?

<i>no one seems to asnwer.</i>

do you have a cigiarette i can bum?
i can feel me growing towards cancer with every hit.

"event","Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray
It might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy
Wouldn't it be nice

You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice"

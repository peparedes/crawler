you'll be gone for years

to come back for days

to say hello to those you've left

and then to leave again

the pain is tremense

my heart is breaking

but i'll love you forever

i'll like you for always

and you amaze me

with every step

because you've succeeded

to a level beyond us

i love you Jem

"event","I've done so many horrible things in my life.  Things that I can never take back.  Things that have made me who I am.  I am a hypocrit so much that it almost makes me sick.  As of right now, I am finished with these stupid things.  These idiotic things that I do to make myself happy or to do things that you don't even wanna know about.  I am a horrible person and there is a side of me that only like...8 people know...and then there's another side of me linked to that side that everyone has always suspected about me but they're too immature to accept it (some of them are immature, not all of them ;-))...but still, it's pointless and I would never just tell the world my in-depth, deep, dark secrets.  But I'm finished with it all and if I ever do anything like that again, I give my best friends permission to seriously punch me.  Sometimes I really do think death is the only way out and although that is completely absurd and I've never commit suicide, I just don't know why it all goes out like it does.  So I pray for myself and for the world, that although I may do stupid things, I don't affect and destroy the lives of others.

P.S. Thanks to those 8, you mean more to me than you could ever imagine."

"event","So yes, I know that I haven't updated recently.  I've been finishing up my summer reading and writing my essays and getting all of that crap done.  I left work early today because I feel shitty and I feel like my heart is hurting?  So yeah, I hope that I'm not ""heart-broken"".  Haha, wow, I'm crazy like that.  Tomorrow I'm off and if I feel better tonight I'm gonna make plans for Kings Island tomorrow (maybe).  Otherwise, I think I'm just going to sit around and read some more.  Tonight, I'm going to continue my summer reading (I swear I'm going to have ""Follow The River"" done anytime now because it's such an amazing book).  So yes, if you would like to contact me tonight, I most likely will NOT be online.  I will be sitting in my bed (or lying down) reading my marvelous book that we have to read and I <u>want</u> to read.  Thanks again everyone, and have a great day.

"event","Ummm, yeah, I'm not gonna lie, I didn't feel like writing.  A lot has been happening over the past couple of days.  I spent sometime with friends and other time with family.  Other than that, it's all been fun.  WHAT A CUTIE THAT KID IS! (He is, oh he is!)

"event","So, today was a blast.  I loved spending time with Jessica while we were playing with little animals.  The service hours were a fun time too...but you know, I liked being with Jessica all the same.  Tonight, I'm going out with an old friend, Tina, and I guess we're going to have a blast :-).  I don't know, but I should be home from 10 or something.  Call/text me please.

"event","So, I'm waiting for Kristen to call me back.  Now we might not be able to go to the beach.  She forgot to tell her mom that we were going to go to service hours beforehand...my service hours...and how exciting it's going to be.  So I'm awaiting her call which will determine the outcome of the beginning of my day (pre-3 p.m.).

She just called.  She can go to service, not to East Fork.  I'm going to try someone else and see if they can go...but other than that I think that I'm just done for the day...ughhhh.

"event","Hahaha, this is interesting.  I'm not tired at all...I'm actually very excited about going to the lake.  So my mom doesn't want me to go straight to the lake at all...she actually doesn't want me going at all really.  I don't understand and none of this is fair to me.  I work...I do service hours...and a couple times a week I wanna do something fun (and this time actually school-related)...and neither of them want me to do it...whatever...call/text my cell phone if you have the number...today's going to be an exciting day.  (Can't wait to tan...and then...VIDEO GAMES!)

"event","Hey there people.  Umm...yeah, well, I wanted to really start my journal yesterday but that's okay, I don't mind that I started it today.  So, as I'm typing this, it's 2:33 a.m. and I'm about to go to the lake and stuff.  I'm going with Kristen and that's going to be a blast.  Then, I'm going to go to Erin's house and we're going to play ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" on her Nintendo Gamecube.  I'm very excited about this because I haven't seen Erin all summer.  As well, Kristen and I are going to be tanning on the beach and that's going to be AWESOME.  Wow, so I'm just going to head out.  I'm not going to bed tonight because I'm in the mood to pull an all-nighter, but yeah, if I decide to go to bed, remind me not to.

Later my little minions...

Oh yeah, Jessica and I are together again!  How exciting...we broke up 2 other times, but now, it's final.  We're back together :-)!

"event","My apologies for vanishing off the face of the earth, everyone... Lazer, Templeton and Ellis apparently decided I have the ""psionic flu"" or something. I got called into Lazer's office before combat practice, and they gave me some sort of drugs. Made me really sleepy. I think they did something to me while I was asleep, but I'm not sure what. All I know is that for a while I was feeling emotions a lot more keenly than usual. Feeling things floors and floors above. All over the place. They must have changed medications at some point... I definitely got overwhelmed by the bombardment of emotions at one point. I think I remember having some sort of siezure and trying to scream while laughing hysterically and sobbing at the same time. But it was distanced, almost. Then it all went away and there was a sort of numb time. Couldn't feel a thing. Couldn't even get myself to be worked up that they were experimenting on me again. Didn't want to do anything. Not even move or breathe. I don't remember much from that period of time. I don't know if it was minutes, hours, or days. I just remember coming to in my room this morning. Wrigley was there. Apparently I'm  not supposed to do much of anything for a few days. The doctors have drugged my empathy and telekenesis into oblivion for the moment while they figure out how to cure this flu thing. I'll be around, but I don't have a lot of energy, so mostly I'll be in my room. You know where to find me if you need me."

"event","Well, the stupid check up took all combat training, so I didn't get a chance to put my plan into action. What a lot of invasive ninnys. Poking and prodding where they don't belong, looking into everything and asking questions. Yet they still couldn't say anything was wrong after all of that. Missed my opportunity for the day. Ah well. It can wait. Plenty of time later. Extensions will serve as useful time for thinking up little finishing touches. Yet, add too many and it becomes over elaborate and useless. I'll have to find a balance between the two. All I can say is thank god for all the fantasy and science fiction I read before they blinded me."

"event","Goddamn stupid woman! She beats me up all week, yelling at me when she knows I hate that, intimidating me into corners for months on end, and then she gets pissed when I finally retaliate and score a hit on her?! So fucking <b>what</b> if I lashed out with my telekenesis instead of my damn fists? I <b>hit</b> her, didn't I? Sent her backward across the room, didn't I? What the hell more does she want from me? Bitch! I'll <b>kill</b> her for this. Just <b>see</b> if I won't. I know how to bring out my telekenesis when I want to now. I've never been able to grasp it before, but I can now. And. I. Will. Kill. Her."

"event","And people wonder why I crave the weekends. No classes. No getting beaten upon. Time for my bruises to begin healing. They won't be fully gone come Monday, they never are, but at least they'll get better. The books they're finding for me to read are getting progressively better as well. Easier to understand. And now they're actually letting me request some of my favorite fantasies! I can feel their distaste for the books, but as long as I read the ones <b>they</b> want me to read faster and more often than the books <b>I</b> want to read, they seem to be ok with it. I really should be more grateful for what they give me. It's really all for my own good, despite the wear and tear on my mind and body. There have been improvements. I'm just slower than others. But that's nothing to be ashamed of. I'll get there. Helps that I went to Dr. Stone and asked for a little bit of extra help with my shielding. She asked that we work with Dr. Ram as well, and I was a little apprehensive about it, but working in concert, it's really working well. I've been able to ward off a great deal more even with the little training I've had since the ninth. I'm almost interested to see how it'll help the next time someone has an emotional explosion nearby."

Well, I mostly controlled it. At least I only broke the chair. .... Someone will be angry with me for that. Shredded the hem of my shirt again too."

"event","I have never quite been able to get over the special equipment they give me because of my disability. The fact that I can hear what I've written when I'm finished and then have the computer correct it for me just astounds me. But that's rather beside the point of this.

I'm really growing to like Dr. Stone a great deal. She is always so kind to me, and I seem to do well in the class. I've come to look forward to Wednesdays, for the most part. It's just... Well... Ms. Contraente seems determined to make my life a living hell. I don't <b>want</b> to fight. I know it's part of her job, but I'm not very agile or terribly good at... what was it? ""Finding the sounds of your attacker through the muddle of other noises."" I always end up in so much pain after that class, and then I have to go through the rest of my day with sore spots. I'm sure they bruise. She scored well on my ribs earlier. Makes breathing too deeply painful. But other than that, I find myself yet again grateful for my good memorization skills. If I didn't, I'd have serious issues in math. Hard to do long division when you can't see it. Ah well.

Met the angry girl living in the room next to mine this afternoon. Apparently she's friends with the nice, cheerful boy, Josiah. She frightens me for some reason, but I like him. We'll see how this works out."

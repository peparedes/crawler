"event","Well, the time has finally come to take final exams. Luckily I only had 2 to take this semester, but there was oh so much more than that...

To start it off, this has been the most frustrating, emotionally draining, difficult, time-consuming semester of my life. Adult Health was the death of me. I had a teacher who is originally a graduate teacher and she is teaching us like we're graduate students. We have a HUGE textbook where we're expected to read almost 100-200 pages a night and then come into class having learned all the information. I think not. We also have quizzes every week on that information. Quizzes that are like mini final exams; they're so freaking hard. To top it off, we had one exam (last week I believe) that we had to take based on our ATI book (a book that helps prepare us for our NCLEX). Well, the deal was that if we didn't get a 50% or better on that test we don't pass this class. I also found out that this test wasn't a requirement last year and only 6 students passed. Awesome. It's not looking too great. Especially when our teacher did nothing to prepare us for this exam, except ""go study."" Great teaching. If we ever did anything badly, ""we didn't study enough."" She goes over facts so fast in class and usually doesn't repeat herself. We're supposed to have either already learned it from the book or write faster. Luckily I studied my ass off for that stupid test and was able to pass with a 61. Not great, but I passed and that's all that matters! haha It didn't help having this class and three others. This class took up 90% of my time. How is that fair? I want to be able to do well in my other classes too, but how can I if I don't have enough time to dedicate to it? 

Now I'm here procrastinating, as usual. I should be studying for this Adult Health final, but I'm just so ready to go home. I've been at the point where I don't care anymore and I just want to move on.

On another note...I'm going to be left all alone next semester. Two of my best friends will be leaving. Well, one of them left UNH for good and the other is going abroad for the semester. While he is over in London, he is going to look at colleges to transfer to. WTF. As much as I hate UNH and would LOVE to leave as well, I can't. Stupid nursing has done that to me. I'm already a junior and nursing credits most likely don't transfer between colleges so I'd have to start all over again as a freshman. Fuck that. So I'm ultimately stuck here. Shit. But yeah...I'm going to miss them sooo much! The people I could rely on and annoy. What am I going to do now? 

Buuuuuuuuuut, I'm really excited to go home. And that's the only thing that matters right now."

"event","Soo...as some of you may know I had a 6:45am flight out of Manchester on Wednesday morning to go home for break. (Keep in mind, I only got about 3hrs of sleep the night before). Tuesday was a pretty non-exciting day full of classes and waiting around. I was way too excited to fall asleep that night. Unfortunately around 1am, the sleep deprivation started to hit me. I thought to myself, maybe I'll just go to sleep for an hour or two. Set my alarm to wake me up around 3:30am, had everything ready and prepared for me to go. Bad idea Malia. I woke up to my phone ringing at 8am. Awesome. I totally missed my flight. Way to fucking go. As you can imagine, my parents were royally pissed. Told me I would have to stay in NH because it was the busiest travel day of the year and I probably wouldn't get any other flight out. Frantically I called Southwest millions of times in hopes of getting a later fligt. Luck was in my hands because I got a 6:45pm flight with only a $30 reschedule fee...niiiiiiice. So I didn't end up getting into Maryland until about 8:30pm. Sucks. 

Apparently Mark stopped by the house around 5pm earlier that day, only to find me not there lol. Luckily I got to see him later in the night. He picked me up and met up with some of our other friends at the pool hall and hung out for awhile. Eventually made it back to Mark's house for some shots of Grey Goose. Wow that shit really does a number on me lol. Mark was too plastered to drive me home, so I had to drive his stick car. I only stalled once!!! :) Then he slept and sobered up while I did laundry...at like 3am lol. We eventually woke up at 6am not realizing it...oops. 

Woke up the next day to drive 2hrs up to PA to visit with all my mom's side of the family. Got to see all my aunts, uncles, and cousins...whom I haven't seen in such a long time. It was great to catch up, but all I heard was the classic question OVER and OVER again...""how is school?"" I haven't been home in Maryland since July and all I've been doing is nursing shit, do you really think I want to talk about school? Not really lol. It's vacation...back off! lol But no harm no foul. In the end, it was fun. Playing with all the kids, great food with great company, and being thankful for the family that I have. 

It is now 12:15am and I am here, not being able to sleep once again, boored out of my mind. Luckily I brought my laptop and I can steal some wireless from the nextdoor neighbors because I'd be lost without the internet. Sad, I know lol. 

It's off to my dad's brother's house tomorrow/later today to visit with him, his wife and their two kids. Haven't seen them in about a year. Should be good to catch up once again. I should get my story straight now for the infamous question about school. Then we should be getting back to Maryland that night. Thank gawd. I havne't been able to hang out with any of my friends yet, especially Sierr'a. We neeeeeed our Applebee's night like woah! Hopefully Saturday afternoon or Sunday. 

Saturday is our yearly traditional party called ""Ghetto Thanksgiving"" started about 4 years ago when Mark and I started dating. It was called ghetto due to the mechanism of the party. We had traditional Thanksgiving dinner, though our turkey was kept warm by a foot heater. All the food was placed on TV dinner trays and we had some awesome paper plates, plastic cups and silverware. It was an amazing time though. Since then the tradition has carried on. I can't wait for the party this year. I haven't hardcore partied since August when I went to Quebec with some craazy girls :). Good times. 

That should be it for now. Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving!!! :)"

Sooooooo, it's the day I get to go home to Maryland for Thanksgiving break. It's almost the end of the Fall Semester of my Junior year here at UNH...kinda amazing, huh? Who knew I'd make it this far? 

Nursing has been kicking my ass lately. Med-Surg should be an entire year long instead of only a semester. There is so much content to learn in such a little amount of time. You have no idea how stressful this is. I hate that I'm on the verge of failing, once again. Only, this year I've been doing ALL the right things and I have been studying my ass off, trust me lol. I have no life outside of nursing and no friends outside of nursing friends. But it can't be just me? There is about 70% of the girls failing this class, so the teacher can't fail all of us, right? I never imagined nursing to be as hard as it is and I had sworn to myself that I would do so much better academically. Not taking into account Med-Surg, I am doing very well...passing with all B's, which is great for me. 

On a happier note, I at least have one boy who believes in me. My New Yorker will always be by myside and I love him dearly for that. He was just up here this past weekend to celebrate his 23rd birthday. We go on a NY trip with our dorm hall on December 2nd and I will get to see him again! :)

So basically I'm just wasting some time. I've been bored and haven't really been able to sleep. I am due to wake up in about 2 1/2 hrs in order to get ready to drive to the airport and catch my flight home. I'm excited and it's just starting to hit me now. 

I'm going to try and start writing in this thing again. We'll see how successful I am :)"

"event","So being part of CAB (Campus Activities Board) we are able to bring whomever we want to campus for pure entertainment. Yesterday (Friday) we brough Stevie Starr, The Human Regurgitator. This guy is CRAZY!! haha He was swallowing butane and spitting fire, swallowing soap and water in order to make bubbles, swallowing cigarette smoke and then putting that smoke into a soap bubble. Pretty incredible. He then went around the room looking for girls with rings on their fingers and swallowing them. Then all the girls that had their rings taken had to come onto to stage while he attempted to bring them back up. Of course I was the last one standing so apparently he was going to hypnotize me in order to get me to swallow the goldfish. YEAH RIGHT! haha All he got out of me was handing him the glass with the fish in it...lol. All in all, it was a pretty cool show to watch. The shit he was doing was just so amazing! haha That was at 9pm and lasted until about 10:15ish. Afterwards Marc and I went into Portsmouth and I hung out with him while he took some bulb exposures. We went down onto this little dock area and took one that had to last for 30 min!!! Of course he screwed that one up a couple times lol so we were there longer than expected. He only ended up taking 2 pictures that night cause it was taking so long. Ended up coming back to campus around 2:30am...lol.&nbsp;

Jess left me this&nbsp;very early morning. I was surprised that I didn't hear her at all lol. She's going to her grandfather's for a yard sale this weekend. Hmm...what else is going on today? I've got Relay for Life at 6pm that goes until 12pm on Sunday. Don't think I'm going to stay the entire time...that would be a VERY long night. Then I believe the rest of my weekend will be left for studying....since I've been left alone for the 2nd weekend in the row. Kinda sucks, but nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Can't wait for this summer. It should be amazing, except for the whole going to class part. Yeah, whoever invented the idea of summer classes was not a cool person. I don't know why I even signed up for it sometimes...it's either do that or be behind another semester. We shall see. But staying in Mexx's condo should be the amazing part of this summer, also Marc staying up here. We've already planned weekends at Cape Cod and at Rye to see him race. Hopefully working won't interfere too much lol.&nbsp; Well...it is almost 11am and I got up early this morning for having gone to bed at like 3am. Till next time :)"

"event","This weekend was amazing. Friday was spent working pretty much all day, which sucked. I got back to campus around 7pm and hung out and relaxed for awhile. Marc IMed and we went down to Main Street and ate at JP's Eatery. Had some buffalo wings. Weren't nearly as good as other places, but thats ok. We eventually got back to the dorm and went our separate ways in order to try and get some work done. Yeah, that didn't happen. Marc came down to my room and we manuevered the couch so it was infront of the TV, good call Marc. We watched 40 Year Old Virgin and watched all the out-takes, deleted scenes etc. We finally went to bed at like 12:30ish. 

The next day I slept in, got a shower and I was going to try and get work done, but that didn't work. I think Marc and I had lunch at the dining hall, but I can't remember. We then went on a mission to find the guy who was playing his drums soooo loud. It edned up being this random person in Devine who we didn't know. So we stood outside of his door just listening, looking like absolute freaks! lol Didn't stay too long cause we didn't want to look like we were stalking the guy and look like even more losers than we already are! lol Went back to our own rooms and ""did some work."" I believe Marc did work while I screwed around and watched TV all day. He IMed me later than day asking if I wanted to go out to dinner with him...yes of course! Mexx came along too and we all went to Friday's, apparently Marc's favorite restaurant. Got some good food, but no surprise birthdays today lol. Then we headed over to Portsmouth so Marc could take some bulb exposures for his photo class. That was fun. We walked the span of about 100 yards for an hour and a half just timing the pictures and talking. Ran into some nice cops and lots of people very interested in Marc's old school camera. It was fun. Took his camera stuff back the car and went back to Breaking New Grounds for some awesome coffee. We were originally going to meet up with one of Marc's friend to hang out at a party, but those plans fell through. We ended up hanging out at the Porstmouth Parking Garage at the very top level just taking pictures and talking. Then a rent-a-cop came along and spoiled our fun. Apparently we're not allowed to stand around looking sketchy up there...though it was like 12:30am. There was a sketchy guy though hanging on the other side in a dark spot smoking a bowl. What a cool kid. We decided to go to Mexx's condo from there. We ended up watching the rest of Jerry Maguire on TV and talking. Mexx and I tried to spike Marc's hair into a mohawk, but his was too short. It was late and I kept dosing off. Marc and Mexx thought it would be funny to tickle my feet and take pictures of me...thanks! lol We ended up talking a walk through the sketchy part of the old mill area in Newmarket. We found a bench and sat there and talked. Eventually made it back to the condo, mind you it was about 4am by then. Talked some more, I fell asleep some more and then Marc and I decided that we should probably head back to campus. Got in his car and made our way back around 4:45am. I was wide awake after my cat nap so Marc and I decided that we should watch the sunrise. We went to this little place off of 108 pas the Ocean Bank. It had a path that walked along this river and it was beautiful. Sunrise was around 5:30am. Got some good pics on my phone...poor Marc's phone was sucky. Sent him some of the pics. It ended up being really cold so we thought that we should go lol. Got back to campus and into bed at 6:15ish am.&nbsp;

What a great way to spend Easter weekend when nobody else is around. Campus was dead and the weather was beautiful! I will add pics later!!"

"event","So this has got to be the hardest semester of my life. I have dropped one of my classes so that I could focus on my nursing classes. So far all my teachers have been complete assholes. They tear us apart, telling us that if we don't know ALL this stuff we'll suck at life and be a horrible nurse. Great, thanks for the morale booster. All my classes are based on tests, which I can't seem to do well. I just don't know if I can do this shit. They make me feel like I can't do it. I want to be able to, but it's so hard. I hate it being so hard. What if I don't do well? What am I going to do with my life? I hate the uncertainty of things. I try so hard at studying and attempting to do well, but what if that's not enough? What if I do everything I can and it's just not good enough? I just don't know anymore. I hate my major and I hate college. Can I just go home? I just want Mark and I want him to stay home. My life just never goes the way I want it to, will it ever?

theshadowgirl08: you're amazing and you're going to be an amazing nurse. Mex, I love you for trying. Unfortunately, whether I pass my classes or not is the deciding factor."

<br />to genuinely connect with others, and need to
<br />be appreciated. They do everything with
<br />quality and are devoted and loyal friends and
<br />employers/employees. Whatever or whomever
<br />they commit to are their sole (and soul)
<br />focus. They love to serve and will give

<br />others lives.

BLUES, however, do need to be understood. They have
<br />distinct preferences and occasionally the
<br />somewhat controlling (but always fair)
<br />personality of a confident leader. Their code
<br />of ethics is remarkably strong and they
<br />expect others to live honest, committed lives

<br />moments in conversation as well as
<br />remembering special life events (i.e.,
<br />birthdays and anniversaries). BLUES are
<br />dependable, thoughtful, nurturing, and can
<br />also be self-righteous, a bit worry-prone,
<br />and emotionally intense. They are like
<br />sainted pit-bulls who never let go of

"event","I just got back from San Diego yesterday...ugh our plane didn't get into BWI until 12:45am. It was all worth it though. My mom and I left Thursday morning at like 4am to get to BWI for our 6am flight. We traveled with my om's friend/co-worker Fran who also brought her daughter Melissa, who was 16. So, I guess my mom thought that I would hang out with Melissa...gee thanks! She wasn't so bad, just the usual 16 year old. So we had a 6am flight into Chicago, which I slept the entire way through then one into San Diego. That was a long 4hr flight...luckily I brought my new laptop so Melissa and I watched Batman Begins. So we got into San Diego around 10am Western time...3 hour time difference is a killer. We had until 3pm for check-in at the hotel, so we decided to walk around, get some lunch, and then go whale watching!! OMG, it was sooo awesome. We were in the harbor and had to go out into the ocean and doing that was a feat in itself. The waves were HUGE! Luckily, nobody threw up. We saw about 4 different whales and their tails. That was about a 2-3hr. trip that took up the rest of our time. Our hotel was in La Jolla, just outside of San Diego. We had a beautiful hotel, 4 stars baby! I got my own queen bed and 4 pillows! Man was I in heaven! The rest of Thursday was spent unpacking, resting, getting some dinner, and chilling in the jacuzzi. The sunset was amazing. 

Friday Melissa and I were on our own. Mom and Fran had meetings ALL day long (the meetings is why we are here in the first place lol). Melissa and I decided to go kayaking to see the La Jolla Caves. Poor Melissa was afraid of the ocean (we didn't know we were going to be in the ocean) and fell off her kayak almost immediately. Didn't want to do it after that, but me and some other lady finally got her to try it again. Unfortunately, the waves were too rough for us to go in the caves, ugh! We did kayak throughout the ocean though, saw many dolphins and sea otters. They came up so close to us, almost touchable!! Spent about 2hrs. doing that and then had to go back to the hotel to change. We were dumb and didn't bring a change of clothes. I did have another shirt, but my shorts were the most wet. So we had the complimentary car from the hotel come pick us up, wait for us to change, and drove us back into La Jolla for some dinner and shopping. Lots of stores were having sales, so of course I had to buy some stuff! hehe :) Didn't put that much of a dent into my purse...only $50. We got dinner at an awesome sushi place and went back to the hotel around 6:30. We digested then put our suits on to go swimming. Swam some laps, stayed for a little while and then went our own ways. Mom and Fran had to go to a dinner with the meeting people, so we were stranded until 10pm. There were some good movies on, so that kept me entertained. 

Saturday mom and Fran had meetings all day until 3pm. I didn't wake up at 11:30 and kinda just screwed around until 12. Melissa and I went to the gym and worked out for awhile, then relaxed in the sauna. We wanted to sun-bathe for a little while, but unfortunately it was a really cloudy day. So we just decided to swim instead. Did that for awhile, then back to our room to change and find some food for lunch. We went down to the hotel restaurant and ate at the bar! :) Got back just in time to meet mom and Fran getting back from their meeting. Mom hiked around the hotel, since they had many trails surrounding their property, and I, being the lazy one, stayed in the room and watched movies. We went into San Diego for dinner in the Gaslamp District with one of my mom's doctors that she works with, Dr. Richard Shoan (pronounced sho-wan). So, Melissa and I as a joke, whose dick shoan? his!! lmao, get it? lol yes, elementary indeed. Anyways, this guy was such a weirdo!! First of all, he wanted to drive which was fine, but he couldn't find his car. Granted, we only had a 2 level garage for the cars and there were NOT that many people's cars parked there to begin with. He's walking EVERYWHERE pressing the alarm button for the car. How can someone not remember what their car looks like!? I mean, you just have to see this guy in person and you'd realize how odd he is. He is a very up in your face kind of guy. Doesn't understand the personal bubble thing. He ALWAYS needs approval with every little thing he does. And, with all the amazing dinner choices, he wants to eat at a pizza place. Of course my mom and Fran won't say anything...ugh! Anyways, finally got dinner out of the way and headed back to the hotel. I was pooped and so was mom, so we put the TV on and instantly fell asleep. 

Sunday was the day to go home. We got up early and packed away everything. Checked out and headed into San Diego. We went through Old Town and a little bit of Balboa State Park. We eventually headed back to the Gaslamp district whee all the good stores and restaurants are. We did some more shopping and got some McDonalds for the flight home. Our plane left at 3:30pm, got into Atlanta, and then headed back to BWI. For some reason, I didn't sleep at all on the ride home. I usually fall right alseep, but not this time. Of course, when I got home I couldn't fall asleep either. I was up watching Dodgeball until 3am. 

This morning I didn't wake up until 1pm. It was a good catch-up sleep. One more week until I have to head back to UNH. I can't believe it. This break has gone by sooooooooooo fast. Mike and Brian are already down in FL enjoying the warm weather. I'm going to miss them!! I really wish I could go down during spring break to visit...ugh! I wish I were rich! lol Anyways, that should be plenty to read until next time."

"event","Wow, I can't remember the last time I updated this thing. I'm too much of a stalker and just read everyone else's posts! hehe Anyways, I can't believe it's 2006 already...that means I have 2 more years left at UNH and then graduation!!! How amazing is that!? So let's see...New Year's Eve was fun. I had my annual party with my friends, this year at his apartment and no adult supervision! haha We played many rounds of kings and got more drunk that I have been since last year I believe. At the stroke of 12, we all went outside and fired fireworks and had an applausive audience. Everyone started passing out after that! haha We all went to sleep around 2am. I didn't intend to sleep there that night because I prefer my own bed. Mark told me we'd leave around 3am. We fell asleep and woke up around 4am, haha! Left after that and went back to my house ;). You don't need to know the rest. 

It was a good night. Now, 2005 in review. It was a very good year. I wasn't stuck with just 2 people that I mainly hung out with and because of Lauren, I made soo many new friends. Mike and I had our 2am walks talking nonsense. We ate our meals at the dining hall and ended up staying there for over and hour just talking. Oh so many movie nights and one in particular about exhibitionism, but I won't go into detail about that. Sooo many room changes and finally, stalking my favorite person, P@ aka Steve. After such a good year together, they're leaving us. Brian and Mike are going to Disney for an internship for the entire semester. Sooo jealous!! Lauren and I planned to visit them over spring break. While talking the plans over with my mom, I realized that this is going to be a VERY expensive trip for only 3 days and I'm not going to be able to afford it :(. It's going to cost me well over $500 for flights, hotels, park passes, food, etc. I don't have that kind of money and, unfortunately, my parents aren't willing to shell that kind of money out. I'm really sorry Mike. I left Lauren a message on IM, but she still hasn't gotten back to me. I feel REALLY bad. 

So, another year started off the right way ;). I am scared to go back to school. I have so much riding on this upcoming semester, career wise. I'm being thrown into a hospital setting to ""see what I can do."" This is going to be a whole new experience. I can't wait!! :)

p.s. i'm getting a new laptop!!! (for those of you who really know me, NO MORE LOUD FAN NOISE!!)"

"event","Yes Mike, I stole your subject line just because I found it THAT interesting! lol Well, I can't even remember the last time I REALLY updated. So why should I start now? I have a paper I need to write, so this seems like a perfect time. I don't even know why I'm doing this because I have probably the WORSE memory ever and can't remember anything, lol. Worthless, I know! haha 

Let's see. We'll start with my long weekend last weekend. Went down to Reading, MA with Lauren and hung out there. Left Thursday night after my microbes lab and stayed until Saturday afternoon. We went out to lunch at Applebee's and paid a visit to Jordan's Furniture Store. All I can say about that is WOW! That store is fucking amazing! haha Its sooooooooooooooo big! We literally sat in the massage chairs for like 30 minutes. People started looking at us! haha Oh well, it was awesome. Then we went to CVS because apparently one of Lauren's friends can't go there without Lauren. So that was a ""CVS Adventure."" Eventually got back to her house for pizza night with her family and Jenn. After that we saw the movie, Waiting. I thought it was hilarious. Lauren didn't enjoy it was much, unfortunately. It was definitely a Malia movie! hehe Went back to Lauren's house and just hung out. I left Saturday afternoon and got back to campus to relax. 

Saturday night and old friend called and we hung out. He lives in Portsmouth but has been going to school in Nashua. He was home for the weekend so I chilled at his place with his brother and sister. That was fun. We definitely watched Pretty Woman!!! Got back to the room around 2am, lol. 

Sunday I pretty much slept all day. I was talking to my friend Rob online who lived in Brockton, MA and we've been trying to visit, but timing was terrible. He was free so I drove down and hung out with him for the day. Unfortunately, he didn't have a holiday Monday so he had work at 4am...poor baby. I left his house around 11pm and got back to campus in decent time. 

Once again, slept most of the day Monday. Lauren came back and we caught up. Jess eventually came back. I can't remember what else we did, haha. 

Hmmm, Tuesday followed a Monday schedule, which was awesome. Definitely got to sleep in that day. Had my usual classes and then JASON MRAZ!!!!!!!!!! He played at the Field House that night. He had 2 really good openers. One was an emo type band and the other guy was Raul. Definitely reminded me of Stevie Wonder, whom he suppposedly sang a song with. He was pretty cool though. I enjoyed it. Then Jason came on the stage. OMG, soooooooooo much cuter in person! haha He put on a great show. He definitely worked with the crowd and made things interesting. Though I didn't know most of the songs, it didn't matter. I loved his voice, lol. After standing on my feeet for FOREVER, we got back to the dorm and hung out for the rest of the night. 

The rest of the week went by pretty fast. Finally Friday was here, but I still had to work. Got out around 3:30 and went back to the dorm. It was Homecoming weekend and I opted to help out with it for CAB (Campus Activities Board). So our annual parade was Friday night. We went out to Q lot to help out and what happens when we get there? IT RAINS! AND IT DOESN'T STOP!!!! It only started raining harder. Man, did that suck!! Fortunately, we (Brian and Mike were there) made the best of it. It turned  out to be so much more fun than I thought. I really loved running down Main Street handing out flags. The parade ended at A lot and then we had to make the trek back. Got back to the dorm and took a nice, long hot shower! Put some warm clothes on and headed back out. We had to go to the MUB and help out with the pep rally. Well, once the football team left, so did everyone else. Kind of sucked. We had a DJ, pumpkin painting, and loads of inflatables. It was a fun time. There was at least a little bit of turn out. We ended up ditching CAB and meeting up with Lauren and Jenn to see Wedding Crashers. Lauren, Jenn, and Mike didn't want to sit with us, so Brian and I got good seats by ourselves! lol That wasn't over till late, around 11:30ish. We were all wicked tired. I eventually went to bed around 1am. 

Saturday I woke up refreshed. Slept till 12:30 and then got some brunch with Mike, Lauren and Jenn. Came back and just hung around until Lauren's brother Jason and his wife Denise got here. They were sooo cute! We went out to dinner (me, lauren and jenn) with them at Olive Garden. I actually got something different, for once. I had lasagna, which was amazing. Of course, after the salad and bread sticks, I couldn't finish it. Got back to the dorm and then those guys went off to Dane Cook. He's not my type of comedian. Didn't find him as hilarious as everyone else. Oh well, it was cool. I stayed here and enjoyed some alone time! :) Watched a movie and got into comfy clothes. Everyone got back around 10ish. Jason and Denise left after that. We decided we needed a snack so we went to Panache and ran into Mike there. We got some desert and hung out there for awhile talking about some, umm very interesting things. I will not share on this, lol. People were definitely giving us dirty looks and looking at us like we were crazy. I can't blame them, haha! Got back to the room and Mike hung out. We ended up playing Cranium Conga and Tribond. Finished around 1:30am and I wanted to take a walk, yes a walk! lol We got to about Main Street and Lauren and Jenn backed out. What poops! lol So Mike and I went out on our adventure. Went through campus and down Frat Row and laughed at all the drunk people. Eventually made it back to the room around 2:30ish. Lauren and Jenn were still awake when I got back and we had some more girl talk. Finally got to sleep around 3:30am. This can't be good for me! lol 

And today, Sunday, woke up again around 12:30. Got some brunch with Lauren and Jenn. Then Lauren says she is going home. So I'm left here by myself. Don't know when Jess is going to be back, or if. Who knows with her! So, I guess that's enough procrastination for now. I've already played countless games online and watched Cinderella! hehe I will try and update more often, but can't guarantee anything! lol"

You fall in love quickly and easily. And very often.

In relationships, you tend to be a bit selfish.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>"

True Story. A religion teacher assigned her class an essay on what makes a good Christian. One student wrote about talking to God and allowing people to enjoy their lives, and supporting gay marriage. The day the teacher was to hand the papers back, she called up the student and told him she would pray for him when he went to hell. The student asked why would he be going to hell, and why he got an F on his paper. The teacher told him that Catholicism is against gay marriage. The student looked at her for a minute, then said aloud, ""I'm gay."" The teacher kicked him out of class as if he had said 'fuck' or admitted to worshipping Satan. A girl in the back of class who had a boyfriend and was obviously straight got up and left too.

If you would leave the classroom, repost this. It doesn't matter if you're straight, bi, or gay. It doesn't matter if you're Catholic or not. Everyone is a human being and deserves happiness.

"event","So my parents left Saturday afternoon for Panama for 11 days! Every girl's dream, right? Not mine. Once my parents left, my brother decides he wants to start coming here again after work. WHAT THE F*CK!? He has his own house, but he comes over here, takes a 30 min. shower, leaves the bathroom absolutely disgusting, and smells up the entire house with his stench. He also decides to invite people over to ""hang out"" and invites the one girl my parents absolutely hate. I leave for the next two nights and lock my door. When I come back, I find my door unlocked. He has no f*cking right to anything in my room. So far nothing obvious is missing, but who knows? I can't stand being around him. I can't stand the presence of him. Can't I just have some peace and quiet to myself? Why can't I also enjoy the freedom of having the house to myself? Why does he have to be in my life? I really do hate him. I hate the person he is. 

I'm just going to cry myself to sleep and hopefully everything will just disappear."

"event","Since I've got nothing else to do, why not update? It's 4th of July weekend and I'm stuck home, alone. Parents decided to go to my grandma's house up in Jersey Friday afternoon, without me. I work on Friday, every Friday and I had a TB test Saturday morning. SO their idea was to leave early and I can drive up Saturday after my test. Yeah right! Definitely not in the mood to drive that long drive, by myself just to be greeted with shit weather. Not worth it. So now I'm here, pigging out to chinese food and movies. It's been an exciting day, haha! 

Hmmm, what have I been doing this summer? I started work last week. Not too bad. I'm working 38hrs a week and the pay is pretty nice. I work at a cooking camp at a local community college, so basically I'm being paid to eat. Sweet deal, huh? haha Unfortunately, I deal with whinny kids and I'm doing this Mon-Fri until the 2nd week of August!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

So besides work, I've been doing nothing really. I come home, take a run, get a shower, and I'm in bed around 10pm. Pretty sad. It just sucks because I've got to be  out of bed and out of the house by 7am!! Preparing me for school, haha! 

Ummm, this is gonna be short. I don't feel like writing anything else. Adois!"

"event","So yeah...I haven't updated in AGES!! I apologize profusely. My summer has been pretty boring since I've left school. I've hung out with my friends from home, stayed awake till dawn and slept all day. Not very productive, I know. 

My summer vacation got interesting when I came up to Jersey to hang out with Piglet and Mexxy!! Driving up to Mexxy's house was a bitch (MAPQUEST SUCKS MONKEY BALLS!!!!!!!!!!!) I eventually made it to her house. OMG her house is amazing. It's just so beautiful. There's a lovely backyard with a tennis court and an inground pool. We had fun last night making a synchronized swimming routine around 1am. Wow we are awesome people with soooo much time on our hands. We've been staying up till 4am and waking up at 3pm to start our lovely day. We also got to hang out with Zaccy. We were down in his studio last night jamming to random songs. Definitely blew a cable with the loundness. GO us!! Tonight we traveled into NYC to see WICKED!! Wow!!!!!! What an amazing show! I absolutely loved it...it was so cleverly done. I was absolutely stunned. The girl playing the Wicked Witch of the West had one of the best voices I've ever heard. It sent chills up and down my body. Now we're just hanging here. I have to go home tomorrow....boohoo. Not looking forward to the drive home AND work on Monday!! UGH!!! That's going to suck because I have to wake up at an ungodly hour of 6am. 

So yeah...don't really feel like writing anymore. Just thought I'd update for once, haha. Most likely one of around 2 entries for this summer. Till next time!! ;)"

"event","i'm here in playa del carmen. in a few short moments I'll be traveling to Tulum, my final destination. it's hot here, really hot, and the humidity adds only fuel to the fire (pun and imagery intended). i had some ceviche last night made from fish and octopus, which I like to call 'rocktopus', and a few beers. i'm lucky enough here to have a fair amount of internet, but i doubt that will continue. 
i'll update when things warrant updating.

"event","Come day, go day
Wish in my heart it were Sunday
Drinking buttermilk thru the week
Whiskey on a Sunday

He sits in the corner of Bevvington Bush
On top of an old packing case
he has three wooden dolls that can dance and can sing
And he croons with a smile on his face

His tired old hands tug away at the strings
And the puppets dance up and down
A far better show than you ever would see
In the fanciest theatre in town

And sad to relate that old Seth Davy died
In 1904
The three wooden doll in the dustbin were laid
His song will be heard nevermore

But some stormy night when you're passing that way
And the wind's blowing up from the sea
You'll still hear the song of old Seth Davy
As he croons to his dancing dolls three"

"event","We broke through the barriers of common decency and decided instead of the myriad of other things to do on a a saturday night, to take our funny little hobby out of doors and into the pubs. Thats right, we built model airplanes at the pub! The toxic fumes were a little noxious at first but people became accustomed to them, or should I say, left the direct vicinity. 
Ok, we didn't build model airplanes but we did play card games. We got a table at Murphys on 45th up the street from the Dicks resturant. We chose it because regardless of coming there, we've never encountered any stern resistance in the form of over-patronage, if such a word exists. We, and by we I should elaborate, were Chris and I, Beau, and his friend-girlfriend. We got a table, got a pitcher of yellow beer and tore the norms asunder with a rousing game of cribbage. Yeehaw! We then played the following games, in order: Gloom (supernerdgame, very fun, was the actual impetus for the evening at the pubs), Lunch Money (a classic school yard fight, also nerd game), a little poker/blackjack, a little classic called 13, and we ended the night with a delicious sundae of Hearts. Over all we had three pitchers, several, but not in the hyperbolic sense, laughs and many a mean-spirited back-stabbing passive-aggressive slights in each hand we played. We shall repeat, although now we'll be needing a fourth member, so if this sounds like your cup of tea, please RSVP.

"event","this catch-22 world has become much more polarizing. We've become much more apt to suscept to paranoia, I would say more than in the past, but it seems as though everything from world war 2 on has been a product of fear induced/inducing policy. It's easy from where we sit to look at it and say 'ridiculous' but to those who actually believe it, beyond the corporate sponsersihp, it seems completely legit. In fact, those that would preach this ideology would be remissed not to try and force their view upon the world. The sad fact of all of this is that Republican or Democrat no one is intentionally wrong. Everyone has an aim, I hope that the aim is harmony and security, peace and freedom; it is only the methods in which we have differences. This isn't the movies, despite how completely irrational we think the government is at times, they don't congregate in smokey board rooms and clutch their hands over their hearts and laugh boisteriously in unison, it doesn't happen. Some would call me niave, that's ok, it may be what they are doing, I just don't see them gaining anything from it."

Peanuts and lions circle round,

can't sit still--ants in my pants.

You have no idea how bland it seems,
to be without your own trapeez.
No net, no crowd--just organs ground
and me left swinging round and round.

I speak and shout and turn about,
and at all times I'm wigging out.

Go ahead, sit and stare
now I'll fight this polar bear.
I'll make roller skates out of these crocs,
and then I'll piss the lion off.

"event","I just came out of one of the most ridiculous 3 days of my life. Dogs, booze, and smokes. I have never felt as bad as I feel right now. I don't know what happened, I drank more than I've ever drank before in my life. I bought a soccer jersey for a dog to wear. I fell asleep in the median of a busy street. I paid a taxi driver 20 dollars to drive me three blocks. I don't remember the last time I've eaten or drank water. I miss the hell out of Sarah. I feel like the only thing left to do is to cap myself and ask God for forgiveness. Aye Caray! Aye dios Mio! 
It's really not that bad, I'm just sad and sober and would give every waking moment from here till death to see Sarah if only for a minute. 
I'm sure you can understand.

Here is what I've been saying for the last three days:

"event","fuck man, the waiting is the worse. I'm high off of red wine and I wish I was in Chile already. I've been saying goodbye to those I care about for weeks it seems. I just wish I was leaving tommorow. I'm high off of red wine and I don't know up from down. I want to get to Seattle and run rampant. but...

I hear the train a comin'
it's rolling round the bend
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
but that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Anton..
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
now every time I hear that whistle I hang my head and cry..

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
but those people keep a movin'
and that's what tortures me...

Well if they'd free me from this prison,
if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move just a little further down the line
far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
and I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away....."

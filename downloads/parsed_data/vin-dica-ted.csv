"event","so living with my boyfriend has proven difficult. we get in all these stupid fights about stupid stuff, but in the end all we need is space. i hope... he just left because he thought dinner would be done before he got home. houseWIFE much?? minus the wife part. 

oh yah if i have failed to mention, me and nico are living with each other at ashleys. ashley and shae are over. nico and paintball are over. 

work is going good, although now i'm not getting as many hours as i'd like. but cant complain, i'm getting through it.

so all that's going on right now is me, trying to figure myself out while settling down with my boyfriends, which like i said has proven difficult. well, it hasn't been as difficult as i expected, but when it is difficult, its VERY difficult. i just wanna prove everyone wrong about us moving in with each other. everyone has told me that we are going to burn and fall apart, but i have kept my ground and disagreed  with all of them. i love this guy, so much, it's incredible! naive?

so wish me, us, the best of luck. 

i'm going to try to keep this posted, it help with my nerves."

well on friday i got invited out a number of places, but i said no for some odd reason.
jordan invited me to go to JB- never ended up happening
then to the beach to meet up with like dars and her ppl that she partys with- but that would have been really akward cuz like i know any of her olderish friends, but then i found out that jordan and carlos never ended up meeting up with her because she took to long, so i should have gone. meh w/e i was so effin lazy.
so instead i layed around at home, kk came for a bit and goined me.
then we went for a little walk, and layed some more, then i told her to go home so i could sleep.
lol
saturday i went to kk's dads with her n mel.
her step mom made us some hoem made coolers :S weird.
and her dad made us up and orang juice and vodka drink.
i snooped through codys old room which still had alot of stuff in it.
uhm, talked to nate and chris, then jordan then nick until 5.
went to bed.
sunday, woke up at like 11.
went to the lake, avec kk n melissa
we played around like cool kids.

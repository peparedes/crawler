I stood under ohio's skies
I could see the open fields for miles
I thought ""what the hell am I doing back here again?""
but now I'm trying to reassemble the things I kept and
the pictures fade but I hope to resurrect
the things that kept me sane back then

in the backyard playing on the swingset
dark green shoes off you can get your feet wet
mom and dad sat quiet in the sunroom
sundown, big moon, big sky.

now I just want to live a normal life
get a fast car and a pretty wife
we could have children of our own
settle down here until they're grown
we could buy a house out on the beach
and just die there, out of reach
do you want to live
do you want to live
do you want to live a normal life with me

live
a normal life with me

for years I cursed these dead end streets
no where to go, no one to meet
we only talked about the crazy woman down the road
but everything makes much more sense now
someday I'll have my own house
I'll make enough to make it easier to pay the phone bill

in the backyard playing on the swingset
dark green shoes off you can get your feet wet
my wife and i will sit quiet in the sunroom

do you want to live

do you want to live a normal life

I'll watch the kids until you get home
4:58 and you're on the phone
coming back from work on friday
wide-awake in the american dream
I'll make the bed, you feed the cat
could it really be as simple as that? (yeah)
do you want to live

<i>""When I wake up alone, the shades are still<br>drawn on the cold window pane so they cast<br>their lines on my bed and lines on my<br>face.""</i>

The Solitary Rose is associated with loneliness,<br>melancholy, and patience.  It is governed by<br>the goddess Merope and its sign is The Sword,<br>or Unrequited Love.

As a Solitary Rose, you may be summed up as a<br>hopeless romantic.  You desire love and have so<br>much love to give, but thing just never seem to<br>work out the way you want them to.  In life,<br>you can be very optomistic, even when things<br>are gray and nothing works out to your<br>expectations.

Where I'm insignificant to the universe

And the dreams become the only thing you can feel

You go numb eventually if you don't get over it
Its not all that bad cause you feel nothing at all

I can't cure a broken heart but that what comes next

A girl that knows when she dies her pain will live on
Throw her spirit and her soul that will never be aloud a peaceful sleep
A girls who's heart is black from the pain she once numbed out

 So whats it like laying beside a girl who finds peace in solitude?
A girl who prefers the company of herself because of what they once did to her
Although her sleep is not peaceful she carries on
A girl who's cat is her only friend cause she blocked everyone else out

So whats it like laying beside a girl who will never die?
Though her body may grow old and wrinkle, she was sentenced to an eternity
A girl who was born into a peaceful family but was old enough to watch it die
So what it like laying beside me, A girl just doing her time while she waits to be freed?"

He got a little jealous, he said..and then asked me what I was hiding. 2 times. I thought it was flattering. Anyway while I was talking to him Jeff came up and told me there was another beer for me and tried to feel me up again I shuck him off. This time I was wise enough to not tell Matty. 

Matty had been drinking. he said he ""got into the sauce"". It was cute. He doesn't change a bit when hes been drinking. Hes calling me luv. He ask what we were gonna do while he was here. I really have no idea. We're kind stuck in the middle of nowhere and neither of us drive. I like Matty a lot but it would be kinda hard to have a real relationship cause of the distance between us.

A pair of tan pants for the dress code at the high school I'm going too, and a dark blue t-shirt also for the dress code. I also bought 2 cd's: Thrice and 3 days grace. I'm gonna look cute wear the same thing 5 days a week for the first month, then I can buy something new. But I don't really see the point of buy to much clothes That I'm only gonna wear for 5 months.

I decide what I want to do with my life. I'll talk to the quite high schools couclier to see how to do it. Its not very luckily that it will happen, but with the business adminataion class I was think on what kinda business I like to own. I want to own and run a recoding studio. I'll put it in the basement of my house. So I'm gonna need a big house. with a sound prof basement. It would be more of a hobby. Cause I can see making o much money out of it. The aqetment will cost a arm and a leg. Maybe I'll take an 2 OAC classes next semester just to look good at the colleges. I hope I'm smart enough!!!

The first thing he said was, ""you have a nice voice"". He said he was gonna call again. He has a body suit of tattoos.

Dan said a few things last night. I don't know if hes for real or not. I asked him to tell me something new hes said ... ""I want to marry you. Oh wait that not new"". He also went to bed then came back. We alway joke about how hes gonna kidnap me. Then he said he Luv's me. He caught me of gard. so It took me a few minutes to reply... I remember thinking the night before ""I could so easily fall in Luv with him"". I said ""think I luv you too"". Either, I'm really stupid and and hes really cruel. Or I'm blind and he really in Luv. I'm scared to just give in. I'm really damaged, from past relationships. But I really can picture my self curling up in his arms every morning, for the rest of my life. It feels really nice to be talking to him again. I geuss only time will sort this one out for me."

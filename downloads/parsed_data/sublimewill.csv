Yeah, I caved and watched it.

It sucked as much as I guessed it would.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it...


Is there a word or right to say
Even in this old fashioned way?
Go make your move, girl
I'm not coming home

Would things have changed if I could've stayed?
Would you have loved me either way?
Dressed to the blues.
Day to day with my collar up.

Decision sits so make it quick
A breath inhaled from an air so sick
I cursed the day I had learned
Of the web you spun...
You had your hold till bleeding

Hey, Hey!
If it was up to me
I would've figured you out
Way before the year clocked out
Oh, I hope you're waiting

Hey, Hey!
If it was up to me
I would've never walked out
So until the sun burns out
Oh, I hope you're waiting

Would we have lived as a child would care?
With this vial to drink I dare
(Oh where have you been, oh where have you been)
Only to cry all alone with your taste on tongue
(Oh where have you been if it hurts to be forgiving? Bye)

Should we try this again with hope? (Bye, bye)
Or is it lost, give up the ghost
And should I die all alone as I knew I would...
Then burn in hell young sinner

Hey, Hey!
If it was up to me
I would've figured you out
Way before the year clocked out
Oh, I hope you're waiting
Oh, I hope you're waiting

Now listen well... will you marry me?
Not now, Boy
Are you well in the Suffering?
You've been the most gracious of hosts
You may be invited, girl, but you're not coming in

Listen well... will you marry me?
Not now, Boy
Are you well in the Suffering?

"event","I just watched an interview with the President of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, who's elderly mother drowned in her nursing home. She called him every day, asking when someone was going to come save her, and everyday he reassured her (just as he was reassured by his superiors) that someone would be there to save her the next day.

She went the whole week without being saved and drowned in her nursing home Friday night.

He broke down on TV.

He cried his eyes out.

He was more than critical of the inaction in the wake of the storm.


On top of that, I just read an article that was published in the Times-Picayune more than four years ago which predicted this entire scenario down to the last detail.

http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf?/washingaway/thebigone_1.html

Four years worth of warning.

Four years of inaction.

An estimated 10,000 dead.

How utterly fucking disgusting.


I am so greatful that those I love that are from New Orleans are allright.

I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.


To those that read this:
Please visit http://www.redcross.org/ or call 1(800)HELP-NOW and help those less fortunate than yourselves.

I am going to go say a prayer.
You should too."

But catch the bitch all alone get the digit take her out
and then dump-hittin' the ass with the meat
Cuz gangsta-ass niggas be the gang playas
And everythings quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't tellin' off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All ya hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit
Hit the pen and let the mothafuckas shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
Cuz damn it feels good to be a gangsta

And now, a word from the President!
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Gettin voted into the White House
Everything lookin good to the people of the world
But the Mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor gettin' down
like lettin' a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supportin' me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans, that helped me win
I sincerely like to thank you
Cuz now I got the world swingin' from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta"

for the corpses of all my past mistakes
sell me out- the jokes on you
we are salt- you are the wound
empty another bottle

this is me wishing you
into the worst situations
i'm the kind of kid
that can't let anything go
but you wouldn't know a good thing
if it came up and slit your throat

your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears
rather ones that just don't care
because i know
that you're in between arms somewhere
next to heartbeats
where you shouldn't dare sleep
I'll teach you a lesson
for keeping secrets from me

peel back your skin
and try to forget how it feels inside
you should try saying no once in a while
oh once in while

take your taste back
peel back your skin
and try to forget how it feels inside
you should try saying no once in a while
oh once in while

and did you hear the news?
i could dissect you
and gut you on this stage
not as elequent as i may have imagined
but it will get the job done (you're done)
every line is plotted and designed
to leave you standing
on your bedroom window's ledge
and everyone else that it hits
that it gets to
is nothing more than collateral damage

""she's just like your mother""... the funny thing is, not long after i started dating her, i started having these attacks that would cause my body to almost shut down and i had to be medicated to counter them. i haven't had one since i got rid of her. to my friends that wouldn't come around thanks to the nutty ball-and-chain... i'm sorry. i'm really genuinely sorry that i didn't listen to you and i'm sorry that i've been sort of gone... i'm back guys..."

"event","Once in a while I have these moments that can only be described as mental health. 

I don't grieve for the coping mechanisms I have left behind. I don't feel the need to feel pain or feel nothing. I realise that life is out there, offering happiness and joy and pure, simple love, and I can't ignore those things. I can evern-- gulp-- want them and cherish them and deserve them.

And in these moments, things are OK.  There's some calm and peace I had previously almost forgotten about. 

There's that bit in the bible about Paul saying when he was a child, he acted like a child and so forth and sometimes I look at my life and say, ""Ok, enough now."" 

I suppose my current reading selection has something to do with this. Sometimes people with minds like mine need time to figure things out and that figurnig out isn't an easy process- in fact, it's downright mesy, sneaky, unhealthy... and then in the end, you look at yourself and go, ""Fuck it. THere's no making mesomething I'm not. And what I am doesn't call for lament, hiding, silencing, guilt. It's pretty good. I deserve better.""

And I like it."

It's 2:30 in the morning. I shuold be sleeping.

I had a really bad, macabre nightmare and now I'm bolt awake. And still shaking. Steve woke up for about ten seconds then went back to snoring. I came down to watch telly and maybe talk to my mum for a second."

"event","Summary of 2005:
Yeah, you've probably seen this all over the place already. What you do is go to the first post of every month and post the first line.
Here we go:

January: 
Happy New Year to you all..


February: 
So sorry it's been so long.


March:
I'm in the mood to write. Sorry if it's boring, as therapeutic sometimes is.

April:
I haven't forgotten about this.

May:
Grrr. Stupid LJ ate a really good entry about what I like about myself and my life and recovery. Anyhow, whatever.

June:
So, we booked our travel for July.

July:
Where's md? Where? Why? I want it back.


August:
I don't know what's going on, but I'm a little fragile at the moment.


September:
I fucking hate my job.

October:
1.If you have an invite and you're coming to the wedding, but haven't RSVP'd yet, please let me know, and if you're not coming, and could please let me know, that'd be useful, thanks!


November:
Is it sad that I'm 25 and I don't know what I want to do with my life, apart from be steve's wife and a mummy?

December:
New house, new house!! WHEEEEE!!!! SO excited!"

I'm very excited about this, after months of trying and rejection... it's a very good feeling indeed.

It's teaching preschool in a nursery I really love. They're going to fast-track me to an NVQ3 and make me a room manager right away. This means I get flexibility to plan lessons and activities, and arrange the room how I like. I'm thrilled. All the things I miss about kindergarten-- I get to do them again. It's wonderful.

I need a car. I want an automatic, though, as I am already crap at driving. I'll even settle for a flappy-paddle type thingy. I don't care, I just needw wheels. And black trousers. Heheh.

I'm considering a paid account, but I'm not sure if it's worth it, considering I'm not really good at updating, nor at the whole userpic/icon thing."

And that's a good thing. Small shit doesn't overturn my world. I can gety by if someone isn't pleased with me. I know who loves me, and I know I'm one of them and that's what matters.

Yes, I've still got issues-- I might have those with me forever and ever. I'll just learn to live with them and to quiet the voices when I need to. 

But things have changed. For the better.

And it's not as scary as I thought. A huge part of who I was is gone, but maybe that just leaves space for better things to grow."

1.Whose Line. I have very nearly every episode from the earliest British ones on to the last few ABC ones on tape, and know most of them based on what the contestants are wearing.

2.My wedding-planning anal-retentive-ness. It came out of nowhere, but it's taken over! Help me!!

3.The fact that I bought all those Japanese Rockapella CDs, met my guy through them, listen to the md's all the stinkning time, belong to the online forum, hunt for lyrics to be my lj entry titles.

4.Burps & farts make me laugh. I'm a 10 year old boy trapped in a 25 year old woman's body. :p <--- Jeannie wrote that, but it's true about me, except I think I'm six! I'm also a little bit obsessed with poop.

5. I have more than one story that begins with ""One time at band camp...""

"event","So, we booked our travel for July. We'll be in the US from 11th July-25th July, and spending all/part of that in Pennsylvania, but might be able to travel a bit if we want to. :D It was rediculously expensive, but we just did it anyhow. Crazy fools.

Tonight we went to aerobics, which was good. Haven't been in a few weeks, and I missed it. Even if there were only 6 people there... hehehe.

Jennie gave us some dishes she doesnt want anymore, including a lovely tea set that is a family heirloom, and I promptly decided to put it in the loft/attic until we move. 

Saw the english GP today for the first time. I can barely contain my excitement. No really. He referred me to a family planning clinic, and I phoned them. Their next appointment is on June 21st, so that's when I'll be going. I'm not planning a family just yet (although part of me is ready, my wallet isn't!), but I need some help in NOT getting a family until I say so."

Not much to report on here. Just hanging around and waiting. Waiting for the wedding in t-5 months, and looking for a job and for a house. Housing prices here, by the way, for my fellow americans, are re-goddman-diculous. Seriously. For about $300,000 USD, we might get a three bedroom row house with a driveway, one toilet, and a miniscule yard. It's depressing!

Tomorrow is Jennie (Steve's sister)'s wedding reception in Maidstone, which should be fun. I am especially looking forward to seeing Steve's cousin's daughter who is 5 and is almost my favourite English person ever. So much fun, that girl is.

What are some essentials I should be looking for for my wardrobe? I have a couple pairs of jeans, black pants, a denim skirt and a white prarie skirt, and a jean jacket. I think I need a black cardigan and some workout clothes.

I'm meant to be going to the doctor for the first time here on Tuesday. My brave venture into the world of socialised health care! Hooray for me! I need to ask about an IUD, because I am sooooo sick of birth control that's chemical. I can't stand it. It makes me all hormonal and bitchy and bloated and constipated (way TMI, I know). I'm nervous about getting on the scale, but I might be OK if they do it in kilos, as Steve seems to think they will. I don't do metric. Hehe.

Oh, and why doesn't anybody ever tag me for these meme things???? What's up with that?!?"

Everyone has managed to make good lives for themselves, and even when they struggle, they're still productive and loving and have networks of people and I don't. Jobs and friends and parties and concerts and the ability to go places and get things for themselves.

It says something sad about the decisions I've made, I think.

It's just been that my life has been extremely boring lately. I even feel bored with it-- with waiting, but oh, well.

Waiting for a visa so I can work. Waiting to buy a house. Nothing exciting or dramatic.

Today I am catching up on our laundry and farting around online, updating my CV in the desperate hope that I can find some work sometime this decade and get the freak out of this house on a semi-regular basis. :D

Still planning the wedding, too.

And, I suppose, in some ways, I'm rather glad that things aren't all turmoil-filled and angst-y all the time. Just cruising and, mostly, enjoying it. 

Which isn't to say I don't feel the intense need to lose about 75 lbs, but I've got myself talked out of actually doing so. Maybe 15... ;-D"

"event","I'm in the mood to write. Sorry if it's boring, as therapeutic sometimes is.

I'm wondering why, while I've been in this house, the house I spet most of the last two years in , battling myself, my body, my brain. I'm looking for some cue as to why it happened. No, it won't change things or fix anything or give me so-called closure, but it's dawned on me recently that, if I am to move past this mindset about myself and my body and the world, I need to figure out which pieces of the foundation are in wrong and put them back the correct way.

It's disturbing to find myself in a place that simply by being in it, produces the unspeakably strong urge to down a handful of laxies or kneel with my head in a toilet. I considered the possibility that maybe it's not the house, but rather the stress of wedding planning, and immigration troubles and hormones causing that to surface, but when i spent yesterday morning with my mother, sitting amongst her messy apartment, I know I felt like all that was surmountable if I was surrounded by people who loved me and with whom I could be honest. Why don't I feel that here?

Might have something to do with the vast-ness of this house, the notable absence of photos, save for a few of the precious grandchildren. None of me, anywhere. Might have to do with the overbearing sense that my step-mother thinks she needs to do everything for everyone, and if someone insists on doing their own thing (clearly not to her standards), she gets angry. Is it terrible that we've known one another for almost 15 years and yet I feel unbearably uncomfortable in her presence, like somehow my connection to my mother or even to my father causes her to shun me? Is it connected to the deeper knowledge that my dad chose to leave my mom for her instead of stay with his children? That she's worth more than we were? 

And, yet, I'm sitting at the kitchen table this morning, worrying about a spoonful of sugar in my coffee. I used to always drink it black, savor the way it filled my belly. But I think I always wanted sugar in it. I like it that way better. and one teaspoon of sugar is what, 45 calories? I don't worry about these things out in the world, in England, in a gas station, at my aunt's birthday party, but here, in this house, it's a serious matter that creeps into my belly and sinks in as dread and anxiety. Over sugar. (Or, of course, not over the sugar at all). Why here do I feel like I don't deserve it?

I had a memory this morning of when my sisters and I used to visit my dad each weekend when we were younger, and there were always bath towels and washcloths set out for us in the room. And I have used two towels (one for my body and one for my hair) since I was six or so, and yet there was only one towel for each of us. Somehow, though, it never occured to me to ask for another one. I just shut up and lived with it. Perhaps that's sort of what I did with the eating disorder, too. There was this thing, this desire to play out with my body what I was struggling with inside (fear, change, loneliness, anxiety, sorrow, grief). And, perhaps in another place, surrounded by other people, or on my own, I might have let it go, but here, it festered and snowballed. Not a coincidence that I first purged here. That I was so full of anxiety and inferiority that I just HAD to get it out. 

I don't know what all this means. i know that there's this intense feeling here that I'm just starting to grasp and analyze. It's the feeling like I don't deserve, and while I feel that most everywhere I go,  my sense is that it's linked to these things here in this house very closely. I'm starting to wonder if I accept the joy here, let myself be happy here, to hell with my step-mom's insane blabbering routine, if it represents a split between me and my own mother. If I hold onto letting myself be second-classed here, keep believing that I'm not worth much of anything, that my father's superficial gestures are just that-- fake, and not real love, maybe that all means that I'm betraying my mother.

Maybe instead I feel like I can't complain, can't want anything (sugar, a towel, privacy), because if I did, if I did anything but pare down and empty out, I'll be wanting too much, and be cast away again like I was when he left. I know I didn't properly feel emotions and process things when my parents split up. Instead I worried about putting on a brave, normal, well-adjusted face, which I suppose is in line with my nature, pleasing other people. But I'm beginning to believe that the ground maybe moved and I didn't, I refused to move with it, for the sake of pleasing everyone else, and now there are some serious structural weak points. 

OK, there are undoubtedly some serious structural weak points, deep wounds covered over, but finding them, realizing why, that all hurts. It's sort of like I've been away from the building, or maybe in another part of it, building up important parts of it. And now when I come back to the weak bits, I've got better tools to understand them, to realize why they're like that, why I feel this way or throw up or starve. Fixing the wounds, the weak bits is harder, though. I suppose that the brain is powerful, to a degree. If I can convince myself that to starve is a good idea, thatI was fat at 100-odd pounds, that I was lazy if I slept in past 7, maybe I can convince myself that I do deserve to be heard, to be loved, to be part of this fucked-up family. Maybe I can turn off the voice that says they don't want me here. (Although I remain convinced that she does not want me here, as I suspect it messes up her neat little show of mom, dad, son, and two grandkids). It takes enormous work, though, and I get tired sometimes, of forcing the thoughts to line up logically, of forcing myself to try and accept my body as it is (much less love it). 

A lot of the time, I can do it, when I have steve to help me hold up the weak parts. It's enormous responsibility, and the ilogical side of me says that it is simply not fair to rely so heavily on him to help me, but maybe I deserve it. Maybe it's ok if I want someone to help me. If I want someone to rest on when it gets to be too much. Where he is is safe. I know that with him, and with his family, it's ok to work on the tools, to build up the sense of deserving. 

I knew it wouldn't be a straight line from sick to recovered. It's silly to imagine that I could come back here and not be tempted, triggered, and depressed. It's heartbreaking to see myself here a year ago, hungry and sad and still pretending to smile. It's also strangely tempting, even as I realize what went wrong, to do it all again, to say, ""See? See how I hurt? How you've hurt me?"""

"event","It rains here a lot. Well, that's not strictly true. Someone told me when I was here this summer, ""If you don't like the weather in England, wait 15 minutes."" It's cloudy and sunny and windy and rainy and almost warm all in the same day. Which, I suppose is good.

Right now I don't feel so hot. I have the bad kind of cramps. Yucky. I'm on the grouchy side, and tired, despite having slept 10 hours last night. 

Anyhow, I thought I'd do a little wedding-planning update. If you're bored already about me writing about this stuff, just stop reading. Handy, huh?

So, I have a church (Hamilton Presbyterian Church, in Bethel Park, PA), a minister (my uncle), a reception venue/caterer/baker (Four Points by Sheraton Pittsburgh Airport), a florist (someone named Judith who my step-momworks with-- she's in charge of the floral design school at the vo-tech), and my dress ordered (email me if you want pics). We have a rough guest list, my attendants chosen (my two sisters, hope and jill are co- maids of honor, and my two best friends/roommates from college are bridesmaids, plus we have a jr bridesmaid, my cousin hannah, who will be 9 in November-- she'll be carrying the rings in a little purse, since there are no small children in the wedding).

I still need a photographer (soon!), a DJ, transportation, him to pick his attendants, invites, programs, to pick bridesmaids' dresses, rings, to plan a rehearsal dinner, tuxes for the guys, accessories for my dress, a seating plan, to meet with the cake lady, to arrange all the travel for ourselves and everyone else, find a hair and makeup person, plan the ceremony with my uncle, decide on who is toasting and when, and keep my parents from killing each other, or me from killing them both. Good times.

We met with my dad to talk about the finances, and he (of course), said, well, we'll split it three ways, you pay a third, we'll pay a third, and your mom can pay a third. Now, somehow, that isn't fair. Steve and I will pay for some things, yes. (I've already paid for my dress, and the favor-making supplies) My mom, though, probably can't give us much more than 2000.00, and that's stretching it. She's declared bankruptcy. She has one income, they have two, and they're not saving for a house, like we are. That'll cover the photographer and the invites and probably the cars. If my dad pays for the reception, then I think we can manage the other things. All fine, right? No. My step-mom has my dad firmly by the balls, and told him no he couldn't volunteer more than the flowers and 3,000 of the 6 it costs to host the reception. 

I think I can get more out of him. In fact, if I call him personally on Wendesday while she's at work and tell him that my mom can't give us as much, and is there any way they could stretch a little and cover the reception outright. I think if it's just me talking to him, we can swing it.  I know it will all work out and be just as beautiful as I want it to be, but sometimes I feel like strangling my dad. Don't be a jackass. How many times does he think I'm going to get married? Maybe he can take one less vacation to Hawaii this year and pay for some wedding expenses. Oh wait, his bitch wife would have a fit. *rolls eyes*"

"event","OK, so yes, I am still buzzing, and still happy as a smiling aligator, and still 'EEEEEE-ing' a lot. But, I have calmed down a bit, and am starting to enjoy my break and vacation and my time here.

Got a secret santa package from Lucie the other day-- thanks! I love it! And, I also got a card from Elena, and OH BY THE WAY I AM ENGAGED!!! :-P Just kidding, but that's roughly how my thought process has been working lately. It's so exciting. I discover more pretty things to look at online all the time, and have spent a little time cooing over them, or, as is the case with most of the dresses, ew-ing. I like plain. I don't like puffy.

What else? Nothing too much. I'm starting to realize that I am actually going to have to drive here at some point, which scares the guacamole out of me. I don't know if I can be taught... old dog and new tricks and all that.

So, that's it. I shall try (I promise) to not turn this into bride-zilla's lj, but I'm just too excited right now. So wonderful to get to do all the girly things I've dreamed of since I was six.... :-P Oh, and maybe, just maybe, we have a first choice date chosen, but clearly we have to present it to the parents and then see if we can find a venue and all. (Wherever that turns out to be...) November 5. Sound fun? :-P

More to come..."

I am engaged. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!

Oh, and EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!

The future Mrs. Steve. It's official. I have a gorgeous (fucking gorgeous!!!) ring on my left hand. 

And a really nice story to tell my grandchildren. 

See, this all happened ON STAGE at the Rockapella concert on Saturday (12/11-- my BIRTHDAY!!!). Steve had apparently worked it out ahead of time to have them drag us both up on stage. Dragged is a good description, too, at least from my point of view (Steve was obviously in what he called ""stage mode.""). Scott came and took me by the hand up onto the stage and said, ""Did you know this was coming?"" I said no, as I really wasn't expecting anything like that. So they sit me down on a stool, instruct steve to get down on his knee (luckily he obliged, and got back up without assistance, despite telling me beforehand he was going to be worried about that when the time eventually came). At some point, ""Ellie My Love,"" perhaps a touch higher than normal (!!)started, and then I cried and blubbered for four minutes or so, said yes, and helped my poor, shaking fiance put the thing on my hand. Then, I was vaguely aware of people making a lot of noise, hopefully in approval. :D And then we thanked the nice men, and went back to our seats. Later, we got to see the guys after the show, and after Sunday's show in Delaware, and they were so nice about it, so very generous.

So everyone's parents and siblings, and many people I havent even met yet, have all been informed. 

No, we haven't picked a date. I promise, as soon as that happens, you'll all know, but in the meantime, LET US BASK IN THE GLOW, DAMNIT! :-P

So, here's our preliminary website, that we will update with details when we have some, and a picture of the big moment:
http://weddings.theknot.com/pwp/view/co_main.aspx?coupleid=3238811179412516

How exciting is this?? Now, I get to begin the biggest thrill a girl ever gets in her entire life (well, fully dressed, anyhow!), planning a wedding, and the biggest thrill for me when it comes to planning anything-- bargains!:D

More to come, I'm sure, but we're just really busy being happy and relaxing after the whirlwind of emotion that's filled the last week or so."

Sorry. Your Eating Disorder Doesn't Meet Our Criteria.
By ROBIN MARANTZ HENIG


Published: November 30, 2004
<lj-cut>

Imagine a 20-year-old woman who refuses to eat anything except carrots and toast because she is afraid of gaining weight, even though she is 5-foot-8 and weighs only 99 pounds. She exercises to the point of exhaustion five mornings a week because, though she is bone-thin, she thinks her thighs are too flabby. Her periods are irregular, but she has never gone more than three months without menstruating.

Another woman, who is also 20 and also 5-foot-8, has an opposite eating pattern. She goes without eating all day, and starting at 6 p.m. she eats nonstop, whatever she can get her hands on. Her favorite pastime is to sit in front of the television with a gallon of mocha-chip ice cream. She maintains a normal weight of 130 by occasionally forcing herself to vomit. But purging is not always easy in her college dormitory, with four young women sharing a single bathroom, so she ends up vomiting, on average, about once a week.

Everyone can agree that these women have some sort of disordered eating.

But psychiatrists would say that neither one falls into the strict definition of anorexia nervosa, the most severe eating disorder, or its relative, bulimia nervosa. According to the bible of psychiatric diagnosis, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, anorexia must be accompanied by cessation of menstrual periods for at least three months in a row, and bulimia must involve vomiting or other forms of purging at least two times a week, on average.

Instead these women, and thousands like them, would fall into a category that doctors have been relying on for years, a vague nondiagnosis known by the acronym Ednos: eating disorder not otherwise specified.

Diagnosing psychiatric conditions is more of an art than a science, and the Not Otherwise Specified label reflects the imprecision of that art. The American Psychiatric Association's manual has a Not Otherwise Specified category for many disorders, whenever symptoms are so vague, so mild or so untreatable that it doesn't seem to warrant the full-fledged diagnosis. With the manual continually under revision, the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is the place where new diagnoses emerge.

For instance, the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome, a variant of autism, was pulled from a collection of disorders previously labeled Pervasive Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.

Much is at stake in whether a condition is elevated to the status of a full-fledged diagnosis. Because no laboratory tests or other objective criteria exist for making psychiatric diagnoses, the American Psychiatric Association's manual is the definitive arbiter of the line between normal and abnormal. Its definitions help determine such practical matters as insurance reimbursement, competence and eligibility for disability. But they also help determine something more elusive, and probably more important: whether someone's behavior should be considered a personality quirk or a symptom of mental illness.

Now, in the diagnostic category of eating disorders, the search for greater specificity in the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is generating much attention.

""The Future of Ednos"" was a topic at an international meeting on eating disorders in Amsterdam last month, and it is the title of a book expected to be released in Europe next year.

To some observers, this new attention comes not a moment too soon.

""Ednos right now is a real hodgepodge,"" said Dr. B. Timothy Walsh, professor of pediatric psychopharmacology at Columbia. ""We have people in that category with anorexia nervosa,"" but they still menstruate so they don't meet all the criteria for a formal diagnosis.

Similarly, Dr. Walsh said, ""we have people who are obese and binge but don't vomit,"" so they don't fit into the strict definition of bulimia nervosa, which requires both binging and purging. Or they might binge and vomit once a week, but to qualify as bulimic they would have to vomit at least twice a week.
~~~~~~~~~~

""What we really need to do is collect data,"" Dr. Walsh said. ""All the knowledge base we currently have relates to people who vomit twice a week. But if it turns out that the characteristics of those who binge and vomit once a week are similar to those who do so twice a week, then we can loosen the criteria for bulimia nervosa.""

The history of eating disorders has been a gradual one as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual has been revised through the years. Anorexia nervosa first appeared in the version of the manual known published in 1980, and bulimia appeared for the first time in the same edition. Bulimia was renamed bulimia nervosa in the next edition, which came out in 1987.

Anorexia nervosa affects 0.5 to 3.7 percent - or about 1.5 million to 11 million American women - at some point in life, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Rates are lower among men and teenage boys.

The lifetime prevalence of bulimia is higher - from 1.1 to 4.2 percent of women - with a similar age and sex distribution. 

In the current version of the diagnostic manual, published in 1994, one condition - binge eating disorder - was pulled out of Ednos and listed as a ""provisional diagnostic category,"" the first step in the process of achieving its own diagnosis. The disorder is much like bulimia nervosa, but without the purging.

The ""provisional"" designation highlights the need for more research into a condition's prevalence and treatment, and highlighting binge eating disorder in this way was a prelude to its being named as a separate diagnosis in the manual that is to appear in 2012.

""That's one of most compelling reasons to get something out of the Not Otherwise Specified category,"" said Dr. Michael First, associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia. Dr. First is a member of the planning group that is directing the enormous undertaking of revising the manual for its fifth edition.

""If you feel that there's a homogeneous group of patients in there for which there's a treatment, the fact that it's called Not Otherwise Specified really obscures it, hindering treatment, hindering research,"" he said.

Another candidate for a new eating disorder in the fifth edition of the manual can be thought of as the flip side of binge eating, a condition that has been labeled ""purging disorder"" by Dr. Pamela Keel, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa. Just as binge eating disorder has many of the characteristics of bulimia, so does purging disorder. But neither meets the strict criteria for bulimia nervosa.

People with purging disorder, Dr. Keel said, are of normal weight, and they purge after eating normal or even small amounts of food.

Right now, purging disorder is relatively hidden, buried in the Ednos category. And until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panelists ask for more data, as they have for binge eating disorder, not much more will be known, Dr. Keel said.

""Within widely used diagnostic interviews, if a person has never had a low weight and denies a history of binge eating, the interviewer skips all questions regarding the use of vomiting, laxatives or diuretics to control weight,"" Dr. Keel wrote in an e-mail message. ""It's very difficult to learn more about a problem if you never ask any questions about it.""

As Dr. First sees it, several criteria must be met before a diagnosis is pulled out of the Not Otherwise Specified category and into a stand-alone diagnosis. These criteria have to be met before binge eating disorder, purging disorder or any other condition emerges out of the Ednos grab bag.

The first requirement is that a significant number of patients must be affected, he said. Second, there has to be evidence of an existing and effective treatment.

The criterion of an effective treatment has prevented many conditions from being entered in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. In the 1980's, there was an effort to include ""sadistic personality disorder."" But it failed, said Dr. First, because no treatment existed. ""We could have decided to call something sadistic personality disorder,"" he said, ""but if there's no treatment, what would be the point?""

~~~~~~~

The third criterion for removing a condition from the Not Otherwise Specified category is the trickiest to meet. It relates to a kind of diagnosis-creep. Experts working on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panels must ask how close the condition is to behavior that could be considered normal. For binge eating disorder, for instance, they must ask: When is such behavior a true psychiatric condition, and when is it the kind of thing that almost everyone engages in every Thanksgiving?

""This is the matter of what we call false positives,"" Dr. First said. ""It's the danger of defining as a psychiatric syndrome a set of symptoms that normal people have.""

When a new category is created in the manual, he said, ""you're trying to identify a category that will help patients get treatment.""

""But,"" he continued, ""you're worried that this category is going to be applied to normal people as well.""

Some psychiatrists want to create a different label for Ednos, calling it instead ""mixed eating disorder"" or ""atypical eating disorder."" But Dr. Walsh of Columbia said that would be merely a cosmetic change.

""If I'm a clinician and I get a call from a school saying, 'Hey, I've got a person with mixed eating disorder coming over,' I don't know if I'm going to be seeing someone who weighs 80 pounds or 280 pounds,"" he said. ""The whole belief that diagnoses are useful things rests on their ability to put together under one umbrella a relatively homogeneous set of syndromes, which gives the clinician the ability to shortcut a full assessment.""

Diagnostic labels, said Dr. Walsh, ""allow big shortcuts.""

Dr. Keel, on the other hand, prefers the term ""mixed eating disorder"" over Ednos. She said the mixed eating disorder label ""may have the benefit of eliminating the false impression that Ednos is somehow less severe or less clinically significant than so-called full-threshold eating disorders."" But she expressed concern that the term would limit the enthusiasm for teasing out what other identifiable conditions lie within the Ednos category.

As experts debate what to do about Ednos - pull out distinct disorders from the grab bag category, change the diagnostic criteria for the existing disorder, give the grab bag a more scientific-sounding name - people with disordered eating are left in a kind of therapeutic limbo.

Eventually, the hope is, the uncertainties will be resolved, and the woman with anorexia who still menstruates and the woman with bulimia who only purges once a week, will be able to get the diagnosis and treatment that they need.

THis was the fucking worst day in a long time. 

I was feeling fat (who am i kidding, i am fat!) this morning. My jeans feel like skin-tight and i hate it. I used to be thin and beautiful and now i'm fat. I hate it. I can't do this...

Then, I got pulled over on my way to work. MAde me 10 minutes late, and the director gave me shit about it. Got a ticket for 110.00. Wonderful.

Got home at the end of a stressful day in which parents accused me of not watching their kids carefully enough. I'd like to know how I'm supposed to change diapers and still have my eyes on 5 kids at all times... was hungry, nothing in the house at all, so I poured a bowl of raisin bran. Sour milk. Hooray.

Then, and i know how stupid this is, I was kind of agitated watching ANTM tonight. Blech. 

What a fucking day. I want to either go to sleep, cry, or puke my guts out. None are viable options right at this moment, though."

Anyhow, yeah. Thanksgiving. A strange day. Of course, for the ED'ed person inside me, any holiday so focused on food is weird, but this was just strange. I ate so much, and I want so much to purge. Those fucking laxies are right there. Looking at me. Grrrrr.

Plus, today is one year since my gram died. Thanksgiving will never be the same, in my book.

I've been battling my sisters all day long, but escaped unscather except for Jill throwing keys at me and hiting my chest. My pants that I didnt htink would fit are actually too big, so yay! (Even after supper!)

Otherwise, not much new in the news of me. 11 days til my booty-fest.
Oh, and my computer's keyboard broke, so I'm using a laptop with a different keyboard, which is very surreal, and very bad for my typing accuracy, but i cant afford to get it fixed right now. Maybe after christmas."

"event","So, first week at the new job. I am so freaking exhausted. Physically so. Starting any new job after being off for a while always does that, cause you're learning the ropes and adjusting to a new schedule, but those kids take SERIOUS work. I have no idea how those people who have like quints manage it. I go bonkers after eight hours with 5 of them... imagine 24 hours a day! EEEEK!

I do feel like I'm getting the hang of the job, though. I'm getting to know the parents and the routine, and I'm feeling more comfortable asking my co-workers for help when I need it. They've been super-nice, and have given me confirmation that my boss is a real piece of work. She makes lists of demands, but has a distinct way of ignoring or forgetting to make sure her staff has what they need. Oh, well, I think I can manage, cause I do like the work. I spent the two hours during naptime on Friday re-arranging my room how I want. I like it better with centers and soft, cozy spots for the kids to sit/lay down if they want to. The room was a bit industrial before. The challenge now, of course, is trying to see all the kids at once when they're in the different ""centers.""

Hmmm. Yeah, so that's taken up most of my week. I'm looking forward to Christmas, to seeing Steve's parents again. I'm working very hard to maintain my weight around 145. I was up around 150, but I lost some when I got my period and stopped stresseating when the job thing worked itself out. 

The worst thing about the job is that the air is very dry in there, and i have to wear latex gloves to change nappies, and then wash and sanitize my hands between every diaper, after every nose-wipe, and every meal. It's a lot on my poor hands. I want to keep them somewhat nice. Bitten, ragged nails aren't pretty.

I cleaned the shit out of the house and porch today, too, so I'm pooped again, but thank god I also have off tomorrow. Phew."

I'm now working at the day care.
I have health care.
I really like the kids in my class. One is a magical age-- no tantrums like in the twos, but they discover everything and are just so amazed by the world around them.

I went in today, and after much hassle with paperwork, etc, I first told the HR lady about the time I need off, and told her I wouldn't make a commitment to the center or the kids or the parents if that wouldnt be plausible. She said it definitely would be OK.

Then, Mary, my immediate boss was like, ""oh, i don't know."" so I told her that it wasn't negotiable, as the tickets are purchased, but if she needed to find someone else, I'd understand. She said she would get back to me and I said, ""OK, but I wanted to be up front. I will not be able to work on those days."" She had me stay and work a full 8 hour day, so it must be OK, and if it isn't, she can't say she didn't know.

So, Miss Weenie is exhausted. I'm seriously so tired, partially cause I couldn't sleep last night for all the worrying, and partially cause I chased 5 one year olds around for 8 hours.

I'm pissed off/sad about the election. I really am. I just this minute watched a news clip on CNN that said, when asked in exit polls, 23% of voters gave as the main issue they voted on: ""moral issues.""

Excuse me, but fucking please. There is a war in which thousands of peole are dying. That's moral? Did any of those voters think about the backhanded way Al Quaida and the Bin Laden family were treated post-9/11? That's moral? Letting thousands of people die because we won't allow stem cell research? That's moral? Letting women keep having babies because soon they won't have any choice, yet not educating about birth control, and cutting funding for welfare/education/Head Start? That's not moral. It's moral if it's <b>your</b> morals, but the president of the United States has to stand for ALL of its people, not just the Conservative Christians, or the Oil Companies. Or Haliburton. 

Of course, this also means that there was a smaller-than-expected turnout of young voters, and voters who were probably not going to vote for Bush. I almost want to say, ""fuck you, then, you deserve whatever happens,"" but I know so many good people who are yound and who were responsible and did the right thing. Some of them voted for Bush, which is OK with me, because I know that differing opinions have a place in US democracy. I appreciate them.

And that room for discussion and differences is part of what scares me so much about Geroge W. Bush. I'm afraid to live in a country where things like the Patriot Act are abused to silence any criticism, questions, or challenges. That's not democracy. That's akin to fucking Nicaraguan politics.

I'm also really dismayed by the laziness of American voters. I'm really starting to believe that this country is almost too stupid for a democracy. What happened to people discussing issues, reading about records of politicans running for office, instead of slandering one another on TV ads? Since whenard  can someone continue to win a House seat simply by plastering the district with yard signs? Why won't the voters think for themselves? Why do we buy into the spin? Because it's easier to do that. Thinking and researching and questioing is hard work. Rule by all is not an easy, drive-thru kind of thing. It takes work. And, in my opinion, this country has failed to do the work. Incidentally, I think that would be true no matter who won this election. 

Something seriously has to change. We've set ourselves up to be dictated. Think about it, how easy that would be. Don't have to go to the polls, read anything, wait for anything. Something becomes law overnight. Voila! You can watch and listen to what the high and mighty allows you to. The whole idea of journalism will be defined by Fox News. Sounds suspiciously like China, or North Korea, doesn't it? Where's the line between looking at what library books you've checked out under the Patriot Act, and bugging your house. Where's the line between being labeled as a terrorist for holding meetings or war protests and being run over by tanks for protesting?

I just wish some people would think. Not ""the bush people."" Some of them, I believe, do think, and do what they believe, and that's their right. I can say that because I despise the idea of squashing their right to a place at the political table. That mine could easily be squashed in the next four years, well, that disgusts me, too. 

It's a sad time for this country."

So, today I've been worrying about employment.

Here's the history: I quit my job teaching at the end of last school year in Philly. I liked it, but I was commuting 4 hours a day, sleeping less than that, and the prospect of having to continue graduate studies and manage that miserable schedule, as well as the bullshit involved with living with my asswipe father made me need to get out.

So, without a real plan, I came ""home"" to pittsburgh to live with my mom, which has been OK. She bothers me some, but not as much as feeling like a stranger in my dad's house.

The problem (well, the big one) is that I didn't have a plan for finding work at the time. I just up and left. So I applied to a bunch of jobs. The school district still paid me until the last payday when they finally stopped.

Now, I have been on probably thirteen interviews. I'm either over qualified or not what they're looking for or something. So finally, after looking with varying degrees of effort for like three months, I got a job offer this week working in a day care. It looks like such a perfect job, me in charge of 5 one year olds... wonderful! The problem is that I have a plane ticket to England on December 15th to the 5th. I have to go see his parents, cause I think there's going to be a party for us and some wedding planning to do... plus, i really want to go.

I also had a job offer today from Target, which pays less, but which i could quit without feeling guilty or like I had abandoned some 1 year olds when the time comes.

I also have an interview at the Body Shop on Saturday, and they already know about the trip and are OK with it. And, it's for an assistant manager position, and will probably therefore pay decent. (at the very least it's a 40% discount on all the stuff I love!)

I'm stumped. I haven't told either of the first two employers about the trip yet, and I think what I will do is go to Tender Care on monday to do the paper work and tell her about the trip. If it's a major problem, I can ask her to hold off on offering me a specific position until after the new year and go work for Target or Body shop and just not tell them anything about the trip until I'm ready to go.

Such a dilemma. I know. Drama galore.

Hehe. If only I had been more responsible when I was still getting paid and saved up, I could wait until I get back to get a job, but no, I spend like nobody's business. It's like I'm physically incapable of saving money. Bah.

So. There's the thing. Any thoughts?"

Things have been going really well for me.

The therapist finally called me back today (she was out of town for ten days) and so now we can make an appointment. 

I've been trying very hard to be nice to myself, to eat more normally. Last night, I even had regular, full-sugar soda. I didnt like it, but it's been ages since I've had that.

At the moment, though, I'm scared to eat. I have no idea why. I just cant go into the kitchen, even though I'm pretty hungry. I only had a cup of tea today. It might have something to do with the fact that I found out I overdrew my checking account. Embarassing. When things are going well and then I screw up on something like that, it spirals into more and more self-hatred. 

Also, I've been feeling huge the last few days. My thighs seem to be growing before my eyes, as are my hips and butt. I hate being so disproportionate. I hate that I can buy a dress in a size 2, and yet 7/8 pants dont fit me properly. I know I have to be patient if I want to recover. I know I have to accept that my body is going to do what it needs to and that it will balance out in the end. I know food and clothing sizes arent the end of the world, but right now, none of that matters. I can't go have a sandwhich. It's pathetic.

I think I'll take a shower and then see ifI feel a little better, more like eating. I have some letters to get out in the mail today, and a nice walk to the mailbox might be good for me. I also want to go tonight to take my mom to work so I can apply for some jobs. I'm just not sure about the daycare thing, because I dont want to commit myself and then leave for england in december for a while, and then leave for jamaica in february. It seems like a retail job would allow me a little more freedom in taking time off if I need it, 

And I'm secretly obsessed with the beginnings of wedding planning. Eeek! LOL! 

Who will come?? Seriously, when it happens, I definitely want you all there! Oh, and what do you all think about me posting links here and asking for opinions? Is that tacky? Obnoxious? I was contemplating asking on MD or LB, but I don't want to be a pain in anyone's ass. I would just like some good old girly fun looking at stuff and sharing opinoins. What do you all think?"

Long time, no update, huh?

So, where to start. First, I'm a little wee bit pished tonight. Hehe. It was my stepsister's wedding today and i had a drink at the reception., It was good. The wedding was OK, but I spent most of the time thinking about how I will do things differently when it's my turn next. Hehehe.

Secondly, I have partially been offline because Steve spent Sept 27- Oct. 8 with me in PA. We had such a wonderful time. I love him so much it scares/affects me to the core sometimes. Well, he'd been there only two days and he was kind of a little silly the one night, and he said, ""I read your livejournal a few weeks ago."" I had an inkling he would, I suppose, since someone we both speak to on the Rockapella forums found me on LJ, and if she did, I suppose he could, too. The saddest thing is that I usually only put the worst, most desparate stuff here. With the exception of the happy posts re: him in the past six or so months. The ""m-word."" That stuff made him happy.

So now, I'm out of the closet, so to speak. He knows. It feels so good to have that out there, to have him know the nastiest, most hiddeous thing about me and still love me and tell me he wants to still spend his life with me. I somehow got a glimpse of a life that involves a future and him and happiness, and there's no room for being Eating Disordered in all of that. 

I'm in recovery. Right now, it's the hardest thing. I have to spend such a huge portion of every day battling myself, telling myself how to behave like a recovered, healthy person. Do this. Don't do that. I want to be well for him. And for me, and for us. This is scary, and it's hard and I don't know sometimes if I can do it. Letting go of my only coping mechanism is frightening the shit out of me, but it feels so right, so solid. I want to do it. I called a therapist here who specializes in EDs and runs a support group the other day, and she never called back, which was somewhat discouraging. I'll call another on Monday, though, cause I know that I have to do that and soon.

I'm in recovery. It feels so good to say that, to have that as my little mantra-- I'm in recovery.

I also have a prospective job! I interviewed for a childcare center/preschool last week and the woman called me back and set up a meeting for Friday to meet a center director and spend some time in a classroom. It's a 2-year-old teacher position, which is great. I am very excited about this! WHOOO! I'm glad I waited it out. I know i will be so much happier doing this than waiting tables. And it'll be great resume stuff, too. 

So, that's it for now. On December 6th, Steve will be here again, and on the 15th, we'll go together back to England till Jan 5th, during which time I'll hopefully interview and job hunt more seriously. 

I feel so good right now. So loved and whole and hopeful. It's wonderful."

"event","so its 1 in the afternoon and im already bored. i woke up at 830 folded my clothes, put them away, rolled up my egg shell bed, as im currently living with my friend while her mom and i look for an apartment. around 11 i went to the beach with vanessa, swam played in the sand. it was so fun, i burried my legs up to my knees in the sand. it looked really funny. so anyhow, at 12 we walked home and i took a shower. now like i said its one and i have nothing to do. actually all i have to do today it give my drivers liscense to this place for an apartment so they can make a copy of it. hopefully we get this place, im sick of living out of boxes and sleeping on floors."

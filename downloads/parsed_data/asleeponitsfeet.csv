Two out the three got in!  and my teacher was soo impressed cause there was a huge pile of the adults artwork that got rejected.  Anyways, you guys have to come to the show in February.  I finished my painting even though the model didnt show up... i am actually pretty pleased with it.  so, this pretty much rocks, cause im only fourteen and i already have a few things going for me if i want to go to art school."

The Washington-area FM radio station WHFS, long a pioneering purveyor of alternative rock, did a programming U-turn at noon today by ditching the genre for a Spanish-language, Latin music format featuring middle-of-the-road superstars such as Marc Anthony and Juan Luis Guerra. 

WHFS-FM 99.1, the radio station behind the popular alt rock music festival called ""HFStival,"" is now ""El Zol,"" featuring Caribbean and Central American music, according to a prepared statement released by Infinity Broadcasting, the station's owner. 

Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc., the nation's largest Latino-controlled radio broadcasting company, served as a consultant on the reformatting of the station. Infinity and SBS have formed an alliance, with Infinity owning an equity interest in the Florida-based company. 

The abrupt switch came as a shock. Since 1969, WHFS has served as the arbiter of cutting-edge rock in the Washington area, introducing listeners to acts such the Cure and the Violent Femmes. 

The HFStival has grown from an offbeat spring festival to a nationally-recognized Bacchanalia that last year offered 36 musical acts spread out over three stages and a techno hideaway called the Buzz Tent. 

""Certainly this will have major ramifications for new music in Washington, D.C., said Seth Hurwitz, the owner of the city's 9:30 Club and producer of last year's HFStival, which drew 65,000 fans to RFK Stadium in May. 

""They were always the forerunner for presenting new music,"" he said of WHFS. ""They were a vital fabric of Washington's culture."""

"event","i never write in this anymore. hm.... well, i won't mess around with what has happened. 

graduation in on thursday. if you know me at all or have read any of these entries over the past couple of high school years, you have some knowledge of just how jovial i am. it's still hard to grasp the concept of not going to mesa high anymore. but once it happens, it'll sink in fast, and all will be good. i will miss my A hour, though. 

so, last day of school is wednesday. graduation thursday. party on friday. party on saturday. next monday through wednesday is nau orientation. and thursday i leave for ireland. 

as for ireland, i'll try to keep my myspace updated with all the shit i do. not only to brag and make you all jealous, but for my own records, i guess. and it'll be an easy way to answer when people as what i did. 

even though the next couple of weeks are obviously a little packed, i'm trying to get face time with people. if you feel as though you'd like to see me before i move on with my life, please, phone me. i know there are a couple of people i've tried to get in contact with, but i'm sure i can still make time if you mean something to me. 

anyways.... i hope everyone is having an excellent life!

peace!"

"event","i had such a great day on friday. school was okay. just like every other friday. 
after school i had my first day at my new job. i'm now a receptionist/office assistant at therapy zone. therapy zone is a company that provides different types of therapy for children that have special needs. they mainly focus in music and horse therapy. it's the exact job i've been waiting for. pay is great. hours are excellent. everybody is just so nice. i get to work with kids. specifically special needs kids (which i love). i answer phones and do paper work when i'm not speaking with clients. it is just so exciting. i'm really excited about it. i actually feel like i've got something i will enjoy and will learn from. 
so, after that i went home and spent some quality time with stephen. he and michelle are ""taking a break"" and they are suppose to move into there condos in the next week or so. on top of that, he just started a second job and will now be working approximately 50 hours/week. needless to say, he's got a lot on his mind. 
a little later jacque called and we decided to go to the awesome first friday show in phoenix. something i had really wanted to do, but didn't really have anyone i thought would be interested in going with me. we drove down there just in time for vistalance. which was awesome. they really put on a great show. everyone should check 'em out at www.myspace.com/vistalance. it's a little heavier than the stuff i normally seek out, but it's good. and it doesn't hurt that i now have a massively huge crush on brandon, the guitar player. he's in my guitar class. i've never had a crush this big, honestly. i'm so scared i'm going to get hurt, but this past week we've been having a lot of fun and we'll see how things go. if you talk to me in the near future, i'm sorry for obsessing over him. i normally am not like that about a boy. this one's just different. so, i appologize in advance. 
then saturday i spent the day with the fam. went to stephen's football game. he got a touchdown. his second in the season. pretty amazing. i love watching my brothers live out their passions. it was always easier for me to accept ryan's music and to enjoy him play because i can relate to it, but i think i'm starting to get stephen a lot better. he really loves sports. and he's actually going for it and doing it. i really do have a great family. my house is super crowded right now with me, my parents, stephen, michelle, and now ryan, but i'm enjoying it because i know in approximately 2 months it'll be back to just me and the parents. and not long after that i'll be gone too. that's kinda sad. i'm just happy i can appreciate the short amount of time that is left instead of looking back with regret in, like, a year. back to saturday...then the 'rents and i went to the chinese cultural center. it was neato. i wish there were more there. then i was supposed to go out with some friends last night, but apparently that was cancelled. which was cool because i was so tired. i think i fell asleep at 8:30. 
today i've just been lazy. now i need to get off my rear and go to the library. don't get me wrong, i love the library. almost too much. i just don't feel like getting dressed. how gross is that. 

sorry the the excessive droning and monotonous schedule that this post ended up to be."

"event","I think it would be very easy for me to become an insomniac. Easy in the sense that if I didn't force myself to sleep, I'd probably be an insomniac. Or if I dwell on it too much. So my main focus is to not dwell on it at all. 

I've got an interview tomorrow to be a receptionist. I'm excited. It's just the kind of job I want right now. But I still have my other job if things don't pan out. 

So, Ireland is a definate go (knock on wood). I'll graduate from high school, 2 days later go to Flagstaff for orientation, and the day after that I'll be on my way. 5 weeks in Ireland. Learning. Freedom. New people (at the age I better interract with). Drinking age of 18. Pubs galore. Should be a lot of fun. 

Ryan's show was fun. New cd = unfathomable (haha. older btd reference. what? no one got that? fine)

I'm still always searching for new experiences. Stupid responsibilities. No time for anything fun and when I do have time, I'm beat. Like right now. Friday night. I just got out of work, like, 40 minutes ago. So, I have a couple hours that I could do something with. Nope. I have to wake up early. And I barely slept this week. So the attempt to sleep must occur. 

Sometimes I wonder what I will think of how I am now in the future. Will I say 'yeah, I really did waste high school?' Because that would be my best educated guess. Or will I think 'I tried, but I just didn't peak 'til later?' Or will I not remember a thing? Whoa, what if this is my peak? Life would really suck if it were. No, I won't let it be. If it weren't for school and work, I wouldn't be in this rut. I'm 100% positive of that. 

Oh well, just keep trying to make the best of it. I'm just getting a little tired of laying a supposed foundation for the future. I want to live a great life now and then. Not suffer now to have a better then. But if I don't, I kinda screw up my future. And it's really important for me not to do that. 

I wish I were somewhere in NorCal. In my small 2 bedroom apartment. Maybe with a roommate or 2. No shoes. Music always playing. Just completely comfortable. Only light is candles. It smells of strong coffee and patchouli. Street performers are on the street below. Maybe in front of the coffee shop I frequent. I could go on and on with this dream. It's really all I want anymore. Yes, I still want to be a teacher. Completely. But I want to at least live a couple years living the way I want to and the way I probably won't be able to in the further future. And, I guess can teach and still live like that. Not all teachers are stiff zombies who live with no one but their 12 cats. That's just my English teacher. I will never be like that. Ok, maybe one cat. 2 tops. But not by myself! 

Ahh.... to just sit at Haight and Ashbury. Then again, I'm picturing it 40 years ago. Pssh... even 10 years ago. Oh well, it's my dream. Fuck, maybe I'll be reading and Bob Dylan will tap me on the shoulder and ask me to accompany him because Joan Baez had a previous engagement. Fantasies can be fun. 

FUCK!!! Josh and Mike just called with an offer including much alcohol and good times. And I have to wake up early? What kind of cruel joke is this!!!!!

Whatever. I'm going to lay down."

HOME GROWN
Batter the Drag 
The Big Sleep 
(Satiated Records)
By CASEY LYNCH

Published: Thursday, January 12, 2006


Most bands falsely advertise -- they describe their sound ad nauseam as different and unclassifiable, but a good listen usually outs them as either deceived or uninitiated. In contrast, Tempe's Batter the Drag (a hip '50s term for playing music on the street) oozes originality. BTD succeeds because it knows when to say when -- dissonant chord arrangements, oddly satisfying harmonies, and jagged rhythm changes are all executed with enough technical deftness to make musicians in the crowd grin while not alienating the average listener. So, what do you call it? Crowd-pleasing math grunge? Throbbing alterna-power gristle? A blessing? Whatever the case, songs on the band's new CD The Big Sleep, like ""Ridin' the Fishtail"" and ""Backmask Facelift,"" crash with the heaviness of Voivod and Black Flag while pulsing with the off-kilter pop appeal of Samiam. For bands out there still confused about what's unclassifiable, here's a tip -- check out Batter the Drag for being different in all the right ways."

i haven't been getting on this stupid idiot box nearly as much lately. which is probably good? i don't know. 

something else that is good....

BATTER THE DRAG CD RELEASE SHOW
is this saturday. at the clubhouse. all ages. $3.00 to get in and a free full length cd (which will blow your skull). necronauts, let go, botany, and one of the dudes from yancey will all be joining m'boys. 

it's gonna be freakin amazing. you have to be there. bring all your friends. enemies. mothers. rape victims. whoever. and if you are sitting there thinking 'hm... i want to go, but i have no one to go with.' well, i'll be there! and, let's face it. i'm a hoot (haha). so, just find me. trust me, the music is worth it. be there."

i've got some errands to do. i think i'm going to goodwill later. anyone want to join? 

i might be getting a new phone today because mine has been royally broken for almost 2 months and i'm sick of it. 

i've got no plans tonight. i had plans. or i was supposed to. i guess they fell through? i don't know. if you want to do something, PLEASE call me. i'm desperate. 

i didn't really make a resolution... more of a i want to do this. i want to listen to all of my cds/records/tapes/etc. i feel guilty having all this great music and abandoning a good number of it. 

i also want to really start living the way i want to. i'm sick of just being this big shapeless ball of clay with no purpose or direction. i want to have something. do something. accomplish things and be happy. really happy. i want to read every book, listen to every song, talk to every person, go to every store, watch every movie, experience every city, live this life the right way. my way. finally. 

this year should be good, i think. finishing high school, ireland/europe, college, meeting new people, leaving other people, traveling, just being able to be young and be free and have all these opportunities. it's amazing. i'm really starting to appreciate what i have. i hope i like this year. i hope it turns out better than last year. not that last year was bad, just that i want every year to be better than the last. 

life really can be good."

anyone/everyone invited. i don't even care if you know me or not. tonight. hookah at king tut's. around 9ish. legal age is 18, but i'm sure we can work it out if you're close. 

give me a call for questions or whatever. 209-2674. if you just want to show up, fine. totally chill. it'll be fun. come if you want. 


it's only 1:30 and i've already worked for 5 hours, went shopping, and took a shower. wow. 

last night, stephen's old best friend, josh, came over. it was kinda odd. in a good way. stephen was friends with him from age 4 to about 16/17. so, technically, stephen has known josh longer than he's known me. his own sister. haha. i kinda grew up with josh as my 3rd older brother. last night was the first time i've seen him in, like, 6 years. he's married and has 2 kids! holy Lord! just thought i'd share. it was great to see him again. 


today ryan turns 25 years of age. i have a brother that is half a century old. why do i have such a hard time comprehending how much time has passed? is it because i've wasted most of it? i don't know. it's just so unbelievable to me. 





alright. 


peace. 


oh..... ps. i had a couple Bookman's trips this week. today i got a Japanese haiku book.

I love REM. It's like a magical fusion of Dylan and Bowie. Everybody Hurts is one of the most beautiful songs. The weird this is, I don't even enjoy it when ""depressed."" I enjoy it a hell of a lot more when I'm upbeat. Plus, it kinda reminds me of the 4 noble truths. Which is good.

It's almost Christmas break time. The break is well needed. And deserved. I've been super strapped for time. The only time I have free is on Saturdays and Sundays. And I'm sometimes busy on one and/or both of those days as well. I guess this is life? This is how the routine is going to work after school? Either that, or this is the worst of it. I don't know.

"event","something kinda strange just happened to me. i stopped for gas after work. i purchased my gasoline and the guy who i performed my transaction with said ""thanks kelly, see ya later."" unable to formulate words, i kinda stuttered ""uh.. thanks."" or something to that effect. i walked out and tried to figure out where i would know the guy from. he didn't look familiar to me at all. too old to go to school with me. too old to be a friend of my brothers'. too young to know my parents. maybe it was just my bad ears, but i'm almost positive that's what he said. i was kinda dumbfounded. 

my hands hurt. 

i got music back into my car. and chuck palahniuk's lullaby has made me feel guilty for it. but i did have a pretty rockin' dance party for one on the drive home from work. ok... and the drive to work. what can i say? how can you not dance when you have a soundtrack of hot hot heat?

i actually got into a ""fight"" last friday. this girly in my first hour is an idiot. i hate to use that term, but it's the best desciption. to say the least, she's the quintessential teasing/flirting/ignorant/negative/mean-hearted girl you all knew in high school. i've never actually yelled at someone. not seriously. and if you know how much i hate confrontation and how much i'm against yelling/fighting of any sort, you may be able to understand just how far this girl had to push my buttons. i think i've lost my intimidation. not that i was intimidated by this girl, but i've been a lot more.... i don't know how to word it..... defensive? not really. well, i've been a lot more of whatever lately. it kinda sucks. some people i used to look up to lost their luster. like the mystery is gone because i can actually see them on the same plane as me.......soooo... of course, i forgot about this girl 5 minutes later. in no way is she worth wasting my precious thoughts on. monday morning comes. she won't talk to me. she's afraid to look at me. the lengths she will go to avoid my presence is comical. it's sick that i find joy in her suffering. aw crap. now i feel bad. i tried to knock some sense into her. i think i lost her at the word hypocritical. that's about when she stopped trying. 

my brother, stephen, broke his finger playing his first scrimmage in this football league. luckily it's his left pinky, but it's completely bent. imagine grabbing your 2nd knuckle and bending it perpendicularly away from your hand. that's what it looks like. he has surgery tomorrow. 

i haven't seen ryan in a while. 

i'm just always cold anymore. my feet/hands haven't been warm since mid-october.

figured out a lot of stuff lately. i really really do think i'm a good person. although, i think i have a lot more good qualities than i utilize. i wasted so much time of my life imagining what life would be like if i possessed the talents of others. the things i would do if i could sing. the profound things i would write if i had an article in rolling stone. i've been over that for a while now. but now i need to focus on what i do have and how i can use those things to my advantage. maybe that will lead me to that missing element in my life. that thing that i just can never seem to find without looking. an obsession worth having. i've always wanted it. i've pretended as if i've had it before. it never works. i always come back to this personality. you can't choose an image. no matter what you do. i guess if you have the drive, you can convince yourself of it, but i'm just unable to do that. i always go right back to this. why do i try to change that? not that i have lately, but in the past. i struggled with image a lot a while back. now i really don't care. maybe i should. maybe it's best that i don't. the thing that fuels that wanting to have a specific image is some completely stereotyping. i see how i'm labeled now. it's not always good. not always bad either. but there are just these people that you see that you think ""oh, they are so cool. i want to be like that."" don't deny it. we've all done that at one time or another. so, you may try to be like that. try to receive the same labels and judgments that particular person/people receive. i've gone through that. done things and said things to try to formulate a stereotype that i felt suitable for me in other's minds. i'm just so done with that. it's so tiring. and it wastes so much time and energy. this is the mode i've been in for quite a while now. nothing new ever really happens. the thoughts i come up with aren't really of concern to other's because they aren't on the same level as me. not saying i'm higher. don't get me wrong. i will never say i'm better than any person. i'm not. they just aren't on the same level. lately i've been meeting people that i've actually been able to converse with about these topics. and i have to say it's extremely refreshing. i need more of that in my life. i'll always need more. you learn more from other people than you do from any other entity. the only thing negative about having people that you can relate to in your life is all other people seem to have become a bore. i struggle to make i through casual conversations. even with people i've known my whole life. fuck, even with my own family. it's almost like i'm a junkie for intelligence. i know i don't have much, so i try to find it anywhere i can because i want it, i love it, i crave it, i need it. 

geez, that was a rant and a half. i just caught myself. can you tell i haven't been writing lately? maybe you learned something? had a thought of your own? i'm sure you've heard it all before. 

the proceeding is the song i've had as the soundtrack to my inner monologue all day today. 

enjoy. 


People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one,
And we've only just begun.
Think I'm gonna have a son.
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove,
Conceived in love.
Sun is gonna shine above.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Seems as though, a month ago, I was Beta-Chi,
Never got high.
Oh, I was a sorry guy.
And now, I smile and face the girl that shares my name.
Now I'm through with the game.
This boy will never be the same.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Pisces, Virgo rising is a very good sign,
Strong and kind,
And the little boy is mine.
Now I see a family where the once was none.
Now we've just begun.
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup.
Drink it up.
Love her and she'll bring you luck.
And if you find she helps your mind, better take her home.
Don't you live alone.
Try to earn what lovers own.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright."

He's the last person I ever thought I'd be attracted to. Certainly the last person I SHOULD be attracted to. Oh well. I think I'm just wanting to have fun. And he kinda epitomizes that. I really don't even want a boyfriend.... not that I would turn one down if a good person came around. I don't LIKE anyone right now. Which is a first. I just want to have someone to hang with. And maybe kiss..... a lot. Because I'm kinda a slut when it comes to kissing, apparently. 


NO. 

So, my job rocks. I type for 6 hours. I can listen to music or books on tape or what have you the entire time. I can wear whatever. It's totally quiet. My hands and back start to hurt by the end of the day. But I like it. 

And I'm bored. 

And I still don't have plans for Saturday. If nothing else, I might hookah with Alex. But I really want to do something more crazy. I'm always so bored. People. Call me. Tell me what is going on and invite me. Something good. A party. A movie night. An orgy. Whatever. I'm too lazy to make these calls myself. You should know this.

"event","yesterday was interesting. it was really awesome or eh. i can't determine. started normal. after escuela i drove to phoenix by myself for the first time. it ended up being a waste. so, i was kinda bummed about not having a job and realizing just how much money i really want for upcoming events. i decided to stop by adecco and apply for temporary data entry jobs. i figured it couldn't hurt. it took about 2 hours to apply/take assessment tests. i rocked it out on those tests. and there was already a job available. $8.25/hr. 30 hours a week. and i still have weekends off. i start today. all i have to do is input date from one source into a computer. that's it. supposedly it's a real chill environment too. i'm pretty excited about it. and it's only temporary, so if i really loathe it, i can quit and adecco will try to find another job for me. what a sweet setup. so, after that i helped with guitars again. it's so funny how much high school kids love drama. not all of them, of course. but it seems like a good majority. these kids i worked with last night only want to talk about it. drama i'm not even in. it's weird. but we still had fun. paint fumes make cory and i giggly. then i had to go purchase work clothes last night. 

i guess it really doesn't sound that interesting. it was just unusual for me because i normally don't do anything and yesterday i was home maybe an hour max all day. and now i'm going to be gone the majority of most of my days. strange. something i'm not used to in the least. a working stiff. ugh. i'm excited, but i fear what is to come. 

and i saved this part for last..... the greatest part of my day. nay. month. FRIDAY. MARCH 31. GLENDALE ARENA. LEGENDARY. QUEEN + PAUL RODGERS CONQUERS ARIZONA. THE BAND THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MUSIC IN MY LIFE. I CANNOT EVEN FUCKING BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!! NO, IT'S NOT THE SAME WITHOUT FREDDIE. AND THAT SADDENS ME GREATLY. BUT, LET'S FACE IT, THIS IS THE CLOSEST I'M GONNA GET. THE PLAY WAS PRETTY DAMN CLOSE. BUT TO SEE BRIAN MAY AND ROGER TAYLOR PLAY QUEEN SONGS! OH MY GOD!!!! when i heard this fabulous news on the radio last night, i hyperventilated for the first time in my life. i can't contain myself. i still can't. tickets go on sale saturday. i have no idea what the price will be. i don't even know who i'm going with. my mom actually said she wanted to go. other than that, anyone is welcome to join. i'll provide a ride. in freddie, of course. so... yeah, freddie mercury will be there. in automobile form. i'm so excited, you can't even imagine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

go tell everyone, i know you want to. 

and wish me luck on my new job. 

and i want to do something fun this weekend. give me a call if you have something for me to join in on.

"event","""If Jesus Christ had died in prison, with no one watching and with no one there to mourn or torture him, would we be saved?.... The biggest factor that makes you a saint is the amount of press coverage you get.... You can't believe you're a slave to this body, this big baby. You have to keep it fed and put it to bed and take it to the bathroom. You can't believe we haven't invented something better. Something not so needy. Not so time-consuming. You realize that people take drugs only because it's the only real personal adventure left to them in their time-constrained, law-and-order, property-lined world. It's only in drugs and death we'll see anything new, and death is just too controlling. You realize that there's no point in doing anything if nobody is watching. You wonder, if there had been a low turnout at the crucifixion, would they have rescheduled?""

""Since change is constant, you wonder if people crave death because it's the only way they can get anything really finished.""

Both from Survivor- Palahniuk. 


Been thinking a lot lately. I've come to realize that the way things were is almost over. My environment that I've been inundated with for 18 years is outdated. Yes, I've been telling myself I was ready to leave for... oh.... 6? years now. Something like that. But I've never really been ready till now. Now I realize that I've had it good. I had a nice solid life here. But nothing's been new for a long time. I may miss some stuff, but I know I have memories. And I'm okay with that. Life shouldn't be constant, like it always has been. I should have to deal with tragedy. I never really have. I should have to fail, and lose, and be really lonely. I've had a taste of these, but never really experienced it. I feel really aweful, but I crave having these bad feelings. I want to be sad, because I've never had it before. I see how much I've learned from the little bit of sadness I've felt, and I want more. I'm so sick of this frame of mind. This constant waiting. Here comes that quote that I can't get out of my mind. ""Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans"" - Lennon. I want to have a life and I want to share it with people who are just as unsure as I am. I don't want to constantly feel lower than anyone, nor feel higher. I don't want people to kiss my ass, and I don't want to feel obligated to kiss anyone's. I just want to be natural. It's the things in my life that I can't necessarily explain why I like them that I cherish the most. The moment I can completely define something, it loses it's flavor. Not saying I don't think about things. I do. Probably too much. Take music. I can give you a million reasons why I like the music I like and why I listen to what I do, but I can't write down what the crescendo in Bohemian Rhapsody does to me. I can try to put words on it. Limit it. But I'll never capture that feeling. I know I'm not the only person to ever appreciate music. I'm not that naive. But it's things like that. So personal. So unexplainable. So amazing. Those little, natural things just make life worth trying. 

It's funny how I think I've come to know so much. Learn so much. But really, I know less now than I did before. The more I learn, the less I know. The more limits I put on things. Experience is the only true education. I haven't had enough of that. Maybe that's why I'm so horrible at debating. All I know I've heard. The only things I'm passionate about are the things that I discovered myself. The things I thought about before I talked about. I appreciate people, I really do. Don't mistake this, but I'm going to stop listening so much. That's not true. I'll listen to things as much as I do now, but I may not take it as truth. 

I haven't been entertained in weeks. I haven't been happy in months. 

Someday you'll die. Have you ever really thought about that? Sure, everyone has thought that. Everyone ""knows"" that. But have you ever imagined the pain that you will endure just a few breaths away from death. When you no longer chose to be living. That privelage is taken. Have you pictured yourself pail? In a coffin? Have you been to your funeral? Not a funeral, YOUR funeral. What will people remember? Will they remember all the things you think you've accomplished? Have you really accomplished anything? Will the pictures they show as a memorial be the ones you think you look good in? Does it matter? What if no one mourns as much as you think they should? What if your wife/husband starts dating sooner than you think they are ready? What if you don't have a wife or husband? What if your last words aren't something that you deem respectable? I'm sorry. This isn't supposed to be a downer. I just see that I've never actually thought about me dying before. I know I'll die, but I've never known death. I don't really want to. It's not something that I can predict or imagine or fear. At least no one has ruined death yet. No one's told me what it'll be like. I'm glad. It'll be a surprise. That's always nice. It puts me at ease."

Here's the pictures from my NY/NJ excursion a couple weeks ago. 
I was in charge of the camera. And I take some random pictures. There weren't very many interesting ones. This is the best of the bunch. Enjoy.

We started mid-Friday in Central Park. 
That's Ryan, Kendal, Stephen, My Madre, and Me

Of course, we had to revisit the Lennon memorial. Someone formed a peace sign out of flowers and outlined the ""imagine"" in strawberries.

We started walking and passed the Dakotas. 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/weeniebeenie3/2ad5035d.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Here's the site of Lennon's murder. The old doorman was yelling at me. 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/weeniebeenie3/73618fef.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Off we go. Right to Times Square.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/weeniebeenie3/2b202550.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

My mom and Stephen.

We met the Naked Cowboy. He must've been freezing, but I think he's used to it. He was still packin'

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/weeniebeenie3/d413fd21.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

We then walk to Greenwich Village. 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/weeniebeenie3/005f8009.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Me, my dad, and Stephen

Pigeon

Then we went to Soho. My mecca. 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/weeniebeenie3/21b0867e.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

This mural was actually 3x larger than this. 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/weeniebeenie3/fdfee23e.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

The next day we met my cousin Kayla for the first time. 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/weeniebeenie3/0a7a6dd0.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Then we saw my godfather/my dad's best friend, ""Uncle"" Steve.

Aren't my parents cute? This is the spot of one of their first dates ""back in the day""

And there was a bunch of other crap that went on in-between. We had a family reunion type thing. Saw all my back east fam that I don't see very often. Fun times. I love New York. I can't wait to go back.

"event","did anyone else watch that mark david chapman special last night? it was interesting and all, but it made me completely livid. this loser who was never able to amount to anything articulated a murder of an icon and inspiration instead of trying to change himself. he clearly has no remorse or guilt at all. i honestly don't even think he's crazy. i think that was just a method for him to gain some amount of sympathy. yes, i did find out some things from that piece. i really didn't even know much about chapman except that he committed this heinous crime. so it was educational in that element. but i don't think it should've been shown. that was just giving more fame to a man that honestly doesn't deserve any (and just in time for sweeps week. hmm... interesting). they focused way too much on how ""troubled"" this guy thought he was. what a terrible upbringing he had and all the harsh treatment he had to endure. many people have to deal with much worse shit. no one is given anything they can't overcome. he just took the easy route and felt sorry for himself. he placed the blame on anyone but himself. gee whiz. it makes me pissed. i even hate that i'm wasting time thinking about this bloke. 

went job hunting today. i applied at a couple of places. i really don't want to do retail, but it's hard to find anything but. i have an interview for hot topic on monday. i know i'm not a huge fan of the store, but the people seemed really cool, and it would only be seasonal. and it would be okay if i got my piercing. in fact, it may be encouraged. i think next semester i may float around jobs. maybe just some data input or something. just rack up some dough before ireland/college. 

went to goodwill today. 50% off day. got some bitchin stuff for super cheap. stoked. 

they've had a project runway marathon on bravo all day. woo! jay is the best. by far. i can't wait for the next season. how sad. 

i've felt very artsy lately. i like that. 

it's almost thanksgiving!!!! i can't wait. the food. the fam. the grinch. all very good. then it really feels like christmas. i've got to start doing my shopping. i don't know what i'm getting anyone yet. i should probably get on that. 

i am extremely comfortable with where i am right now. and i'm comfortable with where i'm going. 



toodles, bitches."

"event","is it just me, or is it fucking amazing how once you've got a thought in your head, it appears EVERYWHERE!? i know this is just one of those brain things that once you are clued in on something, your mind just notices it more, but still! i had 2 excellent conversations today (which doesn't happen much) and both revolved around this one thing. and it wasn't me who initiated the thought in either. i love that. i feel like i'm doing something right, for once. i feel like i'm on the right track again. this whole ""stuck in a rut"" thing that i've had for the past 2 weeks might actually be lifting. and i'm proud of the way i handled it. as angry as i got, i'm still happy because i accepted the suffering (the first noble truth) and i've grown from it. such a feeling of accomplishment was developed from a long period of completely lack of accomplishment. ironic. 

so, there is this kid i now sit next to in trig. i've had him in classes before. nice enough kid. never really spoke with him. today we talked for an hour straight. i'm not saying i ever thought he was stupid. i never thought about him at all, actually. i was just surprised to find such an amazingly intelligent person. just when i start to get down on people and think that i give people way too much credit. they seem show up when i'm not expecting it or looking for it. i love that! i actually learned something from this kid. that influence always seems to be lacking in my life. i'm still a student. completely. as much as i think i've been able to learn on my own, i'm always looking for things to spark new thoughts. and he did this. very well. that just made my day. i wish more people were like this. i still have hope. 

ryan lent me the original episodes of the office. so i've been watching that constantly the last couple days. so hilarious! i love the american version, but nothing tops english humor. it's kinda wierd because now my 2 favorite shows are just 2 different versions of the same show. he also lent me survivor by chuck palahniuk. amazing. i'm in love with chuck palahniuk. 

i have to go to school tonight to paint guitars for my manufacturing class. i really love this class. and i love our project. so, in a couple weeks, we will be selling these clocks in the shape of a guitar. they are pretty badass. $30. let me know if you want one. i may even be able to do a special color for you, if you let me know early enough. i'm head of advertising, so i'm sure you'll be seeing flyers and pictures of them soon enough. unfortunately, we don't have many to sell and i know that everyone is gonna want to buy one. yeah. awesome. 

this was a random entry. that's fun."

"event","yesterday was odd.

i saw my first scary movie last night. saw II. it probably wasn't a good idea. i saw it at a point where i've never felt more unstable in my life. i hadn't consumed anything but hummus, a piece of bread, coffee, water, and cigarettes all day. i thought i was gonna hurl before the movie started. then there was all this gore, which i normally don't mind. it was just not good. the movie itself actually wasn't all that bad. the concept was cool and it wasn't really that scary. it was just bad timing. 

i had a very interesting dream last night. 

i still feel like shit. i just want to be over this. i can't eat. i can't sleep. i can't do anything right. i'm shaky. i'm nervous. i'm sad. i'm disgusting. i smell bad. i'm lonely. i have a headache. i'm bored. i'm annoyed. i'm in a rut. i'm brain dead. i can't think straight. or at all. i hate this. i need someone who is better than me consistantly in my life again. i need to learn from someone. i think i give people too much credit. i hope this isn't it. i hope things change. somehow. 

have you ever just had this overwhelming yearn to rebel? to just have fun and try to make some regrets? no inhibitions? that's how i feel right now. maybe i'm just looking for something new and that's something i've never been able to do. but i want to. 

i've been thinking about getting my eyebrow pierced. how out of left field is that?

something is definately wrong with me. lately i've just been in this really bad place. and i can't get rid of it without suppressing. i'm just kinda lost. i hate it. it seems like no matter what i try, it doesn't work. at all. it's starting to affect more than just my mental stage. my physical body has been run down and hurt recently too. no matter how much sleep i get, i'm always tired and weak. i've never had to go through this before. i'm not at an all time low where i can feel horrible for a day or 2 and bounce back. it's like this thing that has just been lingering for weeks. and it doesn't feel like it's going away any time soon. but with each day it stays, i take another step backwards. my recent increase in outside responsibilities isn't helping much, either. i feel like i owe all these people my time, but it's all the people that i don't really want to spend time with. and the few people i do want to spend time with apparently don't want to spend time with me. or at least they never make an effort, and i'm done with chasing and being desperate. i can't do that. i'm sick of doing things because i feel like i have to. i'm sick of being rejected of the things i want to do. i'm sick of feeling like this and having to keep it all inside and just letting it accumulate more and more. 

i feel like i've lied to everyone i've talked to in the past couple weeks soley because i wasn't accurately portraying how i felt. it's amazing how a simple smile or nod or ""oh, yeah?"" can carry conversations with various people for weeks. that amazes me. i barely have to say a word. oh, but that's okay. they think i'm ""back to normal."" like a tape recorder. i just listen. but i never hear."

"event","so, today sucks. a lot. woke up this morning after only 4 hours of sleep. felt like shit. decided to take the day off. just felt disgusting all day. got yelled at. then comes time for volleyball. stress level raises because parents don't know how to shut up. it's understandable, completely. it's just annoying. my team leaves for our game at gene autry park. me and 2 other girls leave about 20 minutes later. so, 95% of my team gets there and is ready to play. i show up and there are cops and emergency vehicles and the whole nine yards surrounding the place. i guess sometime in that 20 minute span between when my team arrived and i arrived a plane crashed in the parking lot. now i've got angry/concerned parents yelling at me. and i couldn't do a thing. i tried sneaking into the park to fix everything with my team, but they caught me. so, i had to wait for a good hour or so just to make sure all my girls were safe. thank God they were. but that adds another hour or 2 onto my stuff to do tomorrow. finally get home from that and got yelled at some more. i just feel so blah. apathetic to the max. my head hurts. my body hurts. just.... yuck. 

my entire day has just been one of those ""i need a hug"" moments. 
at least stephen and michele have soccer tonight. so i've got the house to myself for the next couple of hours. at least this time will be stress free... i hope."

"event","had my final (hopefully) SAT test today. it wasn't nearly as bad as it was in the past. i think i just didn't care this time. came home from that and napped for 4 hours. now i'm here. i've gotten a couple offers to go out tonight, i just really don't have the energy. i feel like i should, but i know i wouldn't have fun because i feel like crap. 

mark and i saw the weather man last night. it was really interesting. kinda strange, but i really enjoyed it. it was a good portrayal of a very tortured soul. the best part: nicolas cage is trying to remember tarter sauce when he goes to pick up food for his family and you can hear his thoughts. it's not like ""don't forget it,"" but more like every damn random thing that pops into his head. just random. it's pretty sweet. i think there should be an independant movie like that. like, a typical day in the life of a suit with omnicient narrations. 

my computer is fucked up. 

i'm bored. 

i keep waiting for someone to rescue me. either no one has even tried or no one can. i'm not sure yet.

"event","Okay, now I'm stuck on this natural concept. From now on, I just want to live life the way seems most natural. I'm sick of trying to force things into my life and into my mind for whatever reason (coolness, perfection, whatever). This includes people. Trying to force any relationship to work seems completely pointless to me. There is truly only one person that I absolutely don't want to let go of. Everyone else, I could care less. Which is sad, but it's true. In the book I'm currently in the middle of, there is a fake religion that believes we are all part of different groups called a karass.  A karass is basically the group of people that you have in your life that are just meant to be there. They, in some way, affect you and better you, and vice versa. Basically naturally selected groups. For instance, I would consider my entire family part of my karass because I didn't choose them or force them to spend time with me at all. There are a couple of friends that I see in my karass. A couple teachers. And a couple of random people. People that I never planned on and would never wish for, but just happen. They are just there and I've learned something from them. I love that whole organic idea. 

I want my life to be like that from now on. I'm so sick of trying to be something I'm not. and I'm so sick of dwelling on the actions of other people. I'm done with depending on people. Things should just come naturally. If I call you or ask you to hang out, it's should almost be surprising because I'm done with chasing after relationships. I'm only going to spend time with people I want to spend time with. I don't care if this makes you sad. You are completely welcome to contact me, and there is a pretty good chance I will indulge you in a conversation, at the least. I'm just done chasing. I really don't care. I know that there are people out there I can get along with, but trying to find them hasn't worked so far. If I just simply live, these people will come into my life. And i will appreciate them all the more and be more willing to try to help them in anyway I can. That's what all this frustration is stemming from. I just want to live life. That's it, but there seems to be obstacles I can't move around without becoming frustrated. The biggest of these being my own mental block. I spent my entire life building a wall around me that defined exactly what I was and what I was to become. Most of that wall was taken from outside sources. It really sucks to realize that I need to tear that down and start from square one. 

There are little things a lot of us assume we know. Definitions of feelings and thoughts and words that we base a good part of our life on. My most recent would be caring. I thought I knew what caring was, but what I thought caring was was giving a person what they said they wanted. What the fuck? It seems so retarded to me now. That entire concept has to be completely rebuilt in my mind. And it doesn't stop there. Oh no. It's everything. This isn't a self discovery thing anymore. I'm not worried about find what or who I am. I am that, so why do I need to define it? I just need to figure out where my priorities are and just take life as it comes. There is no use in planning every detail to life when you don't know what obstacles are going to come about. I believe we all have that natural roller coaster effect. We have our ups and downs, et cetera, et cetera. Well, why plan when you don't know when those are going to come about? I'm not saying give up on your future and goals. Set goals and work towards them. It's just stupid to put things off 'til then, or to expect those things to be given. 

Shit. I always catch myself doing stream of conscious on livejournal. I'm sorry. My mind has been in a million places today. And I like it. 

To make this an official stereotypical post, I will put the following...

10 years ago:
1. I was 8
2. I discovered Bohemian Rhapsody for the first time
3. I was in 2nd grade, and loved it
4. I thought I was the end all be all definition of awesome
5. I was on a soccer team. Yeah, I don't know why either

5 years ago:
1. I was 13 
2. I was obsessed with Backstreet Boys
3. I still thought I was awesome
4. I had braces
5. I was incredibly and obsessively boy crazy 

1 year ago:
1. I separated from a group of people that I now wish I had taken more time with. No regrets, but I think I could've learned some more and taught a lot more
2. I still drove Larry the rockmobile
3. I was a lot more obsessed with Catholicism than I realized
4. I was straightedge
5. The person I am now would've kicked my ass

Yesterday:
1. I reacquainted with some old friends and discovered through example that judging based on the past and living in the past is completely odious
2. I learned a John Denver song on guitar
3. I bought new shoes for the first time in almost 2 years
4. I found out that my phone number on a cell phone is C+W - AMPE. And Rachel's is WOW - AMDU. So that's good.
5. I found out that kids under the age of 17 will do anything to bum a cigarette.... and it's all based on image

2. Most Foo Fighters songs
3. Bezel - Batter the Drag
4. No Rain - Blind Melon

and sooooo many others.... how can you limit that to 5?

If I had a Million dollars:
1. Buy my parents a nice house in New Mexico
2. Probably take my GED and get a house in northern California
3. Pay for college in northern California
4. Probably invest some
5. Fuck 1-4. I'm carrying out my dream and buying a sweet dream record store. It'll be big enough for me to live in. Haha

3. 
4. 
5. 

Favorite TV shows:

2. Simpsons
3. Inside the Actor's Studio
4. The Office
5. Project Runway (It's coming back, people)

5 bad habits:
1. Depending on others for my own justifications
2. Conforming
3. Wasting my potential
4. Wasting time
5. Comparing

5 BIGGEST joys:
1. Reforming
2. Real conversations
3. Equality
4. Realizing what it is to live before half my life is gone
5. Learning

I tag:
1. Anyone that wants to waste their time.... as I just did
2. 
3. 
4."

"event","yesterday was F-U-N. met lots of new people. got a lot of new clothes. felt normal again. 

nissa and i met this band on mill last night. they were a bluegrass band. it was their first time playing, so it was mainly just covers. really good though. they said they'll probably play there again next weekend. so next saturday night (maybe), everyone should go to mill. right in front of hippie gypsy. they go by well oiled machine. very cool stuff. oh.... they have a myspace with some tunes. www.myspace.com/bluegrassmachine. tell 'em kelly sent you. it might mean something. 

yeah. so, things are fairly decent. i'm feeling in control a little more. getting more and more comfortable in my own skin. still feel completely trapped, but i think i can get around it. at least for the next few months. it's not worth making a fuss now and just adding more crap to the mix. i might as well just let it ride. everything else is really splendid. well.... progressing well, i should say. i don't think things will be really amazing until i really develop and can meet some people that i feel comfortable with. whatever, i'm rambling.

"event","why am i awake so early? i've been up since 7 and i fell asleep at 1:30?! odd. i hate waking up early on days that i have no plans because it just causes the lost day to last forever. i need to escape from this house. in some way, shape, or form today. it is just a bad place to be right now. everyone's energy is so low. the animosity is so thick. and because my family is ruled by the unsaid, it all just lingers for days until they supress it. drives me crazy. really startin to get to me. everytime i try to break the chain and actually say what i think to them, they don't respond at all. they just assume that i'm angry or hate them, but don't say anything. shouldn't this be the perfect time to say something? i don't care that they don't even try to ""know me."" i'm over that. i just wish they would try to know themselves. this ""live life because you have to"" mode is tiring. same thing for decades. i can't stand it. the worst part is that i can't do anything. they all think i'm a complete nut case and should be institutionalized. so, why would they listen to me? i'm living ryan's life all over again, but not to the same extreme. no wonder we've been getting closer. either way, they still don't know how to handle it. not that i'm hard to handle. i'm not at all. i'm extremely easy going and accepting, considering. they had time to prepare for me. the past few years it's all been brewin, but they never noticed.... or tried to ignore it. that's probably more accurate. the one sentence my mom has said to me everytime i make a substantial change in my life is ""just don't get weird, kelly."" i swear. don't get weird? i started liking rock music. ""don't get weird."" i started going out on weekends. ""don't get weird."" i wanted to go to public school. ""don't get weird."" i started dating a kid that had black hair and wasn't a holy roller (unheard of, i know). ""don't get weird."" i started reading books that were more than a plot on pages. ""don't get weird."" i started watching movies that didn't always contain comic situations. ""don't get weird."" they flood me with what was to try to keep my mind at bay. it worked. for a while. my head hurts. i guess i'll just take a day for myself. i'll go to some thrift stores, maybe the library. just remove myself from this place. it seems best. tonight will be the hardest. 

excuse my shit. i make this sound a lot worse than it probably really is. i'm just fed up and looking for an outlet. don't give me pity. give me solutions. give me help. help me escape.

i fear that i'm right back to square one, but i now know how bad it truly is."

"event","i just got back from california. had a good time. amoeba is heaven. i wish i had thought to bring the digital camera. i finally got some les savy fav, suzanne vega, mike watt, and some more sondre lerche. and i found the greatest restaurant. it was in the universal studios city walk. it's called tu tu tango cafe. oh man. if you get the chance to go there, i highly recommend. saw a live taping of joey. that was pretty neat. now i'm home and bored. i'm supposed to call, like, 4 people, but i'm too lazy. those people should come to me so i don't have to make the effort. 

tomorrow is a homework day, which blows. then a regular week of school. next weekend is the whole final higley ranch party, i guess. i'm not sure yet. have to ask the hermano, but i want to go. it should be a blast. then new jersey. then november. i love this time of the year. i really really really do."

"event","i actually feel really hurt. i've never felt this terrible in my life. i would say depressed, but i think that's too over the edge. too dramatic. and not only is it that i'm hurt and sad and all this, but i don't have a fucking thing i can do about it. i tried distracting myself. that worked for a couple days. got lost in mindless television, movies, books, internet. but that only works for so long. and it really didn't work at all. it just delayed it 'til today. i tried getting myself out of the house a little. didn't work. i tried talking to my family. didn't work. i tried cleaning my room. didn't work. i've been taking yoga classes, which makes me feel better, but then i just go right back to the way i was the next day. i probably just need to get it all out and talk with someone and just get it over with, but who? who do i turn to now? i don't have friends. i don't have aquaintances. i don't have jackshit. i've got a livejournal. how pathetic. 

i wish i could just cry and move on. the worst part about all this is that i had just begun feeling really really amazing. i really think i'm a great person and i started setting goals and having fun and just being myself. i was carefree and thinking straight. and meditating. i love to meditate now. nothing beats a long stroll while meditating right after the sun goes down. the weather is perfect now too. this feeling is just holding me back. this is the last thing i want to do. i'm wasting my time. i just want to be that person i was being. now i feel like crap. i can make myself feel better. i can do it right now, but that's called supressing and that would be a major step backwards. and it's never really gone if i do that... again. that's probably what all this is. 18 years of supressing every single feeling i've ever had is starting to catch up with me. and it wouldn't have if i didn't start realizing that it's stupid to supress anything and it's stupid to live life for anyone but yourself. i know this now. but those lost years of living for other people, it's just taken it's toll. 

i guess this would be the proper time to add in the cliche ""no one understands."" but everyone understands. i hate being in this rut because i don't know what to do to get out of it. i know the way i would've gotten out of it in the past, but as i just explained, that's worthless. ok, so new frame of mind, new tactic. i should have one for this. i have an answer. i have a solution. i just can't figure it out. it's all i think about anymore. my entire life lately has been jeopardized by the thought of ""what now?"" i can't hold a conversation past small talk. i can't pay attention. i can't listen. i can't communicate. i can't do anything. i guess this all had to happen eventually. and, as buddha said, we all suffer. i know this and i accept it. i'm okay with suffering. i'm learning a lot from it, actually. it just hurts and it's holding me back and i'm frustrating. i need to scream. i need to cry. i need......... someone. something. anything. maybe i'll try taking another walk. i think i need to experience this awful feeling to it's fullest. i can't just get over it. i need to hurt. i don't want to. God! i soo don't want to. but it's all i've got left. not feeling it is not learning. and that's not living. at this second, i just really wish i had someone to help me through this. and i fear that i know no one can and no one will. i need to do this myself. once again, i don't want to. but no one else will. 

and who else matters in my life but me? i need to figure out my own shit now before i continue to ruin my relationship with others. i just recently did that, and that's a big reason for all this hurt. i fucked up. and i would do anything to be able to fix it. i really would. that's another thing i can't help thinking. is there anything i can do to fix things? anything at all? why do i have to make this all so hard? it should be easy. 

i'm going to go walk. i have my phone with me, so feel free to call.... please, i'm desperate here. i'm sure the distraction will be well received."

"event","it's finally the weekend. and i have nothing to do. i don't really want to go out right now, i'm too tired. 

lately i've felt extremely trapped. well, by lately i mean the past year, or so. like i can't seem to get away. i want to. right now i'm really set on just going up north. anyone interested in joining me? i really want to just drive away for a weekend. unfortunately my next free weekend isn't until the first week of november. oh well. i really want to go. seriously... does anyone want to go on that adventure with me? it'll be fun! i hope! it doesn't even have to be up north. it can be anywhere, really. i just like it there because it's cool. plus, i'd have a few connections if we decided to stay overnight. 

i get in these moods where i just want to go meet people. like, really really badly. but i don't have any friends now to help me meet people or go places with to meet people. it looks kinda strange just being alone. and it's not even just meeting people, it's trying new things. i'm so sick of monotony. i just want to go crazy and just.... i don't know.... go do something different. but, once again, i have no one to indulge this with. i'm really not trying to lay a pity party on everyone. this is just normal. and i'm also not trying to get people to call me or whatever. i wouldn't expect a livejournal post to inspire anything like that. especially out of pity. i'm just bored and ranting. 

i think tonight i'll clean my room, read my new book (Dharma Bums by Kerouac. absolutely stunning!!! that's what i want. a Kerouac adventure!!!), and watch American History X. because that movie is the shit.

"event","my brother just gave me the new batter the drag recordings. they are rough mixes, of course, because they aren't even done recording yet, but they are still amazing. best lyric by far ""my father, the hunter, found God in his guns."" ryan swears it's not about my dad, but come on! how more dead on can you be!!!! a) that's the only biological father ryan has b) my dad is an avid hunter and used to drag ryan on hunting excursions as a child c) my dad is strongly religious, but i doubt he has a valid belief in his existance. so, yeah. i love it. which is not a very good daughterly thing to say. shame on me. oh.... batter the drag is playing this saturday night at the real bar in tempe. all ages. i think it's $5 for all 21+ and $7 for us young ones. wes is back to play bass for this set. so that's awesome. the only other band playing that i know is stereotyperider. i hear they are awesome and have quite a little following. plus this is for the edge saturday night show dealy, so it should be a decent show. i'm going, anyone let me know if you need a ride or anything. 

today is my birthday. i'm 18... according to the ceasar's calendar, at least. it's kindof a crummy birthday because i had school, this afternoon i'm doing some stuff for work and school, and i'm doing some slight job hunting. exciting. but, it really doesn't matter. i've been extremely content lately and life has been pretty good, ironically. yesterday was one of the most productive days i've ever had, which is funny because i stayed home all day. but it was good. i enjoyed myself. 

how is everybody else doing? i barely ever actually see people from livejournal anymore. that's sad. let me know what's up and maybe call me to make some plans. i hate not seeing people."

"event","i only went to school for half of the day today. i was sick to my stomach. i highly doubt it is an actual medical condition and am leaning towards the theory of it just being my stomach in knots. i feel like i obliviously dug my own grave, but there is nothing i can do to fix it. nothing at all. which makes it worse because i can't even blame myself properly. i think i could come up with a solution and some realizations and lessons out of this if i could blame myself, but at this point, i just don't know. i'm playing the waiting game, which i loathe. so much. i just want to curl up in a ball and cry right now, but what would that solve. i really honestly don't think there is anything i can do to make this any better. or worse, for that matter. i just have to say what i think and hope it turns out okay. i just don't want to be the reason anyone is unhappy. that, in turn, would make me even more unhappy. then everyone is just unhappy. that does nothing. i'm selfish. i need to be happy. i do. having you around would maintain this, but having you around for all the wrong reasons and unwillingly would completely demolish this even moreso. ugh!!!! i know i shouldn't be whining on fucking livejournal about all this crap, but i just need an outlet. i've been writing so much today. it just doesn't seem to work. i want to talk to someone, but no one would understand. no one knows. i just wish there was something i could do. even if i ended up getting fucked over in the end, if i at least helped a little or contributed to his life in someway, i could get a decent night's sleep. but no. i feel like a failure. if this was it, i would just turn out looking like a low life who loved and lost and that's it. i don't think i would deserve anything more. 

i keep thinking about where i would be had i never met him. would i be better off? worse? the exact same? all i know is that i would be a lot more content with my life. content due to ignorance. because, the truth of the matter is, ignorance IS bliss. however, ignorance is also ignorance, and that's just bull. i see that now. i just wish i could know it. live it. having a false sense of self is shit. that's pretty much all my life has been. i always considered myself ""undefineable."" but really, i had defined my self so well that it was just more complicated. i had details worked out in my sick little mind that carefully crafted who i thought i was, and i was damn good at keeping that up. i was a wave of movie quotes, book quotes, lyrics, unexamined theories, and God knows what else. bottom line, i was not original. nor am i now. originality is not the goal now. it was, and i thought i had achieved it, but it was all false. it was all a mask. and i deeply appologize to those of you that i hurt while in that state. my thinking i knew all and convincing you of that and manipulating you to following me was wrong. i know that and i think that is why i had separated myself to the degree that i did. i subconsiously knew something wasn't right and i was holding everyone back. i now have a little bit more sense and would be an amazing influence (and would be greatly influenced) to you all, but it's too late. i screwed myself over. it seems it's what i do best. as selfish as i think i am, i'm really not at all. my whole life i've lived for other people, but not the way you do. i live to please other people. satisfy in that moment. i don't get any recognition because i really don't deserve any. i'm the person you walk on because they are always there and you just can. the one you ask do to the stuff you don't want to do, but never say thanks. they won't mind. that's me. i'm a pushover. i want to see other people happy, but don't know truly how to do that because i have not truly achieved it myself. will i ever? i really don't know. i'd like to. i know i can slip right back into that naive state and convince myself that i am, but knowing what i know now.... i think it'll be a little more difficult than i can comprehend. 

Oh God! that image. it just came back. i only hope she understands how special she is to receive such thought from you. even if nothing panned out between you guys, she's gotta know what she means to you. 

i think i'm over analyzing this. i think everything will be alright. i think this is just a big mess that needs to be worked out. i think in the past few sentences, the word think should be replaced with hope. because that's all it is. i don't want to have hope in something i can't control. i can't stand that. i can't deal with the fact that i may be compromised based on something i can't control. that thought hurts. a lot. OH GOD! i need to stop. i just realized, once again, that this is livejournal. how pathetic i can be. i need something and it's not sympathy."

"event","computer has been fixed. that's always good. 
today was weird. nothing too out of the ordinary happened, but it was weird. and i'm scared of what tonight will bring. 
i feel like i should be really depressed right about now. like there's something that someone is hiding from me. i don't know what or who or anything, i just have a strange feeling. i kinda feel empty. i don't even know anymore. it's extremely odd. the only comparison i can make would be when you want to cry and feel obliged to cry, but you don't. you just can't seem to do it even though it seems right. that's how i feel, but there is no reason for this. not that i know of, at least. i guess i feel a little guilty and i know this will increase in the coming hours. however, i have been in a much better frame of mind as of late. actually listening and being more open. dismounting my high horse a little bit more. 

i wish there were more to report. there really isn't. 
this weekend should be fun. i hope. 

foo fighters/weezer next wednesday. still got an open ticket. 



Oh, and because I'm a joiner........

Fill it out
1.Who are you?

2. Are we friends?

3. When and how did we meet?

4. Do you have a crush on me?

5. Would you kiss me?

6. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it.

7. Describe me in one word.

8. What was your first impression?

9. Do you still think that way about me now?

10. What reminds you of me?

11. If you could give me anything what would it be?

12. How well do you know me?

13. When's the last time you saw me?

14. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't?

15. Are you going to put this on your blog and see what I say about you?"

"event","so, my computer is currently down and will probably be for quite some time. tragic, i know. actually, i really don't care. i almost prefer it. the first couple days are always a little strange though. for some reason, i always feel like i'm missing out on something important? really, what's so important that someone would only try to contact me via internet?! use a phone. heck, do the absolutely crazy thing and write me a letter! do you know how much fun it is to receive letters? personal mail at all? it's sad that that outlet is almost completely erased. i think i'm going to sit down and write a letter to all the people i haven't seen in a long time next time i think about going on the internet to waste time. that would be fun. i encourage all to do the same. so, if for some reason you need to contact me and you've tried email or myspace or livejournal or whatever, and i haven't responded, go get yourself a pen and paper, stalk me and find out what my address is, and write a nice, long, friendly letter. or just call. either way is cool. 

other than that, life is pretty standard. school is same ol' same ol'. my birthday is coming up really fast. like, a couple weeks. insanity!!!! i love my birthday!!!! i'm so excited and will not stop talking about it until it is october 4th because that's just how i do. foo fighters/weezer show is really soon, but i'm not even excited about it that much anymore. as of right now, i've got 3 tickets and i'm the only one going. kevin didn't seem interested. although his ticket is still completely open!!!! hint hint! i want him to go the most. and that leaves me with one other ticket. up for grabs. i'll sell it cheap. i just want a little bit of spending cash for merch. maybe a shirt. that's it. so, yeah, i'm a little down about that, actually. i wish it would work out and i would have plans so i don't have to go ballistic last minute. i'm sure ryan would go, but i'd feel it would be out of brotherly obligations and not out of excitement. plus, he'd probably just criticise weezer's musicality or how foo fighters have lost their independant ""edge."" i am very aware that both of these things are true... i'm also very aware that i am not a music critic in the least and i just want to have some fun to some crappy music i adore sooooo much. plus, it's flippin dave grohl! and rivers cuomo! and pat wilson! and all my other little icons! this is the kind of stupid crap i live for. well, maybe not that far. 

here's a question... what's a soul? is it a manufacturing center for feelings? is it an area for self awaredness to be birthed? is it emotions? is it just a huge cliche that everyone thinks they know exactly what it is and just pretends to know? is it a word that was created to make us explain what we can't? is it a scare tactic? i honestly don't know. i continue to think that i've been lied to my whole life and somehow i have to determine what i really think is to be truth or just plain shit. how can you come up with such huge decisions when all you have to base on is the original whatever it is you were told? do i really know anything? i don't think so. do i really need to know anything? i don't think so. i've gotten this far. 

so, my head hurts. my job is grueling. ughhh.... 2 hours a week? are you kidding with this? smell the sarcasm. it's bitter. i'm now sick of rambling at on livejournal while sitting at a computer at the library. or am i? i don't even know. it's hot out and i smell bad. i need to go home and hit the shower.

I guess it's kinda true? Not really, though. Ya know, the biggest difference being that I'm not a boy. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this. There's no point to it. 

School is not so cool, but what can ya do. This week will go fast and then next week is only 4 days. So that's good. 

Guitar is good. 

Today I found a bit of peace of mind. I've also committed myself to becoming more relaxed. I guess I do get stressed over stupid stuff. And I don't ever do anything to change. I'm trying to change that now. Starting with little stuff. I don't know. 

This is how the rest of my day should be commencing. 
1. Right now: Homework
2. 3:00ish: read/knit/quiet time
3. 4-6:00ish: I don't know, whatever happens. Maybe laundry? Who knows?!
4. 6-7:00ish: dinner/family bonding
5. 7-8:00ish: gym
6. and then just chill for the night. I'll probably tidy up my room a bit, read a little more, and maybe even knitting (but that may be getting a little too crazy! I don't know! We'll see!)

It's amazing how meaningless my life is right now. I should probably care a lot more than I do. I'm more concerned over the fact that I'm not concerned of my existance... or lack thereof. 

I need a life. Need, not so much want. 
Uh-oh. Don't get me started on this. I may be late to..... uh..... get back to my......... uh..... busy? ....... no......... uh........... oh, just shut up!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","So, in my afternoon boredum, I found this random kid on MySpace who had this ""stupid"" blog (under the cut below) about how awesome he was. I began reading it thinking it was just some kid trying to convince the world of how awesome he is and to get some ass by copying a blog from some other kid trying to achieve the same. Then I read it and realized.... I have this boy. No, not the one that put this on his myspace, but the idea. Every trait on here is Kevin. It's so true. It makes me feel like a waste of life because he's right here and I don't think I'm appreciating him nearly as much as I should. And when I think this, I immediately get the feeling that I'm going to be sorry if (God forbid!!!) this ever ends. I really need to watch my step and be more there for him. I need to quit being an egotistical snob and start being a good human being.... whatever that is.


<lj-cut text=""Since when did I deserve this?!?!""> 

Taken from myspace kid:
I'm that boy who will:

-Swing with you at the park

-Take you to a special spot that I've never taken another girl to and then cuddle in a blanket and watch the stars.

-Make a special cd of me singing the songs I've written for you

-Kiss you on the forehead

-Cook for you(and do a good job)

-Call you to sing you a song and tell you I miss you

-Tell you my secrets I've never told anyone else

-Never lie to you

-Never talk back to you

-Hold your hand in front of my friends and public

-Tell you I love you and that I mean it.

-Listen and understand you when you are talking

-Go out of my way to buy you the best gifts

-Tell you that you are gorgeous and that I mean it

-Open the doors for you whenever we are together

-Not look at other girls

-Not talk about other girls being pretty

-Treat you like a queen

-Shut up even If I am right

-Play with your hair

-who can wrestle with you and let you win. 

-who can talk to you about anything 

-who laughs at your jokes. 

-who puts your cold hands in my warm hoodie pockets. 

-who lets you use my sweatshirt for a pillow. 

-who will kiss you in the rain, in the sunshine, and in the snow. 

-who calls unexpectedly!!!!!!! 

-who will have many inside jokes with you and remember each one. 

-a boy who notices haircuts. 

-who realizes that you say things but don't always mean them. 

-who can go swimming with you on hot days. 

-who can tell you his problems and let you help. 

-who will let you beat me up when you get angry.

-who writes love letters to you, but doesnt send them. 

-who saves my genuine, big smiles for you. 

-uses my deeps eyes that can see through faces into depths. 

-who gives you my t-shirt to change into and not expect to get it back. 

-who knows your favorite color, song, car, vegetable, perfume and 
movie 

-who will shake your dads hand and look your mom in the eye. 

-who knows your full name-- first, middle and last. 

-who will know when something is wrong when you're trying your best to put on an act  

-who will let you cry to me. 

-who will hold you & kiss your cheek. 

-who will brag about you to all of his friends 

-not afraid to give you a great big hug right in front of my mom  

-who wears cologne that you can subtly smell when you're leaning on my shoulder. 

-who tells you that you have a nice laugh and a smile that lights up the room and simply be yours to hold.

Oh man, life is so good. I know all of my posts lately have been centered around the same general theme, but I can't say it enough. I realize life won't always be this good. I wish it were, but just knowing that these moments exist makes it all worth it. I also realize that I could just be a naive teenager who will have a complete change of heart in a week and have it be totally ""normal."" I don't care. Vulnerability is the only way to happiness. I truly believe that now. Just existing won't change a thing. In fact, it makes it worse because your entire life is routine. That may work for some, and that may be in my near future, but I don't have to have routine now, and I don't want it anymore. For the first time I'm changing without forcing it into my life, and it feels right."

"event","well, here's my stab at the annual back to school livejournal entry. 

school pretty much rocks. i don't know if it's me or what, but it's awesome. zero hour i have guitar. my teacher is mega rad and i know i'll have fun. it's kinda weird because i expected a group of introverted wanna be rock stars with a couple others, but instead i'm the closest thing there is to a wanna be rock star in the class. i just didn't expect a group of purists practicing for next time they play ""jesus loves me"" around the campfire at church camp '06. oh well, at least i have the best guitar in the class. come on, it's freakin' blue! that's kickass! 
1st hour i have free enterprise/manufacturing. basically, it was a way out of economics. the entire semester is just the class forming a company, making a product, dealing with stocks, and selling our product. it'll be interesting and i'll learn a lot more about economics this way then in the typical ""bueller? bueller? bueller...."" setting. 
2nd hour is senior english. my teacher is kinda stern, but apparently she spoke with ms. rad (my favorite teacher from last year), and she already loves me. then she found out that i love to read and write. that helps a lot. i love having teachers that respect you right off the bat. they don't wait to get to know you and wait for you to screw up. instead they depend on you and have high expectations of you. i can meet them... in english, anyways. 
3rd hour is trigonometry. that class is pretty much hell. my teacher is so boring and insists that, not only, is the book always right, but reading about math is the way to learn it. what? come on! it's math! it's hard trig math! just show me some examples and i'll pick it up. so, that one kinda sucks, but i've heard that the other trig teachers are just worse. it's alright, i've had my fair share of boring teachers. here's an equation for mr. osuna... kelly + sitting in the back of the class + sitting next to a friend + a boring teacher = ??? that's right, it equals no good. i tend to be, well, chatty in this type of situation. i hope i don't get in too much trouble. we'll see. 
so, after 3rd hour i go home. pretend like i'm going to do homework after eat lunch, but really just sit around justifying my time wasted until someone else comes home. then i read for a long time. then... i don't know. last couple days i've hung out with kevin at this time. then i go to bed early, but don't fall asleep until, like, 12:30 in the am. then i wake up at 3 to pee. then again at 5. get ready. go to school. until the day i die! no really! i will have a similar schedule to this between the months of august and may until i retire. that is, if all goes as i assume i want them to. i don't know. i've been thinking taking a year off after college would be a really smart idea. just do some stupid job and hang. just live on my own a little before i'm stuck in a career. not that a career is a bad thing. not one bit. i can't wait to be a teacher! i just know that if i don't take off time for me i will always have in the back of my mind ""i never really lived without responsibility."" i guess i just want to live without a place i have to be for the majority of my time. i mean, my entire schedule during school revolves around school. i have 4 classes! this doesn't need to be at all, but i have trouble not concentrating on school, for some reason. it's hard to be such a night person. i can't live with the realization that i HAVE to go to bed or i HAVE to be home by a certain time. it just ruins my thoughts for all the time prior to that. i don't know. i just realized that i was really writing all this stream of conscious crap in a completely public forum. not that anyone reads this dribble. if you did, more power to you. but i suggest you pick up a book because that will be much more entertaining and beneficial to your brain. 

sometimes i think i need help. or at least some sleep.

maybe i just need to go write.  

i love everyone in the universe today. 

ciao. 

toodles. 

hugs and sloppy sloppy tongue kissies to you all. 

how many of these pointless goodbye lines can i write?

let's see. 

......................

stay in school. 

keep off drugs. 

don't do grass, go to mass. 

hugs not drugs. 

quit your urgin' stay a virgin. 


alright... sorry i made you scroll so much. i know the effort that takes. 

and i appreciate your dedication. 

bye. 



ps................ ahh.... nevermind."

So, my day was boring. Woke up and went to Tower to get Foo/Weezer tickets. They ended up being $40!!!!! Since I was buying 3, I was a little floored. But then I thought 'I would probably pay $30 to see Weezer alone and $30 to see Foo Fighters alone.' So, I decided it was well worth it. Plus, I got floor space. General admission, granted, but how amazing will that be!!!!! Ugh, I cannot wait. I also got the new Tristan Prettyman album in Tower. Amazing. Definately the definative genre of music I've been into lately. 

The rest of my day has been me just lounging around. What a fun last Saturday of summer. Then I realized how lazy I was being and picked my behind up and drove it to Barnes and Noble. I got Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs and Basket Case. I'm excited to read both. I definately needed some more books. I just can't get excited about the ones I have. I need to get lost in a story instead of reading nonfiction right now. 

Tomorrow will be semi-hectic. Just because I need to do a bunch of crap before school starts and Kevin is coming back and... yeah. Just stuff. 

I'm anxious for school to start on Monday. I'm super happy because I'm not nervous at all. I've totally got the mood of I'll just be me and talk more and learn a lot and make some friends. First time that's ever happened. I'm usually thinking Oh, God! Why don't these people like me? Oh well, I don't like them. Et cetera... But not this year. This year is gonna be good and fun and short! 4 classes? Come on, that's unheard of. 2 of them are basically throw away classes and the other 2 are subjects that I actually like. 

Well, time for me to quit wasting time here and go waste time somewhere else.

"event","so, life is really good right now. and i mean REALLY good. and by good i mean the best it has been in such a long time... possibly ever. i have a completely new outlook on everything and am just a happy person. school starts soon. i'm excited. kevin comes home sunday. i'm beyond excited. life is so awesome. 

foo fighters/weezer tickets went on presale today, but i was in california and unaware. i've accepted the fact that i'm gonna have crappy seats, but it's okay. a seat is a seat. the best i can do is be online right as tickets go on sale on saturday. i'm gonna see if i can get them at a better location. possibly zia or tower. because, let's face it, ticketmaster blows. the internet blows. 

california was a lot of fun. i spent the whole time with my cousins and baby-sat for my little cousin, trinity. so much fun. of course, how can you not have fun when you are being constantly doted on and being hung on by a 2 year old that thinks you are the best thing to breathe since barney? she must be able to see how amazing i am. haha. 

so, yeah, i should probably have a huge update. but i don't. 

but, i will tell you this that i've learned. everything that is a temporary distraction in my life has lead me down a very bad path. my life will be constructive now. and i plan to begin this asap. my first plan of action... sign off of the computer."

thanks.

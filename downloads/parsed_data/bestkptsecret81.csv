well it all started out bad cuz a certain charlie jury decided to not come to school which ended up ruining the whole rest of the day then our little drug speaker got canceled then found out that two of my friends who have been together for... forever (like 3 years) are ""taking a break"" which really kinda depressed me, because if the two closest people i know cant stay together what is that saying about the rest of us? o well. then i got in trouble in drivers ed but thats nothing new. that guy is such a fucking asshole i hope he dies painfully and burns in hell slowly. god i have never hated anyone this much the only person who comes close is this one girl that goes to shrine (who will not be named) whom i believe should go to hell with the drivers ed dude. wow. anywayyyy on a happier note i got to shopping which was a uh blast ? haha yea right. but i think that this kid ive thought was like the hottest thing ever since like oreintation is finally over thank god hes such an ass haha. but anywayy ive been packing for like the last three hours and its so overwhleming i decided i have wayyyy too much stuff which i never told i d say and im still not done. at the aruba vay-cay is gunna kick some major ass.

"event","whoa i think im liking this whole elle jay thing except no one comments and im too dumb to figure out how to add friends and i ended up adding the wrong ppl and trying to delete them and it got all complicated so i think im gunna give up on that. anyway im in a really good mood. its either ace of base or enya that got me here haha cuz it sure wasnt drivers training. omg i had to drive with the stupid faggot of an instructoer today i hate him more than anyone in  the world. god. he was like arguing with me about whether i pay attension in class or not while i was driving and i was like shut up im trying to concentrate and then everytime i did something wrong hed be all like we went over this in class and i was like god sorry its my first time back off and one time he was like ok think about turning soon so as i was sitting there (thinking about turning) hes like GO GO GO so i was like ok so i go and hes like NOOOOO NOW ITS TOOO LATE and jams on his brake and it was hilarious cuz then we sat there for like five minutes and waited for the car he thought was gunna hit us cuz it was like forever away. haha
drivers instructor... boom dead     as lauren would put it hahaha
i <3 u lauren u crack me up 
anywayy on a happier note my honors composition class was the funniest class i have ever been in. today this kid karl (carl? i dunno) flys into a fit of rage while telling a story about how some girl got 15 extra points bc she had to work with him on a project and to exphasize his last point he throws his pen at the wall and it exploded permanent ink allllll over the entire wall and ceiling and floor and mary and jesus and he was like =:0  and i was like : ) and then we all had to help him clean the room for rest of the class. = hilarious 
ok bed time
      goodnight all,

Tana and I are like ""soulmates"" because we have the same personality basically, we are good girls who just happen to fall into some bad shit sometimes. Jamey is the sweetest, most genuinely kind guy i've ever met. He's the bestest guy friend I've ever had. 

I LOVE the hall I am in, I have the hottest guys, the coolest people to hang out with, we all hang out almost every night, watching a movie or playing Tetris. We're like a big family. 

Nope, I dont have a boyfriend, i was close to having one, but I realized im no where close to being ready to even think about it. I learned that lesson the hard way, but I was honest with myself and the guy so I guess that's the important part.

I got an MIP this last thurs. I was drunk off my ass walking home and having to be held up by Tana and my friend Alex. A biker cop caught us and me and tana both got MIP's. I'm embarassed about how dumb I acted and how drunk i was. I definantly learned my lesson there. 

Midterms are this week and I've been workin my butt off so im ready. Also, my 18th birthday is this week, I'm so thankful for my friends because Im sure without them id be pretty homesick. They are throwing a sick party and we're calling it ""Megtober Fest 2005"". I'm pretty excited about that!"

""Megan,

Sister. Today is  a very special and important day in your life. I am so happy to have been here with you to be a part of it. I hope that you felt the holy ghost on this day and that it carries you through especially with your first year of college ahead of you. I love you very much and I am so proud of how much you have grown and matured this last year.

Love always,

Crystal McDowell
Your inherited sister""

But i know you love me and ian and your family, and I can hear you laughing still. I think about you and the memories we've shared almost every second of the day. I think about the things you taught me and how much you've helped me grow into a woman in one year. Sometimes Im driving or walking and its like I can feel your presence right there with me. 

I think about the things you never got do, like be a mom or an Aunt of my future children, what a good mom and Aunt you would have been. No one could ever replace you sissy... but then again i think about all the things you did do, about all the love you had comin your way. 

I think about all the songs we sang going on trips to rafting,camping,shopping, and everywhere else. I think about how hard you made me laugh. How happy we were when we hung out, how sad we were when you had to fly home or vice versa. Id miss ya as soon as I got onto the plane. 

Now I'm here, and you are up there, but I know we're gonna meet again, I know I will soon hear your laugh and see your smile. I miss you so much, and I always will."

A few days earlier we got to go see her one last time, talk to her, be near her. I told her how much I loved her and how I'll never forget what she taught me and how hard it is to know that I can't talk to her and hear her. I told her that I miss her more than words can know, and how grateful I am of the faith she helped me develop. I asked her how it was up there, if she's happy. 

The funeral was so hard, I've never had such a heavy heart before, I could barely breathe and I couldn't hold back my sobs. To know that she won't be on the other end of the line if I call hurts. 

Crystal meant so much to me, she was such a light in my life and brought so much joy and laughter. We were sisters, but best friends. Every where I turn there is a memory of a her and I think of what we were doing amd saying. Her laughter is still ringing in my ears. I miss her."

I got home and put on PJ's grabbed a blanket, and went and laid ontop of my car, and stared at the stars. I thought, if I see a shooting star, this is what I'm going to wish for (can't tell you or it wont come true!) and right when I thought that, i saw a HUGE one, and made my wish.

So I babysat today, the little girl is really cute but REALLY tiring. She liked to go outside and eat and run around. But i guess i have a job now until I get ready to leave, the lady said that she didn't really trust the other babysitter and was going to put Liliana in daycare, but was nervous because she didn't want her getting sick. So she asked me if I would mind and I told her no, that'd be fine, it's not a lot of money, but it's enough.That was just kind of an answer to my prayers! 

I found out yesterday that the lady who was supposed to do my massage got in a terrible car accident and her friend that was in the car was killed, and she's in critical condition. I feel so bad because I was all mad about it, I feel guilty, man, you never know what can happen. So scary.

UGH my dad was here for like 4 hours today, driving me crazy! He keeps harassing me about packing so finally today I was like ""I'll be out of your hair in 3 weeks can you just let me do it my own way until then?"" 

I talked to Tessa for like 2 hours last night, and I'm spending the night at her house tomorrow and she's going to go to my ward with my on Sunday.

People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self centered;
Forgive them anyway.
If you are kind, People may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;
Be kind anyway.
If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies;
Succeed anyway.
If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;
Be honest and frank anyway.
What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight;
Build anyway.
If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;
Be happy anyway.
The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;
Do good anyway.
Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;
Give the world the best you've got anyway.
You see, in the final analysis it is between you and God;
It was never between you and them anyway.

Today I told my grandparents i was getting baptized into the LDS church, my grandpa said ""I think i just might disown you"" and I got a lecture and earfull from everyone. I sucked it up and didn't cry, even though what he said is something i could never say to anyone, and it hurt really bad, but like Mother Theresa said in that poem, it was never between me and them. I just thought my own family could be supportive."

"event","I went to Detroit lake on friday and spent the night there and spent the day there today and drove back to Sherwood. That place is SO beautiful! The water is perfect, it's turquoise and it's not filled with JUNK. Sis and I slept in her sweet Town and COuntry mini van rental, it was suprisingly comfortable. I slept sooo good,  but i guess i was talking all night in my sleep and said things like ""Lets go to the Grocery Store"" Right.I got super sunburned on my face and shoulders and have this red circle on my  back from my swimsuit! 

I've still been taking discussions from the missionaries and i've been praying like crazy, and I've decided to get baptized and I couldn't be more happy! I've never ever felt this way before, I basically   walk around with this huge smile on my face and I have no desire to do anything bad and I actually feel at peace, and I'm filled with happiness! I sound like a total cornball but it's so true.

"event","So today sis and I worked out, I ran a 6:47 mile! Then i worked on the elyptical maching for about 20 minutes, the stationary bike for 15, and then various weight machines, and then we went and played in the pool. Then we came home, showered and went a got food for our dinner that we prepared for the missionaries tonight. 

Yesterday I went to church with Crystal, and I have been to a few Sundays worth of church at the LDS church, and I always felt really good about it, but i never knew what to think. Tonight elder Larson and elder rupp came over and just talked to me, not really so much about the book of mormon but about the bible itself, and even though I have been going to church for years, I learned alot more about the bible. While I was at church yesterday and had discussions today, a very good peaceful feeling came over me, I had an urge to be a better person and to find right in my life. I felt at peace for once.

I'm really sick of being sad, depressed, angry. I'm sick of trying to be a hard ass all of the time, I'm sick of going for the bad guys and doing bad things. Lately I've felt like ive been spiraling down, if its not one thing, its the other. I just really want to find peace and happiness, and feel complete. 

I dont want to hear anyones complaints about how they dislike the LDS church or how its all lies because I believe its not, I FEEL it, like ive never felt anything else before."

"event","Ugh i feel sick, i think it was this caramel latte i had at the mall. Sis and I went shopping tonight, I got 2 new eyeshadows at MAC, they are really pretty. One is called amber lights and its a pretty gold/bronze color and the other is called Phloof, its a pretty soft shimer pink. Then i went to GAP and got 2 pairs of capris, a new skirt and a plain shirt, all for like $42!! I wish i had a lot of money, i saw so many cute things that i couldnt afford! But when i first got here i got a ton of cute shirts and some pants and shoes, and an OSU sweatshirt. SO i think i've been pretty successful getting things that will be beneficial in college. 

Tomorrow sis and i are going to church and then we will go work out, I'm excited for that I just love working out, really, im serious! I want to lose atleast 10 pounds but make sure I tone my legs, i think when i get to OSU that'll happen because I'll be in ballet and I will have free access to that amazing gym of theirs, plus i can go rock climbing all i want! I will LOSE 15 if anything!  

Im just in a really weird mood right now, i dont know what it is, maybe its that i dont feel well. I'm going to bed!"

Coming home today we were in the slow lane behind 2 semis and then we went into the fast lane to get around them, well we were right along side the front semi when it started to pull into our lane because he didnt see us or wasnt paying attention or something, and almost pushed us off the road into the median, so crystal slammed on her brakes and right when we thought that everything was ok another semi rear ended us. It was really scary but we are ok so thats a good thing, things could have been ALOT worse.

I met with the debate/speech co-capt, she says she definantly wants me on the team and that they go to really big competitions in like florida and stuff, and that coming with 4 years experience, already in parli means that I will already have almost more experience than a lot of the people on the team. I saw our dorm room, it's pretty sweet. I feel like I know where everything (almost) is, and have an understanding for whats really going on, I am soooo excited! The gym is AMAZING, 3 stories, 2 pools rooms and rooms of excercise equipment and i will pretty much live there in my free time. they have the best rock climbing wall in the Pac 10 and i even tried it, its hard! Another place i will live in is the library, 6 stories of glory. I was in awe...

 I am majoring in human services. I got some sweet classes too...HUMAN SEXUALITY! OH YEa, um lets see intro to statistics for my math class, intro to sociology, and ALS class which is just basically for froshes to get aquainted with the available help, and the best, oh yes, my dream come true, Ballet 1!

"event","So today was kinda crappy. I went to church reluctantly because my mom wanted to go. I really don't mind the people there, I've grown up with those people since 3rd grade, so it's hard not to like them. We got this new preacher like a couple months ago, and every time i listen to him i get upset. Today was the last straw though, the last push i needed to realize I never want to go to that church again. He basically preached that everything I believe in is wrong. First of all, he said that we should have no emotion involved in religion, that it should be solely about the bible. WTF?! Shouldn't religion or spirituality belong to some of the deepest emotions you have? Then he basically said any religion besides ""christianity"" or pretty much any church besides that one is wrong. He called mormons the devil, he said God has turned his back on homosexuality, he said women have no place to preach or speak up in the church, and he said ""we will not allow left winged liberal politicians knock our church over"" another WTF?! So now I cant be democratic, wow I guess this church really isnt meant for me when all of the sudden its telling me which political party i should belong to. I just started crying because I was so offended and frustrated with what he said. I got up, went and washed my face, and walked out. 

Then my mom had a panic attack or something and started crying out of no where. Freakin insane.

Well I'm leaving for Portland tomorrow, i will be gone for 2 or 3 weeks, I think I might stay longer and go camping with Crystals family."

It's gonna be a ton of fun and I'm soooo excited to see her and have fun and do our normal honking at strangers and laughing for like 5 minutes about it everytime. HEHE, I luv you sis! Also, I will get to meet my roomy, we're going to START together and then maybe sometime we might go club it up (oh btw sis its called The Zone, I THINK thats what she said.) 

I finally got an email from Ian and I was really happy to hear from him! He seems to have been in a really good mood, he told me i better be careful around frat boys, and it would break his heart if he had to sniper one! LOL!

I finally went running tonight, to see how my hips are doing and how much i need to work to get in shape since i still have this cough. I have alot to work on, but i would like to get in good shape before college so i can use that awesome gym to its full potential!  

I realized how far I've come in therapy. I used to hate myself and I could ever see any good in myself when i looked in the mirror. Now when i do, I am happy and satisfied, and I feel good about myself and the woman I've become. My self esteem is SO much better, and that's really important. Especially when im going to college and will hopefully meet an amazing guy, i have to be confident in myself and have self worth before i can truly care about anyone else! OK enough of the cheesiness!"

THen we went to Walmart because thats what bored people do around here, and i was being retarded like normal and i put on this enormous fanny pack. Well i was like walking around with it and stuff, and this old disgruntled man was like ""Ma'am, can i help you with that?"" I was like ""oh im just trying it on"" and hes like ""well i can ring it up for you here or you can put it back"" I should of been like ""I'm doing research on AARP can you help me out?"" ASS. Well then we left a little later and Cinda and i were waiting at a stop light when this hottie pulled up beside us and I was like ""hey gorgeous"" and then i looked a little further in the car and his mother was in there! So that made it even funnier. So he kept looking over at us (long stoplight) and i was like ""OMG cinda he wont stop looking over here"" so she looks at him and shes like ""What?! I cant help it you're hot!"" and then the light turned green. Good Times.

Like i cant even sit for very long, because they cramp up and get really painful. It turns out i have Patellar-femoral syndrome, a common syndrome in runners. Its cuz my hamstrings are stronger than my quads and my knees arent properly alligned. She said all i can do is lift weights to make my quads stronger and take IB profen. It really sucks.

"event","I LOVE this song. I just watched the music video and remembered how amazing it is.

'Hands Down'-Dashboard Confessional

Breathe in for luck,
breathe in so deep,
this air is blessed,
you share with me.
This night is wild,
so calm and dull,
these hearts they race,
from self control.
Your legs are smooth,
as they graze mine,
we're doing fine,
we're doing nothing at all.

My hopes are so high,
that your kiss might kill me.
So won't you kill me,
so I die happy.
My heart is yours to fill or burst,
to break or bury,
or wear as jewelery,
which ever you prefer.

The words are hushed lets not get busted;
just lay entwined here, undiscovered.
Safe in here from all the stupid questions.
""hey did you get some?""
Man, that is so dumb.
Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear...
so we can get some.

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me.
So won't you kill me, so I die happy.
My heart is yours to fill or burst,
to break or bury, or wear as jewelery,
which ever you prefer.

Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember,
I'll always remember the sound of the stereo,
the dim of the soft lights,
the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers
and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late
and this walk that we shared together.
The streets were wet
and the gate was locked so I jumped it,
and I let you in.
And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist
and you kissed me like you meant it.
And I knew that you meant it,
that you meant it,
that you meant it,
and I knew,
that you meant it,
that you meant it."

"event","So I decided to make a list of good old high school memories, I'm feeling quite nostalgic!

*The time that David W took my beautiful banana paper notebook, and wrote on every freakin page ""Dave was here"" in ink!*

*The time i was teaching Cinda how to roll like a ninja in her yard,and I got frisbees and then would roll like a ninja*

*Then I accidentally rolled like a ninja in her bed room, i did like a backflip off of her bed and then like rolled 2 times on the ground backwards. It was amazing*

*When we got in a licorice whipping fight at debate camp my first year*

*The next year we played sardines and i was sardined with a really hot guy in a shower and we turned it on so someone would think we were taking a shower, so they wouldn't look in there and find us. Don't worry i was good!*

*Sticking pencils in Mrs. Good's ceiling, OMG she freakin FLIPPED!* 

*Golly we did alot to Mrs. Good :( Like the time the class before us hid a bunch of condoms in her room and then we went on a condom hunt, and then someone put one on her door! AHA or the time that we were watching Hamlet and there was a little naked kid in the movie and she covered him up and said she ""wouldnt have any budding perverts come out of her class""*

*Singing the ""father of mine, where have you been"" with Vanilla Rob, I LOVE that kid! Oh yeah and playing UNO and he calls me Megalo Mart, and drew me a snailmel (its a cross between a snail and a camel).*

*Liberating gnomes. Enough said*

*HAHAHAHAHA district debate, my round with Brennan. Totally rapped to big pimpin*

*Freakin winning first place in D-3 this year. Go CG!*

*Stabbing*

*A$'s ""You don't even know who I am inside"" and his hissing and hairslap.""

*punching it like a mother in track, PRing, smoking cigarettes, humper seat, and the baby birthing. Just dont ask!*

GOOD TIMES GOOD TIMES!"

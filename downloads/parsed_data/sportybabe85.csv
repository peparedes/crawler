"event","sorry i haven't written in a while- i just forgot. well today it was soooooo HOT!!! of course yesterday i wore my shorts and it was kinda cold, and then today i wore my pant overalls. i was dying. then during 6th we had to take down the black tarp so i was all nasty and stuff. but katherine bought me yogurt when we went to yogurt express so i cooled down (thanx kat- ur the greatest) i also don't know what i am gonna do next year for my classes. i was origionally in Adv. Humanitites. but it told my mom i wanted to switch to AP (b/c the teachers were switching and i would have hard teachers in Adv.) but the new AP teacher came and talked to us about what we would be doing and stuff. it is like all reading and tests. no projects. during the summer i would have to read a book and write a book report, read the first 2 chapters of the AP history book and write 3 essays on them. then the 2nd day of school i would have a test. i don't want to go through all that crap. besides, almost all of my friends are gonna be in Adv. so i think i will stay. of course now my mom is saying that i can't switch back and that colleges are picking people that took and AP class as a junior. i won't have any but who cares. i have good grades and that is good enough for me. besides, i have to take chem next year and with that (i will suck at that class) and sports i am gonna be tired so this will work out. oh and today the varsity softball coach said that he may make a PE class for us where we will run and then like once a week we can play a PE game. ummmmmmmmm....NO!!!!! hell no. i do not want to do that stuff. it is gonna suck if he is an ass and does that. well gotta go. i will write in you later. bye bye"

"event","yeah so today i had to practice with varsity again. my last JV game was on tuesday and i was soooooo relieved b/c i wanted to relax and leave school when in got out (instead of practicing) but the varsity coach brought me and 2 other JV players up for CIFs. i was brought up last year but i didn't have to play. now i am most likely gonna start or at least play. but i am soooooo sick of softball. i want to say that i don't want to play with them but my dad doesn't want me to and i know the coach won't like it (even if he says it is ok) the good thing is that the coach fidns out if we get to go or not- they are pick 2 out of 3 teams to go fill the 2 other spots. all i want is for them to not make it ( no one on varsity wants to go anyway but they don't want to tell the coach) who knows what will happen, just wish me luck either way. bye bye

PS: nothing happened at school. i had a physics test that i had to do good on or else my parents would be pissed, i think i did ok. I am getting the Tripple E award tomorrow - for like community service and stuff so that is kinda fun- i got it last year too. ok bye bye"

"event","hey!!! today i had so much fun. i went with my sis, mom and 4 other moms to a spa in Glenn Ivy for an eraly mothers day get away. it was so kewl. i went in a sulfer mineral bath (even though it smelled like a stink bomb it was nice), floated in a pool, went swimming, hung out in the steam room and best of all- i layed out and took a mud bake. you cover yourself in a reddish clay mud and then lie out. then when it dries, you dust it off and then scrub it off in the shower. it was really fun. overall today was just a fun and relaxing day. i cant wait to do it again! HAPPY (early) MOTHERS DAY!!!!"

"event","hey- i haven't written in a logn time- so sorry bout that. anyway- today was pretty normal. i got up early and went to school. nothing big happened there- got our progress reports and i did well. i am so glad that i am not in AP this year. i would have to take that AP test and would be so stressed out right now. most of my friends are like that right now and i feel bad for them. i went to softball but all we did was hit in the cage- but we have to run a pratriot lap b/c half the people wore school clothes (including me) but we knew we were doing nothing. but i got ice cream afterwards so i am happy! well that is about it- i might go over to kat and liz's but i don't know if my mom will want me to ( kc is gone and she may want someone to stay home with her) i hope not b/c i never go anywhere over the weekends any more- kc always leaves and i stay home. oh well. bye bye"

"event","well today was so slow and boring. i had to do that stupid SAT9 testing which was sooooo not fun. at softball today i played like crap too. i did great until we had to field and the varsity coach was there. he hit the ball so hard and put a weird spin on it- so i took a direct hit in the shin and just looked bad. and in front of the VARSITY COACH!!!! and not to mention but the weather was cold and i was in shorts and a tank top. it just wasn't my day. BUT OHHHH- my boy JL ate my sandwitch (remember Irish?) and kyle said i was the greatest- he just wants my homework- oh well still something. well now i have to go make dinner. bye bye"

"event","ok- once again- i don't understand boys. they flirt and flirt and half of the time they don't even like you. then if they do like you- you don't even find out until it is too late (or never for some cases) wel am i the only one that feels like this. i am sooooo sick of going through all of this crap every day. i am to the point of desperation ( is that a word?) well that is the guy problem for the day- there will be more- don't worry!"

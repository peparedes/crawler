"event","Yay! It's finally 2005! I have been really busy doing more promos for that TV show movie I was talking about earlier, but I will try and get on here more, I promise.  That is one of my New Year Resolutions - to get on here more! Seriously! 

Well, I guess it's back to working for me! Ugh.  Talk to you later.

"event","Hey!  Christmas was really fun and I got a lot of presents which was real cool.  But the best part for me was getting to see my family since I don't get to see all of them a lot.  

I'm now also working on a TV movie that will air in 2005.  Shhhh...not many people know about this movie yet, so it'll be our little secret!  The movie is called ""Lies My Mother Told Me"" and I play a girl named Haylei.  Other people in the movie are Colm Feore and Joely Richardson.  I can't give away any more info about it, so you'll just have to watch it yourself.

Since I might not be on again before January 1st, I hope you all have a very Happy New Years!

xoxo Hayden"

"event","Hey, what's up, people? This is me Hayden again!  I am so excited today because tonight is Christmas Eve!  I am going to this huge party with one of my good friends, Paris.  You know her, Paris Hilton? Yeah, so, anyways, it is going to be a blast!  And I don't have to do any training for Ice Princess today!!  *does a little dance* And tomorrow is officialy Christmas! My whole family will be coming over to my house for dinner....and then I'm going to another party afterwards.

Right now, I am watching Mean Girls. My favorite character is Gretchen, because I think Lacey C does a great job playing her.  One day, I hope to meet Lacey.  She seems like she'd be really nice!

I am about to go to the mall for some last-minute Christmas shopping with some of my friends, Tori, Lexi, and Nikki.

Talk to ya later!

xoxo Hayden"

"event","Hey people! It's me again.  What's up?  I'm bored out of my mind right now!  My little brother is annoying the heck out of me.  He's in my trailer begging me to let him go online.  Yeah right! Anyway, I'm pretty bummed today.  I have to go in for a stupid eye appointment.  There is nothing wrong with my eyes...so i don't know why I have to go.  It seems so stupid!  But I guess better safe than sorry.  But don't worry...I won't be getting glasses anytime soon! LOL

Yay! I got more friends on LiveJournal.  If you're adding me, post a comment so I can add you back!

Thankies and I love you all,
Hayden xoxo"

"event","Hey welcome to my Live Journal.  This is Hayden Panettiere.  So far, today has been a really busy day for me.  It's surprising I was able to write.  I have been practicing really hard for my new movie, Ice Princess.  I have to train up to five hours a day.  I'm actually getting pretty comfortable on the ice.

I wish my friends were here skating with me.  And I wish I had some more friends on Live Journal.  *tear, tear* LOL.  

Hey, Tim is calling me.  I gotta get back to work on the movie.  See ya!

xoxo,
Hayden"

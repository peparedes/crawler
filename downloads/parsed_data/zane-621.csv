.....end all of these fucking mistakes with one big mistake.


""Just one more night
One more score
Another question in my mind,
can't take no more

Kissing the tears form my face as
they fall
To the ground in silence
in twilight and faded time
Spirits cold, with no love
Bells ring a lonely chime
Candle fires
These lit dreams can't burn alone

Winds of change bring songs
upon my memory
An empty heart and soul
intoxicates me
This darkened page orchestrates
my final destiny
Not knowing what,
what tomorrow will bring

I can't escape this captive misery
Heart stone cold, under supremacy
Thrown into a raging sea of tyranny

Lifes vile walls have tangled me in threads
Eternally caught in my futures threads
Play the violent strings of my symphony

Transcend the absence of this fantasy
Just another vision
Washed away with the tide
No place for forgotten ones
I cannot deny
What lies beyond, beyond this fantasy

From within the mirrors eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
And leave my blind
Through passages in time
A prisoner locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die"""

Got paid on the 31st...and cashed the check yesterday.....bought a new router, and it works great, plays both X-boxes without lagging the other one out....but there is one small problem with it....
It conflicts with my computer's IP address, so I'm guessing that one of the X-boxes is trying to use the same IP...I'll find some way around it, like I always seem to do, in some ""stroke of luck""...

"event","A couple in Scotland who claimed to be addicted to computer gaming have been jailed for three months after admitting that they neglected their four children.
The father, 28, claimed to have become addicted to online gaming, and that his wife had also been affected. Arbroath Sheriff Court was told that the case was one of the worst ever seen by police and social workers.
Social workers were called after neighbours spotted two of the children naked on a window ledge. The workers found a baby in a heavily soiled nappy, and two of the children required emergency dental work. One had to have all her teeth removed.
Sheriff Norrie Stein said: ""The reports say there is difficulty in identifying a community-based [sentence], and I'm afraid to say, for you two, there is no alternative to a prison sentence.
""This neglect appears to have occurred over a significant period and, despite extensive home support, clothing and laundry services, and parenting classes, you have clearly chosen to disregard your children.""

This is pathitic....
When you would rather play video games than tend to your childrens needs...thats horrible
...I mean, I know I am addicted to games and all....but even if my friend or even pet has something wrong, I would rather care for them.

...but of course it seems I can't have one good thing without a few bad things (hint the subject of this entry)...

Derick (brothers friend) was an hour and a half late picking me up...and that pissed me off...but at least i had all the food that i stole to eat...cause we don't have any here...and i was laying in my brothers bedroom waiting to hear the mailman, cause I'm on 2 things...a box from Susan, and the adapter for our house-phone....well, I'm playing with my kittens, and DeAnn kept telling me not to be nice to them in their room, so they wouldn't wanna go in there....i found out my brother almost killed one by punching it in the head, just because it was in their room...

Well, I was petting the one kitten I was gonna keep, I didn't care what DeAnn was saying... Derick walked up, and was petting it while it was laying on me...and then was like ""Let me see her."" so I let him take her...he was petting her, and then...out of fucking nowhere...THROWS HER!....from one side of my brothers room, into the bathroom, and the kitten hits her head on the fucking toilet....

I wanna fucking cry right now(I think I wanna cry to much...I may be a little emo boy) cause one good thing i have HERE...is my cats...i love them all....and I'm actually hoping we get the phone adapter today...so i can call my old friend, Beth, and her mom...cause they take care of cats...i can maybe get them gone by 8pm...before my brother gets home from work....so i don't have to worry about it... :(

I would so much rather have no animals then having animals that are abused....

And all of this has greatly affected the idea of me getting a ferret, cause my brother isn't scared to do anything to anything...

All I know...is what comes around will fucking go around....if it has to be by me, so fucking be it...he will fucking pay for everything he has done...from being the favorite child, and getting my parents to hate me for not being as great as he is(which isn't so much his fault, but he encouraged them to not like me) ...to all the animals i've had to get rid of because of him...he makes my life a living hell, and so does his fucking girlfriend...and i want them gone...if i could...i would get rid of them, cause they deserve everything thing i would do to them.......My parents shouldn't be spared in this venting either, they have been such assholes to me my entire life...always favoring Cody, and just fucking me over...always telling me I was a fucking ""accident""...and a worthless,useless piece of shit..to my dad actually beating me cause I was wearing black fingernail polish and eyeliner and also having long hair (which he thought all of this made me a faggot..and i found out he had long hair when he was in high school)....FUCK THEM!...im tired of all this.

I just wanna get away...and go somewhere were people will love me...or maybe they already do love me....at least I know one person there does...

Well, things got odd, but I still thought about those things, and they were on my mind the entire night....even through some weird shit

I left my house sometime around 8-8:30pm and just started walking and listening to my mp3 player.....and it was around 9 when Hailey saw me, and asked if I needed a ride somewhere.  I took that chance to ask her to drop me off at my Mom's diner, cause I still had her cell phone, and I didn't know how long I would be...she wasn't there, so I had to come home and drop it off here...

So, I still got Hailey to dropped me off at the diner (gave her some bullshit reason why I needed to be there) and from the diner (which is like 15 miles away from my house, already) started walking in the opposite direction, towards this ""good neighborhood""....

Well, walking around this neighborhood(I was doing that for quite some time)...i got robbed...at gunpoint....the great/awesome thing about it....they were able to take only $18 and my mp3 player....cause that is all I had....then they drove off, shooting their guns in the air....scared me, and made me start thinking about those things even more....

Well, I walked around that neighborhood for a little while longer...until I decided to head home...so, then, of course, made the long walk home....thoughts still racing through my head....and when I made it to my house, it was the break of dawn...

When I got inside and sat down, I was so sore (and still am) that i just laid down and went to sleep....and the was around 6am...so it turned out to be a rather long walk...and enough thoughts to last for awhile...

Well, thats it...my night, not so many things going on, but i walked for a long time...

"event","A South Korean man who played computer games for 50 hours almost non-stop died of heart failure minutes after finishing his mammoth session in an Internet cafe, authorities said Tuesday.

The 28-year-old man, identified only by his family name Lee, had been playing on-line battle simulation games at the cybercafe in the southeastern city of Taegu, police said.

Lee had planted himself in front of a computer monitor to play on-line games on Aug. 3. He only left the spot over the next three days to go to the toilet and take brief naps on a makeshift bed, they said.

""We presume the cause of death was heart failure stemming from exhaustion,"" a Taegu provincial police official said by telephone.

Lee had recently quit his job to spend more time playing games, the daily JoongAng Ilbo reported after interviewing former work colleagues and staff at the Internet cafe.

After he failed to return home, Lee's mother asked his former colleagues to find him. When they reached the cafe, Lee said he would finish the game and then go home, the paper reported.

He died a few minutes later, it said.



This story is rather sad in ways....but ""Lee"" is to be idolize by gamers everywhere...so I say so...

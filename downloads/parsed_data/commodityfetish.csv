"event","Last night I went to Lee's to see the Scandelles valentines burlesque show. After going to last years, and seeing what an awesome show they put on, I couldn't miss this one.  Special thanks go out to Jeanine for joining me because even though i said i would go alone, I think i'd feel too awkward to actually do it.  I psyched myself up to go up onstage if they called audience members up to try dancing and tassle twirling, but then i chickend out because they expect you to get on the stage from the floor, which would have been an embarassing task for me (i'm so not a climber of anything). plus i was in a skirt and boots. so i made excuses instead of actually doing it. HOWEVER, they ended up not even doing the bareoke competition, so i didn't feel bad anymore for letting myself down. 

The show started off with a modern dance performance to some weird song, leaving me all, ""i don't get it"" but the rest of the show was a feast of sinuous flesh, fun, and allusions to fornication.  I was enamored with the positivity of it all, how everyone's body, sexuality, and identity was welcomed and celebrated. It was just such an uplifting experience. I can't really explain why. But i felt at home.  Anyway, I get to enjoy it all again tonight at the Harlettes show at the Revival.  Here's hoping its equally as tittilating!"

"event","Teddy and I...some of it is so true..ALREADY (its only been a week)
There are times when Scorpio strides fearlessly into a challenging situation, and Virgo feels much more cautious and careful. Scorpio may consider Virgo to be too timid, and Virgo may feel that Scorpio lacks prudence. There are also many situations where Scorpio is more stubborn and persevering that Virgo. Scorpio may view Virgo's lack of commitment and dedication to a single purpose to be a sign of weakness. There is also the possibility that Virgo will view Scorpio as being a bit crude, too passionate or emotionally attached to certain situations or ideas. Virgo has refined sensitivities and sometimes literally doesn't like to get ""dirty hands"", while Scorpio is more primitive, raw, and un-squeamish. You both need to strive to harmonise your different natures and not antagonise each other.

Scorpio is quiet, deep, and complex emotionally, and often hides feelings or jealousy, guilt, and other powerful emotions out of fear of being misunderstood. Scorpio needs passion, drama, and intensity in order to feel completely alive, and may intentionally or unintentionally stir up personal crises or emotional storms in order to have those feelings. There is an underlying attraction to anything secret, dark, and mysterious, including the hidden or dark side of people. Negatively, Scorpio can be subtly manipulative and controlling, positively, Scorpio can be immensely loyal, and deep and faithful friend or lover.

Virgo is quite different from Scorpio in that Virgo responds logically and rationally to situations, rather than irrationally and instinctively as Scorpio does. There may be something in Virgo's background or in the way Virgo was raised that makes Virgo careful, shy, or restrained about being too emotional or sexual, and Scorpio's very intense feelings may be difficult for Virgo to understand or enter into.

Also, Virgo is quite self-critical and is therefore very sensitive to criticism from others, so Scorpio should be careful of lashing out or being sarcastic when in a stormy mood, as this hurts Virgo very much.

The two of you do share a tendency to probe and analyse yourselves and others, and a desire to change and improve yourselves as well.

Virgo's emotional responses to Scorpio are very intense. If Scorpio is physically attractive to Virgo, then the attractive power of Scorpio over Virgo is extremely powerful. However, the attraction tends to have a love/hate quality to it, and you feel drawn to each other, but also wary and distrustful of each other. It is likely that you feel both drawn to each other and repulsed by each other at the same time! The emotional response to each other is intense and complex, and the ultimate outcome of this deep, complex emotional tie is difficult to predict, but one thing is certain: this is not a lukewarm relationship and you ""get under each other's skin"", evoking intense feelings from each other. Virgo can easily become obsessed with Scorpio.

Romantic feelings are strong and you are very compatible sexually. It is unlikely that the feeling of being ""in love"" will ever fade completely, and it is likely that you will both see each other as someone very special and dear to you throughout your lives. Your relationship is definitely warm and romantic and very fulfilling for both of you.

The sexual attraction goes off with a ""bang"". You both arouse one another deeply. You are able to express your love with great conviction. You may enjoy many erotic devices and love toys that add extra spice to the relationship. Love talk and verbal affection may be particularly important to you.

The tendency to argumentativeness, verbal abuse, and mutual misunderstanding is very strong. Try to avoid abusive language towards each other, and do not try to coerce the other person to accept your views. You enjoy challenging each other's ideas, showing the weaknesses, inconsistencies, or superficialities in each other's reasoning. While the intention is good, the net result can be hurt feelings and anger. Typically there is some truth to each other's point of view, but a lack of real appreciation and respect for each other's ideas triggers argumentativeness.

Longevity, stability, mutual conscientiousness and dedication are essential aspects of your relationship. The two of you can build something very solid together. A focus on the practical, on financial security, and on taking care of duties, obligations, and responsibilities permeates your bond with one another. You foster the conservative in one another, and develop a togetherness that is peaceful, steady, more inclined to contentment than to flamboyance or fireworks. The only pitfall in all of this is a tendency to fall into established patterns of being with one another which eventually become too predictable and too easy to take for granted. Nevertheless you are destined to have a long-lasting relationship.

The two of you spark each other's sense of humour and good will. You usually put each other into a good mood, and you can count on lots of laughter, fun, and socialising to develop from this relationship. You feel open and uninhibited with each other, and a great appreciation for each other grows out of your happy times together."

"event","tonight i'm at jeanine's apartment watching tejha so that jeanine and colin could go to a masquerade ball at york.  after work i came over, helped her pick out her outfit, ironed her pants, did her hair and makeup, while colin asked if his shirt needed to be ironed and if his vest looked okay with a missing button.  i even gave them the keys to my car so they wouldn't freeze their asses off walking to york.  i was purely a proud parent on prom night, without all the picture taking and crying.  i even did her dishes and swept the floor. can you tell i'm bored? haha. but i'm glad i'm staying in tonight.  <p>i don't know if the fact that yesterday was friday the 13th had anything to do with it, but i had an amazing time downtown last night.  it was the 20th birthday of a girl in my dance class and she invited me to come out with her and her friends (along with two other girls from our class).  i got all dolled up, went over around 9.30 and her mom and sister and like 14 other girls were all talking and making daquiri's and there was a huge spread of appetizers.  way better than i'd treat anyone who came to my house. haha. we took a limo down and our driver tried to con us out of an extra hundred bucks than we'd been quoted. he also braked and accelerated way too quickly causing everyone to feel nauseaus and one of the girls to puke in the ice bucket. luckily it had a lid. we went to inside and because we showed up in a limo we had a bouncer open the car door, hand us all tickets to get in free, and we bypassed both of the lines. now, the last time i went to inside i was the one standing in line bitching cuz they kept letting limo fulls of people inside while they made us wait. it was nice but awkward to be on the other side of the fence. we get in the club, and sure enough theres no one there. eventually they started letting people in and it got real busy real fast. drinks were only 3.50 at one bar and 4 at another. after reading a slew of terrible reviews of the club on clubcrawlers.com i thought i was in for a horrible time. but it was supah. the girls that i know from class are dancing fiends and that made me even more excited to shake my ass. eventually we were sweating buckets and being pushed in every direction so consuelo and i went to the patio to cool off and so i could have a butt. unfortunately, the patio was not outside like i imagined, but had a roof and heatings blasting. i think it was hotter up there. needless to say we stood around and then two guys tried to pick up consuelo (both friends, and both at the same time) but one of the guys was respectable because instead of only talking to her he pretended he wanted to know me too and we had a conversation. he also got both our numbers but i'm sure he'll only be calling consuelo.  another bonus of that club, the ratio of guys to girls is like 3 to 1! haha heaven.  when we were on the dance floor this guy came into our circle and started showing off some sweet moves in the centre.  and he'd stop and his friend would do some shit, but eventually his friend left and we kept dancing. so he was kinda dancing with me, trying to get me into a kind of dance off. he would do some cool moves, i'd copy them half assed or do something else. it was fun. haha i pictured it being something you saw in a movie. but my skills weren't even close to his. i enjoyed it nonetheless. they started playing shitty music so i went to the lounge area to rest and who do i see but our limo driver. he's standing in the corner smiling and watching us dance.  and he's not young either. definitely over 40, very out of place. he told us before we went into the club that we had to be outside and ready at 2am on the dot or he would charge us 100 bucks more. so we're all outside and waiting at 1.50 and the fucker doesn't come out of the club until after 2. plus we thought he may have been drinking cuz of how happy he seemed in the club so while we were waiting for him one of the girls asked a police officer to come over and speak to him and suss out whether he was intoxicated or not. good ol police. after he came out and we all got in the limo they came over to speak to him. obviously they didn't think he was drunk cuz we went on our merry way. its sad that we had to leave so early though. just as soon as we were getting ready to go they started playing really really good reggae/soca. oh well. all in all i had an awesome night. i always say that friday the 13ths can be crazy good or crazy bad. for me they usually turn out to be crazy good. lets keep it that way!!"

"event","i feel low when i search for men online.  its not just about getting dates.  ultimately, i seek justification, acceptance, approval, validation.  i want to feel wanted, even if by strangers.  when i don't meet anyone, or have meaningful conversations, i feel stupid, sad and as though i'm wasting my time.  i message guys that i think are interesting and they rarely respond which leaves me waiting and feeling as if i'm not good enough for anybody I want.  feel that i have to sit and wait for someone else to want me and then sift through the bullshit to see if they are worthwhile. (96% of the time...they are not).  deserately seeking that connection.  this was supposed to be fun. now it feels desperate and hopeless and yet without it i feel as if i have no options. a crutch. where else can i go? what else can i do? how else will i pass the time? how unattractive is desparation? VERY! the more i look, and the harder i try, the less i find.  from now on, if browsing profiles and chatting to peeps makes me feel anything less than entertained or excited, then its time to get off the fucking internet! <p>also. i hung out with john last night. went for tea, talked at his place, fooled around, slept beside each other. this morning, when i woke up i cried. it was weird...maybe i was dreaming but don't remember. listening to sigur ros first thing in the am didn't help. but anyway..i skipped a part. in two weeks he's going back home to newfoundland, and from there who knows where he's going. i doubt i'll ever see him again. and i honestly never thought it would affect me this much.  i guess i've always left a place for him in my heart (even while my head knew nothing was ever going to happen) and its sad to know that whatever we had will be no more.  its like the end of an unrelationship. if that makes sense. no more bootycalls, no more warm body to lay beside and listen to fall asleep. sigh. <p>.<p>..<p>...<p>..<p>.<P>i said SIGH! haha."

"event","must update for own sake..ahhh. so much to say. what a good weekend! it was my mom's 50th birthday on saturday so my dad planned a surprise weekend of fun. saturday night we went to see the just for laughs comedy tour at massey hall. i was pumped. my mom's depression has been getting steadily worse as it gets darker and colder, and i know the value of a good laugh so i was excited to see her laugh and enjoy. one guy was a bit boring, but the other five comics were amazing! i especially loved ryan belleville (the youngest, and by far cutest, but also the most fun). the host, shaun majumder (of this hour has 22 minutes) picked out this kid near the front of the audience to pick on. because he was only fifteen, he called him pubes, and for the rest of the show he made references to pubes and even the other comics would address him as pubes. and at the end of the night after thanking all the comics and sponsors they thanked pubes too. i can't describe how funny it was. i was crying from laughing and my cheeks literally hurt after. and, in traditional $teph style, i snorted! i never do that! you just have to see it for yourself. it was pretty expensive at 65 bucks a ticket, but i think it was worth it. which reminds me i have tickets to yuk yuks guys SO LETS GO SOON!!!!!!<br>uhm, what else. oh ya, during my last dance studio class we had a guest teach us contact improv (which, in the barest definition is two people doing free flowing, improvised movements involving touch in some way). one of the activities we had to do was hold the wrists of our partner and both lean back, so that we were holding each other up and balancing our weight. it was a really cool experience, especially when we had to do it with our eyes closed, because the balance would change and you'd have to read your body to get it back. anyway, getting to the point, at one point we were told to get down on all fours, and ground ourselves so that our partner could sit on our backs and move around on us (my partner did a kind of laying down backflip off my back). when it came time to switch, i was like theres no way i'm sitting on you. she's like don't worry, i'm strong. and i said i really don't feel comfortable, i'll crush you. stuff like that. now i don't know if you've noticed, but i'm not a small girl. (i'm kidding...about the not noticing part). haha. i'm definitely the biggest in the class. but my partner just kept telling me to just do it. so i did. at first i just straddled her, keeping my feet on the ground. and she told me to take them off, so i did. i was pretty much sitting on her back with my legs straight over her shoulders. it felt so cool! i asked if she was okay a couple times as i moved into different positions and she said she was fine. this probably doesn't seem like anything big to anyone else, and i'm mostly inscribing it just so i won't forget, but it was another step forward in my journy of body acceptance and confidence. i told the teacher this afterward, and thanked her for the experience and she seemed really happy about that. all of the activities combined, being that physically close to near strangers was a lesson in trust and human behaviour as well.  its unfortunate that i only seem to get to experience these eye-opening things in a classroom setting (i mean how often do you get to slide around on the floor, or concentrate on belly breathing as a group, or sit on someones back?!), and that they don't happen more frequently but i'm glad i get to do it nonetheless!"

"event","today was my day off so i made an appointment with danny at reactive ink to get touched up. i headed downtown with jeanine and when i got there he looked at my back, said it looks really good and didn't see anything that needed touching up. haha. i was like crap! because i can't really see my back i couldn't tell beforehand if anything needed touching up. jeanine, tejha and i went on to have lunch at new sky for only FIVE BUCKS each...i got hot and sour soup, an egg roll and singapore style vermicelli. it was delicious. dwayne (tejha's dad) met up with us and from there we went to queen east in search of this place called studio one. i was told that i could find cheap body piercing jewelry there and i wanted to try a barbell to see if that would make my  nipple piercing heal. i went in with jeanine and knew i had no clue what size i wanted so i asked the guy if he wanted to just look at it for me. then i found out that i would either be exposing my boob to a surveillance cam or, if i turned away from its sight i'd be facing the window. the guy gave me the gauge measurer and instructed me on how to do it myself. did it in a flash and seven dollars later i got my barbell. as we were leaving jeanine noticed a price list for piercings outside the shop that was right beside studio one. she was tempted to get her nipple pierced cuz it was only 50 bucks. we spoke to a guy that worked there who was having a butt and she was excited but unsure. we walked around some more looking for food for dwayne and she actually decided to do it! we went back and i got to see her get it done (thanks for letting me g!). the piercers hands were shaking cuz he was having trouble pushing it through smoothly. i was just like OWWW watching. haha. anyway, after sweating out 40 gallons of water we decided it was high time to go home. got stuck in crazy traffic *barfs* on the way back. i got caught in the storm and my windows completely fogged up so i couldn't see a thing. i had to pull into a parking lot and wait for the rain to stop. wow now i see why i don't update often. this isn't exactly exciting journal material. <p>in other news, this weekend was fun times. friday night i stayed in and then decided to drive out to berts at 2 in the morning. on the drive home at 5 i was slapping myself to stay awake. saturday was geoffs bday bbq, i got tipsy and conversed with people i wouldn't normally converse with. last weekend i went out for dinner with my sister and she gave me a challenge. i had one week to start a conversation with a stranger that lasted at least three minutes long. i completed that task one day last week at work in talking to the hot dog vendor outside of no frills. but at geoffs bbq i saw graham, the guy i attempted to hit on the first time i met him at milwaukees when i was drunk. i wanted to talk to him, but felt awkward so eventually i said ""just dooo eeet"" so i got up, sat beside him and we talked for a while. gooo meee! i'm giving up on plans to go to hillside festival. its like asking people to go to hell with me or something. so now i have the weekend off july 22-24. somebody. somewhere. lets do something FUN!!!! PLEASE!! enough begging. <p>sunday night i went to the steam whistle party and finally got to meet  <lj user=""danorama"">. he was shorter than i imagined (but still taller than me) and had the best hair. i was so close to riding a mechanical bull that night but the skirt i was wearing said ""if you do, i'll flash the crowd!!"" so i decided not to. <p>one last thing. on saturday july ninth i'm going to a burlesque show with jeanine and my sister. tickets are 15 bucks or 25 for two people. i'm not sure if i've mentioned this before on here but...if you want to come, lemme know i can buy more tickets online. if you dress up you get a free goodie bag and i'll be busting the corset that night. you should all pay fifteen bucks just to see that shit yo! haha. peace."

"event","so i'm sure i'll be dead before summer ends. why's that you ask? because i seem to hurt myself at work every day. yesterday i dropped a pallet on my finger trying to help my manager move it. nothing broke. nothing serious. just fucking killed! and today, i was talking to a customer and said ""have a good 
day"" as he was leaving and he said ""as long as i'm upright its a good day"" and i laughed, and walked out from behind the counter and then my ankle collapsed and i fell on my hands and knees. spraining my ankle. thats the third time for old lefty. (the name of my ankle). i proceeded to work the rest of my 8 hour shift not realizing just how bad my ankle was until i got home. so maybe this means i won't have to work 11 days in a row. YAY.<p>other than stories about work, ghostface has pretty much got nothin. sorry peeps. life is dry right now."

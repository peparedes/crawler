"event","ok well its 11:10 in the monring right now..and im writeing in it now cause i didnt write last night..and just because i feel like writeing in it now.

Well last night was very awesome. So around 2:30 chris came and picked me up, and me, kyle, and sally went to the salvation army store. we bought a few things. Then we picked up Rob and Jessica at robs house. Then we went to kyles for a bit. After kyles we went to chris's and just hung out there for a bit. Before i go any futher..Last night we played at a party..and we had to be there at 7. It was a good friend my mine, Annelisa..shes pretty cool. But yes. back to when we were at chris's. I called jeremy to see if i could use his stack, cause the marshall was bein real gay. So he said yeah sure. So then me, chris, kyle, sally, rob, and jessica all went to jeremys. Well..first the van wouldnt start..soo we had to use chris's car to jump it. and man that was a project. So nick came when we were trying to jump the car. and he was helping us. we finally got it and we left for jeremys house.

So then nick stayed at chris's while we went to jeremys house. We got at jeremys house and NO one was there. so we were waiting for him for like a half hour 45 minutes. Then the van goes out on us. we couldnt get it to start again. which fuckin sucked..and jeremy was still not there! so then we called nick and he came to jump the van with his car. he called Laine to just to come ha. it still wouldnt work..but then 1 last try and it worked!!! we all started danceing and yelling and shit lol. so we couldnt wait for jeremy any more so we left. But when we were just goin by we saw his car pull up..so we jeted back and got his stack real quick. He had to go with his mom somewhere cause his g/f was over and his mom didnt want them two alone at his house. soo he was really sorry and pissed. So we jeted back to chris's house and started to pack all our amps and equipment real quick. it was like...6:45 we when got to chris's and was packing..i called meg i told her to real fast get to chris's..so we had everything packed at like 6:55..and meg just got there right when we were about to leave. wooo!!!

So we got to the party and we just made it. it was awesome! All the other bands were great! and ALOT of peolpe were there and it was just awesome. alot of peolpe from Low country and a few from waccamaw. Everyone liked us so i that ver cool. We played and we FUCKED SHIT UP!! lol. Annelisa's parents gave us 200 dollars as well for playing! Annelisa is like...really really rich..cause her party was at Litchfeild by the Sea...which is like..REALLY expensive..and she goes to a private school and shit..so yeah..pretty rich. But yes..last night was very fun.  

Well..i think im gona go..i dont think im gona sign it tonight cause i cant go out..and im just gona stay in and watch the superbowl. i was suppose to go to the Boys Night Out, The Beautiful Mistake, Moneen, and Senses Fail show. but i wont be back til like 3 or 4 in the morning..so i cant go. oh well. im out..LATER

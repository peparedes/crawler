For the past few months, I've been a hermit.  I've been an ass.  I've been a horrible friend.  These past few months, I have been so caught up in my own self pity/loathing that I've neglected many of you that I call ""friend"" or ""family"".  I haven't been true to myself, and I know that some of you look at me now and say ""Who the hell are you?  I don't know you anymore...""

And I would like to take the time now to say ""I'm sorry"".  I'm sorry for being as antisocial as I am.  I'm sorry for not being there when you needed me.  And most of all, I'm sorry for being such a downer when I have been there.  If I've wronged you, pissed you off, or disappointed you, then here is a mass-apology.  Expect a more personal one in the very near future.

I'm still not 100%.  I still have very low self-esteem, and I'm still slightly depressed.  I'm trying to fix both of those issues, but it's taking a little more work than I care to admit.  Just bear with me a little bit longer, and I'll be back to the annoying SOB that you all know and love (or hate...whatever your preference)

Again, I'm sorry, and I love you all.  Peace."

To start off, I'm getting ready to finish the laundry I started this morning.  Yes, that's right...they haven't been dried yet.  Some dumbass decided to wash and dry five loads at the same time today...as a result, I couldn't get a dryer until now.  I hate people.

Then, to make matters worse, I hit a dog on my way to work.  Little bastard just run right in front of the car, like it wasn't there.  Dog's alright, and as far as I can tell, there was just a little cosmetic damage on the car...so no big deal.  Still makes me a little late for work so I can check the damage out.

After that, I get my eyeballs screwed out at work.  Seven and a half hours of doom in my eye.  I think I spent several thousand today trying to get the damned thing to work.  They are NOT gonna be pleased with me tomorrow...

Storms are all over the place, and I'm stressed and pissed.  It's not been a good night.  I'm ready to go back to Mayfield.

Ah well, life goes on.  And so do I...gotta jet people.  Laters."

To top it all off, I've had maybe 4 hours of sleep...woke up freaking out from some dream at about 7 this morning, and I can't even remember what it was about.  I just remember waking up, grabbing a pillow, and throwing it at my door.  Why a pillow?  My hand is on it.  Why did I throw it?  I have no friggin' clue.

My boss is trying to butter me up for some reason.  Keeps trying to get buddy buddy.  Makes me a bit suspicious.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

OH!  For those of you who are wondering, I'll be at game on Sunday.  Wee!  I may drive down Saturday night after I get off work...I dunno, it just depends on how I feel that day.

<lj-cut text=""My thoughts on this"">. . .OK, to the Church of England, I would like to point something out: This is a <u><i>VIDEO GAME</i></u>.  It is fantasy.  If you look very closely, those ""people"" being shot are an alien lifeform that opposes you in the game.  Not humans.  Had there been an actual war, and some of your troops holed up in there to try and hide from enemy gunfire, they would more than likely get blown to kingdom come from enemy bombs.

Seriously people...this is fantasy.  If Sony didn't ask for permission to use the Manchester Church as a background/stage, then yes, there should be a formal apology, and England should get a small cut of the royalties.  However, it being over 6 months after the game was released before you say anything is a little bit on the DEE DEE DEE side.  If you were truly outraged at this, then you would've said something when the game first came out...not over half a year later.

Moral of the story:  People are stupid.  End rant.</lj-cut>"

"event","OK.  So I've been doing a LOT of reading on the whole VA Tech. shootings.  It's a tragedy...at least 30 dead, including the gunman, Cho Seung-Hui.  My heart and my prayers go out to the victims, students, professors, and families out there.

<lj-cut text=""That being said..."">
That being said, I would like to make one point perfectly clear here.  I've been reading a lot of reports from various students, lawyers, etc., that state that violence in the media may have attributed to this atrocity.  This is, in my opinion, the biggest crock there is.

There are millions of people across the world that watch these violent and disturbing movies, that listen to these rap and heavy metal lyrics, that play Grand Theft Auto and other various violent video games.  A very small percentage of these people actually go out and commit these heinous crimes...murder, rape, thievery.  The vast majority of us have the common sense to know better.

With the exception of the news and a few ""based on a true story"" deals, the violence in the media is fantasy. It's make-believe.  I play various violent games.  I have yet to go out and steal a car, run over some hookers, and bust some caps...and I don't plan on ever doing it.  I use these games to let out the stress of the day...to relax.  It's recreational, it's fun.  I use music and movies in the same fashion.

All of you nay-sayers out there against violence in video games and movies, take a look at another angle.  Look at how our children are being raised today.  I was waiting in line at Wal-Mart not too long ago, when I heard a five year old kid say ""Fuck you bitch, give me the candy.""  I turned around and saw that the child's mother was about 22.  She did nothing about it.  Had that been me, even today, I would've gotten grounded, a spanking, and then she would've told my father, and he would have added to my punishment.  I'm not saying beat these kids, but we definetly do need to discipline them.  

Parents need to step up and take the responsibility for raising their kids.  Don't let them grow up wild.  When they do something that they aren't supposed to, explain to them the first time that it is wrong, and that we shouldn't do it.  If they continue to do whatever it is, discipline them.  Time out, spanking, grounding...all of these are acceptable forms of punishment.  Again, when I say ""spanking"", I don't mean beat the kid.  I mean turn them over your knee, and spank them.  One or two slaps is all that's necessary.  
</lj-cut>

Gah, got off on a bit of a tangent there.  It just so happens that this whole ""let's blame violence on video games/movies/music and not on how people raise their kids"" thing is a pet peeve o' mine.  Enjoy the rantings of an Irvan...Peace."

three - Take care of yourself. Everything else will be taken care of in it's own time. 

four - Nice guys finish last because they usually have no confidence. It's the ones that have a backbone that you have to watch out for, assholes.

five - Look, for once in my life, there's very little drama. I'd like to keep it that way. Stop fuckin' around with my family, dammit.

six - Look. Things didn't work out between us. I told you I would like to remain your friend. Stop being such a bitch and talk to me.

seven - Mate, while you were a good friend back in the day, you really screwed up things between us when you started the creepy bit. Dubya Tee Eff.

eight - Sometimes, I wish I'd never opened up at all.

nine - You're giving me a headache. Cheer up emo kid.

ten - I really don't care what you say or think about me. I'm doing something for me for a change. If you don't like it, piss off. I don't need you.

eleven - There are so many things I wish I could say to you right now. I guess I'll never get that chance.

twelve - Dude, that little bit o' optimism that you keep throwing out really keeps me going. You don't know it, but you've really helped me with things. Thanks.

thirteen - STOP GROWING UP! YOU MAKE ME FEEL OLD!

fourteen - You need to take care of some rather important matters in your life before I can work with you.

fifteen - I hate to say I told you so, but . . .

sixteen - You don't need pills. You don't need alcohol. The only thing that can make you happy is you. Get over it.

seventeen - Do whatever it is that makes you happy. As long as I can see a smile on your face, I'm content with life.

eighteen - I'm sorry I've been such an ass here lately. As soon as I get things settled, I'm taking you all out to dinner, whether you like it or not.

nineteen - How do I say this? Even with things done anonymously, I can't say what's truly on my mind.

twenty - I don't know you. You don't know me. All I have to say is, remember: She's one of my girls. She calls me crying because of something you've done, and there will be Hell to pay. There is no place you can hide, and noone that will be able to help you. Please bear that in mind.

<lj-cut text=""Explanation:"">
So my little rant last night prompted me to explain myself today.  Last night, during what was an easy night at work, I got thrown on a machine for 3 hours.  Normally, this wouldn't bother me so much.  However, this machine was broke because of the stupidity of some idiot operator that didn't want to work.  He goes and scratches a lens on a photoeye, which in turn causes it not to ""see"" anymore.  Normally, this isn't an issue.

However, this was a photoeye we don't keep in stock.  As a matter of fact, the computer, when I ask where it is, pretty much tells me ""What the hell is this?"".  So I go searching for a suitable replacement.  Get three of the them out there, wire them up one at a time...none of them work.

Three.  Hours.  Because of people not wanting to do their job.  

Also...for those of you that think this ""I hate people"" thing is me being anti-social...I leave you with this.  Yes, I hate people.  The general population in the Mount Vernon area has the IQ of a lemming.  But persons, I can get along with.  I like persons.

Playing WoW.

I know, I haven't touched WoW in months.&nbsp; But, with the new expansion out, I admit I was weak...I heard the voice of Illidan saying ""You know you wanna...come play.&nbsp; There's Blood Elves now...they're teh coolness...come on, play WoW...we have cookies.""&nbsp; So I caved, bought the expansion, and have had my soul ripped from my body once more. *sigh*

"event","Ladies (and gentlemen, if you happen to have the answer for it...lol), I just have have one quick question to ask you...

Why the hell are women attracted to assholes, dickheads, and just overall bastards?  I'd really like to know.  Because for the most part (there are always exceptions...), every time that I personally show interest in someone, they've got their heads stuck up some bastard's ass.

I'm sorry...I know it appears that I am jealous of these individuals.  I, am fact, am not.  I happen to like being the nice guy...except for the fact that I'm completely ignored on the dating scene.  And why is that?  Because I'm (usually) the nice guy.  I try my damnedest to not treat a lady like property or shit.  Apparently, that's what's hot these days.

I'm not the best looking guy in the world.  I'm not hideous, but I know I'm not the best looking.  And I'm not the richest guy there is...I do well for myself, but I'm definitely not swimming through a personal vault full of treasure and riches in Duckburg, if ya know what I mean.  But I'm a nice guy.  I can (and do) treat a lady with respect and as an equal.  I'm not a sex hungry maniac like most guys appear to be (especially the assholes in question...)...overall, I don't think I'm that bad of a catch.  I'd just like to know how it is that I'm always hitting these damned dry dating spells, and Captain Does-Nothing-To-Better-His-Life the Pothead, with his mighty ""Women are Property that I can do Whatever I Want to With"" hammer manages to get a date every single time.

I just...I dunno.  It baffles me.  It makes the brain hurt.

"event","OK, so it's not the most original idea, but it's still a good one.  And it really makes you think...

As we all know, it's that time of year where we reflect on the things we are thankful for...enclosed is a short list all the things I'm thankful for, be they good or bad.

<lj-cut text=""I'm thankful for..."">I'm thankful for...

- serving a God that can guide me through the darkest of times.

- having a family that loves me, no matter what I do.

- having the friends that I have.  The ones that have held me when I was bawling my eyes out, and didn't know what to do.

- being with, and losing, someone that I cared about deeply.  Losing her opened my eyes to so many things about me, and it is slowly making me a better person.

- the people that come to my door crying.  Every one of you who have called me at 3 in the morning over your life's troubles, with or without tears, you reminded me of why I'm here.  I thank you for that.

- having a job.  Despite the fact that I complain about it constantly, it could be much worse.  I could be unemployed, and in deep shite.

- for all of you that I don't consider ""friends"", but family.  Though we don't have the ties of blood, I still consider you to be as close as my own brother and sister.  I love you, and you know who you are.</lj-cut>

And there we have it, my un-original list.  Bwhahaha.  Much less than three you guys, and I hope you all have a Happy Thanksgiving."

Therefore, I post.

My apartment is quite silent.  I expected my roommate to be playing Final Fantasy XII when I got in.  The loser isn't even home...and he took the PS2 with him.  Sad day...lol

Had fun this weekend...despite getting lost in Nashville.  Note to self...I-24 leads straight to Hickory Hollow Mall.  Remember that.  And did you guys know there's a building that looks like Batman in downtown Nashville?

*sigh* so Starr threw me under the truck in game last night...thanks Starr.  I needed that big ol' Semi in my face.  Appreciate the status and all...but did you have to volunteer me for Sherriff :P.

Tralalala...so I think I'm done with the being random and such.  I think I'ma go pop a movie in and chill for a while.

So, I've been settling in, getting used to working this 3-11 shift.  And getting my ass handed to me whilst I'm at it...lol.  Jeebus...I don't think I've had this many new problems bite me in the ass all at once before.

But eh...that's not what's really keeping me awake.  To tell the truth, I don't really know what's keeping me awake at three o'clock in the morning.

Friends o' mine are in town.  I'm hoping I'll get to hang out with them some this weekend...I haven't seen them in a few months.  And Cody is coming back this month, as well.  She'll be in town Tuesday...I is happy :).  Planning on maybe trying to take her and a coupla others out to Nashville or something.  I dunno.  We'll see.

The emo-ness has been trying to sneaks it way back into my life.  I keep it at bay with a good healthy dose of Final Fantasy XII in my life.  It's a gorgeous game, though it does take a little getting used to.  I strongly recommend it.

No...I catch myself every now and again wishing that things had worked out differently over the past few months.  I still wonder what might have been...but eh, I don't let it bother nearly as much now.  Life happens...you just have to deal with it and move on.

Wow...we're bouncing all over the place here, aren't we?  OMG!Con 2007 is practically right around the corner...I can't wait.  I'm supposed to be assistant manager of the security staff...ought to be fun, eh?  Here's hoping I get to do ""Whose Line is it Anime?"" again...that was fun :).  *insert geek glasses and otaku kanji here*

Meh...I'm done rambling.  Hope I haven't confused too many of you.  Have a day peoples...hopefully, I'll see some of you tomorrow night.</lj-cut>

So, I haven't written anything here in a while now.  Figured now was as good a time as any, seeing as I've come to an important decision in my life.

I'm leaving Continental Tire.  I'm coming back to the Mayfield area, and I'm going to start going back to college.  I want to get my Bachelor's degree...I'm thinking I'll get it in Computer Science.

As such...I've bought a laptop.  It should be here in a couple of days.  I will be selling my lovely desktop.  If ou or someone you know is interested, gimme a call or drop me an email, and we'll talk.  I may have given one or two of you a price on it already...sorry, but that price won't cut it anymore.  I'm going to take the best offer...I know how much I want for it, but I also have a decent idea of what I'll get for it.

Computer has a completely legal copy of Windows XP Home on it...a DVD+/-RW with Dual Layer capability...a 52x CD-ROM, Sound Blaster X-Fi sound system...which has DD surround sound capability.  Intel Celeron 2.66 GHz processor and will have 1 GB of RAM, once I find what I did with that other stick...it currently has 768 MB of RAM, and can hold up to 2 gigs.  2 40 GB hard drives, and a ATI All-in-Wonder 9600 series vid card round out most of the hardware specs.  Included with the compy will be a wireless keyboard and mouse, monitor, and a set o' speakers.

Software wise, I'm not really going to leave a whole lot on here.  OpenOffice.org, AVG, Mozilla Firefox, World of WarCraft, Nero, and Guild Wars are all I really plan to leave on it once I sell it.  Most everything else is going to be transfered to the portable.  Also, I'll leave the PC-link that I bought for the 360 in the deal, so that you won't have any trouble transferring files and such over.

And I've totally made this blog an advertisement...moving on...

Some of you are probably wondering why in the world I would want to quit such a good paying job to go back to school.  After all, I make $20+ an hour, not counting overtime, and it's full time work.  The answer is quite simple, really.  No matter how much money I might be pulling in, I'm not happy.

I never see my family.  I rarely see my friends.  I have to drive 2 hours to see anybody that I consider a loved one.  The job in and of itself, is horrible.  When you can see the anklets on the cleaning crew, you know things are bad.  I work OUTRAGEOUS amounts of OT, and things are just steadily going downhill for that company.  It's not a good work environment, and I just don't want a part of it anymore.

So here's what I'm doing.  Next time I'm in Paducah, I'm opening a savings account.  I'm putting a selected amount o' mula in said account every week, in order to build up some reserves.  If anyone catches me withdrawing from this account, except in EXTREME emergencies, I give them full permission to beat some sense into me. 

As soon as I hear back from MSU, I'm going to start looking for work in that area for sometime around July or August.  By then, I hope to give CTNA a swift kick in the ass and a friendly bird as I walk out the door.  I'll also be looking for an apartment on the cheap, or quite possibly be looking into moving into the dorms. 

And, most importantly of all, I'm going to be happy.  No more of this emo BS.  I'm going to get my life in order, spend time with my friends and family, and smile.  A lot.  You people will just have to get used to that.


So yeah...end rant.  I guess I wanted to make this one count.  See you guys soon!  Much less than three you guys ^_^</lj-cut>"

"event","Two months, and she's still pretty unhappy with me.  Safe to assume I'm free to play the field then, I would say.  Thoughts?

<lj-cut text=""Read more here..."">So I got a phone call from a dear friend of mine that I hadn't talked to in forever, Nicole.  Her husband has recently joined the military, and she was basically just calling to catch up and fill me in on his progress.  She also just happens to be a good friend of Laura, whom I was dating until just a couple of months ago.

We caught up, told some stories, shared a few laughs.  Then I asked how Laura had been.  She hadn't returned any calls or e-mails, so in the typical Irvan fashion, I thought that there was a good chance she still didn't want to talk to me.  Nicole's response: ""Yep, she's still pretty pissed at you.""  I knew she was upset with me...didn't realize she was pissed.  Either way...if she still doesn't want to talk to me after two months, I'd say it's a safe bet that we're officially single, right?

I dunno...I really wish she would just come out and say ""Hey, jackass...get over it...we're through"" or even ""Fuck off, you slack jawed junk slut"".  Hell, even a simple ""Piss off"" would work.  I would at least like to talk it out...get the closure.  Not have this ""Let's just not talk about it"" bullshit.  

Blargh...I just dunno anymore.  I know that I'm going to start dating again.  I'm tired of moping around the apartment, being lonely, and having nothing to do and noone to talk to.  I need to get on with my life, and that's what I'm going to do.</lj-cut>

Above you'll see a little bit of ranting from the Irvan...it felt good to get it out in the open.  

If things work out the way I want them to, I'll be at the From Dusk till Dawn game in Paducah Sunday.  I may not stay for the whole thing, being as I work 12 hours Sunday morning, but I'll be there for the most part.  Hope to see you guys there.  Should be lots and lots of rampant violence and destruction :).

Yay for ranting after work...off to the bed place for me!  Tra la la~"

There are some of us...rare as we may seem to be, who are looking to find that right girl, someone who is compatible physically, emotionally, and mentally.  Please don't generalize and say that all men want is sex.  When you do, you really piss off the few ""good guys"" that there are...and we don't forget it very easily.</lj-cut>

*sigh* Sorry folks...had to get that outta my system.  It's just something that crossed my mind on the way home today.  Hoorah 2 hour road trips!

I'ma go lie down before work...later peoples!"

"event","So I didn't go home yestersday.  Didn't feel like driving two hours when I wouldn't be able to hang out with everyone.  Maybe next week.

Instead, I've been geeking out at the apartment.  Bought the WoW d20 handbook, and seasons one and two of Knight Rider.  I want my own K.I.T.T.  That car is teh roxxors.

Anywho...toodles..."

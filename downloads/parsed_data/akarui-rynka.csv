"event","So I posted this to facebook earlier today:

""This afternoon, I'm wearing red and sitting in the stands of a high school soccer stadium watching Crown Point play against Andrean.Wearing red today doesn't really identify who I'm cheering for (as it's both school's primary color), but last night primary school colors meant nothing. All across three counties (at least) the color of the night was orange. 
For those of you who don't follow high school sports, Wednesday night Jake West, #26 for the LaPorte Slicers, collapsed during football practice and died later that night. On Friday night, at games across the area moments of silence were held in honor of the fallen player. Orange tape, stickers with the number 26, socks, and even jerseys were worn by players of other schools.

On Friday, the Slicers took the field at Merrillville High School, as was the wishes of Jake's teammates and family. The LaPorte fans travelled the hour and a half in droves to support their team in this time of need. It may have been the Pirates' homecoming but a sea of orange and banners displaying the number 26 were prevalent on both sides of the field. (And let me tell you orange and purple aren't typically worn together for a reason!) The typical homecoming banners and chants about defeating the other team were replaced with orange bandanas, a standing ovation for the arrival of the visiting team, and even a ""give me a J, A, K, E, W, E, S, T... what does that spell"" chant when the Slicers scored. At the end of the game both schools chanted together ""we believe in 26"" as a specially made flag bearing his number and school colors was lowered from the Pirate flag pole and presented by team captains to the Slicer coach. The solemn ceremony continued as the LaPorte coach gave Jake's jersey to his parents. 
The score of the game is irrelevant, no records were broken, no extraordinary plays attempted. Football was played. Healing began.""

It actually took me about half of a game to compose and edit, all while answering calls about the score and doing a map search of tomorrow's game location. 
I'm pretty sure my mom is the only person on facebook who actually read the whole thing. She keeps asking me what other people commented and whatnot. 
I hate to tell her that my friends aren't big high school sports fans and that first paragraph doesn't let on that the post is about something bigger than a the color of the shirt I was wearing at the soccer game. 

But she showed my sister at GK's cheering event this evening and now I'm fielding very lovely, flattering texts about how I should send that to the comments to the editor's section of the local paper and how I've missed my calling. And perhaps they'll read my well-written words and decide to pay me to write some column... or something. 

I do love my sister, and I'm rather fond of my writing skills as well, but let's be serious."

An idea popped into my head, and I followed it a little to see if it was viable. Or another small thing that could be worked into something else. 

Well, not only was the first idea interesting, but the second/spin-off idea, and the one that came from that. 
No, no, no. Stop. 

What was that tip? Write down the idea and everything that you have to go with it then close the file and go back to the one you're actually trying to finish.

"event","News from the job search.
I didn't get either of the two high school positions that were open, I didn't even get an interview. Or a rejection letter for that matter. Makes me wonder if I filled out my application correctly.

Dawn thinks I should apply for a position at the Middle School <strike>from hell</strike>, but I'm not actually sure if I'm qualified for that position. 

Anyway, I also did not get summer school this year, which is bad for my check book, but maybe good for my sanity. 
1. I'd have to take off two days for the wedding anyway (which they highly frown upon).
2. Ma and I want to take a vacation to North Carolina at the end of July. ...although come to think of it so much crap is going on this summer that it's not even like we're going before summer school would have let out anyway. 


This week alone has proven why I can't be in charge of planning too many things at once. 
Between just coming down from planning Tiff's Shower, which went off with many hitches, none of which the guests really realized. So a success, but not without stress.

Then I had my mom's semi-surprise birthday outing to orchestrate. Which too many balls fell crashing to the ground. If only thinking about it and doing it were the same thing. Forgot the cake (picked it up AFTER dinner), forgot to place an order for her name to be on the scoreboard, didn't realize that we could get something special set up for them to bring her a gift if we'd done it the day before. (though Sis did manage to get them to bring her something).
Now I need to finalize the Bachelorette Party for two weeks from tomorrow. Invite all those girls and arrange transportation/sleeping situations. And make sure all the things I need to finish out the school year are done. Including clean anything out of my desk that I don't want to leave behind should I actually get hired in August for something as Dawn keeps thinking will happen. I think she's living in a fairy tale, but whatever. 

All while not forgetting about graduation, the bowling tournament, my commitments to cantor at church, my community outreach group (which I'm supposed to be a leader in!!!!), and on top of that several people are retiring and there are going away parties I've committed to, and always always bills to remember to pay, applications to send before deadlines, and magically I need to convince the state that I'm fit to teach. (and then register for classes to prove it)...oh that reminds me I need to listen to a voicemail from IUN. 


To hell with all of this. Time to meet ifreet for dinner, drinks, and a heist movie!!!!"

"event","So, I'm trying to write a resume/fill out an application for a Science teaching job at the school, and I can't remember the dates and names of things I did at Kohl's. Then I remembered that I used to tell livejournal everything back then and the accomplishments of winning that trophy were sure to be listed somewhere. 

Now if only I could figure out how to answer the diversity questions I'd be great. 

'name a positive and/or negative experience with a different racial/ethnic group.'

Seriously? I get why the question is in the application, but I so don't think about things like what racial/ethnic group someone belongs in when I have an interaction with them. Or I have no idea which ones to write about because nothing I can think of would highlight the differences in our racial background."

"event","So, I keep having a dream featuring work. Only, it all seems to be about work politics and not actual work. 
From what I can tell, it may not even take place in a school. But someone else has my job. I still work in the building, but not in the same capacity. 
I still talk to my former coworker/boss (who at times is my sister) but have yet to meet the young man who took my place. I believe I learned his name a while back, but cannot tell you what it is now. 

Last night, I dreamt that I was in the back parking lot and his car which was the same make and model as mine, was parked in the bus lane. Either the keys were in the ignition or my keys unlocked it. But either way I was inside and the high tech features (which do not exist in real life) told me that this car was connected to an email address that was very, very similar to mine. In fact could have been in a list of fake email addresses used in phishing scams. 

Anyway, I decided to move his car from the back lot to the front lot, and then, told his supervisor (at this point my sister) where it was if he couldn't find it. 

The following morning in dreamland, while Steve was waiting for his ride to appear to take him to work, a car pulled up in front of our house. The car I recognized, the man who got out I did not. (Though, he sort of looks like on of the guys in the comic book I was reading yesterday) He parked his black (not red) car at the edge of my driveway while the bus that came to get Steve was parked in the driveway (presumably to turn around). The man was shouting things as Steve was heading out to get on the bus. I had the option of either hiding inside or going to the door to confront him (through the screen door). He saw me and began to shout, ""So you took my car. Let's see how you like if if I take your--"" he trailed off as he entered the side rear door of the bus and through the widows I could see him head to the driver's seat like he had planned to take 'my' bus. Only to realize that this was a public bus, complete with no-nonsense bus driver who must have told him to take his seat, because as the bus backed out of the drive and pulled down the street that's what he did. 

Aside from the odd dream twists, including the fact that a Public Transit bus from the nearby city would be picking my brother up at home, let alone in our driveway! Or that this idiot would assume that a bus parked (ever so briefly) in my driveway somehow belonged to anyone in my house. 
Idk, but I did wake up just after the bus left laughing. 
Had a brief moment where I wondered just what the hell I'd been dreaming, and then resumed sleeping. I believe after that my dreamself contacted the police about the odd things that had occurred. Fully admitting the juvenile prank of moving his car from one lot to the other, but not feeling comfortable with the fact that he came to my house, and other creepy things that I'd discovered about him."

"event","What?

So my dvr recorded six hours of Psych on Friday. Apparently, not actually watching commercials and watching things up to a week past its original aire date create the not knowing of special events. 

Six hours. Seven episodes. All night long. 

People planned slumber parties, ate pineapple, shot videos, tweeted...etc. 
Somewhere during each episode was supposed to be a codeword to be entered but I never caught one (after the very first time they mentioned it and I believe the codeword was pineapple). Oh well, not like I watched it live, anyway. 

I decided what the hell. Sure I've seen just about all of seasons 1-4, and a handful from five... only the first two of six. So, there's a chance I've seen all the fan-favorites that were voted on to appear. 

Well, seven episodes (in almost the right order).
Last Night Gus, American Duos, Lights, Camera...Homicidio, Tuesday the 17th, Heeeeere's Lassie, Lassie Did a Bad, Bad Thing, and Shawn (and Gus) of the Dead. 

Okay...so Heeeeere's Lassie, I hadn't seen. And there were a handful of references to the previous episode in it, but the Shining references were quite hysterical. 

Season One...nada, Season Two...three eps, Season Three...two eps, Season Four...nope, Season Five...nyet, Season Six..two eps. 

The slumber party segments between include Gus appearing at the Psych office/Shawn's for a stake-out only to learn that it is in fact a Slumber Party. Then being upset that he doesn't have all the things he would need to get a good night's sleep, for Shawn to explain to him that people don't sleep at slumber parties. 
Through three episodes, it's just Shawn and Gus, drinking from straws, not playing spin the bottle, Shawn trying to put Gus' hand in a bowl of water...even though he's still awake. 
Half way through the night Jules shows up in response to a 319 called in by Shawn. Only to arrive and learn that there is no intruder...Shawn corrects himself saying he meant a 413...to which Jules questions the indecent exposure and Shawn contemplates if that might happen at some point. Jules enters listing off all the things she's going to do to make this a successful slumber party. All of which Shawn finds sexy. 
Later there's a pj bit, where Gus gets a one-piece complete with butt-flap. Only to announce that he never goes anywhere without a set of pj's. Despite Shawn and Jules' encouragement he decides to go change. (Shawn wants a butt-flap)
...While making crank calls, sending pizzas...anchovy pizzas (hold everything but the anchovies) to Lassiter's, in storms none other than Lassie himself insisting, at gun point, that they hang up the phone. Crank calls are a felony and he could have them arrested. Especially for making LAME pranks. So to demonstrate he does a very peculiar voice into the phone that they have just dialed and handed to him...only to learn that he's calling Chief Vic, who can totally tell that it's Lassie. Oops. (P.S. Lassie showed up with a huge beard...he's undercover in a beard-growing ring)
As the night wears on they try putting shaving cream in Gus' hand while Jules tickles his face with a feather....while he's still awake! 
Everyone is trying very hard to stay awake...it seems to be failing.

Each of the four falls asleep and dreams...
Jules: Gus and Lassie had to go home and it's just her and Shawn...whatever shall they do?
Shawn: Jules has fallen asleep, so now it's just him. (Lassie and Gus are still there, but also asleep). More delicious pancakes all for him.
Gus: On the phone with someone learns that Pluto has been reinstated as a planet. (You were always a planet to me, Pluto)
Lassie: Shawn tells him that he and Gus are getting out of the Psychic-detective business and leaving crime-solving to the professionals.

...Everyone is awake except Lassie...so deciding if they should wake him or not... The guys produce scissors and electric clippers... 

(Also, the Psych-O's who stayed awake got their tweets scrolling across the bottom of the screen, and their TOUT videos displayed during the commercial breaks)

The most fascinating part was the quality of commercials as the night went on. It started out with regular USA commercials, drifting into mini-infomericals...into girls with phones and webcams wanting you to call or chat...and that really long trojan commercial about their new personal vibrator 'the twist'...and then around 5 am real commercials began to emerge, and only the trojan commercial remained of the questionable middle of the night adverts. 

All in all...it was a very interesting night, and had we been in college, we totally would have forgone sleep on a friday night to tweet and make videos and be a real part of the entertainment. I dare say there might have been pineapples."

Oddly enough my phone thinks it was yesterday. I cannot figure out where it is getting this misinformation. Although, I'm guessing it's my email, because it says that yesterday was Rei Hino's birthday. 

Steven and I are on the last disc of the third season of The Big Bang Theory. I find it hysterical that he loves this show, even though he can't possibly understand half of the dialogue. Good thing there are plenty of physical hijinks involved. 

So...as last year I have continued on with my overly-complex story featuring Raj (the quirky, selectively-mute Indian) and his getting a significant other. Last year, I promised story and then promptly stopped writing it. It seems I only write about these people during winter break. An interesting discovery, I must say. 

Over this break I have actually written a lot, but not the introduction to the character...soo....I will not likely be posting said story any time soon. 

If I did which format would be more pleasing to read:
a. script-like-format with dialogue and important blocking cues added
b. story-like-format with you know actual descriptions of things, people, mannerisms, and the occasional internal thoughts. 


Also, watching too many episodes in a row affects internal speech patterns and the way that I phrase sentences when writing. Enjoy."

"event","<a href=""http://akarui-rynka.livejournal.com/2012/01/03/""> Last Year's Resolutions</a> 
Um...1. that's a laugh. Every time I start other people in my house make a big deal about it and well...I get discouraged. 2. If updating facebook counts as writing, that might have come to pass. 3. Is buying a new car a good investment? 4. This I actually did. I took a test that makes me highly qualified. (as for the 3 facebook rez's ((see comments)) 1. check. 2. I did well, but lost it maybe twice. 3. I did better than in the past, but could still use some work on meeting up with people irl.)

Resolutions, resolutions, resolutions... hmm... let's start with something easier.
2012 recap: 
I ate ethnic food. Lots of it. 
I adopted two students. They do not live with me, but at school they call me 'mom' and I call them 'son' and 'daughter'. Also, I nagged my son and shamed him when his English work was not done to the point of him actually turning in enough work to get a C+/B- in Advanced Comp (considering he failed it the first time he took it, and I actually only got a C when I took it--I chose a bad subject--I was very proud.) He graduated in May. My daughter is a senior this year, and aside from being a little mini-me (albeit Indian) a few students have actually taken to thinking that she is my real daughter. Ie. aside from the obvious coloring differences, and the fact that she's short and I'm not...they think we look and act alike. They are not entirely wrong. 

Speaking of students...The family that moved in down the street is from Palestine and two of the boys are in my class. I have taken to giving them rides home because we live so close. Also, they make me food in appreciation. It is a good deal. 

The ENL club is still going strong, we are the second biggest club at school. With it I took my first trip to the Museum of Science and Industry in April. So much nerdy fun. 

Also, bought a new car in April. Named her Kekona...Hawaiian girl's name meaning second born. Since the reason I named Haruko what I did was some random kanji that spells Haruko can mean 1st born son. I thought I'd stick with the theme. Tiffany calls her Ruby. 

I saw many concerts this year. The Gym Class Heroes at tiny local college. Hot Chelle Rae at a County Fair in same town. (How they trick artists into thinking they are a big place, I do not know. But keep up the magic!)
Also saw Marian Call, twice. Once in a very hip bar on the South Side, the other at FermiLab! 
How To Train Your Dragon LIVE rounds out the professional live entertainment of the year, unless I've forgotten something. Baseball games, there were a few. Local theater stuff, ditto. 

Hmm... Boys... I need to get out more. 
Dane's brother is kind of adorable, but I only met him for one day. 
Paul's friend is geographically undesirable, but whatev's. 
Massage-Therapy boy no longer works there. I actually got condoled for my loss. It was...odd. I still have his contact info, but have not been brave enough to pursue. Or even call to request a private massage. 
Hm, what else? Oh students like to hit on me...it's reeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly shudder-worthy. 
There's a tall teacher at school. He's a bit anti-social--in that he eats lunch alone in his room instead of in the lounge with the rest of the English teachers, but we've progressed from him calling me Miss Akarui, to actually calling me Ryn. That was a little bit of a surprise actually. Pleasantly, though. 

So this year...

I resolve...to write about Raj and Taylor even when I'm not on vacation from work.

To take an awesome trip.

To finish one story, even a short one. 

To read more actual books already on my shelves. 

To stay out of the relationship advice game.

To make my basement a place I can bring guests, and host a spring-time party. Yes. This. This I really want to accomplish."

"event","Ah, brothers. 
Brothers and laundry.

One brother is almost constantly doing laundry...often household towels, but still.
The other takes about a three days to complete one load. 

So as I mentioned, it's College Go Week. And I have been wearing college gear all week. Well, I've been wanting to wear some of my hoodies today and tomorrow. 
I cannot locate my new red PUMAS hoodie, but my white 'GO TREES!' hoodie is sitting on top of my laundry pile. As I've pretty much worn it for the past three saturday's straight. (did I mention, I can't find the other one?)

So anyway, last night, Pete had a load of 'whites' in the washer when I got home from work. He came home, went to bed, did nothing with his clothing. This morning, he moved them into the dryer. 

So after dinner I made a light load with my hoodie and some other things. 
It has been waiting to go in the dryer for about an hour or so. 

Dick wanted me to do something silly. Like listen for the oven timer to go off and remove his chicken patty then wrap it up and put it in the fridge for him to eat tomorrow. I agreed on the condition that he remove Pete's things from the dryer. 
He argued that Pete doesn't like it when he touches his things, which is totally true. So I said we could just tell him I did it, but I don't want to remove his socks and underwear from any appliance. 
Dick thought about this for a few seconds and came to the conclusion that he would have to ask Mother to take care of his chicken patty.

About ten minutes later Pete came home. And I excitedly proclaimed his arrival with the phrase, 'you can empty the dryer so that I can put my clothes in the dryer so that I can wear them to work tomorrow.'
And he replied, 'Why would you wash clothes that you wanted to wear to work tomorrow?!""
... 'Um, so that they will be clean?' ...'Hey, I wanted to wash them yesterday, but the washer was full of your stuff'

Pete huffs his way down the stairs and tells me that I'm a doofus. To which I simply retort, I'm a doofus because I want the clothes that I wear to work in the morning to be clean? Or something to that effect. 

Anyway, brothers are weird. I've given up on trying to figure them out. I feel like I'm an anthropologist studying a strange primate species and reporting about their habits."

"event","Oh internet, you are a source of much hilarity. 

1. People actually ask on yahoo, ""why is my brother so stupid?"" 

Many of the answers are way to serious. Usually, when people ask this question it is to vent about someone currently annoying them. 

2. Also, there's a tumblr thread on the subject. The tags are the best part. Although, the story of two brothers having an argument that ended with a 'your mom' insult was rather comical. 

3. It's College Go Week at my school. Now I realize that College Go Week was actually in September, but we were having Homecoming that week, and we wanted to separated them, so the week we were taking the PSAT and discussing the Work Keys test and careers with the students seemed like a good week to move it to. 

Anyway, each day they play a school fight song, and if a student a. guesses the school correctly, or b. just happens to be wearing apparel from that school, he/she gets entered into a drawing for that day.

Every Monday, is Notre Dame. Or at least for the past four years it has been. So naturally, my mom and I wore ND on Monday. (teachers and staff can play too)
Monday night, I went home and listened to a handful of school songs to see if I could recognize them later in the week. So far I've been 3 for 3. (It helps that they only play Indiana schools) 

But along the way... I discovered a few things. 

1. University of Illinois, from whom Merrillville's school song was inspired/stolen, has an interesting line, according to the internet. 

Merrillville's 1st Verse:

We're loyal to you Merrillville High!
We're purple and white Merrillville High!
We'll back you to stand. 
You're the best in the land!
For we know that you will stand, Merrillville High! 

(okay, so it's a little repetitive and wordy)
But Illinois' is:

We're loyal to you, Illinois!
We're Orange and Blue, Illinois!
We'll back you to stand, 
'Gainst the best in the land
For we know you have sand, Illinois. 


SAND?! The lyrics are actually about SAND?!? WTH?


But that's not the best one that I ran across:
<lj-embed id=""15""/>

I rather enjoy the couplet:

""Where the girls are the fairest, 
 The boys are the squarest.""

Okay, your turn. Most random fight song lyrics you can find. GO!"

"event","So this morning I took my nephew to the dentist (for the second week in a row) while my mom took Pete to his own appointment (probably the first in years).

So TJ needed some extra attention because of decay around his braces, they did the right side last week and the left this week so that he wouldn't be numb on both sides. No big deal. Aside from last week when he locked himself out of his house and the spare keys were with his mom and mine. Sigh. That was a lot of gas, and he ate cold cheeseburgers. 

Pete, on the other hand, needed to go to the dentist because he lost part of one of his front teeth. He lost it in his sleep. (has the other part, mind you) Thinks he punched himself in the face or something... but in reality Ma and I think that it probably just rotted away. That's what several cans of Coke a day, cigarettes and a lack of brushing will do to you. Dentist confirmed that it was decay that ultimately caused the tooth breaking. We also learned that Pete can't go to the dentist by himself. I don't just mean to the office either, my ma had to sit in the extra chair while he got his cleaning and exam. 

On the way back from dropping TJ off I passed a pair of boys--probably middleschoolers-- ambling down the road. They were walking side by side, and the one on the inside had found a stick and was randomly striking the ground with it as they walked. I had this flashback to any movie set in a 'simpler' time where two boys are walking along the country road. One is almost always playing with a stick. It made me smile to think that no matter how far we come some things will never change.


Then later tonight I got a call from one Jesse Becker who says we've never met but have a mutual friend in Justin Daily, whom I know from St. Joe's.  Um...Justin, who? 
Not wanting to be completely rude, I'm like I, uh, vaguely remember him...what's this about?
So Jesse is calling me to see if I want to join his business along with Justin and his wife. I actually missed most of the details of said business, but it involves working with/for big companies and requires 5-10 hours of work a week...I'm thinking internet gig. And not really my cup of tea. But thanks anyway.

It's just been a very random day. Now it's time to watch some Grimm."

In Biology, need a 157 to pass in the state of Indiana.

I received a 173. (out of a possible 200)

Of the 150 questions, I missed 36 of them. 
Of the 150 questions, there were approximately five that I had no idea what they were asking about, now mind you, I answered every question and could have guessed correctly on at least one of those. There were a lot of questions about specific hormones and their functions in various processes. 

But I am glad that I studied. And grateful that Becky-nee put me up for the night. 


So today, I went and talked to the head guidance counselor at the high school. She said that with my praxis scores I could just go to the DOE website and apply for a license. 
Really? That seems too easy. 

Okay. I've been to www.doe.in.gov and it's not 'easy' because I don't know how to answer their questions. Mostly, because I don't know if they're asking about my knowledge of biology or secondary education type classes. 

Okay, I'm not seeing anything on the IDOE website that says you can just take a test and poof apply to be licensed. Perhaps I'm missing it, or she was wrong. I'm not really sure. I think I need to find a person who had either done this before or specializes in understanding state legal crap."

Now, upon looking through my old notebooks, I've come across this and decided what the hell, might as well share what I've got. (There were a few lines I tried to change and decided that the original words made just as much sense as anything I could come up with)

Note: due to the nature of this parody the lyrics are more literal than symbolic.
Can you identify the inspiration?

<u>Sugar, We're Coming Down</u>
(original tune and lyrics from ""Sugar, We're Going Down"" by Fall Out Boy)

Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been trying to kill you anytime that you come near
'Cause that's just who I am this week.
Lie on the beach down from the naval ship yard.

I'm just a pawn to your Queendom,
But you're just a mission gone wrong.
Change the war. 
Stop the world.
We're always standing up 
And standing on the wrong side. 

We're coming down, down from the stars to the ground
And, Sugar, we're coming down fighting.
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex; cock it and pull it. 
(Repeat)

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me I'm watching you speak from the shadows
Waiting to bring and end to your false peace.
Isn't it messed up how I'm still failing to kill you?

I'm just a pawn to your Queendom
But you're just a mission gone wrong.
Change the war. 
Stop the world.
We're always speaking out 
And speaking for the wrong dream.

We're coming down, down from the stars to the ground.
And, Sugar, we're coming down fighting.
I'll be your number one with a bullet.
A loaded God complex; cock it and pull it. 
(repeat)

Down, down from the stars to the ground
And Sugar, we're coming down fighting
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're coming down, down from the stars to the ground (Take aim at myself) 
(Down, down from the stars to the ground)
And Sugar, we're coming down fighting (Take back what you said) 
(Down, down from the stars to the ground)
I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself) 
(Down, down from the stars to the ground)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

"event","I need some inspiration. 

I almost want to take a road trip. I'm off for the summer. I've got a bit in savings. 

The story I've been not writing for nearly six years now involves a road trip. Maybe instead of looking at maps and guestimating I should just hop in my car and check them out. 

Of course, the likelihood of this is low. I'm not quite that spontaneous. If I was my life would be very different right now. 

Road trip aside, I do strongly want to revisit New Orleans. Much of the story is set there, but also I'd just like to get a better feel for the city than I got that one day I spent there. (I so wish I'd stayed with the 'adults' instead of actively trying to be more social and wandering the city with 'the girls' in search of some site I could have cared less about and we didn't really find anyway. The 'adults' were going on ghost/cemetery tours. Hell 'the boys' went off to explore Bourbon Street, I probably would have had a more interesting time with them!) 

So, who wants to take a mini-vacation to the Big Easy? 

On an unrelated note, I need a good name for a fake European principality."

"event","Oh journal how I've missed you.

I need to vent, but I cannot vent on fb. I cannot vent about my brother in a public forum where he can read what I write. I cannot vent in a public forum where people who know both uf us can see just how much I sometimes want to strangle him,

It comes down to one very small yet hugely aggravating problem: his alarm clock. 

Why? Why doesn't he know the difference between snooze and off?

He has complained in the past that he has lost jobs because we have turned his alarm off. So instead we holler at him and holler at him until he does. Only, he doesn't get up he hits snooze and the whole process starts all over again. 
Now this isn't like we wait a minute, or hell five minutes for him to respond to his alarm himself. No we wait at least 10-15 before we first say something after his FIRST alarm starts to go off at 6 am. 
He has three different alarms. The phone option that I call 'pineapple music'. As much as I love pineapples, I'm no longer amused by his never ending song! It goes off for 45 seconds, is quiet for 15 and goes off again over and over and over until he responds. 
Which at 6 am, he doesn't. He responds at 6:15 or 6:30 when my calling up the stairs and mom's calling from down the hall haven't worked and she has come down the hall to 'gently yell' at him. 
Sometimes it gets us a reprieve. Usually, that reprieve is short lived. 

At 8 o'clock is when his actual house alarm starts to go off nice and quiet and builds to a deafening 'beep beeP, beEP, bEEP, BEEP, <big>BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!</big>...' 
At 8:40 this morning I couldn't take it any longer. 
My alarm was set for 9:00am, because I need to get up and eat breakfast and drink fluids before I go off to give blood. Which is before I get in a car to Mich for a four hour round trip, road trip with Tiff. It's a good thing she's driving. 

Of course, the way I feel at this moment I probably won't be allowed to give blood because of my elevated blood pressure. 

I swear, when the headlines read 'Brother slain over alarm clock dispute' and the story proceeds to tell how his sister snapped and bludgeoned him to death in his sleep with a still beeping alarm clock, and she sounds so crazy and unreasonable...please keep in mind that this has been going on for years."

"event","I cannot sleep. 
But I must not read anymore tonight. Not if I plan to function at all tomorrow.
<lj-cut text=""but I must vent, or I will never succumb to sleep, only to the ravings running through my mind"">
The school reading contest had it's annual field trip to see a movie based on a book has been the talk at work for a while. 
I knew way back in January, that they were going to see the Hunger Games when it came out. Many of the students were extra excited. As the weeks drew nearer and nearer, getting your hands on a copy of the book in our library became more and more impossible. To date, I believe the waiting list is over 20 students long. High school, only. I can't imagine how long it would be if the middle schools were included. (I assume, they have their own copies if the request is great enough)

So...last week, I was informed that the teacher above me on the list of top readers did not wish to be a chaperone this year, and that if Ms Cz had no issues with my leaving, I could join them as another adult on the scene.

Okay. Awesome. But, if possible, I like to read a book before seeing a movie, especially if it's a particularly dramatic story. I like to do this so that I can form my own picture of the characters and settings. 
So... Friday, there happens to be a copy in the library. It's clearly labeled with the next name on the waiting list. But Pat says to me that if it's not picked up by the end of the day, I could borrow it for the weekend. (I mean, it's not like I couldn't read it in that amount of time.) Liz, the head librarian, asked if I had a kobo app on my phone. She explained that if I did she could give me access to the libraries digital library, where the whole trilogy was listed. Downloading an app in the one location with free wifi in the building was a piece of cake. So I left with a library in my phone, and of course the other books I was reading at the time.

In fact, if I had borrowed that book, I probably would have read it quicker than I actually did and still be in possession of Kiss of Frost. (I'd been lent a newer series, suggested to us by one of the students. First book: Touch of Frost. It's like Percy Jackson meets The Gallagher Girls (or in my tv-addicted mind. Like Percy meets Veronica Mars).) I was compelled to finish those two books before I started the Hunger Games. Which as it happened to be was Sunday evening. More like Sunday night. I got a whole five chapters in when it was between 12 and 1 am and I realized I needed to sleep. That night, wasn't so bad. 
By Monday night, I was 5 chapters from the end of the book. I knew I was just starting to get to the climax. But it was after 1. And even though I'd foolishly consumed caffeine after dinner I knew I had to try and sleep. 
I couldn't turn off my brain. I just kept thinking that it was sitting on the end of my bed. I could turn it back and instantly be back in the story. And with it on my phone, I wouldn't even need to turn on the light to read. 

It wasn't until my alarm first went off at 5:25 that I realized I was actually resting and not a bundle of nerves. Because I'd been dreaming about the book. How it would go, what would happen next. How in the world would they get out of their predicament. Or more importantly, who would?
Tuesday morning, I was reading it on my phone while checking people in. Tuesday, during lunch, I'd tuned out and even went so far as to eat a doughnut, apple sauce and tiny bottle of juice for lunch. Because I would be too consumed to do much else. I even missed the conversation where they discussed how I would drive myself to the theater so that I could leave right after the movie and be back in the middle of 4th hour instead of 5th. 
Apparently, other people thought I was deep in conversation because I was staring so intently at my phone touching it every so many seconds to 'flip' the page. In reality, I was ignoring a conversation. I knew that the messages came in, but not able to pull myself out of the kobo app to check to see who they were from or what they were about. 

By dinner, I was finished with Hunger Games and into Catching Fire. It's a trilogy download so I don't even have to exit, I just turn the next page and there's the next part of the story. I can't even tell you when exactly I finished one and started the other. I feel great pity on those who read them as they came out and had to wait for the next installment. 
Even with refraining from caffeine, all day, I couldn't sleep that night. I made it to 5 chapters from the end...again. Or maybe four. (I don't remember clearly. I could look, but then I'd either loose my spot or get drawn back in.)
I kept trying to stop at the end of a chapter only, to realize that the endings are all teasing little cliffhangers and really stopping two pages shy of the end of the chapter would have been better. 
In my fitful sleep, I worked out what was happening in that specific scene, and then after waking and dressing I had to read a bit more to confirm it before I went to work. 

By the time we left the school for the movie, and hour in, I was twitching to read the rest, having made many ---not predictions, but more like wishes of how thing should go...or just anticipatory feelings of 'this event' is surely what is to be the outcome of all these little clues, and I can't wait until it happens for real. 

But I also really wanted to see the movie. 
As I drove to the theater, the radio djs started a conversation about the series and the movie. And the one who saw it last night simply said that she wanted more. Not that she was disappointed with what she got, but she really would have liked to have seen more development of the relationships. The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes, and she just thought they should have gone ahead and made it three. 
Then of course, they segued into the Taylor Swift song (which must play during the credits) and even though I've heard it a half a dozen times before, it resonated so much more after you read the book, or I suppose watch the movie. Because the important parts are all there, it stays very true to the heart of the story. 

And hearing the reaction of a theater full of high schoolers was kind of a reward in itself. Being able to tell those who read the book from those who hadn't. Everyone...I mean everyone, applauding the appearance of a certain heroic character. 
Although, there were many places where their reactions were terrifying as well. 
There were of course differences, but none that detracted from the story, some that were back ground stuff to help an audience follow, when we can't hear our main characters thought processes. 
The boy who played Peeta nearly killed me. From the beginning I just want to hug him. Damn him and his emotion filled expressions. 

It is now nearly midnight on Wednesday, I'm only on chapter 14, so a little more than half way through, the third installment, Mockingjay. And I find I cannot allow myself to read further. 
Not if I want my heart to work in the morning. 

As I read this third book, I feel as though I'm in the Hunger Games myself. Not the book, or the movie, but the event for which the book is named. Like reading it and the turmoil it brings up inside me is the same as the agony one would feel locked in the arena. Just when you think it can't possibly hurt more, the Capitol comes up with some new twist that crushes your spirit, rips out your heart, makes you feel the need to catch your breathe, or possibly let it out. But you can't. Because you're caught up in it now, there's no backing out. No reprieve. Not a sane one. Sure you strap yourself in for a moments rest or a nights, but you know that it will haunt your dreams, not knowing how it will go. 
Just like a participant, you think you've figured out something that the others have overlooked to be a possibility. You think way back in ch 3--oooh this is foreshadowing for THIS event to come, but when it finally does you are not prepared. You are not capable of realizing the true depths of <i>his</i> evil. You knew it was coming, but you might as well not have seen it coming at all it cuts so deep. 

And now, I find Katniss heading for a change of scenery, and because I'm as wrecked as she is I think I'll do the same. Come up for some fresh air. And praying that when I get to the end I will not be disappointed. 

Based on others' reactions I won't. But being a book about a distopian future I cannot allow myself to truly hope for a 'happy' ending. And even if I did, I'm not sure at this point what I would classify as a happy ending. All I know, is I do not envy Katniss Everdeen. Not one bit. But I do root for her. And know, that I will follow her into the flames even when I know there's a real chance I'm going to get burned.
</lj-cut>

If you haven't read <i>The Hunger Games</i> you may not be able to follow my ravings, but mostly I'm just recording my feelings to get them out of my head. I'm too tired to realize if there are spoilers in the above writings. I know there are no major ones for anyone who is at least familiar with the premise of the book, and if you're not I'm not sure you'd recognize one of my off handed comments as the spoiler it had potential to be.

So, earlier today I was hanging out in the smallest room in my house staring at a plastic bag hanging on the back of the door. I'm sure I'd read the little words on it before, but for some reason the redundancy in the warning made me contemplative today. 

""WARNING: TO AVOID DANGER OF SUFFOCATION, KEEP THIS BAG AWAY FROM BABIES AND CHILDREN.""

Because babies aren't children? Would I have decided to question the statement if it had said 'keep away from children especially babies'?  Should warnings include things like 'keep out of reach of serial killers and unstable adults.'? 

I digress. So I began wondering if other things should have comical redundant warnings on them.

ie. a teenager's blog/notebook:
WARNING: TO AVOID DANGER OF HUMILIATION, KEEP THIS JOURNAL AWAY FROM CHEERLEADERS AND POPULAR PEOPLE. 

the script of the Star Trek movie:
WARNING: TO AVOID DANGER OF PLOT-DECONSTRUCTION, KEEP THIS MOVIE AWAY FROM PHYSICISTS AND NERDS.

a Twilight novel:
WARNING: TO AVOID DANGER OF PARADOXICAL-VENERATION, KEEP THIS BOOK AWAY FROM TEENAGER GIRLS AND EXORBITANTLY HORMONAL WOMEN.

"event","Yesterday was a very long day.
Work like usual 7-3, then from 3-6:45 we were on a field trip. 
When we returned to the school it was 7pm, and the board meeting started at 7:30 sooo...we just waited. I got home around 8:30, exhausted and incapable of keeping my thoughts coherent for lengthy stories. 

Field trip: To Tandoor, Indian Restaurant in S'ville. 

We had set it all up to go at the very beginning of Dec to Taste of India, here in M'ville, but when calling to confirm our unconventional reservation we were told 'they didn't know what we were talking about' and we'd have to either come earlier or much, much later and pay double. 

So...we said 'no thank you' and called the other mostly local Indian restaurant. Told them our tale and they were very much willing to outdo their competition.
So Monday, when we called to confirm, the people we had spoken to were also not there, and there was a bit of 'that's not what we do here, and they're not here to confirm that, etc' 
Of course, this time we got the names of the individuals we spoke to. ha! 

I'll admit no matter where we went it was going to be tricky, and needed special permission, because all the local restaurants have a lunch buffet, and then close for a few hours before reopening for ala carte dinner.
School ends right in that window of time when they're closed. 
We can't leave school early for a field trip of this nature without jumping through more hoops than would be worth it. 
And to wait around and go later for students who just want to sample the cuisine and decide if they like it to pay full price for meals they know nothing about...doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun. Or the way to get them to come back to the next outing.

Keeping the buffet up and running an extra hour seemed a little ridiculous to me too, so they told us we could come at our off time and they would bring out the types of food that had been on their buffet.
It was really nice actually.
We paid a flat rate per person (except for drinks and tax) just like if it had been buffet style. Each person got a samosa to start, he explained the different types of sauces we could dip them in. 
Then he brought out naan. mmmm...naan. Both regular and garlic naan. And our main dishes and rice followed. (spelling so does not count!) chicken masala, paneer, lentils (which I somehow never got), curry yogurt (?) [I missed what it was called but it was yellow and made with curry and yogurt with potatoes in it], and of course tandoori chicken. 
At the end we got dessert too. Golabjambu or something. Looked like doughnut holes floating in a honey sauce topped with coconut. I think they were made from some kind of homemade Indian cheese. (which weirded the girls out) 

All in all, it was pretty good. I got my sweet lassi to drink, so I really can't complain. And they were all very nice to stay and wait for us and everything. 
The students who went to Arabian food night seem to be in consensus that Arabian food is better than Indian food, however. 


The board meeting was interesting, but more on that later...maybe."

"event","It's the beginning of a new year and I'm already in a foul, defriending, sort of mood. 

Not lj defriending, or even facebook defriending, a real life 'why the hell are we friends' sort of defriending mood. 

On New Years' Eve I was invited to two parties.

Knowing that one was likely to end long before the other I decided to do both. However, after getting sucked into fun game playing at the first party, when I did get to the second things were kind of dull. 

Eating was happening, and then lots of gossip. 
And me being catty. As I tend to be when around this group of people. 
There were a number of people I didn't know at this party, and so when Kristina decided to get one of her coworkers who I just met to join in on the 'don't you think they'd make a cute couple' line of talking, I was a little peeved. Not at all surprised. After all, we were sitting on the same side of the room. gasp. 

Anyway, as inappropriate I found the line of questioning and as uncomfortable as it began to get being rather interrogated. I just chalked it all up to Kristina being Kristina. 
Including the point where she said something along the lines of 'but that's not what he said'. I mean the girl say shit like that all the time. I pretty much just moved to another spot of the room to ignore her. 
And shortly thereafter the guy in question up and left the party rather abruptly. Which was weird. 
So yesterday, I get these text messages from Tiff asking about what I said that hurt his feelings. And I was like, um...idk. I said stuff, but nothing I would have suspected would have hurt so-and-so's feelings. And then she came back with a quote of something I said. And I was like, um, yeah, well it's true. It's also not news. 

But anyway, she made me feel so guilty about hurting his feelings. That I went and texted him to apologize. 
Turns out the reason he left was because of Kristina's questioning. Because it pretty much comes up every time we're together. I'm under the impression that this wasn't the first time that it came up that evening, just the first time that I was there to hear it. 

Well, I keep being told that he likes me regardless of what he says. 

Which, I would believe if he treated me differently than anyone else, or if he did any of the things that lead me to believe a guy likes me more than I like him when we're alone together. 
I'm now getting the 'he says he doesn't feel that way because he knows you don't feel that way, but really he does' from Kris and Tiff. And I'm just sick of being made to feel like I'm this horrible person leading a friend on. 
And I'm not allowed to argue my opinion on things, as I'm the only one who thinks the things that I think. 
So, in my infinitely childish wisdom, I've decided that I am not going to talk with them as long as this continues to be a topic of discussion."

<lj-cut text=""the baths"">
After getting in and showering the long days worth of travel and whatnot off it was about 00:00 when I went to bed. My cell alarm set for 05:00. 

05:00 Lourdes Time: 
Cell phone alarm beeps. I wake up exhausted. To get up or not to get up, that is the question. Pete's just snoring away. I wonder how many people are really downstairs? We had said if you couldn't make it that it was okay... hmm... maybe I'll just get two more hours of sleep and wait until my wake up call at 7 and then wander down to see where they're at. 

05:02 Lourdes Time:
Room phone rings. It's Andy (i think) calling to see if we're coming to join them. How many people are down there, I ask. 5 or 6 already. What should I wear? Whatever you're wearing now. 
Thinking that I needed to rush I threw a pink t-shirt on over my thin white tank top, paired with my Hello Kitty pj shorts, put on my house slippers, grabbed my room key and dashed on out the door. Pete was just starting to wake up then and I told him the time but not to worry about it because it sounded like they were leaving right then and there. 

I get down to the lobby, realizing I'm not even wearing my glasses. Thankfully, I'm not the only one wearing little shorts, it seems most of the girls are in some form of pjs. The group seems quite disappointed when I mention that Pete might not be coming. After maybe 5 minutes of waiting. I decide that I need a sweat shirt, and maybe some money. I hope it's dry after the rain yesterday. 

I get back up to my room and Pete is wide awake, frantically grabbing things hoping to catch the people down stairs. I snag my sweatshirt (the hood is still quite wet), my glasses, and my purse just in case we do anything afterwards before returning to the hotel. 

05:15 Lourdes Time: 
We are all gathered, all eleven of us have made it down (Andy, Mike, Steven, Pete, Kevin, Stephanie, Stacy, Kelly, Bella, Jill and I), and we head out to get in line for the baths. The men's line is non-existent (maybe 10 men), the women's line is already 30-50 people long. So we girls get in line while the boys head off to fill up water bottles and take pictures of the Grotto. After a few minutes Kelly disappears to go to the Grotto. (Andy and the boys return with our cameras and take a photo of the five of us shivering in the cold morning air) When she returns she mentions to Stacy where she'd gone, and Stacy disappears for a little while. When Stacy comes back Bella goes off....and returns with a creeper trying to not so discretely take her photo. 
Kelly has made a whole bunch of yarn rosaries and she offers a few up to those of us who want to pray while we're waiting and came unprepared. After awhile we notice an older (late forties to early sixties) woman hovering behind/beside us even though there's a line twice as long behind us. Kelly notices that she is also praying a rosary and asks her if she'd like to pray with her and teach her how to pray in the woman's language. Which turns out to be Italian. Two beads in, I join them and the three of us pray together. Kelly and I saying the first half of each Hail Mary in English, the woman finishing in Italian. After awhile we were finishing it with her. 
When we'd get to the mysteries she would recite the joyful mysteries in Italian and then we'd do the Our Father's in English. When we finished we used some broken Spanish to attempt to communicate with her when she asked how we were related, if we were there as a group, etc..
All in all it was a pretty awesome wait. And we agreed that she could join our group, incase we needed a certain number to enter with. 
As the sun rose, I began to show off the technology of my camera and captured a few tired smiles. The women in front of us lent Stacy one of their wraps, Stephanie was curled up in a ball on the ground having given up on keeping her white pants clean/dry. I wore my sweatshirt backwards for reasons that make no sense--something about the hood being wet. 
07:30 the line opens and we officially start moving forward weaving up and down rows and rows of wooden benches until the first group reaches the front. We try to follow our green (English) sheets, and attempt to get our intentions in order. 

As we get to the front of the line not even a half an hour later, I manage to stub my toe on one of the wooden benches. Without cursing I hobble over to the other two girls from our group that have been sent to section 1.  We were told that when we enter we're to make the sign of the cross, then be lowered into the water and while there to pray a Hail Mary or recite our intentions, etc. 
By a fluke of organization I end up first of our group to go into the tent. 

Inside are a number of women holding giant navy blue fitted sheets, as a new girl comes in she's directed to a chair and hook and asked to strip while one of these women shields her with the blue sheet. When finished she's wrapped in the sheet and put in a line heading through another tented area where the actual baths are located. 
When it's my turn, I'm so nervous I practically forget what to do. The woman who comes to get me asks me what language I speak. And then in English she directs me to come in and she takes my blue sheet while another woman wraps a <i>cold</i> wet towel around me. 
---now when I say cold, imagine she just pulled this towel out of an underground river, because that's pretty much how it happened.--
Once that towel hit me I couldn't breathe and I literally forgot everything I was to do. I got a stern look before remembering to do the Sign of the Cross. Then two other woman who only spoke French grabbed each of my arms and directed me down the stairs further into the freezing cold water. There was a little statue of Mary at the opposite end of the tub that I was to kneel before, or kiss, or touch or pray to...I'm not really sure what she said but for whatever reason I thought she told me to kiss Mary... so I did. and then the took me by the shoulders and bend me backwards so that I'd go under the water more. I knew that they didn't dunk your head, because no one else had come out with wet hair, but I still panicked wondering how far they would dunk me if I just let them. 

And then it was over, I had completely forgotten everything I was going to pray for while in that water. And I was back up wrapped in my blue sheet and back in the room with the other 8 girls and my clothes. No towels to dry off with just get back dressed. Which since the water was so cold, dried fairly quickly. (I think by the time we gathered each of us said that only our underwear was still a little wet ). Because of it's coldness, not only did I almost forget that I came in with shoes, but I was instructed to put my sweatshirt on over my t-shirt before I left. She insisted so I did, I didn't even think why. 
As I left the baths, I found that all but two boys were done and a number of the girls who were behind me had made it through already as well in their lines. 
So timing worked out perfectly, giving us enough time to head back to the hotel for breakfast as well as being able to change clothes before International Mass in the Grotto.</lj-cut>

Breakfast was a baguette, a croisant, jelly packets and sugar for with our coffee/tea. We could also get orange juice, milk and cereal, as additions. So in France, a good breakfast = a lot of carbs to help you make it up and down the hills. 

We had exactly one hour before we were to gather in the lobby to attend the <lj-cut text=""International Mass in the Grotto"">International Mass in the Grotto. 

Our very own Bishop Melczek was to conduct the parts of Mass, so we were all really looking forward to it. As we gathered in the lobby and followed the 'Y man' sign out to the river along the Grotto, we took a few photos of the morning sunlight hitting the front of the Basilica. 
We'd been discussing the idea of wading across this rather wide, rapid moving river as St Bernadette had done a hundred and fifty years ago. So while standing at the river we were looking down at it and trying to gauge how deep it was based on the plants we could see. We spotted a fish, some cool flowers, and other such wonders while waiting. 

Then we ended up splitting into our groups as we headed forward to find spots for mass. This mass was the first time Kevin's stuffed bull made an appearance. He decided earlier in the week that we needed a mascot, and since we were going to Spain that it should be a bull. So he went online, found a pattern and created this bull in two days--complete with little t-shirt that said USA on the sides and WYD '11 on the top. As of this time, the bull did not have a name. Also, Kevin had a full-sized American flag that he was hoping to find a cheap pole to hoist it from, that he wore around his shoulders for a bit. 

10:00 Lourdes Time

Mass was really neat. There was a choir of French singers who led us in song. Many of which were in Latin, though they had interesting arrangements. Bishop recited opening prayers in English and the readings were read in four different languages. The psalm was in French, but it was simple enough that we could repeat it. Anyone who had their Magnificats with them could follow along in English. When the Homily came a very talented Priest got up and gave us this intricate four part homily in four languages. I think he could have done six, but at the beginning he asked 'Where are my English speakers,"" French, Spanish, Italian, German, and one other but I forget which. And once he'd gauged who the biggest groups were he spoke each section of the homily in each language. First in English, then in Spanish, then in French and finishing up in Italian. 
There were four things we were to remember, and sadly now I cannot be sure what they were. I hope I wrote them in my journal. 

Communion was interesting, the priests spread out with little white umbrellas so that people could find them and then we swarmed around them. Our priest would not let you take it with the wrong hand and watched very carefully that you put it in your mouth (not that Eucharistic Ministers aren't supposed to, but when you don't speak the same language and he's very serious about it, it's almost funny to watch when someone is doing it wrong). 
After, Bishop M did the closing prayer and all the 'World Youth Day youths' were invited to come up afterwards and touch the walls of the Grotto. 
It was interesting trying to get into the area when all the older people were gathering at the gates, plus you had to have some kind of sticker to get in, and we didn't have them to begin with. But they weren't hard to get if you could show that you were there for WYD (better known as JMJ in these areas) 

When everything was over we headed back to eat lunch in our hotel.</lj-cut>

12:00 Lourdes Time: Lunch
We arrived fairly early to lunch, so we had to wait a bit for them to be ready to serve us. 
Our first course was Tomato Salad (diced tomatoes in the middle of the plate, with cut red and green peppers at the top surrounded on either side with corn.) 
There was summer sausage like meat, and cheese and crackers to go with it. As well as rolls. 
Our second course was mushroom and cheese crepes with a green salad with vinegar and oil for dressing
Our third was cooked sausages and carrots chips.
For dessert we each had a peach. 

While eating this day we had interesting conversations about amount of things permitted in processed foods back home. Kevin had ended up sitting to my right, Stacy across from me (who I shared a sausage with), and Bella to my left, with Mike across from her. I think Gill joined us... 
At one point Kevin reached across my plate to get something, extra food, the salt, i don't remember. But he commented 'Excuse my reach' after he'd already had his hands on whatever he was going for. I didn't really care as I was done with whichever course that was and was even turned towards Bella at that moment, but I made sure to rib him about it later.

13:30 Lourdes Time: Gather for Walking Tour of Lourdes. 

<lj-cut text=""The Tour"">
14:00 Lourdes Time, we met up with a woman holding a sign that read 'English-Speaking Tour' at the statue of Mary across from the Basilica. We waited nearly a half an hour for the tour to start. More, because I think Driscoll had gathered us prematurely. 
During this time we attempted to give the bull a name. I had many and at times even changed genders. By the time the tour started it had beed declared by someone--possibly Bella--that his name was Timmy. Timmy Torro. (the guys in the other group tried to give him the middle name of Benjamin, but that was vetoed) 

14:40ish we begin our tour with a larger crowd than anticipated. The people with the Philipino flag were an interesting addition. Our tour guide, whose name I do not recall, lead us up to a non-descript building. It kind of looked like a parking garage, honestly. Inside however it was a huge church. Designed like and upside down boat, because of Jesus' connection with fishermen. I believe it may have been the location of the first church that Bernadette established in the area. An underground kind of bunker, that has withstood many years. 

Passing through we came out the other side, and still couldn't believe what was hiding under that mountain. 
Next she led us to Museum of St Bernadette. And the line to get in was so ridiculously long, and we had a candlelight vigil to attend later than night that Driscoll made an executive decision. 
Anyone who wanted to could continue on with the tour, or we could use the tour map and try to go it our own... It came down to three choices. Joe's group would head to the Chapel of Notre Dame and see where she was enturned, Shannon's group was heading to get water/go to the baths and then to meet up with Joe's.  Andy's group (us) decided that we would attempt to give ourselves a self-tour using the map. And I believe Driscoll headed back towards the hotel/or also to the baths. 

Our group of eleven became thirteen with the addition of Emily and her mom Kim.

Using Kevin's map-reading skilz, we let him take us on a tour. We get to the original family home that was an old mill and has been turned into a little museum that costs 5 euros to enter, we take photos from the outside and continue on to the next stop. The Cachot, the former jail that her family lived in after they lost the mill. This little building had lots of little things like shoes they made out of wood from the trees to save money, and a giant key, and just some basics that showed how little they would have had living there. 
After it took 20 minutes to get through, because people in wheelchairs with groups of 30 attached and another group with a tour cut in front of us, we headed off to the next spot on the map. After a while we realized we were following a pale blue line in the road. Map consulting became more of a confirmation of which location we were heading towards than an actual guide. Although, when Steven, Andy, and Stephanie started following the white line into the middle of the road and not the blue line along the sidewalk, we became a little worried about their ability to tell colors. 

There was a side stop in this awesome toy store. Everything inside was made out of wood and had intricate parts to put together. Great educational tools. Unfortunately wood weighs a lot and we still have a lot of trip left. There was a game with mice and cats and I want it. If it hadn't been a 1.5 square feet in size I probably would have purchased it. 

We made it to another little church in the area, one where her crypt had been. If I remember the name I'll update this part. It was really pretty inside and we took a group picture of our feet around something in the sidewalk outside. 
As we wandered down to the next stop we lost half of our group inside a chocolate shop. 
....
....
I was not part of that group. I know Kevin and I were both rather upset that we didn't get chocolate, I believe the others with us were also sad that when we'd stopped because we no longer saw them behind us we didn't know they were getting treats. We probably would have gone back. 
The last stop on the blue line we made it to was just a site. The site of the place where her first convent was built. It was destroyed in 1922, and in it's place is a park with a sign and bronze statue. We paused to take a photo. 

From there we decided that instead of following the rest of the tour line we wanted to go to the Castle. 
So we trekked back up the hills we'd just come down, past that chocolate shop again to the entrance of the Castle Fort. 
This also had an entrance fee, but we got free range of an entire european castle, complete with random collections of things from around the long time periods the castle was in use. From clothing, to farming equipment, there was a section for everything. There was even most of a complete wedding china set. I think we found the matching pieces further in with the regular pottery display. 
We ran up some stairs under the portcullis, peered out of the tower windows, pretended to fire arrows on our enemies, observed the toilets that were just holes in the upper levels that lead to a drop over a hill, and took lots of photos all on the way to the top of the castle where we took panoramics of the city, and returned to climb up to the top of the tallest tower along the winding stone staircases of doom. 
Think spiral staircase, but made entirely of stone, and spiraling inside a square. Certain steps were very thin at on end and on the way down, people expected us to step on these thinner, yet smoothly worn stone steps without falling. Each landing seemed to have another jail. The higher up we got the less worn the stairs and the smaller the cells. 

After the self-guide tour of the castle was complete we dashed back to our hotel for dinner. 
</lj-cut>

18:00 Lourdes Time: Dinner.

Again we were early for dinner. In fact this time I think we were early enough they didn't have rolls out. After dinner the Seton group was doing a Skype conference so Kevin had gone up to get his laptop. 
The rest of us took spots around one of our tables. Jill and I went off in hopes of reading the menu for that evening. Our options were French, German, Spanish, Italian, or...Spanish. The sixth spot was empty. 

As they finished setting our tables we took seats. Kevin somehow ended up next to me again. Which I suppose was good for him because I kept putting food on his plates as he messed with his computer. 
At one point we realized that the food we couldn't quite translate was veal. And so we kept joking that we were eating Timmy Torro's babies. Or as we called them Tiny Timmy Torro's, and they blessed us each and every one. Mostly, I think it was Bella's reaction to our horrible humor that kept the bad jokes coming. 
Let's see what I can remember--Our first course was some kind of soup, I think. Like vegetables in chicken broth. Our second course was lasagna, our third was the veal with peas and carrots (for which Timmy posed with a tear rolling down his cheek), and for dessert we had our choice of ice cream. Either pistachio or nata with chocolate cream. The pistachio was delicious, the other tasted like birthday cake ice cream (like if you went to cold stone). 

There was about an hour between dinner and the time to gather for the candlelight vigil. Since I wasn't Skyping, I went upstairs to change my shoes....and Pete and I ran to get our water bottles filled since I hadn't brought them earlier. On the way back we had about a half an hour to spare so we shopped in the stores that we'd looked at the night before. Luckily, I remembered which one I thought had some pretty good deals, and a nice selection for what we were looking for. 
After picking out a nice cross for Ma, a cross and chain each for Pete and I, and a rose rosary, I took the water up to the hotel to grab our candles (and pee) while Pete paid. When he made it back we had less than two minutes before the group was to be leaving for the vigil site.  

19:30-20:00 Lourdes Time
<lj-cut text=""The Candlelight Vigil"">
We gathered in our hotel lobby with what was left of our candles after the vigil the night before, and headed out to a site uphill from our hotel. Not too far from the castle we'd explored earlier. Le Village des Juenes is what it was called. They were these huge open grounds with areas filled with tents and other such things that reminded me of summer camp.  We followed other pilgrims inside to a spot where we seemed to all be stopping. 
After sitting for awhile, someone in the high school group decided that we should all 'sizzle'. 
? What is a 'sizzle' you might ask? It's a goofy dance made up that they all learned two weekends before at CYX. It's sole purpose is to get people up and moving and having fun, there is no connection with our religion involved at all. So when we were learning it I kind of felt like it was pointless, but consented that if I'd still been in HS, I would have been all over it. Bishop Melczek seemed quite into it. He also learned it the weekend before. 

After we sizzled, someone came around with giant torches/candles and four of our pilgrims got to carry them. And the rest of us shortly realized that we had new papers being passed out to cover our candles with. This time they were yellow, and for this particular procession. 

As we lit our candles, the four with the torches were pulled up to the front to surround the statue of Mary (as it was a celebration of one of her Feast days), and the rest of us fell in line with the other groups. Though we got a little separated from time to time. And when we were asked to sing in English, no more than two of us knew the same song. Until I jokingly said 'This Little Light of Mine' and off we went singing as many verses as we could remember/make up. Which turned out to be about four. 

Then we made our way back to the other group, who were all trying to get a song going and failing when no one knew the verses...or maybe only one person did. Then we were singing more pop-Christian music, and eventually there was a group behind us that was singing songs in multiple languages. We'd join in on the Ave Maria's. 
After what felt like an hour of walking we had made it back around the city to the Basilica, and we'd gathered with thousands of other people. On the stage they were praying a rosary. And each Hail Mary was done in a different language, followed by an Ave Maria in that language. When they reached the next mystery and we heard that it was only the third, we all inwardly groaned. Each mystery was also said in more than one language. 
This vigil went on. And on. And on. And finally about 23:30 we had reached the end of the vigil. Numerous lanterns had gone up in flames around us, all of our candles were either extinguished or ridiculously tiny nubs. And we got run over by people pulling rickshaws that had been in front of us and were now wanting to move faster than we were. 
I tell you, if you want to be able to just push past people and get to the front of a crowd quickly in Europe, this is the way you do it. Because even if you're all going in the same direction, people on wheels automatically get to push you out of the way. (Also, for future reference only Americans and Germans form lines, everyone else just goes where they want when they want).

If it hadn't been sooooooo long I think I would have found it to be incredible. It was pretty incredible anyway, but after an hour of walking and an hour of standing still without trying to catch your lantern on fire (which includes no squatting) all you can think about is how much your feet hurt, how much your back hurts, how they're only on the fourth mystery! 

The four in the procession beat us back to the hotel, Kevin took these really amazing pictures from the front, where you can just see the thousands of lit candles. And every candle was raised on the Ave, Ave, Ave Maria's (which were sometimes in languages you didn't understand at all. So it was fun to watch how certain times these people over here knew to raise their candles but others didn't and slowly it would ripple out until eventually the front row had joined in too.)  but I don't think we did anything else that night other than head up to bed. Maybe ten minutes of talking to discuss the next morning. 

My ankles were so sore. I got back to the hotel and showered and sure enough it was nearing 01:00 when I went to bed, and my alarm was again set for 05:00. 
We had mass at 06:00, but all of our luggage had to be packed and down stairs before hand, and we had to have time to travel to the chapel."

<lj-cut> 
12:00 Chicago Time--head off to Our Lady of Sorrows to meet the bus to the airport. 

13:00 Chicago Time--We gather in group and Bishop Melczek leads us in prayer for safe journey.  Load the bus. Texting and  Facebook updating the entire trip that I don't realize how quickly we arrive at O'Hare. 

15:00 (ish) Chicago Time--Arrive at O'Hare, wait in line to check luggage at O'Hare, wait in line to go through security, wait after security for the other 30 people to join you in a group at the gate. 

16:45 Board plane to Paris, France. 

(in flight time) in no particular order. listen to in-flight radio, attempt to play games only to end up locking up the screen, watch <i>Water for Elephants</i>, nap, get fingernails dug into arm by scared Pete wondering if the plane movements are normal. (sadly, these were less than the movements on the bus). 
</lj-cut>
Saturday, August 13, 2011:
<lj-cut>
07:54 Paris Time (00:54 ChiTime)--Arrive at Charles De Gaulle airport, short wait through customs then board the tram to our terminal. Short trip through security (where I speak with a convincing enough accent that the TSA person starts going off in French asking me if I've got a computer in my bag) and then up the stairs for a four hour layover. 

Shopping, lunch, mailing post card from Paris, witnessing underage smoking... just a typical day in a European airport full of American teens. 

12:15 Paris Time--board plane for Pau, France. We travel through a series of tunnels to an outside checkpoint. Walk through the drizzle to our small plane. Thankfully, we're all spread out through the cabin and I'm not sitting next to Pete while he discovers that the size of the plane makes a huge difference in the amount of turbulence you feel. (also, he'd been thinking that bigger planes are scarier than smaller planes--perhaps he was unsure of how the bigger ones would stay up as long, idk)
Flight lasts about an hour-hour and half. 
Land get our luggage and meet up with our guide. Board our bus and head off to Lourdes, France. 

Somehow I managed to get a seat to myself, therefore, I fall asleep using my carryon bag as a pillow. 
not quite an hour later we arrive at our hotel in Lourdes--The Arcadia. 
It's on the same side of the river as the Basilica, just up a hill from a street leading right to the front gates. We drop our bags off, have about 45 minutes to freshen up, and then we're down to the base of the hill (elevator is optional, or there's a ramp) and down across the river to a small chapel for a private mass. 

Bishop Melczek and Father John come to realize that they cannot find a English translation of readings and psalms in the tiny chapel. Thankfully, Kevin Driscoll has 3G and he pulls up the day's readings on his phone. The rest of the mass Bishop does from memory. It is asked if there are any music people in the house that can help sing some Marian songs.

Pete tries to get me to raise my hand. But honestly, I'm drawing blanks on all kinds of possible songs. I only know the two he'd already mentioned that we'd be singing as opening and closing hymns. So I keep my hand down and we do mass without much music. 

Wishing I could have had a little more confidence during the presentation of gifts or communion...and the singing parts of the Mass are more chants than song. I vow to offer up my abilities if we should be in this situation again. 

Part way through mass another person wanders in to join us. The more the merrier. 

Afterwards we walk back for dinner at our hotel. Passing the long lines for the Baths. (somehow we got separated and a small group of us got lost on the way back). Kelly, Kevin, Mike and I were walking in a group near the front of the pack when it started to pour. We watched all the natives take shelter under the awnings while we crazy Americans kept <i>walking</i> through the rain. We did take the elevator up though and dash across the street. 
Wet or not we headed into the restaurant. 

18:00 Lourdes Time
Dinner has been provided for us. Placed at each table setting are two large plates and a large bowl, knife, fork, spoon and dessert fork. Water glasses and bread. 
Eight places per each of the larger tables. This first night, I ended up sitting with a number of pilgrims from St. Elizabeth Seton.
Kelly and I were at the head of the table so we dished up the soup when it came and passed bowls down. The soup was delicious. I thought it was like butternut squash, but turns out it was carrot. Either way, yum. 
After we'd all had second helpings, the bowls were cleared away and a second course came out. 
This second course was a pinkish meat covered in yellow sauce. After passing out slices to each person, the first of us took a bite and announced that the food was cold, slimy, and well just gross. 
It was like a combination between Spam and salami, and the sauce was largely mustard with dill and other spices added. And looked like puke. It didn't smell that great either, but Kelly and I forced ourselves to clean our plates to prove that we could. Mike and Kevin at the opposite end of the table had polished theirs off very quickly--as well being boys and very hungry, and not sure what would come next, they ate what they could. The other four either took somewhere between 0-2 bites of their food before giving up. 
Those plates were cleared away and the third course came out. Thin sliced roast beef and green beans. Warmed to perfection. For dessert we had apple pie. 

After dinner we had about twenty minutes to freshen up again and then we were going to proceed down near the Grotto doing our own candlelight procession, as there was a concert going on that night so the usual candlelight procession had been cancelled for the day. We prayed a rosary as a group, girls doing the first half of a prayer boys doing the second all the way down the ramp and then ended the evening along the river near the Grotto (not too close as not to disrupt others who were praying). 

The two main church groups split up to talk about what they were going to do the next day. Having eaten with the Seton group, I was quite attached. (Pete had eaten with the other and said that they were largely HSers and he'd also prefer to join the older kids). So Pete and I jumped into their conversation about getting up early to go to the Baths. It was agreed that we would wake at 5am to go get in line for the Baths that open at 7:30am. 

21:30ish Those who were really tired headed back to the hotel. The rest of us about 8 in total wandered the shops and up the hill to other parts of the town to experience Lourdes. When Bella was sleep walking and nearly got hit by a bus we decided it was finally time to head back to our hotel. Thankfully, Kevin (not Driscoll) and I have pretty good senses of direction and we ended up at our hotel without back tracking through the streets. <small>Admittedly, Kevin's direction is better than mine during most of this trip</small>"

"event","I'm back home, I've been so busy I haven't had time to journal beyond putting up bulletin points of daily events. Give me a few days to sort it all out and I'll begin to recap the highlights. 

For now, I will leave you with this:

8  Things that I've done on this trip that I normally wouldn't do:
1. Drank out of someone else's water bottle.  (though I was extremely thirsty at the time)
2. Let Peter drink out of my water bottle. (though I watched him like a hawk, and he seemed to by dying of thirst)

3. Allowed and even participated in double dipping churros in chocolate with two other people. 
4. Accepted a piece of chewing gum (twice).
5. Drank an entire bottle of water that I knew I had been the second owner of.
6. Shared store bought water bottles with a number of people, without watching to see how they were drinking it.
7. Offered said bottle up to people to share.
8. Asked for a piece of gum.

Now I know these seem like things anyone would do, but if you know me, you realize how huge that is."

"event","Day and a half and counting.

As most of you know by now, I am leaving on a jet plane to the wonderful continent of Europe. As you should also know by now, I love postcards. I send them to myself and anyone else who wants one. 

I do not however like writing things to myself on postcards. 

In places like Madrid, I'll likely have the opportunity to find people to write on my postcards for me, but in Paris (where I'll only have a couple hour layover and need to find postcards, stamps, and the post box) I doubt I'll have much time. So, I'm requesting things to write on my postcards.

I'll (hopefully) be mailing them from: 
Paris, France
Lourdes, France
Zaragoza, Spain (this one would likely be the trickiest)
Madrid, Spain
Avila, Spain (maybe)
Barcelona, Spain (hopefully, I'll have made enough friends by this point to find someone willing to write something for me at the hotel.)

Your suggestions do not have to be in English. 

P.S. Does anyone want one from any of the cities/countries above?"

....
That was dumb. 

Travel dates are quickly approaching. There are a few things I still need. Including a secure bag to keep my stuff in. I picked one out online a while back. 
Yesterday was the first time it was on sale, plus I had a 30% off coupon, and a $10 off coupon, and...including the moisture wicking, thin summer socks I was ordering should have put me up over that magic number for free shipping. 

....idiot that I am, closed the window before retrieving my credit card and coupons and actually checking out. 
30% off expired yesterday, as did the sale.  
C'est la vie. 

So, it's not on sale, though the sale was only like 10% off. Being the store of a thousand sales I have a pick-a-day coupon for 15% off, so I decided to order it today anyway. I want it to arrive before I leave! 
I just finished checking out and went to check my email for confirmation when I noticed in my email earlier today I received and email for 20% off for this weekend only (including today online!). 

Lesson learned, when dealing with the store of a thousand sales check your email for new coupons BEFORE hitting checkout. 

Oh well. 

----
My other stupid move of the summer has been to begin to read a pair of books that I should have put off for my trip. 

I can't not take a book with me. That's just absurd. These books are not only light reading, they're lightweight and small in size. So perfect for packing into my purse let alone a carry-on. 

I finished the first of two and started the second and I know that I won't be able to just stop reading it for three weeks. Also, I'm far enough in that it would only last me the flight there. 

So now I need to find something else to take with me. I could splurge and buy one of the sexy new Nooks and take a bunch of books with me, but then there's one more electronic device for me to worry about. 
So, I'm looking for something fun, inexpensive, and mass-market paperback size to take with me to France and Spain.  Suggestions? (all the rest of my to-read stack is either hard cover, or trade paperback, or...Psych media-tie-ins)"

"event","I recently purchased and finished reading the newest <i>Chicagoland Vampires</i> series by Chloe Neill.
I loved it, I hate that the next one doesn't come out to November. I'm grateful it's only November and not next spring. 
I need to vent/rant/squee about certain plot developments, but I don't want to spoil anyone who might one day read them. 
Basically, what I need is someone who wants to read them and converse with me. 

Bookish Graduate student, Merit, gets attacked on campus one night. (and she's not the first) Bitten and bleeding out she is 'saved' by Master Vampire of one of Chicago's three Houses. 
Not thrilled about being turned (without consent, no less) Merit must figure out where she stands and what she wants to do with her new found immortality. Her first choice of returning to school is taken from her when he new status is publicized in the press. So plan b, solve her 'murder' and that of three other girls who weren't so lucky. 

So there's vampires, there's mystery, there's magic, and romance. Also, as an added bonus, Chloe writes for people with a well-developed vocabulary. They pace is great and you'll likely fly through, if not devour, any of the books. Each book builds on the last as we follow Merit through her first year of being a vampire. There are long running plots, as well as episodic mysteries to solve in each novel, and brilliant world building. 

The first is titled, <i>Some Girls Bite</i>, check it out at your local library, pick it up at a bookstore near you, or come borrow mine off my shelf.  I will warn you, if you like the first book, be prepared to become emotionally attached to these characters. 

I enjoyed the first three so much I finished the third and turned around and restarted the first one before my two weeks at the library were up. (Now that i'm done with four, I think I'll have to go back and reread one--but don't worry, I'll still share. ;) )"

"event","So those of you who follow me on facebook already know, I got a summer job!

Which is good because money, and blah because summer school starts the monday after next, you know less than a week from the end of the school year. *stupid snow days* And I'm pretty sure the last day is the day before my birthday. 

Which will give me two weeks of relaxation before my pilgrimage to Spain. I have already requested off for those first four days of next school year...because my trip and the start of the year overlap.  Everyone was asking me if I got grief over asking for time off, but surprisingly no. I was told that normally she doesn't let people put in for time off this early, but based on my situation there's not much else I can do. MsCz is totally okay with my not being there those first four days. 

Pete just asked me today to teach him Spanish... 
...
...

not even sure where to start with that. 


So in more recent news I have a date Friday. 

Tiff told me that I'm not allowed to date boys I meet on the internet. ...but where am I supposed to meet these boys otherwise? At work? At yoga? In bars?

Anyway, it's not like I date every guy who asks me or even talks to me on the 'net. I've been talking with Stephen for over a month, and when I actually looked forward to his responses and what not was when I decided to start IM-ing him. And now we're up to texting. 
Small world. So it turns out he went to school with my cousin in Boone Grove. He lives in Valpo and regardless of if we ever become more than friends or not, I can already tell he'd fit right in to the group. Hell I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he already knew members of the group. 
Anyway, my options for Friday were meet up in Valpo or I could meet him up in Chicago. He works up in Chicago and he's leaving for NYC Saturday, so it would make sense to meet him, but for a first time face to face I'd like it a little more local. Also, turns out I'm proctoring the SAT this saturday morning (which means I need to cancel my chiro appt) and thus will want to be home and asleep early. 
I hope I sleep better before giving the damned thing than I did when I had to take it.

Anyway, I feel like there's more news, but I cannot think of what any of it is at this moment."

"event","So you remember that massage that I almost wasn't allowed to take?

I signed up for a free one-hour massage because of it and went last week after sitting all day at the ballpark. Which grew into my getting a consultation for the chiropractic services also given at this location. I've always been a fan of holistic medicine, and I almost always have some horrible pain or stiffness in my back (that I'd learned to live with for so long that I usually don't even notice it), and of course my issues with my lungs. Well anyway, after my massage and my first alignment I was hooked. 

In other news, I started doing yoga with Tiff. It's a 'booty yoga' class that's designed to help tighten and tone the muscles in your abs and glutes, based on holding poses for what feels like a ridiculously long amount of time.  
Well this week we're thinking about hitting the kickboxing class instead/first. Either way that should be interesting. 

Now, if I can find a part-time summer job to help me afford my new 'healthy' lifestyle, that'd be awesome.

"event","I think for the first time in my life other people's politics are actually stressing me out. I usually don't allow politics to have a huge effect on me. Whether they were personal inner-office politics or actual government changing things. 

But then again, I guess I've never been in a position where state politics will directly effect my life. Negatively. And on a big scale. 

Anyone who has been paying attention in the past few years will know that my state's governor and superintendant of schools have interesting ideas on what is best for education. From changing how a school day is calculated and how long a school year is all the way up to basic funding. 

There are so many new bills about education in the works and so many of them are just horrible ideas, horribly worded, or full of extra little annoyances that have nothing to do with the main issue being voted on. 
Why aren't bills like paragraphs? If the sentence doesn't apply directly to your topic sentence it gets cut out. So then why not make smaller, concise bills that only talk about whatever issue you actually want to effect. People would vote yay or nay on specific issues and you'd know where everyone stood. Sure there would be more bills on the table, but I think things that actually needed changing would happen faster if they just dealt with one issue at a time. 
They're like run-ons.

And that is what you call a tangent. Anyway, besides all the actual politics that are putting people I work with on edge. There's the massive amounts of testing!!
It's amazing how many tests MsCz is responsible for and being at two different buildings and in some cases having to give out three entirely different tests. Actually it's worse than that.
<lj-cut text=""the short of how ISTEP works here"">
Take the ISTEP for starters. Everyone has to take it. Everyone who wants to graduate from HS has to pass it. This is not new. 
But between when I graduated and when I started working here they changed the name of the test, added a science portion, and altered the number of times the test had to be taken. The students take this huge test in sections over three days--just like the little guys--and when they passed one section they'd be done with it for the rest of their time at the school. But I guess because of the trimester scheduling it became apparent that students were just plain forgetting things between when they took the class and when the actual tests were given in the spring. For example you could have math first trimester, but not second and then at the beginning of third when you're expected to take the test you've completely forgotten the terms you haven't used <i>at all</i> in months. So three years ago, they (whoever they is) split the testing into sections to be given over the course of the students schooling. At the end of specific courses they take the section of the test that was covered. And then there are more stipulations added if you don't pass it the first time and how you go about taking it again. </lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""the crazy schedule"">
So. Just before Christmas MsCz had to give the English section of the End of Course Assessment to the juniors who hadn't passed as sophomores (and were not currently enrolled in the sophomore level class). Just after break (like JUST) we started giving our ESL test--of which there's a HS test, a 6-8th grade test and a 4&5 grade test. So even without the middle schoolers we still had to give three separate tests. And at the HS level that's just too many students in a room at one time so we split it into two groups as well. Add in some snow days.
Which push back 2nd trimester finals to coinicide with ISTEP at the lower levels. Oh, but also, right before finals we give the ECA, and this time around she had to give it to all of our sophomores in the correct section of sophomore English, as well as the math portion to all the students just finishing Algebra. (we lucked out in the Biology section this time around). But that was two weeks long. ISTEP/Finals were this week. In fact Finals are happening as I type--just not in here. 

And next week the seniors who didn't finish a section of that other form of ISTEP that hasn't completely been phased out yet will meet. Which means I need to be able to do something else with the class. Oh wait, Acuity starts up again at the intermediate school next week. 

....and more ISTEP in what four, maybe five weeks. 

Then it'll be over. Until finals, and maybe another round of Acuity...and we get to start it all over again next fall. </lj-cut>

So. Today, only 3rd, 4th, and 5th hours are meeting for finals (1st & 2nd were yesterday) and because of it being the end of ISTEP the 5th & 6th graders are to be have movie time this afternoon. So in theory, I could have taken a sick day and no one would have needed to fill in, but I figured if I stayed home what would I do? sleep? 
When I sleep the day away it just makes me feel miserable for wasting so much time. 

Whatever. Finals are offically graded. This afternoon should be cake. Now it's time for lunch, and to interact with other human beings...hopefully."

"event","Spirit Week is in a few weeks and they announced what our daily themes will be already. 
Tuesday is 'Totally 80's' day. 
Wednesday is 'Ugly Sweater' day 
and Thursday is 'Cowboys and Indians' day.
(Monday is Presidents' Day and Friday is as usual Spirit Day aka Purple & White day)

So... Wednesday is easy, I'll wear my Miyu sweater.  You know, the one that looks like the Easter Bunny took a ride on the Tilt'a'whirl and someone pulled it out of the bin afterwards. Thursday... um, yeah. I'll be sure to wear jeans that day--but beyond that I don't really have anything. 

Now. Tuesday. 
I have a pair of acid washed, neon pink paint spattered tappered-leg jeans. 
I have a whole basket of slouch socks--if the elastic is still good in a few pairs, I'll wear them with some hightops from the back of my closet (provided the neon ones are still there) or just my chucks. If they don't work I suppose I could always wear some heels (though I don't own pointy-toed ones--and my feet are bigger than my sister's). 

But what should I wear on top? 

I don't think I have any bright neon shirts anymore. Definitely not ones long enough to tie off to the side or short enough to layer over a tank in that oh so 80's everything is three sizes too big way. 
I've got a line on ill fitted 80's style sweaters for less than ten dollars. But neither are brightly colored. 

I do have an ill-fitting teal and white striped johnny-collar sweater, if I had a bright colored polo to wear under it I'd just pop the collars. 

(oh, as for accessories. I have a whole bunch of plastic bangles, slap bracelets, and giant rainbow heart earrings.  I just need to locate a scrunchy and clean off the crimping attachment to flat iron I inherited. --this is what happens when you don't throw things away so much as put them in bins of alike items.)

So the question I post to you is...

Do I track down a bright polo (Tiff may have one I can borrow) and layer it under the sweater I already own?

Find a loose fitting sweater/sweatshirt and wear it over a bright purple (not neon, just colorful) tank top?

Or some other suggestions I just haven't thought of, but might possibly own?


Also...should I attempt to do my makeup all 80's style too or just leave it at the clothes?"

"event","So. One day last month Steve decided that we'd come straight home after bowling. And we got out kind of early on top of that. 
There was about 10-15 minutes left before 5 when we got home and turned on the TV. Since it was just me and Steve and there was a show about horses ending, I left it on that while I scanned through the guide to see what was coming on later. 

Well, those last 10-15 minutes were kind of awesome, so when I was in the library and saw Season 1, part 1 on dvd, I snatched it up. 

The weekend before last I cornered Dick and Steve and didn't tell them what I was putting on and popped the first disc in. They liked it so much that even though they ran out of time to watch all seven episodes before it was due back they asked if I would check it out again next time I was in. 

So hearing that there was a blizzard coming to town I popped into the library after school on Monday and picked up <i>Heartland</i> S1,p1 again, along with series 1 & 2 of BBC's <i>being human</i>. 

Now, since I'd actually seen all 7 eps, I kind of wanted to find more. And CBC is airing season 4 at the moment so I knew there was more. 
I found uploads on youtube, and I'm somewhere in season 2 at the moment. The girl who's uploads I'm currently viewing sometimes leaves in the commercials at the end between the credits and previews. The last few have  been for a show called <i>Little Mosque on the Prairie</i> and all I can think when I see the ads are 'Oh, Canada' in more of an amused way than anything else. 
<small>
Random Heartland trivia--
Jessica Steen (who plays everyone's favorite female constable) was the original Dr. Elizabeth Weir on SGA (in the movie-pilot) and is playing Lisa Stillman a reoccurring character, who's sort of like extended family--as so many of them are. 
And 
Michelle Morgan played Dr. Weir in her last two appearances on SGA--in Ghost In the Machine and well...as F.R.A.N. . Michelle plays one of the main characters on the show, Lou Flemming. 
I just find it it adorable that the first two hours of Dr. Weir's existence and the last two were played by women who ended up working together on the same show. </small>

Add to all this the timing of <lj user=ifreet>'s Headstones trip and all the winter that's going on outside and I'm just feeling all kinds of love for Canada these days."

"event","Snow Days:

When I was a kid I loved snow days. No school, snow ball fights (though most of the ones I remember ended in someone going inside crying--not that he'd admit it today), a snow man or two (even a baby one we brought in and kept in the freezer until summer.) 

In 1998--that March storm was horrible. But it wasn't so much the snowfall (according to internet records there were only about 6.5 inches of snowfall--of course that's for Chicago) as the freezing rain the night before that assisted in the downing of power lines. We had no power for 5 days, had to abandon the house and go stay somewhere else half way through. I did learn a few things that week--Kim, my best friend at the time who was living with us, punches in her sleep, tropical gold fish cannot survive on their own for two days w/o power or someone to feed warm water into the system despite what my mother told me, and the lower level remained a solid ten degrees colder than the upper level at all times. 

We didn't do much playing outside, seeing as how coming inside was not going to make us warmer. 

Now in 2010 we had a day out in December. Just one to give us a three day weekend right before our very late starting break. We all LOVED that snow day. It wasn't so bad that everything else was closed down so my brother's were not home. And all the teachers enjoyed the extra bit of time off (of course most other districts were starting break at this point)

In 2011--Wednesday was horrible! 
Being an adult means that people expect you to get up at first light and get dressed and go out and help shovel snow off the driveway. The drifts were kind of interesting in the way they formed a ring around my car. Like it had a forcefield, not that it could go anywhere. 
Then more snow fell, as I sat around with all three of my brothers in the living room watching Heartland. That may sound like a great family moment, but not so much. We're not good with sharing confined spaces. (also there's a lot of disrespect among the siblings) Plus, since I didn't actually join people outside, only made hot cocoa and called them all in one by one for a warm up, they refused to clean the driveway behind my car. 

Then more snow fell. Pete retreated from the house to sit in his car for a bit. And eventually that afternoon, I had to go out and get busy clearing a path behind my car. I took pictures. I only made it about half way through the two foot high pile of snow that went from the edge of the driveway to the far side of my car and then straight down to the bottom. (more than a midsized car length away). Steve came out to help me clear the foot between my car and the edge of the drive, where it was light because of the magic drift winds. 
Pete made an attempt to get into work more than 10 miles away to help them clear their lots, but annoyingly never reported in that he was safe at any point. 

Thursday--no more snow, but bitter cold and a lack of decent snow removal led to another snow day. (um, yea?) 
At least it was clear enough that Pete could get out and was gone to work all day, but that just meant that there was more shovelling for me to do. That last part of the driveway was really quite the challenge--as you can imagine the piles along the edges are rather high and I spent just as much time pushing the tops back as I did heaving more up there. Then we had to do the area by the mail box, and we cleared the neighbors across the way a bit more so that he wouldn't plow into Dick's car when he backed out. (he came out and did a doubletake at one point but never said anything if he thought it was us. I mean, he saw us at the mailboxes earlier in the day--which are about two feet from the end of his drive)

Friday--still no school. It was pretty cold early this morn, so I could have seen a delay. And the reasons for the cancellation were due to snow piles being so high and streets not being cleared enough that kids waiting for busses could be in danger/and walkers would have no where to walk. Which, is a decent reason. But I kind of think the upper levels should have had school anyway. At least 7-12, maybe 5&6 too. Let the little guys stay home.

Graduation was scheduled for june 2nd. The last day of school was originally May 31st. Now it's June 4th... Hmm... We do finals the last days of school... how many seniors do you think want to be coming to school for finals after they've gone through commencement? 

**The principal sent out an email today saying that they're attempting to shift the end of term schedules (now that we've lost so many days this trimester) and trying to move graduation to the 7th. fingerscrossed."

"event","My car wouldn't start this morning. 
Steve had gone out to warm it up and so he had it 'running' on accessory power for a bit, I wasn't paying attention at first and had gotten down to the bottom of the drive where I tried to get it to turn over and realized that i was having one of two problems.
1. the slightly less than half a tank of gas was frozen or 
2. the battery was dead/too cold. 

We (spud, aniki, and me) couldn't get the car moved in neutral to the side of the road so we woke up some neighbors to help. My accross the street neighbor got his daughter's car that's about the same size as mine up into our grass/driveway and gave me a jump and once it was going I parked it on the side of the road and let Aniki take me to work. slowly. very slowly. 

The nice thing about writing about it here is...that in a few years when I can't remember how long ago I changed the battery, I'll have this record. 

LJ says it was Jan of '07 when the alternator died and I'm fairly certain they got me a new battery then too."

Second--I got a new phone. It has assimilated my phonebook into it's memory and then thrown the 'paper' version out. Problem is when I want to call someone I have to know at least part of their phone number because it doesn't give me a list of names. GAH! My phone defeated me.  

Third--I got a new phone. It connects me to the 'net. Thus I have not been on my laptop lately. :(  I must remedy this.

Fourth--I go back to work tomorrow.... boo. (yeah income, boo bedtime/early morning work hours)

Fifth+--um, got a new mattress, stalked Tron @ library and watched it, took brothers to see Tron: Legacy in 3D (Aniki didn't even bother putting the glasses on), and due to comments made by A over eggnog I checked out Stardust the same day. I rather enjoyed it, so now I'm reading the book. 

For those keeping score (not sure in what game, but score nonetheless) I am now reading my second Neil Gaiman book ever. (The first being the Graveyard Book.)  
I wonder if it's on the short list of things I can take a book test on @ work. We're trying to show the kids up, and also there's some staff contest going on."

The 2010 Breakdown: <lj-cut text=""(as recorded in lj)""> 

January: I gave up on the super-awesome-choose-your-own-adventure story. /o\ 
But I wrote a short fanfic. \o/ 
February: Seemed to be all about figuring out how to get kids to respect my authority without turning into Cartmen and watching Psych.
March: i remember lots of testing... soul-sucking testing...and Psych to get me through it.  Run-in w/ Prince Taken
April: went to Nashville (before the great muddy waters came) and spent time with E. <b>*\o/*</b> 
May: Epic Birthday Baseball Game. Lots of family time... 
June: consisted of a lot of planning interrupted by an overnight with my niece at a zoo. \o/  And reconnecting with boys who I used to work with. One potential frog in play.    Wrote 3 Chapters *\o/* 
July: Frog came and went without a prince taking his spot. (nor a toad)  /o\  Have weird dream about Prince Taken. Made new friend. Reach milestone birthday: My 9th 21st to be exact. (Many boys cannot add). Worst hangover ever ensued EPIC <b>/o\</b> Which technically killed rez 5, but also poked holes at rez 4 /o\
August: Phoenix \o/ Vegas \o/. Learned a new level of patience while locating a lower level of hell all with pretty backgrounds. Met Tim & Tom. Not sure on actual Frog status.  --Returned to work--improving rez 3.  \o/
Had KittyComp stolen! /o\ Lost 3 Chapters!! 
September: spent bitterly missing KittyComp. Achieved zero writing, only went to work (and soccer games), didn't get drunk over it partially due to lack of funds (due in part to Vegas), and<i>if</i> I had managed to meet a frog I would have scared him off with my bitterness. Also, I did not use this internet free time to clean anything useful.  Oh! AND 'Ruko broke down two weeks in a row on way to Chipotle's. Just proof that I a. had fixed the finances but then recked them again. 
October: spent month eating potatoes at work to save money (no seriously)/eating cheap school lunches. Became a money-saving cave-dweller that occasionally went bowling.  Did get hit on by a bowler...but NEVER was he a Frog. (Um Halloween Parties--saw many interesting costumes from Edward to Brokeback and everything in between, adjacent to, and in a superhero universe. )
November: Bought Mac(iavelli). Bowled. Ate. Shopped. Read. 
December: Located my flashdrive, discovered compatibility error is harsh. Worked. Worked. Worked. Returned to the Church. 
</lj-cut>

The short is, I remember not any significant cleaning until such a time as mice infested our house and for Xmas. I did far more reading than writing (though not mentioned above) and the bit I did do got stolen/is incompatible. I did however fix my monetary issues. A job helps a lot with that. Keeping it adds. I mostly left the frogs in the pond, the few short encounters did not result in attempts to test princehood. I may not have fallen down on my birthday, but that's ONLY because I surrounded myself with boys whose sole purposes were to make sure that didn't happen. The only rez I'd say I truly successfully fulfilled was seeing new and exciting places. I had many adventures in 2010. 


Resolutions for 2011. 
1. Screw 'cleaning'.  Prepare my stuff to be moved out at moments notice so I can run if I get the chance!
2. Get the darn chance!!! 

Okay that's not really a resolution. 

3. Set realistic writing goals and tell someone other than My computer about them so that someone can guilt me into finishing on time.  
4. Keep going even if my deadline passes! 

So those are both about writing.

5. Read at least half of this stack of books before I buy enough to double it. 
6. Stay 'in' this year. Meaning don't try to find frogs, princes or even flings until I re-establish me.

Oooh...deep. 

7. Be more assertive in group settings/express myself more clearly.
8. Join some groups. (containing actual peers)

Actual goals you really want to achieve repeatedly!"

"event","Dear Diary,

          I couldn't sleep last night. I kept thinking that I heard a mouse running around the base of my bed.  But mostly, I think it was over by the couch chewing on something paper based. In my frustration I named it Lesley--hoping it to be a boy. 

Dear Diary,
   
         Today I moved the buzzer from my bathroom to the outlet nearest my bed in hopes of preventing rodents waking me up in the night. 

          But now I fear there may be two. I think they were fighting. One squeaks ALOT! I shall call it Squeakers. 

Dear Diary, 
   
         I've complained to the powers that be that I need help with these so called humane traps. They seem to already be baited but um...is the bait supposed to be fuzzy? 

         Um, well, I've located the source of their food. I hate to say it, but there seems to be some long forgotten about chocolate in that bag on the couch. The little mouse that lead me to it was white. Interesting. 


Dear Diary, 

           It's been <i>weeks</i>, we've cleaned up, but I still can't convince any of them to go into the traps. I've not been sleeping well, <b?and</b> now I think they've reproduced. Hey, wait, people upstairs are seeing little things scurry along the baseboards. Now maybe I'll get some new traps. 

Dear Diary, 

          The matriarch has purchased some less-than-humane traps. I've re-set the humane one nearest the squirrel-corn that they seem to be getting into. And set up four mice-go-in-but-never-come-out-traps in various places where they've been suspected of being. 

 
Dear Diary, 
 
         The very next morning. I found a sprung trap on the couch. AND one little baby found his way into the humane trap with the stash of hershey kisses. 
         Aniki is very sad that one of them has been killed. Hey, if more would find their way into the humane traps I'd be perfectly fine with that.  It may have been Squeakers, I don't hear anyone being verbal anymore. 

         *We also attempted to feed the snakes at school today, thus giving me multiple stories of mouse/rat demise to tell Tiffy while we were watching another pair of Vampire Diary episodes. 

          Tiffy is very upset with me for telling her about the killing of little animals. 
          She has no issues with Elena killing snakes on the tv, cuz they sneak up on you etc, etc. 

....

Dear Diary, 
    
         No mice fell into any of the other traps today, but we watched a bigger one show all the little ones how to run around them. Seriously my living room has become like a race track. Around and around and around they go, clearly, we need a different kind of trap. 

        Ha. mice don't sneak up on you like snakes. 
        Pete has now managed to cause me to sleep less, something about tales of Luke & Leia crawling on him in the night when they'd get out of their cages. Of course those were pets, not wild animals. But now every air bubble or knot of bedsheets is a potential mouse that needs to be taken care of! Sigh. 

        Spud screamed and came out of his room in a panic, he thinks he hears mice.  Pete investigated and found two that just stared at him, but his room is too messy to chase them successfully. 

Dear Diary, 

        It snowed a lot today. I placed a trap down on the couch where I caught the last one. 

        It was sprung before bedtime. 
        Pete discovered that the mouse was still alive, tail sticking out and wagging. Took it somewhere far away to release it.  Says this one was bigger than the others. 

       Placed trap back on couch. 
       Also bought sticky traps. Set them up at the ends of the entertainment center that they run behind. Placed one behind the trap they keep running around, right in the path that they would take to avoid it. 


Dear Diary, 

       Another mouse has gone into that trap on the couch.  
       Also two babies found themselves in a sticky situation while trying to go behind the entertainment center. 

        In the morning, Pete disposed of these three babies. Reset trap, hopping that the scent of others going in would make it seem safer and attract more. 

        Aniki is mad that we keep killing them. Not our fault deadly traps work better!

Dear Diary, 

         A tiny little baby has caught itself on a glue trap. Just it's tail and hind legs are stuck. It tried to free itself by grabbing on to the curtain, but all it did was stick the curtain to the trap. I managed to free the curtain, now the mouse is clinging to Pete's Xbox controller cords, trying to climb up them. Cord is stuck between mouse and trap. Using yard stick and second pair of hands Ma and I got trap free of anything non-mouse related, but he's so adorable pulling himself and the trap along trying to get somewhere to hide. I shall call him Mortimer, at least until he manages to do something stupid that makes watching him try to figure this trap out less cute. 

       Aniki has come home and was talking to Mortimer. He scared him into placing a front paw on the pad... it all went down hill from their. rest in peace Mortimer. 


       Reading up on mouse reproduction--Not happy with the thought that it's been long enough that there could be more than one litter running around. And each litter is 4-14 babies (average of 12). Oh also it only takes 4-7 weeks for them to mature. 

Including Mortimer we're up to seven caught (two released). Score is Ryn 4, Pete 3. More sticky traps will be set tonight. They're catching on slowly, or they're all hiding in Pete and Spud's room. We still haven't caught the biggest one--the one I shall call 'mom'. She's smart. Too smart. But I haven't seen her for two days, neither running about the living room nor in a trap, unless she's quietly crawled into on the Aniki's humane traps that I've placed under things and aren't being checked as regularly as the others. We kinda figure they'd make noise when caught. The others have."

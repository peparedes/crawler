Yeah, cant wait till the 21st.<br>

Anywho, I can't stop pulling out my hair and eating it. Stupid trichotillomania... Gonna get a bald spot if I can't control it.<br>
<br>
I miss everybody soooo much. I'm gonna see if I can maybe manage to
swing up to Charlotte 'round Halloween to visit, go to Scarowinds and
sleep over and stuff. If anyone wants to help me accomplish this, speak
now!<br>
<br>
Gillie says she's gonna make me a lunchbox! I soo can't wait, it's gonna be soooo awesome!<br>
<br>
Been so bored lately, internet's been slow because I'm trying to
download Petz 5 to tide me over till I can buy a DS and Nintendogs.<br>
<br>
Bought my class ring yesterday. Not as a school token but as a really
nice piece of jewelry, I'm too loyal to CCHS and everyone there to
actually adjust to Laney. I even sleep with my CCHS sweatshirt, it's so
pathetic<br>
<br>
Anyone who wants to talk, IM me. Mostly only talked to Gillie and Molly
lately (*glares at Meagan and Faye*). Or if you have my cell #, call me.<br>"

My life is just in a really crappy moment right now. So lonely...

Maybe part of it is that no one cares about what I have to say, or just don't think I have anythign to talk about. Or they themselves are too busy talking to notice and think I have nothing better to do than listen to stuff that I can't even begin to understand, much less want to... But they just go on and on and on... I guess it's my own fault somehow. Why should they bother now, tho? I've been invisible all my life. I should just stay that way."

That night we stayed over at the hotel with him and I watched stuff on TV then went to bed. I woke up later and heard what I assumed was coffee dripping and being made, so I go to the bathroom and see dad sleeping on the way. I thought this was odd so I go to check out the dripping and lo and behold, from the light fixture dripped water onto the microwave. So I unplug it and get dad up and he calls the desk and they say the guy above us is in the shower flooding things. I go back to sleep. I wake to a loud noise, confused. Dad bursts in and yells that its an alarm, a fire alarm. I throw on a bra and grab my phone and purse and rush out with dad and Pete.

So that was all exciting. Had a good dinner because doday was Pete's b-day.

Going to get contacts tomorrow. Yay!"

I was summoned by her and I thought it was to discuss the work I hadn't been doing. Turned out it was just because she was wondering how I was doing. I told her all about my stuff. Moving, horrible mother, dad, grades, ect... She was so good to talk to. I cried a lot. *has a headache now* She was nice enough to show me the grades I'd have on my report card since I was fearing the worst and my mother's reaction. Turned out to not be too bad... I'm still worried, but not as much. She's just so nice... *cries*

Today was the start of my toga-wearing career, as in English class it was required because we had just begun reading Julius Caesar. She told us to bring in the most horrible, gaudy sheets we could find to wear. She said that the worst, most hilarious one would recieve bonus points. I decided to bring in a leapord-print sheet... Needless to say, I won.

*sighs* I need to calm down.

So happy to have cleaned my room yesterday, It's so... not gross... Plus I think I might have gotten bonus points from my mom (I did the bathroom too), which will help when she sees my report card."

"event","""A good move."" Yeah, right. I hope to holy hell she can't get a job there.

Her lame assed excuse is that we'll be with family (They aren't MY family! I hate those women!) and that we'll become a better family there. ""Bullshit!"" I say. I only have two more years with you, you fat hag. Don't act all motherly now! Be a dictator or a friend, but nothing else!

WHERE'S HER HEAD!!?? I ONLY HAVE TWO MORE YEARS OF SCHOOL LEFT!! Using Pete's four years to my two dosen't do you any good, either. One, it's likely to be FIVE more years, and two, I'm doing better than he is! And what's more is I've already started! It's near impossible to get back into it after moving like that!

And another thing! Where the hell will I be able to finish out my language!? It's not like you can take third year Latin ANYWHERE!!! Hell, I was planning on taking FOUR years!

I guess making it into AP English dosen't matter to her either! Well it matters to me! I wouldn't be able to get into anything like that THIS late in another school!

The most important thing, though, are my friends! MY WHOLE FUCKING WORLD!! And she's just tossing the most important, cherished, needed, only just discovered, part of my life DOWN THE TOILET!! And the thing is is that she KNOWS that this is the FIRST time EVER that I've had any semblance of a social life! The miserable bitch KNOWS this! But, noooo, she'd throw her daughter's only ticket to some form or SANITY and NORMALCY away just to make her as miserable as she is.

""Oh, there's e-mail and the internet and the telephone,"" she says. NO FUCKING SHIT, REALLY!? I HAD NO IDEA!! SIGN ME UP, THEN!! GO AHEAD, LOCK ME IN A BOX FOR ALL ETERNITY, IF THAT'S THE CASE!! Yeah, human contact, who needs it?

I NEED IT, THAT'S WHO!!

Let's just put it this way, with them around, I forget that I live in a hell-hole dump and that my life isn't worth crap except to all of them.

With them I can cry in real life a little less, and in movies a little more.

So let's just hope that she can't get a job there.

If she does, I don't know what I'll do. I guess it'll start to unfold this weekend...

Then again, I DO know what I'll do. I'll become the child that she WISHES she never had. Oh, I won't cut up or slack off or anything, no. I'll work my hardest to become prettier, and healthier, and smarter, and brighter, and wealthier, and most of all HAPPIER than she is, ever has been, or ever will be! Not that I'm not most of those things already. But after all this, and here's the kicker, she'll be the proudest mother you ever saw, brought down only when I refuse to acknowledge her role in any of it, any of it at all.

I know it's incredibly cruel, but I'm afraid I feel next to no remorse in saying it. I only imagine how I'll work my way to that highest level.

If I do in fact move, my only hope for immediate happiness would be to be able to be around Christopher in school or whatever. I DO miss him, and I don't feel much like making new friends. It'd just be easier that way, I guess.

Not that I've lost my ambition, however. It's quite the opposite... And the one thing that I'll work hardest on is showing her that I won't become the lonely, bitter old maid that SHE is. I'll make sure that I'll NEVER be either alone, spiteful, or both, one way or another.

And at this point, I'm not even sure that I care what she might think of you, Chris. I mean, what's the worst she could do? Get mad about the age difference, or the closeness, or some obscure thing that matters only to her and cut me off from any form of communication with anyone? Big deal, I'll get out somehow, right? Or maybe she'd ship me away? For how long? Her most successful child? Psssh, it'd just prove she's a hypocrite.

Gah, whatever, man. I'll think of something or cry (Isn't it supposed to be die?) trying.

I took more meds, so it's a night of endless rage and hopefully homework for me."

"event","I got back from dad's house yesterday night to a warm reception. ^^

Today was very stressful and I don't wanna talk about it.

So back to my trip.

The flight up was pretty cool because daddy was the pilot (his voice sounded weird on the intercom). Got to his place pretty late so I played with Moose and LB (his cats) and went to bed. The next day was pretty much the same thing, laziness with cats. We rented Exorcist: The Beginning (scary crows!) and Diehard (Alan Rickman!) and I watched them with Pete.

The next day we drove down to Washington DC (dad lives in Delaware) to Uncle John's house. His wife, Linda is a really cool lady, and their son is funny (he's three now). Since it was already late afternoon once we had sat and talked with them for a while we just went out to eat.

The next day was really awesome. We took the subway to the zoo and spent a few hours there (It was too cold out!). I saw the pandas and lions and cheetahs and tons of other animals. We even got to see a really old sea lion (She was 27 and the life expectancy in the wild is like 16.) being taught a new trick. They're so awesome in the water!

After the zoo, dad and Pete wanted to see the Air and Space museum. I didn't feel like going through so I stayed in the food court and waited for them for an hour, reading. Then we headed to the new Native American museum, which was in a really really nifty and beautiful building. It was just too bad that we had so little time and that there were only a few exhibits so far.

We drove back that night and the next day we just lazed around waiting for our flight. I didn't want to come back so soon. I'm glad I did tho, I guess.

In other news, I think mom wants us to move to Wilmington next year. I DON'T FUCKING WANT TO!! I rarely use that word, and damnit, I mean it! I DON'T want to leave my friends and my school and the city! FUCK her sisters! I loathe them as it is! I'll stay with a friend or by myself before I move there! Getting into the same school that Christopher (my friend from waaaay back) goes to now is no consolation! She can fucking move there AFTER I'm done with school here. *fumes violently*

I've made myself mad now. Gotta remember to do my HW too. T___T

Happy White Day everyone!"

"event","Ok, so there I was, in school, worrying about the major homework that I didn't do, and suddenly WHAM!! And all hell breaks loose.

You see, when I walked to school in the moring as I almost always do, I was admiring the spring climate and loving it. After I had reached school, talked with friends for a while and headed on over to first period with Meagan we saw a mighty storm out the window. We're talking wicked crazy winds, here. We admired the storm and the power blipped several times and then the storm calmed down to simply windy, as it had been before.

By the end of first period, announcements about room reassignments came on, but I didn't pay attention.

When I got to second period, however I began hearing about how the roof was apparently collapsing. I was freaking out. It was so cool and a little scary and hinted at the promise of an early dismissal, but the tale was hard to believe.

It was confirmed by the end of that period and more rooms were reassigned. I headed on down to the cafeteria instead of the regular room for Latin with high hopes.

Through Latin and part of my next class (Moarlity) the hopes of getting out early and dodging my guilt of admitting not having done the assignmet for English class, were fading. But soon I was delighted to no end when the announcements came on yet again and told us that we were to go home early due to what they believed to be ""extreme structural damage to the school.""

So now I sit here, elated. Hopefully I'll bring myself to do the assignment tonight and hopefully school will have to be cancelled tomorrow as well.

What a fun morning... :3"

Song: Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine
We took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held I close
I swore I'd never let her go
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
So come on, oh come on, oh come on

I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time
For me to go, so let me know if it's alright
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth
She couldn't scream while I held I close
I swore I'd never let her go

Tell me what you wanna know
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
And then you whisper in my ear
I know what you're doing here
So come on, oh come on, oh come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on

This song is incredibly creepy if you listen to what he's saying (he kills her, I believe) but It's just sooo goood."

"event","Today was a good day for me. (Last night wasn't too bad, either.) Stressful, tho. I'm not gonna have the best of weekends either... ;-; Too much work to do...

I think that I might make a habit of it to straighten my hair at least most days (don't wonna kill it). I like the way it feels this way and people seem to like the way it looks, too. I like the way it looks without my glasses even better, too. Need to get that eye appointment.

Today I also finished my tiger painting in art! It's so awesome! My best yet! I wish I had a good enough camera to take a picture for everyone to see, but alas... Looks very good. Maybe I can smuggle a few friends in there... Or get in Amyrillis...

My head kinda hurts, maybe I should get some water... Probably need to get my math homework out of the way, too. :(

Bleh..."

It was a reflex, and was done mostly because so many people were around. ^^;;"

"event","Seems like nowadays whenever I meet a guy he either ends up being married, engaged or has a girlfriend?  I had been seeing Paul for 2 weeks when while he is at my house hijs wife calls his cell phone.  I didn't know who it was and he never said anyhting about being married..anyways he tells her he will be home shortly so I confronted him about who that was and he tells me it was his wife.  That is some messed up stuff...I guess I'm stupid but he played me, we dated for 2 weeks, had sex and he is married!!!!! why does this crap always happen to me? grrr heh"

"event","Not much to celebrate on Father's day.  Except to be upset at the fact that my Father left my mother only a year after I was born.  I cannot be happy on Father's day, and will never have respect for the man that brought me into this world.  As far as I am concerned Father's day doesn't exsist.

I spent my Sunday out shopping and at the pool.  Bought myself a new skirt, it's tight and navy blue goes with my top I bought the other day.  The pool was fun, me and my friend Jessica spent the time talking and checking out the guys, not to mention seeing what guys were checking us out as well, I love the summer and skimpy bathing suits :)"

"event","Why do people feel the need to be rude?  There is this one supervisor at my work that is constantly rude to everyone, not only does he make rude comments but also has yelled at a few people in my office, nobody should have to take that!  Luckily none of them has been me yet, but I wouldn't take it if it was, that's not worth a $12 an hour job!  

In other notes I got to have some fun with my exhibitionist side to me.  I was wearing a short skirt the other day to the mall it came to just mid thigh and it was pretty tight.  Well I went to the shoe store where I know they have a few cute boys that work there and decided to try on a few pairs of shoes and having the shoe salesman help me with them.  I made sure to ""accidentally"" give him a few good glimpses up my skirt, I hope he enjoyed the show! :)  From the way he was fumbling I'm sure he did.  Anyways hope you all are doing good!"

I will miss meeting all the new people and laid back atmosphere.  I got a new job as a secretary for this small computer company, wish me luck I start on Monday.  I guess the short skirt at the interview trick worked it's charm ;) lol"

"event","Ohh yes I did!  I had the best sex of my life this weekend and it was with my boss from work.  I know i know, everyone is gonna be on my case about this one, but I DONT F'ING CARE!!!!  He is 36 but he has a hot body is a great love maker and a nice guy.  So he is my boss, we enjoy each other's company, and he shower's me with compliments, and gifts.  Right now I'm not looking to settle down so if I can enjoy his company and have great sex I'm not going to complain.  He said he still can't believe he is fucking me, he said he has wanted my ass since he saw me at the interview, guess it was a good idea to wear that super short skirt and low cut top.  Now I just can't wait for work tomorrow...."

"event","Yeah that's right, my Ex is going to be in town this weekend and wants to get together.  I'm not sure what to do.  See he moved away while we were going out and broke off the relationship.  It was impossible for either of us to date when we are a thousand miles apart.  He is in town to visit his family this weekend and wants to go out to dinner.  I would love to see him, but I know if I did I'd want to rip his clothes off and spend the night with him, and I'd get attached just like I did before.  Plus to make things even more difficult he has a no girlfriend back home.  So I think it's better for me to just kinda not see him while he is here.  Hope I have the strength!

p.s. Jessica Alba is so lickable!"

Washed my car today, the damn thing needed it!  It's not good when you have a black car that turns gray.  Me and Cheryl went out and got some coffee today and saw these really cool liquid push up bras at Nordstrom, I'm gonna get me one of those bad boys so I can wear this outfit I've been invisioning.  A button up shirt with the push up bra and my clevage exposed a little :)  Anyways gotta get ready for bed! night!"

"event","Well my weekend was a blast!  I'll give a small recap of the events.  On Friday night I got all dressed up in my new skirt and me and Cheryl went out and got a bite to eat at Applebee's (her boyfriend work's there)  so we got some free drinks and got a little food and stayed till about 11 then got ready to head over to the club.  The club is 21 and over but I know the bouncer and we were able to get in.  I met this one guy who was buying me drinks so I was getting pretty fucked up!  They were playing great music so I danced with him while Cheryl found another boy to dance with.  me and this guy are grinding, and getting pretty heavy then Cheryl comes over and tels me she needs help.  So I head off with her and we start to dance together so the guy that was bugging her would leave her alone.  2 guys come up to us and start dancing with us.  I can feel the guy behind me, he is hard and grinding me which was quite a turn-on.  He then proceeds to put his hand up under my skirt discreetly and rubs me through my panties.  We continue to dance and explore , he had a huge thingie from what I could tell ;).  I was really getting wasted at this point so Cheryl being the responsible one tells me that we need to go to the bathroom.  The guy gives me his number, I don't think I'll call him though.  The rest of the night was pretty uneventful, I got home around 3am and crashed!  I had to work Saturday night, it was busy and I wore my tan tight hip huggers, that worked for the tips.  Came home and called my ex Danny but he wasn't home.  Today I just lounged around I'm tired as hell, i love to just relax for a day!   

By the way can anyone help me fix that picture I tried to post?  I'm having a hard time figuring it out!"

"event","Just got home from work, not too bad a tip night $56, that's what happens when I wear my tight black pants ;)  Althought my feet hurt like a biatch!!  Something I realized tonight while I was at work, read below:

The stare, tonight I felt it, what some girls find gross, or annoying I somehow can't get enough.  There was a good looking older gentleman at the bar tonight..I noticed his glare as I walked by.  He would stare blantantly and I would then subconciously give him more of a show.  I'd wipe down a table in front of him so he could look over my body.  I'd take my hair down and play with it while I look out of the corner of my eye o see if he's paying attention.  That hard intense stare from a man over my body is what turns me on....I know it sounds bad, but ever since I can remember I craved the attention..maybe something is wrong with me..but for now I cannot stop."

"event","Well here goes my first entry, Hi to all you fine folks out there!  I have to work today which I'm not looking forward too, Thursdays are so slow which means no tips for Muah.  (I work as a waitress, lucky me ;( ) But tomorrow me and my friend Cheryl are going out to our favorite club to get our dance on!  I bought this killer new black skirt to go with my white halter top and black boots, can't wait to knock em dead!  Maybe I can post a pic up of the outfit after this weekend.

I sometimes wonder why we have dreams and nightmares at night, there has to be a reason, i guess one of those questions that will never be answered!"

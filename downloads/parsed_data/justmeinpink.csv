Once upon a time there was a house, and in that house there lived an evil evil donkey, when all of the suddenly, 3 chainsaw wielding munchkins busticated down the door and cut the cake, before they took the cheese! so then, thenthenthen, Mr. E. Donkey, he told me i could call him that, says, he says, go away, im making little asses, cant you see? cuz thats funny since donkeys are asses too. Enthen, the chainsaw wielding munchkins, they runned away they did! So Then, the asses just POPPed out, and BAM, 23 and hyf (half) baby asses are runnin around, bumpin into eachother and walls and stuff stuff. Enthen, like woah! the chainsaw wielding munchkins are back! except now, now they are gremlins, cuz they ate the cake and the cheese, which turned out to be one in the same cheesecake! Yay! Don't you know that cheesecake turns munchkins into gremlins? silly rabbit, dont touch that! So then the asses and the, now, gremlins start bumpin into eachother and that makes the fireworks go off. Literally, all of the sudden, fireworks start goin off, and its all fun and games and pretty colors until the fireworks ReaLLy EXPLODE. Enthen they all blowed up. That is to say that the little asses, the big Mr. E. Ass Donkey, and all three chainsaw wielding munchkins turned gremlins (because of the cheesecake remember?) all goed BOOM. Bye Bye everyone, all thats left is pieces of the house, and several small slices of cheesecake as proof. True Story, that is.

after school..me emily painter sam..other ppl..then the wrestlers..then i was being  attacked by a key  chain..joe was whipping me in the legs..and i was like freaking out.. then he wanted me to wrestle him.. without some articals of clothing...which um..no..
and  lunch sucked ass...and now it still sucks...today is one of those days :(..yeah  and besides everyone bitching at me too...oh yeah im such a fucking horrible person.. but im just going to laugh it off..

now.. you could always leave me something to acutally make me smile..since i have only smiled 2 times today..at erica and at joe..that its... thats sad since im usually the  most hyper out of everyone...

 i feel like shit....ughhhhh..

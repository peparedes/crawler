And before you go accuse someone of sleepin with someone you should think about who lived with both the guys we are talking about!!!! So yeah Paige is whoopin ur ass.&nbsp; And Russ you fucked up when you threatened me on the phone, you got the wrong people pissed now.&nbsp;And Like I said tiff I might be a ""spic lover"" but our the one who got pregnant with ones kid, you were in that club alot longer than i have been, the difference is mine loves me back and doesnt beat me. then again none of the guys i have ever been with have. But straight up to tell the truth you should have never said anything about the baby boi you killed and then told him that his son hated him... think about it YOU&nbsp; KILLLED YOUR OWN CHILD.&nbsp; So who does he hate?&nbsp; Other than that I am on a roll havent been sober for like 2 weeks. O figures out when Me, Robert, Paige, Jush, and Kyle are getting together.... APRIL. WOO WOO!!! But yea life is pretty godd other than all these lil shit talk wannabes and hoes. But I guess no matter what they aint never gonna change, and for all the people who are thinkin what a bitch, you tell me if ur baby mama went and got an abortion and then told you exactly what the kid looked like in the ultrasound and what its name was gonna be and that it hated you would you not want ot kill the bitch.&nbsp; Chris left for a lil while he is going to see his brothers and prolly bring one back with him. I havent seen Tommy or Marky in forever. I miss them alot. But yeah I gotta go cuz my SPIC is on the phone and he wants to talk to me. </FONT></P>

You are very beautiful on the outside<br>which will entrance any mortal into believing<br>what you lead them to, but sooner or later they<br>will understand the deadly ways of your true<br>nature. Despite your dark side you are very<br>talented, you have many gifts that you leave<br>locked up in favor of whatever else your doing<br>at the moment.

"event","<P><FONT color=#663366 size=4>like i said in my last entry, my ex friend tiff called me a backstabber.&nbsp; I was just gonna let it go, but i thought about it and thats bullshit.&nbsp; she is the only person that i have considered a friend to call me that and she is totally wrong.&nbsp; she has no idea how much i have done for her or how much i stick up for her.&nbsp; so many people tell me not to hang out with her because they dont like her but i said then dont like her she is my friend.&nbsp; the most recent one was robert.&nbsp; Now he has a reason not to like her she sat right here in my house and yelled at him for no reason when she had no right.&nbsp; he told me he didnt want her to be around after he got there and i told him (the love of my life) that she was gonna be around and if he didnt like it dont come. he told me that he thought she would fuck me over just from the way shit went down that night.&nbsp; I told him he was delusional but u know he was right and i have no plans what so ever to help her or talk to her.&nbsp; She is the one that stabbed me in the back, she lied to me about so much shit and then she tries to say i should let it be cuz its the past, but i think thats bullshit.&nbsp; she was supposed to be one of my best friends and she fed me so much horseshit and i believed it.&nbsp; i dont know anymore. but i have hit people for alot less.&nbsp; i did care about her i loved her like a sister, but i cant say that anymore, cuz u cant love someone u dont know, and with all the lies she fed me i dont think i know her anymore. she blames her ex for mokin her the way she is, what shedoesnt realize is no one makes u change&nbsp;u have to wanna change and evidently she did want to on some level because she way different. but hey people change not always for the best but they change.&nbsp; maybe one day she will tell me the truth but until then i cant be friends with her because i cant stand lies. she has people that dont even know me threaten me and thats bull too, if she wants to fight and argue with me she should at least do it herself.&nbsp; i asked her why jenni had a reason to get into this and she says she is my sis and she is pissed, ya know thats exactly what she said about me last week, so i am never takin her word ever again.&nbsp;but yeah i am done for now. pieces.</FONT></P>

So yeah my days been all fucked up.&nbsp; Tiff says fuck me over some lil bullshit and she aint even have the decency to talk to me about it but then i found out she lied to me about a bunch of shit if u know me and u know the thing i hate most in this world is when some one lies to me, but for her to do it is worse cuz she was supposed to be one of my best friends, then she goes and talks shit about me to her friend jenni, but i am the backstabber.&nbsp; she is the only person to ever use that word to describe me, and thats not what i am. but yeah then her friend goes and talks about Robert and she doesnt know either of us. I dropped it though we arent friends and i dont trust her and never will again. but anywho, i talked to my boy chris in oki and he might be comin home sooner than everyone here thought.&nbsp; robert is tryin to get here for new years.

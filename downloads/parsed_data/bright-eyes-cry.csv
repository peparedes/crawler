Well...Corey told everyone we were dating and I made it clear that we
weren't. So, I like totally flipped about it. Then..two days ago, my
older sister broke her arm when she went ice skating with her
boyfriend, Mark. Today she got surgery on her arm and she's been sick.
I stayed home to watch her. I pretty much sat around today and watched
the state championship football game. <span style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 0); font-weight: bold;"">TJ won!</span>
It was the best game we had all year. We beat the shit out of Manheim

"event","<P>Hey all. I just wanted to start this thing to get things off of my mind.</P>
<P>Let me tell you about myself. My name is Marli. Im 15...going on 16 on December 23rd. Im in 10th grade..and umm...I dont know what else to say..</P>
<P>Just recently I broke up with my boyfriend, Bij. We were in a long distance relationship for 7 months and I really couldn't take it anymore. We're still BEST friends, but we just need time to be teenagers. He's a great kid, and he will ALWAYS have a special place in my heart. I mean, he was my first love, so yeah...</P>
<P>Anyways....&nbsp;<BR>Last weekend was pretty good. I've been hanging out with my friend Corey a lot lately. I guess you can say I have a crush on him, but its nothing too serious. Friday night I went bowling with Corey and Alyssa. We all had so much fun. Just for the record, me and Alyssa CAN'T bowl! Corey totally made us feel like crap, cause he was a big showoff! hehehe. Umm..Saturday night I went to the movies with Corey and my cousin, Christine. We went to see The Grudge. That sucked. A few times it scared me, but it was a stupid movie overall. So then, this week we had our Sadie Hawkin's Dance. It was on Tuesday, because we had the day off on Wednesday for Conference Day. It was alright. Me and Corey hung out with my friends most of the night. I felt really bad cause Corey had a date and he didnt spend a lot of time with her. It was a little awkward cause we both were in a really....weird???...mood. I texted him after the dance and said ""Im sorry for the way I acted tonight"" and he texted me back telling me that he loved me and that I mean the world to him. It kind of...weirded me out. It's way too soon for love... I dont even want to think about that right now. So, after the dance, I slept over Julie's with Chels. We were so friggin tired after the dance that we went straight to bed. In the morning, I texted Corey again and I asked him what he meant by ""love"" and he said he really cares about me, and I told him not to say love yet...because its not right. and he agreed with me. Im actually really looking forward to this weekend. Tomorrow is Britt's surprise party. We're having it at Kate's house.

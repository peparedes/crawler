"event","I've decided once again that I want/need to start writing again. Looking back on my more recent posts from two years ago, has made me realize how much I've grown over time and that I will probably never stop. I also know that I need an outlet because I don't call people with my thoughts/problems the way I used to and although that's probably a good thing, I still need an outlet to get things off my chest. I don't know how many old friends are still on here, but I guess I will soon find out."

"event","My trip to the Bahamas with Chris was AWESOME!! We did a lot of eating, drinking, and well...you know:) He had to ""take care"" of me a couple of nights because i drank too much, but no  holding the hair back or anything like that! The first night i was a bit queasy from the ship moving so much, but after that i handled it like an old pro! Anyway, here are some photos that i took with my new digital camera that Chris bought me for our 9 months together...the 25th of December will be one year!"

"event","Joe Normal
47 % Nerd, 4% Geek, 30% Dork  
For The Record:

A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia.
A Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often an obscure or difficult one.
A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common social expectations/interactions.
You scored less than half in all three, earning you the title of: Joe Normal. 

This is not to say that you don't have some Nerd, Geek or Dork inside of you--we all do, and you can see the percentages you have right above. This is just to say that none of those qualities stand out so much as to define you. Sure, you enjoy an episode of Star Trek now and again, and yeah, you kinda enjoyed a few classes back in the day. And, once in a while, you stumble while walking down the street even though there was nothing there to cause you to trip. But, for the most part, you look and act fairly typically, and aren't much of an outcast. 

I'd say there's a fair chance someone asked you to take this test. In any event, fairly normal. 

Congratulations!"

MC Chris is a write for Adult Swim on Cartoon Network, but he's also a rapper. I call it nerd rap. At first i thought it was the weirdest thing, but he grew on me so quickly and now i love him.  One of his songs is about Star Wars and here's one of the lines:

""My backpack's got jets
like Boba the Fet
I bounty hunt, for jaba hut
to finance my vette!""

I know it's the dorkiest thing, but i love it!

"event","Yesterday was one of the greatest days i've had in a really long time. Chris and i slept in until 10 or so. We hung out for a while playing video games and fooling around. Then we went to his place so he could take a shower before going to the flea market. At the flea market i purchased another maiden hair fern and a silver dollar fern. (the maiden hair fern i have is almost dead, although the guy told me not to give up on it!) After that we went to downtown MT Dora where i convinced him to illegaly park (it was only for 10 minutes, i'm not a bad influence;) while we grabbed some croissants and i bought an iced coffee. Then we drove back towards my place (10 minutes away) so i could pick up my car from getting an oil change and wash. Then we were off to downtown Disney! We looked in the different stores, drank a beer, and shared an open-faced reuben at Wolfgang Puck's.  Finally it was time for Cirque Du Soleil, La Nouba where we were whisked off into a fantasy land that was a like a dream. It was funny, romantic, erotic, exciting and a lot of other things that i can't even describe. It was just AWESOME. It was everything i thought it would be and MORE.

I can't begin to say how happy i am with Chris. He brings out the best in me and has reminded me that there's nothing wrong with being a hopeless romantic. I can be myself around him and it feels wonderful.

Right now i'm off to work out and then go to altamonte to hang out with the parental unit and the grandparental unit. SHould be fun!"

"event","First, we survived being born  to mothers who smoked and/or drank while they carried us. 
They took aspirin,  ate blue cheese dressing and didn't get tested for diabetes. 
Then after that  trauma, our baby cribs were covered with bright colored lead-based paints. We had no  child-proof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets and when we 
rode our bikes, we had no helmets, not to  mention, the risks we took hitchhiking. As children, we would ride in cars with no seat  belts or air bags. 

Riding in the  back of a pick up on a warm day was always a special treat. We drank water from the garden hose and NOT from a  bottle. We shared one soft drink  with four friends, from one bottle and NO ONE actually  died from this.  We ate cupcakes,  bread and butter and drank soda pop with sugar in it, but  we weren't overweight because WE WERE ALWAYS OUTSIDE  PLAYING! We would leave home in the  morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on.  No one was able to reach us all day. And we were O.K. We would spend hours building our go-carts out of  scraps and then ride down the hill, only  to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the  problem. We did not have  PlayStations, Nintendo's, X-boxes, no video games at all,no 99 channels on cable, no video tape movies, no  surround sound, no cell phones, no  personal computers, no internet or internet chat  rooms..........WE HAD FRIENDS and we went outside  and found them! We fell out of  trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth and there were no 
lawsuits from these accidents.We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and ate worms  and although we were told it would  happen, we did not put out very many eyes, nor did the worms live in us forever. 
We rode bikes or walked to a friend's house and  knocked on the door or rang the bell, or  just walked in and talked to them! 
 Little league had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those  who didn't had to learn to deal with  disappointment. Imagine that!!
The  idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard  of. They >actually sided with the  law!This generation has produced  some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers and inventors ever! The past 50  years have been an explosion of innovation and new  ideas.We had freedom, failure, success and  responsibility, and we learned HOW TO DEAL WITH IT ALL! 


And YOU are  one of them! CONGRATULATIONS! Please pass this on to others who 
have had the luck to grow up as kids, before the  lawyers and the government 
regulated our  lives for our own good. Kind of  makes you want to run through the house with scissors, doesn't it?!"

You are a XPIG--Expressive Practical Intellectual Giver. This makes you a Catch.

You are a magazine-cover, matinee idol dreamboat. Parents love you and want to set you up with their kids. However, first dates are tough because it takes time for your qualities to come out. 

You are generous and kind. You think first and act later. You are cool in a conflict, but your practical side means if your partner throws out emotional appeals (""why can't we do what I want for a change?"") they will grate on your nerves, even when the conflict is resolved. 

You're a romantic. You enjoy the thrill of the hunt, and you don't just fall into bed with anyone. You pay close attention to your significant other's needs, and this makes you an excellent lover and partner. The problem is that your friends and lovers may find it so easy to express things to *you* that they lose sight of whether you feel as comfortable with *them*! This doesn't necessarily make you feel under-appreciated -- you're too well-adjusted and self-aware for that -- but you may feel restless. Thus you seek adventure in your life outside the relationship to prove and actualize yourself. 

Of all the types, you would make the best parent. 

You are coiffed.

My family and I had our typical Christmas eve dinner last night. My mom invited a young couple from the church to come and hang out...they ended up being really cool people. I found myself intentionally trying not to stare at the guy, because he was one of most beautiful men i've ever seen...but ENOUGH about that!

We had dinner, exchanged gifts and at about 1am i drove home tired as hell. I got a shite load of towels (because everyone had heard that i needed them), a great, soft and cuddly purple bath robe that i asked for, and my tifanny's style silver bracelet from my grandma, grandpa, and mom's fiance Julio. I also got a book.

Well i'm off to get my arse in the shower and head off to altamante AGAIN.  I may just sleep there tonight.

your body moves ever nearer
And you will dry this tear

"event","1) Do you think you'll live in FL for the rest of your life?

I'm not sure. I know I don't want to, but FL has a way of sucking you into this vortex!

2) How come I have met your Dad but not your Mom? Where was she when we were little? I'm not sure of that either. I always kept in touch with my mom.  She did come around, but I guess just not while you were around you know?

3) Do you want to have kids, if so, how many?

I do want to have kids. One or two would be good, but I'd be happy with just one! Although sometimes I wonder if it'll ever happen. I definitly want to find the right person first. I don't want to have kids just to have them. I want them to have two parents that are there all the time...what I didn't have.

4) What really happened those two times you appeared in NY? (you know, running away in high school, and running away from the Army) Well, when i ran away to NY, it was because i ran away. My grandparents were so strict that i couldn't even talk on the phone. They didn't trust anyone in FL (like they did you guys in NY) and i had no freedom at all. I got in with the ""wrong"" kids at school and rebelled to the extreme. THe other time, I wasn't running away from the army...i just hadn't shown up to my reserve unit yet. I eventually did and everything was fine. I just too a two month break after boot camp. I had gotten engaged to a marine who proposed to me after 3 weeks of knowing me and he lived in upstate NY (Glens Falls). So that's what happened there.

5) Yo tengo hambre. Quiero comed. (have I spelled it right? I can still say it!) Remember teaching me that? heh heh... A lot of my favorite memories involve your Freeport house. Your grandmother liking Nintendo music, listening to hot97 and looking through pictures in teen magazines, dancing on your back porch, playing wheel of fortune on your computer..... What are your favorite memories from 
Freeport?  

Yo tengo hambe. Quiero comer. Everything was good except the r at the end of the word. ANywho, it's funny, I don't remember my grandmother liking nintendo music:) My favorite memories..wow..i have so many! Riding bikes all over Freeport, getting lost on purpose. Trick or treating. Walking to school in the snow. Ice skating at the Rec Center during the winter. Diving and swimming at the pool in the summer. Sleeping over your house on saturday night and going to mass with you on sunday morning. You dad's famous apple pancakes (YUM!, i've never had them as good since then:), bagels with salmon spread. Badminton in your backyard (gawd how i sucked eh?). NKOTB! ""never neverland"", the little black boy who lived behind us, going to rachel's and hearing her dad blast Gloria Estefan. Pam's continuous piano practice, having a crush on your brother. Your sister calling me Zebo! I could go on forever but you get the idea! Finally learning how to prounounce potpourri..remember...poperdoo?! hehehe."

"event","I dyed my hair back to brown today...well Sally (my hairdresser) did it for me. She told me if i wasn't happy with the highlights, to go back and she would ""fix"" it. All of the dye didn't absorb, which actually left a really pretty lighter brown higlights. It's still dark brown, but with just a little bit lighter tone to it.

Anyway, i have more to talk about than just my hair..;)

I don't know if i've mentioned this before, but where i work there are a few people that used the ""N"" word pretty freely. I'm talking about the term used to degrade black people. Growing up in Queens and Long Island NY, I was never exposed to racism. On the contrary, I flew all over the place including Dominican Republic, Jamaica, France and traveled all over the eastern United States. Not until i moved to FL did i start experience ""southern racist"" mentalities. Of course not everyone here is like this, but unfortunately in the small town i live in i see it (and hear it) too often. Any amount is too much in my opinion.  I've heard this term used by some of my co-workers, but never said anything because I didn't want to start any contraversy. I talked about it with Dr Sher a few times and he agreed that he hated that word also and has even wanted to say something when he's heard it in the past. DOn't get me wrong, the word is not used THAT often around me because i know the people that use it know that it offends me.  Although yesterday i heard the word being used again and i just couldn't FUCKING take it anymore. I politely said to the two women who had mentioned it and said ""you know, racist comments really offend me"". We had kind of a half-ass conversation about it and left it at that. I basicallly just let them know that it bothered me. I let it go, but then started to talk to Dr Sher about what happened (because i knew he is understanding) and i burst out in tears. I don't know what the heck came over me, but when he said ""Oh, Xenia, don't cry.."" it made me cry even more. I just became so SICK of hearing that fucking word ( don't hear it every day, but STILL it's too much) that i almost bawled over the ignorance of some people!!

I told Cindy about this because i really trust her.  Her boyfriend is black and like me, she doesn't see people for the color of their skin. Well apparently the Doctor she works for (the senior Dr. who speaks like 8 languages and is very cultured) asked her how her day was. She told him that she had a good day, but mine wasnt as good. She told him that i got upset because of hearing the word and said something to the people who were using it. She told me he dropped the subject right there. Well apparently (i found out today) he went into the managers office, found out who the culprits were and told them if he ever heard that word used again it would be grounds for termination.

This morning when Cindy told me everything that happened, i was a bit upset because i didn't mean to cause a commotion or stir things up at work. My manager also talked to me and completly supported me, however she commented that it's a ""southern thing"". What i FELT like saying was no....it's a racist thing you fucking bitch! Instead i just nodded. I KNOW that she has used that word also...i don't know if i've heard her use it, but i just know that she's ""back-woods"" also. I told her i was grateful for her support and  so on and so on.

Later when i told Dr Sher everything he told me is glad i said something and that is proud of me. My mom also told me that i did the right thing for standing up for my beliefs. Because of the support of my boss and my mother i know have no doubt that i did the right thing. I don't intend on changing anyone or even their ignorant ways. I do know one thing though....everytime those women use that word again, they will probably think about me and what i said...at LEAST they will remember Dr. Shami yelling at them in his commanding deep voice. 

Maybe i didn't change their opinions, because it how they were raised. But maybe, just maybe they will teach their kids that it's wrong......"

I accepted her as my own. For 3 years, i felt the closest to a mother than i've ever felt. That's gone now, yet i still feel like i need to call her for her birthday. We were very close. She wanted me to marry her daddy...i don't know what to do. Should i call? I didn't get a card or gift. For some reason i don't want to talk to her grandmother or hear her grandfather's commanding voice. I was extremely close to her family...this is so hard. I still talk to gian here and there, maybe i'll call him and then ask to speak to her, because i know he'll be with her later.

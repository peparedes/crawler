I'm excited about that. 
  So I guess I've got alot on my plate I've got replace my PS3 still I have to get Wacom drawing tablet I've already got the pen but if anyone wants to donate to my schooling cause You can.This is what I need at this site http://intuos.wacom.com/Americas/index.php I will take what ever size you get me. Medium would be nice but I really don't care. I already have the programs I need the only other thing I need is this tablet. My next two couple of quarters will be using this device. and of course when I go out into the world.  If you want to donate to my schooling through pay pal I'll leave a link.  I never realised how much school was going to cost but I'm pulling in the grades even though I think I'm not.  I thought I had failed 2 classes and passed both with B's  and A in my third. so I'm not doing that bad. I've got so much to do, Two Concerts I really want to see and getting myself back on my feet."

"event","You know over the past decade I've watched the world change so drastically. To a now Digital world almost entirely. I'm not a purist I love my digital life. But it just seems like our lives are so contrived now. Music is by song not albums. No one owns anything anymore. Everything is backed up somewhere on a drive that can be lost or stolen. From VHS to DVD now Blue-Ray I love my Blue Ray But I don't want to have to download my movies there is something about the tactile feel of owning an object that it's yours that no one can take from you. That your not subject to renting it. It's like books nothing is better than turning pages or feeling parchment under your finger tips. Now with all theses changes I feel like these corporations that start off with hot young talented people be come money making cash cows only interested in how much money they part me with and less with the quality of their products. I'm not making any money off old videos from my childhood that I saw on MTV that I might want to see again. I just want to feel alive. To see the creative juices when people didn't have big budgets to blow on ever little technological device they could squeeze into a video. Now everything is a copyright infringement or a fucking commercial. 
I think my biggest insult to my sanity it the fact that everytime I watch a fucking a movie I've got to watch a fucking Army commercial or any commercial for that matter. If it's not popcorn or candy or trailers fuck the commercials there is enough product placement in the GOT DAMN Movie as it is. When you can have a entire movie from a persons childhood suddenly become about a car line and they change the whole story to fit the car line well...It's shit like this that kills the holidays for me now. All I can think about is THX 1138 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_8YJGdyxxE"

"event","&nbsp;It's been a while since I've shared music with folks Meshell Ndegeocello has a new album out. It's called Devil's Halo. Her music always speaks to me on a personal level. It's laid back and smooth like wine or weed. Like if I enjoyed smoking pot I would take a couple of hits and listen to the album. It's Jazzy it's Rock , it's everything you want to hear with out the stuff you don't . Lyrical simplistic flow with a dash of soul. Warm like a bubble bath after a hard day of work. Beer and a sunset. The Ocean and sunset as well. Chill. Vibrations with out a bunch of screaming. Real Music. Throw in the depth of what she is saying and you have something that will get over looked but has more depth than most of the crap out right now. Music that makes you not think I have to like this cause it's popular I like this cause it's music."

I'm so excited now if I can just find work down here. I've been running around for the past 2 weeks hardcore looking for work. You know it's bad when McDonalds doesn't call you back. Only in that way do I regret my departure from Comcast. I mean it was paying the bills.

But you know what? I miss my straight friends. Is that possible to have more in common with my straight friends than I do my gay friends. Here everyone seems so plastic. I like the faster pace of things a little intimidating in the lifestyle department but it seems that things are going well. I'm in school I start next tuesday. I'm steady looking for work. I've even gone low rent and tried fast food joints. I'm having alot more mood swings here than I ever did in jacksonville. I'm either very happy or very sad there doesn't seem to be a middle ground. I have alot of ideas in the art department and I've done a little sketching here but no finished pieces like at home I liken that to the fact that I don't have any more bristol paper. 

Bill is ok works alot. The only negative thing is that all we do is sit at home. I want to go do stuff at least in jacksonville there was st augie or Orlando wasn't far away but not work is providing so many limits that I think I'm home sick more often than not. Hopefully once school has started and I have something to do that feeling will leave.

Now for the comedy. Funny shit that goes on here. The white guy with a nasty profile explaining he doesn't like black&nbsp;guys&nbsp;goes on a job interview the next guy the guy interviewing him is the one he blocked for saying hello to him. I over heard this next one at a table and I started laughing my ass off. &quot;You know what I hate white guys who come up to you and say &quot;I'm not really into black guys but your really hot&quot; just great your feeling abnormal and I just happen to be black what a&nbsp;perfect introduction&nbsp;line&quot;"

&nbsp;Well my father is only a a year or 2 younger than him. I think&nbsp;&nbsp; people focus on the fact that he is a war hero..If you wish to call him that far two much. Just because you spent time in a camp doesn't make and expert on the other issues at hand. Its a distraction. And being funny I would have be more impressed had he gotten away. But using thought and reason he was known as the songbird, Of course they offered him up a chance to leave he had already embarassed himself by talking. Now you can look at it one or two other ways. He Knew he would face major shame when returning or he was being slowly brainwashed. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either way Using his service as a term of his expertise in Military affairs bothers me. It's like saying because my sister who is a Dr is an expert on Aids or HIV because I have It. She may have more knowledge than most but it's her field. Also using that example. If my sister votes against Help for HIV patients having the special knowledge she does and having had to deal with it on a personal level. I would be insulted and hurt and be suspect at her thought patterns. If you not finding the thread of commonality let me lead you to it...You spend your time in your career after the war combating the information about that war and other prisoners being released. You vote against our troops being taken care of after sustaining injuries.Sorry I don't buy it. In my humble opinion a heroe is someone who dodged bullets and comes back home and tries to make sure that we don't forget about the others who didn't come back whole or didn't come back at all. Who would make sure that if you have to have bullets whizz past,strike,or fly in your general direction for your country that you deserve your schooling fucking free. You deserve the best care that money can buy if you get hurt at the governments expense. I will pay taxes every day of my life for that. Your doing a job that I either couldn't do, can't do or won't do. That to me would be Heroe.
&nbsp;
I'm more than unconcerned with the fact that he was given a choice and didn't take it. Call me un American or what ever it takes alot more than that to gain my respect. Now had he come back and fought to make sure these soilders never had to worry about a thing when they come back off a war. That would have garnered my respect. But his failure to do so leaves him an insignificant white haired old man. I have no faith or respect for his service to our country. Because he turned what should have been a lightning bolt of change for his fellow serviceman to visitation and handshakes and posturing for his political career. He should have made his attempt at the Presidency when it meant something. Not years later when he should be retired on a golf course somewhere or a front porch rocking back and forth. Not offering our country to the enemies of the world through the slow ticking of a unsure heart beat and the rambling madness of Beauty contestant Govenor of a state with the 4th smallest population in the USA who belives in faith healing. 

But I guess my veiw of the world is limited an unimportant. Things can't add up to insane to me. Just like Jesse Jackson lost my respect.His fate was sealed when he met my mother and told her what she needed to be doing in her department at Lincoln University.His actions were condesending to a woman who grew up in the time period in which he once mattered.Although being strong. She brushed it off as him being an asshole but I'm quite sure being a child of the civil rights movement it hurt her even if it was brief fleeting moment. But he nailed the coffin in the respect department with his comments about Obama.For there was the same disrespect and disreguard to a second gen child of the civial rights movement proof of follow through character flaw. I don't give my respect to anyone on whim. Colin Powell is a military man I can respect. Your brother in law is a man I can respect. My Father is a man I can respect. All who have taken a term of service for this country.Are there more? your damn right. To me the Uniform is more than just a well laid piece of cloth over a handsome face and body with the proper bulges in the right place.(wink wink). 

Do I like war? fuck no. But I respect that sometimes war is needed. I respect those who serve but just as I don't give a blanket of disdain and hatred to all people I don't give a blanket of respect to everyone who has served in uniform. I know alot a military people who are assholes and probably shouldn't be in a uniform. Perhaps my passion clouds my judgement. Perhaps I don't let all my views seep into every conversation or blog. Maybe my world is a little one sided to your view. Maybe I'm biased and just want the black man to win. But those who know me should know better. They shouldn't just hope to know. They do know my views are not so tunneled visioned and baseless. The Akeim you Know and love is still Akeim. The person you loved when first met me (not with all the drugs) is back. I'm just a little bit more reasonable and able to take on a more mature view of the world having lived in it. 

&nbsp;We have come a long way and many years from Century 21 Apts. I give you and anyone reading this the power to veto me from life if I stop being a person you love to converse with. If I'm unable to carry on a meaningful conversation at any point in my life. Please make sure that I die. Oops wait somone took care of that already. Ummm..... Well make it quicker than they did. *NOTE* This does not count when drugs or intoxicants are involved. I know some of you sick fucks want to see what I'll leave you in my will.*END NOTE* I love you and didn't mean to make little of the service our loved ones have given or will give.That's not what was intended."

I have never liked McCain. Call me Liberal or what ever you choose too. My life experience as a black man, as a gay man don't give me the right to place my laws on any ones body. Into any ones bedroom. I definatly don't want a woman who thinks that gays can be cured a breath away from power in the world. The ability to spread your legs and pump out kids doesn't make you fucking mother of the year. Just like using abortion as a birth control technique doesn't either. A 40 plus woman should know better than to have a kid more risk for down syndrome. Oh and look what happened. The popularity of this liberian comes from VPILF status cause that's all the dumb men with there straight cocks dripping precum when they see her tired tail. 

As far as McCain and his war time experience.Didn't McCain get shot down multiple times, and then spend the majority of the Vietnam war in a camp? Kudos to him for surviving... that took grit... but let's not fool ourselves into thinking that he's some sort of talented soldier. He got shot down and captured. Not exactly an indication of a successful military experience. But it also brings up the issue of his Manchurian candidate possibilties. http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-06-27-McCain-endorsement_N.htm 
&nbsp; When you recieve and endorsement from the person who tortured you KUDOS. Your waiting for the Trigger word. What's he going to do keep our asses in IRAQ and various wars and bankrupt the fucking country. Yeah No THANKS TO THAT BRIDGE TO NO WHERE. This is my view. He lost in NAM and thinks that now America needs to win in every war. Wars on the correct countries can be won. Wars on Themes are political posturing. How many of us grew up during the war on drugs. Still didn't win that one.the war on terror sounds like a b rated Hollywood film. 

To my gays 

He doesn't believe you are valuable or talented enough to serve your country. 

He doesn't believe in granting equal status to your relationship. 

He doesn't believe in your right to adopt or protect your family.Unless it's in his war. 

For those gay that are republicans. 

He doesn't even WANT TO SEE YOU -- ask the Log Cabin Repubs. 

But he will take your money and use it to further oppress you once he's elected. 

I don't want you reform shit I want you to do your job and lead the country to prosperity so I can go back to school with minimal fuss and have more money in my pocket. For the past 8 years I've felt like a victim in my country held hostage by a bunch of bibles and slurred speech. I wouldn't want someone who is not going to fight for me or believes that I'm worth something running office I don't have a fortune yet. Give me the chance to earn mine. Your gonna pay taxes but I rather they before my future and someones future than someones wallet. We can't advance because our government is allowing our industry to leave. No tax breaks for OFF SHORE work forces. Advance our tech to superior status you can't do that with out funding. Stop letting Corporations run america. 

Get a McClue we don't want you 

No I don't want McCain polices with my order. 

It's a Palin Shame we are even having this discussion. 

Trust that black man for once. This is what giving us freedom was for. Obama can fix it."

1/2 dozen red rose buds
1/2 cup of slivered almonds
2 garlic cloves
2 tablespoons of butter
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons cornmeal
2 tablespoons anis

Chop the roses into small pieces and grind in blender with the almonds and garlic. Melt the butter and add honey. Stir the rose, garlic and almond mixture into the honey and butter. Add the cornmeal and anis. The mixture will be a thick paste. Use a spoon to spread onto the chicken. Bake the chicken as usual, basting if the coating gets too dry. The rose petals and anise will infuse the chicken with wonderful flavor.

Use additional rose buds or petals as a garnish when presenting the chicken."

The following was sent in response to an email I received from an aquitance.It's placed in Purple. Below is the actual text of the email. For some reason it struck a negative nerve with me today but my response surprised me as well. Hope you enjoy!

WAS THERE A REASON YOU SENT THIS TO ME? 
I'M HIV POSTIVE I FIGHT FOR MY LIFE EVERYDAY WITH THE HELP OF MAN MADE DRUGS THE LITTLE FAITH THAT I HAVE LEFT AND THE HELP OF DEVOTED TRUE FRIENDS. THIS LITTLE CHAIN MAIL LETTER IS NOT UP LIFTING IN ANY WAY. INFACT I'D ALMOST THINK THAT JESSE HELMS OR ONE OF THE OTHER RADICAL BAPTISTS OR EVANGELICALS MIGHT HAVE SENT THIS TO ME.
I'VE PRAYED TO GOD TO MAKE ME STRAIGHT WHEN IT MATTERED TO ME.
I'VE DANCED ON DEATHS DOOR STEP IN A DREAM OF SLEEP FOR 6 DAYS (COMA)
I'VE PRAYED TO GOD TO SEND ME SOMEONE WHO WOULD LOVE ME AND THAT I COULD LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY.
I'VE PRAYED FOR GOD TO HELP ME GET FINANCIALLY,MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY STABLE.
THE ONLY ANSWER I RECEIVED FROM THE HEAVENS OR HELL WAS THE FUCKER WHO GAVE ME HIV. (SATAN'S WORK)
THE TRUE FRIENDS(GOD'S WORK) WHO HAVE HELD MY HAND,CARRIED ME, PUSHED, CONSOLED,LOVED ME AND BLESSED ME WITH THE ONE THING I ALREADY STARTED WITH A SHORT SUPPLY OF ON THE DAY I WAS BORN.....TIME
BY SENDING ME THIS HORRID LITTLE CHAIN LETTER YOU HAVE WASTED MINE.
I HAVE A BIBLE AND A BRAIN. 
AND GO FUCKING FIGURE I CAN READ!
I DON'T NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT GOD OR JESUS LOVES ME 
NOR DO I NEED PISS POOR HAPPEN STANCE EXAMPLES OF HUMAN FRAILTY TO SCARE ME IN TO PRAYING.
EVERY DAY I WAKE UP UP IS A TESTEMENT TO GOD'S LOVE AND CONTINUED GRACE.

SO THE NEXT TIME YOU AS A FRIEND WANTS TO SEND SOMETHING
SEND A JOKE,SEND MONEY,SEND A HUGE THROBBING COCK FOR ME TO SUCK.
DON'T WASTED MY FUCKING TIME OR MAILBOX SPACE WITH SHIT LIKE THAT.

All I can think of is ""Akeim don't fuck this up. Akeim don't fuck this up. How can you be so stupid?"" But this isn't like my other relationships which amounted me heading down stream out towards the ocean against the current with a carrot dangling in my face and me chasing to get the juicy crisp goodness in my mouth. And yes for those friends out there who know me oh so very well I will allow you the Joke of Carrot being made of Flesh more like a flesh twinky. So ha ha I'm already with you on that one.

My mother doesn't think we will last until next August. ""I'm like MOM!"" She retorts ""He wants you there now. I think you'll be moving sooner."" We can talk on the phone about everything. The state of the Union,religious beliefs,entertainment and books. But the more we talk the more I'm throughly convinced the only way this relationship can end is if I fuck it up. Watched Weeds last night ON Demand how is it that you can forget about shows you like. I don't smoke but I love the show but stopped watching it. And then I discovered this:

you can tell
from the scars on my arms
and the cracks in my hips
and the dents in my car
and the blisters on my lips
that i'm not the carefullest of girls

you can tell
from the glass on the floor
and the strings that are breaking
and i keep on breaking more
and it looks like i am shaking
but it's just the temperature
but then again
if it were any colder i could disengage
if i were any older i would act my age
but i dont think that you'd believe me
it's not the way i'm meant to be
it's just the way the operation made me

and you can tell
from the state of my room
that they let me out too soon
and the pills that i ate
came a couple years too late
and ive got some issues to work through
there i go again
pretending to be you
make-believing
that i have a soul beneath the surface
trying to convince you
it was accidentally on purpose

i am not so serious
this passion is a plagerism
i might join your century
but only on a rare occasion
i was taken out
before the labor pains set in and now
behold the world's worst accident
i am the girl anachronism

and you can tell
by the red in my eyes
and the bruises on my thighs
and the knots in my hair
and the bathtub full of flies
that i'm not right now at all
there i go again
pretending that i'll fall
don't call the doctors
they've seen it all before
they'll say just let her crash and burn she'll learn
the attention just encourages her

and you can tell
from the full-body cast
that you're sorry that you asked
that you did everything you could
like any decent person would
but i might be catching so don't touch
you'll start believeing youre immune to gravity and stuff
don't get me wet
because the bandages will all come off

and you can tell
from the smoke at the stake
that the current state is critical
well it is the little things, for instance:
in the time it takes to break it she can make up ten excuses:
please excuse her for the day, its just the way the medication makes her...

i dont necessarily believe there is a cure for this
so i might join your century but only as a doubtful guest
i was too precarious removed as a caesarian
behold the worlds worst accident
I AM THE GIRL ANACHRONISM
I AM THE GIRL ANACHRONISM
I AM THE GIRL ANACHRONISM
I AM THE GIRL ANACHRONISM
i am the girl...
i am the girl...

So much is going on right now. I've had to deal with love, parents, death, joy, happiness and being lonely. Along with the other chorus of emotions all at once. I have a man his name is Bill Masters. He is wonderful man. He's older than me but around my older sisters age. So it's not like he's ancient. But he loves me. and he treats me wonderful. He pushes me to succeed helping me through school and other things. I stayed with him the past couple of days and he took me around Ft Lauderdale. We went to the Everglades and to the beach and shopping and he's romantic and a Pisces he's the 12th as you all know I'm the 7th. I get really calm when I'm around him. I can actually think and process information. But I know that I'm loved. And it scares me. For once someone I care about is returning my affection in all the ways that I have shown it to others and it's scary. I'm almost afraid something bad will happen. 

Just so that you all know how serious I am about this man. None of my boyfriends have met my mother or father. Let alone been to my parents house. Hell I can count how many of my friends have been to my parents house. He has been there twice. Once with me and once without and my mother thinks he's wonderful.

So that leads to the next bit. I'm moving away gang. Yes Yes moving away from the ville. I will more than likely be leaving Next January at the latest May 09.Why not sooner you ask ? because I have some personal issues that must be resolved here first. Namely my first semester of school must be completed. Second I'm not moving with out my own car.

Third we must see how things are going. I'm not moving down after knowing someone one for a such a short period of time to find out that we aren't compatiable. Although we are sickenly in love with each other. (When I got on the train to come home I was in tears) I'm in love and happy. Any man who drives 300 miles to and fro with in a 2 week period just to spend a little bit of time with you is a keeper. I feel safe when I'm in his arms. and OH god I sound like a giddy school girl.... Half you are trying not to vomit while reading this and the other half will be trying not to once you see us together.

But I'm ELATED"

"event","You know sometimes you forget to thank those you love for things.You forget to say I'm sorry or that your loved.You live in anger and fear and personal solitude because your just trying to make ends meet. Yet you forget about those who have helped you get there.I love Prince so...

Tonya.
  Years of silly jokes and shared moments and personal pain upon each other and our selves. Yet when I think of the sisters that God gave me not by blood but by fate.Your face is the face I see. When we were children giving me ability to not be afraid of myself and understand what I was looking at in the mirror. To love. To love me for all the foolish flaws I had and see that I would out grow some of them and to look past the ones I was still working on.Thank you from the Blood of my heart tainted as it is. Thank you for standing next to me. Pushing me when I couldn't push myself..Letting go to let me grow up and finding me in the dark when it was time to be found.You will always be my Wendy.

Kelly.
  Life Partner is a new meaning when it comes to you. Givig me confidence when I fall the shoulder to lean on when I can't stand on my own.Had I been straight would you have been that wife? Yes. In all you have stayed by me in my  shouting, loss of boyfriends,Dark depression, Heavy joy, Low income, Work, Rest and Play. Health issues. Fear, Creation of ideas, Focus and Rebirth.Thank you Kelly I can't say how thankful I am in a sentence. You just know.You will always be my Lisa as in Wendy and Lisa from Prince..Not that evil bitch we don't mention for fear it may invoke her spirit to appear and bring about the antichrist.

Mark Smith and Micheal Norman 
Yes you both. Who would think that a converstaion would bring friendship like yours. I miss those moments of just talking about any and everything. Coming up with ideas and working on them. Meeting you guys was the best and worst thing for me creatively..Why might you ask? For the rest of my life I will look to be as inspired as I was when we first started talking and then when we lived together. Those were some of the happiest times I've had since I was in Florida. If we didn't have so many people hanging on to all of us at that time I think would all would have published with in a 2 yr period. The future is still there though I look forward to it. No Drama lots of action.

Joe (Butch) Lemeke.
 My Older Brother.My confidant. Through all your steady voice in my head that if I can keep a path I can accomplish anything. Headstrong and stubborn. Yet loving and faithful as a friend.The pinnicale of stick to it. Even when knocked down you get up swinging. You give more than you too will ever know

Adrian.
 There is only one. You may never read this because you don't have a live journal account but I place it anyway. I love you as the twin Brother I wasn't blessed with at Birth, who accepts me beyond color. Beyond everything that moves and shapes the universe. My constant friend. The only male I can trust with everything. Hell the only Male my parents even trust. You are the male friend I never have to worry about a being betrayed if I share my feelings too. You understand comics and great cinema. Most of all you get me. Without having to try. You get into my mind like Kelly does which scares me but I love you Adrian.

Sketch,Robin,Sylvia,Kirk.Kim,Fjord,Angie,Krystalle,You each have kept me safe and sane in ways that most people would be like what the F!
 I thank god for blessing me with friends like you all."

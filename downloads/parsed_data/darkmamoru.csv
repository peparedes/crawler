I wouldn't trade Aaron for nothin' hes cool and he makes me feel good.  i seriously think i could spend the rest of my life with someone like him. he cheers me up when i am down and all that other stuff.I have emotional support hes not like mike and i can't show him affection. hes not like carrie callin me stupid. and he sure does make me feel good about myself which being manic depressive thats not alot of the time. Diane is okay... I hope its love like diane found. permanent. I don't want aaron to ever leave my side. Finally i am stable and i have a good relationship and hopefully. Heh an old girl friend just signed on. funny how i've only had two. mary and that crazy slut carrie who likes to call people names.... oh well i don't need carrie and i definatly don't hold grudges anymore. theres nothing but love in my heart thanks to aaron and i'm giving myself to the world step by step."

I like seeing him happy and this ain't a way for me to  see my friends. but i am worrying about him more than most of them... oh well. :-\ i just hope luna-chan will be ok... I'd give him the world and hes only a friend... probably says alot about whats going on inside though..."

"event","why do i feel like michael hates me now. dunno... hes acting slightly different. but i'm pulling away like i said i would. Lea always says get out of a relationship before you get hurt. well thats what I'm doing... cause men are weird... especially leos.  though micheals a great person.... for a leo. he still has trouble relating to people. thats going to hold him back from alot... and i wish i was able to tell him how much i hurt inside right now and hes not really helping with this strange behavior but if i said anything about it now it would be coming from my hateful scorpio side that likes to jab and jab until the target is destroyed. and i don't want to fight anymore. so I feel like shit. isn't that what i am after all?"

"event","i just finished orientation work... sitting here dreaming about whoever would be my perfect prince charming.... whenever he comes along tell me! gaah at least i can feel my arms again. i just wish things with michael would work out. I don't think i've fallen for him but I do want to give things a shot before i loose my chance. I just don't get why he can be romantic and I can't. I mean i'm being careful what I say because damien basically told me what flaws i had in that relationship and i am now trying to improve them but i don't know. its just weird. I can't understand why he can be so romantic but i get yelled at for it. I mean I am holding my tounge at this point because if i say something the way I am feeling it will be in effective while i am pissed like this.... Oh well. I'll just cry. That and writing is the only way I can get this out right now. I want to be the maiden and have my prince charming. sux I know but what am I to do. I can't just yell at him. its not his fault and i know he doesn't mean to hurt me. hes just odd like that sometimes. why must i always like leos..."

Well another day another man! Hey I'm trying to get this one guy but hes getting all weird and pulling away. I didn't say I was necessarily gaga over him. I'm just well very into my work. But hey if hes the right one I'll get him. I'm no fool though. Life isn't about sex or looks for me. I just want the simple man. Wonder when hes going to realize that and stop pulling away."

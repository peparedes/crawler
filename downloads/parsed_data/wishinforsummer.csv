"event","agh. i haven't updated in awhile. so lifes been kinda icky. i dunno. i did that salting thing and it's so disguisting i hate it so much. i look at it and i'm like EW. thats ugly. i pray it goes away soon, very soon at that. i HATE HATE HATE it. very much. i wanna tell mom, but how? what would i say? i dunno anymore. its like it's all going downward once again. but oh well. i talked to matt the other day, felt good to let my feelings out to a guy that actually understood. thats the one great thing about him, he understands and i don't confuse him too much. 

so i've been thinking. wouldn't life be better if people stopped pretending? stop pretending to be happy when their really sad, stop pretending to like someone you hate. stop pretending to be somebody you're not. if i learned one thing this year its who i am. in the past i didn't know who i was or what i liked, but i finally figured it out. i know who i am and i know what matters to me and what doesn't. people need to take time to figure themselves out and stop being so fake. 

hmm nothing else to ramble about... prolly will tommorow. or maybe later tonight. 

*much love*

ooh yeah. got new stuff today with evie. yay. no spanish! it was classic."

today- aggh. the formal. i guess i should be super very excited but i'm not really that excited about it. not even sure i want to be there. i don't wanna be all dressed up and pretty. cause even if i look pretty i still won't feel pretty and it'll make me sad. but kelly amanda markie and mitchell will be there. hope it's fun. i just have this weird feeling about it. which isn't good. but oh well. 

me and jara were talking today. and boys they just want sex. they never want the girl that loves them. and they are never happy enough. goodness. i'm trying hard to be enough for you mitchell. i hope i don't dissapoint you. 

i need to stop listening to burn. it's the i was listening to when me and matt broke up and the song mitchell asked me out to. HOPEFULLY it won't be the song mitchell and me break up to, if we break up. i really hope we don't. :( 

done with all this for now. maybe after the formal or on Sunday? who knows.. love you guys who care about me."

"event","okay. so i do cut. i do it too get away. it helps me ease my pain. and i know all of you have a problem with it. i do too. but it's just something i DO. and i'm sorry. no i'm not psyco cause i cut. there's just so many things none of you know about me. you people are so fucking quick to judge. you don't understand and you never will. so just let me live my life its my body my scars my mistakes. let me deal. 

love. agh. is it really worth it? you know you mean everything to me. and i hope this little situation we are in doesn't end us. because you know you make me happy and i feel like we've got something. it's like i'm giving you everything and you don't even know how much i need you. i just wish i could tell you everything on my mind but i don't think you'd understand. i know i'm not the perfect girlfriend and i mess up. but i know that i love you more then any other girl you'll ever have. and i'm gonna try my hardest to make you happy. i'm sorry i'm not perfect. i'm sorry i mess up. but you and i both know i'm not perfect. because nobody is. but baby, you are my heart. and i love you. may seem hard to believe. but it's true. 

okay. so today i was walking home from the bus stop. and i looked down at my wrist. and mark you are right. it's ugly and i can't look at it and be happy. looking down at my wrist and seeing all those cuts and scars makes me feel so ugly and unwanted. i wish they weren't there. it's just a reminder of everything. it hurts. i'm tired of hurting. agh. i'm so worthless and ugly. on the inside and the outside.

thats it for now. maybe more when i can see better. damn tears. 

Is there anything worth looking for? Worth loving for? Worth lying for? Is there anything worth waiting for? Worth living for? Worth dying for?"

today- agh today. i cried. agh! crying does ease the pain. but i hate crying infront of people because everyones like WHATS WRONG... and its annoying. first off.. if somethings wrong and you don't usually talk or care about me then why the fuck are you gonna come talk to me when i'm crying? i seriously hate that. it's like oh she's upset lets find out whats wrong. i'm so tired of people faking. if you don't care, don't act like you do. 

okay. simple as this - i love mitchell. it may not be so called ""real"" love but what is ""real"" love anyway? i don't want anybody else. not logan, not bryan, not dylan, not matt. not anybody but HIM. just want to make that clear. i don't know why i like mitchell so much i just do. it's crazy, but then again love IS crazy.

"event","okay listen up you fucking faggots that can't accept that i'm HAPPY with Mitchell. keep talking the shit, keep thinking its doing something because you know what it's not doing anything. it's just giving me more reasons to be with him. and you know what? no matter how fucking HARD you try i will not listen to the shit your saying. because thats stupid. so many relationships get ruined over stupid shit like that. and i'm not gonna let it happen. so STOP fucking trying. stop saying he pops boners off guys, stop saying he's gay, stop saying EVERYTHING its fucking STUPID and IMMATURE. i'm just so fucking sick of it. 

cause we lost it all
and nothing last forever
i'm sorry i can't be perfect
now it's just too late
and we can't go back
i'm sorry i can't be perfect

"event","we all make mistakes. i simply hate myself for the mistakes i've made in the past. i wish i could forget everything and just live for the moment. but thats just not me. i remember every stupid little thing i've done wrong. i hate it. i hate the fact that i don't love myself because i wish so much that i could accept who i am. maybe one day i'll learn to. but until i do i've got to keep myself under control and not do stupid things. scars aren't beautiful, i hate my scars. everytime i look at them i'm reminded of all the times i hated myself, of all the mistakes i've made. i'm stupid. stupid for hurting myself, stupid for thinking nobody cares about me. thank you to everyone who gets mad at me when i cut, thank you to everyone who gives a damn about me. and i'm sorry. sorry for being me, sorry for not thinking about ya'll while i'm hurting myself. thank you for not ever giving up on me and one day i'll learn to not give up on myself too."

"event","""Real life ain't no fairy, I just thought you should know."" -Yellowcard


I've accepted that we can't be, but I've also accepted that you're going to be that one person I carry with me for the rest of my life, the one that I always going to make my heart jump a little and my stomach tie up in knots no matter how happy I am otherwise and no matter how long it's been. The one I will always secretly wish had asked me to the dance even though I am more than happy with the guy that did. Do you realize how incredibly difficult it is to accept both those things at once? It's a completely torturous situation if you stop and think about it.

You're so hard to talk to. You mean the world to me, but I don't know how to say it and to actually get a response from you."

And you start to remember the pain. And that hollow space is feeling more and more like the Grand Canyon with every second that goes by. But you bury these feelings deep down, so deep that you're sure no one will be able to tell. To the outside world, you smile and act like nothing is wrong. Everything's just perfect. For that split second that you've locked eyes, a tiny whisper says 'make this last forever, only and just this moment forever and ever'. But after a second or so, you go along your own merry way, all the while realizing how much you do miss him, how much you still love him...and it sticks with you for days, weeks, maybe months, until fate decides to hand you another one of those unexpected moments. <EM>And then you finally understand the worst feeling in the world is when the person you love most is standing right next to you, yet you can never have them</EM>. <FONT size=3>Try as you may, you can't make someone love you.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P></SPAN>"

"event","Suicide isn't the answer to your problems


Ask the 25-year-old who tried to electricute himself. He lived. But both his arms are gone.


What about jumping? Ask John. He used to be intelligent, with an engaging sense of humor. That was before he leapt from a building. Now, he's brain-damaged and will always need care. He staggers and has seizures. He lives in a fog. But, worst of all, he KNOWS he used to be normal.


What about pills? Ask the 12-year-old with extensive liver damage from an overdose. Have you ever seen anyone die of liver damage? You turn yellow. It's a hard way to go.


What about a gun? Ask the 24-year-old who shot himself in the head. Now he drags one leg, has a useless arm and has no vision or hearing on one side. He lived through his ""foolproof"" suicide. You might too.


But... Who will clean your blood off the carpet or scrape your brains from the ceiling? Commercial cleaning companies may refuse that job--but SOMEONE has to do it.


Who will have to cut you down from where you hung yourself or identify your bloated body after you've drowned? Your father? Your mother? Your wife? Your son?


The carefully worded ""loving"" suicide note is of no help. Those who loved you will NEVER completely recover. They'll feel regret and an unending pain.


Suicide is contagious. Look around your family. Look closely at the 4 year old playing with his cars on the rug. Kill yourself tonight, and he may do it ten years from now.


You DO have other choices. There are people who can help you through this crisis. Call a hotline. Call a friend. Call your minister or priest. Call a doctor or hospital. Call the police. They will tell you that there's hope. Maybe you'll find it in the mail tomorrow. Or in a phone call this weekend. But what you're seeking could be just a minute, a month, or a day away.


You say you don't want to be stopped? Still want to do it? -Well, then, I may see you in the psychiatric ward later. And we'll work with whatever you have left.


Remember: Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."

No more wishing you'd call or wishing i'd drive by your road or your work and see your truck. I will not allow you take over me again like you did last summer. You won't take advantage of my poor innocent heart, again. cause i know if i let you take advantage of it you'll just end up fucking me up like you always do. Agh- you're nothing but trouble, but you've got looks that could kill so everyone sees past the REAL you. i'm glad i now know the REAL you. the one that makes girls fall for him without intention of catching them. I want so badly to say i hate you but i know that i'd be lying. it's okay though.. haven't you heard i'm gonna be okay? --...dedicated... and don't think i love this person or wanna be with them cause that's not the case at all... just started writing and that's what came out. so don't go and get the wrong ideas...

<BR>A guy out there was meant to be the love of your life, your best friend, your soul mate, the one you can tell your dreams to. He'll smile at you, but he'll never laugh at your heart. He'll brush the hair out of your eyes. Send you flowers when you least expect it. He'll stare at you during the movies, even though he paid $8 to see it. He'll call to say goodnight or just cause he is thinkin of you. He'll look in your eyes and tell you, you're the most beautiful girl in the world, and for the first time in your life, you'll believe it.

"event","this is about me i don't care what anyone thinks when they read this but it's everything inside of me coming out and if you don't have any desire to read it then click the x and roll out. 
<BR> i don't exactly think i'm depressed i just KNOW that everytime i get happy i end up sad, worrying, and lonely in about 2 weeks. i worry about everything constantly i hate myself because of it. i'm more than happy with matt but i just find myself worrying that i'm not good enough-he doesn't want me.. he's using me. i guess it's because i've been so used by *unmentioned name..* (some of you may know who i'm talking about) but that was the past and if it didn't last in the past then there's a reason it didn't make it to your future right? i guess its just i'm afraid to be really in love cause everytime you get so in love they leave. i don't wanna be left i need someone to stay with me. but you never know if someone loves you for you or if they love you for the stuff that comes with relationships (kisses, sex..ect.) all i know is that i want to love matt so badly, and i think i do love him to some extent.. i just hope it's real and i hope it last. 
<BR> so my toe situtation thing... can't run- joy! get to go to practice and walk around the hole time.. so much fun- yea right. but it hurts. oh well what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. 
<BR> My dear beloved rat died today.. i came home from track and eating with my brother and walked into my room then looked on my dresser to check on her and she's there --dead-- okay.. that was horrible for me i screamed. i only had like a month with her and i miss him she was the sweetest most lovable rat ever. amanda is going to be terribly upset when she hears the news. i can't handle life anymore. it's too much for me. 
<BR> uncle has a new girlfriend.. well they've been together awhile but of course i just found out. she's pregant...due in the next 2 weeks sometimes. she's having a babygirl.. and i get to babysit when they wanna go out. FUN! i like his girlfriend, Chrystal though shes nice and easy to talk to, i hope it works between them. 
<BR> this is for Manda, Matt, and Mom..
<BR> Manda-you've been there for me so much this year and i dunno what i'd do without you to talk to bout' everything (specially you know) haha too many good times and i know there's gonna be too many more to come. good luck with bobby(lmbo) i love ya my bestest friend! 
<BR> Matt- you kinda pulled me together and made me happy again and i just love you. i'm the happiest person ever when i'm with you i can't even explain it. you're wonderful. and i hope things with us stay wonderful because i need you in my life. you helped me forget about the one person i needed to forget. thank you for loving me. i love you huggy! 
<BR> My Mother- my shoulder to cry on, my reality check, my support, my everything i love you mom. you're truly amazing and i dunno what i'd do without you. you hold me up when i need it and you let me learn things the hard way. there's no other person in the world that i'd want as my mom then you. you are so beautiful-inside and out- there's nobody i know as great as you. thanks for being there to listen to everything and understanding me. thanks for the advice even though half the time i don't use it. thanks for it all mom, i love you more then life, and if you ever died i would die to."

"event","okay so our first REAL track meet tommorow.. go us i hope we win! my toe hurts so bad though i need to go to the trainer really bad. 
<BR>
so i've been thinking a lot about love & life. and it's crazy how things work. how you can meet someone and think they're the one.. but in the end you end up hating them. i hope thats not how it all goes down. but sometimes no matter how hard you want it to work it just doesn't. and life.. ups and downs and then up then right back down again.. why can't everything always be good? it's not fair sometimes... but oh well. i guess what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. this year has had too many downs and when i finally get an UP i get worried. i wish i could just stop worrying about everything and think it's all gonna be okay for once. because it is gonna be okay if i want it to be. i think that you're mind decides if you're okay and if you're not okay. from now on i'm going to try to look on the brighter side of things... instead of thinking i'm going to lose him i'm going to think he'll be mine forever. instead of thinking i'm going to lose a race i'm going to go out there and KNOW i'm going to zoom by everyone out there. maybe if i have a better attitude about life, then life will start treating me better. 
<BR> when the minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like minutes and the week goes by you know it takes my breathe away.. all the minutes could never take you're place.. <-- wow.. that song makes me think. it's great. can't wait till i see you again Matt! i love you... i know that sounds crazy but i do. it happened way too fast but i can't help it.. i love you."

"event","No one has ever told me to eat shit and die and for that fact no one has ever told me to ""put on the lights, we're not living in the 80's anymore""

American comediene Erma Bombeck said that when a child reaches its teens, its parents become as interesting as kitchen utilities. I can picture it now. A kid comes home and looks its parent straight in the eye and asks: ""Any one home?""

Teens have an impecable sense of irony and their bodily functions seem to slow down. During the summer they tend to get up at around noon, if then. They then transfer their body to the ""breakfast"" table (upper body first, then lower body) and tend to show verry weak signs of life. 

You will never know if they are hungry or not. Hunger is not up to them to decide.

You have to give teenagers time to adjust. They are moving to adult hood and they can be confused, or even scared heaven forbid; their theology teachers may have told them on the brink of summer holiday's that he/she is saving him/herself for Jesus and is living a life of celibacy. 

You don't get over something like that too quick.

Teenagers tend to live an ""OK-Life"". Most of the things they experience to be 'OK'or then the extreme 'it's OK'

When an anemic teenager gives a presentation infront of a class and everyone else has to mark it the teacher is pretty much guaranteed 28 'it was OK' reports. Teenagers are always 'OK'- if it is absolutelly necessary to answer to such a question. 

And there will always be morons asking.

Puberty is a phase when the comings and goings of adults are insignificant. This is easily detected from the over use and emphasis on vowels in their speech. The 'Teensound': sounds pathetic and dispicable ""-Doooon't staaaart!"" Breaks your heart doesn't it? You can already imagine your young child saying that to you in few years time.

There is only one cure for this disease: time. It is abundantly clear that with time the teens legs will shrink to the size of the french fries they eat and their mouth's form to the shape of Salami Pizza's or Big Macs. Their ear's will stretch so that the biggest head phones will fit into them. Their thumbs will double in size and switch places. 

The teens are not laughing.

""Am I bovered? speak to the hand""

If they're not 'bovered' then they genuinely are not interested. All you can do is shout out OMG (or Oh my God, to those who still speak properly) or LOL (laugh out loud) and try and agree that the teens' black T-shirt that says Violent Femmes is pretty cool.

""It's a band you moron! I ain't bovered!"""

"event","Does alcohol kill sex?
 
Having sex, or making love, whilst drunk can be as erotic as the hangover that awaits you next morning!
 
Remember those days at the beginning of a relationship when you're giddy and getting down with it frightens the both of you?
Is it worth getting over the edginess by having a few pints, glasses of wine or a mixture of esoteric cocktails? Alcohol is known for bringing out lust but strips away the ability! 
 
In some cases alcohol can relax and reduce the nervousness, but the great majority will not enjoy their experience. Human behaviour is hard to controll and predict whilst the alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream  and the state of drunkenness settles in. Alcohol does not liberate or relax, it agitates and in this case arouses. As an end result from a chemical reaction negative feelings such as jeallousy and violence abrubtly enter the mind of a human.
 
In men alcohol has imparing effects in the genital area. The more alcohol is consumed into the blood stream of a man, the more aroused and 'horny' the subject will be. In worst case scenarios a man deprived of his manlyhood by alcohol will think that they are impotent when the simple reason for this is caused by the body numbing effects of alcohol. 
 
Hence why drunken states are known as the most common cause for impotence.
 
Women on the other-hand call drunken sexual episodes with the affectionate ""aneasthetics sex"": You are still awake enough, to go through with the act, but the better half of the body is numb. Everyone, I am sure, can imagine how good that must feel.  
 
Women do not suffer from the effects of alcohol as detramentally as men do: Women can enjoy sex more than men do when they have consumed small amounts of alcohol. Though this is often only known as ""disposaple drunkeness"". When alcohol consumption comes more frequent and common in women, it will cause serious health problems such as period problems. And when anyone, men and women alike, are drunk they will think that they are the hottest thing in their respective postal district and will sway in the dance floor like Jennifer Lopez. Too bad the sexy part of this swaying is in the subject's own head.
 
Summer time is the worst for sex and alcohol. People are drawn to festivals, beer gardens and night clubs to find company in severe states of drunkenness. Alcohol is, in extreme cases, a leathal part of one night stands. People often forget contraception as the mind is impaired due to the poison flowing through it. Statistics will prove that summer sees the most unwanted pregnancies and abortions and festivals spread some goers with nasty seven year itches.
 
When any person is drunk at some of the situations listed above it is often easy to be sexually abused or be taken advantage of.
 
The moral of all this is: Enjoy sex with some one you love, without alcohol. Sex is alot better when you're sober. Infact: Why drink at all?"

To me, my immediate living family is the most important foundation of all. My parents and my brother are pilars which I rely on and I feel that I have taken so much from them and to give back the only thing that I can do is to try and ensure that no one crosses them.

I would go to such lenghts to protect the 'honour' of my family as to kill some one who has in any shape or form harmed my foundations.

"event","I'm not sure how many of the international readers (if any) are aware of the Terror arrests made in Lodnon recently. If you're not familiar then here's a quick low down. 250 officers raid a house in south east London and shoot one of the alledged suspects. Ofcourse police said they had credible information that was to be followed up!

It's now been 2-3 weeks that this took place and we are in the midst of something that resembles the Menedzes case (sorry if I spelled the name incorrectly). 

The gungho spirit of the anti terror police is unacceptable! Sure they may have had credible evidence that required following up, but doing it with the scale they did this in. 250 men to go in and they arrest two and abuse a woman and her child and a clerick. I thought that it was ironic when I saw the two they arrested (out of which one got shot). They were what the media would portray as 'terrorist' as per their appearance. Both had long bushy beards, had the right complexion of skin and they were muslim. Just what the media has taught us to believe. And I would be as brave as to argue that media has branded  whole faith of Islam as terrorism. Sure there was the select few who went a bit OTT with the Muhammad cartoon, but this is not to condemn the whole religion and the people as uneducated bunch of goons that want to do nothing but cause death and destruction. 

The whole war on terror is so intertwined with itself that its something that we should all try and forget, because by all right and degree we are all terrorists. We might not do anything in the scale of 9-11 (USA and Spain) or 7-7 (london). The war on terror does nothing more but breeds more terror. It's the oppression and the 'world police' that act as the catalyst in already volitile environment. What we need to do is try and enforce diplomacy instead of lead and blood."

"event","A lot of things have been pissing me off latelly and instead of hissing about it in my mind I thought that I would start to use this as an outlet for things to come and post hilarity on these here pages again. I might be even changing my journal to something more appropriate and mature, and leave this nick name operating as the Blog of a amateur hockey player. Granted my updates of late have been far apart but hey, this is something that has been forseen. I just simply don't have the time in my life at the moment to update a blog. I'm sorry but I have more important matters in my life right now than the internet. These things include my career which is about to get a new boost, my love life, and life in general.

However the reason for my enragement is largely part of the youth culture/""alternative"" media. Alternative media as in magazines like Metal Hammer, Kerrang, Rocksound, Metal Edge and so forth. In particular there is one, well maybe 2 bands that really have tipped the scale for me, with these bands I've gotten increasingly pissed off about their respective labels, or former punk/hardcore labels in general and how badly they have sold out!

Largely this pissiness was kicked off by a band called Trivium! and I know by writing this I am giving them free publicity, but fuck it, they deserve to be lambasted and ridiculed because, despite what the critics say, they are nothing more than a mediocre band and will never have an impact on the scene. They are a bunch of 19 year old rich kids trying to satisfy their own egos and live the bullshit sex, drugs and Rock and Roll life! It's the fact that they pose as a hardcore band even though they are as farm from hardcore as Busted would be. They are nothing more than a fad that will not leave a mark on the music map as the likes of Led Zeppelin, Sabbath, The Clash, Minor Threat etc have done.

What ticks me off in relation to Trivium is that they bring in this horde of idiot fucking teenagers to the scene that proclaim to be hardcore though they are not! Fuck they are just as far from hardcore as the band them selves. Their attitudes towards the whole scene is just the one that they read from the mags that subsequently have sold them the image that they must abide to. Fuck I blame solely Kerrang! for the infentessible amount of teenie bobbers we see on fucking high street! If you are an ""alternative"" or listen to metal, punk, hardcore, goth etc. High street is the last god damn place that you should be at! Punk my ass! The whole attitude of punk rock is flushed down the toilet the moment you purchase a fashion accessory from Claire's Accessories or any damn shop fashion shop. In my opinion you do not sport your latest edition of Atticus or Dickies to prove that you are punk rock! It's not a fucking trend it's a life style and a state of mind. Nu-Metal was a trend with its hordes of Limp Bizkit, Korn and Linkin Park followers who just had to look like their fucking idols! This is where we get to my other pet hate called Bullet For My Valentine! 

BFMV are nothing but another metallica wannabe band! What bothers me most about BFMV are their boybandish good looks and their incessant obsession over trendy clothing, much like Eighteen Vision (wait untill I get to the labels). I'm not sure what BFMV has sold more or helped sell more: Their own albums or Famous Stars and Straps clothing! I think the latter is more approriate to them, because the only thing I've ever seen them wear when I first started to hear about this band was FS&S. Well fuck it, KoRn Had Adidas (and later whored themselves to Puma) Limp Bizkit, or should I say Fred Durst, had NY caps (I think the NY caps have been sold more than LB albums) and Linkin Park had... well they never really had anything! Why the fuck do bands who are supposed to stand for ""anti this"" ""anti that"" go and whore them selves to these clothing companies? I guess some bright eyed marketing star at Famous realised that no one would buy their shit so they decided to flog it to the rejects and in BFMV they found their knights in shiny armour! 4 pretty welsh boys who wanted to ""change the face of metal"" ended up being produced to radio and teen friendly metal! Fuck them and the horse they rode in on! And Fuck Matt Tuck! You Cheap Robb Flynn wannabe!

On labels then? Shit let's take Victory Records. Now before I start on them I must say that I quite like some of the artists on Victory, mainly Comeback Kid, Martyr A.D, Waterdown, Darkest Hour, Bury your Dead and Atreyu (except for their Curse album... fucking vampires my shiny arse hole). Victory used to be known as this ""tough guy"" label back in the 90's and sported some formidable hardcore bands, but now they have opted for something completelly different and shite! Their Bulldog logo has damn tears coming out its eyes with bands like Hawthorne Heights, Aiden, The Black Maria, and the newly reformed a perfect Murder (who I liked before they went shite). I can't understand why people want to sell their souls for a bit of the green! I mean I would support having the fore mentioned radiofriendly acts on the bill if it went towards supporting the bands that the label was set up for, but have we heard anything from Freya after they released As the Last light Drains? (Ok they did the split with Hoods I give them that). 

Same goes to Trustkill, eventhough they have more bands that I actually like and few more to boot, but it's the likes of Fight Paris, Crash Romeo etc that kinda ruin the whole thing for them. Much for the same reasons as Victory so I'm not going to start ranting about them excessively.

Third would be Roadrunner! Fuck can I say about them? They canned Vision Of Disorder in favor of Slipknot because they were bringing in more green than anyother band out there. Plus they also axed Glassjaw... This label is the epitome of everything that is wrong with the ""alternative scene"" of today! I think that their flagship band pretty much says it all of the label: A bunch of redneck clowns sucking the fat end of the money cock!

What else then? I think that is pretty much it on the music front. I guess in between these lines is hidden the reason why I gave up on the alternative media, mostly because it was crap but for the sole reason of the aggressive sales tactics hidden in the message they were trying to convey. 

Shit I find it more usefull browsing myspace for example to find new exciting bands who are all about the music and none of the bullshit attitude that many of the contemproraries featured in monthly and weekly publications. 

It is these bands that I have added as my friends (sad yes I know) on myspace and keep listening to their tracks on line. Too bad I keep coming across too many great bands and I can't afford to get all of their CD's"

0515: Wake up and preparation (shower, breakfast, stretches, mental preparation)

0645: Pick up Pekka (our Goalie)

0700: Meet the team at the university. Half the team was a good half hour late, except for James.

0730: Departure for Bisley

0825: Arrive at Bisley, kit up general banter with the team and getting everyone focused. 

0845: Warm up

0900: Face off against Team Demolition. At our first meet with this team they beat us with a coarse 12-2 rape. This match was more evenly played with us losing the match only 2-3. A bit gutting for me as I had the chance to equalize the match at the end but I put the puck past an open net.

0945: Game end. rest and recover: We made good use of the free rink that we had because the match in between ours was cancelled so we were passing and shooting the puck around. 

1050: Face off against Team Voltage: We never have beaten voltage, but always put up good shows against them. They came at us hard, but so did we. We were determined to get the first goal and that's what we did when Adam hit the puck home. From there on I hit it home to make it 2-0 and then Adam and Alex were running up the score. By the final five minutes of the match our lead was 5-2 but Voltage kept coming hard at us and ran up our lead from 5-2 to 6-5. We managed to hold it to the end and came off as the winners. Team Voltage and Demolition are one of the top teams in the division, which lead me to believe that we do stand a fighting chance till the end of the season. We have 5 matches left and we can take every match if we please.

1200-1420: Stuck in traffic (i'm only guessing the times becasue I don't remember them exactly) the whole standstill was quite amusing and we walked off with some loot. Quick lunch at Fleet services. Drop off Pekka.

1430: Meet at Southampton uni for BRHA match against Crusaders

16:00: Match at applemore against crusaders. Final score 16-2. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. Got a goal but that's a cheap comfort

1830: Home, pick up ice hockey kit and put roller kit to dry. Lie on the bed for 1 minute. And off I went

1900: Pick up Goalie again

1915: Meet Soton uni and head to Gosport

2030: Face off against Cambridge. They had unpenetrable defence and we lost the match 1-6. We were in the match untill the start of the third period and we had the brilliant idea of switching goalies. All respect to Pekka, but we should've kept Julian in goal for the whole game as he was playing far better and Pekka was cold and did not know what was facing him. 

I was surprised that I still had so much energy in my legs that I could do sprints and still somewhat stay in the game. 

23:00 Home Atlast!!!!! Get up the stairs and put kit to dry

23:30: To bed

 

During this day I drove over 200 miles just for hockey and played 4 matches nearly without any rest or stopping for a propper break. 

13.02.2006:

"event","Note:
My updates have and will be few and far between. The reason is that my wireless network adapter broke and the new one I got well fucked up my computer. It is now at Fujitsu HQ being fixed from a Restart loop. Hopefully I did not lose everything as I had some very important stuff on the hard drive (such as my freelance design business I started to run)

I went to see one of my favorite bands (Bleeding Through) play an amazing gig at Portsmouth just a few days ago. The gig itself was brutal, close knitted, energetic hardcore show to all its extent. Well maybe for the opening acts: Bring me The Horizon, who sounded like a pack of Wild silver back Gorillas in heat. Seriously the only words that I could comprehend in the songs were ""C'mon you pussy ass motherfuckers"" and ""medusa"" I think Medusa was a song title of a sort and Pussy ass mothertrucker to aggravate the audience, or a showing of poor song writing. Shees if that's the case talk about lack of ideas. 
The other opener Hondo Mclean were Okish. My main problem with this band is that they try to be Funeral For A Friend, hardcore, emo, mathcore and Incubus all at the same time. Kinda puts you off, but they put on an energetic live show none the less.


My real sigh of jealousy how ever came a few days after the show and when I was looking at the pictures I took at the show. I realised that nearly all the band members in Bleeding Through are same age or few years older than me. Heck Me and Britney spears are separated by 15 days in age, a few million dollars in the bank and a pair of fake boobs! Oh yeah and the kid thing. She also has a kid... As dumb as it may seem this made me reflect upon my self! What have I achieved in the 24 years of life (out of which I've spent 30% according to a quiz). I realized that I haven't achieved that much and that I am not where I wanted to be in life. I am not saying that I would want to be super famous, because lets face it I don't have the looks for it nor do I have the talent to act or sing! But still these people in their mid twenties or early twenties have taken such a risk and put everything that they had and put it all into what they believed in and now they are doing what they love day in day out!

What am I doing then? I work in a dead end job which I hate. I drive in every morning wishing that I would be greeted by smoking pile of ash rising from the remains of the building I have now become to despise.
So what would I want to be? I always wanted to play hockey full time and I pretty much occupy my spare time on skates (right now I still have about 40 matches to play till the end of the season). The other fact is that I have seriously messed up my back which might prevent me from playing at all in a few years. 

I know the area that I want to work in (marketing), because I thoroughly enjoy doing it. I am interested in the consuming behaviour of people and how different messaging influences us. True enough I would never market a product which I did not believe in. But I did not expect to end up in a job like this. 

When I joined the company I was under the impression that there would be scope for progression and it was a great opportunity for a graduate looking for a career in marketing, but right now as it is I feel that it was a huge mistake to join up because I feel that the experience I have gained is not going to help me to move on and I feel so stuck. It's like being in a corner and a there's a 1000 guns being pointed at me. 

I have come to realise that this is my life and it's ticking away one minute at a time and I must act to make things happen. Unfortunately I'm not ballsy enough to tell people to go F-themselves and leave as I'd have nothing to fall back on. I have to wait untill opportunities arise.

On the other hand I have already taken steps towards that. I started my own freelance desing and marketing ""consultancy"". I am now building a brand image for the Southampton Spitfires Ice and Inline Hockey club, Marketing a book by James P Vidar as well as creating the cover for the UK edition of the book, Designed the poster for Tenderden Arts festival. I work on this completely on non profit basis and sadly this operation was put on hold as I lost my computer for a while!

One thing that I always wanted is something I now have: a loving girlfriend, well fiance really. Its m base and my foundation. Without her I would be lost. so utterly lost"

"event","I'm just sick and tired of these ""industry"" standards of what's cool and what is actually, and rightfully heralded as a good piece of work.
I don't care whether the piece of work in question is a film, book, album, painting or a doodle because hey: My degree is in doodling! 
 
Firstly I was enraged by the comments in a recent advertisement that proudly proclaimed that Star Wars episode 3 was ""a modern classic"" and 
a ""masterpiece""! I can agree with the said statements only if you look at them from this perspective: Star Wars 3 is a classic in the sense that George Lucas proved that he has the power of making an absolute shite film and still gross millions upon millions from it, because let's face it: People who liked that film, and I do mean honestly liked that film, are stupid. These are people who go to comic book fairs dressed as Obi Wan or some odd Klingon horde. 
 
Why do I think Star Wars 3 and the whole saga produced nothing good except Harrison Ford? 
The acting and dialogue in Star Wars 3 and in the newer ones is atrocity to the whole gentle art of acting, but some blame has to be put on the director as well: How can you expect the actors to pull of stunning roles when you are focused on the latest eye-lash rendering technologies. There is a fight part in episode 3 which proves the point of poor production and acting et al. I can't remember who was fighting or why, I didn't honestly care. But there's a metal ramp that falls on one of the main characters and you can clearly see when the picture changes from the live actors to a miniature model. Hell I can even count a full half second when that transition is made. I do honestly mean that the film stops it's flow to focus on this Thunderbird like effect. 
 
I do not mean to insult people who think that the greatest past time on the planet is to mimic Darth Vader or Yoda. Heaven forbid I stared at a person playing chess for 1.5 hours while I was waiting for my girlfriend to get ready in their Maths common room. I couldn't help to think that ""My god! I am the coolest person in the whole damn building""
 
Enough of Star Wars though. I think we can all agree that they are horrible films with their pissy rodent evoks in the final film! I mean honestly WHAT THE HELL DID THEY EVER DO EXCEPT LOOK FLUFFY?!?! 
 
It's this type of stupidity that enrages me. When people eat shit off the spoon and say it is good because the predecessors of things were slightly sugar coated. I can tell you in all honesty that I have fallen for these ploys as well. I think that my personal, and I must stress now lamented admiration of Slipknot serves the purpose. I absolutely loved their first album and when they released that horrendous second album I ate the shit thinking that it is THE best thing on the planet. Luckily I awoke from this candid utopian dream and realized that it was horrible and by all mean a below par and rushed album on all parts. 
 
Just by using simple wording we can alter a pile of steaming shit into the most exquisite Belgian chocolate and goddamn it I bet you that some people are dumb enough to buy this product and bite into it without questioning because us marketers have made it seem like heaven on earth!
People today have become overly reliant on advertising and the chase for luxury. We need to portray an image to the world that we are successful whilst the horrible truth might be that we are flat broke. 
 
I hate to use this example but I'll use it anyways: There is a man walking on a street. He is well styled, has a nice haircut and a really nice suit. Shiny polished shoes and a top of the range mobile phone. At the same time on the other side of the street going in the opposite direction a man with scruffy hair, unshaved is walking down the road. He is wearing ragged jeans, trainers a tattered leather jacket and a t-shirt. 
 
Who do you think is more successful out of the two?
 
Most people would automatically assume that the man in the suit would be the successful one out of the two, purely based on his appearance and the luxury goods he seems to be in possession of. When in fact the man in the scruffy gear is Mick Jagger when the fancily dressed man is actually on his way to court. 
 
Now I know that you knew from a mile away that the person in the scruffy outfit would be the more successful one because I presented an obvious question and a person with half a brain cell would actually recognize that the question is bull. However it does present us with the option which proves that if we actually see these two on the street and we do not know who Mick Jagger is we would assume otherwise. 
 
We the people were given brains to use, but to me it seems that we are falling into redundancy of actually using our own individual decision making skills with everything. We are afraid to make up our own opinions so we let people like me, marketer, make them up for us! Why must we say that it is cool to dress in the latest Nike outfit just because it is ""cleverly"" worn by Eminem or Fiddy P, or what ever the hell his name is. You know, the guy who got shot 9 times. 
 
I think the main reason is that majority of people now days are so weak that they have to look like their idols to hide their frail personalities. We seem to need to define ourselves by the earthly possessions, such as clothes so we can fit into some different sub category of people that some crack head came up with
 
People are DUMB."

"event","Well,

That was one interesting graduation. Not in a good way though. I was battling off a fever of about 39.5 degrees so I kinda didn't get my self to the full festive spirit. 

Right now though when I look back on things I feel a bit surreal. I am the first ever child/grandchild on both my parents' side who has obtained a qualification from higher education. Everyone else has just their high school diplomas, if that. Infact I was the second one to graduate from High school from the grand children (if you look from my grandparents).

This all feels so surreal because I now feel that I am an adult. There are no restraints set by education or schooling, now there are just restraints from work, such as well... I'll rather not go into that, because they might be more easily offended than the bastard bar workers. But in either case I do feel that I am feeling quite proud of my self for having completed the course and also having come as far as I have, because there were times when I was going to throw it all away. 

Hm... that's a bit interesting... I just coughed up some blood. OH well. Will go see a doctor on Monday or something so that I can get my self sorted out. Can't be arsed to go now because I know it will be good for nothing.

Either way. I'm feeling drowsy allready and I think I need to go lay down"

"event","It's been some time again since I wrote anything.

I know I keep promissing to write through updates everytime, but for some reason after I finish writing a passage here I go and read over it and realize what utter bollocks it is. It's kind of like nothing interesting happens in my life any more.

I remember when I first started to write here it was an outlet to vent steam from that dead end job I worked when I was in Uni. This place was something that kept me insane and from the people who have read this, other than on my friends list, found the stories amusing. Though I admit that I was the biggest prick in the world to some of the clients there, but hey that's just life and when you get no gratitude or even a ""thank you"" at the end of the night it is kind of pointless to even try. But I am not complaining. Towards the end of my tenure with the place I got away with so much! Turning up completelly drunk with a beer still in my hand and then going to the cellar and downing another couple of bottles of beer and mixing a few vodka redbulls. Or then all of that was just that I noticed that the bar manager had a weak personality and I just exploited that fact. The owner was not a problem. He was banging probably several of the employees there while his wife was socialising at the VIP lounge. I'm telling you that place was so inbread like there is no tomorrow.

OK other things then. ME and my girl fried achieved our one year aniversary! FUCK YEAH!!!!! It's bizarre and quite weird, but it really doesn't feel like we've been together for a year cos time has just flown by. But either way I'm even more in love with her than before! yeah that's my soft spot. what's yours?

I can't believe how busy I have been for the past month and a half. It just seems that I have no spare time for my self. That's why for the first time since I started to work I have slept beyond noon on a weekend. Which is a huge fecking achievement. Right now I am technically working three jobs (if you count coaching hockey into it because I am getting paid for doing it) Get this!: I get up mon-fri 5:30 to get ready to leave for work at 6:00 and get back from work around 16:30. Get back eat do some work for my other job on Mondays. If tuesday or wednesday I will be leaving for hockey around 1930.
Tuesdays even earlier to do circuits before training. 
Wednesday again same thing. 
Thursdays: Ice hockey 2130-0130 WOOHOO
Fridays: Somewhat off might have matches
Sat: mostly off occasional matches
Sun: Matches 

So yeah I think I am doing a bit too much


Still ahead in the events calendar: Thursday I AM GRADUATING FROM UNI! WOOT!

Till then

"event","Had a relatively relaxing weekend, untill sunday.

After my hockey team's AGM me and Libby drove up to my parents' for my mum's birthday. My mum flew back from Finland where she did another freelance gig, which is cool cos she's getting back into the flow of things workwise. Saturday we just chilled as a family and just caught up. I think my brother and Libby had some weird deep conversation about society and stuff but the only words I could hear were shagging so I am not too sure. By the way I was not in the same room as I was in a 'meeting' at the time.

Sunday then. Mayhem... Got up watched the F1, which was a waste of fucking time. Then after breakkie drove up to Bisley for my 3 inline hockey matches. Got mullered in the first one 9-3 where I got one assist to a goal. the second match should've been ours but we fell asleep and gave up playing and lost 5-1. Gutting. 

The last match: Good points first
We won the match 6-2
I scored my first hat trick in the league! SCORE!!!!
The hat trick was finished off after I got injured.

The bad points:
I got elbowed to my jaw which I hear improved my game. I guess I was pissed off and upped the ante.
I got injured due to my ankle support giving way in my skate and slid uncotrollably to the board spearing my self to the stomach. Right now my left side is completelly swollen up. Well I guess that's one way of getting your abs worked out.
As a result of the impact with my stick and the board. I broke my stick. I haven't had time to check the extent of the damage on my stick.

But apparently my first words after sort of coming to lying on the floor were ""I've broken my stick"".

I actually broke the skin even though I had the area padded and had a bleeding wound next to my belly. 

Eventually got awarded player of the match so I think that it was well worth it. Just need new skates now

PEACE YA'll"

"event","I'm so fed up with these 'punk' acts that claim to be this and that though their main objective is to live the life of Motley Crue and so forth. Honestly do you know any Motley Crue songs by heart? I think the majority of their fame comes from the debauchery that they left in their wake! I mean Led Zeppelin did their share as well, but atleast we remember them mostly by their influence on modern bands, rock, metal and punk alike. Why must all these bands endorse this 'Rock star' image? And I am not ranting about it because I don't drink, do drugs or smoke. 

Why are the fore mentioned things with loose women more important than the music to so many bands today? Isn't creating art enough any more. If I was an artist I would rather live my life the way that I'd go unapreciated till my death and only after wards my work would be understood. Imagine if Rembrand or Van Gogh lived their lives the same way as most rock bands do theirs. I think we'd remember them for their crazed painter antics and be saying ""Ah Rembrandt. That crazy fucker. Remember when he showed that brush to a girls ass with red paint. Man he was a GOD""

"event","I think there's a reason why people do not like police officers in the USA. 
Yes, there has been countless cases where police have been accused of using their force and authority in an impropper manner. I can't remember when Rodney King was beaten by the police, an event which caused world wide reaction to police brutality. 

Now a new case emerges when police in New Orleans have beaten up a 64 year old black man. I mean c'mon a person of 64! What the hell could he do. An old retired person who has just probably come back home to face the devastation, possibly lost some of his worldly posessions, or worse, a loved one. So what does he do? What every god fearing citizen would do, get's wrecked. 

Fair enough police are allowed to remove people under the influence that are a threat to themselves and to the public order. I say let them come here and beat the crap out of some of these freshmen. Yeah I think that would go down well in the media. Sorry, I know I've been a freshman my self I know it's all fun and games and rowdy drinking, but I've come so distanced from that and in some introspective hell I actually saw it all as a waste of my time. 

But back to the main issue here. What right do the police have to beat up a 64 year old pensioner who is drunk? Was he pushing PCP? Was he threatening to shoot some one? I doubt it. If a person recieves 4 blows to the head there must've been good grounds for this and from what I have seen and read there hasn't been. 
But isn't this the all mighty America? I think that some of these people still carry a huge repulsion toward the different ethnicities that recide in the country. 

I think that the famous words ""can't we all get along"" said so long ago still have not reached their meaning.

What a sad pathetic world we live in"

"event","I'm distressed,

I'm completelly incapacitated in bed again. I got out of bed on monday morning and felt a 'snap' in my back and after that I was not able to lift my self up straight. My upper body was arched like I was 70 or something. It was rather amusing walking on the streets like a chimp but with the amount of pain I felt it was not the most pleasant thing to experience. So Monday I was able to work for half day untill my bosses got, I assume, sick of watching me walk like monkey and sent me home. 

As I saw my osteopath today the severity of my problem was revealed: I have 3 vertabraes out of place and according to their words the worst case of muscle spasms that they've ever seen, so I found that slightly amusing. They were only able to try and relax my spasms but that didn't work fully as I am still standing slightly arched. 

Annoying as this throws in the light of giving up my sports. Which I will not do. Fuck it I'll get paralysed and then ask for euthanasia as I can't stand living incapacitated like that.

Well anyways... I'm gonna sleep... Fuck it... I'll write when I have something to say again, rather than piss and moan."

I thought that we lived in a humane world where everyone was finally treated as equals we are far from it.  I know that I may not be the most politically correcy person on this planet, because I do let out racial slurs on occasion but generally with my tongue placed firmly in my cheek. 

The past weeks events have let us follow human tragedy once again. News papers and all forms of media in the world have their eyes transfixed on New Orleans USA, and it seems that the current administration has finally showed their true colours if they did not reveal it during the first election! In a land that advertises itself as the cradle of freedom for all is, atleast in my eyes, far from this!

How can a free society for all write in news that all the looting was done by african americans? why did the papers write that all the whites were looking for food? We all know that it was opportunism at its best in a struggle to survive and maybe in some cases not even that, but just pure theft. We cannot be so fucking blind that we still believe that black people are the root of all evil, when the root of most evil sits in a room shaped as an oval! I think the greatest theft and crime has been commited by those in charge and by those who failed the people of New Orleans and who put this planet in threat by not signing the Kioto agreement! 

How can this man truly be a credible leader of a nation when he has demonstrated on numerous occasions that he is possibly THE dumbest president ever! But it's not a surprise coming from a dumb family. (his mothr was quoted saying: ""These people were living in poverty so it is working out quite nicely for them!"") You upper class high society whore! You go and live in that area for the week instead of looking for photo ops acting like you care! Plus then there is his crusade in Iraq. What have you accomplished? You've got nothing but a country sliding into chaos that you cannot controll in which people who defent your phony cause will die! And those who have and those who will, will have died for nothing! 

One can't help but wonder if this area was inhabited by white people in a different income bracet/social class. How fast would the evacuation been? How far would the officers/officials gone? Would they have risked life and limb saving as many as they could? Now all they are doing is cleaning up the bodies! We will never know so it's pointless to even guess. What is done is done and it is sickening! 

The last time we witnessed a nation in need was in the new year, where events were somewhat different. The tsunami events took everyone by surprise and there was no way of predicting it. This was predicted the warnings were late.

Praise to Kayne West for speaking his mind ON LIVE NATIONAL TV! Also Sean Penn for being the star that is in New Orleans doing his share to help in the efforts! Fuck every other celebrity who is speaking their mind in papers, You fucking go there! The same goes to you President Bush! You go in there and help and stop patronising these people! 

President Bush! Burn in a steak!

Now is the time for the people to voice their opinion and if my voice was worth a damn I would urge everyone in the world to speak out, exress their GENUINE desire to help, and oust the wolf in lambs clothes!"

"event","I just took a quizz online and one of the questions was where I was born and where I am now.
For some reason this just triggered a chain of emotions in me, which is strange really. Born in Espoo in 1981, and then living in Parola, which has now turned into a nice sub urb for Hameenlinna. But when I lived there it was a nice tranquile place that people were bound to for their lives. 

How bizzare is it? When I actually do sit down and stop to think about it I still can't believe that it has been SEVEN years. SEVEN!!! it was only supposed to be the two? I remember when I was kicking and screaming wanting to go back home to Finland and then what the hell made me want to stay? 

Having thought of this I think I sort of switch a part of my self off when I'm abroad. I still consider my self Finnish above all things. But when I am back in Finland I do feel the most at home, and having been back this summer I am not disclosing the chance of returning there. When I spoke with my dad about this the other day. He is growing quite fed up of living abroad. I mean my parent's really shouldn't anymore. They sacrificed all these seven years for me and my brother. Seven years when they both could have been alot happier. Not to say that they're both miserable and on the brink of a divorce, but alot of things could have been different. I bet if my dad had decided to stay he would have second guessed it for the rest of his life whether he should have taken on the offer. I've lived through the Expat Hell. 


People who say that they want to live out of finland think that everything abroad is easy living, but it's not. I have to bust my ass in two jobs just to get by and survive from rents. Ok some people may feel secluded where they are but you really have to push twice as hard here than back home. 

Should I be jubilant of the fact that I wake up every day in Southampton? Should I jump for joy that I live out of Finland? I don't think so. I rejoice and feel good about the fact that I am alive, have a great family and that I have finally found a direction to my life after being so utterly lost all those years. I'm not saying that my place is here, but I have found all the elements that make me happy and life worth living again.

Moving on to different things. I am not sure if I've made mention of this fact here that I have gone stone cold sober. I have not enjoyed or consumed a single drop of alcohol in the last month. I know I am still at a verry early stage, but you gotta make a start some where. I hope that I can keep to my decission that I will not drink ever again. 

My reasoning behind this is:
A) I hated the feeling I got the day after and the day after that. 
B) I hated being drunk. I didn't feel that it was not ME, but some one different in my place
C) The money I spent on booze could have been spent on something better or saved. 
D) I started to hate this culture where drinking is adored and you're considered a man only after you dip your nutsack in a shoe full of beer and then drinking it (I KID YOU NOT!!!! THIS IS THE MEN'S FIELD HOCKEY ROOKIE INITIATION) Just think of it nuts in a shoe full of beer and then drinking it...

I am not saying that I will go Straight edge because I've been there before and I don't believe in the 'movement' and secondly I do not like to asociate myself with any 'genre' of being. I am me and me does not like to drink anymore. People can drink if they want to. I do not condescend on anyone for their choises. They are still people who have their own minds, opinions and views and I respect them for that. 

I think now I am extremely tired and could go sleep!

I could buy the car I first had my eyes on or then ask for a bigger amount and buy a different car.
Same model as the one I had in mind but then again the new one would be cheaper to run and keep. The other thing that I am afraid of is taking that plunge towards an endless circle of paying the debt back. Plus the mounting stuff I have for my student loan as well. Well that's life and so forth.

I'm feeling quite tired and stuff...."

I got a call from my bank saying that I am eligeble for a loan. The reason why I have been turned down by so many credit card and loan companies is that I have an off shore account which in turn makes lenders hesitate. So if things go well, I should have few pairs of wheels under my butt soon. Just have to hope that no one buys the car I have my heart set on!"

It's taken me to update again, but I have a valid reason again I suppose (yeah right). 
I've just swapped rooms to a lot bigger one and haven't finished reorganizing it. I still need to go to my parent's house and pop down to IKEA to buy a little drawer set thingy so I can free up some space from my wardrobe for other miscelaneous stuff. Really do need that drawer set thing cos right now my room just reminds me of a room that some one tossed a granade into and closed the door. But I have a good feeling about it though. The room is going to be cosy as shit. 

Things are going quite good now. I was incapacitated for nearly 3 weeks with back problems which turned out to be more severe than first thought. The doctors that I saw said that I have sciatica, which is just iritation on the sciatic nerve which really isn't a diagnosis. (Gwally.. Dr's are great) But Libby managed to talk me into going to her clinic place thing and they actually had my problem pin pointed in about 5 minutes. It turns out that my back curves slightly to the right at the Lumbar area, which goes on in the family anyways, but added to that there was my accident in the army, which they did not treat properly, and that has left me with partially slipped and crushed disc in my lower back. Luckily I am getting the propper treatment for this now as it turns out that I could have gone to surgery if I would have done what the doctors told me to do. From now on I will be second guessing everything 'a doctor' tells me. Shit if my back has been fucked up since 2002 and it's been an on going problem and having gone to this clinic I felt better just after one session.

Too bad the back issue kinda jeopardised or blew my plans for hockey out of the window. I was about to sign to a top3 team, but now have to go to a lower level club to see how my back copes and how hard I can push it and then try out for them next year. Same for ED1. the back issue has put me back in my exercise schedule majorly so it's no point of me going in and trying out while I can't give it my all

In other related news. I am currently on a look out for a car and a damn good loan. I've found a few cheap and good ones as well like a -98 Renault Megane 1.6E for 890 pounds, which is damn cheap for a car that age. And the mileage is not bad either so the car would do me fine. I need to speak to my other halves dad and my dad about it because lets face it they are infinitely wiser than I am and I don't want to go and spend money on a shit deal. Given that my girls dad is a financial director and my dad has several years experience from cars and technicalities. But money is the issue. I'm going to have to take a loan out and pay it off within a year and then sort out my student loans, if I manage to only pay off the interest on it everymonth. Which reminds me... I have to call up these people and see how I pay it off. Loans suck and I hate them but what can I do eh.. I work my ass off and get verry litlle in return

Speaking of work. I've started a new project and I am gaining more and more experience from it, even though at first I failed to see it. The project kick off is on Monday (hopefully) if I get the Go ahead from my client. WEE EXITING!!! I haven't started my second job yet, but that is due to start in september. That's an extra 8.50 an hour. Then I need to talk to the compnay director if I'd be able to do the IDM degree and get their sponsorship for it. It is going to be hard but atleast after that I would have two degrees and damn good foot hold to progress!

Any ways. The time is half past the monkeys ass and I better go to bed because I haven't really slept all too well recently for some bizarre reason. 

I hope every one is ok and is enjoying life to the fullest!"

"event","So it's been a while... since Staind wrote a good song.

I've gotten back from my holiday and I am now on sick leave with severe back problems. So where do I begin? Everyone knows about July 7th and even though it was a horrific day for the life loving people of the world all I can do is offer my condolences to those who lost loved ones and condemn the attacks.

However my holiday was wicked. Two weeks of visiting relatives and just enjoying the Finnish summer like it is supposed to be enjoyed. Relaxing by the lake and being eaten to pieces by insects and enjoy the pleasures of Sauna. Ok it may not seem like much but once you've been without one for such a long time and go in... man... purification at it's best. 

Other highlights was TUSKA festival in Helsinki and the accomodation. My cousin's mate had booked us (me, libby, Teemu my cousin and himself) to one of the fanciest hotels in Helsinki. Hotel Marski dead in the city center for only 90 euros a night. And man the rooms were NICE AS SHIT!!! never been in such a good hotel before! Fucking amazing. Tuska was fun as an event as well. Got to meet friends from Southampton and Finland and make a few new occasions and laugh at metaaaaaall fans who resembled Conan the Barbarian. Only watched two bands play (Mnemic and Pain Confessor)and was positively surprised by both. All in all it was a good weekend given my preconseption of the festival being a murky goth gathering with only Hair metal being played. I was surprised that there were no incidents (violence or disruptive behavior) reported at the festival. The only thing that kept police and paramedics occupied were the drunken people who had passed out due to the heat and too much drinky. I'm not surprised at all that the festival carries the title of the safest festival in Finland.

Everything has remained pretty much the same, the only exception being that I have, or am trying to, give up drinking for good. I have come to realize that Alcohol is not a good thing for me. I do not like the person I become when I am drunk because I have really no controll over my mind or body and the hangovers are incapacitating to say the least. Hence I rather keep a sober mind than put my self through the pure horror, that my hangovers are. Plus it saves money. I know that people are saying this and that about it but I am atleast going to give it a hell of a shot and if I fail at it, then I do, but atleast I have tried. This is not me going Straight Edge, because I do not like to brand my self to a movement. It is just for my own well being. 

I think that that is all for now. I will now go and read the entries made while I was away.

I am finally back on line and rocking!

I just sorted out my interweb thingy and I am now writing for the first time in who knows how long?
I realized that I can also use this blog thing at work but I rather be all business no bullshit at work and then have the fun at home when ever I get back, and IF i get back. Tendency and habit is that Virgin trains and the train service in this country is terrible. 

flying to Finland in about a week (well the 10th) and taking Libby with me to show her to all the rest of the extended family. Should be a right down laugh as none of my family really speak english save one of my aunts and her husband, but that's just cos they both work for Nokia.

There are still lot of things in works for the Finland trip and I need to figure out what I am gonna do with Libby other than go to Helsinki on the 16th with my cousin and then umm... don't know what. But hey I am an impulsive person. I'll figure something out. 

But now I will go and check my emails cos I havent done that in a week"

"event","It's that time of the year again. For the foreigners it might be the midsummer night which in my native causes massive celebration i.e. a 4 day drinking binge and if you are a male you may well be fished out the water with your zipper open. Oh and you'd be dead... 

In that respect did not have that much of a feast for it, because here it's not a cause for celebration. Did go to the pub for a couple of drinks to mope cos my dickhead landlord is trying to fuck me over from my deposit. His argument is that I have not paid my last months rent and thus he is refusing to pay it back to me. Even though in my bank statement says that on the 2nd of june the rent has gone through and then I have a meeting at my bank today to change few details of my account so I will get a statement to say to whom that cheque has been paid to. I have got that cock sucker by his fucking balls.

I havent really had time to update this journal due to being at work and it is quite hectic (why oh why did I want to get into Marketing) but I've thoroughly enjoyed my self there and then there's been moving. I have packed my computer up and I've been living at my girl friends for the past couple of months already. I guess the actual move in came when I brought my hockey kits over. Haha.. now her room smells of hockey as well Tee hee..

Any how. I will hopefully get to read everyones entries after I'm settled in in my new place. In the mean time Take care of yourselves.

I've got work, which usualy takes me up till 1900 to get back to town, and then packing my room up so I can move out of the current house. Well I havent lived there for a good while now as pretty much all my stuff is at my girlfriends... my self included.

I am loving my new job. It is absolutelly brilliant really enjoyed the past couple of weeks I've worked there and have already started to make a name for my self for relentless effort I put in and for my willingness to learn

Also got the club stats for hockey through:
in GBinline I was second with 5 goals and 5 assists 
and BRHA I was first with 14 goals and 8 assists. 

But alltogether I am number one both leagues combined.

I will hopefully have time to read through everyones journals soon and make comments but for now, please take the petty excuse of me being busy and tired and having a weird obsession over matthew maconahue..."

Now it's just WORK!!! real propper honest hard work. Had my first day today and it was great!
now I will go beg for my girlfriend to massage my legs and possibly fall a sleep if she agrees to do em. If not I'll just go to bed."

"event","Well it's been a while since I updated and most recently my only update has been the one long drunken ramble that still seems to amuse me for some obscure reason. Nothing major has been going on exept I have handed in my dissertation and am now officially finished with UNI and EDUCATION!!!! to tell you the truth it is the biggest anti climax of my life. Didnt feel stressed by the project at all and I feel worried that I havent done enough. Well I'll take things as they are. On another note I have only a few days untill I start at my new and propper job.... Can't wait!!!!! That also means that YES I HAVE QUIT COLLECTING STINKING MUGS AND CUPS AND SHIIT. So no more aggravated nights of dealing with wanna be Gangstas and G dogs. Those poor puppies wouldnt last a moment in the real world of thuggin.

Other than that I have possibly ended my hockey season prematurely due to a shoulder injury, but I will find out more tomorrow after my dr's appointment. What ever they say I wont listen... they're only doctors and I know my body better than they do... Bet they try to touch me up... bloody pervs... But I havent been able to drink cos of my strong painkillers. If you've ever seen From Hell at the end where they chop that guys brain out and he's in his cell drooling his guts out and mumbling about stuff... Well that's how I get. I stopped eating the pills cos of the way they made me feel but the pain sure has come back.

Any how I'm gonna go to bed now cos my appointment is early as hell and stuff... And I'm gonna go bang my lovely lady :P,... not really.. or maybe,.. you never know"

"event","So its round 0030 on the whatever it is of may. I'm sitting here at my gf's computer while she's asleep (aaaaawwww... she looks adorable). Well there's nothing that exiting going on, exept that I have finished my dissertation and with relative ease as well. Guess I'm just a bit scared that the stuff that i have is not the things that I have done. Even though from tutorials I can tell that my tutors really like my ideas. But i'll be damned if in the exhebition i come across some one who likes what I have done and offers me a position. Then again I have accepted the offer i got from my future employer. I just cant wait to get back into full time employment. Man it's great. 

It has been great. The time I have spent doing my degree really has taught me alot. Given that when I left home at a relatively late stage (21yrs of age) I didn't even know how to cook and now I think that I can make a pretty decent mexican meal and also cook other dishes that I took fancy in a cook book that my grand mother sent me on my first year. The only thing that I really do regret about my time as a student is my first year and being caught in the enviroment of drinking day in and day out. The over all boredom of this town caters for nothing but mindless self indulgent crap bars and meat markets which I came to hate before I left and then got caught up in. It was like slipping into a plastic world where there were no oppinions, no personalities, only trend followers and people who said one thing and followed completelly different ideals. Like a person who shaved their head and said they'd always been punk and still wore trendy shit like Atticus or Famous stars and straps. Fuck that... fuck buying into any fucking labels and clothing that defines the style that is the flavour of the week. Fuck the Camden market in London for having a Punky Phish (or what ever it is) store in every corner. That chain is like the Starbucks of clothing. For along time during that first year I drowned my every self loathing and regret I had over my self and loathing of different individuals in alcohol. I was drunk 85% of my first year. I took my lectures piss wasted, I took nothing serious and gained a shit load of weight cos I had the munchies from either drinking or doing drugs. But then a defining moment came to me one night when I was drunk (surprisingly) when I ran into one other Finnish guy who asked me to come and play inline hockey with them. I hadn't played in 2.5 yrs since my semi pro days and was shit but I discovered the love for the sport again. Not only that it gave me a purpose again. I cut down on drinking, cut down on drugs and kicked some of them completely and started to learn how to make healthy food for a change and most importantly started to exercise. If that's anything to go by i was doing great, but I also drifted away from my ""friends"" who only wanted my company for the silly antics i got up to during the time I was wasted and fucked up on so many things. (if some of my close ones read this and wonder about the drugs i took they were: Weed, Shrooms, acid, coke and X and my only savior i guess was my non addictive personality) 

Even though life looked good again and I had lost most of the weight i'd put on tragedy hit when one of my friends got killed in a drunken accident. It really made me analyze life and after the wake we held for him I did go good 2 months with out any mind altering substances. After that I didn't see most of my original group i hung out with till the end of term. My victorious moment was when the girls I had tried to get into the sack had put on shitloads of weight and I was in the shape of my life and the looks on their face were unforgettable when I walked in. Fucking serves the whores right. 

The summer I spent working in southampton, well atleast a part, doing direct marketing for credit cards which was just shite all the way through and trained for hockey. I did fitness, skill, endurance and mentality training. Hell I was there all by my self doing stuff when every one else was enjoying the sun and BBQ's. I was jumping on the walls to get rid of my fear of being hit and I guess that has resulted of me being one of the best players in the team. My dedication and devotion to the team shows that when I started I was 4th line and a fringe player but fromt here went on to become the top point scorer and regular 1st line forward I guess it goes to prove it.

Also what changed over the summer was my love life. I had been going with this girl for nearly 9months and found out that she'd been a right down slut and slept around. I had given up hope for women and pretty much wallowed in self pity in that respect untill october 20th when I met my current girlfriend and the love of my life. (that is seven months ago and I still feel like I have just fallen in love with her and it is great). From there things sort of changed completelly. From there I became more focused into my education ot get my degree and get a good job and succeed. I guess sub conciously I knew her to be the one since day one and it was her energy and compassion that pushed me forward. I must say that going from just barely passing units to going near merrit student, she played a big part in it. 

But even when I do love her with all my heart she unfortunatelly comes second. If it wasn't for my family I would not be here today. My mum, dad and brother (and my sister RIP) kept me alive when I most needed it. During the darkest days of my soul THEY were the ones who listened and gave me strenght, whether it was with tears in their eyes or just shouting in my face, every last effort they put in really helped me push through every wall. And with the genes i got from them (Virtanen and Rannikko) god damn did I ever turn up to be a stuborn git. CHEERS GRANDPARENTS!!!!

Family and Lib aside there was always my friends. Some of them who turned their backs on me when I left Finland and Parola to Amsterdam can go fuck them selves up their own asses with every finger severed from their hands. Those who stuck by me and kept in touch with me I cheris them more than ever. To the friends I made in Amsterdam I only keep in touch with one, because he was the only true enough person in that plastic world of ISA. FUCK EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE CLASS OF 2001 EXEPT SHUN KUROSAWA! I have said it before and I'll say it again my salute to you is done with one finger!!!! The despise I have for you rest is never dying.

The one person that I did become friends in Amsterdam with was my brother. If it wasnt for him I do not know what the hell could've happened to me. In the most gravest moment of both of our despair we found a common ground and respect for one another. That respect and love has been with us ever since and I cannot possibly express how much it means to me. Even though we say we hate each other at times I know that it is only our warped sense of humour that we connect with every time we are together. I hope that will stick with us for a long time to come. Juha dude, you are always welcome to my home where ever it is and if you need a person to talk to I am always there. 

I guess this moment of reflection has dragged through quite a bit and I've covered most of my time as a student as I am now embarking on ""adulthood"". It feels so surreal. I am considered as an adult now even though there still is a part of me that is 16. 

Even though with the support that I know I have from people I still feel like I am an uderachiever. I just ache to hear words of encouragement at times to make me believe that I have not fucked up or chosen the wrong path, because in the end we all travel our own separate ones. My dire wish is that my family loves me and believes in every choise I have made, because every single one of them has been a concious one."

"event","I am still completelly in awe of my job. And for some reason I refuse to believe it untill I actually start working there. I am confused that they have actually hired me. But hey I guess I am worth something in the end. Now all I have to do is to prove them that they didn't make a mistake, which I have done in every job I've had. But one thing that it did throw into relief was that I am now all sorted for next year. I have a brilliant place to live at for next year and me and my G/f have decided that we are going to be moving in together after next year. tee hee :)

Right now I'm in the process of starting to sort  out my room and deciding which of this crap in here is something that I still need and what I can throw away or put in a box somewhere. 

Oh yeah on another note. If anyone didn't guess from the above mentioned job thing it means that I have finished higher education and hopefully means that I am now done with it till the day i die!!!! AND IT FEELS BLOODY GOOD (i hatses learning in classroom enviroment see)"

As some of you may or may not know I am about to 'graduate' or finish my studies at uni and recently I have been looking for jobs and all i have gotten is shit rubbed into my face. Every job that I have applied to, and that relates to my field of study, is really fucking compelling. There seems to be nothing out there or no one who would hire me. First it's because I have no set experience from the field and the second is that for some reason people here think that distance is an issue. I begin to get the feeling that people are a bunch of fucking pansies and are too fucking comfort seeking. I do not see a 40minute car drive or train trip as a big journey. For fuck sake my dad did 65miles one way everyday(thats over 120miles peeps) when we lived in Finland. 65miles!!! Everyone who says that i am not going to get a job because i live 'too far away' from it can go and stick a fucking severed finger up their ass side ways! FUCKING CUNTS! 

The other thing is that people seem really pushed away by my nationality and what they read of me on the paper. I can bet you that I can do any job 10times better than the next candidate. I have worked with brittish people my whole working life and no offense but they are slackers by nature. I have only met one hard working britton in my whole life. I think it's brown nosing and a long tongue that'll get you far in this country but me being my fathers son I refuse to do it. 

Getting a job is not a problem. I could get a customer service role any time, but do I really want to work in that dead end enviroment for absolutelly peanuts? NO!!!! If I had in two years aiming for a managerial role with a wage of 19k (in uk pounds) a year go down to a fucking role that pays 13k a year?!?!?!? DO NOT FUCKING THINK SO! In the field where i want to work the entry level salaries are lower than my previous salary, but i am willing to accept that because i have no experience in the field, but the starting salary is still better than 13k. Anyways I am not going to be defeated in this. I know what I want and I know how to get there. I will force my self into the industry if I have to. I will not give up! But right now... my hope is lingering"

Anyhow, I'm still alive and kicking i suppose, though I have been to the hospital AGAIN with my dislocated litlle finger and putting that back into place is the single most horrific and (physically) painful experience of my life. Now my finger is all corky and twisted and black. Doesn't help that I got slashed to my hand last night and i think with my luck I have a hairline fracture there as it hurts like a @#%@$^^#& when ever i move it... and it's of nice black and red as well."

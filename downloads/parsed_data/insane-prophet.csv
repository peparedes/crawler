"event","For some reason other the past few days I've had sudden surge in wanting to listen to all my gothic music again. It started with Paradise Lost's Draconian Times as I was returning to univeristy on Monday. By the evening I was in the throes of The Gathering and Opeth and now I find myself listening to large amounts of My Dying Bride.

I just felt the need to vent that."

"event","Actual contact has been made with Harry ""It Didn't Go to Plan"" Richardson. 

This afternoon I recieved an email from him, which resulted in his visting my home. He lives! Despite having had his internet cut off, due to accusations of piracy, and being terrified of his inbox due to F***book emails, he lives.

I have done my best to show him how to salvage his inbox through the magic of Gmail and filters. He has joined the Piledrivers and Powerbombs game that I'm attempting to run via email and we can only hope this will go well. I may actually use LJ as a place to store session infomation - this remains to be seen. Soon I shall make him watch The Gamers and I believe I have his permission to use his old PCs as NPCs in a game I may soon run.

I thought I'd share the good news!"

"event","As Vampir (who I would link to if I remembered how) commented, complained, and mourned the fact that I'm no longer posting on LJ I thought I'd attempt to struggle back into the habit of posting. The bane of course is when I run out of things to say, which always happens, but for now I have Dragonmeet 2008 as fuel.

It's late now, so a proper post on all of that will follow. Being at university (UCL, London) means that I may have more time to write LJ posts, even if I have a lot less *free* time on my hands. Studying history means I have to read like crazy, which cuts down on the time for myself, but the amount of staff contact is pretty low.

Of course I'm still a gamer a heart. Although I sadly no longer have companions to play VTES with, I have joined the UCL Roleplaying Society and am running two games of my own outside of it, which you shall all hear about soon enough.

Here's to keeping in touch with the internet group..."

<b>Constitution-</b>15<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>15<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>13<br>
<b>Charisma-</b>14
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Lawful Good</b> A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act. He combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. He tells the truth, keeps his word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished. Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it combines honor and compassion. However, lawful good can be a dangerous alignment because it restricts freedom and criminalizes self-interest.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are known for their poetry, song, and magical arts, but when danger threatens they show great skill with weapons and strategy. Elves can live to be over 700 years old and, by human standards, are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. Elves are slim and stand 4.5 to 5.5 feet tall. They have no facial or body hair, prefer comfortable clothes, and possess unearthly grace. Many others races find them hauntingly beautiful.
<br><br><u>Class:</u><br><b>Wizards</b> are arcane spellcasters who depend on intensive study to create their magic. To wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art. When they are prepared for battle, wizards can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. The wizard's strength is her spells, everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. A wizard can call a familiar- a small, magical, animal companion that serves her. With a high Intelligence, wizards are capable of casting very high levels of spells.

"event","Was great fun. I'll say more when I'm not about to go to bed.

Update: This was a lovely evening. The Islington Carling Academy is only a 15 minute or so bus ride away from my house so Lysi and were able to get there very early - before the doors had even opened. We got inside pretty quickly and made our way to the front. The venue took awhile to fill up, but fill up it did!

The support band Novembre got a rather lackluster reception. I'm not really that familiar with them, but they didn't play any of their softer stuff that I do know, so it was basically a quick setlist during which the vocalist screamed at us. The drummer however was very impressive; he worked bloody hard and looked like he wanted to die. The bassist looked like a well groomed hobo who was just delighted to be on stage. At one point (when the bassist was indulging in a solo) the vocalist shouted mockingly:

""Look at the bass!""

Suck it dry Jem Jem.

Once Paradise Lost come out the room exploded into a mosh pit, which calmed down enough for the mosher to find their own pit, while Lysi and I kept our spot in front of Greg (the guitarist). The band was in excellent humour throughout the evening and there was plenty of interaction with the crowd. The setlist was supurb and everything translated excellently live. While I might have made some additions (more Draconian Times tracks) I wouldn't have removed anything.

Now to wait for them to come back at some point!

Setlist:

The Enemy
Ash and Debris
Grey
No Celebration
So Much Is Lost
As I Die

<lj-embed id=""1"" />

I'm pretty sure that's my arm on the left at the opening, striking in time with the drums, you can tell by my watch. So the bouncing blond head towards the left would be the back of Lysi's head. That might even be my face at 0:43-0:44

Praise Lamented Shade
Enchantment
Requiem
Unreachable
Gothic
One Second
Never For The Damned
Erased
Over The Madness

"event","It's been a long time since I least posted an entry. What can I say, between universities, history reading, running my Star Wars game *and* school and sleep it's been hard to find time to say anything about what I've been doing!

Still some things certainly deserve a mention. Firstly, it's December now, which is wonderful since I love Christmas so much. The downside of that is that I've yet to manage to really think about what I want for Christmas, or what I should get for other people. It looks like some rushed shopping is in order pretty soon! Personally I'd wanted a copy of Rock Band for Christmas, but since it's not released in the EU yet, that's not going to happen. *Sigh*

December also means Dragonmeet and my, a good time was had this year! Our party was significantly larger than it had been in 2006, Jem Jem, Harry, Krys and I were joined by Thomas and John (Of Jar-Head White Wolf forums game). John turned out to be a lovely, friendly individual as expected, and not some insane rapist as one often fears. We all managed to find each other at Victoria without too much difficulty in the morning, though Jem Jem was running late (So, on time for him). John actually walked past Harry and I and the three of us had that amusing moment when you *think* you've recognised someone you've never seen, but you're worried that you might terrify a total stranger.

Soon enough we were united as a unit and went in search of Kensington, Unfortunately the line to get tickets for the tube at Victoria station were insane, so at my suggestion we took the bus instead. Under Harry's leadership and geographical skills (vastly superior to mine) we managed to arrive at Kensington High Street having spent a lengthy bus journey chatting about White Wolf games, the horror of the London Lite paper and the fact that John was spending his time popping ""Pro-Plus"" pills, having only got 3 hours of sleep the previous night.

During this time I received a call from Jem Jem who had managed to arrive at our destination before the rest of us. (Oh, the shame!). He and I had difficulty communicating, all I really gathered was that he was low on, or had no credit and that there was something Norwegian.

You can imagine my confusion.

We assumed that he meant he'd meet us near some form of Norwegian shop. When we failed to find one (having also checked inside the station) Harry suggested that perhaps he'd said Con-Ven-Shon rather than Nor-Wee-Gen. This made sense to us all so we trotted off to the venue. After receiving goody bags, packed full of, well, goodies (including a promotional D6) we got inside and took a look around.

No Jem Jem.

We realised we couldn't call him as his phone seemed to be off. I decided to try again, whereupon he found us all as we shopped. It turns out he'd borrowed a Norwegian woman's phone and had stayed at the station, yet we'd managed to somehow miss him when we went there.

We spend a lot of time dashing around grabbing free stuff (13 Clone Troopers, 3 Tie Interceptors, 60+ dice among other things for me) before going out for lunch. By the time we'd returned a number of the games no longer had enough spaces for six people, but we were resolved to play as a group. Having to abandon Scion and other games we grabbed all the spaces for the Warhammer Fantasy RPG.

 The game turned out to be good fun. Jem Jem was a clumsy in game as he is in real life. John was well organised and helped us work as a unit, even if he tried to throw a knife having only one eye. Krys was our quiet sergeant, leading us, the noble town watch and I was reforming ex-druggie who spent most of the game trying to secure some drugs.

I succeeded there, diverting certain supplies we confiscated from the evidence room to my own pocket.

The guard ended up spending a lot of time complaining about foreigners, Halflings, journalists, students and goblin excrement. As John noted, we spent more time attacking and threatening students, arresting harmless drug dealers (the dealer himself got dog piled by three of us and still took an eon to club into unconsciousness) than tracking down Goblins and serial killers.

We know where our priorities lie!

All in all, the day was delightful. Krys was too kind and got me a Christmas present (a huge Star Wars minis booster pack, a massive add to my Star Wars RPG), for which I can only thank him profusely. John turned out to be excellent company a great guy to game with, as could only have been expected. Man hugs were exchanged at the end and hopefully we'll all see each other again sooner rather than later.

My Stars Wars game continues to go well.

I have my Cambridge interview tomorrow...Fingers crossed! Paradise Lost live on Wednesday will hopefully take the edge off of that mind."

"event","Raw was great fun. Although live it lost some of the excitment in that the music wasn't as clear and you didn't have JR and King commentating, the moves themselves and the general ""sport"" gained a lot from being live. It really struck home how large and powerful a lot of the WWE Superstars are.

The matches were as follows:

Carlito Vs William Regal

Not bad at all. Carlito's cool on the mike and came out talking trash about England, English women (they're ugly) and English men (who've yet to work out that tight jeans are for women. I suspect this was aimed at Harry). He declared he wanted to fight and Englishman, whereupon Regal come out and the two had a match, won by Regal. Good fun, but nothing vastly exciting.

Super Crazy Vs. Snitsky

We were surprised, and quite thrilled, to see Super Crazy, but our hearts sank when we realised he was doomed to job to Snitsky (who looks HUGE live). Super Crazy showed off his athletic prowess, while Snitsky displayed his raw power. A impressive moment was when Snitsky kicked out of Super Crazy's pin and in the process, hurled Super Crazy over a visibly surprised and panicked Referee.

Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes Vs. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdock (Word Tag Team Titles)

As might have been expected, Cade and Murdock retained, but this was a lively exciting match with plenty of power from the champions and athleticism from Cody. Quite exciting.

Val Venis Vs. Mr Kennedy

Kennedy showed off his mike skills, which was good fun, though at first he refused to finish his catchphrase (being heel), though he relented after he won. Fun enough, but it dragged on a bit.

Harry Smith Vs. Santino Marrella

Nobody knew who Harry Smith was until he mentioned he was the son of the British Bulldog. He and Marella showed off some quite neat moves, being small men, with Smith picking up the victory. Afterwards Hacksaw Jim Duggen came out with the Union Jack and had every chant out ""England"", rather than ""USA"" for once.

Candice Michelle Vs. Beth Phoenix (Women's Title)

As this came after the intermisson we all sighed, expecting a pretty poor escuse for softcore porn. How wrong we where, Candice has massivly improved since I las tpaied any attention to her and Beth Phoneix is STRONG. One of the best matches of the night and a real surprise. Very good. Beth retained, of course

Tripple H Vs. Umaga (Street Fight)

We all assumed that this was the main event and were thus suprised and a little upset that we didn't get to see Jeff Hardy or Randy Orton. The place was on fire when Tripple H's music hit and he came out. The match itself was nice and brutal, though we didn't get the tables we were chanting for. Tripple H picked up the win and Umaga could hardly get up afterwards. A Crowd pleaser.

Jeff Hardy Vs. Randy Orton (WWE title)

We were suprised to see Jeff in the main event for the title and thus knew there was no way he would win. Despite that he got a rock star reception and the crowd was exciting by a high flying match that ended with a thunderous RKO. When Randy came in Jonathan, Harry and I were all pulling Randy's pose and Harry and I are pretty sure that Randy spotted us, since he paused for a brief moment.

All in all a great evening. Our seats were much better than expected, as they were in the aisle and thus not blocked by anyone and as we were at the back we could stand when we wanted to. The only down side of thee vening ws getting back quite late and having to share a train on the way with ""Captin Stinky"" a man who smelt more horrible than anything I've smelled in months, like a combination of old tobbaco and gone off Guinness. Disgusting!"

"event","Last weekend John (my step-father) took me up to go and watch the Australia Vs. England match in a bar before going on to watch some live rugby (Harlequins Vs. Bristol). A good day was had, combining rugby and plenty of Guinness. So, obviously I watched tonight's match.

Up until those last 5 minutes my gut was sinking, but all of a sudden, bang, a few Sweet Chin Music worthy superkicks and England had a place in the World Cup final!

Anyway, what else is new? Not much really. Jem Jem and I had a brief falling out, most of which was due to miscommunication and a lack of tact on my part, but, credit to him, he gave me a chance to explain myself and all is well. Props to him.

Other than that there really isn't much else. I'll be heading out to see Paradise Lost on December 4th having located someone to accompany me (Lysi) and am now making sure I have a firm grip on all eleven (!) of their albums. Despite Douglas' claims I ought to have gotten bored of listening to moslty them over the past two weeks, eleven albums is enough to keep me fresh.

Harry, Lysi and I will be going to see Nightwish in March, but next Tuesday Harry, Jonathan and I will all be of to see RAW at Wembley Arena. It's just such a shame Cena was injured just a few weeks ago, now we shan't get to see him."

I'll probably say more about this once my head is more level. Suffice to say as of the past hour my home life has become very miserable.

"event","Yesterday Krys, Krys' sister, Jem Jem and I all got together on Oxford Street to spend the day together and to try to find some shoes for Krys' sister and perhaps some trousers for the man himself. Unfortunately it seems we were failed as regards these goals, but nevertheless a good time was had and I was proven correct in my assertion that there were plenty of places to get shoes there.

After a little bit of hassle trying to find each other, involving me texting Krys from about 10 metres away, then promptly spotting him after having sent it, we realised that James was, as usual, running about an hour late. So we gave upon him and did some browsing until he eventually turned up, whereupon we continued our browsing; popping into various shoe shops and other sports shops. While the Poles tried various things on Jem Jem and I looked at the tasteless slogans across the various T-Shirts and played around with what was on display:

<img src=""http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k261/Insane_Prophet/BeninaSportsShop.jpg"" />


     After that a quick trip to Metal Militia was in order, for some mocking and quick browsing, resulting in me obtaining a Korn poster, which I delighting in using as a cane for Jem Jem's head and a lecture stick for pointing at things. Krys picked up a few badges, and after some fumbling around on the streets we ended up Gosh Comics and finally playing games where Krys picked up Scion and we had a lovely chat with the nice man behind the counter about his VAST (and I mean VAST) Cthulhu Hereoclix model. It was so big they couldn't have it in the shelf with its wings attached.

Trying to get lunch was slightly difficult as Jem Jem was making a fuss about everything and I had my dentists appointment shortly, which meant I was forced to rush my meal and then (sadly) leave everyone and run for the tube. A tube journey followed and then I got stressed as I had to wait for a bus, which, as luck would have it, was also carrying my father. Unfortunately when we arrived at the dentist to meet my brother we were told that the bastard had cancelled our appointment' therefore wasting my time. 

Anyway; here are a few pictures from the day:

Since Lacuna Coil are one of the bands I'm very fond of, and never thought would make it into such a game (since they're not some huge metal band from the 80s) that's probably reason enough for me to buy Guitar Hero 3. Other than that though the only track on GH3 that really leaps out at me right now is Black Magic Woman by Santana, which is Santana and is thus awesome, though that's a cover version.

On the other hand Rock Band has master track copies of In Bloom (Nirvana) and Should I Stay Or Should I Go (The Clash), which are also awesome. Well, less so the Nirvana, but I'm a fan of The Clash and a passing fan of old Cobain.

Looks like I might have to consider both games...Sigh.

Now all I need is to see some Korn confirmed and I'll be a happy little boy."

"event","I went out and bought Korn's new album about an hour ago, so I thought I'd scrawl down my first impressions:

1. Ok, so I already knew that album was ""Untitled"" and I'd already seen the album art, but I still can't get over the fact that the album hasn't even got a name. The art, though not bad from an objective point of view, seems to have little to do with the band or album from my perspective so these are points that count against the album. That said the actual packaging of the super-deluxe-mega-happy-fun-chocolate-edition is quite nice and the art on the collectors cards inside is *much* better.

2. The intro track is an introduction along the lines of Dead on Issues. It sounds like something out of The Nightmare Before Christmas, very good.

3. Everything else? Uh...So far it all just blurs into one electronic mess. I'm not really expecting anything to stand out at this point, but this is definitely the successor to See You On The Other Side. Which was expected but not desired.

I suspect this means one of two things. Either this is an album that I'll view alongside SYOTOS as a disappointment, or, somehow it'll really grow on me. That does tend to happen with some albums... Fingers crossed."

"event","On Friday my family and I all went up to Norfolk for the marriage of two dear family friends (one of whom is John's ex-stepson). The whole affair was really quite lovely and very sweet. Quite fortunately we managed to coexist as a family and didn't have any real difficulty with my brother, or various other wedding guests who we've had a slightly troubled past with. It was quite nice to put my suit back on and there's something strangely nice about everyone getting dressed up the way they did. This marks the second wedding I've attended (that I can remember), the first being my own father's wedding.

On Tuesday I'm going away to Malta for a week, just like last year. I'm looking forward to it as it should be nice, quite and warm. My hope is that it'll let me make some good progress with all of my history reading as well as some time to think seriously about my personal statment, which I need to have finished and sent to my school along with my UCAS form shortly after results day. Not that I'm looking forward to results day...

As far as the history reading goes, the sheer volume of it is quite daunting, but I'm quite enjoyed my reading on Lord Palmerston and the Liberal Party. The reading on the Russian Revolution isn't quite so interesting on the grounds that I hardly know anything about it, but the more I do the more intriguing it is at least. Though by my early impressions I can't see why people ever seem to have nice words for Lenin; from a moral idealistic standpoint he doesn't seem much nicer than Stalin to me."

With my brother...

Jonathan's date had fallen sick but he'd already bought the tickets for the great big Odeon there, so he ended up taking me instead. Not so good for him, but great for me!

The film itself? I liked it. It was quite ambitious I thought, in that they were trying to cover a lot of storylines and had to tie it into the previous two films, but I think they managed to pull it off. There was a good deal of reinterpretation going on (Venom in this film looks and feels more like Carnage to be honest and the Sandman is quite different), but I felt it worked on the whole. Some scenes were a bit off, such as Harry and his butler (those who've seen the film will know what I mean) and Peter's self centered attitude in a few scenes but all in all it was very cool. Far far far superior to X3...God I hated that film.

However, when Peter's out of the symbiote costume (as in, in his civies) he has an emo fringe...Fucking emos."

"event","Writing out history notes is causing my hand to ache like hell. It sucks.

Yesterday I went to Oxford Street to deal with my chronic shortage of trousers as well as buy a few new shirts. I also got a second controler for our PS3; a copy of Def Jam Icon (just to have something to play) and then I met my uncle and we went out for ribs.

Now. Back to revision."

"event","I have spent most of today revising. Hardly enjoyable.

When I returned to my computer Jar-Head had this to say:

john says:
""Yay for my new pendant! Thank you Harry!"" - is it heart shaped and holds a copy of his picture?

Needless to say, it is not."

"event","We went down to visit my grandmother today. She was well thankfully, but she made my brother and I do some gardening, which was hardly fun. We are not men of the land.

Following that we went up to my grandfather's grave, as the last time my father visited it it was in a bad state. Thankfully it had been restored now, so we didn't have to do much. I payed my respects and then spent some time looking for my mother's parents grave sites, but with no luck.

It was quite humbling really, seeing the graves of my grandparents who I never had the chance to know. What was pretty painful to think about was the fact that my grandfather on my mother's side has an open book gravestone, with an empty page that was intended for his wife. She remarried however (and that man threw my mother out the house when she was about 16 I think) and instead was cremated and put in one of the rose gardens. As her second husband has remarried both of my mother's parents are buried alone. That seemed a pretty sad thought to me.

Besides such morbid thoughts what is there to say? Harry's back from Italy and he was kind enough to bring me a gift. I now have an ankh pendant, made from the surrounding ash-stuff from Mount Vesuvius. It's really quite cool. Now that he's back he and I plan to start revising together, seeing as that worked so well for us during our GCSE's. This time round we only share one subject, but hopefully it'll work out. He and I should be seeing a lot of each other over the coming days."

"event","When it all came down to it only Jem Jem and I were actually there to watch Wrestlemania last night, as Will was suffering from a cold, Harry was in Italy, Zain was seeing family and Chris Ed had had an argument with his parents. Come to think of it, it's amazing I didn't OD on Jem Jem, seeing as he was there from Saturday to this morning. Ah well.

On Saturday Jem Jem and I got together with Chris Ed to hang out. The original plan had been to go bowling, but so many people had to cancel that we just all got together at my place and hung out for a bit. Then Jem Jem came with family to go and see 300. 

300. Hrm... It was a decent action film, but the dialogue was pretty poor and the film was (as might be expected) massively historically inaccurate. Xerxes was cool...He was a massive bondage freak and will no doubt be a gay icon for the next six months or so. The worst part had to be the sex scene though. It was like watching the puppet sex scene in Team America, but nowhere near as funny. The attempts to make it appear dramatic simply resulted in me being uncomfortable.

So Wrestlemania? Wow.

The Money In The Bank match was awesome. Edge delivered a total of eight succesful Spears, scoring ten takedowns with them. Impressive. We saw a super-RKO off the top of a ladder, a midget getting slammed off the top of a ladder and Jeff Hardy leap off of a 20 foot ladder onto Edge, who had been lain out on a ladder at ringside. The ladder beneath Edge snapped IN HALF and both men were carried out on stretchers. Wow.

Kane Vs Kahli was depressingly short, but it was cool to see Kane slam Khali.

Benoit Vs. MVP was actually an impressive technical wrestling match, with a total of eight German suplexes.

The ECW match was surprisingly awesome, as was the Battle of the Billionaires, primarily due to a Coast 2 Coast being delivered with a dustbin.

Both championship matches were great; and Cena Vs. HBK had Jem Jem and I on the edge of our seats on a number of occasions. We then collapsed, shattered, due to the fact it went on till 4AM.

In other news my family has a new cat coming to live with us. It's been awhile since I had a pet but I doubt I shall take to this cat as I did my dog. Sigh.

Now that I'm holiday I need to start some serious revision. It's not fair...I wanted a fun Easter!"

"event","1. Had Harry and Jem Jem over on Saturday following my driving lesson. We managed to get Harry up to date on the Wrestling and Jem Jem stayed the night. I was able to show him Clerks.

2. The new Sword of Caine VTES set looks on the surface to be really good to me; there are a number of cards there that have really got me thinking!

3. Amazon sent me a ""clean"" version of Sevendust's new album; which is annoying. The album itself seems ok; but a bit bland in a number of places. Not Sevendust's best work; though it may be better then Next. I shall have to give it a few more listensin order to make my mind up and give it a fair chance.

4. I'm going to hitting the RPG Society with a game of Paranoia this week.

5. The school's hitting us hard to try and get us to decide about universities already. On the Oxbridge front we're really having it forced down our throats. I've no idea if I have what it takes, but I looks like I'm leaning towards applying to Cambridge. Still, if I want even the slightest chance of getting there I'm going to have to work my arse off...

6. My history lectures yesterday at Euston were suprisingly helpful and useful.

I think that's really all I have to say for now. I feel quite sleepy for some reason. Damn school."

"event","The Tacitus test went well (94%) so I'm happy about that. School has been going well but I've had more work then I can really handle and I'm feeling the strain. We had to stay after school on Tuesday for a ""forum"" about Higher Education, which turned out to be something aimed much more at the parents then us students. As I have no frees on Tuesday it turned into a very long day and I haven't really been able to get much sleep recently. I feel utterly fatigued in both body and mind.

Now that I think about it, this really hasn't been my week... On Monday I discovered that something had gone wrong with the screen of my MP3 players causing it to display everything with an annoying red hue, making it impossible to make out the names of tracks and menus. I'm trying to send that back at the moment. Hopefully it'll get sorted out, but it's bloody annoying. Yesterday I accidentally left one of my school books at my mothers and had to run back late it the (cold) evening to pick it up. Today I woke up late (due to going to bed early and sleeping deeply) and had to run to catch my train, which was agony as I was carrying an insanely heavy bag and had been worn out my Games the previous day.

Today annoying from the younger years kept invading my form room making it nearly impossible to get any work done. As I was making my way to Moorgate at the end of the day a bucket of water fell off a building that's been having construction done on it. It soaked me. That was annoying.

This week has sucked so far."

"event","I had a dreaded Tacitus test today which covered everything we'd need to know for the final exam. Thankfully it went pretty well as the majority of the passages our teacher selected were those that we'd known for awhile now, but the whole thing wore me out terribly. To make matters worse the internet was out when I got home today and we only just managed to get it fixed.

The weekend was a bit hectic as I had to try to find time to revise/learn Tacitus and also squeeze in going to the cinema with my father to see Hot Fuzz (very funny!) and see my family on Sunday. The family were far more likable then usual actually and the day went fine; my brother and I spent most of it playing darts. I also had my first driving lesson, which was far less nerve wracking then I would have expected."

"event","As of today Lysi and I have been going out together for a year. She's made me amazingly happy. Although school got in the way of us spending much time together I was able to give her flowers and a card. I'm busy this weekend (visiting family) but next weekend I'll try and take her out to eat or something.

That's pretty much all I have to say. I'm very happy."

"event","Tomorrow I'm going to have to back to school. Yep, it sucks. Regardless it's been a pretty good half term! The National Archives was pretty dull, but things picked up on Wednesday and went well from there; so:

Wednesday:

Valentines Day! This year I actually did something; which is to say I spent the day with Lysi. Annoyingly not quite everything I'd got for her as a Valentines Day gift arrived, so she will be receiving something extra in the near future (one hopes!) but for now I've got her a ""Collectors Edition Box Set"" for Panic At The Disco. Personally I don't really like such music, but she does and hopefully some of the trinkets in there are at least amusing. We had our own version of a romantic meal in the evening and all was very nice. This led us onto:

Thursday:

A good portion of the morning was spent on the phone chasing people up to check who we could expect to attend the Social Gathering and eventually Harry and Will arrived at 3:00. We ran out to the shops to buy some last minute supplies and then settled in to wait for the other guests to arrive. The evening was extremely enjoyable as it gave me a chance to properly see most of my friends for once and everything Harry and I supplied seemed to go down well (especially Guitar Hero! Two guitars are amazing!) though things were slightly marred by someone bringing some Ouzo and getting quite sick on it due to someone else thinking it'd be amusing to put them on it. Hm. Next time I shall have to zealously prevent the consumption of any spirits. Evil stuff. Jem Jem arrived quite late, given that he had to attend parents evening at his school and he eventually ended up staying the night, given that no trains run at 4:00AM as far as we were aware. 

Friday:

Friday was spent mostly in bed trying to regain some energy. Amazingly I was able to escape having a hangover. The rest of it was spent singing Lacuna Coil duets with Lysi who naturally got a lot more vocals them me. Sigh.

The rest of the holiday has been me trying desperately to get all my work done before tomorrow. I have another two essays to do, but one of them is in for the coming Friday, so I'll hopefully be fine, though I have a Tacitus all inclusive test to prepare for the following week.

Tomorrow is Lysi and I's anniversary but unfortunately she has school mocks. I shall at least make sure she recieves a card though and will try to find something nice to do for her in the near enough future.

That's about it for now. Oh, for those of you who care, yes, Harry got quite drunk. No, he didn't get sick."

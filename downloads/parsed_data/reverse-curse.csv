I can't believe I ever thought college was going to be less stressful than high school. I have trouble falling asleep at night and I couldn't figure out why. It didnt occur to me that stress could be a factor, but that makes the most sense. I love being surrounded by the amazing people at this school. Next semester, my RA, Judith, is doing a semester at sea. Yes, that's right. Like fending off pirates and trying not to get scurvy...okay, maybe not. But who does that? 

I'm excited about the future. 
I'm playing with the Columbia New Music Orchestra, which only plays student composed pieces. I'm really excited about it. We have 3 rehearsals and then a concert. So things will be...interesting, to say the least. 

Sara is coming up here right before spring break and we're going to see WICKED! I'm psyched! I can't wait til she comes up here. I want to take her to this poet's cafe and to see NYU. She's never even seen Barnard's campus. Not that there's much to see, because it's tiny, but still. 

I've also been thinking about studying abroad and I really want to do it. Columbia has a huge university in Paris. It would be so amazing to spend a semester there. Now to convince the parents..."

It hasnt settled in that my parents bought three tickets to New York and only two tickets home. 


At first I was only worried about the social scene. Not knowing anyone at your school will do that. Plus, not knowing if the one person you do know will want to see you. That's a little nerve racking too. Now the nerves have spread even farther. What if I'm not smart enough to go there? I got a post card from my RA-- she knows four languages. I only speak one and most of the time, not even correctly. 

I guess its silly to worry about problems that dont even exist yet. It does seem overwhelming though."

"event","LOL.. well a lot has happened since i wrote last time.. 

Well mike and amy moved! and i love them soooo much and everytime i think about it i cry! but yea, if u guys read this.. just know i love you both! I'm really glad we got to see them the nite before they moved and im glad we got to help them pack up the moving truck the day they left!

Sami and I arent friends with Gina and Brian anymore.. I'm not friends with Gina since me and Brian got in an arguement when he called Timmy a N*****.. 1st of all i really care about Tim.. 2nd of all - i really dont like that word.. and 3rd of all  - Tim never did a thing to Brian but Brian just likes being a dickhead.. so yea me and Brian got in an arguement and Gina was more mad at me because I left them to hang out with Sami then she was about the fact that her bf just really upset me! Thats a REAL great best friend! Was I really supposed to sit there and hang out with them when Brian acted like a complete asshole?! Exactly! Fuck them both.. when Brian dumps Gina (AGAIN) shes not gonna have anyone to run to because shes lost the majority of her friends since shes been up Brian's ass..

Since Gina and I arent friends anymore.. I realized I didnt have to go to her mom's suprise party because I didnt feel like being around gina or brian for that matter.. so a few weekends ago, me and sami went and got Tim and his cousin JR (which is weird cuz he knows a lotttta people i know) and Tim was sitting behind me in Sami's mom's car and he sat up behind me and put his arms around me and asked me what i was doin that saturday and i said i didnt know and why and he asked me to be his date to his dads wedding which i thought was really cute.. so yea i told him that sami should come too so i dont have to sit by myself during the ceremony because Tim was in the wedding, so we went and i really felt sick the whole time we were there and we all danced a little bit and the last song of the reception came on and it was a slow song and Tim looked and me and said come on kate... so it was really cute cuz we danced to the last slow song of the wedding and ill never forget it! luv ya sami! lol 

so that nite we went up JR's house with Mike L. and i met these 2 guys.. i know the one was gay but the other one didnt really talk so i dont know if he was gay or not, but he was so funny lol.. a realllly big tall gay black guy lol! but yea so we hung out there and waited for tim to get back cuz he ran up to aberdeen with the gay guy(s) and so me and Sami stayed at JR's house for a while with JR Mike and Jr's brother and some other guy.. so yea Tim was takin forever and mike got pissed cuz he had to work the next day and we left and me and sami went back to my house for the nite!

well me and sami started our new job at BJ's ((yay :( ))
lol, actually its not that bad but we had to do 2 days of computer training which is realllly boring but we did some register training our 1st day with this guy steve lol.. hes kinda slow on the register lol justttt kidding!

well on wednesday nite i got a call from Tim and we talked for like 45 minutes and then he told me to just come over and i brought up the whole thing about how he told some people he wouldnt go out with me and he said ""actually ive been doin a lot of thinkin about that in the alst 2 weeks"" which is a good sign but a lot of stuff is sucky right now and im really tryin not to set myself up to get hurt again but im stupid and im fallin for him all over again and i care about him soooo much but i dont know what to do! 

well yea mike L and sami arent talkin cuz she kinda cut him off last nite and he got real pissed but she called me a couple hours ago and told me she saw him and he was honkin and waving so i guess he got over it which is a good thing!

well a couple other things have happened but im tired and i have to think of them but i gotta be at work in 10 hours so im gonna go get some sleep!  luv u guys!"

"event","well i havent written in a while... so i got a lotttt to say lol...

well i was at the mall yesterday with sam n court.. we had to hunt down nod and his girlfriend (ew), and i saw brian and he came up and asked me if i had seen heather and his brother and i asked which brother he meant and he said chris and i didnt know chris was back yet cuz he called me the other day and said he was coming home soon and yea.. so i told brian when he found them to come find me cuz i wanted to see him.. and then i saw heather and brian and chris and i gave chris a big hug n everything and we talked for a while.. so yea, we were huntin down nod and we got sidetracked.. so then we went down by aeropostale and we saw brent and shawn so i had to go in the store and make it obvious... then we were on our way back out of the mall and we saw isiah and he was doin wut he does best... hittin on the lil girls..

on friday me and sami went out with joey and saw frankie and he HAD to give me a kiss on the cheek before we left lol.. but yea so later that nite (like 12 or 1) tim got dropped off at my house and he was all kinda of fucked up and shit.. but long story short, he was all paranoid and shit and he was talkin in his sleep and scared me and sam.. so we didnt go to sleep that nite and at 4 or 5 in the mornin we decided to take my weenie dog for a walk and wecame back and watched cossroads in my kitchen and drank 2 pots of coffee between us.. so we were exhausted and we didnt want to wake tim up so we snuck into my room and laid on the floor actin like we were sleeping and he finally woke up and he was still grumpy and he asked why we were on the floor n i told him and he apologized or whatever, and i sat outside with him while we were waitin for his mom and he hugged me goodbye or whatever and i went upstairs and sam was asleep on the floor so i hopped up in my bed and curled up in my big blanket and went to sleep till like noon or something (dont really remember)

but yea on saturday me n sam went out with brian and we met up with court jen and jimmy and brian asked me if i wanted to go to OC with him for this car show so i said yea and i wanted court n sami to go so we all packed in his truck and went to OC and we got there at like 5 in the mornin and at 6 we decided to walk on the beach... and it was freezing so we were all in sweatpants and hoodies and we went down to the water and me n court pulled up our pants and walked in the water and the water was soooo warm... so we decided to go back to the truck and put on our bathng suits and we were the only people in the ocean at 7 in the morning... go figure! lol   so then we walked around and wasted time and we finally got a hold of mark and we met up with him and we all went to the funkmaster flex car show.. it was crazy..lemme tell ya lol.. then we went and visited angela and her 2 friends at their hotel.. then we went and ate on the boardwalk and mike called and said they were leaving to go to the apartent and take a shower and he would call me when he was back in OC and he took forever so we left before he got there.. but yea i slept pretty much the whole way home since i didnt sleep for 2 days straight... and when i woke up courtney and brian kept tryin to tell me it was 2 in the mornin and we had been lost forever but it was only like 8 or 9 at nite.. but brian did get lost when we all went to sleep..

then tonite.. me and sam went down 2 her grandparents house and we sat with them for a while n talked    theyre so cute lol.. but then we met joey up at the plaza wehn we were waiting for courtney n we talked to heather and amanda and charlie n everybody.. and then we went to wendys cuz im hungry and then we met joey..again! at wawa and then we went to this guys house and met kevin there and we followed kevin to this keggar party or whatever... lemme tell u there were tons and tons of people there..and sam stayed outside cuz she was on the phone and then she moved her car closer cuz it was at the end of the street and then she was comin in to get us as we were leaving and we went to the car and took court home and we went up to wawa in bel air to get gas and sam had the $11 in her pocket and she had like $50 we couldnt find and sam told me that when she went to move the car her glovebox was open and then i called courtney and told her to ask kevin if he knew anyone there that would have taken shit out of someones car and he said hed figure it out n call us back tomorrow.. so hopefully we'll figure it out cuz sam has no money again!

but yea here i am.. waitin for gina to call me back and tryin 2 get sam to write back!   luv ya bye"

but anywayz.. on Friday nite, me and Sami hung out for a long time and we went up to Tully's to see Gina workin cuz we were gonna hang out with her later that nite..
well me and Sami went over to the pin-ball machine cuz Gina was over there and we were waitin for her to get off work.. and these 5 guys came over and started talkin to us.. well i only remember 3 of their names.. Skip (ginas man), Alan (who is sooooo adorable), and joe.. yes i want him.. lol

but we talked to them for a while and we all exchanged #'s n shit..

then brian met us up there and me and him r planning when we're gonna make babies..

then we all went to ginas and got in the hot tub.. and lauren and jess came over and then andrew and aj showed up... so it was a big hottub fest before ginas mom came out and bitched at everyone cuz ginas didnt tell them that aj and andrew were comin over... so we all had to get out and andrew and aj left... then me and sami went back to my house and we watched ""Ever After"" till like 2 a.m. and we both passed the fuck out...

then we woke up and decided we wanted krispy kreme...so i drove Sami's car down to putty hill just to get donuts and the guy working is a guy i met at this party when i was in like 7th grade... but im a pussy and didnt talk to him...

so we went back to bel air.. took gina to work.. and i dont remember what all we did... but then we were home and got ready to go out and we went up to eat at tully's..again... and we saw alan and joe..but skip was a no show! :( poor gina!

then brian and this guy mark came up and sat with us while me and Sami ate.. and me sami and brian rode in samis car and we made gina ride in brians truck (which mark was driving)... and we met up at the bel air wawa.. while we were in there... we saw jeremy pearce and we said happy birthday and he invited us to this party he was having...

so sami didnt wanna go but gina did.. and we went over to this guy rick's truck (where jeremy was) and they all got out and we told them our driver didnt wanna go... so i got thrown over doug's shoulder and put in the truck... so we kinda had to go..    

so we get up to dublin/darlington and we were with all these bumpkins.. we finally met a real person named OPIE! haha it was hilarious.. but there were a few cute ones..
gina again lied to her parents and they said she had to be home right then.. everyone was drunk off their asses.. but andrew and aj picked us up and we went back to my house and i bitched at her for the whole ride home about lyin to her parents cuz im tired of havin to lie to them to cover her ass and i told her im not doin it anymore!

but me and gina went to sleep and when i woke up my mom told me she was goin to my aunts house cuz her basement flooded so i went back to bed and sami sent me a text message at 2 and i had just opened my eyes and gina was gone.. so i guess her mom came and got her before i woke up..  but sami came over for a bit and she kinda drove to this guy jeremy's house (who shes wanted me to meet for a while)  and i had no clue till we turned into a development we never go to and i was freakin out.. but hes so cute and hes 21 and hes a bartender at the tower on main street.. but anyway hes havin a party tonite and he asked for my # and shit and invited me to his lil party.. but he had to go to the movies with his sister so we left..

Then we went up to hickory wawa and i met jesse's dad and his girlfriend.. then we went back to my house and ate tons of junk food while we watched blue crush..

then sami went to work and i layed around and finished the movie.. went to wawa to get gas for my mom.. drove around for a bit.. and here i am! waitin for sami to get off work!"

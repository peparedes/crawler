"event","... my furry friend...

Hammie my first ever pet
who brought such joy 
in your small hammie way.
I loved to hold you in my hand 
and let you crawl from one 
to another
like a movable staircase
up and down
I remember how you were so small
you could stand on top of a carrot's
cross-section and nibble on the edges
I always laughed to see you asleep
on your running wheel
how you'd be so relaxed and
sprawled on your back
snuggled in a corner
lying on your side...
You ran away once -- climbing out of 
your cage and hiding in the kitchen
cabinet's hole
how you so cleverly ran into hiding when
you sensed
that i was watching you -- intent on catching you
back into my hands...
I would stroke you behind your right ear
and you would sit so quietly in my hand
as if you knew it was my way to show you
my love and affection for you...
I would coo to you ""hammie... you like eh?""
and in silent response, you would sit there 
and enjoy being sayanged...
It was horrible to see you sick
and it was even worse to have to think
that you were old 
and could be dying.
I watched helpless and worried, as the lumps
grew on your body
and finally, when it grew under your chin
I knew, it wasn't long till the end.
Hammie, I miss you so much
You may have been very small
but you gave so much in making me happy...
I was racked with pain to watch you 
heave each laboured breath through
your small helpless frame.
I was afraid that you were suffering
and I didn't want you to bear it alone...
I tried to give you comfort, stroking you gently
and praying to God and St. Francis to ease your
pain...
and then
you breathed your last
and left...
Animals are said to not have souls
but watching you die
made me think otherwise...
I held you in my hand, cradled you for the last time
and you were silent and still
and I closed your eyes for you
and sent you to sleep...

Good bye Hammie...
I hope you knew that I love you
and I always will...

Hammie S. F.

i won't cry, i'd be sorry no more...

-- erasure.

had a talk with lin.
she's feeling the same way i am...
i suggested we both go see the psychiatrist since we're presenting the same problems.
she laughed.

it was funny

yet, so un-funny.

so what's happening to us?

we're looking for answers that we can't find.  and that's always a terrible situation to be in."

"event","there are some days when i think i'm going crazy:
today's one of them.
i was sitting there, in front of the students, as they were doing their backdated assignments, marking.
and i thought -- one day i'd probably shriek and scream at them till high heaven, till i'm all red and blue in my face... and it'd be ugly... 
and i smiled at that thought.

and that was -- scary."

"event","... 10 more weeks of this before I get a real holiday!

Well, technically so, but in reality, it's going to be a good 12 weeks to the actual holidays... and that's a prudent wish. Ha!

The holidays have been quite good, given that I managed to vege out a bit, but there was the usual hiccups with the publication of the newsletter that translated into many wasted man-hours... that was really TERRIBLY irritating, cos' it's such a sheer waste of time.  Hated it!  All that indeterminate waiting, and waiting... there are only so many ways to twiddle one's thumbs.
If I'm wasting time the way I want to waste it, it's fine!
But not if someone's wasting my time in a way I don't want to waste it...

Well, looks like I've become quite cranky...

Anyway, the one good day was Thursday when I went to Keppel Club with my 2 good girlfriends and had a great day in the pool...
It was really bittersweet to re-visit that place, especially the pool -- where Min used to bring me for our swims.

We used to take the bus ride from home all the way to Keppel Club and take a walk in or when he could get hold of the BMW, we'd drive there... those were such idyllic times... and being there last Thursday, just got me feeling real sore.

I miss him.

And it hurts.

Sometimes, I wonder what's wrong with me... why can't I let go and move on?  Why is it that my life is so complicated?  And I, so confused...

I wonder where Min is now, and how he is...

I hope I have a better day ahead, a better week... but till I'm at peace, I don't think I'd ever find that equilibrium... yet, it's something that I'm still trying to reach...
I know it doesn't really make sense, but I'm trying to make it all make sense, and sometimes, I think it's just a joke.

Hope I got it right."

i've got fatigue...

today, we had inter-class debates and so, 3 periods of English flew by...  I'm so thankful for that.

I've got a few things to jot down and think and talk about, but at the moment, I'm just too pooped to do so.
Hopefully, I'd be better later.  :)

going to take a shower and have dinner now."

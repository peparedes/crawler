"event","Okay, recently I have not had a lot of things to say (well, I have, but not really interesting, and too drama queen-esque for my tastes and etc). I still don't. So instead how about some exerpts (I'll pretend/hope that's close to the real spelling) from a young girl's magazine:

<lj-cut text=""I wouldn't click this if I was you. It goes on too long and it's the result of frustrated tired agonizing over work, which makes madness apparently. I mean, it's not a rant, but it's perhaps just as bad. It might be one of those things which results in the loss of brain cells."">
<lj-cut>
<li><b>When I woz eating dinner at my boyfriend's house I woz laughing + choked on my crush + now I have a massive bruise on my forehead. Doh!</b> 

I know what you're thinking. How <i>do</i> you choke on a crush randomly? Unless it is some sort of drink, like Raspberry or Cranberry Crush. Well, sorry to spoil the novelty, but I actually just read the page wrong and blended two different excellent tales together.

<li><b>I was wandering around TopShop the other day when I spotted a girl wearing a gorgeous pair of shoes. I was keen to get a closer look and wasn't watching where I was going when I crashed straight into a shop mirror, which sent me flying backwards into a clothes rail.</b>

The whole story implies no injury, so it does have the potential for humour. However I've decided to spice it up a little to make it more obvious, and into something that would earn the Star Letter position (if there is one):

<b>I was wandering around TopShop the other day when I spotted myself. I was keen to get a closer look and crashed straight into the shop mirror, which sent me flying backwards whilst slowly circling my arms. I tumbled dramatically into a clothes rail which turned out to be Simon Cowel.</b>

On second thoughts, there is no way to rewrite this story to Star Letter material (even after considering adding LOLs everywhere and coming up with the totally sensical and great acronym (seriously, my spelling is usually better than this): LO-LA [laughing out lower abdomen]). Maybe with another situation. But that's for another time.

BUT there is time and potential to create a Star Letter by Frankensteining the other letters, presenting:

<li><b>The band I sing in was wandering around TopShop in my maths lesson. Recently the netball team started flirting with my crush Matt. The stylist was at a friend's party and wanted to impress everyone to kill time from the buffet. 

A fit guy was messing around with my mobile phone when I was dancing in front of a hot guy who spotted a girl wearing a gorgeous pair of shoes, revealing my ancient off-white bra! Not only was he [then] in scolding pain, he was also soaking wet. He didn't look too impressed and moved to another carriage at home for privacy. 

Last week it was raining and I slipped and landed in everyone. Even my burning monsters and ghosts kept jumping out dressed as a zombie, making me scream and grab my teacher's hand. After a while I realised why they were staring at me: my pink boob tube had fallen down in what I thought was a seductive way. Eww! The audience howled with laughter.</b>

I know she isn't talking about her boyfriend; I know that's just about the first person she's ever gotten intimato with (only metaphorical vegetables involved), and apparently she has a huge aversion to porn and has (unsuccessfully) banned her significant other from it.

It doesn't matter anyway because we concluded it was 'a curse rather than a gift', and then she started talking about ropes and pulleys."

And I got loads of heavy stuff. So I ""borrowed"" a trolley because by then I guess I must have had ten chickens. And then I went to Schuh. And told them all to get as many shoes (cue me pointing and pointing at various converse and trainer types) as they could in size 5 1/2 to 6 because I couldn't remember my actual shoe size.

As if having some sort of random stomach ache all the way through PE and a bit before, as well as randomly feeling sick here and there (though, I never throw up so I don't have to worry about that), was not enough, I felt as if <b>everyone was out to tackle me to the ground in revenge</b> for something I'd done to them in a previous life.

Maybe I'm exaggerating. Okay, I <i>am</i> exaggerating, <i>but</i>, one of my friends bumped into the other one while she was standing next to me, and she's the sort of person to just... Go down. But she tried to stop herself, sort of, by grabbing onto me. Really, clinging, it kinda hurt but that wasn't the main thing on my mind. I was stumbling, trying to stand upright while she pulled me down. She kept pulling <i>after she was on the ground</i>. So, naturally <b>I fell too</b> after some more stumbling. Got up sharpish, and helped her up a moment later. Luckily, no one noticed because they were all too busy crowding around a hate letter to our Headteacher. Which the supply didn't mind, just letting them know they had 2 more minutes to work on it.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for snoozeworthy talking on the headteacher in question"">
<lj-cut>
It would be a bad move for me to parade around talking the wonders about our headteacher, since anyone can tell she's not the friendliest person ever, but she is <i>good</i> for the school. I mean, guh, can people not see that? The worst she's done is to stop our year hanging around town like they used to at lunch times if they got a pass - you have to go home like everyone else. That kind of sucked, since it would have been the first year a lunch pass would have interested me.</lj-cut>

Later, during the PE lesson, I was marking this boy in Netball, when we later played a mini-game which was quite good since our team was all girls and we were passing great and just generally winning all of it, after the teacher instructed me and another girl to run out then back for the ball, I got all prepped to do it, and as soon as the whistle blew, I went out <b>and the boy RAN INTO ME</b>.

Really. Hard. And he did it on purpose. At first I was just thinking, ""What...?"" because, who <i>runs into someone</i> in a non-contact game. Thankfully, my gathered running power or whatnot, just meant it was like <b>running against a wall</b>, without falling over, so I wasn't embarrassed. A little peeved off that no one noticed, and we couldn't get some sort of penalty for it, but other than that OK. 

And sometime before that in the lesson, one of the other boys interrupted to tell the teacher <b>a man over there</b> *points past wire fences a few hundred metres away* <b>was recording us</b>. That was creepy. Everyone turned to stare, and the man sure enough was holding a camera phone which probably took videos. He wasn't directing it at us by then at least, I caught him sort of moving a little to turn and aim to take a picture of a car. At first, since I hadn't really heard what was going on, I thought the boy might have said something about him being suspicious and stealing from a car, trying to figure out whether that connected with taking pictures of it.

Everyone watched as he got into his car, backed up a little, not sure whether he was waiting for us to look away before coming out again. No one did, of course. The teacher didn't say anything either, she was just watching. Everyone stared as he left. It was just one of those 'Huh' moments. The teacher didn't say much about it, except to clarify he was recording the group with the boy, and I guess she was just more weary about whoever stood there.

Wowza, I can drag out a teeny portion of the day. Because this day was interesting to me, I'm bolding certain parts so YOU will be drawn towards it.

I also stayed after school till almost 5pm to do some work which I need to hand into tomorrow, and made a very full page. But not one that needs to be in tomorrow."

After he was done telling us to which we couldn't help but politely agree, I tried to convince ma copine to follow her ruler's movements. I didn't realise I was proving the teachers point, whilst he was there (talking to another amie in front of us), until she told me. 

Hee. A bunch of people noticed I dyed my hair and mentioned it. The comments were pretty much overall good, or at least not bad. I was expecting some teasing since it's school after all. The worst I got was one boy saying first I'd dyed my hair a bit red, then orange to which I said I <i>had</i> rubbed an orange over it and I supposed he rubbed a lemon over his (it was a boy who dyed his hair some sort of crazy yellow in what one would suspect was a drug induced urge). Then he (yes, he did keep circling the room... Many, many times...) named it ginger. But, I can't say I was offended by anything he said, it wasn't really mean.

Sadly, I cannot go and dance in it or the thundery sounding goodness, for I will probably not be allowed, and due to the fact I am not dressed well enough to do so, though in trying to change that fact it does beg the question how <i>do</i> you dress for rain?

I can't believe I haven't been having more ice recently.

ICE ALL THE WAY FROM NOW ON.

Including other stuff... Especially since my family is encouraging me to get a takeaway for some obscure reason. In fact, I refused one this evening, because I just wasn't hungry, and yet the options were all there, for favourites or otherwise. Some sort of conspiracy to make me gain weight, hm? Though I believe it was only yesterday I had a takeaway again! Madness!

And a <i>long</i> time ago an ex-friend made me a Best hits of Reel Big Fish CD, which I've never looked after very carefully like many of my burnt CDs, and was playing recently. It was fine after all the time sitting <i>exposed</i>, but then it's in the hi-fi for one day and next thing I know it's covered in scratches and some of the later songs go all sort of funny. I've cleaned it to no avail. Eeeh. 

But I know it's not the hi-fi. It's just nonsensical and some sort of mad fluke that it could work beforehand with the marks.

In other news: More gold from X Factor. I hate it when they beg to them to pass through though - just wait and see what they say. They're not going to be <i>more convinced</i> but your desperate pleas as soon as you've finished singing."

Just, <i>please</i>... I hope Eugene doesn't win. <lj-cut text=""Continue to read Big Brother blah blah ness""><lj-cut>He <i>took</i> the money, which I just thought was unfair of the whole idea to even be there in the first place. Plus, I thought he was Super Moral Man? It's too difficult to accept scones and tea, but not this? I know there's a <i>huge</i> difference, but I think he would have probably won anyway if he'd refused it.

So... DON'T WIN NOW. He deserves to lose. He got his payment, he seemed like a super nice guy but there've been murmurings under his breath, showing not only is he ""Oh, yeah, human..."" but actually, a little bit sinister... I certainly don't act like that, and wouldn't want to know someone who does. If you have a problem with someone you have a normal argument or don't try to hide it or say straight out insults quietly! 

Plus; boring. INCREDIBLY BORING. Almost to the point of unfunniness that he's funny... But I don't see it. Others say it, but it certainly doesn't make me laugh. I've met people similar to that in real life and it makes me feel uncomfortable because I always try and politely laugh. I thought it was stupid when that ooooooother suuuuuuuuuuuuper boring Cameron guy won it however long ago, SO DON'T SUPPORT ANOTHER BORINGO.

I have no idea who I'm talking to. I'm just worried he's going to win. Even though it doesn't really matter as a key issue in relation to everything else. It really sucks, 'cause the British public seem to latch onto some of the worst characters - I remember another guy, Jaaaason (me and my friends were just talking about it yesterday), who was so HORRIBLE and GRUMPY and he was there until... Uh, last three I think. Unbelievable.

Since I'm English, I'm under the impression we're great (like other nationalities of course, except I don't watch their Big Brother... But I bet they don't keep MIND NUMBINGLY BORING no matter how sweet they may appear with mousey cheese nibbling teeth-people in), and... Too cool to vote for these people. Now, we don't vote, but if we did I can assure you it would be for someone else. Probably Makosi if I had any say, because yes she's some sort of compulsive liar or something, but that makes her much more interesting, if a little crazy.

Stopping going on now, so I can catch the rest. DON'T WIN DON'T WIN DON'T WIN EUUUUUUUUUUBORRRRE.

"event","Today in the afternoon, me and two friends made a film. I thought for once we wouldn't argue, since the real arguer of the group seemed to have calmed down after the lesson previously where I got agitated and told her basically to stop picking fights. But after figuring out I hadn't fully figured out my camera, and then re-figuring it out and figuring it out that I still hadn't figured out everything and figuring we had to start again, I wasn't in the mood to sellotape on my fake beard once more and attempt the psychiatrist scenes, with Larky seemingly not knowing when to stop and get the best shot. I'll admit, I was a completely terrible camera woman, but I knew when to stop, and didn't have to wait for gestures from the actresses!

But anyway, I really enjoyed directing, though only doing one very small role got snide comments from arguement-girl once again, who we can't kick out of our group or anything since she's a friend and would have nowhere else to go, and then there'd just be two of us. She's not a bad person, just quite grouchy and moody. Well, <i>too bad</i> anyway - I was just going to continue being the camera woman! And I did so, and my directions did not work too well as they seemed unable to shape their faces into the needed emotions and grinned when they were meant to be terrified, but it wasn't a bad thing I suppose since it was meant to be a comedy at the core of it all <3

The end result: humorous. Difficult to understand, and bad camera handling and scene backgrounds, but ultimately good, even if some were slow off the bat/cue to do what they were meant to, and one certain should-be-killer had to be instructed to <i>chase</i> the victim, turning around and asking at the very end. Ah, yes :)"

"event","I'm feeling decidedly more chirpy even after an annoying day, which wasn't so bad, except for the unexpected and shocking end, which I think we all handled quite well but won't get into. But anyway, now everything is good and well and tomorrow is a new day! I've written a looong complaint letter about a member of staff at our school, as has my friend, and our parents and we'll be handing it all in tomorrow :)"

"event","Summer holidays, roll around for me. I can't even take the work experience any more, the thought it pains me, can't you see? I'm tired of all the exams, even though they've been and gone, and everyone's being grouchy and a total waste of space - except the friends I call friends. Oooh, tired, tired! I'm too tired to stay up late, and I'm too tired in the morning. The summer and the sitting and the working and the weather and the everything, it all makes me tired."

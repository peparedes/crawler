Seems I missed some heavy display of affection a bit back there.  Thank god, that would have made my week that more hellish having the image of nude twins inscribed in my mind.  

Tomorrow afternoon my punishment begins.  I better get hot pulling weeds tomorrow, definetely do NOT want to be caught out after dark."

"event","Ah crikey the giant chrysanthemum got loose.  I gotta find it before Professor Matsumori does.  If anyone sees a pinkish flower the size of a miniature schauzer creeping around dragging a clod of dirt behind it, tell me!!!!  And don't touch it!  I haven't quite figured out if it's just a plant or if it's carnivorous..."

"event","First day back and my side of the dorm room already looks like I've been living here for a few months.  Meh, the ""lived in"" look works well for me.  Hopefully my new roomie won't be too bugged by it.  He's so immaculate... it's almost unhuman..."

"event","India has been absobloodylutely WONDERFUL this summer!  I've been so busy I haven't even gotten a chance to update.  Ah well, no time like the present eh?

Mum and Dad took me and Dom back to India this summer.  We visited all of our old friends, hiked in the jungles, and, though the 'rents promised it was strictly a pleasure trip, checked out a few old monasteries and shrines.  not that I minded in the least, it was really fun.  Didn't have any run-ins with bats, thank God, though i did see a horde of them on the skyline near dusk.  Ugh, I hate the disease carrying little buggers.

Well, now I'm back in DC, not much to report on that, not much going on.  I may go down to the Smithsonian later, or maybe hit Mel's bookstore to see if he got in the herbology book I ordered.  

Cheers!"

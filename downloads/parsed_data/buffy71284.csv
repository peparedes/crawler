I know that I am doing something wrong but I just find myself not caring. I should care cause I always feel guilty and I am making certain people mad at me. I guess it takes willpower and that is something I still have to acquire. On a side note I am a sucker and I need to stop that. I am too emotional about everything and I just jump into so many things without thinking. It may seem right in the heat of the moment but I always regret. UGGGGHHHH. 

Today seems like the night that so many past memories have been like shoved into my mind. I will be just doing my thing when I will see someone who brings back both painful and joyous memories. One simple hello and I don't know how to act or what to do. I know I look like an idiot but what can I do? Or a song just hits home. Today I saw a car and I was reminded of so many things. How ridiculus. While I do believe that I have grown I know that there are so many things left to learn. Now most readers will have stopped reading by now but I am going to treck on.

It's funny cause i don't want to be with this certain person but I let stupid things bother me even though he drives me crazy. I know that I really like this other person and things are going well. I am just scared that I am going to get hurt in the end. Isn't it interesting how past relationships can have a huge effect on how you act in the present. In one instance the person changed and we just grew apart even though I think if I wouldn't have ended things and been more understanding we might still be together. Another time I risked my job for something that I was forcing just because it wasn't allowed. Hmmmmm let's see.....I guess it all started in the freaking 11th grade when i fell madly in love with my best friend who broke my heart and then a year later was in love with me while I was with someone else. That someone else turned out to be the cliche first true love. I don't even know what I am saying anymore.....I am just going on and on and about what BOYS! See that is how pathetic I have become...I am obviously not an independent women and feel it necessary to have a man in my life at all times. I was home this weekend and it was brought to my attention that I always have a boyfriend, of course in this moment I don't exactly but something is going on. Anyway I looked back and realized that from my senior year of high school to now I have been single a total of about 4 months. I am still deciding if that is something to be proud of. I am beginning to wonder what it is that I want or need rather then what the person I am with wants or needs. Perhaps now is the time to be selfish and not settle for anything less then the best. 

I am graduating in a little over a year and trust me I have a lot to show for it, but is the substance there. Am I a dense person with nothing to offer. I mean I like to think that I am fun but am I someone worth ""getting to know"". These are all questions that I think about that i really shouldn't have to worry about. I should have enough confidence in myself to be happy with the person that I am but.....



this is way to long and I am sorry if you read it....pretty pointless actually."

These next two weeks will either make me or break me and the way that i roll it will make me! I have so much stuff. I feel like I am studying every free moment i have. 

Tomorrow is 6 grade camp and I am super excited!!!! I have to get up at 6 in the morning but I am sure it will be worth it! 

I suppose that is it. I got nothing juicy for you cause really at this time i am pretty drama free. I got my friends and family and I am happy. Relationships have mended and some are becoming more comfortable. This girl can not complain and that is fo sho! I am trying to be smart and make good decisions and I think I am finally getting the hang of that. I guess it just takes some people longer then others and for me it was a long road. I am not the same person that I was a year ago, 6 months ago, or even a month ago. I have grown and learned a lot! Praise the Lord!!!!"

Mock Rock is going really well. I was nervous when not that many people showed up but our group is very enthusiastic and really quick learners. It also helps when your best friend gets you a little pumped. 

Being so anal retentive it is hard for me to just go with the flow especially when it comes to relationships but for the first time i am doing that. I am just letting things happen and not forcing anything. Surprisingly it seems to be working.....and I can't be happier. Besides a few moments of drama that could have easily been avoided if people would just mind their own business. 

Senior year is rocking my world. All of my friends rock and I just love that I can just show up and we can start partying like it is 1999.


Update: I am helping out at a middle school on Wednesdays! I am going to be a substitute teacher! I am a chemistry tutor....need some help??? Give me a call. I got asked if I was a dancer (HA), but not a stripper dancer just a normal dancer. I love my roomies! I love the terrace! I love hott history professor from Britain. I LOVE the big comfy bed!!! HOLLA!!

Peace out ya'll and have a fantastic week!"

Other then the above display of frustration life is great! I got back from working a weekend at home and it was good to bring in the cash flow. I also feel like i got closer to someone up here in the Peezy area even though i was 2 hours away. I never knew talking on the phone could be so chill! Anyway I am excited for the new happenings in my life and for once i am just gong with the flow. Yes I have put to rest the old control freak that i can be. I am much more focused on the positve and making myself happy!  

I made brownies yesterday and I didn't burn them so that is a first and a great feat!

I may get a job this year and that would relieve some pressure, however so far everything i say i am going to do this year gets shot down so we shall see. Wish me luck cause i could use some mulla!!

Here's to a great week and an even greater weekend to come!"

I love how things can be going well and then a friend just tells you to go away or tells you they are too busy for you. I love how you think you can be over an ex boyfriend but somehow they end up in your mind again. Even if you think they are being shady. I love how there is one person who has helped this entire night and he has only known me for about a week. I love how all my thoughts and feelings turn to sadness and i feel the only way people will like me is if i am not sober. I love how i think i have moved on but clearly have problems excepting the future. I love how life is fun one minute and just plain shit the next. I love how my best friend is upset and I can't even help her. I love how yet again I am all alone and no one is here to be with me. I am done and over with this bullshit. I thought things were so good until i drank a little bit and realized who my true friends are.

I love how i am all alone. I look left and I look right and no one is there. I am the reason for everyone's laughter, I am the person everyone points at and says man that girl is hammered or that girl is so drunk she would have sex with me or anybody. I will wake tomorrow and be done with this sorrow but I will not forget the events or happenings that this night has taught me. I must be catious, trust is too easily given by me and not easily recipricated.

Unlike the last time we broke up I really haven't cried and I almost feel relieved. It is like this pressure to have a working relationship has lifted. While I hope that we remain friends I know it will be hard in the upcoming weeks. 

I also am very content today, because after a long standing battle a old friend and I have made up and there seems to be no one in the way of making our friendship work. I am excited for a new and closer relationship...this person knows who they are!

I am also grateful for new friends who have this weird talent in that they can say all the right words at the right time.

I am also amazed at how Rae and I are so close! Though people try to get in the way, we understand each other and know what is up!

I love my classes, I know that sounds corny but I do! I must admist despite the adversities, i think this year is going to be great!"

Besides the fact that I have to do all this stuff to student teach and graduate, I am having a good first week so far.  I also have come to some realizations: 1.) While sometimes Nate is not the greatest at showing his love for me there are just these moments when he does something small or nothing at all and I am overcome by my love for him. Even though he may be sick and crouchy these last couple of days I am trying to understand and we are actually getting along pretty well. The room mate situation is going great so far and the only problem I forsee is that our floor will be super wild. I had two classes today and they were both pretty good. Tomorrow I have three and two of them are history classes! I know this is corny but I am actually excited to go to school. Plus the football game this weekend will be great!

"event","I am very tired of feeling unwanted by my own boyfriend. It seems as though I always pick the guys who say they love you but don't show it. I must be a magnet to the type of guy who doesn't like physical contact or flattering his girlfriend. I also think that when I get mad about an ex-girlfriend calling 3 times in one day that is justified, NOT overreacting. I also love how so many guys tell if they were in a relationship with me they would treat me like a princess and give me the world. I tell these men that I have a boyfriend. In return they say that he is a very lucky man. Well I think that somehow this ""lucky man"" is about to ""let me down easy"" and say the hell with me.

"event","I realize that while I may be lame for watching laguna beach I sure as heck am addicted to that show. ( I totally bought the dvd)  So Rae and I have a room mate. Another year together with a new friend. While I am super excited, I am also super nervous. I just have to trust that God led this person into my life and I was led into theirs for a reason. I have to keep the faith. 

I miss Rae soooooo much. It is like having a piece of me gone only to return when I go to Mount Pleasant. I just want her to return safely so we can have a kick ass year!!!!!

I also miss Josh, playing mini golf was tons of fun but I can't wait till we hang out even more! Especially if we do some real golfing, in a cart, with some special beverages (hahahahaha). 

This year is going to be fun, challenging, and so very unpredictable. In years past I have known exactly what is to become of me. What leadership roles i wanted, my ambitions, everything. Now I am going into my senior year wishing and hoping for nothing. I am not planning nor strategizing. I am taking each moment as it comes and not being such a tight ass. If anything, this summer has taught me that everything in yor life is not stable. In fact there will be many moments that you can't control. I just need to relax and have a good time. In the words of someone i met this summer, ""you just need to take each situation as it comes, evaluate it, and decide how valuable it will be in your life"". 

There will be struggles this year, I can feel it. But I can also feel a sense of calm. This calmness is guided by the fact that I have a good support system, a good attitude, and trust in something that is far bigger than myself.....aka the LORD!"

I won't write about my problems cause they are too damn personal. To be honest, isn't the point of a journal to have no inhibitions and to just be free with words. This is not the way to go I suppose. I think I was done a long time ago!

I came home to find that things with my grandpa Z were not that great. We visited him a lot and I have never prayed so much and finally my prayers were answered. The Lord took my grandpa (poppa) at 11:30 on May 8th. I just have to say that though it is sad, he is in a better place. He had cancer and a heart condition, he could have been in a lot of pain.

He was and is a great man, who served Detroit as a Sergeant in the police force. He was a big joke teller and a great laugher. He loved his family but especially loved his wife...his little sweetie.

His death is hard on me because he is the first person that I really was close to, that died. I just have mixed emotions but I know that I will miss him. I also know that he is watching over all of us and laughing because he knows that he was part of a crazy family. (crazy in a good way)"

"event","The year in a nutshell:

Started the year in a hall that I grew to love and cherish. Had a job that I thought was perfect for me and my personality. Got confused about my position and psuedo fell in love. In other words I wanted what I couldn't have and got lost in translation. So started to secretly date boy who was probably just using me or just wanted me cause i was not to be had. Anyways got my heart broken. Broke up with the boy from St. Louis, who was not this secret love affair. (yes these characteristics are very unlike me). I got caught as an RA drinking in a dorm room with residents and lost my job. Oh yeah and I made a new best friend and lost him within two months

Had a rough couple of months. Thought my life was over, and thought i was the biggest screw up to exist. Moved into an apartment by myself and really took my new found independence too far. Had a couple of drunken nights. Had A TON of self image issues, (still working on that), and had many a nervous break downs. I found out who my best friend really was, as we have gotten through so much together and I owe so much to her. And just when I had hit rock bottom, if not lower, I was pulled out of the darkness. I met this amazing man who has never once hesitated to make me happy, safe, and loved. I realized that the Lord is there for me and comforts me when I feel alone. My family never has never past judgement on me or made me feel like I wasn't good enough. Things began to look up.

PRESENT DAY:

I am mending those friendships that matter, and though I am hesitant to get involved I am beginning to. I am completely in love and making decisions that are smart and healthy. While not everything is perfect and sometimes I still feel like I am going toward that darkness again, I press on and remember who I love and those who love me. Yes this year has been rough and while 6 months ago i feared that I had let the world down I have realized that those who really care about you stick with you even in the worst of times. And those that run away or pretend not to see me, I tell them kiss my ass cause you are missing out. I mean come on.... i can cook now...I am still a princess but sometimes I get on my hands and knees and wash my kitchen floor."

Anyway, as i was saying, I was cycling got this nose thing going on, except i didn't realize I had this nose issue and it was dark in the cycling room so i couldn't see. Good thing I had a towel.....and a shirt. Anyway i was totally impressed by the amount of fun and work it was, but I was a little tramatized if you know what i mean. 

I got a C on my organic test, which was a 50%. Think about it, the curve is so bad that I failed miserably and still got a C. I think this teacher needs to reevaluate. He could learn a thing or two from the education cohorts (ha)!

I just want to have MY boyfriend on my side to support me and love me and understand me. I mean this is not the end of our relationship by any means, but it just proof that nothing is perfect, though it is pretty darn good.

My mom wanted to buy me some pink stellatos and my dad called someone a douchbag. Let's just say it was hilarious. Anyway i did miss Nate a lot but I also wanted him to be having fun at all of his party's. It seems that when i go home there is always a million things that i miss but that is ok.

My aunt's baby shower was good, won a candle...and a holder...gotta love that. I can't wait for this baby, i told them i would babysit anytime. 

Made mucho money working on Friday and that made me happy, however i spilled ice tea on some guy (this was the first time this has happened, i swear!!!)

I bought a new watch (pink with bling of course) and some sunglasses (bling bling fo sho). 

Back to the pink stellatos, can you believe that in all of Lakeside mall there were none in my size. I mean did all the girls with giant feet get there before me. I have big feet and not that many people wear my size, especially teenage girls, needless to say i was very upset. I am sure Nate was happy though cause when i wear heels i am almost taller then him and you know how guys are, they get intimidated about everything (I love you Nate and i know you don't really care!!)

Well that is all, finished a big EDU assignment and i am going to go to the SAE basketball game, gotta support my man and the true gentlemen!! I have to make a consious effort to get out there and not be shy with them, they are really nice guys!!!!"

"event","A girl and guy are speeding over 100 mph on the road on a motorcycle. 
Girl: Slow down. Im scared
Guy: No this is fun
Girl: No its not. Please, it's too scary
Guy: Then tell me you love me
Girl: Fine, I love you, but slow down
Guy: Now give me a BIG hug
Girl hugs him
Guy: Can you take my helmet off & put it on yourself? Its bugging me
In the paper the next day: A motorcycle crashed into a building last night because of break failure. Two people were involved, a male and a female, but only 1 survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the 18 year old boy realized that his breaks had broke, but he didn't want to let his partner know. Instead, he made her say she loved him and felt her hug one last time, and let her wear his helmet so that she would live, realizing he would be the one that would die. If there's anyone you love this much, re-post this in your journal 


I know this is corny, but i almost cried....
It's been a tough week and i know that it is only going to get worse but i have some people in my life (they know who they are) that won't let me get down and always have a way of making me feel better....my sister, my mother, and Nate...this week they have been my saving grace!!! Now onto paper # 2 of 3 i am cranking those bitches out!!!!"

"event","2005!!!!!!! A new year with new opportunities and many changes!

A recap.....2004 was rough for me! It started out with a heartbreak...continued with a rebound relationship, then continued with another boy...what was his name? Just kidding, I got the RA job i always wanted! I actually loosened up a little bit and had some much needed fun! Summer was great with trips to Canada with work friends.....then the shit hit the fan when i came back up to school! I got into something i knew wouldn't work and was forbidden, then i just went crazy!!! I really let go of myself and allowed a few mistakes to shape the rest of my year.

All in all the things that have happened to me are for the best. By being in that unhealthy, forbidden relationship, i learned that i can be rejected as well as do the rejecting. I may have gotten fired but i gained some independence and i also have an amazing man in my life...who is a positive force in my life. I also learned who my friends really were. When times were the toughest i learned who was really on my side. Though at the beginning of the school year he was a couple blocks away, josh melvin knew what i needed and that was just for someone to listen. Rae is my God sent angel, she knows what i feel and she understood me, i love her so much, she is just so much a part of my life and there are just those people that God send into your life, because He knows you will be so connected...so bonded! 

Anyway with this new year of course i have some new year's resolutions but i know that they are not that important. I just know that i have to stay true to myself and do what i know is right!


Happy 2005 everyone!!"

I have all the Christmas shopping done which means i am not allowed to shop for the next three months unless it is for food! I am so bad at spending money, i think this might be a medical problem!! Just Kidding!

Met Nate's family and they all seemed super nice, i especially like Grandma Livingston....we seemed to click.

Anyway...I am off to see meet the Fockers! I hope it is funny! I really want to see Phantom too!

Good luck to everyone on their grades, and if you know when we get them leave me a little comment....cause my mother is anxious to know! Not really me...just my mother!

Happy Holidays, and Merry Christmas!!!"

"event","So i have this entry that i should write about a certain someone in my life.

The truth is, there is no words to describe, i am wrapped up in you and I love it. I can look into your eyes forever and never get tired. Those eyes tell me so much and I could listen until the end of time. When i get crazy you put up with me and let me go, you laugh when i laugh and you cry when i cry. We talk for hours about anything and everything. In your arms i am free and comforted. I know that you will look out for me and never let any harm come to me. The time i spend with you is always fun filled and exciting, even if we are just sitting on a couch watching tv. You fascinate me so much that i know i can never get tired of you.

I have had boyfriends before, and i have thought that i had certain feelings but this, what we have, is so real. I mean i feel like i am in a dream but you are my reality. When we are together it is Nate and Jessica world and while other people matter, we are lost in eachother. I know that other people see it, cause the love that i have for you cannot be contained, it shines through in my every action. What started out as a friendship with its quirks has turned into something so much deeper and better! You are my shining star, YOU Nate Tallman are MY number 1.

You alone take my breath away!"

"event","The time has come my fellow college students to study like we have never studied before.

For once i did not get off the hook with a couple easy finals, this semester all my finals will be hard and i actually have to make a huge effort. I have been studying for Michigan History and average 3 hours a day, I know this may sound crazy but i don't want to have that feeling that i could have studied more. The only problem is i have 3 other finals that i need to start thinking about.

I guess lately i have just noticed that i have been living in my own little world and i just forgot how petty the outside world can be. I guess since i am out of Barnes I expected to be away from all the drama but it turns out that is not the case. I truly believe that people are starting to get bored and so now they are starting to create the drama themselves and i want no part of that.

Christmas is coming and i have tons of shopping to do and no ideas for gifts....more on that later.

What is exciting is that i already got my Christmas gift from Nate. First i got a blanket....pink of course, and home made. I call it my cotton ball blanket (I love it!!) I also got a nice little basket filled with things that are for me to read only! (I super loved that!!!) Then I got this beautiful white gold necklace that has my initial and there seems to be some diamond like gems in there as well. (I seriously wear it everyday). Although i assured Nate that i would be fine with practically nothing I am so happy and grateful for the gifts i received. He is an amazing man (not just because he bought me gifts), we have this like thing going on that is too big for me to explain and since i don't want to jinx it i will leave it to your imagination but just know that i am happy and having him in my life is doing great things for me! 

All this studying is giving me a headache!"

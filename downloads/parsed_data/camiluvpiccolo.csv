I hold on to the good memories to help ease the pain, and yet at the same time it's the holding on that makes the pain so much worse. The fact that I hold on to everything and never let anything go...is that bad? Do you think it does more harm than good? I save every thing. Random things that to a normal person my seem like trash like, all my concert programs and stuff animals and other toys from my childhood; random worksheets from my biology class sophmore year, and of course the endlees mound of cards from birthdays, when I was in the hospital, Christmas, thank yous from different people, and invitations.

So what?! Who cares?! you go it done didn't you? well if you really think about it, it's not procrastination at all, because you were wasting time. We get things done according to what needs to be done first or according to what takes <EM>priority</EM>. See it's not procrastinating, it's prioritizing. Have a Nice Day! </FONT></STRONG>"

Than I had Ashleys grad. party, then I had Elise's surprise b-day party...I think I said all this already but whatever. I soooo much to do before my party, I have to finish my room and put all my stuff away (finally) and the dining room needs to be painted. Away at Ashley's I met on of her friends from school who is a Phantom fan and a Jane Austin junkie like me. Jane Austin is the author of my favorate book; Pride and Prejudice. This started out as my favorate because it's kind of chick flick-ish but really it's because I can relate to the characters so much. Mr. Darcy's a jurk but being mean is kind of his defense mechanism and his way of hinding how uncomfortable he is when he's around strangers. This, for those of you who don't know me, is very much like me. When I get around people I don't know it's like I freeze up or something. I'll just stand there like a stick and not say anything, unless someone comes and talks to me. Then there is Elizabeth, who waltzes to her own tune and does whatever the heck she feels like and deffise all social rules. Then I was singing ""I remember there was mist..."" from the Phantom and we got talking about the musical and the movie and how there's a lot of people who don't like the guy who plays the Phantom and how the were very mild about his messed up face...ect. well I guess that's it. I'm tired, I need to go to sleep.</STRONG></FONT></P>"

<P><FONT color=#009900 size=5>yah moving wasn't fun. people came over on sat. and moved some stuff into the pod. Elise slept over my house and we watched 13 going on 30 and the prince and me. that was nice cuz I haven't been able to hang w/ Elise sense last summer cuz were both soooo busy. we talked till 2 in the morning. Then sunday night was the last night I slept in my house. I slept on the floor of my room b/c my beds were already taken apart and put on the pod. I've never cried and felt sooo missurable in my life I thought I'd die, I felt so awfull. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#009900 size=5>then the next day I had preseason and we marched around inside b/c of the rain. then when I got home I just laid on my bedroom floor and cried some more. then later people came over to help finish moving.

I ca't believe that in just a matter of hours I will say good-bye to the only home I ever known--well that's not entirely true b/c the Labbes were like a second family and a second home, speaking of which I saw Heather last night and she's pregnant, #4 and I almost cried. she was there to see her Mom come home from alabama. I think I'll go down stairs just to see who's down there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#009900 size=5>and that's all of the documentry and I did really good I didn't cry all week over the house. I think It was b/c I was so busy w/ preseason and which on tues I got burt really really bad. but I didn't do it on pupose. I have been know not to put sunscreen on b/c I want to get&nbsp;a tan, but this time I really just forgot.&nbsp;but the rest of the week I put stuff on so I wouldn't get burt any more. so anyways I was doing good cring wise over the house, untill friday, the closing day. I went to preseason and got there at 7:30 like I always do b/c my mom needs to get to work on time so I was there doing set up stuff and I had to leave and go get my yearbook pics. done at 9:00 inside the school and I saw my friends Erica and Tom. do you guys remember them. well any ways I got my pics done and so did they and then we talked and chilled in the hallway and then I remembered that my dad&nbsp;was sopossed to pick me up early around 2:00&nbsp;but I wasn't sure so&nbsp;I called him to just check and he was like I didn't know i was sopposed to pick you up and&nbsp;them he started freaking out and then I&nbsp;started freaking out and then I just kind of snapped and I started breatheing heavy and I was like I gotta go home. so&nbsp;I called my mom and told her that dad din't know&nbsp;he was sopposed to pick my up and she was like I know he just called me and then&nbsp;I was like mom I gotta go home I gotta go home and she was like ok Camille&nbsp;calm down and then&nbsp;I walked to the football feild where my new band&nbsp;derecter was w/ the band and I was like&nbsp;Miss. White I gotta go home and I started cring&nbsp;and of&nbsp;course she was like ah...are you ok. and I'm like NO!! I gotta go home and I told I was just upset cuz it was the day of&nbsp;the closing of&nbsp;the house that I've lived in all my life. she under stood and I went home. I worked out good b/c there was still alot of packing and cleaning to&nbsp;do. and I got to&nbsp;say good-bye to my house. and&nbsp;I got to keep&nbsp;the keys to my house.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#009900 size=5>so, can I just say that the specail mtgs. have been&nbsp;awesome!!!

"event","<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>I hate to be the bearer of bad news but, THE SUMMER IS ALMOST OVER!!!!! well we, H.A.'F.Y.C.,&nbsp;leave tomarrow night for N. Carolina. I'm a little&nbsp;scared and a little excited. what's really awesome, (for all of you who don't know) is that were running&nbsp;all 5 mtgs. there. It'll be like 5 youth nights in a row!&nbsp;it's awesome. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>well I'm gonna say it everyday untill they come to visit, I MISS TROY AND STACY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! However, I think ALL&nbsp;the Fraziers should come to visit, b/c I miss Rachel, Sarah and Joanna too. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>ok can I just say, that I am sooo grateful to know the Lord. Seriously, I don't know how people live their lives...b/c...ok...1st of all, to be unsure of what the future holds and to not know where you're going when you die, totally freaks me out! 2nd of all, I know that I'm never alone b/c God is always w/ me in what ever situation I face in life. 3rd, I know that my life has meaning, I know my life has purpise. If you can't live for God than what are you living for...just to breathe in and out every day and than die. It's no wonder the suicide rates go up day by day, b/c people don't know that their life can make a difference in others lives, even through their mistakes. And while I'm on this subject, don't ever use the stupid excuss that ""oh I'm only hurting myself, I'm not hurting anyone else"" b/c that is such a load of crap!!!! every thing you do in your life in going to effect and possably hurt at least one other person's life. and I'm not saying that you should be constently living your life for other people, I'm saying, don't take the impalse to do something stupid just b/c you think it's not hurting anyone else, b/c it will effect and hurt someone else. ok back to what I was talking about before. 4th, it's wonderful to know that when you're going though something, there is someone you can rely on through what ever it is and that just when you're just about to give up that's when the victory becomes in site, and if you can hold on for just a little longer, the victory is yours. People in the world don't have that. Yah I'm really thankful to know who God is. you know I was thinking about this the other day. sometimes it's&nbsp;hard for us kids who've grown up in church to really appreciate salvation b/c to us it comes so easilly, and sometimes it's just something we do, b/c we're tought that, that's how we make our way to heaven and it's just something that we're surrounded by. well I was thinking how when you grow up in the world and you're not saved and you get saved later on, your salvation means ever thing to you and if walking on your hands for the rest of your life was how you stayed saved, you'd do it, b/c your life has been changed. Not that for those of us who've grown up in church don't have a life changing experience, but most of us have good parents who are saved and we have peace in our homes and when we're sick or have a need they pray w/ us. And we know (b/c we're thought) that God will forgive us no matter what. Alot of people out in the world, who come to Christ don't have that, and when they find salvation it means soooo much to them. I've also come to be really thankful that I know the truth, and that I'm not living a lie. I really feel bad for people who do, and what's really upsetting, is that when you go to tell them the truth they don't what to hear it, but I least you've done&nbsp;your part in trying to bring truth to them. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Well I hope I wasn't just ramballing on forever and that somehow this has encoureged you in some way.</FONT></P>"

 ""He Kissed Away Her Tears""

V1) She came home late from work one day,
    Frustrated and worn 
    Tierd and Upset 
    He could tell that she had, had a hard day
    But because he loved her he knew just what to do.

C)And with hads of love he held her, 
  And laid her head on his shoulders, 
  And sweetly he stroked her,
  So she would feel secure.
  Then he Kissed away her tears,
  Taking the hurt and the fears,
  Even though her pain was his pain too,
  He'd thank God for every time he'd have the chance,
  To Kiss away her tears.

V2) Baby girl can't sleep tonight,
    Mommy started work again,
    Daycare's not a nice place to wake up in,
    He could tell that she had, had a hard day,
    And because he love her he knew just what to do.

   i can't talk long i gotta go and study for my algebra2 exam, but i got like an hour and a hafe before it starts. i had an exam this per. but it was one of my take-homes couse of my vacation and all. so i had already done it so now i'm just chill'en in the library

"event","tonite was the 1st formal nite on the ship and of that ment picture time which i wasn't axactly(yes i know, i can't spell to save my life)in the mood for but put up w/ for mom and dad. everyone was all decked out, although some people, you would of thought they sent them the memo of ""look like a slut night"" but we won't go there. yes then after that we walked around the boat once and went inside and watched ""passenger feud"" it was mad funny. then me and alex went to the arrcade and plade air hocky for like 2 hours. and now i'm here. i think i goona go back to my room order a midnight burger and then work it off by swimming. i love to swim at night when it's dark and no one else is around. yah that another really nice thing about a criuse nothing closes except for shops and the casino. every thing else stays open. 
yah so we nearly went into a storm and the captin was like we need to sail around it blah blah blah. so we did but we're still feeling the effects of it the boat has been rock'en like crazy every sence we left port. it's really bad when you're standing somewhere and the boat moves and you feel like you're gonna fall over or when your sitt'en on the tolet and the boat is rocking back and forth, that's the worst, but it's not as bad as when your going on a moving bus while jessi's driving.
ok g2g bye"

You take<br>Christmas very seriously.  For you, it is a<br>religious festival, celebrating the birth of<br>the Saviour, and its current secularisation<br>really irritates you.  You enjoy the period of<br>Advent leading up to Christmas, and attend any<br>local carol services you can find, as well as<br>the more contemplative Advent church services<br>each Sunday.  You may be involved in Christmas<br>food collections or similar charity work.  The<br>midnight service at your church, with candles<br>and carols, is one you look forward to all<br>year, and you also look forward to the family<br>get together on Christmas Day.

i did that carol quiz over agian b/c i hate silent night, well i don't hate it, hate it, it's just that it's sung the most, and after a while it gets annoing except when people make it over and sing it in some new funky versoin, but other than i can't stand it. sooooo, i redid the quiz. i went all possoble answers and there was like only 3 that i've even heard of. it was kind of funny.
only an hour and a hafe before i leave school, then i get to go to bradly and get cheaked out, and made sure that i don't have any weapons or drugs or anything and then i get to chill for like another hour 'till the plane leaves. i've never been on a plane before. i'm a little scard. not over terrist or any thing like that, just b'c i've never been on one before.
who ever reads this before youth group tonight tell every one i said hi and that i love them and that i miss them already. oh and some one give Addrienne and Sarah T. a hug for me.
(God Forbid) if i die, i give you guys full permision to raid my room and take what you want and whatevers left give to missions and sing something you can clap your hands to at my funeral!!!!!

i hate change!!!!!
Now there the issue w/ my best friend. she wonders why it seems like we haven't been as close as we used to but it's not like she gives me the time of day to be as close as we used to. shes too busy w/ the new man in her life.
i hate east hartford.
i feel so isolated here like i'm stuck in a prison.
well on a brighter note this time next week i'll be standing out on a cruse ship standing out on the balcony smelling the salt air and missing my friends already, well whats left of my friends"

Your birthday on the 18th day of the month suggests than you are one who can work well with a group, but still remain someone who needs to maintain individual identity. 

There is a humanistic or philanthropic approach to business circumstances in which you find yourself. 

You may have good executive abilities, as you are very much the organizer and administrator. 



You are broad-minded, tolerant and generous; a compassionate person that can inspire others with imaginative ideas. 

Some of your feelings may be expressed, but even more of them are apt to be repressed. 

There is a lot of drama in your personality and in the way you express yourself to others. 

Oddly enough, you don't expect as much in return as you give.</td>

I mean he says the reason he never liked his face was because of acne.  I think there should be a Michael Jackson channel.  Ait the documentary 24 hours a day. 

Last night I went out drinking.  So needless to say I am really tired.  My friends and I rented a luxury limo bus that seats 30 people.  I think, although as fun as it was, those things are a mistake.  Since no one drives home, I think we tend to drink more.  A LOT MORE.  So now this morning I pay for it."

Where the girlies dance
in their underpants,
the nudie bar.

Where you see their butt,
and their trap stays shut,
at the nudie bar.

Where you can't touch a breast,
but you can cave in a chest,
at the nudie bar.

Where you look at a thigh,
and blacken an eye,
at the nudie bar.

Where a buck's enough
to see their stuff,
at the nudie bar.

Where the breasts may be fake
but man do they shake,
at the nudie bar.

Where you swear like a sailor,
and wish you could nail her,
at the nudie bar.

Where the cops are at the door,
and there's a Kennedy on the floor,
at the nudie bar.

Where the beer gives you gas,
but the Bundys kick ass,
at the nudie bar

Clay is gayer than any queer eye guy.....not that there is anything wrong with that.  I was sickened by something else.  The non comedic banter between Clay and Ruben.  Why. Really Why.

Let me start off by saying that I need a vacation from my life.  Lately things have been such a mess in my life I can't be a part of it anymore.  I am hoping this journal will help me get out what I need to get out.  I am still deciding whether or not to write down the whole ordeal just to see it in words and maybe get a new perspective on things.  But I don't have time today.  

What I will write is to everyone.

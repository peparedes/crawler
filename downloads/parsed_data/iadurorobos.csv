"event","i was machining some parts at work today and one of the end mills stabbed me in the forearm all the way to the bone. yeah it felt sooo good. and the one next to it slit open the top of my thumb right on the knuckle. It was great until it would'nt stop bleeding and i felt like i was gonna pass out. after about an hour it finally stopped bleeding, and i went back to work. then after work i had to get a tetanus shot. Yeah today kinda sucked until i got home. you know why? because there was a note on my door for me. it made me smile."

"event","Wow, I'm an idiot. It's now 2:20am and I need to get up at 6:00am to go to work. Oh well it was worth it because Brettany, tiffnay, E-rock and I went to Mahalia's apartment and hung out for a while. It was fun but now i need to go try to sleep but I probably wont cause I can't stop thinking about something, maybe, possibly, I don't know, bye."

"event","I feel empty, crushed, alone and worthless. The one I LOVE is gone. I can never hold her hand again, or look into her beautiful blue eyes. She says I am her best friend and still wants to hang out. But she never answers the phone or returns my calls. I miss her SO much. I still care for her and love her and would do anything for her. But I feel dead inside. I don't understand, i'm confused. 

                                    I love you ALW

I get up and find out about a buch of shit that is going on behind my back. i.e. Andi's older brother is stealing my business and I can't do anything about it because it will make her mad at me! I wish I was getting a huge tax return so I could not pay my bills, rent and food for my children. And instead use it on stealing someones business. Well fuck it!!!    It's a buch of bullshit"

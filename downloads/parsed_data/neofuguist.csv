"event","""You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? 

She's not perfect - you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and make mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. 

She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break - her heart. 

So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she is not there.""

I have been fond of Corvids for longer than I can remember, and during my first semester at HVCC I studied their feeding behaviors at campus and was blessed to see the ""sentinel behavior"" first-hand. Any of you who are interested in learning about these amazing birds should watch the above documentary done by PBS, the facial recognition stuff in particular is something I've never seen before."

""Making a positive first impression on a potential mate can be as easy as dropping the words ""zombie"" or ""atheist"" into your opening salvo on an online dating site.

Making spelling errors, being too forward, slipping into sloppy internet slang or simply mentioning ""God"" can doom your chances for making that crucial first connection. (Referencing ""Allah"" or ""Jesus"" is OK, apparently.)

These are just some of the fascinating results compiled by online dating site OkCupid.com after crunching numbers on 500,000 first contacts between singles.""

"event","""There is nothing spooky or occult about this. We have already seen identity shift from matter to body to mind, each of which involved a decentering or dis-identifying with the lesser dimension... consciousness is simply continuing this process and dis-identifying with the mind itself, which is precisely why it can witness the mind, see the mind, experience the mind. The mind is no longer a subject, it is starting to become an object [in the perception of] the observing self. And so the mystical, contemplative and yogic traditions pick up where the mind leaves off... with the observing self as it begins to transcend the mind."" 

-Ken Wilber

<i>""So, what do you think about that statement ...?"" - rubyhat</i>

<b>My response:</b>

I will often quote people when something they have said mirrors my own thoughts on the topic - this occasion is no different. 

Thinking of the mind as an object from the viewpoint of the perceiving self is an idea that has always sat well with me. A teacher I had once put it in the terms of what we call the things that we consider ours - ""my hat,"" ""my glasses,"" ""my body,"" ""my mind."" We claim ownership to our own minds regularly without a thought to what we are saying.

Who then are we if what makes us who we are is not contained within this literal/metaphorical mind? 

Something else :). 

I also find it far easier to change -my- mind because I view it as a tool. . . an excellent, malleable, durable, amazing tool. 

These are only a few thoughts on the subject, thank you for the question."

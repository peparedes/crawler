"event","<P>so today started out uneventful.. then i got a call from my dear pal christi!!&nbsp; she picked me up and then we went to wal mart to pic up my pictures that have been there forever... they were pretty damn funny!! then we went to her aunt liz's house for easter dinner.&nbsp; We had lots of fun there.&nbsp; we went to the neighbors house to play a little b-ball.&nbsp; then at 4 it was time for din din... I didn't really like the meat selection :( but i had some anyways :)... and there was also potatos (gotta love the potatos (its the irish in me lol christi)) and there was spinich ( i have no clue how to spell that haha), squash, sweet potatoes.. and thats pretty much it... then wen we were all full we called sofa and made plans with her...</P>
<P>We left Liz's house and went to go pick up sophie at her house.&nbsp; We got there, blasted some little mermaid shit... (btw it was pretty damn cool) and then sat in the parking lot of the shopping plaza by her house for about 20 minutes trying to figure out something to do... It was then when i realized that i had to pee REALLY BADLY!!!.... so we finally decided that we were going to go get gas and then go to the carnival in the mission bay parking lot in Boca.&nbsp; so we get to the gas station to discover that there are no bathrooms, or at least that's what sophie told me... so then i really really really have to pee now... and im like about to expload..so there's an albertson's in the shopping plaza where the carnival was.. so christi dropped me off and went to park... i got into albertsons thinking that the bathroom was up in the front of the store, but later discovered that it was all the way in the back.... LUCKY FREKIN ME!!... so i like ran back there (im not effing exageratting on this one.. nor am i lying) i almost didn't make it.. thats how bad i had to go!... so then i met up with them at their parking spot and we went into the carnival thingy.... I ROAD THE ""CARIS WHEEL"" FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE!! i was soooo scared!! but i did it and im proud of myself... we went on alot of rides and it was fun... the second time we went on the feris wheel.... there was this guy that was running the thing and when you get in your supposed to push the doors to get in only it dosn't say that on the outside so you wouldn't know unless like you knew.. you know what im saying? anyways... christi like climbed over the doors and the guy was like ""so you know how to read yet?"" and christi gave him back this little look.. aahh it was hilarious... guess you had to be there.. anyways... uumm yea when we were getting over christi tripped on like a wire or something and he was like: ""Walk much?"" and like as we were walking away we were like eeww ass hole!.. haha anyways so yea that was our fun fillled nite!...then we went to taco ""HELL"" and got some foooooood.. dropped sofa off at school... (don't ask) and then christi dropped me home... and now its late and i wanna go to sleep.... soooo... GOOD NITE YALL!!! </P>

Sophisticated and classy, you're a bit picky about sex.

"event","Hey everyone!.. havn't updated in a while.. been really busy with school and such..
So this weekend was really funn!... on Thursday was Justin's 16th birthday party.  We all took 4 hummer/excursion limos from school to South Beach, Miami and got off at Pearl (it was amazing).  We got there and ate dinner.  It was expensive and i felt special eating there.  So we all ate and socialized and we were supposed to watch a fashion show but.. we didn't lol... instead we went downstairs to the club.  AMAZING!!.. there were beds and pillows and such.  We danced ALL NIGHT... so much fun... then things got a little crazy and im not going to say anymore ;)
That night Katryna, Anna and I went back to Kat's house and pretty much just went to sleep--> After eating some easy mac and ice cream cake from carvel (crunchies yummm) of course!
Friday we all woke up and just chylled.  Her parents were at work so we pretty much just stayed in the house and had.... well... ""fun""... hehe.. enough said... we watched ""Shall we Dance"" and then ate some food and then went on the computer and then ate some more food and did something else and then ate some MORE FOOD!... point being is that we are PIGS!! :P... We got the idea that we wanted to go watch a movie but we couldn't decide what movie we wanted to watch.  So we decided to watch 2 movies.  We watched Hide and Seek with kat's mom (SCARRY!!).. then we watched Coach Carter with just the three of us (INSPIRATIONAL!!!) lol... so we all went our seperate ways after that.  
On Saturday i pretty much did nothing... I got some homework done but thats pretty much it.  Saturday night i went to the movies with Marissa, Bobby, a couple of Bobby's friends and we all had a great time!.. we saw Boogyman... SO EFFING SCARRY!!... i honestly can't even believe that i went into that movie.. i HATE scarry movies!...but it was fun.. so i went home and just went to bed i was tired from the whole weekend and needed the sleep.  
This morning i woke up.. did some homework, then went to WALMART! with my sister so she could get some valentines cards for her class!... as she was shopping for them i started to remember all of my memories of Grade School and having like halloween, valentines day, christmas, ect.  parties... i miss it so much and i wish that i could go back and do it again! :P... but anyway.. now im back here watch pimp my ride trying to avoid writng an 8 page English paper on the Louisiana Purchase... im really bored and wanna go do something but I really have to get this paper done... DAMN!.. I FUCKIN HATE SCHOOL GEEZ!... so i guess that was a pretty good start to my updating again... lol... comment if you wish!!

<marquee> I AM 15, FINALLY! </marquee>

Today, I get to spend the day partying with my co-workers including Kat. Amanda and Ruth actually went out and bought food, drinks, balloons, and a CAKE! I feel so special! This makes up for the fact that my dad forgot about my birthday this morning. Tonight, I am going out for dinner with Kat and my family at some restaurant near the beach.

Work: (8:30 - 4:30) -- Damn that is a long time, but is so worth it!

We work so hard. The last 2 days we have been transporting and alphabetizing charts from one room to another and re-constructing (painting and designing) the employee kitchen. On our break time, we waste our time by doing stupid things like watching Ebaum videos and taking the Da Vinci Code WebQuest Challenge. Also, during lunch break, we mess around in the wheelchairs. Up and down the scary, dark hallways and in and out of dark patient rooms. At the end of the hall, the noises of ticking, but not from a clock. Where is this sound coming from? No one will ever know.

If anyone has any ideas for a color scheme for a kitchen, comment!

"event","I don't know what to fucking do... all three of my best friends are in a fight and it dosn't look lyk they are going to be making up any time soon!!!... its really bad and i didn't want to take sides but it looks like i already did and i think that kat was completly right in what she did and i think that anna wasn't really right but neither was jill so if jill is gunna call anna a slut than anna has the right to do the same and if jill is going to take it personally than so be it but this really isn't something to be fighting over!!.. you guys have been best friends since like the middle of 8th grade.. don't let one stupid fight ruin all the fun times and memories that you've had..i don't mean to get invovled but i guess i would consider myself ((even if you guys dont)) a friend to you guys and friends don't let friends let things like this go that easily!!... Jill if you and anna and kat were all really best friends than this little fight about stupid stuff wouldn't get in ur way!!... and don't let it.. Kat if she can't except that you are trying to be truthful to her than she dosn't deserve the truthful and awsome friendship of yours... and that just the way it should be...if she is gunna be immature about it than let her... don't get in the way of that but im sure she will get over it eventually... and im sure this whole thing will blow over soon enough!!... just take a break for a while and see how you feel!!... well i g2g watch full house becuase its the best show in the world!!... Anna i hope you have fun at ur ""open party"" lol jkjk ((and if anyone random is reading this its not open!!!!)).. lol hahaha... uummm and i hope that you guys can all work this out becuase i would really hate to see such a good friendship go down the drain becuase of a really stupid argument!!1... i love you all including nicole!!... we really need to go tubing agian that was the best time i think i have ever had in my life!!.. haha... so if anyone wants to comment go ahead and tell me what i shoudl do about htis whole thing.. especially if they dont make up i don't want to be caught in a trap of choosing who to be friends wiht because i have had to do that before and it really isn't fun at all!!!.. i love everyone out htere!!!

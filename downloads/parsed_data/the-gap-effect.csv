"event","its pretty sad that that one episode of laguna beach made me cry.
i really hate everything right now
and i don't think i'm going to write in here anymore because it's kind of pointless.
i still am not 100% comfortable just saying what i think in here. friends only, private, or not.  so i guess this will be it."

"event","i just got back from vacation this afternoon and overall it was very relaxing.  i had such bad plans going into this vacation but madison was able to talk me out of doing anything stupid.  anyway, saturday eugene had his show and a party afterwards.  with the state of mind that i was in i thought for a fleeting moment that we would be getting back together, but i came back today to recieve a message on my phone from his new girlfriend to stay away from him.  but after all the thinking i did this week, i don't feel <i>that</i> bad.  i really, really hope that i am finally over him.  this summer hasn't been that good to me.  the whole obsession with gabe was ridiculous and stupid.  i really can't believe that i could be so dumb.  i can't wait for school to start.  i need to focus on something else."

"event","honestly, today was one of the most disappointing days ever.  it kind of makes me never want to leave my room again. but if you know of anything that you think will cheer me up, im open to it.  i just feel like i have no energy left at all.  i've basically come to the end of road.  there are no more choices for me and i guess i kind of got used to being able to go back to my default.  but i don't have that anymore, and i didn't realize it would be the worst feeling in the world.  i really do hate myself right now."

"event","i realized today that i haven't been to church in such a long time.  this whole time i've been so worried about something and didn't even think that i could leave it in His hands.  i feel horrible about what i've done and know that He doesn't approve, but at least i feel a little safer now.  i know nothing bad will happen to me.  this is the calmest i've felt in a long time.  and to all of you who say religion is bullshit i don't care.  maybe it is just for people who are weak and need something to believe in, but it'shelped me more than anything else has."

"event","everything sucks right now and i cant wait to get out of here and go on vacation. i hate how i trusted somone so much, enough to call them my best friend and they couldnt even have the decency or kindness to just look out for me. just this ONE time.  honestly i think this is the most selfish thing anyone has ever done to me and i never ever want to speak to you again.  why do i always befriend the shittiest people"

"event","i had a terrible conversation with someone who's very important to me.  i dont understand why they always think they should make me feel bad.  so the day ended kind of crappy.  earlier i had gone over to justin's to watch some movies and SMOKE SOME, but that was it.  today was much better in comparison.  i brought perry to the park so he could run around and i read for awhile, hung out with this kid gabe.  now i think i'm going to go swimming.//im just really upset that i forgive people so easily because a few weeks ago i said never again, and then i forgave him and he has the audacity to just be so <b>mean</b> to me.  its like he does it on purpose because he knows how much it hurts me.  i'm so sick of being treated this way. you dont tell someone that you love them and then act like that.  i dont know what to do.  this isnt the first time i've come to this conclusion.  this is really hard for me and it'd be nice if some of my <i>friends</i> would help me out instead of always criticizing me."

"event","so we're going to the hamptons for july 4th, and i think we're going to end up staying a lot longer.  shannon is here til then.  yesterday night we went to the party with greg.  ended up coming home before it was over.  all of the people there were so old, it was weird.  it was way sketchy, i didn't feel comfortable at all.  some guy offered me cocaine.. what's that all about.  i'll admit a teeny tiny part of me wanted to try it but eh, i'm over that stuff for now.  today, took Shannon shopping, then went to the movies with nick and christina.  we saw the new batman and it was better than i expected it to be.  after we went to nick's for ice cream and that was it.  i was so excited to get a call from my boyfriend today.  i'm happy that he's not mad at me anymore.  he makes me sososo happy.  i cannot wait til he's back."

"event","im so sleepy, i barely got any sleep last night.  today was much, much better than yesterday.  i got my hair done and stuff and then lunch with greg which i think is what i really cheered me up.  he invited me to a party tomorrow that he promises will be <i>very classy</i>.  maybe it will be good to hang out with a different crowd.
it's really bad to be getting drunk at 11am.  right down the road to alcoholism.  thats pretty sad that i've sunk that low. i'd say no more drinking ever, but thats not a realistic thing to say.  whatever.  i dont know what to write anymore"

"event","today was just one of those days.  sabin, chris, and marco came over to swim and stuff.  i got so wasted and it was just a bad time overall.  who gets drunk at 11 in the morning?  after i woke up later i felt horrible because i'm realizing what kind of person i am..not a good person.  all i do is complain about the way i am and i've done nothing to change it.  i guess i feel if i wasnt doing all these things all the time there would be nothing to me.  i would be doing nothing.  its easier to succumb to these things so i dont have time to think about the things that really depress me.  i layed in the grass today til it was pitch black out.  just thinking about all the things that upset me.  i know eugene said i have to get my shit together but i dont know where to start.  i miss him a lot today because i had no one  i could really talk to about this.  i cant wait for him to get back."

"event","you know, i was just sitting here looking over the periodic table and i got so sad all of sudden.  like out of nowhere.  and i was just thinking maybe for once if i could be alittle less reserved and try and be myself for once.  it's getting depressing being in this little shell all the time.  the worst part is that i cant even be mean without drinking or being high.  i guess im just scared of what people will really think of me, and i can just use that as an excuse for my behavior.  i'm really sorry to all the people who have tried to talk to me in the past and seems like i just brushed you off.  im really not a mean person, it just takes me SO long to get used to people.  it takes forever for me to make new friends and to open up to people.ust wish i could be a little more content with who i am and more confident.  because i dont feel very good about myself right now.  everyday i say i'm going to be different and just walk up to someone new and say hi, but i cant.  nothing ever goes the way i imagine in my head, and i guess thats the problem.  i spend to much time imagining and planning things instead of just doing it.  and plus it's only be +or- 3 days and i feel lonely already.  how pitiful is that.  that some dumb boy who wasn't even that nice to me, made me feel somewhat complete.  i guess all i want is some affection. once all this testing is over i want to find someone who will just accept me and who i can be myself around so i can stop faking and just get what i want for once.  this is all so tiresome."

AGAIN.  eugene and i are ""taking a break""  because that's what he wants.  my ""problems and drama""  are really starting to get to him and he'd rather if i took some time to figure it all out and when he gets back we can ""start talking again""  i'm over it though.  i dont think it's worth it anymore.  i say i love him all the time and he constantly leaves me questioning if he loves me. and last night i thought i was to crumble into a million teeny tiny pieces, but now i don't it's not as bad.  i feel optimistic about what's going to happen now.  like every time this has happened  i said i would be okay, and that i would not let eugene trick me into getting back with him.  but this time i truly do feel like i will be okay, but who knows what's going to happen a couple weeks or months from now.  but i dont even have time to think about it.  three regents this week and i just need to study.  i fooled around all year (MOSTLY with him) and now i dont even know anything about any of the subjects. so back to studying."

friday we had a last day of school party at jake's. not that i remember much.  but eugene was mad at me again because i told him i stopped smoking and i really didnt.  and it's like all week he's been trying to get back at me for that.  he was acting so immature, eric and chuckie called me just to tell me they all went to a strip club.  why, i dont know, i tried to act like i didnt care, but i did.  and now im sick and i feel so bad.  and eugene called me at like 3 oclock this morning because he was in an accident and that made feel so bad that i've been mad at him.  and we actually had a real talk, something we havent done in a really, really long time.  and he told me all the stuff thats been bothing and why he's been so distant.  i guess i feel better about everything now.  i love him so much and he leaves in 9 days.  i'm going to miss him a lot, i'm not sure what i'm going to do not seeing him for a month.

wow. i've been so busy lately, i haven't had time to make a proper update.  last week i went to
to prom with jake.  it was pretty good.  not as great as last year, but that was to be expected.  nobody can top eugene. monday,tuesday, wednesday: last days of work.  finally.  i'm too lazy to have a job.  at first it was kind of fun, but i started hating <b>having</b> to be there.  i didn't like having to schedule things around it.  it was impossible to be spontaneous during the week anymore.  all i could do was come home, walk perry, then go to work. anyway, friday i went to cody's prom which was okay.  everyone was nice enough, but i didn't know any of them.  i came home right after it was over. eh, i just wasn't feeling it.
got my progress report, and it's not so good.  my mom doesn't seem to care, but i'm really
disappointed in myself.  it's a good thing i dont have work anymore, i cans spend more time
studying now and less time hanging out.  that's all i've been doing really.  saturday i went
to see justin for a little, then hung out with eugene and he got of his tatoo finished. i fell
asleep at his house and didn't get home til 4 oclock this morning. ugh
yesterday i thought perry ran away and i wa SO scared.  one of the worst things that has ever happened to me.  i guess that's all for now."

so far this weekend has been boring.  yesterday i went with justin, olivia, and danny to justin's little sister's play, it was really cute, they did annie. after eugene picked me up and we just hung out and he spent the night cause mom and bill are away for the weekend...again.  now i supposed to be doing my english project and i haven't accomplished anything at all.  i tried to start around 1 and i've done nothing but play on the computer, play with perry, and watch tv.

"event","i'm not sure what to write in here.  i've been really b usy, but i never feel like talking about anything, but here you go...
monday; nothing at all. i just went to school and then work cause i didn't work yesterday.  tuesday was the same exact thing.  after work i hung out with margo and brett and some other guys.  that was fun.  wednesday; eugene had a show so i went to that.  he and eric just did covers last night, but they were really good.  the show was over like 12, so we got breakfast?
my boyfriend is so sexy and i love him sosoosososoos much. and im really happy right now, but so tired

"event","the snow is getting ridiculous.  i'm really sick of it now.  we're not even getting snow days anymore.  i want school to be over so badly.  i can't wait for spring break, i need a vacation from everything.  i've felt so tired this whole week.  all i've really done is go to school and work.  today i went to school and it was snowing again, i was really hoping we'd get out early, but nothing..  after i came home for a little while and played with perry.  then i left to see eric and nick.  there were other things going on tonight, but i just didn't have any energy to go to a party.  i think i prefer just quiet nights,  the whole partying thing is really getting old.  i don't like the way i feel the next day.
hopefully it won't be snowing tomorrow too, i heard it's supposed to snow til sunday?
all of this has been about snow, so i'll end it here."

"event","<P>i have a lot of work due for school tomorrow but i can't concentrate. whatever.&nbsp; i didn't go to school today.&nbsp; i woke up all tripy and gross dizzy and stuff so i just stayed home and called in sick at work.&nbsp; this is my third day calling in sick in 2 weeks.&nbsp; i hope i don't get fired or anything.&nbsp; then when school was out hannah came over and we played with perry.&nbsp; then i dropped her off at home and went to see brett and brought so he could play with him too. perry has made me really popular.</P>
<P>plus i realized today i am very sucky at commitment.&nbsp; i'm not even really ""committed"" to this boy, but yeah if i was i would probably end it soon cause i have wandering eyes.&nbsp; like i cant stay still for very long.</P>
<P>then i came home and read and slept.&nbsp; my mom wouldn't make dinner for me since i was ""sick"" but still had time to socialize.&nbsp; i guess i am old enough to make my own dinner. but she's my mom! i don't care</P>
<P>i really do lvoe snoop dogg. this has all been dumb and i will probably delete it tomorrow.</P>
<P>bye</P>

"event","sabin is the best.  somehow she managed to plan a surprise party for my yesterday. yay. and on saturday i got to see some of my favorite boys.  so the weekend was fun & good.
despite today being my birthday/valentine's day it felt like just a regular day.  i am 17 years old.  i always thought of 17 as being so old, but i don't feel that grown up.
after school i drove mikey home and then played some scrabble with miles.  i always get the worst letters.
i don't feel that well, so i'm going to eat some cake and probably go to sleep.

i'm so happy right now"

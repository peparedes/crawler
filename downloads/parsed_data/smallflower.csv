Still in school and maintaining a 3.6 GPA. Go me. :) My birthday is in two (2) days. I'll be 26, and I think I'll like being 26. I really don't mind getting old, unlike some females I know. My boyfriend is giving me the best present ever. He's taking me to Disneyland for 2 days! We're even going to stay in one of the resort hotels. I've never stayed in one and have always wanted to! This is a big thing for him to do, I know. I know he's not keen on Disneyland, but knows I adore it as well as all things Disney. (I am rescinding my goal of working for them though. The whole Eisner/Iger thing is just bull.) So, this Friday, instead of being at work for my birthday, I'll be at one of my favorite places in the world with one of my favorite people in the world. Couldn't be better. :)"

So, yeah. I'm still in school. Maintaining a B average these days. The working and schooling is just so hard and I'm just always tired. Next week is finals week, and goodness, I can't wait for it to be over. I just want to sleep.

Still with my man. He graduated this Spring and he's now in town permanently. It's nice to see him more than every 3 months. He's treating me real good... despite his random diarrhea-of-the-mouth.

I'm in my own place now. Renting a house near work. Living there with a couple of friends. I love having my own room again... plus, I enjoy having the whole house to myself sometimes. It's great! 

Anyway... I'm still alive and still kicking... hope everyone has a good one..."

On Thursday of last week, I went up to a party in Beverly Hills. A friend of mine knew the owner of an art gallery up there and she was having a huge shindig. I felt like I was dropped in the middle of a 90210 episode. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the creators of South Park), Margeret Cho, and some other actor we couldn't name was there. I was even offered a glass of Champari (a very good mix of liquer and champagne) and they didn't card me! Open bar. Ice scuplers. Every other person was on a cell phone... it was great.

Now, everytime I sleep a bit wrong I wake up with this wrenching pain in my lower back. It hurts to sit, walk, and (especially) bend over in anyway. Now that I have insurance again, I went to see the doctor about it yesterday. (It has been hurting since Monday) and he said that there was nothing I can do about it. He prescribed me some muscle relaxers and suggested I take them with pain-killers too. So, I'm living off asprin and muscle-relaxers. Sorry to say that it doesn't help all that much. The pain isn't as sharp, but it's still there and still restricts my movement and affects my work day. It so sucks. *sigh* So, how's your day?"

"event","God!! I'm hating Christmas time right now. Now, wait. Just know that's it's still my favorite holiday and I'll love it all my life... I just hate this time of year. Remember, I work in retail... in a mall... People are mean, grumpy, picky, and all around not at their best. I have three 14 hour days in a row this week and am not too happy about it. To top it all off, I have a horrendus inner ear infection that just wont go away. So, I'm living off decongestants, Advil, and caffine. :|
On the upside, I dyed my hair red again (and I love the color this time) and I have a full set of nail thanks to my roomies Mom. I alos have all my shopping done and I found a new place to live. :)"

"event","A little bird informed me that I have failed to place an entry about a recent night in my life. I went on a date with a guy named Rob last night. It was one of the best dates that I've ever had. Miniture golfing, ice cream, the beach, and flowers... what more could I ask for? Ah, yes... a really cute guy to round it all off... wait! I had that too! :} So, I guess I have a new guy in my life. And he's the coolest..."

"event","Went on a date with an ex-coworker. I used to work with him at Sea World. The date was wonderful... he wasn't. In a nutshell... he's not that cute and he's a horrible kisser. Also, he told me that he loved me. That's fine and all... but ON THE FIRST DATE?? I didn't think that this date was that big of a thing, really. I guess he's liked me for a while... or I was really good (not like that! Perves!)on the date... or something. Anywho..."

"event","U2 is comming back! U2 is comming back! That's right boys and girls. U2, the very popular band from Ireland, is comming back to the USofA to end their tour. Since this flower missed them the first time around, she's sure to catch them this time. Even though she has to drive up to LA to see them, she doesn't care. (Why am I talking in the 3rd person? I need to stop it.)
Anyway... I'm happy that Dark Angel is back on the air and that U2, one of the greatest bands out there, is comming back to the US. I'm a happy camper right now. 
I'd be happier if Savage Garden opened for them... but it's not to be... *sigh*"

I am disgusted and angered by this deliberate attack on the freedom that America stands for. In the words of Savage Garden, ""If you need to crash, then crash and burn. You're not alone."""

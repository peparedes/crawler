"event","Feeling rather intense at the moment. I just finished sitting in on my first Sexual Assualt Sensitivity Training (trainings which I will be facilitating next year). It was at a frat where all the frat stereotypes can be applied without question. Wow. We didn't get through completely, but progress was made.
Anyway, as per Charley's post on his own LJ I'm posting the courses I am planning for next year. They're subject to some variation, as I've scheduled an appointment with an advisor for Thursday. If I major in Immunology/Mircobiology, and do a minor in Pharmacology I will have just enough credit hours left to do enough random arts courses to fulfill med school requirements. By just enough I mean, if I take 18 credits, rather than the recommended 15 credits... every semester. Anyway here goes:
Fall:
Microbiology (MIMM) 211: Intro to Micro
MIMM 212: Lab in Immunology
Biochem 311: Metabolic Biochem
Physiology 209: Mammalian Phy.
English 226: American Lit 2

Winter:
Biology 202: Genetics
Biochem 312
Phgy 210
MIMM 387: Applied Immunology
English: Modern American Ficition, 20th C. Prose, Eng. Lit and the Bible... something along those lines

That's me at the moment.
It's shower time.
And time for you to pick yo' self up off the floor, cuz yup I posted two days in a row. Get ready for the ice age baby."

"event","So yes, it's true I haven't updated in forever. I know. What can I say, I'm a bad person. I can't promise I'll be any better in the up-coming weeks, but I thought I'd give a quick update. It's Monday night and I just got out of a SACOMSS general assembly meeting, I've got about an hour before the Douglas Council meeting, so I dropped into the library on the way back to rez, hoping to finish my chemistry lab. It's the last thing hanging over my head at the moment- but no worries I'll get it done and then I'll be able to get some hardcore studying done. The council meeting is at BDP (that's Bar de Pins) so we'll see how much actually gets accomplished. I'm hoping it doesn't last too too long, I've had my fill of meetings for the night. This week is going to fly by. It's already Monday night, Tuesday is full of class, and tomorrow night I have my first real duty as next year's Community Links Coordinator for SACOMMS. We're doing an active listening and sensitivity training for a frat. I'm a little nervous but very excited. Thursday I meet with an advisor, and technically we're on strike (the goverment in cutting $103 million in grants and making them loans), anyway, that'll fly by. Then it's a lovely four day weekend! But the best part of it all is that Henry and Mum are coming to Ottawa (Easter/Henry's spring break) and then to Montreal. I'll get to go stay with family for the weekend and then get a chance to show Henry and Mum what life is like for me here. I'm really excited to introduce them to everyone, show them the house for next year, and take them around the city. Soooo excited. It's such a nice surprise, and just what I need to cure the homesickness I've been feeling lately. In other news, I ran 7 miles yesterday. I'm so proud of myself!! I'm helping Alison train for a half-marathon, and I'm pretty excited about the whole thing. I hope we can keep to the schedule through exams, life can get pretty stressful around here. After to run Emily, Colin and I went out for mexican food for dinner- had margarita's for the first time (little alcohol, lots of yum). The place was pretty entertaining and we kept getting talked to on the street walking to and fro. Emily enjoyed responding to gansta-esque ""how you doin's"" with ""peachy!!"". Mighty entertaining I must say. I'm also starting to get really pumped about the summer. It sounds like I am going to have a ton of riding to do- at least 6 horses a day, I've volunteered to be the Secretary for an Event, and I should know sometime around April 1st whether I have a spot on the International Team (2-3 weeks competing/training in Calgary with the USPC Team). Fingers crossed. Not too mention getting to spend a little quality time with friends. Can't wait. We'll I suppose if this library trip is to be at all productive I better get crackin on the chem lab. It's the last write-up/lab I for organic. Amazing. It's hard to believe the year is winding down. Oh, and Charley, if you're out there, I've been thoroughly enjoying your CDs, and scarf lately ;) 
That's all for now.

Maybe I'll update again before the next ice age ;)"

"event","If you walk away, I walk away.
First tell me which road you will take.
I dont wanna risk our paths crossing someday,
so you walk that way,
I'll walk this way.
The future hangs over our heads,
and it moves with each current event.
Until it falls all around us like a cold steady rain,
just stay in when its looking this way.
The moons laying low in the sky,
forcing everything metal to shine,
and the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewelry store case,
they argue ""walk this way"",
""no, walk this way.""
And lauras asleep in my bed,
as Im leaving, she wakes up and says,
""I dreamed you were carried away by the crest of a wave.
baby dont go away....
come here.""
There's kids playin guns in the street,
and ones pointing his tree branch at me.
So, I put my hands up I say ""enough is enough.
If you walk away, I'll walk away.""
and then he shot me dead!
I found a liquid cure,
for my landlock blues.
It will pass away like a slow parade, 
it's leavin but I dont know how soon.
The world's got me dizzy again,
you think after 22 years id be used to the spin.
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place,
so, I'm always pacing around or walking away.
I'm drinking the ink from my pen,
and I'm balancing history books up on my head.
And it all boils down to one quotable phrase...
""If you love something, give it away.""
A good woman will pick you apart,
a box full of suggestions for a possible heart...
and you may be offended,
and you may be afraid,
but don't walk away..
Don't walk away.
We made love on the living room floor,
with the noise in the background from a televised war.
And in that deafening pleasure, I thought I heard someone say,
""If we walk away, they'll walk away.""
but greed is a bottomless pit,
and all freedoms a joke, 
we're just taking a piss.
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display.
If you're still free start running away.
(cause we're coming for ya!)
I've grown tired of holding this pose,
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home.
So, I'm making a deal with the devils of fame,
saying ""let me walk away...please.""
You'll be free child once you have died,
from the shackles of language, and measurable time.
And then we can trade places,
play musical graves...
till they walk away, walk away, walk away....
So, I'm up at dawn,
puttin on my shoes...
I just wanna make a clean escape, I'm leaving but I dont know where to.
I'm leaving but I don't know where to.

"event","So lifes been a little rough lately. Too much stress about school mainly. I seems that in Canada A's are impossible. If I make it out of here alive I'll have an amazing education.
Andy was here this weekend which was really nice- it was great to see someone from home and get to show him around this school that, despite all the bitching, I love. Its been rough catching up on work though- had a philosophy paper due today. I rewrote the whole thing last night after talking it over with the proff... I'm attempting to suck less at this one than the last. Arg to philosophy. And, I sprained my ankle last night in our playoff ultimate frisbee game- thought nothing of it and let my adrenaline keep pumping for the rest of the game (even scored!). We lost but it was a blast. Anyway, woke up this morning unable to walk- my ankle is swollen and bruise and the hill is the biggest bitch ever. It was so painful going down to class this morning that Alison insisted she give me a piggy-back ride. What sweet people I live with. I then had to ""rush"" as best I could, back to finish my physics lab- no one else has the lab with me on Tuesday and thus no one could help me do it. The lab was crazy and complex and I ran out of time trying to figure it all out- had to find someone to run turn in my philosophy paper since it would have taken me forever to hobble over to that side of campus, and I barely made it to physics intime as it was. Another day in the life of me. 
So tonight, I shall catch up on things and then do some studying- learn something for once- what a concept. And maybe tomorrow will be a better day."

1. It is a toque not a hat nor a beanie
2. Ninimo bar... I still forget how to say it everytime
3. eh? enough said
4. this is Canada, the land of milk in bags
5. say ""senior year"" and people look at you like you're crazy- it's grade 9,10,11,12 here, not freshman-senior... and this from the people who invented CEGEPS
6. leutient vs. leftenient... wtf
7. it's not a grade its your mark
8. PB&J doesn't really stand for peanut-butter and jelly... it's peanut-butter and jam
9. Contrary to popular belief you don't say Toronto, Montreal, and Quebec- it's Turana, Muntreal, and K-bec
10. College and University are not interchangable words
11. It's a pylon, not a traffic cone... for some reason we seem to be collect them in the common room
12. Degrees celcius... ok, so maybe the US is the weird one on that
13. The on going never ending battle to the death between IM and MSN... no one here has IM, nor do they understand what you are talking about when you say that you IMed someone
14. Putiene... ohhh Quebec- think fries, cheese curds, and gravy
15. And H houses favorite- American's say ""Mac and Cheese"" Canadians say KD (Kraft Dinner) and neither one understands what the other is talking about."

Speaking of home, everyone is heading out this weekend for the holiday. Canadian Thanksgiving that is. We only get one day off so I won't be going home. Instead Friday I am going to catch a bus to Ottawa and go to my uncle Jeff's house through Sunday. Monday I'll be back here doing some hardcore studying.... Tuesday is my first midterm.

"event","So the rugby team had initiation tonight. They had to strip completely naked and run up to the upper rezes, then do the stairs up and down with their hands behind their heads, and run back to Forbes field to there clothes. Forbes is right next to Doug, so we got a first hand look at the entertainment. A few people tried to go out and steal their clothes, but they were gaurded by a large rugby player... thus pretty safe.
We tried dying Colin's hair again tonight... this is try 5. We finally got good bleach last time but his hair is convinced it'd rather be red than blonde. We're doing one more bleaching tomorrow and then the blue. If I was him I'd never let me touch his hair again.
Last night a group of us finally walked up the mountain- it was pretty chilly and windy... and slightly scary in the woods. The paths we took were short cuts- more like stream beds and broken stairs. Somehow we didn't get lost and got an awesome view of the Montreal skyline at night. The guys decided we needed to watch a scary movie when we got back. And, though I'm sure you realize this, I am not a scary movie person. Why? Because scary movies are scary. ughghghh I hate them. Needless to say I watched The Shinning, which was a terrifying. The intenseness of it was broken up by all of them making fun of me whenever I covered my eyes of squirmed. I lived though.
Today was hw, hw, and more hw. I started at 10 this morning and just finished- breaking only to play ultimate frisbee. We lost, but it was really fun, and I think I might be getting better!

So funny. We managed to only break 2 glasses and spill just a few glass LOL. We had some awesome Togas. Mine was silk and oh so sexy. Jaime's was plaid straight off his bed. Tom sported skater shoes and socks with his. Kate's was barely there... honestly it was torn up and pinned together barely covering her ass and not covering anything else LOL. Nikki's was red and white checkered. A bunch of people put maple leaves in their hair to top it all off. Kara's was bright splotches of color. It was so great. We had started the night off by watching Animal House so we were all prepped and ready to go.
The guys all decided that in true toga spirit one should not wear anything underneath the toga. Sooooo funny. They of course decided that after leaving their rooms and thus hid their boxers in the bushes. 
We came back to Doug and hung out in the common room- Bryan, Tom, and Jaime jammed on their guitars and Matt fell asleep on the couch. A very chill time. We waited up until druken Alison came home- she had gone somewhere with Nikki without telling anyone. It all worked out in the end though. 
Today Tom is going to give me a guitar lesson! Isn't that exciting!! And I think Colin and I are going to hike to the top of the mountain- something we have still yet to do which is insane. Other than that it's going to be studying time most of the weekend. Midterms are creeping up amazingly quickly."

Douglas Hall
3851 Universite, Rm H27-1
Montreal, QC H3A 2B4
CANADA

or if you wanna call... 514-396-9621 (and I have voicemail that I check!)

email: halley.crissman@mail.mcgill.ca (my home email is not really working at the moment)

Anyway, that letter made me happy. It also made me a little sad to think of the people at home that I miss, and home in general. We have Canadian Thanksgiving in 2 weeks and so most people are going to go home... not me! I'm going to my uncle's house in Ontario, which will be fun, but it will be hard to hear everyone else talk about home.
I talked to Charley the other night and it totally made my day/week/month LOL I woke him up by calling too late, but it was still worth it to chat with him. Oh how I love my brother!
We're heavily into the whole school thing here... as I'm sure everyone is. Time is flying by so quickly. Last weekend we attempted to head to 80's night at a club called ""Le Swimming""- it's highly recommended and most of my friends went there during frosh week. A huge group of us headed out all decked out 80's style, but decided to go to the gay village first (a veeery long walk) because a friend of Emily and Nikki's was visiting and really wanted to see it. I got to have a nice heart to heart with Tom on the way- he lives at the other end of my hall and is a sweetheart. He broke up with his girlfriend to come here so we seem to take comfort in each other's understanding. LOL, he was also keeping me walking in a straight line. Anyway, we got all the way to the gay village and went into a bar called... hmmm umm yeah I don't remember, it's something really strange. Yeah, it was a lesbian bar. So, the funniest part of the whole thing is that Drew got hit on by a guy while we were there. All the guys had dressed in girl's shirt- most of them pink, and they had the ""gayest"" looks we could come up with, so it wasn't really surprising but we were all entertained. We only stayed there about 15 minutes and headed out to le swimming, but by the time we got there we'd been walking for like 2 hours and no one had the energy to dance enough to justify paying the cover. We ended up coming back to Doug and just chillazin. Saturday we headed to ""Value Village""- kinda like the salvation army. We all got sheets for the toga party next weekend (mine is silk- ow ow!!), and funky clothes. That night we were supposed to hit up karaoke, but I ended up having issues with light headedness and vision blacking (I hadn't really had it much since I got here) and decided I shouldn't go out. Hanging out in Doug wasn't bad though... but I was not feeling good which sucked. Sunday was homework.
And, now it's Monday. I've got my first paper due tomorrow for philosophy- Aristotle's views on the life of pleasure. It's done, but I'm still nervous about it. Physics lab due for tomorrow too. Basically I should be working instead of typing this, but I'll get to it soon enough :)
Thanks again for the letter Becky- so good to hear from you. I'll return the favor as soon as I get to ""le metro"" (our shopping center) and get the needed essentials to write back. I need to go there soon, since my toothbrush decided to go missing last night :)
LOVE YOU!"

Last night we had the Doug council election- we listened to speeches at dinner, then voted, and had a party a few hours later to announce the winners. I actually purchased alcohol for the first time last night for the party. Up to that point I'd pitched in a few dollars here and there, but had never actually gone to a store and bought something. I find it so hilarious that they don't card people here. Hell, I bet Henry could walk in and buy something at an SAQ. I ended up getting vanilla vodka- it wasn't as good as I'd hoped, but oh well. We had fun dancing like crazy people and just goofing off for the night- and it was night to not be in a club atmosphere. Anyway, overall it was a good evening.
My Aristotle reading for the weekend is finished as of this morning- I spent 3 hours on it yesterday afternoon in the library. The Birks library is so cool- it's in a religious building and you have to take your shoes off to enter the library- makes for a comfy studying atmosphere. Anyway, it's nice to have that out of the way."

"event","This weekend was an interesting one. Loosing Katie set things off to a rough start and made time pass in unusual ways. Lots of listening to ""Blackbird"" and ""Desperado"" helped ease the pain.
Did a lot of sitting with friends and relaxing. On Sunday, we tried to get back in the swing of things- went up to Molson for a ""towel"" party- which didn't really happen. Emily got us started making rice krispies... they didn't even make it into a pan before the group devoured them. We made jello shooters and then went up to Gardner... found the 7th floor with a bong in the bathroom, racing shopping carts down the halls. Not really our scene so we headed back to Doug and decided to try and meet some people at a karaoke bar. We met them on their way back and ended up just coming back to Doug. I wasn't drunk- just a little tipsy- but somehow whenever I drink I never actual get to the place I intend to go to. Back at Doug we put on music and Emily and I danced around with a hairbrush as our microphone- doing our own karaoke. A very good time indeed... luckily Ian didn't get too many pics. Colin, Em, and I went to Timmy's (Tim Horton's) and then crashed late in the night. 
Monday was spent mainly on homework (I had already done most of it which was good)- helped Ian review some calc and made myself happy by finishing all the calc I intended to do. I'm about 1/2 done with a letter to Mr. Watkins to let him know how things are going and thank him for the great job he did preparing us for college math. We took a break from hw in the afternoon and played ultimate frisbee in the football stadium. Sooo much fun. I think our team may actual end up doing well!
I also talked to Lesley last night... it wasn't the best conversation. Sometimes it just hard to be a situation where you feel helpless and yet all you want to do is patch the wound and put it to rest. I hope she knows I'm not mad at her- just frustrated at my inability to help. Everyone deals with things differently- some do it well, other poorly- but I think everyone's intentions are good. It reaffirmed the need for communication- I apparently have been misled about feelings.
This morning Kara (our don) ran our first H house yoga session. She's going to run them twice a week and I really think it is going to help keep my stress level down. What an amazing person Kara is- you guys would love her. Ian was ready to kill me for dragging him to do yoga at 8 AM but it ended up being a good thing for everybody. 
We then headed down to the poster sale- I bought 3, and my walls are thanking me :) It looks much more homey in my room now. In front of my computer there is a black and white poster of an old wood dock stretching into a lack with a gorgeous white cloud in the sky. It reads ""AMBITION- The world makes way for those who know where they are going"". Above my dresser a field of sunflowers are glowing in the red light of a spanish sunset, and a top my headboard a rower in drifting into the morning dusk with the words ""Perseverance- there is no substitute for hard work"". Going to the poster sale and looking at all the beautiful works, especially after a morning of yoga, was very relaxing- sobering in a way. It's got me in a peaceful mood, but it also really makes me want to go ride. All the sayings about pursuing what you love.... I'm going to work on finding a place to ride once classes get underway and I know my time schedule better. To be back on a horse will be so nice :)
Anyway, it's time to head to physics... have a wonderful day guys. I think I will get to see my cousin and go to Concordia (University) tonight- should be nice :)
PS- Charley I'd love to talk to you!!"

"event","So, I was woken up this morning by Aaron knocking on my door. He came in and said ""I'm sorry"". I had no idea what he was talking about, at which point he told me that Katie had died. I was still very confused, thought he was joking or that I was dreaming. Apparenlty, Katie was supposed to get on a bus home to Vermont yesterday afternoon, but never arrived home. Security was alerted when her parents arrived at the bus station and did not find her. At about 3 AM this morning she was found dead in her room- cause unknown. She was a very healthy kid- a member of the lacrosse team. She had had a cold for the last week or so, but was on one of her last doses of antibiotics and seemed to be recovering. Foul play is not suspected.
She was the sweetest girl- red hair and a big bright smile. She had convinced me to come out and try lacrosse- encouraged me along the way, and was always making us smile. Two nights ago she came into my room with Aaron to tell me how excited she was to go home.
Having her pass away really hit home. What if you never got to see your friends and family again? Whoever thinks of dying at 19? It just scares me.
Everyone has been really supportive here- friends, dons, counslers. But, I just wanted to talk to someone from home- the people I feel most seperated from. I tried calling home, but my parents are in Washington at my cousins wedding, so I couldn't reach them. Poor Sam, I left a crying message on his cell phone, which he was kind enough to return. I just needed to hear a comforting voice and feel more connected to those people who I am so close to at heart, but so physically far away from."

We went to ""La Ronde"" ce demain and that is the Canadian version of Cedar Point. It was a damn good time, despite the rain. It started raining and we came back to Doug, brewed some hot cocoa, chatted and have plans to watch some movies after our last night out on the town tonight. We bought tequilla, salt, and lime..... should be a good time. I haven't drank much since I've been here- but that may change this evening. We'll see.

"event","Ok, I know I haven't updated since I've been at school, but things have been so crazy! In an attempt to make it up to you I will try to tell you everything that I've been doing. My only caution is that this could get to be quite lengthy. And, I will use the names of the people here- maybe eventually you'll get to know them.
So, the first night I arrived (one week ago today) I was assigned to Douglas Hall- a gorgeous building 1/2 way up Mont Montreal. I was fortunate enough to be put in ""H house""- or H to the hizzo as we call it. Doug is divided into houses A-H, which are all connected. H is the biggest and is on the end of the building. About 50 people live in H and all of them are really sweet, so do the rest of the Dougies. My room is on the end of the hall on the 2nd floor, right next to a common room. The girl across the hall has yet to move in, but Thirry, the other kid across the hall is the biggest sweetheart. He's a music major from Toronto- glasses and curly hair, fluent in french, and the first night he invited me to come have cheerios with him the next morning. Apparently he got drunk the other night at a karoke bar with the other music majors- quite funny I'm sure. The bathrooms are right down the hall- they're communal, but work out just fine. The only thing that messes me up is that half the facutes say ""C"" and ""H"" on them and the other half say ""C"" and ""F"" the first time you turn a ""C"" handle expecting cold and instead get chaud (hot in french) water it really messes you up ;)
Ok, so on the first night of arrival, after a Doug BBQ, my parents and Chas went off to their hotel and all of Doug went out to Pub Saint Supiss over on St. Denise. It was such a cool place- two stories- the 2nd being a balcony over the first, which is open air. It included a dance floor and multiple bars. Just a gorgeous place. Matt, Nikola, Ian, Antoine and I shared a few pitchers. Alex ran into a street lamp on the way-that was quite entertaining. We mingled mostly- got to know our super cool don Kara and had a great time. I learned, for the first time of several thus far, that drunk guys are scary and that no one should pick up people at bar- within 5 minutes on the dance floor some other frosh guy tried to get me to go home with him. Riiiiiigght. LOL I've gotten so good at making up excuses and running away. Anyway, Nikola ( a girl on the 1st floor who is from Toronto) is super fun to dance with- so we busted it out and then all hiked back up ""the hill"" to Doug. This hill by the way will keep us all in top shape. We've cursed it so much already, and everyone has blisters to show for it- but it's all ok.
The second day... I organized my room more. I have a hallway in my room where I have posted all my pictures from home (my hallway is one of a kind :)). Then ran a bunch of errands (bank, bookstore, ID card, ect) and said goodbye to my parents and Charley (I didn't cry!!). That night all of H house went out to dinner at Indiana's- it was a good chance to chat. Afterwards we were wondering St. Catherine's street (know as the street with the most Strip clubs in North America) when the guys we were with decided we should go to a strip club. So, Kaitlyn, Kate, Ashley, Joe, Willie, Jaime, Dave, and I ended up at ""Club Super Sex"". It was quite amusing. As the guys oggled, we girls sat and talked about who was pretty, and the crazy shoes the girls were wearing. A true Montreal experience I suppose. Then the H house ""tea party""... someone made tea- a few people had drinks and we just chatted for a few hours. It was more my scene and a very enjoyable time. Afterwards we went to Kara ( the don/RAs) room and watched the Robin Williams stand up comedy routine on Matt's computer. So fun!
Day 3 we started Science Frosh (god it's hard to keep all this straight). The theme was top-gun. Everything was crazy- we were immediately given alcohol, beer bongs on the lower field in the middle of campus (beer was free as frosh week is sponsored by Molson) and by 1ish in the afternoon we were all pretty drunk. I was in group 26- everyone had to have names (dirty of course)- so we were led by drunk upper classmen with names like ""Slutty Steve"" and ""Bang me Brittany"". Our first night we went to Club Altitude 737. A club on the top of a sky scraper (the roof of the 37th floor). The view was amazing. Camille, Ria, Claire and I had an awesome time dancing the night away, our other Dougie friends Aaron and Ben helped make the night lots of fun. Everyone at the club was really smashed though. The view made it all worth it, and we got to get all dressed up (it was pretty formal) which was fun. On the way home we say some guy joggin wearing only shorts and no shoes, in the middle of the street at 2 AM.... a now running joke of course.
Day 4 I attempted lacrosse. The lacrosse team needed more people and said it didn't matter if you'd played before- so I went to conditioning for 2 hours and then practice for 2 hours and got a crash course in lacrosse. I played the next day as well- but the pratice schedule crashes too much with my classes and I'd rather explore the university 1st semester than spend all my time with one thing- so I decided not to play. I'm going to use the gym on my own time- and I signed up for a once a week dance class so that should be fun. The 4th night we went on a pub crawl- it was fun singing all the McGill drinking songs through the streets of Montreal, but a hell of a lot of walking on tried feet. I opted out of going to the club afterwards and instead came back to H-house and went to Colin's for a bit. Colin lives over in G-house (G-Unit!!) and we met while playing Ultimate frisbee one night (so fun), and we just chatted and then went and got Tim Hortons. Good times. 
The next day was a water park, but I ran errands and went to the gym instead. That night Ria, Camille, Claire and I went to Club Dome and dragged along Brian (a quite guy from my floor). The place was soooooo packed and sooooo hot. I met this kid named Sam from DC and that I though was quite entertaining. I ended up walking home alone (never a good idea) because I lost Ben (who was my walking home buddy). It worked out ok, and when I got back I took a shower and then hung out with a bunch of people in the courtyard- found Ben and harassed him for leaving without me. All in good fun.
Yesterday was the first day of SSMU (student society) frosh. Ria and I ditched out on the afternoon scavenger hunt and went to the side walk sale on St. Laurent instead- had a great time trying on 80's clothes. Then went to the gym. Last night was 80's night at club sky. (A gay bar in the village). I wasn't going to go out but Colin and Nikola convinced me I couldn't miss it. We had sooooo much fun dressing up. I found a ghost busters shirt, a balck skirt, leg warmers- crazy makeup. I've got pictures if I can ever figure out how to post them. Then we headed down the always entertaining St. Catherine's street (walked 3-4 miles I'd guess)- made a few interesting friends on the way. Including ""Pablo"" some Spanish/French guy who Nikola and I spoke in our broken french to, and who gave us his number... we posted it on someone elses dorm room door with a note saying ""Call me baby"". The dancing at Sky Club was the best- no grinding- just craziness (and you guys know I love that)- I got to dance on the bar and that was fun- and all totally sober. We only stayed for an 1 1/2 hours and then Darcy, Nikola, our token guy Virkrum (sp?) and I took the Metro home (we were too tired from dancing to walk!). Once back at Doug we hung out for a bit and headed to bed early cuz....
Today we got to go white water rafting!!! A big group of us from Doug (Colin, Matt, Ian, Emily, Ria, myself) all got a raft together and made fun constantly of our leader who was convinced that rafting involves lots and lots of cheering things like ""I don't know but I've been told, Montreal gets fucking cold"". Our raft guide didn't speak english very well and another guide fell out. It was really really fun. The best part of Frosh so far. So, finally I've got us back to the current moment (leaving out a lot, but that's ok). I'm about to head to the gym with Colin and tonight we have plans to have a big drinking night. Ria is buying the tequilla and we're all going to some club with the rest of SSMU after pre drinking at some girl's house (who we just met rafting). She lives in the spire of a church, so that could be cool. 
Ok, I know nobody read all that- but that's alright- I hope you are all having a wonderful time wherever you are!!!"

Turns out I'm really to damn busy to have one of these, but meh, if no one's reading it it really doesn't matter. I'm a whole year older than I was for my last entry :) Well, I'm still waiting to here from McGill, but I'm feeling a bit more excited about university- thanks to my pertty graduation present... a new Dell computer! It seems to work really well, it's fast, has a CD writer and DVD player, and so far is problem free. Amazingly I am actually figuring out how to handle things on here- I transfered my trillian stuff, address book, school work, and pictures off my camera on to it- for me that's a major accomplishment. I made my background a picture of McGill in July- about the only month of the year they don't have snow ;). 
I've also been talking to my cousin Jackie on MSN (another computer accomplishment), anf she's transfering to Ottawa U next year, meaning she'd be even closer to Montreal. That'd be really nice cuz she's a real sweetheart.
This weekend has been a good break- 3 much needed days off. I got to hang out with Jeff friend and explain why I was so upset the week before- that was definitely a good thing. Then Friday we tried watching ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" which Chas burned for me... but after about 5 minutes we decided we needed more mindless entertainment, and ended up watching ""Pretty Woman"" instead. Last night was spent with a group of us watching a red neck stand up comedy at Jeff's. I'm not sure which was more entertaining- the DVD or Kevin's druken reactions. Either way it was a good time. 
So, I managed to spend the whole morning working on new computer stuff, after a delicious pancake breakfast. I need to go ride... but the snow outside is killing my drive to head out there. Ok, I'm kicking my butt into gear. Happy Easter!"

As usual, all of Midland is somewhere sunny, including my mom and brother who jetted of to Arizona to visit my grampa. I, on the other hand, am house-sitting for my science teacher who is honeymooning in Jamaica. Life is fair, right? Forget paragraphs- I'm on spring break, thus I'll just keep rattling. Life as of late has been a rollercoaster. As a senior in high school I'm dealing with choosing a college to attend next year. Everyone else is excited- estatic- and I'm lost. It's taken me months to decipher what I want and what everyone else wants for me. Go here, go there, tution this, distance that. Finally this past week I realized something. I was happy the entire time I visited McGill (a University in Montreal). I was not thrilled about U of M and MSU... and as far as Maryland is concerned, I've never visited and it's too expensive to justify. Realistically it is probably true that there are more resoures and benefits to the Michigan colleges... but I don't think I care. So here comes the sucky ass part. I was supposed to find out about admitance to McGill last Friday. All week I had been dealing with the fact that my second quarter grades hadn't been turned in, and once that was all straighted out, a few heart attacks later, I call them on Friday. And what do I find out you ask (or even if you didn't)?... that my ""official"" ACT scores never reached them. Well fuck that. So, now, because it is outside of the country I have to wait approximately 2 weeks for the scores to be sent to them, then another 2 weeks for them to review my application. Thus, my chances of acceptance are, well, not so good. That sucks. I finally decide- after much emotion and soul searching, that McGill is where I'll be happy- and then this all happens. I had gone home to call McGill during lunch on Friday- my nerves were shot, and I was frustated and emotional about my decision. In other words, when I got back to school, upon the questioning of my friends who I had not told much about all this internal turmoil, I broke down. I had choosen not to share much because the whole problem in the first place what figuring out what I wanted. Why bring more peoles opions into it. Poor Jeff was totally clueless about the situation. Rightfully so. It's not like I got rejected- it's just that I had all this build up, mental and emotional tug of war, it climaxed, and now I have to sit unknowing for 4 more weeks. Who knows if I'll even find out before the US school May 1st deadline. Anyway, I know he was really confused, and I feel horrible because before I had a chance to explain myself he headed off to Florida for spring break. Argggggg. I'm sure that was more than any of you wanted to know, but I guess I needed to get it out given that it's a little lonely around here at the moment. That's enough venting for now."

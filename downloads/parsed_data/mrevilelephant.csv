"event","So I talked to Kartsounes yesterday, and he said he's been hearing rumors of me ""flunking out"".  This upset me.  I know I didn't do as well as I could of last year, but I still got a 3.0.  Thats just a little under average for a U of M engineer.  For some reason, word goes back to Hartland like I'm an alcoholic and failing out of school.  I know I shouldn't care that much about what people back home say, but at the same time I do.  Those are the people that helped raise me and make me the person I am today.  With rumors like that going back home, I seem to be letting them down.  

Also, I hate engineering.  Well I don't hate engineering, I hate the workload they expect you to do.  It's pretty much impossible.  I have 4 exams this week, and I couldn't study for them until this weekend because I had an assignment that took 10 hours to do.  Just a regular weekly homework assignment.  and that's for one of my five classes.

gah."

"event","So tonight is the first night I'll actually be sleeping in my dorm.  For those of you who dont know, I moved into ann arbor 16 days ago.  This just makes me realize how awkward it is to have a stranger in the same room with you, while you're unconcious.  Just casually, how weird.  Anyways I'm writing in this to keep myself awake until my Sleep timer runs out on my alarm clock (accidently pushed it instead of Alarm).  That seems like just enough time.

"event","so its tuesday.  You all should know that by now.  For some reason it feels like a thursday for me.  I'm just that exhausted.  blah.  On a lighter note, I get to start working on my bike (its a yellow Schwinn from the 70's) and that should be in riding shape by the time September rolls around.  Because everyone knows months roll.  not rock.  That would just get awkward, you'd get so close the end of the month, and then BAM!!!  You're back to the middle.  that's all I got to say."

"event","this week is slowly falling from my grasp.  It started with a tire blowout, then went to a wonderful case of poison ivy, and to top it off, I'm pretty sure I have a hernia.  Lovely.  

Also, I've been doing this slideshow thing for my parents 25th anniversary (which I'm way behind), and for some reason just seeing pictures and film of my family is making me re-evaluate a lot of who I am.  I don't really have a memory that holds any valuable information, and when I finally get reminded on how I was brought up and by whom, it changes a lot of things.  nothing like some confusion.

P.S.  come to my house tomorrow, the annual fireworks shindig is on.  Party starts at 3ish and fireworks are at 10.  There's no reason to go home either.  Just stay. forever."

I just want someone to be there with me.  That's horrible.  I mean it doesn't send that bad, but it is.  It seems as if I can't be happy unless I have someone to cling to.

I wanted to know what was wrong, so i kept bugging her.  She wouldn't tell me so i went to leave, and she wanted a kiss.  I asked her what was wrong again, and she didn't respond, so i went to leave.  She still wanted a kiss, so i asked her what was wrong, but she still wouldn't tell me.  So i left.  i dont know if that made any sense, but the last few sentences pretty much said that i wasn't going to kiss her if she didn't tell me what was wrong.  it's not something i wanted to do, but im not going to sit there and be passive about not knowing whats wrong with her.  Although few times i can actually help, those few are wonderful and i feel closer to her.  Most of the time i can listen though, and i dont think shes whining or that shes overexaggerating things.  Thats her, for some reason thinking for me.  Deciding what i think about things i dont even know yet.  I just want to be there for her, and it feels like im being shut out sometimes."

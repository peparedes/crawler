"event","I don't know what it is, but lately, I seem to be attracting bad things, though good things have been happening too.  Aside from the root canal, I have recently done something to mess up my thumb, of all things.  This might not be such a bad thing for most people, but for me...yeah.  One weekend I weeded all the walkways and the garden around my house, this was not helped by me, the next day attempting finger tip pushups.  My martial arts teacher BELIEVES in pushups; regular ones, hindu, and finger tip.  I can do the 1st two no problem, but the last, well...my thumb on my right hand gave out and I hit it pretty hard on the ground.  So it's in a splint sort of a thing.  Not broken, but the muscles are rather bruised.

On the bright side though, while wearing the temporary wrist brace, I went to Oktoberfest and was congradulated by the Kiwis (New Zeleanders) we were sitting with on the brilliance of wearing that and being able to lift my liter mug with minimal effort.  Some people where having to raise their mug with 2 hands.  A liter of liquid in a glass mug isn't like lifting a Coke.  It was a good time though.  A really good time.  We got 2 of the mugs.  Hadrurus is so happy with them.

Oh, he was SO drunk on the way back.  We had sat at the table drinking with the Kiwis all day.  About 4 liters, each.  I'd gotten up and wandered a little getting huge pretzels and the candied nuts and the roast chicken.  But I don't think Hadrurus got up enough b/c once we got up and walked to the bus, he started feeling it and I was only a little buzzed.  When we got back to the car, 5 hrs later, I drove  home b/c he was just getting hit with a hangover.   Next year, we'll take a train up and make reservations for a hotel for one night.  That way we can enjoy more of the festival.  Well, off to make cookies.  I'm downloading something right now, but check my Flickr page : http://www.flickr.com/photos/54199004@N00/ later.  I'm going to upload the few from Oktoberfest and the ones with Chuck Norris and a few others from around the area.

PS I finished Ancestor and have started on EarthCore by Scott Sigler.  Frick'n wicked!!!  Ancestor was awesome!  I really like how the characters all get what they deserve.  ::evil giggles::"

"event","Aside from my agravating last week...the last month I've been catching up on my TV series...I've gotten throught CSI to season 4, Angel to season 5, and am currently working on House Season 2.  Anyone have some suggestions on some others that might be interesting to bug the library to get?  24?  Sopranos?  oooo...Farscape!  

How about movies?  I saw The Devil Wears Parada last night.  That was funny...definately ownable.  There was a preview for the new 007...Jill wants to go see it. 

mmmm...sleepy...must be tired from all the ranting earlier.  Catch you later!"

"event","Hadrurus and I are looking for a place in DC to hold a wedding.  We scrapped Las Vegas.  I would rather have friends near and be able to spend more time with the kids than go to Vegas.  Besides, I just can't see having the dress move so often from place to place and not get lost or damaged.  I want minimum travel with it and maximum fun!  I only have 16 days to catch up on everything I've missed for the last 9 months.  I want to go to Outback and eat a bloom'n onion after hitting one of the climbing gyms.  The only thing I get to climb here are the walls!  Oh and sometimes ruins, but they aren't very high.

We've been busy at work with a new upgrade...it seems like everytime we go to load it something new goes wrong.  Oh, wait something DOES go wrong with every load and it's always a different problem.  It's so much fun. (dripping sarcasm)  At least I get to spend 2 weeks at our other offices and don't have to deal with this for a bit.  Maybe I can focus more on getting my books straightened out and get some study time in for tech sergeant.  That would be good. :)

And now for the ramble...Sorry
Gawd I miss seafood!  You'd think I could get it cheap living on a bay but nooooo...and besides you don't know where they got the fish from.  Buggers.  
Not that I didn't know it, but these people will rob you blind if you don't haggle with them!  You know how you know something, but you don't want to believe it until you see it for yourself...
sigh.

Why do people want to drag others down where they are?  ""If I'm not happy, you can't be either?""  With this mentality you have to ask yourself, ""When Eve gave Adam the apple, was she suddenly miserable and had to share her misery with him, or did she honestly want him to share in the knowledge that she gained?""  I'm going with the misery.  Heh.  Women are so...yeah...some of us just aren't right.
And now on with the search..."

"event","Well, it's almost 2AM here and I was up drinking with friends and were supposed to go to a club, but the chick crashed out from something Tori made called a Sun Spot.  Tori mixes a mean drink.  We started out watching anime, but then switched to need for speed.  I stink at that game.  It's nothing like playing Burn Out.  I miss that game. :(

Tomorrow Jill and I are going to IKEA to get some pillows...she has decided she wants to redecorate her living room.  Hadrurus and I are going to finalize some plans for Feb. in the afternoon when he wakes up.  Eh...I'm going to bed...

PS I took my PT test today.  I ran the 1.5 in 12:10, did 58 sit ups in 1 minute and 52 Push ups in 1 minute...this got me a score of 85.5.  Yay!!!  I'm proud of me.

"event","Yes, I took it upon myself to take a trip to Pergamum, also known as Bergama.  It was interesting.  The bus got there late, so we ended up going to the Asklepion of Pergamum first.  This is basically an early hospital/resort.  The idea being that you would sleep in the dormitory and the Gods would tell you how to cure what ailed you.  It was the priests speaking through tubes into the dormitory.  Anyway, once you got  your cure, you were supposed to make an offering.  Usually it was in the shape of your ailment...pain in hand, foot, nose, etc and it would be made in a material according to your wealth: gold, silver, marbel, etc.  They found these things in the ruins of the temple.
 Then to lunch and on to the Accropolis!  Some very neat ruins of a temple and what used to be a fortress built ontop of this very large hill.  (perhaps a small mountain.)

Anyway, lots of pictures can be found here:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/54199004@N00/
I took a lot of close up pictures of columns and sconces (?) and whatever you would call the top of the columns and buildings...eves?  Oh and there are a couple of pictures of some very nice rugs.   They were very nice about letting me take pictures b/c they knew I couldn't buy them. $15,000 for a rug barely 2ft x 2ft is a little steep for me, even if it is silk and took 3 years to make b/c it has over a million knots.  (Knots are how the hand made rugs are made)  Sigh...chok sijak! ve az yorgoonum.  (It's HOT and I'm a little tired)  I'm going to go to my cool room and fold and put away my laundry before Brian gets here.  Catch ya'll later"

"event","Well...here I am on a Monday night and I'm not in class...this sucks.  I ran around most of the day today with a blazing headache due to sinus problems...Actually managed to stick out most of the day largly due to being so busy I didn't think of hurting...(odd considering it was my HEAD that hurt)  Whatever...
At anyrate, I may just stay home tomorrow and catch up on the sleep I am unlikely to get tonight...

So I was out online the other day looking for some new t-shirts to freak out the Turks.  I have this one that has a big red evil smiley face that says ""Lead me not into temptation, I can find it on my own"".  I get a lot of stares with that...So I was out looking for a new shirt and I cam across this website...
http://www.sighco.com/index.html
Many cool tees there...but there was this one with a web address on it and not having much better to do I followed the link to here:
http://www.writheandshine.com/
Though the humor is a little dark..hey it's Goth, what do you want?  It is amusing.  Check out the ""Shine and his Guiness"" towards the bottom of the Comics page.  ""Excellent financial planning""  HA!

Now that I've said my piece...I'm going to bed.

Sure enough the monitor had a problem.  I turned it on and my first thought was ""Holy Sh*t!  They've gone to plaid!!!""  Here is a picture of their wonderful handy work.  The monitor is only plugged in to power, not a computer.

"event","Well, I can now say that I have been to Heiropolis...better known as Pamukkale.  I must admit that for a 4 hr drive...staying only 2 hrs there was a bit of a disappointment, but it was really too hot for much longer than that.  :(  Oh well, Jill and some friends are going back out there and she's invited me along.  YEAH!!  Jill likes to take pictures and I'm hoping to get some better ones, but these will have to do for now.
http://www.flickr.com/photos/54199004@N00/
No diving this weekend so I can save up for Kash next weekend.  It's supposed to be ranked in the top 50 dive spots.

I took my Turkish mid term today.  i think I did rather well, esp since I missed a couple of classes.  I'm going to have to ask the teacher to go over sentence structure again.  We haven't really done a lot of translating to Turkish, so that was a little difficult.  Here are a couple of phrases that I use frequently, spelled phonetically:
Chok yor-goon-um. - I am tired.
Good Ni-den, E-ahck-shahm-lahr? - Good morning, how are you?
Te-shek-u-lar - Thank you.
Tuby-tuby - Of course; Ok; yes, yes.....(my favorite to say)
Tum-mum - OK
Ner-e-de ana-ha-tar ve kent cart mium? -  Where are my keys and my bus card?  (usually in my pocket, but the question must be asked as it's a long way to/from work if I have to walk)

Any way, I'm learning and having fun.  The new Chaplain roller blades, so he and I are going to go out to the NATO base and freak them out.  There are smooth asphalt roads out there instead of the rough stuff or *twitch* cobblestones.  Afterwards I can hit the pool.  That will be nice.

I started a new craft project tonight.  A croched blanket...we'll see how far I get on it before I get fed up with not being able to keep the edges straight. ;P
Past my bed time."

"event","Thur.  Jill and I went and bought masks and snorkels and I bought fins.  Mine are pretty bright yellow.  Heh, you won't lose me under water!
Friday Jill wasn't feeling well and went home early.  So after work, I brought her dinner.  While getting said dinner, I met a friend of the Kebab Stand, His name is Tekken.  His friend's name is Idnur...it sounds pretty when she says it.  Anyway she's a jewler and a tarrot card reader.  Kind of neat.  Anyway, delivered Jill's dinner, talked for a bit and went home.

Sat.  Was awakened by a pleasant phone call and got moving on packing for my day trip to Ceseme (Chez-may).  I rode down with Jon and Brian (not Hadrurus).  We listened to Jimmy Buffett and sang along.  The boat was not overly crowded.  We were the first on board, the day was shaping up to be beautiful.  We got to the first dive site, the first group got suited up and went in, then my guys went in.  I joined them without a wetsuit as I was not diving.  I snorkeled around for a while and when I got back to the boat, the divers were coming back up to the boat, which means that I was in the water for a good hour or so just fluttering around.  When the guys came up, John asked me if I'd gone between this rock and the cliff.  I hadn't b/c I didn't want to go alone so we all went.  WOW!!!  It was such a difference between the open water!  The open water has golden brown, and yellow plants and these pearly white spiral looking things.  The cleft had pink and purple and red plants and white aneominies and orange fungus!!!  A riot of color.  It was beautiful.  John brought up a red starfish when we were making our way back to the boat.  It was pretty.  We let it go.  
Then it was lunch and a short trip to the second dive site.  This site was warmer and had more things for me to explore.  I had by now gotten used to breathing through the snorkel and was barely flicking my hands or feet to move.  It was great.  I saw a Rasp (Raz), a bright green fish with a bluey-purple face and pink/orange racing stripes down it's sides.  I saw what I think were small sheep's heads, and some fish that was about a foot long with a grey face, purple body and a yellow spot on the top about halfway back.  I aslo found my own red starfish, though I did not pick this one up.  I saw many sea urchins.  They usually have something stuck in their spines, but one in particular stands out in my mind.  It had a cigarett butt stuck to it!  Humanities bad habbits are spreading!!!  It's not just the mokies who smoke anymore!  (If you don't know what I'm talking about: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oqcAvKtr5f4&search=smoking%20chimp )

Any way, despite being a good sea monkey and putting sunblock on after everytime I got out of the water, I still got sunburnt on my back and shoulders.  Irk.  That's it!  I'm wearing a t-shirt next time I hit the water to snorkel!  I obvoiusly won't have this problem once I learn to SCUBA dive as I will be wearing a wetsuit.  Yes, I will need it as the water is quite cold.

Today I did laundry, the dishes and started cleaning up one of my rooms so that I can start moving boxes from the living room into there.  I got it mostly done before Jill called me to go on a short shopping trip.  She is still not feeling well so I've been keeping her company.  I will go back in a little bit and finish up a few things.  I really want my place to start looking like a home.  Talk to you later!"

"event","It was brought to my attention that even though my tales are amusing, I need to impart to you, my friends what it's like here.  Jill says that if you've seen one city, you've seen them all.  Be that as it may...the rant for of the day is Traffic...Let me say this first...the Turks I have talked to are the sweetest people who will go out of their way to make you happy, but put them behind the wheel and well...
Turkey has traffic laws...these laws are looked upon more like the Pirate Code; guidelines.  A three lane road here is really a 4-5 lane road depending on how much of a shoulder there is and how small the vehicle.  Woe betide you if there is space between you and the next car.  They have a Tetris mind set and they WANT to fill that space!!!  There are of course people here who ride bikes, mopeds, motorcycles everywhere, and I do mean everywhere, including the highway.  Motorcycles will glide right up between the cars and buses.  One of the guys here said something about wanting to just open the door on one of them Clouseau style.  The one rule the seem to semi follow unless they *think* they are faster is the bigger you are the more right you have to right of way.  It is perfectly natural for them to honk their horns at you for cutting them off, getting too close, or just b/c you ticked them off.  Oh yeah, and when you are crossing the street and aren't moving fast enough or a taxi letting you know that they are available to give you a ride or heck to just let you know they are coming and you REALLY shouldn't step off the curb.
Speaking of curbs...they vary in heigt here from none to 18 inches.  The lower ones are consdiered excellent parking spots.  They also have these cement mushrooms that are about a foot in diameter and about a foot high.  Jill says she SO wants to bring a Chevy Tahoe over here just to see what they'd make of it.  Esp for the towing aspect.  They don't use tow trucks like we are used to.  Here they are flat bed affairs with something that looks like a sling.  The bed is about 10 feet long.  Highly amusing to watch them getting a car up there as you are never quite sure whether or not it's going to 1) fall out of the sling or 2) fall off the bed.  And no, they don't secure it as they are driving off.  
Mrs. Varlikli said that people here are more often alive by accident than anything.  Fear not my friends.  I am not in that much danger.  I am not driving and usually take the bus to go places beyond what I feel like walking.  Which, as Jill points out and was previously noted, usually have the right of way.  Ok, I've taken up enough of your time and Jill's computer.  Jill says ""Hi"".

PS I just finished a book called ""There will be Dragons"".  Rather amusing tale about how in the 41st centurty something goes horrendously wrong and SCA reenactors help people start to get along in the REAL world again because everything had been done for them for so long.  Oh and another one called ""A Dirty Job"" about this guy becoming death.  It was written by the same guy who wrote ""The Stupidest Angel""."

I got moved in and have furniture, but not much else until Mon when they are delivering my stuff...well, part of my stuff...the rest hasn't cleared customs yet.  I might get to go diving on Sat...we will see...then Sun I am going to clean my apartment.  It was supposed to be cleaned when I moved in, but I was walking around barefooted and went to take a shower and all this black crap came off my feet.  Yeah...that's gotta go.  All the city smog stuff that settles in the houses and just everywhere...it's like Estrella dust.  Bleh.

I went to soccer practice this afternoon.  I'm going to have to get pictures of all these guys.  They are a funny bunch.  Chadash, Haroon, Jim, Mo-di, Carlos, Alatin...they are fun.  Better go...I'm using Jill's laptop and she and I both need to crash for the shopping trip tomorrow.  Later!"

"event","Last night Galeteseri beat the socks off the favorite, Fenerbachi from Istanbul, for the Turkish National Football (Soccer) Championship.  You should have seen the people on the First Ccordon!!  They were crowded around TVs at these in/outdoor caffes and spilling into the street and everytime their team made a goal they would litterally run around shouting ""Goooooooooooal!!!""  And then...they won!  and these people became insane and beeped their horns and banged drums and tooted horns...(I feet like quoting a verse from Dr Sues).  Until probobly around midnight.  My room is on the 14th floor of the Hilton and I still heard these mad people.  On the bright side...they were deffinately more cheerful (if that's possible) today unless of course their team was Fenerbachi.  

I know I am probobly butchering the names, but this is how they sound so this is what you're getting. :)  
I move into my apartment tomorrow.  All of my stuff is in country and I can have it, hopefully, early next week.  Normally I might protest, but I can't get a phone or net access until I have the ""Home communications briefing""  and since I can't get that until next week ne way...eh.  
Friday we are playing hooky and going to the Bazarr to look for fabric and other sundry items.  I will let those interested know the prices.  :)

"event","Last night I stayed up readin b/c someone dicided that 2300-0100 was a good time to move metal across pavement...I heard it 14 floors up w/windows and drapes closed...so today I slept in...it was very nice...when I finally got out of bed around 0830...I decided to go for a walk and get breakfast.  I bought some fig and walnut pies from the place on the corner then walked down to the 1st Cordon.  This is the walking path/park that pretty much encircles the Bay of Izmir.  There is sculpture dotted all along the way, the obligatory statue of Atta Turk (don't dis this man!)  and any number of cafes.  It is a plesant place to stroll along..there is a lovely breeze, though we non-Turks tend to shie away from the spray should the water become choppy.  According to Jeremy, up until a couple of years ago, if you fell in, you were better off drowning rather than break the surface to ""survive"" the treatments they would inflict upon you.  Raw sewage and sea water are a notoriously bad combination and with 4 million people running around this town...yeah...  So anyway... strolling down the way...a parade started.  Not knowing what it was for and seeing a significant amount of polici about, I decided it was time to head back to the hotel.  
The maid was cleaning my room, so I grabbed my swim suit and headed for the pool.  That was nice.  After I got back to my room I lay on the bed and was awakened by Jill on the phone at 1730...guess i was tired. :)  Called the Mom's to wish them a happy day and then went to dinner with Jill and Jeremy.  Spending time with them is always interesting.  They play well off of each other.  Not that either of them seems particularly interested in the other, just that they both are a little jaded and sarcastic and they banter back and forth.  Well, I'd better go settle my bill for the hotel and get some sleep.  I have an around the town tour tomorrow and get to sign the lease on my apartment in the afternoon with my landlord.  Yeah!  My loaner furniture will be in on Tues.  All for now...will take pics of the bazarr...post 'em when I get a change.  Miss you all!"

My new apartment's ceilings are a little low to practice in...I'm sure as hell not going to go play in one of the local parks until I learn the language...and now they are taking their sweet time letting me know wether or not I can bring them into the gym at work.  After I specifically asked Family Support to find this out for me and they said it was no problem.  Good grief...
Oh, and the kicker...the girl who was trying to ""help"" me?  Yeah, she said that I ought to staff a letter through even though one of the JAG is already researching it.  That would mean kind of going behind his back...wouldn't it?  Mmmm?  That would make me enemies....never mind that I am Cell Phone Queen, I don't need drama at this time in my career.  Granted it wouldn't be much drama...but it would be enough I'd wished I hadn't.  
I can't wait to move into my apartment next Tues!  My computer should be delivered soonish...it's already in country...I just have to have them deliver it. :D  Yeah!!! Pictures to you soon.
It's only 7:30 PM here, but I'm going to bed.  I haven't been sleeping well...I woke up last night paniced and confused.  I begged off going out with Jeremy and Jill...maybe some sleep, if I can get it, will do me good.  Talk to you later."

"event","First My confession:  I lied...I didn't just go swimming on Sat...I went on my first SCUBA dive!  My apologies...but I wanted to surprise Hadrurus and I didn't want to disappoint him if my ears couldn't handle it.  (stupid eustation tubes!)  By the time I'm done, I will be PADI certified to dive in open water.  Any way it was very fun and a great day right until the boat didn't start after the last dive of the day.  The started wouldn't turn over so they had to call a tow boat which was smaller than the one we were on and we all thought that it was going to tear apart a couple of times.  Any way...I got to hold a sea urchin.  Not one of the ones with the long spines that you see in the movies, but short spines.  It was a deep red-purple with white tips.  It felt funny as it tried to crawl over my hands.  I also saw a sea cucumber.  It looked like a long brown lump of poo on the sand, but one of the other divers poked it and it moved.  Oh, you should see this water!  So BLUE and so clear!  Geoffery...I got some pics of the local sail boats for you.  I took pics of the trip as well.  
The good news is that I found a place and had the security inspection this evening.  The bad news is that I can't move in until the 16th which means I don't get my computer for a little longer and I can't d-load the pics until then.  Irk.  Oh well.

Last night I sat in a pub just off the 1st Cordon with the breeze coming in through the doors and windows...had a beer (local pilsner) and talked with my friends and made some new ones.  A bunch of Brits that work in the city.  They were a riot...esp Chris who claims to be a former communist.  We had a great discussion about all kinds of things including politics.  I never discuss politics...must have been the beer. ;)
Tonight I am going to go hit the pool in the hotel...eat nothing in particular...read my book...and go to bed at a decent hour.  I'm having a problem settling at night...I lay there and look at the dark ceiling and listen to the city...thinking of nothing in particular...  
Off to the pool...we may be hitting the sea again this coming Sat, but I have to see what my teacher says...
I'm going to soccer practice tomorrow with Jill...we both want to play.  I talked to the security guys about bringing the swords to the gym...they want to check with legal first...grrrrr...if we have it at the Academy...then we ought to be able to have it everywhere else esp if the people are authorized.  Besides...there's a guy teaching a Kendo class and they get to play with the wooden swords...  Sorry...I'm ranting...swimming...yeah...C ya!"

"event","Greetings and salutations from the land of the Turks...
I am well and in good health.  I think I shall be in much better health when I return to you as we have walked pretty much everywhere the last 3 days.  It has been very nice.  My comrades in these travels are Jeremy the Sarcastic and Jill the Persuasive.  :)  We have been taking care of our meeting everyone and find Jill and I homes.  Jill has found a lovely place with a large balcony which after the first time we saw it, she was already calling it 'her apartment'.  I think I will take one close to her as she has transportation arriving shortly.  I have been taking pictures, but am unable to load them at this time.  I hope to be able to at least get them onto a computer by the end of next week.  The people I am to work with seem very nice and quite helpful.  Time will tell.  It is funny how people react when I tell them what my job is here.  (I hand out cell phones.)  Jeremy has informed me that I will need to start trying to replace some of these buggers, but I think at the rate people are losing them, I may not, even though they are buying new ones when they do.  It might be a headache waiting to happen, but I think I can handle it.  
Especially if Jill is really interested in fencing.  We have adequate gym space to start a class and I looked at a place yesterday that even though it was a ground floor apartment, it had a HUGE living room and a great upstairs hallway.  (Out of my price range)  We are taking a trip on Sat to go swimming at one of the local resorts.  Should be fun.  I will write more tomorrow morning.  I am 7 hrs ahead of ya'll, so if you reply to me...it might be a bit before I can get back to you.  Love to all.

(I missed my last appiontment with him b/c I was doing important work related things and it slipped my mind) All I can say is, at least I was putting my work ahead of myself...that might work...riiiiight.  :P  Oh well, at worst I will have to rechedule my flight...no skin off my nose, not my $.

I think I will go home do a couple of push-ups, a few crunches, and call it a work out.  Then I will jump on the computer and start working on cleaning it up to give to my Mom.

Things to do between now and next Fri:
Clean up Mom's PC
Finish going through papers
Go through rest of stuff movers didn't take, throw away, or pack it up
Clean up and delete crap off my work PC
Burn my pst files to disk
Wash and pack clothes

That ought to keep me busy.  Oh and silly me...I volunteered to be the narrator for an awards ceremony...WTPTF was I thinking?!??  (thats: WT-Purple-Thunder-F)
Yay me! *headpalm*"

Just give me the hardware to play with and I am a happy Shen...you can trace wires, test the lines, etc...with software, you have to be smarter than the programer and considering I think most of them are smoking something and have NO idea what the user wants the effing program to do...*headdesk**headdesk**headdesk*

All I want to do is enter data into this program.  Not normally a problem on the old system.  It's a happy system, but THEY (the powers that be) tell me that 1) the old computer must be replaced 2) I must use a different program (this program does not meet the needs of me or my users)  
Replacing the computer with a newer spiffy-er one would be OK, if the program liked the new OS.  It was written to run on 98 or 2K.  It does NOT like XP.  
Everytime I try to enter data into the program it tells me that it's out of memory.  HOW can it be out of EFFING memory!!!  It's an EFFING stand-alone machine w/bare minimum of programs!!!  Normally I like this program b/c it's easy to use, but I really really hate software problems...

The tech support is baffled b/c they say it runs just fine on THIER XP box.  Oookay....well fine, but it doens't run on MY XP box.  I have uninstalled it AND a couple of other programs we thought might be causing the problem, but it still has the SAME effing problem.  I am SO frustrated and I have other things I need to do but this NEEDS to get done and and...erf.

Going to lunch...chicken good...then I will find some chocolate to pounce on...or maybe a Peep or 3...


Yay!!! Fencing tonight!!!!"

"event","Well, Hadrurus and I had the kids since Wed night.  It was fun.  I was proud of us that we got the kids out the door and to school by 0700 so we could be to work by 0730-ish. Dealing with the kids was a walk in the park compared to what I was handling at work.  They want to turn an account of mine over to someone who, though smart, takes FOREVER to grasp simple things.  Ug!  To top it off, the program I need to train him on decided that it no longer wants to accept certain input.  Tech support is taking it's time getting back to me.  Grrrr... only 10 days left...only 10 days left...deep breath...
Any way...
Friday night we took the kids to an interview for the Disney Channel.  Torian really wanted to give it a shot and she even was accepted for a call back, but you had to join the agency's accademy to get to the REAL audition next weekend.  I would have said yes, but they wanted a lot of $ w/no guarantee of her getting the part.  No thanks.  Simon and I decided that it would be better to get her into a theatre troup here locally if she wants to do that.

Saturday - Ah what a grand day!  We went to Night on the Town and beat the Nobles 4 - 1.  Ha-ha!  During one of the res battles, I was legged right in the middle of the field on the Peasants' side.  Peasants kept asking me if I wanted to go res, but I said no.  I found that I was rather useful in alerting my people to the danger of the treacherous nobles having gotten through our lines.  It was nice to be a part of the battle and be able to watch the mele.  We lost that battle, but not for lack of trying. :)  The next battle went a little better for the peasants...there was more stealing of the gold back and forth and I had many DFBs (death from behind). OH, the best shot of that battle, was Kenji...the Nobles were down to the last man...he was fighting 3 - 4 peasants...Kenji walks right through the line and slashes the noble's throat with a dagger.  It was so unexpected, the noble stood there a moment with his blades up. Then it was time for lunch and Argyll's Prize, which had many good fights.
Then we had a woods battle or two...they were long and the hills steep after fighting and the footing treacherous.  Seamus lost his shoe a couple of times and one guy hurt his heel somehow.  Many people fell over the logs and brush, but all in all it was a good fight.
Torian had been rounded up from the sand box to go make bread with a bunch of the other children.  It came out lovely.  Payton continued to play in the sand box and on the swings and was a through sandy mess when the day was done.  He was so tired at the end of the day, he even complain about going for BBQ chicken afterwards!  (It was amazing...he was COVERED in BBQ sauce, face, hands, arms, but not a drop on his clothes...I was impressed)  While at said BBQ resturant, we engaged  in a civilized food fight with some friends from the East Kingdom.  Now, in a civilized food fight, you take the food to their table, and place it there.  There is NO actual throwing of food!  So, we started off with a corn muffin, they returned with BBQ sauce and something unidentifyable, we returned with corn cobs, and so it went until they returned with ice cream on a spoon, we returned with tea bag and lemon, they returned with spit wads...then we had the brilliant idea of surrender...we were going to send over a napkin on a straw, but then decided that we should all make them and wave them over the curtain that seperated our tables.  They came over shortly to negotiate the terms of our surrender, even suggesting we pay their tab.  Baroness Kitty suggested we not kick their backsides when the Pontoons next meet with them.  Baron Marcellus argued that since we had surrendered that we were under their protection and should not pay the bill.  They got into a heated discussion on just how were were going to kick their backsides and the matter of who was paying for what was forgotten.  In the end...I think we won. :)
Sunday - The children were sent to another roon while the Easterbunny's leavings (those lovely little cocopuffs) were arranged.  The looks on their faces was priceless!  Tor got a new Bratz that was supposed to be Genie themed...but they put a crystal ball in there with a henna tatooed doll.  Hmmm...they are mixing their myths...but Tor didn't care.  Payt got a couple of airplanes and some runway to fly them from.  He thought that was pretty keen.  I'd taken them both to the Pentagon a week or so ago and showed them the 20ft display case of all the airplanes.  He really liked the big ones and the stealths.  They both got some candy.  By lunch time, neither of them was really all that hungry. :)  Can't imagine why.
All in all it was a great weekend."

I have a 2001, 4-cylander, maroon, 4 door Dodge Neon.  
It has power steering, working tape deck, and anti-lock brakes.  That's as modern as this puppy gets.  
No power locks, no power windows, and no cruise control.  (But look at it this way, less to break!)
The AC works as does the heat...provided you are not trying to hit 60 in .2 seconds.  (It's one or the other until you get up to speed)
Oh, it has 80K on it, new belts, new-ish tires.  It has been in no accidents.
Kelly Blue Book prices it at $3,600.  OBO

An Air Force General, a Navy Admiral, a Marine General, and a Army General 
are standing around one day talking about which service is braver.

The Navy Admiral says the Navy is the bravest here I'll prove it. ""Seaman 
come here,"" he says. The Seaman runs over salutes the Admiral and says ""Yes, 
sir?!""

""Seaman, I want you to climb to the top of that tower over there and jump 
off,"" says the Admiral.

""Yes, sir!"" says the Seaman and salutes. He then proceeds to the top of the 
tower and jumps off; hits the ground and dies. ""That's brave."" says the 
Admiral.

The Army General says ""That's nothing. Soldier come here."" The Soldier runs 
over to the General, salutes, and says ""Yes, sir?!!""

""Soldier, I want you to climb to the top of that tower over there and dive 
straight down into the ground,"" says the Army General.

""Yes, sir!!"" says the Soldier and salutes. He then proceeds to the top of 
the tower and dives off head first straight into the ground and dies. 
""That's brave."" says the Army General.

The Marine General laughs and says ""I can beat that. Marine get over here."" 
The Marine runs over to the General salutes, and says ""YES, SIR?!!!""

""Marine, I want you to climb to the top of that tower over there jump off do 
three flips and then dive into the ground,"" says the Marine General.

""My honor, SIR!!!"" says the Marine. Gives a crisp salute then climbs the 
tower jumps off, does three flips, and dives head first straight into the 
ground and dies. ""That's brave."" says the Marine General.

The Air Force General says ""Gentlemen, you havn't seen anything yet. Airman 
come here."" The Airman runs over to the General salutes, and says ""Sir?""

""Airman, I want you to climb to the top of that tower over there, jump off, 
and dive head first into the ground."" says the Air Force General.

The Airman looks at the tower then back at the General pauses for a second 
and says ""Screw you, Sir!!!"" Flips him off and walks away.

The Air Force General says ""Now, THAT was brave."""

"event","Wow...it's been a while since I posted...could have something to do with my being busy packing and all the frigg'n appointments...
So yeah...the movers came last week and packed up all my stuff.  It was supposed to take up only 2.5 crates, but ended up with 4.  Mercy!  I have really got to get rid of stuff when I get to Turkey!
Hadrurus, the kids, and I cleaned up the apartment Sat and Sun.  The kids were a huge help.  They cleaned the marks off the wall and picked up the fuzz the vacuum missed.  Simon and Gwenavere came by to take a few things...I helped Simon get the kids back over to his place b/c the truck was too full of stuff.  It was nice getting to tuck my son into his own bed.  He's so small and the bed seems so big.
Tor was with me when I closed and locked the door.  She said, ""Do you feel like you're forgetting something?""  ""No, hon, I just feel like I'm turning a page in a book.""  And I thought to myself...""No, I'm not forgetting.  I'm remembering that I can't take you with me.""  It's not that I don't want them to, it's that they can't go with me.  It's not allowed where I'm going.  They're so small now...when I get back, they'll be so much bigger.  Well...such is life...and such is the life of military personnel.  At least they'll be safer here.

All this moving and inner turmoil...my fighting was really off last Thurs.  My qualification shooting 
(M-16) was pitiful...the practice was good, the qualification sucked.  I passed, but I'm not happy with my score.  My running this week sucked...I'm almost scared to go climbing.  Not really, but that would be just one more thing that I'm sucking at.  
Bleh...29 more duty days and 41 days til I fly.  ""Leaving on a jet plane...don't know when I'll be back again"""

Over the weekend and yesterday it was just a cough that wasn't much...no sign of anything else and then this morning WHAM!  I'm in my usual morning rush to get dressed and suddenly realize...I feel like crap.   Hmmmmm...better take a temp...yup, got a fever, aching joints, even my knuckles ached.  Weird.  SPent the morning in bed.  Went to the Dr. in the afternoon.  They gave me some meds and an IV for dehydration (despite my having drank a large cup of something every hour)and sent me home.  Yeah.  Spent all day in bed.  I have SO much to do and so little time to do it and well...today I just had to say f*ck it.  I caught up on my sleep and gave the cats some much needed attention.

Hey, I took the http://dragonhame.com online Inner Dragon quiz and found out I am a Time Dragon on the inside.

In the war between good and evil, a Time Dragon tends to walk the fine line of Neutrality....
When it comes to the powers of Chaos vs. those of Law and Order, your inner dragon is a risk taker and answers to no one....
As far as magical tendancies, Magical spells come as natural to the Time Dragon as breathe from it's body....
During combat situations, whether by spells or by claw, your inner dragon will do whatever it takes to get the job done....

"event","Well, my belated birthday present was a guided tour on snowmobiles around the mountains.  We went about 22 miles.  It was SO much fun.  Kind of a cross between jet skiing and riding a motorcycle.  Hadrurus drove most of the way for which I was very glad esp on some of the areas.  There were a couple of places where there was mountain, trail, drop off.  It was kind of scary, but it was still fun, esp when we started taking jumps.  Don't worry, it wasn't near the drop off places...
Matt tried to get me to go snow tubing, but I didn't want to take the chance of getting hurt before war.  Maybe if we had done this BEFORE this morning when Hadrurus and I had to leave for the airport.  
Any way, we are in Seattle now and will be heading to Estrella @ the butt crack of dawn tomorrow morning.

Oh, I DFB'd Tora when he picked us up from the airport.  I didn't really want to, but Hadrurus said he'd find it amusing.  Tora did laugh. So, I didn't feel too badly about it.  Kage is here too.  We are going to have a grand time."

"event","Hello all...I'm in Colorado visiting my Bro.  We (Hadrurus and I), have been having a blast.  We've been on the go since we got here.  Matt has been keeping us busy.  Last night we showed Matt how we fence and armored up a couple of people and showed them some basic moves.  it was a lot of fun.  Hadrurus fought one of Matt's friends.  His name is Tell (Yes like William Tell).  He was quite fast.  His background is strip fencing, but he was so quick. It was a really good couple of rounds.  After that we all got into a hundred person hottub.  It was outside and the moon was full with only a partly cloudy sky.  There was a cloud ring around the moon.  It was beautiful!  Until we had to get out.  Then we had to hop accross the snow to the building.  My shirt was frozen to me in a couple of steps.  Yes, I would do the same thing again.  It was awesome!  Today, Matt is taking me out for my belated B-day present.  He won't tell me what it is, but apparently I will need a snowsuit.  Better go I have things to do.  L8tr!"

So, you ask what am I doing writting on my LJ and not working on those?  Well...panic is my inspiration or something like that.  I hate writing these things.  Action/Impact/Result and with elipses in the middle so your brain fills in the appropriate info, but also so that your mother, who only has a vauge notion of what it is that you do on a daily baisis, can understand what it is that you are saying.  All this and you must convey it's importance.  So it doesn't look like yo sit and pick your nose all day.  Bleh.  I'm just glad that I don't have to write these all the time.  Mercy.  Better hit the keys on those...thanks for reading..."

First thank you James for your kind words about mom.&nbsp; Yes I know the holidays were lopsided and I apologize but you know how my mom was, especially around Xmas! *L*&nbsp;&nbsp; She was always like that... drove me crazy.....&nbsp; THe sad thing is last xmas we didn't celebrate christmas together on the day for the first time I can honestly remember..... unfortunatly it turned out to be the last one.

MOm really could light up a room.&nbsp; I wish in some ways I was like her... but Martha stewart i could never be, and my mom could give Martha stewart a run for her money *L*




Just remember.......&nbsp; Your parents won't be there forever......&nbsp; treasure them.

Don't worry about stirring things up with that post. Unless the wife gets mad *L*&nbsp; That isn't my fault :-P

Tina leaves me to program all of them and miguel and crew show up... another 10 machines added to an already large pile!

Well after getting them programed batteries plugged in and a crew briefing later I get to counting in the stockroom.  We finish and when i get back from break i show up in the middle of crew briefing.   No big deal.  i get on the floor and not even halfway through my 1st section my battery starts dying.... I go to replace it and karen has me retrieve a battery belt and the stop and goes.

Later my battery dies(again) and when i go to get more they have me refill the pack with fresh batteries....  

well to make a long story short i only do 4 sections on the sales floor all night....


Q pulls me off counting 30 min before we are done and tells me to get all the machines ready... i get them all together and realize i have 14 cases of machines from 3-5 offices to figure out whose belong to whom!

ack!


well i guess they dont call it equip manager for nothing eh?  *L*


OH and i finally got a copy of durans' first 11 videos(a honest to god real copy >:P )"

"event","Just a note I do read certain people's blogs and don't care if they know it.

With that disclaimer being said, I found out I do have something in common with my ex's wife... We both can't stand Brian(i assume it is the same guy that comes over and does the plumming once in a blue moon).    I knew the guy was a creep(he made passes at me....) and for some fucked up reason he once in a while sends me jokes he think is funny) but I never knew he was like that.

Wouldn't suprise me.  In the least.


My thoughts go out to his ""girlfriend""(i hope for her sake that is no longer the case)"

Things are getting even more interesting...

Quincy the other day while we were finishing up the linen and things had told me and sharon I we ought to look into applying for the management jobs coming available next month.... I was like ok.... The last couple of times it was someone else he said this to.... 

Maybe soon i will learn pharmacy....   We are doing quite a few Eckards lately... And how do you count what isn't there?( i am serious... it is for stocking purposes! I know because i was counting what wasn't there *L*)

And, after months of telling me I should learn the computer stuff at work, Marshall finally got me to try my first thing on the computer the other day >:)

Evidence I have way too much time on my hands(ummmm a Brandy parody! I am sure anyone who works for WIS or Regis can relate to this)

Our aq1 who art in topstock
Accurate be your upc
your end of day come your finished reports be done
on sales floor as it is in stock room
Give us this day our daily break
and forgive us our sitdowns as we forgive those newbies who screw up for the umpteenth time
lead us not into insanity and deliver us from whining...
 
amen."

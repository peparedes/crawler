"event","So i dont even remember how yesterday started all i remember is about last night.
Me and Ami went to the movies and were gonna meet Robert and his friend. But after we waited forever they never showed up. Me and Ami were gonna go watch a movie but then there werent really any good movies out so we just decided not to. So we were just standin there chillin lol and Ami sees that she's got a new message on her phone so she checks it. Then she says whoaa that sounded freakishly like Chris. Then i listened to it and i was like OMG!!! that is Chris. Then a couple minutes later he calls back and Ami let me talk to him. I was like hello and chris is like who is this i was like Amber and he was like omg ive missed you so much blah blah blah...yeah so we liked talked forever and omg i was so happy. then i had to switch to a pay phone cuz i was waistin ami's minutes which idk how im gonna repay you for but ill try. Anyways it was like the greates 2 hours of my life and guess what it turns out he really does love me and he has been thinkin about me. which is good to know.He even cummed for me right there on the phone lol. but then we got picked up and i went home and me and Katelyn sat in the car and talked about it forever, dont ask me why lol.I started thinkin bout the whole thing. and im like really really scared i have no clue what to do. like if i go back to him am i just setting me up for heartbreak again. idk. He wants me to call him back and i wanna call him back to but ive already been through enough and i dont want to get in more trouble just when my parents are actually starting to trust me. I think we should just keep in touch as like friends untill he can actually be here with me. which actually might happen cuz he's workin and if he gets a car he said he will come down here but you never know.

Ami- thanks for everything last night i mean u just like stood there in the freezing cold and let me waist ur minutes lol Thanks a lot. Oh yeah and please tell me the second it happens if Chris says anything to u about liking u or whatever i wanna know the second it happens so that i can let him know that its over before anything happens. Please dont not tell me and then just let me find out later.

Nicole-Sorry i just like hung up on you but chris was on the other line and i never get to talk to him."

"event","I didnt know what to write about so i asked chris and he said to write about how cool he was so here i am writin about how cool he is well lets see he likes the same food i do, he likes the same songs i do, he's really funny, he actually lives in California and he's a christian which will make my parents happy lol.
 Im scared to go to the movies friday, im scared to get with anyone again because now i know how it feels to get your heartbroken. Yeah im tryin to move on but its really hard. And the way things are goin umm idk yeah he says he likes me but he doesnt really show it, he's never online and when he is he has to be told before he starts talkin to me. It seems like he gets with every girl he meets so i dont feel so special that he wants to get with me. so if he really wants to be with me he better step it up a noch and start lettin me know that he really wants to be with me cuz right now it doesnt really sound like he does."

In fact, his pictures are the ones that were chosen to be used on the snowflake 39-cent stamps!!  Check out his webpage...the pictures are gorgeous!!

It is nicer because it has more levels for progression.  It's not a heavy plastic like the LitterKwitter, but it can support a 25-pound cat.  And, it was only like $34 including shipping...verses Litter Kwitter at $89 plus shipping.  We are going to have a recorder set up to be able to keep an eye on them.  I CAN'T WAIT!!!  We'll also be keeping our webpage updated, so check it out at www.jonathanandjanelle.com."

"event","So here I am again...it's been a while, but I'm back!!!  :-)

Update on the kitties...still looking at toilet training them...  I found the seat I like at <a href=""http://www.litterkwitter.com/en/index.php"">Litter Kwitter</a>.  I have a feeling that might be our best bet.  A bit more expensive than I wanted to spend, but we will check it out at the PetSmart that just opened and see if it is what we need for them.  It would be so nice to toilet train them!!  And, with Jonathan's contract job being done now (he had a job that was supposed to last 4-6 weeks and they got it done in 3), he will be home during the initial time period that he'll be able to keep an eye on them.

I finally heard from Heidi the other week.  She has ""forgiven"" me for yelling at her.  Whatever.  We talked for about 20 minutes...got caught up in each other's lives, and that was that.  Didn't set anything up to get together...nor did I want to.  I found out about a week after we talked, from a reliable source (can't relay how or who), that she wasn't fired from her old job because of me.  She has told me that she was fired because of some adult DVDs she was selling for me (because I bought them in bulk on eBay with the idea of selling them for more back on eBay...and it didn't work out that way, so I had to get rid of them)...as well as that she got written up because of an e-mail I sent her...she said the write-up had a copy of the e-mail and everything.  Well, my very reliable source said that they saw the personnel record (anyone at the job can look at it), and I had NOTHING to do with her getting fired.  In all of her write-ups, there was nothing about an e-mail from me or about the DVDs.  She was getting written up for things like being late to work, mouthing off to customers, and visiting restricted webpages (which they took back the write-up because I.T. should have blocked that).  I'm SO pissed off at her that she would do anything like that to me...letting me believe for so long that I was at fault...knowing how horrible I was feeling.  I'm sorry, but that is SO not a friend.

I got my help at work, so that is going really well.  She (Jackie) started on her new schedule today and I got pounded with projects to work on as well.  I'm actually enjoying things again!

I'm thinking for school, I am going to finish my Bachelor's in Retail Management and then go for my Masters in Marketing.  It's only a few extra classes and would be a great team-up with the Retail Management degree.

Well...I better get going...  I'm on the verge of getting Jonathan to go with me to the store now to look at it!!  :-D"

"event","Every morning when I use the restroom, Meira beats me in there...I'll hold her and then when I get up to flush, she has to watch it go down.  Jonathan would joke around saying that he would leave the lid up one day and see if she actually used it so we could work on getting rid of the litterbox.

Well...Tuesday was the day.  Apparently (this was just relayed to me last night!), Meira tried to use the toilet.  Unfortunately, she jumped up on the edge of the seat, faced the back of the toilet, and went...so missed the hole entirely (Jonathan was sweet enough to clean it up).

OK...so this is a minor setback, but OH MY GOD!!!!!  A CAT TOILET TRAINING HERSELF!!!  AND...if she does it, Mycella will want to copy her...

"event","Well, here it is...months after I should have actually made a post...

Nothing major going on...

Having a 2-bedroom apartment is FANTASTIC!!!  I LOVE this extra space!!  Jonathan built a huge desk for us for in the office and other than the boxes that he has kindly hidden in the office closet, we have been unpacked for quite some time.

Jonathan's going to be trying his hand at bartending.  He's been out of a job since June 30th.  He's going to school this week for the bartending and then they can place him somewhere.  it's nice to see him doing something that he can have fun with.  He still wants to get behind a desk, but at least he'll have fun while bringing in some money.

Heidi and I are done now I guess.  I've tried numerous times to get a hold of her since we moved.  I guess we had a fight regarding something with Jonathan and him getting a job...  I say that I guess we had a fight because it was that she called me at work freaking out saying that no one can get a hold of Jonathan about a job and he's not returning phone calls (she has passed on his resume to her coworker's husband who does computer consulting, so apparently, that now makes her his guardian).  I called her back and told her that there was no reason for her to freak out on my voicemail about it and that Jonathan has it under control (he HAD been in contact with the guy), and that it wasn't for us to get involved with.  That was the end.  She never called me back.  That was like a week or two before we moved...I'm not sure what is going on, so I didn't try to come on too heavy...  I called her once, text messaged once, e-mailed once, and Jonathan e-mailed once with a newsletter from our webpage.  So now, my already small list of friends is smaller. :-(

I'm learning how to sew...  My big project is going to be pillows for our futon.  I've taken about a week and a half off, so I need to get back into it.

Oh...and I've concluded something...  No matter how nice you are to people you work with and how well you can get along with them, they'll do anything to stab you in the back.  So now, people that I was trying to consider friends?  Just good acquaintances.

Man...my friend-life sucks.

Well...I'm going to go get myself lost in RuneScape for a while..."

"event","Hey there!  I know it's been ages...we've just really been keeping ourselves busy between school and work and the girls.

Meira and Mycella are adapting very well.  Mycella has decided that the world is her's to be conquered...nothing stands in her way.  Meira is curious, but let's Mycella get the water bottle squirts first.  They have both become very curious about their other sister-Jonathan's Russian Tortoise, Zipporah.  They visit her often...and either try to lay on her (when she's on her heating pad) or eat her food or drink her water.  :: Rolls eyes ::  But, we wouldn't trade them in for anything...they have been a GREAT addition to the family and I don't think they could have found any other parents that could love them more...especially since we got them front-declawed...  ;-)

School...well...it's been going.  It's not my favorite thing in the world, and I've had some misunderstandings with them that are driving me nuts, but oh well...I'll have my degree in 12/07, so I guess I have to just keep plucking along.

Work...don't get me started.  It's been slow, so that's been kind of nice to get me caught up.  However, then on Thursday night, I get sick...so Friday, I go in early to route the trucks for Saturday so they can be pulled on Friday, and then go home and sleep.  During the weekend, I'm still really dragging, but thinking I am having some improvement.  Then, Sunday night, I start losing my voice.  Monday, it's gone...  Not good when 75% of your job is on the phone...So I have to either whisper or sound like a dying cow trying to talk...however, I stay the whole day.  Tuesday, I can't even do a loud whisper, so I route the trucks and go to Urgent Care.  I have laryngitis (DUH) and tonsilitis...and he wasn't sure what else, but sent a throat culture out to be tested-but we know it's not the most common form of strep.  He gives me an antibiotic and a doctor's note to keep me out of work til Friday.  And if I don't feel better by tomorrow, I'm supposed to call him and find out the results of the tests and then possibly go in for a Cortizone pill (not shot thankfully!).  So, I go home, take my pills, take some Advil (that I'm also supposed to take), and nap.  I get up and do some stuff for work that I brought home and call it good.  Then, today, go in and route and leave and come home.  Keep in mind, I AM contageous right now...but if I leave Cody to do the routing, it won't be done til 11 or 12.  Then, I find out today that they are taking one of my vacation days for Friday!!!  I'm fucking salaried...don't you think sick days should be included with that?  Up until Dumb Fuck Cody came in, IT WAS.  Now, he wants to take my vacation days for this week too!!!!!!  Stupid ASSHOLE!  This means I now have like 3 vacation days left-to last me til June of NEXT year...since I am using 4 to move the beginning of August...

Yup...you read that right!!!  We're moving!!!  To a 2-bedroom in the complex here.  It was cheaper for us to stay within the complex.  Only costs $50 transfer fee and then the difference in security deposits for the two apartments ($130), so overall, it's cheaper this way.  Plus, we then get 200 extra square feet.  I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!  The only catch is that I usually move the end of August, but they had an apartment open as of 8/1...so now, I lost a month for moving...  And if you looked around here, you wouldn't be able to tell that we are moving in a month...I haven't packed jack shit.  It's just all happening so fast.

Married life is going pretty decently.  Granted, we have our ups and downs and frustrations as everyone does...  But he's a good man...and I count myself very lucky to have him.  I just hope he feels the same about me.  :-)

My birthday was May 28th...  It was really nice...had a BBQ at mom's new place on the 27th with my sister and her family...  Then, on the 28th, Jonathan gave me my real present (he had given me 1 each day of the weekend)...  PS2 NEOPETS THE DARKEST FAERIE.  VERY kewl!!  We played it from 7:30am-11pm!  I kind of feel like I lost a good birthday just staying inside, but it was fun!  He just beat the game this past Sunday.  We had one game that we were playing together (well...it was joint in the beginning...then he got involved to deal with all the evil things...  LOL), and then I'm going through it on my own as well...

Well...I've got a crapload of stuff to do, so I should probably get going at it...  :: sigh ::"

"event","Well, things have ben crazy this past week.  Other than the ""same ol', same ol',"" we got our kitties!!  <a href=""http://search.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=6038820"">Meira</a>(the picture doesn't do her justice!) and <a href=""http://search.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=6081034"">Mycella</a>.  They are just two of the most adorable little peanuts!!!  We were able to bring Meira home on Saturday, but since Mycella was sick for her original spay appointment, I had to go back down to IL and get her on Tuesday after work.  We had to wait until Wednesday to introduce them because Mycella needed her rest, and we needed to make sure her Feline Leukemia test came back negative.  So, on Wednesday night, we introduced them.  The last time that I introduced two cats, Cheddar thought Colby was lunch...so that obviously didn't go real well...so, I was scared.  Then, we introduce them and they are hissing and fighting and taunting (Well, actually, Meira was doing that...Mycella just really didn't care).  Jonathan had to keep me from stepping in there and separating the two.  But, it actually ended up really cute...if things got too intense, he'd pick up Meira and comfort her, but she'd be crying, and then Mycella goes looking for her and starts climbing over Jonathan til he lets Meira go.  At one point, he picked up Mycella and Meira just looked lost trying to find her.  They had about an hour time out and now they are like the best of friends!!  Meira has stepped up to the role of ""Big Sister.""  They do everything together!  Even in terms of the litterbox...Mycella doesn't really cover up her stuff, so after she goes, Meira goes in and covers it up for her.

On Thursday night, we let them come out into the living room (we had been keeping them in the bedroom-or bathroom for Mycella on Tuesday night).  OMG!  It's like we have 2 mini-horses running around!!  THUD THUD THUD THUD....THUD THUD THUD THUD!

Jonathan is all upset that Meira (who is ""his"" and Mycella is ""mine"") wants to be by me more than him lately.  Well, I mean...yeah...he cuddles with her, but he mostly rough-houses with her...whereas I cuddle and snuggle with her...

They are going on their first official road trip today when we take them out to mom's while we do laundry.  Mom's already met Meira, but hasn't met Mycella yet.  I hope they do good!!  That would be kinda fun to take them with us when we go there.

I miss Cheddar so much still.  As much as I love my two new kitties, I wish more than words could express that my baby was still here.  I miss him curled up on the bed next to me or on the chaise between my legs...  I miss him.  :-("

"event","OK...so...we decided we are getting another kitten.  Jonathan wanted a kitten and wants a female.  I talked him into letting us have two...that way, he can have his black one and I can have the gray one I've wanted for years (but wouldn't have traded in the years with Cheddar for anything).  So now, we are on a trek looking at shelters in WI and IL for the kittens.  Hoping to find both little girls at the same shelter.  I did some research (really bad...'cause I was researching instead of doing homework...which could be a direct cause of me nearly failing this class), and found some local places...so, I hit a few on Friday night before Jonathan came home from work...then we went to a place on Saturday morning where they had a black female and a gray male that needed some work with the socialization (think he was taken from him mom too soon).  Well, Jonathan really didn't want a male because of what happened with Cheddar, so we told them to call us if anything happened and we would call if we changed our mind...otherwise, we wanted them on Sunday.  I went to work and afterwards, Jonathan and I checked a few places again and ended up with nothing.  After that, we had dinner and then went to Petco and bought like $300 worth of new kitty stuff (I didn't want to be reusing the stuff from Cheddar...it would be too hard).  Then, Sunday morning, we went to Petco, and they had a little gray/white kitten I was looking at all week, along with her mother (that looked maybe a year and a half).  The mother was black and white.  Well, we decided ""No"" for them at that point and decided to go with the two from Saturday.  So, we left and I called and left a message on their voicemail system that we were going to come get them.  We got there and both kittens got adopted Saturday night.  I'm so pissed off that they didn't call us.  So, we went BACK across town to a place across from where Jonathan works...they are closed on Sundays.  So, then we settled on the mother/daughter from Petco so that we wouldn't separate them.  Low and Behold...we get there and someone is filling out an application for the daughter.  Stupid people...going to separate the two!!!!  So, this week, I'm working on calling people, working on homework, and trying to fully kitty-proof the apartment.  I can tell this is bothering Jonathan...he actually started to tear up on Saturday when we left from meeting the two kittens.  I have an application into a place about an hour south of here in Illinois, and am working on some local places as well.  We figure it is just Cheddar haunting us and making his presence known...like how dare we try to replace him so soon...and...WITH GIRLS!!!!!!!!!  KITTY COOTIES!!!!!!!!"

"event","In an attempt to not make myself cry more than I have today (I'm actually amazed I still have tears!).  He had a rough past few weeks.  The past few days, he was eating and drinking water, but it was basically just enough to survive hour-by-hour.  Then, last night, he could barely walk.  So, Jonathan tried forcing the food and water down his throat.  Went as far as dipping the straw in Cheddar's canned food, and blowing into the other end so that the food would shoot into Cheddar's mouth.  Long story short, I spent some time talking to Cheddar telling him how much we love him and how he will be able to be with Mozzie.  We had a vet appointment set up for 11:15 this morning, but I wasn't 100% confident that he would make it.

This morning, we woke up and he had moved a few feet but was collapsed by my computer armoire...but he was still breathing.

At 10:30, I went into the shower.  At 10:45, I came out, walked into the living room, asked Jonathan if Cheddar was still breathing (I couldn't tell if he was breathing shallowly), he said yes, I went in the bedroom and got dressed, told Jonathan to get Cheddar in the cage to get heading out, and the next thing I heard was ""Oh no...........Baby, I'm so sorry...""  And that was it.

We ended up burying him at my mom's new place, near the house, and under where her new deck is going to be going...so he'll be safe.

I want him back."

I'm trying so hard not to dwell on that he isn't here, but it's absolutely killing Jonathan right now.  If all goes well, we can bring him home in 36 hours.  If not, he may have to have the surgery a 2nd time.  This is at $300-$400 a pop.  Jonathan doesn't care.  However, he isn't the one with who is bringing home the bacon at this point in time and it is already too small of an amount.  But, we definitely need to see what we can do.  I miss Cheddar already.  And I'm supposed to work the rest of this week all day, as well as Saturday from 12-4 at my new part time job?!  And not think about all of this?  What a load of crap."

"event","Cheddar peed on my chaise on Thursday (resulting in Bath #2), and then hasn't done anything in his litterbox since.  Yesterday, I was up at 2am with him and he dribbled a little bit and there was blood in it.  This was at like 4am...I had to then wait until 8:30 until the vet place opened up.  I managed to get the last appointment they had available that day...at 12:20.  Great...more waiting.  I think I was dreading going to the vet more than he was after the last incident where he dug his K-9 teeth into my arm.  So, Jonathan did most of the handling.  We weren't able to get any clean urine sample out of him before the visit, but luckily, the vet was insanely nice there and he was able to squeeze a bit out (enough to test it).  Cheddar wasn't quite as thrilled.  Anyways...the fact that he was able to get anything out was a good sign...means no bladder stones (which would have to be surgically removed)...  So, he gave us some liquid medicine for a UTI.  We (well...Jonathan...) have to give it to him once a day.  Yesterday, Cheddar only spit out a little bit.  Today, he was a bit more difficult.  I'm hoping some of it got in him.  I hate seeing him in so much pain.  :-(  So...the saga is continuing...  :-(  My little baby's in pain, and I can't take it away from him!!!  :-( :-("

Hit a few rough moments just because, on top of getting married, we also moved in together the weekend before the wedding...  But, overall, it's been great.  I don't regret for a moment that we did it this way!!

Work hasn't been going the best.  There is a new job that they are looking at creating that I applied for.  If I don't get it, Jonathan said that, once he gets a job, I can start looking to leave.  I just really can't deal with Cody anymore.  He completely disrespects me.  I feel bad for leaving because of a person again...because I know there will be someone like that everywhere, but I just can't live like this.  The owners and him are breaking promises to me left and right.  Why should I stay with a company that, when they open their mouth, I can't believe a damn word that comes out of it?

I'm starting another major purge around here.  I'm sick of living in this clutter.  Life was so decent when I was following various basics of Feng Shui.  I think Jonathan, however, thinks I'm crazy.  I just hope he helps along with this and applying some of the rules so we can get ahead.  I really do believe in some of these things.

Well...just wanted to do a quick post to let everyone know I'm still alive!!

Wedding plans are coming along GREAT!!!  We saw the chapel yesterday and he's done a very good job.  I'm anxious to see it as we go!!!

Then, we went out to dinner to a place called Selen's...  OMG!!  The food was amazing!!  Service, fantastic!!  So, we booked the place for our luncheon after the wedding.  No extra cost for the room...just for the food and drinks!!!  AND, NO CAKE CUTTING FEE!!!

And, added bonus, we can invite my best friend, her husband, and my cousin to the ceremony!!  It wouldn't feel right without them there...  I'm so excited!!!  My best friend like shrieked on the phone when I called her saying that she was invited...  We had to hold back because of the available space at the ceremony...

"event","Well, Jonathan and I had a big talk on Friday night.  It was really nice.  Just him and I lying in bed talking about stuff.  We found out that we both were going through with the 2/1/06 wedding because we thought that was what the other wanted...but upon further talking, we realized that it IS what we want.  We talked through some of the things that I was scared about.  Sometimes I wonder if he's holding stuff back from me, but he swears he's not...so I guess the only thing I can do is believe him and move on.  I'm still scared a little bit, but I don't think it is anything out of the ordinary when you are getting married.  I don't deal with change the best.  But, I do love him with all my heart...

I have a Christmas surprise for him.  It may not mean much to him, but for me, it's a pretty big step...  I went through all my clothes and got some stuff ready to go to Good Will (well...what is left after my sister raided the stash tonight! LOL).  Took a huge plastic tote and filled it with other clothes...and now, he has a place to hang his clothes...complete with hangers!!  I even hung up the T-Shirts he had brought here in preparation of moving here.  I hope he appreciates it.  Like I said...it probably doesn't seem like a huge step, but for me, it is.  Although, I do spill over a little bit with my clothes on his side...but that is with the lingerie...which my theory is, it is as much for him as it is for me!!  O:-)  My sister told me that the lingerie needs to go in a drawer...however, I refuse to fold it.  Call me anal, but I refuse to have wrinkles in my lingerie.

GREAT NEWS!!!!!!  The officiant called me tonight and the chapel is almost ready!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I could just about cry because of this happening!!  Now, we don't have to deal with finding another place to get married...we don't have to find another officiant...  It's like a massive amount of stress lifted off of me.

Well...I'm going to get going.  Have to get the stuff off my bed so I can get some sleep.  I ended up waking up this morning at 6:45-and I'm supposed to be to work by 6.  So, the day kind of went downhill from there...although, I DID find a $20 bill in the gutter outside my mom's house!!!  :-D  OH!!  And my sister got the dress she is going to wear to the wedding!!"

"event","OK...Wedding update.

Let's see...I'm so stressed out that my period has gone COMPLETELY hay-wire.  Probably too much info, but it is on the forefront of my mind.  I was a week late last month, and I'm 2 weeks PAST the LATE week (translation: 3 weeks late)...every time I think it's coming, it's not.  And I'm not pregnant...I checked on Sunday...even though I was pretty confident, I needed the reassurance.

Anyways...off that gross topic...

I am getting flowers from someone in Canada.  I found some of her auctions on eBay and contacted her about making them.  We got everything figured out and now I'm just waiting on pictures of the bouquets.  I told her I needed them by 1/15/06.  These are the ones I started with liking...we are adding some lavender flowers and making a whole wedding floral set out of them.  <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5643558601&indexURL=7&photoDisplayType=2#ebayphotohosting"">Flowers</a>

We met with the officiant on Saturday.  I'm not 100% sold on him.  And the reason I wanted to go with him is because they are building a chapel.  Well...in e-mails with him, he sounded fairly confident that the chapel would be done before the end of December...now, however, at the time we were meeting, he sounds far less than confident that it will be done in time for the wedding.  I could just cry.  He made the deposit less than normal and made it refundable-in case the chapel isn't done in time.  Well...I AM FUCKED IF IT ISN'T DONE IN TIME!!!!

We still need to buy Jonathan's ring.  <a href=""http://www.christian-jeweler.com/pd_two_tone_cross_wedding_bandmens_smooth.cfm"">Ring he wants</a>

We still need to buy the unity candle.  We are going to get an oil one so that we can use it at the 2nd ceremony as well.  Plus, I'm just not the keenest on the regular candles.  And, we can get colored oils...so we can better match our wedding colors.  <a href=""http://glassdimensions.com/site/ind_unity_classic.html;jsessionid=ac112b6b1f43f4bf65d3d446430ba560fc42dfa06244.qQvJq2PEmlnva30L-BbQmkLz-ATzr6Lzn6rzqwTxpQOUc30KaNDNo6XKq6zInRmLa3mT8RbCpR0HoA5Qmh0KagTNo6XK-kDvrA4Ka34IqRnvp6iIpAjOp6jynQjM-AbJpgaMbNmKaNuLaxmxf2bCpQPz8QfznA5Pp7ftolbGmkTy"">Oil unity candle with the ""Wedding Symbol"" engravement</a>

I still need to buy undergarments (although, I did buy a strapless, backless bra that hopefully will stick...but I still need a slip).

I still need to buy shoes.

I still need to go shopping with my sister to get her a dress.

I still need to buy my sister a matron-of-honor present.

I still need to buy Jonathan a present.

We still need to buy our parents presents.

I took Jonathan out to dinner to a place that I'd like us to consider for after the ceremony.

I'm trying to get things that can be used for ceremony #2.

Have I mentioned that my stress level is through the roof?  In order to get everything I want included in this in case the 2nd ceremony doesn't happen (per my mom trying to prepare me for life's happenings), we'd have to have a larger wedding in a church with the reception afterwards...with all our friends and family...a photographer...a videographer...decorations..."

"event","OK...so...Wedding scoop...

I got my dress, veil, and jewelry yesterday!!!  We have a few small alterations on the dress, but nothing major.  Just a little shortening on the front and the sleeves and then we are making it into an empire waist dress with a lavendar ribbon.  Veil, gorgeous.  Jewelry, matches my tiara I have had since 1999!!!!!  I got the dress from a website of clothing for not-so-small-framed women, and the veil and jewelry from eBay.

Now, I need to find the undergarments for it (and I need to be selective as the dress is sort of see-through...nothing gross as long as I wear white stuff, but you can like see my bra straps.  I also need shoes.

My acne is already breaking out in a major way.  UGH!!!!  When I'm stressed, I break out.  Life sucks right now.

We are still trying to get Jonathan a job.  I'm getting frustrated...but I know he's got to be feeling it more so.

Flowers...well...I bought a bunch of stuff...and now, am going to return them.  The only problem is that now, I have to find replacements.  I'm trying to resort to eBay, but not having much luck.  But the flowers I got were going to be arm bouquets for my sister and I, but they were too big.

Jonathan wants his brothers to come, but not his mom.  And his brothers don't drive.  And they live 2 hours south of his dad...who is already 2 hours south of us.  And they are minors.  So, this knocks out the idea of having them stay in a hotel room by themselves...and they are not staying at my apartment by themselves...  So his solution?  After our wedding and meal afterwards, he wants us to drive 4 hours to take his brother(s) (not sure if both can come) back home.  Romantic, hey?  I want Jonathan to have everything he wants to make this day special...but am I in the wrong to want the sweet, romantic ending to our WEDDING?!  It's not like it's a vacation...IT'S OUR WEDDING.

And then, I have my mom reminding me that, for all intensive purposes, this could be the only wedding I get for a very long time...if ever.  If life gets in the way, we may not be able to have the vow renewal in 2 years.  I'm the queen of knowing about how life can take a 180 in a matter of moments.  So, she keeps telling me to make this one count and to get everything in this one that I want-just on a lesser scale.

I'm going to go vomit."

I'm trying to read Jonathan and see if this is really what he wants...I feel like he keeps going back and forth.  Everyone is happy for us that we are going to do this.  For me, there are certain things I want for the wedding...nothing big...a white dress (not as elaborate as for the big ceremony), a bouquet (again, not as elaborate...), and I'll probably wear my tiara and buy a veil.

I'm scared.

Is it wrong of me to ask him for a weekend without him before we get married?  Considering that is our only time together.  But...I want a weekend for myself

And...not to be disgusting here, but...my period will have just started when we get married.  At least with the 2008 date, I had time to be able to go on the pill to change my cycle.

People (well...my mom and Jonathan) keep saying that we should get married at like a courthouse, and then plan the big ceremony.

I'm fully aware of the benefits of it...financially.  And I know that that is a big benefit...especially considering my current financial status...which is very very very broke.

However, that's about the end of where I can get the benefits to end.  I really don't want to lose out on any of the fun stuff that goes with getting married.  I mean...is it normal to still have the showers even though you've been married for 2 years?!  I know we will still be able to use the items we would register for...

I know that Jonathan wants the regular wedding too...so why should we do the mini-one?!  And where do you draw the line for the middle one?  Just invite immediate family?  Do you wear a wedding dress or a white dress?  Veil?  Flowers?  Dinner?  And here I am...planning a regular wedding.

We are setting up a webpage that we will always be keeping...  www.jonathanandjanelle.com.  We still have to set it up, so it might be a bit.

"event","Hey everyone!!  I've been reading posts, but haven't written any...and when <lj user=""nutgoddess""> actually wrote something, I knew something odd was in the air and I should write in here!!  LOL

Things with Jonathan are going very well.  He's silly enough to want to keep staying with me...no matter what!

Things with his dad however..................That's another story.  His father treats him like shit.  There is absolutely no respect between the two of them.  And yes, Jonathan is at fault here as well, but I honestly feel that his dad is more so.  I kind of dumped on Jonathan this weekend about it.  And, at one point, I left downstairs to go back upstairs when his dad was doing it again.  Just went upstairs and cried...a lot.  I told him that after we get married, his father had better shape up in our home.  I will NOT tolerate disrespect.  Right now, I feel helpless being ""just the girlfriend.""

School...well...it's going.  It's slightly nuts.  I like this ""moving quickly"" thing, but this is making me go insane.  Oh well...I want the degree, I have to keep this up.

Petra...I'm dropping.  No time.  Anyone out there wear medium or large clothes that would like to buy some Petra stuff at a discount?  Let me know!!  I'd rather sell it pre-eBay so I don't have to deal with eBay.  Nice stuff...never worn...only used for shows - maybe 6 shows or so?

Work...Been rough.  And I am pretty sure that Andy will be leaving.  He got a big packet of stuff for a detailed background search.  I had to write him a reference letter.  It's just been tough.

And, here's the latest thing for work.  Now, I realize you shouldn't tell people how much you make, but right now, I don't care...and it helps explain the situation.  I got hired at $30K.  In 2 years, I went up to $33,250.  Then, major change #1.  We hired my help.  My hours became the normal 8-5, I got rid of the call stack and another tedious project, and my pay changed.  I was now making $32K (yes...I went down), but I had the potential to make another $8K in quarterly bonuses ($2K/quarter).  I averaged $1200/quarter.  This would make my income $36,800.  Keep in mind, after the firings last year and me getting all of that work back, I never got the money that had been taken from me, back.  Anyway...Cody has been in the middle of hiring new help.  Great.  Wonderful.  However, he is completely clueless.  He doesn't even know what jobs he is going to be giving these people.  I'm sorry, but...shouldn't you have a job description before you hire?  Just a thought.  So, I finally get my 2nd quarter review on like Wed or Thurs last week.  He, like Steve, doesn't have much time, so it's short and sweet.  He likes my work, I can change my hours to 7-4 because I am taking on a new task that has to be done earlier in the day, he wants to get rid of the bonus system since it really didn't pertain to me, and he would like me to come up with a new salary for myself...I can take a few days.  So, I go to my mom's, we talk, I do some research on some websites, and think I come up with a number.  Now, keep in mind, I don't know how my job is going to be changing.  I just know I'm supposed to be now Ben's assistant and Accounts Payable (both of which, I do, but how, it has a title).  So, for an Executive Assistant in the Milwaukee area, the median wage was around $44K.  The smaller end was at just above $39K.  So, with that in mind, and some math, I figured I would go for $38,500.  I send this e-mail off to Cody.  He calls me in his office today.  Says that he doesn't want to lose me, doesn't want to cause conflict between us, but that the number is higher than what he was thinking.  That if I wanted those wages, I would have to work more hours or take on more responsibility (SAY WHA?!?!?!  And, excuse me, but that asshole is the one that keeps saying that all work has to go through him now for me...so WHO'S fault is it that I don't have more responsibilities?  Oh yeah...THAT MOTHER FUCKER!).  He also said he was thinking $35K.  OK...so...let's recap here.  I currently make $36,800.  $35,000 IS still less than $36,800...right?!  Kind of like how $32,000 is less than $33,250.  Talk about a slap in the face...so offended...so hurt.  So I remind him that the responsibilities are supposed to come from him...and that I will get back to him about that price...oh...and...I also said ""What is so wrong with $37,000?  So I can at least not take a pay cut?""  ""I'll have to talk to Ben and Arvid.""  Oh...and let me mention that this whole thing was a 5 minute meeting...and I started to cry at the 4th minute (It was just a combination of the whole day sucking up until that point).  I go back to my office crying.  I end up talking to my mom for like a half hour on the phone.  About 2 hours later, he calls me back into his office saying that $37,000 is fine.  And, let me mention here, he's not happy with me.  I have a feeling that he loses money out of a bonus somewhere along the way.  Oh well.  Had he not come back with that, I would have sent my resume onto one of the like 3 or 4 jobs that tickled my fancy in the 15 minutes I went onto a job search website...knowing I probably wouldn't have gotten this salary, but still.  The fact he came up with something so much less than what I make was just painful.  Oh...but it came with a disclaimer that I will get rid of more of the more mundane things and take on more important things.  Let's try this...tell me something I HAVEN'T heard for the past damn 3 months.  But, now that it costs so much more to have me on board, I'm sure this will be pushed forward now.  O:-)

Other than that soap opera (sorry it was a little long), things are good.

Hope everyone is having a great night!!"

"event","I read an excerpt from a friend of a friend's journal on here...got my friend thinking and it got me thinking...about my dad.  I guess this is a slightly odd subject for me.  And if anything I say offends anyone, please understand that I don't mean to in ANY way, shape, or form...I promise...and please don't hate me either.

Having just gotten over the recent Father's Day holiday, I find it...odd.  Not necessarily hard...not necessarily easy.  Just...odd.  I did put a fleeting thought into my father...wondering what he's doing for the weekend...  Did my brother call him?  Is he up by David?  Or is he spending time with his girlfriend's family?  Or is he just at home?  The hurt little kid inside of me hoped that he was all alone at home with the blinds pulled in complete silence thinking about how his greediness and selfishness fucked up his family and his life.  The reality?  I doubt he even thought about my sister or I.

Don't get me wrong...I do have good memories of my dad...all be it few and far between...and the longer I go through life, the more I forget...but still...he could have been worse...much worse.  Although, I think it is safe to say that for every good memory I have, it is replaced instantly with two bad ones.  Words that people have said about how scared they were of him and his temper haunt me.  The physical abuse David and I went through (Laura was too scared of him to screw up.  David actually got the brunt of it.  Could have been the trouble he was always getting in...but that's still no excuse).

My brother says that the only way he can deal with my dad is by not having expectations of him.  This way, he is never disappointed.  But...how fair is that?  We are the children...we are expected to have expectations of our parents...and we have every damn right to have expectations.  And our children will have the same of us.  It's an endless cycle.  So why should we sacrifice ourselves and the cycle because a parent is a jackass?

Laura and I were willing to patch things up after the cancer diagnosis.  We found out that my father had made an offer to my grandfather to help financially if I needed it.  To my dad, I guess that is showing feelings?  Who knows.  Anyways, my grandfather never told us.  When we finally found out, apparently, it was too late.  Laura and I both saw the gesture as a touching one, and money or no money, we were willing to crack the door open a bit for him to come in.  He never did.  Hell...let's me honest here...the letter he wrote back to my mom?  He slammed the door in our face so hard it left a mark.  Oh well.

I know I will be sad when my father passes.  More so because then there will never be that ""what if"".  What if (hell freezes over and) we reconscile?

I've been told by many people in my church that I have to forgive him.  OK...I am FULLY able to forgive the man...BUT HE HAS TO ASK FOR IT!  You can't forgive those that don't ask.  Besides...those people only saw the public view of my family...they didn't see what happened behind closed doors.  Hell...they were over 500 miles away when my mom and I were in a living hell in Kansas.

People also think that my anger is stemming from the divorce.  Give me a break.  Next Tuesday will be 12 years since the divorce was final.  I'm so completely over what he did to my mom.  This is now between us.  This is about the hurt he caused ME.

He saw Laura and I like a week and a half before my surgery at my grandmother's funeral.  It had been like 6 years since we had seen each other.  Wanna know what he talked about?  THE DAMN LEAVES IN HIS YARD!  Dumbfuck.

The thing I'm scared about most is that I will handle things the way he did...with a temper.  I already do...and I hate it.

OK...enough of this...I'm crying at work.  Sorry for the rant.  Just ignore me."

"event","Hey everyone!!

I've realized I need to get more friends on here.  I have 3.  2 post, 1 doesn't.  I need more people's posts to read when I'm bored at work.  ROFL  Anyone wanna be my friend?  O:-)

An old friend of mine that I haven't talked to in a year and a half e-mailed me on powerpets yesterday!!  <lj user=""nindaene"">...You will remember her...  Amanda!!  Her and I drifted apart around the time of the cancer diagnosis.  Wasn't on bad terms...just schedule conflicts.  Lori has never tried to contact me.  She got upset because I wanted to try to fix things with Dan.  Oh well.  But, it was great to see how much Amanda's life has changed...and for the better.  A few rocky spots, but otherwise, really good.  She's now living in ILLINOIS!!!  Like 2 hours west of Jonathan...he even said we could go visit her one of these weekends!!  Hopefully, I'll have another rekindled friendship.  I've just been so lonely lately in the friends department...Trying to strengthen what I already have, but it doesn't help that we don't live near each other.  Closest friend I have is Heidi-whom I barely see...followed by my cousin, Julie...who is 1.5 hours away...and things only get further and further apart from there.

I'm so happy!!  Jonathan is coming up tonight after work!!!  Have I mentioned how much I miss him?  Just checkin'!

I'm pissed at my instructor for school.  I'm used to instructors saying if they want papers to be in APA style...he didn't say anything...so I didn't do it...and I lost points because of it.  Asshole.  Unfortunately, I didn't find out until I turned in ANOTHER paper that wasn't in APA style...so I'll lose points AGAIN.  Thank God for these short classes...only 2 more weeks of this hell.

I'm starting to get slightly worried about a doc appointment coming up.  I'm having my ob-gyn give me an STD test on the 12th when I see her for a post-cancer checkup.  I probably should have done it sooner, but I think you have to wait a certain time period until you can even detect anything.  I'm not worried about Jonathan because we're safe...but asshole John insisted on not using anything.  Dumbfuck.  Ladies...NEVER be with a man who refuses to use something...and Men...be smart...no cover, no lover.  It's just downright STUPID and I wish I could take back that month in my life.

OK...well...I should probably get back to work.  I just...don't wanna.  O:-)

Have a good one!!"

"event","OK...so the past few weeks have been CrAzY!  Jonathan left for a weeklong vacation last Saturday.  It translates into 3 weeks of not seeing him.  I'm going nuts.  I miss him so much.  We talk every night, but I'm going insane.  I want to see him so incredibly bad.  He actually is going to come up next Tuesday so we can spend the night together.  OK...as much as he can drive me nuts, I MISS HIM SO SO SO SO SO MUCH!  And I love him so much...

The new store is opening on Saturday.  We are having an Open House on Thursday.  It's 1.5-2 hours away one way.  I'm going with my mom.  It's going to be a waste of time, but 200% obligatory that I go.  I'm putting in MAJOR hours at work trying to get shit done for it.  I'm so tired I could just pass out.

My mom is moving...like a half hour away from me.  I should just accept it and move on...since everything I like, as well as work, is out here...  But I'm feeling deserted.  I'll be the only one out here.

I spent Sunday at my cousin's and had SO much fun!  We just did some bumming and hung out for the afternoon.  It was really nice.  Plus, I got my first hair cut since it came back in.  She ended up cutting like 2 inches in the back because it was getting longer than I wanted!!!!!  Pretty kewl, hey?!  LOL

School is going alright.  I guess.  Sorta.  Well...at least it's only 5 weeks per class...so that way, if I don't like it, there isn't much left to it.  LOL

Well...I'm going to go to sleep.  I desperately need sleep.  No sleep equals tired...tired equals cranky...cranky equals NOT GOOD...

Have a good one!!"

"event","Hey everyone!!  Just wanted to put up a quick update!

I started school at University of Phoenix last night.  Not too bad.  I'm going to have TONS of reading to do every day just with the message boards with it.  But, hey...hopefully it will be fun.  Looks as though all my credits transferred ok (well...all the ones from classes before Spring Semester...I need to submit another transcript request for those 2 classes because the grades weren't in yet when they got the transcript).  So, wish me luck!

Jonathan and I are still going good.  Coming up on our 3-month anniversary.  I honestly never thought I would find a boyfriend that treats me so good!  :-)

I turned a quarter-of-a-century-old on Saturday.  Jonathan and I both took off on Friday, so we had a 4-day weekend!  He came up on Thursday night and we went out for chinese...  Friday, lunch with my mom...  Saturday, lunch at my sister's for my birthday and then dinner out with my cousin...  Sunday, breakfast out, went to see MONSTER-IN-LAW (FUNNY!), and went fishing for a little bit.  It was raining, but I caught like 5 fish, so that was kewl!  Then on Monday, we went out with Heidi and Michael.  We were going to go mini-golfing, but it was gorgeous out, so the rest of the population in the Milwaukee-area was also there.  I kind of would have liked a day where we didn't do anything, but it sounds like I'll get it this coming weekend in Illinois, so I'll take that.  I got some pretty kewl presents, so that was kewl...

Work is a bit rough.  My boss quit.  Yesterday was his last day.  And Cody, in all his brilliance, will not replace the position.  He's going to take on some of the work himself for the time being.  Andy is now the Assistant Warehouse Manager to no one.  Does that make any sense?  Didn't think so.  But, they are going to bring back the two positions they eliminated last year...  One for the call stack and other stupid office stuff...  The other for dealing with customer service.  Those should actually do it all pretty good...  Oh...and guess who is my new actual supervisor?  YOU GUESSED IT!!  CODY!  Woo.  Hoo.  Although, he told me that he will work on trying to get me to only have officially one supervisor...rather than having to report to 500 people.  We'll see if that happens.  I just don't know if I want HIM for my supervisor.  I don't like this whole ""Changing Supervisors"" thing...I don't know how he is as a supervisor.  I know he isn't the best with his personal skills.  So, I guess...say a little prayer for me during this transition.

I was going to look into buying a condo, but there really isn't a whole lot out there on the market right now.  I could go through a relator, but not right now.  I'm thinking I am just going to hold out for another year...see where things are at with Jonathan and I as well as just in general.  This will give me time to save up a bit more money.  I'd like to not have to pay anything for a down payment, but I'm thinking I may have a better chance if I have a little something.  Plus, my mom got me a book called ""Buying Solo""...it's for women and explains the whole process of buying a house.  Looks pretty kewl.  I was able to read a little bit of it.  Jonathan wasn't the happiest with the title, but after 5 rounds about it, I think he's ok now.  I kept explaining that it is because women aren't usually confident enough to buy a house on their own...they think they should wait until they are married, etc.  And that, for me to buy a place, I am taking into consideration about him and I.  That is how come I am limited in where I'm considering going to.  I also kept telling him that if I buy a house before we get married, it will be good because then I will go into the marriage with equity built up.

Well...I should probably get heading out.  I need to take a shower and get into work...hopefully, sooner rather than later!

Miss you all!"

<TD align=middle><FONT size=5><B>Emo Kid</B></FONT><BR>You are 14% Rational, 28% Extroverted, 42% Brutal, and 28% Arrogant. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>You are the Emo Kid, best described as a quiet pussy! You tend to be an intuitive rather than a logical thinker, meaning you rely more on your feelings than your thoughts. Not only that, but you are introverted, gentle, and rather humble. You embody all the traits of the perfect emo kid. You are a push-over, emotional, gentle to the extent of absurdity, and so humble that it even makes Jesus puke. If you write poetry, you no doubt write angsty, syrupy lines about depression, sadness, and other such redundant states of emo-being. Your personality is defective because you are too gentle, rather underconfident in yourself, decidely lacking in any rational thought, and also a bit too inhibited. 
<P>I probably made you cry, didn't I? Fucking Emo Kid. 
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational. 
<P>2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted. 
<P>3. You are more GENTLE than brutal. 
<P>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.</I>

<P>* 
<P>* 
<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an extrovert to be classified that way as well.

I know...it's been a while since I posted...  Catch up time...

The visit with Jonathan's mom...well...it went.  If I go back anytime real soon, it will be too soon.  He and I had more fun driving back and forth.  It was just a really bad situation.  But, on the good side, we got it out of the way and now, it won't be hanging over our heads.

Jonathan and I...  Any doubt I ever had about this working out has completely been eliminated.  I love him so incredibly much.  I feel so wonderful when I am wih him.  I swear...I couldn't ask for a more wonderful guy.  I am having a harder and harder time leaving him.  Past 2 times, I've caught myself crying.  I absolutely love him so so so much.

GUESS WHAT?!?!  I am getting a BACHELOR'S DEGREE!!!  IN MY MAJOR (Retail Management)!!  I'm so excited!!!  I am going to go through University of Phoenix Online.  Every single class will be online...  I do GREAT at online courses and prefer them HUGELY compared to regular classes.  Anyways, you take 1 class at a time because they want you to be able to focus on each class...  The classes last 5-6 weeks each...  I start May 31st.  By starting then, they will pay for my application fee (like $100+) as well as for all my books for my first class!!!  PLUS, nearly all books are also found online!!  So I am not stuck with 10,000 textbooks!!  And, almost all (if not all) of my credits should be able to transfer.  I am SO excited about this.  I should have my Bachelor's within like 2 years.  Plus, no matter where I go (with Jonathan), I will always be able to attend the classes.

I went fishing yesterday with Jonathan!!!  It was the first time I have went fishing for years!!  Technically, I caught 2 fish!!  The first one, it was my pole, but I had to hand it off to Jonathan because the cops were coming and I don't have a license (but he has 1 to fish with 2 poles).  The next one, I caught and saw, but it got away...however, Jonathan said it was good that the bait stayed on the hook.  LOL

Well, all-in-all, that is my life...Great.  I haven't been happy like this and feeling this complete in ages.  Everything really does seem to be fitting together well, and anytime I thought that in the past, I was wrong.  I love my life right now."

"event","First off...  WOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  I finally heard from <lj user=""nindaene"">!!!!  I'm so excited!!  That like totally make my day!!  This day has totally sucked otherwise!!  Note...we must talk more often!!  It's been too long!!

School is getting to me.  I have a term paper that I am doing for my Supervision class on ""An analysis of women in management/supervision.""  Grrrrrrrrr...  I will probably end up getting like a ""C"" on the paper.  Oh well...I'm going into it with an ""A+"" in the class, so it won't kill me.  :-D  It's due on Monday.  Of course, I waited until a week and a half before it was due.  Actually, I had less time than that to work on it.  I started it last Thursday night I believe...  Worked on it on Thursday, then didn't work on it during the weekend because Jonathan was here, and have been up until midnight every night this week working on it because tomorrow, I head down to IL for the weekend again.

My Wednesday night class with John.  I swear to God...I'm going to kill him if I get the chance.  He's SO not pulling his weight.  And he's never up by the rest of the class...he always goes downstairs into another computer lab area.  Is he working on stuff for class?  I can assure you that he isn't.  So all I have to say to that is ""SPARE ME!""  We got into it again last night.  I think he thinks I'm still hung up on him (basing that theory on how he talks to me and the stuff he says).  For Pete's sake...we went together for a month, and we have been apart for 2 months of which I have been dating a great guy.  John was NOT a good catch.  Literally, NO ONE in that class likes him.  Me, being the devious self I can be, when we found a white out pen that he gave us to use (""But don't let ANYONE else see that or use it!"" :: rolls eyes :: ), ummmm...FIXED the pen.  O:-)  You know...it's one of those with the strips of white-out tape...that sucks to use because the white stuff keeps sticking to the tape and doesn't stick to the paper.  Anyways, I took the pen apart, unwound a bunch of the whiteout tape, and rewound it...twisting it as I went.  O:-)  But...I ENDED it the right away...that's got to count for SOMETHING...right?  ;-)  Oh well...two more classes with him...3 tops if people don't get done with everything on the 11th.

Work...  Well, they are going to eventually hire me help.  They put out an e-mail for people to let Cody know if they were interested.  I really need to get rid of this call stack.  I was crying in my office for like 20 minutes today because I hate asshole customers so much and people just treat me like the shit under their shoes.  I'm so stressed out...I have so much stuff that needs to get done...and it just keeps coming.  One day, I just have to catch up.  I have to take 2 Excedrin Migraines every morning just so I have energy to make it through the day and get stuff done.

Jonathan...  As much as he can drive me insane with stuff, he is a WONDERFUL boyfriend.  I really feel like he is someone who loves and adores me.  There's some things that could probably spare to be worked on, but I'm guessing that just comes from #1, that he's a guy...  #2, his entire family jokes around a lot...while I can take a good joke, but sometimes, it turns hurtful.  But he really is a great boyfriend.

Dyed my hair...brown-auburn.  First major thing I've done since it's come back!!!!

Well, I'm dead tired, so I'm going to get going."

"event","Hey there!!  OK...Update on things...

Trip down to Illinois went real well.  His dad likes me.  We went to the Brookfield Zoo which probably has the same amount of animals, but is REALLY spread out...so we were there for literally the entire day.  Met some of his family on Sunday at church.  Overall, not too bad.  Although, I didn't have the IPASS yet, so I had to stop and pay at all the damn tolls.  Go figure, I got it last week Monday...the day AFTER I got back!!  Oh well...I've got it all activated, so now, I just have to put it in my car and it's smooth sailing down there.

Overall, Jonathan and I are doing alright.  There are sometimes that I want to strangle him and question if it's going to work out, but then, I just have to keep telling myself that he IS who I have wanted to be with, and that he genuinely loves and adores me, and I'd be a fool to get rid of him.

Work is getting insane, but what else is new?

School is also nuts.  I have a term paper due on May 2nd, and I haven't even started.  I called into my class tonight.  Just couldn't deal with it.  I need this stuff to be over and done with.

Petra has been non-existant.  With everything else going on, it's taken a backseat.  I have to get back into it.  Anybody out there want to have a show?  Until the end of the month, you can get registered for a trip to Hawaii!!  Let me know!!  Would have no problem doing a catalog party!!

Well...off I go.  Tons to do still and no time to do it in!!

Hope everyone's doing well!!"

"event","Yes, ladies and gentlemen...  She's actually in love.  She's actually, 100%, head over heels, can't spend a moment away from him, imagines having kids with him, knows he'll never cheat on her, trusts him with her whole life, in love with him.  And, frankly, she doesn't really know what to do with these feelings.  She hasn't felt like this for anyone else...including her exfiance.

My mom and Heidi both would tell me that my opinions of kids would change when I met the one I was meant to be with.  That my insane fear of having children would disappear.  I didn't believe them.  I do now.  I want to have children with him.  I think we could raise amazing children.  The thought of him as a father just makes me feel great.  I've been so afraid that I would end up with someone like my father as a spouse...but I really think that this is someone I would feel safe leaving our children with (whereas my bro, sis, and I hated when my mom would leave because my dad would turn into a monster to us).  I have never felt like this in the past...not even with Tim (exfiance).  Now, for Pete's Sake...I'm crying out of JOY of being with kids...rather than fear.

When everything was going down with Dan 1+ years ago, <lj user=""nindane""> told me some words that have stuck with me ever since.  That, when you are with the one you are meant to be with, you will never believe they will cheat on you.  That won't even be a fleeting thought.  Even if they do and it breaks your heart, you will never believe they would do it again.  I know, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Jonathan will NEVER cheat on me.  I can't even TALK myself into believing that he would...because I know he wouldn't.  He's the only guy I have ever been with that I have truly, honestly, from my gut, believed would never cheat on me.

His one cousin, Patrick, managed to get online when Jonathan wasn't looking the other day.  Patrick is 12 (and Karen, his sister, I believe is 7...).  Anyways...before Jonathan caught him, Patrick IMed me and was like ""You must be a really nice person.  Jon has never talked about any of his other girlfriends, but he's told us about you.""  I thought that was so sweet!!  Jonathan has talked about taking them fishing and that he wants to get Karen a pink fishing pole because she's really getting into Barbie.  I told him he can take Patrick fishing...I'll play Barbies with Karen on shore!!  ROFL  (ADMIT IT!!!  Every female would love to play Barbies, and when there is a little girl there, you have a logical excuse!  LOL)

This is freakin' insane.  I'm crying because I have no other idea of how to get this out.  I'm seriously in love with him.  I'm frustrated because I don't know how to get it out.  Jonathan is someone who I can't think of wanting to change anything with (well...other than his commentaries of who got boob jobs on SEX IN THE CITY! ROFL)...  He's someone that I know will be a good husband, father, supporter, lover, worker...

He has no problems with my thoughts on leaving the full time work force when we have kids, yet still do something to bring in some sort of money.  We are deciding where we would live.  We have talked about how we would do holidays (although, I HATE this conversation...with anyone...'cause I just want to spend holidays with my family and continue our traditions...I'll adjust, but I have a hard time swaying from old habits).

This is nuts.  I want him here so incredibly bad.  I'm going through withdrawal right now because I can't see him until Tuesday night...possibly Monday night since I don't have school next week."

"event","Hey everyone!!

I know it has been a while since I wrote.  All I have to say is that things are going great.  Jonathan is fantastic.  He spoils me rotten!!  He's so sweet...so fun...just...fantastic.  How I am normally the one that is going super fast, this time, he is...only, it's at the same pace that I am.  We've talked about him moving closer up here and buying a house so we can be closer...  We talk about being married and having kids (which, remarkably, for the first time in my life, I could picture having a family with someone...and LIKING it!!)...  He will drive up here twice a week...Tuesdays after work and then Fridays after work.

Well...I'll probably write more tomorrow or something, but right now, I am so incredibly tired I could just scream!!  Just wanted to put up a quick post that my life right now is going wonderfully!!

Nighty night!!!"

He was lifted on and off and, lo, he begat a son, Seth, who went on to begat many sons and daughters and won the Queen's Award for Industry.<br /><br />24. Seth lived one hundred and five years and, after testosterone tablets, begat Enos.<br /><br />25. And it came to pass, men began to multiply on the face of the earth - and lo, there were many queues for hip operations and standing only on the tube.<br /><br />26. And the sons of God saw the daughters of men and they were fair; and they took them all wives all of which they chose, but woe, the sleeping arrangements were dodgy.<br /><br />27. There were giants on the earth in those days; they were all in the British Rugby Team.<br /><br />28. The Lord looked upon the earth, and lo, it was corrupted with <em>Nightmare on Elm Street III.<br /></em><br />29.He sayeth unto Noah, ""Build an Ark and two of every animal upon the earth thou shalt take in it."" So Noah let the animals in, and lo, Noah and his family were soon up to their necks in it. And Noah's wife said, ""For God's sake - somebody open a window.""<br /><br />30. And the Lord made it rain forty days and nights and the world was flooded, all except England where they had drought and a hosepipe ban.<br /><br />31. And the rain and the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days and woe, cricket was cancelled at the&nbsp;Oval.<br /><br />32. And it came the waters abated, and Noah sent forth a raven - yea,&nbsp;he went forth and stayed forth.&nbsp;<br /><br />33. Noah then sent forth a dove, and lo, it returned with an olive leaf plucked off. Noah himself was pretty plucked off.<br /><br />34. Noah waiteth seven days and he sendeth off the dove yet again - but this time it returned not, having been shot on the Glorious Twelfth.<br /><br />35. And when the land had dried, Noah lifted the cover off the Ark and let it all out.<br /><br /><br /></font></p>"

<P><FONT size=2>5. But both Adam and Eve's eyes were opened and they saw they were naked and they sewed on fig leaves - one for Eve and a hundred and eighty for Adam.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=1>1. On the seventh day God ended His work, but Datsun of Coventry workers went on to time and a half, and God rested from all His work with complete backing from Arthur Scargill&nbsp;and the miners.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>2. God blessed the seventh day, as did all the Pakistani corner shops.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>3. Every plant, every herb was in earth for the Good Lord had not caused it to rain; because of this Bob Geldof had to raise fifty million quid with LiveAid.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>4. And the Lord formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; it was done privately and not on the National Health.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>5. The Lord planted a garden in Eden and there He put the man He had formed, and He sold the idea to the BBC as&nbsp; <EM>Gardener's World.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><EM>6. </EM>And out of the ground the Lord grew every tree that was pleasant to the sight, but He had not reckoned on the weather forecast from Michael Fish, and they were all blown down in the hurricane.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>7. And the Lord took man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it, subject to compulsary purchase by Brent Council.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>8. The Lord God said, of every tree in the garden thou mayest freely eat, but He was apprehended at the checkout and forced to pay.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>9. But of the tree of knowlege, thou shalt not eatest, or thou shal surely die, due to crop-spraying with DDT.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>10. And the Lord said, it is not good that man should be alone. He caused a great sleep to fall upon Adam, which the shop steward penalised him for during working hours, deducting a day's pay. The Lord took one of Adam's ribs, and made a woman, and brought her unto the man, which immediately qualified for common law wife allowance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>11. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. However, at Bow Street they were charged with indecency.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>Chapter 1</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><U>THE CREATION ACCORDING TO THE TRADE UNIONS</U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>1. In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>2. And darkness was upon the face of the deep, and this was due to a malfunction at Lots Road Power Station.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>3. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light, but Eastern Electricity Board said He would have </FONT><FONT size=1>to wait until Thursday to be connected.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>4. And God saw the light and it was good; He saw the quarterly bill and that was not good.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>5. And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night, and so passed his GCSE.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>6. And God said, Let there be a firmament and God called the firmament heaven, Freephone 999.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>7. And God said, Let the waters be gathered together in one place, and let the dry land appear; and in London it went on the market at six hundred pounds a square foot.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>8. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, and the earth brought forth grass and the Rastafarians smoked it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>9. And God said, Let there be lights in heaven to give light to the earth, and it was so, except over England where there was heavy cloud and snow on high ground.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>10. And God said, Let the seas bring forth that which hath life, flooding the market with fishfingers, fishburgers and grade-three salmon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>11. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, multiply and fill the sea, and let fowl multiply on earth where Prince Charles and Prince Philip would shoot them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>12. And God said, Let the earth bring forth cattle and creeping things, and lo, there came cows, and the BBC Board of Governers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>13. And God said, Let us make man in our own image, but woe many came out like <EM>Spitting Image.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>14. And He said, Let man have dominion over fish, fowl, cattle and every creepy thing that creepeth upon the earth.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>15. And God said, Behold, I have given you the first of free yielding seed; to you this shall be meat, but to the EC it shall be a Beef Mountain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#993300>Anyway, today we brought the ponies up to the yard again, and then we had breakfast and I did some baking. I made a christmas pudding, some coconut macaroons, and a lemon drizzle cake. I'm still waiting for that to finish baking. Then, after a drink, we made some doughnuts, but something must have gone wrong with the mix, because the sugar wouldn't stick. But they taste ok, so something went right!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993300>Later when we took the ponies back to the field, we gave them their hay &amp; water, but then found the damn lock wouldn't click shut! So we had to go and borrow a hammer from Maggie to hammer it shut. I WISH Dad would change the padlock on the gate. It's becoming so stiff to close. </FONT></P>"

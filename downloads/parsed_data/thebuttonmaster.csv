Working on, working on that for quite some time? Huh? (voice getting higher pitched) Yea, talking about that 3 years ago. Been working on that the whole time? Nice little narrative?

 naked there....gah that was horrible.......um wht else oh the flight was ridiculous....i was on my way
 back and the captain started talking   ""this is ur captain speaking...ummm.....it looks like well be
 heading into a tropical storm...sooo were just gonna ride it through and i ask that u put ur seatbelts
 on thankyou..."" yea so i thought it was routine but it wasnt ""ha yea its ur captain again it  looks 
like we hit a lil bit of turbulence our meters show that we did drop about 150 ft but we have cleared
 the storm and it easy sailing formt there...."" i though it was gonna die that was scary.....yea so the
 next day i had to get back on an airplane and fly to nevada to meet my mom and my sister that was cool
 but i had to sit next to this smelly european girl....it was awful unfortunatley i think i got used to
 the smell......yea anyways vegas was gun it was freakin cool everygirl (who looked decent enough) wore
 short shorts or hot pants....that was gret and ha i also got into two lcubs i like having an older sister
.......oh and the hotpants thing thats ok when the people are young...but u can point out the older women 
who used to be show girls cause they still dress like theyre young that was fucking gross.....so many 
wrinkles......ummm.....after vegas i flew back home and a week later i left for cali that was fun...i 
spent my birthday there and i did my thing there.....um i didnt do anything out of the normal....oh did i

"event","Wow...so much has been going on lately, it's all kind of a blur.  But the tours going great! Our fans are just fucking incredible.  Just incredible.  It still blows my mind how dedicated they are.  They do sometimes get a little crazy, okay well a lot crazy but that's why we love them.  

I really do love what I do.  I wouldn't give it up for the world. 

Well now that I'm being yelled at from down the hall to ""Get my lazy ass up and come get ready!"" I gotta go. (If Brian says ""gotta go"" the same way from the song when we ARENT performing the song, I swear I'll bitch smack him lol)"

"event","Blah blah blah blah...That's about all I'm hearing in the last few days.  

I'm sorry. Stupid decision but it's not like it's the worst one I could have made. Right? No one got hurt, including myself.  Honestly, I don't think I could pass a sobriety test sober. 

Sometimes I just want to curl up into a ball and be left alone.  Ever since I was 12 I've had almost no private life.  I didn't know that being a part of a group meant giving up so much.  But I'm not going to complain.  I've got so much, it would be wrong.  

""He begged her to take him back but she wanted to play the field."" -The Enquirer, Haha! Right...fuck her. Playing the field doesn't even begin to describe her...

Fucking a, I wish the tabloids would just go away.  They're just a bunch of shit people pull out of their ass and call  ""entertantment news."" Call me an ass if you want but I think that

I have this song in my head and it won't go away...
<lj-cut text=""But if I built you a city/Would you let me?/Would you tear it down?""> Ruthless

This is the only lonely picture 
Waiting on my floor, littering my shore 
This is the last true burning letter 
Given to a girl, written by a boy 
Living in a world created to destroy 

But if I built you a city 
Would you let me? 
Would you tear it down? 

But there you go for the last time 
I finally know now what I should have known then 
And I could still be ruthless if you'll let me 
But there you go and I'm not done 
You're waving goodbye, well at least you're having fun 
The rising tide will not let you forget me 

This is your ghost that kneels before me 
Razors on her tongue, a body full of oxygen 
It won't be the last time she'll ignore me 
The thinning of my skin, without the strength to go 
The Winter's setting in, to cover you in snow 

But if I built you a city 
Would you let me? 
Would you tear it down? 

But there you go for the last time 
I finally know now what I should have known then 
And I could still be ruthless if you'll let me 
But there you go and I'm not done 
You're waving goodbye, well at least you're having fun 
The rising tide will not let you forget me 
Forget me, forget me 
Forget me, forget me, yeah 

I'll raise towers and climb them 
Rivers and walk them 
Oceans to drown in 
You won't make a sound in... 

But there you go for the last time 
I finally know now what I should have known then 
And I could still be ruthless if you'll let me 
But there you go and I'm not done 
You're waving goodbye, well at least you're having fun 
The rising tide will not let you forget me 

Forget me</lj-cut>

Not much else to say.  Tour starts soon. 21st if I'm not mistaken. Oh wow...really soon.  Man it hasn't even started and already I'm wanting it to be over.  

This whole thing was kind of random. Sorry. I guess you could say I haven't been thinking well lately."

"event","Wow. Long past few days. I'm sure they'll be many more to come but its all good. It's worth it in the end, always is.

And damn label people really need to get the sticks out of their asses. Really. I don't know why they do this everytime but ya know, this will probably be the last album with them, so whatever. They can go screw themselves.

Anyways, Bobbie really hooked me up here. I like how it looks and I love that song.  She knows me too well. Gotta call her. We need to go out and party again soon.  Speaking of party...ok no, I won't go there now.

Clicked on the friends thingy and it said ""ac_red_carpet"" and have no idea what it is. People acting like other people? Mmm...ok. Whatever floats your boat I guess.

I may try and find a few fans to freak out. haha.  I love them but some are just like woah. I'm just a person ya know, nothing special.  Even if they don't belive me, most usually still talk.

Sorry this is all random shit but like I said before, I'm not really into journaling so to say. I just write.

So I should probably go get ready, another ""big"" day. Whoopdiefuckingdo.  I just want to get this record out, for the fans sake and mine."

Well no time now.  I'm not much of a journaler so we'll see how this goes.

peace out."

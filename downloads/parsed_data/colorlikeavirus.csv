With my income tax I decided to spend a chunk of it on a blender/and superfoods.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those that may not know what Superfoods are, Superfoods are vibrant, nutritionally dense foods that have recently become widely available and which offer tremendous dietary and healing potential.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some superfood products are...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goji berries<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hempseed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cacao beans (raw chocolate)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maca<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spirulina<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bee products<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Golden Inca Berries<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cordyceps (mushroom)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blue green algae, Revitaphi<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marine Phytoplankton<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold Rush<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a host of others.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; https://www.noblelifeelements.com/wormeesherbs<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That link is to our website where we sell/distribute our superfoods!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been an amazing opportunity so far, and I only see it getting better!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you'd like to learn more please check out the link!"

"event","So we were in nola a total of 4 days... worst fuckin four days of my life.  The day we got there we had taken a bus because we got stopped by a cop in nasheville. luckily jeskas mom was able to order us the ticket.  So we got to nola at like 5 in the morning.. and we see this guy sitting out front of the station that looks like a traveling/squatter kid.  A few minutes after sitting down he comes over and asks to say hi to karma. I say yep and he plays with karma for like an hour.. then he offers me a mickeys 24oz and we show off our tattoos.  After sitting with him for like 3 hours we walk to the libary.. and we sleep out front of there until it opens... oh!! the best part.. on our walk to the libary it starts to poooour down rain.  lucky us we maded it to nola just intime for a catagory 2 tropical storm.  so from the libary we walked to a puppy park that we remembered had shelter from rain.  plus karma was aloud to run around off the leash there.  the next day we go to the drop in, get bins for our excess shit so we're not walking around like turtles with huge packs/shells on our backs.  that helped... blah.. i dont even rember what else we did that day.. no one was in town... the weather was 90+ degrees and raining.... it blew... we slept like 10 hours over the span of 4 days.  we slept in parks and parking lots. we're in baton rouge now we are trying to get out of here tomorrow... sleeping in a park tonight.. its fuckin 95 degrees out."

It gotta feel good not having to worry about shit... like where your going to sleep in the coming month... if your going to even be alive then.  its got to feel real fuckin cozy borrowing hundreds from your momma to just go out to eat... or buy an ounce of pot.  never to have to worry about anything.  there's a difference between venting and talking about stepping out on a year commitment and actually doing it.  It's safe to say you ruined what little good i had going for me.  What will i do now... i guess you could give a fuck about that.  5 years destroyed.  i wouldnt piss on you if you were on fire.
Everything we've ever done together is nothing.  You are the lowliest piece of shit ive ever met.... and ive met a looot of pieces of shit.   Fuck you. die."

Hi, all you animal lovers. This seems pretty simple. The Animal Rescue Site is having trouble getting enough people to click on it daily to meet their quota of getting free food donated every day to abused and neglected animals.

It takes less than a minute to go to their site and click on ""feed an animal in need"" for free. This doesn't cost you a thing. Their corporate sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to donate food to abandoned/neglected animals in exchange for advertising.

Here's the web site! Pass it along to people you know.

http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com

AGAIN, PLEASE pass this on to other pet owners!
Thank you and good blessings to you and the
four legged ones in your life!"

Have you ever had a friend that you thought you knew inside and out... that when you were with that person, you could talk openly and freely... you could share your saddest along with the happiest memories with one another... and the other person just understood... and you KNEW they understood... i had a friend like that... a friend that when she said ""i love you timmy"" i believed it...and when i said it back i meant it... i really, with all my heart meant it... I grew slowly apart from this friend... we went from hanging out almost everyday after school... sitting on the trampaline just looking into each others eyes... talking about what sorrows filled our hearts... we would be so deep in our conversation that we paid absolutely no attention to our surroundings... it was raining on us and we didn't even notice until after hours of talking our eyes left one anothers... now i barely talking once a week on the phone with her.. and when we do talk it's about stupid stuff... is this how all good friendships end?

"event","just random thoughts i had while reflecting on Romanticism Philosophy... 




It was once said that the duty of a Romantic was to; experience life or dream himself away from it.


I myself do not think this applies to only the Romantics. It applies to everyone. 


Those who experience life are those who suffer tremendously. For they are the ones who not only see and hear their surrounding... they feel them. Their soul is tortured with these feelings that turn to thoughts, that reflect on feelings. 


In the other column there are those who dream themselves away from life. I personally think that the majority of the people in the world are dreamers. Furthermore I think that if you can say you are honestly happy... then you are a dreamer. Their is nothing wrong with these people.. in a way i envy them. Their minds aren't plagued with truths."

"event","michael is transitioning from two jobs (teaching and counseling) that he has worked at for 2.5 years:

you build your world one day at a time.  sometimes, you stand awash in misery, confusion, and apathy.  Isn't the present so utterly charming?  sometimes, it just doesn't make any fucking sense at all.  An alarm clock sounds the conscious stream of sensation and you build on, because there is only one way to go, right?  Even with that being known and obvious, sometimes you root yourself into a fogged landscape of better days that glimmer and shine into the distant horizon.  You dig your feet deep in lost love and missed chances that blur at the edges but are so real and unquestionable at their core.  You contort your body with aching joints to see over your shoulder of what once was, but it remains just at the periphery.  Sometimes, you cast a net blindly forward and hope to tangle that fleeting mass of fulfillment and joy, a joy that could only be felt if you had the right net to catch it.  You never seem to.  Nets and roots, and the fucking present.  

for some reason, disorder or dysfunction, or utter coincidence.  for some flaw in character or protective pattern, i love the way i fit with people.  and in the recent memory, i am realizing that i deserve it.  i build it.  it is deliberate.  it is cared for with great big concepts of self, mighty monoliths of value, undefined and fluid, but bound by my being. i get to see people everyday who are so brave and wise, who are taking life one day at a time and making sense of it, giving worth and value to it.  i get to witness their greatest moments of self-care and revelation, of cracking cemented structures of concept and belief.  i get to see the world shape around them and their changing forms. i get to see the world flourish despite all of its natural restrictions.  and i get to see it because i stand here to receive it.  it is deliberate.  

and they will find all that life is and I can no longer ride along.  I can no longer hold that moment with them.  and i will miss them.  and i'm so grateful"

before we talk about doodie, id like to announce to me, myself, and i that i have completed the seven book series by stephen king, called the dark tower series.  it was quite a voyage and i recommend it... at least to number 4...  okay, try reading number 1, the gunslinger, and then tell me what you think.  after that, it has its ups and downs, some of it is not so good.    

an excerpt from an email to a dear friend under the profound realm of trust and confidence. 


i just got my poop stool checked... meaning i had to go into the hospital bathroom, squat over the floor, and let out the curly ol tootsie roll of a smelly poop drop into an upturned cup... then after pinching it off at the right amount, like an artic circle icecream dispenser, i had to put the top on, put it in a paper bag, put it in a plastic bag, tie the top... and all set.  but damn, taking that thing out and presenting it to the lady in labcoat behind the desk... number 84, room stacked shoulder to shoulder full, i swear something had crawled up my ass and died there... that smell made my eyes water.  the only moment i felt embarrassed of carrying around my own shit... having to release the odor in the company of 50 people.  i made a joke at getting my poop test results... 5 doctors have scrutinized and have argued and have finally agreed... my poop stinks... it stinks mighty fine.  i swear ive been having happy stools, those ones that last for a while, solid, dense, no breakage, just a fine ol slippery log, sliding like butter, like a train on tracks of grease, tires on oil, just plopping on down like a diver on his silver medal moment.  yep... but not today my friend.  i cant tell you in 250 words, even though i may be approaching that number, how tricky my feces were today... they were slick little bastards embarrassing me like that."

"event","i dont know what woke me up, but once glued eyes pealed open, hazed vision focused about in the night(im so dependrnt on corrective eyewear that without them i would probably lose my entire gene pool in a matter of days).  when i turned over i saw the landscape of a naked back with fingers drawn over and scratching one of those itches that can always use help from a second party.  so i pushed the hand away and began to do some curls and circles with my nails, pressing against the skin. if i remember correctly, even after i had thoroughly completed my task i set my hand on the waste, palm spread out just below the hip bone.  this is when two thoughts came to mind... i dont recall in which order.  

1.  the curvature of nicoles waste has flattened out noticeably.

2.  its so nice that nicole could be here with kenny and i.... whether it wished and washed its way into my thoughts first is of no matter, because this is the one that lingered, flashed, brought by breath to stop and my eyes to widen in the darkness.  and with the spark of realization, nicole was no where to be found.  i had been caressing the back and waste of my 17 year old garifuna brother, kenny.  we had been sharing the bed the for the past few nights during our travels.  i laughed outloud, woke him up, explained myself clearly through my snorting. he had no idea, and come to think of it, seemed completely content to have a good back scratch, not a sound, not a bit of resistance.    

my eyes play tricks on me.  always have.  its just gets complicated when innocent bystanders get involved.

im really enjoying a book by john steinbeck called travels with charley.  a light read that is easy to carry around.  i think it has been a favorite... the actual book has character too... released in the early 60s, cover torn off, pages yellowed with softened corners.  anyway, if you can get ahold of it, take a look-e-see."

"event","sometimes i can just watch the grains of sand falling, and if i stick my hand out to block the downpoor, it only makes me realize how little control i have over it all.  like a rock resting on a shoreline, it is overwhelmed, left hopeless, and washed away. 

how is everyone?  i have had a headcold for the last week and when i think im better, the next morning blesses with me with a huge wad of snot lodged in my throat, oozing from my nostrils, missing the kleenex, and stringing joyously from the fingertips like green vines draped in a rainforest.  i dont mean to be gross, im keeping my digits thoroughly cleansed, but lordy, where the hell is it all coming from.  

ive been going to a catholic church in town.  and even though i filter through the structured messages and slow numbing of the minds through brainwashing, i find it rewarding.  i have been reading lectures from the bible in front of the people, standing at certain times, sitting at the right times, sometimes even saying an amen.  but, what really floats my boat, is the singing.  it is the only access to live music that i have.  they sing in spanish and in garifuna and when we stand, hand in hand, and sway like trees in the wind, i feel a certain peace.  and i think of it is as a time to dedicate to thinking of other people, those that vanish when the touchable life takes priority.  i guess its a form of prayer, concentrating my thoughts on one individual and hoping for the best.  becomes clear to me how dear and important they are to me. 

im not going to get carried away in love talk.  its nice though.  how easy that is written.  its nice to smile before a door is opened, to think of someone between pages of a book, to have an arm draped over my chest and have it become a part of it.  i cant say how i feel about being in a framed human form.  sometimes, i can touchdown with fingertips and let the nerve endings search out curves, bumps, moles, scars.  i can feel the pupil enlarging with incoming light, the lenses focusing, the lids refusing to shut.  and in the movements, skin follicles rise and fall, hair is brushed aside and the molecules fly, and i can do nothing but breathe it in.  but, then... its all contained in five fingers, four flailing limbs, surrounded by layers of skin, glued together by bone and ligament... and i just want to step out of my shell and know her.  i guess we figure a human spirit to exist when we think of love, how the body connects us to all that physical world, that sensational input... but to believe there is something living behind or beyond the pulsing of blood, the division of cells, the conversion of energy, the firing of neurotransmitters,  something that only love can bring to life.  now... that is where human being can be a lost or an enlightened soul.  either way, its beautiful."

happy new year to everyone!  michael is going about his business in usual fashion.  staying plenty busy and still finding time to strum and doodle and daydream.

christmas project:  the brains of the operation: nicole.  donations:  provided by the good folk of jutiapa, north coast, honduras.  free help:  michael, pc volunteer, and representative of spudville, idaho.  we finally got through with the project of december a few days ago.  to paint the final picture, we loaded clothing for every variation of human shape and form, age, width, height, bags of assorted food, soap and toothbrushes, and little gadgets and toys for the younglings.  we drove in the back of a flatbed truck, standing, over the potholed streets to a village outside of nueva armenia (my site for those who havent got a clue)  we unloaded the goods into the one room, one lightbulb, mud sealed school and had each mother of the community came through with a sack and filled in 5 articles of clothing for each family member.  about 20 mothers left weighed down by new clothing.  by the end of the event, there was time to exchange smiles, kids were running about in the night, and nicole pulled it off... im not going to bore you with all that was involved to get to this point, but we pulled it off.

i have more to say... i do.  i hope everyone reading this and everyone linked personally to those reading this are fine and dandy.  there are some volunteers who document their stories to a fine tee, and i leave random bullshits here and there... kind of vague of what the hell is going on, but i think im giving the general jist of it all."

that was what made traveling appeal to him- he always made new friends, and he didnt need to spend all his time with them.  when someone sees the same people everyday, they wind up becoming a part of that persons life.  and then they want the person to change.  if someone isnt what others want them to be, the others become angry. everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, and none about his or her own.

when david left the house again, he could step straight down from my door and dip his toes 5 inches below its frame into water.  in fact, my house and all those in the town were completely immersed in it.  the rain came in the night, and it hit hard upon the tin, crashing down, and when those drops stuck together in streaks, and began to bead up in pools, the current caught ahold and carried it toward the sea, through the trees and directly along either side of my home... or its what i could account for from my front window.  so much water passed by.  i took up the habit of stepping out, unzipping, and releasing the full bladder in a fine stream toward its wake.

say adios to the garden idea.  i had to wade out in knee deep waters, bending over into its muddy face to search with my hands for the tipped over flower pots.  i saved 4... beat and bent and looking up at me saying... what the hell took you so long?  on the third day the sun peeked through and i opened the door wide open to invite it in, setting the plants in a tight group, huddled together and spreading out in its warmth like lizards on granite.  i got some sun on my pallid shoulders and waved at the boats from my book... ass sat on my floor, feet out in the cool wetness.  the neighbors came close enough for me to notice them looking at my nipples.  ha... i havent exposed them much in site.  i realized how sensitive i am to eyecontact and the weather... how every change of tide or temperature, moon out and about, or a settled dull grayness can manipulate my mood on an hourly basis.  tease the mind, fuck with the vision."

speaking of erotic, heading toward the workplace around the neighborhood in a horse shoe shaped bend, a woman called out to me in garifuna.  im learning the language at a slow pace... things like good morning, how are you, im okay, im hungry, im going to bed, delicious, what is your name... stuff like that ive got under my belt.  but i have not heard this short saying that she was shouting... wue te.  i thought she was saying wait... practicing some english with me, so i smiled and said... ae... garifuna for yes.  she approached laughing outloud, with her head back doing one of those eeeee high pitched sounds the women and myself (these days) make when something is funny. i said, what does that mean with my innocent country prepubescent boy face... and she got near and said it means youve got the biggest penis.  you learn new forms of greeting everyday here."

stacked books, collected spices, packed bags, cluttered clothing.  curling steam from a tall glass of coffee, kind of like cartoon smoke.  shes addicted.  a pendant hanging from a silver chain that ive noticed around her neck since first seeing her.  a photo book with the last 10 months, she giggles with me from the other room as i remember outloud.  just laughter, no talking really.  she gets out from bathing, walks around the room looking for something, leaving damp footprints on the white tile.  i watch her.  i see softness on her naked back, curving lines that only women can capture, towel falling low on the waste. her black hair slides down from the shoulder in currents until the tips touch the bottom of her spine.  i sit until shes slipped those used socks up to the middle of her leg, and i smile slightly when she looks down on me.  i dont know if its built up to this moment... the random music, the chain between my fingers, the coffee smell, but im hugging her before the first tear falls... and it lasts and passes us by.  

one of my favorites just left for atlanta, packed bags, one way ticket, and i have memories more vivid than photographs.  shes promised to keep in touch."

"event","i like this paragraph...

forty three years old, and the war occurred half a lifetime ago,  and yet the remembering makes it now.  and sometimes remembering will lead to a story, which makes it forever.  thats what stories are for.  stories are for joining the past to the future.  stories are for those late hours in the night when you cant remember how you got from where you were to where you are.  stories are for eternity, when memory is erased, when there is nothing to remember except the story.

why does it have to hit like a storm?  i want to watch the drops turn to drips, dust lifted up in puffs, ripples reaching out.  but this overwhelming madness, taking cover with arms upraised, feeling it come down at all angles.  ive never known how to respond.  ill wait until the clouds clear, the dampness on hairs end dries, the blades of grass to uplift their faces again, and then ill say if i can truly call this a crush or not.

im in one of those places where the world pulls in all directions... around every corner there is someone calling, needing, asking, and im getting to the point where i want to say, shut up, im busy.  i want to shake something (except a freshly baked baby right out of the oven) and yell.  im not losing it, im smiling at passerbyes. shit, in just 5 minutes im going next door and having the special soup of the day... the soup of everyday... beef, and im going to flirt with the waitresses and talk about the weather.. the weather of everyday... hot and rainy.  giggle about stupid shit.  its what loosens the load, huh?  chunks of beef floating in salty water, fighting the buzzing of flies, and giggling at nonsense, complete and utter nothingness.  ah... maybe a coca cola too, to wash all that bullshit down the hatch. ahhh... refreshing."

"event","wrapped in a mosquito net, i watched the firefly try to escape between the cracks.  after 7 months im still living without any sort of cooking device... forks and sharp pointy objects, and frying pans, and rubbermaid seal topped containers.  im pinching my pennies.  but the other day i couldnt resist dropping about 10 bucks on a package of glow in the dark stars.  the stove can wait.  i stuck those stars all along the inside of my mosquito net in random constellations, and when night set, i laid on my back with my arms folded on my chest, one crisp sheet up to my stomach.  i found that they just werent working... dim even in darkness.  so i got my flashlight and set its beam against each individually placed star one time through, 10 seconds each... two times, 5 seconds each... third times a charm.  and after 10 minutes i sat beneath the stars and traced shapes, legends, and gods as the shooting star fire flies streaked across the sky.

i was thinking to myself about the impact of random people.  i mean, if i flip back a bit in time and let the memories flash in a blur, capturing freeze framed snap shots, i see these really vivid characters, people in my past who left an imprint deep in the lining of my person.  im talking, for example, about the woman inviting me in to clean her hotel room at the cottontree inn.  raccoon thick eyelashes, and thickly pasted foundation on this little rolled over woman sitting in her seat, beaming.  and as i tucked her sheets around the edges she carried on about the importance of shoes, about the profound connection between the feet and the mind, posture, balance, composure, respiration... all related to the proper footwear.  i had been bitching about my shoes, going home with sore soles, an aching arch... she changed my life... he he... im rambling, but i just find it strange how you can think about people who have stayed around for months or years at a time throughout the lifetime and even though you think highly of them and smile at the mention of their name or relationship, they just dont appear like that old woman, a moment doesnt stick, a quote or dialogue doesnt spark.  they are just there.  what makes those few float forever in the front of the mind, those few that change the line of sight, point of view, faced directions.  i was wrapped in a mosquito net and thinking to myself.

in the early morning in huancayo i missed the things he might have hated about us- the wide highways lined with doughnut shops, the fat cars, the endless entertainment, the unspectacular, unheroic, grandly petty life of prosperity and wraparound comfort.  life on the road was spare and beautiful, full of clarity and delight, but when i roused myself at dawn in huancayo i could not help but consider the last chance i would have to turn around from all this.

karen turned 29 yesterday.  everyone happened to be together in siguatapeque.  about 30 or so from the health project and about 25 from water and sanitation.  she sat in a chair on the stage as the speakers blared a beat and about 35 individuals took turns giving her a mock strip tease lap dance.  the 65 year old married couple bent their asses to and fro, kissing her on the cheek, and blushing all the while.  others sat right on her shaking their breasts in her face.  a 23 yearold put his hands on the floor and backed up onto her, his legs wrapped around her waist.  i watched as some young gals would go out in trio formation, dancing around her on all sides.  another guy stripped off his shirt, tossed it over her head, and pulled her face slowly to his crotch.  when the line faded, and had begun to spiral around her of those who had already strutted their shit, i got in line, backed my ass into the center of the stage to the beat, turned toward her, continued my jig over her lap, pulled her up from her seat, hugged her and told her how much we loved her.  her husband was the last spreading her legs while he stooped low, ending with a passionate kiss and tight embrace, as we finally all rushed upon them and pressed together, yelling happy birthdays into everyones ears.  i was left feeling the flushed cheeks of rum and coke, pleasantly warmed by the company and thinking to myself how i cant remember a better way to celebrate a birth."

"event","if you think about michael in the real world... that of driving the 1986 cheverolet celebrity (a little rusted, but with style) down the strip of yellowstone on his way to geraldines or budget, running on gas fumes, and blaring some tunes... take that image of michael... and place him in a little house, cement walls... in the middle of a small community on the coast of honduras.

the guys think my hands are weak from lack of wear or tear (i show them my callesed fingertips from hours of guitar play.. but that doesnt impress anyone)... the neighborhood thinks my skin is fragile to the bites of little bugs, the town doesnt know what the hell happened to my knee (what do i tell them... that i walked too much!?).. who is this guy, this michael?  the point... i think theyre right... im a sissy man, huh?  come out and say it!!! do i have any characteristic that stands out as manly... as testosterone filled masculinity... lets me honest... hell, im coming out and saying it!  i worked at a bakery!  i want to learn to knit!!  i cry during commercials... im a sap!  

the point of this rant folks!! is that this boy that left the states.. the guy who got jollies from growing his hair out and painting his nails.. flipping is scarf about like some bloody fashion queen is going to come back a man... and even though my hair is kind of gangly and stringy on my chest... im going to have a chistled form of pure 100 percent male beef to grow it upon... believe me.  no more cute little michael with the nice ass... no more... no more!!! you hear me!!! the time has come to grab those balls and claim myself as a man doing as men doing... BELCH...  raaaaahhhhhh!!!!

..break beer can over my head...

thanks for listening."

"event","i had her laughing so hard, tears streaming, face flushed red, a giggling fit at my fingertips.  i was on a roll and i delivered the punches on cue, drumrolls, applause, and all.  she told me i should be a stand up comic, and in that moment i believed her.

my fingers streamed across those strings in a blur of plucks and strums, and my voice reached a range in harmony with all intent.  i was in the flow of fluid musical motion, rhythm, scales, time, and all.  she introduced me as the next Bob Dylan, and in that moment i believed her.

the words poored from the pen, dipping straight from the ink of my open stream of consciousness and precisely pinning down the spinning, spiraling chaos of thought on paper.  i was expressively explosive, emotionally exhausted, with rhyme, stanzas, tenses, and all.  she suggested i write works for publication, and in that moment i believed her.

im a person who giggles at fart jokes, is completely tone deaf, and cant spell to save his life.  and those are the truths i know and life with.  but my mom believes in me.  she is completely and utterly biased, but she does just that.  it is during those moments when i have believed in myself.  on mothers day, i say thankyou, for feeling beautiful in her company, for having substance and structure, direction and inspiration, comfort and confidence, value and reason, from beneath her roof throughout my lifetime... for having her as my mom."

"event","i know this journal entry is over the top and romanticed, but im not going to defend it or explain it... it stands on its own.  i was hesitant to put it out there, but only jesus really cares.  


------------------------------------------------------------------
  

ive got specks of sand outside my window.  little dots floating upon a sea of aqua blues and turquoise greens, waves taking rest upon the softened beaches of white grains and shadowed banks.  pelicans perched upon wooden boats, schools of fish weaving in the shallows my feet, the water clear to all, playing with the sunlight at depths of currents and motion.  

and her i am, the norteamericano, on single specks of the greater globe.  catching a ride, wind whipping through my hair, land masses of palm trees, and dense greens, grasses, mangroves, all contained in the approaching structures of homes and hammocks.  i step foot off of a dock into the base of this boat, jumping from key to key, key to island, strolling through huts and salutations by hand, by voice, by expression.  

there are no burdens of flashing bulbs and fleeing film, no need to articulate what i feel with words and writing.  i cast myself in a foaming salt, around my body, gasping air upon breaking the surface once again.  a bed of water beneath my back, i lay with no effort, blankets flowing over my legs, sheets over my chest.  the voices, a murmuring strength, the wind, a whispering force cut silent when i lay back further, the sea in my ears.  i spin in a current, watching the world from below, clouds pluming in a sky all taking infinite variations of shape and color, shades and tones, to the setting sun.  the way this world moves.  i have no words, just a human body leaving a wake of bubbles and ripples, as the spinning disc, fluid forms, scaly textures, coral reefs, hallowed shells, close the day and invite the moon.  this night we bathe, taking hands upon our slippery skin, grabbing ahold of naked shoulders and stomaches, oily under the weight of contact.  laughter echoing out, splashes, crashing, toppling, running footsteps upon the shores, lit by the full moon, having its way with the clouds and the currents, the foilage from above, mirrored streaks shining white.  

im washing salty stones from between my toes, captured in the follicles of my hiar, fluid from the nostrils, skin parched and bitten... i say thankyou to life, without searching and longing, tourist traps and blind photography.  i have grains of sand just outside my window.  for two years i can dip my fingers along their surface, scratching the bottom, swimmind and immersed.  

as cotton whites hang from lines, fans buzzing in the air, blood filled mosquitos smeared on my forearm, soles rubbed raw and open, burnt cheeks and sweaty bands on my upper lip, i will remember it as a memory with an ongoing life that has just begun."

"event","i chose to wear my brown corduroy pants this morning... which means, that at 10 am. when im lugging a cumbersome piece of wood across the yard, i literally have a downpoor, a torrent, of concentrated sweat from my face... only my face.  the kind of sweat that flows through my scattered, lame excuse for eyebrows and burns the eyes with a salty force... but, even though you can see the heat radiating from the baking rocks and dust, im surprisingly getting kind of used to it.  its sweat, its natural, and i feel good about being hydrated and healthy and the fact that i can blend in with my neighbor, a 240 lb black woman of 45 years, who embraces me with her own free flowing sweat, sticky on the arms, harbored around the neck, and we can have that cultural exchange... sweat.. uniting nations together one drop at a time.  i have found a community that is not sensitive to pit stains, even on gray tshirts, and i seak shelter in their company at finally finding welcome to those of my kind. 

of course, deodorant is always a nice thing... and toothpaste."

"event","a shit story worth sharing as told by another volunteer:  

so imagine a group of guys sitting around a hotel room competing with one another over passing gas and laughing about it.  the once jovial cachaphony of sound took a wrong turn, however, when a overly excited friend came fresh out of the shower, uncovered his bathrobe, attracting much attention by his curious peers.  he stood over his bed, yelling, listen to this one, and let it rip.  unfortunately, his bowels were not in harmony with his motives, as he took a squat, he pressed out some gas, but also a down poor of diarrhea, all over his bed.  the room was left in a certain confusion and appropriate disgust as this short diatribe ends. 

hey kids... you need to write more!!!  and you know who you are... i think my recieving notes is going to be more of a necessity than a friendly request.  por favor."

"event","yeah.. my subject is misleading.  but it is time to pull out those maps of honduras, get your index finger and your close vision prepped, because i have been given a site...  drum roll... nueva armenia.   if you focus your attention on the north coast between la ceiba and trujillo, youll see my little dot sitting at the mouth of a river, below some spots of islands.  what the hell does this mean?  i have been selected to work with a garifuna population... research that one too, please!!!  which means im going to be learning another language over time, surrounded by seafood, a dance called the punta which orginated from there and is now spreading as most dance trends do.  

the garifunas have the highest rates of aids-hiv in the country, crazy rates, which explains my post.  i will be the first health volunteer there... a population of 1000 people, no internet (25 minute bus ride south), one of the poorest towns on the coast.  HOOOOOOTTTTTT!  so send me handkerchiefs and cool clothes because im going to be melting... i cant tell you how hot it is going to be.  

what else.  ill be living there in 3 weeks.  my vision to fashion a ping pong table, a hammock, some sort of garden with my guitar, straw hat, and sweat.  but ive yet to know my living or furniture situation.  im surrounded by some good friends about 2 hours travel in all directions and plan on working with them.  the others are all over the place as far south as the salvador border as far west as guatamala, but theyve all made requests to come and visit as tourists dont find there way to my site and i literally will have my back yard as the beach... cold beers and red snapper.... but lets be serious, the romance of sunrises and a coastal rendevouz does not ease the fact that i believe myself to be in one of the most difficult situations of the health group.  im not going to tell them that... because i think they all know it.  

by the way... im going to have to buy a cell phone.. duh duh duh.  as i know... know.. know... that i would like to hear your voices more often, which would cost you more than me... he he he.  but yeah.. a fucking cell phone.. the idea sends shivers down my spine... to be alone does even more damage.  

thats the news for now.  send my love."

I just had 2 weeks of being around people that miss me/love me/appreciate me (for who I am, not just what I do)/think I'm sexy, and ended with a sci-fi convention.  The emotional drop from the end of this vacation probably means I'm going to be crying on the plane the whole way home.  I wish I could just bring all my people up to Seattle, so I could have *everything* I need.  eating dinner alone tonight was starting to get me down, but then I noticed that the hotel bar had a couple of pool tables.  I dropped a dollar to be able to screw around a bit and just be bad at pool for a while, and ended up having quite a good time at it.  I really did start out being atrociously bad, as expected, but that made me laugh at myself, which made me feel loads better.  And then I started actually making my shots.  It was kind of weird.  I ended up having to chase the next-to-last ball around the table a bit, but I got the 8-ball in on the first try.  And I didn't scratch with the cue ball even once.  I guess I'm not as out of practice as I thought.

For all of those of you that I missed seeing while here:  apologies.  I did try, but my schedule really got weird there for a while."

Took the better part of 2 weeks to do, mostly because I only had access to the kiln at school for 3 hours at a time, and one of those was spent on pre-heating.  So, something like 6 firings later, this is what I've got.  I've also got a decent scan of it and I think it will make a good print.  Just in case though, I think the first edition will be limited to 20 prints."

I only had to give up my bag at the gate because the agent made me try it in the bag size checker, and the fit was a little tight.  This would not bother me except that a)that bag had fit just fine in the overhead bins of every airplane we'd been on so far, and b)I saw, with my own eyes, larger bags allowed on the plane.  One was so stuffed that the expandy bit had been unzipped, but there it was.  The best theory I can come up with is that I was discriminated against because I'd picked up a brain-sucker over the weekend and it was still attached to my head (though probably starving by that point in the trip)."

Right now I feel...Disposable.  Completely and utterly disposable.  It feels like simply because I've been saying for the last 4 months or so ""I'm a jeweler,"" the entire previous 33 years and 10 months of life experience, and all the other useful things I'm reasonably good at cease to exist.  I'm a Jeweler, so no one remembers that only last year I was doing graphics and print layout and web design.  No one ever thinks that I am capable of being genuinely more useful.  No one ever remembers that I am JUST AS SMART as the ex. (I even have recent test results to prove it).  So when I want to help out, and a Jeweler is not what is needed, I get the bottom-of-the-barrel assignments, the ones that *anyone* could do, because no one ever remembers that I can do more.

I am disposable, because no one will let me be genuinely useful."

Oh yeah, and still running the household, too.  I have managed to get all my travel plans for the rest of the year sorted out, with a certain amount of pain (Who knew that you had to buy airline tickets for xmas in February?).  I found a new trip organizer app: www.tripcase.com.  It's better than TripIt by an order of magnitude.  Better interface, Better iPhone App, just Better.  Mind, I haven't had the opportunity to test out flight delay alerts or other day-of-travel stuff, but I'm already much happier.  It helps me feel more in control of things, which I sorely needed after sorting out my tickets for xmas, and everyone's tickets for GenCon.  I was kind of late off the mark with both of them, so they were slightly more expensive than they should have been...oops.  The xmas Disney World trip in particular has been somewhat vexing to deal with.  I'm not looking forward to spending 2hrs at lunchtime in Milwaukee.  It doesn't look like a particularly inspiring airport. I've got flights going through Chicago on both trips, so possibly getting bumped and taking a later flight in exchange for compensation will be an option.

"event","<b>School:</b>

<u>Good news:</u>  I get to be an art student this quarter!
<u>Bad news:</u>  I get to spend my quarter around other art students, mostly in the 18-20 age range, so probably full of themselves and their ""artist-ness.""
<u>Good news:</u>  I get to learn to draw, solder silver, and play with clay & glaze
<u>Bad news:</u>  Art supplies are <i>expensive</i>.  I don't even have my supply lists yet and I know this.


<b>Travel:</b>

<u>Good News:</u>  I'm going to Disney World!
<u>Bad News:</u>  It's 5 months out, at the end of January
<u>Better News:</u>  Through dint of persistence, phone calls, good preparation, and precise question asking, I'm spending the last 3 days of my trip in a concierge room at Animal Kingdom Lodge (translation: there will probably be giraffes and antelope outside my balcony, there's free snacks and booze in the lounge all day, and you have People at your beck and call to make dinner reservations and book special tours, etc.)
<u>Best News:</u>  I've booked a Sunrise Safari (something I've wanted to do for <b>years</b>) for 1/31/10.
<u>More good news:</u> The first part of my vacation will be at Boardwalk Villas (good food/entertainment immediately available, and walking distance to Epcot), and I've got what is basically a 1-bedroom apartment for both locations the whole week, which includes a jacuzzi tub.
<u>Bad news:</u>  This is the last year I'm going to be able to do this for a while.  For the next 3 years, I'm only going to be able to go right around Christmas, and things are a tad bit more expensive then.  So it will probably be ""studio"" rooms (a bit bigger than a regular hotel room, but no jacuzzi) for those years.
<u>Silver lining:</u> The cost difference is such that I can probably afford better views/locations in a Studio (overlooking the Boardwalk, anyone?)
<u>Good News:</u> my flight out is in First Class.  The first leg is overnight and the second leg is morning, so I'll have a comfy seat to sleep in, and be fed a decent breakfast in the morning.  I will arrive at about 10am, fed, reasonably well-rested, and ready to go.  I may or may not end up having a second breakfast at the Chick-fil-A at the Orlando airport.
<u>Bad News:</u>  the flight back is in coach.  It matters less since it's all in one day.  I'll probably be scribbling in my travel journal the whole time anyway.
<u>Good news:</u>  I'm a compulsive over-planner, and the knowledge and notes so gained make the trip go much more smoothly, particularly when it comes to knowing what all the other options are when the Plan Goes Out the Window.
<u>Bad news:</u>  I'm a compulsive over-planner, so 5 months out, when I don't even have park hours yet, I've already got tricky scheduling problems involving mickey-shaped ice cream bars, carnival games, and escargot.  This isn't really bad news, because I <i>LOVE</i> these kinds of problems.  When you get the right kind of chart, scheduling is just a great, giant puzzle.  :)


<b>Miscellaneous</b>

<u>Good news:</u>  I'm feeling well
<u>Bad News:</u>  This is in comparison to having Strep last week.
<u>Good News:</u>  I turned on the TV last week to find that our channel selection had expanded, and we now had Ovation (arts), the Science Channel, and DIY.
<u>Bad News:</u>  I turned on the TV today to find that DirecTV had taken away my Arts & Sciences.  Apparently it was just a 1-week teaser to convince people to buy the next package up.  Fuckers.
<u>Good news:</u>  what I <i>did</i> get to see on Ovation has made me 1) less nervous about drawing class, and 2) far more inspired about creative endeavors in general.

I think that's it for now."

"event","Interesting.  and big.



So the trip started Wednesday with taking a later flight, and getting $300 for it.  We did eventually get there, and I got checked into a tiny hotel room with 2 other girls, neither of whom I knew, which was a bit cramped in a room that contained 2 full-sized beds, a dresser, a desk, and a chair (there was supposed to be a 4th one of us, but she took one look at the size of the room and went off to find other accommodations.).  We sorted ourselves out, I met a bunch of new people, and went to sleep.

Thursday: Opening day.  Opening shift.  I go to the dealers room at 8am for some last-minute training, ""industry & special guests"" start wandering through at 9, and the doors generally opened at 10.  Let me note here that the Catalyst booth was directly in front of the main dealers room doors.  At about 5 minutes till, we had a number of people with various video recording equipment positioned in the booth to capture the opening madness.  I chatted with a few from behind my little podium that I was going to be doing game demos on.  There was also a very large game table between me and the doors, which I came to be thankful for.  Then, the doors opened, and the masses rushed in.  It was a bit...overwhelming.  I spent the next 4 hours demoing my game constantly.  when shift was over, I went back to my room to change out of booth uniform (black pants, catalyst t-shirt), had lunch with someone new that had contacted me via some of my new hobbies (didn't go terribly well.  he was 19 and we didn't have a lot in common), and started exploring the convention center complex.  So, after a bit of wandering up and down halls and up and down escalators, I discovered, of all things, a full-on shopping mall, containing, of all things, a Chick-fil-A!  This is one of the things I dearly miss from living in Texas, so I had some dinner and took my drink cup back with me to the dealers room, where I was sure to find JP.  Sure enough, he was there.  I held up the cup and declared my discovery of the mall.  He was jazzed, to say the least.  I wandered off again.  I eventually had dinner somewhere and landed in the hotel bar, where they are *VERY* serious about their rum-&-cokes.  There I met some nice guys form another vendor and commenced chatting about the various things we do/make/sell.  They bought me another drink, and we had a lovely time.  They eventually moved on to another bar, and I went to bed.

Friday:  Slept in a bit, then went out searching for girl-supplies (did I mention that during all this I was also having the very worst gushing-like-a-stuck-pig part of my period?) and had a lovely brunch.  I was on mid-day shift rather than opening, and it went about like it had the day before--4 continuous hours of talking about the game I was on.  Friday night I went to a seminar on gamer ""oral history"" (read: the stories that get told about why/how things happened), to see a performer (geek/comedy music) and then hung out with Troy, and discussed some of the things I found odd about working a con of this size (there was another rum/coke involved there, too).  Whether in uniform or out (I still had the Catalyst badge lanyard to identify who I belonged to, even when in regular clothes), I got asked all kinds of Catalyst-related questions, like (frequently) ""I submitted fiction, but never heard back either way.  Who do I bug to find out if they even got it?"", and ""who do I talk to if I have a proposal for...?""  I also got some information to correct the oral history guy about who actually owns some of the IP Catalyst licenses. anyway, that was fun, and it was time for bed again.

Saturday:  Opening shift again, and if anything, the mob was worse than Thursday.  4 hours later and I'm free again.  It's costume contest day, so I get some food and make my way over to the theater to watch the show.  the costumes were neat, but the performances that went with them were better.  Also, the belly dancers in the pre-show were awesome.  After that, I wandered around the dealers room again, got some food, and took off for this evenings round of concerts and filk-singing.  had much fun and more booze, and actually sing in public for the first time in more than 10 years, I think.  considering the state of my voice form talking all weekend, I think I didn't do too badly.

Sunday:  Turns out that even though I'm staying till Monday, my room ends today.  I ping the powers that be at Catalyst, pack my bags, and haul them down to be stored by bell services.  It's another opening shift day, but only 3 hours this time.  Once I'm off shift, I finally do my shopping.  I looked at some leather bodices, but couldn't even get so much as a nod from the booth proprietor to ask about sizes etc., so I moved on...
Ok, so, a quick question for those you you who have known me for a while:  Do y'all remember that problem I had with dice, specifically about collecting them (particularly nifty, shiny ones)?  The problem that hasn't been an issue since I stopped gaming many years ago and was no longer around dice?  Do you also remember that we're talking about a gaming convention here? 
... 
Yeah.  I ultimately spent an absurd amount of money on dice, like $40.  All D6s, too.  And yes, they're shiny.
So the dealers room shut down at 4 and I showed up for booth disassembly duty.  Having done this kind of thing before, I insinuated myself into a bunch of the electrical and packing type duties, fitting things into boxes that people were swearing couldn't be done.  I also discussed with booth manager what sorts of duties I might have next year.  After that, I was exhausted, and appropriated one of the boys' room keys so I could retrieve my luggage and shower.  Refreshed, I went to dinner, was found a bed for the night, and crashed like the dead.

Monday:  Up at 7 to catch a cab at 8 for a 10am flight.  get to the airport, check in/check bags, eat breakfast at the airport version of the place I had brunch in on Friday.  Inspect boarding passes and find that the departure times are significantly later than we thought.  we check the time screens to learn that flight has been delayed.  We proceed through security, and ask the awesome lady at the gate desk what's up.  Apparently there's been weather doom in Chicago that morning, and Chicago air traffic doom has a way of perpetuating itself across the system rather rapidly.  So we wait to see if there's a chance of our flight getting in on time to catch our connection, and when the answer is no, the nice lady tries to get us something else.  Unfortunately, due to Chicago's doom, and the departure of GenCon, everything was full until 6.  As previously noted, there are far worse places to spend the day than the Indianapolis airport, and we did eventually get home.

Other random stuff:  There were a lot of video-recording devices in the dealers room, and many of them pointed at me while I was doing my job.  I know I'm cute, but I still don't like being on film.  There is now far too much photographic evidence of my existence.  Also there was some control-issue Drama surrounding booth management the details of which I was somewhat privy to but <i>didn't involve <b>me</b> at all</i> (see, I'm not always the problem child).  This has made me start thinking about the concept of ""place"" (as in ""knowing one's..."").  There will be some sort of journal entry on this, but whether it's here, in my paper journal, or in one of the blogs available to me via my new hobbies (or different versions in several of the above), I don't yet know.

Anyway, that's what I've been up to for the last week."

The airport is not even a year old yet, so it's still shiny. It's also well designed and stocked with good food. The seats aren't terribly un-comfy either. Here's hoping that this flight doesn't get cancelled and we make St Louis in time to catch the connection to Seattle, so I can be home tonight, because if this fails, we'll be stuck <i>somewhere</i> until tomorrow.

Before all you folks back in Texas and other warmer climes start muttering things like ""Bah, 100 is nothing.  We've got 112."" and ""Geez Liz, when did you get so wimpy?"" I would like to point out one major thing that you may not have considered:

Seattle is largely UN-AIR-CONDITIONED.

Seriously.  Almost no residences have AC (none of the places we've lived, and they've been some pretty decent places), and only some businesses, mostly the larger ones.  Shall I tell you how jealous I am of all you folks down there living your refrigerated lives?

It makes me wonder if I'm ever gonna feel this way again....

I want to hold you and love you in my arms and then
I want to lead you 'cause I need to be with you 'til the end
Then I hear myself reply you've got to hold it in.....

If only I had the guts to feel this way
if only you'd look at me and want to stay.....

I sit here waiting wondering hoping that I'll make this right
'Cause all I think about is your hands
Your face and all these lonely nights
There's a feeling screaming in the back of my head
Saying over and over....

I want to hold you love you in my arms and then
I want to need you 'cause I need to be with you 'til the end
Then I hear myself reply she'll never let you in.....

I want to hear you say
It'll always be this way
We'll be hand in hand for every night and every day....

Bits and pieces of a song, by this band I just found out about...they call themselves Hanson...and I really like their songs, especially this one, cuz it's....<s>kinda how I feel about Triana</s> a nice song. They're kinda cute, and it's not every day you see a girl rock band. Nice. <s>Totally can't let Hank find out I like a girl rock band though, I'd never hear the end of it.</s>

Maybe I'll come test it out sometime soon.

Also, another thing for me to try to figure out....I asked him why he and Skwisgaar fight so hard core all the time, I thought they were friends....something was brought up about....they had a....GOOD kind of hate?

Since I'm....accident prone...so he says. I coulda handled them! ....oh well. It's always good to have a little cash in the pocket! ^-^

Hank and I got hover snow mobiles from Uncle JJ!! How cool is that?! They're awesome!! And dude!! ....Unlce JJ secretly gave me another present....he said Santa left it at his house by mistake but it was for me. ....Santa? Er...it DID say from Santa on it. I thought that....nevermind. Anyway, it was a cute little robot dog! It was like, like an iDog, but only it can walk and follows you around and plays whatever song you tell it to....as long as you've programed it into it. Like, it follows voice commands. And it lights up and everything! It's so cute!! I named it Scamp...after our dearly departed doggy....I miss Scamp.

I still have to give Hank his Christmas present....we share a room so it's hard to keep presents a secret from each other....I had to hide it really well. And....I kinda forgot where I hid it. I'll find it eventually though! And...boy will he be suprised. I'm glad Triana liked her present, she seemd pretty happy with it. I'm happy she liked it. Brock got uh....I found one of those Christmas videos Hank and I snagged...last year. For...viewing purposes...and just wrapped it up and gave it back to him. Hoping he wouldn't notice it was once his...and that we had snagged it. And Pop got....Hank and I made him some cookies and...I bought him a bath robe...and gave him a little coupon I made....for one free lab assistant! I'll help him out with whatever he needs in the lab one day! ....he didn't seem as excited about it as I had hoped but...he said thank you though.

And...that was my Christmas pretty much! Hope everyone enjoyed theirs!

I....I hope....Hank and Triana enjoyed our little visit as much as I did. I...had alot of fun. I'm glad we got to spend that time together. Yeah. We should...do it again sometime?

I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind
There's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
While every day my confusion grows

...some songs are just...so pretty.

Triana, I can't wait for your birthday! I've got your presents already....I wish I could just give them to you now! I really really hope you like them!

Hank kissed me. I just....he said....golly, I don't wanna think about it anymore.

Triana gave me something to drink that I drank in one huge gulp, not knowing what it was and wished I hadn't right afterwards. It made my nose and throat burn and eyes water. Then I started feeling all hot....and taking my clothes off. What the heck was wrong with me?!

Turns out I ended up showing off those Santa boxers Tri got me with the hat after all, after being determined NO ONE would see me in them! Geez...

Aaaaand....I don't remember what happened after that...but I woke up in Triana's bed at her apartment....still wearing just those boxers and that hat that keeps falling into my eyes....WITH Triana in bed with me....wearing just HER Christmas undies she got at Victoria's Secret...oh...man....<s>talk about EMBARASSING. I hope we didn't do it or something!</s> My reaction was embarssing enough, nevermind the situation in general! I jumped up and screamed and ran for the door in my undies! Tri calmed me down though and explained the situation...still....I'm feeling reeeeeally weirded out by that....

"event","Christmas shopping with Triana today! Was...interesting. Kinda embarassing actually....

The very FIRST store she made me go in with her? Victoria Secret! Geez, I always promised myself I'd NEVER go in that store and....look what happened. I could just feel how red my face was...and she kept holding up frilly things saying ""Do you think this would look good on me?"" I was glad to get outta there.....

Then we went to TJ Maxx for the rest of our shopping. I wandered over to the men's section to pick up a pack of underwear for Hank cuz he asked me to...and Triana....she spotted these boxers. These red velvet-ish boxers, with white trim....and they came with a Santa hat. And...she told me I'd look so cute in them and she was buying them and I HAD to wear them....at the Christmas party. And she did buy them. And....I'm afraid I'm gonna have to wear them.

Then we went to a cozy little cafe nearby and split a BLT sandwich and had some hot cocoa...and chatted some. It felt...nice. Afterwards we just wandered around the mall some, observing the decorations and the people and the sales different stores were advertising and so on...and humming the Christmas music that was playing as we walked along.

That was fun Triana, thanks for coming shopping with me. I picked up something for Brock and something for Pop....now I just need....Hank, Dr. Orpheus, Kim, and...Triana. Hmm...

Well, I'm home and I'm trying to work on this project Hank wants me to do...but I think I'll hit the sack for now and work on it more tomorrow. Later!

The spiders got him, but I let Nibbles out and he ate them all up. And...I think he wants me to go out and buy him some new underwear while I'm out finishing up my Christmas shopping with Triana tomorrow.

I went over to Triana's house to make some Christmas cookies.We had alot of fun, making snowman shapped cookies that looked like her and me and I made one of Hank and she made one of Pop...and we made a Santa one that looks like Brock! And we made some of her grandma's famous chocolate chip cookies too! And while they were baking...we....hung out and...talked. I tried to show her how I played Jingle Bells on my bass but I got too nervous and couldn't do it heh.

Triana really is...an awesome person. I hope she knows that. We started talking about...things and....I feel...alot better then I have the past few....days...weeks even. I...don't really feel....like, empty anymore. 

I've....found my cable.

I went to tuck her in before I left, but she wanted me to stay with her just a little longer....and we fell asleep cuddling on her bed. I woke up just now...and I couldn't have been happier about where I was. And now I'm going back to bed! I'll stop by the compound before we go shopping to feed Nibbles and drop the cookies off....good night!

I...I think we need to call it quits on our...relationship. I'm really sorry. I just...don't really think I love you. I mean, I like you a WHOLE lot, you're a great, awesome person! But...I don't...feel like I can be anything more then a friend to you. I mean, the kissing and so on...I just don't feel right. That's why I hardly ever say ""I love you"" back. 

...I'm really really sorry, Kim. I hope you understand. And I hope you forgive me. And I hope we can...still be friends. And I can still be Dr. Arachnid and help you out when you need me....but I'd prefer it to be for technical things only. Or...anything that doesn't require me being cruel.

I'm taking my things and going home now, back to the compound. Er...I'll come back for my golden statue later, if that's ok.

I'm...so confused on things.

Kim's really into this whole training the henchmen thing. She's really got things running pretty good, and the henchmen listen to her and respect her. Whenever I try to get them to do things though, they just kinda look at me as if to say ""you're kidding me, right?"" or they laugh at me. I even tried being mean a little, and it STILL didn't work...until Kim saw me trying and that they weren't listening and screamed at them to respect me just as well as her.

I mean...I'll give it a little more time I guess but...I just don't know if things are going to work out.

To add the the confusion...Triana. Triana wrote a poem. To me. TO ME. About...loving me. And...I almost starting crying. I mean, doesn't she know...that I love Kim now? What does she expect me to do? Just...just drop Kim and come running to her, even after all the times I tried with HER and she just ignored me rather cold-heartedly? Really, that's just cruel to Kim, and...just, not right. <s>But my heart is hurting and my brain is just going to explode!</s> I have no idea what I should do. I know she's in pain and I hate to reject her...

Man, life..just sucks right now for me. I guess I...just need to take things as they come. Tomorrow's another day, and maybe things will be better. Maybe if I focus my confusion into anger and focus the anger toward the henchmen...I can finally get them to take me seriously.

In other news, Nibbles is growing SO fast! He's like, the size of my head now! Wow! Cute little zombie spider...maybe if I set him on the henchmen, they'll listen to me THEN! HA!

Heard Hank totally blew it with that comic book. Bummer, I bet it was worth SO much too. None of my Spiderman ones are special ones, though I assume they're all worth at least a little. Oh well, they're still slightly amusing to read, though I prefer mysteries.

Well...back to my room I go...to feed Nibbles...maybe read a little...<s>but mostly wonder what the heck I'm doing with my life right now and if it's what I WANT to be doing with my life...</s>

<s>I wonder if anyone at home misses me...or even notices that I'm gone.</s>

Constantly screaming at them and calling them horrible names and such? It just seems...so cruel to me. I don't know, I tried to be a little mean but, I just felt so bad doing it.

Maybe I'll be better at it tomorrow.

Right now we're at a bar...Kim took the henchmen out for drinks and fun, as a reward to those who survived I guess heh. They're all drunk off their butts...and so is Kim...and they're all having fun with their joking around and singing and such. It's...pretty amusing I guess. 

Kim keeps asking me to drink and have fun with her too but...I dunno, I just don't feel up for it. I drank a little bit in hopes I'd...start feeling the fun too.

Well, lets forget about that and focus on the fun...bottoms up, huh? Good thing Brock's not here. Hope I don't totally embarass myself...

"event","Ya know, I didn't even know that Kim had left a big mark on my neck from kissin' me at my birthday party...she calls it...a hickey? I was wondering what it was, though when I pointed out to her it was almost cleared up...but she went ahead and made it worse, cuz...I think she likes embarassing me for some reason. It makes her smile...

I...I told Kim I had some things to do at the mall before we left for our training in Mexico. I told her it was Christmas shopping and she couldn't come. I...I DID go to the mall...and I DID try and find a Christmas present for her but...couldn't find anything I thought she'd like. So...I'll have to ask her what she wants and go back and try again. I picked up some more mice for Nibbles though...and then...I went and visited Triana. By myself. She got on last night and talked to me a little and asked me to come over. Just me. I don't know why she didn't want Kim to come...but she said...just me...and not to tell Kim. So...I did. I felt kinda...guilty but...I did it. She...was just so sick...she seemed...in so much pain. Physically and mentally, really. I went with the intentions of...being friendly and taking care of her some, keeping her company and all...FRIENDLY. Not..what you might be thinking, I swear. 

She...threw up some...and though it grossed me out (usually seeing other people throw up makes me wanna too) I...I got her the bucket, and held her hair back for her, and cleaned whatever mess was made up for her. She kept smiling at me for doing this, though everytime her eyes would fill with tears almost instantly. I...I don't know what's going on. She...wanted me there, so badly it seemed...but yet she kept breaking down in tears everytime I'd help her. Maybe the cough meds she's taking make her a little loopy. When she wasn't throwing up, she was either sleeping or rambling on to me about how her life sucks so much, and she's made so many wrong choices she wishes she could take back, and how she thought coming back from the dead would be like a fresh start on life for her but she totally blew it (...WHAT?!) and she was sorry she dragged me into it and screwed my life up too...and she was sorry she kept hurting me and she loved me so much but it was too late now, she snoozed she lost....I have no idea what any of it meant. I think that cough syrup had a horrible effect on her, she was...speaking crazy 99% of the time. I just started nodding and saying ""uh huh"" to her...cuz...none of it really made any sense. <s>Deep down though...really deep down in my heart...I silently hoped that maybe...just maybe...her finally admitting that she loves me...wasn't crazy talk. I...I have Kim now though, and I...love her. But something in me ached when she said that...</s>

When she finally stopped babbling on and...I don't know if she passed out or just fell asleep...but when she was quiet, I got up and cleaned things up and made her my mad awesome chicken soup. When she woke back up, she seemed so drained...I put on the live action TMNT movie and we watched it together while I fed her my soup...and when it was over I left. She just...the way she kept looking at me everytime I'd give her some soup...and the way she looked at me when I finally said goodbye...she's hurting. Not just physically because of her cold either. I feel so bad but...with Kim...I can't help it. I...love Kim now. I'm sorry...her eyes were filled with tears as I reached for the door, and her pitiful attempt to look happy as she said goodbye and thanks for coming over....<s>and I don't think she knows, but I heard her start sobbing as I closed the door behind me. It just makes me feel 10 times worse...</s> 

*gulps*

I...I had a nice time, Tri...I hope you feel better soon. I...I'll come over sometime soon again if you need some company. But, I'll be in Mexico training the henchmen with Kim until Sunday so...I'll see you sometime after then.

Yeah, I went in Pop's room and got it back for ya...I'll take the heat if Pop or Brock say anything. Try not to get it taken away again,kay? Heh. I know you think it's mushy and gay but, <s>I love ya, brother. Even though we fight alot...I really don't know what I'd do without ya</s>....you're awesome, Hankinator. Go Team Venture!

In other news, what have I been up to? Nothing, really. Just...reading the first aide and GOCI books and playing with Nibbles. He's alot of fun, little zombie spider...he's growing really fast too! Oh and...Kim's trying to teach me how to be more...bossy and take charge with the henchmen. I mean, they aren't taking me really serious when I ask them to ""please do this, if you want...if you don't mind""....so, she's trying to teach me how to...be...well, I guess I need to learn how to be mean sometimes. It's kinda hard though, I don't like yelling at people if I can help it.

Triana's very sick....very...very sick. I really hope she'll be okay. I hope she knows...I'll come visit her if she's lonely or needs any help. I've been told I make a mean chicken soup...just...say something and...yeah.

Well, that's about all I've been up to lately. So...see ya around.

~Dea..er...Dr. Arachnid~

Edit: Oh I meant to mention...incase you're wondering...why the house is one golden naked lady statue down...I had the henchmen go in and move it into my room in our lair when I dropped Hank's gift off. So yeah, got my naked lady statue in my lair in my OWN ROOM now! A room that I don't have to share with anyone! Er, no offense, Hank. Sometimes though...you know how it is. With...privacy and all. *ahem*"

When I woke up she was all snuggling up to me smiling...I forgot I had climbed in bed with her last night. That was kinda...awkward for a moment but...I got used to it and it was kinda nice.

<lj-cut text=""Thanks for coming to my party everyone!"">
My party was...well, it was okay. It was kinda...bad, but the gifts defiantely made up for it so that's cool.
I'm actually eating the guitar freezy pop Mister Skwisgaar got me and wearing the suit Mister Manager got me right now...so thank you for that, I look pretty snazzy in it actually. Though I was just making sure it fits...I'm only gonna wear it on special occasions though. That Spiderman comic...how old is that? I bet it's worth SO MUCH! And, it's a pretty good one too! So, thanks Mister White! Just finished off the champagne Mister Pickles, thank you!

Between Mister White's comic book, Brock's first aide book (which will DEFINATLEY come in handy, thanks Brock!) and the Guild book m..m...mom gave me, I'll definately have lots of new reading material to keep me busy, so thanks one and all for that! I love reading...

Got some cool stuff for my new super villian gig too! Miss Molotov gave me a cool little mechanical spider that you can put smoke bombs in and send ahead of you into a room, that's neat! Thanks! And Monarch gave me the BEST glove weapon I've EVER seen! Fits me perfectly and you can put poison in it and..wow, it's just great! Thanks so much Mister Monarch! Oh! And Dr. O got me the cutest little zombie spider! ZOMBIE SPIDER! And he's gonna grow up to a BIG zombie spider! I decided to name him Nibbles...since he accidently bit me when I fed him his first mouse this morning after Kim and I went out to pick some up for him. Oh, I meant to ask...he's not..I mean, that's not gonna have any effect on me, right? He did break the skin a little, but I know he didn't mean to, he was just hungry. I feel fine and everything...I just thought I should make sure though.

Pop got me and Hank mini walking eyes and gift cards for Amazon.com...one of the walking eyes blew up though...Hank and I can share the other one I guess, but I left it at home for him. I'll just play with it whenever I visit. I figured out why the guitar Mister Murderface got me didn't sound right...it needed an AMP! So I used Pop's gift card to order one off Amazon.com! It should be here tomorrow prolly...Thanks Pop and Mister Murderface! I'm gonna be a rock star! I'm already trying to write a theme song for Kim and I!

I have some weird black box sitting next to me here from Mister Pierre...but I'm afraid to open it. I don't know what might be inside it and for some reason it's scaring me. Um...oh, Triana got me a HUNDRED DOLLAR gift card for the mall! ...pretty cool of her, huh? And I just LOVE the pjs and plushie Kim bought me...they make me feel all cuddly...yay!
</lj-cut>
The BEST present of all though...was TOTALLY the SOLID GOLD NAKED LADY STATUES Mister Lupin and Mister Jigen dropped off for Hank and I...through our ceiling...but seriously, those things...I couldn't stop staring....I mean, wow. *blush* That was the ONE present I couldn't take with me when I packed my stuff up to move in the lair, and...but I'm TOTALLY coming back for it!! I'll make all the henchmen go grab it and move it into my room here in the lair tomorrow. THANK YOU MISTER LUPIN AND MISTER JIGEN!!!

Oh, Mom also got me some web shooting gloves like Spiderman...and Hank a Batarang. I was trying to figure out how to make my gloves work and ended up accidently spraying Hank in the face right when he threw his Batarang and it came back and hit me in the eye. So I have a nice big purple and blue eye now...though it looks kinda cool now that the swelling's down. I look almost...kinda....tough heh. Cool. Oh, Mom also kidnapped us...that was scary beyond all belief. But Brock got us back...and Mom had Hank's watch (I wonder if he ever got it back...) and she called me later before I went to bed and said she was sorry, she didn't mean to freak us out. Just thought I'd let ya know that Hank, I was supposed to tell you...since you were asleep.

Well, it's late, I'm getting tired so I'm gonna go change into my pjs, grab my plushie and feed Nibbles one last time before I grab Brock's first aide book and read a little then hit the sack. I get kinda squirmy watching Nibbles eat those mice but...*shrugs* Guess it's part of nature, eh?
OH HANK! I forgot to give you your Birthday present from me! I'll come give it to ya tomorrow,okay? Didn't think I'd forget to get my own brother something, did ya?

Speaking of Kim...I'm so glad she forgave me and understood...I felt rather stupid about that whole freakin' out over the tattoo thing. Needles are...well, lets just say I hate them ALOT. So once again...sorry.

Kim came over cuz we were both bored, we were sitting there just fine...Hank and I bickered a little....but when Kim went to the bathroom we talked and now we're cool, which is good.

Then Kim suddenly decided she wanted a tattoo. Asked if me and Hank wanted one...Hank had to go off like an idiot and ask Pop if we could get one and of COURSE he said no. But...Kim wanted us to come with her anyway and we did.

The place...was freaky. And the tattoo guy like, didn't speak at all. And did you know that getting a tattoo involved getting stabbed over and over by a BIG BUZZING NEEDLE?! AND YOU BLEED?! Oh GEEZ it was HORRIBLE! I thought I was gonna pass out!! And...I kept clinging to Hank. Like...alot. And he kept pushing me away and calling me a homo. I was like...shaking and stuff...I thought he'd understand....<s>he knows I always turn to him for comfort when I get really scared. He always used to just let me cling to him and pat me on the head and say ""It's okay Dean-o"" but...not this time.</s> It just made everything worse. 

Now I think Kim thinks I'm mad at her or don't like her or something...AND that I'm a homo!

Oh man. I'm sorry Kim. I was just...really freaked out. I...hope you like your new tattoo. Come visit me tomorrow, we'll go to the movies. Just us. No Hank, no Triana...just you and me.

I'm sorry, I hope you understand. I suck at this whole relationship thing, huh?

Yeah, I'd say my trip to the mall was pretty great. I mean, it was kinda bad at first. I got kinda mad Hank was there...with Triana at that. I mean like...really mad. Kim and Triana wandered off to talk and...I kinda started yelling at him. And, he totally didn't get it. And...I ended up punching him in the mouth. Which ended with me getting covered in ketchup and shoved on the floor. And led to...Hank walking out on us....he said something to me...that I didn't really understand. But..he wouldn't tell me what he meant. He seemed really upset about it though...

Triana and Kim talked some more after I apologized to them and I just kinda sat there at the table with my head down, feeling bad about what I did....I didn't mean to...it wasn't really Hank's fault. 

Some things just...aren't meant to be.

We went after Hank and found him in Triana's car, and Triana made us all get in with him and talk about why we were fighting. And somehow...I have no idea what happened but....KIM TOLD ME SHE LOVED ME. Wow...how cool is that?! I mean, I've had a crush on her but never really said anything cuz I didn't want her to say no and then have our villian team up...relationship...thing...kinda awkward. But she asked me out! How cool is that?! SOMEONE actually LOVES ME and APPRECIATES MY WORK! Oh man, I feel...so great!

Kim had to go cuz she had a meeting for some mission or something but she's coming over later tonight. To....snuggle and stuff...I guess...*ahem* so...yeah.

So, things started out kinda sucky but..ended up being really great! Execpt...Triana says she's going back to Limb. And...I think Hank might still be mad at me, despite how many times I've said sorry. Well...I guess you can't win them all...

"event","Well, Uncle JJ called me. On my communicator watch. While I was in the shower. Our watches are water proof, but I normally take it off anyway while I'm in the shower....and the one time I don't.....

Awkward? Kinda. I mean, I kept yelling I'M IN THE SHOWER! thinkinging it was Pop or Hank or Brock and that they'd hear me and leave me alone, but the call alert just wouldn't stop beeping....and Hank yelled THAT'S NICE NO ONE CARES!

So...I answered, and it was Uncle JJ, and he wanted to talk to me ""man to man""....while I'm in the shower? I even asked if I could call him back and he said no it was important! I mean, couldn't he see that....I mean, I wasn't wearing a shirt, my hair had shampoo in it, and there was water coming down all around me! Geez...

Well, I made sure I held my wrist at chest level the whole time. Still...wow.One of the weirdest things I've ever had to do...talk to someone LIVE while in the shower. And really, what he wanted to say wasn't that important that it couldn't wait. He just wanted to say again that I shouldn't be doing this super villian thing and it would get me in trouble and so on...but then started giving me little hints and tricks to putting the lair together and ideas and so on here and there...that made sense, right? Don't do this Dean, but if you're going to, use this brand of engine instead of this one and so on. Um, ok.

I'm taking a small break from putting everything together anyway. I hope Kim doesn't mind. I mean, I got the costumes done, they should be coming in tomorrow actually. And the plans for the lair are like 95% done, I just have one little calculation that's giving me an issue, and then I can send it off to have it built. And the ads are half way done, I just have to add the text and print them out and pass them around. And then I've gotta do the weapons. So everything's either done or half way done. I feel like I've been stressing myself out on this though, working too hard. So, I'm gonna take a break for a few days. Then I'll get back on it.

My birthday's soon! More on that later!

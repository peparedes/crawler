"event","I've been lucky enough in my life to have loved twice.  Yes, I believe it was love, it was all that I knew of love at that point in my life.  It wasn't perfect, you hardly ever see perfect love.  Is it even possible? Lookin back, there are so many things that could've gone differently, that could've changed the course of my love life.  I think about the paths I could've taken, and I don't regret not taking them.  Just as Rent states, ""Forget regret, or life is yours to miss."" It still doesn't stop me from thinking about it.  What I can do next time to make it great. Love is a hit or miss, and I'm starting to think my most recent attempt is probably a miss.  Why do you always want the ones you can't have?  I guess I just don't want to miss out on something that could be great.  You never know unless you give it a try.  It's hard to admit defeat especially when it comes to matters of the heart.  When you are bettered in sports or when u don't do so well on a test that you think you've aced or anything of the sorts, it stings for a day, and then it goes away.  When your heart is worn down, recovery takes a long while.  You can be braindead and still live, but the moment your heart is done, you're done.  And it's funny how things work sometimes.  You can get used to being single, and just start enjoying it, and once you forget about lookin for someone, you find someone.  Obviously, you don't get angry about it.  and it's a great feeling because when you start enjoying being single, it means you've forgotten how love feels.  Love that gets into you, into your brain, into your bones, all the way into your soul and just saturates you.  I want that again.  But is it worth looking for it right now?  I'm graduating from college in sixteen weeks. well, technically I'm graduating over Summer, but whatever... the point is, I won't be an undergrad any more, and more to the point, all though I'll be at SDSU still next year, I'm doing student teaching which means I'm probably not even going to be on campus.  So what if I find someone who's graduating this year?  What's going to happen after graduation? Will she stay in SD with me? Go home to wherever she lives?  I don't know how well I'd do in a long distance relationship.  And what about a younger girl... I'd feel kind of like an old man if I was out of college already teaching and she was still workin on her bachelor's degree.  and what about my plans for the future.  They're not solid plans, but I would like to maybe do international teaching in Spain for a year and maybe Japan for a year.  It would be awesome to have someone I was that close who would move there with me.  If not, I'll get a puppy.... Funny thing, I am listening to this guy I found on purevolume named Too Sorry for Apologies, and one of his songs, Sunlight and Photographs, starts with an announcer saying ""There's a force in this universe that makes things happen. All you have to do is get in touch with it, stop thinking, let things happen.""  Haha, easier said than done... but it's a good quote.  But, my conclusion to this whole mess which I call some of my innermost thoughts, I think in the end, no matter what, love is worth it.  The heartaches, the crushes(which crush your hopes of finding love sometimes), the break ups, the make ups, the nights you spend listening to emo music, just thinking and livejournaling= )..... It's all worth it, I'm not goin to stop lookin for love.  I'm just going to try to look forward to new love. New love..."

"event","School starts in eight days.... it's time to organize and mentally prepare myself for technically my last semester(I'm taking two classes over Summer).  My last semester as an undergraduate college student, my last semester as an ambo, which is the saddest part.  This whole break I did nothing, and then I worked.  I want to live it up these last couple days.  I know the fun's not going to end, but I want to be able to hang out and have fun without haveing to think about going to class the next day.  It's also going to be pretty crazy with ambos.  I need to start organizing our spring banquet, which is a pretty big deal... I need to get a committee together to help make preparations and decide what the theme should be.  I need to organize buddies and keep track of it.  I need to organize WoLaHi.... SHIT, the semester hasn't started and this stuff is already stressing me out.  I need to go to different places around San Diego, talk to some friends with connections and what not.  Okay, no more thinkin about that until tomorrow, which is our Spring exec retreat... It's more of a 6 hour business meeting tomorrow.  I'm prepared, and I also need to run errands for spotlights.  I think this weekend, I will try to be productive during the day and get OOC with all my friend during the night.  As I see my college life coming to a close, I'm moving a hundred miles a minute, and although it will most certainly be stressful, I think it's going to be a great 16 weeks. Anyway, after I graduate, I think I'm still going to hang out with everyone.  The ambassadors are some of the best friends and I wouldn't trade them for the world.  Namely Heather, Marisa, Ben, Courtney and Tommy.  They're freakin awesome.. Just a random blog today= )"

"event","School starts in two weeks.  Therefore, people are starting to trickle back into my life, which is awesome.  Michelle got in today and we're going to hang out at the beach and go surfing tomorrow.  Tonight, my friend Blanca is having a party so I think I'll head over to her place, but I'm not sure if I'm going to drink tonight or not because last night Ryan Jason and I killed a flask of everclear.  we didn't mix, took shots, but we did chase.  That shit's lethal.  Anyway, it's been soo warm these past few days, it better not be cloudy this weekend or I'm going to kill someone.  The warm and sunny weather has made my soul hungry for the beach really bad.  I just don't want to be in this glass case of emotion, I think.  I need to use my digital camera more often.  I've got a couple of ideas for really good pictures, I just need to get off my ass and take them.  I apologize if my thoughts veer one way and then another, I think I'm getting delirious being at work this whole week.  This semester I'm taking 13.5 units, and I'm taking three science classes.  It should be good, because I truly do like science.  I find it interesting and I can cram for it really well also.  Once a procrastinator, always a procrastinator, what can you do?  THat's it for now, although I'm bored, I'm kind of being a lazy bloggerson right now..."

"event","So, this break has been pretty boring.  I know I'm complaining now, and when school starts, I'll wish life were semi-boring again.  But for now, I'm in suspended animation.  All my friends are at their parents', not down here, and my friends here, well my best friends are really no longer my best friends any more.  So I head home after a long day of work, and what do I do? Just sit down and watch TV, maybe crack open my book that I'm reading.  It's boring.  I'll have to admit, I have been cooking quite a bit lately.  I've been cooking a lot.  Healthy stuff.  I'm trying to stick to my resolution of eating healthier, and it's hard.  I just heard of this new burrito at Trujillo's(THE mexican food restaurant for drunken SDSU students), which is basically an already invented burrito, the Phi Psi, WRAPPED IN A QUESADILLA!!! yes yes, heart attack special but think about how good it would be!  oh man, and it's not good living in walking distance to LnL's.  Good thing being broke is a good excuse to look into the cabinets.  But I'm getting tired of chicken and mahi mahi and sald already.  I have not treats, not ""good"" stuff.  Blah.  So the girl that I like is gone, as in she's not in SD until school starts.  So I was text messaging her on New Years, and I said I missed her.  she was like ""no, stop.""  and then she texts that I have like two weeks to get over her(two weeks being when school starts).  Drunken me finds this very discouraging and so does sober me.  My resolution get over her.  It's not worth the effort if she's given me fucking deadline.  Ahh well, no problem getting over her... Easier said than done.  Why is she stuck in my head?  It's probably because there's nothing to keep my mind off of her, nothing to push her out of my head.  Suspended animation, like my whole world is set into a giant Jell-o mold.  Work is alright, it's just long and boring and when I get out of work it's already getting dark... at 4:30... yea.  But this weekend should jump start my Jell-o life.  Kati Dick is coming home, Phyllis Rose Bloom should be down, I'm hangin out with Sara on Saturday, I believe Ben comes down next week.  Good times are ahead.  Blogging puts you in a better mood sometimes= )"

"event","So, since my last post, I have not been able to stop thinking about what I'm going to do with my life.  It's kind of driving me a bit crazy... I really want to experience the world, that's for sure.  But, if I leave San Diego, would I be able to come back and find a job and a place to live?  Try to live outside of your comfort zone...  Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright... thanks Bob.  So yea, I've also been thinkin about relationships.  I'm sort of kind of in one, oh who am I kidding, I don't know what I'm in, but it's complicated.  I shouldn't really go into specifics, but it just sucks to have put yourself out there, and not know how the other person really truly feels.  see, I think this person likes me back, not sure, but I have tried to ask her out plenty of times, and she's quite resistant(due to the situation which is to complicated to explain). But, she likes hanging out with me, and I've told her many times straight up that I like her, and that I'll keep asking her out, and if she doesn't like me that way or is getting tired of me asking her out, that all she has to do is tell me and I'll stop.  and she hasn't said anything yet.  But I'm getting tired of this dance, I wish I could just get over it sometimes.  Do you ever meet someone and just immediately have an attraction to? Have you ever had someone who you couldn't get out of your head, and you don't know why you keep doin this to yourself, well you know that it's b/c u like this person, but you know the answer is probably always going to be no??  B/C i'm in it, up to my neck in it.  Maybe over break I'll get over her... she says I have all these options, which maybe I do, but I haven't really thought about any options.  Maybe I'm just hoping for an impossible outcome.... ooh, song lyrics!!!  ""My dreams aren't premonitions cause I'm dreamin of.... impossible, impossible outcomes
I've tried to understand, but I don't understand empty sign posts, seen through large windows""....   hmmm, kind of confusing, but it's a good song.  This whole situation takes over quite a bit, I'm just thinking all these different situations all at the same time, like I'm tryin to find an answer to this but I always come up empty handed.  I just want to be like, hey... as much as I don't want to be, I'm done with this dance that's been goin on for days, weeks, so much time. I know my steps, you know my steps and I try to follow yours, but I can't see where  your feet are going. The beat of the dance has gotten confusing and I can barely hear the music.  all I know are my steps, my steps.  I have no regrets in putting myself out there, I just wish someone would put themselves out there with me.  BLAH, so that last part is probably confusing, but hey, it's my journal!"

"event","What am I doing??? I feel that right now I'm going through a ""mid-college crisis"".  Sure, I'm excited about graduation, but I'm not really.  I've made a whole new bubble, I mean a whole new bubble.  I didn't mean to, but to make a long story short, my best friends from high school, have kind of left me, or I have left them.  It's really sad and it gets to me, but I guess when you move away, and no one else does, you start creating your own life.... Time to bring in another quote from Garden State!!  ""You'll see when you move out it just sort of happens one day one day and it's just gone. And you can never get it back. It's like you get homesick for a place that doesn't exist. I mean it's like this rite of passage, you know. You won't have this feeling again until you create a new idea of home for yourself, you know, for you kids, for the family you start, it's like a cycle or something. I miss the idea of it. Maybe that's all family really is. A group of people who miss the same imaginary place.""  Well, I have new friends, and they're great friends.  My old friends can't be replaced, mind you, they can never be replaced, and I do and will miss them, but my life is moving fast, and right now as much as I would love to, I can't, if I stop, all my momentum will be lost.  Hopefully someday they'll let me back in... Anyways, enough ranting about that.  For my whole life, I've lived in San Diego.  Sure I've travelled around the United States, visiting cousins.  I've been to the Philippines, visiting family.  But I've never just gone somewhere outside of my California life and just taken it in.  Two of my best friends, Allison and Cory, are planning on moving to Europe and teaching English in Spain...  This, sounds like a wonderful opportunity and experience, but here I am, graduating with a liberal studies degree, but I don't have my credential.  I am contemplating coming back to the credential and moving out to Spain with them for a while.  I want to travel.  I want my eyes to be opened up to more than just the beach, the sun and San Diego.  I love San Diego, I will probably come back to it, but I want to see the world, not just through the eyes of others and photographs, but through my eyes.  Just a little rant..."

"event","So this past weekend was my Parents' 25th wedding anniversary.  Saturday was when they renewed their vows and had the reception.  Before I went to the church, though, I went to school to lead the fight song for the last time... It was fun, and now my fight song leading era is over, hehe.  Anyways, I booked up home and then got dressed and we went to the church.  The service was great, and some people couldn't stop crying ie-my sis Andrea.   It was kind of funny to watch my sis uncontrollably crying.  Hey, I'm not heartless!  I just thought it looked funny.  Anyways, beautiful service, went prety much flawlessly.  We went to some hotel in National City, and we were there from 1:30 to 7.  The food was alright, but I was hungry like 2 hours after we ate.  The program was great and I got to sing ""Nandito Ako"" for my parents.  It was great, and I also got to do the toast.  So after being there for like 3 hours, I was tired already so I took a nap, and then when I woke up there was a band.  Odd, but cool.  My parents danced the whole day.  After the reception, the fam was over at my parents house.  Tina and I went to ALbertsons and got 150$ worth of alcohol, and we started the party off right.  I got my brother, my dad, Dan(cousin/best friend) and his dad Nestor to all take a double shot of Jack Daniels with me.  It was a good start, and then we had coronas and other various things the rest of the night.  Karaoke was going on al night too, it was intense.  I passed out outside on a swinging bench= )  Sunday I spent the day preparing for banquet.  I made some cookies, made a lasagne, and then paint penned my life away.  I got everything done though, which is good.  The party went really well, so people keep tellin me.  There was a lot of food, and everyone was enjoying everyone's company.  The White elephant was fun.  Someone brought a vibrator and someone else brought some adult diapers.  Those were the wierdest/funniest.  I brought a Darth Vader Mr. Potato Head.  After we cleaned up at Tommy's place after everyone left, I went home, changed and the went to my friend's house to study.  That's pretty much all I have to really report.  Hopefully something good will come up soon."

"event","So yes, if livejournal were a class, I'd probably get an F...  but nothing really exciting has happened recently that is worth telling.  Actually I lied... Two weekends ago, SDSU had their second home game for basketball, and my buddy Heather LaPerle and I decided to host a fiesta in Piedra.  We bought quite a bit of food and quite a bit of booze(coronas and a handle of Jose).  So I got over to Piedra to hang out with Ben and Joe and Jon around 130 I think, and then we went and got Mexican food, before we made more Mexican food.... yea...  Pretty good, I think the place is called mi guadalajara, it's in the same shopping center as Windmill Farms.  So after that we went to the Windmill and bought 50$ worth of groceries, including seven pounds of POLLO ASADO.  Pretty hardcore.  We went back to Piedra and started preparing and drinking.  Good times with friends. Pollo asado, spanish rice, guacamole, black beans, and all the fixins!  SO we finished a lot of beers, drank a lot of margaritas, and took a few shots, and then we headed off to the basketball game.  It was pretty fun being there a little intoxicated.  I was going all around the place, saying hi to friends and what not.  Marisa and I saw Katie from work and we hung out with her and I tried to get this guy she likes jealous, he didn't see me, ah well.  My friend Allie and her roommates peace out early b/c they were tired and wasted, I know how that goes. Sometimes I'll be hangin out next door, and we'll be hangin out in the backyard and I'll feel tired so I'll just walk to my room and pass out in my bed and they'll be like, where's anthony? then my roommate comes and sees me in my bed.  It has happened a few times already.  Anyways, after the game we went back to Heather's and we finished all the alcohol, ALL OF IT!!! it was pretty out of control.. Also, we finished all the pollo asado, which is making me want some right now.  But yea, that was Saturday Night.  Totally forgot to mention Friday night.  Friday was the ""Winter Formal"" party over at Neverland.  Neverland is where Dan, Steve, Erv, Kato, Ian and Travis live.  The call themselves the lost boys because they live right about the childcare center, like they wandered up to neverland and got lost.  HAHA... I think it's pretty clever.  Anyway, Michelle Hocking was my ""date"", and when Michelle and I hang out, it's always a fun time.  We went to Tokyo sushi for dinner and we had the Spicy tuna roll, the caterpillar roll, and another roll and they were all delicious.  We also had a few sake bombs = ).  One table was hogging all of the sake cups so we had bamboo cups that floated so we just borrowed some nice peoples' sake cups to sake bomb with.  After dinner, we went to Vons and picked up a bottle of Champagnia then got to Neverland.  It was so much fun that night, we just had an awesome time, Ben was there, so it was OOC, and we got some roookies there with us, which was even more fun.  ANother post tonight I promise, about this last weekend, but that's it for now!"

"event","So.... it has been, look at my title, since I have updated.  A lot has probably gone on, but it is all just a blur... No, not those drunken blurs, but those life is moving so fast that it's hard to stop and document it fast.  I'm reminded of Garden State, when  Largeman(Zach Braff) is in his friends house, the one that made ""a lot"" of money by selling his patent for silent velcro to the government.  Anyways, it reminds me when they're in the den and he takes the ecstasy and everyone is moving around really fast and Largeman is just sitting, moving kind of in slow motion.   Yea, that's what it's like, so I'm only going to go back to last Wednesday evening, which was at midnight, my 21st birthday...  I had a cappella practice that evening, and then at 11 Heather LaPerle picked Nick(my roomie) and I up and we met up with Michelle at Bennigan's.  We had some appetizers and then at twelve... I drank... and drank... and drank... hahaha, I ttold myself, only two, but Heather and Nick and Michelle kept them comin!  Nick said I had about 7 drinks or so.  It was a very fun evening, and I kept one of the glasses= )  My first drink was an Irish car bomb, followed by an Emerald Isle Iced Tea, then a red headed slut, then a stoplight, then some other stuff and I finished off Heather's beer.  It was fun.  Thursday I went to school, and the PSC(work) bought pizza for my birthday, which was awesome.  I'm very saddened to say that this will be my very last PSC birthday.  It's been good times in this office, and having my last PSC birthday reminds me that soon I will be out of this fine institution.  Well not really, I'll be doing my credential here hopefully.  So after lunch, I went to history class which I fell asleep in and then the girls from the class brought me to Monty's(Louie's) and we drank two pitchers of beer.  Obviously I drank more since it was my birthday and I think it is awesome when girls buy you drinks, haha.  I went to Physics a bit tipsy, and then after I went to my parent's house for dinner, and then it was off to EFFIN'S!!!  so I went to Effins and met up with Matty and Sara from work.  We had a couple of beers and then Sara bought me the three wisemen.  It wasn't so bad. I don't know why people are totally disgusted.  Anyways, people trickled in and soon there was a full bar, and I knew a lot of the people who were there, which made it a lot more fun.. A couple of drinks I remember people buying me were a surfer on acid, a jager bomb, another irish car bomb, and bunch of other shit.  So Thursday nights are when the guitar guy comes, and he was there.  Boy was he there.  I came up to the front of the bar with another girl whose birthday it was and we raced to see who could drink a vodka soda the fastest.  The loser had to get on all fours on a table and the winner got to spank them... Guess who won... yes, it was me!  So that was fun.. I also got to run across the street with my pants down at me knees anda piece of flaming toilet paper stickin out of my crack= )  There rest of the nigth was such a blur, but it was fun hangin out with everyone, and even Missy, Lara, and Genesis were there!!!  Yea, people say it's not your 21st until you throw up... It was my 21st that night in the bathroom of Effins.  The next day, I have no clue why, but I woke up at 845, and I couldn't go back to sleep for the life of me. I was so tired.  I went to school, but didn't work and then I gave a tour.  I ran errands after, bought a lot of alcohol, and then took a nap. Marisa and her roomies and cousin got to my house early and we barbecued and hung out.  I was in my toga and the party got started.  There weren't too many people there, but the company I was with was fucking fantastic.  I remember saying ""I love every single one of you motherfuckers!"" after they all sang me happy birthday.  I, along with almost everyone else there, drank massive amounts of alcohol.  It was a very fun night, and when I woke up, I was on my bed in my boxer briefs and my window was wide open and my doorknowb was not on the door... hmmmm wierd! hahaha, if you want more details I can tell ya if you ask me.  but yea... Three nights of craziness and then recouperating the rest of the weekend.  This week has been a little crazy with hw and what not, but also pretty relaxing.  Tonight is the ambo open, the annual ambassador mini golf tourney, and then I'm off to see Harry Potter 4!!!!YA YA more posts soon, I promise"

"event","So..... Today was not a bad day at all, I got up early made myself some hard boiled eggs and a piece of toast and then went to school. Good morning.  Anyway, the day has gone and passed and like I said, no real complaints.  You're probably all thinking, what is Anthony Aranico up to these days??? Well, I am very involved with ambassadors on campus, and I'm trying to organize lots of fun events, seeing that I'm the morale officer and what not... Also, the a cappella group is goin pretty well also, and Mario and I are sharing the solo for The Way You Move by Outkast.  Yea, we're switching between beatboxing and rapping b/c we're both tired of beatboxing all the time.  I've been going to the gym quite a bit, and as a matter of fact I went twice yesterday, once in the morning for Turbokick and in the evening for a meathead sesh, pure weights... Life... is good...  but I have come to realize that I don't know how to date. I've said it before but I really have no clue what to do. The thing is folks, when I'm around girls I like, I get shy... I dance around the thought of asking them out to dinner in my head, and it usually never happens... When I'm drunk is another story.  When I'm drunk, I am quite smooth, I hope to think.  I just need find a way to be drunk while being sober, hehehe.  Anyways, how does one casually date?? I think I am too nice of a guy, because when I think about going on a date with a girl one weekend and then goin on another date with another girl the next weekend, I feel bad... am I supposed to?? I dont really think so myself, but my conscience is trying to tell me otherwise.  I'm going to man up this weekend, see how it goes... ""That's why there's such mystery and aura associated with attraction and love--we literally are wired not to understand, just to act.""  Just to act, I need to remember that... I'm thinking too much... Oh yea, I'm walking in May and taking two classes over Summer and I'm done........ Bittersweet, I'll vent about it more next time.... I shall say adieu with some emo boy looking for love lyrics...

So she says
""Everyone's going to the party,
won't you come if I come
with a friend for your friend?
I'd be so pleased to see you
out of the classroom wearing the smile that I'll bring you.
I was hoping to learn a few things like..
Do you do you like dishing the dirt
on the whole class or
talking the big smack or
playing the fool or
wearing all of the latest fashions
or bucking the new trends
wearing your old threads or
if you like coffee in the evening
These are a few things that I'd like to know
that I'd like to know""

So I say...

"event","So yea, it's been almost a week since my last post... so much has gone on this past week I don't even know where to start, and I don't know if I want to go into it all...let's just say it's been out of control.  But... it's so wierd how life works with relationships. You get in them, then you get out, you want back in, you can't get back in, then roles switch.  It's happened to me before, and it's much more complicated than anyone could ever realize.  Becoming friends with someone who was once your love is hard, I don't know if it's completely possible.  In any one situation that you could have with your friends, with an ex, it's not going to be just like with friends, it's going to be a lot like how it was when you were in that relationship.  You know? that's just how it was, and it probably takes a while to change that. A long while.  Sometimes once you get what you've fought for so long, you're not so sure if you really want it.  It's like going into a battle and winning it, but you're the only one left out of thousands of people.  Was it really worth it?  Reflection, contemplation.... You know you want it, but through your own personal propaganda you have changed your mind.  It's a conscious knowledge, all of this, but when you build up a barrier as great and strong as the great wall of china, it can' just be knocked down.  Brick by brick... Maybe it's not supposed to come down.  I don't know. I'm not sure what I want right now, I think I'm trying to find it.  Maybe I don't want to go back because I don't want to hurt anyone anymore, if I go back, it has to be 100% it has to be for sure, nobody else.  But right now, after everything, I'm not sure."

"event","This weekend was super full, but super fun at the same time...  On Friday I went to Medieval Times with Tommy, Genessy, Michelle, Heather, Ben and Erica.  We had the nerdy yellow Star Trek Knight and his nerdy Trekky Squire.  He died.  It was a really good show nonetheless.  The black and white knights horse wished it was yellow so it didn' really listen to the black and white knight.  I bought an awesome pimp chalice from the place, and you'll be able to see it on my birthday if you come.  I'll be drinkin out of it for a while, then I'll need to put it away so it doesn't break.  Anyways, got home around 1 in the morning, and then had to get up at 8 to get to school at 830 for compact for success.  The Sunset Clefs were singing and we had a good time, except for the whole getting up early part.  The Ambos were two tables down from us and the silver wings weren't there, so they were basically next to us.  I belted my solo, but I kept on pitch, I think, and everyone loved our singing.  After that the clefheads(including me) went to lunch and then I went home and did homework.  I slept and did hw and slept and did hw until probably 4, then I went and hung out with Ashley, Megs, Lisa and Geoff for a little bit and then I went over to Piedra Del Sol and hung out with Heather and Ben and a bunch of other people. We got drunk, and then went to the football game.  It was a lot of fun, I'm not gonna lie.  Then Emily Ben and I walked to Islands, where we met up with everyone else who drove or took the trolley.  After we finished eating we discovered that the trolley was no longer running... uh oh.... So, all nine of us packed into Genessys Honda Civic and took side streets home.  When we got back to Piedra, we watched Saw... which is a pretty freaky movie, and after I had to bike my ass back home. I rode as fast as I could... Yesterday morning, after going to sleep around 245, I woke up at 7 and went to the Breast Cancer Walk with Kati, Lauren, Ben and Chris V.  We were the only ambos who went, but it was fun.  After the walk I introduced them to JV's off of Morena Blvd, and Chris and I had the Surf and Turf(A monstrous burrito wrapped in two tortillas it's so big and inside of it is carne asade, rice, shrimp, and guacamole).  Chris polished it off, and unfortunately, for the first time in a long while, I couldn't finish the burrito= ( Hilarity ensued after the finishing of Chris' burrito.  He had to ""clear some room"" so he went into the bathroom, and, well I guess i could explain what went on, but you just had to be there.  Nothing nasty, like Chris cloggin the toilet or anything, it was the conversation in the booth.  So when I got home, I took a nap, and studied.  I switched between the two all day, and then went to a cappella practice, and then went home, relaxed and went to sleep..  So  that was my weekend in a nutshell, kind of.  This weekend has been gloomy and still is today. I love the colder weather, but I wish the sun would come out.  It just makes me feel bleh...... and oh yea, calc test on wednesday....SHIT. and this week is homecoming and I'm probably signed up for 50% of the events... how am I going to study?!?!?! well, that which does not kill you can only make you stronger.... I guess I'll be really buff or dead by Friday"

Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.
So I took what's mine by eternal right.
Took your soul out into the night.
It may be over but it won't stop there,
I am here for you if you'd only care.
You touched my heart you touched my soul.
You changed my life and all my goals.
And love is blind and that I knew when,
My heart was blinded by you.
I've kissed your lips and held your head.
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
I know you well, I know your smell.
I've been addicted to you.

Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.

I am a dreamer but when I wake,
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.
And as you move on, remember me,
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.
I've watched you sleeping for a while.
I'd be the father of your child.
I'd spend a lifetime with you.
I know your fears and you know mine.
We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
And I love you, I swear that's true.
I cannot live without you.

Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.

And I still hold your hand in mine.
In mine when I'm asleep.
And I will bare my soul in time,
When I'm kneeling at your feet.

You have been the one for me.

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.

It kind of sucks, because once you start to relax, it's time to get up and go again.  I guess that's how it is when you're growing up.  I think the thing that's keepin me afloat is ambos. Quite a few of the ambos have grown to be what I would probably consider best friends.  It is so awesome to have those people around you at all times, you know?? Some people who I think know me the best are probably Lauren, Tommy, Michelle, Bill and Adriana...  I've been kinda down lately and I'm thinking it's because I'm stressed with one class, CALCULUS!!!!  It's like hell, I'm sitting there in class, and I'm trying to listen, and I feel like she's speaking fucking sanskrit... I understand some of it, I am good at math, but there's so much shit that I think I should've known before and the last time I took pre-cal was my senior year of high school about 3 years ago.... So, I'm tryin to keep up, but it's so hard. Life is good besides that, I've just been hangin out with friends, and relaxing as much as possible.  Countdown to my birthday, 22 days!  I'm excited, I'm going to have a pretty big event over at my house that Friday, and preparations must be made... I didn't get onto homecoming court, which is a little downer, but, I'm excited to cheer on all of my friends who have gotten onto court.  Next week is homecoming and my schedule is full of all the events I'm doing for ambos, I'm pretty hardcore, I'm not going to lie...  Anyway, life for me... ""I'm Gonna Make A Change, For Once In My Life It's Gonna Feel Real Good, Gonna Make A Difference Gonna Make It Right . . .""  So I've started with the man in the mirror already, and these next few weeks, I feel will be hard.  I'm going to try my damndest to pass that math class, call the Trujillos girl, not procrastinate, keep my room clean, eat healthy, go to the gym, strengthen my relationships with all friends a little bit more, maybe reopen some lines of communication with some people, and smile...

"event","Sooo.... what was in my last entry?? ohhhh.. okay.. so saturday afternoon I saw Elizabethtown with Lauren and the other clefheads.... Fucking awesome movie.  I feel that it was sort of a mix between Garden State and In Good Company... People ask me if it's comparable to Garden State, but I don't think you can compare the two... I feel that they are on the same level as each other, but to judge whether it was better??? it's like comparing a crunch bar to a twix and saying which one has better rice crispy things in them, or which caramel tastes better.  They each have their own good story that they bring to the table... FUCKIN AWESOME! Anyways after the movie we ate at California Pizza Kitchen and I had the Chipotle Chicken Pizza, tastiness!  After dropping off Lauren Boo, I went over to Bill's and we hung out and drank and watched Scrubs until we decided it was time for a break from the oh so glorious tv show and time to get some Trujillos.  So on our way over there, we run into Tiana and Renee, craziness!! They were way fucked up too, so we all got mexican food... at trujillos, I accidently smack my elbow into a girls chest.. I apologized profusely and we started talkin.... got the digits... I'm prolly not goin to call her, even though she's really cute.  I dunno I think it's jkind of wierd to talk to someone for like ten minutes and then get her number.  But who know,s maybe I will call her.  I think I'm just shy or nervous to.  ah well, anyways, we went back to Bill's and then went over to a party in the apartments.  It was fucking awesome... that's pretty much it for that night.  I got home around 3 but I went next door to talk to my neighbors, and she and I talked for a good forty five minutes about a bunch of different things.  went to sleep around 430, woke up at 715 to get ready and go to church and teach sunday school.. after church I went to Ikea and got tea lights for my lil hawaiian scent air freshener thing.  Okay, so maybe the most fun two and a half hours of my weekend.... I went to the homecoming nomination interview, and I was in group one... My group consisted of myself, Dennis Kramer II, Kristi Kimura, Katie Philips, Bryan Spencer, and Colleen Sweeney... Seriously the best homecoming nominee interview group ever!! we did a bunch of different team building activities and really got to know one another.  Michelle and I then proceeded to get L and L's for dinner then rush back to school for our a cappella practice.  We did really good and got some choreography goin.  After that I went to Natalie and Brookes place and I carved a barfing pumpkin, sorry I dno't have any pictures but I'm going to make another one for my house in a week or so... and just hung out... So, I had a very busy and long weekend but I had a lot of fun.  Shit that was a lot to write, and alas, no quote, but the day still has three hours in it//"

Some highlights:  Wednesday after a cappella, Michelle and I ventured to Vons while everyone else went to In-N-Out.... we had a blast, an pretty much bought everything the other bought, seriously good times, michelle and I know how to party.  Thursday night was freakin awesome as well... Went over to Cory's and we watched survivor and ate pizza and drank and played a hardcore game of trivial pursuit with his roomies and a couple of other people.  Lauren and I almost won, but Cory and Julie fuckin beat us to the center spot and had the easiest Trivial Pursuit final question in the world.... ""What does Spongebob live in???""  shit... anyways we did that then smoked hookah and watch freakin GaS for a good hour and a half or more.  What a freakin unbelievable night.  Yesterday, I worked and didn't give a tour, then I just went home and relaxed for a bit, then Lauren and I went surfing at Tourmaline.  I pretty much caught some of the best waves of MY LIFE yesterday, but the water was fucking colder than a witchs tit.  anyways, got home from that then went back to the beach for an FLC bonfire.  It was tight, we had chipotle and made a giant pyramid and played the human knot game....  So this has been my week.. I apologize to any of my dedicated viewers that I have not posted a journal entry the past couple days.   Okay, so, I bet you are thinkin, Anthony hangs out with Lauren a lot and calls her Boo.... No, we're not dating, we are very good friends.  We have a blast together and she's a chill girl.  That's pretty much all I have to say about that. She's a good friend.  My life has been kind of an emotional rollercoaster lately, and I thank anyone who has been there to listen to me and give me advice.  Now I feel that life is a lazy river, calm but fun when you're with a bunch of friends floatin on down.  It's not that I don't think about you, or miss you, it's just that ""you can't make someone your priority when you're only their option"".  So, I live... but I don't forget, I can never forget... but, once again....""Softly Now, You owe it to the world And everyone knows that you're my favourite girl But there's some things in life that are not meant to be I'm not meant for you and your not meant for me Here's to our problems And here's to our fights Here's to our achings And here's to you having a Good life""..."

"event","So after a long weekend of not really doing anything, I woke up thie morning at three in order to finish my history paper.  I don't know why I procrastinate, but my justification for doing it is that if I know it's not due for a while, I won't put out as much effort into it.  But if it is due the next day or that same day, I will put a lot of hard work into it.  Sure it's stressful, but it's how I am and how I get things done good.  Anyways, got it done and our professor said we did a good job reporting on his ""area of expertise"".  Then I went to Physics class, which was kind of boring, but I got out way early.  I went to dinner with my lil sister Andrea, and it was good. We had Applebees.  I ate riblets, she had chinese chicken salad, and we traded a little bit.  We're such good siblings.  After getting home, I decided to veg out for a little bit then I went to the gym.  I freakin ran two miles in fifteen minutes!! Burned 300 calories and then worked out my abs and chest.  My God I'm turning into a meathead, but I feel so good and healthy.  I think I'm actually going to leave this journal entry quoteless.....  OOOH! I've got one,  it's from the Elizabethtown commercial... ""Every day needs a purpose.""  I think the fun part is finding that purpose.  Once again, I plan tomorrow to strut around campus singin Jason Mraz to myself, or maybe some Dashboard.  Goodnight Moon."

Anyways, Saturday I watched Scrubs and didn't work on my paper all day, and then went to a black and white party.  I was there for a good hour and a half until the cops came... *SUCKY!* anyways, went back to the Neverland pad for a little bit and decided not to go to the other party because I was teaching Sunday school the next morning.  Church and Sunday school weren't bad at all, then after I went to the parentals house to have lunch with the pops before he leaves for the Philippines(his flight leaves sometime this afternoon from LAX, and he's meeting up with my grandma and mom overseas).  I'm supposed to sleep at my parents house for the next two weeks straight, but I doubt it's going to happen, maybe every couple days, still have to work it out with the sis... I really need to work on my Inca essay, it's due tomorrow and I've only got about 2 pages done, but it shouldn't be too bad. Maybe pull an all nighter, but it's chill.  I strive off of procrastination, it's when I can really focus on my work.  I've made a list of some CD's I plan on buying... the new Coheed and Cambria, the new Jamie Cullum, Nickel Creek's ""This Side"" and the ELizabethtown soundtrack.  I am counting on Elizabethtown to be a great movie.  I've checked out the soundtrack listing, and I have a good feeling about it, just as I did with Garden State.  It's even got a celebrity chef, PAULA DEAN, in it.  hmmm, I went a whole blog without quoting anything or using music lyrics... Must... come... up... with... GOT IT!
""So i won't hesitate no more, no more 
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate 
Our time is short
It is our fate, I'm yours""

Since the last time I made a real post, which was on Wednesday, life has been pretty good.  I do have my sad points, but then I keep think about a quote from Zach Braff... ""Take a deep breath and realize how completely insane it is that you're alive.""  Just give it a second to register.... there you go.  It's not to say that I don't think about you a lot.  Because I do, a lot.  I've found so many songs, poems, quotes, etc. etc. to keep me going through the day.  I start to miss you, but then I listen to Francis Dunnery: 
""Softly Now,

Also obtained from Scrubs= ).  Things like that.  Life is stressful, but it is good.  I finished one of the paintings I've been working on today.  Not sure if it's completely finshed, but I'm putting it up on the wall for now.  Calculus sucks, but I think I'm getting better at it.  I believe I'm going to pass.  I AM going to pass.  Anyways, tonight will be very fun. I'm goin to my ambo buddy HEATHER'S place and we're goin to have fun fun fun!!!! Lookin forward to that, but for now I'm goin to lay under my fan in my work out shorts watching Scrubs... Oh yea, SEASON 2 COMES OUT IN NOVEMBER!!!! 

PS!!! hahaha, best song to walk around campus listening to: Jason Mraz- No Stopping Us.  You're mission, to walk from class to class or to wherever you're going and just sing this song, or mouth it and walk like you mean it! I've done it, you get looks, but oh how good it makes you feel!!!!"

It was a litle bit awkward in the ambo office, but I've heard a quote recently and it goes""The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right next to them knowing you cannot have them.""  Anyways, it was good to see her, she looked awesome, happy a little bit, but in the end I was glad to see her.  So today was our big show, and I fucked up my solo... I know it was the second time doing it, but I should had known it by now.  I thought I knew it, but no.... anyways, I drowned my sorrows in a series of shots, and I'm not going to lie, I'm still feeling it a litt;e  bit..  I hope your day went well.. I'm sorry I didn't call you, I wanted to, but I didn't.  I'll work on it. and oh yea.  I brought my bike in to get a new crank and some tires and what not and it should be done within the next few days and then I'll be able to take my beach cruiser to school and have a basket to put my gym bag in.  It's hard not to think of you at all in a day, but I do think we can be friends, and as friends we can talk as much as we'd like.  There are a few thigs I'd need to keep hush hush but I would like to play Cyrano for a while.  Anyways, wished I could talk to you today, but ah well.. I'll hopefully get to speak with you tomorrow, my only fear is that I'll give away all I'd have to talk to you away in my blog.  Goodnight and farewell.. as my signature move, I'm ending with a quote... ""Still a little bit of your song in my ear Still a little bit of your words I long to hear You step a little closer TO ME So close that I can't see what's going on.."" nothin like a little Damien Rice Night Cap....

I don't know what I'm doing, but it sure is taking a lot of time up where I could be doing more of my hw.  But all the stress today made me realize that when you fall in love with someone, you gain a best friend, a confidant, someone you tell everything to.  And when you lose that person, you lose all of those things.  Now I don't really have anyone to really talk to.  It makes me a little sad, but I have to get through this.  God, never take love for granted.  I have no one to really vent to, no one to just lay with and be stressed with, and it's all my fault... I thought I was done with this, I mean, I woke up today happy and I was like this is going to be a good day, but it's hard going through tough times without someone.  I wish I had someone I could talk to, I mean I do have friends and everything, but no one I would like to talk to as much as her... ""until I'm 100""  Anyway, I think it's time for a nap, and then homework!= (  Peace out."

"event","Bob Marley is the man, I listened to his song and it made me happier.  Anyways, I woke up this morning tired as hell, but I wasn't sad.  I was, okay.  I didn't want to go to work b/c I was so tired but I did anyways.  I've got a calculus test tomorrow that I'm really loathing, and I don't want to fail the class, so I'm going to buckle down and do all of the hw prolems in the book and rewrite all of my notes tonight.  The day went by pretty quickly, but there has been a strom cloud above my head the whole day.  It really does feel like I'm back to square one.  and I felt bad today at meeting because somebody wrote an apple to me that said stay positive.... I think it was Heather, I didn't see the apple because three of us were screening them, but I would have taken it out to avoid any awkwardness.  You're probably thinking that I'm goin off telling everyone what's going on, but I'm not.  I have probably only really talked to Heather, Courtney, and Lauren Merritt a lil bit.  People can see it in my face, in my body language, it's hard to hide it, but I think I have been doing a pretty good job lately.  Usually if people are like, what's wrong? I can just tell them that I'm tired and haven't gotten much sleep.  Anyway, last time it took me a week to get to where I was before and that was with the help of a lot a lot a lot of alcohol.  Not this time, I don't want to avoid this, and I don't want to be driven to drink.  Cold turkey and keeping busy it is... Maybe I will do good on my test tomorrow= )...  I will of course write in my journal, write poems no matter how good or bad they are because they are basically ways of getting everything off of my chest, and it makes me feel so much better......  I wish... there were a lot of I wishes last night and it made me run through so many scenarios in my head.  What if I had just dealt with the heat and held her in my arms.  What if I had said she was beautiful a little bit more? What if I took her on midnight drives to nowhere whenever she asked me too.. No, I was selfish.  I wish I hadn't been.  ""I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one kiss from her mouth, one touch of her hand, than eternity without it. One."" I guess in my situation I would rather have one more... In the end, it's nobody's fault but my own, I wanted this, I initiated the break up.  Maybe that's why it's so bad.  I could have prevented this.  But Adriana's right, we need this. This whole thing has shown me what I do need to do. How I need to act, how I need to express myself.  I wish I could verbally express myself as well I can when typing into this blog.  I wish I could have conversations with you about this right now.  I'm taking your advice and I'm honing this skill.  I am going to work on verbal relationships, telling people how I feel as opposed to writing it down, or keeping it in.  hehehe, in certain aspects right now, I feel like I'm in some abstract way living out The Notebook.  I was the one who initiated it, and now I can't do anything but write a blog explaining how I feel, what I feel... I think I can write in this blog for 365 days straight.  I know you read this, and I think that it's a reason that I feel better after doing this.  Because you know how I feel...."

"event","so Adriana got extremely upset with me last night. It doesn't even matter over what, but the thing is she got very mad, and said she didn't want to see or talk to me ever again, she said she hated me.  She woke me up from passing out and I was still drunk as fuck but I couldn't leave it like that.  So I kept on calling her, trying to fix things, and eventually it was ok.  But after that, I felt that everything I thought I was over, all of the progress I made was all gone.  Trying to get her to just even talk to me  brought back all of the emotions from when were together, and what I went through when we broke up.  I don't know what to do now, I know that she's got Kevin and that's what she wants.  I'm here trying to deal with it alone.  There's a constant battle between my head and my heart, but the heart always wins.  Just for one second I want my head to win, so I could not feel like this.  I had something great and I let it go, and as it left I tried to get it back, but it was just out of my reach, like when you're a kid and you lose a balloon, and it floats ever so slowly out of your reach...  If you're reading this and you remember talking last night, yes, until I'm 80, 90, 100, I will...  ""Ask me why I keep on loving you when it's clear that you don't feel the same way for me... the problem is that as much as I can't force you to love me, I can't force myself to stop loving you""  To love is one of the.... no... To love is the single most important thing in life.  Don't let anything stop it, because it's unstoppable.  Don't try to hide it, because it will find a way to peek out.  If I do not accomplish anything else in my life, I can say that I have loved, and loved truly, and I know that I have because of what I'm going through now.  I'm going to have a good dream tonight, and I'll wake up happy... happy"

I'm a slave to the power.
It's calling you know
It's trying to entice

just take my advice.
It will take you over 
It will fog your mind
Save yourself now

You know you want to try it
There's a want for a taste
But when you finally get it
You'll be layed to waste
Oh sweet poison
I want a lethal dose
but I know that what I want 
is what I can't have the most.

Gosh, I know it's pretty freakin cheese, but I was bored and had some leftover emotion from last night that I had to get out..."

"event","I'm not very good in the dating area.  I've only had two real girlfriends in my life; Camille, my high school sweetheart, and Adriana, who for right now I will consider her as what could be, when I'm telling stories to my grandkids as my college sweetheart.  With both of them, I never really ""dated"" them so to speak.  With Camille, we hung out a lot during swim, which is where we met and I think we did one or two things together and then I was gone for a week because I was a counselor for Easter camp.  I wrote her a letter that she didn't receive for probabbly over a month, but the day I got back from camp there was a swim meet, and I asked her to be my girlfriend there.  With Adriana, we hung out like twice, and I actually went up to hang out in her hometown one weekend and then we went out on a date that next weekend before Wolahi, we went to Bucca di Beppo downtown, and she became my girlfriend that night..... End Flashback sequence.  Anyway, I think this time around I would like to hang out with the next girl I meet for a while, maybe before we even start talking, or talk for a while before we start dating.  Like I said, I'm not experienced in this field, so I don't really even know the difference between any of these is, but the point is I think I will take my time in getting to know the person, take it slow.  I will have two great relationships to compare whoever I start dating next, so we'll see how it goes.  On the other hand, should I just start dating around? Not like a manwhore, really, just getting to know them, maybe finding what personalities I really do like or not like, u know...  I just don't want to rush into it, anyways, that's my blurb for now"

Anyways, I woke up and I was like, YEA RIGHT! hahaha, anyways after such a surprising dream you'd think I'd be sad, right?? Oddly I woke up with a skip in my step, ready to seize the day.  So today's plans are- work, fail my calc test, work some more, ambo stuff, work till 6 and then going to sushi with Lauren Merritt.  Lauren is soo awesome, she's been there for me time and time again and now that Adriana and I are not together, I can hang out with her more.  Another person who saves me from myself is my neighbor Monica.  Whenever she is home I can go over and interrupt ALMOST whatever she is doing and she will cheer me up or be sad with me.  This past weekend I hung out with the neighbors on Friday and we had quite a good time, I don't really remember the part where I go home to my bed and pass out though.. Saturday I was supposed to go to the football game with my lib studs friends, but some of them got into a fender bender so Tiffani and I decided to stay in and get drunk with her roomies.  It was awesome, we went to the jacuzzi, and hookah'd and played scene it.  Anyways, I am keeping busy trying to fill my evenings with hangin out with friends and trying to keep up with school, the only class that's killing me is calc.  Anyways, I'm off to seize the day."

"event","So I broke up with my girlfriend on Monday. There were a lot of things that led me to it, but I'm not going into it.  The point is, when we broke up I regretted it.   You never realize how much you love that person till they're gone.  It's been almost a week now, and today I find out that she has already started dating someone else.  My heart feels irregular.  Numbness has taken over my whole body.  I feel like my heart is trying to explode, but it's not and I would rather have it explode than to have this feeling.  I've slept all day and have had nothing but a slice of pizza today.  But enought of my pity party, because as much as this hurts and as much as I don't want to do anything at all(the reason I slept all day), I am in my last year of college and I need to get up, get moving, and get over it.  Tomorrow is a brand new day, full of excitement and who knows what the world has in store for me.  I have a broken heart and now there is nothing left of me to break.  Bring it on world!  hehe... I just read what I typed.  It's easy for me to type this right now, but when it comes down to it, I really do hope I follow through with what I think I need to do.  I want to find a girl who is down to earth and who is still finding what she wants out of life.  I want her to push me to the limit and make me find things I didn't know about myself.  I want to love again.  I want to bandage my heart and I want to give my bandaged heart out.  I want a girl who wants to have fun, but also likes to stay in.  I want a girl who likes sushi, surfing(I can teach her to surf), listening to music, who I can have a deep connection with.  I'm not big on talking, but I imagine I could lay with someone for hours and look into her eyes and we'd understand something that nobody in the world does.  I want to be able to express myself through words, but if I couldn't I would just want her to be there for me.  I want to live life, get pierced, get tattooed, dance till my feet won't let me, stay awake while she falls asleep in my arms.  ""I want something else to get me through this, semi-charmed kind of life.""  I'm going to wake up tomorrow morning and I'm going to live.........."

I workd out there and then came home and cleaned up some more.  After that I decided to go to the Joan Kroc Center and swim some laps and practice my dives.  Sorry ladies, no speedo this time.  When I got home I tok a nap and then I went to dinner with Shannon and Michala.  Bennigans is the Shiznit, I must say! After that we went back to my house where we had some pina coladas(ladies choice) and Michala fell asleep.  The girls decided to head home early and I dropped them off and went to Dan's house for Rachelle's 21st B-day Chill Session.  I proceeded to pass out in the family room, not from libation but from being tired.  The next day I woke up at 5 and left Dan's house, went home and fell asleep in my bed and woke up again at 10.  I went to Onami, the seafood buffet for lunch with SHannon and Michala and then walked around the mall until they decided to leave.  = ) = )...  So yea, I went back home and I met Nick's mom and Nick, Nick's mom, Karanne, Katie and I went to Corvette Diner for Nick's ""birthday dinner with his mom""  His birthday is actually today. We then played cranium.  Monday I went to work and then took a nap and then went to Journey(Young Adult Bible Study, but also unforgettably awesome band).  Yesterday I went to work again and then I went home and me and Nick and Karanne went to CHili's for dinner and then to Fry's to get a router and I bought a new power supply for my computer= ) and Nick bought the Megaman Anniversary Collection = )... We proceeded to watch the close loss to the Giants and then went home and set up my internet!!! and played Megaman until 2 in the morning.  Today I'm goin to the baseball game with Nick and the pals and tomorrow is BEACH DAY!!!! NO WORK BABY!"

SO yea, I was bored...
Yesterday I moved into my house with the help of Dan Derrick and Vince.  It's sooo nice, but it gets really hot.  From my patio you can see everything, I mean Tijuana, the Coronado bridge, 32nd street, and even seaworld.  Nick and Josh still have a  lot of crap to move, I guess.  We don't have cable or internet until friday but I'm getting a lot of fun reading done.  Yea, this weekend should be fun, provided that someone is coming down.... Until then, I bid you adieu"

"event","QUITE POSSIBLY OUR HOUSE... Our refers to myself, my friend Nick and my friend Josh!!!  We're scheduled to sign the lease on the house on the 20th and I am quite excited.  So yea, our landlord is pretty chill. He's an old surfer construction guy who helped start what is now Turner downhill, the racing skateboard company.  But geez, I'm so excited.  ANyways, fourth of July weekend was fun.  Friday night was barbecue night at CHristine's. We cooked burgers and italian sausage(thanks vince!) and hung out around the bonfire.  After that we went to ""the bench"" and just sat there for a while starin at the night sky.  Then as I realized I was turning twenty and my days of teenagedom will be over, I thought it would be good to do some stupid stuff while I can say, ""Hey, I was just a dumb teenager!"".  SO I grab my longboard out of my car, and go halfway down the hill sitting on my longboard at 11 at night.  I only went halfway because my trucks were too loose and I kept wobbling and I didn't want to crash.  Also, Vince was following me in my car, so that wouldn't have been good.  Saturday I went to the Del Mar Fair with Cory Allison and Steve.  It was fun, we just went to all the boooths, I must say, the sushi maker was the best one.  Then we ran into Paige and Ryan Parker and we all mobbed around for a bit.  I got to milk a cow!!!! and I have a pin because I did= ).   After the Del Mar Fair Steve and I went to an 80's party and hung out with a bunch of 02 VHS kids, which was a blast.  Good seein everyone, we only chilled for and hour and then we went back to COry's house and ummm chilled again.  Sunday I went to church and then to my grandma's house for her 71st birthday.  I hung out therre and played with all of my little cousins who tired me out and then I left and met Jason and Chad at Edward's and we saw SPiderman 2.  Spiderman 2 is a great movie.  Monday night I went to the Waking Ashland concert, and I had a blast.  The one downer of the night was that Watashi wa freakin cancelled!!!! grrrr So yea, halfway through the week and 12 days till we sign our lease!"

"event","So yesterday I had a day off, so I woke up at 8:45, which is late for me and I just sat around for a little bit and then went to La Jolla for the day.  It was a nice day, sometimes it was cloudy but for the most part it was good.  Darin and I were craving California burritos so I went and got us some in PB and I came to the realization that La Jolla Shores needs a good Mexican Restaurant.... Not Chipotle or any crap like that, I mean a Sarita's or a Sombrero's.  So at the beach I worked on my tan..haha, did gymnastics, took a nap, and just hung out.  I went home and crashed for two hours and then watched tv and played video games until 230.  Right now I'm at work and after I'm goin to go home and play video games and I dunno what else"

It's Tuesday Tie Day at work! This is fun.  I'm all spiffed up and everything.  I'm goin to the gym after work and then maybe goin to the Yogurt Mill with Christine and Enzo.  

So yea, recently I've been watching every single dvd in my collection, and I've bought two new video games and two books.  They keep me busy(well not tooo much) so that's pretty cool.  I was fully tempted to buy an XBox, but I decided that I should wait till next month when I get a full time paycheck= ).  I think I might go to the Del Mar Fair this weekend with Cory and Allison and some other people, it should be fun and I didn't go last year and I think I've forgotten what it was like.  

and once again... maybe I need some trouble."

"event","Disneyland.... WAS AWESOME. I had so much fun with Shannon Arnido and Tina.  We went on almost all the rides that were available and it was a long day, especially since I woke up at three in the morning.  23 hours without sleep, WOO! In the end it was all worth it because I had such a fun time. Thanks guys.  I'm angry because Tina didn't wake me up before she left for Mississippi and I couldn't say bye.  I'm so tired right now I could fall asleep.  ummm.... today I'm goin to the gym and then goin to sleep and then hangin out with Dan, I think."

Saturday I went to SDSU @ 730 in the morning to help out with dual admission orientation and then I looked at houses, hopefully one of which we'll be moving into next week or so... Then I went and took a nap at home.  Later that day I went with my brother to pick up Tina, then we came home and ate and they went out to the bars while I stayed at home and watched tv and worked on my computer and played guitar.  Then I had a pretty good conversation with a friend and then went to sleep.  Ideal, eh?

"event","I woke up to the rain pelting my window, but with the strength of determination in my heart. I was determined that a little rain would not stop me from participating in a AIDS Walk. 
<p>
The event kicked off with an early registration, live bands, GLBT organizations promoting other activism events, safe sex information, AIDS quilt displays and food. Needless to say I now have a complete selection of assorted flavored dental dams, condoms, posters, and new events I intend to participate in. Infact, I look forward to helping with an <a href=""http://www.aidschristmasproject.org"">AIDS Christmas Project</a>. 
<p>
This is the first time I have participated in such a event and it feels so good! I not only raised money, but left my mark upon the 2002 AIDS quilt and helped all those living with this tragic disease. The positive feeling of participating in such activism issues is a natural high that all should partake in.

"event","I recently took a much needed vacation to the Pittsburgh area. Well, the trip was quite interesting. However, the motel made shacks look nice as it had no working phones in any of the rooms! A friend of my mum's had setup the arrangements for where to stay and failed to investigate the motel before we arrived. So, needless to say I went through not only internet withdrawal, but complete phone withdrawal too. I know I am on vacation and it is more important to see and do things there, which I did. I ventured out and explored some of the things that interested me leaving mum with her friends. This little exploration of mine took me to: thrift stores, where I picked up some kick ass camo pants & skater tees, a party store that has every halloween costume you can imagen, and a head shop where I snagged up a ""Freak"" sticker for my chevy s10."

"event","I had not done an update in along time so, I thought it was time that I conveyed what has been happening with me. I have been away from journaling for sometime due to I became caught up in life....well, more so in someone else. I lost focus from my own needs to a degree although not as much as I used to. The old me wrapped my world around another woman's soul and forgot my own. However, I have only recently learned of freedom from unhealthy shame and setting self boundaries in life. So, for the first time I set boundaries towards a woman to respect me and what I needed. It is all part of the learning process for me and relates back to the previous issues I have discussed here. 
I thought when I started this journal it would be a combination of a blogger and diaryland journal, but I feel now it is best to just start with where I am currently. The background information has been provided from the blogger journal anyways.
My focus currently is to return to college. I intend to study Web and Interactive Design which basically comes down to opening the doors for such jobs as: Animation and 3D Modeling, Web Designer, MultiMedia Specialist. I have loved working with computers since I first layed my hands on one. Infact, it opened a whole new world of doors for me beyond just cyber ..wink.. Seriously, though I found my path so, to speak via computers before that I only knew I wanted/needed a career that allowed creativity. Anyways speaking of creating I need to do some code for my web site...yes, I know such a *geekboi*

"event","The mental abuse I endured happened on a daily basis throughout Jr. High and most of High School based on my appearances not assumptions regarding my sexuality. This was because back then it was not so common to hear of gay bashing and my appearance was simply that of a ""geek"" to the rich kids.

The following recounts a incident from back then:
So, here I was in a all new environment my sexuality in total denial. My focus now being to fit in by changing my appearance as I craved acceptance. Hell, I was in my teens and did not know that inner beauty and the development of that is what really matters. However, daily I was reminded that all that matters in the world of Jr. High is outward appearances. I feel that even though that was years ago that attitude has not changed much. 
The number one person to remind me of how I did not fit was Chris. He was a football jock who found his joy in tormenting you in front of his friends, but when he was alone was a totally different person to the point of actually being polite. I remember one day he slammed my desk with his fist and exclaimed some insult. I could not find my voice or any courage not because I did not want to, but because of my inner fears from my upbringing. 
My father is schizophrenic, but for years was misdiagnosed as a manic depressive and I grew up learning the wrong way to cope with anger. My father would throw things and yell, cuss whenever his temper consumed him. The result for me was that while I was never physically abused I responded with the same emotional and physical response of one has been abused. I hid in my room and became very, quite escaping through doing my artwork, listening to the radio, or reading a good fantasy novel. (Note: not that flowery romance stuff either, but dragons, magic and such). So, from this home life my conditioned response was to shut off when Chris slammed my desk. Yet, there was one who did have courage. Yes, like Legg's in FoxFire she stood up to him and defended me. Her name was Carla and she got up and looked him right into the eyes and informed him to shut up and sit down. Then she looked at me and told me he would not hit me and not to let him talk to me like that. That was easier said then done, but he never ever slammed my desk again or made any reference of physical harm to wards me from then on out."

"event","The following re-counts my first crush and realizations of my sexual orientation.

Within grade school I knew that my attraction was to girls and that I saw the boys as my competition. 

I remember my first crush. 
She had long, golden hair and sparkling eyes.
Her boyfriend....evil Kevin....made her cry, but I was there to comfort her. Like a knight in shinning armour I would be there to protect her. I could feel my heart race as she clutched to me sobbing and broken. I would protect her and care for her now. Yes, I was a caretaker true and true even then. 

I knew many things about myself within grade school. That my dream was to be an artist & love a women deeper then was acceptable in society. However, I did not have the availability of computers, support groups in my school and pride marches to help guide me in my sexuality. I had the fear of the wrath of God installed within me from the Catholic upbringing. I was what I prayed repeatedly that I was not. I remember saying it over and over: ""God, do not let me be a homosexual."" The only comfort for me were those prayers. So, my tears were shed in the darkness of my room while pleading to God. 
Then within Junior High I became exposed to rejection based only upon appearances. No, it was not because back then that I looked like the stereotypical ""dyke"". Infact, back then I do not even remember hearing that term ever. It was because I simply was a ""geek"" to the rich kids. I was skinny, wore glasses, and did not have my hair in a style that resembled all the rich girls which I was not. This was the first time that my fears were brought forward into reality, but now they were not due to what I thought, but for a reason I had never considered. I did not have the skills to realize that this rejection was based upon their addictions, insecurities, and environment and had little to nothing to do with who I really am as a person. It as taken me years to come to terms with their daily mental abuse and realize that statement."

"event","The following entries continue the story of my childhood & was originally posted within my old Blogger journal.

From Wednesday, August 22, 2001  

The doctor informed my mother she was going to have a boy based on my heartbeat.


I certainly never did act like a girl. I remember numerous times hearing the words: ""You have a cute boy"" as I peered out beneath my baseball cap. I remember fondly setting that cap aside to put on my football helmet. I was the star quarter back of the world because of that helmet! The solid white of the helmet shattered by two red stripes. The seasons would pass and my football career showed in grass stains and scratches along side the stripes. 


Oh, and then in the off season I would put on my cowboy hat, boots and pistols. Yes, off to rescue the dames from the evil bank robbers. The life of a tomboy is never dull you know.

From Thursday, September 06, 2001 

I remember growing up playing with my Tonka trucks pretending I was doing an intense excavation job. This world shattered by the shouts of one neighborhood boy screaming: ""Tomboy, your just a tomboy!"" I protested because I was still in my formative years, of course, and these words marked me as not fitting. I packed up my trucks and quickly headed inside to the security of my room. 

I have grown alot since then. The security I sought within my room that day is now within me. So, you can scream at me and call me: dyke, queer, lez, etc. because now I know where the insecurity really resides.

However, at the time that I wrote that I did not fully understand that my insecurities and self-shame did still hold me as prisoner."

"event","The following entry was orginally posted within my old Blogger journal on Thursday, August 2, 2001. This is where I wish to begin the journey of this journal because this starts the tale of my childhood & discovery of my identity.

I came out about my lifestyle 15 years ago. I have been more then fortunate to have/had the support and understanding of my mother, friends and even some co-workers during these many years. After so long I started to feel that the battles within myself about my lifestyle were over, but that was far from true. 
I began to grasp how even in the homosexual world things were/are still geared more toward males. That you still had to dress and act certain ways to be labeled butch or femme. I despised stepping out of that closet only to be greeted again by you do not fit. You are not butch. You are not femme. Why? Who made up these classifications? I have worn make-up and business suits to binding & packing, wearing boxers, and becoming buff. I incorpertate both as I am both. I truely feel it is what is on the inside. If one wants to explore within the masculine side then it is individual how one goes about it. The same goes for the femmine side. 

However, since that entry I am accepted as butch more then any other label. Yes, now I face interesting situations within chat such as being banned because they think my picture on my profile is male or just ignored by others. Plus, when somone decides to attempt an insult upon my character it is generally the following statement: ""Are you male or female?"" I just smile to myself and respond: ""Thank you for the compliment."" Then watch as their whole insult falls apart and lean back in my chair and grin from ear to ear like the Chesire cat.

However, this all shows me even within the day and age of drag kings, FTM, boi, queer culture becoming more predominate we still have alot of growing to do."

"event","This journal well be a combination of two other journals & then continue from there. The reason for this is because I reached a point in my life where I realized the two were actually very, inter-connected. You will see as the tale unfolds that one deals with my issues of growing up Catholic, embracing my dyke side & facing the constant abuse of peers. Yet, retaining a sense of humor and then turning again to face judgement within the lifestyle as I tried to fit either the femme or butch identities. Now, I find that it is best to describe myself as a mesh of: queerboi, butch, andro, fag. 

So, this all connects with my other journal as I uncovered the actual pain & trauma that was buried inside of my heart & soul stemmed from the childhood abuse by my peers. The world of self-shame & co-dependency was my prison. So, I will weave the two together and then continue on with this journal on my current tales of life, fun, etc."

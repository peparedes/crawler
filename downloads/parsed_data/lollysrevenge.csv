Well, I investigated linking and we'll see if I can start doing that in the future. Anyhoo... been catching up on the journals of friends. I still have some comments that I need to respond to on my other blog. They are all weighty and theological though and I just haven't felt in the mood (frankly for a really long time). I'm worried about work today. Reverand Red has been in such a bad mood--since before I went out of town--and I just haven't felt like talking to or seeing him. But we all have to face the music someday, even we don't know what tune they are playinig, or where the instruments are coming from... does that analogy make sense? Any way Teddy Bear should be back in Australia now. He said that he would call me today. It'll be nice to see if he made it home safely. I just wish that I was anywhere but here. I'd really hoped that when I came back people would be in better moods than when I left, but since they are in worse moods... I'll just have to deal. Hmm.. breakfast. Food. I think I'd better turn my thoughts to chow now. Now chows down the brown cow."

"event","Short Ode to a Screwball Women

On sullen nights like these
why my spirit counts its woes like pearls on a string, 
you bring me armfuls of spare pantsuits
and clear-eyed hints about the woman 
who might kick up her heels in them, flooding rooms
with cunning, air, an almost gaudy vitality.

Gaudy but sober: when your wayward husband
courted the heiress, you stromed her gates
disguised as a floozy--and asked the butler
to serve you ginger ale. It was life
you'd rather be drunk on, roaring life
that told you there is not time for spirits
of dark suitcases, only lightening ruses
that not only leave no bruises but give
all parties their wish: rinsed vision and second chances. 

Losing a boot heel and giddily claiming
I was born on the side of a hill is easy.
For every such moment there are ten 
when my ideal snags midflight, a bag caught in branches.
But a girl can dream, can realize, high
on heroines, that she is mortal
and therefore fearless; that sanity
supplises the ground bass to the wildest singing;
that breezes made visible make the finest winds.

I guess even in our post-modern era it ties us to our roots and lets us know where we come from. It's also a place to get a lot of fried food. Aside from that thought I'm also getting prepared to head out West (I'm leaving this Friday). Big and scary! My mom is coming on Thursday night to help me drive and so she can see my new home. Last night I could hardly sleep I was thinking of how much I'm going to miss my home (here) and miss Teddy and my friends."

"event","Oy! I haven't been able to LJ for a while as well, it's been too hot in the room with the computer! I know that sounds like a whimpy excuse, but it's really hot! This weekend Teddy and I were lamenting the heat and decided in a half-cocked moment of heat demented drunkeness to drive 4 hours out of the city to escape the heat which we did on Sunday and it was beautiful. We chose for our one day vacation spot a little state park with a lovely little historical site situated around a lake that enabled us to have a cool breeze and a place to dip our toozies. Leaving at an un-godly hour we were able to get there about 10 am so that we could take in the day at full throttle. After touring the museum we went out and explored the park and the lake area where we spent most of the day laying on a secluded beach soaking up the non-evil sun and cool wind. It was utterly joyeous and fantastic! After a nice hike we came back into town where we had a hearty dinner before we took the drive back home again. When we got back into the city it wasn't as hot as it had been so I chose to spend the night over at Teddy's house (we haven't been able to get in much cuddling 'cuz-o-the-heat) and then I slept in the next morn while he borrowed my car and went to work (something is wrong with his, which is sad). Basically we drove 8 hours to get out of the city for 8 hours, but it was worth it and all good."

"event","What makes me and Teddy Bear work so well, so far is that we have been able to build a strong foundation of trust. From the very beginning he was able to share with me some very shameful secrets he was holding things that his ex-wife had criticized him for, and that religiously he had been made to feel guilty about and seek repentence. However, my response has been one of non-judgemental acceptance and even a little understanding. This has also opened the door to me sharing with him some of my own secrets things that I never thought that I would tell anyone. While it's trus that I've shared my childhood sexual abuse here pretty blatently and explicitly (but not too explicitly) it's only one of the many family secrets that I bare that have been eating away at me that create problems for me as I seek to find a place to live an honest life as the one God created. 

One of the most minor but greatest lies of these that I have told (emphasis upon me because this is based on my own weakness) is the lie that my parents were married. Anymore people couple they have children and it's no big deal so why should I carry shame that my story is the same as thousands of other children? Because when I was born this was not the case just yet, I was ""new wave"" you might say. And as my mother had conviently taken her ex-boyfriend's name (and my father's name) for me and her it was just easier for me to tell people that they were married but now divorced. Even then I remember in the eyes of school administrators who little they believed this. And yet while I knew that my statements were being met with sceptism it tended to push me further into the lie and (eventually the promise) that my father and my mother were married lawfully and that I was not a mistake a blip, a bastard, but a fully fledged and begotton child through the normal and respected means and channels... whatever those were. In the end it couldn't be the farthest from the truth and I was actually born at the state hospital in the ward for unwed mothers but my mom said it was there she met a bunch of incredibly strong women and become encouraged that this was something that she could do and wanted to do alone rather than with the interference of her abusive exboyfriend and my father (who was by then in jail for a check fraud). 

I was recently able to share this lie with Teddy as the first time that I was airing the truth and it was such a freedom. That said, I still have to carry the lie at school with my classmates as their are only a few things that they can handle about me at any given time (if I changed my hair color it would take them a week to adjust), but it was so cathartic to self and ultimately a gift to my relationship with him to be able to trust him with this bit of shame and know that he wasn't going to shame me back but instead give me a placec where I could feel safe as God made me."

"event","Today I went over to Teddy Bear's house at about 3:20 pm as (I was going to bring him this shelf that I had but it broke before I went over) and didn't leave until about 10:20 pm, a full 7 hours later! It was utterly fantastic and glorious! As the strain of living with L has been a bit hard on me and Teddy (we don't often get to see each other alone and when we do it's with the fear that we shouldn't leave her alone for too long), I think knowing that tomorrow L and I are moving out sort of freed us to cut loose, throw caution to the wind and relax which we really needed. I think living with L has been frustrating for me and Teddy on two fronts a.) as I said we can't often be alone without the feeling of resentment by L as well as the fear that if we leave her alone for too long she might flip out; and b.) when we are alone she dominants so much of the conversation. Frankly, when I'm hanging out with my boyfriend I don't want my crazy friend to be the topic of conversation 85% of the time, but it's hard to not have that be the case. However, today Teddy and I layed around, cuddled, went to the pub for some hard lemonaid and ""hot-chips"" walked to the grocery store and watched some favorite TV (as well as some really embaressing British TV called 3 Non-Blondes) and I would say L only dominated 40% of the conversation... a good reduction, considering. 

Teddy and I were able to talk about my move out West and other things that needed to be discussed, which is something that one needs to do with thier boyfriend once and ahile... once again necessitating time alone. In then end it really helped us (or at least me) to feel like we're boyfriend and girlfriend again and not just friends as we haven't been able to be much more than friends lately, which has been frustrating to say the least...

"event","I wasn't sure what picture to put for while it is true I feel hopeful, I also just threw up in the toilet so it's clear that I don't feel well either. The barium that I drank yesterday and the resulting two shots of milk of magnesium are doing a doozy on my system; one which has been sensitive ever since I picked up an ameba in Guatemala. So while I feel hopeful about my future, I am feeling a bit under the weather. But it is my feeling sick that has me up at this hour anyway and that which prompted me to turn on the computer and start typing. 

As the summer winds down L and I are just about to move out of the aparment that we sublet together, the summer that will forever go down in histsory as the worlds greatest debacle. L and I are a lot like that movie Beaches. While she's not quite the sweet manored brunette who is overshadowed by my working class Bette Midler we do come from different worlds and have generally different ethics. Even our Christian faith is radically different even greater than our mere denominational differences but rather our theological focus on God and God's intention for human kind. L feels that she's been screwed over on every thing in life and that I've gotten everything handed to me and yet that which is given to me (according to her) are things she hates and would never want. She despises my working class side, she goes into depressive spasms at the thought of having to talk to a trully working person and generally blames me for the mistake that I made of finding us an apartment in a working class neighborhood verses the neighborhood that I used to live in which was very upper-middle-class-white-liberal and exclusive (funny how that works). 

L has become over the years one of the meanest people I know. Today in the car she said twice in front of Teddy Bear ""Don't you understand that I get to make fun of you, but you don't get to make fun of me."" Which is so utterly true. She gets to ""build up her self esteem"" off my back while I'm supposed to take it and then I'm supposed to smile and make light banter about what a goof I am... and amazingly I can't take that anymore. The rules have got to change or I'm out the door. We all had to stop at the store (embaressingly enough to buy my milk of magnesesium) and I was getting so frustrated being around her that I started making some very mildly biting jokes about things that I can't even remember and immediately it made me feel aweful. I don't believe in humor where you attack people even when it's ""okay"" so much of it acutally hurts. Or rather in this humor there are rules and safety nets that have to be observed so tightly that only a very rare few can make those jokes and they must be made sparingly and then they are funny. However L gives a running commentary about how aweful everything is, how pathetic I am, how nasty the women on the magazines look how nasty the teenagers in their low cut tops look, how anorexic everone looks... you get the point... for me it's a running commentary of anger. She's so angery that she can't contain it one moment. It's palpable.

But tomorrow she's leaving. I have no money. I'm not sure how to get back to my home unless my mom can wire me some but in the end I don't care because after tomorrow with no food, a half a tank of gas I'm free from this negativity that has been all around me this summer. Even my kitty cat is cuddling up at my feet tonight for the joy of it. Sorry to blab on about this... as this is part of the problem and I will work on weeing myself off of complaining about L or trying to explain her as that is her and I need to focus on me... but soon she will be so far away that this will be much, much easier to do. Hope is here and it is something that I can hold on to."

"event","Tonight L and I went to see the movie the Secret Lives of Dentists despite my continual ickyness (I was required to drink a quart of barium today at the hospital and that stuff does not move easily through the system). While shifting in my seat often L and I watched as this family's life unfolded and unraveled ala ""American Beauty"" but without the murder. Just as in AM there was the emmasculated male who did most of the work at home, took care of the kids and the career driven wife who was having an affair. It was a both times disturbing and riotously funny as the films ""hook"" was to bring in this fictional character who would interact with the husband urgering him on and driving him to the brink. It was an interesting and disturbing film. Worth a rental, but not worth full price. And if any of my dear readers are in marital troubles yourself I would suggest avoiding it lest you be prepared for the inevitable discussion that will insue.   

As we were leaving the theater I was struck by what L said as she claimed that no one she knew ""had that kind of marriage"" when I can see it in my dentist's office or at my doctor's office every day. I don't think it exists in the lives of those I'm closest too, mainly because I think that my set of friends lead healthier lives, lives centeredd on faith and Christ, love, the church, serving God and the community and serving one another. When one's morals are shaped in this direction than it makes sense that they aren't going to suffer from the same sort of vacuous strip mall rage that affects those who have no idea where their lives are going or where they've come from. I guess that's part of the elemental truth that I believe in that many liberals take offense at. At some point it became offensive to liberals to believe in anything that could be construed as judgemental against others and yet ironically without these set of beliefs the world is open to a million judgemental eyes. This love, the Love of God and Christ is greater than judgement, but rather it is about forgiveness. As the Teacher said do not worry about the speck in your neighbor's eye when their is a plank in your own.

In the end because many of the people that I am lucky and blessed to know are trying to live their lives in this manner, in the teaching of God, I am blessed to not be around the kinds of relationships that I see portrayed on TV or in the movies, and yet those shows are being watched by someone and the laughs are coming from somewhere. Somewhere the pain is being felt alone when the lights are turned out. America is in crisis, but not like in the same way that Rumsfeld and Bush want us to believe. We're in crisis not just because we don't even know our own neighbors but because we don't even know our own families or our selves. 

Secrets and lies. Teddy Bear likes to call it Secrets and Lies after a British movie by the same title. For us and for the safety and emotional strength of our relationship we've tried to put a lot of work into honesty with one another. This means not just the big things but the little things as well. While ultimately I think we all need to have safety places in our past to work things out (his divorce, my child abuse) I've revealed things to Teddy that while seemingly trivial were important to me to get out and share with someone. But we're also honest about the little things as well... the white lies that ""we all tell."" The you know ""Sure it wont take long"" lies when you really know moving will take all day... those sorts of things. I don't want resentment to build up between us, or a history where I feel like I was never even there."

Hatred Swells 

the night falls in a heavy, suffocating cloak, fearful are we.
the god for which you sacrifice yourself
flares once, then dies,
devoured by madness.
all hope must sicken and die.
your soul thrives no more.
how could you fail to believe?
our dark emotions surround us, crying,
we have lost our way.

This is of course after we did the same exercise yesterday and she flipped out on me. L got her masters in creative non-fiction so she tends to think that those of us who ""dabble"" in this aren't up to her standards... and surely a poem generator is about the dumbest thing in the world. But for whatever reason she saw that I was doing it again and decided to join in. Her anger is so palpable in life. It's very hard to live with and be around. She's one of those people that if you have her in small doses than you aren't as likely to experience this, but by being around her as much as I have been (and her extreme emotional fireworks) it's clear how unstable and volatile she is. Last night she blew up at me, screaming at me that she didn't want to ""fucking do this anymore,"" and per usual it came out of nowhere. It's clear that she's holding on by a thread. On the same token it's very hard knowing that while she's just barely holding on that I have to basically put up with this abusive relationship. If we were dating, and not just friends NO one would expect me to put up with this. It would be a given that I should get out."

As I had planned on quitting today I just sort of figured to myself, ""guess I might as well quit,"" and that's the very uninteresting story of how I quit smoking... again. Part of me wishes that I had savored the last cigerette, really dragged it in and felt the pleasure of it, but then part of me feels that in the end that's really a trap, that, that sort of thinking just leads to more smoking and that this more unromantic way of quitting is better in the end. So, today is day 3 and as I was just telling Teddy Bear while day one is a bitch, and day two is a breeze (one has the whole ""I just made it through day one"" high to go one) day three is a bitch as well. On day three the voices return. By that I mean the devil. When one is quitting smoking the devil actually speaks to them. To quote him directly he says ""Come one... you know you want it... you've proved to the world what a strong bugger you are... you can do it... one drag won't kill you...you've already smoked like a gazillion drags in your life, a gazillin cigs, one more... come on... you've done it once... you can do it again.""

However, it has been proven that he's a manipulator. A cheat. A con-artist (with a prison reccord), an alcoholic (albiet dry) and a user. He doesn't respect who I am. As my mother put it, I am a gift made by God for this world and my father does not see me that way, rather he sees me as something he can take from for himself and remold. As the gift does not come that way, he does not understand the gift, and therefore, does not get to receive the gift. 

For me there are two issues here. One in the Old Testament (OT) when we are commanded to respect our mothers and fathers, it is implied that we should also be respected. Just as we are in relationship with God we are in relationship with our parents and it is the RELATIONSHIP that matters and it's health that needs to be cared for and therefore, all parties that need to be respected. However, this concepted has been maninpulated and ABUSED. Secondly, as an adult survivor of child abuse as well as a rape survivor I still have vestiges of a really crappy ""coping"" mechanism that has me capitulate to the man's wishes in order to avoid his rage and possibly further damage. However, in capitulating I am giving into some damage and I believe that is what is going on here. I need to end this cycle and if this is what I sense I am feeling than my father is not acting in my best interest and he is not a man to be trusted, or to be met on any terms ""his"" or ""mine."" 

Please pray for my safety in these days as I try to figure out a way to block him coming and preventing a blow up. 

Godbless,
Lolly"

My biological father... a man that I have never met... is about 3 hours away from me at the moment and on a spurious decision has decided to come up and meet me. This is all happening a.) the same week that my mother is graduating from graduate school, b.) I have a friend coming in from out of town that I haven't seen in 8 years, c.) the crazy lady that I used to be a nanny for is coming to my mother's graduation and I haven't seen her in 8 years, d.) I finally get some alone time from L, e.) Teddy Bear made me cry out of LOVE because he said some really nice things to me (amoung them that he was considering buying me this gift that my ex never would have even considered and that he was worried about my bike safety which sounds silly to make someone weepy about but his concern really, really touched me) f.) that whole school thing and finally g.) I've been blamed for killing one of the cats that I'm house sitting for because he was hit by a car and I just feel horrible about it. 

So as you can plainly see my life is already full... how do I add this to it? To complicate matters he's dying of liver cancer, he's old as the hills and if I don't meet him now I never will. It's just that I always thought that I never would... and I had gotten used to that. *hits head against keyboard again* a;ljsdfoaiwehjohlasngo ""Ouch!"" *deep breath*.

"event","Yesterday L and I found out that one of the cat's we had been housesitting was hit by a car and died... today K (their other kitty) and LB (my kitty) both escaped the house at the same time. L has taken to calling them both Greasedlightening, but at the moment I don't feel there's much humor in it. While the two of them scamper all of the 'hood I'm scared too death that one of them might get hit. When it comes to kitties and their health I take these matters very seriously. Poor Teddy has already been called (at 12 am) as I was asking him for advice on what to do. Basically he advised me to do what I thought that I would do already, stay up and keep trying to get them inside periodically. 

One of the things that frustrating about this is that for the first time in weeks I'm finally alone. L has gone home for the week and as she is one of the crazziest people on the planet (I could go on) she has really added to my stresses this summer. I was looking forward to a very relaxful evening, kicking back with a bowl of popcorn and a quirky german film that Teddy Bear reccomended to me (The Princess and the Warrior), but now I find myself running to the backdoor every 10 minutes trying to rope in kitties. 

As for life in general though, things are going better. While I was feeling blue earlier in one of those hazy sort of ""what do I do with my life now?"" sort of phases, it happened that Teddy Bear came over and seriously lifted my mood. As I had gone to the farmers market yesterday and bought bushels of fresh veggies I made Teddy and I a fresh market soup and over dinner we talked about things and it helped to get some of my frustrations off my chest. After dinner, Teddy and I laid down (ostensibly to rest) but ended up fooling around a bit which SERIOUSLY lifted my mood (nothing like a little hormone adrenaline boost!) and then we went for ice cream. Does life get better than that! So things are doing much better...

Still anxious about the kitties. But all in all, I'm feeling better. Tomorrow I'm going to rework on quitting smoking again (does anyone know if there's an LJ community dedicated to this? I should check...) and then I'm going to contact the pastor of the church that I'll be working at! I'm nervous about that... not really into the ""first contact"" thing."

"event","I guess on some level this song gets to everyone's desire to ""go west my son,"" or it wouldn't have such enduring popularlity. I'm actually a big fan of Tracy Chapman and tomorrow she's got a show that I can't afford to go and see. All my adult life I've wanted to see her but that time will come. I think that a lot of life is lived in the balance between knowing when you're time will come and wondering if your time will come. When I was in elementury school and the bullies would tease me my mom would tell me ""it's not your time to shine yet,"" again she told me this in high school and even college, which I learned to love and now at the seminary I hear those words and I wonder if I really want to shine anymore. Is it giving up on a dream, growing practical, or just changing for God as I pray to that helps me to see life this way? I never craved fame and when I did get it, my cheeks would flush and while I could spew out the witty banter my palms were moist and I usually wanted to run away before the jokes ran out. 

While I've had acclaim for my brain, my writing, my acting or my speaking I never felt beautiful until one Halloween my Korean friend J dressed me up as my soul sister Marilyn Monroe. The result was uncanny. She got my hair perfect and with her help picking out a dress and doing my make up I looked just like Marilyn on the fateful night that she sang ""Happy Birthday Mr. President"" (not my favorite moment, but it was the best costume we could find). For once in my life I was a sex bomb and I felt naked. Men were staring at me up and down and front and back. I ended up borrowing my friends vestiment robes and running outside to smoke in the cold, I couldn't take the attention. 

The anti-psychotic that I've just finished taking put 40 lbs on me. It's average is 100lbs before it levels off. I begged my doctor to switch my meds. Even though I'm working out, I can't seem to stop eating and the weight keeps coming on. My mom just bought me $380 of new clothes and authorized another $100 for ""casuals"". She's never spent that much money on clothes for me in my life. Growing up ""back to school shopping"" meant a trip to Goodwill and not the mall. My gym shoes were from K-mart. 

Go west my son. Go west my daughter. The time is coming that soon I will be moving out West and I'm petrified. IF I can get all of this stuff sorted out with my school (which I have faith will happen) then I'll be moving to this little town out West for a year to serve a tiny little parish. You can take the girl out of the city but can you take the city out of the girl?"

"event","in time. As of late I've been in contact with an old friend of mine. A and I met first when I was eight years old, the year I found Christ, joined my church and basically begin to discover who I was. I remember I was eight when I realized that the sexual abuse was abuse. Maybe I learned it in school? I don't know. Before that, it just seemed like what life was, or maybe I figured that everyone did it? I don't know. But I was eight when I realized that I was ""different"" from other kids in this way. I had just gone through a very serious period of rebellion, screaming and fighting at school; swearing like a sailor. At eight I changed schools, quit swearing, joined the church and became a member of the choir. The summer before that though my mom and I took a vacation ""out East"" and that's when I met A and her family. My mom was friend's with A's step-mom and I have to say at first I found A to be kind of annoying. Like me, A is ""sensitive"" and was always being made fun of by other kids. Frankly, she doesn't have that many friends, even as an adult becuase of this. 

But the thing is she's sweet and she reminds me of some of the best times in my life. Growing up as a child in my hometown I was a geek. Everyone made fun of me. I was into Christ, but not even cool at church. My mom and I were the lowest on the social ladder, but when I started going East in the summers all of a sudden I was no longer on the low end of the ladder but even sort of popular. Or rather, it wasn't that I was popular it was just that no one thought that they were better than anyone else, or worse. All the kids in the neighborhood played together. While I haven't really adequately remained friends with that group of kids... like lifelong friends... in my heart I know that's where I spent some of the happiest times of childhood and it's those experiences that allow me to feel normal even now. Sometimes my abuse still sets me apart. The pain that I carry with me can be hard to transcend on some days and my anger at feeling cheated as a child is hard to address, but it's the knowledge that at times I did have something of a childhood that helps me to feel not so alone."

"event","Actually, my neighbor's screaming wasn't what precipitated this recent purchase of smokes as much as my friend L's depression. This evening Teddy Bear and I were very excited to have a ""date at home"" just between the two of us, but less than 2 hours into the evening I called home to see how L was and she asked me to come home. She was in hysterics when I talked to her on the phone but when I got home she was fine. When I talked on the phone the other day with her grandmother J she said that the thing that really bugged her about L is that L uses her depression to be the center of attention. That's how I felt about being asked to come home. It wasn't that she didn't want to be alone. It wasn't that there was anything scary going on in the 'hood (like there is now). Nor was it that her depression was causing such a weight on her chest that she couldn't breath... it was that I was with my boyfriend, that I have a boyfriend, and that it's unfair. 

I can't say why I have a boyfriend and she doesn't. I know that my depression isn't as crippling as hers and that I think I have a more open and honest relationship with The Creator, but in the end I don't think even those answers are enough. I'm often willing to take chances that she wont, I met Teddy Bear through an online dating service. I'm also lucky enough to have a healthier outlook about dating and don't get caught up in really unhealthy relationships... but I'm just not comfortable judging someone else's life that way. 

While Teddy Bear put forth this theory based on my sexuality I think it has some play here as well. He thought that maybe because I've put so much thought into my sexual life due to my sexual abuse as a child that ultimately I have more knowledge of my sexuality and am freer with it (verses the more unhealthy response of being more reserved because of the abuse). I think it's true with my relationships. I went through therapy for two years, and came back to it when I needed it. I've thought about these things. Also I was saying to Teddy Bear today over dinner, because L puts so much emphasis upon perfection and being perfect she doesn't allow for the ability to grow. It's either, ""I'm perfect"" or ""I'm a loser"" (she's said both of those things to me at one time or another). But if one allow's for growth and accepts one's limitations in life than one is more inclined to say ""hmm... I guess that kind of sucked, what can I do to change that in the future"" without it crushing one's entire being. 

In the end I'm just pissed that I had to come home. I was so pissed in fact that I bought  a pack of cigs and then satan being the dork that he is made it that Marlboro was having a sale at the local mart ""buy one pack get two free"" so I've got three packs of cigs. My hope is that I keep telling myself that since two of the packs were free I should just flush them and call it a loss... as for my neighbor... she's drunk and keeps screaming at her husband. We don't need the air on at the moment and it's nice to air the place out so I want the windows open but I find myself praying harder for the lady accross the street than I have been praying for myself in weeks. L says she sounds like a cat whose tail has been stepped upon. 

Lastly, my iritus is back and the drops are kicking in. The screen is getting blurry. I wish I could be cuddling with Teddy Bear... oh well as the french say ""se la vive""."

"event","Last night Teddy Bear and I watched the movie Resident Evil, very gory, one of the actress's had scary-big-chemical lips, and the leading men weren't that cute--but it was worth watching (for free on late night TV). Tonight I'm watching the movie version of the X-Files. I don't know if I'm ashamed to admit it or proud of the fact but I never did become that large of an X-Files fan while it was on TV. It's weird because in one way I think us sci-fi fans should stick together, we should know what each other are watching. I usually stayed on top of the plot lines so that I could... do just that, stay on top of things so that I could back up my sci-fi brothers and sisters, but for whatever reason it wasn't my show. Maybe because I'm already inclined to be paranoid I knew that I shouldn't feed it, or maybe it was because I had homework to do and it's airtime was at 8 pm on Sunday night.

In college my friends had an anti-frat called Psy Phi. It was the place where I got drunk for the first time in my life. I didn't mean to, it's just that I had hardly ever encountered alcohol before in my life. It was my 19th birthday and my friends decided to use it as a chance to host a huge party. It was barely 10:30 pm and the party was only kicking in when the three or four beers I drunk too quickly kicked in and told me as patiently as they could that they wanted out... Well, just before that moment the ""love of my ever short live"" had just pushed me up against a wall and kissed me my first real romantic boy kiss and I had to run and go puke. On my way back from the bathroom (like I was someone you'd want to make out with!) I stopped in the living room and passed out. Later I was told that two women ""discovered that they were lesbians"" right on the floor next to my passed out body. 

The point of the story? I can't seem to type the word or think the word sci-fi without thinking of the ""real"" Psy-Phi in my mind a place where I found artistic encouragement, acceptance, poetry and friendship for who I am first time in my life. I had left my hometown where I will forever be regarded as a geek and a weirdo and I came to this little place in a large City where people really cared about me and that was when my love affair with my undergraduate college began. Down on my knees puking in some guys bathroom on a male only floor in a dorm.... I was safe there nonetheless. 

That experience did not come to epitomize my life but hopefully I'm conveying the point that I meant to which is that I have places where I belong and where I become recharged and I know that just as they exist and that they have existed for me in the past then they will exist for me again in the future somewhere.

I went to the financial aid office today (yeah me) and found out that 'cuz I hadn't signed the summer financial aid form I wasn't elligible for any summer aid! Ack. I guess I missed the deadline. What upset me though was that they sent the form back to my mom's house and of course she opened it and read it which is just another way she has of treating me like I'm 16 years old. They are giving me some aid but it's not going to be enough for me to live on, so I'm still trying to find some sort of work. I really, really, really want to catch up on LJ friend's but once I embarked on this endeavor I realized that I was just too tired to complete it. Hopefully tomorrow. Thinkin' of ya'll though... sorry for such a boring post."

"event","cried, ""wee, wee, wee... all the way home."" Home again, home again... jiggidy jig. Well, I'm happy to report that I had a vunderbar mini-vac with my Teddy Bear. There's much to report, but I'm very tired. Enjoyed the food, the wine and the great conversations (but mostly the teddy bear cuddles!). Feeling sheepish. Had wonderful realization that back in the day Teddy Bear and I might have been in the same place at the same time, years before we met. Love feels mighty fine from were I'm looking at it. Holding on to the feeling. Will catch up on LJ friends on the morrow. 
Love,
Lolly"

"event","Tedddy Bear and I are currently staying at my current roommate and bestfriend L'S apartment that she still rents in my home town... now I know that this is confusing, but my mom is currently subsiding the apartment in order to finish the final part of her masters in nursing in which she has to work at a hospital full time. The hospital is a one hour drive from where she lives so while L is staying with me, she's subletting this place... does that make sense?

Well, it's so friggin' hot... hot, hot, hot. Teddy Bear and I went about the country side in order to get some sight seeing in and then my aunt and I somehow miscommunicated and I thought she was expecting us today but according to her she's not expecting us tomorrow... so we're back at L's house. It's okay though my aunt and uncle don't have air conditioning, and incase you didn't already know... it's HOT OUTSIDE!! Cool beans though, in a little bit Teddy Bear and I are going to see the movie 28 Days Later... I'll let you know later if it's scary enough to make my skin tingle!"

"event","I told Teddy Bear that I would take one of my sleeping pills so that I would be all rested for our drive tomorrow, but I had wanted to get things done as well so I thought that I might be able to go without... now it's 1 am or so and I'm faced with the decision to take or not to take. I might end up taking it, but I'm kind of pissed off that I coudln't fall asleep without one!

I reread the post that I made the other night and I thought that it was awefully revealing, like the stuff I said about branding Teddy Bear so that he would be mine. That feels weird to say ""out loud"" so that other people can read it. 

I wanted to catch up on LJ friends but my keyboard is being weird. Funny computers... don't act right. Must go, being too hard to type... sorry LJ friends, I guess I'll have to catch up on another day (I have another keyboard to install, this one sticks and doesn't hit all of the right keys).

"event","Today Teddy Bear and I went across the boarder to buy fireworks for our trip to my parent's house for the 4th of July. While my hometown puts on a really good show and the little town where my parent's currently live also puts on a good show we've decided to skip the big shows and go for something small out at the farm with plenty of food, my famous lemonaide and vats of my infamous guacamole. We'll have a bonfire with a bbq and then sit out side celebrating the love of family and communion in our own way.

Well, I was telling L about this as her mom is coming to spend the weekend with her while we're gone (perfect timing) and I was telling her in particular a sweet story of how Teddy Bear and I went to buy the fireworks across the boarder and how he annouced that we would be crossing the boarder with them (into a state that forbids them) and I made the comment ""this from the lawyer."" Teddy's face seemed to go a few shades past scarlet at that, but in the retelling it brought a gift of giggles out ouf Laura who is a young woman for whom things aren't going that well as of late. 

She stood accusingly for a moment and then pointed at me and said, ""Teddy Bear acts differently around you."" It's true. When I'm alone with him I feel like he understands me. It's silly but it has meaning to me when knows what I want dairy queen, or he can order for me at a restaurant when I'm having a panic attack and he orders just the right thing. I am addicted to the feeling that he's mine. I know that in reality he's God's, not mine, but it's like I want to brand him. I don't want to own him, but I want my love to be a refuge and place where we can come together and generate God's love and hope for the world and part of that is in silliness. He gets that I'm silly sometimes, even when I figure that my silliness should be a turn off. Like wearing platform heals with overalls. It was weird but what I wanted to wear. Does any of this make sense? I just took my sleeping pill......."

"event","I'm helping my friend J pack and move today so we're getting some good quality time before she goes back to Korea! J and I have been ""sisters"" ever since we lived in the dorms together. We adopted each other because her family was too far away to come and visit on family day and my family hates coming to the seminary (the people are too rude!). She's South Korean and I'm pretty much caucasion so whenever we wear nametags with our ""sister's"" name on them it's pretty funny. She's as sharp as a tack and wont take any duff though. I say this because white-liberal Americans like to be seen with minorities that make them feel safe and insure their liberal status and unfortunately J is always the one that they want for photo-ops. Anymore J, like me, wants to leave our denomination. As she is one of my only friends that is still an MDiv (as opposed to an MA or Masters of Theology) she has to go through the same hoops that I do and like me they are ""killing us softly"" with their crap. This is opposed to all of my other friends who either a.) quit the seminary, b.) quit the MDiv program to become MA's or c.) have been kicked out. People who aren't going through the crap that I'm going through though think I'm being ultra sensitive or melodramatic or both but J understands. 

It's true J's response to this whole situation put her in a mood earlier this semester where she kind of freaked out on me and that was tough. One day she just wigged and said that neither of us were ever going to become pastors. Basically it was one of those situations where faced with what's going on you either believe the infamous ""them"" or your own experience and for a time she was believing ""them."" Since then she's renegged (thankfully) and apologized, recognizing that she was displacing her issues onto me. She now says that if she comes back to the US to finish her MDiv she's going to go to a different school, and possibly not one of our denomination. She might quit our denomination altogether. 

You have to understand dear readers, I wish that I could name which denomination it was... and if I ever do it will be to a friends only post. I'm just not prepared to just as of yet. I've probably left clues, but no definitive ones (not that guessing this should be a game). I'm just such a vulnerable person in my church. 

Well, I need to lay down to rest a little bit before we start moving some stuff!"

"event","It's moving day again in my world... but I'm not going anywhere. My friend J is going back to Korea (I'm still in shock) so I have to help her move some stuff into storage. Because her brother is getting married but she hasn't wrapped stuff up here she's going home first for a month, coming back for a month and then going back again. My friend A of Norway has bought her car and is generally driving me crazy calling me every other day to ask about the car, J's driving, ""has J changed the oil regularly?"" Etc. It's driving me loco. I'll miss J a lot though. Today she called me her ""rock"". On family day at school, even though she's obviously Korean and I'm obviously caucasion we always where name tags stating that we're each other's sisters... can't seem to type at the moment. Gotta go.

"event","Dear Teddy Bear,
The night is alive for my touch of you. I feel in the darkness a wallowing sorrow and a body chained to a wall--that stink--that runs through the ages. The haunting humm of a bee hive does not hide the queens sorrow from being locked in a catacomb, a grave. A grave that a child robs with sticky fingers and a round belly. Love is not sickly sweet that burns like acid all that touches it, but the terrified cries of prisoners; they are God's true voice. 

A savior borne in a feeding bin used earlier that day--holding slop we wouldn't feed a begger---was raised to become a king who would ride into Jerusalem on the back of an ass. So why then in our own lives do we 2000 years hence still ask the questions of why are some called master while others are called slaves? Why do some see love in a flower and some hear it in the cries of the oppressed, or on the faces of those whose naked bodies lie in the gutters, as I've seen around the world?
*****
You are trembling beloved one. Do not fear, the Lord is a generous lover, full of many delights. God understands our own sufferings, in our own ways and comes to each of us uniquely to touch our hearts.
*****
I do not know the answers to the questions I pose, nor do I make apology for them in their painfulness, but I find beauty in them nonetheless and the understanding that these are God's questions as well. But it was with the intent of writing a love letter that I started to pen these few words to you, so one might ponder how these words could be romantic, or the stuff of a love letter. However, while so many people have tackled the age old quetion of ""what is love?"" by describing a world full of flight and glory, I guess in my own way I have defined the answer before the question was posed, and for me that question cannot be answered without trying to understand that which holds us down. 
*****
If you could be here tonight... in my arms... you would know how spiritually, deeply, fully and physically I care and crave for your beingness. But for the time being you will have to settle on these humble pennings.
*****
Some say God is within us and that human beings alone can save ourselves. In my faith while God is within my heart I also reside in his. However, my heart's capacity for God is not that great while God's capacity for love is much greater than anything we could ever know as human beings. This is the reason we must look to God for the good in the Universe. When we bind ourselves to another as a lover we are opening ourselves up to another piece of love that the Lord has placed in this world. Much as the sum of the parts is required for a working and healthy ecosystem, as beings we need one another to know the exponentional qualities of love. 

It is as if God has given each of one half of the key to a secret garden which we can only find by matching together our broken keys... Love is what happens when two people open up and trust and communicate to one another and believe in one another. I believe we have a great chance in this love. You have a great capacity to love and a good heart that I can feel beating beside me so that I feel safe in your arms. While I may have been around the world a few times and have personally heard the different rythems of its drums, I understand that the world is made up of different types and we all have different needs. I will grow in this understanding and hopefully we will learn to dance in the beat that is ours. I love you. 

Love, 
Lolly"

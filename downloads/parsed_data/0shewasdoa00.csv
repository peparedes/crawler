This is my last entry in here...on lj.  I can't keep doing this, it's getting to the point that it's taking all of my energy.  I've tried to be nice, I've tried to be everyone's friend, but somehow, I have fingers being pointed at me telling me I have evil intentions.  It may not have been said this way, but this is what I feel like it's saying.  So, I think the only way to solve this petty fight is to put a stop to all of it right here.  The people who need to know where to find me, already do."

"event","wow, not exactly how I wanted to start the day...Justin calls me at 9 this morning to announce that him and Cory just had a wreck.  Here's what happened from what I was told and understand.  They were going down Blaylock road doing around 50 and the hit a patch of gravel.  The back end broke loose and Cory locked up and slammed the gas down.  When he did, they shot across the road and hit a power pole, snapping it in half.  When they hit the pole, all of the windows busted out and Cory flew out of the car.  Justin remained inside and ended bouncing all across the car while it was flipping in th air.  The car landed on all fours (litterally, the ends of the car was touching the ground).  By the time Justin got out of the car, Cory was already standing up.  Hardly a scratch on him.  Justin tried to walk, but collapsed.  He injured he knee badly when they hit the pole.  They both walked away from the accident without any serious injury and no broken bones.  Neither of them were wearing seat belts, both of them ended up with glass all in them..in their arms, back, hiands, and their heads.  They are so lucky to be alive......let alone walking."

And I told her, ""I was waiting for you to come up to me in the hallway like this.""  She got pissed off because she did exactly as I thought she would so she raises her fist in the air like she's going to punch me, and I said, ""Go ahead, hit me.  I'm not fighting you.""  Scotti grabbed her fist and I turned around and walked away.

This past weekend was fun, I really enjoyed being part of the Shiloh living history event.  You were wonderful and fun.  I love spending time with you..just hanging out together.  When I was running through the field out there, I tripped and fell, laughing.  You followed me and ended up holding yourself up over me...could it be anymore perfect?"

if he ever hurt me in anyway, you would kill him...and yet, I've shed
more tears over you than anyone in my entire life. How does that work
out in your mind?<br>
<br>

today in class, you started in with your ugly little remarks,
interupted me (on multiple occasions in which I WAS right) and then
proceeded to tell people how arrogant I was. Mr.Hinton told me what you
said and then he asked you, ""How can she have any arrogance when you're
always cutting her down?"" I don't know what it is I do to make you hate
me so much. Sitting there, reading my book, minding my business and you
have to say something so ugly it makes me cry. You tell me I shouldn't
worry about what you say because it doesn't matter..but you know very
well that I can't do that. So I get defensive and angry because I'm hurt
and unsure of how else to act because no matter what I say or do, it's
going to be thrown right back in my face as if I'm wrong somehow no

If I had a star for every
time you made me smile
I would have a night sky in
the palm of my hand

     I love
      you</i>

the other night, we we're going driving around and I was singing ""Crazy"" by Patsy Cline and a few mintues later, we ended up at the boat launch and he said to turn on the radio and put it on a country station (Justin hates country).  I turn it on and a few minutes later ""Crazy"" comes on the radio....I looked at him and said ""How the hell did you do that?""  I couldn't believe it.....

yeah, life's great :D"

"event","was having a good day, but like always someone has to come along and burst my little bubble.  Like in sixth period, Scotti called me spoiled in front of the entire calss and then continued to argue with me about it.  I still haven't figured out what makes me so spoiled to him....so lately I'm I guess I'm just a bit apathetic to the things I should be very emotional over.  Justin's not doing so great in half of his classes and he says I sound just like his mom.....so what if I do.  I just want him to have the chance to further his education incase he wanted to after high school.....he doesn't care about anything anymore ""except for me"", according to him.  I don't know why I'm so angry right not, I guess that I really don't have a reason to be angry at anyone...but I really don't feel like being all that fucking logical right now."

I was very envied by the other girls around me!  It was pretty awesome.  I got a guitar pick from the guitarist of Silvertide.  Then it was time for Shinedown!  Their performance was spectacular!  They were awesome....I got to hold Brents (the lead singer) hand twice and Brad (the bassist) looked right at me and smiled...they put on a great show (oh and Scotti, you were wrong!  The lead singer sounds better live than on his cd, and this was his last concert of the tour and he sounded amazing!  so blah!)  When they finished playing the drummer threw his drum sticks and I got one and dad caught one, but he gave it to the girl standing by him because me and the girls already had a drum stick each.

"event","Friday night was awesome.  The game was ok, I had to keep an eye on my little cousins and we lost like always.  It was after the game that rocked..me and a couple of my buddies went and got high..haha.  Then we went to the dance and Lulu was dancing and doing the robot..I was laughing so hard.  Then me and Justin went and drove around.  We ended up parking at Lake Lowndes.  We talked about everything...

am I falling too fast?"

"event","Well for my first entry... its gunna be drama!!!

First things first....

Bad day as it is.. Pep Rally was boring.. got in a bad mood by the end of the day... came home and got yelled at for nothing.... And made my mom take me to get some food....

Then drama begins...

On top of being scared about my best friend having to wear a heart monitor and my dad having oldtimers... < thats what i think... and my neice bein a friken idiot... more had to happen...


My sisters ex-husband is homeless and stole money from her and was living with her... well today was supposed to be his last day there... i guess not.. so my dad was drunk and being so mean to my sister... she hung up on my dad... my dad flipped out and wanted to go to her house.. so of course i have to be the strong one and calm down my mom and go with my dad so he doesnt flip out.. can u juss imagine a 15 yr old tellin her rents wat 2 do... well then after my sister wouldnt open the door for us.. my dad is flippin out tryin to find her ex-husband... and in the end he gets a hold of him over the phone.. goes down there and everyone is like scared for my dads life tryin 2 find him... 

it was soo stupid.. when are they goin to learn to grow up.. im just so exhausted now.. i juss want everything to be over with!!! 

But i guess thats it for tonight.. im juss goin 2 go watch a movie.. eat some cookies.. and fall sleep..

 ...these past two days hv been very interesting...yesterday ((sunday)) i went to wrk and everything went as usual. then all of a sudden my manager comes down and says ""were closing skoopys..now..get ur things..go home""..WELL SHIT! .. Thanx for the notice...so now im unemployed..not sayin thats bad..but hey..im going to charolette this weekend so when i come bk ill look for me a job..tomorrow however im going for an interview at maggy moos, but even if i do get hired, employees dont start till near the end of the month...
 ...and now for the more interesting news...im going to be straight forward w/ everyone and not beat around the bush...me n amberly are talking again!...now i kno that a few of u r sayin..hey i bet he ditched shannon for her, but let me make this perfectly clear--THAT IS NOT WAT HAPPENED!!! infact shannon was the one that didnt want to be together w/ me nemore and i was more than willing to wrk it out w/ her..But she didnt want to and AFTER we called it off amberly called me up and said a few things to me..that got me thinking...so if anyone wants to act lk their 2yrs old and start rumors or talk shit go right ahead, but remember that thats childish and I DIDNT END IT BETWEEN ME N SHANNON..SHE DID!!!..
 ...now im going to get offa here b/c i want to take a nap, b/c i got to stay up late tonite and study for anatomy ((hardest class ever!))..but newayz..ill holla atcha later...PeAcE"

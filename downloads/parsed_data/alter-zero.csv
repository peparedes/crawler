"event","So, we've been here for 2 weeks now - feels like it's been an eternity already.  Phoenix is an OK place, except for the relentless heat.  

3 in the morning? 100 degrees.  
3 in the afternoon? 115.

When I ask people what they do in their free time(this time of year)....the answer I always get is ""hibernate"".  

So last week, I thought I would do something besides that.  We drove to the Grand Canyon.  When I was little, I went there with the family, and I remember there being some breathing room.  Not so much anymore.  It was ridiculously crowded, and every time I tried to take a photo, some white bitch was stepping in front of it.

My job seems pretty good, but after listening in on some of their ""experienced"" reps, I can't believe the advantage I have here.  I could really advance in this company, because of my training and experience.  Question is, do I really want to?

The apartment here is nice, a lot nicer than the one in Sac. It pretty much has to be, since you're stuck inside half the year.  I'm really not giving a shit about how much closer this place is to San Antonio anymore.  So, a year from now, I can only think of 2 cities that are on ""the list"" as places to move to.  And I think a skiing trip is in order later THIS year(I know just the place from my trip to Colorado a couple years back).

The first is San Diego - This one gained a little more favor in the past week, since I found out my cousin who just graduated MIT is trying to move there.  Oh, and I'll gladly extend a drive to SA by a few hours to get out of this ridiculous heat.

The second is the city I've obsessed over for years: Portland.  Ahh, that sweet, sweet, cool, rainy weather.  Plus after seeing it a couple of times in person, I could tell it's my kind of place.

Eureka - I have a plan! (lol)   I'll buy a condo in SD, and a vacation house on the Oregon coast, right after I win the lottery. 

fuck. :-/

Actually, now I plan on trying to convince the family to come out West.  With my cousin moving to CA, and me in AZ, I might be able to convince my sis to come out West for college.  And if that happens, I don't think my folks would be that far behind.  There won't be anything left to tie them down in FL (ick, never living there again)"

"event","So in 4 days, we're moving to Phoenix.  We'll be there at least a year, then who knows....I'll be discussing that further down in this journal.  Anyway, this works for now, because it puts us within easy driving distance of both LA and San Antonio.  As much as I put Sacramento down, I am going to miss Northern California.  The coast north of San Francisco(all the way up to Canada) has a kind of magical quality that you just don't find in SoCal.  The cliffs, the dense forests, the rivers, the weather, but most of all, the relative isolation all combine to make it one of my favorite places I've ever seen.  I'll also miss being close to Lake Tahoe, San Francisco, and the Sierra Nevada.  Heh, the summer in PHX is going to be brutal, but we'll just have to live with it.

Beyond the next year or two, there's a lot of variables.  I'm leaving open for consideration some of the places I've previously considered: San Diego, LA, Portland, and Austin/San Antonio.  All depending on the situation.  I'll be looking to get a job with a large, possibly international company - I don't plan on sticking with Progressive forever.  

Oh, and if some fundamental things don't change about the United States, I'm afraid we'll be looking to move out of the country(hence the talk about an international company).  I've got a few other countries in mind, so I'll list them.  Canada(duh), Australia/New Zealand, Spain, and Japan.  The UK could be added to that list, if I could ever get in touch with my uncle who lives there to ask him some questions.  Why would we do such a thing?  Because the laws this country has regarding marriage and immigration are not exactly helpful with respect to our situation. As ridiculous as this sounds, it would be easier for Julio to get citizenship in those countries than in the country he's known as home since he was 4 years old.  Welcome to the United States of Fucktardmerica."

"event","I have a job interview in San Diego on my birthday.  Not at some fucking employment agency(like the one in Seattle), but at the actual company I'd be working for.  It would basically be the same job I do now, but at geico this time.  And a much better location, hehe.  So I can make my birthday special if I nail it.  The day I knew I was getting out of both USAA and Sactown - ahhhh, I can almost feel it now.

Anyway, the pay and benefits are similar, and cost of living is marginally higher in SD than it is here.  It's a completely reasonable idea, and that's why it works.  I have a different feeling about this one, and I'm really excited because I can totally see us living down there - <b>permanently</b>.  So tired of trying to find a good place to settle.  2 years ago, I saw San Diego for the first time, and absolutely loved it, but never thought I could afford it.  But things have changed, and I feel like now is the time to go for it.

So, tomorrow I leave work early, and we're off to southern california for a short time.  Probably won't have time to do anything fun, but knowing it's finally time to move will be good enough for me.  I'm sure being closer to LA will make Julio feel a lot better too.

I'm still trying to find my way out of USAA, because that place is like a ticking time bomb for me.  But I decided not limit my search to one place. As such, I've been applying to lots of jobs in 3 different place: here, Portland, and one other place that I won't name just yet, but I think it would surprise people if we moved there.  My definition of ""affordable"" has changed, hehehe(Especially if a roommate situation could be worked out).  It's a place where both of us would be close enough to our hometowns to make it there in a day's drive.

I have an interview in Sac tomorrow, so it'll be interesting to see what they want me for.  I hate hiring agencies, because they don't ever tell you anything before you show up.  Other than that, I'm off til Thursday, so I'm just going to wait and see if anyone else calls me.  My birthday's coming up in a couple of weeks here, and for the first time in my life, I actually feel older.  Not sure whether that's good or bad, but I do. meh.

I got rear-ended on the freeway, and the bastards drove off.

I got told that MY job is probably in jeapordy, and soon.

Anyway, on to my dilemma:  I've been thinking more and more about going back to my home state to live.  This is decision time, since I have to let the apartment complex know by the end of the month whether I'm staying or not.  So, Austin and San Antonio seem to be better options the more I think about it.  My biggest concern about it is that Julio may not like it.  Neither of us like it in Sac, though....

"event","On Friday, I completed a 5-week long training class at work for a long-awaited raise.  Yay!  

Before the class started, we took a trip to L.A. to see Julio's friends and pick up some of his stuff.  My entire perception of that city changed on the trip.  It's not the overcrowded, stagnant cesspool that a lot of people would have me think.  It's actually a pretty nice place, and I'd have no problem living there...if we could even remotely afford it.

And with that thought, comes the issue of moving. I don't know if we're moving at all anymore. As backwards as it can be sometimes, Sacramento has grown on me.  That, and the fact that my job is going pretty well, kind of leads me into the idea of sticking around for a while.  It's not my first choice, but it's not so bad, either.  I think the determining factor is going to be my end-of-year evaluation, and subsequent bonus(or lack of one). My manager is pretty tough on me, and if they don't think enough of me after the year I've been pouring my heart into the company, I'm out.  In that case, the most likely place would be Portland or Seattle.  I'm very fond of those places, and it's relatively cheap to live there.  It's important to note I haven't ruled out crossing the border to Vancouver, either.  Moving to Canada is a pretty attractive prospect these days.  Other places in California are nice, too(Bay area and SoCal), but just too expensive.  The longer I establish myself here in Sacramento, though, the harder it's going to be to pick up and move again.  Plus, I'm not going <b>anywhere</b> that Julio doesn't want to go.  So, I have a vacation scheduled the first week of December, and I might just use it for more than sightseeing.  The plan is to head to the pacific NW, and scope out the scenery, but it may become a job/apartment hunt too, depending on how things go.

I do miss my friends in Texas, and my family sometimes, but not enough to go moving back.  I've come way too far to start moving backwards.  I wish they would visit sometimes, and I wish I could visit them, but until some things are worked out, I don't know just how viable that is."

First of all:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v101/halo382/CALIFORNIA.jpg"">

No, Sacramento is not the greatest place to live in California, but... looking back, I can't say I liked anywhere else that I've lived since high school more than I like it here.  

By comparison:

It's hotter here [sometimes]
It's waaaay more expensive to live here
There are some conservative nutcases here that freak me out
It's really smoggy here in the central valley

AND

I don't give a fuck because it's still the happiest I've ever been with my home.

If we move from here, it won't be further east, I guarantee it.

Honestly, I don't know how Julio can stand being here in the heat all day.  I have trouble dealing with it for just a few hours at a time.  

Last weekend, we went camping on the beach at Half Moon Bay, near San Francisco, because I knew it would be hot.  That turned out to be one of our best weekends ever.  The weekend before, we made the trip to Lake Tahoe.  This time, I had to work Saturday, so that wasn't an option. [It's waaaay hotter this weekend than last weekend, btw].  This is getting old.....I'm tired of living in places that are unbearably hot in the summertime.  There is no way we're going to spend another summer in this fucking furnace.

Both of us like cooler weather and rain, so I figured when I actually get a vacation in September we're going one direction: NORTH.  Nothing is set in stone, but I think we'll go back to Portland, and also check out Seattle and Vancouver, among other things.  And we may even move to one of those cities by next year, who knows?  All I know right now is that we're getting the fuck out of Asscrackmento to someplace where we don't need to have A/C that works to keep us sane.

"event","Getting used to life on the left coast has been interesting, to say the least.  I love it here - it just feels natural to me, in most places out here.  That being said, Sacramento seems to be the exact opposite of every other West Coast city.  Very conservative, almost like a ""big small town"".   It's creepily similar to San Antonio, and not in the good way - lots of closed-minded people live in this area.  Thankfully, we haven't had much contact with those types.  The people I work with are cool, and outside of that, I really don't talk with anyone else besides Julio.

Bitch session:

It's 92 degrees, humid, and the A/C doesn't work.  
It seems like I've been sick since I got here.  
Expenses are piling up, and I'm dead broke for a while here.
Everything necessary for Julio to get a job is in L.A.
I can't think with all the assholes driving past the ""condo"" [read: apartment] with no mufflers.

So what's the point, right?  Here it is:  I don't think we're staying in Sac-town.  It's fine for now, but I think both of us want to be in a bigger city.  The real question is where, though.....  San Francisco?  L.A.?  Seattle?  They all have positive and negative aspects.  Affordabilty is going to be a huge problem if I stay at my current job.  Hence, I'm interviewing somewhere else this week.  If I like it, there's the possibility of having a nice commisioned sales job that supposedly averages around six figures a year.  And maybe the sense of direction that seems to have gotten lost in the last few months.

Since that's all I really have to complain about, I must say this is a much better situation than a year ago, or even six months ago.  Things are slowly going to get better, I think.

I'll keep the situation posted here, provided anyone actually reads this."

Back in February, I drove from Tampa to Napa to be with my one and only, Julio.  It was great at first, but that wore off and reality hit.  Simply put, <u><b>Napa sucks</b></u>.  That house gave me health problems [bronchitis, anyone?], and his family was not any help to us at all.  So, after a couple months of that hell, we're here in Sacramento now, where there's actually things to do.  The only good thing about Napa is that the need to get out of there sent us on several road trips that went further than expected.

First it was Reno and Lake Tahoe, when we were originally just going to Sacramento to the mall.  Then we were supposed to go camping at the Redwoods, but weather problems made us keep going, and we ended up spending the night in Vancouver, Washington [suburb of Portland].  We also made several trips to San Francisco, which was really cool.  We were supposed to go camping at the beach about 2 weeks ago too, but I fcuked my car up, so that didn't happen...it's still in the shop, too. :-(

I'm still working at the same job, but I just cut my commute from 65 miles to 5 when we moved to Asscramento.  This is going to save us money big time, so we should be able to afford life in Northern California now."

I decided I would go walk along the railroad tracks near my house to see why ATV's are constantly going back there.  As it turns out, there's a pretty extensive trail system back there.  I had been walking a lot longer than I had anticipated when I figured out I was now walking along a ""hilltop""[aka edge of a phosphate mine] near the road.  So, I go to the bottom of the hill so I can walk by the road.  There was a small stream running alongside the road, which I figured I could easily get past.  Not wanting to get my jeans dirty, I grabbed onto a tree limb and swung out over the creek.  

The limb was rotted...it broke and I landed in the mud, then promptly began sinking.  First to my shins...then my knees...then I panicked and grabbed the trunk of a small tree nearby.  It snapped.  I reached out as far as I could and grabbed the trunk of the tree I had used to swing out, and barely mustered the strength to get out.  Even though I was about 15 feet from the road, nobody would have ever seen me, because the brush alongside the road is too thick. To make matters worse, I got Julio mad at me because we were talking on the phone [headset] when I pulled this little stunt.  I don't think I'll be wearing that pair of jeans again...

I came in and sat at my desk to get ready for the day.  My boss comes over and tells me ""come see me as soon as you log in at 9:30"".  Oh, great....here it comes, I'm thinking.  Sure enough, she tells me ""let's go to the conference room so we can talk about something in private.""  At this point, I'm wondering if I have to take the ""walk of shame"", but I play like everything is OK.  So we sit down in the conference room, and the conversation went something like this:

""<b>So, how serious are you about going to California?</b>""  
""<i>serious.</i>""
""<b>Do you want to go like right now?</b>""
""If it was possible, yea.""
""<b>Ok. Well, I want to make sure that you're serious about this company before I make any recommendations.  Is your attendance lately an isolated incident, or am I wasting my time trying to help you get better at this job?</b>""
""I don't usually have such a big problem with it.""
""<b>OK, good.  Because Robert was in San Antonio earlier this week, and he talked to the AVP of the Sacramento office, and it turns out they have a position available.  If that's something you'd be interested in, I can speak with that manager out there and see if we can't work something out for you.</b>""
""Wow, are you serious about this?  I was prepared to wait for a while"" [total bullshit, since I have a phone interview set up with another company in Vallejo]
""<b>Of course - I wouldn't play with you like that.  I told him about your situation, and he asked about it for you.</b>""

I'm floored by all this, of course....not at all what I expected.  So uhhh, looks like things are finally falling into place the way I want them to. :-)

There were a lot of things that annoyed the hell out of me today, but it's ok - I feel good."

"event","The plan is gonna work this time, damnit.  I talked to my manager Lisa the other day and got the process started on transferring to the Sacramento office.  This, of course, is a temporary solution - unless there's a nice pay increase[doubtful].  Then I turned around and almost fucked the plan over by myself tonight....I'm sooooooo thankful that cop only gave me a warning for driving like an asshole.

So, I changed phone numbers....I switched to Verizon so I wouldn't be charged an arm and leg for talking to Julio constantly. :-P  Actually, I was just getting tired of having a $90 bill on a $40 plan with Sprint, even before I talked to Julio.  Bastards.

Speaking of Julio, he seems much happier where he's living now than he did when he was in L.A.  Knowing this makes things a little more bearable for me.

I'm developing a resume now that I'm going to send to a lot of potential employers in Cali - because you can never make enough money...or work close enough to home, hahaha.  I think I'm finally getting a handle on my financial situation....in fact, I'm doing what I can to pay my car off before the move.  On that note, I also got a quote on moving my car insurance out there - $500 cheaper for 6 months.  It puts a smile on my face to know that things are getting better finally.

Looks like we'll end up living in Fairfield or Vacaville, at least until I can get a job around the Vallejo/Napa area.  He's working at a restaurant in Napa now, so things are looking good on his end - now I just have to hold up my end of this.

I had a nightmare the other night.....I came home from work one night, and someone had broken in and shot him.  Worst feeling I've ever known - I woke up crying like a fucking baby.  At this point, I'd rather die than be without him - it's scary how serious this whole thing has become, but it's just happened naturally, as if it was meant to be.

I went to the Bucs game the other day [playoff game].  It was nowhere near as cool as I thought it would be.  Bunch of drunk assholes yelling obscenities at each other because they like different teams....real important stuff. </sarcasm>

Thinking about everything is kinda stressful, but at least now things are starting to <b>happen.</b>  I'm hoping that the SF bay area will finally be my permanent home....there are plans in my mind to attend either UC-Berkeley or Stanford further down the road, then get a nice job in Silicon Valley, but we'll see how it all pans out.  I'm ready to settle down and have some constants in my life, so I've got pretty high hopes for this move.  That 48-hour drive is gonna be brutal, but I'll finally put Florida behind me for good. 

Damn, being in love made me industrious.

Quick update on the situation:

--Didn't hear what I wanted to about a transfer at work.  Namely, the salary doesn't change to accomodate cost of living if I make a lateral move.
--Can't afford to maintain my standard of living and rent an apartment around here.
--Naturally, desperation and stress are taking over.
--Applying for jobs at other insurance companies now - all over the west coast[from San Diego to Seattle].
--I got more stuff than I ever have before at Christmas, but I'd give it all back for one day with Julio.  He got a cell phone for Christmas, which turned out to be my favorite present.
--I'm sick....I think it's stress-related, cuz I'm about to go out of my mind.
--I need to get out of here.
--I need <b>him.</b>

My manager got wind of my plan to move to Phoenix....surprisingly, it seems like she's totally cool with it.  I dunno why I thought there would be problems on that end, I guess I'm just so used to the way most of corporate america operates.

Not so surprisingly, I've run into other snags [things can never just go right for me].  I'm paying my own car insurance as of now [damn near $300 a month], and my old roommate wants me to help with two months rent[~$350/month] because of not giving the proper 60 days notice.  That's $650 in extra bills per month, so as of now I'm pretty depressed and I'm starting to lose faith in my plan.  I'm going to clean up my car really well tomorrow, and then go look at used cars.  If I can get out from under my car payment, maybe I can still make this work.  I still forsee about another year of hard times financially, but then things really start to clear up.  Just when I thought I was finally getting caught up on everything, too......this has to be unfair on some level.

1. car payment goes away[june, or possibly sooner]
2. raises at work[first one in february]
3. my accident drops off my insurance record[a year down the road]
4. i get additional insurance discounts when i turn 25

I can't believe how fucking expensive apartments have gotten around here....if it weren't for that, I would just bring Julio here and be content with that for a while.  I swear, I should be more stressed out about this than I feel......I guess I just have this feeling that things will work out somehow.  I just can't think of how.....my plan is totally fucked as of now.

This is totally new to me, because I'm used to being very laid back, and not caring that much.  I guess it's what happens when you realize that you've found someone that you want to spend your whole life with.  The next few months are going to be spent getting things in order for myself, until it's finally time to make the big move.  Lately I've found myself being a more responsible driver, being very early everywhere I need to be[like I was when I was much younger], keeping a careful eye on my [almost drained] bank account, thinking about ways to improve my health and safety, and other little things I can do to possibly raise the quality of the life we will have out there.  I only hope all of this can help me give him a better life than he's had so far...but I'm just unsure - afraid it may not be enough.  Maybe it's just the fact that I've been moving so much the last 3 years(next week makes 6 addresses over that time), but I doubt it.....

So what I did was use a list of all the USAA offices, and came up with only two solutions that really made any sense.  It's much different from my prior thinking, but these are the most workable solutions.  A trimmed down version of the list is below.

<b>Tampa</b> - high housing costs, too far from everything I want to see and do, possible snags with bringing Julio here.
<b>Norfolk</b> - Not even under consideration...I hate the east coast.
<b>San Antonio</b> - Too far from everything I want to see and do.  There's the ""hometown"" factor, but still, ugh.
<b>Colorado Springs</b> - This one was intriguing: I love Colorado, but I can't really see myself doing the small-town thing.  However, the southern suburbs of Denver are only like 45 minutes away from the office.  Hence, this one has an outside shot.
<b>Sacramento</b> - high housing costs, lame city. even higher housing costs an hour away in the bay area.
<b>Phoenix</b> - The strongest option of them all, because of reasonable housing costs and actually being in a pretty good city, far enough west for me to like the location. And one more thing: there's waaaay more jobs available in the Phoenix office than any of the other branches outside of SA.

So there you have it.  Incredibly hot, or incredibly cold?  I think it's obvious which way I'm leaning, but I'd appreciate feedback from anyone else who might care, or know something about those areas...

Just as my parents did for the past year, I'm quickly figuring out that finding housing in this town is:
A. Damn near impossible to find anything available
B. When you do find something that's available, it's uber expensive.

I guess maybe I thought the situation wouldn't be as bad with apartments as it is for houses, but I was dead wrong.  I found a couple of promising places, the most notable being across the street from Bloomingdale High School.  I'm willing to bet I already know some people that live in that complex.  Still, there were none available, and there may not be until much later than I need it for...why does there have to be a roadblock at every turn?

One complex I went to.....I sat in the waiting room for 15 minutes, and an older couple walked in and got helped right away, while I only received dirty looks.  As I was leaving that complex, somebody made their own left turn lane by going left of me, and almost causing a wreck by refusing to take the left lane once we got on the road.  Fucking moron.  Definitely not going back to that place.  

I found some cheaper apartments that are most likely available, but they're ghetto as hell(nextdoor to Sam's club).

It definitely wasn't this hard to find an apartment in San Antonio.  EVERY SINGLE APARTMENT COMPLEX IN BRANDON is booked solid.  ridiculous.  wtf has possessed people to <b>want</b> to move here after all the hurricanes the last couple of years?  Not that I don't know the answer, it just seems pointless to me.  I'm absolutley positive my parents would never let me have a live-in boyfriend under their roof, so I've been reduced to doing this.

"event","The wind is howling pretty bad outside - I think the Tropical Storm warning was warranted at this point.  Funny, cuz it was dead calm when I went to sleep last night.  It's supposed to start getting cold late this afternoon when Wilma clears out of here, so that's definitely something to look forward to.  I haven't lost power, except for a really brief moment last night....so this has been like another typical tropical storm here - lots of rain, but pretty tame overall.
They delayed the building's opening until 10am(<b>why?</b> it's gonna be just as bad then...), but I've still got to go to work in a bit.  Hopefully I like this better than Home Depot, since I kinda have my whole plan riding on it."

"event","And it will be answered soon after waking up tomorrow, when I find out whether or not USAA is closing the building...not to mention how nasty the weather may get around here.  Stupid hurricane...

Anyway -

USAA may not really be my ""job of the future"" when I move - it's just too soon to tell whether I'm going to stay on after I move or not.  I've already been checking the job listings for the West Coast, and I'm starting to like the sound of a few other places.
One thing is very clear, though - I'm not staying in Tampa any longer than I have to.  My heart is definitely telling me to go elsewhere, like <b>never</b> before.  I can see the light at the end of the tunnel for the first time in forever...

Teh writing bug strieks again!!!1



Healing old wounds has never been easy.
For what seems like eternity
the scars left deep inside my soul
were the only thing my heart would see

remaining behind, with my only companions
agonized thoughts and tortured dreams
nothing like this can ever heal, can it?
I asked this too early, it would seem.

It's you -
you run through my veins
you got me dancing in the rain
Only you -
staring through the window,
I wonder where we'll go

One day all of the habits would change
a new light peered into the deepest part of me
when you found me trapped in my mental cell
I knew you came to set me free

It's you - 
your voice runs through my veins
you made everything change
Only you -
staring through my window,
I can see where we'll go

because you made it so.
you made it so
from our first hello
you made it so
when you took control
my life, my plans,
my dreams renewed
and all of it
because of you

It's you -
your kiss runs in my veins
your touch takes away my pain
Only you -
once I wondered where to go
because of you, now I know."

The good thing is, I went to the grocery store yesterday to stock up on supplies. Today, there's probably a massive run on the stuff.
Can't it just go away?"

"event","No more home depot as of right now.  I'm starting my new job in a week anyway, so I'm going to enjoy the time in between. Heck, I might take a little road trip.

Speaking of which, I'll be in Chattanooga thanksgiving weekend. This is exciting, because I haven't been to see my family up there in like 3 years. 

On to the ""I knew it would happen"" part.  So, as previously mentioned, I think I've fallen for a boy in California....that, and my love of California's natural beauty has recently made my thoughts return to moving there. My new job is going to pay me enough so that I can save up for the move, but the hitch is going to be finding a decent job once I get there.  As of now, the Australia plan has been abandoned.......but stay tuned. Tampa just isn't ""home"" anymore....

"event","Over the last 3 weeks, I've slowly been cutting meat out of my diet.  Now I've decided to stick to a pretty strict vegetarin diet, because it did what I wanted it to. Well, that and lifting weights 3 times a week have given me results.  

I'm going to dye my hair back to its natural color.  I decided it was too much to keep up with, so there. update - the bitch told me it would be better just to cut it off to where the natural color starts....now I have barely any hair.

I'm going to Publix later to see about getting a part-time job doing what I used to do there. This will help me pay off all my bills quicker so I can save up to get out of here. :-)

Moving into the new house the 2nd week of November.

Yea, that about covers it.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v101/halo382/bigsur5.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

That trip still hasn't left my mind.  I think about how much I loved it out there everyday. But I'm stuck here in flat, humid, overrated Florida where I grew up.  I swore I would never come back, but here I am.  OK, time to go get myself a part-time job so I can really save some money for leaving this place....."

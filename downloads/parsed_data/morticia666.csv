"event","Her hair was up in a pony tail, her favorite dress 
tied with a  bow.
>
Today was Daddy's Day at school, and she couldn't
 wait to go.
>
But her mommy tried to tell her, that she probably
should stay home.
>
Why the kids might not understand, if she went to
school alone.
>
But she was not afraid; She knew just what to say.
>
What to tell her classmates of why he wasn't there
 today.
>
But still her mother worried, for her to face this
day alone.
>
And that was why once again, she tried to keep her
daughter home.
>
But the little girl went to school, eager to tell
them all.
>
About a dad she never sees a dad who never calls.
>
There were daddies along the wall in back, for
everyone to  meet.
>
Children squirming impatiently, anxious in their
 seats.
>
One by one the teacher called, a student from the
class.
>
To introduce their daddy, as seconds slowly passed.
>
At last the teacher called her name, every child
turned to  stare.
>
Each of them was searching, for a man who wasn't
 there.
>
""Where's her daddy at?"" she heard a boy call out.
>
""She probably doesn't have one,"" another student
dared to shout
>
And from somewhere near the back, she heard a daddy
say,
>
""Looks  like another deadbeat dad, too busy to
 waste his day.""
>
  The words did not offend her, as she smiled up at 
 her Mom.
>
And looked back at her teacher, who told her to go
on.
>
And with hands behind her back, slowly she began to
speak.
>
And out from the mouth of a child, came words
incredibly unique.
>
""My Daddy couldn't be here, because he lives so far
 away.
>
But I know he wishes he could be, since this is
such a special day.
>
And though you cannot meet him, I wanted you to
 know.
>
 All about my daddy, and how much he loves me so.
>
He loved to tell me stories he taught me to ride my
bike.
>
He surprised me with pink roses, and taught me to
 fly a kite.
>
We used to share fudge sundaes, and ice cream in a
cone.
>
And though you cannot see him,  I'm not standing
 here alone.
>
""Cause my daddy's always with me, even though we
are apart
>
I  know because he told me, he'll forever be in my
heart""
>
With that, her little hand reached up, and lay
across her chest.
>
Feeling her own heartbeat, beneath her favorite 
dress.
>
And from somewhere in the crowd of dads, her mother
 stood in tears.
>
Proudly watching her daughter, who was wise beyond
 her years.
>
For she stood up for the love of a man not in her
 life.
>
Doing what was best for her, doing what was right.
>
And when she dropped her hand back down, staring
straight into the crowd.
>
She finished with a voice so soft, but its message
clear and loud.
>
 ""I love my daddy very much, he's my shining star.
>
 And if he could, he'd be here, but heaven's just
 too far.
>
You see he was a fireman and died just this past
year
>
 When airplanes hit the towers  and taught Americans
to fear.
>
But sometimes when I close my eyes, it's like he
 never went  away.""
>
 And then she closed her eyes, and saw him there
 that day.
>
 And to her mother's amazement, she witnessed with
 surprise.
>
A room full of daddies and children, all starting
 to close their eyes.
>
Who knows what they saw before them, who knows what
 they felt inside.
>
Perhaps for merely a second, they saw him at her
side.
>
""I know you're with me Daddy,"" to the silence she
called out.
>
And what happened next made believers, of those
once filled with doubt.
>
Not one in that room could explain it, for each of
their eyes had been closed.
>
But there on the desk beside her, was a fragrant
long-stemmed  pink rose.
>
>       And a child was blessed, if only for a moment, by
> the love of her shining bright star.
>
And given the gift of believing, that heaven is
never too far.
>
They say it takes a minute to find a special
person, An hour to appreciate
>
them, a day to love them, but then an entire life
to forget them."

Where's the sense in that?

Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and destruction to come back again

I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules that ""it's over""

"event","I saw you at the mall
Trying on the clothes
In that little blue stall
I was watching your feet
Then a piece of cheese hit the floor
Ohhh yeah Floor
Chorus:I'm just a punk princess
Trying to make it through this life
Trying to make everything alright
But all I can picture is the cheese
Ooh yeah cheese
Why must you make me hurt so much?
Why must you eat so much cheese at lunch?
Why don't you just die, and leave me here like I was
DIE! DIE!! DIE!!! DIE!!!!!! Die like the Japs at Hiroshima when the atom 
bomb hit their face and then they died
(chorus)
Actually don't die because that's mean, 
and because MTV will break their contract with me
So don't die
Pleash?
Pleash is a word, invented in Spain
Pleash was invented to symbolize the pain
The pain that you've put me through
The pain that I've gained
But if you die, it will all go away
All go away
All go away
But actually don't die pleash, because I kinda like you a little still
But not a lot, just a speck
Like the cheese that's left after I've raided through the fridge
Why must you remind me of cheese?
I love cheese but not you
I only love you a little
Only a speck






Na na
Na na na na na na
I miss you
I miss you so bad
I don't forget you
Oh it's so sad
I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

Chorus

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found
It won't be the same
Oh
Na na
Na na na na na
I didn't get around to kiss you
Goodbye on the hand
I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't
I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

Chorus

I've had my wake up
Won't you wake up
I keep asking why
I can't take it
It wasn't fake
It happened you passed by
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
There you go
There you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
There you go
There you go
Somewhere you're not coming back

Chorus

Na na
Na na na na na na
I miss you


I cannot find 
A way to describe it
It's there
Inside
All I do is hide
I wish
That it
Would just go away
What would
You do?
You do...
If you knew...
What would you do?

(YEAH)

All the pain
I thought I knew
All my thoughts lead back to you
Back to what
Was never said
Back and forth
Inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable
Come and take me away

I feel
Like I
Am all alone
All by
Myself
I need to get around this
My words 
Are cold
I don't want them to hurt you
If I
Show you
I don't think you'd understand
Cause no one understands

(YEAH)

All the pain
I thought I knew
All my thoughts lead back to you
Back to what
Was never said
Back and forth
Inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable
Come and take me away

I'm going nowhere
On and on and...
I'm getting nowhere
On and on and on...
Take me away
I'm going nowhere
On and on and...
Off and on and
Off and on

All the pain
I thought I knew
All my thoughts lead back to you
Back to what
Was never said
Back and forth
Inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable
Come and take me away

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away


Something just isn't right
I can feel it inside
The truth isn't far behind me
You can't deny

When I turn the lights out
When I close my eyes
Reality overcomes me
I'm living a lie

When I'm alone
I, feel so much better
And when I'm around you
I don't feel

[chorus:]
Together! It doesn't feel right at all
Together! Together we built a wall
Together! Holding hands will fall
Hands will fall

This has gone on so long
I realize that I need
Something good to rely on
Something for me

When I'm alone
I, feel so much better
And when I'm around you
I don't feel

Chorus

My heart is broken
I'm lying here
My thoughts are choking
On you, my dear
On you, my dear
On you, my dear

When I'm alone
I, feel so much better
And when I'm around you
I don't feel

Chorus(2x)

When I'm around you
When I'm around you

I don't feel together
I don't feel together

When I'm around you(Together!)
When I'm around you(Together!)
I don't feel together
No
I don't feel together



Dont worry boy I'm doing fine at least right now
Why won't you tell me why you always got to play hard-to-get
You've always been the kinda boy I never liked
Until one day I looked into your eyes, 
And saw the boy,I never loved until this day,
You tell me,

{chorus}
And I need you and you told me that
Some things won't last forever,
But we both know we need each,
So boy,I'm staying strong,
Now...you can tell me that thing that,
You said we weren't that ready for,
Come on,girl,were only in the fifth grade,
Just tell me please,just this time,
Cuz we're both staying strong

You keep a secret from me something only boys should know,
If you really loved me,you could tell me anything
So I still love you,if you're wondering,
Cuz that wouldn't be me,to say something like that,
Cuz thats not me,

Look boy,I'm staying strong,
So whats all of your worry about?
You're just too scared for me,
There's nothing.....about me..to get upset about,
Its so not you,so get out



Am I dreamin' or stupid?
I think I've been hit by Cupid
But no one needs to know right now


I met a tall, dark and handsome man
And I've been busy makin' big plans
But no one needs to know right now


I got my heart set, my feet wet
And he don't even know it yet
But no one needs to know right now


I'll tell him someday some way somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now


I want bells to ring, a choir to sing
The white dress the guests the cake the car the whole darn thing
But no one needs to know right now


I'll tell him someday some way somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now


We'll have a little girl a little boy
A little Benji we call Leroy
But no one needs to know right now


And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only only he can make it right


And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only only he can make it right


I'm not dreamin' or stupid
But boy have I been hit by Cupid
But no one needs to know right now


No one needs to know right now...


Watching your house shrink away in my rear-view mirror 
As I drive away 
Wishing that I could take back all those words 
That meant nothing that I didn't say

I'm trying 
To be what you want me to be 
But it's so damn hard to keep playing the part 
Of the fool, week after week

I think you need some time alone (I think you need some time alone) 
You say you want someone to call your own 
Open your eyes, you can suck in your pride 
You can live your life all on your own

Is this all going to be just another time 
That we play this game? 
I've tried to convince you that things could be different 
But somehow they end up the same

But what 
Did you expect from me? What am I supposed to do? 
You say that you're starting to feel like you're getting lost 
Well, I do, too

I don't wanna live this lie again (I don't wanna live this lie again) 
I know I'll get it right but I don't know when 
I'll open my eyes, I've got something in side 
I'll just jack off in my room until then

It's never over 'til it's done 
And I don't think that you're the one 
It's never over 'til it's done 
And I don't think that you're the one


I'm tuggin' at my hair
I'm pullin' at my clothes
I'm tryin to keep my cool
I know it shows

I'm staring at my feet
My cheeks are turning red
I'm searching for the words inside my head

I'm feeling nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it--yeah

If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I want to blow you--away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down--on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

It don't do me any good it's just a waste of time
What use is it to you what's on my mind
If ain't comin out we're not going anywhere
So why can't I just tell you that I care

Cause I'm feeling nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
Cause I know your worth it

If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I want to blow you--away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down--on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

What's wrong with my tongue
These words keep slipping away
I stutter I stumble like I've got nothing to say

Cause I'm feeling nervous
Trying to be so perfect 
Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it--yeah

Was it something I did? 
Was it something You said? 
Don't leave me hanging 
In a city so dead 
Held up so high 
On such a breakable thread 

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be 

CHORUS 
You were everything, everything that I wanted 
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it 
All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away 
All this time you were pretending 
So much for my happy ending 
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

You've got your dumb friends 
I know what they say 
They tell you I'm difficult 
But so are they 
But they don't know me 
Do they even know you? 
All the things you hide from me 
All the shit that you do 

You were all the things I thought I knew 
And I thought we could be 

CHORUS 

It's nice to know that you were there 
Thanks for acting like you cared 
And making me feel like I was the only one 
It's nice to know we had it all 
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done 

CHORUS X 2 

oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh"

"event","You held my hand and walked me home, I know
Why you gave me the kiss, it was something like this, it made me go oh oh
You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears, why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love, guys are so hard to trust

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that
Girls the one who gives it all away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do, and cry
Don't try to tell me what to do, don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way

Don't think that your charmin' and the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants, I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget
I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but i'm really upset,really upset.
Get outta my head, get off of my bed, yeah that's what I said

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that
Girl the one who throws it all away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time
Did you think it was something I was gonna do, and cry
Don't try to tell me what to do, don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way

This guilt trip that you put me on won't mess me up cuz I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time
Did you think it was something I was gonna do and cry
Don't try to tell me what to do, don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way

Better off that way
I'm better off alone anyway"

telling me to stop waiting 
waiting for your responce, or am i confused ...are they tellin me to  hold on?
i anticipate your answer .yes or no?. love or hate?

my wrists are scarred
my heart is dying
thoughts of you fill my head once more
but all i want is for you to see that i luv u!!
and the pain ive caused others by likeing you
its to bad for them because im still gonna love you!!
the saftey pins knives and razor blades i live by and hope to die by

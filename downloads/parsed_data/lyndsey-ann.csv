"event","<P>so last night.. in a nutshell... sucked. </P>
<P>me and ac had planned to have a day/night together, just the 2 of us. and a little bit after i got there he gave me a ring that he had got me for our 6 months anniversary (which was like... almost 4 months ago, but anyways) and its a beautiful ring, i love it. <IMG style=""WIDTH: 108px; HEIGHT: 97px"" height=160 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v354/ButtShakinBarbie/ring.jpg"" width=226></P>
<P>and then we went and bought kill bill 2 and ac thought that it was extremely important that amanda see it right then whenever we did so we went to one of liz's houses and saw kyle and john and then went back to ac's and then went to liz's house and kyle john tony bailey kyle and nick and amanda were there. and we just hung out for a little bit and then liz wanted people to stay the night because she didn't feel safe (her next door neighbors-long story) and so we stayed there for even longer. and i was getting pissed off and not even talking to ac at this point cause this was supposed to be a day where we spent alone, but it ended up like every other day we've planned and turned into us hanging out with everyone else. </P>
<P>we took tony and nick home and then went back to liz's and finally watched kill bill around like midnight and then around 2 it started raining and im just like can we please now? (cause im pissed.. bored out of my mind and my car was at ac's getting wet cause the window was down)and then amanda started talking about will and then like half an hour later i was like can we go? (again) and then like 10 minutes later, we finally left. and then we drove back to ac's house and we argued for like half an hour and then just talked for a while about a buncha stuff. and argued and talked some more and then finally fell asleep around 5 or so. </P>
<P>woke up this morning and stayed in bed.. for like ever. and then we watched a dvd of aqua teen hunger force.. *bleh* and then we watched tv and then i went home and fell asleep and now im here. i have to babysit so i can't do anything. and i asked ac to stop by but he's gonna start packing with amanda and johnny..</P>
<P>&nbsp;and why does amanda always have to be with him? GOOD QUESTION.. grr.</P>

"event","<P>hmm.. so the past week has ben very eventful. lemme tell ya what.</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""my sergery story.""></P>
<P>Tuesday morning, i woke up and my stomach hurt like extremely bad. and i thought it might be cramps or something, so i kind of ignored it for a little bit. and then it just kept getting worse and worse. and my mom called the doctor and she said that it might be my appendicks or something so she told me to come in. so i went to the dr. and i had to give blood. and i went into the office and she checked my stomach and stuff and she told me it might be my appendicks and it might be stones in my gullbladder or something. so they had to do some tests on my blood. and i haven't given blood since i was 2 because when i was little i always threw a complete hissy fit when i got blood drawn, so when the dr. told me i had to give blood i just started crying and then my mom started crying. so i did that. and they said my white blood cells were really high so that most likely meant appendicitis, so she told me i had to get an x-ray of my tummy to see what was goin on.</P>
<P>so i went and got this ct scan done and they told me i had appendicitis. and so i went to mcdonalds cause i hadn't had anything to eat. and i only ate like half a hamburger (which later i found out i wasn't supposed to eat at all, but oh well) so i got checked into the hospital around 6:30-7 &nbsp;and we just kinda sat around for a while. and my family dr. told me that i would be getting the surgery probably wednesday morning, well when we saw the dr. at the hospital he said that i would be getting the surgery around 1-2 in the morning.. and if i wouldn't have eaten i'd be getting it sooner. so yeah. i was like miserable for a couple hours.. crying off and on at just the thought of having surgery n stuff..and they came and hooked me up with an iv and i got changed.&nbsp;and around 1 o clock the dr. came in and started talking to me about the surgery procedure and all that.. and they took me on that bed on wheels you always see in the movies and shows, and wheeled me down to the waiting room thingy and my g-ma, my mom and my dad stood there and talked to me for about an hour while we were waiting. </P>
<P>around 2 in the morning they were finally ready so they wheeled me into the surgery room and they put me on the bed and put an oxygen mask on my face and then they put something in my iv that stung the shit out of my arm. and then they never told me when they gave me the anaesthesia but they never told me to count down or anything. so i don't remember goin out.. but i woke up in the recovery room and i kept throwing up and freaking out, cause they had an oxygen mask on me. and i couldn't cough or clear my throat cause it hurt to do so and so they nurses were all freaking out cause they thought i couldn't breathe and they kept shoving the mask over my mouth and i kept trying to rip it off and it was just a big mess. and i guess the anaesthesia did something to me and so i kept throwing up and getting sick. </P>
<P>i finally got back to my room around 4 or 5 and i kept falling asleep so my parents left to go check up on my brother and then i woke up around 8:30 and they gave me morphine and stuff and told me i should try to drink some stuff but everytime i drank something i would thow it up. so i just gave up on drinking and eating. and i just sat in my bed, sore as hell. and my parents came back. and i finally got to see my tummy.. i have a little cut on the bottom of my belly button (which i think&nbsp;looks horrible)&nbsp;where they put a little camera and then one little cut about 5 inches below my belly button and then another cut to (my left) about 6-7 inches. and yeah. the scars are gonna suck. but oh well. and so everyone left around 3 and then ac came and saw me and brought me a card and some candy, and then he went and got something to eat and then came back and i kept falling asleep so he just left. and then about an hour later mandy gloria and wendy came by. and they were being so funny, which was gay cause it hurt so bad to laugh lol. but im glad that they came by. it made me happy. and then ac came back cause he forgot his jacket. and then my mom came back around 9:30 after she got off of work. and i talked to her for a while and i cried some more cause i was really really homesick and just wanted to get out of the hospital. and they made me try to drink again and .. again.. i threw it up. and so my mom left and i finally got to sleep.. but nurses and people kept waking me up wanting my temperature and blood pressure and crap like that. </P>
<P>Yesterday morning. i got tortured. these 2 medical students came in around 5 in the morning and the guy switched on this bright ass light and the girl came over and started askin me a buncha stupid questions and then asked to see my wounds and so i showed her and she started to take off the bandaids and i was like no don't do that it hurts (not even the nurses or the dr.'s have asked to see them-why would she need to see them?) and she was like oh, its okay i'll be quit and ripped them off i was like oh my fucking god. i was pissed. i wanted to rip her head off. and then they left. and then my nurse came in and gave me a laxitive, which is dumb cause i had nothing in my stomach to make me poop.. so whatever. ( i'm sure you all wanted to hear that) and he told me that the loratabs that i had ben taking might be whats making me sick so she gave me some perkasets and some nausea medicine. and then i could finally drink and i ate some crackers and half a donut. so i finally got&nbsp;permission to go home. so they took my iv out and i got dressed and they wheeled me down to my moms van and i finally got to go home!</P>
<P>it felt so much better to be home. i'm still like extremely sore but yeah. ac came over last night which was great. so he just hung out with me&nbsp;for a while and then i just fell asleep after a while.&nbsp;sleeping&nbsp;was hell though cause my bed is so uncomfortable when you can only lay on your back. so that sucked. and i woke up this morning and ate a lunchable thingy and took a pain pill which made me feel great. so its all good right now. so.. okay that's my whole story if your still reading.. cause it was pretty&nbsp;damn&nbsp;long! lol.</P>

<P>me and mandy have just ben going to john's and 'partying' with everyone over there. i normally don't drink or smoke (weed) because&nbsp;of mishaps i have ended up in during previous drunken times. and let's say that i just don't wanna repeat&nbsp;ANY of that crap. <STRONG>but anyways..</STRONG>&nbsp; last night i drank. i yes, i am a light-weight.. a cheap drunk you could say but hey.. i haven't drank in i'd say 3 or 4 months so yes, my 3-4 beers and a smirnoff&nbsp;got me drunk.</P>
<P>and when i get drunk, i get emotional so of course i had to call ac's phone and leave a sappy ass message. *shrugs* that's just what lyndsey does.. she cries and gets horny.. ha.. anywho.</P>
<P>we got back to mandy's and watched the movie Thirteen.. pretty good movie. trippy. and the girls on there are actually 13 and in 7th grade and they're doing shit i would never do in my life. </P>

my parents are being big gaping assholes so i haven't really ben outside of my house in a while with the exception of last night and all i did was go swimming with mandy and then drop by ac's and went swimming again. gloria and justin showed up.. and i guess they got back together.. hopefully it will be better this time around. me and mandy were gonna go to the derby days carnival but we got there too late, so we just went back to ac's and hung out for a while and then i took mandy to gloria's and went back to ac's and we just sat around and watched adult swim till i had to go home. fun sunday nights.

today i went and saw the harry potter movie. pretty good i guess but this new director leaves out alot details.. which was kinda gay cause thats what pulls a movie to be as good as the book. but oh well, im not one to critisize.

welp, my mom says im not allowed to leave the house for a good couple days and i got in trouble last night because i was sunburnt. it makes so much sence now...

"event","im so unbelievably tired. im sitting in my biology class right now, we're supposed to be looking up nutritional facts and contents and blah blah blah. yes, interesting i know. im thinking about just laying my head down and taking a nap, and telling the teacher i have the whole project already done at my house. He keeps leaving the room.. c'mon now.

anywho. i think me and lindsey have set a basic date of when im goni to florida. june 28-july 7/8.. yay. excitement is setting in. i remember last year about 2-3 weeks from now i was like peeing my pants i just couldn't wait to get down there. whee hee.

i just took this body calculator thing that told me that im over weight.. :( this makes me sad. im gonna go cry now.

i went shopping yesterday and gotta bunch of clothes. 

it smells weird in this classroom, very manly i suppose. hm..

so this weekend.. really kinda sucked the big one. On friday, me and gloria just went to the mall and walked around forever just looking and then went back home and chilled for a while and then around 10/11 we went to johns and i got to see ac for like.. half an hour or so and then i had to be home by 12 so we went back home. 

on saturday me gloria and dana went to the last day at river fest for the fireworks and what not. oh my goodness, way WAY too many people there.. on the radio this morning they said that like 180,000 people were there last night. well we walked around from like 7-11 pm doing almost absolutly nothing. we went to the carnival at first and rode like 2 rides and then walked around and tried to find people. 

we found a bunch on stoner hill.. haha, go figure. anyways, we were supposed to meet gloria's mom, amber and baby girl before the fireworks and they didn't take the cell with them so we couldn't find them and we were walking around for hours trying to find them, well we just so happen to walk down this road and gloria's mom is sitting there in traffic.. so we jumped in and then i guess amber had gotten out of the car to go look for us about 2 hours before. so we looked for her for a while and finally found her and then gloria's mom yelled at us and we got back and i called ac and he came and picked me up a little bit later. 

then we just sat and johns for a while doing mostly nothing. and then i passed out early cause i was exhausted and in a not-so-good mood. and me and ac passed out on the couch.. side by side and neither one of us fell off. im still trying to figure that one out. oh well.

on sunday i woke up at johns and went outside and smoked a cig with jo and tony and then came in and watched this movie, drunken master.. which is kinda dumb (sorry to all those guys that love it) but yeah and then we sat around some more and i took ac's truck to mcdonalds and then he took me home for a little bit around noon and then me and my mom went to the mall and got our shopping on. i <3 shopping. 

okay yeah, that's about all i got for now.. i'm thinking hard about that nap and i think im gonna make it happen.

hope this was good enough for you andrew.

"event","well i haven't updated in a while.

cause theres nothing really to update about.

this weekend was kinda gay. on friday i just stayed home cause it was rainy and gloomy and ac had to work and there was nothing to do anyways.

and then on saturday me and mandy went to my aunts wedding reception thing at the mariott. and we were downstairs with a buncha my cousins and her friends smoking a cig and i lit one up and one of my aunts walked up. whoo... lyndsey got in trouble. so my mom found out and i got bitched out a whole bunch and then when we got back me and mandy went to her house and hung out for a while and waited for ac to get off work, and then waited some more till he got home.. so around like 1 or so i went over there and hung out for a little bit then we passed out. 

on sunday i just came home and got bitched at for the ciggarette thing some more. whoopty doo. 

and then tommorrow i gotta stay at the highschool after school for the insurance company to take pictures of the wreck and stuff... fun.

"event","yesterday was by far, one of my worst days ever.

i set out the day with a goal of not being late to school because everyday for the past 2 weeks i have not ben on time. and its never my fault its always someone else's.. well i was late.

and then the school day went alright, i jipped 3rd and 4th block and went and hung out with ac and then went tanning with mandy.

well we went back up to the school to pick up bailey and as i was leaving i got into a wreck. a guy slammed into my side, so i now have a huge ass dent in the right side of my car, the back wont even open its all bent and shit, so i gotta deal with that. the insurance and bullshit like that

and then later on i went to mandy's then to gloria's and we didn't have anything to do, so we decided to go rescue mandy's boyfriend from his family cabin thats like i'd say 60-70 miles away.. and it was all highway and pouring and slick and shit. i was freaking out the whole time thinking i was gonna go into an anxiety attak, cause i was nervous and grinding my teeth and chain smoking like a mother fucker, and when we got back.. i was never happier to see my house.

then a little bit later ac got off work and he came over to gloria's and i was gonna go stay the night with him cause yesterday was our 6 month anniversary, and we stopped by johns for a little bit and he had a couple shots of jack.. he wasn't drunk though. so we left john's stopped back by gloria's and picked up my car and then on the way to his house their was a sobriety/DUI check and i knew he was gonna be screwed. the cop stopped him talked to him for a little bit and was gonna let him go, but he saw the bottle of jack in the back of ac's explorer so he got pulled out and they gave him a breath test and he got like a .125 i think so he got arrested for a DUI and minor in possesion. and i didn't know what to do i was freaking out and crying and i kept driving back by the DUI check point to see what was going on. and the second time i drove by ac was just standing around doing nothing. and then the third time i drove by he was in handcuffs. i lost it i started balling. and i had no where to go, so i got on the pay phone and called mandy twice but no answer. and then i sat in my car for a couple minutes trying to figure out what the fuck i was gonna do.

and then the pay phone rang and i jetted up to that thing faster than ever. and it was tristan (mandy's boyfriend) and i started crying again telling him what had happened and he was like lyndsey calm down everything will be okay, just come over zachs and you'll be fine okay? i was like okay and i headed off to zachs, and i talked to tristan zach and kevin for a while then i went inside and passed out in zachs room and i woke up the next morning and their was like 39487 people in the room for some bullshit and then everyone left and i fell back asleep and then i woke up around 8 or so, and i called ac and his phone was on...so i kept calling and calling hoping that maybe he had gotten out. and he answered and omg i was so relieved. and he was in county jail from 4-9 this morning and they let him out with a court date in a month and his car in the imbpound, so he came over zachs and stayed with me for a while till i had to go home just like half an hour ago, and after i get ready and my mom lets me leave, im gonna go pick him up and we're gonna go get his truck from the impound.. so yeah. 

fabulous night huh?

this weekend kind of sucked, but it was still good at the same time.

on friday me and gloria went to john's with everyone and hung out for a while, didn't drink or smoke or anything and ac couldn't come until after i went home but it was okay.

on saturday me ac and duane hung out at ac's for a little bit and then went and saw the 2nd kill bill movie. good movie.

today, kevin woke me up and and asked if i could go get him from john's and i knew he had had a rough night plus i wanted to get out of the house, so i went and got him and took him home. and then i went to ac's and his mom let me in and i went and woke him up. i only stayed there like 45 minutes or so cause i had to get home but anytime with him is nice :)

so now im just sittin here listening to the wind blow like crazy. it sucks. but oh well

"event","<P>last night put into one word.. was <EM>horrible.</EM></P>
<P>i didn't sleep at all on thursday night because when i breathe it makes my throat hurt so i just stayed up all night, and went to school for 2 hours friday, then came home.. (with a slight stop by ac's first) and last night around 3 o'clock, i just like snapped. i started crying and bawling without end. i needed sleep. desperatly. i was driving myself crazy. around 4 or 5 i finally drifted off to sleep, somehow. then woke up at like 6.. then i laid there trying to sleep again.. then my mom came in around 9, and then i had to take medicine at 11 and now im up and around. </P>
<P>i went to the doctor yesterday because my throat is just bothering me too much and im afraid it will turn into what happened last time. </P>
<P><STRONG>Last time:</STRONG> i had tonsilitus at the beginnning of the school year and i went to my doctor and she gave me some&nbsp;amoxycillon crap and it made it worse and my throat swelled up so bad i could barely breathe so i had to go to the emergency room and i saw this other doctor and he gave me these 3 pills that made my sore throat go away in like a day and a half. i love that doctor. </P>
<P>so yeah.. i went to the doctor yeserday and she perscribes me amoxyicillon.. and i about had a cow. i told her it wasn't going to do anything.. and i told her about last time and she was like you don't have the same thing you did last time blah blah blahddy blah blah. so if&nbsp;my throat gets worse im just gonna go kill the damn doctor. hmph</P>
<P>i need to get out .. if you can't tell. i've ben home since tuesday. i might go to gloria's later if im feeling better. yipee. </P>
<P>so yeah. me and lindsey have our ly/indsey's journals now.... since she's probably the only one thats gonna read mine and vice versa. oh well, you can't all be part of the ly/indsey lovin. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>xo</P>

"event","A group of islanders walks into the office of Dr. Moreau. The group consists of Kaveri, Zach, Billy, and Jamal. Kaveri says to Moreau, ""We have a really amazing act. You should represent us to the mainland and get us a spot on TV.""

Moreau says, ""Sorry, I don't represent animal acts.  Go back to your duplexes.""

Zach says, ""Sir, if you just see our act, we know you would want to represent us.""

Moreau sighs and impatiently taps his pen against the desk, ""Okay, fine. I'll take a look.""
<lj-cut text=""Click here for the rest!"">
The act starts innocently enough, with Jamal bringing in a boombox and turning it on to play Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" and Zach starts to tap-dance along with it.  As he's doing this, Kaveri gets on  her hands and knees and starts fellating Zach, all while humming along with the music.  Jamal takes the cue and takes Kaveri from behind, and Billy sits on her back and starts violating her every other open orifice with his tentacles.  Seeing this, Zach stops dancing and becomes enraged, lunging forward to attack Billy and Jamal.  Kaveri chokes from the sudden movement, gagging on cock while Zach sends a glorious spray of blood all over Moreau's paperwork.

Moreau looks on in quiet horror, nervously hovering his finger over the button controlling the buzzers for these islanders.  Billy howls in pain with fresh claw-marks on his chest, then uses his crutches to catapault himself at Zach and wrap the dragon-man in tentacles, swearing his little octopus heart out while beating on him with his squishy limbs.  Jamal also joins in the dogpile, and soon the three break out in a fight enshrouded in a large dust cloud, just like in cartoons.  Kaveri is still sitting on the floor gagging, having been thrown out of the group when Zach jumped over her to attack Billy and Jamal.  Since vultures are notably terrible at controlling their gag reflexes, she vomits on the floor, providing a slippery puddle of half-digested, decomposing rabbit guts in the way of the other three.  Zach slips on the puddle, sliding forward until he collides with Moreau's desk, getting bent over it and knocking Moreau's pen cup and papers on the floor.  Moreau curls his lip with disgust and scoots back a few inches in his fancy wheeled leather office chair, but still does not activate the buzzers.

Since Zach was expunged from the group, Billy and Jamal stop fighting.  It is then that the door to the office creaks open and Aubrey peeks in, intrigued by the odd, disturbing noises coming from the office.  Before he can do anything else to Zach, Billy spots her, coming over to the door and ushering her in.  Aubrey is hesitant, but wheels herself in anyways despite all common sense telling her not to.  Zach looks over his shoulder from the desk and wails at the sight of her, not wanting to almost kill her again.  Moreau tries to get her to leave, but by the time she has the foresight to turn around, Jamal starts to chase her.  Kaveri, also desiring leftovers, joins in and then the three circle the room in a mad goose chase.  Considering Aubrey has wheels, she manages to go faster and escape from the two, leaving the office and slamming the door behind her, causing Kaveri and Jamal to collide headlong into the heavy wooden door.  Billy turns red with anger, waving a tentacled fist at Jamal and Kaveri, ""Dammit, ye bastards scared 'er away!  I was goin' ta hit on 'er!""

Jamal slowly gets up and sticks his tongue out at Billy, and Kaveri sits up with her neck bobbing up and down like an accordion.  ""I'll feckin' kill ya!"" Billy roars, then throws a crutch at Jamal and Kaveri.  Jamal hisses as the crutch bounces off of his head, and he leaps across the room at Billy, shoving him onto the desk on top of the still-bawling Zach, ""Not if I fuckin' kill yo ass first!""  The two scream obscenities at each other, before Billy shoves Jamal off of him with his remaining crutch, sending the tiger-man flying across the room.  Kaveri quickly gets up and out of the way as Jamal lands where she was sitting by the door, and Billy scuttles across the office towards them so the two stand side-by-side in front of the desk.  Zach uses this opportunity to get up off the desk, disappearing out of the office before returning with his arms full of pie pans filled whipped cream.  Kaveri steps between Jamal and Billy and then opens her arms wide, taking two pies from Zach and holding them out with a big, proud smile.  

""And now,"" she announces, ""our closing act!""  With dramatic airplane noises, she spins around and slams the pies in Jamal and Billy's faces, then takes a third pie and skillfully hurls it across the room in Moreau's face, causing an explosion of whipped cream all over his office.  The four take a bow, sweating and dripping blood, vomit, and whipped cream on the floor as they do so.  The smell is quite rancid and it will probably take weeks to get rid of.

Moreau swears and fumbles around for the chip controls, blinded by the cream and the sheer amount of stench.  He wipes off his face on a sleeve and for the longest time, he just sits in stunned silence. Finally, he manages, ""That's a hell of an act. What do you call it?""

Jamal comes up to Moreau and slams his bloody paws on the desk, leaning over and grinning in Moreau's face. ""We da mothafuckin' Aristocrats!""

The four are promptly zapped and locked in a cage for the next two weeks."

"event","so i wonder if anyone here on this island is a russina mail order bride.

i mean since they're mail order i guess they come in boxes and it would be easier to get them to the island, and they're from a cataloge in russia i can't imagine it being too hard to do?

this place needs more ethic diversity!!!  not just people from english speaking countries!  like russians and affricans and even like mexicans and stuff and give this place a little culture!!!

anyway what i am saying is we need more russians.  then we can talk about communism and ways we can make it work and maybe start a revolution and make things a little better here.

although to be honest we don't actually have any currency, and making our own government may be hard because everything is controled by the lkabs.

so anyways

more russians in boxes please.  i wonder if i can ask the labs for a mail order russian."

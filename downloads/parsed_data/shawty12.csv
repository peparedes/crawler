Happy new years if i havent told you already! **** 2005**** to the class of 2005, we have what like 5 months left in our High School career.... are we ready to graduate though? You have to admitt HS has been fun while it lasted... all the drama..or the i fucked your girlfriend and or boyfriend..bullshit..it has given us all something to talk about...or life would be boring! We have searched to try to find out who we are..our likes and dislikes...and who we are as a person or friend. To all of my friends who have been there for me in a time of need i thank you for what you have given me! Im not gonna name names or anything..you know who you are! To the people who go by what others say about me..fuck you! Sorry it had to be said..i have deep respect for those who speak there minds!!! ok..i have to say this one person in particular...ALYNA WILLIAMS! I love you doll!! Jordan has been an okay experience for me so far... I really am ready to graduate though!  But you know what really sucks... besides the class of 2006 and 2007 going to miss us... is that i cannot graduate this year and get my diploma if i dont pass the history GRAD.exam!!! So yall pray that i do! I'm a dumbass for not being able to have already passed it! And i will be damned if i have went to HS for 12 years for a certificate of attendance! Hell NO!  Anyways I hope that this new year brings everybody happiness!! Have a good one!

"event","If we are friends...and you are getting me something for Christmas then post on here what it is that you want me, "" Santa's little midget"" to get you!

On another note, I sent Chad a christmas card..one of those 50 cent ones we buy at school...does anyone think that maybe i shouldn't have done that? Because i was thinking about it all day yesterday... and obviously i decided to do so...let me know what ya'll think about it?  It Said..."" Hey Sweetheart...I Love You,I Miss You, and I want you to come back to me!"" Is that gay? Nick Anderson helped me write it...so i wouldn't say anything unnecessary about Tonya in it, b/cause i prolly would have...i know its wrong to still despise her, but i cant help my-self!! And if you know me well enough then you know that i have a relationship problem! And i'm not real sure why it is that when i start getting serious with someone..all of the sudden it ends! So I told my mommy that i wanted to go to counceling for this..and so i'm going to start attending classes soon. Chad is the 2nd guy in my whole entire life that i have missed after i lost him. And it absolutely kills me when i see him and Tonya together. John B...with him it's the same way. Only like 3 of you know John B...and he was my 1st love..nothing is EVER going to replace him. Now he is a daddy...and i can not have him either...am I ugly? Am i too controlling or too selfish? If Chad were to tell me right now that he wanted a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship with me right now...i would NOT NOT NOT object. I have told my self over and over that I dont want a boyfriend...but in all actuallity i think that i do...one day i need to learn how to settle down...and not be so fuckin wild  and do stupid shit that I don't need to do! Chad.... gah i want you back soo freakin bad its ridiculous! To some of the people who think I am a bitch...I am..but if you think about it...what girl isn't at one point in time in their life...I'm not mean all the time... Just don't go by hear-say if you hear something about me....if you get to know me i really am pretty cool to hang out with! Crystal Lash..I am sorry for being mean to you..i respect you..and you don't need to take shit from anybody who talks shit to you..if i were you i would have cussed me out...but you would have had to put yourself in my position..you would see where i was coming from about the whole tonya thing. But really im sorry! Randi-Lynn....thank you for being honest w/me. I always seem to need a reality check.I never look at things from two differnt perspectives. ***SENIORS*** GOOD LUCK ON EXAMS...ONE MORE SEMESTER GUYS AND GIRLS! No more High Schhol Drama... just great memories...but what would it be without the drama...what would we talk about..lol?? I will miss you all.... Feel Free to post on here... Tell me what you think of me as a person... Truth hurts sometimes..but i need to hear peoples opinions!

I miss them! Now it seems like you have some kind of attitude toward me now..im not real sure why though?

"event","Ok...so the last few days my ex-boyfriend has been calling me and giving me hell about us breaking up and it being all my fault which it was but still...thats beside the point. I broke it off b/c i was sick of feeling like i was tied down to just one person. It is not easy breaking up with someone you really like and someone you have been with for awhile. A little girl by the name of Alyna Williams told me this yesterday.... and now i see how it is for erin hughes..although roy is not very good for her..but i kinda understand...kinda?? anyways...oh and im sick of everybody saying well we could hang out if you were not with Chad! Im not with him...thats the reason i broke up with the old guy is b/c i wanna be single and date other people... so all of the guys that think chad is going to be mad...GET OVER IT!!!!! IS chad my fuckin daddy now..NO! i have a dad...thanks!
love ya,

"event","Last night we went to Hooter's and it was freakin packed out the wazoo. Farmer rode there with me and i drank 3 drinks on the way... so i was kinda feeling it while we were there. But it was fun to me while it lasted. Then we finally left and farmer drove back to G.Dale. I dont advise anybody to ever let him drive your car cause i can drive better than him fucked up as hell! i still love you though farmey! So then we get back to the school and drank some more there. I bought 2 packs of cigarretts and now i have like 5 left..that's re- damn diculous!I really wanted to make out with this guy but it didnt happen...that sucks!! oh well, maybe later...maybe??? I ended up driving home later that night and Micca spent the night with me. I had the worst hang over the next day. I woke up at 4 in the morning with a headache from hell. And all we have to drink in this damn house is milk. We are some broke bastards. Later on we went to Dave's house to watch them play **Halo2** then he left with his bitch and then me and randi-lynn went to eat. Aww dossy was ova there too. I miss Doss i wish that all this shit would blow over so he can start hanging out again..anyways im gone!

"event","ok well this guy that im dating now is really funny and everything but i really don't think it is possible for me to ever fall in love. In my past few relationships i have tried to and it just doesn't work.. maybe it was because he may not have been the one? who knows..? But to all of you who may know a guy that i am obsessed with (john b). i think he damaged my love life forever. BASTARD! i keep telling myself over and over that i hate him and i wish he was out of my head for good,but in all actuality i don't. im not real sure why i like him so much.. he wasnt my first or anything.. and i cant really figure it out? ever since i met him i have not yet forgotten him. dont get me wrong i love chad 2 to death, not to the point that i may fall in love with him though.. i dont see things going that way. we are so different its weird. maybe opposites attract..well obviously! Speaking of relationships..they are so over-rated!!! The reason that i dont want a guy is b/c 1. i hate being tied down. 2. i dont like somebody keeping track of where i am every second of the day..thats why i have parents. 3. when i turn 18, im going clubbin and im going to have fun with my friends. anyways im gone thats all i have to say for now, yall have a good day!!

love ya........

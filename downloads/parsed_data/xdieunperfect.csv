"event","hey, wow I haven't posted in a long time. Well it's summer now and my computer hass been really gay so that's why I haven't been posting. I don't want it to be summer I wanted to stay at  liska kill *tears* :'0[ wow well this day totally sucks and it's only the 2nd actual day of being home bored this summer. yeah I graduated from 8th grade lst thursday and it was boring as hell, no awards for me. I came close to having to go to summer school for Spanish because even though I passed for the year I still failed the proficency by four points. but my mom said I didn't have to go and it wouldn't work out anyways so yay! even though I kinda wish I went because I am way bored here and being that I want to be in school, just not the high school :0[ succcckkkkkkkss. well and then um last friday night I had to sit through another graduation, for the high school [my sister] then we had her party on saturday and um I was sad because my cousin couldn't come because her house had a fire and she has to stay out of it for the whole summer, 2 months so it can be cleaned and also so the damage can be fixed. It really sucks. But heather came :0] I can't stay up there at my cousin's like me and her planned on me doing this summer so she might stay down here the whole next week but I'm really not sure. My mom was bitching at me because she told me not to make plans before I ask her but I really don't get it because no one would never get anywhere if they never mad the plans first. but I don;t get here because she doesn't make any sence anyways. and well I have to go um to Utica this weeknd for a forth of july type party. but umm yay I get my sister's cellphone next week when she's 18. God I can't wait. It's sooo much better than mine now. Mine has no clock on it and no caller ID and no vibrating thing, like the vibrating setting doesn't work. That sounds really bad but you know what I mean. So um my phone is like 5 years old and it's big and d a flip phone:0DDD well I think I'll go I wrote alot. oh yeah and by the way I have 4 husbands! Tim, Nate, Ray, and Steve<3. oh yeah and I got a new pretty mouse and it scrolls unlike my oother one because I broke the scroll when I got mad at my computer once.

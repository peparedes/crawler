"event","so it's been a few weeks, I've finally settled on school work. no it's not CSC, they haven't even paid me yet. I just mail serena asking when we'll get paid.
it's the server - been thinking hard and it just might work!

ok, here's what's been going on the past few weeks.
you know the web master job that pays $1700 a mth but expected shit loads of word? yeah, it didn't want me coz I my work was too amaturish. for the CSC web design, the boss didn't pick my deisgn again coz it's was too institutional. cool eh?
this really illustrates that no two pairs of eyes see the same thing.

oh well, I'm reading my MCSE book now, hope to get back to the range soon. my house is in a mess, my dad is renovating the kitchen. hopefully we'll clear the old stuff for some valuable space!"

end of exams but is it time for me to relax? no... coz I found so much work for myself!

I have CSC site to do, Student server to learn, SMUSA site to do, duno if I shd take up a job that my dad found for me, renovate my house and take up a job that pays $1700 a mth and wants me to do 42 websites in 2 mths!!!

quite crazy since they think all the work I've done now has been amaturish.
like that how?

duno man... die liao. looks like I gotta start work on some serious stuff.
work work work.

I also bought the whole 20 VCD collection studio Ghilbi.
great stuff if you know what i'm taking about.

I learnt that BGS singapore is a truly lame company that's stuck in a vaccum. they have no sense of corporate social responsibilty and they think external CSR is organising a company dinner at suntec (as long as its outside the company building) 
DUHH!!
haha.. philips singapore. you have my vote for the joke of the month!


AFTER my BGS class. I was walking down to meet my bebe at foodhaven. then this small girl tried to block my way as I was walking down the stairs. everyone keeps to the left!
haven't you learnt basic highway code?
oh yah. you're too small to be driving!

you probably need a child seat to see what's on the ROAD! WAKE UP!!!
sorry, I really shouldn't blame her. she was too short to see me walking down. she could only see my feet when she was walking up. I should have shoved it up her mouth when she made the irritated 'che' sound with her tounge. CHECK IT! she even stared at me. probably wonder why she was so blind!
hellllooo??!!! wake up will ya? just becoz you're some editor of the school paper doesn't mean shit to the students of the school when you don't have any EQ or PR skills. carry on carrying faculty balls! go polish some apples and lick some ass. you won't be able to smell mine coz it's too high from your already high nose."

Check it!
I just discoverd this great function in win xp pro!

it's a super function esp for those who love to toy around with settings, install new stuff, registry and even delete stuff.
so my newly formatted winxp has been losing its drivers once every sat.
virus? possible...
but I think this restore function can even solve that.

so firstly, my sound card disappeard. that was solved by just downloading the xp driver from the website.
next my wireless lan card couldn't work. this was no the fault of my computer but rather the damn school network that's full of problems.

the final straw came when my CDROM couldn't work properly coz I deleted on the *.sys files. I had to delete that coz of the CDR I installed over the weekend.

well, I didn't know it disappeard until I tried to run a Flash file from CD from another Dominic. it was embarrasing when I couldn't even open the file on my computer.

so I tried all sorts of solutions and I eventually solved it by checking my recycle bin for the stuff I recently trashed. it worked but still with errors.

it wasn't until yesterday that I discovered the system restore funtion in win xp!
way cool!

all you do is choose a particular date on its calender and it restores  every erything back to the way it was.
it even gave me back the stuff I deleted!"

it's super dumb!
my sch personal account has  a specified user name: i.e. your full name!

so dumb!!!

Open House 

my school is having its first ever OPEN HOUSE! well it seems to me that my school has always been open to the public. we have visitors from lots of camps - - all the way from Tuas Naval Base sometimes! they come to check out our food and chicks. guess word has it that SMU has lots of chicks. but whatever... 

I still feel that it's really dumb to have a homepage that only operates intranet and uses your real name as it's URL. 
I gotta find some new site for this. 

anyway. time to talk about GC - this of course could mean anyone - but people who I've spoken to recently would know who I'm talking about. yeah, it's that asshole that's on everyone's lips. the asshole that must have bought his degree and most prob plagraized someone's work to get his phd. we all know this for a fact that this person can't teach to save his life! 
So, after I found out what happened about his ass, I start to feel sorry for that bastard! 
now I'm collecting juicy facts about him. I just found out that he's having a fling with one of the students in my school! looks like he's going to get himself into nice hot soup. for someone with principles and integrity - it's only natural to sleep with your students. and if she gets pregnant - marry her for a short period and find some other new student to sleep with in mean time till the mrs gets really tired of his shit and files for divorce.

Further Thoughts on Stepping Down Details 
this blogg is fast becoming a kinda website of the day thing. 

I'm working on a Business, Government and Society group project now. have you heard of such a course? hah! it's all about learning how bizs and the general public are correlated. that all biz should give back to the community because they support you and inter-relationships work and stuff. 

anyway. I stumbled on what really happened to me yesterday. 
it seems to me that the whole class of GC scored full marks for a quiz. that would lead him to think that someone got hold of his questions and answers. so he pointed his finger at me. 
what a fucking joke! I'm in even in his class! 

so it matter was that he left his answers lying around and someone got hold of it. of course that student wasn't being very ethical about it but he/she struck the hot iron and read out the answers in class - coz good old' GC left the class during the quiz to jerk off in the nearest corner. 

let's see him in action!

at last my school FTP is back up 

I watched ICE AGE today... I realised it was a really short movie! in fact, it was the only GV movie I've been to that had actually started on time! anyway. the movie was about 3 unlikely characters (mammoth, sabretooth + sloth) who team up together to form a herd with a mission to bring a human baby back to his human herd. quite a lame happy ending story. kinda what you'd expect from a children's movie. 
anyway, my main aim today is to bitch about a certain character who called me up for no reason to find fault. 
sheesh! this is a school website! I'm sure to get flak for this if I post it here! 

better find another outlet.

notquite.org I've been visiting this site for a while now... it's amazing how good site you can create be just equipped with knowledge in cgi and html... of course simple clean sites are the best! 

I spent the whole day in school today... getting over my finance quiz that I took last saturday. dunno what the hell happened. it was damn difficult. think I didn't study enough for it I guess. the quiz was on capital budgeting - just simple stuff calculating if you should take up the project or not. 
sounds simple right? 

NOT... given the time limit and stuff. my brain just didn't work. gotta do something about it. 

anyway, I think my CSC work is going to become full time. I'm thinking how the hell am I going to cope with so much work. 

oh yah! I gotta write about the Panda Chiffon Cake I bought from Bangawan Solo the other day. that little cake costs $6.50! with only about 8 slices. they sell separate slices for 70 cents ... that's only $5.60 for a cake if you buy them separate... sheesh. I got cheated. 
anyway, this is not about me getting cheated. well, not yet anyway. 
the cake that I bought tasted strange the first day. it kinda tasted like it was infused with insecticide. but I still ate 2 slices for breakfast coz I was hungry and I didn't have anything else to eat. 
back to what I wanna tell ya: so I came home after a long day at school only to discover that the cake had deflated! 
""chiffon no air"" 
flat and sticky.... strange... it looked like some alien aimed some sort of anti matter beam gun at it and it deformed into that sludge... 

so how? of the 8 slices I had only 2 and now - no one can eat it... 
sheesh. 
BANGAWAN SOLO! 
I wanted to bring it back to the shop to tell them about it but I didn't have the time to go back to the shop - I had morning lessons the next day anyway... had to leave at 8am. and the shop doesn't open till 10+ 

later I found out that the cake contained coconut milk and that it can't last more than 2 days... 
sheesh! I don't know how long it was already in the shop!

oh well. rem that post I did the other day bout me waiting really long for the bus. well today was another one of those days.
it started bad right from the start when I had to take 157 to school. then I missed 186 to queenstown and had to wait another 30 mins for the next one. it's a good thing my dearest understands that fact - that SBS TRANSIT is unreliable!

fucking hell...
don't believe? 
BLUFF YOU GOT MONEY AH?

anyway, I'm in this mood coz I got another stinker from T.E again.
this time he was complaining about us coming late for his presentation thing.
I also don't understand why people bother to write emails telling the whole group that they're guilty. ""I won't do it again"" 
like real
unless you intentionally wanted to be late today. unforeseen circumstances will once again crop up and YOU WILL be late again. what is time but just a guage for ourselves?
everything is relative
in the forth dimension, what is your 10am may not be 10am to me.
and 10 am in SG is not 10 am elsewhere e.g. Jarkarta but if you were in KL or HK or Beijing then it's still 10am. there's no running away from that. 

Not that I couldn't be bothered to come on time but I didn't really see the point since we're going to tape the whole thing and watch it at leisure. sheesh! but I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LATE!
This mad cripple got on his gun and fired another one. how many times must this happen before he realises that we're not fucking PROFESSIONALS! even prostitues get paid more.
with all the time I'm putting in to the center - all I'm getting is a measly 500 smackeroos. can't do much with that. 
REALISE THAT!

oh well... bitching about it seemed to have helped."

today I was late for my CSC duty at where else but the CSC lab. was late coz of the damn SBS transit (is that their new name?) *sigh* SBS  - our public bus monopoly - full of disapppointment. valued added services like bus timing information is useless when bus drivers (captain now) don't follow the timing! so I waited for bus 174 from 910 and the screen said that the bus will be leave at 918. which was still an acceptable time. but the bus driver didn't come to the bus till 935!
effectively from the long que that ensured after the long wait - I waited 30 mins for my bus and was subsequently 30 mins late for school!

gotta tell you this story about the three balloon in a row at 30 metres shot (haha... damn funny)

then I had dinner at HOOKED ON PASTA! thought I would have a good time there. was quite hungry too. but was so hungry before that Sert went for Laksa and I had a coffee. not much appetite after that though.
HOP was really crap today!
I won't ever go back to that restaurant.
service was lame and the food was damn bad!
my cabonara was powdery and the bacon tasted bad. J's salmon was smelling bad and Sp's pasta tasted worse than the one at scotts food court.

we complained but it fell on deaf ears - nevermind I'll remember that!
My bebe had a german buffet! (after her bowl of laksa)
hahah.. she enjoyed herself today - that's good!

but I'm quite worried about the pile of work that I have to do for this week and the weeks to come coz exams are really near and holidays going to end. I'll try to play as much golf as possible this week."

take yesterday for example.
didn't go to school, didn't even bother to go out to eat.
all I do everyday is spend time with Sert and play --- GOLF!
haha.. been using Mizuno T Zoid blades for practice. it feels damn heavy and stiff and it hurts my hands more. 
but it makes my balls go straight and pretty far!
I have no idea what I love golf. can someone please explain to me why everyone is so crazy about golf?

golf is not just a social game
whenever I'm there I'll see people alone whacking balls.
and whenever I'm there - I'll surely see an amature giving advice to a newbie. there's a new golf newbie everyday!
this sport will just continue to grow...
I do hope I get good at the game one day. 

and for my hands to stop hurting too."

know what happened?

WE GOT SICK!
haha... so lame. seems like the festive food is a sure fire thing to eat if you want to get sick.
so being a boon layer (one who lives in boon lay)
I went to the nearest Gerthin Jones Clinic - that spells cheaper medical service for SMU students.

anyway. back to the story.
after the long search for the medical center in the huge NTU. we finally found in! only to be turned away because the simple minded staff have not heard of SMU and they think we're not part of the 'scheme'. guess we're pioneering in NTU too!
first smu students there...

I observed something that led me to believe the truth in what a prof said at the recent Ho Rih Hwa talk held at suntec org by smu too... some ntu prof who lived on the campus said he frequently saw maids cleaning the dorms of the undergrads.
well.. today I saw a lady undergrad being accompanied to the clinic by a maid. - later I found out from the doctor that she's one complicated case... - whatever that means.

anyway. being from SMU, we were considered 2nd class citizens in NTU. so though we were there early, we still had to wait for a long long time - my que no. was 36 but it skipped mine and went to 42 before coming back to 36. haha... that's first come first serve for you....

can't believe I can write so much crap....

as what T.E says when he writes to his TA's
THAT'S ALL FOR THE MOMENT... sheesh! tom.. what a joke!"

Dion Chow won a Clie and Lydia Ng won a Ipaq. 
sheesh... I want a palm but for what reason I still have no idea.

so I came to school to meet my bebe after her LTB cls. once again, I was late due to unforseen circumstances. but it didn't matter. the president was already in sch when I reached and it didn't really make a difference to me. unlike the croonies who follow him like sheep following the shepard or like stray cats following the old woman who feeds them.

yesterday was quite happening.
its was my 8th month with Bebe (haha. ba1 yue4 - sounds like hungry ghosts festival). i got some bread from FH for the animals that lived in my campus. there we brough the yong tau foo lady's girl there to play.
it was fun fun fun! we feed swans, ducks, tererpins and one big fish. we refused to feed the pigeons.
at night we had dinner at nydc.
but we didn't have any dessert there coz we were already too full.
I shared some of my mushroom madness with the rats that stayed below holland v food court by feeding them a concoction of beer mixed with masticated pizza.

so naturally, when you get home, you'd be greeted with a nice stomach ACHE! (EGG!)

"event","Today I lived in the past.&nbsp; I watched canceled television shows, sent emails to old girlfriends I haven't seen in years, and browsed through middle school yearbooks trying to understand exactly who this person was that felt the things I vaguely remember feeling.&nbsp; I apparently had a little system in place to establish the hierarchy of my friends:&nbsp; distant relations were marked --, decent friends were II, my closest friends were / or /\, depending on their quality, and crushes were marked by little blue stars.&nbsp; Yes, little blue stars.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; My enemies were marked with an X and what was interesting about this is that I had two xes (XX) next to my own name.&nbsp; How is it that an 11 year old kid comes to hate himself?&nbsp; By all reasonable accounts I should have been enjoying a life of playing football in backyards or watching cartoons at 4 pm every weekday or doing whatever the hell it is kids that age do.&nbsp; But here my disgust with myself was so palpable, so real that I could mark it down in a book with apparently no compunction whatsoever.&nbsp; 11!&nbsp; I mean jesus...isn't all that supposed to kick in at 13 or 14?&nbsp; I robbed myself of my own childhood.&nbsp; That's what I've learned.&nbsp; I let the world get to me too early and I lost what should have been some of the best years of my life because of it.

Why do I bring this up?&nbsp; Why here?&nbsp; Why now, in this journal I've left untouched for years?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; It does seem a little appropriate that I think on the past in the medium that has such a stake in my past, and make no mistake, this journal is the past.&nbsp; Beyond that, I can't say.&nbsp; 

Scratch that.&nbsp; I can say, and I will say.&nbsp; No one is reading this anyhow.&nbsp; I write because I have no one to speak to.&nbsp; I've left all my friends behind, my girlfriend is halfway around the world, and gin isn't a very good conversation partner (this of course being the one thing gin isn't extremely good at doing).&nbsp; I leave for Cincinnati to start a job soon, and all the world seems silent in anticipation.&nbsp; A voice then.&nbsp; I need to hear or see something, some words not in a book.&nbsp; Unpoetic words.&nbsp; Worthless words.&nbsp; Words about nothing, for nothing, and for no one.&nbsp; Nothing should ever be read.&nbsp; We should all just write and write and write and lock our diaries away from prying eyes and leave all our articles unpublished.&nbsp; If we want to read a story, we write it.&nbsp; If we want the news, we watch it unfold and report it to ourselves.&nbsp; Then, maybe sometime in the distant future, maybe sometime after the next presidential election but before Jesus comes back, we all trade notes and figure out that even with 6 billion manuscripts no one has written anything different from anyone else.&nbsp; One might expect this realization to get us all to come together and stop cluster bombing the shit out of each other, which it won't.&nbsp; But at least we can drop the pretense that the enemy is, at any important level, distinct from us in any way.

I dreamt i was shot in the skull last night and I woke up still thinking I was dead.&nbsp; I am not."

"event","Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bailey
 
What can I say?  What can i say after gaining your trust over these past two years and then pointlessly throwing it away in one night?  What can i say after endangering your daughter's future?  I believe that you once saw me as an intelligent responsible young man, so what can I say after completely contradicting that ideal (in my eyes as well)?  Do i say sorry?  I am sorry, yes....I am incredibly sorry that any of this happened.  But sorry doesn't cut it for me.  Sorry is something you say when you bump in to someone on the street, not when you almost screw up the lives of 4 individuals, especially one with as much potential as Melissa.  The truth is that there is nothing i can say to regain your trust in me, and there are no words to convey just how much regret i feel, and there is no way that i can assure you beyond a shadow of a doubt that this will never happen again.
And maybe there shouldn't be.  I dont deserve for the consequences to just go away, even if i have learned my lesson, and i dont deserve to regain your trust without earning it.  So i am not writing this to ask for your forgiveness, im writing this to ask for another chance to try and earn it.  I have no illusions about this whole situation, i am aware that it is my fault, and i am willing to accept whatever judgement you lay on me.
 
And i want you to knw that i consider the danger i put your daughter in to be the absolute worst thing i have ever done
 
Very sincerely,
Stephen


Imply what you will"

These lights are so intense that now no matter what time i go out at night it looks like its almost dawn, so of course i cant see any stars.  That was the one thing i had, i hated living in this cul-de-sac infested All-American slice of Purgatory but at least i could take comfort in the fact that i was far enough away from the city that i could still see the stars.  Not anymore.  Now i go outside at night and the closest things to real nature i can see are the trees with their limbs cut short to keep them out of the neighbors yards.  We sterilize our pets, we stunt our trees, we justify the killing of animals for sport by saying that if we dont kill them, theyll become too populous.  What a joke, i think the world could do with a few more deer and a few less humans.

"event","I just heard two very frightening things on Real Time with Bill Maher.  I heard a congressman say that (pp) ""Europeans dont know how to love.  Americans, however, do know how to love.""  And I heard Ann Coulter, who is probably the most extremely right wing person alive, say that liberals have joyless sex, whereas conservative, churchgoing christians have ""orgasms through the roof.""

The first comment is just flat out prejudice.  To insinuate that America, with its divorce rate of over 50% (the liberals fault, by the way), knows how to love while some of the oldest civilized cultures in the world do not...what can i say to that?  And the second comment...its just that i thought that even we were above <i>this</i>.  I get the feeling that it has a root at Christian elitism.  Since Europe as a whole has moved away from Christ, who is apparently the embodiment of love, then they have moved farther away from true love.  I guess it makes sense for the church to be the epicenter for all the love in the world...that explains why the priests get so overwhelmed with love that they have to find some way to release it.  Like a choirboy.  
And of course since liberals uphold the separation of church and state and other such abominations like free choice, it makes sense that god would withhold the gift of a great orgasm from them and instead give it to the people who secretly smile when abortion clinics get bombed and who support the slaughter of 3rd world brown people so they can sleep better at night.  Really, if the Creator Of Our Universe cant find anything better to do than concern himself with what people are blowing their load in whom, then i want nothing to do with him.

This is all just propaganda though.  Liberals have bad sex, vote Republican!  Europeans are heartless, wave the flag!  The problem is that the people who wrote the propaganda pulled an L Ron Hubbard and started believing their own stories, and that is the psychology underlying the idea that we can just bypass the UN and wage war on whoever we want.  We're America!  The reason no one else sees it like we do is because they lack our unique worldview!"

"event","Well, it seems that I was lying to myself a couple of weeks ago when i felt like i was finally getting some inspiration.  Right now, my mind is completely blank and it is very disheartening, especially considering that i was voted Best Writer in my Senior Class (ahem)...but since i didnt win Most Pessimistic im going to have to assume that most of the people that voted had no idea what they were talking about and only voted for me because i came off as one of those ""dark, poetry types"" who probably listens to early Dashboard Confessional (yknow, back when he was umm...dark) and cries into his hooded sweatshirt immediately after cutting himself with a razorblade.  

Anyway, i think i need drugs.  Not necessarily even real drugs, placebos will do.  See, i never did drugs to get high or lose myself.  No, i did drugs to put myself on a level closer to those stonedrippedtwisted people i idolized (ie Aldous Huxley and Hunter S Thompson).  These people did their best work on drugs, and i always felt that if i did drugs, id feel the same sort of inspiration that fueled their chaotic and beautiful masterpieces.  Of course, the drugs never did anything to or for me, they didnt enhance my creativity or put profound thoughts in my head, but they did provide me with an excuse to be inspired.  I dont have enough faith in myself to really believe that anything remotely original that comes from my head is worth anything, so ive convinced myself that i need some sort of stepping stool to achieve creative enlightenment, be it drugs, music, or Johnny Depp.
I find it kind of strange that i think i need drugs to motivate me.  Why cant i just be a good American and go to a seminar or read a book by Dr. Phil?!

This had a point, i swear to Jesus it did.  Of course, me swearing to Jesus is like Bin Laden swearing on the life of Salman Rushdie's niece who moonlights as a lingerie model, but thats hardly the point.

Hell, i look back at my posts from a year and a half ago and cringe.  It seems i was one of those bastards that knew about one Nietschze quote and felt the need to use it any time it was remotely feasible.  It seems like old Friederich N. is the Kurt Cobain of philosophers, and ""God is dead"" is his Smells Like Teen Spirit.  Its a shame Nietschze didnt have a heroin addiction or commit suicide.  No, he just had a gimp leg and married his cousin.  ....so why did i start writing again?  Oh yeah, because i was getting a guilty conscience over the fact that i was spending 5 hours a day watching movies and in front of the computer and all the while the stories from all the half read books that are lying face down on my bed are fading from memory, so i decided to write something, anything really, to prove to myself that i still had a functioning intellect.  This tactic isnae working very well.

"event","Well, well, well...here we are again.  It would seem that after a week long binge of art films, Tom Wolfe, pretentious canadian instrumental bands, and James Joyce my brain has once again convinced itself that it's thoughts are worth being recorded.  Pity.  I was beginning to enjoy the impunity that comes along with not having a reminder that my thoughts, profound and unique as they may seem at the time, are really not that special.  So what now?  My Right Brain, drunk on its own hubris has led me to the computer screen with every intention of providing what few readers i have left after my prolonged absence with a stunning blueprint of my intellect and now, as was expected, im faced with a ridiculous amount of white space on my screen which (incredibly) makes the words ive already written seem even more feeble.
It is strange though, when i listen to certain songs (like those of my current muse, miss Neko Case) or see certain things, i can feel my brain start to function on a different level than what im used to.  My thoughts cease to come in definable symbols and instead come in abstract bursts of...emotion.  It feels like a smell that reminds you of a distant place that has faded from your memory, it feels like waking up in a strange place and remembering youre not in your bed.  I think it must be how newborns feel, how they respond to the world before they are taught to limit and encase their feelings through words.  I think thats what brought me here...these damn songs are convincing me that i need an outlet for all the thoughts that are pouring into my head.  And to tell the truth, i think i do need it, i need a focusing point.  Its one thing to walk out under the stars at 2 in the morning and contemplate physics and the nature of the universe, its another to hone those random notions and pseudo-intellectual flotsam into actual thoughts, and i need that.  I think thats why im not feeling fulfilled.  I think thats why i feel guilty every time i look in the mirror, because i am not thinking enough.  So perhaps ill return soon with something of a little more substance that a brief narrative of my thought process (actually, i suppose thats what any self-respecting journal entry should be).

I saw it before anyone else, but didnt say anything or react, because i didnt want to bring any attention to it.  Nevertheless, a few minutes later i heard the screams and soon most of the students had formed a circle around the mouse and they all watched (and some cheered) as a few guys tried to crush with their trays.  From my table, i heard someone say ""they got it, its dead.""  And i cried.  I never cry.  But i couldnt help thinking about what absolute terror the mouse must have felt before it died.  I never really realized how horrible, how monstrous human beings actually are.  I couldnt comprehend how anyone could wish death or harm on anything else, especially an innocent little creature like that, simply out of fear!  No matter how little regard i had for my species in the first place, i had never seen such cruelty and sickening ignorance up close, and its hard for me to describe the purity of the hatred that i felt then.  And all these emotions welled up inside me, and i just broke down.

The strange thing was, no matter how jumbled and chaotic my thoughts may have been, i dont think ive ever felt such clarity.  There was no voice inside my head saying ""stop crying you melodramatic idiot! It was only one mouse!""  I knew i was crying because i felt someone had to mourn the loss of that life, and the fact th at i was crying comforted me.  For the first time in a long time, i felt like i had what i guess you could call a soul.  I felt human, really human...sentient and conscientious.  Those....animals in the cafeteria...no, its an insult to call them animals, because animals act out of necessity, animals are innocent...there isnt a word for those things that would kill out of fear or, even worse, exhilaration.

I wish we all shared some common goal or feeling, other than this constrained bitterness that leaves us raging against the void and expecting no answer.  But other than that, there is nothing.  And there will be no more revolutions in my lifetime, there will be only greed and a politically correct mentality that has robbed us of our spirit."

"event","What exactly constitutes a tragedy?
I mean, i understand that the unexpected loss of life is tragic, but we dont put our flags at half staff or declare national days of mourning for every 7 (or 2400, for that matter) kids killed in drunk driving accidents, people caught in crossfires, or AIDS victims.  So why do we do it for astronauts, government workers, and soldiers? (of course, for soldiers its only a ""tragedy"" if it occurs during peacetime, otherwise its just a ""cost of war""...ha)
This Columbia event is something that actually does arouse some almost unknown emotions in me: sympathy and remorse being the major ones.  Mainly because I believe those astronauts were working towards one of the noblest goals humanity is aiming for, and because i know this mess will set back an already struggling space program that desperately needs public confidence and support.
But people dont view this as a tragedy because of the implications for NASA or the space program, but for the human cost.  And thats fair. These were intelligent people with families doing their duty to better the lives of humans.  Tragic?  Of course.  But how much coverage does CNN give abortion clinic bombings?   Its the same case with those doctors, and whether you are pro choice or life is irrelevant, because those doctors are intelligent and they are doing what they believe will benefit their patients.  Where is their presidential recognition?
But thats what i believe it is: media attention.  It seems to me something is only a tragedy if CNN does a slow motion replay of it more than 10 times.  How shocked and saddened would the American people be if this whole thing was nothing more than one of the current events scrolling across the bottom of the screen?  Right between ""Pete Townshend acquitted of child porn charges"" and ""there are 343 days left in 2003"" you see ""space shuttle Columbia blew up over Texas; 7 dead"" would you run to the phone and alert your friends and family?

The only real tragedy i see in any of these events is that people will be over this in a week and then the only tragic thing in their lives will be that American Idol was preempted by a memorial service for the astronauts.

only in america."

Im in the supposed ""elite"" class of students in my grade.  I had adequate extracurricular activities.  And I didnt get in.  To a public school.  To an <i>Indiana</i> public school.

As a kid, it never really struck me as odd, other kids had imaginary friends, whats wrong with having an imaginary reality?  But where other kids grew out of this stage in their social development, i just kind of stuck with it.  I enjoyed it, and it was a great coping mechanism for someone as anti-social and introverted as i was/am (of course, in my mind theres a world of difference between having friends that you talk to consistently and being social).  But anyway, over time i must have accumulated at least 50 of these storylines in my head and in every one of these stories the main character was always what I viewed as an ideal person, and lately ive noticed that my characters are slowly becoming what im like in real life.  I think this is probably a positive thing."

Perhaps patriotism is no more than a symbol anymore, perhaps America and all the ideals it stood for are dead.

less than 4,000 people died in the attacks.  The only reason that was tragic is because the television said so.  And here we are, on this day that commemorates the sanctity of life, getting ready to start a potential  World War 3.  I wish i could see the humor in all this."

"event","Well, our country seems poised to go to war with Iraq....again.  Because i think we missed a few starving villagers the last time around so we need to go back and tie up loose ends.  First, we justify war in Iraq by saying theyre funding terrorism, this turns out to be untrue (or at least we have no proof, but thats never stopped the good ol USA before).  Then we say that we're going to war because they wont allow weapons inspectors in, so they decide to give the UN weapons inspectors free reign inside their borders, but we ignore that anyway.  The only reason we have to go to war with Iraq is to take peoples minds off all the corporate scandals (which our President and VP are most likely a part of) and to perpetuate the post-9-11 patriotic fervor.  This should sound very familiar to anyone whos ever read Orwell's 1984.  And of course, if we enter into an unjustified war with Iraq, the other Arab nations might get involved, giving Israel the chance theyve been looking for to attack the other Arab countries and expand their territory and....well you get the point.

Forget California, i hope this entire country sinks into the ocean, allowing nature to take her revenge on the country that put the hole in the ozone layer and thought it was a brilliant idea to bury toxic waste underground.

"event","Yesterday was my livejournals 1 year anniversary.  Skimming through some of my entries i find it hard to believe how pretentious and naive i <strike>am</strike> was.  I even quoted Marilyn Manson in one of my entries, which is almost as bad as the fact that i used to like that music (though The Reflecting God will always be one of the greatest heavy metal songs of all time...but thats still not saying much).  Ive always prided myself on being able to look back at who i was in the past and seeing how far i had come since that time, how much i had evolved as a person. I remember who i was 2 or 3 years ago and i cant help but laugh at (and pity) that person.  But its somewhat depressing to know that in a year or so ill look back at who i am now and wonder ""what the hell was i thinking?""  Yet at the same time its comforting, because as long as i can look back and laugh, it means that i am still growing, learning, and evolving...and if i cant, i might as well be dead.


Theres one thing that all my entries seem to have in common though: i cant express myself.  I can always get the general idea across, but i can never elaborate.  And when i try, my writing turns into stream of consciousness prose that jumps from subject to subject.  I think part of it is the fact that i have some sort of electronic stage fright that stops me from expressing myself in front of the teeming mass of readers i have, and the other part is that thats just how my mind works.  My thought process is structured like one big inside joke, which means that my writing (and most of what i say) comes out as nonsense.

I havent been posting nearly as much as i used to, but i really have nothing to say.  Im only able to write when im unhappy, and <lj user=voidedentry> (who has been putting up with me for almost 7 months now) doesnt seem to want to let me get that way.  So blame her.

I keep asking myself ""whats the point?""  Ive always felt that writing in a journal, be it live or not, should be a way of exploring yourself and developing your ability to put your thoughts into words, not me writing some worthless narrative of the events in my life...im nowhere near conceited or presumptuous enough to think that you care.

These past two weeks have been kind of hard on me.  It was a mistake to get a job, i knew it would be but i did it anyway to get my father off my back.  Its generally not a good idea to do a lot of manual labor when you have mono, but try explaining that to him.  <strike>But what can you expect from someone who thinks mono only lasts 7-10 days and says the only side effects are droopy eyelids and a bit of yawning?</strike>  But its not the job thats been bothering me.  Its more of a feeling that something is weighing me down and sedating me (mentally, that is).  Im lucky if i can think two clear thoughts per hour, the rest of the time i just seem to rely on instinct and habit...just like almost every other person on this planet.  My emotions come in spurts, and for no reason i start to feel angry or sad or hopeless...and all these feelings are evened out by a feeling of detachment much stronger than id ever admit.  The only things ive been able to accomplish are i managed to finish Watership Down by Richard adams in two days and i managed to give up on Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand in a week.

acidjhonen:	why?  I could've given you an address with 100 or more of

ayehaertpixistix:	Yeah.
acidjhonen:	that's another reason

her.

bi

ayehaertpixistix:	What? Can't I discuss the size of a goat?

ayehaertpixistix:	Why can't you just be happy for him??

ayehaertpixistix:	No, Stephen doesn't lie to me about that. I mean, I 
looked 
up porn for him.
ayehaertpixistix:	I don't get jealous.
acidjhonen:	why would i be happy for another man and his goat?  i 
should be 
happy for you if anyone
acidjhonen:	i know, he's probably told you more than me
ayehaertpixistix:	Well, so far the goat's actually been a hinderance, 
but in 
the long run... I love that goddamn goat.
acidjhonen:	that's very sickening
ayehaertpixistix:	I know.
acidjhonen:	i see you more as some form of midget slave, not in any way 
sexually
ayehaertpixistix:	That's good.
ayehaertpixistix:	Just that you don't think of me sexually.
acidjhonen:	yes, is'nt it
ayehaertpixistix:	It creeps me out that I know you have had sex over 
100 
times.
acidjhonen:	i don't think of many women sexually
acidjhonen:	over 110 now
acidjhonen:	i dont keep count though
ayehaertpixistix:	That's crazy.
ayehaertpixistix:	Did Stephen tell you about my brother?
acidjhonen:	kicking down the door?  yes
ayehaertpixistix:	That was so awful.
ayehaertpixistix:	I'd prefer not to think about my brother's sexuality.
acidjhonen:	nikki's mom/sister/other sister/brother in law/neice have

in on us, so be glad it was only 1 time
acidjhonen:	how is matt helm making up for it?  did he find a 
girlfriend/boyfriend?
ayehaertpixistix:	You didn't know he's going out with Jessica 
Field?????
acidjhonen:	i think i did?  i guess i forgot or something
acidjhonen:	i think he's gay though
ayehaertpixistix:	It's possible. He was scared to touch me.
acidjhonen:	you poor kid
ayehaertpixistix:	I know.
acidjhonen:	he have a big goat?
ayehaertpixistix:	In the first ten minutes I spent with Stephen, he got 
farther than Matt ever did.
ayehaertpixistix:	I don't even know if he has a goat!
acidjhonen:	sounds fun...to both of your comments
acidjhonen:	he is either gay or small
acidjhonen:	maybe even both, since alot of times they go together
ayehaertpixistix:	Stephen wants me to sleep with him to find out.
acidjhonen:	why couldnt you just ask field?
ayehaertpixistix:	She's weird about sex.
acidjhonen:	i would, but...Stephen probably told you why i dont talk to 
her
ayehaertpixistix:	I've been tempted to, though.
ayehaertpixistix:	You used to like her, right?
ayehaertpixistix:	She's even more of a midget than me.
acidjhonen:	yes, i liked her at one time
acidjhonen:	it is my desire to make all midgets my slaves
acidjhonen:	i think that might've been part of it
ayehaertpixistix:	I'm 5'1. That's not a midget.

ayehaertpixistix:	I saw him once, for a second.
acidjhonen:	so you havent met jeremy?
ayehaertpixistix:	Nope.
acidjhonen:	he gave plate head her name
acidjhonen:	i was hoping he had one for you
ayehaertpixistix:	Probably something about my shortness or rack.
ayehaertpixistix:	Or hair.
ayehaertpixistix:	I have shitty hair.
acidjhonen:	i see?
acidjhonen:	or violent bisexuality
ayehaertpixistix:	It's not like I send out an unconcious message of ""I 
WANT 
CUNT!""
ayehaertpixistix:	.. is it/
ayehaertpixistix:	?
acidjhonen:	yes, it is
acidjhonen:	cunt wanter
acidjhonen:	you cant hide it!
ayehaertpixistix:	Blah. You're just jealous because I'm gayer than your 
girlfriend is.
acidjhonen:	you dont have to point it out.....
acidjhonen:	:'(
ayehaertpixistix:	Awwh. A  sad emoticon.
ayehaertpixistix:	I'm crying.
ayehaertpixistix:	Really.
acidjhonen:	i wouldnt doubt it you cunt lover
ayehaertpixistix:	I'm mostly a fan of the clit.
acidjhonen:	arent we all
acidjhonen:	*drools*
ayehaertpixistix:	heh
ayehaertpixistix:	I have the Golden Girls theme song stuck in my 
head... for 
no apparent reason.
acidjhonen:	how....gay
acidjhonen:	you cant deny their homosexuality
ayehaertpixistix:	They're post menopausal women.
acidjhonen:	yes
acidjhonen:	go thm
acidjhonen:	them*
acidjhonen:	have that gay pride
ayehaertpixistix:	Are you anti gay?
acidjhonen:	no, just ani-old people
ayehaertpixistix:	Ah.
acidjhonen:	so what do you do when you arent worshipping Stephen?
ayehaertpixistix:	You mean, what do I do when I'm not carving his name 
into 
my extremeties?
acidjhonen:	yes
ayehaertpixistix:	Read occasionally. Listen to music. Watch too much 
television. Sleep a lot.
ayehaertpixistix:	Spend too much time online.
ayehaertpixistix:	What do you do when you aren't fucking?
acidjhonen:	i see,,,,,sounds fun
acidjhonen:	im at janies house more than mine, we don't have sex all 
that 
often....
ayehaertpixistix:	My parents are so strict.
ayehaertpixistix:	You know I'm 17?
acidjhonen:	i see, so no Rave parties in your room i assume
ayehaertpixistix:	Maybe they treat me the way they do because I look 
12.
acidjhonen:	yes i do
ayehaertpixistix:	No, man, I roll all the time anyway.
acidjhonen:	happy birthday....really late
acidjhonen:	probably
ayehaertpixistix:	eh, thanks. Just about a month and a day late.
acidjhonen:	oregano?
ayehaertpixistix:	What?
acidjhonen:	no problem, i always wish happy birthday to my fans
ayehaertpixistix:	Since when am I a fan?
acidjhonen:	Stephen convinced you to do drugs yet?
ayehaertpixistix:	Eh, I'm really not into drugs.
acidjhonen:	always
ayehaertpixistix:	I'm on hydrocone at the minute.
ayehaertpixistix:	hydrocodone
acidjhonen:	you got my name right, and please at least call me ""dirty 
rat 
bastard""
ayehaertpixistix:	Eh, I'll think about it.
acidjhonen:	ooh, hydrocodone...living on the edge i see
ayehaertpixistix:	Don't call me a midget!
acidjhonen:	ok shorty
ayehaertpixistix:	You're so clever.
acidjhonen:	thanks
ayehaertpixistix:	ajsdfosiajfoi!
acidjhonen:	dont do drugs with Stephen, he'll buy the cheap shit
ayehaertpixistix:	He's stingy.
acidjhonen:	ok?  why do you do that?
ayehaertpixistix:	eh.
acidjhonen:	yes he is
ayehaertpixistix:	Random outburst.
acidjhonen:	sounds fun
acidjhonen:	i dont do drugs anymore....bad for the skin
ayehaertpixistix:	Stephen was a weird kid, wasn't he?
ayehaertpixistix:	He's weird now.
acidjhonen:	why?
acidjhonen:	he was very odd....peculiar even
ayehaertpixistix:	Well, we were talking about how he loved cheese 
sandwiches.. and.. he's just.. silly.
acidjhonen:	he is obsessed with a boy named Tom
ayehaertpixistix:	He thinks Tom's a little bi-curious.
ayehaertpixistix:	I like Tom's walk.
acidjhonen:	i....see.....
acidjhonen:	i think Stephen thinks that because he hopes that Tom is
acidjhonen:	Tom is an odd boy
acidjhonen:	I convinced Brittni once that Stephen was gay
ayehaertpixistix:	But Brittni's homophobic.
ayehaertpixistix:	And Stephen isn't gay.
ayehaertpixistix:	And you know Brittni... once something gets in her 
head 
(which can be difficult to do...) it's even harder to get out.
acidjhonen:	yes she is, violently homophobic...and you never know with 
Stephen
acidjhonen:	exactly, it was very fun to watch though
acidjhonen:	im pretty sure she blamed me for him being gay....
ayehaertpixistix:	He's not GAY.
ayehaertpixistix:	I'm not GAY.
acidjhonen:	sure bailey, sure
acidjhonen:	maybe that's why you two are so good together, you both 
think 
that you arent gay
ayehaertpixistix:	I think you're trying to make me think that Stephen's 
gay, 
the same way you did with Brittni.
ayehaertpixistix:	And Stephen's trying to convince me that I'm gay.
ayehaertpixistix:	And I think Tom's at least bi.
acidjhonen:	hmm....does he ever ask for anal sex?
acidjhonen:	every girl is a potential lesbian if she likes oral
acidjhonen:	girls are better at oral than guys are for some reason
ayehaertpixistix:	I really like oral and I'm really good at it.
acidjhonen:	good on girls or guys?
ayehaertpixistix:	Guys
ayehaertpixistix:	Well, guy.
ayehaertpixistix:	Stephen's my first dick.
acidjhonen:	sounds precious
ayehaertpixistix:	I really like getting oral... I don't mind giving, 
though.
ayehaertpixistix:	hah, yeah
acidjhonen:	girls also tend to be better on girls, if they are good on 
guys
acidjhonen:	sounds like a closet case to me
ayehaertpixistix:	ME?
acidjhonen:	yep
ayehaertpixistix:	I find the vagina to actually be very gross.
ayehaertpixistix:	I'm not attracted to genitalia.
acidjhonen:	you have all the potential to be a lesbian, i think all 
you'd 
need is an outlet
ayehaertpixistix:	I couldn't be a lesbian.
ayehaertpixistix:	Bi, yeah, okay maybe.
ayehaertpixistix:	Probably.
acidjhonen:	it's not so bad after awhile
ayehaertpixistix:	But not 100%.
acidjhonen:	dick was probably scary the first time too
ayehaertpixistix:	Yeah.
acidjhonen:	that's what i assumed
acidjhonen:	and Stephen is probably Bi too
ayehaertpixistix:	Why do you say that?
acidjhonen:	55% girl 45% guy
acidjhonen:	for both of you
ayehaertpixistix:	hahah, nice.
acidjhonen:	he seems overly fascinated with Tom
acidjhonen:	and he scares me when he does his gay impression
acidjhonen:	i feel the need to beat him up and tie him to a fence post
ayehaertpixistix:	That's awful.
acidjhonen:	it was a joke
ayehaertpixistix:	I figured
ayehaertpixistix:	but still.
ayehaertpixistix:	Stephen has nice fingernails and plenty of vitamin C.
acidjhonen:	he probably gives himself a manicure
acidjhonen:	he's also pretty uptight about the hair
acidjhonen:	he won't go to Burger King without fixing it
acidjhonen:	convinced you yet?
ayehaertpixistix:	Nope.
acidjhonen:	spit or swallow?
acidjhonen:	90 calories in a teaspoon of semen
ayehaertpixistix:	I swallow.
ayehaertpixistix:	I think it'd make me sad if my girlfriend spit it 
out.
acidjhonen:	Janie won't, says it's disgusting
ayehaertpixistix:	It's really not that bad at all.
ayehaertpixistix:	Eh, well...
ayehaertpixistix:	People are different I suppose.
ayehaertpixistix:	I don't mind.
acidjhonen:	so do you ever get the urge to suck dick?
ayehaertpixistix:	Yeah.
ayehaertpixistix:	And I act on it, if I can.
acidjhonen:	so does nikki, i think you're both freaks
ayehaertpixistix:	It took 2 minutes once, and my door was open the 
whole 
time. It was actually really cool.
acidjhonen:	ever get the urge to go down on a girl?
acidjhonen:	odd...odd girl
ayehaertpixistix:	Only if I'm getting head at the time.  And not that 
often.
ayehaertpixistix:	Hey! I think 2 minutes is pretty damn good. 
Respectable 
even.
acidjhonen:	i see, so you are openly bi-curious?
ayehaertpixistix:	Not until right now.
ayehaertpixistix:	Don't tell people... it still semi-freaks me out.
acidjhonen:	pretty good....id just rather not think about you sucking 
my 
friends penis
ayehaertpixistix:	And I think Brittni would kick my ass.
acidjhonen:	i see
acidjhonen:	i didnt plan on it
acidjhonen:	probably
acidjhonen:	in one of her drug induced rages
acidjhonen:	i still think Stephen is Bi
ayehaertpixistix:	Eh. I don't.
ayehaertpixistix:	Brittni's amusing when stoned.
acidjhonen:	sure, sure, tell yourself that
acidjhonen:	i...see?
acidjhonen:	to me, she is a hypocrite now, and not fit to talk to
acidjhonen:	for some reason, i'm remembering the last, deep 
conversation 
Field and I had....
ayehaertpixistix:	I haven't talked to her since school let out because 
we 
have nothing to say to each other. I'll call her on her birthday, 
though, 
because I do that...
ayehaertpixistix:	I'm a hypocrite + you're talking to me...
acidjhonen:	i dont, but when's her birthday?
acidjhonen:	how are you a hypocrite?
ayehaertpixistix:	July 11th
ayehaertpixistix:	I just am.
ayehaertpixistix:	Most people are.
ayehaertpixistix:	I'm bad about talking about people.

acidjhonen:	i see?
acidjhonen:	poor kid, that just makes you short, not hypocritical
ayehaertpixistix:	FUCK YOU. haha. Ask Stephen.
acidjhonen:	no thanks
acidjhonen:	have you ever talked for an hour or more about how to 
properly 
kill someone?
ayehaertpixistix:	No, I'm squeamish.
acidjhonen:	hmm...juicy
ayehaertpixistix:	eh
ayehaertpixistix:	I mean, ew.
acidjhonen:	that was me and Field's last real conversation....long time 
ago
acidjhonen:	creamy
ayehaertpixistix:	Yeah?
ayehaertpixistix:	I HATE THE WORD CREAMY! aljfoiaisdi!
acidjhonen:	yeah....she was weird, but we got along
acidjhonen:	semen is kind of creamy
ayehaertpixistix:	She's weird and thinks I'm really weird + creepy.
acidjhonen:	vaginal fluid is more juicy than creamy though
ayehaertpixistix:	It's not that creamy.
acidjhonen:	i see?
acidjhonen:	i miss harassing her
acidjhonen:	in a non-sexual manner of course
acidjhonen:	you typed creamy
ayehaertpixistix:	Damn you.
ayehaertpixistix:	Damn you to hell!
ayehaertpixistix:	So, you agree that men can be sexy?
ayehaertpixistix:	But you are just straight?
acidjhonen:	i have 2 names and i dont use either
acidjhonen:	yes
ayehaertpixistix:	Interesting.
ayehaertpixistix:	I have a diary and a LJ.
acidjhonen:	Ed norton and James Dean are sexy
ayehaertpixistix:	They're both not interesting.
ayehaertpixistix:	What about Pitt in Fight Club?
acidjhonen:	he's ok....Norton is still better though
ayehaertpixistix:	I agree.
ayehaertpixistix:	I think Christina Ricci is sexy.
acidjhonen:	i used to be obsessed with the girl
acidjhonen:	same with tiffany taylor
ayehaertpixistix:	Hmm...
acidjhonen:	i have a picture of James Dean and Edward Norton next to my 
bed
acidjhonen:	gah, you are still reminding me of Field
acidjhonen:	she told me I was gay because of that
ayehaertpixistix:	I don't think you're gay. I do find that amusing 
though.
ayehaertpixistix:	She ever ask if you masturbated to it?
acidjhonen:	i thought i told you to stop reminding me of her, and not 
that i 
recall
acidjhonen:	i made a deal with her that if a black man walked into 
dennys 
and put his dick in my drink, id suck it though
ayehaertpixistix:	hah
ayehaertpixistix:	Gotta love the black cock.
ayehaertpixistix:	Or at least respect it.

7/8/02 12:25 AM

ayehaertpixistix:	I only remind you of Field because I'm small. And you 
think I'm super-hot and it bothers you.
ayehaertpixistix:	hah!
ayehaertpixistix:	You say anything while I was gone?
acidjhonen:	no
acidjhonen:	i dont find you sexually attractive at all
acidjhonen:	and you keep bringing stuff up that reminds me of her
ayehaertpixistix:	Sorry.?
acidjhonen:	you get the black cock/dennys message?
acidjhonen:	you should be
ayehaertpixistix:	Yeah,  I did.
ayehaertpixistix:	Stephen and I have decided on having an open 
relationship.. did I tell you that?
acidjhonen:	quit reminding me of Field
acidjhonen:	no?
ayehaertpixistix:	Yeah, well, we did.
ayehaertpixistix:	What'd I do this time??
acidjhonen:	open as in what?
acidjhonen:	everything
ayehaertpixistix:	Yeah. We can fool around with other people so long as 
well 
tell each other about it.
acidjhonen:	i see
ayehaertpixistix:	You think it's gonna work?
acidjhonen:	so you can practice your bisexuality i guess....as can he
acidjhonen:	no
acidjhonen:	never does
ayehaertpixistix:	Who do you think will have a problem with it?
acidjhonen:	hmm....i dont know
ayehaertpixistix:	I'm not a jealous person, and neither's Stephen. We 
love 
each other. I think it'll work.
acidjhonen:	sex/sexual activities are supposed to have feelings behind 
it/them....sometimes...it's just a problem
ayehaertpixistix:	Eh, you're probably right."

Overview:  Afghans fired guns into the air to celebrate at a wedding.  US planes mistakenly bombed them.  Reports say up to 120 killed or wounded.

Oh well, they deserved it...those stupid towelheads dont deserve to celebrate or be happy! They should be mourning the fact that they practice different customs than i do and will end up burning in hell for worshiping a pagan god!"

I was mad happy. It was so cute she was telling me hes mad shy and won't come up to me to talk or even give me his number and like a 10 year old he made Amina do it. It made me in a mad good mood the whole day. I forgot what this is like. Its so fun. Like just the rush you get and the whole excitement. I called him a little while ago and we talked and I duno eeeeeee. I wana invite him to the shindig on saturday because Tamika has to quit so were all celebrating at some club/lounge type place and everyone from work is gona be there anyway but I have a feeling he wouldnt go=\. Whatever.

"event","Saturday was awesome. I called up Joey to come chill and he told me to bring a friend. I went with Marina to his friends house and we chilled. Smoked muuuuucho, drank. Then we went to destination number 2 and smoked mucho again. It was hott cuz it was pouring rain and we went into the backyard to smoke in this tent while it was pouring. Very nice. Then we chilled for a little while and went to destination number three which was marinas cousins house in which we smoked another blunt. It was like our very own little adventure. Then I slept over. It was our first time chillen like this after we broke up with our bfs. I had a lot a lot of fun. Crappy detail of what happened but w/e i'm lazy

Yesterday Julian was like bugging out. He wanted to see me so like the dick I am I went to go chill and calm him down. He started crying and everything and was so determined to let me know shit wasn't gona be the same. Then it started to drizzle so we went to his house. That killed me. He just kept crying and crying and I knew he wanted to say something he just couldnt. He finally said it and told me that he doesnt love me but he thinks hes in love with me. He cant live with out me bla bla. THen the song ""dangerously in love"" came on like RIGHT after he said that and it was really creepy. Then like i duno it was really hard. But i didnt give him an answer. I thought ok lets say we are gona get back and shit really does change like he says. We'll be 'happy' for like a month or two or however long and it's still eventually gonna lead to a break up again only this time its gona be harder because we would be even more use to eachother. It seems like such a stupid thing to do. But I am a little curious what it would be like but w/e. Yesterday Julian was like "" you love seeing me like this."" I do=p cuzz you know what? Paybacks a fucking bitch !"

Tuesday- We chilled with Nicky and Rich again. Then went by Trump and saw everyone we didnt see in a while.

Wednesday- I had an open crib. Julian came over with Rich and we smoked a blunt with my brother. Twas nice. After the blunt Julian and I motivate to the kitchen and Rich just stays in the room with my brother so we were like hm ok. We ate then we motivated to the living room and watched Entourage. Rich was still in the room with my brother so we figured they were talking but Rich is mad wierd and never talks so w/e i duno. He finally comes out after like 45 min and we were all watching tv and shit. I go back in my room to get something and my brother is like "" Yoooo, that kid Rich is crazy ! He was just sitting there the whole time watching me be on the computer. It was really akward. And like I didn't know how to get this kid out of here and go chill with you guys. For mad long I'm thinkin how I could get him out of here and I couldnt think of something. Then I just decided to turn off the music cuz it was pissing me off. So he gets up and he leaves."" Haha Rich is such a wierdo. He always just sits for hours in the same spot looking at the same spot and thinking everytime we chill. No joke. W/e after that Julian and I went to Keyfood to pick up his check. I decided to apply for a job there and the guy told me to come in for training so I was like no doubt. Um after that we called up Ilya and smoked another blunt with him. Twas gay.

Thursday- Went to training. The girl who trained me is a psychopath. Um it was pretty easy.After that I went by Julians house and I see Ilya and somebitch already outside so I thought some shit was up. But it wasnt. Good boy =). We went to Ilyas house and smoked. Then played some Tony Hawk. Julian was saying how theres gona be a sick party tonight and bla bla bla and hes gona go and get twisted bla bla bla. He asked if I could go but I had two tests on Friday so I had to study. And he was like totally cool with it and then he was like ""aight Ilya so if shes not going you are and were getting FUUUCKED UP."" Like he totally never cares if I go somewhere with him chilling wise. That pisses me off so much.  W/e I'll show him...

Friday- Julian worked till 8 so I just went to the city with my mom. We actually got along ! I got mad shit =). Only two sweaters which kinda sucks but I got a lot of crap. I got cute socks, cute bra, cute thongs, mad good perfume all this hair conditioning shining shampoo mask crap and a new Ceramic blow dryer and Iron =D. Oh and I got Julian a sweater too. Dont worry Alla, I'm still gona use the iron you gave me just not on the ends lol.

Saturday- Went to training and when I finished Julian had to come in until 6. So I came home and did a full length grooming. Shower-shave-eyebrows-nails-toes-hair. I was done by the time he got off work so I met him by his house. He had an open crib but it wasnt for as long it was suppose to be. We smoked a blunt then ate mad munchies. After that I was just so out of it and just started to act like a total bitch because Julian said or did something that really made me mad. I forgot what. W/e I passed out after being bored out of my mind. And I wake up I'm like oh shit I gota go home ! He told me to relax and that a cab was gona be downstairs in two min and he gives me a bag that had chinese food because he ordered some for himself and he got me the thing I always get. It was really sweet. 

Today- PARTAYYYYYY WHOO !"

"event","Yea so this whole Julian working thing is really nice lol. Usually on a Saturday I would go to his house relatively early and do nothing till the evening because that's when everyone would come out anyway. But he worked till 5 and I got so many things done holy shit. I cleaned my room,did laundry, did homework, actually started to make a study sheet for a test thats on friday (since when do I even make study sheets?) and I got to relax and watch a few episodes of Sex and the City. Twas nice =). After that was pretty whack though. I met up with him we smoked with Drizzy and we went to his house and passed out. I wake up I see its 1:00 am. I started bugging out because my mom was gona kill me. I didn't think she would believe me that I passed out and just woke up because I tried to pull that shit with her before so I would have an excuse for chillen later but w/e it all worked out."

"event","Again Julian is out chillen with his friends and not me. I actually stooped as low as crying this time. Like it's fucking pathetic. I have nobody to call anymore. Like where did they go ? Its really sad like I don't have a social life anymore, I dont have a job and support myself like most people do my age and I go out with a total bum. The asshole scumbagged me lovely today. He called me when he got out of work and w/e we were talking and implyed we were gona come out later because we were tired and then smoke a blunt. So he I/Ms  me and says he was gona go meet up with Drizzy (they ALWAYS meet up to smoke) and then call me later. I assumed he was gona call me when he got the blunt or w/e but I was way off apparently. I called after like a good 45 min passed because I was like wtf?

""Where are you?""
-""Chillen""
[people in background]
""Who you with""
-""Drizzy, Ilya and Irina""
""Oh werddd ? What are you guys doin?""
-""Bout to smoke""
[silence]
-""Baby I have no mins i'll call you later""

I give him an attitude and tell him to have fun and I hang up. A little immature but like wtf? Like he goes and chills with everyone? UM HELLOOOOOOO, yes I do exist and I believe we had plans of some sort? Wtf is wrong with him. I got so fucking upset. THen he has the nerve to say I choose my friends over him you know, the one or two times I ever chill with them for a few hours. LIKE UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Then he decides to call back and hour later and he's all laughing and so is everyone else because they obviously got very high. So he asks what I'm gona do and I go "" I duno, but I assume that you're to burnt so you're gona go home eat and pass out for a little then wake up and be in the shitty after high mood and not want to do anything."" He had nothing to say. And its like he knows that like Im just sitting home. Wow I'm gona fucking show him wtf it feels like so fucking good one day. I just have to wait for the perfect moment cuz patience is a fucking virtue."

"event","MY BROTHERS BDAY WAS OFF THE KRUCHOK ! So good... oh so good.

OK so like first we went to Briannas bday which was mad wierd. Ok so their aunt Lisa is married to this Jamaican rastafarian( however you spell it) dude whos name is Ricky. He's freaky mon. They have 3 kids who are also black. Rickys Jamaican friend, dudes wife and their two kids were there too. First time I've been in a house with so many chernuhi. Yea so it was really beat. Mad kids and stuff. We didn't get to smoke and I didn't drink because I was just gona drink at my brothers party.

Fast foward >>

We get to my brothers party and I get introduced to everyone and theyre like "" Wow, you're not what we pictured Rob with a wig "" Lmao. It was such a great environment. Everybody had a really great sense of humor. Nobody could get weed so that was a bummer. So Julian and I take a seat at the table and start drinking. Everyone else was on the deck though. My brother comes in and sees us sitting there and he goes "" You guys sure you don't wana go outside, you know...where the party is !"" lol So w/e news breaks out that we finally got a dealer to deliver a fucking $100 of weed. I was like ohhh this is gona be gooood, OH SO FUCKING GOOD ! So ye the guy FINALLY comes and it just looked mad beatiful. The pipes, joints, hookahs and all the goodness gets whipped out. We all start smoking and it was very weed friendly. People would come inside and someone would scream "" Hey wana smoke?""  and they would go "" OK !...youve convinced me"" I got soo gone. Everyone smoked till their eyes bled. And there were such a variety of ways to do it and eveyones is just changing smoking utensils haha. Julian and I ended up sitting at that table in those seats for about a good 3 hours haha. I couldnt move. There was this guy Marty who was smoking with us and then he left to go on the deck. He came back after a half hour and hes like "" Wow you guys are still smoking"" , then he smoked some more with us and left again. He came back after another hour and he was like "" Woww you guys are STILL smoking"" left back to the deck after he smoked with us again"" Came back after like another hour and hes like "" YOU GUYS ARE STILL FUCKING SMOKING !?"" , smoked with us and left again haha it was so funny and redundant. Mad shit was like significantly funny but it was all high moments that you totally forget when you sober up. Julian and I eventually got up to play some foozeball which he kicked my ass in. I SWEAR THAT TABLE WAS TILTED ! My brother kept coming in and out reminding us there was a party outside if we wanted to join haha. Yea but I definately have to chill with him more often. Everyone is really cool and funny. Ummm yea so we basically had this weed fest/ marathon. Just non stop smoking and you would think after a while youd just stop but noOoo, everyone wanted more and more and just kept going and going. At one point some kid was like "" I cant smoke anymore"" and some kid smacks him and said some shit like fool whats wrong with you. But yeh he kept smoking lol. Wow I seriously havent even gotten high at Steves house like this. I woke up today and I was STILL HIGh ! Yea I duno half the shit I really dont remember but it was really fun. We were pretty antisocial for the most part, but like we had a lot of fun, we got to know everyone. Definatly have to go to another one of these things .."

"event","OK so yesterday was cool. I went to the gym in the morning then came home. I was just chillen in my room and my brother tells me how he was with his gf and they put on "" A Nightmare Before Christmas"" on mute and then turned on the  TOOL album and everything matched perfectly. So I made him do it and it really did. If I was high that shit would bug me out so much. W/e it was really cool. At night I went to Amandas house cuz her parents just went to Vegas. Julie was about to get punched as always. SHe finally left then Ali<3 came. What a comedian lol. We chilled in the house and ate icecream while talked. Oh so Julian was with BrAd all day and he called me when he just came home but like I just got to Amandas so I told him that I was gona chill there but if he wanted I could come down for a lil. He took it like oh thanks for a lil thats all I get and he felt like I was choosing my friends over him. WTF LIKE ? Yo everytime I chill with my friends it's a sin I swear. Yea so we were talking and I was like if your mood decides to change and you would like to see me throw me a call and he told me it def wasn't so I was like aiiight, peace. SO then like 5 min later there was this mad big BOOM ! Amanda, Ali and I go on the balcony and Ali goes "" ARE YOU DRUNK AND DO YOU NEED AN AMBULANCE ?"" cause we didn't see shit. I get a call and it's Julian saying to come down the accident looks sick. Its funny. It took a car accident for us to see eachother. Yea the accident was w/e. It was pretty bad but not as cool as it sounded lol. After that I stayed with Julian cuz Amanda was goin to some guys house. Walked around with Richie mon then went home.

"event","Today was really fun too =). Well, more relaxing really. I chilled with Alla during the day. We did the usuaul. We found a bench sat and played ""Therapist"" lol. It was nice. We walked around and it was pretty hot and my mom wasn't home and I just wanted to go to my house. W/e I finally convinced my mom to let her come and it was mucho nice. We read a lil bit of LJ entries from back in the day. Then I shared Six Feet Under<3 with her. I told her what happened though so it wasn't as good but atleast she got to see what I was talking about. She got me on what I was talking about so that was cool. We got exhausted from watching episode after episode so we went outside. Oh before we left I called Julian because I didn't see him all day cuz he went shopping with Brad then they got drunk or w/e and apparently he thought there was no point for seeing me even if it was for an hour. I called him again when I was with Alla because we were gona have to go by his way anyway and he was doing graffiti and couldnt talk to me at the same time since you know, he was so occupied with important things. He was just pissing me off a lot that I didnt even know if I wanted to meet him. It was just fucking up my day. W/o him it was mad peaceful now this bs. W/e he was mad fucked up he was sayin how he's really drunk right now and if we meet he can't walk me home cuz of his state and it was just so retarded. ALEX WALKS ALLA ALL THE WAY TO CGATE AND BACK! WTF like its a 7 min walk. W/e I just got really mad. W/e he was sooo nice enough and considerate that he wanted to come meet me that fucking asshole. So I'm waiting on the bench for a good 15 min when it's like a 5 min walk. Just when I was gona leave he calls me and he was on some bike out of breath. Cops chased him because they saw him tagging up and he ran and stole some bike he found. Then Brad comes out of nowhere sweating balls and they were like ""Omg that was so crazy, omg."" I'm just there rolling my eyes and shit. THen Julian starts acting really nice saying how he missed me a lot [ but chilling for an hour when you miss me is too much to ask for]. THen he sits down and he's smoking a stoge and I asked if I could have one and he said he only has four for the night so I was like fine dont give me one. Then we walk to where he caught his tags so I can look like I really give a fuck and he lights another stoge. SO ofcourse I'm like ""Oh but you only got 4 for the night , what are you doing?"" And he was getting mad like he always does when I have a point. W/e I was in just such a shitty mood I wanted to cry. Especially when he was like "" BRad what was I telling youall day?"" Brad was just lookin with a blank look... "" Uhh that you miss her???"" And Julian was like "" Na she's gona be mad at me when I see her cuz I didn't call"" IF HE KNEW I WAS GONA BE MAD IF HE DIDNT CALL WHY THE FUCK DIDNT HE CALL! I was explaining why I was mad and hes like "" I'm sorry I didn't mean too , I really didn't."" It's just like common fucking sense. Like all this crap is common fucking sense. Wow. He kept being extra nice because I was mad and he realized I was right plus he was super drunk and it was pathetic that that's what it takes for him to be nice. OHHHHH OHHH BEST FUCKING PART ! 
J: DO you want anything from the store?
A: Sure.    ..... How do you have money?
J: Don't worry I got.
A: Yea I'll get a drink I guess [He gives me $2 and I'm just staring at it] So, you couldn't break any of these dollar bills for a quarter to call me?
J: I didn't have it at the time
A: Riiigght.

UGH !!!!! UGHHHHHHHHHHHH ! Like wtf. W/e I so didn't wana deal with him I just wanted to cry cuz my bf was aninconsiderate asshole and he doesn't even realize it which makes it suck so much more. How can someone not realize these things? W/e we were in front of his building saw Allas Alex then Nick drove Alex and I home."

It was so pimped out they had motor cycles and shit in the front mad bottles and a whole buffet thing in the backyard. So sick. They had 2 bars and shit and I came up to the guy and I'm like can I have a ""Cranberry Vodka please"". So he takes the cup pours half vodka and half cranberry it mustve been like 3 shots in there im like whoa. I came back after 20 min and I asked for another one but not with that much vodka this time so he puts 3/4 vodka and 1/4 cranberry,potz. W/e I guess he was drunk himself lol.So yea we chilled and shit, ate some goodness,drank some more. Shishliki so good...oh so good. Then we went to meet up with Dray for like 10 min and give him a beer. We chilled in the backyard after closer to the music smoked a stoge and shit. It was mad chill. Music was actually good not gay Russian music. There were maddd people there. It was a straight up party. The guy who did all of it and owns the salon is filthy rich. He's a really good guy though. Like very people person he's mad chill. He has two little kids one of them is so adorable omg, but mad spoiled- duh. Before we left we stole a bottle of Hennessy lol ;]. Oh da! That shit is like a $30 bottle of goodness. Yea so after that we left and went by 100 for a lil. Came home after and had some wildness. Chilled then went downstairs to meet Ekso and I took a cab with home with him and Rich cuz they were goin to the movies or w/e. Yea I'm whacked right now lol but I had a really good time it was fun."

We came back up and we were just laying down and stuff and all I could pay attention to were his GINORMOUS lips. Like holy shiit if you take his lips and put them next to mine for example, his are like double the size of mine. They're really really big. Like I always use to make fun of him for having nigger lips but I never payed attention to them like that lol. Yea so anyway. I duno we just chilled out then I came home. Chilled with my brother. I saw him pull out like a 50 of weed and it smelled sooo yummy. It was like blueberry some shit but it really did smell fruity  like. He was like"" I duno, it smells like weed to me""lol it was funny. But yea so I smoked again and got even more fucked up. But I really liked the blueberry shits. They only come in 50s so you know that shit is bang bangs. Its mad smooth and tingles you're throat. You don't cough at all. Plus we smoked out of a pipe - oh yea ! That was followed by a Marlboro Menthol Light<3. So good. Oh so good. Ahh I love my brother. I duno like lately we smoke together during the after hours cuz both of us can't sleep anyway. Thats like our chill time its cool. We make fun of our parents and stuff =) lol. Yea so that would be all, keep it real..."

Porn star? What? ;]
Lloyd banks:  First I would take you into my room throw you on the bed, then start kissing you and slowly start to undress you. I would next grab the honey and pour it all over you first starting from your chest moving my way down slowly. Then when I'm finished putting that sweet honey all over your body i'd lock yo ass in a room full of bees !"

"event","Yesterday was really fun! lol I did a whole lot of nothing all day which was not so fun,but the night time was a- okay. Julian and I went to meet up with Rich and cop a blunt. Rich is such a character lmao. He never makes sense. Anywho so we go into the kiddie park/ monkey bar things in Warbass and do our thing there. The White Owl cracked in half so we just cyphered two small blunts. I got wrecked! I didn't even finish the second half. Rich took like 4 pulls and he was chillen lol. So when we finish we just start crackin up at stupid shit and we get mad quiet. I felt a drop and everyone starts feeling more drops and the next thing you know it's pouring. So I run to a little roof thingy on the monkey bars and Julian chills in the tube slide thingy and Richie is in the middle of us getting soaked mad confused haha. There was nowhere else left for him to go where he couldn't get wet. So w/e he goes with Julian in the tube slide which they found to be very uncomfortable so Rich just went home. I got bored of sitting by myself so I went into the tube slide with Julian. I also realied it wasnt that comfortable. I was wearing Chinese slippers so I wasn't able to hold myself up with my feet , like he was doing with sneakers on. So ye I kept slipping then i couldn't grab on to the top. Then it turned into this whole like big thing for me to reach the top so I could hold on cause if you go to the bottom theres maddddddddd water on the slide and you get soakedddd. So Julian literally with one arm pushes my whole body mad high till I can finally reach. I grab it and pull myself up and next thing I know Julian slipped while trying to help me and he got mad soacked. Hehe sorry 0=x. Very nice little high moment.... you had to be high for it. I duno but like yea that was pretty much the highlight of the day lol."

Anywho 4th of July was aight. I got into a big fight with Julian during the daytime cuz he was acting like a jerkoff. I didn't feel like waiting for him so I went to meet up with Alla, Alex, Lyuba, Eugene, Paul, the other Alex and later on Linda and Anna came through also. We waited for Julian for like an hour. And by the time he came with all them mad people left. It was so gay. W/e we started the bbq and they brought two bottles of Absinthe and shit. I really like how that shit tastes but everyone kept saying how much they hate it- losers lol. W/e so we chilled on the beach watched the fireworks, usual 4th of July shit. Me and Julian had some tensions going on cuz I was still mad at him. We made up but then I went skinny dipping and he got mad at me so we had tensions- AGAIN. Yea so we all chilled got fucked up smoked and ehh oh yea Julian lost his phone. Sucks for him =\. Yea so I dunno that was my July 4th.

"event","This week was quite an interesting one. Well first off, I didn't go to school all week because I got a stupid nose infection out of all infections. Anyway so this is what went down :

Monday: I call Julian at like 1:00 to let him know that I'm up and didn't go to school and his mom told me that he already left at will be back at 5. I was straight up just like WTF? Where could he be.  Then I was like w/e he'll call me when I usually get out of school. 2:00 passes, then 2:15, then 2:30 and finally at 3 he calls me. Apparently he thought I still got out of school at 2:45 which is really fucked up because i've been calling him at 2 for quite a few weeks already, but oh "" it's not like he's always looking at the clock when I call."" W/e so he said he was on Kingshwy with Raquel and Faina to get a haircut and they're gona get out of there soon and go home. Ok so like it's like 5 something and still no call back so I call again and he's like yea we're gona leave in 20 min. I didn't feel like waiting around and needed to talk so I called up  my nigga Alla <3 We had a mini bonding session then went outside to bum stoges. He calls me around 7 to tell me he got home. I love how it took four hours to get home! Then I ask if he's gona come out and he gives me this bs that he was suppose to be home at 5 and he came home late so now they're not letting him go outside . And I know him, If he really wants to come outside to see me, he will make up some sort of bs and come outside. But i guess he was too tired and fucked up this time. Anyway so Alla and I sat down across the street from 100 and tried to figure out my breakup with him. Bla bla bla FASTFOWARD- so I call him and ask if he could come downstairs cuz I need to talk and he said he doesn't know if Papa Dukes will let bla bla so I said that it wasn't that serious it's gona be 10 min or so and if it's that big of a problem i'll come upstairs. He's like ok ok. so FASTTT FOWARD- He comes downstairs and we start talkin I tell him everything I wana tell him and I see his eyes watering and shit. Then he told me it's gona be really hard but he's gona try to change.   [ He did most of the shit for one day perfectly the next day not so great and now the 'trying' pretty much wore off just like I knew it was gona happen]. Yea so we make up and then I see Lu Raquel and Faina oh and this is the best part! When they all came down to chill, we all chilled for the rest of the night meanwhile mister Julian has absolutely nooo way of chillen cuz his Dad is maddd pissed yo. UGH!

Tuesday- Stayed home 

Wednesday- Went to Doctor in the morning. Then called Julian and he told me they were all going to the city and for me to come la la la but I was too sick so my mom wouldn't let me go. Stayed home then came back out at night for an hour when they came back. It was blah

Thursday- HAPPY 3 MONTHS! ;] Cut school and went to his house in the morning. I got mad paranoid. Ok I made a deal with Lu to meet me at 8:30 downstairs to open the door while hes walking the dog. Hes like ok but if you come late by anychance I always leave the house at 8 :45 sharp for work. So I wake up and I look at the watch i see it says :20 so I thought it was 6:20 and i'll rest for 10 more min. I look again after 10 min and its 8:30. I was like fucckkk I have to meet Lu. I left in 5 min then ran to catch a bus I didn't have a metrocard for but still schemed it and got on anyway and got to the house and had no watch. I was just sitting there hoping Lu didn't leave and then I see him after a few min and I was like pheww. I went up to his room we passed out. Woke up went to the Vet then chilled a lil. Came back chilled on OP, went to Iras bday , went back to his house. It was a w/e day. He got me a cute gift though =). The thing that bugged me was he had an open crib for like 2 hours after I left home and shit and I was talking to him when he was really fucked up and telling him how I didnt want to go to school tomorrow because it was pointless to go on a Friday and hes like ill ask my mom but I doubt shell let. And once again, if he really wanted me to he would find a bs way to manipulate her into letting me come like he always does when he WANTS to. W/e he said she was whiling out and said no so I was like ok no doubt. Then I find out Faina was sleeping over and I was like wtf? Oh she can sleep over but I cant come in the morning? Wow w/e I got mad pissed I didnt even bother talking on the phone anymore. 

Friday- Chillleed, got super whacked, had a girl actually agree to slapbox me!! But Julian didnt let cuz I was too fucked up =\ .

Saturday- I FORGOT HOW GOOD I COULD SLAPBOX! I can honestly say that from fighting Julian, and those few little pointers he gave me, really did a lot. We got mad whacked again at 100 mad early around 6 or so. Then everyone just started to want to slap box. Ok here were my tournaments
Ekso- He beat me twice but I got him good the third fight [left him a mark =)]
Alan- FUCKED him up
Richi- Fucked him up
Faina- Fights the funnest way. She turns her head then charges at you swinging her hands w/o looking at what shes doing. But I still got her both fights.
Vee- Tie , she did a little bit of the Faina thing but its all good. She broke a nail! Like Ohhh My God!

Yea so it was exciting to fight girls for the first time but not so exciting for the fact that they dont use tac tics they turn their head and just start hitting anything. I woke up today with a really big bruise on my forearm [no wonder it hurt to move yesterday!] and mad scratches on my hands. Ok now if you'll excuse me I have hair that is in need of straightening."

Yesterday I was shown a really great time. At first, my night started out unbelievably shitty and Eric was pissing me off like whoa. I wanted to go chill anyway so I called up Jeff. He was with Ralph but was leaving to a wedding so Ralph asked if I wanted to burn with him. Couldn't say no to that. He came to pick me up by my house. He FINALLY got his car back. Anywho, at first it was pretty gay. He had to take care of a whole bunch of things and shit. I had to wait for a lot of the time. We finally went to go pick up and then we went to Johns store to roll lol. We finally had the blunt and hit the road. This is where it all began lol. First of all, the blunt was gorgeous- props to me. We had like a 40 in there it was so nice and fat. We hit the highway and he blasted crazy motherfuckin trance. I was really really high and i actually felt like I was trripping from the music. It was blasting and he has a sick bass. I was chewing on plastic and everything lol. I was looking out the window towards the ocean and he started to drive crazy and it was just a very relaxing moment. The whole time I was just like wow, how the fuck can he drive right now? I wouldn't be able to drive like that right now in this condition. So I asked him. Then, he offered ME to drive? I was like really? I got really excited. My first time driving high. He let me even drive on the road but I was too paranoid so we went on top of Stop and Shop lol. It was really cool! I got like a rush type thing going on. I really dont know how people go fast and do all that stupid shit though. Oh, and people REALLY DO drive better high. Last time when I drove Max's car, I fucked up a lottt more. After that the CD was still going and the trance remix of the no doubt song comes on and I just bug out. I was looking for this song for the longest time and Paul being the dick he is, never gave me his CD to burn. Oh and Jeff kept calling because he wanted to come chill too but I really didnt want him there being the ""dope head"" I am and all. It was really funny one time when he called he was really pissing me off cuz he didn't take a hint very well when we didn't pick up, so I picked up and I was like "" We're shooting up heroine right now, we'll call you back."" haha so he calls back and I go "" Guy, what did I just tell you? GIve it some time."" and I clicked. =D hehe We were cracking up hysterically forever. I don't remember anything else significant that happened. W/e he just drived me home and gave me the CD. I got really really happy and just gave him a huge hug. I've never seen Ralph be well, nice. I got up stairs and I just felt mad please, like I had a really fun time on a Monday night lol- Smoked phat blunt, felt like I was trippen, going like 90 or some shit on the highway, CD .. =)"

Whatever, so she came and we chilled at my house for a little while and after that we went to go meet up with Amanda and Ali. We were chillen on the benches by Duane Reade then we see Javar. He was on his way somewhere but then he stopped to stay with us. Amanda was hinting to him that she didn't want him there in a really bitchy way but I guess he thought she was kidding because he took a seat and everything. It was really funny, she was about to fucking rip his head open. Jason stopped by to say hi and then Nelly left with him and they were talking a while. We decided to just leave because we assumed they weren't coming back. Ali wanted to go to El Greco and right when we got up Nelly called back to see where we were out. Jason drove us there and we got a table outside. It was really relaxing. Sal came by with like 29388375 of his boys and they wouldn't leave. They're so fucking stupid!! I have NO CLUE how the fuck Galit put up with him for a year and was 'in love' with him, ugh. Yea so we stayed there and I really didn't want to go home but it was getting kinda late so we left. On our way we see Jack, Mitch, Ben and some other guy who turned out to be Jacks cousin. Jack didn't even know it was us he was was gonna 'holla' but then he realized who it was lol. Mitch and Ben left but Jack and the cousin person walked our way. Hess soooo skinnyyyyy. Hes like the fucking size of Nelly, literally. It's a bit disturbing. Yea so Jack looked unbelievably crackedd out. It was such a kodak moment though. If I took a picture of what his face looked like and looked at it when I was sober, I would just think about how I would want to be that fucked up lol. Nellys mom kept calling and bitching so we ended up jogging home halfway. Late night jogs aren't so bad. I just got home like 10 min ago and I have so much energy but nothing to do. I really wanted to sleep over someones house. I sooo don't feel like being home now. [tear]"

Ugh, I got mad because she took an hour away of which I couldve been chilling so I just told her I was coming home at 1:00 and she didnt argue so I was like aight, no doubt. I started to walk towards Amanda and along the way I saw Fish and Stan so I stopped to say hi. They were rolling a 20 and it was really tempting to go chill with them but we had to go meet Ali so we couldn'. While we were waiting for her we saw Andrew and Gumzy so we stayed with them for a little but then they had to leave. Ali ended up not coming so we were just waiting ourselves for some David guy to pick us up. We were bonding for a while and it was really nice. We had to go to Kingshwy benches to meet him so Amanda did her thing and we got a ride. We met up with him there and he was there with like 10 of his guy friends ;]. I challenged 3 of them to slapboxing which is always fun heh. Yea so we basically just chilled there and then my mom kept calling to come home but I wasn't picking up. It was getting close to 1 so I had to go home unfortunately. They all came and waited with me for the cab and this one guy named David[who ironically looks like David] wouldn't hop off and it was really pissing me off. I really didn't wana leave yet but w/e I had to and now i'm home, pretty bored. I guess im going to do some crunches, peace."

I walked to the bus stop and everyone was chillen by Spektors work. The bus finally came after waiting like 20 min. After that I had to wait for the B 82 mad long too. It was really pissing me off, everything was going by in slow motion. I got to Shlemins house and they offered me to smoke. I duno why, but I kinda didn't wana smoke. W/e I ended up smoking anyway. It was a 'One hit wonder', as Alla says and I got pretty fuckin fucked up. I dont remember anything that went on except the part where Galina was looking for her fone all over and it turned out she was holding it and when Paul kept saying that we had to leave. I was really sad when we had to leave because I just got there and like I really didn't wanna walk. When we got outside everyone went their separate ways and Alla didn't have bus money which sucked because we had to walk A LOT. Just in the nick of time Fish pulls up with Stan and tells us to get in. I was so like relieved we didn't have to walk because if we did that would straight up suck. He dropped us off by Seabreeze and we walked to my house. Alla had to wait for her mom to come pick her up and we ate some ice cream while we were waiting. When I got home I passed out and it was such a good nap. It's just what I needed. When I woke up I didnt really feel like going out because the weather was type gay so I chilled at home and shit. I'm glad that I finally got myself to start updating my journal and hopefully i'll keep it up. Aight peace out =)..."

Then I came home dropped off my shit and met up with Nelly. We went to walk around Sheepshead then Amanda called and said shes coming with people in like 5 min. While we were waiting we met the cutest little boy who was like 6 and hes like "" You shouldnt smoke, it's bad"" Then he was saying how hes 12 years old and he was trying to mack it, it was mad funny. W/e so she came and was in a yellow mustang it looked mad hott. Ali was there too so i'm guessing they made up. The driver misters name was Steve and he DID NOT look like someone who'd drive a mustang. More like someone who would ride a bike =x. Heh, so w/e we went to Canarsie to meet up with some other people they knew and we went to eat sushi. We went into one of those back rooms where like you have to take your shoes off and whatnot. It was cool. It kept reminding me of the Simpsons episode where they go to Japan and homer just kept walking through those wall things in Jail and stuff lol. W/e so everyone kept cracking mad jokes around the table it was mad funny and I wasnt even high man. AND OMG! ALI WATCHES MY SO CALLED LIFE! I was like =O! Yea w/e it was fun. After we were driving around and they dropped us off by Nellys house and chilled there for a while, went home."

We went for a walk on the bay and saw Big Mike, gay Arthur, gay Mike and all them. So we walk with all of them to the other side of the bridge where the benches are and there were mad people.

"event","Yesterday chilled around Brighton for a little with Nelly. Then Vicki called to ask if we wanted to go chill so we met up with them. Turns out they know Igor and Marina is going out with the Oleg character. W/e so we were all just chillen on Ocean Pkwy and Igor and Oleg copped some trees. THEY ARE SO FUCKING DUMB HOLY SHIT! They were just sitting on the Ocean Pkwy benches breaking up and rolling. Then they lit that shit there too and started to smoke. To top that off they were giving shotties which didn't make it anymore obvious that they were smoking weed, I swear. They didn't get caught though so yea lol. W/e we were waiting for some Zak kid to come and he said he was a block away like 10 times and we ended up waiting for him like 45 min instead of what should've been like 1. He finally got there and I wanted to laugh so bad. Hes like this little short dinosaur looking guy, whos wearing a bandana and all this bling bling. Haha I couldn't take it he thought he was all macho and thuggish, oyy. I wanted to punch him so bad though. Hes such a loh, like a straight up loh. Like okay, Marina needed to go the movie theater to pick up a ticket really quick, so she asked Zak to drive her. And hes standing there like a fucking dick with his head tilted thinking and thinking. Then hes like i'll drive you if you pay me 10 dollars. Everyone else is sitting on the bench looking at this conversation going =0 , thinking what a dick he is. So Marinas BF was bitching at him going ""its a 10 min. ride you have to fucking charge a girl bro?"" Then Zak was saying how hes not car service. So Marina was like w/e fuck it and she called up Car Service. When the car service finally got there he decided that he would take her for money. Then like two seconds later he was feening to a stoge so he drives to a loosie spot to get a stoge, meanwhile he had to charge Marina for the movies. What a prick. Yes, he's not car service..but it's not that fucking serious. He had nothing better to do anyway. Moving right along, when Marina and Vicki got back they told us to come to LP to chill. Then we asked Zak to drive us because we were already in the car anyway cuz of the rain. Then hes sitting there thinking if hes going to take a 2 minute drive from duane reade to LP. AHHH I WANTED TO PUNCH HIM SO BAD! W/e so he decided to drive us the whole two minutes and he was like "" See girls, i'm a nice guy"" Then I was like "" Oh yes very, are you charging us for this ride too?"" Ugh, hes so gay and thinks hes such hot shit. W/e so we went to LP and we were chillin. I saw Dannie and Michelle from 303, they look exactly the same lol. They started to make fun of Nelly calling her red lobster because she was wearing mad red and she was really sun burned. W/e so we were all chilling cracking jokes. Didn't really do much cuz of the beat weather. Most of the time everyone was just making fun of Zak."

"event","Today was aight. I actually woke up early to go to the beach but it was really bleh outside so I ended up going back to sleep. I woke up pretty late and then tried to get myself to go to Ballys once again but no luck =\. I called up Nelly in the afternoon but it turned out she couldn't chill today because she was going to that sweet 16. Whatever, so then Amanda called to chill but she said she had to do some family shit first and she can come chill later. I didn't feel like waiting so I just called up Galit and we met up. It's good I called her up because shes leaving back to Isreal really soon. We were just chillen on Ocean pkwy for a little and there wasn't really anything to do so we went to the boardwalk. I was hoping to see Spektor, Toliy and all them and it turned out we were in luck =]. We found Spektor, Toliy, Paul and Peter. All of us went to chill by the ' Tree house' thingamabob  on the beach by Wintergarden. Muffin, Felix and Oleg came after a little along with some Lena chick. Shes pretty cool. She was wearing these like 3"" heels on the beach though, which I found pretty retarded, w/e. Amanda came and we were all just chillen. Toliy was reallllly drunk. This kid COULD NOT control himself lol, he really needed to lay down or something. Ehh, after that a few people left to go fishing or what not so the rest of us went to the grocery to get some stoges and beer. Galit didn't want to go back to chill with them though so w/e her Amanda and I left. We were walking around Brighton finding a place for Galit to pee but it was like 11 already and most of the places were closed. We went to Dunkin Donuts and it was mad funny they wouldnt let her use the bathroom because it was only for employees and Galit was bitching saying "" I have lady issues sir, I have to use a bathroom asap... you dont understand!"" haha W/e they were being dicks so we went to Cafe Art and they let her use it. There was this one worker dude there and he was really drunk/scary. Bla bla bla  we go back to the boardwalk and walk around. Spektor kept calling for us to come back but for some reason Galit really didn't wana go so we didn't go back. W/e nothing else really happened. Can't wait till tomorrow. Hopefully everything will go as planned. My birthday is on Monday, WOOHOO!"

"event","On Tuesday I did a whole lot of nothing during the day. Nelly called me after work and she wanted me to come with her and her mother to Loehmanns. On the way there we saw Paul, Muffin and Sam. I duno, it was kinda akward. W/e so we get there and I ended up finding a lot of shit for myself that i ended up putting on hold. After Loehmanns Nellys mom dropped us off on Brighton and we met Amanda. After about a half hour, Fish came and we were chillen on the boardwalk. We met up with some Mikey friend of his who was Italian =) lol. He had maddd funny looking ears. Moving right along, we went to go Floyd Bennet Field [however you spell it] and they started to roll a blunt =D. It was a mad chill spot to smoke. Amanda didn't want to smoke the blunt so she just stood there like a dick smoking a philly haha. Thats such a disgusting, cheap tasting cigar, ugh lol. Aight, so the blunt was rolled and we got in the car to hot box it. It was mad funny, all you see is smoke everywhere and I was like to Nelly "" Yoo, it feels like we're on a cloud."" So shes like "" Yea man, cloud 9!"" Haha, that was like the best thing said. Oh yea, and the blunt lasted for madd long. It must have cyphered like 6 times or some shit. No doubt ;] After the blunt, we got out of the car and went by some mini beach. It was soooo scary. I was bugging out the whole time. A. there were some little bugs like all over jumping around B. The sound of the ocean was freaky C. The sound of the boats was uber duper freaky. Then Fish had a spotlight and put everyone 'on the spot' Like when I was going down some stairs to get on the beach I had a reallly hard time, considering I was fucked up off my ass and he was just shining it on me saying "" Hahaaa you're on the spot. Everyones looking at you not being able to go down the steps. Look at you! You're so fucked up!"" And I kept cracking up and I stood there for like an hour because I was still laughing. When I was finally done I got down. All the sand got in my shoe and it felt really icky, yet cool. My mom kept calling and it was pissing me off. On the ride home, it was awesome. I was having one of those 'high thinking moments' It was great lol. The window was open and we were on the highway really fast and there were these little speed bumps and I felt like I was on the ride of my life. Like it was just another bump in the road. I don't know if I'm making any sense but it sounded so right when I was stoned lol. W/e so he drove us back to Brighton and Nelly, Amanda and I all go to chill by my house. i tell everyone to be uber duber quiet because my window was right there and my parents could hear everything. I was still really fucked up at this point and my eyes were beattt red. Anyway so we're all chillin and then a group of like twenty something year old guys are passing, right across the street. One of them keeps waving to me but I just ignore him. They go into the parking lot, get in a car, then they drive up by us. The guy who waved goes "" Hey, you in the white, can't say hi anymore?"" I just stand there with a blank look on my face. So then he goes"" What you dont remember me? Omg, are you high? You look madddd high."" I was about to piss in my pants. He was talking really loud and I was just hoping my parents DID NOT HEAR ANY OF THAT! Especially the parts about me looking high. I was really high and that made my paranoia sky rocket. What perfect timing that happend.=\ I got home and my parents didn't say anything..but that doesn't mean they didn't hear it all. W/e it's all good lol. Keep it real"

Then the whole time I was just wondering what it would be like to be high with them right now. I can picture my dad being all like cool about it and laughing about stupid shit along with everyone else. As for my mom, I think she would be madd paranoid and think she's going to die or some shit. W/e it was mad funny they were so amazed they make a movie about weed. She was like ""How can they put this on tv where kids can see?"" Im like "" Mama, how can they put cocaine movies on tv where kids can see?"" Ugh, shes so dumb. Aight I'm out. Keep it real."

If any of you lovelies are inspired to join me, I'd enjoy your company.
Dancing is always more fun when friends come along!

$10 cover, the band starts around 9:40PM and the dancing goes until after midnight.  I'll plan to go for the band but won't be closing the joint down at the end of the night.  Only a week or so and I'm back to classes five mornings a week!

After they arrive in NY around September 7th, the boats will be docked in NY and on display for about a month in conjunction with an exhibit at the Deitch Gallery.

I'm excited to be part of the Wilhelmina crew, the recent KSW labor of love.
I'm looking forward to learning more about running the steam engine, and making myself useful.

"event","I know this is Pride weekend and there are lots of other festivities going on.  If you don't already have plans on Sunday, come see the steamboat before it leaves for New York!
______________

Many of you know that we've been busy the last many months, restoring an old steam paddlewheel boat for a big art project coming up in August - no, NOT Burning Man. 
KSW will be a part of a larger project dreamed up by the artist Swoon.  Starting August 15th in Troy, NY, we and 6 other vessels, covered in Swoon's art, will begin a 170 mile adventure down the Hudson River.  Our journey will take us around the tip of Manhattan and into Queens, where we will be landing at the Deitch Gallery, on September 7th, opening night of an even larger exhibit by the artist.

In just over two weeks, our steamboat will be loaded on a flat bed truck and sent East so that the artist has time to adorn our blank canvas of a vessel.

We would like to invite you all to come and see what we've been working on before we ship her off.  Perhaps we will still be working like mad as we prepare to put her in the water on the 30th.  The party will be from 12pm-5pm on Sunday, June 29th and is located at our workshop at the NIMBY warehouse at 1649 28th Street in West Oakland.  We'll be serving steam powered margaritas and have some of our other steam equipment up and running on display.  The Space Cowboys' Unimog will be there playing happy, non-electronic daytime music (your guess is as good as mine). 

Feel free to bring a bottle of champagne to smash on the bow.

I plan to attend the 8pm lesson, stay for the 9pm lesson, and dance until my feet are tired and my shoulders tell me to go home.

Whether or not you've done any partner dancing before, Blues dancing has easy footwork and very little structure.  Most of the challenge comes from the improv nature of the lead and follow which can be quite playful.

You don't need to bring a partner - people are very friendly and ask other people to dance.  Dress is casual.
Blues is often danced in an embrace that is very close.  If you're put off by dancing in a close embrace, I can give you some tips for dance etiquette and how to use your frame to maintain a certain distance."

"event","Tonight I finally got to see the steamboat, in its not so glorious state.
It looks like this project is *full steam ahead*, and while it's simultaneously horrible, delightful, punk rock, and KSW sexy, chances are good I'll be one of the crew for the Hudson River project.

What am I babbling on about?  <a href=""http://www.kineticsteamworks.org/"">Kinetic Steam Works</a> is the group with the 1920 traction steam engine art car (using *real* steam power) at Burning Man the last two years.  They've gotten a lot of attention for their collaborations with other local artists, such as the insect <a href=""http://kineticsteamworks.org/page1/page2/page2.html"">Carousel</a> in 2006, and the <a href=""http://steamtreehouse.com/page28/page28.html"">Steam Punk Victorian Treehouse</a> in 2007.
KSW has been invited to join a group of <a href=""http://www.missrockaway.org/"">artists and performers</a> who will take a flotilla of several rafts down the Hudson River from Troy to NYC for three weeks this August.  KSW has been given a <a href=""http://hudsonriverproject.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/boat-1-tatlin/"">steam boat</a> that we are working on restoring (built in the 1960's, so it's not as glorious as you think).  It will will be shipped cross-country mid-June, and once in NY will be part of an installation art piece, and the rafts will travel down the river by day with crew and performers, docking every night for performances in towns along the way.  They will arrive in NYC on Labor Day weekend, and be part of an exhibit for a few weeks after that.
This event has already happened two previous years on the Mississippi River, which brings to mind all sorts of Huck Finn adventures, but this will not be as romantic as that.  Mosquito netting better be part of the budget!  Apparently they've done major clean-up of the Hudson in the past 10 years, but swimming in it might still be a bad idea.

In the meantime, I'm enjoying being a grease monkey again.  It's been a while since I've gotten my hands dirty.  I mean *really* dirty."

I'm sleep deprived, delirious, and still a little under the weather.
My mind is swimming with images of the wonderful people I met, their amazing costumes and the gorgeous places we went.  I've lost track of the beautiful Venetian palazzos we partied in that overlooked either the Grand Canal or the Lagoon.

I'll try to post pictures and more stories soon, but a few tidbits in the meantime:

1. I performed my first solo burlesque striptease for an attentive audience of about 100 people
2. I received a marriage proposal for a white-wedding from a wealthy Italian Count who has close ties to the Vatican (!)
3. Sorrel and M. are *adorable* together
4. I got really sick with an upset stomach at a 5-course dinner in a palace on Saturday night, and a very sweet neighbor I had just met named Rosie let me rest in her house until I could bear to make it back across town when my friends were ready to leave.  She lent me a pair of her pajamas, tucked me in a bed with a hot water bottle and aspirin.  All-in-all there were many gracious friends and strangers who helped me on this trip.  Like the handsome Roman gentleman who loaned me his cloak to get home that night...
5. I'm still finding Dalmatian-spots from the Cruella party on Monday night, the most notable from a bite on my arm that is now a bruise the size of a fist.  (Have I mentioned I bruise easily?  At least they aren't marks on my neck - I hate that!)
6. Next year I need to balance out the 18 C. costumes with some that don't need panniers, corsets or big heavy wigs.  Including at least one man's costume... something easy to pull on earlier in the day.

I feel like I discovered another home and family I didn't realize was missing from my life.
Next time I don't want to be sick for so long though, okay?"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Rant""> Heh, so our company had Cable and DSL from a prominent service provider in a location we will no longer use after the end of this month.
Apparently the account was set up under the personal name of our facilities manager, which might explain some of the story below.

I just answered a call from someone wanting to confirm details of the cancellation, which started off on the wrong note because she asked if I were Mrs. Larez.  Hilarity ensued when I tried to explain we were actually a company, and that I could answer her question myself.  She needed to know what services we had in order to process the cancellation correctly.

When you pay for a monthly service, and need to cancel it because you are moving, wouldn't you expect that service provider to have their own records of what you pay them for listed with your account information?
I offered our account # to refer to, and she said she had no idea what that number meant.  I pulled up a bill with the check stub, and read to her from the bill we have paid on time every month to tell her what services we have been paying for.  She seemed to be able to interpret from that what she needed to know, but wasn't nearly as amused as I was.

Then she went back to my having mentioned that we are a business.  She said, ""Are you *sure* you're a business?""  I said ""Yes, I'm sure we're a business.""
She was appalled, and said ""We usually don't call businesses this time of night.  I need to know if you are a business in order to process this cancellation correctly.""  When I asked how that mattered when we were canceling the service, all she could do was repeat herself like a broken record.
What impressive customer service!


And speaking of excellent customer service: last week a prominent shipping company somehow managed to update contact information for our company account, including changing the authorized contact and the contact phone number for our account when an employee called to verify tracking info for their personal cell phone which they were having delivered to the company address.

I can understand linking account information by address or by a phone number, but shouldn't it be a very basic concept that more than one entity might have a package delivered to the same address?  Or that a person might happen to call from a phone that is associated with an account other than what the person is calling about?  And shouldn't a world-wide shipping company actually ask before overwriting contact information for an account?
*sheesh!*"

After spending Christmas at my sister's in Petaluma, I spent an extra day with Videtur in our hometown.
On our way back to SF yesterday we stopped at a coffee shop a co-worker had been raving about, but surely I didn't really need another 4 shots of espresso in the afternoon... I was still up reading at 4:30 this morning when I remembered I had rehearsal at noon and desperately needed sleep before then.

It's been lovely having Videtur in town.  It'd be even better to have her here for a few months next year.
Last night we had a delicious dinner at Le Colonial, and danced up a storm before running over to Top of the Mark to catch Stompy Jones and meet up with Simulacrum and her honey.  I had a fantastic dance with a Lindy Hoppin' gent who had great moves, and a few Blues dances that would make a grandmother blush.
Dancing takes my aches away and leaves a smile in their place.

I bought my ticket to Venice!  I'll be gone Jan. 28th - Feb. 8th.  I decided to spend a day in Amsterdam on my way home, though I'm certain I'll be delirious after the week at Carnivale.  It seemed a shame to be in the airport there and not visit my friends.
What should I do with one night in Amsterdam?

My costume preparation continues, but slowly...
I feel like I'm designing an entire play that opens next month but the only character is myself.
Speaking of, I should really get some sewing done.  Does anyone have sources for amazing feathers?  I want a few handfuls of orange and red ostrich plumes, among others I don't know the names for."

Seriously, I'm swooning, almost punch drunk, and I feel like my heart is open wider than my arms could reach to demonstrate.

Tonight I went to Tangoed Up in Blues, the monthly Blues/Tango event I've been trying to go to since I first heard about it maybe 7 months ago.  I managed to have other plans or be out of town the last several months, so this was my first opportunity with nothing else to trump it.

Tangoed Up in Blues is actually a weekend full of workshops and dancing, but I went to just one of the classes, Tango for Blues Dancers.  It was a two hours class, and I think it was the best dance class I've *ever* taken.  Granted, I have a lot of experience that has built the foundation for what I learned tonight.

I learned how to dance tango tonight!  It's only the key to open the door to tango in the large picture, but I learned where the lead and follow is.  I've never understood the lead and follow in tango before- where does the lead end and the improv begin?  What is the rhythm, where and when do you step?  What the class covered was an epiphany to me, and I not only have several steps down but I could follow steps I had never done before.  I have a new dance language!

Once again, I am incredibly impressed with the Blues community, and the safe place they create for dancers.  I spoke up, asked questions and made comments, which I often shy away from in new places.
I danced with a few leads who I've met and danced with before, and several new ones.  The great thing about learning with people is how much support you are able to offer one another.  The honesty and intimacy I had with the leads I danced with tonight was tremendous.  Sure, I'm enthusiastic tonight because I was successful with my attempt at a new thing, but I feel very centered and inspired.  Dancing satisfies me in ways nothing else does.
I love the challenge of following, of being submissive yet being so engaged - having to pay such extreme attention to the lead.  My mind stops its normal ramblings and there is nothing else in the world but that moment.  The element of following where you agree to do what the lead has invited you to do is delicious, a deep intimacy that you share for a dance, which makes it a private collaboration and a playful one at that.

I'm super excited and want to find more Tango classes.  Oh, and the time to take them.  :"

-Brian Andreas

I almost forgot tomorrow is May Day.  It has been years since I greeted the sun on May Day, but I like doing crazy things at odd hours, so tomorrow I will be dancing the sun up while you are sleeping soundly in your beds.
The tradition goes that without us dancing the sun up, the sun would not rise and the world would end.  Tomorrow I will help save the world, one step at a time.  Before breakfast even!

Now to dig for my hankies and bells...  Yes, but you already knew I was a dance nerd, didn't you?
Hee, <a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eve/310304709.html"">this</a> is funny.  A paid May Day gig?"

I miss it.  I haven't been there in five years.

I can't believe the endless list of instructors this year - including Tango!  *SIGH*

Hmm, how come they have two tango teachers when they won't let M. bring me as the her teaching partner for Swing/Lindy Hop?  I want to teach at Lark for full trade!  It's hard to teach a partner dance without two people to demonstrate the lead/follow, especially a large class.

Speaking of, M. is working on her thesis this semester, so we won't be teaching a weekly class at this time.  I'm still up for going dancing, and teaching on an individual level."

I plan to go either at 9PM for the lesson, or after the lesson ends at 10PM or so...
I can be influenced in either direction depending on who wants to go."

While she was in Washington state she campaigned to save old growth forests.  She is a fabulous individual, and is mother to Kalliope.
I first met Briana over 8 years ago, and consider her to be part of my family.

She is asking for contributions big or small to help cover the cost of travel expenses for and during the trial in Tacoma, WA, and to help cover her time off of work.  She expects she may have to be there two weeks..."

If anyone knows of a studio or place Malaika and I can teach Swing and Lindy on Tuesday nights (from 7PM-8:30 or so) for not too much money, we'll begin a weekly class March 13th.  Near public transportation/reasonable parking, room for maybe 40-60 people would be best.  Let me know if you have leads..."

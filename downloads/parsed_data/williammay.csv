"event","The chronicler sighed and pushed his chair back, wincing as he streched after far too long hunched before the computer.  Walking to the window of his apartment, his fingers trailed over the pile of letters, most unopened, that had been piling up on the edge of his desk for months:  increasingly hysterical unpaid bills, the notice from the university informing him of his expulsion, the letters warning of his impending eviction.  With a convulsive motion, he sent them tumbling to the floor.  It didn't matter, now.

He stood staring out over the lights of Brooklyn and thought about William May, the man whose story had consumed his life.  He'd stopped going to work, to school, spending every waking moment restoring and deciphering the cracked, charred and stained pages that sat by his computer.  Towards the end there, he'd even stopped adding his arch pseudo-academic editorial comments - what was the point, when he was more and more convinced of the truth of it?  He glanced over at the thick file folder of research he'd done - information on the Ancient Order of the Hibernians, accounts of the Battle of the Five Points, a newspaper article on the '49 dock riots...no solid evidence, of course.  You could perhaps see hints of something more if you read between the lines, but still.  Nothing to prove there was ever such a man as William May, his brother and sisters, his wife...

Did they ever manage to get married?  I wonder, he thought.

He walked back to the desk, picking up a battered satchel on the way and slipping May's journal inside.  Plenty of room - he wasn't bringing much with him.  A bus ticket to Sacramento.  A wad of twenties that represented the last of his wealth.  Paper.  Pen.  Not a lot to find a legend - but then again, he didn't suppose much would be necessary.

The chronicler walked away from the desk, from his apartment, from his train wreck of a life, pausing only to pin a note to his door:

""Gone to join the Fianna.  Don't wait up.""

"event","<i>They dream that night, the lost, the orphaned, the frightened - all those awakening to the knowledge that they wield a gift that sets them apart from humanity with none to guide them, all round the world.  They dream of the battle of New York, and share in its glories and agonies - cold fear at seeing the Mays face a force over ten times their size; raw, feral joy at seeing dragons of legend flying above the fray, fell and glorious; rage and grief at seeing Kinsmen and Fianna alike cut down by a cowardly round of cannon fire.  They dream of the silent circle of family, friends and followers that stand over the fallen body of William May, and they hear a voice in their ear, softly speaking.

""We are hard to kill,"" it says, and the dreamers understand, in the way only dreamers can, that they are included in that 'we'.  ""But it can be done.""

In that moment Will's eyes blink, he breathes in, he stands, and the dreamers can feel the joy rolling from the reunified family.  William embraces his loved ones, then walks apart from them.  The battleground falls away, the sun winks out, and there is only green fields under a star-strewn sky, stretching forever in all directions.

""I was lucky,"" says Will, walking beside.  ""I was surrounded by allies at the height of their power, who loved me so that they'd pay any price to bring me back.""

They are silent then, for a time, watching the moon rise above the horizon, full and shining silver.

""We are not like others,"" William says at length.  ""What we believe shapes the world, and in turn shapes us.  For this reason, it's rare that we may travel together - what any two people believe, if they are true to themselves and make up their own minds, is rarely the same.  But on those rare moments that we come together in force, when we bend our wills to one end together, well...""  

He reaches out then, towards the horizon, and plucks the moon from the sky, cradling it in his palm.  ""You'd be surprised what we can accomplish,"" Will says, his lips curving upwards in a small smile.  ""I can't offer you all the answers.  I will not tell you what to believe.  What I can tell you is this:  you are not alone.  You have been chosen, as I have, as have those before us.  And if you wish aid, if you wish what guidance there is to be had, if you wish to meet with those like yourself, I'll be waiting.""

William opens his fingers, and the glowing orb in his hand drifts upwards, suddenly ablaze with silver light, too bright to look at directly, and the dreamers can feel a twin fire in their own hearts, burning as if in answer to the brand shining above May.  And for an instant, just before the light winks out, the dreamers see each other, souls shining with the gift and curse that is their birthright, standing in a western plain beneath an endless starry sky.

In the darkness that follows, just before the dreamers wake, they hear his voice again.  ""What you feel is real.  You are not imagining it, it is not coincidence, you are not going mad.  My name is William May.  If you need to find me, all you must do is believe that you will."" 

They awaken then, their breathing quick, and they can feel it still, just for a moment - the power, the spark of divinity.  And whether they turn away from the gift or embrace it, whether they seek out William May or forge their own path, they have this, that for one bright moment they knew in their heart of hearts that magic is alive in the world.</i>"

"event","It is done.  For now, anyway.  We've a moment to breathe, and then to California and the General.

I'm so weary.

I don't think it felt this way, for Moira.  There, in the Land of Youth, coming back is natural.  Here...I can't imagine the cost.  I feel it, somehow, but the enormity of what's been done - I don't understand it, not yet.  But I will.  We all of us will, in time.  

Sometimes, back on the farm, I would awaken in the middle of the night - not from Rabbit's night terrors, just awaken, thinking it was time to get up and work.  And then I would open my eyes and look about me, and see nothing but the darkness, and feel nothing but warmth and safety, and know that there was no reason to stir myself, or think, or do anything but slide deeper into that little haven in the heart of night.  Being dead was like that.  No green fields of Tir Na Nog, no St. Peter, no ferryman, just rest, just ceasing of worry.  I was there for an eternity and for no time at all before Siobhan and Moira pulled me out.  

I'm grateful; I am.  She...I'm not surprised Moira came for me.  But Siobhan - ye gods and little fishes, what it must have cost her.  I forget, sometimes, that my way is not the only way.  It shames me to admit it, but until that moment I never thought Siobhan cared for me like I - we - care for her.  She just never saw the need to make a fuss over it as I seem to.  Eileen, too.  Those two, and their secrets.  I wonder exactly how much they've suffered over the years for the family, for me even, in silence.  Never had to be so.  But I ought not to look down upon their travails for all that.

I'm...not whole.  I don't know myself, just now.  I...

My men, they...did me proud.  Fianna now, I suppose - we'll be having to get them tattoos, though I doubt they'll all bear it as stoically as Jenny.  Bless her.  Ten to one, it was, and she alone never wavered for an instant.  My men, my Fianna, they believe, but Jenny thinks I'm the second coming.  Ought to feel bad about that, I suppose.  Then again, gives me something to try to live up to, aye?

Moira.  She was so angry with me for up and dying on her.  I remember feeling sorry for her, for having to be angry.  She didn't understand, was all.  I'm lucky to have such a woman with me.  We'll see if she stays after what she's seen in my heart.  Likes her ethics, she does, and there's parts of me all angles and sharp edges that can kill and kill and kill again until I wade in blood, and truth be known it troubles me less than ever.  I do believe we're both sadder and wiser for the experience.

Full circle, then, Will.  What's next?  After the General, after the war to come, what then?  I've still questions unanswered.  Is there anything greater than our kind, beyond us?  Did God create us, or we Him?  Where does the gift come from, and why were we chosen for it?  Can the essence of magic truly be changed?

Why is it all this way?  Why isn't everything different?

What's Declan really playing at?

What are the secret names of the stars?

Well, there's time for all that.  I've a long road ahead of me, longer still as it seems I'm not permitted to lay down the weary load and die.  We'll go west, we'll go to the soft places where new legends might still be forged, and then...

The magic must be known.  Understood.  By those who wield it and by the rest of humanity.  I will find them, one by one, those poor souls with the magics woven into their spirits, and I will teach them what they need to know, prod them into discovering what they are for themselves.  I will not hide the truth from them as so many have kept it from me.  And when we are strong enough we shall bring the magic back to the whole wide world, remind the mortals why the tides flow and the sun rises in the morn.  And like Prometheus, I will bring the fire to mankind.

Perhaps then, when the work is done, I can go home.  But for now, well...let's go see something new."

"event","I look over these pages, now, and I see so much more than I did then.  Of what's been happening, in us and in the wide world, but most so in the architecture of my own soul.  Fear.  Doubt.  And the lingering knowledge, half-realized in my own dreams, that using the gift starts you on a road there's no turning away from once you've followed it far enough.

I've been there, now; I've seen it.  The heart of it, the very seat of our power.  The Otherworld, Faerie, Tir Na Nog - many names, one land.  Or perhaps many lands, all in one, a mythic geography I can't wrap my head about.  I thought I'd get on better there than I did, but the first thing I did violated all I've ever been taught of the place.  Then again, I never did pay enough attention to the faerie stories...I liked the ones about the men and women, the heroes and warrior queens.  I now owe a favour, and to one more powerful and fickle than those Eileen deals with.  But it was Moira.  I won't lose her, I will not.  There is a sum total of six people in all of Heaven, Earth and elsewhere that I am not prepared to sacrifice, and she stands among that number.  

It all resonates, somehow.  The stories.  Who we have chosen to be.  Heroes may be strong, and they may even be wise, but they are not noted for making the best decisions.  It's our failures, and how we rise above them, that define us - Cuchulainn would never have been named so had he not shirked his duties and killed Culan's hound.  The best known tales of Finn are his failures, his loss of Oisin and the murder of Diarmiad.  And would we have reached the court of the Unseelie, deep in the heart of the Land of Air and Darkness, had I not bargained with the Morrigan for Moira's life?  No earthly way of knowing, of course, but I've the feeling if I'd listened to Rabbit and obeyed the rules we'd still be there, staring at trees and listening to our rumbling bellies.

But I did, and we did, and then we found our way to the heart of it all.  And were offered the choice:  accept the gift of magics in all our hearts and join the battle against those that would see it die, or turn away and be forever mortal.  

Now, I've never had what you'd be calling a good poker face.  What I feel may as well be writ on my forehead, and so I'm sure they all knew I hesitated to make up my mind.  I'd not like for them to know just how close I was to turning away.  What good has the gift ever done us?  Aye, we've used it to get out of some scrapes - not many that magic's not gotten us into in the first place, mind.  I'm half ashamed that it took me so long to throw my lot in, and half disgusted it didn't take them longer.  Are their memories so short?  Do they not ever wonder what may have been if not for the constant meddling in our lives it's caused?  Eileen seems barely alive sometimes, Siobhan was violated in a way I'd never even have conceived possible, I've nearly died more times than I care to think about thank you kindly, Diego spent years enslaved to a madwoman...to say nothing of the lives we've destroyed in our passing.  In the instant I made the choice, I think I understood the General.  There but for the grace of God go I.

That doesn't matter now, of course.  I've chosen.  The magic is not and never will be worth the price we pay for it.  So be it.  Still better than the other choice, it is.  May not be pleasant, aye, but I'll take it over a world without magic in, where there's nothing but humanity and mathematics, and then darkness, forever.  Meant what I said to Siobhan, too.  It's a rubbish, toss-pot world, this, and most people in it are feckin' idiots - and so humanity will always have more nightmares than dreams.  There's always been more boggarts than brownies, more sinners than saints, more woe than weal.  We are the purest expression of mankind's delights and fears - it follows that we'll wound more often than heal.  We'll not know peace, nor will those mortals that get caught in our wake.

But still.  But yet.  Something Taliesin said, there in the heart - that the General could win, that the magic could be destroyed.  Well then, if a thing can die then it can change, aye?  What if it could be made other than it is?  What if it could be made into a true gift rather than the curse it is, what if we could induce mankind to seize its power for their own?  Higher mysteries, these - but sure, I've got nothing but time to think on them.  I'll be living a good long time, I will, barring a properly mythic death.  

One last thing, though.  Declan.  I think I'm coming to understand the man, much as it galls me to the core to admit it.  This evening, as I stood basking in the belief of my men, I felt little Jenny's adoration for me...and then I saw her.  Truly saw her, felt and followed the warp and weft of her life's thread, and I had a vision of her...strong and beautiful she'll grow up, and then, when she's just full grown into womanhood, she'll die.  For me.  Having never truly lived for anything but me.  Of her own will.  I've no choice, save this - send her away and take from her the desire of her heart, or give her the life she wants, knowing it'll end her.  Declan's been doing this for a time.  I wonder, how many have thrown away their lives for him, whether he wills it or no?  What does that do to a man, centuries on?  I suppose I'll be finding out.  Have to believe I'll be keeping my sense of humor better'n that git, though.

The thing is this:  we have all submitted to the idea that there is something greater than our own lives, that we are willing to sacrifice ourselves to - lives, minds, souls, all.  If I'm to respect that in myself and in my family, I've no choice but to respect it in Jenny.  But every instant of every day before the price comes due, I'll remember what I owe her and all that come after, and I will make their sacrifices worth it.

That's for the future, though - there's work to be done in the here and now.  I've spent the evening gathering my Fianna, and I felt, somehow, that my sisters were doing the same - gathering faith, wrapping it about ourselves like a cloak...or a shield.  Jones will not prove much of an obstacle now, I think."

Ended up in the Bronx few nights past.  I was right, there's another gang war brewing - the Italians, this time.  Tried to warn Henry; he doesn't seem overly worried.  Last I heard, we were meant to avoid such things as we'll get the army called down on our heads.  As usual, no one listens to Will May.  I confess, I'm startin' to have second thoughts about the Hibernians.  It was the best place to be for the battle with the Natives, but now that the Irish nation is here to stay, well...it's hard to rouse the same passion in my heart trading blows with a crew of pasta eating thugs as I had once before.  I fear the Hibernians have stopped looking out for the Irish and started looking out for the Hibernians.  Ah, now I'm just being a wee bit sour.  And why not?  Had a hell of a time, I have.

Started off so well, too.  Numbers were more or less even.  They had pistols, but that's not been a problem for some small while now.  Then halfway through the ruckus...things changed.  Completely.  The power deserted me; felt like there were lead weights on my legs and cotton in my head.  The men ran - can't fault 'em for that, they've seen me get out of worse scrapes, seen how fast I can move when the spirit takes me.  Worse than movin' slow was the feeling of being diminished, trapped...mortal.  I'd near forgotten.  Been so long since I felt anything approaching real fear - there were bullets flying all about my head, screaming, chaos, and I wasn't in control of it any longer.

Managed to keep me head about me - just barely.  Funny thing, that.  I'm always stumbling along behind Siobhan and Eileen when it comes to using the gift...don't like using it if I don't have to, and I don't go looking for reasons to have to.  But I have become a fairly capable man in a fight, power or no.  So I flung a well aimed dagger or two and managed, through luck more'n anything else I'm sure, to escape with my life.  Once on the streets, though, that's when they came.  Browncoats, two of 'em, and not in a mood to talk.  Beat me within inches of my bleedin' life and left me for dead.  Siobhan's patched me up, now, but my grin's got a few new gaps in.

I'd entertained hopes it'd not come to this.  Not sure why - tired of running from one battle to the next, maybe, or hesitant to lose what we've gained so far.  But the gauntlet has been cast.  We're to stop using our ""blasphemous gifts"" or face more serious consequences - so says Colonel Jones and his gobshite Kinsman's Army.  I've a thought or two on how to kill them without using the gift, but it'll be tricky, and far from safe.  It's my hope Henry can give me a few more men for the attack, but after our last meeting I'll think myself lucky to keep those I have.  Didn't come out and tell him the truth, not entire, but I didn't hide either.  Just tired of the skulduggery, is all, tired of all the ridiculous lies, evasions, excuses - how in pity's sake are we to make people believe in us if we scurry about like rats, pretending we're perfectly ordinary?

Ordinary.  All I ever wanted to be was Will May.  Rich, maybe, famous certainly, but never other than my own self for all that.  That's not all there is to me, not any more.  Well.  This is only another challenge.  One that I will solve, and the cost be damned."

I've seen one of 'em, my phantom watchers.  I was in Manhattan and overheard one of the fattened, greasy businessmen that gather there go off on a tear about the Irish, we're stealin' their hard won work and women, and so on.  I arranged matters so as in a few steps he slipped on a patch of ice, snapping his neck like a twig.  And I felt it again, that itch.  I spun about and across the square was a man staring at me.

I might of tried talking him out of doin' anything stupid had we been alone, but the stupid git had to go and challenge me in front of others.  So I responded to his concerns with a fist in the gob.  Had to cheat a fair amount - the man's got arms on him like lamp-posts, and if he'd laid hands on me I'd be writing this from a hospital bed, if at all.  So I stretched myself a bit and had him laid out fairly quick.  Worked in my favour, I think - good for the men to see their leader knock a man three times his size on his arse.  When he came round I informed him that it made me sick to have to raise a hand against my fellow Irishmen - much rather use 'em against our enemies - but if he was foolish enough to keep challenging my authority he'd find himself with a knife in his belly for his troubles.

Had to leave him behind on tonight's job, though no great loss - tonight called for stealth, not brawn.  Banker down on 23rd street kept finding reasons to foreclose on Irish properties - can't allow that, not after so many of us lost homes during the Famine.  Took a great deal of pleasure in giving him the warning myself.  A dagger laid on his pillow as he slept, atop a list of addresses where he goes to enjoy the company of young men for a few dollars an hour.  If I'd my way I'd just kill him - no sense humiliating him like that, to my way of thinking, but things are different now.  There's talk of bringing the army to bear against us if we get too big for our britches - best to work with guile and treachery rather than blade and boot.  

Young Jenny isn't learning her lessons as well as I'd like, and her Gaelic is atrocious.  She'll grow up to be a hell of a fighter, though.  Spendin' time with her makes me miss my family somethin' awful, but at least I'm helping someone."

She's tryin' her best not to kill me with her cooking, but she's been eating that firey fare so long...what's insufferably bland to her feels like a mouthful of molten steel to me.  I s'pose I'll just have to get used to it.  We're taking turns cooking now, and I've fed her a few old Irish dishes, but I can tell she tires of 'em quickly.  Can't blame her, really.  The Irish people are wild and free and unpredictable in life, love and war, but not in the kitchen.

Eileen's just been.  Much as I hate to admit it, I can't deny that the changes I've seen in her are for the better.  Looks happier than I've seen her for years, and she's not lost her wicked, playful grin.  I'd worried that she'd become more and more the woman I see after she goes too far into the dark, silent, dead-eyed.  I just...no.  Can't keep fearing the worst.  Brings out the meddler in me.

Siobhan seems much the same as ever.  Too much so.  As though through force of will she could make it like nothin's wrong, like she hasn't cut her family out of her life almost entirely.  Not as though I can talk to her about it, every time I almost say something I get that chilly stare of hers.

I like the summers for the long heat-dream and lazy pleasure of the days, aye, but for preference give me a long winter night, crisp, clean - a man can think then, and the stars at look so close you feel you can just reach up and take them in hand.

I've risen in the Order.  They've given me command of six stout lads, though I think I'll likely have to step careful for a time - I've not seen any other of my rank that doesn't have ten years on me, and the looks on their faces ran the gamut from worship to out and out mutiny.  Amos McGarrigle, Padraic Whelan, Steven Murphy, Gabriel Campbell, Colin McCaffrey and Dermot Kennedy.  Campbell bein' the one to watch - a stunning bit of news, that, I'm sure.  Sayin' a Campbell might not be entirely trustworthy is like sayin' a May might not be quite right in the head.  He's huge and more clever than he lets on, which is not a combination I'd like to have leveled against me.  Ah, he'll fall in line sooner or later - in one way or another.

As far as I know, Eileen and Siobhan haven't spoken a word since the Battle of the Five Points.  Gives me a sick, cold feeling in my gut, that, but some part of me keeps whispering that may be that's for the best.  I hate that part of me.  I wish I could cut it out of me and cleanse the wound with fire.  But like it or no, at least they've stopped battering their wills against each other.  They've made their choices, as I've made mine.  I'll not be their go-between any longer.  As much as I want to scream at them, as much as I know in my heart of hearts that they have done things stupid and sick and wrong, it's not given me to judge them.

She says his name is Caleb.  Hell it is.  Either she's too taken with him to care or she's completely forgotten the stories Mum and Da used to tell us.  Fae do not give out their names.  Not ever.  Seelie or Unseelie, to hold the true name is to have power over them.

This is...completely and utterly ridiculous.  I'm not yet nineteen and I feel as drawn and empty as an old man.  I've no children and I feel as though I've failed in raising a child up right.  None of us are more than a half hour's journey from the other and yet I feel like our family is torn at the seams, miles apart and the distance growing with every passing heartbeat.

I suppose I've a decision to make, then.  This, I see, is what happens when I let those two make their own choices.

Aches me very soul to say so, but both choices are mightily tempting just now.  I'll think more on this.  One thing's certain, though - I will have Caleb's true name.  For insurance, like.

"event","It's over, for the time being.  Would that it was over forever, but it seems that there's still limits to how much I can change - creating a victory from a disaster is beyond me for now.  Not that I didn't try.  Spent an evening trying to force it, make it so that we slaughtered every man jack of 'em with only minor losses.  But it's not truth.  Sometimes I write the stories, sometimes they write themselves through me.  Of course, you never know your luck - we were outnumbered six to one or thereabouts and managed to fight them to a standstill...a victory of sorts.  A heavy cost, aye, but hopefully we've taught the Natives that we're too much trouble to interfere with.  

Aye.  And perhaps Eileen will become Archbishop of Canterbury.

I ought to be laying plans and plots.  Come to that I ought to be dead to the world with exhaustion.  I've seen to it that I impressed the right people tonight, gave courage and hope to those I fought beside - those still living, anyway.  I ought to be with them.  Helping those Irish still pushing air past their teeth, counting the dead, figuring what's next.  Yet here I sit, my eyes at half mast, and I can't even work up the desire to reach for the glass of whiskey I poured myself nor to pick up my carcass and get it to bed.  I just feel...empty.

Oh, Rabbit.  Little one.  What have you done?  What have you brought into this world?

I knew what she planned.  Could've stopped her.  Could've told Siobhan, come to that.  But no, I swore to them I'd not give away secrets not my own, swore I'd never try to control what they do.  Idiot.  Well, it's done now.  She's given Him a body.  He lives.  All that remains now is to decide what to do about it.  All that lives may die, after all.  And I for one would dearly love to see that monster spending his last moments dancing on the end of my blade.  But.  It's not given me to make the easy choice.  It never is.  

There's a war coming - I don't know when, or with whom, and everybody I've met that might be able to answer such questions has been falling all over themselves to keep me in the dark, tell me that all the challenges I've had are as nothing compared to this, tell me that I mustn't underestimate this General...so on and so forth.  If the war we're facing is truly that desperate, he might well be needed.  

It all depends on Eileen.  I pray to all that is holy she's got him under control - and not the other way 'round."

"event","My cousin Alex is here!  Not much time to write just now, we're getting him settled and there's the battle with the Natives to prepare for, but still - it's a powerful unlooked-for joy to see the smilin' face of another May.

Odd, though - Eileen doesn't seem to trust him.  To my mind that's a bit of the pot callin' the kettle black, but...I have to admit there's something strange in his ways.  A sort of anguish, sometimes.  Almost like a crisis of faith.

Well, whatever's on his mind he won't speak of it.  He is a May, after all.  Keeping our demons locked inside, letting them fester and rot - fecking family tradition, isn't it?

<i>The night of the battle falls clean and crisp, not a cloud in the sky.  The Hibernians are outnumbered, but when the time comes they fight as men inspired, like true warriors.  Like Irish.  The Mays, along with their companions, each use their gifts in their own way to cut a bloody swath through the ranks of their enemies.  Will, in particular, stays at the forefront of the battle from beginning to end, refusing to leave the field until there are no Natives left to fight.  His determination, skill and courage is seen and remembered by those Hibernians that witness it.</i>"

"event","Moira sleeps.  She looks so peaceful, so beautiful in this light, almost...well, I'd say angelic, but that term's somewhat ruined for me now, isn't it?  Can't sleep, myself.  Too much wonder in me, just now.

I'm on a train, making our way back home from upstate.  Wonderful creations, trains.  Never moved so fast in all my life, and that's no small statement.  The countryside is glorious this time of year, Nature all decked out in her finest gown before the long sleep of winter - red and gold and green, riotous colours every which way you turn the eye.  Funny, that.  I've been here since April and barely set foot outside Brooklyn.  Maddening, it is.  There's so much out there to explore, to witness - the fields, the desert, mountains, real, great forests...and yet we huddle in a tiny corner of a massive city, trying to carve ourselves another Shannen.  I'd make a fair stink about it, too, if it weren't for the work we have to do there for the Irish nation.  

Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  I'm getting married.  I'm really getting married.  I proposed to Moira, and I can only assume she suffered a momentary lapse of her usually impeccable judgment, for she said yes.  Had to meet her Da first, which was the reason for the trip.  Interesting man, is Henry Dart; works with the underground railroad, smuggling escaped slaves from the South.  Met some.  Didn't talk much, on account of my pale face - for all that I'm only Irish, not a white man.  One of 'em forgot himself, once, and called me 'master'.  Nearly lost my lunch.  I'd...never known.  Not really.  It's not the whips and chains, though they're bad enough.  It's what slavery does to a man inside.  Makes him feel less of a man, makes him believe he is less than a man.  Tell a body they're a slave and less than human enough times, and sooner or later they start to tell themselves.  They enslave themselves.  A lesson to remember when next I wax prideful over my gift to control.  And part of me has to wonder - was it one of our kind that created this horror?  It'd almost have to be.  Doesn't make a blessed lick of sense otherwise.

But Henry.  Something about the man.  When he spoke I'd swear...I had the eerie feeling I was speaking to Jacob, and then he spoke again, and warned me for a second time of the General.  Talking to Jacob?  Or...to something that speaks through them both, perhaps?  That implies...hell, I need more time to think on this.  But there's time enough for that tomorrow.

I'm getting married.  I don't know anything about getting married.  I wish my parents were here...they'd like Moira, I think."

"event","Lucifer was an angel once.  He fell because he felt himself equal to God.

The bottom's fallen out of my little world, again, and I suppose it serves me right for thinking I had my sisters pegged.  Thinking they fit so neat into the little May family cosmology I'd created in my own head.  Light and dark, mercy and malice, above and below.  And me, somewhere in between, something of both but not truly either.  Serves me right, it does.  Mays are many things, but predictable?  Definable?  Not hardly.  And another great lesson to me for again thinking of myself in relation to them.  

It's...puzzling.  We worked together so well when it came time to face Donovan and Tess.  We acted as one, then.  But it seems when we're not under attack our unity of purpose fragments...

I'm at Moira's now.  She's in her bed, though I don't doubt she's sleepless as I.  Tonight we finally settled the matter of Andrea Bates and Harper, at Siobhan's insistence.  Siobhan...gave Richard Harper cancer.  Easy as you please.  She seems to have some affinity with the body, which is funny if you think on it.  Matters of the flesh and Siobhan May wouldn't seem to go well together.  And then after he'd weakened some we went to his house late at night.  All of us - Moira and Diego in tow.  Part of me wishes Moira hadn't seen what happened, but a larger part of me is grateful.  She's seen and she understands more about what we are, what we do, then I could ever properly explain.  There was no small amount of dithering when it came time to enter - for some reason the two of them still don't grasp what we're capable of.  They think high, not broad, when it comes to using the gift - it's all dramatic with the glowin' eyes and burnin' swords, yet they can't imagine how to enter a house unnoticed.  Simple enough.  Make it so that everyone's asleep.

Siobhan was as terrifying tonight as she was glorious at the docks.  She bore a flaming sword by her side and...I suppose before she was an angel of mercy.  Tonight she was an angel of retribution.  And I choose that word as carefully as all my other words.  Not justice, not even vengeance.  Retribution.  She wanted that man to suffer.  She seemed almost disappointed when I'd told her Andrea wanted her story told, not for the old bastard to be slain.  She asked Eileen if she wanted to play with him, for God's sake.  

Play.  

I was counting on her.  I needed her to be...I don't know, our moral compass.  She was the one that held back, that still held to mortal law.  But it seems that with the proper impetus she's by far the most fell and terrible of us.  By my estimation I've the blood of twenty or thirty on my hands by now, men, women and children.  Some were mad, some were twisted and evil, and some simply had the misfortune to be in the way.  But I've never made them suffer just to watch 'em suffer.  I've never taken pleasure in what I've had to do.  If they are to live, let 'em live.  If they are to die, end them.  But not like that.  Cancer.  She gave him cancer.  For all his crimes, that's no way for a man to die.  I've never seen such arrogance in all my life, not even when Eileen goes off on one of her tears when she seems to forget that there's anyone on Earth but her.  Siobhan knows, she just seems to think that she may do with them as she pleases.

Eileen.  Oh, God, Eileen.  Little Rabbit.  What are you doing?  Moira's told me something...something terrible.  Eileen aims to give Him a body, it seems.  Make Him flesh.  Moira doesn't seem to think that He likes her much, and I can't say I feel confident of His esteem myself.  But I know that He hates Siobhan.  It was Him sent Eileen lunging for her rosary.  I'd thought I'd done something about this.  I'd thought that I'd at last done right, gotten through to her.  Not so, it seems.  All I accomplished was her talking to me less and less.  Can't blame her.  By the end I was getting tired of me earnest speeches myself.

After that horrible night Eileen told me that if she ever became a threat to Siobhan's life, she wanted me to stop her.  I wonder if she even remembers.  'Till now I never seriously entertained the thought.  After what I've learned this eve about both my sisters it seems that I have to devote some thought on how to stop them if need be.  Both of them.  

It should never have come to this.  I should never have to think the things I'm thinking now.  Perhaps I failed in the promise I made my father, but I don't know that I could have foreseen this, nor avoided it if I had.  I wish I had someone to ask for advice.

Maybe I do, at that."

"event","I've had to take a good long look at what's happening, and I can't say I much like it.

There's good all right, don't mistake my meaning.  There's powerful good happening to me and mine.  So much so that I feel a right arse for having misgivings.  The battle went as I wrote, to the letter.  Siobhan was a thing of glory today, and not only in the reclaiming of her power.  She saved him.  Donovan was bearing down on her, allies at hand, and Siobhan bent her will to saving the Beast from his bondage.  I never even considered that he might need savin'.  And if I'm to be honest to mine own self, I have to admit that even if I had it might not have made a lick of difference.  That's what humbles me when I look upon her.  Not the eldritch glowing, not the healing, not the valkyrie-like triumph with which she rode from the fray.  Those are effects, not causes.  The fact that she can show such grace when her life and her very soul are on the line...I can sacrifice, aye.  I know all about sacrifice, me.  But to do something like that...it's beyond conceiving.  And so I am profoundly grateful that one of us, at least, can show such courageous mercy.  

I try to tell them.  Both of them.  When they do me proud.  Do they hear me?  Do they know how much of them I see?  It's not all, that I know.  We're all too bound in secrets for that.  But enough.  Enough to know what they fight against, how their victories cost them.  

Cost.  There's always a cost.  And I think I see now what it is.  You can't use tools without thinkin' of them as tools, and that counts double for people.  The whole wild wide world is as a tool for such as us, if we only choose to take it up.  That's the power.  And the cost is exactly the same thing as the power.  Why is Declan such a git?  Hell, how could he be otherwise?  Everything is a tool.  Do you socialize with a knife?  Have dinner with cattle?  Bandy words with a chamber pot?  The more you use the power the less you value all that's normal in the world, things, people, anything but your own self and whatever mad goals you hold.  

Siobhan left humanity behind a little more today.  As did Eileen.  As did I.  I caused that riot without thinking twice about its outcome after Donovan was crushed beneath it.  Irishmen dying in the streets, blood soaking the ground, their guts spilling from their bellies.  And I wouldn't leave, I couldn't.  I made it happen.  And I stared into the chaos in hopes of finding something in me that...I waited.  I hoped to find that I could still feel pity, or remorse.  And all I could find in myself was a vague sense of regret that I hadn't thought to write down the outcome of the battle.  No, mostly what I was thinking of just then was how best to turn this to my advantage.  The Hibernians'll be needing heroes after today.  No.  It's not the same.  It's only to help them, to lead them.  Whatever else I leave behind, I'm still a proud fecking Irishman, and will be till my dying day.  If there's no remorse, at least there's responsibility.

I will not become Declan.  I will not.

At least I still walk with my feet on the good earth.  Siobhan's raising up above us to Heaven, Eileen is going outside of us to the dark that lies beyond, but I'll still be here.  They'll leave me, one day, just like everyone else does.  But I'll be here.  Always here.  Here, now.  Always.

No.  Madness talk, that.  And there's plenty to be grateful for.  Diego's a good sort, bright, powerful.  Sweet on Siobhan.  So maybe not as bright as all that - he's got his work cut out for him, sure enough.  But I'm glad there's someone about that can see her for what she is.  Especially after seein' the look on Rabbit's face.  I'd thought we were done with that.  They're both fools, sometimes.  How could there ever be dark without light?  Light without dark?  They needn't fight.  It will not come to blood between them.  I won't let it.  No more.  

I told Moira that I love her tonight.  I don't know why that frightens me so.  I can ponder horrid death and stolen souls, I can think on what it means to become inhuman, I can lay plans for a battle to shake and shape the earth and make the rivers run red, but apparently the notion of meeting Moira's Da is more than I can bear.  One more step closer to...hell, out with it.  I'll be proposing sometime soon.  Moira's...different.  Strong, wise, wicked.  Powerful in her own way.  Funny, I'm not even worried she'll be leaving me like the others.  I'm worried one day I'll be leaving her.  Not to keep her safe or any such rot.  For the cause.  For something greater.  Just like Da.  Are ye out there, Da?  Mum?  Seamus?  Ian?  Where'd you all go?  How long till you call me to join you?

I...bah.  Bah!  Is this William May, then?  Thunder and Lord Jesus, boy, you'd think some surly faerie had come around and left a changeling in the skin of ol' laughin' Will.  Can't keep to a happy subject to save me life tonight.  Well, bad times'll be along soon enough without me conjurin' them - no sense becomin' a dead-faced sourpuss like my youngest sister.  We're alive, we won, I've the love of a good woman and a drawer full o' whiskey, which I mean to make good use of withal.  The, uh, whiskey, that is.  Hah!  That's a bit better.  Pain's for later.  Right now's for joy.  Best get to it."

"event","Ah, but the testing begins right away, doesn't it?  I've yet to learn.  Write it, and it shall be so.  Some of it.  The painful parts, seems like.  We've a plan, and a good one too, and...well, I won't be the one up front.  Siobhan'll be the one to talk to 'em face to face.  Can't say I like it.  Well.  Bit of an understatement, that.  Drives me mad sending my sister into danger while I fade into the crowd and fling daggers.  But it's the better plan, and she's willing.  So we'll do what we must.

<i>The day the coffin ship arrives is cold, a chill north wind heralding the coming winter.  A steady rain falls as the Mays wake, each knowing in their heart of hearts that this will be the day.

The harbour is already a hive of frantic activity as they arrive; Hibernians loiter about in groups both obvious and hidden, warily eyeing the growing group of Natives.  Policemen wander to and fro as politicians, nuns and other such unsavoury persons prepare to woo another weakened shipment of displaced Irishmen.  The ship pulls alongside the dock as it all begins - Will hides amongst a group of Hibernians known to him, while Eileen hides in the shadows.  Siobhan walks to the centre of the dock, head unbowed, and tugs with all her might upon her thread, calling what is hers to come home.

Donovan has had enough.  For weeks this has been spoiling his days and disturbing his nights.  It is time to end this.

The dock is in chaos, barely directed, Irish stumbling from the boat into a cacophony of catcalls, offers of aid, and thrown chunks of rotted fruit.  Cargo is unloaded, dangling from flimsy lines overhead.  There are few children among them this time; those that could make the journey have either left already or resigned themselves to staying in the homeland.  Siobhan opens her eyes as a knot of her shivering countrymen pass by and finds herself face to face with Donovan.

When Donovan moves to strike Siobhan down, William acts without a moment's hesitation.  ""That fecking Native is messing with my sister!"" he hollers as he flings his blade at Donovan.  The Hibernians about him immediately charge into the fray, bearing down on Donovan, pinning him to the earth and keeping him still for what William will do with his keen knife.

When it is over, Siobhan has regained what is hers, what was always hers, and more.  Having fought so hard to regain it, she accepts her lost power back into her soul without fighting it, without denying it, and finally embraces what she is, what she's always been:  chosen of God himself.  She emerges from the battle unhurt and crowned in newfound glory.</i>

I...I think...that's right.  I'm not rightly sure where that last part came from, it's...just how the story is meant to go.  

I...sometimes feel that I'm not writing anything.  Like the stories just use me to write themselves.

No more tonight."

"event","I'd give my other ear to know why Declan's helping us.  Well, no, actually.  Must remember not to make careless statements like that, Will.  Well, I'd give someone's ear, anyway.  But it doesn't add up.  The only one of us he seems fond of in the slightest is Siobhan - by which I mean he seems like he can almost bear her company.  She's made me right proud lately, she has.  I honestly wasn't sure that she'd come out of it.  But she has, or is - and damned if she's not the stronger for it.

Declan, Declan.  A mystery, sure enough.  Possibilities keep coming to me, each one more crazed and suspicious than the last.  I put forth the least mad to my sisters - Declan owes a favour to a May from times past, and this is how he chooses to repay it.  Eileen didn't think much of that.  Seems she thinks Declan's not the sort to trouble himself repaying favours.  Still doesn't get it, that one, and that worries me some.  Rabbit of all of us should understand that when you incur a debt, you pay it - sooner or later, whether you will or no.  Even in what we do.  No, especially in what we do.  Has she forgotten entirely about Breaghwy?  About Ian?  There is always, always a price.  I've started, slowly, to discharge a few of my own - got that back pay from Becker, and told Jacob that he'll have my aid if ever he needs it.  Mundane debts - but I feel the need to get 'em over and done with.  Which still leaves the Hibernians.  It'll take some doing, that.  At what price a man's life, let alone six?  I'll just have to do what I can, when I can.  I mean to put myself at Alex's disposal for dirty work; if nothing else, I think I can prove as able as six ordinary men at skulduggery.

The second possibility is...well, nothing I can fault the old bastard for, as it's a notion I've had on my own, some weeks past now.  Form an army.  There's a storm coming one day:  there've been omens, and more, I feel it in the tides of my blood.  I'm assuming here that it'll be these enemies of the magic, the ones Declan spoke of...hmm now, I wonder if the General that Jacob warned me of has anything to do with this?  Anyway.  Faced with such foes, ought not we band together, form a force of our own?  If they truly are such a danger, it won't matter in the end if we work in shadow, in stories, or in stolen power - they'll just pick us off one by one.  I see it in my mind's eye, a mighty alliance, a hundred or more all bending our wills towards one end.  Is there any end to what we could do?  Pull the stars from the sky, unmake our adversaries, or...or cause a famine.  Terrifying.  Glorious.  Not a thought I relish, come to that - there's too much danger, too much power.  Like using a pistol to swat a fly, in a crowded room.  But in the end it may be necessary.  I've been thinking lately of seeking out those like us, just starting out, and banding together, teaching each other what we know.  What's to keep Declan from grooming us, forming his own army so that he'll not have to stand alone when the time comes?  Not a comfortable thought, that.  

Then of course there's the matter of belief.  Declan has made some statements on what can and cannot be done, and bold ones too...especially for a man that says such statements will limit us.  Some of what he's told us seems to make sense, almost intuitively.  Some I know to be a load of bollocks.  Can't defeat six men?  Can't ever know peace?  Says fecking who?  I'll do these things and more if I damn well please.  Now then.  Perhaps, for purposes of his own, Declan is consciously trying to shape us, to control exactly what it is that we believe.  What better way to know an enemy's limitations than to have a hand in forming them?  What better way to cripple an enemy than to convince him of what is and is not possible?  I tried not to say much during the training, tried to do what he wanted without swallowing the theory.  I fear I've not been very successful, but at least I'm aware, I'm trying.  I'm making up my own damned mind.

Hell, I sound mad.  I even had a paranoid moment last week when I feared that Declan was in truth Donovan in disguise.  Masquerading as someone we trust, using his face to feed us lies and keep us weak.  Given all we've learned, that's not likely.  Whatever his motivations, we have learned, we are stronger.  If he is Donovan, he's chosen a very complex way of committing suicide.

Which might be a mercy, come to that.

I asked Eileen a little while ago what we ought to live for.  Wasn't despair, that.  Far from it.  It was a thing of genuine yearning on my part, genuine curiosity.  Consider:  we no longer have to worry about money, or food, or shelter, or any of the thousand other small things that make up the bulk of a normal man's life.  I remember that life.  Distantly, as though in a dream, though it wasn't so very long ago.  Mortgage payments, labour, eat, sleep, over and over, crushing the spirit, exhausting the body.  An endless round of drudgery and despair, interspersed with the rare moment of true wonder.  It's no mystery to me why the vast mass of humanity lets others tell them what to believe - forging it for yourself is hard, and most don't have the time or the strength.  Well.  We're beyond all that now.  We walk in a different world.

I've wondered why this is so much in my thoughts of late.  Figured it out just lately - we were in the kitchen, enjoying some whiskey, and Eileen and Siobhan were ganging up on me (strange enough on its own...) and I felt strange.  Both happy and desolate, all at once.  And it hit me.

They don't need me any more.

Looking back, for a time I was the one that knew how to fight, I was the one that put food in our mouths.  It's not been like that for some while now, and it's only becoming more so as time passes.  Little Rabbit can take a bullet in the face and not suffer so much as a scratch, and God only knows what Siobhan will be able to do when she reclaims her thunder.  I don't have to be the strong one, I don't have to fling myself between them and the world.  Only doing myself harm, and frustrating my sisters while I'm at it.  Which means...I'm free.  They've no need of me trying to protect them, trying to solve their trials for them, staying up all night worrying over their pains.  If they ever did.  Well, I won't be going anywhere just yet - but maybe I should try to take a step or two back, aye?

I...somehow thought I'd enjoy the feeling more.  Da told me to look after them, and I've been living out that promise for years.  Even when I failed - which I have to admit I did, more often than not - it was my solid place to stand.  What I was here for.  That's gone now.  And if I'm to be any good to anyone, I'll have to be finding a purpose of my own.

I know what I am, sure enough.  I am a bard and warrior.  I am the inheritor of whatever ancient power runs through the May clan.  I am a throwback to the mythic age of Erin when the sons of gods walked among us.  I am kin to and heir of those heroes, and every step I take shakes the ground.  So what am I to do with it now, where do I go from here?  Perhaps...ah, back to the beginning, idiot boy.  Back to that night when all the world slept and I met the poet Finnegas on a dark, dark road.  I want to know.  I want the secret names of all the stars.  I want to speak to the people in this city in their own tongues.  I want to learn to bind books with my own two hands.  I want to know what it's like to be a barman and a brewer, both.  I want to lead the errant children of Erin into battle and know that I will have victory.  I want to know everything, and tell the truth of it after.

A god, eh, Rabbit?  

Well, it's a start, anyway."

"event","The next person to tell me I'm stupid gets a fist in the gob.

I'm not an especially prideful man, I don't think.  Proud of my people, aye.  Proud of my family, sure enough.  I've even learned, slowly and painfully, to have some small measure of pride in what it is I can do, the power my words can carry when I let 'em.  But I've swallowed my pride enough times over the years, letting them all think there's nothing more to me than a love of the drink and the occasional well-turned phrase.  For all that, I do believe I am reaching my limit for bearing insults and mockery.  For pity's sake, what did they expect me to do?  What else could I have done, with what paltry knowledge I had?  When I called out Declan he refused me answers.  I asked him to tell me the rules, for some small aid in how to deal with the three, some hint.  I admitted my ignorance.  He told me next to nothing - called the three mere ruffians, said that we had bigger things to worry about.  Went into rhapsodies about how limitless our talents are.  

Well.  That fateful night proved we've some impressive limits after all.  I did have a plan, and a good one at that.  Don't rightly know how it turned around on us so badly.  Perhaps I tried to change too much, perhaps the Hibernian attack introduced some element I couldn't control.  It all ended with our house ablaze and me carved to ribbons with a hand axe.  At least this time I've lost nothing that won't grow back.

And then Declan showed up again.  He offered to teach us what he knows, and he told us we were stupid to attempt what we did.  Said we were ruffians too, which would have been nice to know a little earlier.  I can accept losing, Lord knows I've done it enough times.  I can accept that Donovan is stronger than us in just about every way that matters.  I can even accept that the plan I was so proud of ended up being, for whatever reason, useless.  I will not, however, accept that with what infinitesimal information I had at hand I could've done any better, leaving aside blind luck.  I can't help but think my parents did me a disservice.  I see now that they were leaving me free to shape my gift without interference, and for that I honor them.  But too little direction, surely that's as bad as too much?  You can't write a poem without reading a few first.

But.  That's past, and I've bigger fish to fry just now.  I've been practicing using the magics I have at my command, and I think I've got stronger.  Certainly more daring.  Just seems to come a little easier these days, and I'll need that.  I think we've both...no, we've all three of us done well to come as far as we have without opposition.  Now that we've enemies, we've got to get better at countering their power, and fast.  I've some ideas I want to run past Eileen, ways to practice pitting our wills against each other in a way that won't get us hurt.  We can't simply wait for Declan to tell us...

For Declan to tell us.

Hang about.  Why would he change his mind so swiftly?  Why is he trying so hard to make me feel as though I'm a congenital idiot, like I need his help if I'm to survive?  Something...is not right here.

""Clever boy...""

Oh God.  I've been a fool, and a fool, and a thrice damned fool.  I am stupid.  Not for doing what I've done, but for believing them.  Believing I am helpless, and weak.  For letting them make me angry, when my strength lies not there.  For believing I had to defeat them by trying to be something I'm not.  Some stout war-god that can stand there and soak up blow after blow?  I'm not Finn Mac Cumhail, I'm not Cuchulainn.  Those were Ian's favorites.  Ian is gone.  There's only me, and I take after the wise ones, the quick ones.  Taleisin.  Cormac Mac Art.  Diarmiad.  

Why in the name of God Almighty did I let him ever hit me?  I'm faster than that.  Much faster than that.  

<I>I am swifter than the arrow as it leaves the bow, swifter than the spectral steeds of Niamh the Golden-haired.  Too fast for the eye to follow, too fast for the arm to touch</i>.

And I will not ever suffer anyone to tell me what I should believe.  

I'll not write what I fear of him...I worry they may be watching even now, and God only knows what they've been doing since that night.  I'll listen.  And I'll watch.  More closely than he knows.  Everything is going to be very different now.

Now, gods:  stand up for ruffians."

"event","I've not written for some time.  I've been resting - two weeks in the hospital.  I've been shut in with shrieking harpies they've the temerity to call nurses, pestered at every waking moment, mad with inactivity and subjected to a personal Sunday sermon, fretting all the while that my sisters will kill each other...and yet...and yet it's been the most restful and peaceful time I can ever remember.  No need to fight.  No need to struggle every second of every day, or go charging madly off to look after my kin.  There's just idleness and healing.  Not something I'm keen to ever repeat, mind, but I've got to admit it was pleasent to be looked after for once.

There's things that happened that defy even my growing willingness to accept the incredible, and that's the other reason I've not written since being admitted.  Eileen...is a grown woman, now.  Not in the metaphorical sense or in regards to her intellect.  Eileen May aged ten years in a single night.  When I saw her...I didn't know her at first, of course, how could I?  That simply does not happen.  But it did.  She made it so.  

I tried to put on a brave face, seem delighted.  I think she believed me; and truth to tell, it wasn't all a sham on my part.  I've been looking forward to seeing what kind of woman she becomes, and she's...well, she's beautiful, and strong, and bright.  But I can't...I know I'm not her father.  But I've been the one, for five years now, to dry her tears, drive away the darkness, pick her up when she's fallen and offer her comfort.  It's a bittersweet feeling, watching someone like that grow up, knowing that every moment is a grain of sand that will soon be gone.  And it's happened all at once.  Gone.  Forever.  She'll never have the slow wakening to the world that the rest of us have, never have that time again.  She says she won't regret.  Sure, and that's easy to say now.  Annie Effie May didn't give birth to any idiots, but by God, my sisters act the part sometimes.  Not regret ten years of your life forever gone, those years in which your body, mind and spirit first blossom into feverish awareness, with all the heat and power and wild feelings only one of that age has?  Ah, sister, you're fooling yourself.  Then again...I suppose perhaps she'll never miss what she never knew.

Be that as it may, I managed to keep my composure until she and Moira finally left me be.  Put on a brave face.  Happy, funny, lazy, drunken, unconcerned William, aye, that's me.  There's no need for them to know I barely slept that night for weeping.

It's that coupled with what Declan told me that's got me all in a lather, I think.  Though I don't know that I believe him, entirely.  Spent too long believing what others've told me, I have.  No limits, though.  Truly no limits.  It's people like us that choose the kings and the popes, it's people like us that choose the shape of the land and the currents of the sea.  We are the gods of this world.  Just knowing that, seeing what one of my sisters can do when she puts her mind to it, seeing what happens to my other sister just for being what she is...

Are we even human any more?

More to the heart of the matter...do I even want to be?  Already I find myself not worrying or caring much about the mortgage.  I can make the money happen, if I so choose.  It's simply not important to me any longer.  And what little qualm I had on the matter of undoing those that have violated my sister have evaporated like the morning dew.  I am changing, deeper than heart or mind, and I'm a little afraid of what I'm to become.

Could Moira ever love a man that thinks like this?  Hm.  Perhaps I should just up and ask her.  We're neither of us getting any younger.  Or safer.  Well.  On the morrow we'll know for certain whether we should move against them, and then we'll see just what we can do."

"event","<i>Eileen sleeps.  The shapes of her dreams are as usual, touched with darkness and fear.  She twists and turns in her bed, her hands held out in a gesture of supplication, whimpering.  Just as her terror reaches its peak, when the dream would always shatter and catapult her screaming into wakefulness, something changes.

A shaft of daylight suddenly pours down upon Eileen.  She turns to find her sister standing above her, her hands held out to Eileen.  Siobhan wears white, illuminated as though from within, the strange light banishing her usual plainness.  ""Come now, sister, or we shall be late.  They're waiting on us,"" she murmurs, and Eileen, feeling none of the rage her sister usually inspires in her, allows herself to be gathered up and drawn forth from the nightmare.

Eileen finds herself being led down a path in a massive daylit forest, the tops of the trees stretching up to infinity above their heads.  Before long they reach a fork in the road, and find William sitting there, dressed in black, where the paths diverge.  He smiles lazily, setting down a book as he leaps up to take Eileen's other hand and lead his sisters down the right hand path.  When Eileen turns to look back at the untaken left path, he shakes his head and whispers, ""You've been that way before.  You know where that leads.  Come see something new.""

The three emerge into a wide clearing.  The air has that luminous quality particular to midsummer evenings just before sunset, and a massive bonfire at the clearing's centre fills the breeze with the scent of woodsmoke and roasting beef.  A pair of figures can be just barely seen hazily through the flames, waving at the May children.  Eileen looks to her siblings, who stopped at the edge of the clearing.  Will just smiles and shrugs, a little sadly, and Siobhan says, ""It's not our turn yet.  You go on.  We'll be waiting for you.""

Eileen walks forward, her pace picking up speed until she finds herself running, straight for the fire.  She gathers herself and leaps, landing and rolling away from the blaze on the green grass beyond.  ""Well, now,"" says a man's voice, ""haven't you grown into a fine young lady?  I certainly hope you've been minding your brother and sister!""  Eileen looks up into the eyes of her father, his mischievously smiling eyes belying his words.  ""Tsk,"" says a second voice, ""we'll have none of your tomfoolery, James May.""  Eileen's mother walks forward, hands on hips and endeavoring to look fierce, but a smile plays upon her lips as well.  ""We've work to do, and the young miss here is tardy.""

Eileen's parents draw her to the far side of the clearing, where there lies a pool, perfectly round, deep, and cold.  There is a presence inside; Eileen can feel it in her bones.  She looks questioningly at her father.  He smiles.  ""Ah, you're wondering what's within.  Well, the truth to that is, there's only what you brought with you.""  Eileen's mother kneels to look her in the eyes, her gaze piercing.  ""You came here from a dark place, Eileen.  Dark because of what you've done, aye, but more because think you can't turn away.  But you brought Him with you.  He's there, in the well.  If you've the courage to look within and face what you see, the pool will show you his true face, and reveal his weakness to you.""

Eileen walks towards the pool, her hands gripping her parents, her heart pounding within her chest, and just as she stands on the lip of the pool and is about to look over, the dream dissolves.  She wakes with a start, staring at the ceiling of her room, her breathing slowly returning to normal.

When Eileen finally falls back into sleep, her rest is deep and undisturbed until she wakes the next morning.</i>

There.  Done.  Let's see what Rabbit makes of it.  

I pray to all that's holy I've done right.  But I can't do nothing."

"event","I'm sittin' on top of the bloody world this evening.  I ought to be in bed, hell, we didn't even leave the house until midnight, but I'm too full of jittery joy to sleep.  Ah, I worry myself sometimes.  Can't speak well of the state of my soul that I enjoy myself so much during these clandestine outings.  I know, I know, I got mightily sick of this sort of thing back in Galway, but...ah, that was different.  I didn't have the sense then that I was captain of my own soul.  The tiniest detail of each task was always laid out for us, and we were never to keep any of our lucre.  And I suppose that anything, even skulduggery, grows wearisome enough when it's your job.  But tonight, God!  What a perfect evening.  The job went off without a hitch.  Well, no, strictly speaking that's not in the way of truth.  There were hitches, aye, as there always are, but we rode them out with hardly a moment's hesitation.  Had to kill a guard dog.  Quite a relief that I managed to dispatch it with a minimum of fuss.  I think that may've upset my sisters, they've both always been a soft touch for animals.  Better it than us is what I say.  

I've not told them yet how well they both accorded themselves, and that's a failing in me.  Should've been the first words out my gob - Siobhan's all torn up inside that we've done what we've done, and I think any kind word will do wonders for Rabbit just now.  Well, there's time enough for praise in the morn.  Still, they did me proud.  I'm blessed to have such strong sisters.  Aye, and remember that next time they drive you round the bend with their peevish, blinkered stubbornness, Will.  Well, it's all of a package, isn't it?  Come down to it, I'll take a pair of strong-willed harridans I can't manage for love nor money over the simpering samelings you see in the streets of New York any day.

I know there's like to be a powerful storm of darkness soon.  In truth, nothing much has been solved - not the murder of Andrea Bates, nor the question of Him and what he's doing to Rabbit.  Just now, I don't care.  To all appearances Moira's as sweet on me as I am on her, and she gets along swimmingly with my family.  We've done a powerful large favour for the Hibernians.  My work on the Cycle of Erin is coming along nicely.  All's right under Heaven."

Doesn't feel right putting down what Rabbit told me.  Not knowing what it cost her as I do.  I tried, again, to tell her that she doesn't have to bear the burden alone.  And again, I failed to make her understand.  And I'm starting to understand how all this works.  She doesn't believe that there's any way to change what's coming, and so there isn't.  She doesn't have faith that He can be defeated, and so he can't.  If I could only get her to hope, just for an instant...

I think I'm going to have to interfere.  Just this once.  And I'll not force her to choose; I just have to show her that there's more than one choice.  I'll get Siobhan to help.  Thank God for her, she's been a rock lately.  Thought about asking her if she happened to intercede on Mary MacPhearson's behalf, then decided it's not worth it.  Foregone conclusion anyway - it was a miracle, after all.  Siobhan's stock in trade.  Nice to know what we have can be used for good, sometimes...though I have to wonder what the price for that life saved will be.

All we have to do is make it through tomorrow night, and once the Hibernian job is done with, I'll write Rabbit a dream."

"event","Been a rough week, all things considered, but I believe I've taken a step or two in the right direction.  That useless bugger at the docks, Becker, he's been taking some liberties with my person since the day I missed work.  Well, I talked to Alex about it, and I think some of his lads are going to take care of things.

I feel a bit odd all of a sudden.  Keep picking up my quill to write on Eileen and Siobhan, or Moira, or work on the Cycle of Erin, but my mind keeps circling back on itself, back to Becker and what's to happen tonight, I...

Hell with it.



<i>Lee Becker stumbles down the alleyway behind the Winchester Saloon.  Payday today; and, as is his habit, he's already spent a good portion of his wages on gin and women of dubious character.  Between the dark and his drink-skewed vision, he doesn't see the stout redheaded man walking towards him until he's already stumbled into him.  ""Watch your step, idiot,"" Lee growls, shoving the figure away from him.  ""Well now, sir,"" responds the man in an unmistakable Irish brogue, ""could well be that I could say the same to you, aye?""  Becker snarls.  ""Great.  Just great - another God-damned Irishman getting uppity with me.  I ought to teach you a lesson, you useless mick...""  His voice trails off abruptly as more figures detach themselves from the darkness until he is surrounded, six men idly tapping fingers on clubs and saps.  ""I daresay there's a lesson to be taught tonight, son,"" says the lead Irishman, and then they lay into him, beating Lee within an inch of his life.  When, at last, it is over, and Lee is lying bleeding on the cold, wet ground, hanging on to consciousness by a thread, one of his attackers leans close to his smashed face and hisses, ""We're given to understand that you're rather fond of venting your spleen on 'uppity Irishmen'.  You might want to consider changing your choice of targets - otherwise I can't guarantee the next lesson you learn will be so gentle.""  Then they were gone, leaving only the broken, bloodied man in the alley as evidence of their passing.</i>



I feel...strange.  I'm trembling.  I want to say that I've no idea why I wrote that just now, but it's a lie.  I've been flailing around for so long, afraid of not having any focus for my gift, afraid to use what I know is in me, and I couldn't keep it in any longer.  It's truth.  This is what is going to happen, and I made it so.  Is this what my sisters feel when they use the Power?  Do they understand the enormity of what we are?  Do they wonder, as I do now, what the limits are?  Words fail.  We are...we are as gods, rewriting the world as we see fit.  I'd be a liar of the first order if I were to say I'm not touched with a bit of pride just now, smitten with the taste of it.  I could have anything I want.  Anyone.

There's that, aye, but mostly what I feel is blind terror.  I know, now, that it's not just the Mays that have the gift.  Rabbit's gotten herself into a world of trouble with it, and she's not even ill-intentioned - just young and selfish, as only someone of that age can be.  My mind recoils in horror at the thought of what a truly evil person could do with this.

I have to be more careful.  I understand it, now.  I've used it, and I think I can repeat it if need be, but...it's dangerous.  I mustn't again, if there's any way to achieve my aims through mundane means.  Jesus.  If this is what I can do when I bend my will to it, what've I done without being aware of it?

I've an idea, all of a sudden.  If the word is my access to the Power, then maybe I've a way to speak to Andrea Bates after all."

"event","Is it strange to be disgusted with and proud of yourself, all at once?

The night before last was bad.  Last night was worse.  I suppose I'd best begin at the beginning, then.  Rabbit woke me screaming - another night terror, worse than I'd seen in...I don't know that I've ever seen it so bad, come to that.  I tried to get her to talk, but truth be said I don't know if she even heard me.  She goes so far, sometimes.  And I remembered how Da used to bring her back to Earth by telling her a tale...never saw any rhyme or reason in 'em myself, but whatever story he told always seemed to be just the one she needed to hear.  I wonder at that, now.  Never did then, of course - that age, Father is another name for God in a son's heart.  Da always knew what to do.  Or was he making it up as he went along as well?

It's been a long time since I told Rabbit a story.  I spun some tales of selkies and merfolk on the voyage over the ocean to keep all our minds off the horror of the coffin ship, and I wrote her a few of the old legends in her last birthday gift, but...see, the thing of it is, I don't want my sisters thinkin' that I'm trying to be Da.  I know what they think of me, and that much, at least, is true - I'm not a tenth of the man Da was.  And while I want him to be proud of me, I don't want to be him, try to take his place.  I just want to be William.

Well, Rabbit's shakes were getting worse so I decided to try, and...something happened.  I told her the story of Finn and the Scots giant - which between me and thee is an all right story, but not the best, and it certainly didn't have any moral that related to our situation.  Not a bit.  I made up something about things sometimes seeming more frightening than they are.  In hindsight I'd say that was exactly the wrong tack to take, as things are far worse than they seem.  But - and here's the funny thing - seemed to me that the very act of the telling calmed her, let her sleep.  Me?  I didn't sleep...somehow I didn't really need to, after that.  Something moved in me.  Or through me.  Stories.  Always knew they had power, but...well, I was thinking allegorically when I ought to be literal.

I don't know where to begin the telling of last night.  It changed everything.  Or, no.  It's the start of everything changing, but only if we - I - make it so.  It's only been one night, but the silence has fallen again.  Think we're all walking on eggshells, a bit, and no wonder.  We all said things last night there's no taking back.

I suppose I've known for a time that I'm too soft on Rabbit.  Just never gave it much thought, but...there's no point denying it, not here, not now.  I knew it was her.  I knew that she bargained something away to the faeries to bar the ghosts from our home.  I just wouldn't let myself believe that she would keep something like that from me.  It took Siobhan to say it aloud.

Then the bad things came.  Rabbit called them down.  She ran outside and carved open her flesh with a keen knife and let her blood fall upon the earth, and...she was different, then.  Old.  And powerful.  And I don't know what she was speaking with or what it said, but I can guess.  It was of the unseelie, and she called it down against the spirits of the house, and against Siobhan and myself.  Something dark.  I heard the ring of command in her voice, but I can't help wondering who was commanding who.

I swept her up in my arms and carried her into the house, spilling salt on the doorway as I passed.  It kept the dark presence out, but Rabbit was still in thrall to it, I fear - she lunged at Siobhan and tried to rip the rosary from about her throat.  Mum's rosary.  So strong, she was - how does a girl of eleven get so strong?

It all came into focus, just then.  I felt their wills, just as sure as I breathe.  The Power.  And they were using it to batter at each other.  And I finally acted.  Siobhan has her God and her beads, Rabbit has her blood and faeries, but I have the words.  And I used the words to slip between them and loosen their grip and soften their hearts, and speak to them of Mum and Da, of unity and of faith.

Rabbit crumpled then - she'd been bleeding all the while and it took its toll.  I kept talking.  Always knew I was a silver-tongued blabberer, but I didn't think I had quite so many words in me.  Kept her awake, long enough for Siobhan to come with a doctor.  Have to ask her sometime how she managed that - couldn't have been gone ten minutes.  Maybe a neighbor.  Maybe she just willed it so.  But we got her bandaged and stitched and put her to bed, and then I went about the house doing what was necessary with salt and iron nails.  He may be angry - let him rail.  He's not getting in this house again.

So it's a relief, then.  We've torn open the wound, sure enough, and now we have to scoop out the sick and the rot that's been festering within all this while, and it's going to hurt.  And that's my doing, which accounts for the pride.  The shame in my heart is that I let it get this far, the silence and the secrets.  I let myself forget that Rabbit is strong-willed and secretive, and that Siobhan is bull-headed and a sight more intelligent than she lets on.  And I never knew the depths in either of 'em - that the faeries came to Siobhan first of all of us and she rejected them, or just how far from our good Earth Rabbit can go, how very powerful she is.  I thought she'd learned her lesson from Ian.  Did I do wrong, to forgive her?  Where are you now, brother - are you at peace, or do you rage at the family that left you behind, bargained you away for the life of one nameless soldier?

I can't not forgive her.  Don't know that it's wise, but there it is.  She's my sister and beneath it all she's still a wee slip of a girl, lost, frightened.  I'll not drive her away.  Couldn't if I wanted.  Either of them.  

Which is why I hurt, come to that.  Do they, I wonder, agonize over unkind things said, as I do?  I know what they think of me - Will the happy, lazy drunk.  Both of 'em giving me grief for drinking two and a half glasses of whiskey.  If they only knew what I give up for them, how often I've wanted to tear into the night, get lost in the haze and magic warmth of the pub, forget all my troubles.  Not once since Galway, and have they noticed?  Have they bollocks.

Dark thoughts for such a bright day - and this evening will be hard enough without me dwelling on slights.  Still, I wish...

No.  It is what it is."

"event","I am in a blind bloody rage.  I have to get this out of me and on to cool stark paper or I'll start smashing china, and I don't think I want to drive Siobhan round the bend again so soon.

We've moved into our new house and found it haunted.  Can't rightly say why I even bother to be surprised.  Time to time I wonder if some warlock back in Eire laid a curse on the May family.  Not as though anyone'd bother to tell me if they did; there'd just be significant looks and cryptic comments and no one ever giving me a straight fecking answer.

I thought I had it figured.  Well, not figured, but I was sure that the locket was the key to the mystery - Siobhan, or whatever was riding around in Siobhan's skin for the past day and a half, was obsessed with it.  Well, whatever it was a key to, the lock's been taken away.  I helped her move the bed to where she saw the spirit and settled down to wait, sure that she'd come for the locket before long.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  A thump and a few minutes and she's right back to her old self, harping on me to move the bed back, thank you very much, and bawling me out for breaking the door - which she has no memory of, by the bye.

So it's done.  Nothing.  No answers, no solved mystery, it just faded away.  Sure, and I'm pleased to have our house be our house - the thought of getting a good night's sleep fills me with no small measure of pleasure.  And aye, there is some pride in knowing that we endured and won through.  But every man I spoke to of ghosts said what I already believed - if there's spirits chained to the Earth then they need our help to go on.  Did we help them?  I fear not.  I certainly didn't.  Siobhan was too crazed to do much other than mutter and fret, and I can't bring myself to accept that the earthbound dead can be released by rearranging the furniture.  <strike>Rabb</strike> Eileen, now...well, she may have done something, sure enough.  But she's not been overly subtle when it comes to weilding her...influence.  And it'd be a fine thing if she had done something and not told me.  Such as inviting the preist over without a by-your-leave.  Ah, I shouldn't accuse her, not when I've nothing but suspicion and bitterness in my heart.

What drives me mad is the attitude my sisters take to the whole affair.  Eileen seems to care for nothing else other than it's over, and Siobhan refuses to believe any of it, despite the evidence before her face.  How can they be so completely incurious?  Why were the ghosts here?  Why have they gone?  Are they truly at rest now?  Are there any yet living that could tell us - or that might have to answer for - what happened in this house?  Ugh - it's enough to make me want to shake them.

This is not over.  I have the artifacts of the restless dead and some ideas of where to look next.  I will find the truth and I will ensure that it will not go unremembered.  

I feel calmer, a bit, but the anger that filled my heart has given way to pain.  There's a wrongness here.  There's secrets and silence.  Is this what we came to America for, to drift apart and become strangers to each other?  I've kept things from my sisters to keep them from worry or hurt, and now I come to question that.  Perhaps it's better to have all out in the open.  Maybe it's worth the risk.  

At least I have seeing Moira again to look forward to."

"event","In no wise should I be up at this hour.  I seem to be having another episode wherein I fear for my sanity.

This evening Eileen suffered the Curse for the first time.  She's in no small amount of pain.  Breaks my heart.  I feel something between a brother and a father about her, and her childhood is coming to an end.  She's growing up, is our little Rabbit, and part of that means secrets - she'll not tell me everything any more.  Saddening to any elder brother's heart, but in her it's terrifying.  I may not be able to find a pet rabbit in a barn, but I watch people close, sure enough - when the wind blows north by northeast I can tell a hawk from a handsaw.  And I can tell that Rabbit has a witching way about her.  She sees things, she can make things happen, for good or ill.  I won't sleep well at night not knowing what's in her heart.  

I wonder...and I hate myself a little for not wondering sooner...what Siobhan thinks of all this.  True enough that we've dissembled on some matters, her ways are not the old ways, after all, and there's no point in telling her of bloody deeds done by moonlight.  But she felt it last night, as well.  I wondered...no.  There was no sound.  I'm sure of that much.  Rabbit woke, and then I did, and then Siobhan.  Did she realize there was no earthly reason for us two to be shocked out of a sound slumber?  I think...I think she had another of her night-terrors.  She was hurting, I know, but she couldn't stop scratching at her neck...and she'd that wide eyed fear of going back to sleep that I remember from when she was a child.  I imagine...yes, she's still sitting there, not moving, just staring.

Something's wrong inside, and I don't know how to fix any of this, how it all works.  They told me I'd find out, but I've been thrown in an ocean of chaos and I'm drowning.  I've felt the Power.  It touched me tonight and wakened me.  Yesterday it gave me the strength to work after I felt I'd nothing left, borne on the wings of black men's songs.  I wonder if faiths aren't made so as to fill the hole of what's wanting - the wild and free faeries for my crushed and subjugated people, the Christian love and forgiveness for those that can't even love and forgive them as believe in the same god, the vast comfort of the faith of slaves and sons of slaves.

Is anything true?  Have I not one solid place to stand?  Are there as many gods as men?  

I prayed tonight.  I've got out of the habit, somehow - praying in church is rote enough that I get pulled back into my own head and explore some other world behind my eyes.  I wish I knew the rituals.  Not knowing who best to ask, I prayed to Danu the Mother to ease Eileen's journey of becoming.  Just seemed the thing to do, somehow."

Of course, the freezing might be due to standing in the icy waters of the harbour for nine cursed hours today.  My hands are screaming for rest and I'm nodding off from one word to the next but I can't stop writing.  I promised.  And even if I hadn't sworn it'd make no difference.  ""The unexamined life is not worth living.""  Who said that?  Socrates?  One of those Greeks, anyhow, I can never tell them apart.  Declan'd have my hide for that.  Whoever he truly is.

The introduction to the Order was not as I expected.  Not sure if that'd be from too many penny dreadfuls in Galway or that trip to Breaghwy, but I'd been thinking it would be a sight more gothic, with robes and bonfires and athames and all.  I can't bring myself to accept a secret society that worries about St. Patrick's Day cakes months ahead of time.  Now that I think on it, though, I remember something Katherine mentioned in passing - that we were being brought into the first circle of the Order.  Which leads me to believe that there's other circles - god only knows how many.  Could be that the Order we now know is only a cat's paw for something greater.  Could be I'm getting a bit too romantic for my own damn good.

I'm getting a wee bit itchy.  We've done naught since arriving but make do.  And that's something, no question - there's them as don't make do, and they're on the streets or worse now.  But I can't keep my thoughts from straying to what's next, what's beyond the horizon.  Am I merely to be a fishmonger?  That's not what my kin back home paid their blood for.  I do feel something taking shape within me.  I've not the slightest idea what to do with it when it's done, but that's something to worry about another day.

"event","Forgive the sloppy writing.  Have had considerable to drink, and I think I'm right entitled.  I've been through hell and back this evening, and I do not mean that figuratively.  I have seen hell.  It lies in my own heart, treacherous organ it's proven itself, time and again.  I have despaired.  Damn my eyes, I gave up tonight.

It's been an odd time, sure enough.  I've not dwelt much on Mum, but I believe that's due to my dwelling on little else for the entire voyage here.  Packed in tight, ankle deep in piss and vomit, it's hard not to take an account of one's life and think of what may've been.  The Mays that may have been.  And what the Mays may yet be.  Hell with it.  If Shakespeare can pun then so might I.  Rabbit seems sure Mum will find Da.  I believe her.  Rabbit sees things so much more than I.  I'm frightened of what that lass will become, sometimes, when I let myself dwell on it.

We've arrived in America to find slammed doors and snotty salesmen.  No one is pleased to see the Irish, it seems, and I wonder what it ever was we did to warrant such hatred.  We might as well be Jews.  We'd been living off the church since our arrival and I admit to a wee bit of guilt over it - we've some money, which is a sight more than most here.  But if we can't support ourselves there's no use for forty-odd dollars; may as well drink it away and spend it on fancy hats.  Then the fateful confession, Rabbit's first.

I fretted, I'll admit - downtown Brooklyn doesn't seem right for a witch-burning somehow, but there's a first time for everything, sure enough.  But it came and went, and then it was my turn, and the Father told me to speak to Sister Margaret of the Hibernians.  Funny that.  So we were taken to a secret chamber deep beneath the bowels of the church and told of a secret order, one that apparently looks out for us errant sons and daughters of Eire.  We were given a package to take to some actor in the Bowery.  The bastards could have told us to expect trouble.  Seemed simple enough.  That should've warned me right there.  Nothing's ever simple for our family nor for our kind, is it?

Policemen followed us.  Two of them.  We split up, hoping to lose them, and I was caught.  Too easily, I was caught.  I was caught and I was beaten down, but that's not what shamed me.  I brought forth every impulse of my heart, I called upon the memory of my father to give me strength, I even prayed, and nothing availed nor aided me, and I failed, but that is not what shamed me.  I gave up.  We beat starvation and death at every turn, and all it took was the same old oppressor in a different-coloured uniform with a knee on my back to break me, just for an instant, and I don't know if I only thought it or said it out loud...but my heart said it:  'There's nothing I can do'.

And then, salvation, in the form of Father Declan.  Who has now been an English priest, a starving Irishman, and a stately native New Yorker with a fine top hat and waxed mustachio.  Unlike many people of my acquaintance, I cannot explain away the eldritch when it smacks me in the face; though I fear I am descending into madness, I know what it was that I saw.  He laid a weir on that policeman, a curse that buckled his knees and undid his tendons, and gave me back the Hibernian package as nice as you please.  And then left me alone in the rat's alley where the dead men lost their bones, alone with the helpless copper, and me with three keen knives strapped to my sides.

Part of me thinks that what happened next should stay between myself, the policeman, and god.  But it's fitting I remember.  I exulted in his weakness.  He was every redcoat in that instant, every landlord, every bloody proper gentleman with a stick up his arse that won't hire Irish.  I could already feel his hot, hot blood flowing over my hands.  I don't know what my face looked like in that instant, but the cop's eyes went wide and he blurted, 'I have a daughter'.  I think those words saved him.  Me too, most like.  I wonder, now, if he was lying to me...not that it makes a difference, truly.  The man invoked family.  I will not cross that boundary.

I pushed his face down in the mud.  I made him tell me with knife and word who sent him after us, but I did not harm him, just in case he told true.  But I told him this:  'And how does it feel to be the one face down in the muck with a knee on your back and a knife at your throat?  You know all about our kind, do you?  Well, now I know all about you.  I'd be careful, if I were you, about who I take orders from in the future.  Now get up and go home to your daughter - if you even have one'.

Proud speech.  You'd almost think I wasn't furiously trying to keep my dinner down.  The package got delivered, my sisters made it back safe, all's well, I may as well sing a fecking ballad and do a little jig.  But my soul, it's not right.  I'm in turmoil.  I'm on the cusp of something, I feel it.  I felt it in the alley.  Something in me.  The glow, the spark, like that old woman in Galway said.  Something...something powerful.  I'll master it.  I will.  And I shall never, never, never, never despair again.  I swear it by my father's name and my own blood.

Rather more than is safe; however if Mays' statements regarding his inebriated state are accurate, it is likely that the anti-coagulating properties of alcohol combined with a certain loss of manual dexterity would lead to such a volume.]"

"event","America is not what I thought it'd be.  Not that I had the slightest notion.  These past weeks - months, years - it's hard to look ahead.  When you're starving, and then again when you're theiving, you live moment by moment.  Some last an eternity.

Trip was horrid.  Must remember to stop thinking I know all there is to know about squalor - if I had to smell the stench of illness and shite in the workhouse, well, that's better than sleeping in it, now isn't it?  It was two days ago we came on land and already the voyage seems a feverish dream, half remembered.  My sisters were so strong.  I worried after Siobhan, plague was no small matter on the ship, but she made it through well enough.  She's not well, mind, but then again I doubt she ever will be.  Darcy Worthington.  If I ever get my hands on you, you poxy son of a whorehopper...

I've just realized that I never learnt the name of the ship that brought us here.  Wish I had.  Like forgetting the name of your mother - we were cooped up in the dark and wet for weeks, and then spewed out into the bright world in a great nasty flood.  Like being born again.  Mother.  I knew she was going to do it, I just knew.  Why didn't I say anything?  Ah, I hoped I was wrong, I suppose.  And there's iron in that lady.  No point worrying my sisters, I suppose.  

I wonder where Ian is now.  I wonder if he'd be proud.  Sometimes I can almost feel him looking over my shoulder, grinning in that bemused way of his.  If things were different...aye, there's the rub, I suppose.

More later.  Hands cramping - Rabbit's birthday present almost finished."

She laughs.  Starvation and plague walk the land
As gaunt dogs red-coated, no hope, no soul;
And yet my bonnie Britt laughs on the strand
Which winds its weary way to workhouse hole.
Her shining copper tresses hail the sun,
Her eyes, the grey of storm-wracked seas, then shine.
A savagery to my traitor heart done,
Grievous and precious, horrid and fine

Is what you have done to me:
For a moment I had thee - 
For an instant I was free."

"event","Happy sixteenth birthday, then, Will.  

It's been a strange time.  Understatement, that.  Our lot got worse and worse, and then a miracle happened.  

That blasted old cow Worthington evicted us.  Turned us out without a by-your-leave, after Siobhan sacrificed her health on the altar of those two Formorians she calls sons, after not paying my sister the wages she's due and making her walk, alone, in this day and age, from Castlebar home to Shannen.  Foul, inconstant woman.  An hour alone with her and her get and a thumb press, and I'd be a happy man indeed.

We walked the road to Castlebar, taking with us only what we could carry.  Siobhan came the closest to thawing I've seen her for some time when we had to leave her hope chest behind.  Don't rightly know what the fuss is, it's been empty for well on a year now.  Don't rightly know who'd marry the battle-axe anyhow.  Ah, now, that was uncharitable of me - she's some unusual talents, as I've found, and she's not without kindness.  And she's to thank for the one stroke of luck we've had since Seamus was took.  I'll be sure to do penance for that thought later.

The workhouses in Castlebar were full so we had to make our way to Galway.  The air's different in a port town...not just the smell nor the wet.  It's the way the waves crash just outside your hearing day and night, and the sea-borne wind tugs at your sleeve like an eager child, as though to say, ""Come, come - there's something wondrous just beyond the horizon!""  'Course, it's only this past little while I've had time or vigor for such reflection.  The workhouse is all I ever need to know of hell.  Hell's not firey - it's grey.  It's cold, and it's hunger, and the smell of shite and pus every way you turn, and the same round of drudgery every day.  And then one day Siobhan of all of us found a way out.  She happened upon the Worthington's cook in the food line and was delivered to a secret kitchen in the heart of Galway, and to which she's brought us.

And here we've been since, under the rule of Finnis the robber-king and his man Toby, the duke of thieves, thugs and ne'er-do-wells.  I've taken a shine to the two of them - Finnis for his politics and Toby for his blessed malice.  Warms my heart to hear someone curse the Queen out loud, it does.  My sisters have proven themselves an able pair of footpads - Siobhan knows the secret places of the homes of the rich, and Rabbit is quicker than her namesake.  I'm able enough myself, I suppose.  My heart's not really in it.  Time was I'd be all a-tingle at the chance to dare all and win through.  And earning real, rich food is no small matter.  But what have we gained, truly?  We're not to steal anything we're not told to, and all we take goes to our patron.  If we kept the lucre from even one of our family outings we'd be in a good situation for years.  We have clothes on our backs and meat in our bellies, and that's riches sure enough, but - I want more, by all that's holy.  If I had a halfpenny for every library I've seen this year that those fattened bastards keep - for decoration, mind, not for the knowledge locked away within...I want those books.  I want them so badly I shake now when I walk into one of those places.  I want to talk to - no, I shouldn't name that desire.

Ah, be damned with it.  If a man can't dream on his birthday, when can he?  I've seen Britt.  Bonnie Britt McGee, from home.  I haven't the words for how seeing her undoes me.  I...ah, I could go on, but I'm not in the mood to be sticking daggers in my own heart just now.  I love her and I can't ever speak to her, for I would tell her everything and I can't.  I have to keep my family safe.

Damn it."

"event","I feel a right coward just now.  I know in my heart of hearts that there wasn't anything to do about what happened to Seamus, but still.  Reason'll say what it will, but Passion has its own ways.  They trooped into our house, the fecking dogs, looking for ""the traitor James May"".  And then they took Seamus away, to torture and death, I don't doubt.  I keep thinking, had I been more clever, more brave, I could have said something to stop them taking him.  Done something.  I should at least have said somthing in Dad's defence - branded a traitor to a throne he never swore to serve.  Well.  Not that I know of.  Old Dad's history seems to be a wee bit more of a tangled skein than I ever gave him credit for.

We'll survive somehow, that I know.  We've come too far not to.  But I fear greatly.  I'm sure it's a sin on my head to be fretting about the food he brought in while the poor man's languishing in a cell, or dead already, for all I know.  But my life is not my own.  He gave himself that we might live, and I mean to honor that.  I have to worry about right here, right now, and keep the breath in my family.  Somehow."

"event","I'd near forgotten this thing existed.  Haven't had a lot to say, mind - I find when I'm writing away I tend to get a little more introspective and cynical than I like, and I can ill afford that sort of thought these days.  Last harvest was totally ruined, every potato rotted to the core still in the earth.  Wasn't just us, turned out.  Everywhere.  At least, everywhere that matters.  I hear they've taken to calling it the Great Famine.  High and mighty words, I suppose, but accurate enough.  I've seen hale and hearty men turn to sniveling starvelings before my very eyes, these dark months.  Lucky for me I didn't have any bulk to miss.  It's got bad enough that a grown man will attack a child for food, and then you have to shoot him in the belly and run away, never knowing if he's dead or not.  Beginning to repeat on me, that is.  Not knowing whether men of my aquaintance are dead or not.  It's starting to haunt me a little, I think.

It's real.  All of it.  Begging the question of what is real, exactly, ha ha.  Apparently the unreal can be real and start asking for my life.  Walking into a glade and coming out of a forest?  Faerie tales.  

Well, yes.  Exactly.

I don't know that I'll ever find out what my father was up to all those years.  Mum or Seamus either, come to that.  I almost don't want to know.  But I said that I did, didn't I.  Well, come to that, I'd like to know what's going on but I'd rather not be dragged screaming into it like I was.  It's not the same.  I wanted to know, not get involved.  I know only enough of their ways to get me killed or worse.  Straddling two worlds, I am.  Like the Colossus.  I have to somehow be a bridge between the world that Siobhan lives in and the one that Rabbit lives in and I'm torn in two.  

God, I'd take the cup from her lips if it were allowed me.  She's too young for this.  Come to that, I'm too young for this.  I think I'm getting old before my time, me.  A weeklong trip, no, a fecking quest, and I shot a man, and I kept us safe and dry from the Church to the Circle and back again, and does anyone thank me?  Does anyone tell me I've done well to get myself and Rabbit there and back again with body and soul still knit together?  Didn't I do right?

I sound ungrateful.  Maybe I am at that.  It's that old man got me thinking about such things.  I told that man more about myself and made more wishes in his hearing than is wise on a journey like that what I was on.  Ah, now I'm just jumping at shadows.  Half mad with fatigue, most like.  The world will make more sense in the morning.  And if it doesn't, well...at least time will be steadily taking me further away from three days ago."

"event","Siobhan is not well.  Nothing is well.  I have failed my father's last task and I have failed my family.  And the worst of it is that I've not the slightest clue of what I might've done different.

Ian and I got back yesterday.  Our barn was full of English horses and our kitchen was full of English asses, strutting about like they owned the bloody place.  Asked me some questions and left.  It was then I heard the coughing from the bedroom, saw that Rabbit was shaking with rage and Mum had more creases on her forehead than a few muddy footprints could rightly account for.  I went, I looked.  Half Siohan's face is swollen up to twice it's usual size.  Didn't sound quite in her right mind.  I think that's what gave me most pause.  Siohan's always in her right mind, come hell or high waters.  She told me she was kicked by a horse.  She must think I'm a feckin' idiot.

'Course, I suppose I am an idiot for trying to feed the same line to Ian.  He went into one of his silences.  That worried me.  Ian's not a quick nor a practiced hand at thinking, but when he does you can almost hear the gears grinding together.  Slow and thorough and powerful.  Rabbit told me to my face that Siobhan was lying.  I just told her that I knew and we'd talk about it later.

This morning Ian wasn't in his bed, and an English is dead, hung by the neck and bound with holly.  

I cannot be thinking what I'm thinking.  It's not sane and it's not right but it is what it is and what am I supposed to do now?  I couldn't feed us all with Ian's help and now he's gone.  I know he's not coming back.  I know it.  I feel it in my waters, whatever he's done (or had done to him, but I won't, I am not thinking that) there's no coming back from."

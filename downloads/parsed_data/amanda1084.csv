I've been working 6 days a week (one of those days is a double) plus I've been teaching 3 days a week on top of that. It's kind of exhausting, but I hate to waste my time doing nothing since I am not in school. I guess working a lot is the best thing for me to do right now. I might write more later."

I just finished putting up my Christmas tree I decorated it and everything. I had to re-arrange my entire living room to fit it in here. I have so much shit though! My house is a freakin wreck right now. I just started Christmas shopping the other day. Holly & I went to the mall and I got some gifts. I am trying to cut down this year because I cannot afford to go all out and buy a ton of gifts and stuff. My bills are too much and I am trying to save as much as possible so I can hopefully go back to school in Jan. So hopefully I can try to not spend as much on Christmas this year.

Anyways....I don't feel like typing anymore. I will make an important update someday. Maybe."

"event","Yes, it's true. I touched Taylor Hanson's hand. So did Ali. OMG lol. So here is what happened. We left my house on Sunday morning, it took a little over 3 hours to get there (Washington, DC). The doors didn't open until 7:30 so we sat out on the ghetto street corner for like 6 hours or more. The show was sold out. It was cool because most of the people there were girls our age, like girls that have been fans since back in the day. It was cool. We met this girl and her boyfriend in line behind us so we talked to them all day. Anyway then we get inside. Both of the opening bands were awesome. The guitar player from one of them threw me his guitar pick, which was really cool. Then Hanson comes on and it is like bitchfest 2005 because all these hoes are pushing (yeah we were too lol) trying to get to the front. We were second row. Yes SECOND FUCKING ROW, standing up. There was one row of bitches in front of us, and they were the ones that slept outside overnight. So we are like so excited and we end up touching Taylor's hand, which was greasy but still fucking awesome. I am going to put all the pics up on my photobucket later so be sure to look at them. The show was so awesome, they did a really good job. Of course, like always. We were a little dissapointed because Zac was a little bit of a prick. Like he wasn't waving, smiling, or interacting with the crowd at all. Taylor was totally like into the crowd which was cool. They are all 3 so fucking hot now (YES EVEN IKE LOL). Then at the end Zac GIVES BOTH DRUMSTICKS TO ONE FUCKING BITCH. She was like right next to us. He should have thrown them so two people could have them, or he could have just handed them both to me and Ali lol. I was like OMG I'll give you $20 for one drumstick, and Ali is like OMG I'll give you $40. Anyways the bitch didn't sell them to us. There is so much more I could write about but I know most of my friends don't really care, and I am kinda tired of writing now. It was just a really awesome experience. Ali and I had the best time it was fun. I am glad we got to experience Hanson together again, it was the best. So yeah. BTW did I mention I totally touched Taylor's hand? OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I got home last night and I as happy to see my electricity was back on. Thank god. A lot of people still don't have electricity or heat. I heard they won't have everyones back on til Friday. The high school was turned into a temporary shelter and I heard they were housing some other people at the elementary school also. I hope they get everything in order soon. My dad still has no electricity (or heat) so the kids cannot even stay with him. He wasn't too happy about that.

Poor Rose didn't even get to go to bed because she had to go to work. *Note to Holly-Doug just left a few minutes ago, he came to work with me lol*. He seems like a really cool guy. I'm going out again on Thursday so I can't wait. OMG I got so fucking pissed off earlier. I went out to put a food order in for myself, and that fucking haggity old fugly bitch Jill was out there eating. Let me remind you that she DOESN'T FUCKING WORK HERE ANYMORE, she was fired. Well she made one of the waitresses come over and tell me that they were to wait on pub tables if there were any. I was like um this is for me. Anways if I wanted to I could wait on pub tables because everyone else can. I was like umm that fucking whorebag doesn't work here anymore, she cannot tell me what to do. I was so fucking pissed I was ready to kick her old saggy ass. For real, she is just jealous because I am not an old bitch and she is mad I helped get her fired.

I played the machines a little bit at work. I lost of course so I stopped. People throw a lot of money away. I watched people put hundreds of dollars in them today, and the bad thing is we weren't even busy. It's crazy.

I am excited for Friday. We are gonna have one hell of a good time let me tell you!

Holly got me some really nice birthday presents. She got me a fairy (I collect!), a fairy picture that's framed, a fairy bookmark, a candle set thing for my coffee table, and these two votives with holders. Cute cute stuff. She got me so much stuff I was like god did you buy out the whole store lol. It was really sweet of her though. My relatives all called and told me Happy Birthday, and so did Ali:) It was nice. My boss sent me flowers and they are really nice. She sent them from Robbie to be nice I guess lol but I know they were her idea not his. It was nice of her though. I am gonna get off of here.

This job is going to be easy, I just have to learn to deal with my teaching job, which is a freaking nightmare. I was going to see Steve tonight but I guess he's been sick all day so I don't know. I will only see him like once or twice a week now probably. I told him it's not like we got to see each other much before anyways. Oh well.

I've already told most of my customers I like that I'm leaving, and I hate most of the rest of them lol.

Oh well I am going to be happier making more money and not being miserable. I hope I like this job better, I really think I will. My mom and Brian came down a little while ago, they bought me a tv for my birthday. It's really nice so I was happy about that. I couldn't believe they bought me something that expensive. They got me a whole freaking cheesecake too. Yummy Yum I love cheesecake. Now I can put my huge tv back in the living room and be normal lol. OMG guess what I did today. I was supposed to be at work at 5:00, and I guess I was tired from getting up early to teach this morning or something. So anway, I fell asleep and I woke up at like 5:30! I didn't mean to fall asleep. So I got up and got to work really quick, but I was still like 45 minutes later. I tried calling them to tell them I was coming and they didn't even answer the phone.

I just called my dad since we haven't talked for like a few weeks. Sonya had already told him about my new job so I didn't really have to. I just talked to him and explained why I am taking it and how its going to be better for me in the long run. He didn't seem mad at all thank god. I was really worried. I am glad I have everything off my chest now. I was worried about telling work I'm quitting and telling my dad. It feels good to get things out of the way lol.

He has like a real teacher who assigns the work and makes lesson plans, but his mom is the ""teacher"" that like makes him do the actual schoolwork. She wanted me to do it 3 days a week because it was too much for her I guess. She is going to be paying me really decent for it too so I was like sure. So now I kinda got two new jobs in one. I told her it's just until I go back to school anyways and then we'll see where it goes. 

I went to see my sister today. It was a nice visit. I felt really good about going because I hardly know her and she is already 12. I am glad her mom invited me. We all just sat out on the porch and talked all day, so it was a nice trip. I'll probably put a few pictures I took up later.

I am kinda pissed off because I was supposed to go see Jatanna afterwards since she lives between my sister's house and here. Well I called her and left her a voicemail and I text messaged her with no answer. I stopped by her house and she wasn't there. I was like whatever it's late and I'm tired so I'm just going home. She still hasn't freaking called me. I guess it's not that big of a deal, but I told her I was planning on coming over and she seemed to really want me to. That's ok, I am not going over later this week when she wants me to. I think it's just rude to not even let me know if she had something else to do and blow me off.

I got a phone call from my half sister Chanda's mom today. They want me to come see them because they live like 20 minutes away from me now. It was kind of nice because I've wanted to see her for awhile, things are just awkward. Hopefully everthing will work out.

We were so damn busy at work, I didn't get out of there until about 11:30 or so. I hate working 2-11 and shit every single day, especially when you are there alone or with only one other person. It's fucking exhausting. I haven't told anyone about this yet, because it's not 100% sure, but I am planning on getting a new job on my birthday. I am going to work in the Lounge/Pubs in town that my old boss, my mom's boyfriend's mom (make sense?), owns. They pay you $7/hour plus you make tips. My mom told me she has made more tips there than waitressing before. You just sit on your ass, get people drinks, and cash in their gambling slips. It's easy, stress free, and pays decent. I think I am going to do that so when I go back to school I will have a job that allows me time to get my homework done too. I'll have internet access and everything, so I will have plenty of time to do that stuff. I am not thrilled to be working in a place that allows smoking, drinking, and gambling, but I am trying to work hard now so I finish college. I think this is what I should do for now, temporarily until I finish school.

I like coming home to a clean house, so tonight when I get off work I'll be happy. I even made my freaking bed lol. I'm happy because I get the next two days off, if I can just make it through tonight I'll be alright. I get to see Steve tonight so I'm happy about that. I stayed with him two nights ago but when I got there it was like after 11:00. I took a shower, ate, and then I fell asleep. I felt bad because I wanted to actually spend time with him but I was so exhausted. I am gonna go get ready for work. I never have anything really intersting to say on here, my journal sucks lol."

"event","is so fucking annoying. She woke me up this morning, it was like 10:00, but I work late and I wanted to sleep in dammit! She goes ""oh did I wake you up?"" and I was like ""yes you did"", and then she says ""can you run me to Dairy Mart to get some cigs?"" I was like no I am sleeping I've been working long hours, I'm tired. I told her I'd come over when I get up. Well I got mad because I couldn't fall back asleep, so I never took her lol. My mom came and got me and we went to a few yard sales. Everything sucked though and we didn't buy anything. When I came home she was outside talking to some guy, and I was like ""do you still need to go to the store?"", and she was like no. LOL I am a bitch and I don't really care. She could have walked to Dairy Mart, and her bad habit isn't my responsibility. I hate people. She needs to get a fucking job and leave me alone."

Steve bought it for me), a purse from Hot Topic....and I think that's all. We also ate at Applebee's, it was good! I will write a better entry tomarrow maybe...I am gonna go bug Steve:) 

Here is my fairy, I got the last one they had, and it is sold out on the website. I am glad I picked it!

"event","LOL. Seriously, I went to the grocery store today, and I got to eat real food when I got off work lol. I am so excited to eat food, that's kinda sad! I didn't get off work til like almost midnight, but I actually wasn't pissed for once. I liked the people I worked with tonight, so that must be it. I get to work 11-4 tomarrow, so I will actually get to spend some time with my boyfriend tomarrow:) I never get to see him anymore, I haven't seen him for like 3 or 4 days I think. I miss him:( I can't complain though, because at least I do get to see him. I know some people (like Ali) don't get to see their husband/boyfriend for a lot longer than that. When I start missing spending time with Steve, I just think at least I get to see him soon. It would be hard to be apart for a long period of time. I know Ali is a strong person and she will be ok, but I feel awful that she won't see Kevin for so long. At least she has precious little Alenya to keep her company though. I wish I lived closer so I could watch her grow up, she is the cutest little god baby ever! I am going to go check my email and then talk politics with Ali;) lol. Bye!"

They are just rude assholes when you try to help them out. Plus they ripped me off on my paycheck, my boss is a fucking whorebag. Whatever though. I need to go grocery shopping. The only things I have in my fridge are water, tea, and slimfast lol. I need to defintely go to the store today before work.

I've been watching the news and reading it online, trying to keep up a little with what is going on dealing with the hurricane. It's so terrible. I don't even know how to feel about everything. It makes me a little more thankful that's for sure. I don't know, it's just a terrible situation. I read this letter that Michael Moore (so weird, that is my uncles name!) wrote to the president, and it was so gay. http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php
I hate M.Moore, he's a jackass. I mean he made a few good points, but what is with him wasting time dissing on the president, when he isn't out there doing jack shit either. He needs to put his time and energy into something a little more productive if you ask me. He is all talk and no action. He needs to shut his ugly face up. 

I am gonna go take a shower. Bye!"

It looks like a good deal, a camera and a printer for just $199! I don't know much anout digital cameras though, so if anyone does let me know. Steve thinks the camera is a piece of junk and that is why it's so cheap for the camera and printer. I think it looks nice though. Look at it and tell me. If you think it's crappy tell me before I make him get it for my b-day present ok lol."

"event","Here is how my day went. My mom called me this morning because she needed me to take her to the doctor. She has been having really bad problems with her varicose(sp?) veins in her legs. She has already went to the doctor twice this week about them because her legs have been hurting her. This morning her and my brother got in an argument and he ended up kicking her. When he kicked her (IN THE LEG) it made her vein pop and her leg swell up. All day she hasn't been able to walk at all. I felt really bad for her and the doctor was being a bitch and didn't really do a damn thing for her. I ended up going up to mom's all day to help her because she couldn't even move. I did laundry, cleaned her house, picked up the kids off the bus, and then I cooked dinner and took Sonya to Bridgeport for awhile. After all that I just got home not too long ago and now I am dead tired. 

I am dreading going to work tomarrow. I am going to go see about another job either tomarrow or the next day. I have to do something because I cannot live my life being miserable at least 5 out of 7 days a week you know. 

Yesterday when we were visiting the twin babies my grandma ended up getting in a wreck. Some pregnant girl hit her car really hard. I guess everyone is okay but grandma had to go to the doctor, I guess she was having back/neck pains. She wasn't going to go but the cop told her she should. 

CRAZINESS! I just want to sleep now."

Yesterday we went up to see the babies. They are soooo cute!!! They are so tiny too. It was nice visiting with everyone, but we did get stuck there forever because my uncle wanted me to help him on his computer. I was getting pissed off because it was getting late and I wanted to leave.

Did I ever post that my aunt had her babies? I couldn't remember if I had or not. Anyways she had them like on Wed. morning I think. They are twin boys, Colin and Liam are their names (I am pretty sure anyways). I still haven't gotten to see them because I've been at work! Hopefully I will see them on Monday or Tuesday since those are my days off:) Can't freaking wait for that.

When I got home from work tonight I took a shower, and as I was getting out there was a huge ass fucking spider on the shower curtain. I freaked out and screamed. Then I sprayed the fuck out of it with bug killer, so now my bathroom has that shit everywhere and it reeks. I had to end up smashing the bitch because that stuff didn't even kill it. I need to go clean it up but I don't want to! I'm getting some sleep now. Night!"

I am happy because I got to stay with him the past 2 nights in a row. I hate not getting to spend much time with him, but I guess that's just life so I should get used to it. I love him so much, I cannot believe we have been dating for for almost 4 1/2 years. That is a long time! 

I had a long day at work. I am so tired of work it's not even funny. I need to stop complaining and do something about it though. I just want to get my life in order and figure everything out. I don't know what I'm going to do. I need to go read Ali and Holly's journals and then go to bed soon.

We took a baggie and filled it up with the following things: whipped cream, water, ketchup, mustard, egg, chocolate powder, chocolate syrup, syrup, pickle, pickle juice, mixed nuts, can of tuna, butter, and mayo. Then we put it on her car HAHAHA. We are so funny.

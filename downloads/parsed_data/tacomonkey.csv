Lydia Ophelia Eleanor Williams was born at 8:15pm on Monday 25th August, 3.8kgs & 50.5cm long.

She's one month old now.

She's incredible - the whole experience is incredible. And hard - it's really hard fucking work. I want to write EVERYTHING down but it's SO difficult to find the time and the hands. I spend a lot of time staring at her in awe and marveling. I don't want to forget anything about this, about her - it's absolutely breathtaking."

"event","I'm 28 weeks along now - I assume we all knew that when I said ""I'll keep this updated"" three months ago it was pretty much bullshit.

If I thought pregnancy was weird at 13 weeks, it's nothing compared to pregnancy now. I have a pronounced bump - I have trouble seeing it, but people offer me a seat on the bus now - and the noob kicks away at all kinds of hours, which is very reassuring. Of all the benefits of pregnancy (foot rubs on demand, people bring you tea, you get to sit down all the time etc) I think I'll miss the kicking the most.

Bump is a girl bump! I'm not sure if it matters, but I'm pleased nonetheless; Hamish REALLY wanted us to have a girl and now wants us to call her Alice (we're not) and Kieran can wave to the bump and say ""Hello baby! Baby sister!"" which is unspeakably adorable. Names are still being debated.

I feel.. good. Really well, actually - coping excellently mentally sans medication and physically okay, although I have a mildish case of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphysis_pubis_dysfunction"">SPD</a>. I'm getting to the point where I can't bend too much, I bump in to things a lot and I really don't remember what my feet look like, but I don't mind. Without being too ridiculous about it, I'm content and life is glorious."

* The scans are all really positive
* I'm starting to feel better
* <lj user=""aeduna"" /> has been a total superstar (best babydaddy ever)
* Liz has been totally supportive and awesome
* Yes we're all still living together, everyone in the situation is happy and healthy and not being inducted into a weird poly cult (unless Tim has nefarious plans)
* The boys know they're getting a sibling and are pretty stoked - no, we're not going into the whole 'half sibling' thing with them
* Hamish will be turning 6 just after the noob arrives, Kieran will be 2.5
* Yes it was planned, you asshole
* I'm due mid-August
* I'll try and keep this updated as I go along
* I am really, really happy :)"

"event","Every time I think about posting to livejournal I think ""I have to catch up on the last X years"" and the larger X becomes the more intimidating it is. 

Here's a brief overview of the last several years:
Went from living on my own to sharehousing a lot (noteable mentions include <lj user=""bloodied_angel7"" />, <lj user=""rhyannonf"" />, <lj user=""cheshire_bitten"" />, <lj user=""muizarts"" /> and <lj user=""anodynos"" /> as Housemates Willing To Put Up With My Shit).

Casually dating <lj user=""aeduna"" /> (amongst others, at various times, to very little drama and fanfare - being grownup is best) turned into something considerably more serious and now, almost 6 years in, I live with him - and Liz and their progeny (Hamish, who is 5, and Kieran, who is nearly 2) plus <lj user=""bjj_moves"" />. I don't know how I ended up in a long term poly thing that involves kids and pets and commitment, but actually it's pretty much the awesomest thing ever.

Still working for Big University, but most of the stress in my life in the last few years has been work related - badly done centralization, constant management turnover, massive redundancies, getting moved to a different office way further from home to do a job I was in no way qualified for with a boss who blatantly had a problem with the genitalia I possess. It all came crashing down at the end of last year and then totally turned around right at the last minute - offered a new position that I love, doing work that I enjoy and am good at, with people I really like. I'm sitting at my fancy window desk in my 9th floor office feeling smug right now.

My mental health has been really up and down the last couple of years - I've been at my best and worst at various points. I got a Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis a few years ago and struggled with it, but therapy and medication and growing up have taught me that I need to work with my illness instead of fighting it all the time in order to get anywhere. I am trying to forgive more easily (myself and others). I still have my bad days, but I definitely have more good now.

Life is good. Really good, in fact. It can be boring and exciting and tiring and domestic and tedious and hard and fun and I'm still crazy and I'm still figuring out who I am. But.. I am happy."

I feel flat. Flat like a pancake, flat like a cartoon character. The med cocktail makes me tired, so tired, all the time, tired to the bone, like having the flu. I can't go out - I'm effectively housebound because I can't do anything but sleep constantly. I feel like I am getting smaller every day which would be quite a feat given the amount of sugar I am putting into my body on a daily basis. I feel so far removed from everything. I'm aware of my emotions - anger, mostly, white hot like a flame in my stomach, and desperate loneliness that makes my heart beat like a drum - but I don't feel attached to them, I feel like they are happening to somebody else. I cry a lot. I drift away. I can't see the horizon from here.

I wonder if it's possible to get so sad you just disappear."

"event","I have yet to come up with a suitable metaphor for borderline personality disorder, but it's a bit like this: you're stuck on a rollercoaster in the dark and you can't get off. Sometimes it's alright, smooth sailing even, but even when things seem calm there's still that knot of tension preparing for the next big thing. Anything can set it off, anything at all - a sideways glance from a stranger, a careless word from a friend, something on the news or in a song, a painful train of thought. And then you're hurtling screaming up into the stratosphere of hysteria or dropping helplessly into the depths of depression. Your logical brain knows that it has to end, that the climb and the dive cannot go on forever, but when you're caught up in those stomach dropping moments (and they last from minutes to months) you can't think logic - you can only grip tight and try to keep the air moving through your lungs and hope that this isn't the time you go careening right off the rails. Even in the flat bits you can never really relax, never let your guard down, never let go of the fear and panic and anxiety because around the next corner could hold something that tears you apart. Everything feels like the end of the world, all the time.

I'm so sick of the medication, trying to get it right with the drugs that keep me from being totally psychotic that could also send me totally psychotic. The nausea, the weight gain, the brain zaps and dizzy spells and mood swings, the dangerous fevers and tremors. I'm tired of being sick, I'm tired all the time. I hate that I feel like I am made of stone sometimes, an impenetrable fortress that feels no blows and sheds no light, and yet I am so fragile that I could shatter with a harsh word or a light touch. I don't know anyone else like this and I don't understand why it has to be this way but 10 years of medication and therapy and I'm still stuck there in the dark on the endless rollercoaster of my own emotions.

I am a broken record. Just shut up and get better already!"

I'm not so big on attention and thus am relegated to the role as the Best Friend, the sidekick, the mother figure, the bit on the side. Honestly I don't mind so much but I wonder that when I die anyone will remember me, and what for? If I were prettier, smarter, more charming, less crazy then perhaps I would be.. more. Better. It's pointless to wish that I could change what already is, or who I am.

A slow slip-slide back into depression and agrophobia and feeling like I'm so crazy I might actually crawl out of my own skin, my baby sister screaming and crying on the other end of a phone while I debate having her put into a psych ward and later saying goodbye at the airport because I am too weak to care for the only person who loves me unconditionally (I miss her so much), a very frightening health scare for someone I care deeply about, a friend who drove from our house to a bottle of sleeping pills and isn't coming back, having my heart ripped out (oh, little miss drama!).

The problem with going out and having a <i>really good time</i> is that you suddenly remember how sad&boring&pathetic the rest of your life is. I am bored, really bored, bored enough to go out into the beautiful spring sunshine and take pictures of my cat/house/self/boobs*.

I had my final therapy session a few weeks ago. Not going is strange - scary but good, I need a break for a little while. I've made the fairly scary decision to come off my medication though, so I need to see a GP for that - no rush.

Erin is (obviously) back, has been for about a month now. It's been good; difficult but good.

Work is work - now that I'm over that first six months of learning how everything works, it's become easy but mind-numbingly boring. I am doing a lot of hours and yet somehow still struggling to make ends meet - why is this?? I also have a hideous crush on one of my co-workers, which is entirely inconvenient, because although we're great friends he's really gay.

I've been asked to do an Internet radio DJ spot for a game website I'm part of. Very awesome but also entirely nerve wrecking - if anyone on my flist (and I know a few of you DJ for actual money) want to give me any tips, please feel free; I am clueless.

So. I'll try and make an effort to actually update from now on. Promise.

<b>1. Your favorite song in the whole world, ever.</b>

Nine Inch Nails - Wish

<i>This is the first day of my last days
Built it up now take it apart
Climbed up real high now fall down real far
No need for me to stay
The last thing left I just threw it away
I put my faith in god and my trust in you
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do</i>

<b>2. The song you wish was about you.</b>

Alkaline Trio - Every Thug Needs A Lady

<i>I know it's dark here, you know that I'm scared too
For some reason right now, of everything but you
Right now you're all that I recognize
You know I came here when I needed your soft voice
I needed to hear something that sounded like an answer
Now I wait here, and sometimes I get one</i>

<b>3. The song that, you'll admit, is the most about you / you can relate to so much that it's just disturbing.</b>

Everclear - Amphetamine

<i>I met her at a party and I took her home
She is the saddest girl that I have ever known
Yeah, she wakes me up in the middle of the night
Just to tell me everything will be alright</i>

<b>4. The song that will make you crack a big smile no matter what.</b>

Cute Is What We Aim For - Sweet Talk 101

<i>The arch in your eyebrows
Can tell the truth
Just imagine what your back can do
And the dance floor where I do my best
Is your, your mattress

I just gave myself the shivers
And that's what you get when you think about her
And I just gave myself the shivers
And that's what you get, that's what you get</i>

<b>5. And finally, the song you listen to when you're feeling sad, not to liven you up but more make you feel better because someone out there knows what it's like.</b>

Snow Patrol - Ask Me How I Am

<i>Has nobody asked you how you are?
You look like you might not last the day
I wouldn't have made it very far
So we'd make a good team right away

I've not made amends for yesterday
My lip won't get me out of it
Waking up dreading hearing tales
Of all my nightmares being true</i>

From <a href=""http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=3530822107858494790"">Girl Anachronism</a> - ""And you can tell/ By the red in my eyes/ And the bruises on my thighs/ And the knots in my hair/ And the bathtub full of flies/ That i'm not right now at all/ There i go again pretending that I'll fall/ Don't call the doctors 'cause they've seen it all before/ They'll say just - let - her - crash - and - burn - she'll - learn - the attention just encourages her..""

Are we sensing a theme here?

14. Is there a song by 10 that makes you sad?
<a href=""http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=3530822107858488926"">Cause = Time</a> - ""You've got all and it's pretty good but I seem to be in disbelief..""

15. What is your favourite song of 1?

When i get my hands on them.. oh just you wait and you'll see...

""give me one reason to trust you"" she said, and i replied
""i can not for i have none"" and she cried,
""then give me your trust so that mine can return"" she said, and i replied
""i can not for i have none"" and i would have cried, but my eyes has dried.
""then share with me a starving need to hold on"" she said, and i replied
""i can not for i have none""
""what then? where do we place ourselves?""
""on the funeral pyre to burn."" and burn.

Reinventing moonlight for model lace. Hands touch faces and lips whisper simple phrases. So faithful, so sincere. Across the room stands a kind man who doesn't know my name, the kind man doesn't know my face. I wasn't plugged in today and I couldn't help thinking that, that meant something very profound.""

16. How did you become a fan of 10?
Holy hell, I've no idea. Random musical find, I guess?

Also right at the beginning of your 12 hour shift is NOT the time to come down with the plague. I got up at 8 yesterday, worked a 12-hour shift, walked an hour home 'cause the buses weren't running, got home at midnight and promptly couldn't sleep because my head is full of cotton wool and gross and insomnia. Someone come make me soup and drugs and pat my head, plz.

"event","We go out for dinner at a Japanese restaurant, decide to splurge on a little bit of everything because they offer a 'per head' meal for vegetarians.

We laugh at how all we're eating is vegetables and it all manages to be so unhealthy - tempura, cold blanched spinach with some kind of peanut-butter sauce - and eat the best godamn eggplant in the whole world.

I grin at the waitresses who are constantly refilling my water glass and asking if I would like another cocktail - I would, but I say no. I don't know what's in a <i>Tokyo Dawn</i>, but there's a lot of it, enough to make me feel fuzzy.

They bring us a huge pot over a gas burner, full of vegetables and broth and noodles, and he boasts that he can eat anything they put in front of us. We don't make it all the way through, though we make a gallant effort.

I wield my chopsticks with finesse the entire time and, at the end of the meal, I spill ice cream all down my front whilst eating pancakes with a knife and fork.

It's nice. It's hard to feel lonely with friends like these."

We got a package the other day to the wrong address, and I emailed the address on it to give it back - turns out it's the guy next door, only a little older than me, and we've taken to emailing each other at 1am. We haven't actually met yet though - it seems pretty unlikely that we will at all. My life is pretty weird sometimes.

Anyway. I'm sleepy.

I'm not doing well. I don't feel safe - from the world, from myself - but I don't want to go out either, I feel self-concious and nervous around everyone, and selfish and judged. There's a shadow-monster lurking just behind my left shoulder breathing on my neck. I hate this.

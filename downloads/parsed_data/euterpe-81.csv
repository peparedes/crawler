"event","I applied for a new job last week with the company. Took forever for HR to process my resume, still have yet to hear but that may not be a bad sign. Not sure yet. I at least want an interview.

I now work with chirren. Yep. I started working with the preschool worship team on Sunday mornings. I am not renowned for my super abilities with young homo sapiens --(or any homo sapiens for that matter, really)-- and am surprised by how fun I find it. My mother would die laughing right now if, you know, she wasn't already dead.  What? She'd find that funny. Shut up. 

I do miss that woman though. 

I don't feel yet like I want to bother with finding someone. Don't ask for what. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. And then some days that's ALL I want to do, along with eating ice cream sandwiches and watching SVU.  I don't know. I feel like I have to figure out who I am in relation to Mom now. I knew who I was in relation to her living. What am I regarding her memory? What about me is missing and what about me should fall into place soon? What about me might NOT fall into place? Ever? And what about him, the mysterious possibly non-existent Mr X? What of him, and what of his role in the life of a woman who lost her mother before she had a family of her own? There must be repercussions from that, surely. So what are they and how do I deal with them? Before or After Mr X? Can all repercussions BE dealt with before? I think, no, no they can't. So now what. 

I am just thinking out loud on paper (screen....keyboard?). It is nothing distressing, surprisingly; not in the least. I realize this won't make sense but it sometimes doesn't to me either so we can all be in the same boat. Hooray, a boat! It'll be fun, I promise."

"event","The world keeps spinning, and life keeps advancing.  Even your own little world, your own little planet you inhabit, keeps turning. Nothing can prevent or stop that. It just turns a little differently.

Things are different. But I can't lie and say they're horrible. I miss her like nothing else, but life keeps going and it has gone fairly well, or at least as well as it can go after this.  A month ago, if asked, I would have thought this would result in not eating, not sleeping, not being able to stop crying, complete non-function resulting in heavy medication or institutionalization. And I would not have been exaggerating. That is honestly how I felt this would affect me--how I KNEW it would affect me.  And yet....I sometimes last an entire 24 hours without crying, even if I think about it, and I sleep as well as I did before (which admittedly has never been very well), I didn't increase any dosage of any sort and I go to work, go to church, go see Dad, have dinner with friends....Life is the same, the glorious same, and yet so drastically different.  And I miss her. So much it hurts at times.  But it has yet to stop my world or to stop my life. I think this is what she would want to hear.

I don't understand this composure or strength I have been allotted. But if I understood it, would I have as much gratitude or reverence for it as I do now?"

It should be over by this weekend.

I'm terrified of life without her, but yet I know deep down she is miserable and in pain.  She's in and out of consciousness, and we think she's already spending most of her time somewhere else mentally. She says things that make no sense, when she can even formulate real words. 

My dad said last night that she had told  him she was ready to go.  We both told her today it was all right.  I told her today and she said ""OK, good.""

"event","Trying to determine who to vote for has really caused me to examine politics in general, and the purpose of the presidency.  It's neat to live in SC and feel an important part of the primaries in general.  It's sort of like the state is a lonely person and the candidates are contestants on our reality dating show.  

But I am sick of people not considering the grander picture.  OK, sure, as a Christian it would be great to have a Christian in office. But as the last few decades have shown prominently, Christians can be the most immoral people in the world, and frankly I think if an atheist ran and had the best plan for America, he would have my vote.

I'm sick of people using politics as a divisive strategy. I hate conservatives asserting that liberals are bad people.  And I hate liberals misrepresenting conservatives as hateful. Sure some of them are, but liberals can be too.  People wouldn't fall for this in any other arena; If I came up to you and said ""Person X is bad because they are Muslim/Christian/atheist"" or you came up to me and said ""Person Y is bad because they are black/white/Asian"" then you and I would be written off as racist hatemongers.  But yet all over the news, people are claiming ""So and So is a bad/dangerous person because they are conservative/liberal."" And we eat it up. No wonder politics is such a dirty game.  It's like the tabloid dirt-shoveling for the intellectual set.

Mainly I'm sick of special-interest groups. GLBT community, Evangelicals, single-soccer-moms, corporate fatcats.  Yes, your needs are important. But it's not a president for YOU. It's a president for the entire country, everyone who lives here, and frankly you are not the only person who has a say. You are also not the only person with valid opinions.  And what might be best for YOU, may seriously be a detriment to the other people in the country. And if everyone realized this, and voted for the good of the country, then perhaps we could rest assured knowing the president was chosen by the majority FOR the majority, rather than by the majority of a bunch of sects assuming they would have their way.

So while it's really great to find a candidate that agrees with YOU, perhaps what you should really be checking on is if what you want is what is best for the country, not whatever group or personal agenda you support.  I know that sounds a bit Communistic, almost, but you have a country to think about, and a chance to choose the best leader for that <i>country</i>. 
 People get to pick their own personal running mates/leaders all the time. It's called dating. So save that for the relationships and really figure out what this country needs to restore it to the nation it once was, not this laughingstock country no one will admit to speaking to."

You know what else is disappointing? I should have remembered that the Golden Globes and Oscars don't award previously existing music, so Sweeney Todd will not be nominated for Best Score.  Which is a travesty, really, but I suppose I'd rather see no award than a stupid ""new"" song just to make him eligible. (Hint: I'm looking right at you, ""Learn to Be Lonely"". And also at you, Andrew Lloyd Webber.)  But really, that would have been awesome because Sondheim would have been a lock on that one.

I apologize to Tim Burton, although not as much, since that opening sequence was ridiculous.

You should by no means consider this the definitive Sweeney Todd, but by all means check it out and enjoy the songs and the atmosphere.  It was so close to the original it almost made me cry at the opening bastardized notes of the Dies Irae. Oh I love this musical, and I really really liked the movie.

**If you want the definitive Sweeney, though, you should really see the 1982 filmed performance with Hearn/Lansbury.  Or go see the latest touring company. I hear David Hess is sheer brilliance.**"

"event","f you're at all familiar with the Wayans Brothers, you know that, like a bad parody of a hurricane, or Godzilla disguised as a caucasian woman, they are a destructive force that knows no boundaries. So it comes as no surprise that, after a three-year silence about the project, the Wayans have announced they still have plans to strip The Munsters of whatever kitschy entertainment value it has with a hilarious Wayans reinterpretation of the material.

But what I did find pretty shocking was their explanation for why the film would aim for a PG-13 rating:

    The Munsters is going to be PG-13 as well. You know what happened with the rated R thing is that we were doing our rated R comedies and then they started clamping down on kids going into the theater. So kids would still be sneaking into our movie but would be paying to see something else. So none of the box office went to our movie, yet everyone still saw it.

So there you have it. If you were wondering why Little Man, with its rock-solid Looney Tunes premise of a grown crook pretending to be a baby, didn't do better in the box office, know that it has nothing to do with a decline in interest in watching the Wayans dress in goofy costumes and hit each other with things. It's just that the Wayans manufacture a particularly edgy brand of adult humor--a cinematic cigarette--that teens desperately covet and will do anything to have, even at the cost of Wayans profits."

VF, not my favorite, but at least they print some socially relevant pieces for the most part, and it's a lot better than US Weekly or whatever crap is available. (Although yes, on the treadmill/elliptical, I read those too. Sue me.)

I was in the middle of an article on the LRA in Uganda, where an insane man named Joseph Kony is kidnapping/murdering/torturing children and insinuating them into his 'army.'  Because as everyone knows, you should get them while they're young.  Look up this thing, it's the most heartwrenching thing you'll ever read.

And what did my eyes behold on the right page of the spread. A full page advertisement for a new ""reality"" series (ha, I love that term. It's such a lie.) called Rollergirls, with some rear shot of a chick in 2 seasons old Hot Topic clearance rack items wearing rollerskates is striking some sultry pose with her hair all wind-blown and such. 

The idea of these 2 realities--one scripted and shopped to the lowest common denominator of trash entertainment, and the other a true story of children forced to kill their families or be killed themselves, or be sold as sex slaves to other soldiers-- right next to each other just struck me as so unbelievably sad and horrible.

My Amy Ketner, who has been through more horrible stuff in the past few years than anyone should ever have to through in their whole life, and yet has the most positive attitude and is the happiest person I've ever met.  I was worried she'd have been beaten down emotionally--I haven't seen her in over 2 years.  But she was the same Amy who manages to charm the world. I love that.

Tarrah, who knows all my crap from college on, and I know all hers, and I know how she was born to teach. And I love how she tries to take care of the world, as well as the people in her own little section of it. She would give you anything in the world if you're lucky enough to be her friend.

This man behaved completely unethically and hopefully will have a civil suit brought against him by the three boys. I'm not one to say ""SUE HIM!"" everytime something happens you don't like, but these boys lives were pretty much ruined by this man who refused to follow procedure and wound up looking like a complete idiot. He all but called them guilty in the press statements BEFORE indictments were even made. They were branded rapists by the community and lost friends, all because a poor woman wanted--most likely--to get some money from what she thought were rich white boys.  Hopefully she'll be named in the civil suit too. These kids lives were ruined--it's a classic case of being tried in the press rather than in a courtroom.  It became clear from the start there was a problem with the prosecution's case, and rather than clear these boys, he dragged it out hoping to gain the black vote for his run for DA. He ruined--destroyed--the college career of 3 men just to gain political advantage, and if that doesn't qualify for libel or slander, then the law needs to be changed.

The North had just as many slaves too, so shut your hole.  But it was WRONG. It's wrong to discriminate against any person because of anything--we are all human beings and we all deserve the same level of basic respect because of that.  But there is such a thing as ""reverse racism,"" and that is what happened here.  These boys were villified--such a HUGE deal was made about the ""white"" boys attacking the ""black"" girl.  Not only were they rapists, they were now RACIST rapists, raping solely because she was black. 

Someone needs to bring this girl and attorney up on  hate crime charges.  The door should swing both ways, and if not, then we're right back where we started from."

Early June my mom goes in the hospital to have some sort of procedure done. They're going to inject chemo directly into the main artery that is feeding the tumor.  She will be there overnight and then will apparently have absolutely horrendous flu-like symptoms for about a month, or at least that's what the oncologist says.  They--ahh, the ubiquitous they-- say she probably has the summer and that's it, but I don't know if that's with or without this procedure.  I'm guessing this procedure is about the last option they have.  Apparently it's spreading to the point where chemo isn't going to make much of a difference in the progression.

But they have been wrong in everything so far. If they had their way she'd have been dead long before now. So the only thing left is to accept that no matter what the outcome, God is faithful.

As it is, it's pressing up against her diaphragm which is why she's been having so much breathing trouble. Just sitting was sometimes too much and she'd start gasping for air. Forget going up and down steps or even walking around more than absolutely necessary. Sometimes I'd be over there and she'd have to stop her conversation with me because she couldn't talk.

So now they're worried about her being able to get enough oxygen, since they can't operate on the tumor and there's no guarantee the new chemo would shrink it, so for now they're going to put her on an oxygen tank.  My mom, one of the healthiest people I ever knew, is going to have to lug around some oxygen tank with some fucking tube up her nose or a mask because she can't breathe.

"event","<b>The background:</b>   Al Sharpton has his panties in a twist again over Don Imus, who was Howard Stern before Howard Stern was cool, referring to a women's basketball team as ""nappy-headed hoes.""  Note that Imus referred to the ENTIRE team as nappy-headed, at no point in time did he single out any black members of the team. At least I can find no reference in all the versions of the story I've read on the various news sites.

<b>The Interesting Thing:</b>  What I find fascinating is that Al Sharpton is up in arms about the wrong part of this slur.  I personally would find the idea of a radio personality referring to a team of female athletes as ""hoes"" more offensive than someone calling someone's hair, essentially, shaggy.  ""Ho,"" from what I understand, is of course derived from the word ""whore."" So Mr Sharpton is more concerned about an insult to hair, basically, than the insinuation that these women trade sexual favors for money.  

My point is that Imus did not refer to them as ""nappy=headed 'n-words'."" He referred to the entire team as ""nappy-headed hoes,"" which automatically includes all the races represented in the team.     While the term has been used probably more for black people than others, I personally have heard LOTS Of people use the term among themselves.  So is this the other 'n word' that other races can't  say?  (Note on the personal side: I hate the ""n word."" I think it's uneducated and vulgar no matter WHAT race says it. But I called a loan nappy the other day and damned if I""m going to be scared to say that word now.)

It's a FRIGGING INSULT TO HAIR TEXTURE, PEOPLE. If you want to get mad or upset about something, get mad at the fact that Imus technically insulted the ENTIRE team by referring to them as 'hoes.'  

This is discrimination taken WAY too far. Being Semitic, I tend to understand a lot of accusations of racially charged hate speech.  This? This is ridiculous."

(Lesson for next computer: Go with Dell. Not Best Buy. That was dumb.) This summer I might be getting a roommate and moving to a different complex, I am not still very sure about that. At the very least I would like to find a cheaper apartment without compromising my No Getting Shot in the Face by a Drug Dealer rule. 

So Ideally by the end of year I'll have an extra 200 a month to save, maybe more if I get a roommate to split things with....So I've decided to save big time and then maybe by the fall start going to grad school. Not full time, of course, and probably only like one course a semester. It will take FOREVER, and I'm not sure how much of it will work out, but I have to do it that way. I graduated from undergrad with no student loans and I'm not about to start building up debt again now.  All the places I've looked at will be around 800-1000 dollars a class, plus books and registration, but I have always wanted to go back to school. And hopefully by the fall of 2008 I'll be able to start that.  

Now I just have to figure out what I'll study. An MBA would the be smartest course, but I just can't see paying all that money to be bored out of my skull...Some sort of financial or economic course would be beneficial as well.  But I would LOVE to get it in literature.  I know I can't use it for anything really, unless I choose to try to get certified to teach, but...I love literature. But I don't want to waste thousands of dollars on something I can't use. Le sigh. I have over a year to figure it out, and there's no real guarantee that it will even come to pass. Anything could happen. I could start and not be able to finish. Who knows? 

But I'm excited. I was planning on building up savings anyway but it occurred to me today that I could possibly be able to start my masters next year as well. WHOOOOO!"

And yes, apparently people are really desperate for ideas about entertainment TV. But anyway.  during the closing credits there was this ad spot running that said ""a study shows over 40% of 9 year old girls have dieted. It's not our bodies that need changing, it's our attitudes.""

I would say probably our TV lineup needs changing too. I know i'm not saying anything new here, but i almost laughed my head off at the fact that this particular ad was run at the end of a show that celebrates the very thing the ad is attacking. Yes, by all means, some 16 year old girl who has body issues is going to listen to a 30 second ad instead of a 30 minute TV show that does nothing but say, ""If you want to be beautiful, you need to be 5'10"" and under 100 pounds.""  

The bald faced and blatant duplicity of this entertainment industry is sometimes so egregiously stupid  that sometimes I really don't believe it and I think sometimes, this HAS To be some sort of strange joke. I mean really. Who on EARTH misses the contradictions inherent in this?

I just wonder if it would work now. I deal with stress much better now, and life has been looking up steadily since last year, so I think maybe it could work.

"event","my mom and i head into Oia to rent quads and tool around santorini.  we stop along the way and i'm traipsing around like an idiot while my mom is in this little shop buying stuff.  i wander across the street and up this set of stairs to snap some pics.  note - for greece, these stairs are totally par for the course on the hazardous scale.  no rail, fairly steep, and totally uneven.  i deftly scale them and make a mental note of one particular stair that basically has a huge hole in it. i'm looking all over and snapping some great shots when i see my mom come out of the shop across the street.  i start yapping at her about something, bearing in mind the scary step ahead.  however, i apparently TOTALLY overestimated my ability to traverse the OTHER seemingly benign stairs and on about the second step down i completely roll my ankle.  i hear a loud snap while somehow managing to brace myself on the wall to avoid completely biting it.  my mom comes running over asking me all sorts of questions about how i fell and what i stepped on and i want to kill her so she will stop asking me questions while i am doubled over praying to god that my ankle isnt broken.

fast forward to today, with my ankle approximately the size of a baseball.  with the help of some advil i have reasonable range of motion, which makes me less inclined to go to a doctor to get it checked out.  my sister and brother find it quite humorous to walk in front of me and loudly announce every step and hole that we come across.  i figure i will try to make it to the next island or hopefully back home before i have to deal with it.  good plan, eh?

leave me some addresses and you will get some postcards in return.  :)"

what i find most interesting about this quiz is the last line.  there is a difference between believing that god exists and believing that his existence can be proven.  now maybe i am reading this wrong and this is not what our friend callalily19 intended to suggest.  i am more inclined, however, to believe that she simply glossed over this important distinction.

thanks for your glib editorializing, callalily19.

mildly less irritating if i havent asked him to at least TRY to be quiet 2 times before.  

slightly less irritating if he werent 33 YEARS OLD.  i swear to fucking god.  he moved in without silverware or furniture.

"event","after rooting through clothes in my closet, i took a break to look through my 'box of favorite stuff' that cait suggested i start keeping in high school.  it's basically full of concert tickets, random hand-written notes, a couple of christmas cards, pictures, and some letters and emails.  i sat and read a few of the letters and all of the emails.  it's really weird how people's perceptions of me change.  as it turns out, i've had a lot of people who really respected me.  things change a lot.  not that people don't respect me, but it certainly isn't the same.  i'm really not whining, just observing. i'm curious how i was different then that made people want to pour their hearts out to me about how i changed their lives.  it feels really foreign.  for the first time in my life i'm actually starting to wonder if i would recognize much about the person i was a few years ago.   

i have the feeling that i believed the nice things that people said to me then more than i do now.  at the same time, it was more convincing then.  what is that?

then i get to the emmy emails.  and i feel like a complete jackass.  and she called me on not being very perceptive.  i was a 5 year old, and she knew it.  but only partly, cuz who could have reasonably expected that i was such a kid.  



so it has been a weird combination of feeling really important and really stupid.

just played about 5 hours of mafia after watching i heart huckabees with like 20 ppl.  fun.  

a lot of ppl are assuming i'm coming back here next year.  thing is, i basically have to arrange my life around doing so. ie not even trying to get a real job that would last more than about 10 months.  i've also begun to question whether i even have the desire.  it's hard when everything starts to feel like an uphill battle.  

3 ppl on my staff so far are interested in having my job next year.  it makes me really happy.  one of my goals was to end the summer with lots of people wanting my job cuz i made it look easy and fun.  hopefully its not cuz they think im incompetent and that they could do a much better job.  i actually dont think that's it though.

might be coming home another 5 days early.  andrew is out of money and ready to peace out.  doesnt really matter to me either way.  

my life is really good right now.  im really enjoying being in london.  going home is going to be really great.  then heading back to DC is going to be awesome.  then, the infinite abyss...  but until august, life is really pretty great."

plus i gotta write 2 10-pg papers over the next two days, so its def a good thing that im up this early.  wow the next 48 hours or so are gonna blow.

the trip was crazy.  too much to talk about.  well, or type about i guess.  i feel smarter, more well-rounded.  i guess thats what travel does.

it feels like april didnt even happen this year.  like the last 3 weeks were a void in time.  or a break from it.  something like that.  

im only here for about another month.  weird.

hope everyone's lives are going well!"

they totally picked the pope.

i was totally sitting in an internet cafe freaking out on a caffeine high and frantically searching for a hostel for that night in florence before heading to termini to meet andrew and tiff and grab a train.

totally didnt even find out that they picked the pope until we turned on the tv in florence about 5 hours later.

today was the last day of class.  i skipped one of em.  totally umich style.  

it's really weird to not know what i want to do come sept.  like really not know.  no preference.  i'm not really used to that.  i liked the comfort of having my life mapped out.  it was soothing.  

anyone else think the terri shiavo thing is fuckin insane?  i like it how the republican party is supposed to represent small government.  but what they really mean is no economic regulation so corporations can do what they want. not to mention nonexistent social programs so they don't have to waste precious time/energy ferreting away money in offseas ventures to keep it from going into the hands of black welfare mothers who just dont work hard enough, and old people who cant afford their meds but who shouldve managed their 401k's better so its their fault anyway. yet as far as social issues go (gay marriage, abortion, euthanasia, shall i continue?) the government's reach can't stretch far enough.  

it makes me not want to come back."

"event","so the last few days have been full of the 'what the hell am i doing with my life?' questions.  i've really never had those before and i thought ppl were full of shit when they obsessed about it, but i'm starting to understand.  it's so close on the horizon.  after september i dont have a plan.  so here are my options as i see them:

- find a job in the DC area working for the govt or a private firm as a paralegal/legal assistant of some kind and live (hopefully) with chrispelkey.
- find a job in AA and live with stine/bryan/jessie.
- apply to the 12-month masters program at LSE and live with patrick.  

here are my considerations thus far:

- DC would be really pragmatic and i could get my foot in the door at a place like the justice dept.  looks good on a resume.  there are lots of postings too, so lots of chances in both the public/private sector.  love DC.  love chrispelkey.

- AA would be great because i could extend the whole college thing a little farther and be close to home which is something that i havent been and wont be for another 5 months or so.  also would take advantage of having so many friends still in the area for one more year.  no job there though... and no leads.  i loves my AA kids.  and AA. 

- london is, well, london.  the masters program would be a great move academically and professionally.  hi, i could get into any law school anywhere.  i think i would like to extend my london stay (though its hard to judge right now) and living with patsy would be great fun too (he's studying a year abroad at LSE).  however, i question my ability to work hard in this environment and i have NO interest in writing a dissertation.  

seriously, input?  i really need it.

btw, when did i become someone that up and leaves home?  like really?  i never thought i would be that person who would get their shit together and get a job in DC or study in london.  i really can't believe thats who ive become.  

i really like home, despite all evidence to the contrary."

patrick just got accepted to LSE, so it looks like he's comin here for a school year in the fall.  i recommended it too, which makes me realize that i am pretty content here.  despite innumerous frustrations that relate mostly to UCL.  mebbe LSE will be better.  anything would be better really.  well mebbe not ANYTHING...  

met andrew and his sister and her friend in the theatre district for a drink.  after i wound up on the dodgy end of drury lane (NOT where the muffin man lives, i trust) and andrew basically saved me.  then we headed back and hung out at a pub called the fitzrovia.  it was a good time.

"event","just got back from paris a few hours ago.  wasn't that amped about going.  i don't really care much about french culture or history, so it didn't really matter to me.  

wow.  it completely blew my hair back.  i kept finding myself thinking 'wow this is completely incredible.'  then i realized that it's pretty much just an incredible place.  despite the occasional stench often arising from dog shit on the sidewalk, or the ridiculousness that can be the french people.  my first glimpse coming out of the metropolitain was, naturally, the arc d' triomphe.  spent forever trying to find the hotel, then went back to the shamps-elysees, which was once again stunning.  you can really see exactly what our capital is based on.  it is really cool to have seen so many imperial cities in my life.  

saturday we went to monmartre and saw the sacree coure which is the highest point in paris.  well other than the eiffel tower.  so of course the view was literally breath-taking.  then got crepes and wandered around where picasso liked to hang out.  and tolous-lautrec, of course.  wow i think i'm really bad at spelling french names.  ah well.  then went to the musee d'orsay and saw tons of impressionist pieces.  including some monets that i love and have actually seen before, which was odd...  then went for dinner at trocadero (across the seine from the tower) and then walked across a huge park and over a bridge to the tower.  just in time for it to start sparkling (it shimmers for about 10 min. on the hour since they installed more lights for the millenium).  my mom couldn't handle going all the way to the top of the tower, so i stuffed the buds in my ears and listened to the ipod alone looking across the parisian rooftops and twinkling lights.  listened mostly to the garden state soundtrack which i hardly ever listen to.  esp. frou frou cuz yea, that song is amazing and was so perfect for the moment.  

today was the musee d'picasso in the morning and a really quick spin through the louvre before heading to the airport.  the musee d'picasso was mildly disappointing because it didn't have much from his blue/rose periods at the turn of the century or from his peace posters in the 1960s.  which are naturally my favorite pieces.  but it was still hott.  i'm really obsessed with how he does faces, he always seems to capture expressions that are so real and familiar.  the louvre was decent, of course just skimmed the surface cuz it's MASSIVE.  saw the venus de milo and of course the mona lisa.  the mona lisa was better than i expected because everyone said it was disappointing so my expectations were rather low.  it ended up being bigger than i imagined, and the colors were really rich and deep.  so yea, crazy amounts of art.  and saw some beautiful streets and buildings and vistas.  and ate some great food.

so in a nutshell, i loved paris and will have to go back.  which i never expected to say.  

oh yea, and i almost used my leatherman to slit the throat of a woman on air france who told me i had to check my bag because the leatherman was forbidden.  despite the fact that i got there without a problem.  then was almost blatantly rude to a stranger for the first time in my life.  it was a good thing my mom was talking to them instead of me.  the fuckin bastards, they totally had it coming.

note: don't ever do paris for the first time in only 2.5 days and expect to be anywhere near jovial by the end."

"event","i just got my first package!!!  it's from the stininator, who is currently undoubtedly burninating the countryside.  it included a little white dog that shakes like crazy when you pull his tail.  and a hott amaretto candle.  and some mail, including a foundation newsletter, which i havent seen in about 3 years.  used to type up those fuckin things and edit out rolla's atrocious comma usage and questionable grammar.  anyway.  then i happen upon this little instruction sheet on how to use - that's right, you guessed it - a DOUBLE BUBBLE.  i instantly freaked out, looked inside the box, to find a double bubble for my very own!!  holy shit, awesome.  wow, i'm seriously still grinning.  and a cute little note at the very bottom.  YAY!

off to develop film so i can start sending out some postcards.  watch your mailboxes, kids :) and gimme your address if i don't have it and you want some postcard love."

"event","so emmy is the only reason that girls' state wasn't a complete waste of my life.  i don't talk to her as much as i used to, but that's pretty easy to do since we used to talk for bout 5-10 hours a day.  i don't even remember what we would talk about, but we really never ran out of things to say.  

emmy is a rather good writer.  though she probably doesn't do it enough.  

emmy introduced me to ani.  seriously how priceless is that.  i don't love ani as much as some, but i can't imagine my life without her.  kind of like i can't reflect on late high school without thinking of emmy.  it's funny how many small ways she managed to change me.    

emmy gives really good hugs.  

she is the only person who has ever made me think that, maybe, sometimes, i'm kinda hott  ;)

she was the first in a long line of friends from that glorious family that i now can't seem to get enough of.  she also got me to stop saying 'fag,' thank GOD.  i used to say it all the time.  

she punches REALLY hard.  

i'm sad that i don't know emmy as well as i used to.  i don't feel that awkwardness that time apart tends to bring though.  

my aa friends would be totally obsessed with her if they knew her.  i can't imagine what would happen if they ever met.  

it seems like almost all of my comments about her are in terms of me.  i think that says something.  what, you ask?  well connect the fuckin dots.  i'm not gonna spoon-feed you."

"event","this is my shout out to andrew.  yea i'm actually calling you andrew, after 3 yrs of aj.  it prob won't stick.  anyway 

i'm really having a hard time doing this.  i think it's because it's tough to encapsulate someone like andrew in just a few sentences, and even harder to briefly talk about why he's important to me.  it't also because it's something that i don't ever put into words because it's so simple and innate.  

andrew has an amazing ability to make me laugh.  i think it's mostly a harsh realism that you don't necessarily see coming.  so funny.  

andrew has one of the biggest hearts i've ever experienced.  he can't wait to give back to a world that hasn't handed him the easiest lot in life.  his passion, particularly for teaching and helping those with lives even harder than his, is one of his most amazing attributes.   

andrew has the most pliable face ever, and does he ever work it.  laura olin, the devil in his forehead, the excess skin, totally rockin.  he's also a hilarious dancer.  i will never again hear dirrty without thinking of him.

his self-esteem is way too low.  

he just might be the easiest person in the world to talk to.  

he looks totally hott in baby blue.  

andrew is someone that i legitimately don't see leaving my life.  he's someone who i want right down the street so our kids can grow up together.  and mine can ask why uncle andrew has a husband too   ;)"

"event","this morning i woke up at 8.30 to go have breakfast to celebrate andrew's 22nd.  walked like 20 min to the aveda cafe, only to find it inexplicably closed.  ended up back at starbucks cuz they take cards.  my white chocolate/strawberry muffin was amazing tho.  tonight we went to this really amazing turkish restaurant and then popstarz for andrews bday.  the walls at gallipolli were green.  i liked that.  popstarz started out kinda slow, but then we found this totally awesome room way upstairs, and it was packed and they played dirrty and justin timberlake and i was sublimely happy.  got groped and licked by multiple gay boys, i really don't know where the magnet is on my body that just tends to draw them in.  not like i'm bragging or anything, it's just a remarkably consistent trend...  

made me miss my kids at home.  and the necto.  haha lame i know.  but it was always fun.  and twain in particular.  i think it was cuz i saw a guy dancing like him.    

got a diet coke and a twix sittin next to me waitin to be consumed.  i don't know why i bought em, i don't really want em.

i just may sleep forever.

"event","let me take a moment to talk to you about chrispelkey.  he has this incredible laugh that you wouldn't believe unless you heard it.  you know how it's so rewarding when you can get someone to laugh who doesn't laugh very often?  chrispelkey is an interesting character because he isn't stingy with his laughter, but even so it never ever ever gets old.  everytime i make him laugh it's a victory, even though i get to hear his laugh all the time.  talk about having my cake and eating it too...

chrispelkey's face crinkles into this gleeful grin after making a delightfully crass remark.

chrispelkey has an inner sadness that makes you want to do anything to make it stop.  

chrispelkey is one of the sexiest men i know, even though he really doesn't seem to buy that he's totally hott.

i envy how many people chrispelkey has around him who think he is amazing.  

he always knows when to offer me a cigarette.  

he never even has to say anything.  his presence really is always enough.  i feel lucky when i get to be near him.  

he is inherently comforting.       

i wish i had met him sooner.  the idea that we went to the same fuckin school for 3 years without knowing each other drives me crazy.  

these are just a few reasons why chrispelkey rocks my fuckin socks off."

on that note, i'm going to follow the most recent LJ trend i've seen and offer to write a post all about YOU if you reply to this post.  do it up.  even if you're reading this and i don't know it (bryan i'm looking in your direction).    

thanks for the encouraging words.

"event","a sobering fact:  11,500 applied to georgetown law last year for a spot in a 450-person incoming class.  seriously, why did i think i would get in by applying in december?  why did i think it would be ok to apply only there and wisconsin, when i don't even want to go to wisconsin?  i'm a huge fucking idiot.  they accept about 1 out of 22.  dammit.  any ideas what i should do post-nslc while i REapply for law school for the 2006-2007 school year?  anyone?  this is gonna be the biggest rejection of my life thus far.  totally not looking forward to it :-(

definitely didn't leave my dorm today.  which also means that i definitely didn't spend any money.  it's really damn cold out.  i feel guilty that i didn't really experience anything today.  i'm putting a lot of pressure on myself, and a lot of guilt follows when i don't go somewhere cool every day.  that's a lot to expect, i should get over it."

"event","so someone stole my fucking bumpersticker from my door last night.  it really pisses me off.  my sister gave it to me for christmas.  coupled with the theft of my kerry-edwards sticker from my car, i'm getting inordinately pissed!  so the kerry-edwards sticker was free, and the sorryeverybody one probly cost my sister about 2 bucks.  but this obviously isn't the point.  the part that peeves me the most is that they were both expressions of my political beliefs, and they got utterly disrespected.  seeing as i basically live for my political ideals, it's such a personal attack and i'm having a hard time getting over it.  i'd like to think that someone couldn't resist them so they took them for themselves, but something tells me that's bullshit.  maybe it's offensive to put a political sticker on my door, like it's too confrontational.  but seriously, that seems lame.  

there is something poetic about getting it stolen on inauguration day.  something tells me that wasn't lost on the thief.  

i doubt it was an american, cuz i've gotten tons of compliments on it from practically everyone in my hall.  at least, not an american on our floor.  weird.      

god, i can't even express or justify why it makes me so angry.  :-(  

on a lighter note, went to karaoke night at the pint pot last night.  was really fun at first, but then got super packed and overrun by annoying americans.  think touchdowns crowd.  DAMN.  i knew a ton of them too, even more irritating.  obviously i'm not saying that all americans are annoying, i haven't become that much of a snob.  but there are a ridiculous share of annoying ones here at ucl.  whoa.  

looks like i might have a bartender there in my back pocket tho, she hooked us up hardcore and i tipped her well for it.  she said she loved me about 4 times.  :-)

ok, about to take a nap.  getting up for class was REALLY rough.

i've been listening to a lot of 3eb and rilo kiley lately.  that's really weird.  haven't listened to 3eb since like high school.  it's oddly comforting though.  and takeoffs and landings just makes me smile at it's darkness and cynicism.  sometimes it's nice to get some honest pessimism instead of empty optimism.  i'm really not that dark though.  not always :-)

"event","so this was a big step for me:  i took off both my livestrong and mgoblue bracelets on sunday.  i found a cool brown and white bone bracelet at camden market, and decided that it was time.  they are lovingly stowed with the rest of my jewelry.  i'm guessing i will put them back on sometime when i get home, but for now i feel like it is time for something different.  i have definitely begun to get in touch with my hippie side, which is weird since living in ann arbor for 3.5 years didn't even touch it.  i really didn't think i had such a side, but here it is, bit by bit!  weird.  sometimes i miss the bracelets, but i think this is a good move.  still sporting the pink one on the other wrist.  it works well with my watch.  anyway.  

andrew and tiffany and i went to portabello road over by notting hill today.  it was ok, but the market wasn't all set up because it wasn't the weekend.  i think i prefer camden still, but i will have to check out portabello on the weekend to do a fair comparison.  it was nice to get out on the other side of town and see the city from a bus instead of travelling underground in the tube.  saw the marble arch for the first time, which is evidently where they used to hang people.  it was really chilling and awesome to catch a glimpse of from the bus.  

i'm trying really hard to live in the moment while i am here, but it's really hard when i don't exactly know what i am doing after august.  i can't wait to head back to nslc, which is something i never thought i would say.  in a perfect world, i will get accepted to georgetown and chris pelkey will get a job out there and we will find a cute little apartment and i will start law school in the fall.  i wish it weren't so far from home, but at the same time i can drive home in a day, or fly home in like an hour.  but i'm trying not to get ahead of myself because i haven't been accepted yet and i totally applied late!  i've never been so anxious about getting an acceptance letter before.  if i don't get in there i need to figure out something else to do for a year.  

also got some random friendliness from a friend of a friend who is studying here, which is really cool.  she offered to take me to some places she likes to hang out, so i will prob take her up on that sometime.

still looking for some actually funny people.  the serious lack of people who can make me laugh over here is killing me minute by minute.  i've never appreciated my friends at home so much before."

"event","just got back from camden town, which rocked my fuckin world.  bought a couple of small things, but REALLY wanted some amazing amber jewelry.  it's been a long time since i've seen rings and necklaces that could make me drool, but they were incredible.  and expensive, but i'm gonna have to splurge.  we only spent a couple of hours there, but we are def going back.

went to a club called popstarz on friday.  it was free before 11, so we were literally running through the tube trying to get there on time.  showed up to a line wrapped around the building, so ended up paying 5 pounds to get in, which isn't terrible.  met a couple of brits on the way, and they were delightfully shady and funny.  andrew thought it was a gay club, but turns out it's pride only on sat and tues nights.  it was kinda nice not to be one of the only straight people there though!  and there were plenty of the gay to go around for andrew too.  one of the guys we were dancing with offered me 'poppers,' which andrew looked up the next day and found out it's something sort of like nitrous oxide, from what i understand.  apparently it only lasts like 5 minutes.  i definitely passed, and watched him snort it out of a little vile.  my first time being offered drugs at a club :)  i'm so awesome now. 

i should really do some actual work now, seeing as i've only read about 50 pgs in a week.  no one does work here.  still haven't figured that one out yet.

so i checked out my first books from the ucl library.  i'm such a badass.  i didn't get how the cataloguing system worked, so i just walked down the hallway and happened upon the ancient history section.  walked up to it, found my professor's book, and another one for next week just for kicks.  haven't totally conquered my fear of the morass that is the library, but i feel better than i did.

two of the girls in my hall that i hang out with a lot haven't heard of atari.  correction, they had heard of it vaguely but didn't know what it was.  one goes to penn, the other cornell.   

sat downstairs in the dining hall talking to a couple of (american) guys for like 1.5 hours, which was cool.  so that makes probably 20 american kids that i know.  other nationalities: 0.  i'm starting to get used to it though.  i basically am existing in a pocket of americans, but they are pretty easy to meet since they don't know anyone either!  

today has been a good day.  no serious longing for home or questioning what the hell i'm doing here.  yesterday was rough.  i don't know what triggers it.  merm.  

might go see closer tonight with some girls in the hall.  heard it was good, an oscar contender and whatnot.  of course that's according to rollingstone.  yea i bought rollingstone for the flight."

"event","i wanna go see the new movie ""the grudge"" but even the previews scare the shit out of me.
and also, after seeing the ring i had to put a blanket or towel over my tv everytime i went to sleep for like, 10 months. 

oh well.. i should just suck it up and go see it. hopefully it won't turn out like the signs where i left the theatre bawling and running for my mom's truck. haha


shit like that scares me. the ""unknown"".. that shit is just fucking scary.

"event","today was good. ill sum it all up.
i went to the mall with my mom, got my eye appt done, and yay, i dont need glasses. colored contacts would be cool tho.
anyways
yesterday i did a ton of yard work/landscaping for my dad and i got 50 bucks. so i bought 2 pairs of pants from pacific sunwear (well actually my mom bought them for me) and got some new cologne from there too. spent $13 of my cazash. 
then we went to hot topic, i didnt get anything but the people that work there were looking at me weird. haha probably since i was wearing abercrombie. i dunno, they made me feel unwelcomed. so i left. i was gonna buy a starting line tshirt, but nahh. i dont really listen to them anymore.
then we went to aeropostale and i bought a pair of shorts and a polo. $25 there. not too bad.
went to this sports store, got a nittany lions hat. my cuz bought it for me. much love goes to her. 
umm.. then we went to walmart, and i bought hair dye and this like lamp thing for my desk. spent $14. 
my new hat kicks ass. it fits my head like perfect. 
and my new hair color looks nice. its like blonde-ish. i like it. 

my arms are so sore from doing like 6 hours of raking and shit yesterday. they killed last night after i lifted weights tho. i was dying.
today they feel better, i just lifted weights and they dont hurt or anything so thats good. 
oh yeah, and i ate fricken wendys.. then dairy queen. but thats all ive eaten today, even tho its hella bad. i gotta stop eating fast food. 




we drove by where amy was killed, and the song ""the reason"" by hoobastank started playing.
i guess she wrote a eulogy for spanish (not knowing she was gonna die of course) and she wrote that at her funeral she wanted that song to play. 
today was the second time ive driven by there since the accident, and both times the reason started playing.
i dunno. i use to think it was coincidence, but i really dont think so anymore."

my [ex] ""best friend"" jennie called. she was all ""oh im so bored, we should chill"" and i was all dodging that cause im just sick of how she acts to my other friends (stuck up, preppy bitch) so i told her we would get together and do something later this week since we both have spring break. so she was all bitchy and shit. then her ""friend"" jessica called so she ditched me. i seen that one coming. 
oh well i dont care. we use to be hella tight and then when i switched schools she got weird and now we barley talk. she thinks i think im better than her or something, which isnt true. 
my mom is making me go shopping for some new summer clothes with her, so i think im gonna hit up hollister and pacsun. hollister and abercrombie have nice shorts. pacsun for the shirts. oh and old navy too now that i have a old navy credit card. helllll yyeeeahh. 
im gonna go take my road test tuesday i think. or something. i need a car still tho. my parents are gonna co sign on a 2002-03'-04' saturn with me. not my first choice, but its aiight. as long as it has wheels and a cd player, then its all good. oh and a window, cause ashleys doesnt and it sucks ass.

"event","im so bored. 
i should be cleaning my room while my hot sexy girlfriend showers but eh. ill just sit here and think of ways to clean it.
so this is my first journal entry. hotttt. 
i noticed the whole cd exchanging community was up and going again. yay. i should join it. i need some new cds. 
my mom is mad at me because i dont go to church. theyre having the whole wensday night soup and supper and then church after that kinda thing. church use to be fun. now its just ghey. i dont know anyone there except holly and shes scurry. but i feel bad that her dad died. i seen her at walmart last night and to my suprise she got fatter. (the hospital put her on this diet cause she weighs over 350lbs - no joke) oh well i think that if my mom and dad both died, i would be fatter too. she should substitue her sugar with splenda. i would tell her that but i dont wanna hurt her feelings.. and plus, when you get within 3 feet of her all you can smell is like sweat and pee. even though its mean, i wouldnt wanna be barfing up my soup and supper. hopefully god helps her. 
speaking of being fat, i really need to work out somehow today. having a thousand feet of snow on the ground kinda sucks when youre trying to run. i wish my mom would buy a fn treadmill or something. but shes sad today :( so im gonna try not to piss her off. her horse died like 2 years ago today. 
blah blah i need a job really bad. i should bring my application in today when i pick up some movies. 
<b>sophia</b> - baby, you need to pick out some movies please. the tvguide website thing wont work for me.

well i better get off my ass and clean.
peace out biznatches."

"event","For some reason I feel really alone. Maybe I'm just not a good friend. That would explain why nobody calls or wants to hang out anymore. The more I think about it the more it seems like I'm never going to amount to anything. I have all these hopes and dreams but I'm not doing anything to reach them. I'm not even doing anything to help myself right now. I'm becoming numb to the point that I hope people forget about me. That I hope people don't care. At least this way I won't drown anyone else with me. I feel like a leper or a sideshow freak. How dismal, how sad, how pathetic."

"event","I think that all others are out of the way of me and Ericha, but all she has really updated about is Ernie. It's kind of unnerving. She says otherwise but...but...I don't know. All the feeling is there.........it just seems like she's still not 100% about all this. She seems to be emotionally unattached at times, but there's nothing I can do about it, since nothing has worked yet. Our relationship is great except for whatever that one thing that's not there, and I don't know what IT is. I'm going to see her today cuz she got her wisdom teeth removed yesterday. That one thing is really disturbing me right now, more than normal for some reason. Sometimes I think it's really just not ment to be, as much as I want it to be. The Infedility, Guam, devotion, these things make me wonder... but it doesn't change the fact that I'm putting all of me into this relationship. 

Lost in all of this
  I keep pushing forward
 searching for the answer
the definition
      the dream wanting to be realized
   where is the map 
 into her heart

"event","of lies, of people getting in the way of my being happy, of my dad, of the people who never seem to call, people who don't pick up the phone, and probably a few other things. So I lied to her first. That was her excuse for all the lies, about everything that happened between her and the local douchebag, about the overseas douchebag, but she keeps doing it, even now. I bought her a ring and everything, but she still can't come clean. Maybe she like to see me hurt and in pain. I'm all out of ideas and energy that I've put into this. But I don't want her to leave all at the same time. What do I do now?"

"event","I don't know how to feel about myself right now. Like, almost all my friends have fallen away from me. Well, most of them, the ones that are still around are only around once in a long while, or it's just seeing them in passing. The whole Ericha thing, she tells me she doesn't want anything serious right now, she's even unsure if she wants a relationship at all and it makes me feel like I should try moving on. Lately it feels like if I tried to make things work that it's just going to fall apart like it's always been. There's just more to lose inside myself this time. I think that this time is the time I actually move on. I'm still scared to leave her because after all the bullshit I think I still want to be with her. I don't know how I would act if I was comletely on my own, and for the first time in a while. I need help in my decision but I don't think I can ask anyone who will give me an honest, unbiased, answer. Sometimes I'm afraid to even leave the house and I don't know why."

"event","So, christ, travis is getting ready to leave in a few hours. This is the last entry I'm going to make from his house, since he's...well...leaving. god, I'm going to miss him. Things are so much different than last time. This time he's taking everything. I'm helping him pack and taking things for myself too. My best friend, and brother is leaving and I won't see him in forever. Haven't cried yet, but I kinda plan on it sometime soon. How are things going to be after he's gone? Man, I'm going to miss him like Chandler misses weed when he's not smoking it. At least I got to spend some real time with him before he leaves, right? Hopefully I'll get into college and be his roomate in the spring. Like he said eariler: "" We already are great, nobody knows it yet."" At least I have a great picture of the two of us. IHOP will never be the same."

First off I cannot understand how I'm an arrogant motherfucker about anything. And it would do the whole female population a service to stay away from me. HEY EVERYBODY, I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON AND NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY EXCEPT FOR MYSELF!! In my opinion I'm a very giving person. And yes I kissed a guy but it was for cash, and ment nothing in the least to me. (Wouldn't you kiss somebody of the same sex for some cash if you was broke?!) In conclusion, I really don't know why I typed this entry because it wasn't worth my time but I felt it had to be done."

"event","So, I'm finally updating again. I just got AOL back recently. I'm fully engrossed with Ericha Rose. Afew people were trying to sabotage that but it all got out in the open and she still wants to be with me, so everything is looking up. I still haven't collected any cash so it may take longer to go to Denton. I've been having second thoughts about moving, I mean theres Ericha, money problems, my car still being busted, so I'm kinda in turmoil about it all. College would be cheaper if I stayed here, I would be more happy staying here cuz of Ericha Rose, and I don't know, as much as I don't like Abilene, it's famillar. I'm so confused as to what I should do. I'm pretty sure I couldn't convince Travis to move back here, but we ARE supposed to start up that venue after we graduate college. I'm not sure about anything right now. I just want to be happy and Ericha Rose does that for me. I hope I can sort everything out soon tho. But hey, who knows what the future will bring?"

I need to write all my friends in jail. I'm such a procastinator. I mean it takes me forever just to even update here. I think sometime soon I'm going to quit everything except drink and smoke cigarettes. Yay for me. I do need to try and get my life together and look towards my future. I think I'm doing ok right now but ok won't be good enough soon. Moving out, college, and just living on my own. Wow, I'm realizing that I'm really irresponsible and as yet I'm not doing shit about it. I'm kinda tired of saying ""just fuck it"". Someone please help me get it together."

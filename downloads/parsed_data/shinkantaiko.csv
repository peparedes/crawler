"event","I'd like to begin today's entry by expressing my annoyance at a certain Mexican for not waking up early as planned.  Bitch.
Next I'd like to point the irony I feel about a new show on Fox (of course) called Life On A Stick.  It is fucking hilarious that they made a show about losers who work at hot dog on a stick after highschool (cough).  I mean, seriously.  What are these types of people (read: mediocre) good for besides comic relief (read: they are stupid).  I don't watch the show, but I can guess how it ends- they finally get a good government job, settle down, die, and are forgotton.
This sweet girl in my COM class did a speech today on black culture magazines.  It made me think about how to be accepted as beautiful by the media a black person has to look biracial.  The ideal black woman for most Americans is Halle Berry, and that is disgusting.  This kind of shit is to blame for the existence of bleaching cream at Walmart.  Next time you're there, take it off the shelves and run around rubbing it on fat white chicks in protest.
Also, this is my last entry.  I am abandoning this account, so please remove it from your buddy lists or whatever."

Anyways I hate livejournal, so I'm switching to Leah mode, a.k.a. vacuos entry mode.  It's so much work writing shit in here and like man, all I want to do is write fart jokes and shit.  But nooo I am to smart and to mature for that.  And Still I have no friends.  Sometimes i wish i was stupid, and all i liked to do was drink, maybe then i'd have some friends. But fuck that, I am way too good for that, i don't want to stoop down to everyone's stupidity just to have friends.

anyways here is my class schedule for next semester:
monday and wednesday:
fencing and french
tuesday and thursday:
communications
friday:
english and guitar

i really hate the super long one class a week classes, but it was all that was left.  i'm super excited about fencing and guitar.  so much so that i am accepting wagers on whether or not those are the only classes i go to.
odds are that i will."

my nana calls me at 7 in the morning, which i guess is later in florida, so now i have my travel arrangements.  the new york thing is still up in the air, but hopefully it wont be.  my nana said that we are going to the keys around christmas, so i dont know if i can escape for new years, plus i dont really have the money, plus i am paranoid about the sleeping arrangements.  but i will be out of vegas from the 21 of december to the 9 of january, and as much as i miss and love and want to see angie, i wont feel deprived if I cant see her.  escaping is escaping, all else is an insignificant detail.
i despise unlv.  it's gay and i mean gay as in homosexual not happy.  everywhere i go theres graffitti soliciting faggariffic sex or a sign telling me to get an aids test and im like dude, how did i get stuck at homo u.?  it's okay i will find a way out sooner or later.  note to self look into getting soon or a later.  last semester they didnt take any money out of my millenium college fund, so i have to see if i can pay mostly with the millenium money.  i should use up as much as possible before i try to leave.
money sucks.  money is the reason i am trapped in this hellhole.  money money moneey mooooonaaaayyyy!!  oh how i loathe and adore it.
i got my hair cut.  c'est tres chouette.
fuck you guys i hate livejournal.  but im bored and prefer it over writing this stupid essay about fat people."

I weird and neurotic when it comes to social interaction.  plus i often look like bum.  bum de le crazy, some would ay.  but how much of it is psychiatric illness, and how much of is it personal preference.  put simply- am I crazy, or do I like being alone?
i suppose that the anti-social state is determined by society, which dictates that human must interact and have relationships.  biologically speaking, as an animal I should be reproducing with every bitch i see.  is it fair, however, that ""society"" can demand that such is true?  this is like when you get that weird, nazi, secretly gay Cuban in your government AP class, and he always says ""history is written by the winners.  there's no way to know if it's true.""  well, stupid shit like that.  the biggest societal cliques make the rules, but does that make them accurate?  I earneslt enjoy being alone.  I have more fun with myself than I ever could with casual friends.  Can society say that is proof of pyschiatrical illness?  
My epiphany:  I'm fucking crazy.

p.s.  I received my grab bag of zines from the Candian finally.  It took like a month but it was well worth it.  I have this one zine in particular, the famed <u>the CIA makes science fiction unexciting</u> #2.  it's all about how aids and hiv were created by the WHO as a biological weapon.  who knows if it's true, but it's interesting as hell!  so i reccomend and can lend.  also, i have a cool one about this retard who gets abducted by aliens.  it's lame but very well written, called ""Take back the night"".  I can't stress enough how well written it is.  the rest were fun, but not too extraordinary: <u>lime</u> #6 and 7 (perzine); <u>tartar and cavities</u> #2 and their <u>curran's mom's sex life</u>; and finally, <u>the neo-comintern magazine</u> made me laugh quite a bit."

I couldn't sit with Kelly, because we were torn apart by our families (very Romeo and Juliet).  It was $3 for a bottle of aquafina, which I forgot in the stadium.  Most annoyingly of all, though, was that he gave the same speech he always gives.  The only new thing I heard were the Yucca Mountain promises, which I don't even care about.  I care that it be done correctly, but it has to go somewhere.  Who can say that one place is better than another?  Whatever.  Kerry used many of the lines he used last time I heard him speak as well as about a million more verbatim from the convention.  If i wanted to hear the exact same speech, I would've watched it on VCR.  (I didn't tape it, if that's any indication to whether I'd ever want to.)  I'm still voting Kerry/Edwards, but who wants to hear the same rhetoric a million times?  Not me, for one.  Plus, if not for swift ninja maneuvering I may have had to talk to Eister.

""I do what I want, and I don't wanna kick it with no one who has problems with that.""
Now at this point there was a weird scilence.  I think the man may have either hypnotized her, pulled out his wang, tazered her a little, or something like that.  He says in a different voice.  ""Nah, forget it.  Let's just chill out and kick it.""
""Yeah.""  She says in a softer voice.  I can hear them start to walk away.
""It's all about having a good time, right?""  he says.
""Yeah, baby.""  She replies.
Again silence.  One would presume that they were kicking it somewhere, but I presume that at this point she snapped out of the hypnotic state, pulled out her wang, or tazered him a little.  All of a sudden I hear this stomping around.  I hear jingling keys, and he's making hissing noises, saying ""fucking women.  cunt.  Bitch.""  a hear a rickety sound start and drive away.

It is le fascinating when life is like le soapopera.
I hung out with cary today.  it is cool when nothing goes as planned and you can laugh with someone.  we saw catwoman (2 and a half out of 5 stars.  it was cute visually, but not really cool.  bad plot flow, there's a review in the las vegas weekly i was sitting on today that made an accyrate point- the movie replaces plot and dialogue with music video sequences.  sharon stone is hot though and evil.) and got lost a little (hilariously I might add) and went to a porn store (cary is such a goddam prude!  an enjoyable smurfish prude.).

i wrote this song at angie's house one day, and I don't remember what it's called or where it is.  since the loss of our song book.  anyways it went something like ""smoking pot drinking beers drinking beers beers beers smoking pot pot drinking beers""  and then there were some zombie noises and a french guy, if i remember correctly.  anyways that's how i feel right now (even without the pot and beers).  I miss ya' Ang!"

i have about 5 more articles to prepare for my zine, i'm estimating.  so, in about a week and a half i'm moving to print.  i still have to design a cover and look into binding.  i either need to get a stapler, or use my sewing machine for something valid (now that i have the owner's manual.  that shit is like 40 years old!) and sew in the binding.

so, this draft biz keeps coming up on the liberal community.  someone said that it's been dead for 18 months, and i'd be willing to bet he's right.  i won't check the facts though, because I'm lazy.  Either way, instead of any insights into my life or lack thereof, a rant about drafts will follow.

Am I for the draft?  Yes.  Am I for redundant wars?  No.  In Israel they have a mandatory two years service for every man and woman, and I think that's genius.  People in this country take it for granted, and if I were called I would serve in a heartbeat.  Would I volunteer?  No.  I would never go to war though for for the perjured reasons we war now.  I would never have gone to Vietnam either.  Maybe I am a heartless bastard sometimes, but I would not risk my life for regime change or something gay like that no matter how many atrocities went on in a country.  To preotect my country and its allies, yes.  I would've gone to Afganistan if I were asked to.

How To Read Donald Duck: Imperialist Ideology in the Disney Comic 120 pages, photocopied, full sized (9 oz) $13.00 Is Walt Disney that innocent? Why are there no parents in his comic books? How come the natives and savages always give up their riches to the duck invaders? What are Huey, Dewey and Louie doing in Vietnam? The Chilean people began to ask these and other questions in revolutionary Chile in 1970. This seminal deconstruction was, of course, banned and burned during the fascist period in Chile, and is still banned here in America (Disney will sue into oblivion anyone who publishes it). A product of the political struggle, the book is a profound and imaginative critique of the sacred cow of children's culture: the Disney myth.

It has a strong preservation of each person's view and all of the stories are strong and unique. It was quite alarming to hear about peoples' outright abuse at the hands of institutions and mistreatment by the system in general. Some people were just troublesome teens who their parents had locked away, others were diagnosed as schizophrenic, and some were just privy to seeing the escapades of relatives who are child molesters or otherwise diagnosed as mentally unfit. The intent is to create a forum to discuss and address issues affecting people in a community focusing on mental health.

so i took a short break from watching amelie to go to the park.  it was like quarter til ten, so the parks lights were still on and all the mexicans were still playing soccer.  other people were there too, besides the mexicans.  so i bust out a fattie, right, and i'm like smoking that shit.  it's not great but it's not like dirt.  so i'm puffin' my j and this woman comes over to me.
""hello.  excuse me.  i do not appreciate the example you are setting for my kids.  i don't bring them to the park to see drug addicts."" says the woman.
now normally i'm pretty sympathetic to kids, but this woman just rubbed me the wrong way, you know?  so, in one of my more daring moods i suppose, i say ""look, bitch.  it's your job to model for your kids, not mine.  piss off.""
then she says, ""well, i'm going to call the police then, if you won't be reasonable.""
so i says, I says, ""way to go and tell me dipshit.  by the time they get here there will be nothing to prove it but your heresay.  so shove it.""
at this point i return to nursing my marijuana cigarette in peace.  she walks away, and no cops ever came, obviously."

The only drawback was the ugly lesbo sex.  I mean ugly, too.  You can't even enjoy Charlize Theron's boobs, because <b>she was so ugly in that movie!</b>"

"event","BABY HAS PINK EYE!!!  His eyes are so puffy and nasty and green shit is coming out of every orifice.  It's sad.  Sadder than sad.
Angie says to postpone the date I go out to NY.  Now I'm having second thoughts.  I want to go OH SO badly, but it just seems so intangible and shaky.  I haven't decided not to go, like, as far I know I'm still going.  I just have doubts, man.
I <3 Hyan.  I know I told Leah to beat her up after she stood me up at Wendy's, but if that bitch were to have touched a hair on her head I would have asshumped her through a window.  That's right. the asshump is the only weapon that works against Leah.  It's like her hryptonite and shit.  I hope we DO go to UNLV together.  I wasted so much time with theater faggots in high school, when I should've been with good people like Hyan.  It's just that Angie is my bffl, and where she goes so goes my nation.  I do regret though that didnt get more time in with the IBers.
Also,
If there was one emotion I had to pick to get rid of right now, it would be sentimentality.  What a gay fucking emotion, and man am I ever full of it.
My three goals this summer:  Zines, doing freaky friday, and emotional purging."

"event","oh yeah.  i was running a message service for a bunch of people in prison too, for a few hours today.  that was interesting.  apparently you get the shit beat out of you for owing four dollars.  i heard a guy begging another guy to bring him four dollars.  ahahahahahahaha  I remember when I was in prison.  
There I was surrounded by the other inmates.  The look in their eyes was violent and lusty.  I knew that if I didn't represent they would fuck me up, both figuratively and literally.  They were tough, too.  The food in prison is minimal at best, and the exercise routine is quite strenuous.  Months of isolation and mistreatment had made these men hard, and they intended to beat me to death.
I looked to my left and saw two men.  The first a tall and skinny Mexican with long defined arms for grabbing and punching.  The second a short, bald, and fat white guy.  He was small and tough, and obviously sneaky enough to get extra food.  The door was directly in front of me, the way obstructed by three generic muscleman.  Generic mentally but murderously strong.

Yeah.  I'm lying.  I'll stop."

"event","right now i am at my nana and papa's house.  How i got here:
Woke up at 9 and went to Jared's ""graduation"" frpm kindegarten.  Hello, that's not a graduation that's a promotion.  Why does every song they sing have to have an animal noise and hand gestures?  I want to get an army of 6 year olds and just teach them musical numbers, and then show up next year and have a war with the dance.
Then we went to breakfast at some cheapo shitty casino.  
Then my mom was supposed to take me home to pick up some supplies and then drop me off here, as arranged by the children here.  But instead I end up going to the salvation army (I got a blue Jesus shirt.  It's funny.), and then I get stuck at my mom's for like 5 fucking hours while she plays video games.  Meanwhile Ted is tweaking, which means that he tries to kill everyone.  He got all up in Jennifer's face about some pizza Danny ate.  Who does that about pizza?!  I wish someone would shank that motherfucker.  (I'm going to kicked out of school now, aren't I?)  So then, 13 hours later I get to Karen's and by then mt mother has stolen so much of my day that I didn't get anything done.
I'm  pretending to care, but I know I don't.  I don't want a fucking job.  But, I DO want to go to college and move out someday, and everyday that I don't get a job is another day that's delayed.  That kills me.
Join the community with the username askveronica.  Then ask her questions a la dear abby.  They don't have to be real, just interesting or funny.  I'm begging you, even just once.  I want an advice column for my zine.  The theme is highschool and the summer after, so keep that in mind if you're making stuff up.  You don't really have to remember that though, if that's going to stop you from doing anything."

"event","Well, it was pretty fucking fun.  The actual ceremony was hilariously crappy.  They had to interupt with an emergency (If you drove here in a silver impala, please proceed to the parking lot.  It is on fire.).  Plus, since we never did a rehearsal, no one knew what was going on.  The people kept interupting each other when they were saying the names.  I was sitting next to this girl, Stormie, and she kept calling people and passing around her cell phone.  All the inefficiency that would have driven me up the wall normally was fucking funny as hell.  It just seemed appropriate.
After that was done we went to T.G.I. Fridays, because I had never been there, and the commercial was on when my mom asked me where I wanted to go.  My mom said that afterwards she wanted to take me to harry potter.  I was like, no I can't I have to see it with Angie.  She was upset.  After a Grey Goose martini and two Long Island Iceteas later, though, I agreed.  (Don't be mad angie.  I literally slept through 2/3 of it.).
Man.  I am ADDICTED to diet coke.  Diet soda alwayd tastes like poison to me, so I don't know how it came about, but I am.  Maybe I get a sick pleasure from imagining that I'm drinking poison.  I dunno.  I'm living off of diet coke and gum (You found my whitening gum.  I loooVE YOU!) so I should drop dead at any second.
My lazy, cheap ass mother didn't give me a party like she said she would.  Apparently I was supposed to do all the planning and shit.  Well fuck that, I'm not planning my own graduation party.  What can one do?
I want to hang out with people, before I turn into a shut-in.  I feel like there's a timer in me that, when it runs out, will turn me into a hermit.  Man, 10 seconds and motherfucking counting.
The cursing makes me seem ignorant doesn't it?  I wouldn't object to seeming ignorant.  All the more surprise when I rule the world, motherfuckers!!
Two more things.  A) no job yet, and my enthusiasm for finding one has pretty much died.  B)  I have all my momey to buy my new york ticket.  My dad hasn't given me the $200 yet, but he said he has it.  I'll shove all the mess from my house into the laundry closet and then he'll give it to me, and I'll punch him in the face (just for kicks and giggles)."

You are my history 
what others tell you wont be true.

MUuAaHhhaaaaa, SO today is Valentines Day one of the most obnoxious holidays known to man.  Yes, thats correct I hate Valentines DAY!!!!  Right now all i want to do it sleep until the horrible holiday is over.  

This weekend was like being on a flippin roller coaster.  I got home thursday after being on campus for what seemed like an eternity.  Then i came home and went out and did errands with the girls.  Then angie and i came home and made valentines and ate dinner, and chilled for the whole night until i was awoken from my nap by our neightbor PAul Riley (That name is awsome)!!!  Then people started to show up at our house and apparently we were about to have ourselves a P A R T Y!!!  People just kept rolling up with more and more people, and before i knew it I was wasted and there was about 25 people in our house.  AHAHA.  Sometimes i just like to have small gathering with people i know so i dont have to play babysitter all of the time.  OK so heres a quick synopsis of what happened, tears, alcohol, more alcohol, fights, alcohol, barfing outside, super amounts of alcohol, valentines, more tears, barfing inside (yucky, thanks brad for cleaning it up), alcohol, spills, sticky, really super sticky, dogs in the house, fights, smooches, more alcohol, keys, drunk driving, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol!!!!!!!  SLEEEEEPPPP!!!! I think that it will be a long time before we have another party at our house.

Then on Friday i was supposed to go and meet with my professor about my paper, YEAH that didnt happen!! Nor did i make it to my math class.  OOPPS.  SO i was really pissed that i coulnt sleep so i got up early and attempted to clean the house.  Then angie and lisa, and i went to look at houses.  They all kinda sucked so as of right now next fall im living in a box.  After we were done with that bull SHIOT i came home and ate and headed to the good ole GR!!!!  I met up with my MOM (smooches, i love <3 her) and my Grandmother for dinner but i felt so shitty that i went home really early.  Then i called Laura cuz i got super restless and we went out to cascade for a while until i went over to Matts and they all went out to Diversions. . Gerr

Then on Saturday i hung out at Matts all day!! Thats what i really wanted to do for Valentines day. . .NOTHING!!! Nothing at all.  We watched like a trillion movies and ate pizza and sat our our smelly asses all day.  I got my Hello Kitty blanket which totally rocks my world.  Over all it was a low key Valentines which is perfect.  So Matt and I are offically boyfriend and girlfriend now which also rocks my socks.  But how flippin weird me a No commitment freak commited!!!  MUUaaahhhhaaaa Crazy.

Then on sunday i went to the store with my mom and bought a ton of food and then met up with NCM and we went to visit Jared and his big pants.  Then i had to drive home all sick in the rain back to the zoo.  I feel like shit on the inside of my heart and i have this nasty cold that does not rock my world.  Oh im trying to quit smoking so ive been all bitchy lately so if you see me smoking throw shit at me.  Im down to like 1 or 2 a day and usually dont smoke the whole thing.  

NCM and Laura i am sorry that i did not hang out with you this weekend i suck i know!!  For now i have to run to class but i will apologize further later. . . . ."

"event","So tonight was the SUPER BOWL, yeehaw.  I really really wanted the Eagles to win but they didnt so thats super sad.  I thought the 1/2 time show was going to be much better but that also sucked.  The comercials werent that good either i think i saw that stupid Pepsi one like 10 times and that other one for the new mustang about 8000000000000000000 times as well.  But over all i still had a very fun super bowl.  Laura and nick came down and lisa and phil came over and we all just chilled had a drink ate some pizza and watched the game. I guess i will give this sunday an A- 

This weekend was pretty fun.  We didnt have a thursday night party which sucked because i had to study all night.  I spent most of the night at the library and then came home and finished there.  Thank you girls for understanding, this thursday i promise we will have a good party.  But i think i did well on all my tests last friday so im psyched to see how i did tomorrow in class.  Then on friday we went to the hockey game.  Western got there asses kicked so that was no good.  There was this crazy guy there passing out as he called them ""wacky willies"", he was so crazy.  Then angie started doing the mighty ducks chant so we decided to go round up some people and watch the series at our house, but not before going on a mission to steal chan back.  Yes i said chan!!!!! apparently lisa and people came over to our house and ganked her off our poarch a long time ago so we got her back on friday night. Then on Saturday i went over to Matts and hung out.  It was relly fun.  We went out to dinner and a movie with his friends.  It was fun but i hate when I have to meet people for the first time, i always get nervous and dont say anything and then it looks like im a bitch and im not i just cant think of anything to say and i freeze up and end up looking like a jackass.  But they were really nice but i think the age thing might have freaked them out.  They are all married and have kids and im only 20 still in school and cant go to the bar to get a drink and hang out.  Which is kinda shitty!!! Sooooooooonnnnnn though i will be 21!!!  I cant handle the anticipation anymore."

"event","I love that Bumper sticker, i think it pretty much sums up life in GR!!! HAHAH just kidding it just makes me smile whne i see it on the back of a van with a shit load of people jamed packed in, with Mexican flags hanging from the rearview mirror. Thats HOT!!! and thats pretty much all im going to say about that.

SO lemme think ahaha, whats going on.  Um classes suck.  I have all these teachers who want us to do group work, study guides, and so on and so on.  SO that pretty much blows the big one. Im the only one at my house that has friday classes so there is no motivation to make it to class on Friday.  This friday I have to because i have a huge test that im not ready for in com 307 and then I have a quiz in MATH yucky.

I think that we are going to move but not fore sure anymore.  We want to move down the street because we love this neighborhood and the house is super cute.  Its going to be a little more expensive but i think i am going to be able to swing it.  I just think that i need advice about how i am going to ask my mom for the security deposit.  She is so pissed at me right now and she has every right to be cuz i am the biggest slacker and dont have a job.  AHHH i dont even want to get into that right now.

BOYZZZZZ, so i guess you could say that i am seeing this boy named Matt.  I think i have mentoned him once or twice before but yeah.  Hes super sweet to me and for everyone that knows me fairly well knows that i dont date boyz for any long period of time, but for some really odd odd reason i feel that i really like him and dont want to move on just yet.  He gives me this yucky gooey feeling in my stomach and whenever he calls i get super excited.  No matter how many times a day we talk whenever my phone goes off i secretly hope its him.. . .was that out loud!!!  We are so different but for some weird reason it seems like we have known each other forever FOR EV ER. . FFOORR  EEVV EERR.. . i wanna watch that movie now. But we just click i guess thats the only way i can explain it. But yes for all my commitment issues im going to go ahead and say it, i really like MATT!!!  YUCK, alright enough of that.  I suppose i should go and be productive but a nap uuhhh a nap sounds awsome.  Its your call either way im out like trout."

At least today i actually had shit to do but then i got to thinking that i always forget about this thing and that i should write in it.  I have so much to post but i just looked at the clock and oh shit i have to go to my awful math class.  Yucky all im going to say is i hate math i dont like it i dont understand it and damn it its my 2nd time, wait i lied its actually my third time taking the class haha and if i dont pass then western should let me not have to take it anyway.  They have my money they have my soul what the hell more do they want.  I have to run to class now but i will try to finish my rant later tonight."

"event","So right now im in between classes.  I really hate waiting around for an hour to go to class when i could be sleeping!!  oh well i guess life will go on and i need to stop complaining so much. . .the dome is cold, this is really spicy,  man the dome is cold ; ) Anywhoo I just got out of my com 307 class and for the most part i like th eclass but there is this one kid that wont shut up the entire class.  He always has some stupid comment that has nothing to so with what we are talking about.  I just want to walk up to him and slap him with my book and tell him to shut up!!!  the library smells really funny right now and its kinda freaking me out.  Speaking of funny smells yeasterday in soc 304 megan and i could not stop laughing cuz the entire lecture hall smelled like a gigantic perm and ranch dressing.  i love that class not becasue its the most interesting one ive ever been to but all my friends are in that class with me.  Im surprised we have'nt gotten kicked out of that class because all we do is talk and laugh.  yesterday was my baby brothers 17 b-day and i am fealing really guilty for not calling him i think i am a horriale person for not calling.  When i was home last weekend i made him a card but still i feal really shitty.  Ive been so sleepy lately i cant stand it my roomates are starting to call me grandma cuz everytime they come home from class i am sleping it seems like.  but im up everyday at 7:30 before anyone in my house even thinks about getting up.  Man i hate money i  think it would be super sweet if we had some barter system instead.  I have so many things i could trade that i dont use or want and then i could trade them for things i really want.  Just typing the want makes me sound really greedy and i dont think i am but you get what i mean. . . basically i hate being poor and even worse i hate money!!!  Last night i got another call from Matt.  we talked on the phone for like a half hour.  hes cute but i still am confusd and dont know what to think about the whole situation.  Boyzz aaaahhhh.  I need to make up my mind not only when it comes to that situation but in generl im so. . whats that word?. . .indecisive.  La la la i downloaded a bunch of new music this weekend wich is awsome.  but for now im going to go ive killed enough time and have been completly random for the time being."

"event","Ive been a bad bad girl,
I've been careless with a delicate man, 
and its a sad sad world, when a girl would break a boy just becase she can!!  
Dont you tell me to deny it
Ive been wrong and i need to suffer for my sins

I love <3 that song soooo much.  SO ive been the biggest slacker lately when it comes to this journal thinkg as well as my school work. AAAHHHH it all just keeps coming and i dont know how to stop it.  SO this past week has been pretty typical. Class and homework class and homework.  Classes are good but i can feel that big wave rumbeling out in the ocean ready to hit shore.  Next week is going to suck big time i think i have like 2 exams and a paper and a ton of reading to do so i better get my ass in gear.  On thursday we had people over to the house and i got really trashed.  We played trival pursuite? is that how you spell that either way it was the 90' edition.  Then it got harder and harder to play as we continued to drink.  Then kelly and steve and some other people showed up and it was really fun.  The only thing that sucked was that i had to be up early that next morning to go to MATH ahhh i hate that class.  Then on friday i did the whole school thing and then that night RYAN J came over hes sooo cute.  I dont know why we dont hang out more often its not like we live far from each other.  Anyway we drank and watched the basketball game and then went and passed out but not before each finishing half of a frozen pizza each and buying beer for the neighbors at the munchie mart.  Speaking of i think that i am going to get a job at the munchie mart at the end of my road which would be super awsome the people who work there seem to be really cool and i love interacting with drunk people.  My mom seems really worried about me working there and i guess i see her point cuz it could be kinda scarry at times but i know karate and 7 other words in chinese.  Then on sat i work up really hung over and i dont know why i didnt drink that much but my head was killing me.  Then i drove home to grand rapids and got to hang out with the kids which is always fun.  That afternoon NCM (we will keep jis identity mostly hidden) and i went to sams club to buy cat food and it was really busy so we had to park way the hell out in the ass of the parking lot then we fight through all of the people inside stand in line for 1o minsand then get up to the line to pay and he doesnt have any money and i am so brole i would have helped him out but my credit cards are maxed and i didnt have any money on me so we looked like big dorks and left.  HAhaha we are such idiots.  Then that night angie laura mark nick me and MATT went to the casino and lost all of our money.  That was pretty fun im glad that i got to hang out with matt that night.  Then on the way back i had to stop and pee so many times sorry guys i shouldnt have drank so much.  We made it back to GR at like 5 in the morning.  I was so tired.  Then i went over to matts appartment and passed the hell out.  He is so freaking different than me like SOOO different but i dont know. i really like him and hanging out with him so basicaly i dont know. Im not going to push anything and i guess just sit back and see what happens.  DO u ever feel like you can be everything to everyone.  Sometimes i feel like i lead a doubble life.  These days its getting harder and harder to balance everything.  School, house shit, western stuff, friends here, roomates, jobs, Bestest friends from home, family, boys aaahhh the list can go on forever.  Its like if i do one thing with a group of people then the others are pissed i feel like a rag doll being torn into pieces.  And what really pisses me off is when people cop an attitude with me for NO FREAKING REASON!!!!!  I cant satisfy everyones needs and im only trying to do my bestest to make everyone happy and it really sucks when you make me feel guilty for almost everything i do.  I cant help it i wanna be happy toooo.  Im not rying to be shaddy so im sorry if it looks that way.  Wow i went off on a total sochaotoa.  SO then i came home sunday morning early as hell and went to breakfats  and church with the fam.  Im surprised i didnt fall asleep in my bluberry pancakes.....yummy that sounds super good.  Then i passed out for the entire day and drove back to the zooo on monday.  uummm kay, kay, k alrighty kkkkaaayyyy I have to go and be productive now tootles!!!!"

"event","So i have now officailly been up for more than 24 hours. . AAaaaHHHhhh!!!  I think when i dont get enough sleep little things start to erck me in a weird annoying way.  And just for the record no one likes being lied to or left out and its espically worse when the two occur at the same time by someone who is supposedly a ""FRIEND"".  Just so you know your not fooling anyone and if you want to continue to be shaddy thats cool you have your own needs and desires but just incase your so blinded by your own agenda your going to loose your friends quicker than you realize and then your left standing alone.  Self denials a bitch.  Ive beeen burned in the past and forgiveness is something thats particularly hard for me.  Anyway i made it through a long week of classes and for the mst part i really like all of them which is good but i think i am going to have mass amounts of homework this semester but i think i will survive.  The weekend was pretty fun.  On friday we all went over to angies friend brads house and drank for a while it was kinda boaring but fun dont get me wrong.  Then on sat i went home to get my car fixed for like the millionth time but i still dont have a radio in my car which really sucks but i still have the baby boombox which rocks in its own original way.  Then that night nick and laura and i went out to get food it was really yummy we wne tto sams joint.  Then later that night we went to a party and that was frick hillarious.  I love drinking with laura and nick they are my bestest friends.  I think i kissed laura several times that night.  We got so fucked up like i dont know how i made it all night.  It was fun people were playing cards and darts and there was mass amounts of dancing. . .I think if thats what you want to call drunk white girls dancing to bad rap.  Then it got to be like 5 in the AM and i went over to matts house and chilled for a while, and htat was fun but weird in i guess a good way.  I think i passed out at like 9 30 or something and then the alarm on my phone went off at 10.  I didnt make it home in time for church with the fam which sucked and i caught alot of hell for it.  But i got to eat breakfast with them which is always fun.  Then i met nick for dinner and the rolled back to kzoo.  When i got home lisa and megan were chillin doing some homework so i was productive this evening and they helped me with my math ahhh i hate that class.  I love those girls and i hope that we can all live together next year FOR SURE!!!  Then angie came home and had a random drew story for me.  I guess her and brad went out last night and they were together buying beer or something at hardings and he came up to her and started talking to her.  I guess ""I WAS REALLY MEAN TO HIM"" and he doesnt know why?!?!  Im like what the hell he is the one that doesnt want a relationship with me and hes the one that met someone while i was home for christmas and went out with her.  Hes the shaddy ass mother fucker but thats all im going to get into it tonight.  Im moving on and that shit is all in my past.  im having serious doubts about the direction in where my life is going right now but for the moment i think i am going to sleep on things instead of pulling the usuall running from tough situations.  alright i have to finish reading this damn article and pass out before class in the morning.  And to laura the party was fun we will have to catch up on details later. Night night!!"

So i got all nestalagic and read some of the old entries and laughed my ass off.  What the hell was i thinking i deffinetly did some really crazy shit.  SO i really sont know what to write about at this time there is just too much to put down that has happened to me in the past year to write or even remember.  SO here is the 10 secoend bio of my life. . . .ready it going to be quick.  I now live with my two awsome and and most bestest friends at Western angie and megan. Im a junior now majoring in communications, and minoring in sociology and thats going to be the last and final career change. . I think?  School life is good, classed are long but i guess helpful in the long run, parties are fun, drugs are crazy, music is even better.  Boys suck i hate them all right now( i dont even want to get into that whole mess rightnow), and family is decent.  Home is great i love my friends there LAURA ANN. .HUGS!!, Nick 'O' las' Corey whom i have custody of ;), angie dont be mad about that last statement, timmy perment rock tire checker, alison my party girl, nickole always a devoted friend, LOUD!! mark, J Dolla who reminds me just how white i really am, and im sure im missing many many more.  I love ya all.  Im unemplyed but desperately in need of a jod FUCK YOU!!! Meijer. I guess you could say im living the ""typical"" but not so typical college life.  Trying to balance friends, fun and oh that little thing i like to call class and homework all in the mean time trying to get an ounce of sleep. Now lets flash back to the preasent. . Its the first week of classes and thats always slow and boaring and a shock to my mind and body.  I've been out looking for a job like mad but almost everywhere i go they just about laugh in my face and say ""were taking applications"" blah blah blah so basically i have 20 dollars to live off of for the next oohhh whenever im employed so that really sucks. Im a flippin idiot for buying this keyboard cuz almost all of the keys stick and it doesnt help that i dont dust and get ready at my desk OOPPSS.  Other than that life is pretty boaring and crazy all at the same time.  Hopefully i will keep up on this damn thing but for now im out to do loads of homework.  Nighty Night all!!"

Them i came back and got all ready and went to lunch with the girls.  Then i had class again wich was horriably boaring.  It was CS 105 and i thought i was going to die of boardom.  Our teacher showed us how to turn on our computer and talked about how to use windows!!! I think that we r just going to smoke everyday before going to that class to make the time go faster. AHHHH . . . . oh well i had time to read my email.  I got an email from my sister who is in London having a good time so i am very happy for her.  Then we came back to the room and got dinner with a whole group and that was fun.  Then we went to get ciggs and got in the huge traffic jam because of the basketball game.  Now im attemting to work on some homework before i go upstairs to watch the gauntlet with ppl.

It was fun for a while but then i wanted to get out of the car cuz i felt sick :( but i made it home without up-chucking so that was good.  Then i went out with nick and angie and got food and it was really good.  Then we went to meijer and got my $80 dollar pay-check and went back to nicks.  Then it got to be like 10 and i was board and went home.  Then at like 1 o'clock i get a drunk call from timmy asking for a ride from down town cuz he was too drunk to even remember where he left his car.....hes such a dumb ass sometimes.  So we are on the express way right by the exit for alpine and i have to pull over so he can throw up.  It was so gross.  Im just glad the cops didnt come by cuz it was bad.  So i dumped him off at his place and tucked him into bed it was so funny.  He wanted me to stay but i didnt want to fool around, all i wanted to do was sleep.  Then on sat i got my CAR back!!!!  It is all better and now my cd player is half installed but works none the less.  Then that night i drove ryans ass back to school in this super huge snow storm which sucked.  

When i got back to school i hung out with megan for a while unti my friends got to western.  They drove all the way to k-zoo just to smoke me down and it was really fun.  I miss Lisa Y. so much we had the best of times together last year and i miss her lots.  We smoked alot and then ate a whole lot, i think i got sick from it cuz i still dont feel good after eating it last night!!!  So know when i think of campus kitchen i feel really sick to my stomach.  I had to do my rounds with the RA's last night wich wasnt too bad, espically cuz i was stoned off my ass the whole time.  It was so obvious but they cant do shit about it...HAHAHAHA!!!!  When i was donewe went to meijer and 7-11 and then cam back and watch a movie and passes out.  It was a fun night and im really glad they came all the way over here to hang out with me.  I think that i will have to drive out there to smoke with them.

Today was pretty quiet.  Im trying to catch up on some homework and sleep.  Megan and i did some erands and made cookies and were lazy all day and i loved it!!  The more i hang out with megan and angie the more excited about our house for next year."

I really like the proff but i hate waking up early all those days.  But angie and phil are in the class so im sure that will make me want to go to the class more often.  For the first time since ive been at western i feel like i know who i am and what i want to do with my life and im surrounded by really great people......so its safe to say that western is my home and im really HAPPY for the first time in a really long time.  Now just if i can find a job and make some cash everything will fall into place like it is supposed to.

SO now for my stalkerish ways......so there is this really cute caff boy that i think is totally hot but its just a crush and i expect nothing to come of it other than him just being nice to look at and joke about.  AWYWAY its really creapy it seems as though everytime i look around i see hime.  He is in 3 of my 5 classes and has a 4th right next to mine....i almost litterally ran into him the other day and i always see him working in the caff :)....i want to say something to him but i think it would be really stupid....Dont worry TIMMY you will always be ""the boy"" that i crush on all of the time jk....but i do really miss you and you better write me soon or ill have to kick your ass!!!"

Christmas break . . . I worked like a million hours at Meijer, it wasnt tttooo bad but in the end i got fired....I THINK. I think when u dont call and dont show for 2 days in a row u r more than likely fired.  Other than work i got to hang out with all my friends from back home and even over break i got to hang out with ppl from school but i will get back to that.  But i was glad to be home for a while.  SO many things have changed over break while i was away at school but i think for the most part i am good with it now....:( i think.  I just want to say for the record i dont mean to create conflict and i just want everyone to get along....anyway.  I was glad to be home and see everyone and have it be like old times.  For christmas my best gift was my cd player....well i mean it will be when it is completed...dont worry mark i was the one that was busy but for now i have a big hole in my car.  That brings me to the next problem....my car is dying.  It now rests out in the country with the engine out of it awaiting the time i have an extra $1000.00 laying around.  So needless to say i will be walking everywhere.  While home for break i got to spend alot of time with timmy.  I really like hanging out with him but i really dont know whats going on between us.  We act like we are dating........;) and do all the fun stuff together but im not sure what to think i think it all comes back to me and the big C word.  But without the drama it was fun we ate alot and smoked alot and just did stupid things together like we always do and it was fun but i think that i gained like 5 pounds...YIKES!!!!

New Years. . . I went to HOMER michigan and visited megan and Lin-z whom i miss tons and tons and i really wish that she was here this semester but missing her isnt going to help.  ANYWAY....we went to 280 this really cool house in hillsdale where a band lived that megan is friends with.  It was so fun.  I got really super drunk and HIGH.  I wasnt going to drink that much but when we walked in i had a shot in my hand, and ppl kept feading me more alcohol and when i thought i was done i had another shot in my hand.  It was fun.  There was this kid there named justin whom i proceeded to make out with the whole night...OOPPPSSS, it was fun but the next morning i had hickies all over my neck, needless to say my mom was pissed.  But the whole night was fun, i've never seen megan that drunk before it was hillarious.  Thanks for the great time!!!

School. . . I had to have my mom drive me back to school sunday night in this huge snow storm and it was really scarry and ppl were going off the road into the ditch.  I was super excited to meet everyone back up at school again.  Everyone was in a really good mood and that made me even more happy.  Although it is fun i really miss everyone from home and those who didnt come back. . Lin-z, Amy, Brad, Steve, and brad and dan.  Hopefully i will see them all really soon.  BUT erica and bobbie from home are now down at western so that makes me happy!!!  Im glad they are here and they always are welcome over at my place.  Hopefully i will see my friends from home soon, cuz they better come visit.

Now that ive gone on and on i better go and get some shit accomplished!!!"

"event","its been toooo damn long since i have written in this and i know i am going to forget everything that has happened to me since tuesday but i will try and do my best!!!

so its been pretty quiet durning the week and mass chaos on the wekends.....class, homework, food, homework, more class, eat and then fun cuz classes are done for a week.

Then on thursday i got this really awsome phone call from LISA YOUNG!!!!  like holy crap i cant believe she called me i was so excited.  Her friend was going to come and pick uphis sister and then she rode with him and got to stay the night...she is so cool and i really miss her and i wished she would have come back but shit happens and at least she got to come and visit....WOW i totally went off on this huge ass tanget sorry.....moving on.  so she comes and we wanted ro smoke but her nor i had any but then i called matt and he hoocked us up with his friend who had some....but he totally screwed us over we wanted a dime sack but when we got there it was so small but all our other hoock ups fell through and we really wanted some so we took it anyway.  then matt said that he would walk us down and say bye but he had to take care of some shit and said he wou;ld be right back but he never showed up so im screaming his name down the hall and everyone was coming out of there rooms and btw if u are looking for matt on floor 5 its pretty damn hard cuz there are like 560 matts that live there.  so then we decided that we would smoke and walk to 7 11 for old time sakes.  so on the way we get totally lost and dont know what to do....we finally make it there and get some food.  then lyn-z called me and asked if we wanted to go to a party and chill for a while and we say sure and then we dont have to walk all the way back to the room.  but when she comes to pick us up she accadentally made a illegal turn and the cops pull her over and gove her a ticket....i was freaking out cuz i didnt know why the cops were there or who they were pulling over...i was f'n scared.  then no one felt like going out so we came back to the room and ordered food and watched half baked with lisa, lisa, me lyn-z, and brad untill we all fall asleep

then on friday night we all went out and hit a few parties but then some crazy shit went down.  so i went with steve to his friends hous to chill out for a while and get blown before we went to some parties.  but on the way i got pulled over by the k-zoo police DAMN!!!  and i totally had had a beer before we left so im freakign out.  so he comes up to the car and is totally shining his flashlight in my eye and then over at steve.  i had 2 beer in my purse and then we had weed in the car also.  so he asked for my shit and i only had my drivers lisence cuz the rest of it was in the room so that made me freak out even more.  so he goes back to his car and had to be back there for like 15 20 mins. he finally walks up to the car and tells me to slow it down and then gets back in his car and haulls ass out of there.  i was so scraed.  then we met up with some ppl and partied for the rest of the night.  and all the parties we went to the first keg was fo free...gotta love gettin  drunk for free.

then i sat i went home for a while and got to see my parents and steal some food and chat for a while.  then i met up with nick and we chilled with grandma for a while.  then we decided to go get some food cuz the race was canceled.  then we met up with laura and angie and mark and went to this work party and chilled for a while.  i got pretty buzzed but really want feeling the atmosphere and then nick called crystal to see if they were at kevins new place which is like a block away from where we were.  i felt bad cuz i was invited tot he first gathering and it was nice but i just needed a change.  so we drove over to crystyls and chilled with her, nick, me, laura, jamal, kevin, angie, and greensbra.  we drank and smoked and pretty well got fucked the whole night.  but the funny thing was when i was climbing down the latter i ran and tripped on the cement block they had and whipppppeeeedddd out and busted up my kneeeee.  it was pretty bad.  then it got late and we drove bak to nicks house and passed out but then i had to be back up at 9 to meet my parents for breakfast....it sucked getting up.

alrighty im sure i missed a ton of shit but this is already flipping long enough.  ill try to finish this when i get a chance some time soon.  Have a fun week of classes and dont put a Betta with a frog cuz it will try and bite the leg off the frog ;("

"event","Sooooo many ppl have asked me why i named my last entry the way that i did so now i will explain cuz i totally forgot to write about that.  SO we were at meijer bitching the ppl out about a gift reciept but then we stopped in the entrance to look at all of the postings for thing for sale and then i see a pamplet about helping your child to stop bed wetting.  So i grab one and while we were out in the parking lot i was holding up the sign yealling at ppl in the parking lot and cars that would pass by.  it was pretty funny...

Then on sunday this creapy girl that got kicked by a horse moved onto our floor.  She is really mean and crazy and we tried to be nice to her but she totally bitched us out and was super mean.  She is one of those ppl that looks like they could make bombs on there free time and then blow up a school or DORM!!!  so the other day lisa and lyn-z and i were on our way to dinner and she goes i quote..""you need to move this dresser for me"" and we are like wtf and just kept walking by it was so funny.  Then when we got back she was giving us really dirty looks and then left for class.  so while she was gone we moved a dresser in front of her door and ran.  i have never been soo mean in my entire life.  and i guess she started to cry and the whole drom knew about it but it was funny but so so so mean."

This weekend seem to be like a roller coaster ride.  On thursday night lisa and jenny left for home and then i was going to go home friday afternoon........

all that i can say is that things didnt work out the way that theywere supposed to.  On thursday night i was waiting to get some weed from this girl but she never showed up cuz they went to GR to get some shrooms and forgot to leave me the stuff so i was totally bummed out.  then matt im's me and we decide that we should just get totally drunk out of our minds.  It was really fun untill i strated feeling really really dizzy....i think it was the vickoden that i took before i drank so i was totally shit faced the rest of the night.  It was really funny cuz matt lives on the 5th floor of garneau and it brought back so many memories fom last year.  While out smoking i met some girls that lived on the 4th floor and then a whole shit load of people came back to his room including this shaddy guy who i ened up ""hanging out with"" and whne i woke up in the morning not only did i still feeling drunk but i had like 6 hickies all over my neck.....so im freaking out and am pissed cuz now i cant go home to my mother like that.  but i had already promised that i would bring matt home so i was screwed.  at breakfast dana and i went to go get coffee and we see this kid steve who asked who the hell did that to me and i just turned really red and laughed.  SO we leave for home and then i met up with laura, angie, mark, and nick and hung out for a while.  then we went to the 19 wheels concert, with relapse and some other bands but the best part of the night was when nick got a autograph for me singned by non other than DOUG the hottest base player around....;)  Then we drove around down town Gr for a while and went past diversions a gay bar and the ghetto where we saw a lady that was shot in the face and a fire truck had to come to the rescue.  but back to diversions....i love going past that place cuz its so funny.  mark has a gay roomate so we all want to go with her and mark to the club it looks like sooo much fun!!!  So then it got to be like 3 or 4 or so so i went back to nicks to spend the night.  I was glad that i got to see nick and crystal for a little while.  i hope that they will come down for a party.  the we went to BW3 omg it was so flipping good.  Then i had to drive home and then i just hung out her and did some shit and played card with ppl for a while untill i wanted to pass out and go to bed.

Then lisa came back and she brought sheppards pie!!!!1 Holy crap it was good....her mom is the best, the rest of the night we went to meijer and now are doing homework SAD!!! but i had an average weekend but hopefully i will get to go home and see people for a longer time.

I woke up around 10 and did some reading and then got ready for lunch with the girls.  We ate in our caff and it was actually good.  it was chicken nuggets and baked potato and then some other really yummy stuff.  Then dana and i walked to the bernhard center got informantion about studying abroad. It sounds really fun but im not sure if i am going to be able to do it or not.  I will have to do some thinking about what the hell i am going to do next year.  Then i went to class and finished up the rest of my homework and went to dinner with steve and the girls.  Hes so funny and reminds me of my friend jess.  then dana and i walked over to the rec for a step class/.  It pretty well kicked my assssss.  But it feels good to be working out doing that again cuz now that i am back at school i eat so flipping much.....especially when i am stressed out.  Then we walked back to the room and said hi to the people that were palying volleyball outside.  It was 1st floor vs. the 3rd floor.  We kicked their butts.  Then lisa and i were watching tv and the phone rings and on the other end was a frat boy asking me to describe my feet to him and then he asked if anyone has ever complimented them.  i went along with it and laughed the whole time and then i asked if this was for real or if one of my friemds was just screwing with me and then the phone went dead.  It was so funny. but for know i have to go and read for my damn lit class.  Nigty night"

He had a whole outfit sword and shield to match.  He also had cups to clink together to make the sound of hourse houves.  Then we all went out to smoke and he was outside to and was stopping ppl from coming in the building and driving into the parking lot.  He would make them answer stupid questions like what was there favorite color or what year the building was erected when it said it right on the sign in front of the building.  Then i had to come back inside and finish this stupid paper that i have been putting off for ages but now i finally got it done.

It seemed as though every class that i went to made me more stressed out.  i have over 200 pages that i have to read for some of my classes all before tuesday, 2 posters, 1 group paper, 1 analysis for thursday, modules for math, and on top of everything else i have to remember all this medical termenology that we have to do on our own and then be tested on it every class time....AHHHHHH. This is the first time that i have been able to sit down and relax.  I almost forgot.  Today dana and i went to this hour long kick boxing class.  It was so funny.  Im so uncordinated but was able to keep up.  By the end of the night we were so tired but it feels good to be working out again cuz i have been eating so flipping much now that i am back at school.  We want to go back and then try the step class and yoga ones too.  Im still not sure of what i want to do for the weekend but i think i might have to come home cuz i need to do this poster thing and dont have a printer or fun decorations and i might be going to a rave in ann arbure....that is if timmy ever calls my ass back but i have a feeling that i will not be going to that cuz i havent heard from him.  but im not sure about plans for the weekend.  But for now i'm going to go and sit on my ass and watch some TV and do some reading."

"event","so this weekend has been pretty quiet.  We have just been hanging out with the ppl on our floor and smoking alot.  Its pretty fun but i still am not completly happy and i dont know why.  I guess its because i dont know what i want to do with my life. Part of me really likes going here and hanging out with all of the people and living the college life but the other half of me is so flipping lazy.  I hate doing work like everyone else but i think something in my brain is stopping me from concentrating on the important things.  AT this point i think that i am going to force myself to do well in school and not be lazy and in the mean time think about what i really wanna do with my life.  So far the only plan that i have is to make it through the next year and then if we get an apt then i might just be a part time student amd work the remaining days.  Cuz right now i judt feel like i am being over whelmed with things.  I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!!!!!  I need to sit down and think about what is important to me......Oh well anough of that today the girls and i went downtown and walked around and got familiar with our surroundings.  We went to national coney caffe and got some really good hot dogs but they werent as good as yesterdog :(  then we walked around and did some shopping but i didnt get anything cuz i only have 19.85 in my account......hopefully i will get my refund check soon so i will no longer be poor....but for now i think that i have to get my job back at MEIJER EWWW.....oh well for now im off to ths football game...GO BRONCOS!!!"

So im like WTF....so to waste time in between classes lisa and i rode the BROWN bus to east campus.  It was pretty fun the bus driver kept giving us dirty look cuz when we went to east campus but didnt get off we just rode it right back to our room.  The reason we did this was to see how long it takes to get there cuz lisa doesnt want to have to drive all the time for work.....we also made this really cool song about riding the bus.  The i went to a few more classes and then went to get dinner with the girls.  Every day we meet more and more cool ppl.  Tonight we hung out with the guys down the hall and then smoked some pretty decent weed with them.  We didnt know where to go cuz our old smoking spot is all the way over by valley 2 :(    so we decided to do it in this kids car.  it was so funny cuz there were students and a ton of ppl walking by...oh and it was still sunny out.  But then we are doing it for a while and it starts to get smoky and as this kid goes to take a hit we see ppl walking down the hill right by our car.  but come to find out it was one of the kids ex-girlfriends and some of her friends.  at first he wasnt going to talk to her cuz he didnt want to let the smoke out........but it was so funny she knocked on the window and he rolled it down a little and all the smoke floats out into there faces....i almost died it was so funny.  The we all hung out for a while and then we got something to eat ...imagine that?!?!?!  Then when i was witing for my esay mac this kid Im'd lisa and was telling he rhow cute she was today.....at first i thought it was funny so pretended to be her and said a bunch of shit but he so knew it wasnt lisa but it was amuzing all the same.......i just have one thing to say to that person.....""keep your hands off BIOTCH shes mine""......just kidding.....oh and TIMMY what the helllllllllll....call me, u dont just forget a girl cuz she leaves for cllege :( !!!!!

At first i passed them and they looked really familiar and then they kept trying to figure out who i was.  and in the end we all knew who each other was. For those of u who haven seen ""little jody"" let me fill u in. SO this summer me and my frieds had the habbit of drinking alot so one night we did this and then met some ppl to play pool.  so we are all hanging out and i decide that i want to go out and smoke so i made laura come with me.  and while we were ouside these guys come up to us and we start to talk and before we know it we are seeing ""little jody"" in all his glory....so if u dont know what i am talking about then you dont need to know at all......LOL it was a funny night."

"event","WHEEEWWWWW!!!! i made it completly through my very long and boaring classes of the day.  Im glad that i got through it all and now im going to stop talking about it.  OOHHH the other day nick and i went to the Kzoo speedway to watch the induro race and a car flip.  it was the biggest mullet fest that i have ever seen, i swear every white trashed trailer park living dirty family and there brother were there, and of course nick and i.  so the whole time i couldnt stop laughing.  i just kept yelling out all this random racing shit and making car noises and soon everyone in the stand was yealling along with me.  It was sssooo fricken funny and then the family behind us was being really mean to there boy cuz he droped his sucker and i kid u not the dad said to the boy...""WAH Wah if u dont stop your crying im going to call u a WAMBULANCE!!!"" i just busted out laughing after i heard that, so of course nick and i made fun of it the rest of the night.  And of course it was all rainy so we had to share a white trash bag to keep from getting wet, how more white trash can you get? Hopefully my OT class will go well tomorrow and then i can start to get my job going down here and then catch up on some homework....tomorrow should be busy.

"event","So im back from my very first class of the semester and i dont know what to think!?!? Im really excited to be back in the swing of things but im so damn lazy.  I hate having to deal with all of the bull-shiot of homework and papers and discussion groups and study hall and the library and all the stresses that come with school but when i think about last year i remember how much i loved doing those things............I guess i will just have to stop being lazy and JUST DO IT and shut the hell up about it.............."

"event","So its really strange for me to be writing in one of these journals again.  Hopefully i will write something interesting down so ""you"" whoever you may be will wanna read it.  So im really really super excited to be back at school again GO BRONCOS!!!  This week has been pretty uneventful but fun none the less.  My roomate lisa and i have been hanging out alot and catching up on all the fun times we had this summer.  So far we have met some really cool, on our floor and building.  The other day we tried to sneak liquor into the dorm and almost got caught.  We went to meijer and LYN-Z bought us some stuff with a really shitty fake ID that she changed the date with a sharpey but it worked so we were happy.  She will be 21 soon so we dont have to worry about her getting in trouble any more.  So we pull back into the parking lot and she says she is going to carry in a case of beer and will will carry in the other stuff in the bags.  So we just planed on going in right through the front door but then we see ben our RA walk out so we have to go through the side door.  So i walked around the corner to see if he is coming and then they were going to bring it down to our room after i gave them the clear signal but then ben pops out of his room and starts to walk around the corner where lisa ans LYN-Z were waiting.......so i distraced him by asking this totally lame question about the activity that was going on during the night but the really funny thing was as i was distracting ben they ran the other way they clinked the bottles together making an extremly loud noise we laughfed about it for hours after.....i cant believe that we didnt get busted.  Thats the sort of stuff that has been happening this week,really funny stupid shiot.  Classes start tomorrow so i think that i am going to head to bed early.  And as a side note i just wanted to say that i am really happy and glad to be back at school with all of my friends :)"

"event","So my show Dames at Sea is coming up and you should all come.  I play Joan the sassy and brassy chorus girl!  It's kind of a different part for me (even though I connect with it a lot better than all those ingenues haha).  For those of you who know Ari, she is also in at as Ruby.

It's June 15-16, 22-24, 29-30, and July 1

If you want ticket info: http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/departments/auxiliaryservices/summerdinnertheatre/index_1024_768.htm

Also, if you don't want dinner and want to pay much less and don't mind sitting closer to the back, you can come at the door an hour before curtain and get in for $10."

"event","My Catholic audition went great!  A lot better than I was anticipating.  I did screw up my dance UNBELIEVABLY but it was because the floor was linoleum and super slippery and they were said it was ok they knew it was really slippery.  I also messed up my monologues a bit but I think I covered that alright.  Jane liked my cat dissection monologue.  She said she did the same thing with a squirrel when she was a kid...disgusting...  She was cool, I liked her.  They were a lot friendlier than any other college audition I've been to so far except maybe the theater director at OCU.  They were about as friendly as he was.  I think they liked my singing.  Hopefully I get in because I really really liked the school a lot.


I think I'm going to Songs For a New World auditions on Wednesday, but I have to see if I can actually get there because my dad's going on a business trip and we might only have one car.

And then Penn State next Saturday.

sheesh!  So many auditions!

On the way to the metro we passed a street called no joke Morning Wood Drive.  hahaha I have a twelve year old sense of humor."

Saturday January 21 
at Damascus Performing Arts Center (9815 Main Street, Damascus, MD 20872)
at 7:30
Tickets are $15 at the door and $10 in advance
call 917-251-7866 to reserve tickets

We're trying to raise $3000 to pay for heat at DPAC.  For the past few years we've been dancing and performing in the cold which is not very fun.  I know $15 is a lot for a concert, but it's really for a good cause.  The show is really cute and there are a lot of great and funny numbers.  The first act is all songs about the cold and the second act is all songs about the heat.  It's fun.  So come see it!  :-)"

In the end, you need to choose the next 5 people to be tagged and list their names.

1. In order to sleep at night, I have to cover my face completely with the blanket and stretch my arms above my head.

2. When I want to practice singing, I put the tracking cd in the stereo in our computer room, turn it up really loud, and then go in the bathroom and sing.  The accoustics are better and I can see my facials and what I need to work on.

3. Right before I become relaxed, my brow gathers and I purse my lips so it looks like I'm thinking about something really hard when I'm actually not.

4. I crack my ankles.

5. I have to at least get my hair wet if not wash it when I come home from school or else I feel dirty.

I tag Amanda, Shana, Corri, Hannah, and whoever else wants to do it."

Like I really liked listening to the singers and crap.  I think my favorite was Being Alive sung by the multitalented Bill Brown with Sam Kelvie singing As Long As He Needs Me in a close second.  beauteous...  euphonious to my ears!  I'm trying out vocab haha.

It's still like 1 degree in there.  Please have heat tomorrow...  pleasssseeeeeeeeeee."

"event","So basically rehearsal was a train wreck today.  Just...everything went wrong.

And I probably look like a huge bitch now because I got pretty frustrated with the music.  Because people are leaving out rests and crap and the song sounds like its in the wrong key and everything.  And I've heard that song about 29830810928390850989021838058098219389081230912849085908098234 times so it baffles me that people don't get it.  But I guess I can't really think that because a lot of them have never heard it before.  I guess I assume since I know the song so well and I know a LOT of people who know the song as well or better than I do, that EVERYONE does which apparently is not true.  hahaha

It got a little better when we danced.  Although it was not terrifically exciting walking around in a circle for 10 minutes straight.  

Me and Danielle kept saying it would have been SO much more productive if we did blocking today.  

but whatever...  it'll come through.  I think part of it is that MTI hasn't sent the score yet.  bah

I still needa know what time to go to DPAC tomorrowwwwwwwwwww.  If no one knows I'll just show up at 7:30 and hope there's people there haha.  It better be warmer than 2 degrees too.  haha

I love it when I have totally WONDERFUL conversations with people and you talk about EVERYTHING.  and like you feel like you've connected with that person.  I love that.

hahaha that last thing was bordering on cryptic.  Oh cryptic posts...  I have a love/hate relationship with them.

hahaha sometimes I read over my entries and I have no idea how I got from talking about one thing to another.

Ok question: do you think it's worth it to study for the SATs?  Because I have them in a little less them 2 weeks and I've been studying vocab and doing practice tests for critical reading and crap and then Mr. Fleming pointed out to me that there's really no point because it measures aptitude and you either know the word or you don't.

I got a head start on my outline for the research paper.  I'm nowhere near finishing it ,but I got started which is good right?  I might change the order though actually.

I kind of hope there is school tomorrow ,because we're supposed to do some more blocking for Fiddler and I don't want blocking to last any longer than it absolutely has to.  I hate blocking.  If I ever direct a show I think I'll just tell the actors to go wherever they want.  Although that would be a disaster lol.

Amanda got Yente obviously!  haha YAAAAAAAAAAAAY!

And Danielle is Hodel so maybe now Keith and Bill will actually come to my shows since they know THREE people in it lol.

The cast is...interesting.  In the true spirit of a GHS show Tevye is hispanic.  joy!  And he apparently has a thick accent too.  Amazing...

I am cast opposite of Jason Waters.  uh...  fun.  hahaha a black Russian!  bahahahahaha

and of course the Mike Luu DOES get to be an asian jew (he's Perchik).  SWEET!

I'm very excited.

"event","Fiddler auditions were fun.  I'm not really sure how I did.  I think it was just so so.  Nothing really special.  But I had a blast which is rare at an audition.  I usually HATE them but this one was so much fun.

First Mr. Fleming had me read TOTALLY out of my type cast...for Yente.  bahahahahaha.  And of course I sucked ,but I don't mind.  I tried.  This just proves that I am destined to play the boring little ingenue forever and ever and ever.  And then I read for Tzeitel and that's all the reading I did.

It was really nice to see Ms. Berlin again.  She is a really nice lady.  although it kind of made me nervous that she recorded us.  Ah well.  I think singing was ok.  Not my best.  I have a little bit of a cough though.

Then we danced.  And the dance was outrageously simple ,but no one could do it which was REALLY funny.  Like REALLY funny.  It was basically just a grapevine, snap, and turn around lol.  But everyone was like falling over their own feet.  This amused me greatly.

Um...  Amanda's Yente voice was PRICELESS.  I was laughing SO hard.  If she gets that part (which I'm pretty certain she will) she will STEAL THE SHOW.  Because it was seriously SO funny.  

Um then after I just kinda hung around doing crazy stuff.  Like hitting each other with a GHS Trojans thunder stick (????) and belting out Sh-boom at the top of my lungs (and Stephanie Fillmore joined in!  AWESOME!)

Phil sang I'm a little teapot which is really cool.

I also could care less whether or not Huck Finn is taught in schools.  Why must I write a 10 page paper on it?!  WHY?!  WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY!?!?!?!??!

He was the COMPLETE opposite.  People are so stupid it hurts me.

I miss sitting with Andrew Breiner and Rick Phillips and Sean Reiley in Physics.  I know that sounds crazy but we had crazy deep philosophical discussions about life and religion and everything.  MUCH more interesting than physics.  Now I sit with these other girls who do their work on time and always go up to ask mr. caretti questions every millisecond.

Everything would be peachy keen if it was summer right now.  Yeah...

"event","Valentine's Day is comming up and we started talking about what true love is in church today.  I know it really has NOTHING to do with God or anything church related ,but it was a really good discussion and I started to realize things.

I think I realized why so many people think teenagers can't experience real love.  Because now that I have a better sense of what it is I realize that there are VERY few teenagers who actually have it.

We talked about the difference between love and lust.  Real love and infatuation.  The definition Kevin gave us of true love was to be able to say I love you period.  Not I love you if or I love you because.

The difference between lust and love is that love is giving lust is taking.  I mean I can think of very few teenagers who don't want something from their boyfriend or girlfriend or crush.  We always want them to kiss us or write us a nice little note or show us off to the world.  Or we want someone to send us a Valentine or a rose or candy.  And most of all we get jealous.  (I know this is all kind of a stereotype and doesn't apply to everyone but I've met A LOT of people like this...)  What I realized today is that's not love.  That's infatuation.  Love is doing something for the other person without thinking of yourself at all.  Even if that means giving him or her up.  Love is being willing to walk 1000 miles without ever expecting a single kiss.  Love is running in front of a speeding bullet to save someone not thinking of your own life and everything you might miss out on.  It's not a box of candy, or a card, or a date, or a love note, or a poem, or holding hands in the hallways.

True love is completely selfless.  I think there are very few people in this world who can say they have that.  Because I really think humans are naturally selfish creatures.  We sort of fall in love with love.  We watch those romance films and keep wishing we had that.  Someone who really cared for us.  I do it myself.  In fact now that I think about it I realize it's a huge fault of mine.  I constantly mope about how I don't have anyone.  

Kevin told us that his definition of true love is the same as the police man's motto: to protect and to serve.  That makes a whole lot of sense to me.

And I don't really know where I'm going with all this ,but I wanted to share it with you.

I guess what I want to say is don't jump too quickly to that conclusion that you're in love.  When you can willingly step in front of a bullet to save a friend, boyfriend/girlfriend, or crush THAT is love.  

So with that said, just enjoy Valentine's Day for the cheesy hallmark holiday it is.  Eat your candy because it tastes good not because it says I love you across it.  






I have a feeling this entry is gonna piss people off lol.  But oh well I thought Kevin made a lot of sense."

"event","I was in a really good mood today because of Gilmore Girls yesterday and Luke and Lorelai KISSED and it was perfect.  lol.  TV is brainwashing me.  I got really happy over fictitional characters on a tv show.  WEIRD!  But now I'm pissed off because they're starting back at the beginning of season 1 which makes me mad.  I should really watch the REAL show and not the reruns.  I think I will.  Although I'm sure it's all downhill after Rory and Dean had sex (??????????????????).  It's gonna turn into a soap opera I can see it comming.  Aww its a shame.  That show is SO funny and now its ruined by sex.  

So we had an assembly today about African American History Month.  It was pretty cool.  I found it pretty funny that we have one random white guy in the school gospel choir.  lol!!!  They did a play on Martin Luther King and Malcolm X ,and the actors were good but they didn't project or annunciate so I had no clue what they were saying.  And it lasted forEVER.  And it was just dialogue so after a while it got painfully boring.  

But then our whole schedule got thrown off from that.  We ended up missing third and fourth (YES NO FRENCH!) and then 10 minutes off of every class in the afternoon.  That was nice.  It should've been no school today.  In my opinion...

I'm auditioning for Fiddler on Thursday.  But apparently no one is auditioning that day because they wanna see the powder puff game.  lol I picked Thursday because I'm impatient and I know if I wait for the audition I won't have to wait as long for the cast list lol!  Like everyone who I've talked to is definately not singing a song from a musical.  So everyone's gonna be singing like pop and stuff except Mary Beth who will be singing her boring high soprano showtune ballads.  I want an uptempo.  I'm sick of ballads they're boring.  Although I guess ballads are kind of appropriate for a show like Fiddler on the Roof.

I miss my bapa friends.  Especially the old ones (from like Gershwin to Little Me) who've like disappeared.  Where are youuuuuuuu????  

Let's go see a movie.  like the good old days.

Although I'm pretty sure that will be ignored...

bah.  oh well."

"event","I think I succeeded in teaching myself about 3/4 of the modern world curriculum.  I think that should be enough for me to do well on the exam.  lol.  Last night I was trying to study and I was looking at my review sheet and I was like crap I know even less of this than I thought I knew.  So spent like hours last night and this morning looking up the stuff in my book I didn't know.  So yeah...  lol

Now I just have to teach myself french.  oh boy.  I needa look up explorers and find out the plot of that book we read.  how fun.

But I'm going to the mall later because I need to take a break from studying.  really bad...

So last night I watched this rediculous show called Desperate Housewifes.  And there's something strangley...I don't know...magnetic about it.  I'm drawn to it and want to watch it again next weekend.  But it's SO bizarre and just like...rediculous.  I think it's meant to be funny...but I'm not really sure lol.  It was nuts!  

ok...  the end..."

I never knew I was addicted to lj ,but apparently I am ,because I almost went crazy from not having ljs to read.  I tried to read xangas but it wasn't NEARLY as satisfying.  

So anywho.  I bought the dvd of Carousel.  It's a pretty good show I guess.  kind of...depressing.  Although I'm ashamed to say I did laugh when Billy died.  Hey it's not my fault that the guy playing Billy died VERY unconvincingly.  He just kind of reached for Julie and then flopped over on his side.  and...it was funny...  lol

So I'm very excited to sing the Girl in 14G with Keith.  awesome song.  

ok I'm done...  now I have to go read lj entries!  yaaaaay!!  :-)"

hoorah!

Except I am VERY dissapointed that two of the people who I really liked at the auditions weren't accepted.  Like seriously as excited as I am to have gotten in, I LOVED my audition group.  *sigh*

Sometimes I get a little annoyed at bapa and their new audition for the summer shows.  You used to just sign up.  That was really nice...

bah!

So last night I went with my dance class to this REALLY nice arts center in germantown and we did a salsa workshop.  It was SO much fun.  Like I really liked to salsa.  It was so cool.  Except our teacher was like this creeeeeeeeepy hippie lady.  Like she seriously weirded me out lol.  But there was this guy there who was like columbian or something so he knew how to REALLY salsa and he was teaching me little things. 

lol he wasn't supposed to though.  Like the teacher would get mad at him.  And this one time he was like ""here give me your hand quick before she sees!"" and we did this crazy meranga move that was so freaking cool and finished like a split second before she turned around lol.

salsa is so much fun.  it gets me super excited for our West Side Story dance which will be HOTTTTTTTTTTT.  lol.

oook yeah I'm done."

"event","I have something philosophical to say about livejournals and xangas.  But I'm too lazy to type it.  Maybe I will later.  

I think if musical theater doesn't work out I should be a philosopher.  Then I can sit on my butt and just think about things all day for a living.  Sounds good to me.  :-)  Except what kind of job could I get with that?  lol.

My teeth are feeling a tad better.  Except one of my bands snapped in 3rd period and it hurt like crazy.  It's like you know when you're trying to shoot a hair tie at the person sitting in front of you (I'm such a 12 year old...) and you snap it on your finger except in my mouth.  

The people still haven't called me down to fix my schedule.  I've never actually done that before so does anyone know how long it usually takes them to call you down?  Cuz I put the paper in like a week ago.

So I think the ballet part of our West Side Story dance is SUPER hard.  And everyone can do it except me.  boo.  :-(  I just stand there with a blank look on my face and attempt to follow Camille and Tracy but fail...miserably.  lol.  ah well I'll practice.  Also I can't do fouette turns which poses a problem.  And I can't practice them because the only place big enough is my basement and the floors are concrete.  

I wanna do a musical again.  I think this is the longest I've gone without a musical.  Annie ended in October so that's...3 MONTHS.  *GASP*  Although I had a play in there so it wasn't that bad.  But still I need a MUSICAL.

Also I miss my bapa friends like anything.  I wish I could have a giant party.  But a party at my house would definately not be fun at all lol.

Ok yeah so I should go read Huck Finn now.  blegh."

I'm worried about getting into Carousel.  I love the summer shows so much.  And I am *really* hoping to get in.  I'm actually hoping my whole audition group gets in because I loved them.  Like really they were the coolest people.

ignore this.  It's just so I don't forget later:
1. Jesse
2. Mina (Nina?)
3. Andrea
4. Kelly
5. Jackie
6. Julia
7. Josh
8. Eric
9. Mary Beth

ummmm...  So yeah.  I will be sad if I don't get in.  :-(  I feel like Richard won't cast me. I acted like such a baby in Chicago.  That and I knew almost nothing about the show.  Keith told me last year they didn't cast anyone who had never seen Chicago the movie.  I hope they don't do that again.

GOD MY TEETH HURT

ok maybe I should go work on review packets.

My dance audition was really good.  I messed up a little bit, but for the first time I felt like a real dancer.  It made me very happy.

lol and I told Veronika about pointe.  lol it was like this

I also hate french.  I hate Ms. Shayt.  I hate the stupid massive button she wears that says ""Bonjour!  Francais s'il vous plait"" with a happy face.  GOD!  STOP BEING SO HAPPY STUPID BUTTON! FRENCH SUCKS!

Today she like killed me and Linda with rediculous IMPOSSIBLE questions about our powerpoint on Samuel de Champlain.  I'm like how are we supposed to know this?!  She asked us ""what were some problems with Champlain's maps?"" in french and expected us to answer IN FRENCH.  um...  what is there to say to that?  I mean I didn't look at his maps.  I just assumed he didn't have problems.  And she kept going with these impossible questions most of them me and Linda didn't even understand.  And if we did understand we had no CLUE how to say the answer in french.  And then she finally said she would have to ask us MORE questions tomorrow because we were running out of time.

GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.  I hate french.  I used to love it in 7th grade ,but now I don't think there's anything I hate more than it.  Next year I'm not taking it.  That's final.

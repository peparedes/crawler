What is EMO?

""    The word has survived and flourished in three decades, two millenniums, and two Bush administrations. It's older than four baseball teams, six basketball teams, four football teams, and two soccer leagues. It's older than five former Yugoslav republics, the last seven national spelling champions, and Avril Lavigne. It's older than most of its fans.

    It's been a source of pride, a target of derision, a mark of confusion, and a sign of the times.

    It's been the next big thing twice, the current big thing once, and so totally over millions of times.

    And yet, not only can no one agree on what it means, there is not now, nor has there ever been, a single major band that admits to being emo. Not one.

    That's pretty impressive. And contentious.  And ridiculous. Good thing too--because so is emo.

    Emo is short for emotional. But isn't all music emotional? Well, yes, or at least it should be. Originally, emo was short for ""emocore,"" a strain of hardcore punk that was notable for its obsession with feelings (as opposed to politics, anger, and smashing stuff up). Then it started to be applied to bands that weren't punk, to fashion trends, to sad-eyed kids in the back of class. It's always been mildly derisive, a term used by haters and critics to dismiss something that's overly weepy, self-indulgent, or unironic. Every generation that loves emo bands simultaneously rejects the term while claiming owership of it--meaning even if they won't admit they love emo, they certainly will say how much they hate everything that's been called emo since them. But still, no one knows what it is.""

"event","<span class=""blacktextnb10""><font face=""verdana"" size=""2"">A group of professional people posed this question to a group of 4 to 8 year olds. <br>
<br>
What does love mean? <br>
<br>
The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone could have imagined. <br>
<br>
1. Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving Cologne and they go out and smell each other. Kari- age 5 <br>
<br>
2. Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French
fries without making them give you any of theirs. Chrissy- age 6 <br>
<br>
3. When my grandma got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her
toenails anymore. So my grandpa does it for her now all the time, even
when his hands got arthritis too. That's love. Rebecca- age 8 <br>
<br>
4. When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. You
just know that your name is safe in their mouths. Billy- age 4 <br>
<br>
5. Love is what makes you smile when you're tired. Terri- age 4 <br>
<br>
6. Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip
before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK. Danny- age 7 <br>
<br>
7. Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get tired of
kissing, you still want to be together and you talk more. My mommy and
my daddy are like that. They look gross when they kiss. Emily- age 8 <br>
<br>
8. Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen. Bobby- age 7 <br>
<br>
9. If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who you hate. Nikka- age 6 <br>
<br>
10. Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday. Noelle- age 7 <br>
<br>
11. Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still
friends even after they know each other so well. Tommy- age 6 <br>
<br>
12. During my piano recital, I was on stage and I was scared. I looked
at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. He
was the only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore. Cindy- age 8 <br>
<br>
13. My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night. Clare- age 6 <br>
<br>
14. Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken. Elaine-age 5 <br>
<br>
15. Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford. Chris- age 7<br>
<br>
16. Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day. Mary Ann- age 4 <br>
<br>
17. When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you. Karen- age 7<br>
<br>
18. Love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and doesn't think it's gross. Mark- age 6 <br>
<br>
19. You really shouldn't say I LOVE YOU unless you mean it. But if you
mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget. Jessica- age 8 <br>
<br>
And the winner was a 4 year old child whose next door neighbor was an
elderly man who had just lost his wife. When the child saw the man cry,
the little boy went over into the man's yard and climbed on top of the
man's lap and just sat there. When the boy's mother asked him what he'd
said to the neighbor, the little boy said, ""Nothing, I just helped him
cry.""</font></span>"

"event","Okay so like the evil claw of colleges/my future/azn rentz has come cracking down. It's like everything is boiling down, everything is being warped. It's so messed up and I wish that things were easier, more calming. Maybe Wash U will do it this year. I don't know it's strange and confusing isn't it? Life is exhausting and I just wish things could calm down for a while."

When you can't see another way out you must take the only way out. Not to say that my method was right, but it was my decision. I wish people could just understand that."

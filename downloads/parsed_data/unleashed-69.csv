"event","Well......I have not updated properly in a while, cause I had exams and all I was doing was preparing for them. So yeah now that I have finished I will let you know what has been happening.

My sister had her baby, a little baby boy named Decklan, soooo cute. He is about 6 weeks old now and is really well behaved apparentley. Katie finally got her license so she is able to go around with the baby and stuff as she has a car.

Speaking of cars mine is in the mechanics today to see what exactly is wrong with it. The mechanica next door seem to think that the head is gone but I decided to take it back to the mechanics that have looked after the car most of its life. So yeah they are going to do a written report and let us know how bad it really is. If it is too much repairs needed then I am going to get a new car. Well not nex but second hand and yeah newer then the current one. I dont know what I want yet, so I will decide when I need to.

We went to the red bull air race on Sunday. I got a little burnt (like a lobster), even though I used sunscreen and was under cover most of the day. GRRRRRRRRRRR. It is not as sore as when we went to cervanties. Honestly the air race was not that good (could not see half of it but yeah) didnt seem that interesting. But I did enjoy watching one of the australian jets do a display it was awesome. I broke the sound barrier in front of us and you could see the slip stream and everything. It was awesome.

About Cervanties, We had fun GO THE EAGLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We went and saw the pinacles aswell which was good. Got burnt to a crisp there as the sand reflects aswell so yeah not good man. The weekend was good and going along the beach in cols new car was fun as. 

Yeah about Colin, thats about all he gets in my LJ because I never made it into his :P. So ner!!!!

Anyways should actually do some work.

Bye Bye"

"event","Ummm im watching ET it is on channel 9 at 3-3.30. They are about to show the entire C-Section that was performed on Anna Nicole Smith. Do you think they should be showing this, considering that it is the Childrens time slot on TV. They did warn that itwas uncensored, and the full video, but, it looks like it could be disturbing to some children.

Do you think this is good or bad???"

I other things I am good. Uni is going along really well. I am enjoying myself and looking forward to next year when I start my majors. I have changed from doing an Accounting, Business Law major to doing an Accounting and management. I hope that this will open up more oppurtunities for me as far as job perspectives. I want to get into business consulting so this should help me a bit. The management course covers most of the law stuff anyway so its like I am doing the 2 in one. 

How life is great I am still very much in love with my baby. He was a bit sick last night so he had a restless night sleep last night. He pretty well slept through is but I didnt. I had to get up and remake the bed at one stage which he just slept right through. I am hoping that afetr i have finnished my exams this semeseter I will be able to try and sort out all the shit in the house and make it look a bit more organise. Try being the word to note there.

I am trying at the moment to see if I can download all of the episodes of the force because we keep missing them. So far I cant find them so ill have to keep searching. Not that I have looked that hard yet.

Anyways time for me to start thinking about going to uni.

I have the best family (thats going to expand soon yay!) and I am going along really well at uni. I dont know I am so glad that all the negative influences in my life are not there anymore and all I concerntrate on is the good things. I am only disappointed that I was not allowed to stay in bed and cuddle col this morning because I had to come to work :(. But you get that ill just cuddle him later. Tonight I am going out with my best friend Amanda for a girls night out. Dont know where we are going yet but hey we will decide when we get there. I might go to the casino see what happens. 
Anyways must off and do some work.

"event","Im back at uni now...... I dont know if this is a good thing but yeah i'll find out soon. I am doing management, finance, economics and also information systems. I have to say that so far my fave lectures this semester are my management and information systems ones. I am yet to meet the finance one so tonight I shall know if I like them or not. In other news my sister is getting fatter and fatter and it was really good to go to her mock baby shower the other week. The reason I say mock was that it was only because her best friend kelly was going back to ireland for about 2 months and incase she was not back before kt had the baby she wanted kelly to be there. Yeah I am so in love with colin at the moment. I dont know why I just love him heaps. Even though he has been rejecting me to play world of warcraft of late (:P he does not reject me I just take what attention I want behehehe). Been playing lots and lots of outdoor tag as we have got the new and inproved guns which are more then heaps of fun. It's good to play against people who are getting quite good at the outdoor scene. The best bit is that it is really building strong friendships with the darklight leagues. We play agianst and fight it all out on wednesday nights in the arena but because we are hanging and enjoying the outdoor games in between games there is a lot more fun. People (except for a few unsaid pains) feel more like they can walk up and chat to whoever. But saying that wednesdays are coming a bit harder when you have team captains who are 32 acting like 2 yr olds. Its just a bit like stupid. If your team aint there on time then tough the game starts without you. But yeah im over it now. :P. Anyways I might go to the shops now and get something to eat and also get my passport photo done (for my new bank account hehehehehe it's cool when you get student ID with a bank account).

"event","He was complaining about me not going home with him on the night that I met him (even though he asked me to). Hrmm. So I say to him I think that an important part of me liking Colin for who he is, is because I got to see a side of someone that I didnt like. I wont go into who this person is but he betrayed me A LOT during the weekend in question. And I think I fell for Colin a lot more because I saw that he was one of the very very few decent and honest guys that are out there. If he doesnt say it to your face he doesnt say it at all. Also, those who a while ago said he is all an act, They know NOTHING about Colin. It is not an act but merely exactly who he is. Honest, Upfront and straight to the point, no beating around the bush (unless he is in the bedroom :P).

Just a quick note before I go I HAD THE BESTEST SEX LAST NIGHT.. Yum!

"event","Ok so lots to talk about so im going to try and be quick (lmao like that is going to happen).

So first things first! I passed all my units at uni YAY! It is soo good to have that pressure off of my back. I was really stressing about it. I didnt do as well as I thought I would but you get that I still passed ok. I am going to really work hard at it next semester and make sure that I have no doubt that I pass. I got two Passes, a credit and a Distinction. The distinction I got in my proffesional Communication class which is not a surprise cause like it was all about talking and giving speeches and well I could talk forever it runs on the family. 

Another thing cograts to Jody on getting engaged. And also for making your 1 year. It makes me think I have lost count how long Colin and I have been going out for. I mean I can sit there and work it out and what not but like I cant think about it straight away I have to work it out. But yeah we have been going out for over 14 months now and I dont see us stopping anytime soon. It really is nice to know that there is still atleast one decent man around in the world still. Cause he is you know. He does not treat me like shit. He looks after me when I need looking after. And the one thing that I like him for the most is that if I seriously sat down with him and wanted to talk about things he would sit there and listen and be the best pillar of support I can have. He really is a decent man and I feel privliged everyday to know that I cuddle him at night no-one else. The best bit is that I fall in love with him over and over again everyday. He makes me smile all the time and I am quite happy that I have found myself a great guy. Its funny to think that I met him on the Internet. See internet romances do work. And well the sex is bloody first class so I am not complaining on any part.

In other news my sister is like blown up like a balloon at the moment. She looks sooo cute with her big tummy and stuff. Pitty she is still a bitch. LOL!!

Anyways must off and make a coffee for the workers.

Ok so life is really really good. Infact it is better then good. I am starting to sort out the house and I think that it is going to be really good when it is finished. I hope I can change the bedroom back round again aswell. Poor colin putting up with my changind moods and rooms. All my stuff is starting to look a little more organised but after tomrow it will ALL be organised. 
In other news I am still waiting for my uni results which I am hanging out for. I think that I have passed everything but you never know. I dont want to be over confident but yeah. I have learnt a good lesson but, Dont stress about the exams because if you are not going to pass you are not going to pass. Stressing about it will not do you any good. I really thank colin for his support and encouragement to do really well. He has shown me that uni is important and all that but dont forget to have fun. I really hope I get what I want from this uni experience. 
My sister is starting too look really big and fat. It is quite cute and what not. 
Im going to go shopping maybe tomorow or this afternoon to start buying christmas presents and put them on layby. Cause they are having a huge toy sale and i'm going to take advantagd.
Anyways back to work.

"event","Like life is good at the moment. I am happy like really happy. Probably the whole reason I am so happy is that fact that I have moved out of home now and am living with Colin. It is soo good. I never knew that just having keys to the house could change the way you live your life. More often then not if I get home before Colin I will clean the house and make it all nice for him when he comes home to me. Then I can study and show him lots of attention without having to worry about cleaning up. I have to go shopping this afternoon but so that I will have things for the house.
Apart from that my sister is doing really really well. She is getting all fatty now it is soo cute. I am look more and more forward to being an aunty everytime I see her. 
On a bad note I lost my mobile phone..Where I do not know all I know is that is it goned. It is soo annoying because I cant be contacted and what not. But all is good because I am stealing my mum's old phone for a few weeks until I can afford a new one. I think that I am going to get another flip phone because I like them. They are cool. OK.
As far as Colin and I go. Everything is all good and peachy (I dont know where that came in it just sounded good at the time ok). I absolutley love him to death and he is my baby OK.
Uni is going along really great, I am passing with flying colours on everything now. I already know that I have passed an entire unit this semester. And with a HD (High Distinction) across the board. It is sooo cool to know I have passed. I got my first assignment back in one of my classes with a HD and I get my second one back this afternoon.
And also if I seem to disappear for a few weeks it is because I have exams and am studying. I will let you all know how I do through the rest of my classes when I know OK.
Anyways time to make coffee's and run away from computer.

"event","Ok so last weekend on saturday acctually colin and I have been going out for one year. OMG its like, has it been that quick. It has been one of the most interesting and entertaining year of my life. Sure i lost a few good friends, but meh. I now realise they were not my true friends but i was mearly being used by them. A true and real friend sticks with you through what ever you do. but it is all good I am of the beleif that what ever you give out will come back to you three fold so I hope those people get what is coming. Ok onto me and col, I LOVE HIM LOTS!!#@$%#!!! i didnt think that i could but almost every day i find something more to love about him. It  has been happening alot more of late, i think i should stop it because it gives me the feelings of a new relationship all the time. I also love the fact that i can still turn him on by looking at him and he to me aswell. I think i like the power of that i have and that is why i make sure i turn him on with it. So yeah my life is good. This weekend it is off to rally and hopefully next weekend i will move all my stuff to col's. I am really looking forward to it, well having a key anyways cause i think that that is the only difference at the moment. Uni is going really well i know the dates for my exams so i am starting to get all worried about them but i am not letting myself if you know what i mean. All my assignments will be over for the semester by the end of next week. This is a really great thing because then i will stop stressing about the exams and start absorbing information. it is probly only stress about assignments more then anything. I will have to ask col at a later date if he noticed ikm stressing because i have really stressed out in the past and no-one has noticed because i dont act different but merely it is all in my head. So yeah all is good. now i must leave you all and go away and to bed maybe because i have a test in my lecture tomorow at 6 so yeah. Anyways Byes"

So all things are going good with me and col. I think while we were over in QLD i found lots more love for him and am greatly looking forward to moving in with him. I only am waiting now for the cars to be sorted and i'll have mine. I would move in right now but i want my car so that I dont rely on colin. I absolutley refuse to rely on him for anything now because i want to make me moving in work and that may affect things. (scuse me a second while i play with my boobs for colin's visual satifaction). ok now that i have completed that...... so im slowly getting things at colins prepared for me to move in. I just want everything to start clean so that i can keep it clean basically. I even cleaned his computer room (yes i know shock horror). And cause he has his new couch now we split the old one and half of it now lives in the computer room (which is where i am sitting doing my work) it means that i can just hang round col and also do my work. OK so like i think im obsessing of col a bit hey but i dont care cause i have more to say about him so suffer hehehehe. On the weekend he helped with carting concrete and omg did his arms and shoulders look just soooo yummy *drool* (again). It was good to shan and el and all them on the weekend to look forward to playing poker with you guys in the future.

"event","I thought i would open something up for debate.....

I was listening to the adds on the radio and listening to what they say about premeture ejactculation. What is it exactly??? I am of the thought now that all it is, is when a man can pleasure someone enough for them to get excited and do what the body naturally does in reaction and tighten. Then the man ofcourse in turn gets mass pleasure and gets off basically. I think that if you are a person who enjoys sex for the partnership thing then getting an orgasm is not that important. I dont see why they make a big deal about it on these add's. My beleif is that all the ""nasal technology"" does is reduces the sensitivity of the penis and i dont agree because for sex to be satifing both partners have to enjoy it right? I think the stress comes from guys that can not pleasure females in any other way then to have sex with them, which if that was the case then the sex would be lacking anyways. And also i dont know about any other girls but like come on who would not prefer 20 minutes of exciting fast paced sex then 45 minutes or more of really boring and slow sex, i know which i prefer.

And up until i was with colin i did not have someone to do that with, it feels nice to be wanted (not just in a sexual way) and be cuddled while you fall asleep. I ended up putting colin to sleep cause he had to get up early and stuff so i listened to him sleep for a while (cause i was still kinda hyper) and that really calmed me down, Knowing that i was looking after him almost by making him sleep (and no i did not hold a pillow on his head til he passed out OK im not that mean) and i kind of felt like i was watching over him. On sunday i went home and stayed there the night and the next day i read his post about how he missed me and who would make him his hot drink (which i thought was quite funny) but it also made me think about how much i look after him and the little things that i do that i dont think twice about acctualy mean quite a bit to him.... dont know.... just makes you think when someone is snoring his guts out beside you."

Well it has been a long time since i did a proper update so hear goes. Colin and I are good i think i am in trouble now but thats all good hehehehehehehe. I am an evil girlfriend. 
Christmas was good got to see all the people who mean the most to me. My christmas day was very very busy. Wake up at 5:30am to open pressies at home as i have a younger brother and we still wake up to presents. Then at about 8:30ish i haeded off to colin's parents house to wake all them up (lazy people) and give them all my presents that i had for them. And then i want to my nanna's place for more opening presents and lunch (which was nice). after that i went home and had a nap and went to my uncle bobs place for dinner and then i headed to colin's house where colin and i gave each other our christmas presents in private. Colin got me the best present which was a playboy watch it was soooo cute. 
Then on boxing day we went to a x-box lan in which i sucked but had lots of fun.
Anyways i must go back to sitting here and doing nothing like i have done the whole day (apparently) lol.

My sister has jet setted off to ireland, i am driving her car around at the moment to keep it running, she is said to be coming home in about 2 years so i am going to save for a car in that time. My mummy had an accident and the horse bucked her off she got a broken ankle to boot. Ummm i have a new bouncy bed :P (Azz and Sarah will know). Its my mums old bed frame with a new mattress, i think it is comfortable i cant remember cause i slept soo well in it. Although it is a queen size bed and i felt lost in it without the other person in with me. So yeah my life has been pretty busy running around for anf after mum and being the ""older sister"". But something that i have been thinking about of late is that i am happy for all the situations of my freinds past and present. Because just of late everyone seems happy so its good. Makes for a happy life and weeeeeeeeeee. Anyways it is too late for me and i am off to let my mind go nuts (ok well more nuts).

I miss him but so go figure.... with him being sick i just want to look after him and protect him all the time. My weekend OMG what a weekend. On friday i went from work to darklight to meet colin and went to play games only to be disapointed by the fact that the DDR machine was not working :( cry........ Then col's bro came and we played a few games which were hell fun and smithy his friend should be coming to leagues with us this week so that should be fun. Its good because it means new meat which is kinds mean but you get that, i am kinda getting sick of the attitudes of some players so i am hoping they will find some other people to pick on. Anyways after that colin and i went and got dinner since the kitchen at darklight had closed and they would not cook us food. Then we came home and basically colapsed in bed. Saturday was shopping with my sister and my mum and my aunty which was fun. I bought some chrisse pressies so yeah im starting to get there i have decided that i have to large a family to buy for and think of gifts for. Saturday night was of to stans with the little of colour boyfriend of mine. Stans was good met some nice people and enjoyed hanging out, we left early cause coling was not feeling well. After a pit stop to chundder on the way home i was driving and the last time i looked at my watch was about 3.30am before i got to sleep. I couldnt sleep knowing he was sick but i got a good part of my book read that night so its all good. The next day was rest and that was about all my weekend. Anyways must off and away. Love you all.

"event","Tonight colin and i had a very weird night i swear randomness comes to mind. He picked me up we dropped daddy off at the rubididub and then we came home and pretty much straight away we both fell asleep on colins bed. We slept there for about an hour i would say. When we woke up we got ourselfs together and then went shopping at innaloo. Colin bought a poker table top setting and anti-monopoly board game which looks kind of fun to play but a bit different. And then at my request we went and had HJ's for dinner which cause it was my request i paid for and then we came home and snuggled for a little while. I just had a shower and i havent shaved my legs in a while so i decided to do that tonight, my god my legs feel so damn good. Sorry excuse me while i play with my legs .... a lot. I have also decided that i need to buy a new bikini for summer due to the recent increase in anatomical female bits of mine. Apparently according to my aunty i have pregnant boobs at the moment. I was a little scared by the thought until i realised it is just the pill that i am on changing my body to how a female's bpdy responds to being pregnant. I have also decided that i am going to have to start working on improving my tummy cause it is getting a little bit tubby, but not fat. Its kind of hard to explain how it is without actually seeing it when i am relaxed. Thats peobly because i am skipping my period because the pill allows me to do such things i ussually get a bit bloaty before my period anyway. I just remembered what i bought today some new socky's pink ones...so did colin but not pink his are black (very manly). And also i read through my old LJ posts from like about 3-6 months ago and man was an outwardly bouncy and happy person back then. I still am but i prefer to more do it in person and be all happy for those who i see in person. And i had a thought today i was thinking about stuff and remembered the first time i met cara (dont ask me how cara got on my thoughts but yeah) and the first night we met. Do you remember sitting there and abusing the shitters (omg colins word nooooooooo im talking like him (that is almost ground for a break up you know when you start talking like each other)) out of each other. I think that is what i miss about the summer and all the partys i went to was the hanging out with friends. Colin and i have decided to go to Damo's ""Shin-dig"" on the 19th so should be good to catch up with him giving i havnt seen him in yonks. On a more sadder note i am starting to get a bit, i wouldnt say upset, but more iffy about my sister going away. For those of you who dont know she is moving to Irland for about 7 mnths at this stage to be with her best friend Kelly, who is over there with her partner. I am really happy for her that she is going because she is going to have a great time and i know she is talking about going and catching up with her ex in germany so yeah see how things go. I know her ex loves katie and wants to move to australia to be with katie so yeah i hope if they get back together they will be happy. I think i am just gonna miss having my big sister around to bug the shit out of all the time. Oh and i am no going to be going to New Zealand with the family in february so yeah that should be fun. Anyways i think i have gone on enough for now i shall update again later i am sure."

If anyone was offended by such post, feel free to bring your complaint to me, but I guess I can pretty much ignore it as I haven't changed - I've always been like that. So the usual arguments about person changing etc etc won't work. Pretty lame I think that so many people have gone at Chloe for that, when in fact it was me that posted it - I guess all Chloe did was write it, but hey, a lot more goes on than anyone knows, and we definately keep that to ourselves...

"event","According to figures release by the UN this week, there are 40 <B>MILLION</B> people in the world infected with AIDS. These people are going to die if there isn't a cure. Even if there is a cure, will the people who can't afford it die too? I don't understand why AIDS doesn't get more press.

I don't even think I want to know how many people are HIV positive and still not infected with AIDS. Dan, did I use the lingo right?"

"event","I'm torn on what to write about. My day-to-day experiences? My thoughts and goals? Politics and Current Events? Deviant behavior? (I think at least for this first post, I'm going to just start writing and stop when it feels right.)

I think one thing I'll definitely do is include comments on my comments in ()'s. Like above.

One of my friends at work, and hopefully friends after we don't work together anymore, is getting divorced from his wife. I'm not married nor do I have any interest in getting married in the near future. Finding someone I could be happy with would of course be great. Anyway, in one of our talks, he talked about how there's the man his wife knows and he detests and the man that he is on the inside that she has never and will never see. Once they separate, this other man is going to cease to exist.

I had a good talk with my best friend earlier. We caught up with each other and had a really good coversation. Thinking about it now, for the last year or so we haven't talked about where we're going or what we're planning, just what we're doing and where we've been. I got a lot of things off my chest that I haven't shared with anyone else in months and so did he. It reminded me of why we've been such good friends for so long.

With both of these things in mind, I've realized that there have been many times when people have said they think that I'm two or three different people and they don't know the real me. Whether because of social, family or professional relationships dictate it, it's not always appropriate to reveal everything. It's not that I'm deceiving people and also not that I'm two or three different people, I'm all of them. The obnoxious drunk, the stay at home chilling out to music guy, the person who's occasionally dying for some culture and many more. I feel the need to let some of my friends know more about me because after being on my own for in England and then backpacking by myself for a good year without feeling the pressure of my role in my circle of friends, I have changed. I think I'll touch on that theme when I'm grumpy sometime.

There are some things I might talk about on this journal that you've known about for years or were totally in the dark about. No, I'm not gay or depressed. Realistically, I'll probably just post links to stupid websites. I think a lot of this journal is about my need to feel important. I'd like to think I lead a pretty interesting life and I'd like to have something to remember it with. Cya soon."

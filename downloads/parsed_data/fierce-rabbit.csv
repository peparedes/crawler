Been having a lot of theatre dreams lately. Not ""actor's nightmares"" - mostly actor's dress rehearsals. Very busy and involving ornate costumes. I have very small, mostly non-speaking roles but am having a great time.

Also dreamed last night about finding an injured baby black bird, very fluffy and very frightened, but he quickly settled in - most likely provoked by hearing, in my sleep, the 3 newest finchlettes in the aviary, screaming, ""FEED ME THIS SECOND OR I WILL DIE!!!""

Then I was awakened by happy dogs licking my face, ""WAKE UP MOM!"" (yes, all animals yell everything enthusiastically). I felt like Snow White with 4 Prince and Princess Charmings, ""You found me!"" ... without coughing up any nasty poisoned apple bits.

So. All that's a pretty good start to a Saturday morning.

Now for a little breakfast, a little ""Ocarina of Time"" and a lot of house cleaning."

"event","Don't let USDA privatize chicken inspection!

Three chickens per second.

Under a new plan proposed by USDA, that's how fast inspectors would have to conduct quality control inspections in poultry factories -- six times the current rate.

Worse, USDA's proposed rules privatize these inspections, letting the industry police itself by replacing highly trained USDA food inspectors with poultry facility employees who have no required training.1

Salmonella in our meat and poultry makes nearly a million people sick every year in the US -- it's our number one cause of food-borne illness. USDA's new plan could make the problem even worse, and we have just days to stop it.

"event","Watching the American Corporate Aristocracy ordering the police to act violently against the masses, watching our corporate-owned government indulging in torture, permanent imprisonment without trial, declaring personhood for Corporations while declaring citizens to be non-persons, working to restrict free speech and in general neutralizing the Bill of Rights while making itr sure that neither moral law nor legal strictures and consequences apply to themselves - in other words, seeing, as we have throughout recorded human history, a tiny minority arbitrarily declaring themselves to be superior, more deserving than the rest of us, yet again attempting to establish monarchy, aristocracy, plutocracy, un-elected rule over the overwhelming majority. This is exactly what the Founders sought to prevent: an undeserving class of sociopaths who is unaccountable to, and feeds off of the work of, the rest of us. This is why the Constitution, particularly the Bill of Rights, exists and why we have such things as inheritance taxes why we have the kind of regulations that the Bush Administration stripped away. Fortunately, there is nothing these would-be tyrants can do to destroy the rapid-fire forms of communication that are now available to the masses, and the more brutal the tactics become, the faster and larger the revolution grows ....

"event","<i>""...it is important to realize that being GLBT itself is not a risk factor for suicide. Rather, the negative treatment that many GLBT teens endure can lead to suicidal feelings.""</i>

I can't stop thinking of Asher Brown's suicide along with what Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered youth  have to go through in the 21st century when we should be more enlightened. It's hard enough for non-G.L.B.T., dealing with self-image, peer ""issues"", family relationships and everything else without also being surrounded by people telling you that you shouldn't be allowed to marry the person you love because that's not really ""love"", that's not a ""family"", that you shouldn't be allowed to adopt children or teach in schools because just being who you are would be a bad influence on kids, that, ""HELL NO you can't have a gay-straight alliance at school because that will allow you to believe you're okay."" And all of the hate rhetoric filters down to non-GLBT kids who see it as permission, maybe even a mandate, to terrorize any kid who is the least bit different.

Some of these kids are getting it at home, at school, in church - it never lets up. How do those kids pull together the hope, keep from being overwhelmed with despair until they can make it to adulthood? 

One thing I think we can do is pass around information and pay attention. If they are fortunate, there is a group like <a href=http://www.lambda.org/youth.htm>LAMBDA</a>. If, where they live, they can get to uncensored internet, there is help online: http://gayteens.about.com. There are role models like Dan Savage: <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IcVyvg2Qlo>It Gets Better: Dan and Terry</a>. There is also a toll-free national hotline for teens: 1-800-246-PRIDE.

This is, regardless of how some people try to paint it, quite simply a human rights issue and, while I've decided it's a waste of time and effort to continue passing along political opinions and links, I'll never be able to shut up about basic human rights. Never. I will harp on this until the day I die. It may well be my last words."

"event","I don't remember my parents ever restricting my reading as a child. My dad dealt with his embarrassment over my love of comics by going into my room a couple of times a year, finding my stash and tossing it and he'd probably be horrified to see the stash I have now, but he didn't forbid me to read them. 

I walked to the library a couple of times a week. It started out in one of the apartments in the complex I grew up in, then, when I was in high school, it expanded to a big, beautiful building of it's own across the highway. I forgave them for plowing under the land where my dad and I hunted night-crawlers and Momma and I picked berries - it was worth it! And, by the time I was a teenager, we weren't picking berries anymore and my dad had given up fishing for golf.

When I wasn't hiding in trees, doing stunts on my bicycle or roller skates, watching old movies on TV or writing my own TV shows, I had my with my nose buried in books. By the age of 13 I was reading Robert Heinlein and Ian Fleming, with nary a comment from my parents. Probably because they usually had their noses buried in their own books. 

Had I known about a banned books list when I was a kid, I probably would have made it a goal to read every book on the list. As it was, the only list I knew of like that was for Catholics. I would not have made a good Catholic because the minute they told me not to read this book or see that film, I would have wanted to check it out to see why it was so controversial. 

These days, I find myself at the computer less and less and reading books more and more. It's a lovely, rediscovered addiction."

"event","We took Kaylee on a late night walk, cross Church street and see a chihuahua and a pug trotting down the street. All by themselves. No leashes, no humans. So we try to calmly catch them and get them home. The chihuahua was having none of it. The Pug was a little more submissive but ultimately wouldn't let me pick her up. Chihuahua heads the other way down the sidewalk and the pug nonchalantly trots into the street. Skip runs into the street with Kaylee to try to stop, or at least slow, traffic - even with the narrowing of the lanes to one each way, people drive Church street like it's the Indianapolis 500. We manage to herd the dogs to a big hole in what must be the back fence to their yard and the owner appears, frantic. Apparently they haven't had money to get the fence fixed; she was talking to her son at the back door and the dogs ran out. Skip, being the kind of guy he is, offered to go over and put up some mesh over the hole tomorrow. 

Too much excitement for one evening."

"event","Yesterday I developed a flood of squiggly, thready ""floaters"" in my left eye, followed last night by a weird white flash that looked like a lit-up light switch flipping up and down in the far corner of my eye. As this started about an hour and a half after my thyroid biopsy (had one last year, which was negative, expect this one to be the same), we called the endocrinologist, who said that it's not related. The we called our GP who said that it could be related, but to wait and see what happens. 

<lj user=galbinus_caeli> contacted a friend of ours who is an eye surgeon to ask if we needed to go to an ER or see a specialist. He called us back, asked about the symptoms and related health issues, then explained that it's normal for people to get ""floaters"" and flashing lights in their eyes in their 40's, 50's, 60's and up, due to <a href=http://www.lasersurgeryforeyes.com/lasereyesurgery/lasikvisioncorrection/eyeproblemseyedisorders/vitreousdegeneration.html>the vitreous in your eye pulling away from the retina as we age</a>. After the ""flasher"" started we thought we should call a specialist and the Nurse, reassuringly enough, said pretty much the same thing as our surgeon friend, adding analogies about Jello pulling away from the side of the bowl and wallpaper (the retina) tearing and how you didn't want to getting water behind it because it might come loose. The Nurse is also a big Shakespeare fan, and a fan of English history - especially Henry VIII (""I can name all the wives!"") which presented an opportunity to tell her about the <a href=http://www.shakespearetavern.com>Shakespeare Tavern</a> and their upcoming run of <a href=http://www.shakespearetavern.com/index.php?/performances/show/henry_viii_and_anne_of_the_thousand_days_in_repertory>Henry VIII & Anne of the Thousand Days in repertory starting 9/12</a>.  

In any case, I have an appointment with a retina surgeon next week to make sure it's nothing serious and I'm just glad that these things are hitting me relatively late in life and, though annoying, are generally not all that serious. Lucky me!"

"event","So I go in for my ultrasound of my thryroid. It was scheduled as an ultrasound. That's what the visit was supposed to be for. The Dr. asks ""How long has it been since you've had an ultra sound?"" I say about a year. She says, ""You sure it hasn't been 2?"" I haven't been seeing her that long, but I don't say that. She looks it up and, sure enough, my last visit was July, 2009.

I tell her that I am having difficulty sleeping because my husband is out of the country. ""India, in fact. Chennai"" I say in an enthusiastic and friendly manner.

""Mmm"" she says.

I tell her that my GP did a full thyroid panel and, based on the results, recommended increasing my Synthroid and that I had been following his recommendation. She gets VERY upset. ""Are you shaking? Is your heart racing?"" ""No"", I say. She says, ""You've lost 15 pounds! That's because of too much Synthroid."" I tell her I started running in April because I'm feeling much better. She says, ""Well you can't just be increasing your Synthroid just because it makes you feel better! There are long term consequences!""  So then she sets me up for a blood test and tells me they will call me to set up an appointment for an ultrasound. WTF!!! I say nothing because you cannot talk to this woman. 

Still trying to be friendly, and thinking maybe I had been offensive by implying she was from India I ask, ""Are you from India?"" She smiles and says, ""Yes. The NORTHERN part."" As if that is very important. And that sense of entitlement and arrogance completely explains why she treats me as she does, and why I can't talk to her about anything.

Thus proving that people are just people everywhere.

Good old Dr. Seuss summed up the human race best in, <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh1qWZWNGGE>The Sneetches</a> - ""Stars upon Thars."" I clearly need a new endocrinologist."

"event","It's been awhile.

Getting organized, little by little. I've learned the best place for my poli-snarking is twitter. For the most part the only political things I post on Facebook are the few things that a large section of my FB friends would be very interested in (unless you consider ""animal adoption/abuse activism"" to be political, which I don't). 

Been keeping up my training for the <a html=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peachtree_Road_Race>Peachtree Road Race</a> next Sunday and hoping I can just finish the thing in the 1 1/2 hour time slot allowed without passing out from the heat. I'm Pansy - extreme heat and I do not do well together, and as they probably won't let us run naked.... My waist has only gone down from 31"" to 30"" since I started using the Wii late last January but, when I measured my hips a couple of days ago to order a dress off Ebay, I was delighted to learn that my hips have gone from 42"" to 39""! Yay! Running seems to work for me, though I may not be very good at it until the weather cools off ... assuming it ever does cool off ever again in the Atlanta metro area. 

Working hard on <a href=http://www.thenewdepotplayers.com/?p=347>THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL</a>, directed by Jay Tryall at <a href=http://www.thenewdepotplayers.com>New Depot Players</a>, which opens July 16th. For the next three days I'll be hitting lines, music and choreography, trying to get completely ""off-book"" on everything by Monday's rehearsal. The singing has been intimidating but with my voice teacher <a href=http://www.mrjohnjones.com>John Jones</a> patiently shepherding me through it.

Little by little, I'm making progress."

"event","Sometimes I wonder what my dad would have to say about the current political situation, but then I realize he would figure out what my position was on any given subject and choose the opposite position because the man loved nothing more than a rip-snorting argument. My mother always refused to argue with him so he started arguing with me when I was a wee thing. For years I thought this was just normal, to get into big arguments about politics, religion, history, whether Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck was more cool. It was only a few years ago I realize how much I really hate arguing. I like earnest discussion. I really love venting with friends who agree with my viewpoints. But I really hate personal, knock-down drag-out arguments because people - including me - believe what they want to believe. I've gotten better about shooting my mouth off, but Daddy raised me to have a hair-trigger mouth, so it's hard sometimes. He should have been born Jewish and spent all of his time in Yeshiva because I never met anyone else who loved argument for argument's sake as much as he did. Well, maybe my youngest son, Randy, who reminds me so much of Daddy sometimes that he could be his brother rather than his grandson. Peas in a pod. it makes me wonder about genetics, because Randy was only about eight years old, when Daddy died, so Daddy couldn't have had that much influence. 

Sometimes I wish I had different parents who raised me to be more normal. Most of the time I don't. As messed up as they were and as messed up as I am, I'm glad they raised me to be weird. to be ""out of the norm"".

Daddy, you were a crazy, wonderful, frustrating, insane, brilliant man. And I miss you."

Our GP also did something my current endocrinologist has yet to do, he did a comprehensive thyroid panel and, according to him, my T 4 is too low and I should be taking about 25 mg more Synthroid to deal with it. *YES* - now I can go to her with not just a vague feeling that a little more Synthroid would be beneficial, but the opinion of my GP. So, for the next three days I will take the extra Synthroid, see how I feel and call her to discuss this with her and report what happened when I took our GP's advice.

Onward and upward!"

YOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED: I will be participating in next Sunday's FREE recital for John Jones' voice students, March 14th, 3pm-4:30pm, at the beautiful ""Church of the Epiphany"", 2089 Ponce de Leon Avenue at the corner of Ponce de Leon and East Lake Road, about one mile west of Decatur.

Boring personal update: <lj-cut text=""behind the cut""> The last month has been kind of a Romeo & Juliet costumed blur, which I've enjoyed, mind you, but it takes some getting used to. I was very proud of how I was pacing myself, not overdoing, taking care of my health. Then a week ago Sunday I inhaled sawdust from the shop and spent the next week battling off a sinus infection. Tuesday I had food poisoning (probably from the leftover Chinese food I ate the day before) which left me dehydrated. Wednesday I was up early for an R & J student matinee at Whitewater High in Fayetteville. My voice lessons seem to be helping with more than just learning to enjoy singing (which was the goal) because I was pretty much able to project in spite of the ""froginess"". I had my voice lesson that afternoon, which was rewarding (it always is - working with John Jones is a very zen experience) even though we had to keep it low key and not overwork with the vocal ""issues"". My stomach was still ""iffy"" so I didn't eat a lot. Thursday I started prep for Friday's scheduled colonoscopy. Because no anti-inflammatories were allowed since the previous Friday, no vitamins/supplements since Wednesday and the dehydration, the prep ended up being pretty devastating. It got so bad at one point that I had to stop for a while to hydrate, then started drinking the prep every 30 minutes, chugging diluted juice (the prep made plain water taste awful) between. Friday morning I got up to take my Synthroid, drank some coffee and water to finish the purge and was allowed nothing else after 8AM. The procedure was a 1PM but, as requested, we were there at noon. Fortunately Skip can do his job anywhere he has a computer and WiFi so he was able to work in the lobby while waiting to drive me home. As expected, everything was fine. As much as I joked about wanting to eat a big mac when I got home, my stomach was really unhappy from what it had been put through this week, so we kept the food simple and not too much. I think I gained a little weight from the coke and ginger ale I drank for the food poisoning and for ""clear liquids"" during prep. It also coated my tongue - how do people drink so much soda pop? A little is OK but it very quickly gets overwhelming. Saturday & Sunday I was still exhausted but made an effort at eating, re-hydrating and taking my regular vitamins and supplements. Today I'm trying to get back on track with my routine and exercise, doing my wii weigh-in and yoga. I also wrote in my journal (which I was surprised to note I hadn't done since last November). I plan on taking Kaylee out for a gentle run/walk this afternoon. I also have a new ""Hal Leonard"" Guitar instruction book I'm excited about starting today.</lj-cut>"

A very belated birthday to Neo_Prodigy (like 2 weeks late?). I know I've missed others as well....

<a href=http://www.shakespearetavern.com/index.php?/performances/show/romeo_and_juliet1/>Romeo & Juliet at the Shakespeare Tavern</a> is going great! Many are saying this is the best production of the show they've seen in 18 years - it's really nice to be part of that.

<lj user=galbinus_caeli> and I have been Wii-ing along. I'm losing about a pound and a half a week, which is good.

Holding my own, healthwise. I like being able to help with the change-over for student matinees and back to ""normal"" - couldn't have done that a couple of years ago. Speaking of which, I'm again working up to try to run the Peachtree Road Race (which I keep wanting to call the ""Boulder Boulder""...different 10K/different state). I'm training with the Wii (though running in place is not the same as actually running, it helps) and planning on participating in a couple of 5K races and then 10Ks before that.

Lately I've been wanting to let my natural hair color grow out enough to wear it very short and spikey (now that I know I can get away with it) and getting new headshots, but I'm not sure what that would do to my ""marketability"" - on the other hand, I'm not doing any film auditions right now (mostly because I don't have time) so does it really matter.  In the meantime I'm going to phase from red to brown. I'd like to grow my hair out but the thought of bothering with that while I'm still dying my hair is daunting.

Voice lessons are going well. John Jones is a terrific teacher. I'm finally getting some things that teachers have been trying to communicate to me for years. I've also picked up a nice, inexpensive beginner guitar and am really enjoying trying to teach myself to play. After trying to learn banjo (which I've given up on for now but will get back to after I gain some confidence with guitar) it seems really easy and instantly rewarding. Next on the list is *finally* teaching myself to juggle. This summer I hope to pick up a unicycle and learn how to do that. Adding to the resume."

Mind you, this S.O.B. has made himself literally filthy rich by conning the ignorant and gullible out of food they should be spending of food and medicine for themselves and their families. I have no doubt that the reason he says such hateful things about the victims of disasters is he's afraid his ""followers"" will give their pennies to people such as the victims of the Haiti earthquake instead of to him.

I'm fascinated by how he uses African Americans to shill. He always has.

Good gods, there is a couple dressed as a hot dog and mustard. Is this The Price is Right? ""COME ON DOWN - INSTEAD OF ME GIVING YOU MONEY, GIVE ME YOURS!!!"" If, as Robertson's Bible says, his god made man in his own image, Robertson's god is a dick. 

At what point does one have ""enough""? Why are some earthlings (sorry, they are ""humans"") driven to grab more and more and more and then change the laws so that they can grab even more? Is it a game? These flabby, useless physical specimens who couldn't survive without their wealth gleefully grab everything in sight, spitting on the poor and the suffering around them, and want to pass it down to their worthless spawn. 

Robertson is nothing more than a squirrel in human guise. Wait. No. That's an insult to squirrels because squirrels work hard for every nut they gather (and they're entertaining to watch while they're doing it!). If Robertson's excess wealth rotted or took root, then there would be justice because his worthless spawn would have to start from scratch and all of our children would start life on a more equal footing, as the gods obviously intended. As it is, the Robertson Pharisees are only interested in establishing another monarchy, another caste system based on the bankrupt, anti-American notion that their ill-gotten gain ""proves"" their god loves them more than the rest of us and has put them in charge. This is why they want to destroy public education, or at least riddle it with magical thinking - so that we slaves will obey our worthless masters and their worthless spawn.

Jesus would whip Robertson and his ilk clean out of the Temple and we need to do the same. We need to change the laws to ""un-define"" corporations as ""persons"", we need to limit the sizes and influence of corporations and we need to get the money factor out of public elections. We need to destroy the government/corporate path to unearned, undeserved wealth and idle aristocracy and return our elected officials, once again, to servants of the people, rather than the other way around.

It's the American Way.</lj-cut>"

Yes, Skip took photos and yes they will be posted sometime today. 

My children gave me a Wii Fit Plus - me muchly *heart* Wii Fit Plus. It says my ""Wii age"" is 71 and my balance sucks. So far I suck at everything except the meditation game, but it's fun anyway so it will be something I will stick with, as opposed to going to a gym.

For my 50th birthday, Skip gave me a pair of broadswords. For this (my 60th) he gave me a crossbow (which arrives tomorrow). He says that for my 70th he'll have to give me a horse (joking - I wouldn't have a horse unless we had large enough property where I could have him close by and a regular part of the family - yet some kind of ""horsey"" expedition - that would be cool). I have *got* to put together one of the many Dragon Con personnas/costumes I've thought up so I can tote some of this equipment around

Skip's birthday is in February, so to celebrate both of our birthdays, we plan on going skydiving sometime in March or April (depending on work/family schedules). I'm terrified but I can do it. I may leave a long urine trail behind me in the sky...or all over my poor tandem person.

Our bamboo was trimmed and the pond cleaned out, as well as tree limbs removed, wood chopped up and removed, etc. - Yay! We need to put a figure/thing outside so I can work out with the swords and crossbow. Maybe it can be back by the vegetable garden where it can double as a scarecrow.

The DHEA is helpful. It's not a huge thing. It's as though there's a line and a couple of feet to the left of it is depression, pessimism, ""I'm too stupid, I'll never be able to do this so why try?"" and a couple of feet to the right is optimism and ""OK this is frustrating but if I'm willing to work at it I can do this!"" I feel like I've got myself back, consistently, after a loooooooooooooooooooooooooong-assed absence.

I've downloaded the information needed to start veterinary technician school. Right now I'm planning on enrolling for the fall 2010 semester.

Our foster cat went home on Monday. He is such a sweet, incredible animal we were sorry to see him go, but his Mommy needs him more than we do. And Tuesday we picked up a crazy 6 month old little boy who is already making us laugh. His body is growing too fast for him to get used to it and he's comically clumsy. Last night, while inspecting the toilet, he fell in, tail first. Didn't hurt himself, wasn't upset, just confused, but Skip and I laughed so hard we couldn't breathe.

And, to top it off,today I'm excited to begin full-blown rehearsals for my 6th turn as Lady Capulet in Romeo and Juliet. About half of the roles are all-new actors so it should be a LOT of fun!"

I finally got around to making an appointment with my endocrinologist for Friday. I hope she listens when I tell her that I've been having days where I can barely move, am too cold (beyond the weather) and depressed for no reason. She hasn't seemed really sympathetic so it makes me nervous.

I also made the appointment for to have my breasts smashed on my birthday.

We didn't get to see Avatar last Saturday because they were sold out at the Mall of GA IMAX, so we're going to try to go next Monday. 

After reading Elizabeth Bear talking in her livejournal about writing in bed while covered with her dog and cats, I'm going to try working on my script in bed on the Netbook tomorrow covered in dogs and cats. I have a feeling it might be the start of a beautiful thing.

I've been reading Jane Goodall's THE TEN TRUSTS, which is tough because it gets into how cruel our species is. I've known about the horrors of factory farming for some time (I'm really, really glad I've been a vegetarian for 20+ years as I can't help but wonder if all the cancer and other crap we're dealing with is karmic ""payback"") but the book gets into practices in that as well as ""entertainment"" that just *hurt* to read. I don't know why our species thinks it's so ""special"" because we really are horrible, self-centered creatures, using our opposable thumbs, wonderful imaginations and speaking abilities for all the wrong things. For all that, we really don't exhibit any more foresight, too often less, than any other creature."

Braved the icy roads yesterday for a very productive voice lesson yesterday with John Jones. My lessons and practice at home are very Zen, meditative. As singing has never been relaxing for me in the past, that's a beautiful thing.

Running lines in my head for R & J tonight I realized that, after six turns at Lady Capulet, I know them all without having to work at it. Nice because, well, it's nice to have a memory that works - which it didn't so much do for a while, which was scary - and I feel a bit of connection with actors from the Renaissance and the Restoration, perhaps understanding a little how they played the same roles over and over in repertory.

"event","<lj-cut text=""What does it mean to Know Peace?"">Many of my Facebook friends give Christian ""shout-outs"", often in conjunction with something good that's happened to them or because they are trying to remain stalwart when life is not going well. These ""shout-outs"" are, in turn, usually echoed and/or supported by their Christian Facebook friends (and, depending on the sentiment, by non-Christian friends, such as myself).

The thing I'm mystified by, therefore feel a need to address, is this insistence that ""knowing"" their particular angle on ""God"" means ""knowing peace"". The idea of ""No God, no peace...Know God, Know peace"" is a purely evangelical notion for which I see little or no supporting evidence. I am particularly mystified by my FB friends who insist that they wish they could share with their non-Christian friends (the term ""non-Christian"" often includes people who consider themselves Christians, just not adherents of a particular Christian sect) on one day while discussing their non-relenting depression and other problems the rest of the week. How is this ""peace""? Are they not deluding themselves. Said self-delusion is what eventually led me away from organized religion altogether, though not away from ""spirituality"" (which, as I define it, is a term having to do with ""looking at the bigger picture"" where humanity is concerned, thus can include atheists and agnostics).

People ""know peace"" by hanging out with other human beings of like mind. This works great when people are willing to accept central tenets without looking any further. My big problem with the churches I attended was that I spent a great deal of time studying ""scripture"" and ""authorities"" looking for clues as to how to be a better Christian, thus a better person, which lead t questions, which led to people getting upset with me for making them think about things they didn't want to think about, which led to me being ""unpeaceful"" because I was no longer an accepted member of the group.

People can ""know"" this kind of ""peace"" by being a member of any group, as long as it doesn't become contentious and form ""splitters"" or ""factions"" - MENSA (though I know some very smart people who joined to feel more secure about themselves and it only made them more insecure and angry), role-playing-games, improvisational theatre - anything. 

Unfortunately, members of groups like the KKK and neo-Nazis can also ""know"" this kind of ""peace"" and become so assured by their fellows that their tenets are so ""right"" that they end up murdering doctors, bombing and/or vandalizing churches and killing little girls who haven't lived long enough to do anything to offend anyone else by anything other than their mere existence. So ""knowing"" that kind of ""peace"" is not always a good or ""right"" thing.

I ""connect with"" God/The Divine/nature via my deist/pagan practices and beliefs and I ""know peace"" working on a play or film project that I love with people I feel comfortable with, people who ""know"" the same ""joy"" and ""peace"". That ""peace"" isn't there when I am working on a miserable project with people with whom I am at odds (which is extremely rare), just as I ""know"" no ""peace"" when I'm at church. I don't feel the need to analyze the nature of art/theatre/whatever (which usually doesn't happen unless you're working with someone like Jasson Minadakis - which immediately makes me feel like an outsider because then I try too hard to ""be profound and insightful"" like everyone else and end up sounding like a fool), I don't intellectualize acting, I just do it for the love of it. I am often very intellectual about the *material*, the script, the subject matter, but not the experience of theatre - it's a spiritual experience, thus indefinable.


Being at church is, at best, boring and meaningless for me and, at worst, deeply disturbing because I've explored that avenue to spirituality and it does nothing for me. I have no problem with it being profoundly uplifting for other people. I have a dear friend who regularly attends different churches. Though he is gay he even attends conservative evangelical services where they speak against gay people - somehow he is able to ignore the negativity, let it roll away like water off a duck, and get something wonderful out of it. I don't understand that but I certainly accept it. What I don't understand is why people can't accept whatever makes them feel ""peace"" (assuming they're not self-deluded) is not transferable or that other people *cannot* be happy without their version of religion, or that if everyone just hears how HAPPY! HAPPY! HAPPY! and AT PEACE! they are, we'll all ""know peace"". 

Well, yes I do understand it - it comes from not questioning the  core tenets of their own faith and not really respecting other people. It comes from the feeling of belonging to the special, ""secret knowing"" club. Which is just fine as long as your being ""at peace"" doesn't mean you're not out making other people miserable on its behalf.

Humanity as a whole will never ""know peace"" until we all really accept and live ""The Golden Rule"" espoused by almost every human religion/philosophy, as opposed to the KKK, neo-and-classic Nazism, the John Birch Society and every other ""us against them"" philosophy. In other words: we all need to leave each other to our own definitions of ""knowing peace"" and simply focus on trying to be decent to one another.</lj-cut>"

While it's wonderful that Skip has a new job (especially one he likes so much, with people who like him and whom he and I both like) the business trip to India was exhausting for both of us. Lack of sleep lowered our immune defenses and we've been sick since with the crud that the whole world has been suffering since...what?...last August?...but we had been able to avoid up until then.

I was depressed, missing my out-of-state children and grandchildren. Now that the holiday decorations have been put away (all except Stonehenge, which we leave up until the Spring Equinox) I'm feeling a little lighter.

I felt well enough Friday that we hiked the dogs up the street to Hancock Fabrics to buy replacement pillow forms for our couch cushions, a mile 1/2 round trip. By the time we got home it felt like I had sprinted the entire way. I also spent the day taking care of the laundry that had piled up while we've been sick, which meant many trips up and down the stairs. Saturday I could barely move.

Momma's Christmas present to us was to pay 1/2 on a Wii (the other half was Skip's and my present to each other) and we had a lot of silly fun on New Year's Eve with the sports games that came with it and with ""Raging Rabbids:II"", (which was cheap). During the TV season ""hiatus"" we've watched several films, including ""Letter From Iwo Jima"" and ""Shine"", both of which were very moving in their respective ways, and ""Angels & Demons"", which ended up being entertaining because it was so ridiculous.
 
2009 had a few high points (""Wit"", ""Richard III"") and too many low points (the passing of our sweet cockatiel Verona, Skip being laid off, Skip's appendicitis, Kaylee hit by a car and ending up with a broken hip, me in the ER with gut problems). I'm really glad to say ""goodbye"" to 2009 and ""hello"" to 2010."

No discussion was allowed under ""W"", it was always, ""my way or the highway"".They GOP obstucted more than 60 of Clinton's judicial nominees and threatened a ""nuclear option"" to eliminate filibuster by Democrats under Bush.


Sensenbrenner turned off the lights and microphone on Democrats in the middle of a meeting.


Congressman Bill Thomas (another ""family values"" style GOP adulterer) called the police to stop Democratic congressmen from protesting the tyranical way he ran the House Ways and Means committee.


G.W. ""I'm a uniter, not a divider"" Bush and Cheney regularly ignored Congress, the law and the Constitution, doing what they wanted via ""signing orders"" - or often just plain doing what they wanted without Congressional or judicial approval, oversight or even knowledge.


Bush ran the deficit up into the trillions, but now the GOP is suddenly worried about spending.


The GOP crucified Clinton for lying about a BJ in the Oval Office but feel that  we should all just get over Bush/Cheney lying to Congress and the American people in order to invade Iraq, completely without provocation or justification. We're all supposed to just accept Bush/Cheney's violation of national and international laws against torture because their pet lawyers redefined the terms.


Now the GOP is whining about bi-partisanship? Now they whine about bills needing more discussion?


They gutted health care reform and, because the American people want government competition so that they have choices besides the currently available crappy, expensive insurance and they want regulation of the insurance industry, they pretend that American opposition to the gutted bill is American opposition to health care reform?


They sent people out to Democratic legislator's town halls to *prevent* discussion on health care reform rather than participate in or encourage discussion.


They accused anyone who dared to disagree with Bush of ""siding with terrorists"" and claimed that disagreeing with the President was treasonous, but they regularly attack Obama, calling him ""socialist"", ""communist"" and ""nazi"", question  his citizenship and, at their public appearances, regularly tolerate death threats against President Obama.


The Current GOP political machine is made up a collection of bastards who care only about themselves and getting rich at the public trough. They could not possibly care less how many American die or suffer due to lack  of minimal health care or how many American soldiers and Iraqi civilians have died or have been maimed to serve Bush and Cheney's profiteering ""war on terror"".


If the GOP behavior since Reagan has proved anything it's proved that


* ""trickle down"" economics is BS and deregulation is a license to steal. If there is no regulation of corporations they will lie, cheat and steal even from their own employees and stockholders.


* GOP policies invariably result, not in capitalism, but corporate welfare and corporate oligarchy.


* GOP policies invariably result in recession, pushing us closer to depression each time.


* GOP policies benefit a tiny minority at the expense of the majority.


* Republicans spend a lot of time talking about ""family values"", ""morality"" and Jesus while they are clearly not practicing what they preach and the only time there seems to be any demand to remove GOP philanderers from public office is when the ""transgression"" involves homosexuality.


* it's time to outlaw private funding of elections and institute public funding only.

"event","Note: 1/3/2010: I must be feeling better, as I looked at this and though, ""Hassada? *Hassada*? What the heck?"" - so her name (if not her character) has been fixed.


<lj-cut text=""There's a special corner of hell reserved for Joe and Hadassah Lieberman and all those who rule and support the American insurance industry"">""There's a special corner of hell reserved for Joe and Hadassah Lieberman and all those who rule and support the American insurance industry"", along with the rest of the political and journalistic ""warriors"" who've indifferently, passively slaughtered thousands in their pursuit of profit.


My first inclination is always to wonder how someone who is so publicly, devoutly religious can be so cold, calculating and inhuman because my whole reason for becoming a Baptist and then a Mormon, the entire idea behind adhearing to religious practice and dogma, was to put myself on paths that would help me become as good a person as it was possible for me to be. Not being raised in a particular religious faith I naively tend to think this is the only reason anyone would choose to align themselves with a religious group or dogma.


Eventually, however, I remember the hard-learned lesson that religion does not lead people to be better human beings. If people become better human beings it is only because they bring that desire, and that effort and desire is just as powerfully for atheists and agnostics and is often more honest and productive because it is based on reason rather than fear of an abusive ethereal parent. Like guns religion is, in and of itself, neither good nor bad; it is only human action and intent that makes it either.


For people like the Liebermans, the Palins and their minions, religion consists of nothing more than superstitious ritual, depending on Divine powers to make them richer and more powerful. There is no heart, no soul, no humanity in their worship, therefore no ""betterment"", which explains the rampant hypocrisy and scandal among ritually-religious political Conservatives. They serve neither gods or humanity, only themselves. Fear of hell, like fear of the death penality, is not enough of a deterent to evil behavior.


At this time of year, with so many retellings of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, I  imagine the chains people like Joe and Hassada Lieberman have forged for themselves must already dwarf those of Scrooge and Marley and are growing at an alarming rate. I marvel that there has been no friend, dead or living, to wake them up, no ghostly clank or rattle to startle their consciences to simple human decency and eventual redemption. Perhaps they are so far gone in their evil that there's simple no point in it. After all, Scrooge's actions were only selfish and did not actively result in the deaths of thousands.

    Um, who are Joe & Hassada Lieberman? Nothing comes up in a search.

    Joe Lieberman is the Senator from Connecticutt, former VP candidate with Al Gore, who has very strong ties/support from the insurance industry, thus is doing all he can to torpedo health care reform.

    Hassada, his wife is a high profile spokesperson for the Susan Koman Race for the Cure foundation - she also is basically a lobbyist for the insurance industry and doing all she can to ruin health care reform.

    I don't understand how people who used to be so supportive of Medicare, public options, etc., can change so drasticall,y but Joe is apparently really angry at the Dems for not supporting him in his last election effort (probably because he was - and still is- a huge supporter of Bush and the Iraq war). he lost the primary but won re-election by running as an independent.

    Long, long, long story....

I'm sorry, but I don't feel sorry for Tiger Woods' mistresses. They knew he was married. They made their choices. I just listened to one who said she ""loved him"" but when she asked him to give her a house she knew he didn't love her. Give me a break.


Now the media are bringing in psychiatrists to analyze the guy. Here's a clue: he's a guy, with lots of money. While not all guys with lots of money are philanderers it certainly puts a lot more temptation in their way and makes it harder not to be a philanderer. Not that hard to figure out.


I'd say it was because Woods is black, but the national ""news"" media also freaked out over Clinton getting a ""BJ"" in the White House and brought out the psychiatrists to analyze someone they've never spoken with.


white athletes cheat on their wives all the time, so why are Woods' indiscretions so much more horrific? So much more fascinating?


At least Woods didn't go around ranting about morality  and how gay marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage. Where is all the psychoanalysis of Vitter? Sandford? All the other GOP philanderers? I'm personally curious about the psychology of  the GOPer who beat and choked his mistress during sex.



We only seem to care about white guys' sexual activities when their pretty blond wives disappear or turn up dead - or when they are left-of-center politicians - or award-winning filmmakers.



Anyway you look at it, Jon Stewart is right - what has passed for ""news"" and ""journalism"" in the first decade of the 21st century has been a joke.</lj-cut>"

A political blog, in honor of my dad. 

<lj-cut text=""Behind the cut"">

My father would have been 96 years old today. Without going into detail that I've gone into before about his life, let me just say that he grew up dirt poor in a coal mining town in Kentucky and like many poor boys joined the military to escape poverty. He was always ashamed that he never finished school so he read voraciously on just about every subject you can think of, was interested in everything and spent a lot of time thinking and talking about things.


When my folks lived in Burlington, NC, when I was just a baby he wrote a number of letters to the editor (smart, well-written letters!) and ended up in a public, written ""debate"" with a corrupt politician who accused him of ""living on the dole"" because of his WW2 military disability. Then, as now, ""patriotic"" politicians and Pentagon muttonheads tried to cut benefits to veterans and, then as now good people stepped up to the plate to fight for veterans.


My entire childhood I listened to him rant and lecture about the Holocaust, America's treatment of ""the people who were here first"" (his grandmother was from the Mohawk tribe), the Inquisition, Joe McCarthy and just about every other monstrosity you can think of. He was ""pro-choice"" in a time when absolutely no one talked about abortion and even birth control was illegal in some places - even between married couples (which was an important part of what Roe V. Wade struck down, which opponents conveniently fail to mention).


He was far from perfect and I didn't (and still don't) agree with him on everything but due to Daddy's influence, I'm every bit the political nut he was. Along with everything else he was a ""gadget nut"" and, had he been alive to see the ""computer age"", he would have had the most up-to-date equipment, and you can bet your bottom dollar that he would have had a blog and would have had a great old time ranting and arguing - eloquently - probably even with people with whom he was in complete agreement. So, in his honor, I've started this blog.


Eventually, no doubt, there will be those who will try to argue the usual regurgitated ""talking points"" in response to what I have to say here, hence the name ""Pest Strip"".


Happy birthday Daddy. I love you. I miss you.

"event",".I don't really make New Year's resolutions. I tend to make and adjust my goals year round. Still, with the changing of the year, and especially with me turning 60 soon, it seems like a good time to do a bigger evaluation and make bigger plans.

So,

things I'd like to accomplish in the next year:

*get into a habit with my voice practice in order to get the most out of my lessons.

*get into a pattern of recording Momma's stories and transcribe them to her blog. (Need to discuss with Momma and come up with a ""realistic"" plan)

*go to an acting coach (have to see if where I want to go has time available/time that works for me).

*Complete the screenplay I've been working on and follow through with getting it cast and filmed.

*Complete at least one of the many other screenplay ideas I have sketched out.

*take an acting workshop (Right now Shakespeare and Company is appealing but their schedule might not work with mine)

*get in the habit of posting political links and comments to TOP Cat's Pest Strip rather than scatter shot everywhere else.

*run at least one 10K during 2010

Thinking about other things but not yet ready to talk about them on a public blog.

<b>Added:</b> How could I forget the most important one: enroll in the veterinary technician program at Gwinnett Tech!"

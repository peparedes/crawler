"event","This is the first time in 113 weeks that I have posted anything to my LJ.  Wow, over 2 years...

So here it is I am 2 years older, 30 lbs heavier, and I have gotten considerably more gray hairs than before.  part of that is due to my partner, Rick.  Our picture will be attached below.  Rick and I met in 2000 when I first moved to Atlanta.  We have been friendly all along but neither of us pursued more than a casual friendship with the other until about a year and a half ago.

I have some things to finish in the office, but will be posting more...

"event","Here are a few pictures from the Georgia Force Game this past Saturday. There were tons of cute chubby guys in the stands and a few on the field. 

I need to get a better zoom for my camera to get some great shots of the crowd.

6 pictures total.

Oh yeah, in case you were wondering, the Force beat the Orlando Predators 48 to 31. It was a great game and we had a great time. And we had very comfortable chairs that we could spread out in... Made the game all the better. So if anyone is interested in joining us for a game and is worried about fitting into a stadium seat, fret no more. I have tickets available for the next game, Sunday, February 5 at 1:00 PM. We will be leaving the game and going straight to the BMCA Super Bowl Party. So a full day of football this coming Sunday. Let me know if you are interested in tickets.

"event","I am the best consumer for product endorsements. If I like the product that is... If not, then I will definitely warn someone about using, buying, or eating it.

But I have found thanks to a wonderful sale at Kroger a delicious, light, fluffy, tasty yogurt from Yoplait. Now I have always been a fan of Yoplait's custard style yogurt (now known as Thick and Creamy). I have always liked my yogurt like my men: Thick and creamy.

But there is a new yogurt in my fridge:
<lj-cut>

<img src=""http://img296.imageshack.us/img296/1300/picture0020bv.jpg"" />

Yoplait Whips! Chocolate Mousse Style. Especially Chocolate Raspberry flavor. Delicious! If you have never tried yogurt but love chocolate mousse, you must try this yogurt. 

Notice my delicate ice cream spoon. Nothing makes ice cream, sorbets, mousse, puddings, yogurts, etc taste better than a spoon dedicated to the eating of such treats. I especially love that it is shaped like a shovel. The drawback is that the spoon looks so small while eating an entire pint of Haagen daz! But at least I am taking smaller bites."

The roast was very good and the root vegetables (carrots, parsnips, and potatoes) were tender and delicious.

Some friends came over last night to celebrate my birthday a few days early. I cooked a low country boil and made a delicious Chocolate chip cheesecake covered with raspberries. Jimmy brought a Italian custard cake from the International Bakery (my favorite cake).

Everyone had a good time, and I have enough shrimp left over to make a nice Shrimp Salad.

I know Jimmy took a few pictures as did Ant, <lj user=""baddabing70"">. Maybe I can convince Ant to post his (if they are good pics). I will post Jimmy's since he does not LJ.

Until next time,

1. Jeffrey looks like he is such a joy to have.

2. Jeffrey looks like, you've blown a seal.

3. Jeffrey looks like he is getting some great pointers. (I know of one I am getting on a very regular basis.)

4. Jeffrey looks like his normal self... well except one picture where they managed to make him look like a rock star.

5. Jeffrey looks like a pure italian guy, because of his black hair.

7. Jeffrey looks like a UV777PBK. (Whatever the hell that is...)

8. Jeffrey looks like you were very lucky.

9. Jeffrey looks like Rivaldo can foresee what you are thinking. (I knew he was psychotic... or something.)

10. Jeffrey looks like what happened was a time issue, thought it wasn't easy for me to diagnose. (was not easy for me either.)

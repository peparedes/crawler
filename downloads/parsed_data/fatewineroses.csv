<lj-cut text=""More rambling..."">I'm laying down on my bed, listening to Yahoo's <a href=""http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/stations/default.asp"" target=""_blank"">Launchcast</a>.&nbsp; Specifically I've been stuck on the ""<a href=""http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/stations/station.asp?i=355"" target=""_blank"">Martini Lounge</a>"" station for over a week now and have listened to the ""<a href=""http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/stations/station.asp?i=699"" target=""_blank"">New Vocal Standards</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/stations/station.asp?i=590"" target=""_blank"">Classic Vocal Standards</a>"" stations for at least a day each.

The <a href=""http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/stations/station.asp?i=355"" target=""_blank"">Martini Lounge</a> has the feeling of a decent Jazz Club I guess.&nbsp; They play new and classic sounds such as Louis Armstrong, Basia, Anita Baker and Billie Holiday.&nbsp; They even play French music!&nbsp; Okay okay...so I don't really like the French in general, but this music is COOL!&nbsp; It's also pretty relaxing.

The <a href=""http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/stations/station.asp?i=699"" target=""_blank"">New Vocal Standards</a> takes contemporary artists and combines them with the classic standards us old people enjoy so much.&nbsp; I mean, imagine Frank Costello singing ""My Funny Valentine"" or Sinead O'Connor singing ""Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered!"" Very cool.&nbsp; Another relaxing station.&nbsp; 

The <a href=""http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/stations/station.asp?i=590"" target=""_blank"">Classic Vocal Standards</a> is just that.&nbsp; All those classic standards that you automatically know most of the words to and can't help but sing along with!&nbsp; Frank Sinatra, The Andrew Sisters, Perry Como, and Sammy Davis, Jr.!&nbsp; How could you possibly resist?

I'm sorry.&nbsp; I'm just rambling about the music because I needed something to talk about besides all the CRAP that's been weighing me down.&nbsp; I need some down time, some away time from home, school AND work...just a day..a couple of hours..ANYTHING.&nbsp; Just thinking about trying to schedule the time in hurts my head.&nbsp; Until then I have to hang in there and just try and not think about all the CRAP going on...while surviving all the CRAP going on.

"event","Well, after a couple of hours of going over and over with different color schemes, I finally found one I like!  It sort of reminds me of an ice cream cone..either that or poodles.  Don't ask me why.  I really like the pink, browns and cream colors together.  

In the end it was the WebWhirlers (http://www.webwhirlers.com/colors/wizard.asp) ""Colour Wizard"" that helped me pull the scheme together.  I found one focus color I was interested in and popped it into the Wizard and it spit out the triad mix, complementary color, an analogous mix, a split complementary mix, a tint and shade mix, a chromatic variations mix and a saturation variation mix.  I went with the tint and shade mix for my focus color of pink.

So, I hope you like it.  If the pink is just TOO bright, let me know.  I was trying to balance the dark brown and the pink because the spaces I have them in require the text color to be the same.

And I *did* like the scheme I was using earlier...I just was experimenting with something and accidentially messed it up and therefore had to either fiddle with the old one AGAIN until I got it right, or create a whole new one from scrap.  I decided to start from scrap.

Let me know what you think!"

They multiply like flies.&nbsp; I was sitting on a bench, sweating in the hot sun across from the Language Arts building and there was just one.&nbsp; She was sitting, phone glued to ear while chit chatting with her boyfriend as he lies in bed, half awake listening to her tittering.&nbsp; Another one who knows the first one, (tittering into the phone), happens by and sits down.&nbsp; And then another.&nbsp; And then two more.&nbsp; And then all of them get on phones, call others, and suddenly instead of one, there is a swarm.

They stand, buzzing amongst each other, comparing notes on what classes each of them is taking, who is in class with whom, which teachers are just SO boring, and who is working where now.&nbsp; They have designated this small bench, sitting in the sun across from the Language Arts building, the one I have been sitting on this whole time, their ""spot"" and vow to meet here each day.

I wonder what they'll do when it rains.

************************

<STRONG>Moment Two -</STRONG> My American Lit teacher looks like a goth grown up.&nbsp; Black slacks and dress shirt sporting Goth Black dyed hair pulled up into a short pony tail, sporting large round gold post earrings.&nbsp;With his pointy nose in a thin rat-like face he perches on the table in the front of the classroom, nervously&nbsp;swinging his legs back and forth, telling the mostly teenage class to expect to hear him spout stupidity, (his word), many times during the semester, all the while insisting that we argue the ""idea"" rather than the person. <EM>~sigh~

</EM>Joyous.&nbsp; I get to discuss ""ideas"" about early American Literature with a stupid person and a bunch of teenagers.&nbsp; Can my day get any more idiotic?

************************

<STRONG>Moment Three -</STRONG> My Brit Lit teacher is a little better.&nbsp; A throwback to the sixties with her rough woven skirt with ""ethnic"" designs crossstitched across her hip, long curly hair and Birkenstock sandals...with just a touch of ""Valley Girl"" thrown in for good measure.&nbsp; She's enthusiastic about her subject and eager to get started.&nbsp; Usually a good sign in a teacher.

The class is more mixed than the American Lit, with a couple more ""adults"" than the earlier&nbsp;class, (only three people over 20 in a class of&nbsp;almost 40),&nbsp;and it's definitely more animated.&nbsp; A couple of English Geeks sit across from me, comparing notes on the many novels they have read.&nbsp; The girl in back is betrayed though by the romance novel falling out of her purse at her feet.&nbsp; I can see that they will be entertaining in class. ;-)

Looking again at the class, or rather...*listening* again to the class I wonder at the instructor's ability to guide the class through without losing control of the flow and ebb of the subject being discussed.&nbsp; After her ""interactive"" lecture goes off course for the majority of the class time I raise my hand to make a comment and successfully pull the topic back on course.&nbsp; The instructor points at me, smiles radiently at finally having brought the class to the point she was trying to make all along and finally moves the ""interactive"" lecture along.

This is going to be a LONG semester.</P>"

"event","I've waited so long to write this that you've probably forgotten.

<lj-cut text=""Regardless, here it is."">So. When we last left <A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/fatewineroses/27142.html#cutid1"">our story</A> I had just received a letter from B, (the bio father), that indicated that he had not received my letter and so had NO idea that I was eight months pregnant with his child. I remember vividly sitting on the couch in the living room of the apartment with my boyfriend on one side and my roommate K on the other. I must have had a shocked look on my face because they both asked me what was wrong. I told them that it didn't look like he had received my letter.

Now understand that this whole time every one of my friends believed that he was just copping out and wasn't answering to save his own booty. His letter, at least to me, proved otherwise. I had gotten to know him pretty well in the short time we were together. He talked a lot and I listened a lot. I think he was nervous.

Moving on. After agonizing over what to do, I decided to write rather than call. I'm a horrible phone person and usually rely on the other person to provide fodder while all I do is answer questions or expand on what the other person is talking about. Irrevelent fact, but fact nonetheless. On the other hand, I excelled at the written word and was pretty darn good at letters. So I wrote another letter.

I sent the letter to his work address and tried to make it look as official as possible. You never know who opens the upper echelon's mail, so I tried to make it look personal, but offical in some manner. Yah, right. In the letter I tried once again to just keep to the facts. Regardless of the fact that the emotions ran just under the surface, (I was pregnant folks!), the letter was pretty...emotionless. I once again got straight to the facts after only a line or two opening chit chat and told him I was pregnant. I also went over the no rocking the boat, full responsibility, etc. stuff. I let him know he could have as much or as little contact as he wished. It was up to him. I told him when I was due and that when he got there I should have already had the baby.

[I can't remember where, but I remember seeing an old journal of mine with some of this stuff in it. I took a bit to look around but I can't seem to find what I was looking for. If I do at a later date I'll post it.]

I sent the letter off with a feeling of trepidation. I didn't call him for a reason and I knew that he wouldn't wait. He'd call. I wasn't sure that I would be up to it. Every day after that was spent with the knowledge of that impending call firmly in the back of my head. I hoped that someone would be home when I received it. Either my boyfriend or my roommate. Anyone.

Of course, just like any good story, I didn't get my wish. My roommate had just taken my boyfriend with her to the pet store to get a new goldfish when the phone rang. I knew it was him. No, I didn't have caller ID...it was instinct. I was right. I wish I could tell you what was said. I remember him sounding pretty down, anxious. Nothing truly unexpected really. He wasn't accusatory really. He didn't do the ""how could this have happened?"" crap that a lot of guys might have done. (Advantage of him being nine years older.) He sounded more guilty than anything else. The conversation pretty much went over what I had said in the letter. I didn't want to make waves. I understood his familial obligations and didn't intend on ratting him out to his wife. I intended on keeping the child and raising the baby myself. I didn't intend on asking him for anything and he'd never have to worry about me and the baby. Yes. He could see the baby if he wanted to, I'd even make sure he knew when the baby was born if he'd give me a phone number that was good.

I didn't extend it. Hell. I never wanted the phone call to happen! A nice note would have been fine enough for me. <I>*rolling eyes*</I> I left off telling him I'd notify him when I gave birth and would see him when he came into town. Truthfully I was shaking during the entire phone call and cried for a while after I got off. It wasn't fifteen minutes later though that my roommate and boyfriend came home and I had to relive the whole experience.

It wasn't a week later that my boyfriend couldn't handle the baby thing any longer and dumped me. Of course, by this time we had moved into the house my roommate had bought with one of the bouncers and renovations had begun. My boyfriend still had a key to the house though as he was practically my roommate's best friend by now and was helping with renovations. <IMG onmousedown=""setCurrSmiley('img17','4/4_6_11','Sickened');doContextMenu(0);"" id=img17 ondragstart='event.dataTransfer.setData(""Text"","""")' title=Sickened ondragend='insertSmiley(""4/4_6_11"",""Sickened"")' onclick='insertSmiley(""4/4_6_11"",""Sickened"")' src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_6_11.gif"" align=absMiddle border=0>&nbsp; So not only did I get dumped, but I got my face rubbed in it DAILY. See, I would come home from work and HE would be there working on the house. Or he'd be having dinner there. Or he'd be hanging out with K.

It was at that point in time that I started hanging out with DD.&nbsp; A girlfriend of mine had insisted we go out to get me out of my post-boyfriend blues.&nbsp; Post-boyfriend?&nbsp; How the fuck is it POST if he's THERE all the time?&nbsp; Nevermind.&nbsp; I digress.&nbsp; As I was saying, my girlfriend wanted me to go out with her and I finally relented.&nbsp; Oh the looks I would get!&nbsp; That first night I ran into an old friend of mine from work (DD) and we started making it a weekly get together.&nbsp; We'd meet up at the same club, hang out and make fun of people dancing.&nbsp; I walked around with what must have looked like some exotic rum drink but what actually was a mixed fruit drink.&nbsp; It was nice having my own pet bartender.&nbsp; She would make me fruit drinks all night and it wouldn't cost me a dime.&nbsp; But the looks and comments I would get were hilarous!&nbsp; If only they had known! HAH!

Okay, that wasn't really part of the ""backstory"" but it's a fun tidbit that I enjoy remembering.&nbsp; At that point in time I had started having braxton hicks contractions on a regular basis, so I would go out and the braxton hicks would kick in about 10pm-ish.&nbsp; It was no big deal, but it was fun watching the look of horror when DD would ask me how I was feeling and I replied, ""Crappy.&nbsp; I keep having these damn contractions!"" <IMG onmousedown=""setCurrSmiley('img47','4/4_1_101','Hysterical');doContextMenu(0);"" id=img47 ondragstart='event.dataTransfer.setData(""Text"","""")' title=Hysterical ondragend='insertSmiley(""4/4_1_101"",""Hysterical"")' onclick='insertSmiley(""4/4_1_101"",""Hysterical"")' src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_1_101.gif"" align=absMiddle border=0>&nbsp; Of course, there WAS the one time the braxton hicks were so bad that I had to have DD drive me over to Skinifatz to tell K that I couldn't drive her car home as my contractions were so bad.&nbsp; If you knew DD you'd know that having him enter Skinifatz was a sign of the purest of loves. As a DJ of the highest degree country was BELOW him you see.

Regardless.&nbsp; Once again I got seriously off-track.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Where was I?&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So finally my time came.&nbsp; The day I started having contractions I went car shopping.&nbsp; I had made an appointment to see a car and by the time the appointment came along I was well into regular contractions but far from real labor.&nbsp; When the salesman asked me how I was doing I said, ""I'm in labor.&nbsp; How are you today?""&nbsp; <EM>*snicker*</EM>&nbsp; Typical man he panicked.&nbsp; I looked over the car but didn't test drive it.&nbsp; We went into the finance department to fill out the loan paperwork and the salesman panicked again and told the woman that we needed to hurry as I was in labor.&nbsp; She calmly asked me how far apart my contractions were, I told her and she looked at him and told him that we had plenty of time.&nbsp; We serenely smiled at each other with the womanly knowledge that no man understands.

I finished my paperwork and went home.&nbsp; I couldn't tell you what I did the rest of that day, but at about midnight I was still having regular contractions and called the hospital to see if I should come in.&nbsp; My water hadn't broken yet but I had been leaking amniotic fluids for about a week and my doctor had told me that if I started having regular contractions to go in as by leaking amniotic fluids I could have given the baby an infection.&nbsp; K (roommate) and D (bouncer roommate) were my birthing partners, so I went up to the second floor to wake them up.&nbsp; Standing in K's doorway I gently knocked on the door and quietly called, ""K.&nbsp; K.&nbsp; It's time to go.""&nbsp; D was immediately in the doorway of his room asking if it was time to go to the hospital and R, (K's Marine bfriend), was up and half-dressed before I finished talking to D.&nbsp; Go figure.

Panic ensued and K, D and R all got themselves together, my stuff in the car and the car out front ready for me to go before we took off.&nbsp; Of course before we even hit the car D was so nervous he threw up two times and K was so hyper it was like she had just consumed ten cups of coffee all at once!&nbsp; While we took D's car (bigger) K drove because D was too nervous to drive.&nbsp; They both sat in the front while I slid around in the huge backseat of D's Lincoln.&nbsp; R followed along in his car.&nbsp; 

The drive was interesting.&nbsp; I had opted to have my baby at Bethesda Naval Hospital rather than the closer Army Hospital because of all the scuttlebutt I had heard about the Army Hospital.&nbsp; I had also been to Bethesda once before about a year before; but that's a whole other story.&nbsp; Bethesda is about an hour drive from Quantico and all the way there everytime I had a contraction K sped up to over 80 mph.&nbsp; Her foot seemed steadily press downward the louder I got.&nbsp; As each contraction waned though, her foot would lighten and the miles per hour lessened considerably.&nbsp; 

She needn't have hurried though.&nbsp; When we finally got there and I went in for my inital exam I was told that I was only two centimeters dilated and that, to admit me, I had to be four to five centimeters dilated.&nbsp; The arrogant doctor didn't listen to what I told him about leaking amniotic fluid, he didn't listen to me at all.&nbsp; He merely had me lay down, stuck his fingers up my crotch, and then told me that I wasn't far enough along to be admitted.&nbsp; I asked him what he thought I should do.&nbsp; He told me I could either walk the halls to hopefully induce labor, or go home and wait it out.

It was almost 1am by now.&nbsp; I went out to tell the troops what the doctor said and decide what we wanted to do.&nbsp; To stay or not to stay?&nbsp; In the end they asked me and I told them that I was sure it was time and I wanted to stay and try and have the baby.&nbsp; I told them all they could go home if they wanted to, but all three of them opted to stay and walk the halls of Bethesda with me.

Once again it's late and I have to get up in only three and a half hours.&nbsp; Hopefully the brat starts school today (another story).&nbsp; I HAVE to finish the story today because there are other things to talk about.

I will say though that it is FUNNY and would recommend it to anyone who isn't a complete religious conservative or doesn't know anything about the bible.  Pick it up!

I also just got done reading <u>Best New American Voices: The Best New Fiction From America's Top Writing Programs</u>.  This is the 2004 edition guest edited by John Casey.  I also read the 2003 edition, which was guest edited by Joyce Carol Oates.  I preferred Oates selections personally, but all the stories were help in understanding the short story.  I think I'm getting a better feel.

That's a good thing because I keep thinking of those stories I want to write [procrastinator] and they get kicked around in my head until their bruised..but maybe that's a good thing.  I guess I won't know until I write them, right?

Nevertheless...the backstory comes first.  I have the next couple of days off, so maybe I can get some time to write then. <i>*crossing fingers*</i>

Oh..and one great thing happened today.  Went to lunch with my boss and one of her friends and when I came back one of my friends had stopped by and left a card and a little bamboo shoot in a class vase that has that little squishy gel stuff they sometimes put plants in??? You know, it comes in different colors?  Well this is the clear kind and the vase looks like two shot glasses stuck together in a kinda > < shape but softer. Hanging from a circle of beads that are around the waist of the vase hangs a small aluminum tag that says, ""bloom."" Just a little thing but really nice.

On the outside of the card it says, ""Cherie Leonard"" with ""(AKA: Queen of Everything)"" underneath and the card has a toddler in feetsie pajamas with his forehead flat two stairs up and his hands behind him.  Inside it reads, ""If it isn't one thing, it's another.  Hang in there.""  My friend wrote, ""Cherie, Don't forget that you are a <u>ROCK</u>!  By far of the strongest people I have ever met.  Luv ya Lots!  - L""

I just made my day.  Really it did.  I've just been having such a hard time lately and I've hovered on the edge of depression for a couple of months now.  I just happened to mention to her on IM the other night about my car and when I came back from lunch today these things were here.  

<b>IT'S THE SMALLEST THINGS IN LIFE THAT SOMEHOW MATTER THE MOST IN THE WORST OF TIMES.</B>

I don't know if anyone else ever said that..but it's a truth that I know and understand.  Thank you L."

"event","I think that during a person's life there will always be times when you want to kill one or another of your parents. Well, not <i>~really~</i> kill them, just plot their demise in your head.  You devise some horrible way for them to die where you might or might not have a hand in what happens;  but in the end they are truly dead....in the story of your mind anyway.  Tonight was one of my nights.  After an evening of moving into my apartment, my mother picks me up.  I casually ask her,""so, how did the moving go?""

Then she proceeds to tell me how they moved her couch into my apartment, (which I knew about), and how they knocked multiple holes into my front closet door, (and I *finally* get to live in a place that DOESN'T have doors with holes in them and they fucking knock holes in them.  Oh gee thanks.),  and finally how they took MY couch and took it to so and so's house, (which I did NOT know about).  Okay.  So it's not like I had a life and death attachment to this couch.  It's not like this was my first purchase with my own money.  It was a hand-me-down for god's sake!

That's not the point.

The point is that she talks to me months ago about the *possiblity* of buying me a new couch when she moves out, we talk about the *possibility* of BOTH couches fitting.  (I tell her yes multiple times)   And she never thinks to talk to me about it.  She'll be sleeping on the couch during the week.  I have a desk for my computer, but no place to do my homework.  It was hard enough with just me and my brat and one couch but now we have to share one very small couch with THREE people???  I don't think so.  So now I'm upset.

She offers, (like a good mommie would), to have them bring it back.  Right.  And be the bad guy and listen to them bitch and moan and give me a hard time? I don't think so.  But then she offers to just buy me a new couch now.  Uh huh.  And we're gonna do that while my car is still without an engine?  Riiiight.  Well, we'll just buy a loveseat.  Riiiight while I owe money to her asshole of a hubby.Who likes to pick and pick and complain and just mention offhand exactly HOW MUCH money I owe him on every occasion he possibly can and sometimes he shouldn't.  Oh, and let's not forget every conversation he has with his oldest daughter, (who has as low of an opinion about me as he does), about my every fault.  No.  I think I'll sit on the fucking floor thankyouverymuch.

You know, I love my mother very much. But tonight I plotted her death in my mind.

"event","Many times when I start this missive to you, I describe where I am,what I am doing...something to give you an idea of what is going on with me.  This time won't be much different. 

Tonight I sit at my laptop, struggling with a space key that barely works. I only got home  half hour ago from celebrating with my friend L.  She just got a new job.  We went out to our favorite place to get our favorite beer with her new(er) roommate. We haven't done anything like that in eons.   Of course, she invited another friend of hers...a completely hot guy...who she forgot to introduce to me!!  ARGH!  Well, next time. No big.

I'm tired as hell and I really need to get to sleep.  And this clearly broken space key is driving me nuts.  Really the reason I'm writing..typing...whatever...is because I'm reading this great book about writing.  It recommends, just like all the other twenty million books out there on writing, that to  write..really write you should write every day.I mean,  EVERY day.  So here I am.  Writing.  Not really what I should be writing about, but writing nonetheless.
 
I really have an idea  in my head for a short story.  It's been there for a while, but I'm completely intimidated by the THOUGHT of writing a short story rather than a poem that I have been stalling.  So I'm going to start writing every day. Not necessarily a lot.  The type of writing that the author of the book I'm reading recommends staring off into space while thinking of things.  Thing is I really don't have much time to write.  Let alone stare off into space for long periods of time.

So I've downloaded Semagic to my laptop and hope...no...PROMISE that I will write everyday. Now you might not see it downloaded to the web every day...but I WILL write every day.  We'll work this process together.  Piece by piece...and hope that my fears while maybe not go away, maybe subside a bit into the background.

Speaking of background, tonight I listen to my soft mix,so I can sleep as soon as I turn this off and right now Norah Jones (like that's a huge surprise! LoL) with ""Seven Years"" playing softly to me.

Goodnight all. I'll write at you tomorrow.

My sense of humor seems to have taken a serious vacation, I feel like I'm pressed from all sides, I'm running out of time for a project I'm in the middle of, and despite the fact I've been kinda looking forward to school starting I'm not feeling too happy about that either.

It's raining outside.  It's been raining off and on for days.  Normally I like the rain...I've been known to dance in the rain until my teeth are chattering.  Problem is, that's not the feeling I'm getting from it at all.

The specifics I just don't want to talk about here.  I mentally promised myself not to bring that part of what I do into here.  So, I'm just gonna' brood about that.

Question though...if you've read any of my poetry I'm looking for some opinions.  I want to enter into a local poetry contest and I'm trying to decide what to enter.  I was thinking one of the ones from this summer. 

If you've seen my stuff post a link to which one you think I should use. I actually will probably pick more than one.  If you haven't seen my stuff I'll be posting some later this week.

Essay of undetermined length on one of five questions based on Sophocles play <b>Antigone</b>.  We'd done enough in-class analysis for me to have a pretty good handle on the material; and since it was open book (how are you going to quote from heart?) all I had to do was write.  <i>*shrug*</i>  While I might have rambled a bit here and there and it could have flowed a bit better...it wouldn't have been bad for a first draft..especially since it was about four pages, single spaced in less than two hours. <i>*grin*</i>

I read it and...well, I wish *I* had written it.  It's so beautiful and actually very much in my inner-world style.  I also wanted to share, not only because of the beauty of the two pieces, but because they touched me.   I've felt what the first one brings to us.  I've had to say this to myself before.  I've had to remember this before.  May you never need to learn this, but always just KNOW this.  The second one, while a very very powerful piece is not as personal.  I have, on the other hand, known many people who have had this experience.  I think that reading this piece helps me to understand them just a little better.  I hope you like them as much as I did.

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>""Survivor's Song""</b>
by Maura Alia Bramkamp
from
<b><u>The Healing Woman</u></b>
June 1993

Better to cry
than to tighten your jaw
till your teeth crack
in your sleep.
Better to talk, to tell.
Unshed tears have a way
of sharpening to razor points
as lethal as avenging daggers
turned inward.

Better to yell
and point the way
to the source of your pain.
Anger undelivered
has a way of fermenting
to decay that seeps
into you blood as slow poison.

Better to spit it out.
Better to believe yourself.
Because the body never forgets
and cries out to be heard.
Cell memory doesn't lie
and waits for you to listen.

Better to believe yourself
than to put yourself on trial.
Better to put the blame
where it has always belonged --
before it takes up residence,
claiming squatter's rights
to your dreams, to your guts,
to your every night.

Better to remember,
because the body never forgets
and cries out to be heard
or whispers ""what happened to you
was real.""

That velveteen rabbit
had it wrong.
You become truly real
when you believe yourself,
when you listen to your
own survivor's song.</div>

<b>Remember the Moon Survives</b>
<i>For Pamela

by Barbara Kingsolver</i>

Remember the moon survives,
draws herself out cresent-thin,
a curved woman.  Untouchable,
she bends around the shadow
that pushes itself against her, and she

waits.  Remember how you waited
when the nights bled their darkness out
like ink, to blacken the days beyond,
to blind the morning's one eye.
This is how you learned how to draw
your life out like the moon,
curled like a fetus around the

shadow.  Curled in your bed,
the little hopeful flowers of your knees
pressed against the wall
and its mockery of paint,
always the little-girl colors
on the stones of the ordinary prison:
the house where you are someone's
daughter, sister, someone's flesh, someone's

blood.  The Lamb and Mary
have left you to float in this darkneess 
like a soup bone.  You watch
the cannibal feast from a hidden place
and pray to be rid of your offering.
The sun is all you wait for,
the light, guardian saint of all the children
who lie like death on the wake
on the household crime.  You stop
your heart like a clock: these hours
are not your own.  You hide
your life away, the lucky coin
tucked quickly in the shoe
from the burglar, when he

comes.  Because he will, as sure
as shoes.  This is the one
with all the keys to where you live,
the one you can't escape, and while 
your heart is stopped, he takes things.
It will take years

to learn: why you hold back sleep
from the mouth that opens in the dark,
why you will not feed it with
the dreams you sealed up tight
in a cave of tears; why
the black widow still visits you,
squeezes her venom out in droplets,
stringing them like garnets
down your abdomen,
the terrifying jewelry of a woman
you wore inside, a child robbed

in the dark.  Finally you know this.
You have sliced your numbness open
with the blades of your own eyes.
From your years of watching
you have grown the pupils of a cat, to see
in the dark.  And these eyes are
your blessing.  They will always know
the poison from the jewels that are both
embedded in your flesh.
They will always know the darkness
that is one of your names by now,
but not the one who knows, behind
the rising, falling tide
of shadow, the moon is always

whole.  You take in silver
through your eyes, and hammer it
as taut as poems in steel
into the fine bright crescent of your life:
the sickle,
the fetus,
the surviving moon."

Unfortunately, even now I don't have the leisure to update as I would like to do.  There is <b>so much</b> on my mind that I want to write down that my mind whirls for it.  For now I'll leave you with a short poem that caught my eye recently.  It won't be until after the 17th of this month that I'll be able to update.  Keep your eye out for it after that though.

<i>W.S. Merwin</i></div>

Every year without knowing it I have passed the day
When the last fires will wave to me
And the silence will set out
Tireless traveler
Like the beam of a lightless star

Then I will no longer
Find myself in life as in a strange garment
Surprised at the earth
And the love of one woman
And then shamelessness of men
As today writing after three days of rain
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
And bowing not knowing to what"

<b>10-25-03</b>

Ocean beach looks to be a surf beach.  the water is dotted with them.  Paddling out to the calm, bobbing up and down, waiting for that perfect ride.  There are lots of dogs, families teasing the water, slipping toes in the surf and sinking into the sand.  Little boys in underoos, dogs chasing after balls, friends sitting and talking, a girl writing in a book, a flim crew interviewing a woman.

All against the backdrop of the sun, sand, surf and light blue, cloudless sky.

This is my today.  Sitting here at the beach, listening to the water, hoping that it can melt away the tension headache I've had all day long.  I was at the San Francisco Zoo earlier.  Observing primates for my anthropology class.  I missed my brat's first soccer game.  She called me afterwards.  They won 7 to 0.  I needed the points for my class.  She had her precious Uncle T with her, as well as our friend L (who she loves and adores and the feelings are visa versa) came as well.  My dad was on his way over when she called me.

That is my today so far.

My yesterday saw me in turmmoil, anger, frustration & outrage due to a colleague plotting to get me in trouble.  Taking notes on everything I say.  Dredging up ancient history.  Asking for an investigation into my behavior.

My yesterday saw me in elation, jumping up and down in joy because I found out that my brother's wife will be having a boy.  First one in the family excepting my son.  I jumped up and down and told anyone I could find the good news.

My yesterday found me pumping gas in tears after receiving a phone call informing me that my Aunt D had passed away.  But no time for tears.  I must go home and not cry.  The Fall Festival awaits.  Time to get the brat ready, costume on, makeup done, and WE'RE OFF!  She runs off, tickets in hand, friends everywhere...and I get lost in the crowd.  Observing the families, the faces, the people.  Alone again watching the world.  Wondering why I was here and not there.
Found a great chinese restaurant.  Old time chinese, not the fast food stuff.  Finally home again and sleep.

My today sees me here at the beach, the sound of water washing away my headache (for the most part) and tears struggling to find their way out.  To be seen.  To crawl down my face and evaporate.

That was my today."

"event","<i><b>These words are mine and they are true. -  Chief Meninock</b></i>
<lj-cut text=""My words..."">
My words are as true as I can know them to be.  That's the best anyone can do I think.  To try and show truth of themselves to the world as much as possible.  Oh, we each have those moments of white lies.  It doesn't matter who you tell them to or why.  We all have those moments in life where the truth would just not benefit the person who wants to hear it, nor would it benefit yourself to tell them that truth.  It won't hurt them either.  I mean, it's not your best friend asking you about that ridiculous dress that she thinks makes her look so hot, (but really makes her look like a whore looking for a john); or the boyfriend who you know you just have to drop because you just can't stand him anymore and he's just about <b>}{</b> close to asking you to marry him.

I'm talking the Life truths.  Showing the closest thing to truth of yourself to those that you interact with on every level.  No hiding.  It's a hard thing to do.  I should know.  I've hidden myself to some level my entire Life I think.  That hiding from the world physically and from the infinite amount of interaction with people that must happen if you are to be a part of it.   People are complicated.  People give you headaches.  People give you heartaches.  They make you think about what you're doing and saying and thinking and feeling and a myriad of other things you sometimes don't want to do.  

People make you angry.  People make you frustrated.  People make you want to pound something until it's bloody.  They make you sad.  They make you scared.  They make you cry.  They make you smile.  They make you happy.  They make you love.  They make you feel the amazing wonder of what it is to be alive.  

<i><b>Honesty characterizes the person and enables him to create an identity, to communicate a real presence, and to establish authentic bonds with others. The individual increasingly comes to know who he is through the stand he takes when he expresses his ideas, values, beliefs, and convictions, and through the declaration and ownership of his feelings.  - Clark Moustakas</b></i> 

With every word you speak, with every thought you think, you are creating yourself.  You are made up of not only the bone, blood, muscle and gristle but the ideas, beliefs, values and convictions that you express through your words and actions.  What is all of that if you are not sharing it with others?  Why do you exist if not to be a part of that world just outside your window?  I always remember looking at that world out there (still do to some extent) and wondering why I'm not a part of it.  Oh, I go to work and have to talk to people there.  I interact many levels separated with people on the web. I see my family from time to time.  I live with my daughter.  I am not <i>completely</i> separate from the world.  I am not a part of it either.  I interact peripherally.  That surface part where you exchange niceties with people you come in contact with during your day.  Very few people know me more than that.  Shoot.  My best friends don't know me all that well.  They  know me more than most though.

<i><b>""Come to the edge
He said. They said: We are afraid.
Come to the edge
He said. They came.
He pushed them, and
they flew..."" 
-Guillaume Apollinaire</b></i> 

I should have written weeks ago.  I should have written just after it happened, when all of those thoughts were fresh in my mind.  I know I had some people worried.  For that I apologize.  It was not my intention.  I was better than anyone thought though.  I somehow let go of much of what I was holding onto in one single day.  Without me knowing it even.  I mean, one second I was holding on for dear life...and the next, it was gone.  Not in a sad way either.  More of a relief.  A big, deep breath that I had been holding for weeks..months even.  Tension built up in-between my shoulders...as if wings were starting to form...and then..release.  That first weekend after was full of happiness.  I couldn't have defined it other than that word I think.  It was just a lightness about myself and my time that weekend.  Was it really two weekends ago?  It seems as if it was a lifetime ago.

 <i><b>It is one of the blessings of old friends that you can afford to be stupid with them.  -  Ralph Waldo Emerson</b></i> 

I just have to give due to my friends here.  I dealt with this crisis of mind differently than I ever remember doing so before.  I didn't sit in my room, at my desk, or even in my car and stew over all of these things that were happening.  I didn't necessarily try and solve every nuance by myself.  Surely I thought of solutions.  Surely I thought to myself, ""oh dear gods what do I do now?""  But.  I also made a phone call.  One, simple, relatively short phone call.

<b><i>A friend is one to whom you can pour out the contents of your heart, chaff and grain alike. Knowing that the gentlest of hands will take and sift it, keep what is worth keeping and with a breath of kindness, blow the rest away.  -  Unknown</i></b>

I cut class and poured our my mind, my heart and my frustrations with it all.  I stood in the bookstore, fingers brushing across magazines, cookbooks, thrillers and self-help books while I talked to one of <b>The Best Friends</b>.  I do think this is the first time I've done this with that particular friend.  I said a quick, ""hello, how ya' doin,"" and moved rapidly to the ""So.  Do you have a minute to listen to me?""

Let me tell you, reader, that it might have been one of the most pertinent breakthroughs in my life as a human being. (No.  You can't ask me what I was before that.)

<i><b>No distance of place or lapse of time can lessen the friendship of those who are thoroughly persuaded of each other's worth.  -  Robert Southey (1774 - 1843)</b></i>

You know what?  He said, ""yes,"" and proceeded to listen to me pour out my woes to my heart's content.  And boy did I!  This was before I sent that first email.  I was confused, angry, sad and feeling completely without worth.  I was trying to find the courage to have that sense of self-worth so I could do what I thought I deserved to do.  So I could get answers I thought I deserved.  Whether or not the other person thought so was irrevelent at the time.

 <i><b>We need people in our lives with whom we can be as open as possible. To have real conversation with people may seem like such a simple, obvious suggestion, but it involves courage and risk.  -  Thomas Moore, PhD, in the essay ""Embracing the Everyday""</b></i> 

My friend listened.  He gave me honest answers...some of them were even ""I don't know.""  Which, I'm not sure if people know this, is OKAY.  As a matter of a fact, I think it's <i>better</i> to say ""I don't know"" than to give a thousand words of advice.  Sometimes just bouncing words off another person's brain is enough to click everything into place.  I got off the phone 30 minutes later with an understanding of what I wanted to do...and the knowledge in myself that I could do this simple thing.  And it was a simple thing..but oh so complicated.

<b><i>Friendship improves happiness, and abates misery, by doubling our joys, and dividing our grief.  -  Joseph Addison (1672 - 1719)</i></b>

I don't want to get into what happened afterwards.  I did outline some of it here.  I choose not to go into anything else surrounding those events other than to say that it did not end badly.  A very tentative, delicate agreement was come to and just suffice it to say that I don't give up people I care about easily.

<b><i>Some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle and end.  Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next.  Delicious ambiguity.  -  Gilda Radner</i></b>

Back to my friends.

<i><b>Friendship is a sheltering tree. -  Samuel Taylor Coleridge 

In the rush of daily living it's easy to forget all the remarkable people, real or fictional, who have been a part of your life. But if you just imagine they are near for a moment, you will realize that anyone who ever touched your heart is always with you, patiently waiting to emanate warmth and support whenever you remember to think of them.  -  Barbara Sher</b></i> 

<font size=""+1""><div style=""text-align: center;""><b>THANK YOU FRIEND.</b></div></font>

And I don't just mean thank you to that person who was on the phone that day.  But also to anyone who thought of me, who emailed me, IMed me...whatever.  It doesn't matter.  The thought of my friends was with me the whole weekend.  More so than normal anyway.  I basked in the warmth of you all.  Every single one of you who has ever touched my life..no matter in how small a way you believe you have done so..or whether or not you believe you have...if you have interacted with me on some level, you probably have touched me.  For that I am grateful.  I only hope that I have done the same, or can do the same someday..for you. (Once again I need to remember to write an entry about my guardian angel philosophy!)

Well, that's all for now.  I haven't written as much as I would have liked, but I keep getting interrupted.  I'm sorry I put this off for so long.  I'd write more but I have a paper to write by 7pm tonight and time is running out..and I just realized I'm hungry!!!  I'll leave you with one last quote:


<b><i>I beg you...to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language.  Don't search for the answers, which could not be given you now, because you would not be able to live them.  And the point is, to live everything.  Live the questions now.  Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer...  - Rainer Marine Rilke</i></b></lj-cut>"

"event","My stomach is tight and churning this morning.  You see, HE found my journal.  I don't know if he found it before this, but last night, after I received his email and responded and then wrote here in my LJ...angrily and snippily because I was hurt and wanting so much <b>not</b> to be hurt or to show that I was hurt...he read it.  

Why do I do this?  Why do I post here on LJ?  Why not just write in a paper notebook and keep it all to myself?  Why not write in Word on my computer and keep it under lock and key?  Why not keep it ""Friends Only"" so only exactly those who I would like to read it would?  

Because this is my cry out into the world.  These rantings and ramblings.  These forays into my life, my heart, my mind, my world splayed out in front of you.  It's by no means encompassing of my whole world.  So much goes on that I do not touch upon here.  Part of it is because, during the things I do during the day, I forget much.  Or it's not significant.  Or it's not something I want to share.  Or it's not something I care to think about again, so why write it down for posterity?

I write to share of myself.  To connect, on some level, with the great big void out there.  To touch someone, some how, some way, some time on some level....even if they  never tell me.  I do it because I am lonely to some extent.  I don't have a best friend I can go to here and cry my woes out to, or beat about the shoulders with my frustrations.  I don't have a significant other to cuddle with and whisper sweet nothings into their ear, or rant at until they cringe because my day didn't go just so. You can only tell a child so much about your adult world.  I have few that I would talk to on the level I share here.  Not to mention I don't sound quite so profound in person.

I wonder about these things because, albeit last night was a shock to find out that he had read my entry here, I have, over recent days found out of other people who know of me from other places who read this.  These are just those to who have told me.  I must wonder then, who else is anonymously reading my entries and what might they make of them.  I must also think about what I am putting out here for the public to read, versus those things that only my Friends list reads.

So.  Going back to the reasoning of why I do this mostly public.  Yes, read it again, mostly public.  I think that only a small handful of the entries I have done are Friends only.  The majority of my entries are public domain.  You see, when I first started this, my LJ couldn't be found with a simple Google search.  I know, I do it on a regular basis.  I don't know how long ago it was Googled in, but I guess it's probably been a month or so.  

So, knowing (in the beginning) that people couldn't find it simply by searching for my screen name, I felt relatively safe posting here to an anonymous crowd who might accidentally fall into my LJ and read it.  Note the word anonymous.  With the thought of people who know of me in some other capacity reading this, and the effect one single entry had on a person I care deeply about, I am going to have to seriously rethink what I post publicly.

First and foremost this LJ is for me.  A place for me to get out in writing what I cannot get out verbally.  A place to vent, rant, rave, gush and bubble.  If I feel then that I can share it with others, then it will be public.  I don't want to stop writing for a crowd.  I might write FOR myself, but I THINK of others when I write.  How stupid would THAT be, writing for just myself all the time?  Well, sometimes it makes for interesting reading.  See <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/fatewineroses/2003/08/03/"">THIS LJ entry.</a> 

Well, I had to write this because of what has been on my mind.  I went to bed last night thinking of HIM, and woke up thinking of HIM.  

<b>TO HIM:  </b>If you're reading this to wonder what is going on in my mind...I never, ever meant to hurt you. Why would I hurt someone who I care for so so much?  I am just in a froth thinking that we would let it end this way.  Please call or write to me if you read this."

"event","How can I ask you to take responsibility for the emotion I feel?

Resignation for the situation.  Moving on..maybe my mind has the expectation that I move forward...but my emotions are lingering in the past.

Sitting next to the pond filled with our words, dipping my toes..the eddies and whorls of words combining to create an echo of you on the water's surface.

My tears building behind steel doors, lapping the walls gently as slow steam rises from the heat of my bottled emotions.

--------------------------------------------

The first sentence is a good question for debate.  At what point do you take responsibility for other people's emotion?  Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.""  But does that leave off ANY responsibility for making another person feel emotions? CAN you make another person feel emotion?  Interacting with other human beings in general is a pretty complicated business.  We react to our world through outside stimulous, and internalized experiences. 

Psychologist and psychiatrists tell us to use those ""I"" statements...I FEEL _______ when you do __________.  So?  What does it say?  It says that certain actions by one person creates, or prompts a certain emotion.  So...a person does not CREATE the emotion in another...they PROMPT it.  Hmmm...  This bears further conversation.  I have to go now, but I'll post more on this later."

Found a bunch of stuff I'm going to share.  I sometimes struggle with what to write..or look for new and interesting things to put here.  One of the reasons I added in <lj comm=""dailysoulsearch""> and <lj comm=""weekly_wrapup "">.  To find things to talk about, peruse about...to contemplate.

<lj-cut text=""Journaling Stuff"">The magazine had an article with many online resources, so I thought I'd check them out.  I've gone through each of them and am adding a link to those that might interest you under the LJ cut below.  Hope you find something interesting!

<a href=""http://www.journal-writing.webdjinni.net/index.html"">Echoing Whispers</a> - This has a lot of resources! A monthly newsletter called ""The Lost Muse"" with writing exercises and prompts.

<a href=""http://www.journal-writing.webdjinni.net/index.html"">Writing the Inner Journey</a>  - This one is about travel journaling.  Has articles and exercises.  The main page is interesting as well.

<a href=""http://www.journal-writing.webdjinni.net/index.html"">Diarist.net</a> - Lots of good info about online journaling!  Writing prompts, links, awards given, and a directory of online journals.

<a href=""http://www.journal-writing.webdjinni.net/index.html"">Inspired to Journal</a> - Contests, prompts, quotes, articles, workshops.

<a href=""http://www.journal-writing.webdjinni.net/index.html"">Creative-Journal.com</a> - Really like this one.  They have a Yahoo group that will send out a daily prompt.  Workshops, articles, a discussion group, ""Thought for the day"", and so on!

<a href=""http://www.journal-writing.webdjinni.net/index.html"">Conversations Within...</a> - A free online workshop.

<a href=""http://www.electricdiary.com/main.aspx"">Electric Diary</a> - Another online journaling site.  

<a href=""http://www.electricdiary.com/main.aspx"">Random Acts of Journaling</a> - Way cool.  Unconventional writing prompts for your journaling.  Once you write your musings, you're encouraged to send the results into the site.

<a href=""http://www.electricdiary.com/main.aspx"">Suite 101.com</a> - Looks like a writing community. The link specifically directed towards journal writing..but there are others.

There was an article about spicing up how you express yourself in <i>Personal Journaling</i> and it had a small side bar that I wanted to share:

<div style=""text-align: center;""><u><b><i>Dig Deeper</i></b></u></div>

If the goal of your writing is to develop insights beyond laundry lists of activites, then using description artfully is one way to write more effectively.  Try these ideas to add dimension to your writing through description.

<ul><li>Read cookbooks, restaurant revies and cooking magazines to expand your attitudes about description.  Can you really describe salmon as ""bold"" or ""ruthless""?  Writers in this genre tend to reach into metaphors and unusual comparasions to describe simple food.  Are there phrases that inspire your own descriptions?  </li>

<li>Go online to read art reviews, or check out an art history book from your local library.  how are paintings, drawings and sculptures described?  This kind of writing is not literal, but very passionate, with comparasions and insights into the meaning of each brushstroke and curve.  Would anyone dare describe Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling without passion?
Walk through a textile or fabric store or outlet and notice all the variations of texture, color, pattern and depth.  How would you describe this in writing?  </li>
  
<li>Write about one of the happiest days of your life.  Close your eyes to try and remember very specific details.  Can you create new metaphors or comparasions to make you feel as if you're reliving that day? You will have achieved description nirvana if writing about it with passion suddenly makes you as content as you were that day.  Think of this exercise as a cheap mood elevator, a simple mind vacation, and do it as often as you can.</li></ul>

Here's another piece from <i>Personal Journaling</i> from an article about journaling through your divorce. 

<div style=""text-align: center;""><u><b><i>Managing Anger</i></b></u></div>

<b>Ventilate & Incinerate</b>
The next time you've had it up to here with frustration and anxiety, give yourself free rein to write down all of your rage.  Once you've expressed every nasty sentiment, rip those pages out of your journal and burn them.  ""It helps you symbolically let go,"" says Linda C. Senn, co-author of 
<i>The Divorce Recovery Journal.</i>  ""When I do this exercise, I kick the type up to 72-point bold on my computer for emphasis.""  If you prefer to write by hand, try using a black marker or a brightly colored pen to lend the same shouting quality to your intense feelings.

<b>Timed Tantrum</b>
Another good exercise is to set the kitchen timer for five or 10 minutes.  This is your no-holds barred writing period to work out every mean and angry thought that has been running through your head.  When time is up, shut your journal and make a concerted effort to leave the negativity behind on the page.  One benefit of this technique is that you'll be able to look back at your feelings in a few weeks.  You may be surprised at what a little time and perspective can do for your state of mind.

Well...I hope you found something interesting.  I know I'll be exploring the sites more fully as the weeks go by and I'm in serious need of some prompting!</lj-cut>"

"event","So I turned off all the lights, the music is playing low and quietly carressing my senses.

<lj-cut text=""My ups and downs of the day...."">Question...how do YOU experience music?  I don't just experience music with my ears...but with my skin, my voice and with my whole body.  Let the sounds wash over you...close your eyes, breathe in deep, feeling the music along the hairs of your arms and along your cheekbones...don't interpret it yet...just feel the sound and translate it into colors and feelings and emotions inside behind your eyelids.

Isn't it amazing?  And it doesn't matter if it's classical, rap, pop, rock or new age...if you let it, it can effect you deeply.

I had the worse day today.  Oh, it didn't START out that way.  I was fine coming into work.  Sat down, got settled and started my work.  Mood was fine.  Far as I can remember anyway.  About noonish my boss rolls in from the President's council.  She opens her door, sets her stuff down..walks back to her door and tells me to get a pad of paper and come into her office.  I grab a pen and paper and set my booty down in the chair across from her desk.

AS SOON AS SHE OPENED HER MOUTH...I could practically SEE the little stress monsters literally JUMPING off of her shoulders, across the desk and grabbing hold of my shirt.  When she feels confused or she doesn't know what she's talking about..she freaks.  So the President asked her about things in our area that she didn't know anything about...so she freaked.  Problem is...the solution MUST come from HER..not ME.

So she sat there and practically threw those stress monsters all over me.  By the time she was done I literally felt the weight of all of them across my shoulders and through my neck and back..sliming and crawling across my skin, hanging from the edges of me and bringing me down.

I haven't felt that bad in months.  Not since before May I believe. NOTHING I tried worked to lessen the stress.  I did all the items on my TO DO list, I took a walk, I sat down to go read my magazine (reading <i>Poets & Writers</i>), talked to some people...anything to get my mind back where it belonged and the stress monsters off of my back.  Nothing worked.

I finally got off of work and on the way home...I cried.  No reason other than this horrid horrid mood that had set itself upon me....weighing my whole body and mind down.

Didn't go away when I picked up the brat.  Didn't go away when I got home.  Took a nap...went away a little bit.  Got a phone call from my best friend Don...THAT helped a lot.  We IMed last night for a long while.  Another eye opening conversation like many I've had over the past month or so.  I suppose eventually my friends will truly get me in line.

Just before I left work someone popped online to IM me with an emergency.  Her friend is pregnant and she asked her to consider adoption.  Who does she call on?  Well, of course I'm the logical choice.  So I'm supposed to be talking to her tomorrow about 1pm my time.  I have mixed feelings about the whole thing.  I've counseled expectant girls who are thinking about adoption before.  As far as I know, Lifetime (the adoption facilitator I used) still has my contact info if they want me to talk to a girl.

I have mixed feelings because...well...isn't it obvious?  Just read my posts over the last week or so.  It's not hard to comprehend.  But I'll do it anyway..I'll lay it all out for her..logical like..giving her the choices and the pros and the cons...and showing her the emotions that go along with all of that.  How could I NOT show her the emotions?  Many times, that's all you're left with after the adoption is over.  The emotions are what drive the whole process.

The joy of the adoptive parents.  The sadness of the birthparent.  The love of an adoptive parent as they bring their newly adopted child into their lives.  The love of a birthparent as they hand their child over to practical strangers to care for the rest of the child's life.  The happiness the child brings into the life of the adoptive family.  The emotional hole left in the birth family.

Talked to Navy tonight.  Cleared up a lot of stuff I think.  Seems when he started  flirting with me on the boards he received an influx of email from the females of the board wanting his attention.  Interesting.  Also seems they offered all sort of ""information"" about me.  A couple of them insisting that ""She doesn't want you."" <i>~rolling eyes~</i>  Well, I set him straight on that.  Letting him know that <i>very few</i> people off the board know ANYTHING about me and that those who DO would never tell him anything without 1. Me finding out. 2. Them getting permission beforehand.  Wait.  I guess they go hand in hand. Duh. Heh.

Well, the information that he said he was getting and the fact that this was happening to him is an interesting little tidbit for me to file away.

Now..is that all I wanted to talk about?  I put off writing this because I was just feeling so horrible.  Had to get the brat to bed and then there were some other things to do before I settled into this.

School started.  I've had one Physical Anthropology class and one Astronomy class.  I'm amazed at how much I remember from my junior high astronomy class...yes...I said junior high.  It was a great class and I remember really enjoying it.  All of my teachers are ones I know I will enjoy, so I expect the semester to be fun despite how crazy it's going to be.

Still haven't had my English class yet.  There are two of them.  One online and one with a teacher I'd already had for creative writing a couple semesters ago.  We get along famously and she normally visits my office to chat about writing when she gets the chance.  Talked today as a matter of a fact.  Caught me on the copy machine and we talked about her Poetry Workshop class she's taking this semester. LoL  She has to write a sonnet by next Thursday! I laughed at her.  She's gonna bring it in so I can read it when she's done.  That should be cool. (Note to self:  pull together items written this summer)  I'm looking forward to starting my English classes especially though!  I want to get a feel for the work that is involved!

I can't think of anything else..well, I can think of more..but it's getting late now.  Time to go to sleep. </lj-cut>"

"event","<b>Found this while perusing the web!</b>

Cancer, the fourth Sign of the Zodiac, is all about home. Those born under this Sign are 'roots' kinds of people and take great pleasure in the comforts of home and family. Cancers are maternal, domestic and love to nurture others. More than likely, their family will be large, too -- the more, the merrier! Cancers will certainly be merry if their home life is serene and harmonious. Traditions are upheld with great zest in a Cancer's household, since these folks prize family history and love communal activities. They also tend to be patriotic, waving the flag whenever possible. A Cancer's good memory is the basis for stories told around the dinner table, and don't be surprised if these folks get emotional about things. Those born under this Sign wear their heart on their sleeve, which is just fine by them.

The mascot of Cancerians is the Crab, and much like this shelled little critter, Cancerians are quick to retreat into their shells if it suits their mood. No wonder these folks are called crabby! For Cancer, it's not that big of a deal, though, since they consider this 'shell' a second home (and they do love home). The flip side of this hiding is that shell-bound Crabs are often quite moody. Further, in keeping with their difficulty in sharing their innermost feelings, it can become a Herculean task to pry a Crab out of its secret hiding place. What to do? Give the Crab time -- eventually these folks will come out to play again. When they do, they'll be the first to say so, in keeping with the Cardinal Quality attached to this Sign. It's said that Crabs are first to laugh and first to cry, so you can bet they'll fill you in. That shell, by the way, isn't the only tough thing about Crabs. These folks are tenacious and strong-willed and like to get their way. If their well-documented kindness and gentleness doesn't do the trick, however, they're not above using emotional manipulation to make things happen. If that still doesn't work, they'll just go back to their shell and sulk, or find a way to get back at the source of their pain, since Crabs can be rather vindictive. That said, any self-respecting Crab would tell you that they are ultimately motivated by protecting their home and loved ones, a most noble goal."

I also met Erin or <lj user=""cosbye""> at mil.com and if she remembers how exactly we started talking I don't know!  Erin is pregnant now..due in January!  I'm gonna go out and hopefully be there for the big event!  We talk often on the phone and I thought it would be cool for her to keep an account of her pregnancy online for prosperity!

Erin's gonna start school this semester...she wants to be a Navy nurse.  Go figure! LoL  Her birthday is next Friday..when we're gonna find out the sex of the baby!!!  

<font size=""+1"">I'm <b>SO EXCITED!!!!</b></font>

I'm glad Erin decided to do the LJ thing and I look forward to her posts..<b>WELCOME ERIN!</b>

P.S. Don't forget to add me and <lj user=""jbriski""> to your friend's list!!!"

She's a brand new LJ user!  I met Jackie on mil.com when I started posting on the boards.  The exact way we became emeshed in each other's lives is lost to our memories...but it really doesn't matter.  Jackie is still in high school, but gearing up to go to college..hopefully at VMI!  She really would love to become a Marine Corps officer some day...and I have every confidence that she will!  

Now let's just hope I don't lose what tiny bit of respect I still have from her! <i>*wink*</i>

P.S.  Jackie..don't forget to add me as a friend! - Fate"

<lj-cut text=""More lyrics that mean something..."">
<b>Now THIS is what I need to be thinking...</b>

<b>Times Like These <i>by Foo Fighters</i></b>

I am a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away
then follows you back home
I am a street light shining
I'm a wild light blinding bright
burning off alone

it's times like these you learn to live again
it's times like these you give and give again
it's times like these you learn to love again
it's times like these time and time again

I am a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky
to hang the stars upon tonight
I am a little divided
do I stay or run away
and leave it all behind?

it's times like these you learn to live again
it's times like these you give and give again
it's times like these you learn to love again
it's times like these time and time again


<b><font size=""+1"">Dedicated to Cato...</font></b>

<b>Give Up The Grudge <i>by GOB</i></b>

Don't make me listen to the stupid broken record again
The needle skippin and repeatin' never reaching the end
I know your bitchin and complainin like you got it so tough
We're sick of all your cryin will you ever shut up?

So Keep bleeding your fake blood till no one even see's it
If thats the best you can make up, at least act like you mean it

Give up the grudge, 
better shut your mouth
why you gotta judge 
everbody but yourself
Take a look around, 
there aint nobody home
I may be a loser 
but at least I'm not alone

Your mercedes wont start yeah thats a cryin shame
I guess 90 k a year buys nothing but complaints
The people in my neighborhood think that I'm a threat
While the boss gets richer they get people in debt

<b>Now here's one that feels pretty apt.  It's part of what I'm trying to do...pull it back in.</b>

<b>Come Back Around <i>by Feeder</i></b>

Turning into something
Drifting off to old ways
Got to pull myself back in

Holding back the questions
We're bruised with all rejection
Gotta pull myself back in

[Chorus:]
Suffer the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
To come back around

Come back around
I miss you around

Reaching out for someone
Burning out for so long
Got to pull myself back in
There's no new religion
And there's no real solution
Gotta pull myself back in

come back around
come back around

Feel you're going under
So keep on treading water
Got to pull myself back in
Feel no obligation
But no more indecision
Gotta pull myself back in

<b>And OH MY GODS I LOVE THIS SONG!!!

This song touches me.  First of all was how it sounded.  And then when I started listening closer to the lyrics..well..I've put the portions that are very appropriate in <i>blue italics.</i>  Check it out. 

<b>Honey & The Moon <i>by Joseph Arthur</i></b>

<i><font color=""#000080"">Don't know why I'm still afraid
If you weren't real I would make you up
now
I wish that I could follow through</font></i>
I know that your love is true
And deep
As the sea
But right now
Everything you want is wrong,
And right now
All your dreams are waking up,
And right now
I wish I could follow you
To the shores
Of freedom,
Where no one lives.

<i><font color=""#000080"">Remember when we first met
And everything was still a bet
In love's game
You would call; I'd call you back
And then I'd leave
A message
On your answering machine</font></i>

<i><font color=""#000080"">But right now
Everything is turning blue,
And right now
The sun is trying to kill the moon,
And right now
I wish I could follow you
To the shores
Of freedom,
Where no one lives</font></i>

Freedom
Run away tonight
Freedom, freedom
Run away
Run away tonight

<i><font color=""#000080"">We're made out of blood and rust
Looking for someone to trust
Without 
A fight
I think that you came too soon
You're the honey and the moon
That lights
Up my night</font></i> 

But right now
Everything you want is wrong,
And right now
All your dreams are waking up,
And right now
I wish that I could follow you
To the shores
Of freedom
Where no one lives

Freedom
Run away tonight
Freedom freedom
Run away
Run away tonight

We got too much time to kill
Like pigeons on my windowsill
We hang around

<i><font color=""#000080"">Ever since I've been with you
You hold me up
All the time I'm falling down</font></i>

But right now
Everything is turning blue,
And right now
The sun is trying to kill the moon,
And right now
I wish I could follow you
To the shores
Of freedom
Where no one lives

These particular lyrics though..really touched me.  Sounds SO much like me doing my normal MO so I thought I would post it here.  Tryin' to change this..but we'll see how that goes.  So far so good.  Called HIM last night when I was OH SO UPSET.  Just needed to hear his voice and wanted to have him tell me a story.  He was in that blackout on the East Coast so I didn't get to talk to him.  Hmmm...did I call his HOME number KNOWING that he wouldn't answer because of the blackout?  Possibly.  Food for thought anyway.

<b>Forget Everything</b>
<i>by New Found Glory</i>

Can we pretend for one second that we are together,
What's the point of keeping my feelings at bay,
It takes alot of me,
To get the nerve to wake up,
Everyday,

And what if I don't,
Would you even care,
Would you even care,

Forget everything that we have done,
Erase me,
From your memory,
Don't call,
Don't ask about me until the day hell freezes over,

I can't remember the last time I saw you smile,
It might have been around this time last year,
It takes alot of me,
To get the nerve to tell you everything is ok,

And what if I don't,
Would you even care,
Would you even care,

Forget everything that we have done,
Erase me,
From your memory,
Don't call,
Don't ask about me until the day hell freezes over,

It's gone,
Before you know it,
You can't let go of something you've never had,
It's ash until you burn it,
I hope I never see you again,

And what if I don't,
Would you even care,
Would you even care,

Forget everything that we have done,
Erase me,
From your memory,
Don't call,
Don't ask about me until the day hell freezes over,

When hell freezes over"

"event","...but I think that we ""broke"" up.  We still talked, things were still playful..but all of my instincts were right on.  He's been feeling like he was getting in the same pattern of him and K..that holding pattern he was in for two years.  I knew I didn't want him to feel that way...I knew in my heart that had to be what was going on. <i>~sigh~</i>  I think I'm gonna go cry now.  I'm sadder about this than I thought I would be.

<lj-cut text=""The rest of the story..."">The friendship is still there...I think.  He didn't act like he was wanting to end the conversation tonight...or any other night.  Except he talked about August through November when he would be very busy.  Busy = no time for you

I'm not devastated.  I'm not going to be letting anyone else know about this..hardly anyone really knew anyway.  The question to myself is: do I take what I can get and hope for the best?  Or is THAT putting me in the same holding pattern he was feeling he was in? Yep. Sounds like it.  So then I just go to friendship mode.  Which is hard.  Really hard.  You get into a groove..and it's hard to pull out of it.

I am sad.  I am definitely going to cry.  I knew it.  I just knew it.  Too fast, too hard..too much.  What is that I wrote oh so long ago that translates here?  <i>I fall in love too easily/I fall in love too fast/i fall in love too terribly hard/For love to ever last...</i> ~rolling eyes~  Aren't I just the little poet?

I'm a great friend but who would want to be with me? Oh please...self-degrading crap.  Don't want to do that.

I'm crying.  Not huge deep sobs, but tears gently rolling down my face.  Eyes first filling with tears, until they crash over my lashes to roll down my face in long silver trails of hurt and pain.

And what hurts the most?  I am the one who started the conversation.  I am the one who didn't just let it be and see where it took us..but delved into the heart of the matter...his best interest (and my fears) at the forefront of my mind and intent.  And when all of my fears were realized?  I confirm his relief that we don't have to take this any farther and we can stay friends.

We don't remember how it all started anyway.  We started just wanting to be friends..with friendship the intent.  We clicked so much, so easily, so hard, so fast...it veered out of the original intent into something neither one intented truly.

But what makes me mad on some levels?  He went along with all of this..didn't pull back or show any intent but what we were BOTH going for.  Confirmed all of my feelings back...and now I sit here crying.</lj-cut>"

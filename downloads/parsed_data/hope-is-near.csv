"event","ok maybe i am over reacting.
lets put this into perspective
(reasons why im pissed of and wanting to hide in my room and cry.):
1. my soon to be EX boyfriend hasnt filled me in on anything,
2. i am also hated by his mates,
3. so is he, (guess why) cause i exsist,
4. that being the case its my fault if he doesnt have a place to live as hes living with his ex girlfriend (who hates me with all her heart),
5. i cant stop worrie bout everything thats happening with him and his life.
6. to add to this problem of this soon ending relationship i have to deal with constant text from luke saying he misses me,
7. i have a dead line for my french tomorrow which i cant acctually do as alex said she would help me with but now wont.
8. im back at school and its going to drive me crazy.
9. i have mascra down my face
10. rhi said she'd call me bk ages ago. but hasnt so now i feel increddibly alone. and again crying.
11. i've twisted my ankle and its swollen and fucking painful,
12. i have no food in my house so i havent eaten anything more than a packet of crisps in a day or two,
13. my mum has been just sitting in my garden sat in a chair doing nothing just stareing,
14.  .....i miss being loved by a guy that you know you can count on

i have a right to over react...

just as much as everyone else"

i dont want to give a fuck anymore.

no one truely realises how much it hurts to be hated by so many fucking people. they dont care they probably hate you to.

so my week so far has been, well interesting. i've have been around people that would be willing to get into any argument they could. for example Dannie T, sorrel (who isnt as bad as i think she could be), jemma, johnpaul and many other people who i would rather not spend time with. but as there seems to be no one else i can either get yelled at at home or get into argument with people i hate at the beers, and to be honest i have to live with mother so i would rather not argue with her.

You aren't too happy with your<br>life, though you may feel you should be. You're<br>probably solitary, pessimistic, brooding,<br>possibly nocturnal, but mostly a general<br>unknown. You might have a hidden liking for<br>pain and destruction, but you're probably more<br>masochistic that sadistic if that's true. (look<br>it up if you don't know what they mean!) Those<br>that think they know you tend to place you<br>closer to evil on a scale of good and evil,<br>which might not be true. What people see may<br>not be who you actually are. Some people fear<br>you and others mock you. What isn't really<br>known, though, is that you're not pure evil.<br>You're just a mysterious, misunderstood - and<br>sadly, forsaken - soul.

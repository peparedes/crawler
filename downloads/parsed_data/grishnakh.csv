"event","It seems I am off of work for the next 7 days, which is rad. 

I ended up working until 3am last night, I seemed to have missed practice, which this is the 5th time already, but hey who cares when you're in love. 

Tomorrow I am thinking about sleeping all day, unless of course Jami has plans otherwise. Which would be cool. We haven't really went out much in the past few weeks like we use to do, I miss that. 

I would spend every minute with her, if I didn't have to work or have band practice, but she's cool with it. As long as she is happy, is all that matters to me in this sickening world."

"event","Today brings me much joy, I must say. I talked to Jami and we actually got a really well understanding to each other. 


I'm really happy we worked this out, the best part is that she is actually going to go out with me this weekend. :)

I think I opened up that black spot in her heart ..at least I think I have in a way. She cried some, and all I could do was comfort her, it was really nice. I am off to work."

"event","I believe that I'm falling in love with my best friend. I tell you, its really weird for me, because I don't know if she feels the same way about me or not. She's so beautiful, smart, funny, intriguing, calm, into metal, I feel like I cannot marry my fiance, with me loving her. I am torn between being married and unhappy or being with her. I would choose her in a heartbeat. I have been staying away from her lately, I don't want her weirded out or anything. If I would tell her how I feel, she wouldn't even think of dating me, much less wanting to be my freind anymore, I know her well, more than her family does. The worst part of all of this is that I dream of her, wishing when I wake up, she's next to me, like that would ever happen in my life."

Everyone will surround the prisons and all earth liberation/drug war/political prisoners will be freed (bet that would make all of 'em). All countries will throw out their politicians and people will start talking to their neighbors.

"event","I am so saddening to wake this morning and read the following story from: http://bombsandshields.com/

What I wrote about yesterday was almost like a prediction...


U.S - The FBI and Homeland Security agents have stepped up their campaign against anarchists and animal rights and environmental activists. On Wednesday, in New York City, a 30 year old member of the Friends of Jeffrey Luers prisoner support group was arrested while at school. His apartment was also raided and computer and person affects seized. His arrest is in connection with a May 2001 Earth Liberation Front arson at Jefferson Poplar Farms near Portland Oregon. The arraignment will be at 11:00 am Thursday morning on the second floor of the Federal Court Building, which is located at at 225 Cadman Plaza East in Brooklyn.

Portland activists, Frank Winbigler and Shannon (Nonny) Urick were approached in a cafe by three FBI agents, one agent from Homeland Security, and an Oregon Sheriff. They were served with papers ordering them to be witnesses in a federal Grand Jury investigation, and were also advised that they are both targets of the same investigation. The Grand Jury is scheduled for March 16th of next year in Eugene, Oregon.

Later in the day more than a dozen FBI agents, along with Joint Terrorism Task Force and local police officers raided The Catalyst Infoshop in Prescott, Arizona. Environmental publications were seized and one of the groups founding members was arrested. The arraignment is scheduled for 10:00 am Thursday morning in Flagstaff where the federal courthouse is. Police in Arizona consider anarchists to be a terrorist threat.

Earlier in the week federal agents were asking around Boston for Daniel Andreas San Diego, who they allege is responsible for placing an explosive pipe bomb at Chiron Corp in Emeryville, California on August 28, 2003. The Chiron Corp, a biotechnology company, was a target of the animal rights campaign to shut down Huntingdon Life Sciences, a company that performs cruel experiments on animals.

This most recent attack on the earth and animal liberation movements was obviously well coordinated and planned far in advance. Activists across the country have been doing what they can to protect themselves by sharing information about how to avoid dealing with authorities a developing a better security culture."

"event","There just was one thing I really felt like I wanted to say about anarchism and terrorism: because of the past history of association and the fact the groups like ELF and ALF are being considered the ""top domestic threat"" despite the fact that they haven't killed anybody or ever advocated doing so, I state that because of our rejection of the total objectification of all of nature (eco-systems, animals, peoples, etc.) we can't possibly ever justify using political violence. 

That must be thoroughly rejected. Anyone who claims to be an anarchist and advocates violent revolution is lying-- they are an authoritarian. We must have a society free of coercion, or we simply have another terrorist state. 

However-- the insult of comparing the taking of a human life by fist, club, gun, bomb, or any other weapon as ""violence"" and then also calling a brick through Starbucks' front window or burning of SUVs ""violence"" is absurd. Especially when death by economic deprivation or environmental poisoning due to corporate practices is not considered ""violence"".

In other words, I do not consider black blocs or the actions of ALF to be ""violent"". The destruction of property is the exposure by anarchists that these seemingly innocent, even benign storefronts are actually the real locations of violence.

The war happening today is not somewhere ""out there"" in Iraq, or Afghanistan-- but happening right in front of us all the time as capital assaults millions in its colonization of the planet. However, property damage is not an end to itself or a tactic to be repeated constantly. When it becomes an expected, it ceases to be nothing more than part of the Spectacle.

Finally, I myself am torn on the question of self-defense. I certainly believe people should be able to protect themselves-- it's where, when, and how potentially injurious force should be used that is difficult. On a personal level, it seems perfectly reasonable to stop someone attempting to kill or rape you, for me-- one should stop as soon as a threat is neutralized. For instance, if someone jumps you, push them away-- then if they won't stop, maybe kick their leg out and run-- but being angry and hurting someone who just tried to hurt you seems to be going too far..."

"event","It's so insane for me at this time of year-- I have to finish my last two papers for my last two classes, but my daughter has been sick for a month now. I keep trying to concentrate on writing for school, but she needs something every five minutes. To top it off, since I've had to stay home with her so often, I've gotten no hours at work. After paying rent I won't have a friggin dime for the next two weeks. At least I got my Xmas presents for people a long time ago or I've made/am making them (most people are getting lotus wine and/or tinctures).

Single parenting is so enormously challenging. I don't see how anyone can devalue parenting as an activity. How is this not labor equal to any job I've ever had (white or blue collar)? There's so much more at stake.

The one thing I will take out of this past 4 years will be a determination to raise the status of parenting everywhere. Wages for mammas (and there's a few of us daddies now, too), no forced outsourcing for benefits-- do you know how many mothers are forced away from their children for a job that barely pays a dollar or two an hour over the cost of a babysitter? Being a mother is worth less than that 1 or 2 dollars an hour? (I say mothers even though I'm a single dad because that's who I hang out with... Mothers-- every playdate, every time we're at a playground, at every ballet and swim class, it's almost all mothers I am around so I come to relate to their situations. I've met maybe 3 other single dads in my lifetime but we don't hang out, they seem like me-- too busy in a ""deer in the headlights"" stressed out kind of way to have friendships going.)

I read a piece on Infoshop about some local parents attending the Fall Great Plains Anarchist Network Caucus. I would love to go to these events. But anyway, I was disappointed by the response from Chuck, the moderator over there. I love what this guy does as an anarchist and all and much of what he writes I think is a worthy contribution, but in this case he said:

""this is a good piece, but sending it to every organizing committee is not the easy solution. While it would be good to have more daycare at conferences to make them all inclusive, parents also have to take some responsibility and should not expect those of us who have opted for child-free lives to do their child care for them. And people who organize conferences shouldn't just say that childcare will be available without taking that responsibility seriously and doing it right.""

This is offensive. Chuck should have chosen any other word other than suggesting parents take ""responsibility"". What ARE we doing by staying away rather than expecting childcare?

Also, the way he brings up ""child-free lives"" also to me devalues the idea of childrearing as a somehow ""inferior"" lifestyle choice. While I'm not ultimately concerned with changing Chuck's views personally-- I think that this needs to be addressed by the group of us who consider ourselves ""anarchists"".

One of the things I hear about is the need to reach out to other segments of our communities other than white, middle-class folks. Well, look at parenting rates, especially single-parenting rates and you will see that other communities are far more represented in those numbers. Thus, if we really want to see more women, more activists of color, etc. providing childcare for events-- especially a networking event-- should be a real priority. 

I actually agree with the non-parent lifestyle choice. I think that that should be supported. However, ""child-free"" should not mean you are completely free of all contact and responsibility to children whatsoever. In building an anarchist society, we need to care for each other. If we ever reach an anarchist society, it WILL need to sustain itself-- that means some will still have and raise children --they will have to be supported then and will have to be supported now. Children are a real part of life, and should not be treated differently than any other human beings, their presence and influence should be valued-- and yes, all of us, even those who live ""child-free"" should take some responsibility for learning from them, helping them learn, etc.

This prejudice against children and parents is one that I have heard from many radical single women, and I have felt it myself now as a (temporarily) single father. How many allies are we willing to lose to spare ourselves from some ""discomfort"" or to pretend that ANYONE or any society (anarchist or not) could ever truly be, ""child-free""."

"event","My friends and I don't even like the label of anarchism much -- we're down with the idea that anarchism is simply a ""historical tendency""-- a natural instinct, if you will, which humanity is sort of inevitably striving for despite itself. Basically we believe that most of us want to be simply left in peace to enjoy life with our friends. But there's a small minority of humankind (spread throughout all genders and ethnic groups) with some sort of perverted sense of competitiveness, who just *have* to have more than others, or who take pleasure in subjugating others, and they create whole systems to avoid being called out as the social deviants they really are."

"event","Personally, I think this effort to house refugees in football stadiums smells wrong. Do you really think that a lot of middle-class white refugees would be warehoused by the thousands in open stadiums? Hardly. They would be dispersed throughout the area with hotel vouchers and that sort of thing. In addition, there are dozens of military bases scattered throughout this region with large amounts of surplus military housing due to the shrinking of the military post-Cold War and because so many of the remaining troops are in Iraq.

Military barracks are a far superior form of refugee housing because they have adequate cots, showers, privacy, and cooking and medical facilities. I bet white refugees would be dispersed immediately to many of these military bases, which have ready housing for families to have a bit more space and privacy. But these are poor black folks, so best herd them into a giant cage where we can keep an eye on them. Can't have them running around the place ""unsupervised."" -- Kent Lind

"event","First of all, I have to say that anyone who is sanctimonious enough to decide that natural disasters are a punishment for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">anything </span>is a monstrous soul. How cruel to look at such suffering and to simply blame your own personal favorite scapegoat.<br>
<br>
No, I'm sorry-- New Orleans is not being punished because it has <a href=""http://www.repentamerica.com/pr_hurricanekatrina.html"">gay street parties</a>.
New Orleans did not get punished because it is a ""very sinful city"" as
I heard at my local coffee shop in so-called ""liberal"" Boulder. It's
not even because Bush didn't sign the Kyoto accords. Although it <span style=""font-style: italic;"">is </span>potentially caused by climate change (whether human or not, or to what extent still needs much more rigorous study).<br>
<br>
Urghh... Anyone who really understands the level of deprivation people
trapped must feel could not blame the ""looters"", either. For Christ
sake, ""respecting"" private property is more important than people
starving and dying of thirst?!?! So what is they have to trade plasma
screen tvs for some food... Don't you think you'd do whatever you had
to?<br>
<br>
It's great how those of us who can sit in our comfortable homes and offices can condemn those without anything left...<br>
<br>
Americans can be real assholes sometimes.<br>

"event","Ok, so why a Web Journal? Mostly because I heard there were cool people on this site. It's true... I've been lurking around whenever I have some free time (not often) and found some awesome journals and groups. However, I have yet to really ""meet"" anyone because I really don't have time to sit and write to people and to keep up with online conversations day after day. How do people do it?

Oh well, I'm bumming that's it's a rainy day, but now I have an excuse to just sit and watch Star Wars with my daughter, and to indluge in my liking for pointless net exploration.

Yesterday I bottled my Lotus Wine (white) and today perhaps I'll start the red batch. I am taking forever to press my tinctures. This summer I will have people at the Ren Fair try out my tinctures and wine and figure out how to ""tweak"" my recipes. Then hopefully by this time next year I can be actually in production.

Kitchen took forever to remodel, and it's still not done....

Ok, this is it.... Starting from today I'm going to start actually using this thing. =)"

"event","Ok, I know I should've let you girls know before now, but I've been super busy and haven't had a chance...

So my 'merger' with Pea Pod Announcements didn't work out.  The owner, Heather, went a little nutty on me and I just wasn't having it.  She would require constant contact with me throughout the day, even though I was only scheduled to work 10-15 hours/day, we were working on holiday designs and asked me to convert some of her announcement designs into holiday designs then got upset with me when I didn't have original designs for her, and she was a total micro-manager (even from a different state, can't imagine what my life would've been like had we shared an office), so I quit and couldn't be happier!  Of course, she freaked out, harassed me via email until I threatened to take action, but now she's gone!

BUT, because I signed a ""no compete"" contract with her, I couldn't re-start BB for 90 days, but really, at that point, I had no desire to do it any longer.  I was literally working EVERY SINGLE DAY until 1 am in the morning, after working a full time job AND teaching aerobic classes; I was withering away, literally!

So, Josh and I talked, and although we've now got the business debt, our family and my health was suffering because of working all the time, so we decided that, even after the 90 days, we're not brining back BB.  I'm a little sad, but it's been over a month and a half since I 'quit' and I LOVE IT!  I'm getting to bed earlier, I'm able to sub more classes, I'm able to have dinner with Josh and Kassidy and am able to watch a little TV at night!  Woo hoo!  I'm bummed that all my hard work (designs) won't be utilized, but that's what happens, right?

And, ever since stopping, I've been able to really focus on what I completely enjoy doing, which is fitness! Total light bulb moment, but I think that's what I'm supposed to do with my life...inspire people through fitness.  I'm planning on taking my Personal Training certificate test in October, I've picked up a TON of classes at the gym (I've taught 5 kickboxing classes within the last week!) and I'm really happy with what I'm doing, FINALLY!  I don't have that ""ugg, I don't want to work"" feeling with fitness, yay!"

"event","Mothers

If you send this to just one person, it should make it all the way around the world by Mother's Day.

This is for the mothers who have sat up all night with sick toddlers in their arms, wiping up barf laced with Oscar Mayer wieners and cherry Kool-Aid saying, ""It's alright honey, Mommy's here.""

Who have sat in rocking chairs for hours on end soothing crying babies who can't be comforted.

This is for all the mothers who show up at work with spit-up in their hair and milk stains on their blouses and diapers in their purse.

For all the mothers who run carpools and make cookies and sew Halloween costumes. And all the mothers who DON'T.

This is for the mothers who gave birth to babies they'll never see.
And the mothers who took those babies and gave them homes.  And for the mothers who lost their baby in that precious 9 months that they will never get to watch grow on earth but one day will be reunited with in Heaven!

This is for the mothers whose priceless art collections are hanging on their refrigerator doors.

And for all the mothers who froze their buns on metal bleachers at football or soccer games instead of watching from the warmth of their cars, so that when their kids asked, ""Did you see me, Mom?"" they could say, ""Of course, I wouldn't have missed it for the world,"" and mean it.

This is for all the mothers who yell at their kids in the grocery store and swat them in despair when they stomp their feet and scream for ice cream before dinner.  And for all the mothers who count to ten instead, but realize how child abuse happens.

This is for all the mothers who sat down with their children and explained all about making babies.  And for all the (grand) mothers who wanted to, but just couldn't find the words.

This is for all the mothers who go hungry, so their children can eat.
For all the mothers who read ""Goodnight, Moon"" twice a night for a year.
And then read it again.  ""Just one more time.""

This is for all the mothers who taught their children to tie their shoelaces before they started school.  And for all the mothers who opted for Velcro instead.

This is for all the mothers who teach their sons to cook and their daughters to sink a jump shot.

This is for every mother whose head turns automatically when a little voice calls ""Mom?"" in a crowd, even though they know their own offspring are at home -- or even away at college.

This is for all the mothers who sent their kids to school with stomach aches assuring them they'd be just FINE once they got there, only to get calls from the school nurse an hour later asking them to please pick them up.  Right away.

This is for mothers whose children have gone astray, who can't find the words to reach them.

This is for all the step-mothers who raised another woman's child or children, and gave their time, attention, and love... sometimes totally unappreciated!

For all the mothers who bite their lips until they bleed when their 14-year-olds dye their hair green.

For all the mothers of the victims of recent school shootings, and the mothers of those who did the shooting.

For the mothers of the survivors, and the mothers who sat in front of their TVs in horror, hugging their child who just came home from school, safely.

This is for all the mothers who taught their children to be peaceful, and now pray they come home safely from a war.

What makes a good Mother anyway?  Is it patience?  Compassion? Broad hips? The ability to nurse a baby, cook dinner, and sew a button on a shirt, all at the same time?  Or is it in her heart?  Is it the ache you feel when you watch your son or daughter disappear down the street, walking to school alone for the very first time?  

The jolt that takes you from sleep to dread, from bed to crib at 2 A.M. to put your hand on the back of a sleeping baby?  The panic, years later, that comes again at 2 A.M. when you just want to hear their key in the door and know they are safe again in your home?  Or the need to flee from wherever you are and hug your child when you hear news of a fire, a car accident, a child dying?

The emotions of motherhood are universal and so our thoughts are for young mothers stumbling through diaper changes and sleep deprivation...And mature mothers learning to let go.

For working mothers and stay-at-home mothers.

Single mothers and married mothers.

Mothers with money, mothers without.

This is for you all.

For all of us.

Hang in there.

In the end we can only do the best we can.

Tell them every day that we love them.

And pray.

Please pass along to all the Moms in your life.

""Home is what catches you when you fall - and we all fall.""


Please pass this to a wonderful mother you know. (I just did.)"

"event","we got a call from our landlord yesterday...he's selling the townhome.  UGH!  of course, we have the option of staying until it's sold, BUT, we don't want people walking around our home when we get nothing out of it, ya know?  so, he put the place on the market yesterday (that was quick). good news is is that he has a small house he rents out in lake forest (literally down the street from where we are now) that the tenets are moving out this week.  the rent would be $250 more/month than we were paying in rent for the townhome.  the house is essentially the same as what we have now, but it's a 2 bed, 2 1/2 baths w/a loft and a bigger backyard. we drove by the house yesterday and it's really cute; if i owned it i'd get a new front door, but whatever. ;) it's in a really nice neighborhood. so, we're checking out the place on saturday.  it'll be available in 2 weeks: the landlord is painting and replacing the carpets (yay, no tile downstairs), but in 2 weeks is kassidy's b-day party, so we'll be moving the last weekend of march (heather, we'll have to reschedule, darn it!). we're lucky enough to have a really good relationship with our landlord. josh plays softball with him on friday nights, and he's pretty much let us do whatever we wanted with the townhome we're in now...like, we completely repainted kassidy's room to get rid of the ugly army green color it was originally painted, and my MIL and josh built a mini-mantel over the fire place (which turned out really good, and will probably be a nice selling point for the landlord) so we're pretty sure we'll be able to do the same painting options as before...and maybe paint our room too! kinda excited about this, but kinda stressed...when you initiate a move, you're completely prepared: mind, body, financially. but when it's sprung up on you, and you need to move in 2 weeks, it's a little stressful. just adding to it! ;)"

"event","Ok, I'm so sorry I haven't been here in awhile.  Busy, busy, busy!  K still has a double ear infection and we're working on our second dose of antibotics, so that's consuming most of my time.  The only free time I have to play on the internet is at work, and well, big brother watching and all I'm trying to play it safe.

Business is going great.  Orders are coming in and the maternity tours at Saddleback are fun!  Going through a redesign of my site soon, so be on the lookout.

Josh had to get a second job as a waiter at Chili's to pay for his school tuition...I so didn't sign up to be an only parent.  It's hard.  Especially with K being sick and all.  But, he's making good money in tips, so having the extra cash is nice.

K's birthday planning is coming along.  Someday I'll post her invite; turned out real cute.  Went shopping with my Mom over the weekend for decorations and stuff, and her birthday outfit.  That was fun.  My parents are renting a bounce house...I'm really hoping my husband will be a mature adult but with his twin brother around, who knows?

Ok, that's all for now!

Ciao!"

"event","Reading Sam's post on Aiden made me think ""I should post some updates on Kassi"", so here they are..

Crawling monster, this girl is!  She's all over the place: in the corners, up the stairs, on the hearth, chasing the cats around.  And, our cat Sammy is her new best friend.  They are soooo cute together.  Sammy will walk up to Kassi and sit down and wiggle his tail near her to get his attention.  I've cleared the bottom 2 shelves of our book case and put a ton of toys there for Kassi and she'll sit there and play with her toys and Sammy will come up and sit near her, as if saying ""I wanna play too!"".  Roxy, our girl cat, doesn't want anything to do with Kassi, although she does like to get Kassi to chase her around the dining room table.

Kassi is talking up a storm and ending every baby sentence with a nice raspberry!  She blew so many raspberries this weekend that I caught myself blowing some of my own this morning here at work.  I had to chuckle when I realized what I was doing.

Kassi thinks were her own personal jungle gym.  Loves to crawl and climb all over us.  She's also started standing without hands.  My little baby girl is growing up! :( :)  She has mastered squatting down from standing with no hands.

She loves to give big smiles, big baby hugs and big baby kisses.  Her kisses are open mouthed and typically are full of baby drool, but sweet nonetheless.  We have this bear Josh made me from Build a Bear when I was having my D&C (from my first m/c) that we call Buddy.  I'll put Buddy in front of her and say ""Give Buddy a hug"" and she'll grab him and tilt her head on his shoulder.  It's too precious!

It's amazing how you can love someone more and more everyday.  And, it's true.  I love this child more today than I did yesterday.  Her eyes are full of wonder and excitement and I want to show her everything I can.  I miss being with her during the day, but the thought of her big smiles makes me count the minutes down during the day until she walks through the door with her Daddy. :)"

"event","I just checked my WC ticker and we have 33 days left till Kassidy's due date.  OMG!!  This is my last week here at work before taking off for maternity leave.  We had our Childbirth Prep classes this past weekend, and got a diploma!  Tonight is our Breastfeeding Class, and next Wed is the Childcare Class.  So, we'll know how to birth, feed and bathe our babe; she can come anytime after that (since I'll be past 37 weeks when we're done).

I'm not really nervous about the baby coming.  It just seems so surreal to me.  Hard to put into words, but I don't think I'll totally get it until they put her in my arms, maybe not even then.  But, I love being pregnant.  Yea, the weight gain, sore hips and acid reflux all suck, but I love feeling her move inside of me.  Mommy and Kassidy time!  It's like: right now she's all mine and I don't have to share her if I don't want to.  But, once she comes, I'll have to share, and I was never really good at that when I was younger! :)

Josh is still not totally into feeling her move.  Mainly because I think he gets frustrated.  I'll tell him to put his hand on my belly cause she'll be moving, and then she stops, little bugger!  But, he always talks to the belly; says hi, good nite and by.  Too cute!  She's been moving so much lately that she'll move my whole belly from one side to the other.  Weird.  The Dr said she's very active, just like her Daddy.

Better go.  I'm at work and got stuff to do.  2 1/2 days left!  Yay!"

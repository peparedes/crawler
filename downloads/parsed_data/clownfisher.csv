"event","Have any of you ever seen the movie ""End of Days""?  It's the weirdest, creepiest thing I've ever seen.

There is one particular scene where Gabriel Byrne walks into a guys house, and asks the man about the two women: ""This your daughter?  This your mother?""  Then, the scene immediately cuts to Gabriel Byrne having sex with the mother while the daughter lays next to them and masturbates.  Then the two women make out and Gabriel Byrne, still humping the mom, uses his devil powers to make the limbs of the women fuse together weirdly.  Who the fuck made up this scene?  It's not cool or funny even in an ironic campy way.  Ugh."

"event","I got a 50 on the feminine side, which I don't care about, but the test made me feel STUPID. I scored lower than average on everything except matching eyes to emotions (although I did follow the directions wrong for most of the figure rotation one, accounting for my 4/12).  I could only come up with three grey things and four synonyms of happy, when the average was around 12 for each.  How can I be far worse than average at both systematizing (the ""male"" thing) and empathizing (the ""female"" thing)?  Blah!

On a side note, they confuse empathy and sympathy on the test. Im good at figuring out what people are feeling, just bad at offering comfort or caring."

Jason needs support in strengthening his personal boundaries, and will benefit from having very clear rules, expectations, and limits.

Jason needs treatment as well or he could die because of what is going on with his brain right now.

Jason needs to respect personal space when meeting new people, and use one the following phrases when meeting new people: Hello, my name is Jason.
                    It's nice to meet you.
                    How do you do?

"event","Havent updated in a while. I love LJ and all, but Opendiary.. is just... more cool for me. bascially whats been going on is that:
-We found the hottest guy ever at the school play last night. (blair, me, kelly) there was some stalking involved. the play sucked, but was really funny. blair blocked views of the camera. kelly wants to blow up her shed, her dad thinks thats stupid.
-I am struggling with self injury. I cut when i get very upset, which is often, but luckily ive only cut really 3 times in the past.. month i think. im also trying hard not to choke, something i discovered works very well, but is dangerous. 
-I thought i was the only one that choked, but i found Sarah did too. that made me feel better. i also found sarah is also trying to stop, which also made me feel better.
-Blair is doing very well with her cutting, and although she tried burning, and went over her cuts a little, she is doing very well, and hasnt actually cut since .. 3 weeks this tuesday. she is going to try not to burn again.
-Alaina is still cutting. This worries me alot, but no matter what i say she says its not my problem, and she isnt even trying to stop. 
-ive been very depressed and somewhat suicidal lately. all i think about is how easy it would be to kill myself. yet i dont. blair trys to help, and she does, but she isnt around enough. i dont care though. she feels bad, and i tell her not to, because i really dont want her to. paul just asks why im sad. alaina says shes too 'numb to help.' 
-Paul is going out with Carolyn. He keeps being sad because either she likes jake, or dosent love him. i say pauls being an idiot, and needs to realize she never loved him. i just wish they would break up already.
-Me and Paul are very good friends.
-I really like Paul. A lot. a lot.
-Me and alaina and paul are going to the distillers on april 3rd. 
-me and alaina and paul and sarina are going to blink182 and no doubt on june 8th.
-me and blair and kelly are going to the warped tour on august 20th.
-im obsessed with brody and the distillers.
-im getting into ska.
-i like heavy metal, but not as much as alaina, and not as much as punk and rock.
-im getting into courtney love and hole.
-im getting into makeup. i have some red lipstick, and it looks cool. ill start wearing it once i get eyeliner and mascara. it would be even better if i dyed my hair black.
-i might get my eyebrow pierced. i was supposed to on sunday, but i went and found i had forgot my birth certifacte. then i was going to go on tuesday, but it snowed.
-pauls bday is on thurs. i got him the distillers-coral fang cd.
-my bday is on april 2nd.
-tech fair is on wed.
-we have a school concert on tues.
-alaina is in NY. im bored.
-sarina, me, and alaina are taking kickboxing every monday and wednesday. its hard, but worth it.
-blairs bday party was really fun. we played monopoly, and i didnt get in a fight with nicole. we also avoided codi, she was very rude and read the whole time. we talked about cutting. it was good.
-blair is sleeping over next weekend!
-me, sarina, and alaina wanna go explore the state hostipital before it gets knocked own. of course, alaina and sarina wanna go next weekend, which is the only time blair can sleep over until may. they say they will go without me. i think thats rude, we should either bring blair, or wait until the second weekend of april. the hospital is gonna be there a while. and i never get to hang out with blair.
-alix is going out with an 8th grader. she wears his sweatshirt all the time, its too big and she looks like a tramp. she dyed the tips of her hair black, it turned out real bad, it looks like she got a sloppy haircut cuz the hair blends in with her shirts.
-steph is going out with a 5th grader.
- im sick of emo. carolyn and alix killed it.
-bob broke up with jessica. jess is taking care of dylan and kyle. (those are my cousins).
-I think thats it. im probably wrong. but whatever."

anyways, i went to NH with alaina last saturday for the day. it was fun. we saw all the animals (it was a farm), listened to music, and met the son of the family who lived there. so all in all that was good. it was a long car ride though.
we never went to the movies with jake and paul, but we went to the winter carvinal at the school. i kinda got to know jake, (paul and alaina want me to go out with him). paul said that jake thought i was annoying, but he dosent know the real me yet. figures. oh well. paul and alaina held hands on the walk home. i felt kinda sad, but what else is new?"

I found out today that Blair cuts herself. It really ... like surprised me. Not only that, i kinda freaked out. It was scary to find that out. I mean she really dosent seem like the type of person who would do that. She says it shouldnt be a big deal but to me it is.. i dont want it to be a big deal though. It just is. I mean just picturing her.. taking a razor.. or tweezers.. or scissors.. or even a knife to her skin and taking blood. it just seems so scary. im worried about her. i dont want anything to happen to her. i know that its not like she will commit suicide, but accidents happen. what if she cuts too deep? the cut gets infected? she loses too much blood? then where i will be? where will she be? 
and unlike some people.. i dont think cutting is 'selfish.' its just a way of coping with pain. ive tried it once, but i just couldnt bring myself to do it, it scares me too much. 
Blair- read that.. please. I hope you will understand how i feel about this, it really scares me. dont get mad at me ok?"

Cancer.
She is 17.
Another family member. The third. If she dies, she will be the second dead of cancer.
I dont beleive in organzied religion. Why can we believe in a higher being, pray, and leave at that? Why do we have to be a certain religion, and sing once a week? It just dosent make sense to me.

Becky is taking me to the movies sometime this week. We are going to the Butterfly Effect.

"event","Wow Nicole is such a hypocrite. I have just been to her new LJ, and she says the old her ""died"". Then she talked about how we were spreading rumors and that she had dirt on us that would make us lose all our skater friends or something of the sort. The only 'skater friend' i have is Paul. And i doubt he would ever believe anything Nicole said. And i didnt even spread rumors, she is like 'they were acting all innocense'. Nice spelling and grammar, and no i wasnt spreading rumors, im not going to stoop to that level. Then she said all her sister did was rebel against her mum and dad, and that it was 'dumb' and 'annoying'. Isnt that what Nicole was doing just a little over a month ago? and i think she is really convinced she is a hobbit or that her name is Eliza or something. Um.. yeah Hobbits are short.. you are almost 6 feet tall. and you dont have hairy feet, and you dont live in Middle Earth. And most of her friends are computer friends now. Her only real life friends are Anya and Blair, and unfournantly for everyone blair cant ever hang out with her friends. So i guess that leaves Anya, who i dont think she is good enough friends with to hang out with all the time. Guess that leaves her chatting online with other hobbits. Hm.. yes Hobbits have computers for sure. I mean, its fun to pretend, but really... i really think she thinks she is a hobbit.

We were waiting outside for Dad to pick us up when these teenagers drove by and a kid leaned out of the front seat window and yelled ""You two are posers! Faggets!!"" and drove away. I was so surprised, i didnt say anything back and niether did alaina. Everyone around us started laughing, and i did too. Cuz it was funny. This kid just looked at us and branded us that. Im guessing he meant poser as in fake punk, thats basically what it is today. and i know punk is about attitude, but this kid dosent know us, so he had to be judging but what we looked like. and we dont have peircings, or dyed hair or anything, cuz look, we are 13, can we really afford or be allowed to do that? NO. So me and alaina looked us over. the only poser thing about us really, besides her Blink182 shirt (covered by her purse strap) was our converse hightop shoes. Yep, just our shoes. Pathetic. But i dont care. I wish i said something back, but o well. its just ridicilus that 'punk' is a trend now, and its like a big competeion about who is and whos not. and i think those kids were the posers. if you were true 'punk' (a rarety, and i dont mean to label either) you wouldnt judge someone like that, and label them like that. And i mean, you cant dress the way you want, or act the way you want, or listen to what you want, without someone judging you know. if you dont like the way we dress, be glad you dont dress that way. if you dont like the way you act, be glad you dont act that way. and if you dont like what music you listen to, let us be, and dont listen to that music. Ok? its not hard. let us be who we want to be. we let you."

I bought Sims' Bustin Out with my money. Wee! But i got a drum set too.. wicked! It rocks. Im getting better at playing too. 
I slept over Melanie's house on Saturday. It was fun. Darren is wicked cute, he is learning to walk and stuff. He is all smiles. And we had a Sims 'marthon'. Lol yeah it was fun.
I went over Alainas last night. Her bass is awesome. Really big in real life though arent they? its almost as tall as me. we had quite a time wondering how people jump around while playing them. And we went for a walk to the booth. It was creepy, no one was there, so im like ""Theyll think we are trashpissing"" when i meant to say trespassing. It was funny.

"event","Well me and Alaina are not friends with Nicole anymore. I guess we realized that she just  blocks us out, and maybe the only reason we were friends with her is because we felt sorry for her. She used to be great, it was all good fun. But now she is just a major bitch, and me and Alaina were sick of it. All she did was complain, and she didnt help us out at all. She is just so annoying, and she says I am. I guess i found out i kinda did that deliberatly (be annoying) to give her a taste of her own medicine. And she also said that Alaina was inconsiderate of people, but really Nicole was. I could go on and on with examples of how horrible Nicole can really be, but i dont feel like it. But she cant take a joke. Like the time we stuck Lainas rabbit in her face when she was blocking us out at Alainas sleepover. She flipped, and its like 'hello, youre here to hang out with us, not listen to blink182 and write your story.' And she never helps. Like Alaina sometimes has to do the dishes while we are there, or watch Kasey. I help out. Nicole just sits there. And even after the car accident, in which she said she would be ever grateful of everyone and everything all the time, she has gone back to dissing her parents every second she gets. 'oh theyre so stupid. i hate them, blah blah.' she should be happy, they treat her like an angel and let her get away with everything. And she always complains about everything, even when she should be happy she has clothes, a house, food, a good education, etc, etc. And she always talks about how insane she is. shes really not. she needs to loosen up, stop complaining, and have fun. Im just so sick of her.

We almost didnt put our seatbelts on, and on the way to the mall we were making fun of the 'click it or ticket' commericals. Its scary to think what might have happened if we hadnt bothered to put our seatbelts on. On the way home in a friends car, we saw this same house that we had laughed at because it was covered in christmas lights and it seemed hilarous and way too early. But on the way back they looked beautiful. Needless to say, im never going to think about not putting a seatbelt on when i get into a car. Luckily no one was hurt, but its scary to think about what could have happened if someone did. All of us might not have ended things on great terms with everyone like nicole and her sister and alaina and her mom. I learned that you should be greatful to be alive and you should cherish every moment, every minute, every second of your life, you never know when it could end. We were all just laughing and having a great time when it happened so fast, and we could have been killed if we hadnt bothered with the seatbelts."

<i>And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</i> Matthew 2:11b

Extravagance is associated with worship throughout the Bible. David spent the equivalent of 21 billion dollars to build a temple. Solomon sacrificed 1,000 bulls. The widow who gave two mites gave everything she owned. Another woman spent a year's wages on perfume she poured on Jesus' head. In obedience to God, Abraham offered his son Isaac as a sacrifice. Yet, God outgave them all when He sacrificed His son Jesus.

The wise men's primary reason for seeking Jesus was to worship Him. When they finally encountered the newborn Savior, they worshipped him extravagantly with the finest and most expensive gifts. Gold acknowledged Jesus' royalty and authority, frankincense acknowledged His divinity and myrrh acknowledged His humanity. The wise men extravagantly worshipped Jesus as their King, their Priest and their Prophet. They were worshipping the One who would rule them, guide them and redeem them.

After worshipping Jesus extravagantly, the wise men began to hear God. The Bible says that God spoke to them through a dream. Do you want to personally hear from God? Come closer; bow at His feet, and worship Him extravagantly.

<i>And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshipped Him.</i> Matthew 2:11a

God wants you to express your love for Him by surrendering every aspect of your life to Him. The Bible says to love God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength. Worship is not about you; it's all about Him. Worship is about <i>expressing</i> your love for God. You can express worship through singing, clapping, shouting, bowing, kneeling, lifting your hands and dancing. These outward physical expressions of your love for God are biblical ways to worship Him.

When the wise men saw the Lord, they expressed their worship by offering Him gifts and bowing down before Him. Why did they do this? Because they recognized His authority and they wanted to outwardly express their submission. They knew they were in the presence of a Kind. Not just any king, but the King of kings.

How do you express your love for the king? Are you willing to offer your gifts to Jesus and bow down before Him in worship? If you want to sense more of God in your life, express your love for Him. He promises that when you draw near to Him, He WILL draw near to you.

<P><FONT size=4><EM>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the kind, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, ""Where is He who has&nbsp; been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.""</EM> Matthew 2:1-2</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Worship is not just something you do; it's something that comes from deep within your heart and soul. It's a love so intense it cannot be contained and must be expressed. Worship is a yearning to be with the One who sustains you and makes you whole-who gives you life, peace and real joy. You were created to worship.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>The wise men knew what it meant to worship. They expectantly awaited the birth of the Savior and went to great lengths to be in His presence. It didn't matter what they had to go through or how long it took to get there, they were determined to be in His presence. Imagine the excitement they felt at the moment they laid their eyes up on Him. It made them incapable of doing anything but falling down and worshipping Him. This kind of worship and adoration flows from a heart that is filled with anticipation, excitement and expectancy. It comes from spending time meditating on Him and adoring HIm.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>One moment in God's presence is all it takes to transform you forever. The Father is waiting with an expectant heart. Do you yearn for Him as much as He yearns for you? To what lengths are you willing to be in His presence?</FONT></P>

"event","From time to time it becomes vital for us to slow the frantic place of our lives and focus on our need to rely on God and not ourselves. We can do this by stopping and setting aside specific time to align our priorities with the priorities close to God's heart. Al of us, on a daily basis, need to share in the experience of hearing God's voice and obeying Him. This is why I am asking you to set aside the next forty days to fast and pray. (Jan. 9-Feb. 17) These forty days are a dedicated time for us to declare to God our utter dependence on Him. It is a time to consciously and deliberately focus our hearts and attention on our Heavenly Father. As we begin our <i>Forty Days of Prayer and Fasting</i>, I am asking you to pray about how God wants you to fast. If your health allows, I would encourage you to consider giving up at least one meal every day. I pray that God may even lead some of you to go without any food for several days. I'm also asking you to prayerfully consider giving up things such as television, periodicals, and non-essential email which can all too often consume major amounts of our time. Above all, I am asking you to allow yourself extra time to be sensitive and open to hearing God's voice and obeying His direction in your life and th elife of the church as we begin a new year.

I invite you to join us as we focus our time and attention on fasting, praying and studying God's word. My prayer is that God will speak to you and bless you tremendously not only during the next forty days, but also throughout all of 2006.

His servant,

<P>God's part of the foundation is contenment. God calls Himself by more than 250 names in the Bible but the one that best describes God's part in the area of money is Master. Job was still able to worship God after losing everything he had because he knew the Lord's role as Master of those possessions.</P>
<P>OWNERSHIP:</P>
<P>God is the sole owner of everything. <EM><FONT color=#666666>""The earth is the Lord's and all it contains</FONT></EM>"" Psalm 24:1.

<P>The Lord holds everything together by his power. Recognizing God's ownership is critical in allowing Jesus to become the Lord of our money and possessions.</P>

"event","<P><FONT size=4><STRONG>The Problem:</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>How we spend our money reflects on our priorities. Our checkbooks tell us more about our priorities than does anything else.</P>
<P>Jesus talked a LOT about money. 16 of the 38 parables were concerned with how to handle money and possessions. Jesus Christ said more about money than almost any other subject. The Bible offers 500 verses on prayer, fewer than 500 on faith, but more than 2,350 verses on money and possessions!</P>
<P>The Lord said a lot about it because He wants us to know His perspective on this critical area of life. He dealt with money matters because &lt;i&gt;money does matter.&lt;/i&gt;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5>The Answer:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>1. How we handle money affects our fellowship with the Lord</FONT>.</P>
<P>Luke 16:11 ""<EM>If therefore you have not been faithful in the use of wordly wealth, who will entrust the true riches to you?""</EM></P>
<P>How we handle our money is equated with our spiritual life. If we handle it properly, our relationship with Christ will grow. </P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>2. Possessions compete with the Lord</FONT>.</P>
<P>""<EM>No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money</EM>."" Matthew 6:24</P>
<P>People have the perspective that God does not control their money. In this they say, ""God, You can be the Lord of my entire life except for my money. I am perfectly capable of handling that myself.""</P>
<P><FONT color=#006600>3. Much of life revolves around the use of money.</FONT></P>
<P>It's true. We work for money. We think of ways to spend it. The Bible thankfully is our blueprint for how we handle money.</P>
<P>Isaiah 55:8 ""<EM>For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,' declares the Lord</EM>.""</P>
<P><STRONG>LEARN TO BE CONTENT</STRONG></P>
<P>Philippians 4:11-13 Paul writes,</P>
<P>""<EM>I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do everything through him who gives me strength.""</EM></P>
<P>We are not born content. We have to learn contentment.</P>
<P><STRONG>CONTRAST</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><U>Society says</U></STRONG>: God plays no role in handling money, and my happiness is based on being able to afford my desired standard of living.</P>
<P><STRONG><U>Scripture says</U></STRONG>: As you learn and follow the scriptural principles of how to handle money, you will draw close to Christ and learn to be content in every circumstance.</P>"

<P><STRONG>Matthew 24:10</STRONG> <EM>""At that time <STRONG>many</STRONG> will turn away from the faith and will <STRONG>betray</STRONG> and <STRONG>hate</STRONG> each other.""</EM></P>
<P>Do you believe we are living in the last days? Jesus said we would know the season. The apostles asked Jesus what events would happen before He returns. <STRONG>MANY</STRONG> will be offended, will <STRONG>betray</STRONG> one another, will <STRONG>hate</STRONG> one another.</P>
<P><STRONG>Proverbs 18:19</STRONG> <EM>""An offended brother is more unyeilding than a fortified city, and disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel.""</EM></P>
<P>Strong cities had walls for protection. People build mental walls, or ""strongholds"".</P>
<P><STRONG>2 Corinthians 10:3-5</STRONG> <EM>""For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.""</EM></P>
<P>That means <STRONG>WAR</STRONG>. We need to break down the <STRONG>strongholds</STRONG>.</P>
<P>God's word is rooted in His nature. His nature is <FONT color=#ff0000>LOVE</FONT>. He <STRONG>IS</STRONG> <FONT color=#ff0000>Love</FONT>. An offended person begins to build thought processes and creates walls to <STRONG>PROTECT PROTECT PROTECT</STRONG> and the focus becomes <STRONG>INWARD</STRONG> not <STRONG>OUTWARD</STRONG>. ""I've been hurt. I don't want to get hurt again. I've set up reasoning and mechanisms and thought processes that will protect me from getting hurt again."" They no longer have the willingness to <STRONG>turn the other</STRONG> <STRONG>cheek</STRONG>. If push comes to shove, you will protect yourself and risk hurting the person&nbsp; you have a relationship with.</P>
<P>The meaning of <STRONG>betrayal</STRONG>: is not the extreme case of Judas or Benedict Arnold, it's when you seek <STRONG>YOUR</STRONG> benefit or <STRONG>YOUR</STRONG> protection at one you have a relationship with. <STRONG>Betrayal</STRONG> is the <STRONG><FONT size=4>ultimate</FONT></STRONG> abandonment of a relationship. If not dealt with, it will ultimately lead to <STRONG>hatred</STRONG>. <STRONG>HATRED</STRONG> means ""to <FONT color=#ff0000>love </FONT><STRONG>less</STRONG>"" or ""the <STRONG>absence</STRONG> of <FONT color=#ff0000>love</FONT>."" Hatred is <STRONG>not</STRONG> anger.</P>
<P><STRONG>Matthew 24:11</STRONG> <EM>""and many false prophets will appear and deceive many peopole.""</EM></P>
<P>Offended hearts are the breeding grounds of <STRONG>deception</STRONG>. The person who is deceived thinks he's right when he's wrong. Jesus calls false prophets ""<FONT color=#660000>wolves in sheep's clothing</FONT>."" The wolve's goal is to&nbsp; isolate the sheep from the herd because there is safety in the herd. Isolation occurs in the <STRONG>soul</STRONG>. Offenses occur in the <STRONG>mind</STRONG>. You become meat for the enemy's table.</P>
<P><STRONG>Matthew 24: 12</STRONG> <EM>""Because of the increase of <STRONG>lawlessness</STRONG>, the <FONT color=#ff0000>love </FONT>of most will grow <STRONG>cold</STRONG>""</EM></P>
<P>Lawlessness means you are law unto yourself and not submitted under the law of God. Lawlessness comes from offended people. He is talking about the church, not society. If you believe and endure until the end, you will be saved.</P>
<P><STRONG>TWO</STRONG> categories of offended people:</P>
<P>1) Those that have been <STRONG>genuinely</STRONG> mistreated</P>
<P>2) Those that *<STRONG>think</STRONG>* they have been mistreated but either have <STRONG>inaccurate</STRONG> <STRONG>information</STRONG> or have <STRONG>discerned incorrectly</STRONG>.</P>
<P>The person who can hurt you the <STRONG><FONT size=6>MOST</FONT></STRONG> is the person <STRONG><FONT size=5>CLOSEST</FONT></STRONG> to you. Our expectations are higher on them. <FONT color=#006600>A person who refuses to forgive is a person who has forgotten what they have been forgiven of.</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>Matthew 18:21</STRONG> <EM>""Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?'""</EM></P>
<P>How many times should you forgive them? Your forgiveness is as exhaustable as God's is. We were forgiven an unpayable debt. You have to admit you are offended before you can be free.</P>
<P><STRONG>Acts 24:16</STRONG><EM> ""So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.""</EM></P>
<P>Wounds don't heal overnight. If you don't deal with those wounds, you'll never get healed. You become wounded when you don't exercise: read the Bible, pray etc and you get weak and get wounded easily! <STRONG>Offense</STRONG>-<STRONG>proof</STRONG> yourself.</P>
<P><STRONG>Matthew 5:44</STRONG> <EM>""But I tell you: <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG><FONT size=6>Love</FONT></STRONG> </FONT>your <STRONG>ENEMIES</STRONG> and pray for those who <STRONG>PERSECUTE</STRONG> you""</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>Pray</STRONG> for those that <STRONG>abuse</STRONG> you. Jesus said to go <STRONG>TO THEM.</STRONG> Not to tell them what all they did against you, but to reconcile. Forgiveness and reconciliation are different. Make an atmosphere where you can say you're sorry and they will open up.</P>
<P><STRONG>Luke 17:1</STRONG> <EM>""Jesus said to his disciples: 'Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to that person through whom they come.'""</EM></P>
<P>What you do with the offense will determine your future. You become <STRONG>stronger</STRONG> or you become <STRONG>bitter</STRONG>. It is impossible for offenses to not come.</P>
<P><STRONG>BREAK DOWN THE WALL BETWEEN YOU AND GOD!!!</STRONG></P>
<P><U><FONT size=5>Prayer for today</FONT></U>: (Say aloud)</P>
<P>Father in Heaven, thank you for speaking to me today.I realize that I have sinned against you. I've held <STRONG>unforgiveness</STRONG>. I've <STRONG>harbored</STRONG> <STRONG>offense</STRONG> because of what was done to me, and I justified my sin of <STRONG>unforgiveness</STRONG> by how badly I was treated; but I realize today that two wrongs don't make a right. I have sinned by holding onto unforgiveness and I <STRONG>repent</STRONG> and I ask you to cleanse me with your royal blood and I choose this day to obey you.

"event","The Classroom of Reconciliation

Reconcile: to make friendly again; to settle

We all have events in our past we need to settle or make friends with again. These may be simple relational or personal issues we can easily reconcile by forgiving someone or receiving forgiveness from God. Sometimes the process of reconciliation is painful. The valley of the shadow of death is a dreadul place for us all, but thank God he stays with us! Because of God's promise to always be with us, we need not fear! Nothing in our past, present, or future is greter than God's grace. Understand that the Healer will always be at your side.

Freedom demands honesty. Honesty demands humility and dependence upon God. Seek to be completely honest before God and man, and freedom will be yours.

Concerning your past, you can run but you cannot hide.

Now that you're a graduate of the School of Freedom, I pray God's blessings upon you as you see true and lasting freedom from your past.
</End>

I really struggled with this one as you may or may not know. It's hard to sit there and forgive those that hurt you in the past or are hurting you in the present, but you HAVE to. I learned that the hard way I suppose. I tried to forget things and then my past would be thrown in my face. I don't appreciate someone telling me I'm living in the past when THEY are the ones bringing it up! Let it go! I tried for years to swallow events in my life but they wouldn't stay down. I know of specific people that need to hear this message but probably never will and I pray anyway. You know how people say they will pray for you yada yada yada but it's just something they say? Well I DO pray for people. I pray for those I am no longer friends with, I pray for those that hurt me, I pray for those new friendships in my life...I pray about anything and everything that comes to mind. While once in awhile I get this vengeful thought in my head about certain people, I know to act on it and dismiss it. What my sister taught me is that once you forgive, Satan will do everything in his power to make you feel like you never forgave them. He will bring memories up to haunt you and to make you hate again...because it pulls you back into bondage. Knowing this however, has changed my outlook because I KNOW why I have those thoughts and I know how to get rid of them. In fact, getting out of bondage helped me to form the new wonderful relationships I have. It made me forgive Jerrisa to where she and I talk again. It helped me to open my eyes to the great friend I have in Keri and to actually open myself up to the idea of having a new friend in my life. I've grown by leaps and bounds in a short amount of time and I can't wait to see what else is in store...

I know that this works, because I graduated successfully. While I still fight bondage in my life, at least I know I'm not alone this time...

2. The Classroom of Responsibility

One way we deal with problems is to make someone else responsible. They blame their parents or someone else for their inadequacies. The results are fear, self pity, negative attitudes and hopelessness concerning the future.

Blaming someone else as the problem makes them the solution where they must act to fix the problem. This mindset keeps you in bondage. They are forever waiting for someone else to change, apologize, or make it right. They become disappointed.

Our experiences in life don't have complete control over our destiny-our response to life's events are also a factor. Even though others are responsible to God for how they treat us, WE are ultimately respoinsible for our behavior.

Example: Cain and Abel
Abel gave his first and his best. Cain just gave an ""offering"" and wasn't blessed. Then after killing Abel, Cain didn't take responsibility. He blamed God.

1. We are responsible for our own behavior
2. Our obedience of lack of obedience in every situation leads to happiness or unhappiness
3. Satan preys upon the irresponsible

""Regardless of how people treat me or what life does to me, I am responsible for my behavior and attitudes toward God, others, and myself. My ultimate responsibility is to God, to do what He commands and to turn to Him for my answers.""

Stop blaming others for who you are or how you are. Sure, people have hurt you and disappointed. No doubt life has thrown you some curves you didn't think you deserved. All of us experience these things; that isn't the question. The quewtion is, ""HOW will you respond?"""

"event","Ch 2: The School of Freedom-by Jimmy Evans

""The journey to freedom is a wonderful journey. Though it means change and some unexpected turns, the destination of freedom is worth everything we give for it.""

There are different types of bondage. Some are emotional, mental, some spiritual and even physical. Bondage affects your outlook on life and your future. They effect your relationships and your ability to understand God or even your desire to see Him.

The School of Freedom will introduce you to 3 classrooms. To become truly free, you must visit and graduate successfully from each one.

1. The Classroom of Reality

To be healed and set free we must understand this: Only the truth has the power to make us truly free. (John 8:32). To succeed in this classroom, what we think, believe, or dn't want to think or believe all submits itself to truth. We must accept 2 realities.

Reality 1: Our perception of reality may be wrong.

A false reality builds itself around pride, which is why Jesus couldn't minister to the arrogant and deceived Pharisees. Could you be wrong? Wrong about people, about the judgements you have made throughout your life, about how you've dealt with them? When you come to the fact that you could be wrong, you are at point of receiving freedom.

Reality 2: Only God has the truth

""I am the way, the truth and the life. NO ONE comes to the Father but through Me."" John 14:6

Jesus didn't say he was A truth. He was THE truth. Jesus is the only teacher in this classroom who is permitted to speak. A person who wants to argue with Jesus is put out of the class. The Bible is the exalted source of learning in Jesus' classroom. It is infallible.

If you're not sure the Bible is true or you think competing voices in the world may have a better answer than Jesus, you're not ready for this class. Jesus doesn't argue with unvelievers OR believers who doubt His word. He speaks clearly.

For many people in bondage, their problem isn't just deception, it's denial. A common way to deal with pain is to deny it. Denial ensures perpetual bondage. ""The cornerstone of bondage is denial. The cornerstone of freedom is truth."" Jesus KNOWS when we are lying.

The price of allowing truth into your life is temporary discomfort followed by a lifetime of freedom and joy. The price of deception or denial is temporary sedation from painful issues we want to avoid, followed by a lifetime of emotional, spiritual, and relational problems. The price to pay is the price of truth. When you pay the price, you are ready for the next classroom."

<P><FONT color=#000099>At one point in her life, Ann contemplated suicide. As she considered death a voice inside her told her there was a better way. She was led to a Bible in a bookstore and opened to Matthew 11:28-30 which reads ""<EM>Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.""</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>After reading this Ann gave herself to God. Jesus offers more than death. He offers eternal life!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>We CAN have an intimate relationship with God in this world even though we rely on relationships with other people. God created the relationship from the beginning with Adam and Eve and our separation with God was not His plan, but our decision to sin. God wishes to restore our closeness with Him. But in order to have this intimacy, we must accept that God is capable of being personal to us and is relational. God reveals himself in a personal manner. The name Jehovah in the OT means ""The self-existent One who reveals Himself."" </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Why does it appear that people are going through the religious motions without joy and peace? Sin is the first answer and most obvious. Sin separates us from God.&nbsp; Another issue is our past. We have unresolved issues which twist our perception of God. If your father was distant and detached, you may see God in the same light. How your father was to you is a great determiner of how you view God!!! Perhaps your father neglected you or you were abused. That could alter your perception on authority, trust, and love. Our relationship with God remains shallow and unfulfilling. If you are desiring to know God better and your father contributed to your perception of God, it's OK! God UNDERSTANDS! God is PERFECT and UNCONDITIONALLY LOVING. So how are these issues resolved?!?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Coping with your problem is NOT enough. Healing means your issues are removed. Of course all answers are contained in the Bible but<EM>&nbsp; </EM>will do my best to help. Only a complete relationship with Jesus can fully heal you. If you need to know what to pray, here is a prayer for you. It is my sincere hope that if you are not saved, that you pray this prayer sincerely to Jesus before embarking further on this journey. I was healed and you can be too, but only Jesus can help you.</FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#000099>Father, in the name of Jesus I open my heart to you. I confess that I am a sinner and have sinned against you and others. I receive the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and the power of His blood as the payment for my sins. By faith, I receive your forgiveness. Also, by faith I receive you into my heart. Thank you for loving me in spite of my sins and failures. Thank you for your wonderful grace that receives back a prodigal son and restores him to the relationship he left in sin. I commit myself to You and the process of healing and restoration in my life. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit and change me until I am whole, healthy, and in the right relationship with You and those You have put in my life. Please bless me and lead me. In Jesus' name, AMEN!!!</FONT></EM></P>
<P><STRONG>WARNING! Praying this prayer WILL CHANGE YOU! God will start to work on you from the inside out and you WILL BE CHANGED. I only say this because if you pray and are not sincere and don't change, you are NOT saved. Believing in God and Jesus does NOT mean you are saved! Only by accepting Jesus into your life can you begin to be healed.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Congratulations on your new life! Now you can start the journey to being fully healed of whatever is in your past that haunts you. And I'm glad I'm along for the ride.</STRONG></P>

"event","I had planned on starting this series a long time ago but never got around to me. *slaps myself*. So although I am pressed for time at the moment, I wanted to do an introduction.

Freedom From Your Past is by Pastor Jimmy Evans of Trinity Fellowship in Amarillo and the late Ann Billington. It's about healing and restoration  and breaking those ties that bind you in your christian faith and life in general. I personally knew I needed to learn to forgive but I didn't know how. I didn't know how to take all the pain away and give it to Jesus and be healed. While many events in my life were haunting me, more recent events within the past 6-8 years were really holding me back and bringing me down. And while I do realize there are people that won't understand my forgiveness and think I am not over it all, I am ok with that. It doesn't matter. I forgave them and prayed they would forgive me and it would all be over and ya know what? Ever since I prayed about it all my life has taken incredible turns in the positive! I finally realized what it was that was holding me back from growing spiritually and I do thank this book for teaching me how. 

Well basically, I plan on doing notes and outlines from this book because I think it could honestly help someone out there. Call me hopeless but I want my light to shine. I hope what I write helps at least ONE person out there and I can call myself successful. :)

PART I: THE INTRODUCTION

Is there another way to deal with our problems than a ""shrink""? Do Christians have the same techniques as the rest of the world to deal with our problems? You don't need to dredge up the past to get healed, but we do need to understand the association between our lives today and some of the significant events in our past. The past is NOT THE PAST until it has been RECONCILED in CHRIST. Things that negatively affected us in our past could still be affecting us today. 

Secular vs Christian approach: Many Christians suffer because they don't know how to reconcile their past. It's OK to get help. The only problem is that a Christian may not get the help they need when dealing with pain from a secular psychologist. Counseling from a pastor may be a better alternative. 

To those that say the Apostle Paul forgot what was in his past and moved ahead and that's what we need to do, well, Paul FORGAVE those that harmed him and RECONCILED it in Christ. Everything in his life was reconciled in Jesus. 

NEXT: FREEDOM FROM YOUR PAST PART II: PREPARING FOR FREEDOM


I will be working on these notes and get them up when I can! Happy Reading and have a Blessed day!

"event","1. Evangelism: To Make Disciples in Our Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the Ends of the Earth. -Matthew 28:18-20, Acts 1:8

When Jesus said go and make disciples, he didn't mean to go find saved people and teach them the Bible. He meant go find lost people and lead them to Christ and teach them the Bible. Our vision is to see people saved, healed, equipped, and mature!

Our Jerusalem is Southlake, our Judea is Dallas/Ft Worth, our Samaria is America, and our ends of the earth is the world.

2. To equip, train, and release believers for the work of the ministry. Ephesians 4:7-12

We believe God has uniquely gifted people. Our desire to help you discover that ministry, equip, train, and release you to do that ministry. We provide classes and leadership tracks to train, equip, provide opportunities for you to minister.

3. To worship God in spirit and truth. John 4:23-24

We desire to compose worship songs, cds, produce musical and dramatic productions to strengthen the Body of Christ.

4. To be an extension of mercy and grace. Ephesians 2:8-10, Proverbs 14:31

We desire to show God's kindness and compassion to every person that God brings across our path. We believe the world is sick of religion and is in desperate need of the message of grace. We desire to care for you and your family pastorally. 

5. To strengthen families and marriages. Malachi 2:14-16

We are committed to helping people discover all that God has for them in marriage and family life by teaching them truths from Scripture. The deterioration of marriages and families is one of the enemy's greatest areas of attack. Thus, marriage and family ministry is one of our strongest areas of emphasis."

"event","I thought I would add on here the background of my church. :)

Gateway Church, located in Southlake, Texas, is a non-denominational church that was born in the heart of Pastor Robert Morris in Sep. 1999.

The name Gateway was inspired  by Genesis 28:17, the place of Jacob's Ladder. ""This is none other than the house of God, the gateway to heaven!""

Popular culture today says that God is ""watching you from a distance."" Scripture says God is ""with you"" and even ""in you.""

The church was planted by the 8,000 member church Trinity Fellowship in Amarillo, Texas and held its first service at the Hilton Hotel with 180 members. Over the next two years, rapid growth propelled the church to move to a movie theater, then to Christ is King Church, and then to a rented facility with more than 1,000 weekly attendees.

On May 19, 2002, Gateway broke ground on a 30K sqft facility. Gateway had expanded to weekend services of 2,000 persons.

In 2001 the church had 4 pastors and one support person. Ny 2005, 30 pastors joined the staff and church membership rose to 8,000!

The church financials are dramatic as well. Gateway consistently gives over 10% of its funds to missions. In 2003, this young church invested $1.4 million in missions such as Life Outreach Intl which feeds 300K children each day in war torn parts of Africa. Other causes include crisis pregnancy centers, Jewish evangelistic organizations, and the national tv show Marriage Today. Gateway supports missionaries in Africa, China, Central America, South America and Eastern Europe.

When the church built the new $8.5 million building, by God's grace it paid cash. In 2003 the church built a $5 million expansion, again paid in cash. The boast here is not what a church can do, but what God and His principles can do.

""Give and it shall be given to you."" Give! Give forgiveness! Give mercy! Give understanding! Give patience! Jesus was saying that whatever you give is going to be given back to you-good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over.

""The keys to making our journey on earth an adventure of joy and purpose are to give when the Lord leads; help people know the love and goodness of God; keep the focus on God rather than on things; be generous, and allow God to do a work in our hearts,"" says Pastor Robert. ""These are the keys to living the blessed life."""

"event","This article in the women's mag my church put out made me think of Carly. I know she's due next week and my prayers are with her. Doubtful she would ever see this, I still want to put it on here.


""Your pregnancy is terminated.""

Somehow, I just couldn't comprehend what those words meant. I kept struggling to understand. My doctor looked very white and seemed very upset.

""Do you understand what I'm saying?"" he said. ""I think so,"" I replied, even though I really didn't.

He continued, ""Rowena, the baby has died. There's no heartbeat. I want you to carry this baby until you go into hard labor, which will be no longer than two weeks, then come to the hospital. I will have to help you deliver the baby.""

I looked at my mother and saw tears in her eyes. Reality came crashing in on me. Finally, I began to understand what was happening. How could this be? I'd been so careful to eat right and do everything the doctor said. I had toxemia since the third month of my pregnancy, but I had worked so hard to keep it under control. I had prayed so hard! How could this happen? The baby was seven and a half months and ready to be delivered! Why now? Today was the day I was planning to go to the hospital to deliver my baby. The doctor had only one explanation. ""The toxemia has severely damaged your kidneys. They couldn't handle the waste for both of you. I'm just glad I could save you.""

The words seemed very harsh, and I tried to take it all in as shock numbed me. I pulled myself together and prepared to leave. I felt as if I was in the middle of a terrible nightmare and I should be waking up soon. 

The next week was absolutely terrible! I had trouble sleeping and had nightmares when I did sleep, though God's presence was very real. He truly was my comforter. One day He gave me a wonderful vision of my baby girl waiting for me inside Heaven's gate. That one vision gave me such peace. It got me through the next few days, weeks and months; even now it is embedded in my memory. The labor finally started. I went to the hospital and delivered my baby girl. We had a graveside funeral and put away the nursery, a constant reminder of our baby. My kidneys were so severely damaged that the doctor said I would never survive another pregnancy. He wanted me to regain my health and come back to the hospital and have my tubes tied. Still, I just couldn't accept the doctor's diagnosis, ""No children!"" Being a mother was my life long dream! I knew I was destined to be a mother! As I began to get back to normality, the feeling I had deep inside me only grew stronger. I felt sure that one day I'd have children-I just knew it would happen!

One Sunday, months later, we had an exceptional church service. The Holy Spirit's presence was very real. As others were going forward for prayer, I felt a very clear impression that I should go forward and ask for healing for my kidneys. I knelt at the altar as my pastor's wife came to pray with me. As we prayed for God's healing, I felt such peace. I left that night knowing I'd obeyed God's leading.

Soon after that I went to the hospital for a tonsillectomy. While I was there the doctor decided to take x-rays of my kidneys. The next day, he came into my room with a very puzzled look on his face. ""I don't know what's happened, but I looked at your x-rays and called in five specialists to examine them. We compared the x-rays of your kidneys fifteen months ago to those taken yesterday and we all agree. They aren't the same kidneys. We don't know what's happened but these kidneys are perfect. There's no reason why you can't have children!""

Sixteen months later, I was once again in a hospital bed with tears rolling down my cheeks. This time, they were tears of joy as I held my eight pound seven and a half ounce baby boy. I cried as I thanked God for His wonderful love and healing. As I dedicated my baby to Him, I thanked Him for truly giving me the ""desires of my heart.""

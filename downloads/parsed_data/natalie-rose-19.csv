"event","i just got back from up north and it was great fun...me and my friend lindsay were being crazy. the first day we went on a paddle boat adn there were these guys and they were like ""hey want to hook up boats and have a party"" we were like uhhhh NO! and this one kid was like im wearing boxers OK. lol. then they were like want some vodka. no thanx. ya so the next day we went swimming off the boat and that was fun and we did other random things. but tuesday was the most fun we went on the boat and then we went into town and went to k-mart and walmart. that was fun then we had a bonfire and me and lindsay were lighting things on fire. for example we lit leaves, pine needles, bottles, bug spray, tanning oil, tanning lotion, and a plastic cup wghich we broke up and painted with nail polish ((retarted, i no)). then we went to bed and the next day we went to this arcade thing and we were supposed to go on go carts but noooooo. then we went on the boat again and my mom was being really gay so ya. stupid. then today we came home and im R E A L L Y bored.

"event","Right now im at angelas house and she just made me a pretty sweet live journal. We just got back from my house and we were hanging out with chelsea. Soon we will be swimming because it just stopped raining. if u jhave just read angelas entry then this is gonna be really boring to u. we have the same exact thing. first we sat around for a long time trying to think of what to do. then brilant angela thought of going to 7 11. Then a white truck almost killed us. But thats okay. Then i went riding on my Mr. Paul ((lol))after that we went down stairs and made a man named paul say dirty things. then we dropped chelsea off and here i am.

Though&nbsp;You're by my side.&nbsp; Is there selfishness and pride I've left in the way?&nbsp; Lord, God strip them from&nbsp;me this very day.&nbsp; I want Your LOVE.&nbsp; I want YOUR truth.&nbsp; Let our relationship be of and only YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Give us purity, give us holiness, give a willingness to becon where You call.&nbsp; Give us humility, grant us mercy.&nbsp; Give us forgiveness and love to&nbsp;see each day through.&nbsp; For in the end and coming days our judgment lies in You.&nbsp; Let our hearts obey thy every command.&nbsp; Let us draw what You will from this land and live&nbsp;as servants.&nbsp; Serving each other....knowing what it means to truly love another.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This&nbsp;I pray.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I am forever Yours. Amen.&nbsp; </p>"

"event","Where then does wisdom come from? 
Where does understanding dwell? 
God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells."" 
~Job 28:20, 23 

Oh, Wonderful Creator and Sustainer, 
wisdom lies in the Your steady hand. 
Help us to understand our fellowman 
and to be righteous and true to You. 


""I the Lord search the heart and examine the mind..."" 
~Jeremiah 17:10 

Lord, we know You. 
Search our hearts... 
take from us what is ours. 
Examine our minds 
to be more in line 
with all of You. 

""The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of God stands forever."" 
~Isaiah 40:8 

Jesus, let's run in fields, 
though even the dandelions fade, 
let us chase the sunrise 
or allow for our eyes to only gaze 
upon Your beauty. 
Your Magesty. 
oh, Savior, Surround me. 
Let Your word be firmly beneath 
our love. 
Forever we come to You. 

""Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace."" 
~Eph 4:3 

God, of us ALL, 
bring us together. 
Cast aside the differences 
that create barriers between 
those who carry Your love within. 
We need You to embrace us 
We need Your peace to settle our souls. 
Let not our bond be broken 
in You. 

""Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified, do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go."" 
~Joshua 1:9 

Spirit, of strength, 
give us your courage 
to step to Your will 
letting our own completely go 
Each morning that we rise 
we wish not to be terrified 
of the horrors in the night 
for You are by our side. 
Take Hold. 
Lift our heads to see Your Glory unfold. 
We are here before You. 
Today is in Your hands. 


""Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the Lord."" 
~Pslam 31:24 

Loving Holy Spirit, 
we trust Your voice 
to call us into purtity 
understanding and knowledge 
lasting peace, real joy, and love 
as Your have written. 
Let Your right judgement fall 
having mercy on us... 
for we humble lay our lives at Your feet. 
Forgive us...for not loving. 
Grant that we may have 
a little more of Jesus inside... :) 

Reverence for Your Holy Name 
we will forever sing and praise. 
Our hope for anything in this world 
our hopes for our brothers and sisters 
our hopes for one another come 
to life in You, alone. 
We love You. 
Come and sweep 
over us tonight."

"event","Well, let's see there any many things in life that just touch my heart...
Where do I begin...  (smile) for one, Jesus rocks! Quite simply I just love Him and everything else just flows from there.  He was/is an amazing, gentle, fun-loving guy.  I pray that I can be more like Him each day.  Along with JC, I love christian music because my heart just gets lifted up everytime I allow all the words to truly become more than a prayer.  I absolutely love nature.  Oh, here we go.  I have a confession to make.  I have to admit to you.  I am a full-blown sunset chaser.  Yep, that's right.:smile:.  I love to find the best spot to view the wonder of God's marvelous creation!  Then I stand in awe.  Ooo, and stars are beautiful too!  Ah.  I like to twirl (as Jake knows) and pick flowers....  I love to sing...I like Shakespeare...I like to play just about any sports (or at least I'll try)... for now, I think that's an A-okay beginning.

I was blessed with the opportunity to join this forum by Jake.  He is a friend that I treasure greatly on campus.  God is so good!  So many blessings, just WOW...I can never ever repay Him...  His love just blows me away... Isn't it just BEAUTIFUl? I know all of you would agree (smile).  I think that you will learn that beautiful and love are two words that I use frequently, however, I never mean them any less.  Each time, I say them I mean them with everything in me.  My heart speaks them often; becoming aware of the beauty and Love in every situtaion, even though it is difficult to see sometimes, I am learning to see with His eyes.  

I would first like to start off by saying that all of you here have such beautiful hearts.  In just reading some of the posts, I must admit, tears were flowing.  All Glory to God!  He is so alive and working in all of your lives!  In reading some of your messages, funny, crazy, sad, happy, in awe etc. I have found that lying underneath the simple and profound words...God has called you all to be incredible apostles--bearing His light into the world!  How beautiful!  I strongly encourage to you all, each and everyone of you...and please, please do not take this lightly or in a general way,  in your faith jounrey.  The road the lies aheas all of you is indeed one of blessings from the Most High...and just feel humbled and blessed to be able to communicate with you....and talk with you, listetn to you, for these moments. With that, I just wanted to say, ""Thank you...and may God bless you.""  You are all in my prayers. 

""Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier. Be the living expression of God's kindness; kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile."" --Mother Teresa"

"event","<DIV>I wrote this to my one and ONLY....He who holds me...He who walks beside me...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Oh, my dear friend, precious are you to me</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>...I love you so.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Not a single day, even with all the business that has been presented have I not thought of you...prayed for you and send all the love in my heart to you.&nbsp; It is late and I fear that I can not write much right now...but take this simple note...this small prayer and hold it dear.&nbsp; Because it has been ridiculously crazy....I will indeed write and tell you more....I promise.&nbsp; I really do.&nbsp; I am running a lot of activities, getting involved in everything I can.&nbsp; I go to bed at about 4:30am and wake up at 7:00am...only to do it over and over again.&nbsp; Studies are incredible!&nbsp; My theology classes have renewed my mind....exactly what I had been praying for!!!! I am in them, on the edge of my seat, furiously writing (scibbling) notes trying to soak it all in....I absorb evey second of it...and my professors have such a passion....the same passion that I rests in my own heart!&nbsp; Indeed, how incredible to listen and feel that you are the feet of Jesus learning how to love Him more!&nbsp; I have tons and tons of homework....and even more ""homework"" that I assign myself.&nbsp; I have been able to meet so many beautiful people....</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>for example the very first day I was here in the guys college dorm....I led praise and worship...(He really led...wink)...somehow many of the young men were interested in wanting to know Him more...we prayed openly....with outstreched hands...and sang....sang to Jesus.&nbsp; I am in awe and wonder....because no one would have ever thought it possible.&nbsp; Being&nbsp;at a) the guys college b) guys wanting&nbsp;to be there...instead of at some party c) letting God into our lives!&nbsp; I&nbsp;have really been showing all the&nbsp;men&nbsp;that in being a man of Christ, just how amazing that can be!&nbsp; How being holy and into one's faith is admirable....and&nbsp;especially how being holy is attractive...and makes one's life all the more rich and full.&nbsp; They are to be gentleman--whose hearts are for the Lord...and it is there where everything else will come.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;been&nbsp;running and coordinating little retreats....mini-woods/prayer walks...which I call ""walking with faith"" where we take little&nbsp;hikes into the beautiful campus area (it's beautiful here!..and you know how i love sunsets! sunrises!&nbsp; over the lakes here I can never get enough....and each night the stars are absolutely beautiful....and the trees....and grass...and everything!&nbsp; When I was spending time with my friend on mary 3 (one of the guys dorm floors...ha, I made&nbsp;every young man get out of him room and&nbsp;chase the sunset with me.....and they came!...then we talked&nbsp;about&nbsp;God...everyone came from different perspectives...but we arrived at the same place somehow.&nbsp; we were just sharing our stories...&nbsp; then another day&nbsp;we decided to have a hug day...and I just think that guys as much as girls need hugs...I&nbsp;mean real hugs...hugs that don't ask for much in return.&nbsp; because this is the thing....there are many girls that are sort of on this quest to meet someone...and&nbsp;I guess so many times (at least&nbsp;in the beginning people are doing that so much that they forget that they are missing out on these beautiful&nbsp;friendship just because they are not ""interested in that&nbsp;person"" as if one would only talk to those guys who they are ""interested in""...I don't know if that makes much sense&nbsp;but that is what I see.... So what I'm trying to say is that...as I told you before I am not searching any more... I am&nbsp;simply waiting in His love.&nbsp; While I am there...I feel compelled to love each&nbsp;person with this full-completely-whole-holy love.&nbsp; To give all those guys on that floor real and true hugs from heaven.&nbsp; (now there are places where I can not do this as easily but these men on that particular floor and one other one are so sweet and gentle...and they respect me....so they&nbsp;know my hugs are&nbsp;a little of His love that is overflowing)...so&nbsp;we have hus days...which is pretty much everyday...&nbsp; also, we gather to jam and&nbsp;play music all the time...which somehow always turns into a prayer....we have bon-fires...where we do more praise and worship.... the one day I was teaching them all how to dance...many of those guys were interested in learning (I mean real dancing...not like some of the gross stuff people do now, which is sometimes just like sex with&nbsp;one's clothes on....no I mean classic dancing)...&nbsp; anyway, they were all so cute...dancing with each other in the halls...trying to figure out....&nbsp; we are all so young at heart...so mant things could burden us...try to make us grow up....try to loose our innocense and pure nature...but I see that in each person here...and I tap into that I try to let that radiate and shine from within them...because in their heart I see God....&nbsp; that playful, fun-loving, let's just sit and sip hot cocoa...and talk is God.&nbsp; Ah, it is a lot of fun...and I guess I just really feel called to encourage them on their faith journey....and let them know that I am a sister through Christ...bearing the gift of love...because we all need that love.&nbsp; When I am not over at the boy's campus (being that we the girls are&nbsp;another (all classes are integrated) just&nbsp;dorms are separates)...when I'm not there... I'm here.&nbsp; Letting all the lovely girls know that they can be strong in who they are...they can be women of faith..women of morals and values&nbsp;different than those&nbsp;being portrayed in the media...I&nbsp;let them know jus how beautiful they are on the inside and the outside... it's amazing how we always doubt ourselves and try to lower our own hearts...&nbsp; In that way I try to give all my sisters love...and they too are just seeking real and true friendships one's that are above the pettiness...of ""getting nails done, shopping, taking about the latest fashion, or the cutest guys...etc.""&nbsp; We talk about realy things, our hopes and dreams....&nbsp; It just is so...well, God...the way that my brothers and sisters alike can place their trust in me with such things...I feel so blessed.&nbsp; Blessed above and beyond this world to be there with them, getting to know them....loving them...and seeing God in them....that is theology.&nbsp; While the definition maybe the study of God somehow that always brings us into relationships with one another...it is there that His love is most manifested....because Jesus came and taught....and showed us how to love.&nbsp; Ah, praise God....&nbsp; I fall at His feet each night...only to awake in the morn, and feel the warmth of His smile, saying ,""Arise, child, arise...is it another day for love.""</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Back to the prayer walks...we have scripture, reflection, and&nbsp;fun in the sun with Him.&nbsp; He also, has&nbsp;me doing a prayer-line as well 24-7.&nbsp; And here and there and all in between, living as a witness to Christ's love...always seems to bring spirit times. Those are all those small moments that you never planned...that just happened&nbsp;and He was in them...guiding you the whole time.&nbsp; They become sacramental...in a real sense.&nbsp; Being sanctified in Him.&nbsp; Ah, there are so&nbsp;many more things to share....</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>...you know me..you know how I could just&nbsp;go on and on to you...thank you for listening once more...&nbsp; I have missed&nbsp;writing you as&nbsp;often as I did...and once again I apologize... but as I said before you were never far from me.... not for on second did my soul ever allow your heart to drift from me.&nbsp; He held you ever close...reminding me of your presence....your mission...you journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though my e-mails...may have not come as often...you were never alone.&nbsp; I am sure you know this...but it does not&nbsp;hurt to remind you.&nbsp; He has been speaking to you...and sending you my&nbsp;humble words of encouragement in your fight to allow Him to be in control of everything...&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>...in a little way please do not be as shocked from not hearing from me...<EM>for you have</EM>...(tear)...&nbsp; It just has been in a little different way...for that is all that time has currently permitted....&nbsp; Instead of reading words from my heart...I have been the prayer warrior....relying solely upon Him to deliver my messages of love, joy,&nbsp;peace, and hope to you.&nbsp; I do hope you have received them in&nbsp;small ways.&nbsp; <EM>God whispers are all around you...&nbsp; </EM></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Hmmm, lol, maybe he just wants me to keep shocking you...&nbsp;It's all His doing really. (smile)&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>However, I have now wanted to most certainly respond to you in words....and know that I will continue to write you...the words upon my heart-and the words across these pages...I'm sorry beloved...buy you just will never ever be able to rid yourself of me (wink).&nbsp; We are bound by the sprirt...one in our race of running after Him, dancing in His arms,&nbsp;giving and loving Him with our lives....&nbsp; no one, nothing can separate what is bound in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; We are so utterly His that our covenantal relationship is ever changing because of Christ's change-less truth.&nbsp; So together we grow in our love and in our hearts....knowing well, that we are servants...and by that we are one with Him. (smile)&nbsp; My heart will always hold you....&nbsp; I just want you to know that. (smile).&nbsp; I mean it.&nbsp; &nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And back to the business, there are some days I just want to break down...I know you&nbsp;probably can most certianly&nbsp;identify, but somehow He keeps us strong.&nbsp; He our sheild as you said.&nbsp; He is our rock.&nbsp; We stand upon Him, and the waves of the storms&nbsp;can not penetrate our spirits.&nbsp; &nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Friend, we exist in a constant embrace.&nbsp; We are constantly being held in the arms of our Loving Father.&nbsp; I just want you to know that...feel that once more... I have not read you're other e-mail yet, but I just wanted to send some words to let you know that&nbsp;I am here in Minnesota and that God has been the source of my everything here.&nbsp; Each day the journey has been absolutely incredible.&nbsp; Right now, I am crying...crying because I do not even know how He could bless me with so much beauty in every day....so much love...so much joy and pain...and sorrow....but always more peace and hope to over it all.&nbsp; Somehow, He just takes me...just lifts me up into His arms....and our dance...you know...has all been in the air lately.&nbsp; My feet can not even touch the ground.&nbsp; I am His and each moment belongs to Him...&nbsp; Leading campus ministry has opened so mant doors, I have pretty much been given reign to do what ever I want...which means that He can do what ever He wants....we are not limiting Him....</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Lord of all Creation, of water, earth, and sky...heaven's all your tabernacle...Glory to the Lord on High!&nbsp; God of wonders beyond our majesty, you are holy HOLY!&nbsp; The universe diplays you're majesty...Father, Lord, God almighty!&nbsp; Jesus, we fall down before your throne.&nbsp; Take our lives and make them whole.&nbsp;Enter our hearts each new day, so that we can become your love to all--in every way.&nbsp; You are the One we wait for.&nbsp; You are the One our souls yearn for.&nbsp; You are the One we are yearning for...so send your Love to us today.&nbsp; Bring your healing rain to wash away the pain, send&nbsp;down the fire&nbsp;so that evil will be no more,&nbsp;take&nbsp;our burdens&nbsp;and carry them away, so that&nbsp;we can be free--free to&nbsp;Love as never before.&nbsp; Help us to let go, of all that holds us back, so that we can step forward into the Light of your&nbsp;will...&nbsp;Unite us. Unite our hearts as we battle with and for you...unite us.&nbsp; Take us. Hold us.&nbsp; Mold us.&nbsp; Make us Your own.&nbsp; Lord, prepare us to be your sanctuary.&nbsp; We are&nbsp;living temples of&nbsp;your Son.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow us to believe that each&nbsp;and every moment.&nbsp; <EM>Yes, dwell in us.</EM>&nbsp; Be our&nbsp;Love.&nbsp; Be our life.&nbsp; Our everything.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thank you for your&nbsp;prayers...they&nbsp;have been received with&nbsp;arms wide open.&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You are in my prayers....<EM>forever and ever</EM>....&nbsp;Alone in prayer we meet.&nbsp; Thank you for writing...thank you for being a beloved,&nbsp;most precious friend in Him.&nbsp;We love you more than you'll ever know.&nbsp; (smile)&nbsp; &nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>A</STRONG>cting upon His words,</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>W</STRONG>aiting in His Love,</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>E</STRONG>ver-giving of my heart to you,</DIV>

"event","<DIV>This is a letter I wrote to a beloved friend of mine...&nbsp; I&nbsp;just want to lift this up to Christ....we surreneder all!&nbsp; It thus began:&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Hello...&nbsp; Ha, so you knew I would respond so...,huh?.&nbsp; Well, what can I now say, but that I'm thoroughly predictable...(smile) while, that may be true...I know the truth of the matter is&nbsp;""the seeing into&nbsp;my heart"" part..for some reason&nbsp;you always manage to do that&nbsp;(wink: smile).&nbsp;&nbsp;I was thinking today.&nbsp; <EM>Heart gifts</EM> are the best, in my opinion.&nbsp;:) The way that someone can bear the gifts that He has placed within them--whatever they are, and allow Christ to completely manifest Himself into&nbsp;their heart--their life, becoming their everything...&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel that is something that we both stirve to do...each day.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In my mind I often say, ""I lift up this moment, Jesus.""--whether overwhelmed with&nbsp;joy or fear&nbsp;or dissappointed or&nbsp;tranquility.&nbsp; Lifting it up, just always seems to make whatever gift the day was His...and usually He returns it in some&nbsp;beautiful way.&nbsp; He's a giver and a lover that One (smile)...as are you. :)&nbsp;&nbsp;...though, it is as if my&nbsp;inner&nbsp;life being lifted up&nbsp;becomes all the brighter, the grass greener, and the snow&nbsp;whiter than before.&nbsp; Indeed, as Henri Nouwen put it, ""the great mystery&nbsp;is that a&nbsp;small, often quite immaterial gesture can change my heart so much.""&nbsp; In a real sence, the way to the heart always seems to be a quiet, gentle way.&nbsp; The way of Jesus.&nbsp; The way of His LOVE.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It is living from the heart that makes life worth it, because it casts aside the phony,&nbsp;busy, distractions so that we can readily become.&nbsp; It is to contemplate the spiritual beauty that exists within us all and act upon it.&nbsp; I believe that deep within the heart of every person there is beauty inside his/her soul...sometimes it takes a lot of years for them to find it within, and other times I feel that there are some who live their life never even wanting to discover it...but that beauty is always there...waiting to be unveiled.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It is interesting because I was reading up on contemplative life in this book and how the Greeks fathers were known as dioretic.&nbsp; Now, in art history I knew this, but not why...&nbsp; <EM>Diorao</EM> means to see into, to see through.&nbsp; I never knew that.&nbsp; I believe...no, I know&nbsp;that is the way that He sees.&nbsp; Looking in O.T. (Old Testament), when God was speaking to Samuel about David being the anointed one he said... Oh, I love this part!&nbsp; Because Samuel, was looking constanly through all the brothers...examing them--saying ""this one Lord? well, how about him? okay, this one looks like a great warrior, leader?""&nbsp; But God had other plans...always does (smile).&nbsp; The surprise was in store...it would come...""just wait, Samuel...I&nbsp;will&nbsp;show Him to you..."", God&nbsp;thought.&nbsp; And then poor Samuel felt exhausted and his shoulders probably just kinda shrugged (in a ""I give up kind of way"")...""Lord, I've gone through them all...""&nbsp; Oh, Samuel, look in the distance...you have not yet met the future king.&nbsp; But wait, you, see that young man there--the&nbsp;shepherd playing upon his lyre on the hill.&nbsp; I can almost see Samuel's face--his brows furrow and his lips mutter the non-audible words, ""him? and then under his breath, ""no way...I think maybe... Are you sure?""&nbsp; And then God speaks, he doesn't boom from the sky, or send and angel... He simply whispers, ""Samuel, my ways are not like yours.&nbsp; God does not see as man sees...&nbsp; &nbsp;You look upon the way they appear to you<EM>, I look into their hearts</EM>.""&nbsp; Wow, I just love that!&nbsp; I can apply that story in so many ways.&nbsp; I can think immediately of ten different instance where I feel like Samuel...a little lost...and then waiting upon His plan...or even being David...not reallying thinking I have anything worthy to give...a king--a princess to Him...&nbsp; He really thinks so...awh, shucks. ..or unadmittedly being the other brothers thinking Lord,&nbsp;choose me for this...come on...please.&nbsp; Don't you see it all!&nbsp; Most important I love how God let's us in on a little of the mystery in His ways.&nbsp; <EM>He does not see as we do</EM>...&nbsp; He sees hearts!!!&nbsp; I want to do that!&nbsp; I know how desperatly we long to see with His eyes...&nbsp; The way that He&nbsp;looks upon His beloved children and does not only see their malnutrition, or lives stricken with poverty, but He longs to bring hope...and lavish His love upon them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel these words almost childishly reverberate through my entire body, ""I want to be like, Jesus"".&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I know I have talked about this before..but I want to see everyone's heart gift.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Oh, God, my Father, I want to give my own heart gift to you.&nbsp; I want our song to be a ""heartsong"".&nbsp; &nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I stumbled across this kind of ""cheese-ball"" (as you once said) poem the other day.&nbsp; But I like it despite the cheese,&nbsp;and it reminded me of you:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Heart Gifts</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It's not the things that can be bought</DIV>
<DIV>that are life's richest treasures,</DIV>
<DIV>It's just the little ""heart gifts""</DIV>
<DIV>that money cannot measure--</DIV>
<DIV>A cheerful smile,</DIV>
<DIV>a friendly word,</DIV>
<DIV>a&nbsp;gesture of love</DIV>
<DIV>are priceless little treasures </DIV>
<DIV>from the storehouse of our God.</DIV>
<DIV>They are the things that can't be&nbsp;bought</DIV>
<DIV>with silver or with gold,</DIV>
<DIV>For thoughtfulness and kindness</DIV>
<DIV>and love are never sold--</DIV>
<DIV>They are the priceless things in life</DIV>
<DIV>for&nbsp;which no one can pay,</DIV>
<DIV>and the giver finds rich recompense</DIV>
<DIV>in giving them away.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You give precious gifts...,</DIV>
<DIV>with your own special touch,</DIV>
<DIV>Your listening and sharing</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;and caring, oh, so much,</DIV>
<DIV>Your hand reaching out&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>in a kind, thoughtful way,</DIV>
<DIV>I know that your smile&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>can brighten the cloudiest day...</DIV>
<DIV>(for even though I can not see, I sense it could...</DIV>
<DIV>because in our e-mails you do this for me)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And the gifts that you give&nbsp;can't be put on shelf--</DIV>
<DIV>They'll be kept in my heart...</DIV>
<DIV>for you give of yourself.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; <BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I believe that by acknowledging our heart gifts...this is how we celebrate the presence of the living Christ among us, at the center of our lives, at the center of our being, at the heart of our community, at the heart of the creation.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>....ever since you wrote about those children...&nbsp; I could not stop from thinking&nbsp;about them.&nbsp;---their adorable smiles...their eagerness to give hugs and swarm all around you...&nbsp;&nbsp;....I want to send them more than my sympathy...for that does nothing.&nbsp; I would send them all the money I have, if I only could...&nbsp; I have&nbsp;great compassion for them, but that is not enough.&nbsp; I just want to love them.&nbsp; I want&nbsp;to wrap my arms around them and carry them away...all of them away to care for them forever.&nbsp; You know what amazes me though, how I can have a hard day...and it really is nothing... I&nbsp;know that those&nbsp;sweet children have been through a lot...they have all the excuses and reasons in the world not to smile...yet, they choose to smile anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;They greet with thier dirty little hands and their grubby little cheeks...&nbsp;...they are beautiful!&nbsp; I just want them to know that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of them makes me cry....&nbsp; Many would look at their situations and ask how could they? ...how&nbsp;could they still&nbsp;want to love--and at that give love...and receive love?&nbsp; They have Him inside, that is why--in their hearts...He is there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to send them oodles and oodles of prayers.&nbsp; I know that prayers do not even seem enough sometimes, but for now,&nbsp;I feel that is what God wants me to do.&nbsp; As you put it, (smile) prayer warrior I'll&nbsp;be.&nbsp; Each morning and night that I hug my brothers... I pray deeply for them and for you...and hold them there....&nbsp; Because beyond all the emotions of rejection and abandonment that they may feel there is love, real love, lasting love, love that comes from a God who became flesh and who will never leave His children alone...&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Right now...that love has found a home inside of you...and others.&nbsp; I just want to love them...so I send all my love to you.&nbsp; And I want you to feel His love...so I send more love to you.&nbsp; You are His hands.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>At this exact moment, I turned to a page in my book...It read:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Weeping and mourning are considered by many people as signs of weakness. They say that crying will not help anybody. Only action is needed.&nbsp; And still, Jesus wept over Jerusalem; he wept also when he heard that his friend Lazarus has died.&nbsp; Our tears reveal to us the painful human condition of brokenness; they connect us deeply with the inevitability of human suffering; they offer the gentle context for compassionate action.&nbsp; If we cannot confess out own limitations, sin, and mortality, then our well-intended actions for the making of a better world easily backfire on us and become expressions of an undirected anger and frustration.&nbsp; Our tears can lead us to the heart of Jesus who wept for our world.&nbsp; As we weep with him, we are led to his heart and discover there the most authentic response to our losses.&nbsp; The tears shed by the women of Nicaragua and the millions who mourn their dead throughout the world, can make our sol rich with the fruits of compassion, forgiveness, gentleness, and healing action.&nbsp; We, too, must weep and so become more and more humble people.&nbsp; We become His hands.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I believe He wanted you to know that. (smile, through the tears).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Today, I don't think I was His hands... I was way to selfish...it makes me sick sometimes...wanting to get this or that for my dorm, worrying about all my loans, trying to meet deadlines...upset that so many customers were rude...felt like time just flew...&nbsp; But you know what, I felt God in a couple small moments...sometimes He pulls me aside... other times He just jumps out to become my ""daisey/dandelion"" on a dumpy day.&nbsp; Today he smiled at me, when&nbsp;my&nbsp;teller friend&nbsp;was&nbsp;so excited to see me this morning...and when the little girl was crying in our store...&nbsp; Her mother seemed to be ignoring her and she was just so tiny...I asked her what was wrong; her finger got hurt.&nbsp; So I kissed it, not caring about company policies, and I just had to wipe her tears and say, ""oh, I'm sorry... Here it will get better... Let me show you something special...&nbsp; So I turned on this gigantic old music box we have, and the music silenced her at once.&nbsp; She was too short to see it so I lifted her up on a barrel so she could view the large disc being touched in the groves ever so slightly by the machine.&nbsp; I must say she was mystified by the melodious sound, that she forgot about her finger.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; I didn't do much... I then just went back to work, plenty of people wanting to purchase their fudge, caramels, candy sticks...etc.&nbsp; With my head pretty much glued to the bar codes because everyone just wanted to get in and out today...not many for chit-chat...I looked up after ringing the last in line and the father said, ""Sarah, thank you.""&nbsp; He just looked into my eyes...and I felt like crying.&nbsp; I did not really do anything....but you know what...I felt God in those eyes.&nbsp; And then he politely strolled away.&nbsp; That was how in the midst of my little pity party, God snapped me out of it.&nbsp; And while I scrambling around trying to do this or that...for a couple seconds, I embraced His beautiful gift of warm smiles, music, and children...and yet that would behold the&nbsp;best gift of all: He smiled, He sang, and He said thank you...for being you.&nbsp; Gosh, He is so good!&nbsp; He decided to make me His hands in whatever small way He could...even with my stubborness in the way.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If only we look into our hearts, look at God's hand and our own...&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I realize that ever since I&nbsp;came to know God's hand--not the powerful hand controlling the course of history..but as the powerless hands of Jesus asking to be grasped by a caring human hand--I looks differently at&nbsp;my own hands.&nbsp; Just as&nbsp;Henri Nouwen described he did.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I think we have come to see God's powerless hand reaching out to me from everywhere in the world, and the clearer I see it, the closer these outstretched hands seems to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;""The hands of the poor begging for&nbsp;food, the hands of the lonely calling for simple presence, the&nbsp;hands of teh children asking to be lifted up, and held,&nbsp;the hands of the sick hoping&nbsp;to be touhced, the hands of the unskilled&nbsp;wanting to be trained--all these hands are that hands of the fallen Jesus waiting to come and give him their hand.""&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>""One of the most life-giving images is that of a human hands reaching out to each other, touching each other, interconnection and merging...""&nbsp;&nbsp;That always makes me think of Michelangelo's&nbsp;Sistine Chapel painting of Creation...where God's hands are reaching to give life to Adam...or the way a mother cradles her infant...or when lovers walk hand in hand...when a child clings to his fathers hand...when two dance across a ballroom floor...when mother teresa would reach to grasp a feeble hand of a toothless peasant...with&nbsp;hopeless eyes...asking for love.&nbsp; In this same way,&nbsp;we have&nbsp;been given the power to&nbsp;let Him come insde and&nbsp;give gifts of our hands--our hearts--flying open the doorways to our souls.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Oh, Jesus these are our hands...move them at the impulse&nbsp;of&nbsp;Your love. &nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It is true that there is a temptation in me to think about the begging hands of the people in Calcutta, Cairo, or New York, far far away....and not to see the open hands reaching into my own living space.&nbsp; Each night&nbsp;I think about that...and I&nbsp;pray for all those hands that I somehow missed...just by being consumed in the&nbsp;""me"".&nbsp; I look at my hands and I am now asking them; ""Did you reach out&nbsp;to one of the open hands around you and bring a little bit of peace, hope, courage, confidence? ~*~*~, you must...these hands are not your own, they are God's...let your heart shine through them.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>...I&nbsp;want you to know that&nbsp;I am reaching for your hand...&nbsp; --to let you know, that you are special to me and to God.&nbsp; I am reaching because I too want&nbsp;to&nbsp;give those&nbsp;children, teenagers, adults love with you and through prayer... I am reaching to just bring whatever little love I can into your heart--from&nbsp;the Big guy and myself.&nbsp;(smile)&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Sending&nbsp;Love and love and more&nbsp;love and prayers,</DIV>
<DIV>~*~*~...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Oh, and spring break is what just what I was thinking as well...&nbsp;I know the&nbsp;school has designated places for alternative spring breaks already...and they picked out their coordinaters last year...but you never,&nbsp;know. I'll let&nbsp;Him work on this one with me.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;go, where ever He sends me.&nbsp;:)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I just picked up another book where Mother Teresa said, ""The poor do not need our condescending attitude or our pity.&nbsp; They only need our love and our tenderness....</DIV>
<DIV>God does not call us to do great things but to do small things with great love...the important thing is not to do a lot or to do everything.&nbsp; The important thing it to be ready for anything, at all time; to be&nbsp;convinced that when serving the poor, we are really serving God.""&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>""I am in the least of my brothers and sisters."" -Jesus&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Lord, Jesus,&nbsp;thank You for the heart gift of our convenant&nbsp;relationship in You.&nbsp; May You continue to strech our horizons and create Your own image there.&nbsp; Let Your Light Shine!&nbsp; We see&nbsp;You&nbsp;there.&nbsp; We want to serve you.&nbsp; Oh, God we humble our hearts before you...we bow down.&nbsp; We&nbsp;want to love like&nbsp;You. Amen.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>:)&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>He is indeed moving,&nbsp;and I assure you, we both are growing in more ways than we'll ever know... </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Keep changing our hearts, Oh, Father!&nbsp; Bless Your&nbsp;children....all those&nbsp;in Nicaragua...young and old...everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we&nbsp;weep for them...You also weep.&nbsp; Send Your love....Jesus.&nbsp; As we see them suffer...You suffer with them.&nbsp; Their passion, becomes Your own...so You can&nbsp;heal our brokenness.&nbsp; We all long for more of You. Yes, we long for You.</DIV>"

"event","<P>So God, it's been a while since we last talked here...in this place. (smile) Yet, I find myself right now, really feeling alone. Not a type of lonely alone...but just a place of solitude. A place where I feel it's you and me and nobody...no one is watching. I think I may be too self absorbed in this phase...I'm a very relational person, u know. I thrive off giving and I don't think that I'm giving that much here... I really don't like the fact that I am asking if I can go here or there so I can buy this or that for myself. I don't like buying things for myself...sure some nice cloths every now and then )and then those CD's!!!), but lately it's been so much to prepare for college that I very much dislike it. It feels completely self-centered as if I do not have that problem already. I am trying to work through it though...so keep helping me out, okay. And then maybe someday when you've worked out the kinks in my heart, you'll lead me... to where I'm supposed to be, with whom, and doing exactly what pleases You. Ah, I'm so tired right now...I don't know why. I'm excited about college...sad to leave... Friends...do so often come and go....despite whether they say they'll remember me...i know we are moving in different directions...I'm also fed up with a lot of things...so much so that I don't get it and just want to sleep...praying it will all be back where it was... Oh, summer went too fast, but I'm ready to move on into the world you've prepared for me... I am just sorry that I disappoint you. Really. I don't think I did much with this summer for You and I just want you to know that I'm yours. I am bowing before you...crying all the love out of my heart at your feet. Please, come and fill me. You gave me so many gifts this summer and what have I done for you....and what have I offered you? I've given you my life, but that is not enough. You have all my love, but I want to give you more. My soul and everything are yours, I tell you each night each morning each day...then God, why does my heart hurt? I don't even know when it came in...or how it got there.&nbsp; And God, it better not be that....no, I'm done with that. You know it.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; </P>
<P>If my heart is yours and you are all I need how come there appears to be a hole of some sort.&nbsp; Is it only an illusion...am do I only think I have a hole...&nbsp; I don't even know what it is, and it frustrated me that I can't put my finger on it. I pray it's not because....If truth be told, I'm just weak.&nbsp; That's part of it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;For some reason I keep falling...if, only it could be the good kind (wink).&nbsp; I falter in all my ways. I mess up the steps to our dance, and I try to sing the wrong harmonies to your song of love over me. I am not sympathetic enough, I think I'm growing more impatient, and just want that simple LOVE you have created me for. </P>
<P>I just want to HUG you. So badly. I just want to feel you wrap me in all you are and fall asleep right there in your arms. Your GLORY Lord, is all I want to see. Your LOVE should be all that matters to me... Yet I get so tangled in the webs of friendships...relationships. Praise you, God for allowing a special one to creep into my life, purely for your honor.&nbsp; I no nothing of our friendship except every time I leave I know more about you in a clear and direct way.&nbsp; You didn't plan that...did you? I didn't think so...(smile).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Random thought: You know who I'm really going to miss....Tommy. I love him. I love the way he makes me laugh, I love the way that I try to tell him things and he'll just ignore me and then later comes to me to tell me some random story that he thinks is important...and I just soak it all up. I love how we jam on our guitars even though I'm bad at it and he wishes that I was better.&nbsp; I love it when he will try to play ""his music"" for me, one's that I like because he knows I'm in the car...&nbsp; Or how he'll show me a new song he learned and it's group that I like.&nbsp; I love how his new friends are so cute and friendly to me.&nbsp; I love seeing him grow.&nbsp; I'm going to miss that.&nbsp; I know I'll still see it, just I want to be here for it all, and I can't.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love our time together when we just lay there and talk late at night.&nbsp; We've done that a lot this summer...and I'm going to miss it. It amazes me, how there can be someone in you're life that you love with all your heart...and know, know with everything in you that...things are not going to be the same. And you can't take them with you where you're going.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though you wish you could.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I have no idea what Christ felt like being sent on His Mission...but if part of the mission is this solitude, alone, being sent before type of thing....boy, do I feel for Him...because, sometimes, it just plain is hard.&nbsp; I know he said it wouldn't be easy...that's because He went through it...and learned the same way that we do.&nbsp; I think Jesus, was happy to reunite with His Heavenly Father...but I know that he, in his human heart, wished he could just stay and be with Mary, his mother who showered him with&nbsp;humanly love&nbsp;and John, the way he always&nbsp;made him laugh and then out of breath because of all the games they played running around, Peter, who&nbsp;challenged him, Judas, whom he just wanted to see his own potential...&nbsp;He knew it was for a reason though...&nbsp; I just pray that what I am doing is for a reason...to further your kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to just live for you...I want to be&nbsp;YOUR LOVE to other for Your names sake...not my own.&nbsp; Send your angels, Jesus.&nbsp; Carry me,&nbsp;where you&nbsp;desire...&nbsp; Your desire is my own.&nbsp; I may not always show you this...but I know this to be true.&nbsp; Wash me clean of all my selfishness...and&nbsp;let only peace remain.&nbsp; Right now, I know that this life is not my own...any good that comes from me, is only You...Jesus.&nbsp; I can&nbsp;do nothing on my own.&nbsp; I am totally and uterlly dependant upon you.&nbsp; Yet, I pray that you&nbsp;bless me.&nbsp; Bless me beyond what I can comprehend,&nbsp;so that I may endure.&nbsp; I will go through the fire for you...but I need to hold your hand the whole way through...you do not have to go before me, you&nbsp;do not even need to stay behind me to cover my dusty tracks....just rest beside me...that is enough.&nbsp; That is all I want.&nbsp; I need that Love right now, Jesus...&nbsp; because I feel a little empty....&nbsp; I feel I can not give&nbsp;to others as I should....&nbsp; because I do not have&nbsp;Love...&nbsp; even though I know of your love...and you send it upon me each day...&nbsp; I focus sometimes, on the love which I do not have...&nbsp; Cast my eyes&nbsp;away from such a love...&nbsp; Lift my&nbsp;chin, so that&nbsp;I may glance into your&nbsp;eyes... and behold love mafe present within...&nbsp; Let me kiss your hands... and weep, with my tears falling upon your feet.&nbsp; Love.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I want to have a heart like Jesus...desperately...yet, I&nbsp;keep messing it up....&nbsp; Make me a new.&nbsp; Let all that is no of you be crucified, so that my life be bear the risen Lord's Light.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I pray other's can understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;he will understand, when the time is right.&nbsp; Let him be strong in waiting for me.&nbsp; I am waiting still.&nbsp; Ever waiting with You...which, is more than enough for me.&nbsp; Too feel your love move&nbsp;through the&nbsp;air around me is life giving.&nbsp;&nbsp;I worship you, Lord with my love.&nbsp; he will someday find my heart,&nbsp;when he asks for it from you.&nbsp; Someday.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I pray for all the children in Nicaragua....heal them, comfort them, bring them hope.&nbsp; Brings their families whatever they need.&nbsp; Be with our&nbsp;men serving over&nbsp;seas...they will not be forgotten.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be&nbsp;with those who&nbsp;suffer, those who are dying (physically, emotionally, and spiritually).&nbsp; Bless all the&nbsp;people of the world...God, this is not general.&nbsp; I ask for each and every single person...send them Love...your love.&nbsp; I pray we can all be still enough, silent enough, to feel your whispers.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I heard them today...each time I fall...each&nbsp;time&nbsp;I worry...or cry inside...I hear them...&nbsp; I heard them when I was elated and overjoyed as well...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep, speaking to me in the silence, Jesus.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Upon my lips, forever I will say, ""Thank you, Lord and Savior.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I love you...</P>
<P>I love you...</P>
<P>I love you...""</P>
<P>May my life say Amen.&nbsp; </P>

"event","Jesus...my love,

I do hope that my life is a prayer...speaking to you every minute of the day.  

Every time that I stumble, I know that you are there, I know you watch me when I'm angry. I know that you are with me, letting me feel remorse for harsh words spoken.  I know that every word I say to another, I am indeed saying to you...no matter who they are, no matter what they've done.  I understand that I should approach each situation as you would. And God, you always knew what to do.  How to not let someone walk all over you, but still get your point across and leave them thinking about it...how to bring love, when only hate dwells...how to spread peace, when the storm within brews strongly.  

I also know that every time I sing...you are the unseen harmonious voice that blends in the backgroud, bringing the entire piece to life.  When I dance you are there with me laughing, twirling, guiding my steps, wisking me into your arms.
 
I can always feel your arms around me.  Thank you Sweet Savior...I sometimes forget.  All Glory to you Lord!  

I often wish...oh, I wish all the time, that you could come down, if only for a day and be with me, I mean physically be with me!  Oh, how I love you!  I believe in you with everything I am.  I know, I feel within every part of me that Your light is the only light, that Your truth is the only truth, and that Your way is the only way.  Your spirit has shown me this, each morning, afternoon, evening, and night...from the dawning of each day until the setting of the sun...You unveil each new promise to me.  You delight in me, Jesus!  Even before I professed me love for you...I want to have that kind of love.  Give give Give.  The little that I give, you never cease to fill my cup again.  In fact, you fill it so much that it is canstantly overflowing!!!  How gracious and beautiful Your love is!  I shall never stop worshiping Your Name!...never stop pouring into my soul. 

I treasure all You have blessed me with deep inside my heart.

Now, I wanted to thank you for Oprah today.  Now, I think you use her in many ways.  One, being that today there is so much filth on the t.v., that her, Dr. Phil, and occassionaly some other comedies are the only things that I'll watch.  For I'd rather be spending time learning more about you, than watching whatever junk on t.v. wasting my time, when I could be filling it with someone wonderful. (although, sometimes you and i like to just chill on the couch and eat popcorn.) Anyway, back to what I was telling you...thank you for the show today.  Seriously Jesus, you speak every single day to me!  Its unbelievable! The funny thing is, it suprises me even though I ask you and pray, ""Lord, speak to me"".  Did I not think that you would do it!  lol, of course you fulfill our needs...but suprises that come from the joy in your heart are always amazing...so I welcome them always...(hands down).  Okay, so onto the interview.  Hallie Berry was on today, being just as gorgeous as can be,...and she was talking to Oprah about how she just got a divorce..etc.  Her first husband abused her, and her second husband was ""addicted"" to women. She said that she could never trust again, and that she would never get married again...never.  She just couldn't because she felt that being single is just fine, and that she doen't need a man to compete her any more.  Meanwhile, Benjamin Bratt came on because they are starring in a movie together.  He sat down, and immediately Oprah, pointed out that, ""isn't Hallie just one of the nicest girls?""...in repsonse he said with the utmost sincerity, ""Next to my wife, yes, she is a wonderful person.*sweet smile*""  I thought it was sweet that he even thought of his wife, because especially in hollywood, relationships tend to be pretty unstable or short term.  He proceed to say, ""And like my wife, Hallie posseses not only physical beauty, but a beauty that radiates inside...that's what so amazing *another broad smile*"" (I was thinking, WOW...because he spoke with such honesty, you could see in his eyes that he wasn't trying to impress anyone.)  Oprah then showed pictures of his new baby girl.  She was absolutely adorable...so precious and beautiful.  She definitely has Bratt's eyes. When her pictures popped up on the big screen, he just lit up.  I could see he was so proud.  Oprah, asked him a question to confirm a statement.  She said, ""Is it true that you and your wife have chosen not to have someone else care for your child?""  Bratt flashed another big white smile, only this time it sustained itself, and lingered throughout his reply: ""Well, yes...that was the way that we grew up and their is something so special in being able to take part in your child's life like that.  Any parents out there understand, that while it is hard, hard work...there is such a reward. *spark in his eyes*  I mean, our jobs are very important to us.  But I would push away work anytime, to be together as a family.  Right now, she is our focus...she is our love *soft nod of confirmation with a sigh*."" (How wonderful is his spirit that he is man enough, to be senitive and have his priorities focused.  I always thought he was cute, but now I truly respect him....and he kept going...) Oprah, then referred to his wife and commented, ""Is it true that you said your wife is 'not the kind of girl you just date, she's the kind you marry'"".  He widened his kind grin, and said lovingly, ""Oh, yeah...heck, I only dated her for six months and then I proposed.  She is so full of life...so full of passion...so full of love.  That's not the kind of girl that a guy could just date.  I met her and knew she was so special...I knew then that I had to grasp her, ask her to be with me always.  She is everything to me...(and then turning to Hallie) Hallie, I'm sorry...I think that it's sad (referring to her ""I'll never marry statement"")...I mean, I know that that's how you feel, and I respect that...but marriage is so beautiful.  I know that when we get hurt, we just want to bottle it up inside sometimes, and not let that happen agian, but it's not always like that.  What I have I wouldn't trade for anything in the world...and I just think that you shouldn't close that door...God works in mysterious ways..."" (With that Bratt just spilled his heart for us all to see...what a message...what hope!  what great love!  I knew that you were shinning through him.)

I knew they existed...some where out there.  Thank you.  I love you Jesus! God bless him!...and all those who let the fire of your love burn within!"

"event","Okay, so Jesus how are you?...I've been seeing you in chapel a lot lately. And you know as well as I do that I need all the help that I can get on these exams.  I'm borderline A/B in almost all of them.  Please, let me use what I know and pull through.  Thank you.

But what I really wanted to write to you about was that new song that you helped me find, the one about ""what have you been doing lately"" by relient k.  yeah, that reminds me of... people.  I mean, the way that sometimes you get to see the best of someone and then it just seems that they sort of feel put into a box, they want out because they feel that they are really not being themselves or something.  yet, I do know that who i end up discovering truly is them, even though it may disagree with the way that i would think.  

if I could tell them, I would like them to know that it isn't that i was trying to have them be someone they are not, it's just that i wanted them to be all that they could...that's all.  Jesus, I am sorry if I was asking too much. 

often poeple get comfortable some where in life and jump out of that zone for one reason or another, whether it's you changing our life or something, but then they'll just revert back to what felt best...not all the way back, because Lord you know that they feel an accomplishment in finding you in their life, just it's sort of ""I can have the fun I had, and celebrate with you"", which yes, they can do that. But is that living fully? When you know the truth the complete truth...but settle for less because it's okay, what do you make of that?

i would never ask someone to be untrue to themself, but then again i would ask someone to seek and become all that you want them to be, all that you created them to be.  

It seems that sometimes someone thinks ""hey i'm doing just fine, at least i'm not like so and so or doing such and such..."" but that's not the point!  They are missing it.  First one can't compare...the only person we should compare ourselves to is Christ...and strive every day to be more like Him.  We can always become better, we can always embrace more, and life is always a journey.  It has been said that life is a challenge and i think that, well, it's true....but that challenge is still a choice.  We can choose to accept the challenge or not to accept.  True friends will always challenge us...that's one thing i 've learned...and they will challenge us just enough so that we can grow, for there is constant growing...they will urge and encourage us along the way.  They won't walk in front of us, they won't walk behind us, they will simple walk with us....side by side.
   
Sometimes I just think I'm kidding myself...with the idea that someone out there could actually want to grow in that way...and I guess I don't just meant anyone, I mean a special someone. Why? because it's so much easier not to choose that path..and it's a daily consious decision too.  I just pray, and wish that they could and would.  Maybe before I wanted them to do it for me, but now, oh, God, now I only want it for themself...because it hurts me inside when I have seen the best parts of them...for the best parts of someone are not exactly always intimate (the way that we think of intimate), because the best parts are a passion and love so real...in a spiritual sense...something one can't ever grasp physically.

I know it's silly for me to wonder about such things, but God do you have someone for me?  I know the answer to that lies in the future...and I know that I am young...""I have much time"" they say.  This I know, but God you know how devoted I am...you know that I would lavish my love on anyone who would open their arms to it...it would be so nice to just meet the person that would not only be open to my love, but give what they could in return.  This way, I would know that my efforts are not in vain, I wouldn't have to worry, ""what does he think""...or ""I hope he still likes me"", or even wake up one day and learn that what I thought was there is no longer.  Lord, I know that with each situation, with each event, that tugs on my heart...that I am allowing myself to give into a relationship and when I leave, hopefully take what I've been blessed with, take the beautiful memories, and learn how to become more full of love.  I know that through experiences, I can do one of two things. I can either, be resentful, and feel more vulnerable, in which I would not open myself up to love like that again or I could take it for what it was and look at it for what it is, pick up the pieces, and give them to you... and change myself.  For that is the only person that I can really change.  In changing myself to undesterstand and know that if you have said ""no, not right now"" to me...it is because an ever greater ""yes"" resides somewhere...even if that means that I may not know where it lies.  

Yeah, it would be nice to know exactly what our futures would be..it would be nice to have it all planned out for us, happily...forever.  Yet, in some ways it is...but the adventure is in this journey...this discovery, this search in every moment...that is what shapes and molds us.  We can choose to have a heart and mind like Him in every thing we do so that the Master's plan, becomes a reality...an eternal bliss, living the life God had wanted for us.  I tell you, that's the ""happily ever after"".  

Jesus, take my hand...take my heart.  Let me give it away with each word, and action.  May some day your plan be revealed to me.  Until them I wait...my prince will come. You promised.  Your word is always true.  I shall not doubt...but I do wonder...for i know that one day, He shall come. Amen."

I have been thinking and praying a lot about college.  And it just so happened that a lot of people I have been talking to either got to or will be attending Benedictine College.  I have heard that it's just like a Steubenville only in a different area and not as secluded.  I really liked the campus and it's small, but not too small.  They have a youth ministry major!!!! Can you believe it! Well, i know you knew, but still!!!  And they have a great volleyball team and very very very active campus ministry.  So many awesome life teens go there and they've actually started XLT's there! That's what Mike was telling me about...I'd love to sing with their band...a lot of them are from Assupmtion.  Anyway, he was talking to me all about their great theology department etc.  I was hooked, but I don't want to get to too excited because one it is a little bit farther than I would have liked...and the money is an issue.  But we'll just have to see about that, because what is meant to be will happen..right? right.  Oh, and you suprised me again, because Joe came up to school and had lunch with me the other day and I didn't even have a clue where he was going and I found out that he's going to Benedictine!!!!... and get this Pete is transferring there!! Oh, wow..I can't even imagine being able to run retreats and be involved in starting all those types of things.  I would be so happy because I could double major...with youth ministry I'd do secondary education in the field of religious studies....and then I'm also interested in music marketing, speech communications, international studies, and philosophy.  How wonderful is all that! Plus, the monks that founded the school have really instilled their values everywhere and it reminds me of Cor Jesu.  

Jesus, I lift all of this into your hands.  My life is yours, where ever I can serve you I shall go.  I know it will all work out.  Right now Benedictine is looking so awesome...but time will tell where I am supposed to be.  Thank you God!  I love you and i will sing your praises forever and ever!Amen"

"event","Oh, Jesus,
Last night I could not stop praying that your holy spirit would come and fill me.  As my candidate Andrea, receive such beautiful gifts from your hand, I prayed that some would come into my heart as well.  I asked that you would let the meditation song, that I would soon be singing be from your mouth and not mine...that your voice could be heard by all.  Because you are that one that brings love to life!  You are the one whose love is enough!  Through song, your most Holy Ghost would descend upon all.  I prayed that everyone gathered in the Church could somehow be touched, and that the words would become more than just lyrics on a paper...but that they would become each person's most sincere prayer to you.  One in which they would lift up their hearts to you, letting you come inside to consume them...so that they could have the strength and perseverence to live it.  

Oh, Lord, Jesus we all have a desire and passion to know you...  

In this world their are times when we think, ""there must be more than this""...more than this life here on earth, more than the satisfaction of being comfortable in our daily lives...more than living for ourselves...because living that way accomplishes nothing...  

I have friends...I know beautiful people who have you on thier mind...and have even let you into their hearts...but they have let you penetrate no deeper... Because to go deeper is not what they need right now...they figure, ""that's all I need is one more thing...I've got enough on my plate as it is..."".  These precious friends decide that when everything is chaotic....when things are out of their control...they need to taste of the cup of the world.  

How can they not see that all the drugs....the abuse...the drinking...the sex...it gives us nothing!!!! ...what they are looking for can not be found because they are not looking in the right places!!!  They need to look inside of themselves!!!!!  Really look inside and look at who they are!!!...there, they WILL find YOU!   Sometimes , I know, Lord, it is a difficult thing,...it takes much will power...and even pain in the process, because one must get over the past and move on...but only they can be the ones to make themselves realize this.  They need to fully accept that your grace covers all! They are worthy of you!  They do deserve every blessing and every wonderful gift that you are able to give, to be in their life. I tell you, let them know that nothing...NOTHING could be more worth it.  

All the parties, and all the stupidity (that can leave people hurt), all the rejection of chastity or self control will only leave us all the more hungry, all the more craving something else....along the way we loose ourselves....we loose our grasp on everything that surrounds us.  We leave more empty than we came....that's what the things of the world can offer.  

Sure they can disguise themselves, and that's the hard part, we may convince ourselves that ""oh, it's not that bad""....or ""well at least I'm not doing this""...or ""what could it hurt this time""....or we can even get ourselves to believe that this is what's best and this is what we need.  

We could not live a bigger lie.  

We could not live a more false or pretenitous life.  Who are we trying to fool? Certainly not God...  How can we reject all that God holds out to us, when it is exactly what we need?  When He knows the deepest parts of our heart, and when He understands what we really are longing for in our lives...how can we look another way and still think that our way is his?  How can we actually let the whispers of Satan tell us not to trust in His plan?  Do you not know that if you have asked...if you have prayed to God that he will answer!  He said he would...is that not enough?  If the answer we feel has not come...how can we not believe that it is this way beause He holds something else for us...something that maybe we just couldn't imagine? How we not believe that with ever ""no"" we await a greater ""YES""!

My dear friends...please do not be deceived!  I love you with all my heart!  Let not these things trouble or burden your hearts!  Jesus is the answer you are looking for.  Jesus will make you new...and be the one to bring you through.  Know that there is NOTHING, nothing that you and He can not handle together.  

Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Resound in their minds, Oh, Jesus, and let your word be written on their hearts....never to leave them.  So that they will know they are never alone...ever.  You, you are there.  And what you offer to them, your promises, your teachings, the people whom you use, are real and true.  All these are theirs...if only they just reach out, call on you....really call on you..and open their hearts...fully open their hearts to what you want to be done in them.  

If they truly allow themselves to let go of the world...as good or bad it can seem....if they forget themselves for you...Let them know that only then they WILL be found.  For it says so in the bible...you even told us, warned us, encouraged us....yet we still turn another way.  

How can we reject your love, O God?  How much longer can we crawl this earth dying inside, because we can not understand, or we misunderstand, or we misuse our bodiesm, or how much longer must we walk blinded, avioding the truth...not letting ourselves discover the life in you.  How much longer can we allow to walk away from the light, when the light is what we want!  We are such hypocites...we can not survive all.  Well, we can walk around, and breath, and eat....but not actually living.  We can not let ourselves get lost by temptation or 'tests'...they will lead us nowhere.  We need you Jesus!  We need your love!  We need you to come down and rescue us!  Tell them I love them...I am their friend...I only want for them what you want to give to them...that's all.  I am so sorry that at times, that is not enough.  I am sorry that the message I bring to them is not always communicated effectively....I am so sorry that sometimes I can not bring them into communion with you.  Take hold of them Jesus...and don't let them go.  Whether they know it or not, you live within...and you will not die.  You live on!  We must let the spririt of God to fall in this place, and let You have your way with us.  Come like a rushing wind God...clothe us with power from on high...set us FREE...leave us abandoned to your praise!  Lord, let your Glory fall!!! Lord, let your glory fall!!!!  Consuming fire...fan into flame....a passion for your name...we long to have...we wait for you.  Come!  Come, Lord Jesus! Amen."

"event","Lord, Jesus,
You are the One who brings every joy and happiness into my heart.  But I am still struggling, Kind and Gentle Jesus.  One thing that bothers me is that I have swallowed my emotions because...one, I don't want to be like every other girl who is just upset because things didn't work out...I am much more than that, it's just that I do not understand.  I am so lost. I do not get how someone...anyone for that matter, can really like someone, and then all of the sudden see that person in a different way.  In my situation, we shared so much...and he would say such sweet, sincere things to me (I can remember them perfectly)...and then over a little time, finally say, ""I'm sorry but I don't really feel you in that way""...even further more say that it felt wrong or something.  I am not asking him to be unfair to himself or anything...because I respect that he didn't love me like that anymore or maybe never did...but I just felt kinda led on.  Why would he spend so much time with me?...and hold me in the way that he did if he couldn't even see me as his girlfriend?.  I just think that was the hardest to comprehend. Why would he even write, ""yes, I do love you"" (obviously not meaning it in a b/f g/f way)...but then say something pretty hurtful like, ""yes, I'm glad I stopped seeing you in that way...a girlfriend way""...okay, so he just wants to be my friend...yet, if I mention something like my cousin Mark wanting to hook me up with his roommate, he sees it as me trying to make him jealous...and he says it hurts because he doesn't enjoy hearing about my next ""hook up"".  I don't understand!  What does it really matter to him?!  He doesn't love me like that anyway, and if someone else could...why could he not just be happy for me?.  If he so wants to be friends, which I do too, can I not talk about a possible someone for me?.  Even more hypocritical is the fact that I can't say anything, yet, I have heard all about his ex-girlfriend, his best friend (whom had or has liked him)...found out that he ""might be falling for his best friend again""...or ""falling for Mary"".  If I can handle those things in our friendship...and understand the need to talk about them, or even feel them...if I can lend a listening ear and offer my understanding (even when we were going out)...how can he not be there for me in the same way?.  How can one ask of another that which he himself is not demonstrating?  I know that I shouldn't change because of it, or become hurt or hardened...but it bothers me, God.  I am expected to be this way or that all the time, and when I fail to be my best self...I get dumped on.  I'm not saying that I shouldn't be held to that standard, because I do strive to live as your servant...but why is it that when I stumble or even fall...that people are not there for me in the same way that I would have been for them?.  Frienships are too way, and how can they assume that I will give my all (which I will try to do, because I can not allow myself to give an less..)...but then I feel that it is taken advantage of.  I can put my love and my heart out there all the time, and even when I get hurt I try to move and and accept things as they come...but that doesn't mean that I can be exactly the same way as I was before...for with events they shape and change us.  Not that I will not be myself anymore,for I will be but it just won't and can't be the exact same.  For in it before there where different elements, so therefore the same product of a friendship can not be produced.  That doesn't mean that it can not ever be as beautiful!...it just will be in a different way...not always for the worse either, it could be for the better too...  

Jesus, please help me.  I am utterly confused, and I have responded in ways that you would have never responded...because I let the hurt in...I felt the rejection (not just from one from but from others too)...and I felt lonliness....and now at last I feel confusion.  I am calling down an angel to raise me up so I can stand on mountains, to raise me up to walk on stormy seas. Because I am strong when I am on your shoulders, you raise me up to more than I can be.  

Oh, God I am so sorry to let this all out to you.  I feel like the most horrible person ever.  I am so selfish...I am being so me me me right now.  But I don't know what else to do, I normally just sweep whatever hurts me, whatever confuses me, whatever I do not understand about another, right away.  Giving it immediately up to you...this I have prayed about and I have given it to you, but I still feel it because I have to daily deal with it...and because normally that person is removed from my life, and I do not have to constantly be reminded...which again I know I need to just get over it and I will...but I don't like things being unsettled, and I feel that I really owe it to myself to figure out what went wrong? and if it wasn't me, Oh, God what was it?  because something happened, there is some process of thought that I am missing, and I just want to know what.  I don't care if it would hurt me more, because nothing could hurt me more than not knowing the complete truth.  

Jesus, you know very well that I love love.  You know that when I love someone, I really love them.....so I feel that I deserve to know what is going on.  I understand that there also may not be an answer...that maybe he has no idea, but I just want to have the courage to talk about it with him.  I want to be able to say what I feel and how I've felt, to the extent that I've felt it...and not hold anything back for fear that it would not please you.  I hold back because yes, I don't want to be negative...but also because I hate talking about people, nothing bothers me more than gossip....I hate not being true to others...but I also hate not being true to myself.  Sometimes I truly dislike the fact that I can not allow myself to express the words I want to say because I don't want them to hurt someone....even when I am really really hurting inside.  I can never bring myself to do it...I know that lately I have said some things that I shouldn't...I've been sarcastic...  Father frogive me, I am nothing worthy of you.  Forgive me.

I try to think why I do it; why the sarcastic words?...and then I know...for that is just the way that I can distance myself...because I want to be there for him, but I can't just put my heart all the way out there to him right away again.  I can do it for others, but when I'm confused, and not undestanding I can not bring myself to do it.  I protect myself in that way.  I will eventually, but right now it is so difficult to do when everything lies in question to me.  

Lord, let me know that I should just put my heart out there anyway, because that's what I want to do...but I feel that others are playing games with my heart...""I like you a lot""...""You know I love you...different than everyone else..."" and then, ""Well, you know it came so fast anyway...you couldn't have really thought..."" along with ""I would have said horrible horrible things..."" furthermore, ""I appologize...I'm sorry it didn't work out"" but with, ""consequently you should know that yes I do love you""...""I have a strong affection for you, and probably will for a long time to come"", here comes that other one again, ""yes, I'm glad I stopped...a girlfriend type of way""...ending with ""I love you Sarah and there isn't a thing on this earth that could possibly change that.""  So you can see why I'm thoroughly confused, God.  He once asked me ""who are you Sarah R---?""...I'd like to ask that very question...because I know who I think he is throught Christ...he is wonderful kind loving and caring...and Jesus, you know you blessed him with a great smile....but all that means nothing unless he find it and discovers it...so ""who are you Nick S---------?""...because I don't appreciate the accusations...and no, I don't get satisfaction by throwing them.  I am just trying to be your friend, be whatever is is to you that God wants me to be...because I do love you...but right now, it's tough when being here leaves me alone and not quite knowing what's going on.  

So, Lord, I can not control what others do or say.  But I can control what I do or say...  I only want to love. Love. Love. Love.  Jesus, please bring love to me once again...let me love as I always have....I know that I will love as if I've never been hurt...but with that love can change.  So let him understand that....of all people he should understand that, for he did that to me.  So please let him understand, that while he feels on the defense, so do I.  While he feels I haven't been myself, I feel that neither has he.  While he feels that I'm not being fair and hurtful, and not enabling our friendship to grow, I feel that he is doing the same thing.  In all truth, that doesn't make any of my action more valid, but it takes two...and I think we both need your love and grace right now.  I think I need to look at myself and shape up...and I think he needs to look at himself and shape up.  I think we both need to become the best we can to each other for each other.  I need your blessings and angles in order to do this...he does too.  So God, please come!  Come into my heart and take over!  Reclaim the darkest partest, where I have let that which I am not, take over...and bring life into my eyes as no one has ever seen.  Let me become selfless, for I have been horribly selfish....help me to be patient once more, because my want for love now takes over my emotions,...help my words be gentle and kind, because they once were and now they've become sarcastic and even hurtful (even though some of them I never ever intended them to be so...they just either slipped out wrong, or they were completely misinterrpreted..like the chivalry comment, he just took too far, I was just referring to the burping and releasing of gas, because he's never done that so much and it really is rather rude..I mean it was all fun and games and then enough was enough...I never meant to allude to the way that he treats people and that he love life is off or that he does not how to treat a girl right...so then when he got mad it took me by surprise and flat out made me want to cry...because first of all he never said anything aloud about us going out in front of anyone at youth group before and the first time that he says something, it just has to be negative...in your face remark.  I felt so embarrassed, because already some people there had never wanted us together to begin with, so they care not about how it makes me feel.)...I also have one more thing to say about post church sunday...and then when he started talking all about those girly prince type movies, and how they are stupid, and how he sets his own standards....well, I'm sorry because I love those movies...and he knew that.  I like them because not that I want that exact thing to happen to me...but that it gives me hope that love out there can exist...and that men are not always jerks or insensitve...I did not appreciate him dissing on them...especially because he knew I wanted to see the Prince and Me really badly)...phew, Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry...I just had to let tell you.  Now, I give that memory to you, Lord.  It it yours please take it, and replace it with something wonderful.

Glorious One, please bless and be with Nick...because I do want to move on...and I want to be a close friend of his.  I know that he wants you in his life and is trying to live the life that you have for him.  If it is in your will, I want to be here for him and with him on his journey...friends in your name and blessed by your grace.  

I know now, that through this awefully long prayer, I was able to vent to you...Nick had said I needed to vent...he was right.  I feel much better...only because of you.  All because of the power and light that come from you and floods into my soul!

  Again forgive me, Sweet and Beautiful Savior.  

Nick had once said that he honestly could not believe that some of the things I said came out of my mouth.  Oh, God...I am so sorry...it brings me to my knees and in tears.  I could never feel worse about saying whatever I said...I don't care if at the time I felt that they were justified...I do not like to hurt people...let alone someone I love and cherish...I don't care if I felt hurt, and felt that I was defending myself...as far as I am concerned, I think that's an excuse...for no one ever has the right to hurt another...no matter how they feel.  Oh, God, I am only human...snd oh, how I wish I wasn't.  Apparently by nature, mistakes tend to be what I'm good at...  

But you Jesus, you take me as I am.  I have nothing to give you...yet you kiss my empty hands.  

You still love me!  How could you?...how? It is in times like these that there is only one set of footprints in the sand...I feel you carrying me...even when I don't deserve it.  You come because I call...and you wrap me up in your tender comforting ever-sure and endless love.  Thank you, Jesus.  Thank for listening..Lord, I await your reply.   

Jesus, I want only to be Yours...be all that I think and be all that I am.   

Oh, God there is so much more I need to pray about...I will finish later.  Please, send your spirit into me...and let your glory shine through me.  Let your songs enable my soul to dance.  My wing feels broken...it's all my fault.  Please, mend it Jesus...come down and hold my hand even if for just a little while.  I need you...I want to be all that I can.  I want to be love.  I want to find love...someday.  

Lover of my soul and giver of my heart, I wait for you...you will come and You always come.  Jesus, you are wonderful...everything about you...I hope that others can say the same about me (because then I pray that they'd only see You.) Amen."

"event","God,
Why is it that people change?  or rather Why is it that I can share so much of who you are with another...and feel you so close in him and then next minute, that same person will hurt me...  

I'm not sure if he knows it, but he has hurt me...(not by breaking up with me...I mean I know that hurt too, but that just wasn't your plan for me or him then...just the way it happened I was sorry...further than that though, I feel that he isn't comfortable around me or something.  I don't know, the next day when we were watching mulan he seemed fine...kind and gentle, loving...and then it was as if a rubber band snapped, and then he doesn't look at me the same...I feel that he can't stand me, and I didn't know that I did anything...  Just the other day, I felt like crying...I just wanted to get up and leave and spare myself the embarrassment, and him the wasted energy.) 

Lord, I can read him really well...I know that even other than the words he speaks, that he feels angry or mad at me. Oh, Jesus, I am trying to be myself in the midst of this confusion...one minute loving, and the next he is going off at me...  I am so sorry Lord, but I am crying inside.  I understand that we are not together any more, but does that mean that the person I knew then disappears now?  Where did the light go that used to be in his eyes? He says he is happy, or was until he saw me that day...or spoke with me...or whatever it was...  

Jesus, I know not what to say?  He needs to get through this alone with you...and I want to be there too, but I feel shoved to the side.  Why does the person whom I care about seem to be on the edge with me? what have I done Jesus?  I beg you for forgiveness if I am being blind to my own actions, but I feel that I haven't done anything terribly offensive...please forgive me...  I never ever ever want him to feel badly...why does he lash out at me? Does he know what he says hurts?  hurts a lot?  if so then why does he proceed?  Oh, God, please bless him.  Please, forgive him...help me forgive him. I know he must not know what he was saying.  He couldn't of...he is much better than that.  I know the Nick I knew is still there...but why won't he show himself in that way any more?  I understand that he feels ""tested""...but he is stronger than that.  He can hold on.  In times like this give him the courage to know that it is not You who is testing him...people can be so cold or cruel, and you do not control what they do with their free will.  

I think that maybe he feels that I haven't been myself lately...but I have merely been tired...emotionally exhausted because I want him to find what he is looking for.  Maybe my role is to just leave...if I cause him to say or even think ""horrible"" things...then I shall give him the peace and rid him of it.  I pray for him each morning Jesus, can you hear me?  I know you do.  I know you do.  I'm not sure why he is checking...he knows...the answers are all in your time and other times they are right there under our noses, but we fail to see them.  We must look with our hearts!  Help me Jesus, I need your love.  I feel cast aside.  People did that to you...please give me the love that you had...hold me.  As the tears fall, please wipe them away God. I know that as a servant of Yours you will turn my every trial, every shadow...into an opportunity to lift me up...if I only ask...and then when I ask, help me feel the presence of your angel wings.  Because they will be there...even though I may not know it yet.  Take me as I am Lord...and make me into some one who can shine your beauty!  

If he can no longer see your love in me...where has it gone? why can't he see you where you still reside?  

Oh Divine Savior...I feel hurt not because we talked or ""went out"" or whatever silly reason may seem obvious...but because I love him...love him with the real love that you have given me.  I love him the way I love you.  The way I love Karl.  The way I love Bridget.  I feel this intense inner struggle going on and I also feel that what he is looking for lies deep within...  

Another reason I feel so hurt is because anytime that a friendship I have is built upon Your grace and mercy...I feel that it goes beyond out earthly notions of friendship...therefore, when it is good, beauty fills up my soul...and when it feels not so good,...when it feels hurtful, I feel a little hole in my heart.  This is because...it's like a special connection through you.  When one person is unsure or confused....I feel that as well.  I can go on and live my life.  I'm not saying that I can not truly live, because Lord you know that You give me strength to do that...but I feel a part of me there with him trying to search and discover Your plan for him.  God all things are in your hands.  

Rescue me Jesus...and love me with your fulfilling, completing love that is so amazing! 

""I've been looking for a reason.  I've been longing for a purpose.  I'm losing all my meaning.  I've run out of excuses.  Lord, it's hard to know you, when I don't always seen your plan, but holiness is calling me, so take me as I am.  

You are my everything.  You are the song I sing, I'll do anything for you.  Teach me what to say, to live a life of grace, I'll go anywhere with you.  Jesus be my everything. 

Lord, I get so tired of the struggle within.  I settle in complacency and I'm weighed down by my sin.  So lead me past emotion, 'cause they change with the wind; I want to be a TRUE DISCIPLE, to daily choose your hand.""  
Amen.

I love you.  God, please let him feel you.  Let him see his angel, that he wants so badly.  Let him find the one you have chosen for him.  Bring him peace...bring him light...bring him love again."

"event","Lord, Jesus,
I just wrote you everything...and exausted myself.  This wonderful computer erased it all when it froze...please hear my prayer still.  

The most important part was this:

I only have one wing sweet Jesus...and I want so badly to fly.  I took a flight for a little while, and it was a blessing.  In which I know that blessings like that come and go.  We get lifted up...and come back down again.  But it is always worth it, always. Especially since during that time, I feel your beautiful love surround me, in a way like never before.  

Now, Jesus please take my hand, and hold me.  Fill me with Your love...I need your love right now.  I try to give and give and give without receiving, so that at night I can go to bed knowing that I gave it all...knowing that I loved as You loved. But Lord,  I fear that my love (the love we share) is sometimes misunderstood.  

Jesus, I love to give as You gave...but please, Lord, some day...from the one who wants to love me...if it is in your will...let me receive the love from him (whomever he is, where ever he may be).  Let me receive the love from him that comes from You.  And be with him Jesus.  Let him know that I wait for his love and long to truly know him.  

I know your love is enough for me, but sometimes I feel so alone.  Let the love I give be enough for another.  Some day, oh, some day, Jesus, let the one who loves me, find me...recognize me...soar with me.  

I want to hear the angels sing, and praise you from on high.  Shine within me Jesus...let me become, the one You created me to be.  

I serve you, Christ.  I want to be a special angel of Yours...a messenger of Your love to whom ever You send me to. You bring beauty to my life, and light to my soul...on even the cloudiest days.  I love you.  

rain down your love upon me...bless those I hold dear...and help me understand.  Amen.

(that wasn't quite what I said before...but God, you know me...search my heart once more...)"

First off let me say, if it weren't for Mark and my friends, I probably would have moped around he apartment all summer and been bored out of my mind...

First is the BBV-BBQ we had at Jess' house... it was a lot of fun... and even though I was a little weird and not as exciting as the last BBQ, I had fun... I just wasn't sure what to expect of Mark and Gary being in the same place, but it went well, and I had fun. Mark, Gary, and I went swimming *we were drunk* haha and I didn't hit my face on the bottom of the pool this time, yay! They taught Dave how to play beer pong, haha wow =P we took a before pic *sober* and an after pic *drunk*... and lemme tell you, the pics are quite different =P

So I also went camping with Mark, we ended up going nuts though, Cheesequake was booked, so, we had to find a last minute camp site... while I was at work, Mark was calling places, and finally we got one.
It wasn't that bad, it had to be for trailer's and RV's though, because that's basically what was at this place... a few tent sites, but mostly RV's... we made the best of it though, I would never go there again because it was just not my kind of place... you had to buy firewood or bring your own, and the camp site was more than cheesequake and so not worth it... and also, there was no lake to swim in, a pool... there was boating in the lake, and that was fun... also, the camp sites were really close... but we made the best of it, and we had a lot of fun.

The following weekend, we saw Kelly Clarkson in Toms River... it was great, I'd never been to a concert *unless you consider Ludacris to be a concert... haha as if* and even though we got stuck in the back of the crowd, it was amazing... and I had a lot of fun with Jess, Mark, and Jess being there, Jess and I were singing along to Kelly... and I was jumping around like a fool to her music, it was great =)

So this weekend, I work, everyday... but Mark and I have some plans... we're gonna work on the dollhouse *which by the way, is coming out beautifully* and maybe go swimming at his brothers... and watch some movies, I've decided to add some new/different movies... so far I've added Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, Bring It On, and Better Off Dead... hehe, gotta love those 80's classics =) soon enough I'll have The Ring 2, Amityville Horror, and 2 more Amityville sequels coming out on DVD =)

So in a few weekends, Jess, Mark, Mike, Jess, and I will be going on a camping trip, and I'm really excited,.... I think everyone will have a lot of fun, even if Jess and I have to work that Friday night and the Sunday night when we leave... but I think it'll be a lot of fun, I've always wanted to do a group thing like that, and I'm totally looking forward to it... =)

Well, I must get to bed... it's almost 4am and I have to be up at 7 to pick up the bitch and drive him around =P so off I go to dream land"

"event","Dunno what's up with me tonight, I usually have no problem falling asleep... and yeah, I usually go to sleep at like 4am... tonight I had to try to go to bed earlier than usual, because I have to pick up Mark tomorrow and bring him to a few places, and we have to pick out a camp site before I go to work at 5.

For whatever reason, while I was laying down, I started thinking of my mom... and just all of the fucked up things she's done the past year or so...

And yeah, things ended up good... I have responsabilities... I pay my bills, I pay my rent... I have a place to call my own, I finally have my license... I'm working on getting my car on the road... but it still bothers me...

I'll never forget what happened at Christmas... and that she never got me shit... that she never even mentioned it. I'll never forget how I felt the day I went there before work, and I saw Pete's kids opening gifts and shit, and there I was, the outcast... that's what I am now to her, an outcast.

I feel like she doesn't appreciate me the way she did years ago... and after all the hell she put me through as a teenager... all the moving, then all the shit with Pete because he thought he could just take over... and like I said, yeah I'm happier now and things are better as far as me being on my own, but at the same time... I feel like he won... he got what he wanted, he got me out of the house... 

And yeah, things might be better off that way, but at the same time... I was put on the spot, I was literally given a last minute decision to either live with my brother in this apartment or find my own place, and god thank my brother, because if it wasn't for him, I dunno where the fuck I would be right now... because god knows, I would not be living with my mom and her perfect boyfriend.

Sometimes I lay down, and Ithink about things that happened... all the fucked up things she put me through... like the time our electric got shut off because she didn't pay the bill, and it was my fault according to her... then I had to ask my boss for a loan and pay half of it back... why was it my fault or responsability to begin with?

And like before I worked at Blockbuster... all of the dvd's she made me sell so she could go out and ""party"" while I was home alone with nothing to eat, I'll never forget one night I was crying hysterically because James and I had broken up recently, I called 3 different bars before I even found her, and all she could say basically was ""well I'm not coming home, so deal with it""

What kind of a mother does that? What kind of a PERSON does that?

Then Christmas, where I stopped there before work... and I hand her the gift that mark and I picked out for her and Pete... seeing Brian and Kimmy with their gifts around them... I didn't even get a god damn card... I didn't even get acknowledgement that she didn't get me shit... until a few weeks later when she ""felt bad because she didn't get us anything"" and that ""she would make up for it""

Funny because, my 21st birthday passed on the 17th... and you know what, I didn't get shit from her for that either... she called me at work the day after ""Oh when are you working"" ""All week at night""  ""Ok I'll stop in tomorrow""
Did she? No.. she didn't... 3 days later, I come home to find she stopped here and just left the card here... she couldn't even come see me for my birthday... I haven't seen her since now that I think of it.

I got my license the day after my birthday, which, god bless, is one of the most greatest things I could accomplish... and everyone knows this, because, it wasn't easy... I know everyone said ""It's easy, I passed the first/second time""
Yeah but... I went like 6 times... and the first few times I never even drove, and god bless mark for lettign me drive, because if he hadn't, I probably wouldn't have my license...
But everyone congratulated me... as a matter of fact, I told my brother and it just seemed everyone found out from that... my grandma called me right away as well as my aunts... my mom didn't call me until 3 days after... so wtf?

I just wish things weren't good because I had to go through hell... I don't feel I deserved anything I went through living with my mom... and yeah, parents suck... and whatever, but this is something totally different... I feel like she's completely just disowned me or forgotten about me... or even cared.

I used to be real close to my mom too... up until I was about 15 or 16 it changed... she became selfish, everything was always everyone else's fault and never hers... and anything bad that happened, I always had to be involved... anytime we lost a place, I was the one who was told ""Ok we have to move again""... or ""Ok we're moving 2 hours from your school, because I need a cheap place to move into""

And you know, after all of the shit I've been through, with her and with everything else as a teenager... I'm surprised I'm not a fuck up... I'm surprised I'm not a drug addict or an alcoholic... or out there causing trouble...

I'm proud of myself... I'm proud I'm 21 years old, and I can say I have my own place and I take care of myself... and that I don't have to deal with the shit I did... but at the same time, it still bothers me... it still makes me upset...

And you know what bothers me a lot too? I'm a door mat... a push over... I let people walk on me...  I wish I could have just been an asshole and opened my mouth about all of this stuff when it happened... maybe it wouldn't haunt me so much... but I can't do much about it now, can I?

I dunno... even though a lot of shit has happened, I'm proud of myself and my life... I'm happy I have real friends who care about me... and a best friend to top it off...  and yes, Mark... he's a bitch sometimes, but he helps me a lot, and I really can't imagine him not being around either, I know some people think I'm crazy for saying that but it's true. 

I'm happy I know I can do things on my own with a little help from my friends... because god bless them, I would not be where I am if it weren't for them, because they make me who I am"

"event","So the past few weekends I've been actually doing stuff, instead of just sitting around in my room watching movies... Mark and I have been up to some stuff...

Jess had a beer-b-q at her house a few Fridays ago, so we went to that, it was a blast, I can't wait to do it again =) I had a lot of fun with her, and Mark... and just about everyone else who was there, but the 3 of us were the life of the party, while everyone was sitting down talking and stuff, we were being drunken fools and dancing.

We went to Englishtown a couple of times, I was in search of an 8mm projector, which I found, but the one I bought doesn't have sound, so, I have to find another one. Mark asl obought me one of those antique fans, I've always liked them for some reason, so we boguht this one for like 5 bucks... it was all dirty and old looking, so we took it home, cleaned it, painted it up, and put some oil in it... almost looks brand new, I've been using it too.

I also bought one of those crossbow guns, which I use every now and then when I'm just sitting here... I bought a target bag for it as well, so I usually shoot that when I'm not aiming for customers at my job =)

We've been having quite a rough time lately... i let out a lot of how I feel, and now it's all layed out... so right now it's just kind of like a ""see where it goes, go with the flow"" kind of thing, our one year passed last weekend... which originally we weren't going to spend togther, but we ended up doing that anyway. I mean we've been ok lately, we went to his brothers last weekend a couple times to go swimming, which was alot of fun, we're actually going there tonight to do the same and watch Hide and Seek with them.

Tomorrow I work 5-9, so taht shouldn't be much fun... blah blah blah, oh well... maybe it won't be all that busy... it's a Saturday night in the summer, so most people will be out doing stuff probably...

Speaking of work, they've switched my schedule around, now it seems I'll be working all nights... past and next schedule are 5-11, mon-thu + Sat, so I have another fun filled week workin at BBV next week... oh friggin joy lol at least I'm workin with Jess 3 of those nights, so taht'll be fun... we always have fun.

So this weekend should be a little productive... we're gonna go swimming at his brothers when he gets here, then the movie... tomorrow I have work, so we're probably gonna stop at A.C. Moore to get some dollhouse stuff, then work, then we wanna go see High Tension and mayeb bowling... Sunday is a little undecided... we might go see fireworks, work on the house, or go swimming... or maybe all 3... depends on what we decide I guess...

Well off to my weekend I go"

"event","I don't know anymore... why does this have to happen?

I love him,  with all my heart... I'm in love with him and I have some really strong feelings for him, I can't imagine him not being around... not letting me drive his car, not taking me out to eat or taking me on one of his many missions... but why is it that I decide things might not work out?

I'm not happy... not with myself, lately, I've been depressed and quite unhappy with myself... I don't know why, I used to think of myself as a good person, who had average looks... and lately, I feel like a peice of shit who's ugly and fat... it's not him, he compliments me all the time, but somehow, I manage to feel like this.

Part of me wants to fight for this relationship and make things work, another part of me wants to let go and see if I'll change... I don't want to hink it's because of him I feel this way, but then I think about all of the stuff he's put me through the first 3-4 months when we first started going out... the mind games and the times he would imply I was a whore... and the times he threatened to break up with me... then again, I don't know, because I feel I've gotten passed all that...

Why can't I just be normal? Why can't I ever just be happy with myself and what I've accomplished? I have my own place, I pay my own rent and bills, I have a steady job, and a boyfriend of a year... the ball seems to be rolling for me, yet... for whatever reason, I've just been increasingly getting worse with how I feel about myself... and it's not because someone makes me feel that way or because he makes me feel that way...

I know my friends appreciate me, and I know he does too...I just don't know what's wrong with me...

He points out these things, things I used to write about in my journal or things I used to do with my ex's and brings up the fact that I'm not like that anymore... that I used to write about Nano and James all the time in my journal, and that I don't always write about him... and he's right... and I don't know why... I don't know what happened to me, or what part of me got lost....

I used to be so different with relationships, I used to go all out... and yeah, I've really fought hard with this relationship with everything we've been through, but I used to do things I don't do anymore... and not because I don't want to, just because... it doesn't come up in my mind... what the fuck happened to me?

I used to write poems... and post whoever I loved all over my room... letting it be known that I love that person.... and now I'm just like... ""Ok I'm in a relationship, and I'm happy, yet content""

Why did I change? Sometimes I think it's because of the two major heartbreaks I had... James and Nano... James affected me to where I didn't hook up or have sex with anyone I liked or had feelings for... Nano and I were ""dating"" for like 4-5 months and we never had sex, I was really into him, and I was very attracted, but... the sexual feeling just was absent... and that's how it's been for anyone I've had feelings for since James...

And it's not like I ever said ""I'm never giving myself away to anyone I love"", or I ever put thought into doing that... but it's just how I turned out, and I don't know why... and I don't know what's wrong with me anymore.

I'm just not happy with myself when it comes to dating anymore... I feel... I dunno... I feel incomplete... like, whoever I'm with could find someone better... and Mark tells me that he had chances with other people when we started dating, and he chose me...

I don't know... I hope I can find what I'm looking for, because I don't know how much longer I can deal with feeling this way."

"event","Ahhh finally, going away... away from here, from everyone *well the people I WANT to get away from for a few days*

Before I get into that... life's been the same, Mark and I have been seeing a lot of each other, things seem to be getting better as well... We went to see Amityville Horror on opening night together... the following weekend, me, him, Jess, Jess, Mike B., Mike *my bro*, and Bobbie Jo went to see it ... it was fun, we recently just saw House of Wax *what a fucking GORY ASS MOVIE, I don't think I ever clenched my fists harder at the sight of someone being brutalized in a movie*

I've had a lot of fun with Jess lately though, we've been wrking together more than usual and hanging out outside of work, which I love... I have a lot of fun with her and am really looking forward to this summer with all the free time we'll have to do stuff =)

Work's been somewhat different, my hours are thrown all over most of the time, I've worked with Jess a bit more, which is great, because I love working with her, I have so much fun. I've been working 5, mostly 6 days a week... past few weekends, I've worked Sat nights, I was supposed to work this upcoming Saturday night but Jess, Cura, and Mark decided to re-arrange their schedules around for me since Mark had a secret plan up his sleeve.

I've been saying to him how we need to like... go away for a weekend, so that no one can bother us, and when I say no one, I mean *my brother or his fiance, his mom or craig*, because no matter where we go, or what we do... someone always interrupts our plans... so Mark decided to plan a nice weekend of camping, which should be lots of fun.

I remember last summer I wanted to go camping, but that idea got flushed and forgotten about, though I'm real excited about this, tomorrow we're going to get the food and whatever we need, I'll start packing everything... my meds and necessities. I plan on packingmy clothes before bed tonight, and mostly everything else is ready like my tent and axe and all that.

Too bad we didn't go camping last weekend... Friday the 13th and all, hehe, that would have been cool...

Though, I'm really really looking forward to this weekend coming up... I mean I love my apartment and I don't mind my job all that much, but I just need to get out somewhere for a few days away from everything to not think about any of the other shit that might be going on here.

Oh, I also re-arranged my room already... it's only been 3 months but I never really had the chance to do much with my old room, so, I'm taking advantage of it while I can, couldn't really move the computer anywhere but I moved pretty much everything else...

And the dollhouse is almost done, it's gettin there, not much more left to do really... so when I get my taxes *which I found out won't be until June 7th* I'll be buying whatever else we need to finish it.

Well that's all folks, until next time...."

"event","It's always me... I'm always the bad guy... apparently I'm always wrong... and that's how he makes me feel...

Everytime we argue, even about the littlest thing, it's always my fault and I'm the one who gets all the credit for it.

It makes me wonder a lot... if he makes me feel like I' mwrong *even when I'm not*, then what does he say to other people? his friends? how do I know what THEY think of me... and fine, maybe I shouldn't care, but at the same time, he's a part of my life, which means I'll be seeing his friends, so why should I feel I'm being projected as something I'm not?

I feel like things are one sided to a certain point... at least when it comes to this... I feel like, it's ok for him to do things, but when it's me... god forbid I do something, because then I'm the asshole. He never accepts my reasoning, its always ""you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong"" and I'm sure he'll disagree with that, but if he accepted my reasoning, we wouldn't continue to argue about something after I give my reason. But my reasoning doesn't matter... all that matters is that I was ""wrong"", I have so much bullshit on my shoulders right now, and this isn't helping one bit.

I understand that I haven't seen him all week pretty much, and thatwe haven't really been able to talk on the phone because I've been working a lot and our schedules have been colliding, but that's not my fault and he makes me feel like it is.

Why do I always have to feel guilty for things I shouldn't even feel guilty for? Why is it ok for HIM to do things but if I did the same thing, I'd be a horrible person? Why does he say he trusts me  yet he always questions what I do when he's not around? I don't understand... I feel he's insecure about our relationship, and he's taking it out on me... I never take my problems out on him, I do vent, I do talk to him and I do get loud when I'm aggrivated about something, but I DO NOT take it out on him and I feel he does that to me... what the hell did I do?

I feel like I'm inadequete for him... I feel like I'm not good enough... he always talks about these guys he met or dated, or hooked up with... and how hot they were or how nice they were... or how big their dick was, and it just makes me feel like... ok I'm nothing like those guys, so why are you with me? And then I think that, and 5 minutes after he brings something like that up, he expects me to be all lovey dovey... and I'm just not in the mood to be lovey dovey when my b/f just talked about some ""other guy""... and it hurts, and it bothers me, and I tell him how it makes me feel... and I feel it goes just one ear and out the other, because he still does it.

I love him with all my heart... I try to do my best to do whatever I can for him, I try so hard to be a good boyfriend... I know I don't have much... I know I don't make a shit load of money or drive, or have a wonderful job or a great dating record because of how many boyfriends I've had *and how many hurt me*, but sometimes I just feel what I do, and what I feel, and what I say... isn't enough for him to trust me or understand me... *sigh*

I just hung up on him before I wrote this, and... it hurt, it hurt a lot... but he was making me feel like such a piece of shit, he made me feel so bad for something that was so little... and I even explained myself, and it wasn't enough... he had to keep giving me an attitude and making me feel bad for something I shouldn't have felt bad for really... I don't know what to do anymore =( I feel really inadaquete right now, and really shitty... and just sad...

"event","So I haven't updated in this thing in god knows how long... I guess almost 3 months? Anyway, quite a bit has happened or has been going on...

Me, well... I'm happier... I'm on my own now, I live in a 2 b/r apartment with my bro Mikey and his fiance Bobbie Jo... we've been living here since mid January actually, I just haven't had time to update this thing with evetrything else going on. The apartment is really big, and nice... we're happy here, almost 3 months later and I'm still not used to the fact that I'm on my own now... but I'm happy.

Mark and I are still together, our 9 month anniversary just passed actually last Friday *the 25th*, though I worked Sat and Sun night *yes, I worked Easter* we spent whatever time we could together and enjoyed it as much as we could. We plan on spending the entire weekend coming up together as I have off Fri night, Sat, Sun, and Mon, we're actually planning on going to great adventure on Sunday and mayeb to my mom's to have dinner on Friday after I get off work. We still have our rough moments, but we've happy... and I'm glad I finally found someone who wants to be with me for a while and not just say it to humor me.

Work is... work, as always... Blockbuster never seems to change much, though we've had a few new employees *some we've had recent problems with and probably won't last much longer* Andrew no longer works there, but Jess remains best manager on the world ;)

So moving on to a linked subject, Jess and I have been communicating more, it was hard before I moved because her computer was on the fritz, then when I moved, I didn't have internet for at least a month and a half, and I never work with her really, so I'm glad for that. Me, her, and Mark went to see Ring Two the weekend it came out, I was glad since we had been talking about going to see it since I pretty much started working at BB. It was nice to hang out with her for a little while outside of work, and I'm definately looking forward to more this summer =)

I've been driving a lot which is good, Mark's been letting me drive, I plan on going for my license again this summer sometime, Jess said she'd take me, so I appreciate that a lot... I feel bad always asking her but I think maybe I'll do a lot better since I actually DROVE before taking the test lol.

So Mark and I have been doing little by little, work on our dollhouse, it's coming out really nice, I'm really liking it... we plan on working more on it this weekend since we have the entire weekend to relax and stuff.

So next up is the Amityville Horror re make, which comes out April 15th... I'm definately going to see that opening night, I'm already giving my request to have off that evening so I can go... I asked Jess to come as well, I hop she requests off... poor girl never requests off, she deserves to. Thankfully I get a free movie ticket in my Amityville Boxed Set, which I should be getting Thursday morning when I work, which I'm also looking forwrd to.

Things seem to be looking up lately and getting a lot better, and I'm glad for that... I feel after all I've been through, I deserve this... and while the bills are a little stressful to catch up on at first and I've been alone the past 2 weeks because my bro and his fiance are taking care of my grandmother, I'm happy. It's an experience I wanted to have for a while... it's tough, and it's hard, but I'm learning from it all... and it's everything I hoped it would be, maybe more."

"event","So a lot's happened, a few holidays' passed... work is work as always, I got a nice $60 bonus, I'm getting my review this Sunday, so I can get my big 50 cent raise lol... the new kid who I was training last week quit and foun another job, Chris who was working there for a couple months quit as well, and Judy gave her 2 weeks today becaus she found a nother job... Andrew hasn't been working as much, and Jess has been talking about quitting, and I may be doing the same within the next 4-6 months.

I went for my driving test AGAIN and failed for improper k-turn, which was automatic fail, which sucks... isn't a k-turn illegal ANYWAY? That's what I was told from numerous people, so Mark's gonna take me when he gets his car situation settled.

Christmas was... eh, it was good, I got to spend it with Mark... I worked both Xmas eve and Xmas day mornings, it wasn't that bad, I didn't enjoy being home for the time I was though, I just wanted to leave honestly. I gave everyone at work their gifts, and well, Mark his, he really liked them a lot, and I loved his as well. Jess got me a nice drinking glass that says ""Bottoms Up"" on it with a plush ""I'm Horny"" teddy bear in it, like my keychain.

My mom didn't get me anything... she didn't even mention not getting me anything... not even a card, I came here for a little while after work on xmas, which I didn't want to do. But I bit my tongue, and enjoyed spending my night with Mark afterwards. I really loved the gifts he got me, he got me a really nice pair of shoes, a pack of new socks and t shirts, which I needed, a new stereo, thank god, cuz my old one was not working for anything... and a really really beautiful dollhouse kit, we've gotten half of it done, it's all wallpapered, glued together... we have some electrical lights in it, all we need to do is paint it,do the foundation brick, put shingles on, finish up the lighting, and put furniture in it... and even though I have done some of it by myself, I've enjoyed doing most of it with him. =) He also got trust rings for us, which I thought was amazing and very cute... I wear it all the time, along with the gay pride necklace I bought in NYC with him =)

I stayed at his house the past weekend Friday - Weds afternoon... we did a lot, got a lot of cleaning stuff for the apartment I'm moving to... oh yes, the apartment...

The countdown is 9 days until I move, unfortunantly not how I planned... I haven't gotten my own place, I need my license, that's my starting point... once I get that, I can get this car fixed, registered, and insured... then when I do that, fine a beter payiong job, then save enough money for my own place... so until I get on that first step, which is my license, I'm going to move with my brother into a 2 bedroom, upstairs, very nice apartment... and I'm actually looking forward to it. Maybe not as much as moving out on my own, but moving out of this horrid shitty situation would make me happy either way.

Though I could not thank Mark enough, he's really kept my sanity this whole time... he's helped me a lot being there, and letting me stay at his house as much as he has, it's meant a lot to me... I enjoy spending the time I do with him, and I'm glad he's there for me =)

So good bye Pete, good bye Bryan, good bye to living how I don't want to live... being told what to do and when not to do things I should BE ABLE to do... 

So a new beginning for me, at least the start of one, I still have a lot to do, but this is a big step for me, and I'm looking forward to it in everyway =)"

My mom calls me at work last night while I'm in the middle of putting a poster up on the front of the store, so I pick up... and she starts telling me how porr little baby Bryan got sucked punched by a couple of kids while he was at some basketball game... Oh BOO FUCKING HOO, LIKE I CARE?! Then she tells me... he was there, and apparently someone told these kids he was talking shit about them, and he ""left to avoid trouble"" and they sucker punched him in the face. Apparently they split his gums... ohhhh let me cry a river now... then he came home and my mom asked him what was wrong, and he started crying... ohhh nooo I feeel SOOOO bad.

Three words: GIVE IT UP

Like I care? Seriously... like I give a shit? I wouldn't put it passed him to talk shit about someone... he did it to me, and he's a sneaky little shit, so what makes me think he wouldn't do it to someone else? Oh poor little angel Brian got hit in the face and everyone has to know and feel bad? After my mom told me I was like... ""Yeah... and...?"" cuz I couldn't really give a shit, as a matter of fact, I laughed, the little bastard deserved it.

I just want to be fucking recognized as a person... I'm sick of feeling like a god damn stranger in my own house...

Nice how I wasn't invited to help decorate the Christmas tree with my mom's new ""family"", made me feel really good and fuzzy inside... nice how they all went outside to see how it looked too... and how they're all singing along to Christmas songs and having such a great time downstairs... so nice, so cute... I'm so glad I live here and don't get to feel like I belong.

Feeling like I'm just some ""person"" who lives here... I don't even feel like a son lately to my mom, I feel like I have no purpose around here... why the FUCK AM I here anyway? I can't wait to just move out and be on my own, and not have to deal with this neglect or bullshit I get... I'm sick of Pete, I'm sick of his son... I'm sick of being told who to be and what to do in my own house, it's bullshit. Who the FUCK is he anyway? Ugh, I'm so sick of this place... I get shit on, walked on, and I'm supposed to give a shit about the people who make me feel the way I do? Well fuck him, fuck his son, and fuck this place... cuz when I'm out, I'm not coming back, they can all go live happily ever after in their shitty new house without me, cuz I'm sick of this bullshit anyway."

"event","So yeah, I didn't add this to my last entry because I think I have a new ""project"" coming up...

So this weekend, I was telling Mark how I wanted to visit the house where they filmed the first 3 Amityville movies, it's in South NJ - Toms River. I've had this web site for a while, which had the address and a somewhat current picture of the house that was used for filming.

So I showed him the site, and we decided to take a little trip the following day after getting directions off of Mapquest.

So after doing a few things, we left, unfortunantly by the time we left, it was already becoming dark, so I couldn't really video tape anything because it was wayyy too dark to see, I took a couple pictures, they're kind of dark, however, you can see the house. And just standing in front of the house that was used for one of my favorite movies of all time, was just great... I couldn't believe it, I know I sound corny, but it was just a big thing for me I suppose.

We plan on going back next weekend, during the day, I plan on getting a few more pictures and some video shots of the house.

We also plan on visiting the real Amityville house in Long Island, though that one will be harder to get pictures off and stuff, because that house is more known, almost every Amityville web site you go to has the address for the real house, and I've only seen one site with the address for the movie house.

Anyway, I have a new video project underway, I guess you would say it's in pre-production. I plan on doing 3 sections for the video, the first section will include a slide show of pics of what the real house looked like back in 1976 and then video shots of the real house of what it looks like now, the second part will be shots from the first movie of the house, and then shots of my video, the third, will contain a photo of the house from the 2005 re-make, and maybe some video from the new film, and the teaser trailer.

Anyway to tie this entry up, Amityville Horror 2005 is due out April, 2005... and I'm defintely going to see it the day its released, check the teaser trailer out at

"event","So... it's been quite a while since I've updated in here, I supposed a lot has happened... work is the same though there's no more short shifts, everyone is either working 11-5 or 5-11 now, because it's busier with the holiday's and the snow coming... I've gotten a lot more hours I suppose, Dave posted the schedule up for the next few weeks... actually, til the end of the month, so I already know my work schedule with that.

I also have my next Road Test coming up, Jess said she could take me when her finals and semster were over, so we're going on the 23rd, Mark's been letting me drive a little more, so, I'm hoping that'll help me do better and pass when I go.

Speaking of Mark, there's too much for words to get into to explain ""us""... we've been having a really rough relationship, we've had some really really bad arguments, but some really good times too. He doesn't trust me to hang out with Gary, and I had made plans to hang out with Gary this past weekend... unfortunantly, with the way things happened, it turned out Gary ended up going home early Sat morning before we were supposed to hang out. 

I'm not gonna lie, I had a really great time with Mark, we went out to eat and had a really calm day with no arguing... I think things are and could get better from here, at least I hope so.

He stopped by my job Friday, because Gary had decided he wasn't gonna come up this weekend because of Mark's trust issues, however, he decided to come, and stop by my job. It kind aggrivated me that he didn't want to hang out because Mark didn't trust me, which he had his reasons not to. Anyway Mark stopped by my job, and well, to put it in a nut shell, all hell broke loose... I guess in a way it was a good thing, they finally met and talked, so all that's done with, now the 3 of us just have to hang out and get passed that barrier. Mark says he feels better with his trust after meeting Gary and getting to know him in person, which is a good thing... I just wish things didn't have to happen the way they did... but it's the past, so, hopefully the future will be better, because I want to be really good friends with Gary, but I also don't want my relationship to go sour because I want to be friends with someone.

I must thank Jess for stepping in and ""counseling"" all of us, the three of us... she really helped a lot, and she's such a great friend... I haven't seen her much because of school and we haven't talked much because her computer's been messed up, but I was glad she was really there at a time of need, I love her :)

So anyway, my weekend was pretty amazing, even though it didn't go as planned, and even though I must admit, I felt bad for things not going as planned, I had a good time... minus the few arguments we had, it was a good weekend, and I hope there's more, because this arguing was beginning to get to me really bad. I just want everyone to be happy, and for everything to work out for the best, for everyone."

"event","So a few small things going on...

I went for my interview at target and got my drug test done, so I'm gonna call them tomorrow to see what happens...

Romina said she could take me for my road test as long as it was on a Thursday, and ironically I have off this Thursday, so, I'm gonna ask her tomorrow at work if she can take me next week.

Mark and I had a great weekend, we went bowling Saturday night for a few hours with his nephew Miguel, it was a lot of fun, I definantly wanna do it again,, but when I have money since I'm piss broke.

As far as money, I'm gonna see if Henriette will buy my drum set for 300 instead of 400... let's see with that, I'm gonna ask her Thurs at shift change.

Mark also took me to look at a few studio's unexpecedly on Sunday after my drug test for Target... I liked them, but I liked the layout of the one in his complex more, but it costs more lol and the other one I saw, across the highway from his complex, is much bigger... but I'm not all into it much, gonna see if they have a different layout for the studios.

I also paid another 100 for my court fines, so that's $200 of $800 done with, and only 75 left from the loan I took out at work, but I only pay $25 this time and my mom pays the $50... then that's over with thank god.

So it looks like the ball is slowly rolling, updates to come as soon as I get more interesting stuff done :)

"event","So I haven't updated in 3 months, and I guess alot's happened, I'll probably even forget to write a lot that has happened in here, though, I'll try to recollect everything, and it probably won't be in chronilogical order, just in order of how I remember it, but I'll try my best lol

So, I've seen a few movies... actually 2 movies, I went to see the Grudge with Jess and Andrew for Jess' birthday, it was alright, not really what I expected, not really scary either... a few weeks later I watched Saw with Mark, he lives right near Loews theatre, so we walked, now that one was really really good, I would definantly see it again and it's definantly on my ""to buy"" list of DVD's when it comes out.

Work's been.. the same, but different... I've been working a couple morning's now, but mostly nights too. Jess and I don't hang out much anymore, she's busy with school or hanging with Andrew... we work together every now and then, we might be working together tomorrow, her aol's been non-functional for a while, so we don't even talk much anymore unless it's at work. I'm in charge of P.O.P., not that it's a big deal, but it's fun and I enjoy doing it... all of the posters and stuff.

I've had a few road tests, well, 2... unfortunantly I failed both, for different reasons each time... I wanna try to go again, but I dunno who to ask to bring me... I might ask Jess if she can take me one more time, I really need to get my license. Jess took me the past 2 times, so hopefully she won't mind taking me one more time.

Amityville Dollhouse is still in limbo, I've barely even been home to bother with it, and even if I were home, I'd probably be too lazy to bother with it... it's one of those things where I tell myself I'm going to finish it, and when I finally actually go to the basement, I decide to put it off lol. I wanna finish it, but, I dunno when that'll happen.

So as far as my friends go... things are different... as I said, Jess and I don't hang out anymore really... sometimes I wonder if she thinks I depend on her too much, she had a birthday party in Oct. when her b-day passed, and I wasn't even aware of it, that kinda bothered me a lil... Laur and I talk on and off on line, she's usually away at class and stuff... Romina and I have been working together a lot, I always have fun with her, I actually work with her tomorrow night with either Jess or Andrew *I'm hoping Jess because I'm not liking something Andrew did*. Then there's Gary, who emailed me on AOL before I had my cable internet back, he's a really cool guy, he's come to my job a few times and we hung out, we have a lot in common, I'd really like to keep him as a friend, because he's definantly cool to have around.

Mark and I are... well, we've been on and off, a lot has happened between us, good and bad... we've had a lot of good times, but we've also argued for a while because of an incident that happened. We kinda got pulled over and arrested for reasons I'd rather not say, the following night *the night before Halloween* he had plans to go out with his friends, which he did, so I made plans with Gary to hang out... gary ended up spending the night, which wasn't all that of a big deal to me, but it was to Mark. Things are a lot better now but we had some really bad arguments for a couple of weeks after that incident... we went to court together and got that all situated, 800 in fines and a year probation... I've been staying at his house a lot the past few weeks, almost every night, I may be staying with him for a while so I can get another job and save money for my own place. As much as him and I have argued and fought, I love him a lot and like spending time with him... he's my sanity even though he drives me insane ;)

So I mentioned in my last entry that I had plans to move out, well those plans are beign forced more, and not just by me... my mom's boyfriend, Pete, is a real asshole, I fucking hate him, him and his stupid little asshole son. Pete decided Mark isn't allowed to stay over here anymore. And as he was flipping out about this, Brian told him that Mark and I have sex everytime he stays over *which is UNTRUE* and he ALSO said that Gary and I had sex when Gary stayed over... which is definantly untrue, and only pissed me off more because Mark was already accusing me of cheating on him... ugh... I need to get out of here. I'm 20 years old, I don't need some asshole who thinks he's the shit to tell me what to do in my own house. Things have always been this way, and they shouldn't have to change for him or anyone else, and whenever I tell someone about this situation, they ask me if he contributes to the house... NO, HE DOESN'T... not until recently, he's been living here for a year or so and he JUST GOT a job like last week... so who the fuck is he to tell me what to do. I don't need him or his son's little high school bullshit. My brother and his fiance had recently come to stay with us because of a situation they're in, and my brother has to bite his lip constantly about the shit that goes on here...

Well I know that's not everything, but that's the main stuff going on... I actually have to get going to work soon, the movies come in today... oh joy lol maybe I'll update again later when I recollect more stuff that's been going on... until then...."

"event","So yeah, things are the same with the small things I've done outside of what I normally do... I actually hjaven't been playing drums lately but I intend to play either tomorrow or the day after cuz I have off and I wanna keep up with it...

Work's been work, been working more night shifts, mostly with Jess or Andrew, those are always fun...  Jess and I talk a lot usually after work, we talked for about 2 hours tonight after work about random stuff...

Apprently, my mom and Pete plan on moving sometime in October to South NJ, to like Keyport or some shit... me on the other hand, I don't wanna go, so I plan on trying to find a one bedroom or a studio for myself, because I really don't want to leave here... I finally got some of my head together... a stable job, some good friends, and I just don't want to move again...

Josh and I are on bad bad terms... he seriously fucked up with a lot of shit, I got pissed off and emailed him, he wrote back and I didn't like his response... so I wrote an email saying I didn't wanna talk to him right now cuz I'm pissed off, and he writes back like ""whatever, call me if you need erb"" ok yeah Josh, that's really gonna make me feel better with you... fuckwad, he needs to clean his fuckin act up and grow up.

Things with Mark are good, we've been seeing each other quite a bit... he's been working a lot because he has to make moneyfor this apartment he's moving into next weekend, though he tries hard to see me as much as he can, and I appreciate it a lot =) he came tonight, he was supposed to stay over  tonight but we decided to hang out tomorrow and he'd stay then...

I opened a checking account, which is nothing too interesting but I wanna build my credit up for when I get a car or an apartment or something that requires credit...it also helps me soemwhat conserve money, I only have $20 left but that's better than nothing which  is what I would usually would have by now since I got paid over a week ago... my next check is going right into my account though, and the $50 from my mom for my birthday I'll keep as cash.

I went out with Jess recently to the movies, something we haven't done in a while, we saw Anchorman, it was funny :) I had a good time, me and her haven't hung out like that in a while, then again she came over a few weeks ago and we hung outside my house for a few hours and talked =)

Me and Laur hung out recently as well, we hung out with Shelly and Jenn, we went to Morgan's house cuz his parents were gone and had some ""festivities"" there hehe, it was fun, I was glad to see them all again.

Amityville Dollhouse is... I dunno, I've been too lazy to bother with it I guess, I kinda lost the motivation, though I plan on finishing it one of these days... I have off a lot this upcoming week so I'm sure I'll work on it eventually sometime, maybe even have some of it put together soon hopefully. I get kinda sick of seeing all of the peices all over my basement, so maybe I'll get so sick of that I'll just finish whatever I need to finish and nail it together cuz really now that I think of it, not much has to be done, I'm just so sick of measuring and cutting and filing... wish I could have someone else do that shit lol

but I did however build a model of my own house in the middle, when the blade broke on the jigsaw I was using, I had this box I was using for scrap wood, which I ended up using the build my model, I used scrap wallpaper for it from the Dollhouse and used popsicle sticks for the window frames and front porch, I have pics which someday when I have fast internet back, I'll post in my journal *if that's even possible* or my yahoo photo album.

I also built this mini model of the Amityville movie house from the first three films, I actually made that one a while ago, just never mentioned it I guess, or maybe I did and forgot lol but I built that too and that one's all done.

So I guess I've been somewhat busy, with work and side stuff... hanging with friends and whatnot, trying to keep myself outta the house or whatever... been renting a lot of movies too, watched The Whole Ten Yards last night, it wasn't that bad... also saw Kill Bill 2, really good movie as well... maybe I'll watch 13 Going on 30 tonight before bed...

So that's pretty much it, hoping to go camping since I didn't get to go the weekend I planned cuz it rained... so if I go I'm sure I'll update after I do... unti lthen..."

"event","So it hasn't been that long since I last updated, butttt a lot has happened... good and bad unfortunantly... I'll start off with the bad shit that way this can have a happy ending...

So Mark and I ran into Rene the other day while Mark was waiting for his bus... Rene wanted to go halves with someone, I was like ""fine whatever, I will"" well I gave him $20, and he gave me the $5 he had... he calls his person and tells him he's coming by, so he tells me he would be a little bit because he had to walk to the store, I see him, Mike *half white, the fucker who robbed me a few months back, obviously the cops don't do shit around here*, and Ciera leave... so I wait, and wait... 2 hours later I go to Cieras, her little brother tells me they went to some picnic in chrome... so I wait and wait, I call Cieras constantly, no answer... I go there again 2 hours after the first time... and there they all are, they look at me... Ciera doesn't even say a FUCKING word to me, Rene has this guilty look on his face... so I walk up to him and say ""Did you ever plan on coming back to my house?"" and he tells me this fucking bullshit story, that he had to go to chrome to get stuff and then my 20 dollars wasn't in his pocket and must have fallen through a hole in his pocket... yeah ok, I believe that... so I stood there for a while and decided to leave before I blew up...

First of all, he ddin't have to go to Chrome to get whatever... because he fucking called the person he needed to call before he left my house, who lives right down the fucking block from me... I find it really really funny that the one time my money just ""dissapears"" when he has it, is when he's with that cunt rag Mike..

So tonight I worked with Jess and he called me, he told me to stop by after work... so I had Jess drop me off at Ciera's, because he's staying there for a week while Ciera's gone... I go there, fucking tired as hell... already aggrivated with him... and he tells me ""Oh I was gonna smoke with you, but I didn't want to wait""
so I fuckin went there for no reason and wasted my time, Good job Rene at losing all of my trust... so, I have his bag of clothes... I told him if he wants it back, he has to pay me back all $45 he owes me now.... if he doesn't I'll just give his shit to someone or throw it away...
I'm beginning to get fed up with people walking all over me... I seriously am, I've already started opening my mouth, I'm sick of it honestly... between Nano and this and everything else in the past, I'm sick of just letting people walk all over me and lie to me, and if he fucks me over again I won't hesitate to call the cops and tell them where he is since he has a warrant out for his arrest.

I guess that's the only real bad news as of late...

Though on the very good side, Arthur got fired =D all of us at Blockbuster are very very happy... apparently Jess and Andrew knew, they just didn't know it would happen so soon... but he's been lying and shit, and they got rid of him... so good riddens to him, I'm glad he's gone... I hated when he was there, always up my ass about something... always accusing me of shit I didn't do, always trying to make me and everyone else feel like he was higher than them... I'm glad he's gone, me having a bigger mouth now makes me wonder if I would have ever went off on him one day,because he really got on my nerves...

So that adds more good news because that means Jess is now an official manager, and I get to work with her quite often ;) I know I said in the past that I never liked night shifts, but now I do =D it's so much more fun and time goes by faster when I work with her or Andrew... and now that Arthur's gone I have no reason not to look forward to working at night...

Mark and I have been doing well so far... his car should be fixed by tomorrow, so he might be stopping by sometime after he gets off work... I work a lot the next 2 weeks... Dave already made the schedule for the next 2 weeks so I have 10 days... I have tomorrow off though, so, here's to hoping it's not too boring... he spent the night here Saturday, his friend dropped him off at my job and they let me out early cuz it was dead... so we walked back to my house and hung here for the night, it was much fun, and I'm looking forward to seeing him again hopefully soon ;)

and for those of you wondering, Project Amityville Dollhouse is in limbo... my check is already gone with the $20 that ""dissapeared"" and the cigarettes I bought for the next 2 weeks... I have no money whatsoever til I get paid unless he actually pays me back, but I won't hold my breath..."

He told me this morning that he has trust issues and doesn't wanna get hurt... that kind bothered me, because I think he was afraid Josh and I might have ""one something"" since Josh visited me last night and we hung out all night til this morning... 

Josh is my best friend, he's like my brother... I could never do something with him if even given the chance and he has a girlfriend... and I have Mark, I have no reason to hook up or see any other guys right now, I like Mark... I like him a lot, but I want him to trust me... and I would like to take our friendship we have to another level soon.

He's funny, and cute... and has the same smart ass attitude as me... we joke around a lot and have fun, and I enjoy all my time with him... and I think he does too...

But I'm beginning to feel like there's something wrong with me again... I'm really afraid of getting hurt again, I don't want to get hurt again... I mean I've finally started to just get over Nano before I met him and I don't want to have to go through all that emotional and mental pain again, I can't do it... I'm so worn and tired from being hurt, I just want to be happy again, I just want to not be single anymore and just have some kind of stable relationship again.

I want him to trust me, I trust him 100%, I don't expect him to just walk out on me like Nano and James did, but I feel he's afraid I'm gonna hurt him when that's not my intention at all... he always says ""you hate me, you don't want me here"" and he usually says it in a joking way, but sometimes I think he says it to see if I'll respond with something opposite of what he says, which I always do...

I'm really picky with dating guys and how I attach to... I'm confused... I don't know exactly what he wants from me right now... and it kind of sucks and hurts at the same time, I don't know if he likes me enough to want to be with me and I don't want him to just decide some day that he doesn't want to... cuz that would just tear me up with the way I'm becoming attached again.

I know... most of yo who read this will call me stupid or dumb, for geting attached to quickly or whatever... but I've found someone I connect with again and someone I enjoy being with again, and I just don't wanna ruin it by pushing him away or anything... I'm just so confused right now, and so tired... I don't know what runs through his head about me *sigh*"

"event","So I've met a few guys since I last wrote in here... I feel bad not mentioning some of them because the ones I've met were mostly good guys that just didn't work out, I've already written about Matt...

So I met this guy Eric, he was really sweet and cute, but he lives really far... and it wouldn't be fair if he had to drive all the way here to see me everytime we would wanna see each other, and yeah the train is an option but I sadly can't afford that with my shitty checks.

I met Markus, the guy I'm currently seeing, I mentioned him in my last entry I just finished a minute ago... he's a good guy so far, he's cute and sweet, and funny.... affectionate, and he's not all that far from me either... so far things look good for me and him so I hope they go much more forward ;) right now we're in that stage where we're not friends, but we're not dating... though I see a date coming up soon enough ;)

And Josh got out of rehab... congrats, the night before I knew he was home I was told he would be sent to jail for violating probation while he was in there... but they let him out and he's home... only thing is he's not in Caretret anymore... and NJ transit buses don't go to Hopelawn *I used to live there back in 94-98*, which is where he lives now... so I'm supposed to visit him this week when Markus and I hang again.

Jess  has been getting her own shifts lately, and even better, I've gotten to work with her  on a couple of them, and it's great cuz we haven't worked together in so long...I'm proud of her, she could be the best thing that happened to blockbuster if they give ehr the raise she deserves to be a manager.

I hung out with Laur at work on Sunday morning when I worked with Jess, and Mark showed up too, it was fun... though Mark caused a little ruckus at work so I had to tame him down =P Laur and I are hanging today, we're gonna go see Shelly...

Project Amityville Dollhouse has gotten pretty far... I bought all the wallpaper I needed... and most of the walls are ready to be added in... unfortunantly the blade on my jigsaw broke so I have to buy new ones when i get paid on Friday... I'm guessing the house will be rput together sometime this weekend or the following week depending on what I do and how much time I have to put into it... I have some pics  I took of the peices just so I can show how I made it in case anyone asks. I also propped it together the other night and took pics, to get an idea of how it'll look when it's done finally...

Well I'm off to eat something before Laur gets here... everyone have a great day ;)"

"event","I know my past few entires have not really been happy ones, and I'm afraid to say this one won't be either in the beginning, because I was fuming earlier and I need to vent it out.

Well Rene was staying here, and my mom and Pete kicked him out, and now Petes son is staying here... so Mark *the current guy I'm seeing, which I'll get into when I'm done venting* wanted me to go to the DMV with him today, so I got up at 8:30 and he got here at like 9:15, we left, went to get his car inspected and came back... well he went to his car to get something and Rene was out there so he brought him up... well before Mark went to his car, he was going out of my room and Pete must have just woken up cuz he came out of his room... then he saw Rene come in the house and he started flipping...

""What the fuck is going on here, there's people staying over and people going in and out... bla bla bla...""

Ok first of all, Mark didn't stay over.. second, why the fuck should it matter if he did? Does Pete think because his son is here I'm gonna hide who I am? Cuz he must be on crack if he thinks that... I'm gay, and if he can't accept that I have a life and I date, then too fuckin bad.

And Rene was NOT roaming my house, he was going downstairs to tell his friends outside to meet him later somewhere... so fuck that too, damn bastard... 

Just because my mom's not home he thinks he's the fucking king of the house, like he can tell me what to do... Mark and I left to go to his house, and came back an hour later... we were in my room and Pete yelled up stairs ""Brian I'm going to the store, NO ONE is allowed in the house"" I fel like saying ""fuck you, fuck you and your high horse you asshole..."" who the hell is he to say my friends aren't allowed in my house?

I came out years ago, and I do not plan on going back in the closet ever again... and if Pete thinks I'm just gonna change cuz his son is here, he's wrong and if eh thinks he can tell me what to do and who I can have over, he can fuck himself... things have been like this since I came out, I've had boyfriends and gay friends sleep over... it was NEVER a problem and if it is for him, too damn bad, I don't change for anyone... I only change for me."

"event","And the snotbag of the year award goes to my mom... she's being a real bitch today, wakes me up to tell me her internet isn't working... so I go in there and immediately she blames it on me... funny, because, I NEVER GO ON THAT COMPUTER, so how the hell is it my fault?

Let me clear some things up... that computer is like a whore, everyone goes on it, everyone downloads shit on it... and no one takes care of it, it runs slow, programs take forever to load and start, there's shit all over in the folders that's just wasting space... worst of all, Rene goes on that computer... hey, it's not my computer, I don't care who goes on it, well immediately she tries to point it on me, saying that I disconnected something or some shit... yeah ok, if you wanna believe that go ahead... that pisses me off, giving me a snotty attitude, ok yeah, give me a snotty attitude and see how hard I try to fix it.

Then my bro comes here to throw something in the wash, he's in the room and Pete *my mom's b/f* calls, well my bro is telling her something and she gets all snappy and ""Shhhh!!"" waving her hands around like it's the end of the world.... but as soon a she talks to pete, she's all happy and giddy and yay life is great and perfect.

Just because she's unhappy and whatever that he's not here for the weekend, does not give her the right to take it out on me or anyone else... and I have a feeling that's what's with her snotty attitude today, he's been gone since Friday morning and she's going to meet him at his dad's in Perth Amboy in a few hours, why does she have to be so... different, when he's not around?

Shit, I'm single, I've BEEN single for well over a year now, have I ever taken it out on anyone? No.. I haven't, I get depressed, I get lonely, but I don't get bitter and angry and take it out on everyone around me that I'm lonely or depressed.

I dunno... I just had to let that out, cuz I was really annoyed..."

"event","Why should it matter what I do? It's part of who I am, isn't it?

Well good news is, Josh is out of rehab, and he's doing well... I'm quite proud of him and how he sounded when I talked to him, I'm glad he's better.

The bad news is, he's mad at me... apparently for smoking pot... why should that be an issue? I don't try to pursuade him into smoking pot like SOME PEOPLE I KNOW who he talks to, I would never hook him up with weed or even allow him to smoke against his own will... and he's mad at me? What the hell did I do wrong?

I was there for his girlfriend the past however many months he was gone, just like I promised him... I talked to her, and helped her, and tried to cheer her up when she was down about Josh not being around or whatever else was wrong. I kept my promise, and now he's mad at me for something stupid.

I could be so much worse... I could be worse than I was before he left... I could be sniffin coke, taking acid, or shooting heroin... am I? No, have I had the chances to? Yes... I have, and I always decline, I told Josh I would bnever do any other drugs and he even doubted me a few times, telling me I would ""get bored"" with pot... well it's been about 3 years that I've done it on and off, and I have yet to do anything else...

If anything I think I've gotten better since he was gone... I've been doing good at work, been taking any hours they give me, I have my permit... I'm keeping myself busy and away from the computer as much as possible... I've been working on a lot of my hobbies and things that make me happy... the only downside is that I'm lonely, but that could be fixed someday... and he's gonna stop talking to me because I smoke a little weed here and there?

I don't get it... what have i done that's so wrong? I don't shove it in his face, I don't try to get him to do it again AS MUCH as I would love to smoke with him again, because I'm a true friend... I keep my promises and I don't judge... I never judge anyone, if I'm friends with someone it's because of who they are and not what they do or don't do.

I could have easily been like ""Ok so you don't smoke pot, I don't want to hang out with you cuz you're no fun"", but no, I still want to be his friend... I still want to hang out with him and see how he's doing after being locked up, and he's just pushing me away for something petty.

I understand... rehab wasn't easy at all and I couldn't imagine how hard it was to be there for how long he was, but that's his mistake... everyone makes mistakes, and sometimes we can't help the consequences that come with the mistakes we make, but I didn't lock him up in rehab and tell him to change, I didn't tell him to violate probation or get caught with pot... if anything I tried to keep those things from happening.

Other than his girlfriend, I was the only friend who even visited him or wrote to him in rehab, the only person who gave a shit and kept in touch, after all I've lost the past few months because of Nano... all the trust issues I have, worrying about my close friends getting bored or finding someone better to hang out with, I never lost that with him and now he's just giving me the boot... so fuck it, I'm gonna go... because now I'm really aggrivated and hurt, I haven't done anything wrong and I don't deserve this..."

"event","What is wrong with me? Why is it that when someone hurts me, I can't let go of them or what they did? Why can't I just not think about them or focus on them once the damage is done?

I can't explain it... if I can't explain something like that, then I can't explain myself... because this has to do with me, with my head... and I cannot for the life of me, figure out why I can't just let go.

Nano hurt me badly, really badly, but it's been at least over a month since I've even talked to him and I still think about him and what he did, and it still hurts me a lot. I think about the bad times, and it hurts... I think about the good times, and it hurts a lot more, I try not to think about it at all, and eventually I get hit with feeling all that crap at once.

This is the same thing that happened with James, except I have the regret... the regret I have for ever meeting Nano, the thought that, I never should have met him to begin with, that I should have never given into him, because I wouldn't be in this situation if I hadn't. 

I want to just let go of it and forget about it, and move on, and be somewhat happy and somewhat normal again, instead I've turned into a bitter, lonely, man hating person... I question why some guys talk to me, I have trust issues worse than before, always afraid that the next guy I meet who I like, is going to hurt me the same way.

Worst part is, I can't help it when I feel that way... no matter how hard I can try to tell myself that not everyone is like Nano or not everyone is out to hurt me, I still have it in the back of my head that I'm going to get hurt, that feeling in the pit of my stomach like ""What if?""

I just want to let him go, I want to forget him... I want to forget what he did, and how he hurt me, and how much... I want to move on, and be happy again... I want someone who I know I can trust, who wants to be with me and not hurt me or lead me onto something that's just bullshit in the end."

"event","ok so I guess a lot's been going on since I last updated but not really, nothing too big to get into DEEP detail with.

Ok so the boi subject is a main topic for me most of the time so I'll start there... I was ""seeing"" this kid Matt, he's nice... but it's not gonna work out... I think he lies, actually I know he does... we haven't talked since I last saw him like over a week ago. My friend Shannon *who I met through Nano* hooked us up, which I appreciated a lot since no one really ever does that often and it's nice to meet someone who's not from on line or anything once in a while. Anyway, it's not gona work for a lot of reasons, I'd like to be his friend but I dunno if that'll happen, I recently told him I didn't wanna have sex anymore and I dunno how that goes for him, apparently he's ok with it, but, who knows, cuz I don't. I had met this kid Jeremy the day before I met Matt, well now Jeremy and him are talking, and that kinda bothers me, but whatever... I'm supposed to see Jeremy again this week and I'm looking forward to that.

So work has been the same ol stuff... movies, movies, and more movies... though, this past week and next week I've been loaded with hours, they've managed to give me 5 days last week and this next week coming up, so my next pay check is gonna kick ass. Jess, Andrew, and I had a little ""special Blockbuster meeting"" a couple weekends ago, that was fun ;) I'd like to do it again soon =)

I've started a project, I'm building a dollhouse from scratch... actually it's going to be a replica of the Amityville Dollhouse, obviously from the movie ""Amityville: Dollhouse"", I've been working on it for about 2 weeks now. I bought some windows, doors, staircases, and ply wood. I cut the ply wood yesterday and have been filing it down since, it's takin a while but I'm sure it's gonna come out nice, once I get it filed down and all the windows/doors cut out, I'll be putting wallpaper on the walls, then I'll be able to nail/glue it together, beyond that all I have to do is buy more windows for it, paint them, glue them, and pop them in ;) it's kind of exciting for me, tho for most people it's not, I started it for a lot of reasons. I need to stop spending so much time sitting here on the computer for one, it helps me keep my mind off things I don't wanna think about, and it gives me something to be detailed about, I'll have pictures as soon as I nail it together :)

Been hanging out with different people lately outside of work... Jess, and my friend Laur who's home from college for the summer. She's been helping me out getting the stuff for my house, which I appreciate a lot. I also saw Shelly the other night who I haven't seen in a lonnnnnng ass time. I see Shannon every now and then, but not all that much... 

So basically I've been busy, or trying to be... either working on my project, at work, hanging with friends, or trying to find ""mr right"" whenever he may appear"

I'm trying real hard to just get things off my mind  and I only end up worse off than I was because the things I try to do or the plans I try to make don't happen 95% of the time. Why does it have to be like this?

I'm not blaming anyone for some of the things that have happened, because, yeah, shit happens... like I was supposed to hang with Jess on Sat after she got off work, and that didn't happen cuz the night before her and a friend of ours got really drunk and her parents weren't too happy with the throwing up and stuff.

I fucking hate it here, I hate sitting in this house with nothing to do... I hate this town, I hate not having a car... I hate not being able to drive or learn to drive.. I fucking hate just about everything right now.

I have the few people I talk to on line, who like to make excuses everytime I put effort into meeting them or hanging out with them... always some form of bullshit about why they can't hang out, sometimes it's true, but a lot of times I can tell they're lying through their teeth for whatever reason.

I'm so sick of everything... I'm so sick of life... I hate life, I hate waking up in the morning to nothing but shit..."

"event","Not even sure where to begin anymore... there's just drama everywhere in my life right now... I guess I could begin with fuck face...

Ok so there's fuck face, which, when I say that name, I'm reffering to Nano... decides not to call me for a week... I call him and leave msgs on his phone cuz the movie we watched the last time I saw him was still checked out on my account and I wanted to make sure he dropped it off... well finally he calls me a week later after we last talked and tells me he dropped it off. So I ask him why he hasn't called me, and he decides to tell me ""I'm just laying low, I think it's better if we don't talk for a while...""
Ok, so two words for that, FUCK YOU... first you use me, you can barely make any time to be the friend you were... and then you put me through this bullshit you call a friendship, by droping everything we had for some guy... then you call ME and tell ME you don't want to be my friend? Ok, fuck you then.
I find out later that most of the reason had to do with his dumb ass boyfriend, apparently his stupid boyfriend flipped out about me for whatever reason... dunno what stick is up his ass, oh wait, apparently Nano's is... anyway, the guy doesn't even fuckin know me and he's gonna tell Nano we can't be friends? And then for Nano to actually go along with it? Ok well, fuck them both then...
I would really like to cause Nano pain and regret, I'm so full of anger and depression bcause of the bullshit, lies, and broken promises and just everything... as I said before, I regret meeting him and I kick myself in the face for ever meeting him, because I didn't want to meet him for these exact reasons, and now I have to suffer while he's happy go lucky with his boyfriend...
I wish I had the power to make him feel the way I do, make him hurt... cuz believe me, if I ever did, I would in a heartbeat, no one who does the shit he did deserves to be happy... and I hope he suffers one day and regrets this.

Then there's Joe... so last week I had plans to see Joe *just in case I never mentioned Joe or how I met him, I met him with Nano... he's a mutaul friend of ours*. Anyway I told him I only had off Monday and Tuesday, so if I were going to come stay over, it would have to be Monday. So he tells me that he'll call me after work on Monday.. so I wait, and wait, and wait... no call from Joe. So I talk to his room mate on line, and he says he'll pick me up, so he picks me up and decides to tell me that Joe isn't at work, he has off that week because it was the week of his birthday, and that he probably said that in case his new date wanted to go out... his new date that Nano hooked him up with...
Ok so can we say FUCKED UP? You're going to lie to me the same exact way Nano did while I'm still dealing with how I feel for Nano? Ok so I let that slide... I didn't get mad, and when I saw him, I told him how I was happy to see him and I missed him... things were fine... his room mate dropped me home the next day... and then Joe signs on line, I ask him how his date went *he had one earlier before I left* and he says ""bite me"" which is one of his usual responses... then he stops responding... then he doesn't answer his phone or return my msgs... or answer any of my im's.... so here I am, wondering, what the fuck is his problem...
Well APPARENTLY his room mate, Marcelo, told Joe that I told him how Joe and I met... which was basically a 3-some we had... and then he told Joe that him and I had hooked up... so now I don't know for sure why Joe is mad at me, and he won't tell me why or even talk to me... I told his room mate and he's like ""Oh I'll talk to him"" but this was like 3 days ago and Joe still isn't talking to me... so wtf?
And the part that really upsets me is that... did I get upset when HE LIED to me the SAME way Nano did? I had every right to get mad, and I didn't... I shrugged it off... and then he's gonna get mad at me and not even tell me why? What the fuck is that?

Then I have Nini telling me to take all of this ""to a grain of salt"" ok yeah, I'll just look at all the shit I'm going through and take it to a grain of salt... cuz it's just that easy, isn't it? I understand there are worse things in the world and things could GET worse than they are... but THEY'RE BAD as it is, very bad... so then my response to that was ""if you say so"" and basically hers was ""I don't have the energy to argue abou this, good night"" so I was like ""Yep good night"" and then she basically said ""fuck you"" and flipped on me... about how my ""boy troubles"" as she called it aren't bad because there are worse things going on in the world... ok so fuck that, I'm a person, I have feelings... and just because someone didn't die or get hurt, doesn't mean I don't hurt from anything... Nano may not have died, but I WAS CLOSE to him... I opened myself up to him, and I had a great friendship with him for about 3 months and now it's just being thrown away for some guy he met... how the FUCK is that supposed to make me feel in the end? Take it to a grain of salt my big white ass... 

Then, the people around me who actually give a shit and care, are having their own shit go on... my friend Lauren, has shit going on with this dumb ass fucker Alex, who thinks he's god's gift because he has a big dick and good looks, when in reality his personality makes him so much less attractive... I'df rather date the pope with how shitty his personality is... and then Jess, from work... she's havin issues with her feelings for someone she's close to, and she's been kinda blah about it the past week or so... Victoria, Josh's girlfriend... was talkin about killing herself today cuz of all the shit she's going through with Josh not being around... I don't even know what goes in with Fallon anymore, she never talks to me ever... I im her and she doesn't respond, not even to let me know that she wasn't near the computer... and Nini and I barely even talk as it is...

I've hit rock bottom... I really have, I'm so sick of life and just everything lately... I'm miserable and I can't do anything about it, because the only thing that will heal my situation with fuck face is time... everything else will resolve eventually, soon too I hope... but right now everything is just at it's shittiest... I just want to be happy, and I'm trying so hard to be there for everyone else because I don't want the people around me sad... but I feel as if I might be failing... I feel like I'm fucking everything up lately... like Nano and Joe are my fault and I'm so weak because of those situations, that I can't help the ones who care...

I'm lost, and I don't even know what to do... I'm so confused and just hurt... emotionally and mentally stressed... so much bullshit going on, and so much of it I can't do anything about... things in my head I can't control no matter how hard I try..."

"event","I wrote this, as an way message on AIM but it wouldn't fit, so I'm gonna post it in here... it's pretty much how I feel about Nano...

You say you want to talk,
But you never call,

You say you want to hang,
But you never show,

You say you want to be my friend,
But you don't prove it


It's sad, but true... short and sweet... nothing too long od dramatic, or exaggerated... small and simple...

I'm pretty much in my ""fuck it"" mood... I don't really are anymore about what happens with him and me... I'm so fed up and just done, and at the end of my rope... he hasn't called me or attemped anything to contact me, so fuck him... if he doesn't wanna put in effort, why should I?"

"event","So that title line was the best thing I could come up with to fit what I'm probably going to ramble and rant about in here this time...

I haven't  been much of an updater, I can't really say why... I go through phases where I updated everyday, and then I update like once every blue moon.

So anyway, to get onto the everyday things, as you guessed, work's been the same... not much different going on there, still working 3 days a week in the morning, and uh... still liking it...

So I have 4 sets of news, Nano, Lauren, Jess, and Josh... 

I've been hanging out with Jess and my friend Laur a few times since I last wrote in here, a lot of fun in that part of my life... a lot of laughter and good times.

Jess and I went to the movies, we saw Taking Lives last week... very good movie, but I think I had her laughing the whole time... I had a lot of commentary lol but it was great, I'm glad I got to hang out with Jess on a non-work level, it was fun :) I feel we've gotten a little more close, as friends, too. There's been stuff going on to me that she relates to... so my current situation with Nano, is a lot tot alk about, but she understands as well.

Laur's been comin up the past few weekends, been spending a lot of time with her, especially this weekend, we hung out Thurs, Fri, and Sat *last night*... a lot of good times with her, she's having a rough time with one of her guy friends, so I'm glad I cheer her up, but at the same time she's helping me too... lot's of fun and laughs, I'm glad she comes to me for support =) I also was reuinted with someone from middle school, this girl Amy, who we hung out with all weekend, and once last weekend, it was cool =)

So I also saw Josh yesterday morning, it's been so long, since he was sent to rehab and all that, I haven't seen him, go a few letters from him and talked to him on the phone like once or twice. He seemed really happy to see me, as I was him. The kid owes me his life for making me get up at 8:30am =) but he's lik my bro, I wasn't gonna pass on seeing him, I honestly miss him *and before anyone gets any ideas, NO, I AM NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM*. But it's weird not having him around, I mean he's my only friend in this town, so... it sucks a lot. His mom actually moved recently, to Hopelawn. I used to live there back in like 95-98. In a way it sucks, cuz he won't be down the street anymore... buttttt I think this will be good for him, this town is trouble, and that's what he needs to stay out of when he gets released. I want to see him do real good when he's out... he got his GED, and I want to see him get far in life... can't wait to see him again, maybe this upcoming weekend =)

I've seen a few movies lately... Dawn of the Dead being one of them, good movie... I also saw Taking Lives last week with Jess, that was another good one. I rented Cube, Cube 2 and Memento... 3 good movies, though mind benders that leave you thinking at the end of the movie...

I've also been doing good saving for a car, I have almost $300 saved so far, another 5 months to save up... plus I told everyone I wanted money for my birthday, which would go right to my savings...

ok so there's the Nano situation... I'm not even gonna bother typing a long story in detail anymore... basically, I went to his house a few weekends ago to visit... I wrote this 5 opage note for him to read, he had no response, so I came out and said some things I thought and felt, which he didn't like... which led to an argument... we made up, and we hung out again last week... and things were fine, but of course he covered up something that I didn't like and I got upset again... we got into a huge argument over the phone... then he called me back a half hour later, asked me if I was ok... I cried my eyes out and didn't say anything to whole time except ""I don't want to be alone anymore and it hurts"" and that leaves that... I'm done putting effort, he really hurt me this time... and I've just reached the point where I don't care anymore... if he calls, he calls... if he wants to hang out, fine.. but I'm not sitting around waiting anymore... because trying to be his friend doesn't matter anymore... this Mike guy is the only thing he really cares for anymore, so, fine.. he wants to be my friend, I'm leaving that up to him now... cuz I'm done puttingmyself through hell because he makes promises he can't keep or says things he shouldn't that hurt me... or whatever...

So I look forward to work this week, my pay check on Friday... gotta pay back some money I took out from savings this week and add whatever else I add to it from my pay... also the money my mom owes me... and I'm going to the movies with Jess, Romina, and Andrew from work to see the Punisher =) so that should be fun... no plans yet this week, but I intend to make some, that's for damn sure"

"event","Tonight was an unexpected night... things went from one thing to another... I hadn't had anything planned today/tonight... I asked Joe if he could come hang out tonight, he said he would but he wanted to take a nap.

Wel I talked to this guy who I've been talking to on line, and he said he wanted to meet... so I figured I had a few hours to hang or whatever.... well I didn't hear from him, then Joe cancelled his plans with me... we decided to hang out Tuesday... well then Nano called, he was hanging with Mike,apparently they needed help moving stuff to the basement. I hesitated to say yes, but, I did.

I was anxious the entire ride there... cuz I didn't know how I'd feel there or what, but I knew I had to stop hiding. Well things were ok, I was definantly better this time... I was more of myself, I was the smart ass I usually am. Nano and I joked around a lot, as Mike and I picked on Nano too... it was fun, I was fine... except I have to admit, I'm still hurting.

I've told many people how I feel in a metaphorical way, but I basically feel like an important part of me was ripped off... and everytime I think about the way things used to be or I think of Mike and Nano in ""that way"", I bleed.... it hurts a lot... I want it to stop, I want to stop hurting... I want to forget how things used to be between me and him. I want to runawayfrom these feelings =(

One thing Nano asked me a few weeks ago was if I regretting meeting him and being his friend... I didn't know how to answer, but I know the answer now.

I don't regret meeting him or being his friend, I do, however, regret opening up to him as much as I have... Nano and I never had sex, for a reason... I didn't want to get hurt if a situation like this ever came along, unfortunantly I found out the hard way that it's not that easy and that there doesn't have to be sex to have an attachment. I regret all the affection, I wish it never happened, cuz I would never feel this way if it didn't... 

But... you can't change the past, you can only learn from it... and I learned quite a bit from this experience... 

Nano means a lot to me as a friend... I still want to be friends with him, I wouldn't be putting myself through this if I didn't. But it's going to take time for me to get through this... hopefully not too much time, but I can't say how long... I dunno...

I'm hanging with him tomorrow... so... we'll see what happens..."

"event","Well I apologized to Mike the other night for the way I acted the one Sunday, when me, nano, and him were at the mall. I felt really good afterwards, kinda like a weight was lifted off my chest.

Lately things with Nano are just... I dunno... on and off I guess.... sometimes I'm ok sometimes I'm not. It just bothers me that he never makes that much time for me anymore, everytime he's with Mike I just fee all blah. It's not even really just that, I just wish someone were into me like that again... I wish someone liked me like Mike likes Nano... it sucks =( I wanna date again, I want a boyfriend again, and it's just not happening

Everything else is the same... work, drums... I'm usually home when I'm not working... *sigh* things are back to the way they were, as much as I wish they weren't... I hate being home so much, I'm beginning to get depressed again... blah

On the bright side, I saw Lauren and Alex last night, I was happy to see them again... hopefully we'll hang out more over the summer, I enjoy hanging with them. I hope they had fun last night, I know I did."

Uhhh I bought a few dvd's too at the mall when we went Sunday... Urban Legends: Final Cut and Halloween 25th Anniversary Edition... uhhh I guess that's about all that's going on... nothing too exciting, playing the drums a lot more I guess... I wanna get guitar strings soon cuz I miss playing guitar..."

"event","So yeah... things have been a little shitty... things with Nano have been a little uhhh... I guess crazy? He went on a date last weekend, and that was fine... whatever... I was blown off 3 times last week by 3 different people, so I wasn't in a very good mood. Well I stayed over Nano's on Saturday and we were supposed to hang Sunday and he was gonna take me driving. Well anyway he tells me that he's going to breakfast with Mike in the morning... he asked me if I wanetd to go....

I said no at first, cuz I didn't feel like getting up early and I wasn't sure how comfortable I would be... then I said maybe, and by the time morning came I said yes... so i went, and he seemed like a really nice guy... but as everyone knows from all of my past situations like this... where I like someone, and they don't like me back, and they're ""seeing"" someone else... I feel threatened. Unfortunantly, i can't help that, that's how I am, it's an insecurity I've had for a while now... I'm too afraid of losing something that means so much to me, I can't even explain how much myfriendship with Nano means, but he's the only person who really gets me out of this mess I'm in most of the time.

Anyway, we had breakfast and I guess I was fine at first... but then it turned out Mike, his date, hung out with us all day... and I was just not prepared for that, and just really uncomfortable... it's nothing agains Mike, I don't dislike him or hate him or anything like that at all, I'm sure he's a wonderful guy with a good head on his shoulders... I just felt very awkward, and threatened... and not because he made me feel that way, because that's just how i felt in that situation.

I knew Nano would eventually date or whatever, and that's fine... but it's just kind of unexpected... we had a conversation a few weeks ago about how we feel for each other and whatnot, and he told me he doesn't want to date becayse he doesn't know what he wants... so this is just unexpected too. And the whole threatened thing, well, I'm not sure I understand completely why I get threatened. Like I said, it has nothing to do with him at all... it's all me really, I'm just so afraid of someone taking the most important thing to me away. I've accomplished so much since I met Nano and he's been there for me through so many things already... and whenever I need someone to hang with or somewhere to go, he was there. And now I'm just afraid of losing that... I don't want to be upset one day and call him, and ask him if I can stay at his place and have him go ""No I can't""  he's never done that before since I met him, not once... and now I'm just afraid taht's how it's going to be...

I feel so free and open at nano's... I feel like I'm at home there, which is definantly not how I really feel here honestly... I feel like I can be myself there and around him, like I can do or be anything and I know he won't judge me and he'll support me... and I'm so afraid of losing it that I shut down and get quiet, because I don't know how else to react. I want Nano to be happy and everything, but I don't want anything to change between me and him in a bad way, I want to still be able to call him if I'm down or if I have shit going on, and ask him if he can pick me up, and have him be like ""sure I'll be over there in 10 minutes""

I dunno... I guess things are better since Sunday, cuz we talked and all that... but, I dunno, I'm just kinda like blah... I want to see how it goes, I'm hoping it works out, I don't want to be back where I was before I met him =("

"event","Ok so work has been the same, I still love it... the hours are still a little iffy for me but I deal... I get paid today so lets hope my check doesn't suck major ass.

I've still been hanging out with Nano a lot... still having a lot of fun with him, going out and doing things. He took me to the DMV on Monday after I got off work... I FINALLY passed the permit test!!!!! =) I'm so happy, he's gonna take me test driving sometime this weekend probably, =)

I hung out with Lauren on Weds almost all day, with her very sexy friend Alex... woof woof! I had a great time, we all did... we had a lot of fun, joking around and goofing off, it was great, I'm gladwe had time to hang out finally =)

Uhmmm I'm hopefully smoking my last pack of cigarettes... I plan on buying the patch today, so we'll see how that goes, I really wanna quit badly, it's such a bad habit and it costs so much and I hate smoking, the only reason I smoke is because I'm addicted, so let's hope this patch thing works for the best.

I also went to Englishtown a few weekends ago with Nano and Donnie, Donnie brought his friend and we met up with Shannon *a guy* to hang out with too, it was fun, the normal joking around. I didn't really find anything I was looking for, but it was a really nice day out and I had a good time.

Other than that, it's the normal stuff, been playing drums a lot more now that it's nicer... but I'm off to take a nap before work ;) I'll update laaaata!"

"event","So there've been a few interesting things going on, and since I'm not really doing much, except putting laundry away, I may as well update instead of waiting 3 weeks totype a huge essay on my life...

Work sucks, we're over staffed and hours have been cut tremendously... I hate it, they only gave me 2 days again!!! WTF?! I asked Nano to see if he could get me a job with him at Bed Bath and Beyond... I'll still stay at Blockbuster, but, this 2 day thing isn't cutting it.

Speaking of work, pay day is coming up this Friday... I'm looking forward to it in some ways, but in others, I'm not... my last check was for shit, $100... so that lasted me like., 2 days... this check should be double that, I'm guessing somewhere $200 or over, and hopefully my income tax checks will come in the mail soon, I'll cash those with whatever check I get next... I have plans with those checks... anyway, I know my mom's gonna hit me up for money and I really don't want to do it.

She needs to start supporting herself... sitting home all day with her boyfriend doing absolutely nothing while I'm working and making money bothers me. She used to go up my ass about how I need a job and how I need to support myself, and now I have a job and I'm BARELY supporting myself and now she's just as bad!! Of course, I can't say anything, because if I do she'll get all defensive and bitchy... there's no way in hell I'm lending her money, she can kiss my ass before I even do that, I know she'll want me to buy her cigarettes... and I don't want to do that either, but I know if I don't, she'll hang me up like a coat and go on and on and on about how she used to always buy them for me and shit. And yes, she does have a point, but this whole sitting around doing nothing thing does not make her look any better... I'm the only person in this house with a job, how the hell is that supposed to make me feel? If it weren't for Nano, I don't know how I would have survived the past few weeks, because as I said, hours suck, and pay sucks... and if I have to help her out cuz I feel ""bad"" or whatever... then I'm not gonna get anywhere with myself.

I'dreally like for her to go off on me and tell me that she doesn't charge me rent here... cuz I have a lot to say about that too, she's brought it up a few times... first of all, she DOESN'T PAY RENT here, so why the hell would I? Section 8 covers our rent, she doesn't pay a dime, if she even dared to charge me for rent, I would flip out on her ass... and if she started going off about that fact that I have cable internet, I would pay it myself. There's noooooo way in hell I'm giving HER money to pay off the cable bill... the last time I did that my money went nowhere, and the cable bill *that was in my name* never got paid off like it was suposed to... sooo if she starts bitchin about that I'll know how to handle that, and if she don't like it, oh the fuck well.

Anyway on the GOOD side, I'm going to Englishtown this Sunday with nano, I'm hoping to find some of the DVD's I've wanted for cheap prices so I can buy them all off at once... also gonna look for a few other things, like a microphone stand and a few cd's... that's about all goin on here... so until then...."

"event","Where to begin? Cuz so much has happened I wouldn't know where to start....

For starters, Josh is gone... he went to his court date and he got locked up, he  might not be back until May or June... I miss the little brat =/ it's so weird without him around to hang out with.... he's been writing to me, I sent a letter out the other day, so we'll see what happens with that...

My job's been the usual... I really only work mornings, somehow I managed to get 5 days of work in last week when I was only scheduled for 3, go me!

Remember hot guy Mike? Well him and his friends robbed me 2 weeks ago... it's such a long story so I'll give the break down... basically he asked for me to lend him money, I said no, he got me to go downstairs.... hsi friends took my money out of my safe, and they all basically darted out of my house before I could do anything... Mike called me begging me not to press charges and that he'll pay me back, he might not have to pay me back cash... cuz I have an offer in mind he might not want to refuse...

My following check, the one I got last Friday, sucked... $100!! What the hell... oh well, I'll survive til I get paid again... my next check should be nice, since I've gotten 7 days of work in, the only scheduled me for 2 days this week, Monday morning and Saturday... so I've been trying to keep myself occupied with the tons of free time I have.

I've also met some people... first is Jorge, things didn't go to well with him... we talked on line for a while, he always had jealousy issues with me... we met, and after we met, they got worse... always trying to make me feel bad for not being on line 24/7, so that didn't work out... I also met this real awesome, sweet dude Nano, he lives in Woodbridge. We hang out allll the time whenever we're both free, we get along really well, and we're both huge smart asses, so we both have a lot of mouth for each other hahaha, I drive him nuts sometimes but it's all good cuz he knows I'm joking ;). And then there's Dave, who I'm going on a date with tomorrow, but uhm... I'm broke... so we'll see how that goes... I don't see me and him being more than friends though, he's not as interested as I thought he was... he's a really nice guy and all, I guess he's just too busy or whatever....

Other than that I've barely been home, I've done some shopping... got a few new movies for my collection, changed my room around and livened it up a bit, hung a bunch of posters on my walls, picture frames too... looks nice in here now, I don't get cabin fever as easily now :)

I've also met two very awesome guys through Nano, Rob and Donnie... they're great guys, I've met Rob a few times... he's funny, and sexy ;) hehehe Donnie seems funny too, I only met him in person once, so I was a lil shy plus I was a lil high when I met him  oops my mistake... I'm looking forward to seeing them all again sometime...

I've also been talking to Josh's girlfriend a lot, me and her get along well... we never really hang out or anything but she's an awesome girl... Josh is very lucky to have her =) if I were straight I'd date her hehehe

But Nano and I are already like best friends... it's amazing how well we get along... we joke around so much... apparently I keep him out of trouble... he's always buying me things EVEN WHEN I ASK HIM NOT TO!!!! lol but it's all good... 

And that's pretty much everything that's going on here... my life is more exciting now, and I'm not home 24/7 like I used to be, which is a GOOD thing..."

"event","So today's just a weird/odd/boring day...

I spent last weekend *Sat night - Monday afternoon* with Sean, he picked me up from work... I had a really great time with him, it was really good to just get out of this house/city/state for a few days and spend it with someone who's caring, supportive, gay, and cuddly. We watched some movies, I showed him my videos... I saw his art work, met his mom and step dad, it was nice, I plan on going back in mid-March for a week... I appreciate everything he did, picking me up/dropping me off... I had a great time and I'm looking forward to more =)

Josh's situation was just complicating everyday... he kept changing his mind about whether he was gonna stay on the run or g to his court date...well he went to his court date this morning, and he gotlocked up... it's up to his mom when he gets to come out, so we'll see how long that lasts... I'm gonna miss him though, it's gonna be boring without him around...

Work's been the same, I called out Saturday though, and I'm covering for Bobbie Jo on Friday, she covered for me today... so I'm not losing any hours there, thank god. But work has been fun and the usua stuff... pay day is coming up in 4 days, soI'm looking forward to that, though, my check s gonna suck cuz I called out and I didn't get that many hours... blarg. On the good side, I got a bunch of poster frames that they were gonna throw away from the old store, all in perfect condition, I hung up posters all over my walls...my room looks more lively, but it feels more closed in lol.

I also got my taxes, so I have to get those done and mail them out, so I can get them back, cash them and have some extra money in my pocket ;)

Other than that, not much is going on... same stuff, diff day... not working til Thurs, Fri, and Sat morning... so I dunno what I'm gonna be up to the next few days..."

"event","Yeah if that line is true, then, the reason things happen for me, is to fuck up everything else going on in my life... apparently Josh is in some trouble with the cops, his mom kicked him out, and he was staying at his girlfriends. But her dad found out, and wasn't too happy, so round 11pm Tuesday night my doorbell rings and it's him. He's stayin here, not sure how long, maybe til Monday if he goes to his girls... I HAD plans this weekend, to go away, but that's not happening now. I can't leave him here for 2 reasons - 1) my mom would not agree with that   (2) I don't agree with that... he's too young and immature to be left alone here... I left for 5 minutes yesterday and I came home to my smoke alarm going off and the upstairs smelling like lighter fluid and smoke... so, I don't need to come to my house being burned down at the end of the weekend.

So my plans for the weekend... are gone, I'm stuck home yet again to do absolutely fuckin nothing all weekend except sit here, be miserable, and try not to kill Josh if he doesn't drive me too nuts...

Anyway... in other news... I bought my copy of Freddy Vs. Jason on DVD last Thursday, I was real happy about that... Friday I'm buying Cabin Fever, Identity, and Wrong Turn from my job... I only worked 3 days this week, Monday, today, and Sat morning... my check, which I get Friday, probably won't be for that much considering the shitty hours they've given me lately.

""To be blunt, and I tried to be nice, I find you to be codependent, immature, weak (in mind and spirit), self centered, whinny, miserable, conniving.""
Nice, right? I got that as a reply to an email I sent him after he told me he didn't want to have anything to do with him, apparently those are his reasons for not wanting to have anything to do with me. Damn cunt rag...

I dunno what else is going on, I guess nothing... it's snowing out, it's cold, and it's 4am... I guess I'll wake Josh up and see if he wants somethin to eat...."

"event","The holidays obviously aren't my favorite time of the year, anyway, things have been the same lately... work is work, I still love it, I getpaid tomorrow, woo hoo! I haven't seen Ed yet, as expected, and I might see Elvis soon since he's done with finals today. We're FINALLY DONE moving into the new store, we opened Sunday, can't tell you how much of a releif that is.

Though one thing I have to say, is that I've been quite annoyed and upset about something lately... my mom's been getting on my nerves, borrowing money and not paying me back, then when I need money for food or something, I don't have it, I ask her to pick me up something to eat and she barely does. So tonight, I asked her to pick me up something and she goes off on me... so, I wrote this note to her... leave comments if you want, I tried to not piss her off but I also kept what I felt and had to say in the note:

Mom,
    I have to admit, I'm a little upset that you went off on me earlier. You made me feel like I don't do anything around the house, but I always do stuff even when I'm not asked to. I unload/reload the dishwasher, I take the garbage out, I clean up the kitchen and living room to make it look clean and nice. I don't like that I have to hound you to pay me back, I don't mind lending you money at all, but when I run out of cash and you don't pay me back,what am I supposed to do? I ask you to pick me up something to eat from time to time and you make me feel like it's coming out of your pocket, I would buy it myself if I had money to, but I don't because I keep lending you money and I have to hound you to pay me back.

I have to be honest, I don't thin I can lend as much money as I have been anymore, and I don't think I can keep doing it. I like having money when I need it, how do you think I feel when you tell me you'll pay me back, I depend on it for something and then you don't? I didn't mind lending you money at first, but that was $125 and two weeks later I'm broke with nothing to eat. I appreciate you not making me pay room and board, and I'm not writing this to piss you off, or make you feel bad or upset you.

But this is how I feel, and I wasn't sure how to say it and I didn't want to get into an argument. I don't know what else to say, I love you.
    Love,
        Antny"

"event","So things have been quite normal... work and all... I have 3 days off after tomorrow and not a damn thing to do yet... I was supposed to meet with this guy Kyle last weekend but he never called or anything, so, I dunno what the hell happened with him... work was unsuaully BUSY on Thanksgiving night, Black Friday was quite busy as well, and Thanksgiving sucked ass too.

Friday after Thanksgiving I hung out with Elvis, Rene, and Dulce... we hung out and had fun... watched some of Triple X and played this game, I forgot the name of it, but it was fun...

I've been getting as many hours in as I can, I worked Saturday, yesterday, and today, I work tomorrow 5-11, and then 3 days off, til Sunday night... no plans as of yet, but I'm hoping to make some, I might see Ed tomorrow night hopefully.

Other than that it's been too cold, and the small snow storm we had today didn't cheer me up, cuz I hate the cold weather...

But I must mention something else... who the hell is posting shit in my journal? And you know who you are.... -

""hey ant

sorry those postings were left before. they weren't from me. honest. I hope you're doing ok. good luck

-james""

Wtf is this? You trying to start shit between me and James? I talked to James myself and he had no clue what I was talking about, I even pasted it into an IM for him and he said it wasn't him. And as much as James might have fucked with me in the past, I seriously doubt he would do this and not admit to it... whoever the hell is doing this, stop hiding behind James' personality and confront me, because you're wasting my time with this baby bullshit of yours."

"event","So yeah, I can't really remember the last time I updated, except that it was sometime in mid November... last week was a lot of work, I was only scheduled for 2 days and I ended up working 4... I got a lot of hours in, I hung out with Elvis, Rene, Arnold, and Dulce for her birthday the other night, they picked me up from work and we went out to Chilli's in Paramus to eat.

The following night I met up with Ed... I was all tense about stuff going on and that I hadn't seen him in a while... unfortunantly we didn't cuddle, or, anything for that matter... just before he left we hugged, and I lost it. I cried for about 30 minutes and he kept telling me everything was going to be ok... eventaully he left. He promised we'd hang out sometime within the next 2 weeks, so we'll see.

I guess everything on the work side is good... been getting those hours in, makin money and enjoying the work I do for it. We should be in the new store by the mid/end of this week, should be interesting.

I'm not working tomorrow, I have a dr's appointment at 3:30, so I guess they didn't need me for the night shift. But I'm working Tues morning, Weds and Thursday night, and Friday morning... and I think Tuesday night they'll need help with setting up the computers in the new store.

Yeah so... unfortunantly I've caught feelings for Ed, and unfortunantly he doesn't have those feelings for me... it kinda sucks when I really think about it in deep thought, for the first time in 7 months I like someone and they don't like me, that's just a little upsetting... ok maybe not a little, but it's upsetting, and meeting new guys is nearly impossible lately, no car, or not interested seems to be the cases most times."

"event","So yeah, my phone was shut off on Halloween, so I haven't really been on line since before that. I'm writing this at 5am on a work night because I have insomnia, and well, the phone isn't on but I decided to type it all out and try to get it off my mind so maybe I can sleep before I work tomorrow morning. Anyway, a few things have been going on so I guess I'll go on and write about them.

Halloween was fun, I had a little get together, friends met friends... I stopped by my job in costume, I was Jason this year... anyway I came back home and set up for my get together. Bill and Steph showed up first, we hung out and drank a few beers, I played some drums and showed them some videos of mine. Then about two hours later, Elvis showed up with Rene, Dulce, and Arnold... so we all hung out and stuff, then we decided to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the old one. Somewhere torwards the end, Lauren showed up, the last guest on the list. So she met everyone, and we watched the rest of the movie. Afterwards we all chatted and stuff, Elvis and them left cuz Dulce had to be at work early, so we took pics... then Bill and Steph left, and me and Lauren hung out for a little bit, we plan on hanging out again soon =) probably The 17th *Monday*.

So Saturday wasn't much, I worked 5-11:30, first time I worked a Saturday night, but it was fun, didn't do much after that.

So yeah, Bill was supposed to come over Sunday with Eric, the possible guitarist for our band, the day after, and well... he said he would be at my house around 6-7, so I waited and waited, I didn't hear from him. So I assumed he wasn't coming, I smoked some pot. So around 9:15ded to make some food. As I'm boiling macaroni, *ding dong* the door bell rings, it's Bill... he asked if it was too late to play, at first I said yes. But, I felt bad cuz they all came to see me play, so I figured a few songs wouldn't hurt. So I tried my best even though I was still high. Next thing I know, the smoke alarm goes off... oh shit, I forgot about my food... so I run upstairs, and all of the water had evaporated and the shells were beginning to burn in the pot. So I dumped it and went back downstairs, I told Bill that it was getting way late and that we shouldn't play anymore, so they left. Later on I talked to Bill on line when I was at Elvis' house on his computer, apparently everyone who was at my house knew I was high, I dissapointed Bill, especially because my drumming sucked. I feel kinda shitty about that, even though it's not entirely my fault, he said he was gonna show up and he didn't until late, I didn't have to play at all, but I did because I felt bad that they all came to see me play. Me and him will have to talk when I get my internet back.

Nothing exciting happened in the beginning of the week... I worked Tuesday morning 10:45-5. Weds was another day off, Elvis wanted to see The Matrix: Revolutions, so he picked me up, we picked everyone else up and went to 3 theatres, ALL SOLD OUT. So we went back home, I got home, worked the Thursday morning, and Elvis txted my cell just as I got home around 5:30 ""I'm coming to pick you up now"". So we left, he dropped me off at his house while he went on a date, so I chatted on line for a little bit and waited. Finally he picked me up from his house, we picked everyone up and finally saw the movie. It was good, I liked it, kinda glad I saw the first two now that I understand them more.

Today *Friday* was just boring... got SOME stuff done. I cashed my check, bought some smokes for the week and that's about it... not really tired and it's passed 5am, which sucks cuz I'm working 10:45-5 tomorrow, and THEN afterwards, I'm helping to get things organized for the new store, because we're moving over to the store next to us, which is like over two times bigger than where we are now.

Some other stuff has been going on as well... I can't really remember what days some things happened the week of Halloween, but I remember Elvis came over and we watched The Matrix, then a couple days later we watched Animatrix and Matrix: Reloaded, because he was gonna take me to see Matrix: Revolutions with him. I met this guy Tim almost 2 weeks ago, he was really nice, I liked him, but after he dropped me home, he started asking me out and I declined, because I can't just jump into a relationship with someone I just met, I learned that the hard way with a lot of people, especially ""Jammy James"". And Ed has been a dick to me, apparently he met some guy off the internet and all of a sudden they're boyfriends and now he's too busy for me or something. I haven't heard from him since before I lost my internet, he said we needed to ""sit down and talk"" this week, because it was his vacation, but that didn't happen. But I have been spending more time with Elvis, and that's good because I kinda missed him for a while, I dunno how often we'll see each other now, but I'm glad I've seen him as much as I have lately.

So tomorrow/today, I'm working 10:45-5, then I'll be working til 11 helping them prepare for the new store... I'll get paid cash up front for that, so that'll be good, I've decided to split all my money into thirds... one third for savings, one third for week one, and one third for week two, since I get paid every other week. I might also ask for more hours too, cuz I really like the job and it's not like my schedule is busy as hell anymore. SO we'll see... other than that I'm looking forward to the phone being turned back on, hopefully Monday or Tuesday the latest.

So basically, the job is great, I love it, I'd work there more if I could. Things with men suck, because men suck and that's all I have to say about that. And the band is progressing even though there's some minor flaws right now because of the events the other night.

Whenever it gets turned on I'll be posting this on my journal."

"event","So yeah... uhm... lately things have just been wild I guess... bois, work, Halloween... etc... I guess I'll get into one thing at a time...

First I guess there's the whole Ed situation... he's been ""busy"" or whatever, he decided to tell me the other night that he has a boyfriend and shit. That kinda hurt and bothered me, I actually cried, which sucked. I was beginning to crush on him too... bleh... he said we need to ""sit down and talk"" sometime, yeah, right... whenever his boyfriend allows him to have some free time.

I met this guy Tim, Sunday night... I stayed at his place til Tuesday night, he's a really nice guy, I enjoyed hanging out with him and whatever, but like, he likes me a little more than I like him, he asked me to be his boyfriend, and I said that I couldn't just jump into a relationship with someone I just met, because I learned from the past that it doesn't work out like that.

Work's been good... unfortunantly there was a schedule change last weekend, they called my house Monday but I wasn't here. They wanted me to come in Tuesday morning, but I wouldn't be home til Tuesday night, so, I couldn't go... they called me tonight and someone needs to be covered Saturday night. So I'm gonna see if Bobbi Jo can cover, if not, I guess I will, but I think she'll do it.

Elvis is coming over soon, we're gonna watch The Matrix... oh lordy hand me a gun while I can save myself haha j/k I saw the first 20 minutesof that movie a few years back and it didn't interest me at all really. He's dragging me to see the third one when it comes out in the movies... anyone have any valium they can lend me? =P

And tomorrow's the big day... Halloween!! I'm throwing a nice little get together, some drinking, music, movies, and other ""festivities"" ;-) it should be fun, it won't be til later at night around 6-7... but it should be fun ;-)

Other than that things have been alright I guess... not much else to say on this side... everyone go cause mischief and I'll uipdate again soon! =P"

"event","So I saw the movie, and I have to say it was amazing... it was nothing like the original except for the fact that it was 5 teenagers driving down a deserted road... I don't want to give anything away, but the movie had me jumping A LOT... and for any movie to get me to jump once or twice, is good, so this movie was really good. The movie also wasn't based on blood and gore, while it had it's bloody moments, it was more based on suspense...

Anyway, I also got my Friday the 13th Part 3 Jason statue... it's awesome...

So yea, other than that stuff, nothing going on here... just very bored and very cold... Ed might come over, but that won't be til later tonight probably... I work tomorrow and Weds 10:45-3, and then Saturday 10:45-5... yee fucking haw hehehe"

"event","So yeah... last night was quite interesting... but I'll get into that later...

Work's been good, I like it, no pressure at all... it's very laid back, just the kind of job I need. It's quite simple too, so that's good, once I get familiar with the place, I can ask for more hours if I want them, but I guess I'll see what my hours are like every week and take it from there. I still have to learn the register and shit... so that's about it on the job front.

I hung out with Ed on Weds night, it was fun... we went out to a few stores, he was nice enough to buy some food for the house, cuz mom got fired from her job... though, she's starting a new one today *another cab company*. I really don't think she should be doing this cab shit, but that's just my opinion...

Been playing a lot of drums too, it's been fun, tho the tip on one of my chrome drum sticks broke, I need to get that fixed soon ;)

Ed and I went to Vintage Vinyl the other night, I was dilly dallying around the store and as I'm looking through used DVD's, out of the corner of my eye, I see a box with a big hockey mask image on the front. So I walked up to it and opened the front flap... it turned out to be this Friday the 13th Jason doll thing... I've seen it on the official web site before, but it was sold out! So yeah, I can't get it now, but Ed's going to buy it for me, and I'm gonna pay him back when I get my first pay check.

Other than that, nothing else really happened... except uhm... yeah... I got plastered drunk last night, now, I am a light weight, but, I didn't eat at all yesterday, I think the only thing I ate was a candy bar lol. So yeah, 5 beers and I got very drunk, very fast. I ended up streaking down my block, for those of you who don't know what that is... I ran down my street butt ass naked haha... I don't remember much of it, but I remember bits and peices... the shitty part was that when I tried to pass out, the room was spinning... and that led to me throwing up, 3 times, which sucked... so I'm never gonna get drunk like that ever again...

Tonight should be fun... I'm going to the movies to see Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Ed's bringing me, and his friend Warren and maybe Eric is coming, Janine and Fallon might meet up with us, as well as Elvis, Rene, Dulce, and Arnold... so we'll see ;)"

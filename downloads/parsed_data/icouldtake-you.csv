Dan is looking through old pictures. Patch Addams is on. Victor came over this morning for a little. I want to go to a water park soon. Everyone should come
especially    T I M   B A R N U M (come home tim!)

we did something sort of illegal last night out of boredom.. heh

For my sister's graduation present.. my mom..sister and I are going to Europe. My sister didnt get to come to the wedding in may because of APs. We're flying into Ireland then going to London and Paris. 10 days away.. to return the absence of the boy my entire summer has been revolving around. 
what a tear jerker.

I want to make a movie but the video camera needs to charge.


a few weeks ago i went on a family vacation for the first time in 6 years to bethany beach in delaware for a week. Very fun.. only it wasn't with my family. hah



This summer has been amazing

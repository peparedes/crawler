i got hammered last night and went to a party where i ran into my neighbors and told a boy i was proud of him as  he was trying to convince a bunch of straightees that was gay. alex and i built a fort. i have a booboo on both thumbs. i need to go out and bike in the rain...i wish it was warm and raining, those days that make you want to splash around naked.
i wish i was in the ocean right now, or a lake. alex and i swam across a lake and back, i really like swimming.
wow, my thoughts are all over the place, maybe this isn't a good time to be doing this, i need to get outta here.
peace out you.
my new neighbor told me i was hot, then followed it up with, we're gonna go do bongs."

"event","my greatest fear when i was little was cookie monster banging on my screen in the middle of the night while screaming....fucking scary as shit.
some asshole just set off a firework outside my window and startled me so bad i thought i was dying.

current fears:
a plane crashing into my building (a house in my hometown just got destroyed because a plane crashed into it)
heart attack
crazy people in the woods
being entirely alone with no one else in the world
cookie monster banging on my window--or anyone for that matter (especially cuz i live on the 4th floor)
losing my rational thought completely
that i will kill someone accidentally


i think i am most afraid of going insane completely. because if/when it happens, it wont be the quirky funny insane that they portray on tv...it will be violent and paranoid and painful..............

bleh! i cant think about this shit or else i will dream that it happens.
i need to masterbate and clear my thoughts.

and although i only got 3 hours of sleep last night, i still am not tired. while i was sleeping, i was talking to myself in my head, working things out the way that i normally do; i told myself, you know how i feel, i feel like i just drank an enormous smoothie, and thats the way i have felt all day. at some times nauseous, at most times energized, but always with these fucking allergies.
my head is so congested and my nose and my eyes burn. and i havven't eaten enough today or drank enough water but i just cant get in the mood.
i want a keeper.
let me bitch some more.
i also want an ipod.
my brother has better toys than me.
i hate it when old friends who i really respect sell me out to new friends who are totally lame and just rich hipsters who don't know dick about life. i'm serious, she keeps blowing me off and it sucks. but oh well, it won't last, i know that we will, but they wont.

"event","you know, i really love whiskey. most alcohol in general, being that i was raised by loving alcoholics; but cheap whiskey is really terrible stuff. its worse thaan cheap beer.

so, down to business:
i spoke to the boy i am going to marry today. i'm serious, we decided when we were 6,
and i never go back on my word.
hes into frisbee golf--what the fuck is this? you might ask... i'll tell you what, its
simply a product of the midwest, that is just like golf, except with a frisbee.
anyway, we're going to see eachother this summer and i'm super psyched cuz we havent 
seen-or even spoken-to eachother in like 4 years, and i think we are the same person, only
different gendered, and he plays golf with a frisbee while i sit around and whack off.
cool.
fuck buddys are overrated, theres no suspense or chemistry. i wish i had the balls to start
sleeping with the person i really want to be with.
i'm currently involved in a love affair with myself, and i just don't have the time or 
the energy for juggling two people at once.
the human imagination is underrated, way underrated. i think that instead of trying to clean
out your head, like people are always trying to do through meditation and expensive therapy 
and organized religion, people should just retreat more inside their minds where all of their
wildest dreams can come true.
i'm serious, i just lived out one of my number one fantasies last night while lucid dreaming:
i was travelling in a tour bus for some rediculous amount of time--like, 33 hours--with about a dozen of the best sudicide girls, and all i had to kill time with--besides the company of those lovely ladies-was a coloring book and twist up crayons.
see? perfection.
damn, i'm gonna go space the fuck out and dream up something else just as good..."

i've had a bad day, but didn't realize it until someone said, hey,
you're having a bad day...
ha! maybe i'm just too fucking chill to notice.
maybe i should keep saying fuck.
ok, yeah, so my car was towed, which sucks cuz i don't have the money
for that shit, or the fucking money, i should say. tack it onto the 
debt i'm accumulating!! over 2 grand baby and going strong!
but now i'll have to explain to my mother why i couldn't use my tax return
money to pay for it because i got my nipples pierced instead! that'll
be fucking fun. fuck fuck fuck.
oh well, its humurous.
one time, i broke up with my boyfriend of over a year, killed my computer,
lost my shoes in the mud in 30 degree weather, got my period, shit my pants,
and a whole slew of other things that i have blocked out all in one week.
when things go wrong, it usually just makes me deliriously happy.
cause i'm s-s-s-slow and ch-ch-ch-chillll.
i almost broke my computer tonight cause i spilled a shit load of
whiskey next to it and it was fucked up for a good 60 minutes, and i
was freaking the fuck out.
but now its fine...oh,and for no reason, the 2 button popped off-it made me laugh.
and for some reason i thought that wedging the control button up would help,
but it didn't and now its stuck all crooked and sticking up..hahahahha
i got laid and it was godd. ha! no, good, it was good. my neighbors hate me and my 
laugh.
i hate cilantro....seriously, i fuckin hate it.

"event","hold on, i need to prerequisite this with the fact that i am drunk, so behold, the drunken schneiterdome:
everything here is beautiful.
the schneiterdome is how we refer to my house because it is the party spot. i am here now, my parents are in new orleans partying it up at the blues and jazz festival, and i am here with christine. i love it here. it is so beautifully chill. anytype of lifestyle is welcome. christine is talking to the first person she has ever been in love with who is an older male trying to kick the crack habit. but that is the beauty of my life, there are no judgements. i know that he makes her happy. 
i cannot even begin to speak of the epiphanies, memories. drunken beauty, and knowledge that has aquired here in my home, nor can i ever even begin to discuss the beauty present here. 
everyone is accepted, no matter what their reputation, no matter anything, they are accepted in the schneiterdome regardless of their history. heroin and crack addicts alike, graduates of upscale prestigous schools, kids who have grown in the ghetto, kids who have grown with a silver spoon in their mouth; everyone.
everyone is accepted here without any backstory at all. this is the most beautiful spot in the world.
i have watched heroin addicts grow into responsible adults, mental hospital patients mature and cure themselves, teenage angst be embraced and grown out of, promiscuous girls turn over another leaf....all inside this house of understanding.
it is a beautiful thing, and i owe it all to my parents who are in new orleans right now for the blues and jazz festival because music is what raised me, ,music is what i think of when i think of my parents and that is beautiful.
this house is blessed, this family is blessed, in whatever sense of that word is possible in a home of atheists, but we are truely the beauty here.
there is somehting magical in the schneiterdome, something to keep the youngsters coming back in search of refuge. 
i only hope to be as incredibly accepting and loving of everyone as my parents have been.
peace and love."

"event","i wish i could remember.
maybe i don't.
i search the written documents on my computer
and find things that i have typed that i have
no recollection of even thinking. my mind is a 
maze that twists and turns with every lost 
memory refound and i am lost inside, searching
for the common thread between all of these 
things that i find later on once i can no 
longer remember their existence.
i don't know myself very well, and i surprise 
myself everyday.
not having a memory makes me able to look upon
both the past and the future very objectively.
although it causes great disassociation which
only makes me retreat into my mind even more...
but i guess thats ok, because the world can be
anything you want inside your mind.

half way through this entry i was busy with something
else, and i had a vivid memory involving my ex-girl
and its so incredible when a memory presents itself in 
full.  where i felt what i felt in the time span it took
me to smear blue paint over her orange painting both 
physically and emotionally, and i relived it completely.
and then it was gone within seconds, leaving behind the 
shell of a beautiful moment that i once experienced in the 
flesh to decay on the backburner of my mind.

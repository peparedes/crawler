i loved working with the pledges
i loved meeting all of them and making them my good friends
i needed miss firecracker because it made me happy to go to everynight and play such a funny character 
i was thrilled to be apart of govt Inspector because the company was soo amazing and it pushed me everyday
i had barely anytime to breathe
i was pushed to open up more
i broke down 
i showed some emotions to people that i didnt think i could
i transformed my outward self and shocked people 
i had a great road trip
i had one of the happiest nights in 2 years
i was confused
i was nervous
i let down others
i was let down
i felt unworthy
i was happy.

"event","i woke up with turning over a new leaf on the mind. wow today was unreal! literally unreal. the craziest things happened. the whole day was not an everyday day. did a lot of crying which i rarely do. fought. but i also did somthing today that was awesome for me. after escaping the madness. i went straight home to get my Bible and went to the catholic church here on campus.(im a wanna be catholic hehe)  i went there because the sanctuary is very intimate and i love to kneel. i was broken. i was truely broken before God. its the first time ive been completely broken in almost 1 1/2 years. i realized this week why i havent been 100% content and that is because God hasnt been the complete soul center of mylife in a while. its almost been impossible to focus. i stayed there in the church and just talked to God for an hour. about everything. praying for guidance. praying for my friends family and everything else i care about. asking for forgiveness. asking for him to take the reigns completely because hes a much better navigator for my life than i am. it was amazing for me. its what i need to be completely content. once that is straight then everything else falls into place for me. it looks like it will be somthin that i do often. to escape. it was what i needed today and everyday. 

its always unreal to me when God shares with me certain passages from the Bible they usually always are appropriate for how im feeling. the first one he showed me today was 
Psalm 147:1-6 ""Praise the Lord! For it good to sing Praises to our God. For it is pleasant and praise is beautiful. The Lord builds up Jerusalem; he gathers together the outcasts of Israel. HE HEALS THE BROKENHEARTED. AND BINDS UP THEIR WOUNDS. He counts the number of the stars; he calls them all by name. Great is our Lord and mighty in power; HIS UNDERSTANDING IS INFINITE. the Lord lifts up the humble; He casts the wicked down to the ground."" 

this says to me that God is sooo powerful that ive gotta stop underestimating  him and just trust a billion percent. and that he can fix all. and even though i have failed him many times and wonder how he could possibly still love me as much- i know ""his understanding is infinite"" 

im at peace knowing this. 

""Therefore for do not worry, saying what shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or what shall we wear? For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and this righteousness and all thes things shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tommorrow, for tomrw will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."" Matthew 6:31-34"

 i move back tomrw, im all ready and excited about living with jessie. and at the same time im really sad about moving back. because of my friends and people ive met this summer. i met a boy that has helped me learn what i want in a future boyfriend and husband. hes amazing.

-drove back and my mom wanted to spend a lot of money on me so that was fun. and then i went to see Damn Yankees with jm and michael and his momma (shes so sweet). jeff was sooo awesome i was soo proud to tell all my summerfest friends that he goes to my school. he was soo great and sooo was sara carroll! i couldnt keep my eyes off of her! i really liked the show. 
-good weekend!
-today me and my friends snuck out of church to go watch my super sweet sixteen the movie! we got caught leaving by lauras dad who came after us to scare and to see where we were going. we just laughed and laughed and laughed! we couldnt say we were going to watch that stupid movie. and for those of u that know me u know how embarrassingly obsessed with that show i am and the movie was the stupidest movie ive ever seen. for real. i guess i shoudnt have expected so much from a movie that has its premeire at 12 on a sunday.

"event","live in the moment today. enjoy every second. this is the last time i will be playing this particular role with these particular people with this crew on this stage with these costumes and props. these moments will be gone soon. sooo i have to live in them to the fullest. im in love with this show....i always have been since the second i started researching it and listening to the music. it has my heart. everyday i have seen somthin that i love more and more. the bearded lady is very complex also. she has soo many layers. i just have loved putting in time and thought into this character. and she dies today. theatre is soo awesome and beautiful. it is ephemeral. i cant wait to see what the next character i play will be. peace out. good bye we will miss u. GOOOD BYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEE! 

p.s. I HATE STRIKE WITH THE BIGGEST PASSION!!!!!! ( its the main reason im sad the show is over!) hehe"

BUT just the perfect length i think. if it had been longer i think things would have started to get rocky..hehe....or extremely boring. this semester is going to start looking way up....seriously. i feel positive about this. we've all just gotta start living in each moment and being thankful.....ive always tried to live by that.....but my grandmother has reinstated that this break. their are alwys people out there that have it way worse than u. so get a smile on ur face and count ur blessings. happy st patties day!!!"

hahah things do get sooo complicated......its wierd to think about things in the grand scheme of our life....... a lot things seem soo small in that sense. why do we get sooo stressed about the small stuff.....it kinda makes u laugh when u think about it. is this really gonna matter in 5 years from now.....or even a month from  now? haha i love living. i love friends. ill miss yall over the break......holla things are looking way up by the way...."

"event","do i not know the proper way to grieve? its so odd to me that everything hit me this morning. i just broke down. i thought about how awful of a semester this has been. and i dont understand why all the bad stuff has to be all at once. cant it be spread around a bit? im use to being soo genuinely happy with everything. and right now im not. i mean when my mind is off of stuff i am. also being BORRRED could have somthing to do with not being as happy. this semester is just kinda lame. Maybe i need to talk about things more. i know i havent been praying as much as i need to. praying is powerful. when i keep myself busy i dont have time to think about stuff and lately i havent had as much to do soo ive had time to think and i dont like it.....even though that is kind unhealthy. look up please life look up."

"event","most emotional day of my life. its hard cause when im in bham everything is actually real. she passed away late friday night. the visitation was tonight. u have noooo idea how thankful i am that i got to tell her everything i wanted to. it wierd how im grieving. its good to have these days at home to grieve properly because when im in ttown my mind is in 20 billion places so im distracted and i dont think about it often..........like im forced to do here. all i can have is faith. faith that she is looking over me this very instant. its really important to me. i recorded a song for the funeral....last week. and they are gonna play it. that way i dont have to worry if i can make it through the song. ive sung at A LOT of funerals....dont ask me why. but even if i dont even know the person its still hard to make it through. i cant imagine making it through for someone that is sooooo important to me. im sooo sick on top of everything. i dont know how it happened. just been a sucky semester soo far. pleaazzzzzz get better!!"

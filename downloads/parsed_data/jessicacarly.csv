"event","here is a strange phenomenon: 
my southern pride has grown eighteenfold since my arrival in the midwest. 

never had i been told i have a drawl. 
never had i realized how much i really do love grits and sweet tea.
never had i been driven out of my damn mind because people actually use the words SODA POP. 
never had i bragged about being a keeneland fan.
never had i been so hardcore about country music.

but now:
people can't understand me when i use long vowel sounds sometimes. the other day i was talking to my advisor and he asked how many credit hours i had coming in and i kept telling him nine and he said, ""none? no, you had some coming in, i can see it here in your file!"" nine.
<b>nine.</b>
my spanish teacher, whose name is elsa and who is from cuba, also has difficulty understanding me. she calls me yessy, by the way.
i am sad because no one appreciates waffle house with the fond family-like bond that we in the group do. waffle house was like our living room for the past year, and now i feel like i live in a cardboard box because instead of grits and sweet tea i am resigned to oatmeal and black coffee. now don't get me wrong, i love my black coffee and i suppose sweet and low is an option... but let's face it. it's not really an option at all. 
soda pop? what the hell. i don't even want to talk about it. COKE. 
horse racing is the prettiest thing in the world and i think it's weird that some people have never seen it. i'm going to have a derby soiree here come may. 
and every time i go in our community bathroom, i turn the radio to country music... much to the chagrin of some too-cool st. louisans who sometimes huff and puff but hey sister, you're in the shower so you can mumble something about ""from the lou and i'm proud"" but right now we're going to listen to willie nelson so be quiet.

all is well in the beautiful sooner state, where our motto is ""labor conquers all things"" (that's always been my theory. that's what i always say. i'm always saying, ""listen, guys, labor conquers all things. ALL things. we just need to work harder! i'm all for hard work. come on, guys, let's be dilligent."" don't you remember me always saying that?) and our state fish is the white or sand bass.

the only way that i could be happier would be if more of the folks i love were here. this means you, in all likelihood! i am having an amazing time. there are so many excellent people, all very talented, most very interesting. sometimes something random will happen and i will think, ""hmm, elly would really enjoy this,"" or ""bockie would appreciate that,"" or ""i know some girls who could totally pull off a better drunkdial than that,"" or ""that car ain't got nothing on a certain candy cane i know and love."" i am in a sorority. that's mostly good. the parts i like, i participate in; the parts i think are silly, i do not. i have a best friend. her name is katie. she reminds me of bock. she is amazing amazing amazing. she and chase flirt back and forth with each other which is funny. katie has a boyfriend. his name is robert but i call him bob. he made a thirty-six on his ACT and is great. i have lots of other friends too. my classes (spanish english politics&film oldtestament honors) are hard. but i like them. 

i will update more elaborately sometime soon. 
right now i think i am going to go see elizabethtown.

i didn't realize how kentucky i was until i left. that's sort of funny sometimes. lots of times people cannot understand my accent.

"event","so yesterday i was matriculated and i recited the student pledge and put on my student pin and now i guess i'm an official tulsan! so here i am. 

i moved everything in on sunday, which we didn't know was an option... mom and dad and i just decided to come on campus and look around a bit, and all these people were moving in, not just RA's. so we asked and they were like yeah, it's just for out-of-staters. which i am! so i moved all my stuff here day before yesterday and made several target runs (have i mentioned how excited i am that krispie kreme and target are both within five minutes from here?) and unpacked and arranged and rearranged and hooked things up yesterday.

things i do not know how to hook up:
speakers to laptop
clock (setting thereof)
telephone

things i am not sure how to approach: 
changing clothes in my room (as many of you know, i have no problems changing clothes in front of anyone; however, my roommate is slightly more modest than i and gets in her closet and closes the door to change clothes. there is no way in hell that i will do that. other than being claustrophobic, it is just weird)
using the bathroom when people are brushing their teeth two yards from you

i left my cellphone in mom and dad's car. mom and dad are somewhere on the interstate. a familiar voice before bed would have been nice last night, but c'est la vie. anyway, that is the explanation for why i did not answer if you tried to call me. that and the fact that i rarely answer, but i really would have yesterday! really. 

several girls on my hall are really fun, nice people... we stood around and talked for a while last night. and my orientation group is pretty okay. last night after the dorm meeting they showed napoleon dynamite in the lobby, so of course, only the finest people stayed for that (read: about 20 out of 120), and that was neat. i talked to my friend from arkanasas who i met earlier this summer. i don't think my roommate really likes me, but maybe i'll grow on her? i haven't seen her smile yet. but i'm not really worried about that... she's live-withable, so that's good. 

i woke up in the middle of the night last night and i was thinking: i can just get up and leave if i want. it's three in the morning, and i can go to target and buy flipflops, or i can go get some cream-filled sprinkled krispie kremes, or i can get hopelessly lost trying to navigate a metropolitan area that i'm almost completely unfamiliar with, or i can drive in circles around campus (which is probably what would end up happening if i tried that navigating option). and no one would be like hey, you can't do that, it's three in the morning. i thought this was interesting, a little scary, and liberating to some degree. i stayed in bed though.

i really wish i could fast-forward to rush weekend! i'm not looking forward to rush itself as much as i am the pledge thing afterwards. 

i just took some dormroom pictures to post but unfortunately, i can't find my usb cable at the moment, so i'll get back to you on that.

i love you all very much!"

"event","in tulsa as of one o'clock this morning. the plan was to split it up between today and tomorrow, but dad and i both just felt like driving, and so we did. and so we're here. 

i am in my pajamas in the hotel lobby on the little amerisuites computer. our room has a roof leak. 

nothing really eventful happened yesterday, other than the leaving home thing. granny came over. chase came over. granny cried. chase did not. abby told me that everything would be alright if i just stay gone, which i think is a montgomery gentry reference but could be original abby harvey prose. she is going to come visit me on her fall break in all likelihood! so that's exciting.

abby called and woke me up to say that hazel had a good night.
that was annoying. and not exciting at all. 

it's raining in tulsa. there is probably a country song from the seventies about that. we're going to walk around downtown and by the river (speaking of rivers, we crossed the mississippi so all the radio stations are k instead of w. including one advertising southern baptist gospel hour which was KOKS. irony?) and GO TO TARGET. and it's supposed to rain tomorrow for the big move-in, which is no good at all really, but oh well. 

so, yes. i am in tulsa.

calling me at work, but not if you're going to do some kind of mischievous prank wherein you try to trick me by telling me that you got in a fistfight with your neighbor over his ex-wife's coon-hunting dog, pickup truck, et al. that won't do at all.

last night for my big going away thing some of the fellows at work took me to the range and taught me how to shoot guns.
this was awesome.
i'm actually a pretty good shot! better than some of the bailiffs. and i'm cross-dominant, which is apparently weird: dominant right hand, dominant left eye. so i had to shoot left handed. but do you know what exactly i shot? pistolrevolverrifleshotgun and then an MP FIVE. amazing. and i did not come home crippled, surprisingly enough.
playing with machine guns is very gratifying to my control-freak self. doesn't get much more controlling than that."

sweet potatoes sometimes if they have lots of whipped cream.

but i hate carrots more than anything. raw carrots snap in your mouth like you're crunching on pinky bones or something. steamed carrots are worse. the most horrific variation is baby food. there is a terrible picture of babyjessica with mushed-up carrots smashed all over her face, orange seeping out of this obnoxious, toothless grin. 

no daughter of mine will ever, ever eat baby food carrots.

chase and i went to paducah to see a movie the other night. actually, we went twice. friday we went to see must love dogs, after which he became hysterically angry at me because it was such a girl movie and he wanted to see bad news bears. eh, whatever. anyway, on the night in question, we had gone to see mad hot ballroom and it was so good! i loved it. why does no movieplace around here have spellbound, by the way?! argh. anyway. irrelevant. relevant: on the night in question, we were coming home in my car and this huge, overwhelming smell of something very noxious and very strong and very horrible happens. it is happening out of my air conditioner, i think. 
me: what is that smell?
chase: i don't know. it smells great.
me: it smells like vodka.
chase: YES!
and it did! it smelled JUST LIKE VODKA. it was DISGUSTING. it gave me SPINECHILLS because it was SO STRONG. 
and it was there for about five seconds and then it went away. 
but it was five seconds of HELL!
it was the weirdest thing ever. i think my subconcious is guilt tripping me. or something. anyway. i'm taking my car to parkway chrysler tomorrow. maybe i will tell them this.

between orange and vodka and oatmeal, i write a lot about food. 
oranges and vodka and oatmeal would be a terrible meal. 
they would be a more terrible cocktail."

so i was driving and it was the most perfect, perfect time of the most perfect, perfect evening and the sunset looked just like this scarf my mom has, flashback to age six, and my sunroof was open and i was listening to this starbucks mix cd and singing and i kept almost having car disasters because i could not stop looking at this sunset and i had on a cardigan and it was just the best thing. it was a moment that needed a soundtrack.

i guess this doesn't go over well sometimes with the almighty Group? and people say things about ""oh, jessica > us"" and all that. but that's not really it at all. it's just different.
and i think it's good because a few years ago i was constantly needing to be surrounded by people, all the time. not even because i wanted to be, necessarily. it was like a security blanket, ""by golly, people like me"" thing. and now i'm okay without that. so! hooray for personal growth and other chicken soup-esque buzzwords.

"event","actually, i just posted a comment on ebeth's last entry, and i feel that it is important enough to warrant its own real livejournal post. here's version 2.0:

here's what i want to know:
what's wrong with a nice bowl of oatmeal?
no one eats oatmeal anymore, and i want to know why. i <b>demand</b> to know why. 

oatmeal is very healthy, i think. at least it seems that way. it comes in every flavor you could want if you are a reasonable person and don't want anything too extravagant. my personal favorite is peaches and cream, as served by ms. ester allen, who also contributed my funny nose and varicose veins and mosquito allergy, but that's another story. and margie lou, my other grandmother, mixed up oats with lots of butter and sugar and cinnamon every day for me in the years between mom going back to work and me starting kindergarten. ""oats stick to your ribs, jace.""

<i>and they will stick to yours, too!</i>

why do you doubt my grandmothers and the quacker oat man with the funny hat? they are all wonderful, god-fearing, christian people. and while my grandmothers are both known to be real firecrackers, the quaker man is even a pacifist. how can you deny such a peacemaker?

i urge you to reconsider your position on oats, misguided cereal eaters. cereal is lame. unless it is soggy, it hurts your sensitive mouth and teeth when you chomp on it. the crunch sounds weird when it echoes in your head. it often features weird cartoon characters on the box... like the smacks frog. has a more obnoxious creature ever been penned? <b>no.</b> take off your stupid baseball cap, frog, and join the man with the funny hat. and that goes for all of you! and includes dawson's weird mountain dew toboggan.

one day everyone should come over and i will dish out oatmeal to my friends. your bowls will runneth over with sweet, milky goodness. 

look, all i'm saying is this: i ate oatmeal as a child and look how i turned out. there's probably still hope for you, too, even though you're likely in late adolescence. every oat helps. that's all i'm saying.

DITCH THE CEREAL. EAT OATMEAL.

so i'm at work, and here is the problem (it is a very serious problem, one i am not joking about at all, despite obvious cult movie reference. and i'm doing a cut tag because i just learned how): <lj-cut text=""i have lost my stapler."">

maybe you don't understand. this was my favorite stapler. i adopted this stapler upon starting work here - that's a two and a half year partnership, longer than i've known some of you. well, i've known most of you for a good while, but that's longer than i've actually liked some of you. but i digress. 

when we had the oldschool tax system that demanded hard copies of all kinds of bureaucratic meaningless paperwork be staled to every bill, the stapler was there, making it through fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen on a good day pages. that's a lot of girth. (cue dycus ""twss"") 

when i was promoted from countergirl to desksitter, the stapler moved with me. and although the woman who forfieted her law enforcement position for a job at kohl's left her wedding pictures lined up on her desk and got irritated when i changed the desktop to a picture of tulsa instead of her kids in matching outfits (i changed it back and hoped she wouldn't be mad even though she's here like once every two weeks), my stapler was here on my desk, staking our claim, proving who the REAL desksitter in this joint was. 

i even wrote my initials on a piece of tape and stuck it on there to cement our bond. make things tangible. for a girl who goes weird around date three (there's a story there, but maybe not for the livejournal audience. suffice to say, last week i went weird again!), such a commitment is a big deal.

A BIG. DEAL.

it was indeed a swingline. 
the best stapler in the office. it jammed like twice in almost three years.
maybe when i find it i will paint it red. 
someone probably stole it because it's such a wonderful stapler. or to make me mad. it was probably that harrison kid.

if anyone is so inclined:

in reference to things mentioned in the last entry, with a cut tag for your friends page convenience:
<lj-cut text=""things that have happened""> 
<b>graduation</b>: it sort of seems like a really, really long time ago. things went well, relatively. i mean, we graduated! so that's good. i sat next to will collins and drew and jasmine during commencement, and will's commentary was stellar. i was really proud of george, who gave a really great valedictory. ricky's opening thing was very ricky, and shanna was adorable in her closing. i'm really glad she got to speak for student council. since no harvey family event can go 100% smoothly, my grandmother fell and broke her arm and messed up her elbow and got purplefaced coming into the gym, so she had to be ambulanced away and daddy had to go with her and neither one was there. that was pretty lame, since dad's sort of my kindred academic spirit at home and granny was in the hospital for about a month, all bruised up and surgery-needing. she just got her cast off though. but my grandfather from louisville and his lovely bride june did come down without telling anyone they were going to! that was neat, and sort of weird. he's so random, i love him. we were marching out after tassels were moved and caps were thrown and we were pompous and circumstantial, and i see this old guy standing in the opening thing and think hmmm, that guy looks like papaw. of course i'm crying and all that at that point. and i look again and hey, it is! crazy. anyway, i'm glad we graduated, and there's no one else i would rather have graduated with than you guys. elizabeth, mom still has your present but I NEVER SEE YOU so i CAN'T GIVE IT TO YOU so SEE ME SOMETIME. see also: bribery.
<b>post-graduation debauchery</b>: the ridge is sort of like marshall county's mt. olympus. i had a good time. 
<b>summer started</b>: full-time crime fighting. the occassional round of poolball. one horribly played match of mini-golf with richard, who is such an excellent guy even though i hate mini-golf more than anything in the world almost. lately, lots of time spent with dycus, elly, and lindsey, who are sort of a triple-threat when it comes to wit. i watched iron chef and was amazed. bockie and i cleaned my room and caught up on things, but then she went to chicago (congratulations, by the way, chicagokids!) and my room sort of got messy and we were outdated again. bock's the best. and girlnight was held at shanna's this week, minus elizabeth, and i had a better time than i had in a really long time. and i've been having lots of good times lately, so that says a lot! i love the girls.
<b>fourth of july</b>: i love the lake, so i had a really great time. i think some of my counterparts do not and did not, but it was such beautiful weather and everyone was there and we jetskiied and grilled and sat around and it was lovely. and any weekend is an open invitation pretty much for anyone who wants to do lake stuff - just let me know. really, do, because i don't like inviting all the time and making people feel obligated. anyway. fourth of july! guest appearance by ricky riley? that was random. and then the fireworks were rained out but we hung out at dawson's boat anyway (thanks dawson) and got pizza and sat around and were DRENCHING WET and then ricky came there too and was drunk and so i made him go outside with me so the moviewatchers could watch a movie. so we sang, a lot. it was the most memorable fourth of july ever. but i missed fireworks.
<b>I MISS MY SISTER BAD</B>: really! people say all that LYLAS! stuff all the time but no way. i did get a hilarious letter. and we went to visit saturday, and it was interesting to be an observer instead of a vampykid. i saw so many people i hadn't seen in forever! so many wonderful people. and colligan is so, so hot. surprisingly, so's andy kerman. this threw me off a little bit. abby: come home. now. things are interesting with mom and dad since abby's gone. a little tense sometimes, but i love them and am convinced that i have the best parents in the world, really and truly. we watched real world austin and ate blizzards last night. it's hip to be a harvey.
<b>i got a new car</b>: liberty+sunroof. love it. thanks dad.
<b>i learned how to play poker</b> ...and subsequently lost to some thirteen year-old blond kid! but for a while there, i was on a winning streak. actually it was just two hands, but still.
<b>thirty-one days until college</b> i think, but i'm not so great at counting because i don't think it was seven days ago when i said it was thirty-eight. i don't know. i'm really looking forward to it, though, but it seems like much farther away than a month. have i said that already? i've been saying that since december, but it still does. i'm thinking this is a bad sign. i'm now a facebook addict... where are all the marshall county grads on that?! it's really a neat thing and very addictive and probably 40% of the time written on my paysheet is actually spent clicking around on facebook. GET ON IT. AND BEFRIEND ME. BY GOLLY.

</lj-cut>
i'm on a big documentary kick. i've had a spellbound craving lately! and i went to watch the much-anticipated enron movie at maiden alley with chase and it was sort of interesting at first but turns out two hours of enron is just too much. i love chase a lot when he's not horrible. the soundtrack was funny. the website says all kinds of neat documentaries (ballroom dancing children, professional bowlers, some guy who likes birds?) are coming up. i hope they're within the next thirty-one days.

and this afternoon, i am driving to elizabethtown to meet priya and sneha to go to pagina's house in louisville to see my vampy girls! i'm anxious to see everyone again... it's been three years since all eight of us have been together! three years is a long time. they're so beautiful and talented and really, really fun... it should be a stellar weekend. some of you guys probably know chelsea sort of from tsa... she's national secretary, blond, gorgeous. i haven't seen her, or sarah, or callie since vampy! i'll probably end up in south carolina trying to get to elizabethtown though. oh mapquest, don't fail me now. 

so: things are good. 
really! they are. 
this summer isn't what i expected it to be, but it's going so well that i pretty much have no complaints.
and sometimes i get sappy and homesick before i've even left, but a lot of the time, it feels like it's time for college. not an ""OH THANK GOD I'VE GOT TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS HOUSE"" thing, although that happens upon occassion. but it just feels like it's time for that. 
so things are good.

and that harrison kid i hate that always falls asleep at his desk up here was just awakened by the sound of tazers two inches from his face. he screamed. i hate him. 

things are good."

i'm still going to cop out and just post the elizabethsurvey. but i promise an actual update will come by WEDNESDAY.

<lj-cut text=""for ebeth.""> 
[Current Clothes ] running shorts, i heart mchs shirt. from bockie's big night at the regional tournament. and then we all went to the apple and had a wonderful time. i think i was mad at chase that night? but i do love the apple. hey speaking of murray does anyone want to go see a midsummer night's dream this weekend? 
[ Current Mood ] anticipating.
[ Current Music ] jeff buckley
[ Current Taste ] as part of the pre-sleep ritual, i just listerined. whereas the average american woman settles for mediocrity and swishes for thirty seconds, i go for forty-five. be impressed.

[ Current Hair ] half-hearted ponytail+headband.
[ Current Annoyance ] the illiad lurks over me from my bookshelf as i sleep . i have not yet started it. it is as thick as my bible. but i did finish mythology today! i liked the stuff about the nordic folks, but that started on page 315 out of 330. and the class is greek history & philosophy, so probably not too much nordic. c'est la vie.
[ Current Smell ] when you listerine for forty-five seconds, the smell tends to hang around for a little bit. it's sort of like horseradish.
[ Current Favorite Artist ] willie nelson has sung me to sleep for the past four nights.

[ Current Favorite Group ] wilco. a ghost is born is album of the week.

[ Organized ] i keep trying! new years resolution since 1997.

[ Slap ] adam dawson if he's reading this, because he needs to be in bed recovering from his big surgery. if i did actually slap him, though, i would immediately feel horrible and bring him some chocolate pudding which he would be able to eat very easily despite his oral impairment.
[ Get Really Wasted With ] i drink alone. not really, but that would probably be the best thing.
[ Get High With ] eh why bother.
[ Look Like ] i like my freckles and my figure and my feet. but i think my sister is lovely.

[ Talk To Online ] msn is so high school. facebook is totally the new msn.

[in the morning i am] a terrible person, not at all worth spending time with, completely wretched. talk to me at ten.
[all i need is] random road trips, a good hammock, obnoxious singalongs, religious conversation, and the folks i live with.
[love is] friends that are pretty much family.
[im afraid of] coming home on christmas break and having everyone be different. or coming home on christmas break and having everyone be the same. also, i still haven't mastered getting home from downtown paducah. i ended up in metropolis last weekend. all of these, frightening things.
[i dream about] big things. learning so much wonderful stuff. the list doesn't really change, it just expands. and having babies will be the coolest. my kids will be the neatest individuals ever.

i don't get what people who aren't us do. this sounds superficial and cliquey and i don't mean it that way. but i can't imagine anybody else being this dysfunctional and quirky and close and constant, and i can't imagine what i would do without it. do other people invent weird aquatic games with obvious names? is movienight commentary so hysterical anywhere else? is there a hillary or an elly or a dycus in every group? 

i kind of think we've crossed the line from an oversized group of really good friends into some sort of odd extended family, complete with obnoxious baby cousins, a matriarchal great aunt who doesn't have to say much to convey her meaning, the eight-times removed crowd that pops out of the woodwork and leaves everyone scratching their heads, and one hell of a grumpy old man.  sometimes two.

"event","ten days until graduation. thank god. 
parts of this are a little weird: the fact that i feel like i'm fourteen a lot of the time, the unavoidable LAST EVERs (last tuesday without finals ever!, by the way), the way i look in the ridiculous cap and gown, the fact that ricky is giving the opening address at commencement. but mostly this is wonderful! because sometimes i feel like a grown-up, and i think the graduation stuff will actually be sort of fun, and this summer will be perfect. 

really.

between poolball and... well, whatever else it is we do, i can't really remember, but we will do things other than poolball and they will be great. and then we're college-bound. jeez. i'm supposed to register for classes now, and i'm having a hard time figuring out what i want to take when... if i did everything i wanted to do this coming semester, i would have nineteen hours. which is a little excessive: spanish, orientation, old testament as literature, holocaust, honors seminar, english, and anthropology. maybe save english for next semester? i think you can do that. is sixteen manageable? i have no idea.

anyway. graduation: does everyone do family stuff beforehand? dinner and whatnot? i guess that's kind of obligatory. i guess we'll have plenty of time for groupstuff later though. i like to make plans about things of that nature. anticipating is a big deal for me. so. i'm expecting great things out of whatever post-graduation parties, soirees, gettogethers, etc. come about. i think they should become a weekly thing, indefinitely. at least until august fifteenth. then i hear there's going to be a big harvey's gone party, according to the gentlemen, but that is negligable.

and i've been wondering what song i will listen to on the way there. i sort of ruin things like that by trying to plan them, so i'm not deciding and i don't even have leanings, and it's really not that big of a deal, but maybe that will be one of those things i'll remember in thirty years and i just don't want it to be candy shop or anything. maybe something wonderful and fated will come on npr. we'll see. this year has been so full of that kind of time-in-a-bottle moments, many of them involving cigars or sand or waffles. i think that's kind of important. 

i really can't tell you how much i am looking forward to summer.

friday night was so much fun. the gang congregated at THE RIDGE, as it is now known, and did basically nothing but there was a fire and marshmallows and cosmopolitan and dramatic readings thereof. my hair smelled like campfire all night long and i kept smiling whenever i would turn over when i was trying to sleep because i had such a great time. i wish i could remember what we did, though.

in sixth or seventh grade, ashlie lampkins had a slumber party and we made a time capsule with all the girls from benton on video talking about random things and we were supposed to watch it senior year sometime. i wonder where the video is. and i wonder what ashlie lampkins is doing next year. 

both dr. albertson and j.d. salinger beckon.
salinger, incidentally, is scattered admist my bedsheets. scandalous.

let's see:

spring break was wonderful.
the weather was perfect almost every day except for one day when it was TERRIBLE and rainy and windy and stormy and probably tornado warninged and hardcore. but if you're going to have bad weather, you might as well have terrible horrible no good very bad weather, right? so the waves were massive the next day.
i LOVE the waves. 
it was fun sharing beds with people and stealing pillows from them and whatnot. i'm now looking for an excuse to share a bed with someone in a strictly non-sexual way.
elizabeth is quite a woman and i love her so much! dumb bitch.
the rides down and back might have been more memorable than actual beachtime.
someone needs to post pictures. specifically the one of the almost-kerry man.
I LOVED SPRING BREAK. I LOVE THE BEACH. I LOVE EVERYONE WHO WENT. 

i'm definitely going to tulsa. have i said this? 
i can't wait.
let's graduate this week instead of next month. it'd probably be the best thing.

today i got pictures made and felt incredibly silly.

to the tsa crowd: hooray for having smart friends. i'm proud of you! i sort of hate computers but if you need a bellgirl or a suitcase carrier or a sandwich maker or whatever for when you go to chicago, sign me up. 

i wonder how prom will be.

last night was fun. i enjoyed sideways a lot and the company was impeccable. we have fun. it made me look forward to spring break. additionally, i really adore isabel, who i saw/embraced last night. and elizabeth, who i did neither with, but is usually in the company of isabel. they're delightfully brilliant girls and i think it's fun to exaggerate this concept of rivalry. boo-ya, etc.? thanks chase.

chronologically speaking:
friday was the best, involving books and cigars and cemeteries and really terrible music (i went for janis, we got luda or something?) and the whole bit. i would babble about it but i guess i just thought it was perfect is all. 

saturday was governor's cup, which was not perfect but worked out okay enough. peformed the annual ritual of listening to another one bites the dust on the way to christian fellowship* to get ready for gametime, since academic team is hardcore. the left brain types got first and second and third in math, which was neat. i sort of botched my written tests, which was unfortunate. redemption at regionals? we did really, really well in quick recall. but there were no non-relative-of-me-or-george-or-chase spectators as had been mentioned, so no one got lifted up on any shoulders or chanted for or anything. anyway, it was good to have all the three or four of us together, which had never happened except for once and murray beat us then and it ended in disaster and tears and gnashing of teeth. BUT we didn't lose at all yesterday. i think academic matches are rockinawesome.

last night i babysat and then witnessed several near-death experiences. i want to participate next time. i think it's funny how excited you fellows all were and i'm really glad you didn't cripple yourselves because then you would have really terrible times at prom. that was neat.

church.

garden state is a really neat delightful funny movie and the soundtrack was great and the ending sort of bothered me but the rest of the movie carried it and the shins, wow.

i think the spring break headcount is nearing twelve which will make for an interesting hybrid of animal house and the shining and gidget. i'm excited. i love the beach so much. relatedly, i applied to university of florida

sort of on a whim

for english we had to write thoughtful questions about lord of the flies and chase and i were talking about ours last night and we decided that one of them should be like a life appliation thing. as in, if our english class were trapped on a desert island and factions emgered and we started wearing facepaint and trying to kill each other, whose side would you be on? i thought that was interesting, especially given some of the personalities included in the bunch:

jessie's birthday!: I DIDN'T SCREW UP THE SURPRISE
IN FACT I DID A GREAT JOB IN LYING TO HER
AND I MADE A BLANKET
i think i am going to make everyone blankets. not that you're all consistently cold or anything, but i like to pretend that i have free time when in fact i have tons of college to do but fleece is fun and applications are not. i just applied to the university of florida, which is not something i had anticipated but it turns out that it's actually a really good school academically and will probably cost about as much as murray or less. i wrote my essay about teacher class. and today i made reservations for hotels and interviews and auditions at denison and wittenberg. anyway, blankets for all! maybe. unless adam dawson insults my job again.

actually i worked 52.25 hours this pay period. i took taxes from my favorite dawson (the girl one) today and have talked to momma stevenson about fifteen times in the past week. word to your mothers. i like my job a lot. EXCITING NEWS!: i get to go to inspector school in frankfort so i can check numbers on cars. then you can address me as inspector harvey. or the editordammit. or stonewall. whichever.

also i'm related to pocohontas. amazing.

usually i skip the god talk but.

church was very frustrating again tonight and i'm not sure what to do.  sometimes i know i just look for things to gripe about but some parts of it seem very irrelevant and sort of point-missing.  i don't know if it's selfish to ditch things like that when they stop being lucrative for you or not. i've done lots of reading about church and teenagers and whatnot in the last few weeks and it turns out that it's very likely that i am disillusioned and overly idealistic. anyway. if you have any extraordinary or at least well-intentioned wisdom to offer i would appreciate it greatly. 

somewhat relatedly, i watched what dreams may come the other night, which i hadn't seen since humanities at vampy, and it was really great and made me want heaven. even though the movie probably doesn't fly with the southern baptist powers that be and probably the bible itself, it was neat. lately i've been thinking about the heaven stuff, and how there are going to be a thousand perfect ways to worship which is so neat because that's the coolest stuff here, with art and relationships and writing and thinking and all the great stuff. and how overwhelming and amazing and sometimes kind of terrifying the concept of eternity is. 
sunday night studies on revelation, man. 
it's crazy.

we're going to have lots of fun on new years. 
i hope you have a list of resolutions. i, for one, am making the traditional harveyresolution which states: ""THIS YEAR, I WILL BE ORGANIZED."" but now i mean it! really. last semester of high school means it's sort of my last shot at it. i'm going to have the most file folders you've ever seen in your life. i have lots of other resolutions too but they're still being revised.

"event","so, november. 
the twentieth was absolutely wonderful. elizabeth and stacey came over and surprised me with the most amazing pancakes... apparently the secret is powdered sugar? and i got lillies and a jesus keychain and a very informative birthday card detailing date rape drugs. and then i went shopping with my mom and got a green peacoat, a cardigan, and other very in-character things. and then elly and willett came that evening and took me to hillary's where the gang had gathered and we had this great cake that said j-harv on it and then we smoked ashleycigars and went to maiden alley and comprised half of the audience of this annette bening movie and put up the armrests and loved on each other in the middle of it and talked a lot and elly made me crack up and it was the best night. 

thanksgiving was also wonderful, i thought! it was great to see my grandfather, who is eighty-three and hilarious and the person i am named after. then for the group soiree saturday i tried really quite hard to make gravy and green beans and dressing. the dressing and green beans weren't so great. the gravy was okay i guess but that consisted of pouring it out of a jar into a pan, but i lingered over it and wrung my hands and stirred it compulsively. i'm sort of culinarily impaired. and that night lots and lots of people (at one point twenty-six) came over and everyone brought something and richard's cherry pie was surprisingly good and i dealt a few hands of poker, which is my new fascination and chase and my dad talked a lot and we played battle of the sexes and dycus prayed, again and my lip bled because i was biting it so hard to try to keep from laughing during said prayer.

last week i was sick and concocted random over-the-counter drug cocktails so i had some weird side effects. self-medication is always an intersting experience. i had a sort of unfortunate conversation with my friend mr. white, who is stellar.

college deadlines are finished for a while. that's good. drew cordle makes me laugh. also good. i got to jessie's house EARLY on saturday morning. as in early in the morning and as in before my expected time of arrival. rockinawesome.

last night i had the weirdest dream. i was at some kind of self-improvement camp in a wooden cabin with bunkbeds because abby and i had been sentenced to go there for something. court-mandated camp. and zach brien was a counselor. and i think we tried to escape. and someone said you should go to church with coach bradley, and then someone else said no, he's a unitarian. i wonder if there is a unitarian church in paducah?

yesterday i ate chilli and watched football and family feud and slept. best sunday ever.
 
i need some mistletoe."

even sinatra can be emo if you're of a lame mindset. 

i hate birthdays. correction: i hate my birthday. everyone else's i love. i like celebrating other people's as long as they are good non-sucky people worthy of celebration, and that's most people in my book. every year my birthday always makes me exceedingly ridiculously sad. tyler (who i haven't talked to in too long, by the way) used to call it birthday blues. other folks might say schizophrenia or something. teenage angst? 

so i went to blockbuster and they still don't have any more sex and the city dvd's
and i had really wanted a carrie etc. night
and i bought a dozen doughnuts with plans to eat the disgusting number of approximately six of them this evening and take the eighth graders the other six tomorrow morning
but then i got sad and threw up 
and i wanted to watch you've got mail but my copy is missing in action so i watched my best friend's wedding instead and totally lost it because i kept drawing dumb parallels but decided that elly is probably my rupert everett type (hi baby), which i think is pretty accurate when he's not being a jerk 

speaking of elly in non-jerk mode, friday night was so much fun i thought! my car smells vaguely of cigars, which is sort of risky but very nicesmelling. eli: i'm pretty glad you were born. at least generally okay with it. i love you.

person of the moment: elizabeth who is always there on whinynights, is churching and waffling with me on sunday, and is fun to photoshop*.

what a whiny update. 

by photoshop, i mean copy and paste in paint because i don't actually know how to use photoshop."

if you are my friend, i'm proud of you. 

one of you specifically who is brilliant and hilarious and makes me feel wonderful on a regular basis. especially that one right now. 

but also if you:
can converse freely (using verbs, even) with spaniard folks, 
can teach five year-olds songs about trains or something with hella hella patience, 
can do weird things with computers and pictures and oranges and trent lovett, 
can keep my feet warm and appreciate good good music the way everyone should, 
are a precocious youth,
can get dumb school committees to rethink their policies, 
are consistently be dashing and charming and always exceptionally kind and catholic, 
are usually recognized for being able to do math in your sleep but could also do math in your sleep while basting a turkey and making eggrolls and coming up with some red velvet stuff, 
can rap about freshmen and jack and the beanstalk and knightly types,
can benchpress me,
or are commonly known for being quietly good at everything regardless of it's creative or mathish or whatever but can also (more importantly) dance like a crazywoman, 
or
can build both treehouses and computers, you are great. 

or if you're my sister. the whole genetics thing.

and that's not even everyone.

anyway. i was so proud of one of my comrades that i got to thinking how proud i am of all of them and i'm lucky to have you types around. me gusta.

"event","my democratic heart is still breaking for kerry and dr. dan. maybe especially dr. dan.
i think jim bunning is pretty terrible. even politics and issues and votes aside, he ran a superdirty campaign. gay rumors? calling him a limp wrist? come on. and refusing to debate at first and then not agreeing to the appropriate rules is pretty ridiculous. incumbent advantage, or something. so now crazy jim will resign his seat and uncle ernie, by some weird loophole in separation of powers?, will appoint himself to take bunning's seat. then what happens to the governorship? i'm not sure how that works but regardless of your party you have to see the complete lameness in that. 

and i don't think i'm mourning the loss of the kerry campaign because i'm an active bush hater or anything like that, but i was very hopeful about what would happen if he won. it could have been an exciting time. i wonder what bush will do with the supreme court. 

it would have been neat to be around in the seventies. i guess voter turnout for kids wasn't that much higher than it is now, but at least puff daddy and drew barrymore were absent, and the people who were into it were really really into it. maybe next time? hillary 2008? 

amendment to last entry: i'm good with whitfield too, so whitfield and marvin were my republican picks. one for two. hmm.

it was fun. i like those boys.
lots of candid conversation
i fell out of the hummer onto the parking lot and got scratched up. by fell i mean was pushed by chase in a fight for shotgun. 

i got shotgun.

i was supposed to take sat II's today, or so i thought, so i studied and freaked out and went nuts all week and went to bed early and ate a banana at six o'clock this morning and then realized that i was not, in fact, supposed to take sat II's today. that kind of put a damper on the morning as one might imagine. 

elly's birthday is next weekend. hooray for supersexy passionate scorpios, which is what we are by description and not so much practice. i wish he were born a week later instead of a week earlier than me, but i'm editor of the newspaper and i don't have to register for the draft or whatever so i guess i win in the long run.

(kidding, elly. kidding)

i thought the election was sort of disheartening on all fronts. the one republican i was pulling for, marvin, lost and all the democrats sucked it up too. i felt like crying.

also to be honorably mentioned on the list of people i have respect hella for are chase and my sister, both of whom know pretty much everything about me and apparently exchange the information that they're supposed to have exclusively and use it as potential blackmail."

he was wearing a t-shirt and i was wearing sweatpants. it was complete with terrible nsync mood music, burned potatoes, and awkward silences. pushy baby sisters, man. thanks, abby and laura? my condolences, dycus. 

i have had good days lately. i like sitting around and talking, which i have been doing a lot. i could do blank or blank games all day. which has happened lately too. i like our boys. specifically, jones in the park and catholic pretty types and the new kid and the gay one and the one who's not ours and is freckled and obnoxious. i am generally glad such guys exist. generally.

however, i miss girl bonding nights. what happened to all that? all my diana barrys are gone. it has been a rough year thus far for the teen girl squad.

today willet and i went to mass. (thank you dear) it felt less personal but more holy than my church. which could be good in some ways since it's not really supposed to be about me anyway. the music was pretty and they had lots of jesus art and i banged my knee once when i couldn't figure out if i was supposed to kneel or sit. we are going to have black church day soon! how exciting. 

i'm going to go listen to christmas music and make a teacher class notebook. i love christmas. and thanksgiving. i'm excited about group activities for them. i think november to february is stellar."

"event","it has been quite the fortune telling time as of late. i visited colleges and a psychic and had a seance. i am not sure how to spell that word. colleges were good for the most part. the breakdowns:

xavier: okay i guess but i hated cincinnati, which i'm not entirely sure how to spell either. it was terrible. the people there seemed like the way northern types would be, which may be partially because i was there at eight o'clock on a monday morning and i kind of wanted to believe that about them, but nonetheless. around the time my parents and i were walking in the almost-empty student center except for a group of people playing pool and talking about ""i don't care who you are, you be a"" - i hate to type this word - ""ho. you black, white, girl, guy, gay, straight, cat, dog, you a ho,"" i decided i probably wouldn't fit in there

uk: BIG. ANONYMOUS. TERRIBLE. but very generous with the bling

transy: eh. didn't dig them as much as i'd hoped, but they're moderately generous, so maybe i could learn to like lexington?

centre: great town, good size, lovely campus, nice people. i loved it. will work on urging them to become more blingingly generous.  

evansville: nice enough.

rhodes: SO GORGEOUS. it looks like the way a college should look. i adore rhodes. it was a lot like sewanee except in memphis, which i don't know if i'm cut out for since memphis is not quite benton. i can't drive through calvert city, much less that. it was really nice, though. insights, jake smith?

top three=sewanee centre rhodes.

i liked spending time with my parents, mostly. they are funny people. we watched napoleon dynamite and ate at places my dad ate in law school (columbia's and joe bologna's if you know lexington, both were stellar) and almost got lost a few times but the gps lady who gives directions hooked us up. mom calls her wanda. daddy calls her good dana. i missed abby but am pleased that she had to stay with my pimp of a grandmother and le bobby.

as for the psychic and the seance, read all about it in volume two of the orange appeel!  mrs. ann was a nice lady and i liked that she said i would marry a smart deep man and have two or three kids, but i knew that. and she wore capri pants and looked normal, not gypsylike, so that was disappointing. also disappointing were the twenty bucks she charged hillary and me. but she did have lots of terribly tacky jesus art so i can maybe let that slide.

my middle schoolers have their first academic match on thursday! it will be, without a doubt, intense! i think you should come watch. they are entertaining and often say really dumb things but i love them mostly. by love i mean let them talk during practice and leave to get nasty greasy biscuits from the cafeteria that make me cringe when i think about what the sausage on them is actually composed of. pubescent twits. one of the two things i saw hanging up on college bulletin boards that made me chuckle: ""support the academic team, because no one will really be free until nerd persecution ends."" the other: ""college democrats: because no one asks for a good piece of elephant.""

i am glad to be back in school. i like the routine of things. 
josefa the other is brilliant in the ways of treehouses, paintings, and tact. 
willett has boyish charms and always increasingly nice hair and he touched a turtle.
abby is pretty lame quite a bit of the time but has the genetic code most similar to mine out of everyone in the universe.
they get the harvey lovin awards for the week. to the rest of you: better luck next time, gang."

2. is it possible to have leg hair that's at an awkward in between stage and painful? i think my leg hair hurts. especially when i run my hand over it. that's kind of gross.

3. i love the gaither gospel hour. i lie in bed and watch it like an old woman. all i need is an electric blanket and a container in which to soak my dentures. and if you're my grandmother, a jolly fat man called bobby. i always get victory in jesus stuck in my head.

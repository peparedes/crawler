"event","when will u realize that you are pushing me away becasue of your stupid paranoia and petty fears. why do you keep asking me to be some one im now get this NOT?!!!! i cant be a physical person i told you that the night we started going out i tried it for a while and it just wasnt my thing, im sry that i cant be sexual, and im sry im not one of your romance novel to good to be true guys. dont you see be pulling me closer you are pushing me away. i never asked you to take care of me and i never asked you to make my lunch (though i do thank you for it) but i got along just fine before i meet you. now you no i love you dear but as much as i hate to say it i dont no how much more i can take or dont u rember our talk we had the night before you went to your dads? but you no what hurts the most??? the fact that you dont turst me, i have never lied to you, you just let your fears take control and its just easier to think i lied because it makes you look like the victom. like the other night when you accused me of sleeping with some one else what the FUCK made you think that is it becasue that me and audrey have a lot alike so you figure that ooo she likes the same stuff shane dose so shanes gonna sleep with her i dont no if he really is but im gonna say he is just to be safe. you even knew that she left before u did u watched her leave as soon as pratice begun. if i dont want to have sex period what makes you think that im gonna have it whith her huh??? you no me better then anyone else. but then again how can you trust me im just a dirty laier, your in love with me but you cant trust me well that dosnt fit with me well chelsea. if your unhappy with me then perhaps you should just end it your self."

"event","well hears to the start of a summer...i have a feeling that this summer is gonna suck. i just feel distant fromm every one and those are close to me seem to be drifting away. chelseas friend is coming back today. chelsea has been realy excited about this moment for a while, but i guss she just has a different relationship whith her friends then i do, i mean she's always said when she thinks about her frineds, and then she always gets depressed. when ever i think of my friends sure im sad that i cant be with them and all but im happy that i had them as a friend and i always  treasure  there memroy and it makes me happy to think of them. i dont no. i just want to make chelsea happy, nothing i do anymore works but i she just really misses her friend (good thing shes coming back today huh). i just feel like a bad person though cause i dont like to be with out chelsea. when im not with her theres just this huge void deep inside , i dont want to take all of her time but sometimes i just do. but its for the best cause im just gonna back off so she can have some time with other ppl so i guess...."

"event","well im in a better mood today, besides the fact that think this is kinda exciting well the fact that im doing this at school and if i get caught on the internet i could fail my class but at any rate im here. ya chelsea called me last night that total made my night a lot better, she told me that her cousin might come down next weekend. i think thats cool excpet that means that chelsea wont be able to spend the night at the star party thing but im not gonna say anything because she hasn't seen her cousin in a long time. grr i feel kinda bad though cause i feel like im a leech on chelseas family. i mean that they always feed me and stuff and i really dont want to be a burden but i also have to learn to except help. but i must aslo learn that there is a balance the must be kept between accepting help when given and taking to much help. it makes me mad at my uncle i told him last week that i needed lunch money but he just said ok iv been barley getting by for lunch money and today chelsea gave up part of her lunch money for me, im greatful that she did this.
well any ways i better go before i get caught online so laters ^_^."

"event","well its been a while sence i last wrote, well i guess i cant really complain about any thing, but iv had some ups but mostly downs. i feel bad for saying this but chelseas been feeling down in the dumps lately and i think its because of me and now haveing said that i hope she dosnt feel guilty or anything. I hate how nothing comes right out of my mouth, especialy when im talking to chelsea, ill try to say one thing and it comes out totaly different and then she gets mad. but some times she makes me feel bad to like some times she makes me feel really stupid and she rubbs it in, but she always makes up for it later but it makes me feel bad cause she really beats her self up over it. i love her with all that i can love i honstely do but i just want her to understand that she dosnt need to beat her self up over somthing so small. like today she went on about how i couldnt hold an umbrella right, it made me feel really stupid when she just kept rubbing it in so i told her that i didnt need her telling my how stupid i am. shen then huged me and she told me how sry she was and then she felt bad for like an hour. i dont want her to feel bad i mean sure i dont like being called stupid but how does, its just somthing little i just want to get over it as soon as possible. but dont worry things arnt all that bad me and chelsea soon made up. but i make her feel bad as well, i always send her on guilt trips allthough i really dont mean to (see told you im not good with words) and then i feel bad. but iv gotten better iv learnded not to get angry anymore but just get over it, i smile and just tell her that i didnt like that and then she usually smiles and says ok im sry and then she usually dosnt do it agin. but i no that i can get pretty annoying too. but all and all i love her with all my heart she really is a good person. but i feel bad about yelling at her today, i was still kinda angry form yesterday. last weekend chelsea went to her dads for the weekend and i waited the whole weekend to see her and then she invites me to the beach, i asked my uncle if i could go and then he just got all pissy and said that the mowing didnt get done so no one is going no where. but i had already gotten all of my part done i had to pick and finish all that his kids dindt do. i got so angry i hung up on chelsea and that made me feel even worse  and i guess i still had a little anger left, my day was going pretty good till then. well its gettin kinda late so im gonna go now so till next time laters o and 

p.s. to chelsea when she reads this
I Love you with all my heart"

"event","So today I was cleaning the house and vacuuming when I found an almost empty pack of cigarettes in my dad's short pocket..there was one left. While debating whether to try it or not I found the barbeque lighter and sneaked out front while my brother talked all googly-eyed to his girlfriend on the phone as he had been doing all damn day. Due to the wind I failed at the lighting process a few times until I recalled how other people did it. It's lit, I try and all the while apologizing silently to my poor lungs. Kept thinking of the Body exhibit at the museum with the picture of the black lungs with words atop it ""Mind if I smoke?"" Burned myself once with the embers at the end. Go me.
When it was finished and I smoothed out the tip against the brick wall..the smell lingered. Brushed my teeth, took a shower, and now I sit telling you of my tale with it tingling in the back of my throat.

Fleh, F-that. People get addicted to it...I recognize this but don't understand why. Everyone's got their preferences but, for me, it's just not appealing in the least.

End adventure."

It's spring break and i think my parents are happy I'm home because of all the housework that is actually getting done now. Eh, I do it anyway and as much as possible..god I'm never letting my house become like this one. -shudders-

Saw Horton Hears a Who last night..first movie in months. The movie was awesome and I'm proud of Disney for going out on the limbs of entertainment.. by the way, if you see it, know that the retarded creature is amazing. I had a good time with my company though I'll admit we know each other a little too well for our own good..heh, its inevitable with our history. It was nice to laugh at the past, apologize sincerely...

So here I sit in an empty house with music and my old addiction up attempting to think about RPing again.. Meh. Need someone good to do it with..Not this casual stuff which isn't even exactly in character.

Yep. End o.o;"

To be told that without you something great would of never happened...<br /><br />It's amazing.<br /><br />Been hanging out the past few nights. Excited about my next few trips and might be planning another at the end of the summer but that's only if I'm really determined to throw $400 into wind-trip across the country. Maybe..I got nothing else to spend it on except school and already enough is going towards that.<br />McDonalds treat their employees like crap..wish I had a car for that Popeyes' slight invite. I heard this one lady had gotten a raise a couple of months ago that has yet to show up on her paycheck...nah..fuck that. I'm not going to be worked like a dog while everyone else doesn't give a shit...but I can talk all I want..I'll still do my normal standards of work for myself.<br /><br />Figured out a few late, late things these past few days...but ah well, it's too late. Take the information and apply it to future events. I miss, and I don't at the same time...and the non-missing bothers me. However, deep breaths and a good talking to a friend calms me. Chin up and smile. Speaking of which I watched the first ten minutes to this Secret video my mom popped in. It spoke of the Law of Attraction with the universe. It made some sense but really hard to believe...but it makes sense. If you set your mind to something you'll eventually get it and be happy with it...even if you do go into debt. heh...like the girl who was looking at a really expensive necklace and it suddenly appeared on her neck. Yeah, bet that must be some big bucks there. Heh...just look on the positive side of life and it'll get you somewhere, I guess the video was really saying..didn't watch it all..<br /><br />Jingling of the bells are coming filling my own mind with fantasy of romance. I don't know exactly how to describe it but it's not the whole 'Oh my true love is going to be there'..it's more personal and not going to happen. Make sense? Didn't think so.<br /><br /><em>Ten nine eight I'm breaking away,<br />I'm all dressed up and ready to play.<br />Seven six five four and im all over you.<br />Counting three two one and im having fun.<br /><br /></em>It just makes for some scary sense in my life."

"event","<p>Last night a friend and I ventured over to Alamo Drafthouse and watched the old 80s Lost Boys. Great movie, I must say..the graphics were good for its day time and saw a lot of familiar faces on the screen who I can't remember where from. The chick was pretty and I usually don't find girls from that time period attractive. Bravo. Good plot, hillarious, and I just loved the geeks!<br />Afterwards I was dropped off and I searched for songs by Shiny Toy Guns to add to my music collection..found three songs so far I really like.<br /><br />Today I took my new songs with me on my mile trip to work and was humming them all day long. It made me quite hyper-happy (probably due to the upbeatness to it) and it got me through the day quickly. People smiled to my hopping around and others I think were scared. Boo ya. I was quite pleased when every time I looked up another hour had passed by.<br />At one point this kid paying with his own money had messed up an order and I followed him to the back of the resturant to make up the difference to get him a 2 for 1 deal and this muslim guy with a blue shirt I had ordered up was just watching me. When I gave him his order he asked for fresh french fries and explained it was his favorite part about McDonalds. I agreed (was in a really good mood)&nbsp;and asked him to wait since they were gonna be a few. He just watched me before saying, ""You live not far from here?""<br />I blinked. ""Just down the road."" ""Ahh..well our places are (wherever, far away) and we're always looking for good employees"" lol that's when I noticed the Popeyes logo on his shirt. ""Ah..well that's a bit far since I walk. If I had a car it'd be a different story,"" lol, interesting. Highlight of the day:&nbsp;someone wanting to steal me away from McDonalds. Hoorah.<br /><br />Made more plans tonight to go see Rocky Horror Picture Show at another place. Should be fun, yeah? Yeah...<br /><br />And yes, you do get a million additional entries..I got no one to talk to about my day so you, the viewers, get to suffer through it now.

What I found is this..and while the begining the chick's voice is annoying...you get use to it after a couple of times through but the chorus is awesome..to me, anyway.<br /><br />There's a part in the video though which stands out the most (yes, it's a weird and slow video) but this part I was just like 'wow..'

I wasn't the happiest person in the world when I got there so I guess that's why the stuck me making drinks for a good two hours for drive through..but that was fine, standing in one spot doesn't hurt....yeah..work is never exciting to talk about. The highlight of the day was, sadly, just the new broom we got. The manager seemed really happy about it and I realized life was sad when your highlight is a new broom that looks like it was picked up off the side of the road anyway.<br /><br /><em>Ten nine eight and I'm breaking away<br />I'm all dressed up and I'm ready to play<br />Seven six five four and I'm all over you<br />Counting three two one and I'm having fun...</em><br /><br />Tonight I decided to go to the midnight showing of Lost Boys with a friend. Took an hour's worth of&nbsp;nap, refreshed a bit, and work will be most interesting tomorrow. Everyone says it's a good movie, I trust them. Just mostly need to get out and get my mind off of things... I'm not that hurt, but just going through the motions of losing someone...I guess. It'll be okay...it will.<br /><br /><em>I was pretending<br />Your secret kiss of confidence<br />Was my escape<br />The perfect game to play...<br /><br /></em>School will be here sooner then I think, Chris' are coming home in a few weeks and lots of things are going to go down soon!

And she's gone. She's gone? I've been with this female for quite a few months and I am impartial on releasing her? She wasn't a friend though we had our moments. Just a room mate. She wasn't bad, had a dream she was mad at me, but she wasn't bad at all. Cheerleader on the outside with stereotypes tacked on, an absolute sweetheart who is helpful and kind beneath. Hope I wasn't a bad room mate to her... Honestly I wish I could of said something more, wisdom, advice. ""Don't feel like you have to be with him just because there is no one else"", something.

We all have them. Face it, we are human. This is something I have to realize when looking back at this weekend. I started to slide downhill because of a few minor details and once it was recognized to the public, I felt as though I had to act my stated condition further. Energy then seeped away and I announced I was tired. I managed to pull off a destructive finale of pure silence against the cold, and everything came to a simmer. <i>Never go to bed angry.</i>

The next morning when the heat was cooled I departed from my loved one and ventured out into the world. At first I was uncertained that my mode of transportation was ever going to appear, but the nice taxi drive told me that it would be twice the wait...one hour became two due to this. I stood at my stop, settled on a thick horizontal pole and waited for the red white and blue bus to grace me with its presence. When it finally did I climbed on, calculating the whole way where I should get off. When I did, the nice bus driver mislead me and I had to walk a few blocks until I found some fimiliar names.
""Did this route go by?""
""Yes m'am. Five minutes ago.""
I ended up settled on a bench for an hour, collecting pigeons around my feet while tossing banana nut muffin crumbs at them. I was popular.
When a man came wandering up, looking in every trash can, I took the initive to hold out an unopen box of strawberry poptarts to which he thanked me and proceeded looking through trash cans. I have faith he didn't sell them off. They'll be eaten by someone, at some point.

When the bus finally rolled its way up to the stop a sign of 'Downtown' was on its front and the bus driver kindly informed me that the area I wanted to go to I couldn't get to due to it being the weekend. I called up my sister then who was at home and told her about this. Halfway through though I saw a bus labeled 'Memorial' and accidently hung up on Carol while running across the street. Not 45 minutes later then I was on my side of town safely and being dropped off right across from the meeting point.

Carol told me about a 25$ gift card she had for a store so after taking me to a Jewelers to look at her possible wedding bands we went into the sparkling new-looking mall. We tried on dresses, she got pictures, and I got enough shopping experience to last me months.. I guess I was a bit overdue for it.

After stew at home, the movie 300 bootlegged, and a hug from the parents, we headed back up here. /end weekend

It's only monday. This week is barely spiced with things to do. Councling meeting tomorrow, study for upcoming killer tests, and revise a paper I think I did fairly well on. Other then that, it's free time. I'm not use to this. Not after a month of constant stuff going on.

And now it's back to finding something to do. There's plenty..I just don't feel motivated to do any of them. *sigh*

Good night"

"event","Wow these past two weeks are rocking the boat. Quick, painless and eventful this offers the rest of my freshmen year to a blur...and now that I've said that it will crawl like a snail.

I am excited to finish my first year of college, and very pleased to know that an old friend is returning to close distance company..it was as if they held everyone I knew together which showed when they came down for a week's visit.
Another thing to be excited about (and closer in time length) is Friday. Audry is to whisk me away from campus in the afternoon in her new cherry red truck with another dearest friend and Aud's fiance and we are to head over to Griff's for a night of reuniting and just plain fun. I can't wait to see her, havn't since Christmas which was very brief. To be honest, I feel quite distant from those I once knew, and as I exclaimed last night to the song Thriller that I could not wait for our highschool reunion, I don't know... He said I'd miss highschool. It's just the dances..Young, free, <i>loud</i> and outgoing, that's who I was there. We all supported eachother to communicate our minds, it was all ok to do. I don't know how to describe it.. maybe I want to go back to that time because I am envious of that girl I was there. The ocean is a big place.

Anywho, as I eat my crunchy Raisen Brand I press onwards to the present and future. This morning I realized I couldn't grab my upper stomach as easily as I could before. Progress is keeping me going as well as my evil component 6 points ahead of me..and all he did was give up coke and started eating better and in small portions! I rationalized though with myself that he had more to lose then me therefore it was easier. Either way, I want to catch up to that number. Teetering on 170. It must be broken.

Next semester I fear of who my room mate might be. I have yet to make any friends with campus-living females. I don't think I'm going to like this surprise. Oh well. What would be a plus is if they're like my other friend's roomies where they're absent all the time..or maybe I'll be with someone who doesn't fight with their boyfriend, a gamer, a sleeper, a anything but the loud, annoying, and stays up til 4 in the morning kind who drags all their friends over. I've gotten lucky so far, fingers crossed my luck will hold out.

And with enough babbling of past, present, and future I come to a close.
Until next time."

"event","It's Sunday which means I get to venture back sooner or later to my dorm. I am in a way glad because I will be able to continue my work out(god knows I'm going to have to work my way back up to 2 miles again) and continue my last two months of freshmen year. I'm slightly nervous about how this semester is going so far in two subjects and it's about to be a third if I can't force myself to scarf down this redicously snore-fest book. I don't want ot fail though. I'm going to go to the math tutor and I'm going to study harder for political science and I'm going to force the book of civil rights down my throat...Lovely how english isn't a problem.

This morning I was able to eat 1/4th of my waffle before giving up because my braces hurt too much for me to go on with the rest. They added in the final bracket on my top set of teeth and it's driving me crazy with the scraping of sharp metal against my very back cheek. The wax doesn't relieve any of the pain and Aleve will hopefully do its job here soon. Fortunetly that's pretty much the only thing I really have to worry about today. All 7 other pains from yesterday that were multiplied have simmered down quite a bit leaving the prime focus on my poor mouth.

Today I am going to venture to the Vitamin Shoppe! Yay! Going to get a thing of fish oil and these shakes my mum claims to be better then Slim Fast. I don't place much trust into what she says tastes good because she's prone to thinking what tastes awful tastes good and what tastes good is bad for you...Ah well.
The braces though me thinks is a blessing in disguise since now I wont be able to enjoy any real food for a long while..so why not just drink my nutrients instead? Drinking doesn't hurt as bad..heh.

It's also official. Cheryl is stupid. Do I care though? Nah. Doesn't bother me as long as I'm not the dumbest one in the family. Sad as it is to think that way, got to keep your head above the water somehow, right? Right.

Anywho I started out about a month ago at the embarrassing weight of 185.5 lbs on my scale at home... now it's reading a flat 173. My goal is 158 (where I was two years ago) and maybe a little more if I'm lucky. 12.5 down, 15 more to go. Can I do it? Gotta fit into that size 14 dress for my sister's wedding (at size 16 right now). Two dress sizes...I think I can do it. I don't notice much change other then being able to grab a little less and believing other's words. Took pictures to compare what I was and what I am now..going to have to take and compare once I get back up to the dorms. Hopefully I'll see a difference which will motivate me all the more..that, and I want my damn WoW expansion (a competition with a friend). So I got my motivations.

I think that is everything at the time. Spring break was relaxing, friend-overdrived and overall fullfilling. I needed this (minus the sickness bit) and think I'm ready to return to school.

"event","It was a bad idea at first, sitting in the car with butterflies in my stomach as I would get whenever going to a doctor of any sort. Was of mixed emotions thanks to minor events, everyone seemed to be contributing to my horrible day (Sunday). But when I got to my destination my mum turned to me and asked. ""Are you sure?""
""No, but I want to see them.""

Pulling up to the house I held my breath in silent pray that the one standing in the doorway wouldn't draw his attention away from his current task. The door opened, he disappeared inside, and a familiar face looked at me in almost surprised expression.
One deep breath and I found myself outside of the car which pulled the disappearing act before I could change my mind. No turning back now.

Making my way to where the last had been memory flooded of the time out in the front yard...there wasn't too many but I did realize one day out there that I couldn't put down another person I was mad at worth crap. I call that period of my life of when that happened 3? years ago, the Jamie time. Wonder how he's doing...if he's even alive and still in jail. Probably.
Greeted in a late hug by a friend since freshmen year I felt better about being where I was...but when he turned back and looked at me, I wanted to flee the scene with my tail between my legs.

A friend since sophomore year patted the seat beside himself and his tired girlfriend, I felt welcomed, but awkward. Time passed, I was silent. Sitting and responding whenever spoken to but trying to be as little attention-drawn as possible. It worked.

Fast forwarding a bit they started to get ready for the movie 300. I was sitting on the bed with Griff and Rhonda in the room when he came in. ""You going?"" The couple wasn't going due to early (3 A.M.) work in the morning and tiredness. ""If I'm invited,"" I replied, scared. ""[So and so] said it would be awkward."" Agreed. So they toddled off to the movies leaving us three to Mario Kart...a game I didn't suck 100% at. Feel embarrassed whenever I play other games that I die not ten minutes into because everyone I know is a gamer...a good gamer. Ah well, everyone has their strong points.

Griff gave me an elaborate rundown of the house before bed, I felt like a newb to his home. ""I'll be out after a bit,"" Rhonda said, leaving me to wandering around a bit and attempting to watch TV. Finally I ended up in a curled up position, waiting. Felt like a watch dog because almost every sound I got up to investigate if I was sure it wasn't one of their 5ish cats.
Rhonda was finally up and about and I was located in the kitchen when they entered. Attempting to stay out of sight then I just remained locked in the area as they went on to Rhonda about how the movie was.

When I finally emerged I wanted to run into the guest room and turn in for the night, but instead I went to play more Mario Kart with the excited crowd.
""I'm going fuck with Cheryl"" he said then, sitting next to me on the couch. Confused I just kept my distance. After awhile when everyone else had given up and enough slut and bitch calling was produced it was just me and him.
""Are you OK?"" ..well I don't know about you but I was stunned. He began to play around like everything he said before he left didn't happen...like everything that had happened, didn't. Was nervous but by the end of the night I was stolen away to his house and I was a happy clam.

After that the time went by smoothly. He teased me about my 'date' with a friend for the next night and while they went off to see 300 a second time, I was going to see Pans Labyrinth. My friend was a bit late and we had to rush there but it was well worth the fried pickles and good movie. He was right though, definitely my kind of imagination (with a bit of a twist). I am glad I saw it.
Well, apparently this spring break was full of surprises because after the movie let out it was the perfect weather. Once home I told him of my adventures while we waited for a yay or nay to another 'surprise'...see, they just didn't seem to work out for me so I just had to call them up and ask before hand of where they were and if it was okay to do it. When we got the answer and were heading out the door my dad said, ""Going out again?"" Me: ""Yep. Spending as much time as I can with people I haven't seen in months.""

My friend was kind enough to take me over there which I was truly thankful for. I'm sorry hon what happened afterwards =/
The next day was full of God of War II over at Carlos'. That game is beautiful. Jeff beat it within about 10ish hours on Mortal level and I slept through the last boss.
The next day was another lazed day of some WoW and general laziness. Today is the same..but I'm sick =/ At home finally and enjoying the time spent here since tomorrow I'mma goin to the Rodeo to see Brooks and Dunn. That'll be awesome.. oh yeah, and dentist appointment...can't wait! Seriously, these things need to be tightened.

Soo yeah, I'm off! Laundry and WoW, laundry and WoW."

Last night was..interesting. Left the dorm sad but ran into Jessica who walked me to thie chilli cookoff which I only caught the very end of when they were telling everyone to go home. So we met up with a few people that were leaving(myself looking for Carol) and walked them halfway back to the towers before they departed for the IMAX to see the midnight showing of 300. Talked to Jessica a bit and then split off to go to the OB C-Store where I found both Carol and Ingrid chilling with Mike and John.
From there it was taking random things were a little crazy. Mike and Carol began popping these powdery things at John and Ingrid. Carol and I worked the register a little bit while the guys were out for a smoke and just generally enjoyed running around back where they make all the food searching for a mop for the powdery mess.
Anyway, that was that and everyone who entered the store seemed to have a good time so it was all cool.

Afterwards when Carol insisted on driving me back we ended up going to her appartment where I stayed the night. Her cat Max is such a lap cat yet not at the same time...anywho he crawled between us, ontop of us, and laid at our feet while we slept.
Woke up at 7:15ish when she brought me back to the dorm. Went to the gym and afterwards met up with her and Israa for lunch at Chillies Too where we split a salad and yeahh...from there just working on math before coming home.

So now I'm here for a week to do whatever I want...and with not much to do, lol. Probably just read and look over political science and history because tests are comin' up within the next few weeks...yeah, exciting, no?

*streches* That's all."

"event","PM and I'm already heading to bed. Been so dog tired as of lately and I'm loving every second of it. Gone to the gym so many times now for different things, soreness never felt so sweet.

Two miles jogged today, another mile walked and some weights lifted to pass time. It's healthy for me and I think my muscles are finally going to cooperate with me not to hurt so badly anymore until I push them to the next limit..maybe I'm moving too fast for this. Ah well..again, takes my mind off of things. My friend said it could become a potential addiction..that's fine.
BLEEHH sallaadds without dressing. The brocolli here on campus is terrible dry and Italian dressing has become my new friend. Enough on that though, how's everything else?

Fine, fine..catching up with a few people, wondering what I've been doing with my time given thus far..what /have/ I been doing? No idea what's been going on for the past two month--ohh, that's right. Watching anime/movies with a friend. Damn yous WoW.

I've concluded tonight that I do, in fact, like my room mate. She is a sweet heart who's just with an asshole. Seriously, asshole. Major asshole. I wont put details here but lets just say when she tells him she's /been/ unhappy, he yells at her, curses at her, and says it's her own damn fault. Wow. Anyway me and her hung out a bit tonight watching some TV movies they were airing like Me Myself and Irene and She's All That. Was fighting with a friend a bit on the sexual topic and so after throwing my arms into the air and returning to the program her and I talked about it a bit and I found out that I'm not alone in this world..which I knew but it was really nice to hear it..especially from her.

*streches* I should be asleep but I want my phone to vibrate with word I got a new message..hah, doubt that'll happen. Feels like we've switched places and they're running the show now..wonder if they think that way or it's innocent like it was with me...God knows but it's a hurtful game if it is one..Well, least it makes me appreciate things more. Heh..Talked to a friend tonight about that..got pissed off at the truth but, hey, he's right..to an extent.

Alright. I know I aint gettin no new message tonight so bleh. Hopefully the professor will just let us hand in our papers and dismiss us. Figers crossed. God damn I wrote 3..THREE frakin drafts for that paper and every single one of them was different entirely except maybe the intro a little bit. Damn.

Spring break is coming up, squee. A week of sitting at home waiting for my sister to either come back from her man-toys or work and seeing my brother every once in awhile..I got dad, but he works at home. Guess it'll be the time to go over notes and make diagrams to study later for upcoming tests..specially in political science.. -_-; got a bad grade on the first test..

Alright, enough ranting. I feel better so off to sleep I go.

"event","Went with dad and Jesse yesterday to this biker gig my dad had to run sound for Axe.
It was sunny and cold all day, got some great sun but since I don't want to type up every detail I'll just quote the most memorable parts.

Me: ""Do you have a relative named Justin Koehning?""
Guy: ""Never even met the guy""

Man: ""We need a girl to show off the tank tops""
Me: ""I might not be hot but I can do it anyway""
*freeze*

Lady: ""Her name is Ashes and I never thought I'd pay so much for a dog but I fell in love with her"" (Little ashy poodle)

The horse with one eye normal and the other half closed/red...Me and Jesse were working the merchendise table where we freezed our asses off switching control of it...this one spot in front of the stage that was just sand but very warm/hot due to the fire from the night before.

Guy: ""My names Chris, and this is Jeremy""
Me: ""...""

Man: ""You're just a pyro now arn't ya?""
Me: ""I just like to see how things burn is all.""

Man: ""I'm 37 years old and am addicted to MySpace""
Me: ""Eww..""
Man: ""My daughter introduced it to me a year ago and didn't think much of it but now I'm on it all the time changing my music weekly and updating pics. People are very surprised when I put up pictures from when we are on tour. Screw the larger rock stars who think they're too big for that shit.""

Man: ""Ever hear of (I think Kill Hannah)""
Me: ""Yeah I have""
Man: ""Met them last week""

Hot chocolate, the best lemonade I've ever had. Got a new necklace to replace my last soul necklace that broke. There was slow races with motorcycles, drag races, games such as Statue of Liberty and Weiny Eating Contest. Some people complained about not enough people being there but there was a fairly good size crowd..lots of loud noises and real nice folks. Dad told me most of them had high professions though at first glance you'd never suspect them to be doctors and lawyers...was really interesting.
Got there around 12 and the first band went on at 9:30..it was a LONG day. The first band was alright, covering everything fom Johnny Cash to Sweet Home Alabama boys and then the hairy chest contest. There was only really one guy with a really hairy chest, more people probably would of entered if it wasnt freezing. Then the wet tshirt contest.

""Jesse watch over the table""
""Busy.""

lol. So first it started out with 3 girls. Two of them I swore were practically lesbians given their dancing out on the lot with the first band...kind of made me embarrassed on behalf of my sex population for these two to be drunk and rubbing up against eachother in such manner. One of them looked like a teenager with her boyfriend of 15+ years older then her.. Anyway, back to the contest. So there were three up there and they had over $200 cash prize..this got more women motivated. A few more joined them with white wet t-shirts and I'm off to the side shivering for them..maybe the alcohol kept them warm.
So there they were, more trickling in over time but suddenly shirts began flying off.

Chris: ""If you've seen one saggy boobie you've seen them all""
Me: ""None of them you think are perky?""
Chris: ""Nope.""

Me: ""Did this happen last night too?""
Jeremy: ""Yep. Not that interesting though..""

So there were at least 7 chicks up on the stage, shirtless. The teenage chick I spoke of earlier was grabbing her 'lesbian lover's boobs and they were dancing the same as they were on the lot. I watched but felt nothing from it really because, well, they're just boobs. Heh even on chicks I perfer clothing on. Anyway they each did their own little jig and the audience screamed their heads off the most for the teenage-looking one. Second prize was my favorite. This woman's husband pushed her into it and turned out she had nipple rings.

Announcer: ""What about this woman?"" (nipple ringed)
Me: ""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!""
Jesse: *looks to me weirdly*
Me: ""What?""

Anyway, after that Axe played, they had the fire going, and they were awesome. They sounded good and did very well. I was proud to be associated with them. Would of danced but all the dancers left after the shirt contest.

So Axe played for about an hour and I sold a CD and a t-shirt..which by the way they were 20$ each because it wasn't crap material..they were SOFT T-shirts..they also had thongs they were selling which I was tempted to buy one but I really don't look good in one..still have the dolly t-shirt though :D that one is comfy.

Afterwards it took about an hour to tear down and then it was a 2 hour strech long drive. Dad stopped off in Old Town Springs where Brad lives and went inside for an hour to rest while me and Jesse stayed in the truck. It was so uncomfortable in there I fell asleep for 10 minutes at a time before shifting then just stayed awake until dad came out saying he rested his eyes a few minutes before drinking a few cups of coffee. So with another hour to go I tried talking to him but kept dozing off when finally I woke from a slow dip of the head to familiar Clay Rd.
So then I helped my dad by bringing some things into the house and finally went to bed about 4:30 AM. Woke up at 1ish and here I am.

Mom: ""Now you see what really happened at the gigs I went to with dad""
Me: ""Yeah but it was better then staying at home. Got fresh air, some excercize, and sun.""

Edit: Something else worth mentioning here is when I talked to the keyboardist. He was this heavy mexican guy who was an absolute sweet heart. When I sat at the table he sat and talked to me about some of his problems he's having with his wife. Said he's 37 years old, been married to his wife for 20 years and it's only been recently that she's been distant from him like their marriage became boring for her and she felt they were two different people. Now this man is just deeply in love with her and had been from the get go but she, on the other hand, doesn't seem to be feeling the same way fully.. From what I saw and heard they were opposites as he was an absolute sweet, giving person while he described her as the strong-willed, give me no shit kind of woman. He seemed to think a lot on his own life and everything around him..it was interesting. I was able to relate to him a little bit..I wish him the best of luck as he's just going on his way and let her make her decision..

Man: ""Let me tell you something..the older you get, the pain you experience through a break up is the same if not worse."""

-start-

Feburary upheld its reputation this year yet again with being one of the worst days of my life. It was Rhonda's birthday though. Happy belated birthday, love.
I've resorted back to World of Warcraft for a term, it made me feel better yesterday with just healing others. Guess that's my true class, saving people's asses since I can't do that in real life. That would be cool though, to have those powers...

I can say I've been officially single for awhile now as hard as it is to believe. And though I hate admitting that I now miss that life of relationship and comfort, I trudge on. Feels like a swamp with no jungle man swinging on vines to save the day...ah well. Alright, it's not so much the relationship life...of course, it's a particular person but I've seemed to convince them otherwise through all my preaching. I want to kick myself for it and promise them the world, but I know being pathetic wont do me any good nor will it change their mind.. I have convienced myself into false hopes to cover the pain for now, it hurt too much yesterday and the weather is sunny..now that I've all but numbed it the skies cloud up and threatens to rain.

I understand their pain though, and I hate myself for what I've done. Hurt one too many people and I can't say I'm sorry enough..just have to move on.
Hah, move on. Fuck that. I'm done with relationships unless it's the one person or it be female. Female would be a change...just need to find one that's open to it. God knows. In all truth though I just want to heal to see them again. I loved them as a friend and I want to continue it. I just need to heal... ""The pain may hurt extrodinarly, but just remember that time continues no matter what""(not direct quote)..I wanted to hate the person who told me that bead of truth.. wanted being the key word.

So here I am, the day after February 27 and I've made it through a jungle of pain, regret, and everything and have buried it for awhile..it'll spring up at some point though, I know this. I've let out most of it(it was a /long/ day).

Enough ranting about that, yeah? Yeah...heh...

*sigh* embarrassing to post this public, but who reads this anyway?

"event","So last night the three of us were running around the roof of the parking garage across from the towers when we decided 'Hey, lets get up and go somewhere'. First we started walking around campus but shortly after making it to the middle of the first street we crossed we contemplate what else to do. 'I don't want to walk, lets drive' said one or the other and we left campus.

""Left!"" was my answer to every question of which way to go which ulitmately lead us back to my side of town. We went further though to Katy where Chris lives having no real idea of what was going to happen. After a short stop at his house we decide to watch the movie 007 at the Alamo...which didn't start for another hour or two. So to kill time we went to the Petco across the way from it.
First what captured me was the ferrets they had out and a family was petting. I got to hold my first ferret and it was so adorable and small that it made me wonder if I should get one in the future...hehe.

Anyway, where the fun begins is when we walk over to the hampster/mice/rodents in general area. We were standing looking at this cute orange thing with little ears when I noticed two mice in another cage fighting..but what was wrong with this picture was there was blood. ""Uhm..what are they doing?"" I asked, voice beginning to panic or worry or something. Chris, mr. hero, came to the rescue somehow and we got one of the store workers. He told us after scooping up the dead animal that when there are too many mice in a small area they'll start to kill one another off. If that wasn't bad enough the guy went into detaiil of how after they kill they go for the brains first then eat out the other's intestines. Interesting.. but anyway, it was like 'Wtf?!' and all the while we were watching the victor run around with blood on his stomach and paws running around the cage. Fiesty little fellow...

Anyway, moving on from that event we found a Chinchilla which was so adorable (even though it was hiding the whole time) and saw the fish and reptiles. ""Cheryl, Cheryl!"" beckoned Chris. ""Oh for fucks sake!"" I exclaimed as I fell into the trap of scary snakes. I then pointed out the spider nearby and laughed at his horrid reaction, bwhaha..

After that we went and saw the 007 which was my first 007 ever. Nifty, I do admit, but the every five seconds action scenes kept me flailing around in my seat. Oh yeah, we went to McDonalds before the Alamo where I found out that now, in the playplace, they have video games. Lol, that's awesome.

In conclusion Cheryl put off a good 10 minutes worth of studying to type up this post so read it, love it, and comment =3 Hehehehe...

In the words of Mario: ""Here we go!""
Peace."

When you wake, you shall have, all the pretty little ponies..

Ahh, childhood. It was around Carol's birthday and we went to this music store. Ingrid brought up the CD because it had horses on it. Being a huge fan of them at the time (not to mention the case was purple), I wanted it. Hah...I miss the old days.

College is alright. ""I'm lovin' it""...haha. It's here like all the other grades, just different setting and more freedoms. I can stay up til 3 every night and it doesn't matter, go /walk/ outside at 3 and it wont matter..well, it'd matter if you got shot..

Been working on artwork. It's relaxing though I don't feel like I'm progressing anywhere. It's the same thing over and over again and I don't know how to draw hands...blast, I'm limited.
What else is there to say? I'm in love with my family as of lately, finding myself smiling anytime I speak of them, can't wait for Christmas. Grandma is coming for Thanksgiving, need to talk to her more as I still feel guilty for babysitting instead of going over to Mississippi this last summer.

Skipping around on topics of my life, really can't settle down on one. Been thinking about things lately a little too much, been involved in my friend's lives up here (I think) too much...they havn't told me to back off yet but I think it might come to that... Have a total of 5 real friends here so far which I am completely satisfied with. Fausto, Israa, Brenden, Alaa, and Chris..great people and very interesting. Israa made me feel at home most with our conversation of meows, Brenden reminding me of Mullins in a way with freaking out about everything. Alaa is much like her sister and Fausto is just ..Fausto. lol. Chris I can compare with only one other person in my life who I've met but we're not going to get in to that..

My room mate is pretty cool and I love the way the classes work. I think my history is just going to be english since I am apathetic.. God I miss Mullins and Marcus though. Brittani goes here but I never see her, my sisters go here but I only run into Ingrid every once in a while..she's more family-oriented then myself, heh.. Yeah, I'm still skipping around.

I want some natural disaster to happen for some reason, it'd be cool if it snowed. I want it to rain, to thunder..it makes perfect sense.
""That's the way it's gonna be little darling""

I should be tired right now..I'll write until I'm tired. Haha, sucks for you though by now you've already stopped reading since it's nothing but nonsence. People usually have something interesting to talk about, a tall tale, something...nah, not here. It's Cheryl ranting about everything and nothing at the same time. It's parallel? Is that how you spell it?
I'm searching for some soft music and I stumble across the Celtic songs..I never returned that CD..infact, it's lost. Ah well, I'll always remember Ms. Bartley in return for her spare CD. Ahh the memories with these songs, every single one I hear.. Always reminds me of something or another, especially the country ones.

Maybe I should do something else for awhile...yeah..

Sorry folks, not much else to say. I'm off to  photoshop or dreamland.

I'm sorry, you."

"event","Yo so I'm going to explain where I've been the past few two days, kies? ^^
Hehe! Well the best thing happened to me on Wednsday after English class. I went to the cafeteria and was standing in line when I noticed this guy who had randomly sat down to lunch with me. I waved hello and asked if he was going and upon hearing yes offered to sit with again. He looked like he was waiting for someone but I wasn't sure so I went on about my way, grabbing lunch and sitting down with too much food in a booth. I waited awhile, eating somewhat slowly since the last encounter I was on desert and he walked by and dropped off his stuff, going about his own way. When he sat down, however, we sat for a few minutes, talking, before this girl and guy came up. ""Why didn't you wait for us?"" they asked him, moving into the booth with us. 'Alright' I thought, scooting over for this chick with a dark grey mickymouse, longsleeved shirt with one of those head-wearing things the people in the ...middle east? do. Seen a lot of those kind around here. Muslims? I don't know... Anyway they toddled off for their own food and Fausto told me theior names were Izra and Brennen. I've recently been talking to my highschool friend Brennon so I was just like 'lol, kies.' So they come back and I notice they all have considerably less food then me.. Ack! I tried to hurry with my own but Izra was talking to me and I was embarrassed to have food in my mouth half the time, lol. Brennon was going over flashcards for organic chemistry and threw in comments every now and then which reminded me of Chelsea with a mix of ...hm. Gabe? Yes, there we go. Izra, on the other hand, was very upbeat, talking, asking me what I liked and turned out we already had a lot in common. She loves to color, her sister loves to draw. She loves to RP and loves anime(though she knows considerably a lot more then me). Between all three of them talking I did a lot of switching back and forth, trying to catch everyone's words and had to ask one person who was trying to talk to me&nbsp;or another to pause to hear the other half. The males went off on series or something and Izra and I just kind of continued our own for awhile. She's a really cool chick! Hehe! She got us cookies then and we all had desert, half of my initial food untouched ^^; Izra then tried taking all of the plates as she is used to doing at home and Brennen fled with his plate, I guess feeling bad because, according to them, she took the plates all the time. lol.

So we leave after lunch to walk Brennen to his class and as we're walking down this narrow pathway I jumped off real quick to allow someone through or something and instantly said 'Mew!' Izra then went wide-eyed and meowed back. The guys just looked at us a second but we meowed a few times to one another and just laughed. ""Oh god, they're already best of friends"" Fausto said(I think) XD. I did then&nbsp;what I normally do and took hold of one of Izra's back pack ornaments to make sure I don't get lost(truely it's just something cute) and when I turned it over, it was a CardCapture Sakura in her normal outfit with the skates and Kero. ""EEEEEEEE!!!!!"" She jumped and went protective over it, lol. Then we were coming up another pathway when Izra was talking about artwork. Luckily I had my doodle book and when I showed her Fausto was like, ""You're a furre?"" I went nuts. ""HOMGZYOUKNOWFURRE?!?!ILOVEYOU!!!!"" and upon that Izra and Brennon quickly stepped back and were like 'NOOOO!!' because apparently saying 'I love you' to Fausto means you want to worship him and it gets to his head or something. ""I didn't mean it like that!!!' Bah!
After dropping Brennon off we headed over to the library for Izra to print out math homework and such and to wait for her sister, Ala, I think. We all headed upstairs after printing and sat around a column(which I was all EEEE about because there were tables around but they still sat aroung the column) and we all chatted about whatever. I loved this. I was wasting away the two hours between class with some people I just met acting as if I knew them forever. Ala came and we all skipped over to Art and Gaia and what not. Ala was amazed with my own artwork complimenting that I had different poses compared to her ^^; I was flattered. Photoshop, deviant art, the works! I know this stuff! ^-^ Eeee!! OHMG and in my artbook there's one picture of girl on girl action. When Ala came across it she was like 'Eee! Yuri!' and I was like HOMg You KNOW YURI! XD!! I just fell in love with the sisters from that point on. They were kind, very cute, and just all around great. Fausta didn't have much in the conversation but he listened and offered what he could =)

"event","Ugh. Set my alarm clock for 9:30 but was woken up earlier then that due her own alarm clock on the opposite side of the room from our beds bleeping that loud, annoying sound they make. It takes her awhile to wake up, too, so it was going for a little while until she climbed down from the top bunk to shut it off. Went back to sleep. The next awakening was to excess typing on a laptop. I placed my head between the two pillows and rolled over. Then I heard scrounging around in a draw for a whole two minutes. This bothered me. The stuff she was shifting around I was asking ""WAHT THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?"" when I realized this chick has entirely too much crap. I mean every piece of the room she owns she has it with somethng or another and it's filled to whatever capacity it has including the closet with all of her shoes. Oiy.. I hardly fill anything and actually have to search for stuff to put in places with room left over for I didn't even know there was a place behind your bed to store stuff until she was commenting about how she was unable to put her alarm clock behind her bed because whenever she opened that slot for her stuff she'd unplug it... Honestly now... and I think she still has more stuff at home. Woof.

Diverting away from how I was awoken and my room mate all together who truely is a sweet character yet underhandly passivly devious..no, here's my other story explaining my description of her. I wake up, come to my computer, she heads off to class. Not five minutes later I get a call from her asking to run her key/card down to her. Granted, it is important..but I have yet to use my power to ask her for stuff except taking out the garbage once since she was on her way anyway.. So I left the room open for the stealing cause it was going to be a quick trip in my barefeet and no bra, went to the elevator, and waited. And waited. Gah those things are annoying in the morning since everyone and their grandma are trying to get out of the towers.. but when it opened sure enough there must of been 9 bodies in there already(wasn't looking really). ""Mornin' folks!"" I chirpped, a slight laugh in the background as I stepped into the last bit of space in there. Went down, found her with a cheerleader friend Ally(I am assuming) and came back up. Not too bad, just am a bit annoyed with the mornings being woken up from her shifting her crap around or whatever. Thinking of getting ear plugs..but then how&nbsp;am I to hear my own alarm clock? I understand now that she ulimatly has the mornings and I have the night shift of who gets what rest as I am usually up typing on the computer whenever she's trying to sleep. And, granted, my keyboard is quite noisey with every key making me want to switch it out already for the one at home or a new one..or the one at home since I know that one is quiet. Wonder if that's just because it is worn down... Who knows.

Anyway, yesterday. Yesterday was just a fabulous day. Not because of any significant event, but because of the weather. I was amazed with how beautiful it was outside so I just had to take advantage of it. Now, on Tuesdays&nbsp;I have about 4 complete&nbsp;hours between Math and Anthropology, 3 of which I spend out in the sun. Ah, it was lovely... I headed out of my dorm about 2:30 on the note of, well, taking advantage of the day and went for the large body of water we have at the campus with man made artifacted waterfalls and those other nifty deals which blow water into the air to a certain height and let it fall from there like..a giezer? Layed out on the grass at first with my music and Anthro notes since we have a test on Thursday. There were others out there reading, doing work, and just admiring the beauty of the campus.

Chris just called..hehe, love talking to that guy &lt;3 I got to go though and get dressed/eatbreakfast/go to library to print out paper again. Was going to go to the cafeteria but typed up this post instead. Alright! Ciao!"

Dicipline, something which is needed with a busy schedule...something that is needed upon lacking a busy schedule. I find myself to have only a bit of this in the sense of actually sitting down to read or write though the writing is lacking at the current time. It's difficult for me to begin..but, that's just it.

Just got out of english and my next class is at 2-5 and it'll be that family development shit because I couldn't get into a history @_@ Carol is going to help me get into the class I want next semester...ahh, it's good to have helpful sisters =) Speaking of which..today woke up at 7 and arrived to the gym quite early. Called up Carol and she said she'd be there in 15 so I talked to JEremy for a good 30 minutes and finally walked in and found her there @_@ oiy... Anyway she gave me some work out clothing since they don't allow denim and that makes me happy that I now can go at my own leisure without any person telling me I can't *shakes fist* and and and whee! ^-^ Mac and cheese is done! ...HOTT!!! *runs around in circles* @_@;;

Alright so today we swam and went into the sana which made me feel like jello coming out and it was awesome. I love the showers there..MUCH better then the showers here! Found my new place to bathe &gt;.&gt; .. Whee!

Other then getting stuff together I've really just been in my dorms. Have no friends that go here to go chill in their rooms and I havn't seen Britt and have only seen this chick I knew in gym at Ridge and and...that's it o.O; I saw Narmeen at one point but either she ignored me or didn't see me and, well, other then that, no one. Everyone went to the San Antonio school just to get out of Houston or went to UT or out of the state.. talk about starting over. So far me and my room mate have gotten along pretty well. I find it kind of weird she has pictures of just her by herself on the wall of her bed and everything but, hey, use to it from Ingrid who had a whole shrine of herself, lol. It really just was senior pictures but whatever.

Hmm...I got nothing really. Going to do some reading for Anthropology and the next few chapters in English.. I have a math test tomorrow she's giving us to see if we actually belong in the class or not.. Makes me kind of nervous since I can't get to the book online and though I knew a lot of what she put up on the overhead I'm not too confident in my ability and I want to take the practice test but the damn website wont let me get in there and agh! x_x; maybe it'll come up today...
Hmm.. mmm Jalapeno pringles.

One thing is there is a LOT of walking involved and with one of the elevators is out so I have to go up the stairs 6 floors up and down..kind of annoying.
Yesterday someone pulled the fire alarm or someone was smoking in their room so everyone came down the stairs, waited in the lobby for 7-8 minutes, and were allowed to go back to their rooms. Today someone in my math class asked the most hated question, ""What are we going to be using this stuff for in the future?"" My teacher got all passionate about math while the rest of the class growled at him for asking such question. I mean, common, what are we in? Middleschool? If you havn't figured out that you'll need whatever you learn ...

I could take a picture of all of her areas as I say she takes up about 3/4ths of the room but, eh, I don't need that much space to begin with and I love how it's setted up and everything and I'm comfortable and happy with where I am =) Plus!

I LOVED waking up this morning in my soft bed and getting my internet up and EVERYTHING without anyone telling me to do so. I love this independent idea so far. Going around and getting things done without depending on another person to drive you there or anything and talking to people that help me and direct me and having my shit together..oh it's so nice ^-^ It's a freedom I've been craving..and I love it.<br /><br />First class is at 11 and that's my EARLIEST class of my schedule..this makes me happy because I can chill in my dorm the first part of the morning and since I only have one class today I can chill the rest of the day, look around campus when it isn't muggy hot, and hopefully go to the gym today. =)<br /><br />Life is good.</p>"

"event","First off I'll put our shopping adventure. Friday me, mom, Ingrid and Jesse all went out to the mall for tax-free weekend. While Ingrid went to Pac Sun me and Jesse hurled towards Foleys thinking maybe we'd spot Brittani. No sign of her but I did find a lot of pants! I stocked up..holy jesus did I stock up. I have like 5 pairs of blue jeans now and one nice khaki pants. I got a tank top there and this striped shirt and then we headed over to Target for undergarments. Got like, 5 pairs of bras and underwear and was just like ""I don't EVER want to do this again. Getting it right the first time."" Atleast, that was my train of thought.. haha. I duno..maybe I should of gotten different kind of pants instead of just blue jeans...mehhh! Clothes arn't cheap and I really don't care all too much =D I'd go naked but...well..we all know about that. Yar.

Moving on...

Dad broke the garage just before going to Tulsa. We get person to fix it over here and they said we needed two feet of space. If you have seen my garage you would know that it is cluttered as all hell...well...was.
Took a major toll on it yesterday thanks to Miegel over here and my sweetie. Both of their help combined with me and my siblings got more then three feet of space. Plus, we had an excellent time together. Going down memory lane and all with all the shit out there, hehe.

Anyway, other then that I went to the UH campus last Friday with Jeremy and got everything straightened out for classes. Talked to this councler that looked a lot like Mr. Knock(I miss him) and when I got out of there Jeremy was like, ""Damn he looked like Mr. Knock."" lol. Yep yep.. I had to take the acuplacer in reading though as it turned out I should of taken both the writing AND reading on the THEA when I took it...ahh well... It's all good because I got to take the accuplacer which wasn't 40 questions with reading long stories..instead I got 20 questions of short excerpts of like 5 sentences each =D

So yeah, signed up for college now, will start packing this weekend, and moving in the 17th. Class starts on the 22nd I think. Really excited about all of this now that I have it all figured out. Chris, you'll be proud =P Signed up for Anthropology. Muwahaha. Unfortunatly I didn't get everything quick enough so I had to sign up for this other class that'd count under some core instead of history because all the histories were filled up. Bah, I'll keep checking to see if I can switch into a history class..do NOT want to do polotics! Not yet, at least...

Anyway. Yesterday Jeremy was over most all of the day and it really made me happy to see him getting along with everyone. Ingrid was thankful he was here and Jesse had another person to 'shoot the shit with' or whatever. Hehe, us three played Halo on the computers and were yelling at eachother across the house. So much cursing went on yesterday from moving shit and having crap fall over and yelling at one another on Halo.

We now have an automatic garage door opener deal. Infact, we just had the whole thing replaced so now we have a white garage that makes our house 'look like a cup cake', according to Jesse. Hehe..It looks weird.

Can't wait for college!

"event","So last night my sisters and I left the house around 8 for this guy Jason's party (Carol and Ingrid's friend). We got to the appartments and when Ingrid calls him he asks us to stop off by the stores for cups. Carol picked up a pack of Smirnoff ice while we were at it and we headed back to the appartments. What I noticed first about the place is that it had a pool with little sprayer deals that shot four streams of water towards the middle of the pool. That was cool!
Upon entering the house though I grew shy of all the people, standing off to the big near-empty alcove they had where only a workout bike was while everyone was in the kitchen and living room. They were all friendly people though. The people on the couch were talking about their jobs and engineering and what-have-you and the people around the kitchen I wasn't paying much attention to.
Carol had already made her way into the crowd, Ingrid off to the side greeting the people she knew and was comfortable with. I just stood there, watching. Carol waved me over then, telling the birthday boy his goal of the night was to make me socialable (he failed, by the way, lol) but what I noticed about this guy was that not only was his head bald, but he had an egg shaped head. I was like, EEEE! And wanted to rub it all through the night, lol. XD Yeah, I'm a dork.
Ingrid was only allowed one drink a hour according to Carol so she kept asking me if the hour was up. ""Woman, I am not going to keep track of you,""&nbsp;I told her. I got a Smirnoff Ice then from Carol...woof I'm a lightweight. After that ONE whimpy drink I felt 100 lbs heavier. I leaned back on my palms and it felt like so much weight I had to just lean back against the wall. So yeah, from there I was done for the night with alcohol at the time, the effects wearing off by the time I got home at like 10:30 and ate lots of food. Did NOT want to have the episode of last time.. &gt;&lt;

So we waited around the house and this chick named Lauren showed up. Now, Lauren is a VERY old friend of Carol's as they went to the same Bane Elementary and Lauren lived right around the corner from us. Apparently the chick found Carol on FaceBook and wanted to hang out. Hehe. We then waited for Andy-man to show up so we could all go. When he did we had to clean out his car but eventually got out on the road and headed out towards Katy.
Entering the neighborhood me and Lauren were just like 'WOOOOWWWWWW' because the houses there were frickin HUGEEE!! OMG they were BIG. ""Yeah I own a house over here.. in my dreams!"" -Lauren
So we get there, BIG house with lots of cars out front. I'm unsure that it would end up like the last party where I'd just stand there but upon entering the house I was in another world. Me and Ingrid instantly sneaked off then, taking our own little tour of the ji-normous place when the owner Chris caught us, giving us a tour instead =D So..lemme see if I can explain this house. We came into a small kitchen with a tiny living room off to the left with stairs on the left leading up to the 2nd floor. Straight ahead was a dinning rom and the backdoor to the outside where a pool was. Small. Off to our RIGHT, however, it was a WHOLE different story. The short hallway deviding the small from the big lead into this grand dinning room with the long table and several seats placed out making it to where all it needed was a stuffed pig in the middle. There were china cabnits with these beautiful dishes and fine china and this guy sat down at the head of the table, ""Where is my dinner?"" he asked all polietly.. I think he had a few in him. Actually, at that point, everyone already there had a few in them. Next we came to this bigger living room with a step-down bar attached to it. The bar was white marble and had poper-ey in a bowl and the guy Chris was explaining the different things there, grunting/coughing about a bit of it letting us all know some of what he was saying was BS. lol. I wandered to the living room's pictures at that time, tuning his different countries named out. They had this interesting painting over their mantle though I can't remember exactly what it was of.. anyway. attached to the living room was finally the entrance of the house, a picture from 'the old country' spotted and finally I noticed Chris' accent. Things from India and other countries was all in there, dolls placed in a glass case, what his mother made. They were beautiful and skulpted so well. So fragile... Anyway, there were TWO walk in closets, one on each side of the door and off to the left was this study filled with books and other family things. He wanted to respect his family's privacy then and so we headed up the second set of stairs in their house, it was a winding staircase. I was like =D!! Upstairs was a small hallway with rooms off to the left that I didn't go into. In the middle there was this beautiful dresser from some country or another. ""Is there anything in it?"" Chris: ""Well yes.. if you'd look in this drawer *opens, nothing* I mean this drawer *opens, still nothing* Well we use to store tapes in them."" Someone: ""Naughty tapes?"" Chris: ""Correct, naughty tapes.""
lol. Next we came into Chris' room..it was HUGE! He had a small bed on the furthest wall filled with..plushies!! =D He had a computer off the side and a dresser and more room then one could need! Then attached to it was a bathroom that as so big I didn't know what to do with myself. It was a long bathroom and felt uncomfortable to have the toilet in the middle of it but..it was interesting. There was then a wall that devided the hallway after getting out of Chris' room that made you round the hallway before finding two more bedrooms but if you went straight you'd get into another big spot where a foozeball table was and a pretty nice flat screen TV and 2 couches, a recliner, and a talbe near the window with a nifty chess set all setted up and another alcove with nothing in it. The place was so big and they didn't have enough stuff to put in it, lol. Also the stairs I mentioned in the kitchen lead up to the area of the fooze ball table, completing the house. I'm sure there's some more rooms I didn't know about. ""God this house is perfect for hide and seek"" Chris: ""Yeah, a game can go on for hours"" lol.

So then Andy was like 'Fooze ball!' and these two guys stepped up and Lauren and this other chick took the other side. Those girls rocked. I think actually Andy was playing that round but the girls were getting all into it, the table moving all around, lol. Carol: &nbsp;""Common girls, use your assests!"" The two nicely-shaped boob girls pulled down their shirts a little, unbuttoning and tugging giving the other side a nicceee view, lol...but interestingly enough their minds were kept on the game. lol, probably because they were losing.
The girls got all excited about winning and kicked the guys asses! Then the next pair stepped up against them and they lost too =D I loved the girls from that point on, lol.
When I stepped up with Andy against Ingrid and this other guy I was goalie, x_x; big mistake. 2 easy scores were scored by the other two before I gave up, running down the stairs. Andy: ""But I need you!""&nbsp;Me: ""No! You'll lose with me!""

Oh god..thinking of this part my throat just begins to burn. Alright so I walked in from outside at one point to get a cookie and this guy was standing at this counter thing in the middle of the kitchen. ""Hello friend I'm Josh""
""Ah yes, I've met you, I'm Cheryl""
""Cheryl! You must try this. This is the good stuff"" Or somewhere along those lines...
""No, thanks. I had enough tonight.""
""Oh common!"" Something about college and how he graduated from it already and I needed to learn or whatever the fuck. He poured two shots of Jack Danials. ""Alright now you have to try this."" A girl comes up behind him and wraps her arms around him, looking to me, ""I have known the man for 8 years. I wouldn't trust him."" Josh: ""Trust me Cheryl.."" He tilts his head to the side a bit. Hm. Alright. He makes a toast, we clink the glasses, and I drink it down straight thinking it wouldn't hurt. .....
THAT SHIT BURNED! AGGHHH! *gags* Josh: ""Baby"" and I growled, saying I was a lightweight while throwing water down my throat. That was that for the night with the alcohol I decided and proceeded to try to get the horrible taste out of my mouth. Carol called me stupid and I should of chased the alcohol with coke.. How the hell was I supposed to know?!

lol..so yeah. Let's make the rest of this entry shorter, shall we? There was swimming, drunks already in the pool and everyone was just over all friendly. Carol was having a ball with eveyone she was with and Ingrid was socializing and all, making friends. I, on the other hand, wandered around more, swimming and what not. ""Going to put clothing on."" ""Can I come?"" ""Sure."" *wanders into the bathroom wth guy following her and standing right in the bathroom.* ""Huh o.o well...I'm shy about my body so nu!"" ""Thought so *steps out of the bathroom*"" ""What would you have done?"" ""Would of stood right there."" *glare playfully and shut the door* xD Eesh.

Alright now me and Andy went upstairs and played chess and in the middle of it all we could hear was Carol downstairs outside, ""Ingrid get the camera!"" Lol, I think the whole house heard her she was so loud. ""Ingrid the camera!"" rofl. Ingrid came up at one point, ""Alright guys I'm ready for the game--"" Holding a good 5 beers in her hands with cups. She turned the corner of the stairs, looked at us, looked down to the contents she was holding. ""Oh! You see nothing!"" hurries down the stairs. lmao.
After the game we headed down and Carol was the life of the party I'd say. She was smokin' a cuban cigar and was all relaxed and her and Lauren were just best friends. Actually last night I heard a LOT of comments I usually hear from my own friends. ""Carol, you're just in your own category."" ""Only Carol can do that and get away with it."" ""Only Carol would grab a girl's boobs."" *laughs* Awh, I miss my friends.. ._.

Heh, so Ingrid was playing this ping ball game with 6 cups of beer on each side and have to get the ball in for the other person to drink whenever the ball goes in. Weird game, that. It was like 2:45 in the morning at this point and Andy had work at 10. Carol was getting an accent and was just as relaxed as could be. ""I smoke this then we go."" Andy agreed and gave her til 3:20 to smoke it. Lauren was swimming in the pool and had became Carol's woman within a span of a night, lol. ""You can have this if you get out of the pool Lauren,"" she said all persuasivly, giving the girl a puff before she agreed to get out and dry off. Went back inside and within the next 15 minutes I lost Carol only to find her in the ja-cuzi. ""Carol! you're supposed to be drying off!"" ""I go where my women go"" she said, voice accented with something of Jamacin or something..it was just hillarious. Ender's feet were on her shoulders and this other guy who didn't drink was in there giving Lauren a massage. It was just too funny listening to Carol. ""We get out when half smoke is gone."" ""But it is half"" ""No no. It half here,"" she says, hand doing karate chop a half of inch up where she is. Oiy. Persuasive/
We were like whatever and I made rounds, checking up on Ingrid who was playing Foozeball now. Some guy stopped me when coming down stairs and motioned me over to the kitchen. ""Hey Stojan! Your sister's uncle makes statues, right?"" xD ""Yeah, our great uncle David"" Then he talked about Carol and how he met her she randomly popped up in the conversation of Sam Houston statue or something saying her uncle did it and disappeared. lol, that's Carol. He said he saw the 50 presidents head and was like 'wtf' but was interested in that it was our uncle who did it ...or..something. lol, I don't have a great memory.

Anyway we finally made it out of there by 3:30, got home about 4 something and Lauren and Andy went home and we all crashed here, Ender included.
=D that was a fun night and today Lauren, her boyfriend, Andy, and me and my sisters are all going to see Clerks! =D Can't waiiiittttt!!! Oh this night will be fun!

ooohhh! And AND! HOMG. The Lauren chick there reminded me SOOOOO much of Val! holy Crap! She looked like her with short, boobs, face..I was like, ""Woah o.o"" Ingrid took pictures last night so maybe I will be able to post up Lauren' s picture versus Val's. AND this chick acted like Valice =D I was like 'Do you have realitives or something?' She was SOO nice and just Val all the way around &lt;3 Though I don't think Val drinks..o.o; Anyway this chick's boyfriend is flying in today and it'll be the first time she's seen him in 3 years thanks to the marines or whatever he's in for the country. She was soo excited last night about seeing him. Apparently they knew eachother for 5 years and only been dating for 48 hours before he left for his 3 year deal.

Yeah.. =D End!"

"event","Well the title is completly pointless but the song was on!

So yes! Yesterday I went with Audry, James, Tanna, and Justing to the SOAD concert! It was awesome!
The warm up bands started at 6:30 so when we got there it was hot and the sun was still out and it just wasn't any fun. So we got settled on the lawn in the middle of the stage area. First thing I saw (and remember) was Patrick from school walking by, lol. Second thing I remember was looking for Travis down the steps(That little guy is EVERYWHERE I swear! Jesse and Justin ran into him a week prior at a pool hall!) and didn't find him until later when I was with Tanna. He pounced her, swung her around, and dipped. He was wearing eyeliner or some form of girlie make up around his eyes. That's Travis for ya, lol.

""What's he wearing so I can find him?""
""Black.""
""But they're all wearing black!""

There were mothers with their children, fathers with their kids, a geek sitting not too far away from us with some friends and his mother sitting behind them. He wasn't really talking with the friends much and I just wanted to go over and give him a hug or start talking..but Aud and James said that she'd probably&nbsp;shoo me away @_@ Meh! He talked later to them though so that made me happy :)
So yeah. First band that came on I really liked though wasn't sure if they were singing English&nbsp; or some other language but the music was oddly very pretty. The next few after that I didn't know and didn't care to know but the third was pretty cool. I think it was during the second band the guys started getting rowdey right next to us and there was this HUGE mosh.&nbsp;
James gave me his phone and told me to capture anything on his 15 second tape. lol, well that was awesome timing cause not 10 seconds afterwards I started recording and that was when all the guys started charging down the hill into other guys causing a massive pile up, lol. I was sitting there front row holdnig out the phone kind of scared it'd come closer towards me..but it didn't =P Holy crap that was a lot of bodies flying, lol.
Before the final band came on we were sitting and talking, Audry drinking some form of ice'd margarita I think it was (It was nummy either way) and Tanna drinking a mix of margarita and strawberry dackori(sp? and also nummy), when this guy came around and started shaking our hands saying 'Thanks for coming' XD Ahh...drunks &lt;3

Anyway around 9:30? or something SOAD finally came on, the crowd pumping up instantly whenever the lights blacked out. They started out with some of their newer songs and slowly worked their way back to the songs I knew. BYOB, Aerials, Chop Suey, all that happy stuff they played as well as a few others I know by sound but not by name, lol. Oh! And the cock one! That was AWESOME! Everything quiet and calm when the lead says slowly, ""My cock is bigger then yours"" Tanna and I just looked at eachother and bursted out laughing.. I think she was buzzed or tipsy or whatever after that one drink but she's a lightweight :D And so am I! but didn't have a lot of alcohol to screw myself up in any way. But yes. Audry left in the middle of it to sit down and James shortly followed afterwards leaving me, Justin, and Tanna. Moshes began again then and Tanna and I kept moving around Justin trying to not get hit and use him as our shield, lol. There were a few girls in the moshes..tiny things but they seemed to hold themselves well and when one fell down the others quickly came to the rescue. Hehe..
So yeah..James told me before the concert that it wasn't a sold out show. He thinks it's because at their last concert they began fighting on stage(with words) and what not..Me and Audry were like, ""COOL!"" but anyway.. They made this announcment. ""There's been rumor that we are to break up. But us four up here will always be System of a Down."" This got the crowd roaring, lol. Anyway...during the slow songs(which were quite nice) we didn't have lighters so we held up our cell phones, lol. *dorks* :D

So hum...After the concert was over we found Audry and James who told us there were people almost boinking on the side of the hill and she heard a condom start to open but a security guy flashed his light at them. That's just great, sex at a concert.
So yeah..left from there and on the way home I found it rather relaxing. One, because I was no longer sitting on ANTS. and 2, because she was going fast(gee, who would of guessed?) and we had the windows down and it felt so nice.. Love car rides, lol. Just one more reason to give me the dog title.

Got home at 12 exactly and that was that.

""Drunks that wont remember anything tomorrow, loud music,&nbsp;friends, and grass.. What more could you&nbsp;want?""

Peace."

"event","-Braces. Got the bracket glued back on and tightening hurts and got the frickn' bands on my molars now which the right side digs into my gum every time I chew something(luckily it has only been tested on a piece of bread) Plus it feels weird to swallow lately..like..half of my throat is in use only or some kind of minute pain underlying when swallowing.

-Ants. Was on the phone and sat down on my bed to find an ant on my top pillow. Low and behold on the bottom pillow there is a whole lot of them. On my bear, on the sheets, on the wall and on the windowsill. Sprayed those bitches down, gathered up all my sheets and threw them promptly into the wash.

-Shit. My sister brought home her kitten and it figures our house to be its litter box. I was doing laundry and stepped in the crap on the floor not noticing the first time because hands were full. The second time I quickly washed, picked up the shit, was thoroughly disgusted and took a shower.

-Neighbor. Yen was over and was her loud, normal self. I love her and all but geez didn't need her to come in saying that I had low self esteem like my mother and telling me straight up that Jeremy was ugly showing just how shallow she is. I love her, I do..but...god..

-Brother. Not 20 minutes ago the kitten and Tom were in my bed playing when Jesse came up to feed them a piece of meat. Food when I had ants in here earlier! Ugh! The kittens were winding down at the time and he HAD to give them food. Got the kitten hyped up and Tom awake and then he took them away.

-iPod. It wont turn off. Doing everything right and it still wont turn off. Edit. Jesse got it to turn off. Joy to the world! I'm going to bed... *mutters incoherent words*

Screw this night!"

"event","So I got braces today. >_< God fucking..agghhhh.

First of all went out with Marcus to the mall where I got Scrabble and Chess since I like those games and wanted something entertaining and had to be back home before 3 for dentist appointment. No problem.

We get to the dentist and my dad leaves. I settle in the chair when this asian lady puts this plaster stuff in a mouth-shapped deal and molds it with my bottom teeth. I just looked at her while sitting there, drooling and kind of scared. ""You hate me?"" she asks almost playfully and I shook my head, eyes skipping back and forth around the room to her while I wait for the crap to get off my teeth. Horrible taste. She takes it away and gets out the sucker thing that became my best friend with all the crap built up in my mouth. Then she goes for the top teeth. I had to instantly lean forward and try not to gag as the crap tried to go to down my throat. T_T; ""It's almost over, it's almost over"" I kept reminding myself...

Next she started donig some other stuff and my head kept turning with what she was doing until Dr. Ho came in. She pried my mouth apart with this red tool deal that hurt slightly and was annoying and held my lips apart and mouth open just enough for them to do their job. I wasn't happy about it this but trusted them.
Then they put the little metal deals along my teeth which was a long process and then the wire and agghhhh... Metal mouth. *cries*

Dad said we'd get soft things I can eat but I can't even close my mouth..only one tooth hits the bottom and some teeth are crazily sensative to anything due to, I think, the water she kept spraying.. @_@;; Dad also got pizza..took 3 small bites and couldn't chew them so settled for applesauce and pudding for dinner. T-T

Can't stop messing with them. Keep running my tongue over them and some parts are pointy on the right and my mouth is getting torn up because I can't keep my mouth still. Just so weird..agh."

"event","It's been good so far! Kicked back the first week, babysitting the second week(this week), played D&D last weekened over at Gryff's and though I made a total idiot out of myself brought everyone into the RP spirit @_@; eh heh...

Anyway! Doing it again this weekend if all goes well *hopes* and though I'm nervous about it can't wait to see what will happen next! ^^ Carol said she use to play it as a dwarve or gnome who hit people over the head o.O; Sounds just like her, lol.

Anyway! Tomorrow I might get to see Jeremy :) BIG hurray because after hearing his message I realized how much I had missed him and and and orientation in a few weeks and tomorrow the pool with Ingrid and maybe Arthur and Sean(the kid I'm babysitting) And Heather hasn't been home and I feel like my mind is rotting as I can't seem to type up a decent post anymore!

Need start excercising more..damn food tasting so good x_x;;

The family is back home from Mississippi and I'm happy because I get to see them again and I suddenly want the peanut butter crunch cereal and want to go to sleep so I can be closer to having such food...o.o; Wtf? lol.

Started a puzzle today of a dragon and wizard..didn't even get the frame finished @_@; patience span too low for puzzles though I do enjoy them..when the peieces are all out. woof. Uhmm..hmm..other then that they have a trampoline and now I just want to jump, lol. May just do that for a long while in the morning if it isn't too hot...damn Houston sun..

Oh yeah! Also started playing Kingdom Hearts 2 and JUST got Sora after 5 hours of playing @_@; It's sad because it shows clips from the first one and I'm like, ""That happened?!"" because, well, I never actually completed a game fully..the closest I've been was FFX and me going back to it is like 'what was I doing again?' because I was on the last boss but was in a cave and yadda yadda yadda.. Hmm..I even got to the point where I thought games had no endingwhen I was a kid because I never finished one, lol. Sad, no?

Hmm..since I'm ranting about random stuff. Pool. That kid has beaten me at it quite a few times now. WEll...it's a mini pool table with crappy sticks that hurt whenever they scratch against the green but I've beaten him a few times at it! *shakes fist!* Other then that in KH2 they kept eating those damn popsicles which made me crave it and luckliy they had those rocket ones so we ate them and played more pool. He won but I didn't care ^^

Glad that Heather is out of the house for now..just me and Sean and hopefully we can do more. planning to go to the pool, that'll be fun.

Hmm..what else am I going to do? I want to go to this new thing called college, damnit. Chris seems to be living it up over there and he has only been there for like 4 days! Then again..it's in Austin. He says everything tastes sweeter there..interesting. I wonder if everywhere things taste different. Anyway, back to my point. College. Different and out of the house and surrounded by new people..new, loud, annoying people @_@; God I hope my roommate is no where NEAR Ingrid's in the sense of using her silverwear and other stuff and not cleaning or raising a finger to help clean any of it @_@; Hopefully my roommate will be uber thin or fat..that way I don't have to share clothing <3 and I can bite their fingers off or yell at them to do their own dishes and stuff..whee. Hehehe...but next year I get to live in an appartment with Ingrid and possibly Brittani! How cool is that?! =3 I'm excited even if I'm afraid of college and it kicking my butt because I can't study worth crap nor take notes and listen at the same time..it's one or another, people! Even then i'm more listening because I don't reread my notes and NOT a multitasker @_@;;; Oh god..

Been playing Sanctuary over and over again..whee <3
And Val's entry is right..where's the old disney movies where they broke out into song and dance/actual morals? @_@;; I actully was talking with marcus about that a few months ago and he was like, ""You're right"" or something. Bastard got a brand new laptop in a backpack for his graduation! lol, talk about subject switching. Hehehe...

Okay well I'm going to crash *hears the cheers* o.o;; I love you, too!! *flops off to bed*"

"event","Hehe..well that was memeberable. Traffic, lots of it. Cell phone picked up by evil people. Being rushed to my spot when I waited a good 10 minutes before we moved anywhere so the rush was for nothing and the cell could of been saved by someone else >_<; Uhm...bouncing around and batting at the tassel like a kitten, hurt the girl's ears next to me..

Went up to the platform and started doing the anime dance and people thought I was going to break the platform-ramp thing we were on. Everyone was nervous, I was hyper. Audry told me while going by not to trip and then Chris warned me not 2 minutes later, lol. Instead though I bounced my way across the stage and there's proof! I wonder if I can get it on here..heard it was entertaining, lol. Woo... Well made that memerable for myself because I was skippin'/bouncing and people said they had fun watching. Woo...hehehe...

Went to Sonic afterwards. probably go out another day but dun need it.

I got a lot from everyone..I love them all and very thankful for them..

It was a good night. I'm out of this portion of my life..thank god. (I say that now..wonder what it'll be like in 4 years..heh..)

"event","okay, so I had a really good day today.  I went to work, and found out that I actually wasn't supposed to be there, but they really needed me, so it was wonderful.  I got alot of organizing done and did a really good job of training the new girl.  Then when I got home I went for a long walk, bought my dad's holiday present, had gelato (mmmmmmm) and bought myself some books.  It was so beautiful outside and felt so nice to get out there.  When I got home I sat and watched all of my shows.  I tried, I laughed, sigh.... why do boys have to suck so much. And why does loving someone have to be so hard.  

This was fun:

I'll just past the stuff because that way it is easier for you guys to read.... right?
<b>Current Situation</b>
Unable to exert the effort to achieve her objectives. Feels neglected, desiring greater security, warm affection, and fewer problems.<br>

<b>Your Stress Sources</b>
Wishes to be independent, unhampered, and free from any limitation or restriction, other than those which she imposes of herself or by her own choice and decision.

<b>Your Restrained Characteristics</b>
Believes that she is not receiving her share--that she is neither properly understood nor adequately appreciated. Feels that she is being compelled to conform, and close relationships leave her without any sense of emotional involvement.
Trying to calm down and unwind after a period of over-agitation which has left her listless and devoid of energy. In need of peace and quiet; becomes irritable if this is denied him.

<b>Your Desired Objective</b>
Wants interesting and exciting things to happen. Able to make herself well-liked by her obvious interest and by the very openness of her charm. Over-imaginative and given to fantasy or day-dreaming.

<b>Your Actual Problem</b>
Seeks to avoid criticism and to prevent restriction of her freedom to act, and to decide for herself by the exercise of great personal charm in her dealings with others."

"event","So.... I haven't posted in about a months time.  I've had some really good days and some really bad days.  I thought I was doing better with things, then my birthday and surgery came and I was worse then I've been in a really long time.  In general I'm not happy, and I have a hard time looking towards the future because of what I have to deal with on a day to day basis.  I just want to fall asleep and wake up in a couple years, and while i'm asleep, finish my degree, meet the new boy of my dreams, start on home dialysis, and make lots of new friends.  I'm sure there is more that I want, but I can't think of it right now.  My surgery went fine, but was really hard to deal with because dave was completely out of the picture.  He really doesn't want anything to do with me anymore, and unfortunately he still makes me smile and I love him unconditionally.  That is another reason I want to just fall asleep and not wake up for a very long time, so that I can get over him.  It's easy for him to get over me, because he has a new relationship, and doesn't spend time hooked up to a machine prolonging the agony.  No one gets how hard it is.  I thought he did, but not anymore.  Whether it's Tash brain washing him, or him purposely trying to forget about it, he doesn't remember what it was like, and he has turned into the complete opposit person to who I dated.  He used to get so mad at my friends for not being there to support me if he was really busy or going away, and now he isn't there at all.  I want to stop loving him, and caring about him, but I can't.  I love him unconditionally.  No matter how long I don't talk with him, or see him, I still love him.  When we were together I was happy for once in my life.  I felt safe, and secure, and that I could handle anything with his support.  Now I feel completely lost, and like I can't handle anything.  This is my analage, I hope you like it.

I've been climbing a mountain for around 15 years now.  I became an adult and became fairly independent during that time.  However, my back pack constantly got heavier and more unwieldie as the days and years went on.  I could never see the top.  Then one day when I looked up, I thought I say the top.  I was given a new hope and spirit.  Someone came along and took my back pack and would help me carry it when I couldn't manage and together we climbed the mountain.  Then one day that person left, and the cloud that was making it look like the end was insight moved and showed that the end was no where in sight.  I was once again alone, with all of the stuff piled on my back, and even more then when he first came.  I had no idea how to carry everything, and couldn't imagine making it to the top.  I wanted to give up, and some days I did.  Some days a cloud would come and make it look like I was close to finishing, and some days a friend would come by for a couple hours and take a handful, but only a handful of stuff from my back.  I've got no idea how to continue, and no one knows what to say to help me.  This is where i'm at in my life and I've got no ideas left as to what to do."

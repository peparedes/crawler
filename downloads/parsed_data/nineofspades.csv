"event","I'm going ahead and responding to Jesse here, in my own journal, because I realized that what I have to say to him, I want everyone to know. I'll probably tell you each this again when I talk to you, but here it is so there's no confusion.

Each and every one of you means a lot to me. I don't know who of you out there still considers me friend, but I don't stop caring about people once I do. That being said, I have nothing of my own. I'm not a child anymore, and not having the means to support myself by myself, to not be my own free-standing entity, is not how I want things to be. I don't like it, and obviously it makes all of you think I'm an asshole who doesn't want to be around you. 

Here's where you're confused. No outside forces dictate what I do. Anything I do. Admittedly, I'm guilty of becoming very reactionary to a point where I often do restrain myself and look to others for action.  But if I stay in because I can't use the car, because my parents don't want me out, because they don't want people over, it's not because I'm helpless to it, it's because I've made a choice to stay with them,  and just like anyone else who lived in a house with two people who both had jobs and paid the bills and bought all the food and paid for every expense necessary, but did not contribute, I'm not going to use their things like they are mine.  (that is a hell of a compound sentence.) Because they aren't.

You all know damn well that if I was paying the bills at this place any one of you would be welcome pretty much any fucking time. If I had a car, gas money, I'd gladly meet you anywhere. If I had spending money, I'd gladly go do things and help you if you didn't. The thing is I don't, and it's now that I've got to turn the focus on myself and do what I need to do to be a pillar myself. I can't do that shit overnight, and I really do hate to think of myself before others for some perverse reason I can only explain as me.  But I'm gonna do it, my way.  Sorry if I don't meet your expectations of me, but I can't wear myself out caring. I don't meet my own expectations either at this point.

The reoccuring sad overtones in my entries are because of this.  Not because I'm not in control of it, but because as a result of my choice I've put a lot of distance between me and my friends. But if that's how it is, I'm still comfortable with my choice.

So, I hope that clears things up. I love you guys, I miss all of you. But at this stage of my life, I refuse to spend time chasing after friends who don't even respect me in the first place. I'm still trying to get to where I respect myself, and if I seem preoccupied with something, it's my fantastical daydreaming mind going over what I've got to do to reach that. And that's just how it is. I'm not trying to blame it on anything else, it's not anything else. It's just me. Sorry if anyone was confused.  I'm working on communication, just somewhere along my life I got trapped in my head.  Bear with me, friends.

Or don't. I hate this fact, but at the end of the day I don't need any of you, and I don't want to burden anyone who doesn't like with me with my presence. How's that for no shit?

I can't convince any of you I'm sincere.  But you can always count on me to be sincere and honest.  I hate the person I've become somehow, and it's becoming more and more apparent to me. I'm doing my best to tear that wall down now and put myself out there for everyone again.  If you're willing to come back in, you're more than welcome.  Otherwise, love you.  See you again.



It occurred to me after writing this that it sounds like I do believe I've done something wrong.  And personally, I think I have.  But I don't feel I've wronged any of you by being reserved, because I've still always been real with all of you.

I guess I just forgot how cool I was. Fuck you losers. XP"

"event","I rarely use this to talk about how good everything's going anymore. So while I'm feeling in an optimistic mood, here it is:

Everything's going.

School sucks, but I'm doing it. Work sucks, but I'm gonna find a damn job. Love sucks, but if I care so much I've got to take a stand somewhere.

In other news, two shows coming up with a bluegrass band Moonshine Summit. Not fabulous music or anything, just some people screwing around and having fun.  20th at the Cafe, and a Halloween party the weekend before actual Halloween.

For a long time now I've hated myself. I still do.  But I feel things starting to turn for the better again.  I love the upsides.  Fighting uphill is so much more satisfying than rolling into self-loathing.

Yeah, whatever. If you want my story you know where I am. Happy moments, everyone."

"event","Just when I got everything all fucking figured out, right, something comes along and fucks it all up!

I don't remember a time when I wasn't attracted to at least girls.  As far back as I can remember I've had crushes, silly ass shit I very rarely motivate myself to pursue because even though I can usually pick out those special ones, the idea of actually being with them is now a foreign concept.  Some kind of higher plateau I can't reach because I'm a filthy bastard or too chickenshit loving, whichever it may be.

Often I wish I could erase the part of that craves that companion.  It's a part of me I never knew existed, but the more I look back, the more it becomes apparent that my entire lovelife has been a pussyfooted stumble through the proverbial sea of fishes looking for the one that matches me.  That's not to say I don't sincerely love anyone.  It's just that you can only trust someone who's feelings may not be entirely platonic so far.  No matter how sincere, no matter how much control or just cowardice that person has holding them back from those that don't mean quite as much.  And you can't just pursue a romantic side with everyone you're friends with.  It does sound fun, but it doesn't work past theory.  It's this entirely dramaticised, half-in half-out stupid shit that systematically destroys many of my relationships, platonic and romantic.  Most particularly those special ones, who hurt the most.

That being said, I wouldn't trade this feeling for anything.  I just wish it didn't come with the horrible self-realization.

And I wish it didn't come with a special one."

To the girl who started it all from halfway around the world, and got me busted halfway out of town for trying to get halfway across the country.
To the girl who's still waiting in a winter wonderland.
To the guys who're still lined up next up to me after all these years, I can't thank any of you enough together or apart.
To the man who helped me preserve a piece of me uncorrupted, then left me for the snow.
To the girl who wasted a whole summer chatting with me and is still one of the raddest people I've ever met.
To the boy who wasted a whole summer chatting with me, I hope you're still rad too.
To the girl I'll never stop apologizing to, even if we're never friends again.
To the girls who helped me grip myself and wrestle it back under control, and who keep it that way now.
To my first love, i'll never forget you.
To the only place I've ever really felt at home, and to it's increasingly distant memory.
To the girl who reminded me that love should be fun.
To her best friend, who became one of mine.
To my dream girl, who I'm still chasing in my mind.
To the girl who could've killed me, I wish you hadn't left before I got a chance to tell you.
To the goddess who's beauty could never be summed up in a drunken toast or any other words humans will ever utter, though not for lack of trying.
To my sister, who I'll always love, despite anything.
To my parents for being my friends after all these years.
To my extra parents for setting the example for the rest of the world.
To all the musicians who have added their life to music's, and mine subsequently.
To all the people I can't thank here, hopefully I will learn more of your beauty.
To all the people I haven't met yet, how do you get up in the morning?
And to my last love, my greatest love, my best friend, I can say nothing that you don't already know, but I can wish you, and everyone else, happiness in everything you do. I hope that I can provide it like you all have me.

Woo. Sap fest 2007. I suppose it's just the things I think are understood and never say. And on that note, I'm gonna go find an AA meeting. be easy."

What I'm about to say is extremely arrogant. Well. Maybe not. But you've been warned.

I believe that the reason I am suddenly so distant from everyone is because I've put the ball in their court. All the friends I entered this period of life with are going through their self indulgence. This is the time we're supposed to live for us. Between parental expectations and familial obligations.

But I'm already living for others. I've given up on myself. Everything I do now, even if I make a concious decision to ignore them, is made with considerations for everyone else.

And I really dig it that way. I can be content, happy even, with considering those I care about above myself.

Hm. But fuck that.

I'm tired of being so damn sad all the time. I'm turning into a fucking emo kid because of one simple, stupid fact that I've known most of my life anyways: <b>People don't give a <i>shit</i> about you.</b>

I can't just keep being a pissass about my friends not being around. Fuck, it's tough shit, get over it. Like I said, this is supposed to be when we live for us.

"event","It occurs to me again that none of this matters, though I don't even think of Canada as a sure thing.

I'm going to be playing a show at Dan Electro's Guitar Bar.  Look it up online if you're interested, but it's a Jerryhead bluegrass set so I don't actually expect anyone to come.

Uh. I guess I thought I had more to say.

Friday the thirteenth was awesome.  I haven't done anything like that in a long time.  It felt good.

Hm. Yeah. Bad day.  My favorite cat in the history of cats apparently was so badly blocked today he almost died.  I totally lost my calm.  That doesn't really happen very much.  It felt weird, especially over a cat..  But at the same time, it's not weird to me at all, I love that cat.

Right now Alex and the others are seeing Ani DiFranco.  Poo.

I spent a lot of the day trying really hard to meditate on like positive thoughts, because today was supposed to be like some crossover with a UV ray from a parallel universe or some crap like that that was supposed to manifest thoughts, good or bad, if they were focused on.  In retrospect, not much of it worked.

Someone really needs to have a party."

"event","Okay I'm just gonna cut straight to the chase. This is stupid, pathetic, pointless, and dramatic drivel, but quite frankly I'm out of options, and I'm sick of looking at things from other people's perspectives. I'm about to speak the truth as it is to me, and I don't really care who listens because I didn't ask you to, I just need you to. 

So I don't mean to diminish the love I have now and the love I'll have in the future. But it's hard not to because the love I have for Morgan is so stupid fucking strong I never even thought I <em>could</em> get this way. 

We've barely talked in a year. She's moved on and has a strong relationship with a boyfriend she adores. I've only recently been able to bring myself to follow through with another person, and sex is a distant memory, an emotional ordeal that just leaves an unsatisfied love and a stronger desire for Morgan in it's wake. I see her twice after months, and she's already got me wrapped around her finger and eating myself alive with jealousy. If that ever really stopped. 

And I don't know how to make it. I have officially lost the battle with myself, and am now becoming everything I said I would never be.  I've written a lot of crap about past loves, but such a sincere need to express this pain, even if it means through LJ, has only been provoked by Meggie.  And even that seems easy in the throes of this.

I just read back over all this.  And I can't even believe I'm really about to post this.  But that's how different I am from myself now.  That is the low I have sunk to, and this is the measure I resort to in this loneliness.

And what's worse... I'm fully aware that this isn't going to help at all.  In fact it's only going to perpetuate the situation.  Some will lose respect for me, some will get offended, some will just think I don't care enough to call them friend because I didn't talk to them about it and bitched about being lonely.  Awareness has never been my problem.  I've just got to figure out what is.

But I am fucking lonely.  I think this should be pretty representative of that.  But I'm okay with that.  I'm okay with it being self-serving and attention whoring, and I'm okay that it will probably distance people further away rather than bring them closer to me.  I guess the point of this has become... to tell.. LiveJournal.. that I'm a complete basketcase, that I'm scared as fuck of what I've become, and that I am lonely.  That I'm not this rock star that's been built up in my own fantasy, that I'm a fucking social being and I want to connect with interesting and beautiful people.  And that I love each of you, even if I can't convey that to any of you.

But it's all just gonna come out like whining.  And in honor of the Jordan I wish would come back, I don't really give a fuck.

I'm trapped in my own contradiction.  I think it says a lot about what I'm trying to say that I loathe this entry, that I deleted it, but I felt it too... necessary to be hidden.  The true test of its validity will come when I read it again the next time I get on LJ."

"event","So to play catch up...

I got a fatass new bass for my birthday.  OLP 5 string asskicker.  It seems to be exactly what I needed to get back on the level-up with music.

Then the party. The party was the shit. It was exactly what I wanted. Everyone chilled out and there was no conflict or drama or anything, and most everyone was at least relatively social with everyone else. All in all a success.

So it's time to make some fucking progress in my life. I find that I'm ready to relax, but I haven't reached that point yet. And I am ready to bust my ass to get there.

I find I'm reaching a conflict wanting to grow, learn, improve.. and wanting to be with those I love. And I feel really detached from everything lately, like all I have now is daydreams, and that I'm incapable of having any substantial interaction with anyone, including those that I love.

Actually, I haven't felt like myself in a long time. And I miss myself. That's part of the reason I am now being overcome by an urge to better myself. I used to be happy, at least content with myself, and even with loved ones I refused to be taken any other way than how I was. Now my confidence has receded and it's the one refusing, and I can't imagine that any of the respect and love people have for me will stick around very long.

I know that makes it sound like I have no faith in my friends, but it's honestly just I have truly reached a point of repulsion from myself. And rather, I have <i>enough</i> faith in my friends that they too shall see the ugliness that I see, and will not tolerate it.

I suppose you could take that as literal or exaggerated. Really, what people don't understand about me nowadays is that often now, I'm not being serious. The sarcasm through which I now filter everything is a misunderstood quality that I wish I could correct but I feel it may be too late. Everyone's just so distant now, and I suppose I can only attribute it to my own distancing. My sort of speaking with grains of salt has made it to where... well, now no one really knows what's going on in my head. And that's not who I am. That's not how I want to be. And that's certainly not the way I want relationships with my friends to be.

Ah, LiveJournal. The things you let me convey. Someday, I hope I lose the need for you once again, because I really am opposed to you and the method of expression you provide.

Maybe that should be a project. Convey these thoughts via LiveJournal. Hehheh, yeah right.

I suppose I want to apologize. I don't know how but damnit I'm going to get myself back.

Eh. I'm going to find another way to kill the time."

"event","A friend of mine quoted another friend of mine today, and I have to quote him again, because I like it.

Intelligence means nothing if you make stupid decisions.

The quote was about the group of us from middle school. So you can see in addition to being strangely.. wise?.. it is also quite accurate.

..Sorry. This... typing thing is rather difficult right now. I am again sufficiently intoxicated to transfer thought to text. And it was brought to my attention that the same way I keep up with people I don't talk to through LJ, others keep up with me. Or at least that's what I'm told. I don't quite buy it, but.. thanks for being nice?

So I don't know why I was thinking about this. It's random enough I remember it to tell you about it. But I was thinking about how things are changing in the world.

...Talking to people who are in their 30s, 40s.. they talk a lot about how different things are now as opposed to when they were, say, my age. And I started thinking about why.

This might be difficult to read. But bear with me, I'll try to be coherent.

So I started thinking about generation gaps. And from, I suppose, ""us"" to ""them"", it's pretty apparent. And I came to the conclusion it was because the generation gap had closed some. I mean, think about the years some of our parents grew up in. The 70s, 80s, and some in the 60s or the 90s I guess. They didn't grow up in the world their parents grew up in, and they understand the crazy behavior they are used to from when they were kids. 

Now, I don't necessarily believe in age barriers and the functions of each role in society. That is, like in this case for example, teens rebelling against their parents because.. they're supposed to. But, there is obviously something to it. So where their rebellion may have been the drug use and unwed sex, ours can't be that because they recognize it as things they did as well, or even expect it. I mean, our parents grew up when drugs were the fucking thing to do. Now pop culture, on its little ten year delay, has made it normal to use drugs. And sex is fucking everywhere. In or out of marriage, with a member of the opposite or same sex, it doesn't matter, it's all normal. So how do you rebel against that?

The 50s were the beginning of drugs as a means of rebelling. And with the 90s and the millenium, that ended. It's replacement, I have decided, is violence.

The best way to repulse a flower child or a disco fever victim is to forcibly rape someone and beat them to death.

...or something along those lines. you know, violence.

Or on the other side of the spectrum, the generation gap has closed because the gangsters of the last few decades are the parents now. Which is just.. breeding violence. Literally.

...Yeah, I'm fucking lit. So this is the kind of shit I think about.

I realize this has nothing to with me. So the whole concept of people keeping up with me is lost. But you're keeping up with my thoughts, which is all I really got going on right now anyways.

So I found a wicked ass new band. I can't stop listening to them, they just kick a hell of a lot of ass. The female singer's voice just.. melts my heart every time I hear it. And I will plug them now. Go listen to Hey Ocean!

<a href=""http://www.myspace.com/heyocean"" target=""_blank"">No, really. Go.</a>

While I'm plugging things, I must tell you about a movie that blew my mind. Or.. came close.

I Know I'm Not Alone. I would say it qualifies for the cliche must-see. But then that's just me. It's by Michael Franti from Spearhead, and yes it is a serious watch, but it's not a downer at all. It's very informative and very well done. Franti and a few other people go to Bagdhad and then to the Gaza strip. They walk around with a camera and his guitar and they just talk to people. Some of it has what I would call the cheesy taste of idealism in it, but it's very good. And if you get it and enjoy it, you should check out the album he did after he got back. There's a poppy feel to it, but it's a solid reggae album anyways.

Actually, either way you should check out the album. It's fucking fly. Just, after you've watched the movie, you'll understand his creative choices on the album a lot better.

So I scored 216000 points on Tony Hawk today. I don't even play that much, but clearly I play too much.

I've been doing a lot of thinking during this period of dedetox, like I already said about a million fucking times already. In addition to wanting to a newfound desire to learn (real things, not the shit they feed you in school), I've learned I think entirely too much. The confidence, the apathy, the calm I used to have.. it's all gone. So I'm thinking of going completely clean so I can really get ahold of myself again. I really... don't like myself very much right now. But that is just more reason to change for the better? Hehheh. Now I really sound the part of the stoner on LiveJournal.

And on that note, this insane ramble is over.

"event","It occurs to me that no one really gets anything I say anymore because it's all inside jokes with myself. And that tempts me to just fuck it all and delete all the entries here, most especially the more recent ones. But if I deleted all this because nobody got it, then what the hell point would there be in ever trying to convey anything to anyone? Ah, the logic I find in these times.

I suppose you could say that I'm pulling a Blair. Except my thoughts will still seem coherent and in the morning I will have no intention of deleting any of it. It's simply the right combination of computer time, Rachael's urgings, and ready access to liquid courage. Uneditted, completely random drivel that no one's really interested in.

But that's what LiveJournal is here for.

So the other day, I'm driving with the windows down, and a girl pulls up next to me with her windows down and some rap blaring out. Most of you who know me probably expect I snorted, laughed, sneered, or was otherwise put off by the music. But I listened to it, and I processed it, and I enjoyed it.

This isn't really surprising nowadays. But there is a point somewhere.

I got to thinking about how some years ago, any rap at all, with a few notable exceptions like Michael Franti, Busta, and Del the Funkyhomosapien, would've produced a disgusted reaction from me. So much so that a friend of mine and I drew apart after he started listening to rap music.

Now, he listened to crap. But it made me wonder if his music taste was really all that bad, or if he was just able to open himself up to it much sooner than me. Obviously, I did not have as much of a handle on things as I liked to think back then. But was I justified, or did Tyler reach an understanding of things so long before I did?

It's these bizarre, random thoughts that have made my days much longer and shorter all at the same time this summer. I've been rather isolated from a lot of people over the summer, and the distance between me and just about everyone I've ever loved just continues to grow.

It's impossible to stop now, being that this is the fall that I should be going to college, and that many of my friends are. I won't even get to see most of them a last time before they go, and most of them won't even think twice about seeing me before they're gone. But I suppose it's just that time, and this is what happens to everybody. Especially when you think your friends aren't like that.

You know it just occured to me that I really have no idea what pieces of my thought process have made it into this text and that I'm quite incapable of looking back at it at this point to see. So I hope it's not a complete waste of time.

While on vacation, I did a LOT of thinking that was a lot like this. And there was so much that I wanted to share when I returned. So I got to thinking about it, and tried to decide if it was worth trying to convey any of it. Is the point simply having these thoughts, or is the point trying to deliver them to others? I ended up choosing the 'humble' path, but I never really reached a solid answer to the question.

I don't know why I'm telling you this now. Because I still haven't.

Wow. This is exactly why I don't post here. I have no idea what the hell any of this means or why anyone is going to give enough of a crap to read it. Or why they even should. It feels.. self-centered? and pointless. But that's what LJ is for.

Don't get me wrong. This trip has been fan-fucking-tastic.

We have to come to San Fran, everyone.

I'm coming to see you, Sissa.

...Meggie, I miss you.

Vegas, baby."

...I swear you get used to the heat...

..actually, that's a lie. Sorry, love.

In any case, hopefully you got here safe, got to your new home safe, and are out hanging out with Maku and the others instead of reading this.

Hopefully.

I shall be there soon.

Love you.

I'm doing my best to rectify this error, if you like to think of it that way.

Until then, understand I don't mean to offend, hurt, or ignore. And take care of yourselves."

"event","Well, it certainly has been a while. A lot has happened.

This journal's privacy has been compromised.

I have to repeat 11th grade English (big surprise).

I got kicked out of school because the principal is a self-righteous bitch who hates me. And I'll be going to Lamar, Reagan, or possibly even Waltrip if I'm just that unlucky next year.

I'm on Deferred Adjudication (basically proby with no PO) for Class C Misdemeanor Theft.

I'll be leaving the Psychodillos at the end of the summer or when they find a new bassist (whichever comes first).

I've got a girlfriend that I'm actually serious about, that I'm actually crazy about.

And I'm sitting here in San Antonio, killing time on the free highspeed internet that keeps fucking cutting out on me.

Man.

So that's my update.

Other than that, I don't know what to tell you.

Bumming. Missing the Hou-Stoners, missing Brady, missing the few Waltrip people who I gave a crap about, missing Kayt, missing Sabi, missing Kate, missing Katie, and now missing the Challenge people I gave a crap about, and the PVA gang...

Well. If any of you want to see me, best place to do it is at the Last Concert Cafe on Saturday night. The Psychodillos are playing there, opening, so probably around 9:30, 10. I think it's all ages, but you probably want to bring someone just in case.

Other than that, I'm not sure when I'll be let out of my cage. I suppose I'll talk to you all later.

Adieu.

I just had to say that I don't think I've ever met people more amazing than my newfound friends, that is, Alex, Blair, Sam, and Justin. It doesn't even feel like they're new friends. I mean, it's freaking me out that I already care so much, am so damned attached... but I can't do shit about it. And anyways, it's not like I want to at this point.

Mrreh. I don't know exactly what the point of this was.

So I'll give it one.

I less than three you guys. (You guys meaning the aforementioned, jackasses)

Oh, and I have pictures of you at the show. Ahaha. Bitches.

Yeah, anyways. Drinking time.

Ahem. Sorry, I suppose this is another faux update. I am deleting the bottom couple entries since they are not entries that go with the theme here anymore, and I'll likely be routing out the other faux entries as well soon.

But god DAMNIT I hate cops.

I have to go to court. For shoplifting.

That's right.

A fucking Hou-Stoner was caught stealing.

Actually, I take that back. I wasn't caught. I was ratted out. Death comes swiftly to betrayers of confidence...

This is fairly old news, really, and those of you closest to me and those who go to my school (of which I can only think of one who would be reading this...) already know this. I just thought I'd let everyone know why I'm absent, in case some actually gave half a shit.

I suppose it's karma. I really have stolen so much shit from that store. I'll take my fine and community service. It's not worth going to court over.

Damn, St. Patrick's Day is so perverted now. At least I got to get drunk and Tim kind of ignored it. And I got to go hang out with Blair.

Also, Alex and Blair are both departing from this cesspool we call Houston over Spring Break, and seeing as I don't have Sam or Justin's numbers, this has thrown the proverbial wrench in my Spring Break plans. So. Should anyone have something to get me out of the house for a while, let me know. If you're cool enough, you have the number.

'Dios, fuckers.

"event","Well, it's time. With a little help from my new yet very dear friends, I have crawled from the abyssal depths of a patheticly depressed existence, and with a little help from St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, I am adequately hateful enough to return to my charge as an asshole in text.

So I had to go see my mother's choir sing today. I was expecting to see her choir.

Turns out, they were thanking the Church that had let them practice there every Monday night by being their choir for the services that day.

Luckily, I only had to sit through the later service, or there might be a few dead presbyterians right now...

So I open the program and skim through the schedule to see how long I have to suffer through the pains of someone preaching beliefs I don't believe in, and at the bottom of it is the Budget Summary. I felt the familiar twitch in my eye, and the growing urge to strangle someone, and that's usually a sign of bullshit.

Seriously now, I can understand needing the funds to keep the Church building up and running and to purchase the necessary equipment and furniture when it opens, and to buy things needed for communion.

But does that really cost a million bucks a year? I shit you not, the budget summary for the year totalled near a million dollars. And their projected needed costs? Well, they didn't meet their expectations.

HOW CAN YOU NEED THAT MUCH MONEY?

If you're just here to preach the word of God and bring people together to worship, WHY SO MUCH DAMN EXPENSES? Hell, it's a sin to be lavish in your spending, and yet the so-called holy institution of Church is just a-spending. If you're gonna preach something, it'd be a good idea to PRACTICE IT, JACKASSES.

So then this preacher gets up there for his sermon, ""All For One and One For All"" (Don't even get me started). Basically, the gist of the sermon is that the Church community should own you. Everything else comes second. Your church is priority number one. Donate all you can, even if you're starving and homeless, show up to Church every Sunday, regardless of circumstances, and above all, support the Church and the people in it, particularly the ones in charge.

The guy even used homework as an example. The scenario was this little kid hadn't done her homework, and it was Sunday, and he said (I fucking quote) ""Yeah, she should've done her homework, and maybe she should fail."" Hey, asshole, I can worship on my own as you so specifically pointed out in your last sermon on Solitude in Prayer, which you pounded into our heads before going off on this Sunday's tangent. (Let me give you a tip. If I wasn't here last Sunday, I SHOULDN'T KNOW WHAT THE SERMON WAS.) Now I should fail just so I can show up and give you a little bit more power?

This is what pisses me off about organized religion. The whole system is made to give the people that run it more power by manipulating people's faiths. They need a million bucks to run the Church. They don't even need a million bucks. They just want it. Because they're fucking humans, and humans naturally sin.

It's especially sickening because I really value faith, all humanity set aside. I think if there was actually something worth putting faith into, it would be a really great thing. Unfortunately, there's not. Instead there's a bunch of bullshit religions that do nothing more than gather power and incite segregation.

Oh, man, I totally can't even make that subject funny. And I tried.

So let's talk about something I can.

The Village!

So I went to the Village yesterday and was promptly reminded why I hate it there.

Specifically, as soon as I got out of my van, three people gave me nasty looks from their big expensive cars, and then I walked past this fat, ugly bitch with enough black and red makeup to embarass a Montrose drag-queen hooker, big pink knee-highs that totally clashed with the rest of her technicolor disaster of an outfit, and she looked at me with my knappy dreads, plain ass cammies, and plain concert T-shirt, and sneered. SHE sneered at ME.

Like I'm the one who's odd? Ooo, shitlocks. He must be a loser. Fuck you, you plastic rebel, you're the one shopping in the fucking Village, where everything is tailor-made to what a bunch of adolescents say is hip.

(Hip... I'd like to take a moment and say the plays were fabulous, and not in a gay way.)

And... now the nyquil is kicking in. So, rather than continue, I'll close on this note:

Luxury SUVs. Does anyone else see a problem there?

Now to join the unconcious.

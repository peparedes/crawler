"event","The last month has been has been crappy. I've moved house again and don't have internet, which always makes me feel disconnected. I'm also broke and looking for a second job. Mostly so I can afford to move out of my grandfathers home, where I temporarily reside.

Finally feeling that internal call to start practicing again. Haven't quite decided how it's supposed to go, but we'll let things percolate a little at the back of my head.

Gods bless."

"event","I'm cat sitting the most adorable 3 month old kitten for the next little while. He seems to have made himself right at home, and I'm a little bit in love with him.

I was going to get myself some pet rats, but I&nbsp;don't think that they would get along, so that's on the backburner. Instead I'll go and spend some money on toys and a scratching post.

Note to self: Self get some photos of him."

I was worried I'd be totally lost, but 8 years of learning german(which I can't speak) paid of. I understood the form of learning the language. How the sentence structure is different etc.&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to next week.

What this means of course is that I'm now one step closer to going overseas."

So does this mean I shouldn't direct a name to him until I find one that I'm sure is him, or should I just name him according to me? I'll probly continue working with him and his name will be revealed or not, up to him."

"event","I was going to make this journal a compilation of all of my previous ones, but I think what's best is to start a fresh. Make this for the me that I am now instead of the who I was.

So my life at the moment....

I am part of an awesome book group. We meet up once a month and discuss spiritually enlightening books. The latest one was ""The Journey Home"". It was really interesting and the concepts in it really opened up my crown chakra. I was buzzing for a while after I stopped reading.

It also led to some interesting ideas/brainwaves about how I lead my life. How I really really dislike change and how previously I've set down root and not moved until my entire life has to upend itself to get me moving again ie. the tower card kept appearing in my tarot readings earlier this year. So what I need to realise about my life is I'm not drowning I'm flying.

Note to self: look into eagles. As a scorpio the eagle is supposed to be the energy to claim???

Anyone reading this go to: <a href=""http://diannesylvan.typepad.com/dancing_down_the_moon/"">Dancing Down the Moon</a> by Dianne Sylvan. Her book ""The Circle Within"" turned around a lot of my thinking at the perfect time in my life.

Well look at that. Looks like I had something to say afterall."

"event","I signed the lease on my new home today. It's a little smaller than I initially preferred, but it's got everything else going for it. Going to be strapped for cash over the next couple of weeks, while I get all the bills and bonds and leases figured out, but it will be absolutely worth it not having to share with anyone.

My life will revolve around this new flat for a while. I'm already planning how I'm moving and what I'll be taking with me and what will go back into the family garage for anyone who wants it. Also how much of my stuff should get culled? I have a lot of books that I haven't read since I bought them. Should I take them with me?

Then the fun part of the whole thing is the magic. What influences do I want in this flat? When I moved into my current flat I had to be discreet because of differing religious views, now I can do what I want and display what I want. How heady the freedom. How will my life change when I have my own space?"

I live a boring life.. as I can't seem to think of a thing to write about.

Although one thing that springs to mind is how shocked people are that a 24 year old has a baby and has another on the way. It doesn't seem that strange to me, probably because my parents had me at such a young age I think anyone over twenty is a decent age. Or maybe it's because the average age is later now days, that people think it's so unusual."

I've had problems finishing a course before and I know everone is going to think this is exactly the same, in fact a couple of people alread have. It feels different though, mainly because I know that kinesiology is what I want to do, just with everything else in my life at the moment I can't give it enough focus/energy/time.

I redid my altar recently, and it doesn't feel quite right. I'm going to have to redo again. I did it in a circular formation around the edge of my chest of draws and it feels to contained, like I'm forcing into that shape. So I shall go home this evening and endevor to fiddle with it until it feels right. Also I like to have the incense holders where I can clean them easily and I can't at the moment. Reason enough I think :)

"event","I could have sworn I'd updated earlier this week. Ce la vie

Life has been... interesting.

Have started a tarot course with <lj user=lycaonia>. It was really interesting. It's over 5 weeks, and they haven't really told us the ""meanings"" of the cards, just about them in general and how to get a feel for reading them in certain spreads. I'm really looking forward to the next couple of weeks.

I can see tho that this will lead to lots of spending of money on new tarot decks.

My Kinesiology course isn't going so well. I was in no way ready for the shake up of my life in relation to all the energy work. I ODed on energy work one week, having a balance, then an adjustment(chiro), then a visit with my counciler. Nothing had a chance to settle, before the next thing came up, leading to me reeling about, not knowing which way was up the following week.

Doing a lot of contemplating about what kind of person I want to be. If I'm going to pull down my life, I'm going to grow &amp; expand in ways that will benefit me in the future, not cause me to do this again in 5 years time.

Do I want to be:
grounded?
emotional?
yogic?
toaist?
career driven?
body focused?
healer?
guide?
shaman?
fiery?
playful?
energetic?
spiritual?
pagan?
all of the above?


The possibilities are endless... a lot of the choice is up to me, some of it to the gods, and some up to my natural tendencies.

It will be interesting to look back on this post in a few years time and see where I've anded up."

Not a very interesting journal so far, but hopefully that will start changing soon. I'm writing the first fanfic that I intend to publish. My initial writings are all Mary-Sueish in the extreme so no one but me gets to read those.

I'm feeling very witchy at the moment but don't feel like doing ritual right now. Meditation seems to be the way to go at the moment. Also will help with the unthreading of my head.

Have to decide what I'm doing in my future, which is taking most of my brain power. I've started a kinesiology course, but I can't decide if I want to quit because it's harder than I thought it was going to be(studying part-time &amp; working full-time) or if I've changed my mind about what direction I want to go in. Books or healing, or maybe both?"

"event","My brain's gone to mush. It's not working anymore tonight.

Got a lot of thoughts twisting round like tangled yarn in my head. Did a bit of thinking and writing in my new shiny journal, and got a lot of it out into paper. Which means now everything else has to rearrange itself in there.

I have a feeling I'm in for some interesting dreams tonight, when of course all I want to do is switch my brain off and get some restful sleep. 

Restful sleep how I miss thee.

Gods bless"

"event","My sister is converting me to new fandoms. At least I've seen some Full Metal episodes, but how she has managed Kingdom Hearts when I've never even seen the characters I don't know.

But, it's fun having someone I personally know to squeee with fannish glee about the fic I just read. In the other fandoms we share our OTPs are totally contradictory.

She's even got me writing again. The last time I wrote was when I was new to fandom and writing my epic Mary Sue. If this fic ever gets past the concept stage it will be posted here.

On another note, my weekend away for Noni's 70th went well. It was very bittersweet, as we were celebrating her life and Nana's life was just recently ended.

Goals, goals, goals. What are my goals? This is my focus this week, when I have the time. I'm busy, which is good. I don't have any me time tho, which is bad. We'll see how I go this week.

Gods bless"

"event","Last night I stayed up late procrastinating about studying. So slept in and missed the exam I was studying for. Perfect start to the day.

Have followed by being incredibly unproductive for the rest of the day, minus a brief stint of recycling old papers that I don't need any more.

It's a lack of goals I think. Not having anything to strive for, as I've accomplished the initial goals I set. The first ever goals I've had for myself. Passed by without being acknowledged. Maybe I can do something about that, have a reward other than the results of the goals themselves.

Thought to ponder that.

As soon as I finish this I'm off to a delightful weekend away with the extended family. Hope it goes well.

Lady of the night fires,
You strip away the lies,
to reveal the hidden truths.
The inner darkness holds no fear,
but gives power to the deserving.
Help me to see into the shadows,
That I may see that which is hidden and feared,
So that I might bring it into the light of Your fire,
And see my hidden strength, my true power.
My inner night fire."

"event","Hello world,

This is going to be a exercise in being extroverted. 

Finding myself through an online journal. 

Anything and everything will be up here, from the sacred to the profane.

Well, that's the idea anyway :)

We'll see how I go.

Gods bless,
Mara"

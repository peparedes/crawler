not rlly.
i lied.
so, there is this kid rite, well call him...
umm...
lets see...
chair. 
rite.
so, chair, i pretty much am crazy about him.
funny thing however,
we met in summer school BUUUUUUUUUT, we kinda sorta knew eachother before that.
ya see, he said i looked familiar from something and i said he did as well.
then i asked if he use to go to pathways.
and BAM.
the question of where have i seen this kid before was answered.
too bad he doesnt go there anymore... :(
this saddens me greatly.

ok now i have a story.
ya see, hes friends with this kid, well call this kid paper.
cuz were cool.
ya see, paper was telling the beautiful chair about how hes probly gonna have sex in high school, but chair was like 'no, no im not'
then meany paper was trying to convince him with the whole ya u are dude trust me crap.
but no. no no no.
he was like totally for sure that hes not.
then he said it.
the thing that made my heart skip a lot more beats than it probably should,
he said:
im waiting til im married.

o. my. gosh.
he is such an amazing boy.
the main thing that truly has me totally hooked on him, is that he loves jesus.
that is very rare for me to meet a guy that i like who says hes a christian, but actually follows thru with it.
im seriously smitten with this boy.
obsessed, some mite say, but i say no.
smitten and in L-U-V. not L-O-V-E. no no no.
L-U-V.
which in the language of me just mean really like alot alot alot alot. times alot more alots.

im not gonna go on about why i like him so much, cuz i do have summer school tomorrow and i need my sleep. lol

its not like the things ppl normally say why they like someone.
o hes got a great personality.
hes nice.
he makes me laugh all the time.
hes cute.

which all that is true about chair but there is sooooooooo much more.
seriously.
soooooo much.

i saw him outside of school last weekend, and i seriously think i had somewhat of a heartattack.
no joke.
lol.
well then why would i say lol if it was no joke.
gahh. whatever.
lol
cuz i like to laugh! sue me!

i kinda feel retarded cuz just about every single one of my entries in this thing is about a boy that i like.
but i only rite in here occasionally so ya.
boo-hoo if ur sick of hearing my boy stories.
well, reading in this case.
gahhh. whatever once again.
lol

alrite well i believe im done for now.

peace. \/"

"event","ok.
so heres whats been happening recently in the land of morgan.
i like this boy.
A LOT.
but the truth is, i really really shouldnt....

my mom is being so...grrr...and shes like 'its inappropriate.' (doooood! no its not! age is just a frickin number!!) and then she was saying how if his mom found out that she wouldnt want me over at his house nemore.

so she told me that i couldnt go down and hang out with anymore if i was gonna like him as more than a friend.
so i pretty much had to lie to my mom and say that i can just as easily stop liking him as i can start.

another lie.

i want to respect my moms wishes and all, but seriously, its not fair of her to tell me who i can and cant spend time with. especially when she knows what kind of a great person this kid is.

it makes me so mad!!!

i like him so much. <3
and i kinda get the vibe that he likes me too...but hey thats just a vibe. 

we have so much fun together. i can talk to him about anything. and he doesnt just hear what im saying when i talk to him, he really does listen. hes so incredible. we were hanging out yesterday, and i wanted to tell him so badly.

but seriously, that would be horrible if i did. im pretty much like 99.9% sure that itd be awkward between us from then on and he probly wouldnt wanna hang out with me nemore. 

but i love spending time with him so i definitely wouldnt be able to bear that.

hes just too amazing for words.

morgans falling in luv.

(luv not love. luv to me means liking ALOT and such. love on the other hand, to me thats a very special word. so im not gonna just say it like its no big deal, cuz to me, it definitely is.)






PROBLEM:   hes in 6th grade...."

"event","so today was the super bowl. and it was pretty fun actually. MINUS THE FACT THAT THE FREEKIN SEVENTH GRADERS WON!! omg. its depressing. thats like the first time in 4 years that seventh grade has beat eigth grade. again i say, depressing. ya but something that rlly pissed me off was that ashlee matas dad was coaching them from the sidelines. it wasnt fair cuz no one else had someone coaching them. but u kno what, they deserved to win. they did a great job. i like hardly got the ball so that was pretty lame. but its understandable cuz its rlly hard playing on that tiny field with 11 ppl. well congrats BURN!! lol however the 8th grade boys won so at least the 7th graders didnt win overall. ya the boys were so awesome! they throw like BAM and dive for it like BAM!! omg its so crazy! but neways i was getting rlly mad at jordan, again. hes just been rlly annoying lately. its just cuz its like hes a little brother to me. a little annoying brother. me and keli like yelled at him cuz he was standing on the field. lol so i think im pmsing. lol cuz like the past couple days everything has been ticking me off. ya. lol good thing me jess and keli are having a pms party tonite! whoo who! lol k im done. peace kids."

"event","so ya theres this kid. lol actually, theres these 2 kids. one of them, i used to like ALOT and a whole bunch of crap went on with him. but i saw him last friday and for some strange reason, all the feelings i had for him just rushed back! he loves jesus which is just grand to the maxxorz! hes sweet. hes hysterical! i could go on...lol and hes absolutely gorgeous!! what a bonus! lol so the only problem with this is, hes in high school and i hardly ever see him. so im guessing all these feelings i have for him will be gone in like a week. lol as for this other kid (who shall remain nameless! lol)...this other kid is a different story. basically, i kno like nothing about him other than he is hot! lol i mean, ive known him since 1st grade, but i dont actually KNOW him. ya kno what i mean? newho, im like one out of 50 girls who thinks hes hot so that slurps. i really dont want to like him...i mean i really really dont. but its like, every single time i see him, i get butterflies in my stomach. when our eyes meet, i get like weak in the knees. when he smiles, omg when he smiles...I MELT!! his smile is gorgeous! lol except i dont think theres even a point to liking him. i have no chance whatsoever. and that makes me pretty sad. well i think im done for now."

"event","so ya the dance was pretty much UNfun!! ya. i rlly wanted to dance with a certain someone but u kno i didnt have the guts to ask him so i ended up just being mad at myself for not having the nerve to ask him. but other than that it was kinda fun but not rlly. i dont like it when one of my friends always goes into the circle and shows off. i kno she loves to dance and its what shes good at, but still, she doesnt have to show off all the time. and if i tell her that, she'll get all defensive and get mad at me. newho im done now."

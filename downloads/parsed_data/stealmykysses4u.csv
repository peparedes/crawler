ok- well next time you go look at your cup-
they have the really nifty quotes on them- I LOVE THEM!!

here is mine from today
i had a grande latte with 1 punp of white chocolate.
(that doesnt really mean anything... just if you wanna buy me coffee one day)

The human catalysts for ""dreamers"" are the teachers and encourager that ""dreamers"" encounter throughout their lives. They are invaluable in the quest to turn ideas into reality. So here's a special thanks to all of the teachers- especially my teacher, (insert name here... this one says Miz Lane)!    -- Kevin Carroll

I really like this one. I like to ""dream"" and i can see what he is taking about-
this is my sharing for the day.
I like to share.
sometimes.

have fun- and let me know what your coffee cup says. maybe it will change your views on something.
who knows what a coffee cup and do?..."

i went to ATL for the x-mas at my aunt and uncles...
my g-parents joinded us-
the twins have gotten sooooo big
it was fun putting together stuff lastnight for them
this was pretty much their first x-mas-- last year they were only 6 months old... so they didnt really know what was going on-- so at 18 months this year they are very active and talkative

i got a wireless thing for my internet-- very excited after it took forever to set up 

so i am home now
ready to sleep in my own bed
and sleep in late



***sad note for this x-mas and forever
yesterday morning a very wonderful lady by the name of beth cook past away
she had very very bad lung cancer
her and her husband adopted a little girl who is inthe 5th grade now
beth was a kindergarden teacher at hewitt for a very ling time 
i think over 20 years 
she will be in my heart forever
she had a heart of gold and would do anything for anyone
she now has no pain and looks down upon us and watches over us

so tonight we did x-mas stuff and a lot of the sunday school adult classed had parties so we had like 40 kids
maybe 10-15 youth and like 5 adults

but yeah the main thing was
we got 435 dollars in donations-- and our last one we got 100 with like 10 kids 
we were raising money to fix our family life center up-also known as our gym
we have our contemporary woriship service there
i am reallly proud of our you

I AM PRO CHOICE

Week 1
Mommy, I am only 8 inches long, but I have all my organs. I love the sound of your voice. Every time I hear it, I wave my arms and legs. The sound of your heart beat is my favorite lullaby.

Week 2
Mommy, today I learned how to suck my thumb. If you could see me, you could definitely tell that I am a baby. I'm not big enough to survive outside my home though. It is so nice and warm in here.

Week 3
You know what Mommy, I'm a !! I hope that makes you happy. I always want you to be happy. I don't like it when you cry. You sound so sad. It makes me sad too, and I cry with you even though you can't hear me.

Week 4
Mommy, my hair is starting to grow. It is very short and fine, but I will have a lot of it. I spend a lot of my time exercising. I can turn my head and curl my fingers and toes, and stretch my arms and legs. I am becoming quite good at it too.

Week 5
You went to the doctor today. Mommy, he lied to you. He said that I'm not a baby. I am a baby Mommy, your baby. I think and feel. Mommy, what's abortion?

Week 6
I can hear that doctor again. I don't like him. He seems cold and heartless. Something is intruding my home. The doctor called it a needle. Mommy what is it? It burns! Please make him stop! I can't get away from it! Mommy!! HELP me!! No . . .

Week 7
Mommy, I am okay. I am in Jesus's arms. he is holding me. He told me about abortion. Why didn't you want me Mommy?

Every Abortion Is Just . . .
One more heart that was stopped. Two more eyes that will never see. Two more hands that will never touch. Two more legs that will never run. One more mouth that will never speak.

PLEASE REPOST THIS IF YOU CHOOSE LIFE AND ARE AGAINST ABORTION"

i'm in Louisiana by the way

i havnt been here in this state in 8 years and about one month

i miss it soooo much
i love this place
crossing over the mississippi river was the greatest thing...
i have been through a tiny corner on the way to arkansas which is my place of birth 
but i never got to stay here

my grandparents live in ruston-
it is a 6 1/2 hour drive from trussville
about 30 min. from monroe
and about an hour or less from shreveport

turkey day was good--
except for the family from arkansas coming in-- they are actually no way related to me- 
except the fact that they are my step-grandad(pops)s brother and sister and mom
they are lost in time-- but yeah-- 

i will be home saturday sometime

matt is grounded this weekend b/c he took his sisters shirt and left it in someones car-- now some chick has it.
his parents are horrible.
all they ever do is tell him what a piece of crap he is and that he will go no where in his life and he doesnt deserve anything he has-
and none of that is true... it makes me sad

yesterday at wil's track meet his mom sat whith my mom and all she did was bitch about him
my mom now hates his mom-
the worst thing in the world is for your parents to say you are worthless and they dont want you

ok that is my rant...



last year yesterday- september 24, 2005
andy greenley pased away 
he had a horrible car accident and ran into a tree

my grandmother will be taking over it on wednesday-
she is staying until friday
she is helping my mom paint our kitchen and dinning room
then we get to paint someother rooms later-
i am excited-
i get to paint my room

i am not happy that i will be without a roomfor 1/2 of next week

ummm..
tonight at 7 jeremy camp will be at the church at brookhills i believe-- the one off 119 and 280
i will be there with about 20 other kids from my church
i think it will be fun

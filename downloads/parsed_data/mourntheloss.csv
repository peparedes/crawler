"event","So last night I went to St. Petersburg, and while there took a walk down to the Pier. And there was something about last night... something about standing that and looking at the moon, and it's wonderful and awe inspiring reflection on the water that just calmed me. And I stood there against the freezing cold railing with the wind absolutely assaulting my face and hair and I thought about what on earth I'm going to do for the rest of my life... or even in the next year of it. And I smiled and closed my eyes as I realized, in comparison, how little that even mattered in contrast to the simple, uncomplicated beauty of the water painted with the moon. And as strands of my now hopelessly knotted hair whipped around my face, I was completely and totally at peace as I realized how capable a God who made all of that must be. A God who made waters so breathtaking and vast that when viewed appear endless; a God who made a sky and an atmosphere and stars and the moon for sometimes, it seems, nothing more than for me to simply enjoy; a God who, underneath the surface of this rippling tide created an entire 'nother world full of mystery that we've yet to fully understand and discover, for perhaps no other reason than for HIM to enjoy. And, in all of this, a God who is this powerful and this in control, to love ME and have a plan for ME and know ME... and suddenly worrying seemed, well, ridiculous. And the beauty of creation enveloped me as God whispered ""Now do you see? Just... trust... ME."" And if God can do that, God can certainly handle me, the creatED."

"event","This whole idea of being a bondservant is really taking on significant meaning for me. I mean, what is a bondservant? How does it apply to my life? First of all, it would seem that a bondservant has some sort of debt to pay, an obligation of sorts. The thing about this is that we're not necesarily INDEBTED to Christ, at least as I understand it. Rather, it's a privelege to be a bondservant of Christ because of what He did for us; something we can give back. So while Christ paid our debts, the price He requests is our lives. So then perhaps that's the debt we owe, is ourselves and our worship. Another thing is that a bondservant accepts, with ho qualms, the authority of his master. I struggle here. Christ has absolute rule, absolute authority, and I need to remember tha next time I decide to just snatch my life out of God's hands and back into my own control; that as a bondservant of Christ, with Christ as my MASTER, Christ has authority and rule in my life; and THANK GOD for that! Lastly, a bondservant is loyal and dedicated to his or her master. So all of these things combined.... it would seem, in our culture, that to be a bondservant is not something to which we ASPIRE. This word is linked with slavery, with oppression, with servanthood and the abuse of authority. So perhaps then we need to change our thinking entirely. To be a bondservant to Christ does not link us with oppression, but with liberty, freedom, and true, raw LIFE. So perhaps it begins there, with a new mindset, a new outlook. And suddenly... I'm excited to be able to call myself a bondservant of Christ. To remember my position as UNDER THE AUTHORITY of Christ, and instead of be frightened of taht loss of control, rejoice in it. The possibility of serving Christ, my GOD for the rest of my life... not only surrendering my life, but going a step further and actually laying my life at the feet of the most high God. The wise men brought spices and incense and gold to a baby... but as I approach the manger, I lay down in the straw my control, my future, my life as I know it now not belonging to me, but to Someone who can do far greater things with it than I can. I guess it's all about knowing who's in charge, and being ok with it. Reforming our idea of servantude and instead of struggling with it, be JOYOUS that we get this opporunity to discover, through being a servant to Christ, the meaning, the ESSENCE of what life is really all about; what it was created to be."

"event","...Drowning, Saved.
So humbling, this overwhelming experience of absolute love that is beyond my comprehension, my understanding, my capabilities. Tears slip down my face as the recognition of my deepest need overwhelms me, filled once again. Broken, weeping, cleansed as the worry, the doubt, the fears, the anxiety, the depression, the stress is washed away in a tsunami of love, acceptance, and so much that cannot be named, only felt. Cradled in arms of absolute Power, and yet absolute tenderness, stroking my pain and replacing it with relief. Pure peace laps at my feet, and I sigh, and dive in. Head drops foward, smiling as the tears pour down, a release of control. Arms raised in absolute trust, as Greater arms than mine envelop me and just hold on, uncomplicated, shielding me from the dark depths of life. My shelter, my paradise in the ugliness of being me... loved, cherished, dependence, release...
                           ...How great is our God.

"event","Ok, so I went to church this morning, and a million thoughts were racing through my mind all morning, and I am about to attempt to shorten them down to one post; forgive my failed effort if that is the result. I guess it started last night- I had a killer headache, and I SO did not want to wake up to go to church today (it's true, I guess it happens to the best of us : ). But I woke up this morning.... excited. SO excited to be going to participate in the act of worshipping God... not just the lifestyle, but the actual ACT of it. So I went to a church a lot like the church I grew up in, only like ten times better worship (both pastors blow me away though). So I got there, and this is where the conjungled thoughts begin (yes, I did make up that word). I was just... grateful for this crazy flawed institution we call the church. Can you imagine if we had to carry our faith by ourselves? It would be so screwed up! No WONDER God organized His body the way He did- we all compliment each other so well. Some have this gift, some have that gift, and it's when we stop looking at what a privelege it is to be a part of God's family- HIS ACTUAL BODY- that conflict arises over stupid things that don't even compare to what Christ did for us- what our focus SHOULD be on. It just struck me that as much as we complain about ""the church,"" and as many things as we find to criticize about it, we are so fortunate for it, that we have each other as a source of encouragement, of love, of knowlege, of diversity IN Christ... and without that we'd be screwed. The church must be necesary if God created and organized it, and although today's church is probably not what God had in mind- Really, a unified body does NOT have like fifty thousand different denominations- it's still what God created and told us we need to be a part of it. So Thank God that He is so familiar with our weaknesses that He unified ALL of our weaknesses together for His glory.
The sermon today was amazing, and I got so much out of it and was so... just REFRESHED to be hearing and learning STRAIGHT from God's word... it was just like a sermon my old pastor (whom I miss) would've given... the sermon was on ministry, set in Hebrews ch. 13. But the point that really convicted me wasn't even from that passage- it was more from a subpoint that the pastor made from Romans, like one of the most popular verses in Romans (at least one of my favorites). Only even though I've read and studied this passage OVER AND OVER AGAIN, I never noticed this point taht leaped out of the passage this morning. ***Quick bunny trail*** The Jews say that the scriptures and the text is like a gem, and each time you turn it or study it it flickers in a new way, or produces a new color- each time the gem is turned, it reveals something new about itself, and this is the way that the Jews study the scriptures- something we could take a lesson from. So that's exactly what happened this morning in Romans Ch. 12 Verse 1. It got turned, and I saw a whole new color, and a whole new gleam that I'd never focused on before. So the verse says ""Therefore, my brethren, I urge you by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God- this is your spiritual act of worship."" Now I've always concentrated on the ""Living Sacrifices"" part of this, because what an amazing concept!! But take a gander (hehe, I said ""gander"") at that last part- THIS IS YOUR SPIRITUAL ACT OF WORSHIP. So when we go to church, and we carp and whine about how we want worship to be just like THIS, and we hope the message will be like THIS and not have all of THAT in it, and we hope so and so will be there, and then we COMPLAIN when it doesn't go that way... what an attitude to have towards our SPIRITUAL ACT OF WORSHIP. We should be excited to be able to worship God in whatever way we can! And if the worship isn't great, and if the sermon stretches our attention span, then SO BE IT. Because that's the kind of attitude we should have towards our spiritual act of worship- not one of ""how can the church serve ME,"" but one of ""my God, I am so fortunate to be able to participate in my act of worship this way this morning."" We should be HUMBLE, without expectations when it comes to church. I am so guilty of this, you guys. SO guilty of this. And my whole aspect and outlook on what church is and how we should regard it was (THANK GOD) blown to pieces this morning.
And lastly the pastor told this story. He spoke of another pastor, who had a severely mentally handicapped daughter. His daughter would never speak other than in grunts and moans of pain and frustration; she would never walk, never marry, never smile, never carry on any resembleance of a lifestyle, PERIOD, let alone a typical one. And one day, while changing his SIXTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER'S DIAPERS, staring at the essence of human grossness, while his full grown, woman of a daughter could only grunt in frustration at him, this pastor broke down in grief, frustration, and BITTER ANGER at God. And he yelled at God ""WHY! Why is she like this?!? This, the epitome of human waste, without ability- my life is committed to this?!? To changing her diapers for the rest of my life?"" And the man cried out in bitterness and anger at God. And God looked down at him and said ""I change your diapers EVERY DAY. Every MOMENT I change your soiled diapers, full of lust, and greed, and sin, and other such dispicable actions, and I love you so much that I'm happy- HAPPY to do it.""
This is such a humbling concept. My God, how much could you love me that You WILLINGLY change my soiled diapers everyday, leaving me clean of the filth of humanity.This is the tip of the iceburg, the merest understanding of Grace, and it's BEAUTIFUL.
Our God does this daily... cleanses us from such grossness that we bathe ourselves in...

I know that was an awful lot of information and ideas... hope I didn't lose you

And I love you"

"event","So I was on my way home on Saturday night, and (I'm not gonna lie) I was pretty upset, so I stopped at my prayer garden to pray and get a handle on my emotions- after all, I was driving, and I made a promise to someone long ago that if I ever got too upset to drive, I would pull over. So I went to my garden. And I walked through the bushes, past the flowers, to the little stone bench which has been so faithful to me in the past- a familiar friend with which I've spent much time. I sat down, still crying, and I utterly cried out to God, as I tend to do often when I take things into my own hands, and one thought struck me- you know when a certain verse pops up at a certain time and you KNOW it's God, right? And the verse that FILLED my head and thoughts was Matthew 11:29-30- ""Come to me, all who are heavy burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."" This is Jesus talking. First of all, a little background here- what the heck is a ""Yoke?"" In Jesus' day, the most respected people of the time were Rabbi's. This is what every Jewish male aspired to be, but few made it. Now each Rabbi took a certain amount of students- appretices, if you will- and taught them teh scriptures. However, each Rabbi had a different INTERPRETATION of what a lot of the scriptures meant. So each Rabbi's set of interpretations was called that Rabbi's ""yoke,"" and the goal of each student was to learn enough from the Rabbi to CARRY ON his yoke. And each of these yokes would be filled with rule after rule after rule, with different behaviors and traditions that one would have to follow... So when Jesus says, ""take MY yoke upon you, for (it) is easy and my burden is light,"" He's saying ""Hey! I don't require alot of rules or traditions. My yoke is easy to handle, easy to pass on, not tiresome (as the other Rabbi's yokes were) and it won't stress you out."" (Wow, that was some paraphrasing, huh!?!?!) Meaning that His yoke is based in love, not in tradition or rules or condemnation- and love is a lot easier to bear than those other things. But the part of this verse that really struck me Saturday night was the ""Come to me, all who are heavy burdened, and I will give you rest."" We really don't have an excuse to be heavy burdened, do we? Because we know where rest is found- IT SAYS SO RIGHT HERE. So when we are weighed down, and we are emotionally exhausted, and we carry on this way for who knows how long- it's really kind of ridiculous. Because we don't HAVE To carry on that way, because it says right here where we can find rest. So right now, a VERY emotionally confusing time of my life where I try to decipher where God wants me and when, it doesn't have to be burdensome to be a test of my faith- because if I'm burdened, Jesus tells me right here where to go. If my focus is where it should be, I shouldn't be miserable,because Jesus promises me REST.

I just woke up, and that was a lot of rambling to try and get my point across... I hope it made sense!"

"event","So this morning, one of my friends was leading worship at this Baptist church in Quincy, a small town just outside of Tallahassee. So we (two of my friends and I) decided to go and ""support"" him, because we haven't really settled on one church yet (I think the underlying issue is that I don't want to OFFICIALLY leave y'all!). So we went. Traditional... doesn't even begin to cover it. They sang 3 hymns, and that was the accumulation of worship this morning, which isn't persay BAD... but the Spirit of God wasn't in that place at all, and it seemed like that was ok with everyone- like there wasn't another alternative to that. The people were ABSOLUTELY sweet, and I've never been greeted by so many people on a Sunday morning IN MY LIFE (except in Poland), so that is most definitely in thier favor. They just... were complacent. It was the typical American church, and it was so sad! I wanted to jump up and scream ""You can have to much more than this! This is not what freedom in Christ is! This is not what INTIMACY with Christ is!"" But instead I sat, observed, and just...was a bit burdened (heavy-heart wise) for thier obvious bondage to church tradition. When the pastor prayed, it was as if he had rehearsed it before hand, because he prayed in like... almost old english. It sure wasn't modern speech. And it was filled with Christian Cliche's like ""Washed in the blood of the lamb,"" and things like that. The sermon was had good points, but mainly it was general and broad... it was about sin, and his main point was what we could do to oversome sin, and what Jesus tells us to do. His big thing was how to be better ""Christians,"" and on both of those points, all I could do was think about Ryan's message a few months ago, about how the biggest lie in church today is that WE can do it- but we can't, only Christ can. ""Only one person ever truly lived the Christian life, so they named it after Him."" (Ryan Jasper) I don't know if being a better ""Christian"" is even the point of why we're here. (I'm a little bit rambling here, but bear with me.) Is it possible to be a better ""Christian?"" Is that the point? Or are we just Christians period, and strive to be more like Christ? Because my thoughts tend to lie with the latter, that maybe the term ""Christian"" is so watered down today that the church no longer even knows what it means. To be a disciple... there's a lofty ambition worth striving after, which I guess is what the term ""Christian"" is supposed to be equivelant with. I'm sort of just writing as I think, in case you didn't get that. I'm trying very hard to seperate being judgemental of these people with what I'm actually feeling, and tha'ts compassion and a pity for them. The service seemed to be more out of tradition than that thier hearts were into it. I don't know what the point of al this ranting is... I guess be thankful. Be thankful that what y'all have at Faith Baptist and whatever anyone else has who's reading this...We have such a freedom in Christ, such a freedom to explore Him, to connect with Him, to see and feel and KNOW Him in our lives, and it's REAL, it's TANGIBLE, and it's not somehting we hear or read about...it's an experience we HAVE every DAY. Because that's not what it seemed like these people have, and they just represent the majority of American churches.What Christ offers us is much more than a Sunday morning service... He offers us a lifetime of more than we could ever imagine."

Patience is something that I very much struggle with, but the thought kind of struck me today that patience and faith are related.

I'm writing again...
Don't be freaked out by this one- I've written tons of poems about the depression I went to, but never about the triumph over the depression (thanks to God). So... I know it's intense, but so was that period of my life. So this is the story of God's victory over my past.


Monsters
I used to have demons in my eyes,
threatening my sanity,
disrupting my clarity,
Stealing my peace-
Thieves.

I could feel them,
my eyes,
fill up with Fear,
Anger,
Anguish...

The green took on a 
haunted hue,
the verge of madness
expressed about the pupils,
creeping into my state of mind,
infiltrating the core of me.

My Greatest Nightmare
during the day;
the Voices beat pans
and wailed proud thier warrior cry.

My hands,
of thier own volition (It would seem)
flew to my ears;
not to block out the sound,
which was from within,
but in an act of pure
desperation,
determined not to let normalcy slip.

My clenched fist would
beat and clutch at my heart,
warding such demons from
my vulnerability,
A fultile effort;
For they didn't have to be in it
to destroy it.

Eventually,
as always,
such voices triumphed,
thier manipulative battle strategies
too strategic for
my distress,
and I would be left broken,
stripped,
naked,
unprotected,
and weak.

Where to turn 
when one hates oneself?
Where to go 
when the dependence upon sanity
withers as a flower,
A VIBRANT flower
on a hot day?
Reduced to a molten pile
of brown leaves,
and shrivelled petals,
hopelessness set in.

PICK YOURSELF UP,
OUT OF THE FETAL POSITION!
BRUSH BACK STRAY HAIRS,
MOP UP YOUR FACE FROM
YOUR PITIFUL ATTACK!
They scream.

And then they temporarily fade,
to just constant whispers
in my ear,
rather than clanging symbols
in my mind...
Hide, do they,
so I question whether they were
there at all.
Until next time
my eyes are clear,
if slightly guarded,
until they fill up with the color
of madness.

Such demons were driven,
as cattle,
from the core of me-
from thier base there.

The hue of my eyes remains green,
streaks of yellow my only scar
from a battlefield
within.
Exhaustion,
from a lifetime of war,
couples with disbelief
that the battle for
the territory OF ME
rests now,
resolved,
and I am weak.

Such Power in such light,
Such gratefulness in such humility,
my captors freed, replaced by
a new captor-
One who has captured my heart.
A baby,
A Carpenter,
A Rabbi,
A Warrior-
One who has fought courageously for
my freedom,
and one who has been victorious."

Recognition
The Comfort of Familiarity
is often unrecognized.
The excitement of Growth anew,
skipping beats,
secret smiles,
unknown and loved;
But for Fear.

An Obstacle,
A Warning,
A Cage.

**CONTRAST**

A Temple of Knowing;
A well tread path,
country backroads,
Traditions ancient and seconds old,

the sacredness of the essence

"event","You know, it's funny. Here I am crying about what happened in New Orleans, and worrying about it and trying to decide when to go over and help... and to be honest, I was a bit mad at God. I BEGGED God not to let anyone die in that massive storm (lofty prayer, I know) and in my human eyes, He let me down. But He's so much bigger than that! And that's what I learned tonight. 
   It seems that most of the ""big ideas"" God plants in my head happen while I'm worhipping Him.. probably because it's one of the only times I'm COMPLETELY focused on Him. Tonight I went to a praise and worship time... you guys, don't take Dontae for granted... I haven't done praise and worship since I left home, and until tonight I didn't realize how bad it was killing me. So anyway, God kinda let me know how big He is tonight. You know, I kinda forgot that my God is the God of New Orleans too, and the God of Mississippi, AND the God of Alabama. He's in control, you know? And I always seem to lose sight of that. I worry like I can do something about what's happening over there, and God CAN do something about what's happening over there. Faith... so precious, because so easy to let go of. God must just shake His head and chuckle at my pathetic attempt of control and logic. Thank GOD that He knows me so thoroughly..."

    Well, this is it. The girl from the tiny town of Parrish, Florida moves to the capital of Florida. I've led so many completely different lives here... so many people weaving in and out, leaving thier mark on my life canvas... I'm so grateful for all my experiences that brought me here. However, life is about to change drastically again. You'd think after so many times of the bottom falling out of my world, I'd be used to it by now; but it always hurts the same. The difference is this; in this new life, the possibilities and where God could take me are endless, and for the first time, I recognize that. So through my fear, my hesitancy, my sorrow, my grief, my insecurity, my unsuredness, and my general ignorance, There is a ray of excitement over the verizons opening up to me. A new life, a new start, lessons learned to be put into effect. I bid a tearful goodbye to a little girl in a pink Tutu, put her and her experiences in a special place in my heart, and obligingly turn towards the start of adulthood.

Yes, I'm Emo.
And Yes, I did make up the word Unsuredness- it does not exist.
And if you want to hang out, call me soon, 'cause Saturday I'm outta here."

Pray for me, because my emotions are going crazy right now. My knowlege of what's right and the convictions of my heart do not necesarily coincide with what the longings of my heart are... Does that make sense? lol I'm being very emo...

"event","""Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will declare what He has done for my soul.""
                                                 -Psalm 66:16

This verse is amazing. I'm going through the book of psalms, and I stumbled upon this verse this morning. We should be ready to do this at a moment's notice! BEG people to ""hear,"" and be ready to ""declare what He has done for (our) soul(s)!!!"" Isn't this right here what evangelism is all about? Letting people know who God is, and what He's done in our lives? ""Declare"" has an authoritative ring to it, meaning that we should almost BOAST about what God's done for us; or we should say with complete certainty what God has done for us. Because we HAVE complete certainty. What He has done for my soul... where to even BEGIN??!!! This is our testimony in its purest form! Not some written out, cookie-cutter, step-by-step paragraph to be read from a paper... but what God has done for our SOULS. This begins with the gospel message, and moves onto what else He has been for you. For me, to name a few, He has been my Salvation, my stability, my comfort, my help, my safe place to go, my father, my friend, my joy, my peace, my redeemer (makes me new), my rock... and those are just a few! So what has God done for your soul, and are you out there declaring it?

Tomorrow I leave... and I won't be back 'till July 1st. Please, PLEASE keep me in your prayers. I'm going on a missions trip to Inner City New Orleans, which is filled with gangs and poverty. I'll be there for 10 days, back to back with a quick trip to Talahassee, back to back with a family vacation to Georgia, back to back with camp (for which I'm a counselor). Requests; (New Orleans) pray that I'll get over myself, and that I'll be ready and willing to share what God has done for my soul, like it says in this verse. Pray for safety, as there will be lots of immoral people (including gang members, etc). Pray for teh heartsx of children, as we'll be doing a VBS there. Pray for my own personal struggles, that they won't get in the way of my purpose there.
(Talahassee) I'm still not sure whether God wants me to move in the fall or not. This is basicaly dependent on whether or not I find a place to live, and thus the reason for teh short trip to Tally. So pray that God makes His will clear through this situation (find a place or not). (Georgia) This trip is more about rest and relaxation with my family (my WHOLE family; aunts, uncles, cousins, etc). However, my aunt and uncle both have no church, and (especially my aunt) thier position with God is unclear. Pray that I'll be a shining example of what Christ has done for me. (Camp) I'm going with the church I""ve been helping out in. I've never been a counselor before... lol I""ve never been to a camp before. Pray for flexability, as I can often struggle in that area. Pray that I'll have the right answers- GOD'S answers- if any girls come to me needing spiritual guidance. Pray for patience, as mine will be dwindling after such a long time away from my home, my own bed, and my comfort zone. Pray that God will use me in all ways possible throughout this trip, and for those of you who I'm not going with, God bless and I hope to see you after the 1st!

With Love,
       Courtney"

"event","Alright, friends, it's time again to sum up my semester and thank everything that made this semester possible. Keep in mind, if you have not looked at the TIME OF THIS POST, that it's 9:00 in the morning, so please make allowances in my coherence. First of all, I'd again like to thank MCC for being so freaking far from my house, and therefore forcing me to drive the freaking 40 minutes drive, three times a week, and wasting a tank of gas a week on that (oh the things we do for the sake of a low grade education). Next, I'd like to thank professor Frith, the male one, for being a stickler on timeliness, which almost killed me more than once. Thank you, Professor Frith, for giving me an hour a day to do just about anything but pay attention, including writing poems, making line leader lists, and generally trying hard not to fall asleep. Thank you, building 6 for not even HAVING A FREAKING BATHROOM IN THE WHOLE DANG BUILDING and therefore thank you, bathroom in the kercheck building, for having my back. (For those of you who are old school LJ readers, this is, indeed, the exploding toilet bathroom from my second semester.) (But apparently it forgave me for whatever it was so mad about.) A big shout out (lol, I'm showing my true colors, which is a gangsta rapper underneath this facade of a musical theater lover) to professor BUONANNO whom I love with the dearest of devotion. Seriously, if you're still stuck at good ol' MCC, take something with Buonanno- it'll almost make you happy to live in B-town. Buonanno, thank you for being short and bald, thank you for referring to yourself in the third person, thank you for loving words like ""damn"" and ""hell,"" which elicited from us the middle school giggle accompanied with a teacher using profanity. THank you for being gay,Democratic, and an avid athiest, and for being so very vocal about all of that. Thank you for your love for Emily Dickinson, and Langston Hughes, and for reminding me why I'm a literature major. In parting, I say to you ""The HELL does that mean?"", and I throw my pencil on the floor in your memory. Thank you, lunch break, for being at a completely inconvienient time (11-12), and for all of my friends NOT having the same break time : ). Thank you Taco Bell, Sonic, Dimetrios,Marlyssa's, Subway, and Rick's sub shop for providing me with the 5 extra pounds my hips seem to have discovered. Thank you to my Hannah Leigh, for working at Marlyssa's and therefore allowing me to talk to someone over lunch. Thank you to Semerra (whose name I KNOW I spelled wrong) for accompanying me once. Thank you to Aaron, Ashley, and Tedmyhero for accompanying me another time. And MS. LEXI!!!! I so thoroughly enjoyed our lunches together, and getting to know you. I love you with all my hand, Ms. Lexi, I love you with all my hand. Thank you to my math professor, who never seemed to care taht I was at least 10 minutes late to math every day. Thank you to John in that class, who never came, and who I therefore credit with the fact taht I probably failed the final (because I was helping him instead of studying). Thank you to the professor, who wore very... creative... costumes to class everyday, making us feel more like we're in the circus instead of in a math class. Maybe it's a whole new way of learning... everyone should try it... except for Buonanno, of course, who already wears spandex Armani shirts every day (I know! I didn't know Armani made spandex either!). Thank you to Kathrine and... the other girl, who filled me in when I was done looking out the window wishing I was anywhere but there. Thank you to the kid in the first row who had a giant tatoo of a Swedish Beer Maid for reminding me why I haven't gotten a tatoo yet. Thank you, most of all, to Doug, the Hot Jock who sat next to me (see the summary of semester TWO) for making class delightfully entertaining and for hitting on me in new and various ways; it's refreshing to see that guys really can come up with new ways to do taht. Whenever I was feeling a bit down about myself, I could always count on the hot jock to lift my spirits. Moving on to what will be Hannah Leigh's favorite part of this summary; the bathroom. No, the bathroom first and then Hannah's favorite part (just WAIT, Hannah Leigh- be PATIENT!!! GOSH!). Thank you to the bathroom in bulding 18 for being so freaking far away from bulding 27, and therefore almost causing me to explode countless times as I haul my gigantic bookbag across campus on a more than full bladder. However, I must say that building 18's bathrooms have always had my back, being relatively clean and useable (haha I pulled ""useable"" out of my butt 'cause I didn't have another adjective). Thank you to  Ms. Jett (here you go, Hannah)for being so understanding that due to my daily trek from 27, I was late every day. Thank you to Ms. Jett in general for being an alchoholic woman who used to (and I seriously think probably still does) smoke pot quite regularly. Quotes from this class as follows; ""There's nothing wrong with marijuana- I used to smoke it all the time!""  ""The school didn't hasn't always been such a stickler on alchohol- my students and I used to have shots before classes all the time from the little flask I kept in my desk!""    ""I don't usually have trouble sleeping after a few blasses of brandy and a glass of wine."" ""Ms. Jett- what do you think of alchohol?"" ""I LIKE it!""
Mad props, Ms. Jett, for being such an enforcer of intoxicants. Thank you to Jerrod, who always made me smile with his little comments. Thank you to Jacob, for enlightening me on the Jewish faith, and for makign me laugh with his absolutely insane hair that WASN'T on purpose. Thank you to Austin, who found old and previously exhausted ways to hit on a girl and used them quite regularly with the unmistakeable confidence of a jock, and who brought in Jello shooters for his visual aid project (which dissapointed me, 'cause I really wanted Jello!). Thank you to Jonni, who shut me down, and who was a bit of an idiot ( in the girly, flirty way that I am not). Thank you to Rosie for being cute ('cause she was pregnant) and to Snehal and Chris, adamant lovers of drinking. Thank you to Christina and Michelle, who were cute and probably the best friends I made in that class. Thank you to Matteo, for being Italian (and therefore attractive) and for also being a big fan of drinking (alchohol was really the theme of speech class this semester). Thank you to David, for also being a fan of marijuana and vocalizing it frequently, and lastly, thank you to Olivia, for being from Canada (""Good Afternoooooon, I'm OOOOOOlivia!"") and who had the guts to do her personal experience speech on how to artificially inseminate a cow. Thank you to my trusty truck, who lived through another semester with only a few complaints from the ol' AC. Thank you to various people throughout the day; to Ms. Lexi, whom I love, to Mr. Bierly, who brightened my day every time I saw him, to My Hannah Leigh, whose friendship I am more grateful for than food (unless I was starving, in which case I would be more grateful for than... umm... shoes). To Tim, who I hesitate to include, but who contributed to the overall experience of this semester. You brightened most days, and I am thankful for the time I spent with you. I definitely learned a lot from you and from being with you. To CVS pharmacy, for stocking green tea (which I bought everyday- how many children around the world could've been fed with THAT money!?). TO my good friend Dave, whom I'm happy to report I still talk to, and my Amber Tiffany, whom I also love more than shoes. And, of course, Trevor, who is my stability in life, and who I can depend on for anything. You got me through some rough times, T, and I am more grateful for that than shoes as well. (Please don't ask me where ""shoes"" came from, I credit it to the hour of morning.) Thank you to the hope of new opportunities and the fufillment of old ones. Thank you to the Bible for being so amazingly awesome and for setting the stage for each day. Thank you most of all to God, my savior, my rock, my comfort, my strength, my hope. Thank you, God, for the ability to move on. Thank you, God, for the strength you offer when I have none. Thank you, God, for the insights, the realizations, the hope of new horizons and dawning of every day. Thank you, God, for the joyous blessings You've mercifully bestowed on me, like my kids, and my friends, and my family. I definitely grew up a lot this semester, and am ready to see what the world holds for me; or rather, show the world what God holds for it.
        And with that, this semester is closed."

""Jo, tell me about what you learned about lizards today.""
""Umm... lizards are green and they livein families, and one day they'll all fly away!""
""Do lizards fly?""
""Umm... some do.""
""Really?""
""Yeah! they're called... lizardflies! And there's lots of different kinds, too! There's regular lizardflies, and there's... frog lizardflies, and there's... birdlizardflies, and there's... only one more kind...KANGAROO lizardflies!!!""

"event","It's funny, the way He works, isn't it? Not surprisingly, He's quite clever. No matter how far one runs, or drifts, or strays, He's still there. Regardless, one can still feel Him. Not with the same strength one once did, or perhaps stronger than one has before, but either way He's still there. It's almost like... there's this compartment BEHIND the heart, reinforcing it, compensating for its frailty. And it's His space, and His alone. It is the space that so many attempt to fill- and fail. He consumes it. Sometimes that fire burns, until it consumes your entire heart along with it. Sometimes it's not so consuming, and it flickers and smolders. But I do know that even when I""m doing nothing to stoke that fire, I can still feel it. It's a sense of peace, of purity, of understanding, of comfort, of a blanket of hope over pain. It's further proof of His amazing love. When I should be feeling grief, of pain, it's dimmed down to a dull ache, and invaded by gratitude, peace, and anticipation. And while that dull ache flares up, it dies back down, kept in its place by comfort. It doens't make much sense, but then, His workings seldom do. Though huge decisions await me, regardless of how monumentous they seem, I remain calm, and not of my own strength. So praise be to Him that we're so covered, so protected, so... cherished. Personally and individually cherished.

'Cause someone says they're so.
Some things I cannot change-
But 'till I try, I'll never know!
Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love- I guess I've lost.
But if that's love,
It comes at much too high a cost!

Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity-
and you can't pull me down.""

"event","True to tradition (and by tradition I mean once before) it is time to wrap up the semester. This semester was, on a whole, not as good as last semester. Sad, sad day. But it still had it's high and VERY VERY low points.Alright... here we go. In the beginning... was the coffeemaker. Thank you to teh coffee maker for takign so blasted long to make me a cup of coffee, therefore makign me late getting into the shower, and therefore making me late to my first class very close to EVERY DAY. (That's right, I blame you). Thank you to Tim and other factors for keeping me up late so that I seldom got enough sleep. Thank you to, yet again, the building 9 bathroom, which still smells awful. Thanks to my first teacher for never making that big of a deal about me beign late to every class except for 3, and for being at 8:00 in the freaking morning, making it oh so tempting to skip. Thank you for writing off 9 absences due to my job, and thank you for not failing me on that paper due to my personality type. (First time my personality's gotten me out of anything!) Thank you to The Gay Hot Couple, who entertained me for a very short time but sadly dropped the class, and thank you to the hot kid who is obsessed with Bob Marley. Overall, to my 8:00 class, thank you for failing, because I still have no idea what I want to do. Moving on... Thank you Tim for being late almost every day, making me late to Chemistry almost every class.Thank you to Chemistry, that horrid subject that for some reason we need to comprehend, though we (and by we I mean I) can take my whole life and STILL NEVER COMPREHEND. Although... Big thanks to Ian and Tim, who made that class a blast despite the awful su bject manner; Thank you Ian for my daily hugs and Tim for being the worst lab partner in the world, other than of course, me. Thank you to Professor Gambino, who tried her hardest and surprisingly didn't fail at makign me understand science. Thank you for that blessed 10 minute break in the middle of the class, my only reprive for 2 hours 2 days a week. Thank you WITHDRAWN for being a two hour class, and, by nature, horrendous. BUT, OVERALL TO CHEMISTRY, thank you for only benig on Mondays and Wednesdays, because the best part of the Chemistry of Everyday Life was not having it on Fridays. Thank you Ian and Tim for entertaining me in the student union until MY Tim got out. I had a total blast with you guys- you were my Dave and Levi for this semester. Thank you to the Student Union bathroom for, for hte most part, being clean every day.Thank you to Tim, who walked  me to Economics everyday and pissed the teacher off by kissing me in front of him every afternoon, and of course making me slightly late to every class. Thank you to my Economics teacher, for being a great guy but a crappy teacher and of course, for making comments about Tim kissing me in front of him to basically the entire class. Thank you to the United States and worldwide economies, for being so entirely hard to understand. Thank you to the tests for being impossible to get above a ""C"" on, and thank you to the Mike Barber look alike who was utterly amused by T and I. Thank you to the EXTREMELY hot kid, just for being hot each class. And of course, thank you Trevor, for cracking me up every class, making me lose focus, and therefore get a glare from the only teacher who's every truly hated me in my entire life; it was worth it, man- good times, great oldies. Thanks again, T, for eating lunch with me everyday. in that aspect, thank you to fast food for making me.. umm... a bit thicker aroudn the middle but for also for being so readily available. (That includes Marlyssa's, Subway, Rick's Sub Place,Sonic, Taco Bell, and wherever else on the list of 30.) Thanks be to you, T, for making school days not suck as much. Thank you to the building 18 bathroom, for being clean and not smelling bad. Thank you to Contemporary Literature, for existing in general, and for being the only class I refused to skip. Thank you to Professor Cole, who came in most classes looking high as a bird. (Perhaps it's a constant state.) Thank you to.. geez... let's see... To the hilarious kid, for cracking me up every class, andto his girlfriend, who was his polar opposite, but not in a bad way. Thank you to the kid with long hair, who, combined with the hilarious kid, dressed up as Indians and gave a presentation as female indians on a reservation (complete with the horse head on a stick, which also made sound effects!!) which was possibly the funniest class I've ever attended. Thank you to Jen, for being adorable. Thank you to The two girls whose names I can't remember, one for being anal andthe other for being hilarious. You both deserve the credit that you're due, but your names escape my mind currently, so sorry 'bout your luck. Thanks to Edward and Bobby, for being adorable and hilarious, and for staring me down every class. Thanks to Scott, who was unafraid to give his opinion and who I could never quite tell was gay or straight. Thank you to homegirl with the red hair, who was just plain irritating. But, SCHOOLING her in the irritating catagory, thanks be to Ed, who was possibly the most aggrivating, annoying man I've ever encountered, who always gave his opinion, regardless of whether it had any base of facts to back it up, who made everyone's eyes widen in irritation when that pen went up in the air to give his point, and who was, in general, an idiot. Thanks, of course, to Brandon, whose work I did the entire semester, but who entertained me in class and who gave me someone to sit with so I didn't look like a pitiful reject. Thanks man, for being ""consistent."" Thanks to Lit in general, for by far being my favorite class. Thanks to everything listed, plus somemore; thanks be to Hannah Leigh, who I seldom saw but when I did, made my whole day. And of course, thanks to Tim, my boy, who made most days easier and better just by walking me to class and being, OCCASIONALLY, pretty dang freaking sweet. Thanks to my truck for continuing to suck gas to and from MCC, and thanks to MCC for being so far from my house. Overall, this semester had good points and bad points. It was a good semester, THANK GOODNESS my last semester of high school (As of today, I dont' have that irritating title hanging over me). OH!!! Thanks to Brian Peacock, for owning such a gorgeous piece of machinery as his GIANT F150. (Lol, couldn't leave that one out!) And this brings this semester to an end. Another 3 months of my life, done with. No more Chemistry, no more Economics, but also no more lunches with T and Tim walking me to class and LIT classes with Brandon. Now I eagerly (tha'ts a lie) await next semester..."

"event","Words Women Use

Study this and know it!

FINE

This is the word women use to end an argument when they feel they are right and you need to shut up. Never use ""fine"" to describe how a woman looks this will cause you to have one of those arguments.

FIVE MINUTES

This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.

NOTHING

This means ""something"", and you should be on your toes. ""Nothing"" is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. 'Nothing"" usually signifies an
argument that will last ""Five Minutes"" and end with 'Fine'.

GO AHEAD (With Raised Eyebrows)

This is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting upset over ""Nothing"" and will end with the word ""Fine"".

GO AHEAD (Normal Eyebrows)

This means ""I give up"" or ""do what you want because I don't care"" You will get a ""Raised Eyebrow Go Ahead"" in just a few minutes, followed by Nothing"" and ""Fine"" and she will talk to you in about ""Five Minutes"" when she cools off.

LOUD SIGH

This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A ""Loud Sigh"" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment, and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over ""Nothing"".

SOFT SIGH

Again, not a word, but a non-verbal statement. ""Soft Sighs"" mean that she is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe, and she will stay content.

THAT'S OKAY

This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. ""That's Okay"" means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you back for whatever it is that you have done. ""That's Okay"" is often used with the word ""Fine"" and in conjunction with a ""Raised Eyebrow.

GO AHEAD.

At some point in the near future, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.

PLEASE DO

This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance with the truth, so be careful
and you shouldn't get a ""That's Okay.""

THANKS

A woman is thanking you. Do not faint. Just say you're welcome.

THANKS A LOT

This is much different from ""Thanks."" A woman will say, ""Thanks A Lot"" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have offended her in some callous way, and will be followed by the ""Loud Sigh."" Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the ""Loud Sigh,"" as she will only tell you ""Nothing."""

A little girl
shy, timid,
captivating eyes-
so sad.
So young for such large tears.
A shaking hand 
holds out a 
flower for sale,
all she's got to offer
and for you to take.
A vibrant rose,
only source of color in her life.
Scraggly hair falls into her eyes
blinding her,
scaring her,
covering up her colorless face.
Her eyes plead with you to buy her treasure
her lifeline,
offered to you.
Wordlessly your cold eyes asses her.
You reach out,
and hope floods into her eyes,
temporarily replacing fear.
You take her rose,
twirl it,
play with her,
and drop the red symbol
to the gray ground.
Turn, walk away,
run and don't let
your emotions catch up.
Return to the bustle of gray life.
IF you look back,
you'll see her rejected form
bend,
retrieve her dirtied prize,
harbor it against her malnourished chest-
skin and bones.
IF you look back,
you'll see her raise
her empty eyes
to the gray sky,
and disappear into the rain.




A Girl's Rebellion

Perhaps today you don't deserve
the extra few minutes I spend on my
hair and make up.
Perhaps today I'll just put it in a ponytail,
whether you like it or not.
Perhaps today I'll brush YOU off.
Perhaps today I'll be secretive,
harboring my thoughts to myself
to make you overthink-
because perhaps today that's what
you deserve.
Perhaps today I'll purposefully
mention other guys,
and mention and mention
until I see jealousy 
creep into your eyes.
Perhaps today I'll keep my
stolen glances and
whispered ""I love You's""
to myself,
because perhaps today you 
you don't deserve them.
Perhaps today I'll
mourn the loss
of my dreams of my castle
and royal treatment,
and while mourning
make you pay.
Just for today though.
Or perhaps the next few moments.
For I'm female-
I am weak when it comes to you.
Perhaps today I'll wear a blank stare-
just to see if you care-
prove the emotions are there.
Because perhaps today,
that's what you deserve.



A Poem that Does Not Mourn

Hope is alive,
refusing to be tampered 
despite my most valiant efforts.
My heart leaps,
skipping beats,
until it pauses in my throat
with fear or joy?
Or perhaps they are the same.
Lifelong hesitation is killed by
a few moonlit nights and
stolen glances
as I allow my once clear vision to
fade into starry eyes and
secret thoughts.
Never have I been so thoroughly feminine.
My arms ache with emptiness amidst
countless faces,
but the kind that will soon fade
as it is filled.
The exhilarating risk of the unknown elicits
pure fear,
but triumphs over 
lying in the comforting,
familiar
puddle of my own tears.
Smiles as secret as the Mona Lisa's
grace my lips
as my eyes glass over,
lost in the thought of you.
My face boasts the same king of
serene happiness
as a young woman who just found out-
but don't tell yet.
Her secret to keep,
soon her secret to share.
A kind of secret that
transforms a farm girl into a queen,
a kind of secret that
beckons even the hardest man to care;
a kind of secret that
takes a plain girl such as I
and whispers into her the breath that is
irresistibly woman.
So glorious,
this thing called love."

"event","That's right, I GOT A JOB!!! And I am so happy I didn't settle or anything, that I waited until I got a job I LOVE; 'cause I love my job, y'all have no idea. I get EXCITED when I think about going to work! I work at Wee World Preschool (I went there as a chillin!) and I work in the three's (with three year olds). I have seriously the best kids in the world. Just since I started working there (last wednesday) I have been so much happier. Kids are so... healing, you know? Just the spirit of a child. One little girl told me she loved me yesterday, and I seriously thought I was gonna cry. Sorry about that emo post last time; truth is, I love my job, I love my kids, and I love my God, who had my back the entire time I was looking for a job and brought the perfect one at the perfect time.
       God has really blessed me with a lot. A great job, great friends, an AWESOME family, and other... people who make my life better and bring a smile to my face.
    1st Samuel 16:7- ""But the Lord said to Samuel, ""Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature, because I have refused him. For the Lord does not see as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.""
      How amazing is this verse? For once, SOMETHING in this world that is not based on physical appearance; your worth. How much you're loved. Because it says right here that God looks at your heart. WHO IN THE HECK CARES WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE??? There obviously is not much stock in that! Which brings up an interesting point... what kind of condition is your heart in? Because if God looks at the heart... what is He seeing? I can look dang good, but if my heart isn't beautiful, than who cares? Because WHO I AM is not how i look, it's what I'm thinking, what I'm feeling, my outlook on things and my worldview. And taht's what God sees. And hallelujah for that, or we'd all be screwed. So I guess you could say (I'm thinking as I type now) that LOVE is not based in any way shape or form on ANYTHING physical, because if God only cares about the heart, and God IS love, than that must be what LOVE IS, simply by definition. Hmm... something to ponder.

Something that's been on my mind... happiness is purely circumstantial, and therefore undependable. I want my joy back."

"event","If I were a witch, I'd melt outside. This I have decided. 'Cause it's dang freaking hot out.

Lately I feel a little tossed around. Today I go to work, to sub for someone, and come Monday, there's a 90% chance I have a job. This is SOOO exciting for me, 'cause it has to be one of the most fun jobs in the world (working at a Christian daycare center) but at the same time I'm a bit apprehensive. Because it begins now. Starting now, I work forever. Starting now, I begin the process of branching out of my house, of making decisions, bring in income, growing up in general. My fairytale childhood has ended, and I am currently stuck in between. In between what? I'm not exactly sure how to explain it. I'm not on my own, I'm still idealistic and naive, but the process of attempting to be realistic and sensible has begun. Now is when little pieces of myself has to be exchanged for reality; when dreams of big trucks turn into sensible 5 passenger cars with good gas mileage; when dreams of travelling and freedom turn into a 5 day, 8 hour job; when dreams face reality and vanquish into cute nothings you look back on and smile at your youthfulness. And though I'm not ready for that, I need to be, 'cause I can't afford to be as young as I am right now forever. I guess I'm most scared of trading in what is important to me; giving into society's expectations instead of what I hold dear. And I'm not talking about my values, or morals. I'm talkign about things like individuality, freedom, idealisticness, and, to some extent, ignorance. Because to fit in with society is to be caged by society. I broke out of that cage once; I know to do what I want to do, to support a family and be quote-on-quote ""successful,"" I need to willingly have myself locked up again and accept things like professional clothing verses comfort, biting my tongue verses freedom of expression. And though this seems normal, this seems like ""get over it Courtney, this has to be done sooner or later,"" my answer to you is I know this, and that's why I'm doing it now. I might as well get it over with. And this is not saying I'm giving up my personality; I just have to trade in parts of it to make it anywhere in this world. And though my treasure is not in this world, for now, I have to live in it. With this comes a sense of absolute, tragic loss and defeat, as well as a sense of bleakness and brokeness. But if sensibility is what I must become, then I'll give it a shot...

... and years from now I""ll look back to this time in my life and remember with longing how I yearn to be...


free

""I will change the world tonight, I will change the world tonight, I will change the world tonight, I will change the world tonight...""

Hey you- I'm trying. I'm so sorry about everything right now. Know that I'm here for you, no matter what. I'm trying not to be scared..."

The pot is on the burner.
You slip on your mask,
and jest for your invisible audience.
I dream and wait,
captured in my cage of you.
Collect your pennies of amusement
while I wait, stirring.
The shallow coins
drop into your upturned palm,
more comforting than judgement,
your mask your home.
I wait, stirring
on my emotional seasaw;
elation is pure,
rejection familiar.
Back and forth.
And yet hopeful, I stir,
bathing in justified anger.
Come home, love, or let me free.
Your show is over,
and you dwell in the ally of lonliness,
your mask beautiful,
your heart aching.
And still I stir, waiting.
Come home, love, supper's on.
Leave your shield in the filth,
for the imagined war is over.
Come quickly, love,
for the pot's getting cold.
Call again in two weeks.

"event","Peru was amazing. God changed my life, which I begged Him the entire time to do. I realized that I have a purpose in life, and it's not to putz around until He takes me. I knew that before, but now it's a reality. We truly had an amazing trip. I can't fit 18 days worth of doing God's work into this lj, but I can highlight a few events;

Our team did some puppet and clown ministries while we were in Peru. The funny thing about it is that we weren't prepared for these minitries AT ALL. For real. A week before the trip, we weren't even sure if we were going ot do them at all. We did two children's festivals; one at the church in Lima, and another in this lady's house in a section of Lima called San Juan. The first went well but the second... isn't it amazing how God can use even the minimalest efforts to bring HIm glory? Because through our unpracticed puppets and our highly unprofessional clowning, God brought 13 people to Himself for the first time. 13!!!!! 10 kids, 3 adults.

Later that night, we did a concert as an outreach. Keep in mind that all of us were getting sick, and I was pretty dang worried about it, 'cuase I had to sing. So as the days drew closer to the night of the concert, my vioce grew hoarser, the more worried I got, and the more God insisted I trust Him. So I did. At Saturday afternoon's practice, I could barely hit alto notes because my voice was so hoarse. And still God said ""trust Me."" So I got up on stage Saturday night and just worshipped Him, 'cause I realized that's what it's all about, and I could hit SOPRANO notes. God gave me my own little miracle.. Trust ME, God is trustable...

That night was the best night there for me. One of our most unexpected and yet most rewarding ministries there was working with the street kids. These kids had nothing.. they would come down from the hills (the poor area of town; there were barely houses up there, just slabs of plywood and cardboard) and do whatever they possibly could to earn money during the day; beg, sell small pieces of candy, do odd jobs, and then at night they'd go back to the hills. Let me tell you, we fell in love with these kids. At least, I know I did. Their cheerful faces, despite the dirt, the smell, the same threadborn clothes everyday in cold weather... and yet they were happy. And gosh I loved them. It got to the point to where our group couldn't even step outside the church without being surrounded by a group of them. At the concert on Saturday night, the youth pastor who took us gave the message, and my friend Andrew translated for him. I was sitting in between two streete kids. The one to my right was dead asleep, but Terri, the one on my left, was paying rapt attention. When Rob (pastor) prayed, and Andrew tranlated the prayer, Terri beside me repeated the prayer. So I asked him in spanish if he needed to talk to someone about what he just prayed, and he said he'd like to (he couldn't 've been more than 7 or 8). So he sat down with Rodrigo and Joel, two of the boys in the Peruvian youth group, and they talked to him and prayed with him and our first little boy accepted Christ as his savior. Then a girl named Corina sat down with two other little boys, Fedrik, who was one that we knew that best, and Diego, Terri's brother, and they both prayed and accepted God as well. Then Corina sat down with one other little boy, Jose, and Jose accepted God, too. So four of our kids accepted Jesus in one night. I can't remember a time when I was so happy. I was BAWLING. I had to literally leave the room 'cause the boys thought I was mad at them! It was so incredible...17 in one day!

So much more happened in Peru than this, and maybe I'll write more later. Please be praying for our kids, the four who accepted Christ and the million other street kids in Lima who are still out there, lost. Pray that these boys will continue growing in their faith, and that they'll bring their friends to the same hope they have, 'cause that's the only thing they've got. You know what kills me? That it was so easy. That it only took less than 2 weeks of doing nothing more than loving them for them to see Christ's love. Why aren't we like that? Oh to have the faith of a child...

I miss my kids."

"event","Wow. Wo-ow, it's early. (Like how it's SO early that ""wow"" is now a two syllable word?) I seriously have not seen this early in a while, and I'm butt-freaking tired, so bear with me if this entry is a bit scrambled.
This is my last entry before Peru. We leave Monday, and there really isn't any other time to do this... except now, butt-freaking early in the morning. : )

The trip is coming together... more. I still wouldn't go as far as to call us PREPARED, but we're not gonna TOTALLY EMBARRASS ourselves and everything we stand for now, so that's always a plus before leaving the continent. Just... we need a lot of prayer. There are so many things happening ""coincidentally"" before this trip that could shift our focus entirely... that IS shifting some people's focus entirely already, and we're still sitting in good ol' b-town. One couple who's been together a while just broke up, and not exactly on... good terms. There's another couple... in the brewing maybe? Who knows, but I'm worried about it. And there are just so many other little things that could shift our eyes off of where they need to be, and that's God. I don't really feel ready for this trip, mentally or spiritually. Before Italy, they MADE SURE that we sat down and confronted our issues AS A GROUP to make sure they were hammered out, and we had the maturity to do that. This whole dancing around the issues crap... call me crazy, but something tells me there's easier ways to solve things. I know in my own life I have A LOT on my mind right now that I'm trying to clear... it's really not as easy as it sounds. God help me... that's the only way it's gonna work. Other than all that, I'm getting fired up. I'm gonna go teach english, which I love, to a bunch of kids, which I love, for God, Whom I love. How awesome is that?
   How is it that I can be so fired up and yet so lacking at the same time?
I don't know. But with people's prayers behind us, and more importantly with GOD behind us, we can make a difference in Peru, no matter how slight, and that's what it's really about. If puppets and clowning fails, if the english lessons bomb out, we're still Christians regardless, and God can most certainly still use us. I guess that's the main point of going, right?
   Courtney just keep your eye on the ball...eventually you'll hit something. Haha I've got a really awesome coach...
How is it that the most non-athletic person in the world uses a sports analogy? Blame the hour...
   So I guess the moral of the story is that we're going, God's watching our backs, and we could really use your prayers. So..umm... please pray. Hard Core prayer.

Hey you... I really am gonna miss you. A bit. : )

He knew exactly what I needed and provided with me with it last night at Powernight. Let me tell you guys... this was no Powernight... last night was a freaking revival or something. It was INTENSE. I am so thankful for people who overcome thier fears to encouage others.. who (unlike me) suck it up and get up there and say what God has put on their hearts. Who have the GUTS to tell a whole group of kids (who are not always kind, not always accepting, not always...OPEN) their struggles for the sole purpose of encouaging us. And I repect them more than anyone else. The worship was intense, and it was nice to spend a night with God. It's been a while since God and I just hung out, and it was... He is... amazing.

JASON SOLARI UPDATES. This last newsletter was fairly amusing. I'm not sure exactly what the deal is, but it has somehting to do with the fact that he's in a Muslim country that they have to be careful what they write and such on the internet... so he used ""dad"" for ""God"" and ""thinking"" for ""praying."" I'm far too lazy to write all this... haha let me introduce you to my good friend ""copy and paste...""
(From Jason) ""I will try to explain everything when i get back to australia. Our team should be arriving in australia on July 15th. We are having troubles with our flight reservations. They have all been cancelled. We are trying to fix the situation now. So please ""think"" of us...Ok for real, things in the united states of Egypt are awesome. Our hmmm, how do i say this, sounds like face, but ends with a ""ith"" instead of a ""ce"", is growing very much. Our group is in very high spirits...Then our team was hit pretty hard by the 'creepy ugly dude'. I got an e-mail that a friend of mine has been hospitalized from a car accident, and Krista got an e-mail saying that her grandmother had passed away. It was a hard day, but we pulled through by uniting and ""thinking"" through it. We have become stronger through it, and are again ready to do whatever is needed...We have alot to do in the next 2 weeks, so please ""think"" of us when you get a chance. Thank you guys so much for your support. 

Jason 
for team africa

So I guess the point is still be praying for Jason. Please (still) be in prayer for our Peru team, as well, as we leave one week from Monday (CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY)
We're not exactly prepared as of right now, so pray for that, but in the midst of having 8364836 things to do before we leave, please also pray taht we don't lost our focus.

Hmm... some kind of story to follow up this post.... I GOT IT! I went over to my friend Calvin's house (who is on my Peru team) (A group of us went) (I have no idea why I'm using so many parenthesees) to work on our english lessons we need to have prepared for the trip. So my friend Tiffany was sitting by the window when there was some kind of... CRITTER flew up behind her. You guys, never in a million years would I have guessed it was a chicken. Maybe because I've never actually SEEN a chicken before, and maybe because really- how many chickens fly up every day and sit on YOUR window sill? So I was DYING. I was laughing so hard. BUT IT GETS BETTER. I thought it was funny when it was a random chicken, but apparently i'ts Calvin's family's PET. So they brought it inside (where it usually is apparently) and Calvin got the DOG to chase thie CHICKEN around the house, and I about... bust a gut doens't begin to describe it. Not even close. There were definitely tears involved, let's put it that way. SO there's my funny story.

Not to get seriuos again, but oh well deal with it. Please pray for me right now, as I'm trying to figure out God's will for many aspects of my life. Haha You all know what I""m talking about...It's not an easy task necesarily. So please ""think"" of me.

I love you all so much, and am so thankful for the lj as an outlet... if it's pointless for oyu all to read I apologize : )

-Hebrews 13:17

I'd never quite thought about it this way. It's amazing how many times you can read the Bible and yet get something different every time! I've read Hebrews before, but going over this verse last night was... new, I guess. I've never thought about submitting to authority from my AUTHORITY'S viewpoint. This is right; no matter who your authority is, they have to give an accoutn to someone. If it's your parents (mine is) your parents are expected to give a report to God (not that God doesn't already know what's oging on... yeah) Sorry if I'm a bit scattered right now, but I'm trying to convey what this verse oke in me as best I can. I guess MY life is easier if I make my AUTHORITY'S life easier. This is not an idea that is... well supported by the American culture, but no matter what way you look at it, submitting to authority is pleasing God; bottom line. 

I'm SOOOO freaking excited; Powernight IS GOING ON THIS FRIDAY NIGHT!!!!! 9:00 on Friday at Sarasota Christian School. I don't know.. maybe a visit to Coldstone afterwards.

Please pray for the preparations needed to be done before we leave for Peru. We only have a week and a half before we leave, and while I belive whatever God wants to happen will happen on this trip, we are no where near prepared. So.. please PLEASE be in prayer for my team. I've also got some... decisions to be praying over in my own life, so please be praying for God's obvious guiding for me right now.

I hope your summer continues to be marvelous!"

The other thing is I'm getting a little... well, I guess discouraged. I'm not usually a person who stays inside and doesn't talk to people, so this is not easy for me. Once I get discouraged, then I get kinda lonely, adn then I start to get just a little bit depressed. So please pray for taht too.

I don't really have anything else to say, other than that I saw Spiderman 2 last night, and Kirsten Dunst really bothers me. I'd say teh villian is a better PLAYED villian (acting wise) but some part's were a little too dramatic, adn therefore kinda... umm.. lame.

"event","Oh my goodness. God has blessed my life so greatly and I go through times of taking that for granted. I have an amazing family who loves me more than I could ever imagine, and I'm not just talking about my immediate family. I think God for my parent's salvation, because that has saved my life. But I also thank God for my ENTIRE family's salvation and support. I have these amazing friends who'd do anything at all for me, people who have taken residence in my heart and who will always be there. You guys, I love you so much, you have no idea. God has blessed me so greatly with y'all's friendship...
But today I was sitting in church today and realized that God has blessed me with an amazing church family. I go to a small community church where people truly care about each other... where we are supported and loved so deeply in Christ. I am surrounded by a ""cloud of witnesses,"" and I owe everything to God.
But most of all, God gave me the most perfect, amazing gift I could've ever asked for; salvation and pure, unadulterated love. And that is enough for me. I have realized that this week. For while I may still get lonely (and I quite frequently do) God has someone out there who's gonna blow me away, who exceeds all my expectations- and if that person never comes, I""ve already got someone who exceeds all my expectations, and that someone is Jesus Christ. That is enough for me... I can honestly say that now.

Y'all know I love to sit and plot out my life. So... I've been thinking and I've decided that when I die, I really, REALLY want a party instead of a funeral. NOT that I'm dying or anything, so don't freak out when you read this, but I""ve been thinking about my life and the way I've lived it and I want people to CELEBRATE when my life is over, not cry about it forever. I'm going somewhere where I sure won't be crying, so why should people here be bummed? So if anything ever happens to me, and I""ve already made Trevor promise this, I want everyone to throw a party. A party with streamers and pointy party hats with lame cartoon characters on them. And Kazoos. And, under NO CIRCUMSTANCES may anyone show up at my funeral/party wearing black (sorry emo kids). Everyone should come wearing bright colors and if you don't own bright colors, go buy one of those like $2 Hawaiian shirts. So... if some random day you read my obit in the paper, bust out your kazoos, go buy some lame streamers, and call Trevor, who will have forgotten about his promise. : )

When, out of curiosity, do you stop missing people? Has anyone found out? When does your heart stop clenching when you think of them? Because I'm ready to be done with these feelings. ***Psalm 34:18***

I was going over the book of James yesterday, and ch1:26 caught my eye; "" If anyone considers himself to be religeous, and yet does not keep a tight reign on his tongue, he decieves himself and his religion is worthless."" Yeah. Pick me. To begin with, there are few words in the english language which I despise more than the word ""religion,"" so let's replace it with ""faith.""  I don't have a filthy mouth, but it sure could get cleaner, and the tempation to say.. um.. NOT clean stuff is always underlying. When you trip (which I do OFTEN- I'm a huge klutz) when you're embarassed, when something breaks, when something doesn't go your way, we justify the language that we use because ""we're mad."" I've heard it a million times and I've said it a million times. But it says right here that if we don't keep a TIGHT reign- and it for sure TAKES a tight reign to keep our tongues under control- then the faith which we profess to have is worthless in God's eyes. Just a thought, and for me a conviction.

I figure I'll follow my sermon with a story. So last night I felt like a slurpee, and me, my friend Tim, and Amber went up to 7-11 to get some. So Amber (who by this time has worked a 8 hour day and is amazingly out of it) goes to pay for hers and KNOCKS MY SLURPEE OVER, which shoots all over the cashier and the counter top. I seriously about lost it.
Dodgeball (the movie)- Ehhh... some funny parts, mostly stupid, and TOTALLY out of control. I'ts definitely random. If you're concerned with countless innuendos, a ton of cursing, and you hate stupid humor, aviod it. I don't think I would see it again...

POWERNIGHT THIS FRIDAY

Hope your summer's goin' awesome, and if you're bored, give me a call.

When do we grow out of this? Why is it we long for a companion? Why do we justify? Why can't I get this out of my head? Out of my heart, then? Why do I get so giddy? Why is everything so wrong with this?

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS?
Please excuse me while I tamper down the hope..."

Apparently, for those of you who eat a lot of Chic Fil A, the first one hundred people who are there when a Chic Fil A opens (at 6:00 in the morning) get 52 free combo meal coupons- so oh, did we go. I didn't actually get any coupons, but I had fun camping out in the parking lot all night with friends and my youth pastor and his wife. It was an adventure! Hurray! Crap, I'm tired....

So many reminders...."

I am back in good ole' B-town, it is true. I've been back since Saturday. The trip went well, and I had a few good witness opputunities, also, so thanks to all you who prayed for me; I think they went smoothly.

I'm not really sure what all to write today... I read kinda a sad book today, so I'm left feeling kind of meloncholy. There are two things I would like to highlight, two feelings that I've had since my return to Bradenton.
Number one happened in my kitchen on Sunday night, the night taht Amber and I went over to my cousin's house to dye our hair. As I made macaroni and cheese, Amber and I passed the phone back and forth (the phone having Hannah on the other end) and it just felt... right. Honestly, I just had the deepest feeling of... friendship. Of true friendship, of knowing that these people will be there for me forever, and that I feel the exact way about them. It made me think of Mary, Jesus' mother, and how the Bible (Luke 2:19) says that Mary ""treasured up all of these things and pondered them in her heart."" You know as a kid when something great would happen, and you'd sit there and try to memorize all the details so taht you would never lose the memory? That's a little bit of how I felt.
Number two happened in my living room. Amber and I were bored, so she wanted to watch my family's home videos, so we did. We watched like six of them. Most of you don't know my mom, but, though she's also a bit nurturing and loving, she's very organized and efficient; God literally made her to be in charge. At times though that can be hard, because my mom is not very emotional. But I sat there and watched all these videos,a nd it just struck me how much my parents love me. In those videos, my mom is IN LOVE with me. She was crazy about me! And my dad filmed everything.... If you're ever feeling lonely or unloved, go bust out your family's home movies.

So basically sicne I got home, I have felt very loved and accepted. I am up for doign stuff soon, give me a call if anyone makes any plans!
Go leave a comment on Hannah Leigh's lj!"

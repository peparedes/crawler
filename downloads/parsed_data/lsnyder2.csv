"event","So, I have an exam at 8:00 a.m tomorrow morning and I am sitting here typing because I am so insanely bored with vertebrate fauna. Did you know that there are four native families of the order anura and they have very different respective distributions based on resources allocations and water distribution. I now know more than I ever wanted to about the variations in the echolocative calls of bats and the difference between placental and marsupial lactation. I should be shot and killed for all the useless information I have jammed into my head in the last 48 hours. Well, it will all be over in approximately 10 hours, so that makes me feel a little better. 

Anyway, my family arrives two hours after I finish my exam so I have that time to shower, hopefully nap, and pack for a 12 day vacation. My Dad ( Mr. Prepared for any contingencies mountain man) is going to be so pissed if I'm not ready by the time they show up so no relaxation for the mentally crippled exam taker. Oh well, such is life. I suppose if I can drive from LA to Sacramento after an all-nighter, I can handle this. 

So tomorrow we spend around Townsville, probably to Billabong Animal Sanctuary so my mom can hold a koala, then to the Strand, and Castle Hill for sunset. Of course she wants to see JCU campus, which is so not worth it, but I suppose I will have to shove it in at some point in the day. Then, we head off to Cairns for four days, then the Whitsunday Islands for four days, then Sydney for another four days. It's a jam packed trip but it'll be a great one.

Well, I should probably get back to studying now so I can memorize the research conducted on dugongs. What joy is mine."

"event","Damn it. 

Men are all the same. All of them. At least, all the one's that choose to know me. 

Alright, let's recap the night. So there's this guy, Mick, and he's apparently liked me for months and I had no idea. So we're talking throughout the night, have a nice time and he starts asking me what I'm doing for the rest of the night. I tell him I have no plans, I'm staying out with all my friends and that's about as much as I've committed to. He starts making suggestions about coming back to his room and I tell him there is no way I'm ""sleeping"" with him. I'm not going to do it. He says he's fine with it, and doesn't want anything I'm not willing to give... 

Hahahaha... haha... ha ... ha... silly, Lindsay... men don't change. So we go back to his room and are kissing and then he starts pushing it... I tell him he's going too far, so he says he's sorry and stops... temporarily. Then I start getting a speech about how I should do what my emotions tell me and I should just enjoy the time I have left... it won't just be a one night stand, cause he's not like Tyler. It would mean something to him, and he could kill himself for not making a move sooner.

Uh huh. Sure.

Anyway, I tell him I'm going to go home but he keeps begging me just to spend the night with him. Eventually, it seems easier just to stay with him than to fight him any longer cause I'm just too drunk and I'm so tired. So I tell him I'm going to sleep. Everything seems alright for a while and I wake up and he's pushing it again... while I'm fucking asleep. So yeah, at that point I'm out the door with all my stuff and without another word thinking, stupid Lindsay, how could you be so stupid. None of them are different. At least not when you have 10 days left in a country. Damn it, I am so mad at myself. I should have known there was a reason I hate men.

So that's my rant for the night, in honor of you Jackass #7. You have officially become one of many to try to take advantage of me in this damn country. You're a number. Was that your goal?

""Seventy Times Seven""

Is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids

Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield.

Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to you."

"event","Look at me
My depth perception must be off again
Cause this hurts deeper than I thought it did
It has not healed with time
It just shot down my spine

You look so beautiful tonight
Reminds me how you laid us down
And gently smiled
Before you destroyed my life

Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces?
Could you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces?

Look at me my depth perception must 
You got much closer than I thought you did
I'm in your reach
You held me in your hand

"event","So... I've officially frightened my entire dorm. We had an intense basketball game against the only other undefeated team tonight (John Flynn: the obnoxious private college) and my true colors have shown. I'm pretty sure my testosterone levels elevate when I'm watching basketball because I can't seem to stop screaming. And the sad thing is, my commentary at the game tonight was merely a fraction as loud and a fraction as crazy as it is when I'm at a Kings game. My friends here thought it was bad... but what they saw was a tame version of me... the bare minimum. Whatever. I attribute our win to my excessive screaming. Similarly, I attribute the Kings' sucky season to the fact that I've been in Australia and haven't been in Sacramento for the season to call plays and scream advice at them. Clearly I am an essential part of the team, what with my superb efforts at distracting the referee through obnoxious insults and my consumption of all the nachos I can manage. Anything to support the Kings... Go Western!(that's my dorm for those of you at home)."

"event","I just got back from an awesome trip to Magnetic Island with my lovely Ciara. I, true to form, am totally sunburned. According to Derek I lit the dining commons up like a Christmas tree. He's just so tactful. 

Anyway, it was a fun weekend. We went hiking and horseback riding across the island, went swimming at all of the bays, and we met a lot of really interesting people. I say interesting because only some were cool, and more were total freaks. We met this German guy who clearly liked Ciara. He kept flirting with her, but as she has a boyfriend she was not interested, so we told him we were going to the bathroom and didn't come back. We weren't rude or anything, we just left him to talk with his friends. The next morning he kept odiously glaring at us from 30 m distances. It got to the point where I started cracking up every time we made eye contact. I don't think he appreciated it very much.

And then there was this tour guide... she must have been a teacher. She starts off the tour by saying ""I don't talk when other people are talking, so if you start to chat while I'm telling you about the island I'll just stop."" So... I'm in first grade again? She told us the most uninteresting facts about the island and kept pointing at random trees and telling us there were koalas in them. I didn't see any. Just sayin'. We heard about the death of the daughter of some rich guy who owned a guest house on the island and the original location of the car ferry. You know it wasn't originally in Nelly Bay? Go figure. Then there was essential info on the Horseshoe Bay car park. ""Back in the early days this car park used to be completely full... you'd have a very difficult time finding a place to park your car."" This she repeated at least four times, and I have to say, there were only, like 50 spots. Sorry lady, not impressed. I'm from LA where your biggest problem is not finding a place to park, but relocating your car after you've parked it. I think my favorite quote though was, ""In the early days, they used to grow pineapples, but now they grow houses... just kidding."" Thanks for the just kidding... we weren't really sure. I'm sure its not funny in writing, but it was terribly funny at the time.

Anyway, I'm back now for another week of ""school."" I have to conduct a seminar on the Cheetah Controversy. Basically, scientists keep arguing about whether or not the greatest risk to the African cheetah population is demographic (e.g. hunting, age distribution, etc.) or the lack of genetic variability. And while they're arguing, the cheetah are going extinct. It's a fantastic system. Well, I guess I should ""work"" on the seminar since I spent all weekend playing in the sun."

"event","I've been having a great time in Australia thus far. It's been an amazing experience and I wouldn't change any of it. I've learned so much about myself, what I want, and what I can handle that I can't possibly regret a thing. I was, however, feeling jilted by a particular Australian (Tyler by name, player by nature) and as I often do, I turned to writing as therapy. Because I don't feel like writing an entire entry right now, I thought I would start off with some classic ""man-hating"" Lindsay, and post the theory I wrote while I was getting over Tyler. It is entitled ""The Five Stages of Dating a Player"" and it's so typically me. Enjoy.

Stage One: The Hunt

He pursues you with a vigor you can't help but succumb too. He makes you feel important, beautiful, wanted. He uses all his charm, all his wit, all his powers of pleasing, every sexual trick he's ever learned and eventually wears you down. Now, when I say eventual, it may be a very short amount of time. It all depends on the strength of your determination to resist him.

Stage Two: The Tables Turn

He no longer chases you like he did at first. Now it's all about getting you to chase him. You wait around for him to come to you and when he doesn't you go after him. If you resist going after him, he'll come round occasionally just to keep you interested, to bait you a bit more, and then he'll be gone again. This tactic always works in the end. The games have truly started in this stage. You want to play it cool but you can't. You find yourself less satisfied all the time, but wanting him even more. You want to get back to that stage where he adored you and treated you like a f*cking princess. So you pursue him, just like he wants.

Stage Three: The Asshole Appears

He becomes what can best be described as a complete dickhead. He is bored with you. He wants to move on to the next thing (i.e. girl) and instead of being a big boy and telling you he's no longer interested he decides to be mean to you or to ignore you, hoping you'll get the hint that he no longer wants you around. There are newer, though not necessarily better things out there, so he no longer wants anything to do with you. You finally get the hint, are fed up with his mistreatment, and decide that's the end of it.

Stage Four: Irrationality

But that's not the end of it. In this stage, you are sort of over him, but the intensity of your hatred and anger is such that you still want him to want you for one reason: your pride. First off, you don't want to feel rejected. And secondly, and more importantly, you want to inflict him with the emotional pain that he has inflicted upon you. You have all sorts of fantasies about him coming back, asking for your forgiveness, and you showing how infinitely superior you are by turning him down, forgiving him, or castrating him: take your pick. However, at this stage you would probably not do any of these things. There is enough residual desire that you would probably consider taking him back. Because you're stupid. Also, it is not possible to inflict that kind of pain on him, because he is a player. He does not care enough to feel pain.

This stage is also self-destructive. You wonder what you did wrong, how you should have played the game, how you could have acted to keep him interested. You wonder if you played it too cool. If he maybe wanted more, but you were so determined to be casual about the whole thing that he just assumed you weren't interested. You think maybe, just maybe, you hurt or scared him. At the worst, you convince yourself that there is something inherently wrong with you and your ability to have relationships. Of course, this is madness, because he is a player, and the point of playing is not to get into a relationship with one person. It was never his goal and you had no control over that. You never stood a chance.

Stage Five: Acceptance

You realize that he was only doing what was natural to him. You can't get mad at a creature for doing the things habit and instinct tell them to do. It's biology. Birds fly and players play. You can't condemn him any more than you can condemn a bird. I suppose you could argue that we are people, we have consciences, we are supposed to be civilized and we should know better than to treat others like that. But like I said, where biology is concerned, instinct will almost always win. At this point, you get over your anger and truly get over him.

This is not the end of it, however. He will pick up on the fact that you have moved on, and since he is a true player he cannot accept this. He will try to get your attention again, occupying the same areas you do, talking to you at clubs, reminding you of how charming, attentive, and intelligent he can be when it suits his purposes. At this point, one of two things will happen: you will acknowledge him for what he is and the merits he has, but you will not allow him to reel you in again. You become friends. Or, you will be maddeningly stupid, fall for his tricks again (much to the dismay of yourself and your friends) and revert back to stage one to begin the process anew.

Cynical, embittered, and aggressively accusatory... everything I love about myself."

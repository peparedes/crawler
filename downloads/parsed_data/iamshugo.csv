 We all cringe and pretend to puke when we see something like a man's hairy butt or see a face that has been burned away a bit. It's obvious that we see it as something amazingly gross.
But I've been thinking... why?
Why do we shun things without even CONSIDERING the mere possibility that the hairy butt or burned face is as much the same to everything as our own stupid little face & butt?

"event","<strong>SCIENCE VS GOD</strong><br />To be honest, I wanted to be a scientist SO much when I was younger. But now, I realize science is just pure bull. Scientists 'find answers', even if it means playing God (Cloning, etc.). <br />The Lord does not like it too much, knowing his own image is betraying him. <br />For example, we now HAVE to genetically buff up turkeys to have those nice Thanksgiving ones due to too much ""scientific experimentation."" Meaning, hatching a regular turkey will only give us a crappy skinny thing. <br /><br />Forgive me if I'm drawing conclusions here, but it seems to me as if God&nbsp;was prepared for this. I mean, we screwed with his creation. Now his creation is gonna kill us.<br /><br /><u>""...is gonna kill us.</u>"" <strong>--&gt;</strong>&nbsp; Scientists are screwing around with EVERYTHING these days. They're cloning more plants than they actually grow in crops anymore... Many see this as a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; We might be getting more food, but&nbsp; this&nbsp;is really just&nbsp;a worldwide suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Crichton showed that cloning is <em>not</em> a good thing in his book ""Jurassic Park!""<br /><u>""...cloning is <em>not</em> a good thing in his book ""Jurassic Park!</u>&nbsp;""<strong>--&gt;&nbsp;</strong> The cages were good. The dinosaurs were all female. Everything was fine.&nbsp; But to their surprise, they fucked up somewhere along the road of creating dinosaurs. They used DNA from frogs...the ones that can change their own sex.&nbsp; Thus, some dinosaurs turned into males, screwed some Lady Dino's, and made eggs. Now they have control of...what... 2 islands, is it? ""they'll find a way""<br /><u>""they'll find a way</u>""<strong>--&gt;</strong> DNA is not to be fucked around with.&nbsp;<br /><br />In my opinion, God 'programmed' his creations as to where if they are used in someone's proccess to play God, they self-destruct in a way. Not bomb- or explosion-wise, but in a long-term situation.&nbsp; God will not control free will, but he will warn. Going back to the turkey, this is an example of a sign. If we choose to ignore signs, it will be but only our own faults. We chose to be ignorant and selfish. We will serve our punishment.<br /><br />I, myself, don't know what the punishment will be...but it obviously won't be a good one.<br /><br /><strong>For You ""I disagree sooooooo much!!!"" Commenters, atleast make it constructive and support it with somethin'. I'm open to all opinions.</strong>"

"event","Well, 'Date Movie' was fun(ny). Some of it was overdone, but some like their steak like that.

Woke up this morning to my cellphone at 8:00. Once I got done talking to the dude on the ther end, I went into the bathroom and <scratched out>, but when I was washing my hands, my glorious sister woke up and yelled at her daughters/my nieces to ""Put down the god damn candy."" -.-
So I went into my room and blasted some .hack// music. Yeah... music is my only way I can 'protest'.

So then I went to the computer at about 8:30 and signed into HHQ. Apparantly it was Hamstar, RF, AND erti who were the posers...heh. Me and Bal (we didn't decide this together, we just both happened to) are guessing that this was a way to copy our ""Phase"" demo at HHQ last summer...long story.

And I signed on to YIM today, to find that Victor doesn't want to sit by us anymore. It's understandable. Everyone in our 'group' treats him like an asshole just because he likes the military...a lot. I still don't forgive Ian for his ""I'm better then Victor, let's shove it in his face"" shit...

Damn...I'm beginning to cry."

Oh yeah. I cleaned my room and now it's all shiny and crap. Just need ta organize my bookshelf and get my posters up.

There's a candle in front of me.


Breagh wasn't at school today.
Aaron's being all short and annoying.
The A-girl's been all bored n crap, even though she spoke to her A-man. However, her sister IS suicidal...so I'm backing off.
Victor's trying to start his DC shit again...oh joy.
Ian won't leave Victor alone and was an ass last lunch. Go figure.

And RF or Hamz or whoever (likely RF) are posing as a hacker at HHQ and annoying people. Heh. Atleast it gives us something to do.

whatever, though. Penguins will be penguins.

BTW, I'm leaving in just a lil' bit to watch 'Date Movie' with some buds...ya..."

"event","I had a dream last night that I was running around a school<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> (note that I've never been to this school in real life, but I have been in other dreams of mine)</span> with some psycho alien teacher who I knew was trying to kill me, but she didn't know I knew (x.x). And I was in a robe o.o<br>
Anywho, she tried pushing me down and elevator shaft, she tried
stabbing me with pencils, she even tried locking me in a gymnasium to
make me starve to death. But I kept the door from shutting each time.
o.o<br>
When I finally lost her after running through random school hallways, I
went outside and sat on a bench in an outside bar. After I sat down,
this one history major dude <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">(he was about my age, wearing dark brown clothes)</span>
came over with the shotgun the weird teacher lady was holding. He said
something like ""This isn't very 'earthly'."" Then he shot up at a piece
of wood and it caught on fire. Then he shot again and the fire froze <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">(got shot so much it actually froze o.o; )</span>.<br>
Then I said ""Lemme see that."" He handed the gun over to me and I went
over to a glass wall and shot at it with the ice. It froze, then
shattered. Then I tried it on the tip of my finger and my skin didn't
freeze. I tried it again on my arm, and nothing happened. Then one of
the guys I was sitting with came over and tried it on the right side of
his face, and it became frozen...then his face shattered...that's when
I woke up...<br>
Also, near the beginning I was naked in class. That's why I was wearing the robe.

And even earlier than that, I was helping a family find a good house to move into. And this house was located in one of the 5 or 6 random neighborhoods that I made up in one of my dreams. This one was the same neighborhood I had my 'omg, I'm being chased by Vampires and Ogres in someones freaking attic!' dream series (it actually lasted about 3 or 4 nights)."

"event","Thursday was my first day of Highschool (yippee to being a freshman &lt;.&lt;;). <br>
I got lost...a lot. I think I even went to lunch twice. U^_^ I made it
to all my classes (not on time, though) except for PE. o.o; Whoops.<br>
o.o And I got homework! Yay! What kind did I get, ye ask? <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>
Well let's see:</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>2 Paragraphs on why or why not learning history is important.</li>
  <li>850 words on who my role model is.</li>
</ul>
The first was easy.<br>
However, I didn't know who the hell my role model is, if I even have
one for that matter (I'm weird, k? XP). In other words, that one didn't
go so well. o.o;<br>
<br>
Let's see...how about we check out what happened Friday?<br>
<ul>
  <li>I was late to school by 20 minutes. o.o;</li>
  <li>I made it to (almost) all my classes on time! Yay!</li>
  <li>I got another thing of homework. x_X&nbsp; 800 words on some
story we read in class (I think...I'll have to check that again o.o;).
But this time I get to take da beetle down with me! Bwahaha! &gt;:D<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
So, yay for school.... o.o;<br>"

"event","I had a dream last night that the house across the street blew up and FBI people came down to investigate. Then two neighbors for some reason came over to meh house for a BBQ, then (in my dream) I fell asleep, had a small dream about some girl sucking my toe (O.o), then woke up to find a tube in my bellybutton and my right nipple. I looked around and found the two neighbors...feeding on someone. Then me and meh mom somehow killed them o.o; The FBI people came over and thanked us, then went back to the house across the street.

The End?"

"event","Currently watching <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Jurassic Park III</span>. It's not nearly as good as the original <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Jurassic Park</span>, but, in my opinion, it's way better than <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</span>.<br>
<br>
I woke up to my sister complaining about how her kids never listen or
any of that crap...took her long enough to figure that out. <span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">&lt;.&lt;;</span> She's so freakin' whiney and loud <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">&gt;.&lt;</span> 24 years old....you'd think she'd decide to grow up...or atleast move out <span style=""color: rgb(0, 204, 204);"">-.-+</span><br>

Meh. That's all for this morning. So weeee.<br>

Oh, right: I've only had LJ since Feb of this year, not almost a year. I'm just slow like that U^_^"

"event","Looks like I've had an empty livejournal for almost a year...strange. 

Anywho, today's been really, how do I say, boring. As have been the past couple of weeks. 
Hamstar Headquarters (HHQ) has been unbelievably dead...I'm thinking that it may have something to do with all the changes. Like lately, people <including most admins> have been trying to get more members, more categories, and other crap.

Also a lot of rules have been added, including one that I find one quite important to the world of online-ness: No Roleplaying. I know I agreed to it, but I think that I made the wrong decision, to an extent. I agree that the stuff that could be an actual roleplay should go in the RPing section, but stuff like having a different personality of yours stealing cookies and running into a corner laughing maniacly (long story) shouldn't be a part of that rule. In fact, I'm not even sure if it is. U^_^ But just saying.

Then there's Balmung-San...I love him like a brother, but gah... @.@ Whenever I try leaving either to either watch tv, play a game, read, draw, or practically do anything else he 'commands' for me to stay or 'be back in an hour or two'...I'm really close to shoving a pine tree up his ass and using him as the angel on the christmas tree. Balmung, please, just let me live on my own. I already have a dad, I don't need another...especially one younger than me. This may seem cruel, but that's how I work.

So...what else should I say...? Hmm...right.

There's something that happens when I'm bored for a long time. Either I get really psychotic, or I just have no real expression...like I don't smile, I don't cry, I don't get a pissed face...I'm just emotionless. Weird, eh? Perhaps, perhaps not.

Well, that's all for now...cuz I'm too bored to go on.

"event","i almost forgot to mention my dream last night. it was set in this cold, snow filled town... current yet with a little old western theme. there were all these mob families, but everyone was a zombie, and yeah so my job was to take these dudes out except no one had guns, only medival weapons. i dont know why, but thats what was up. most of the dream was spent with me running from these guys through sewer like hallways filled with decaying corpses. i couldnt run very fast and one of them caught up to me, so i pull out this knife and cut of its thumb. it turned back around and i got away. now mind you i have had this dream before, probably one of the most terrifying dreams i have ever had. so i found my self running up this staircase, and i knew from the last time i had this dream there would be a guy who would pop out at the top and i had to choke him to death. so out pops the guy and i then place my blood stained hands on his throat and begin to choke him. but he just wasnt dying, and i am getting a little nervous cause in my previous dream i had the guy dead in no time. its a little blury but i think i finally killed him. so i run out through the door at the top of the staircase where i am confronted with about 10 zombies. so i had this huge sword and ripped right through all of them. now i am on the street, its dark but not too bad cause of the snow and the street lights. i am running and i come up on one of the families main house. and theres this godfather zombie looking guy that runs his finger over his throat at me. next thing i know a few of his goons are on me and take me in. i am kinda scared now. they take me over to this chopping block and i am thinking its all over now, so i am trying to wake up but i cant. and he goes ""hit for hit"" and guess who comes out with no thumb? sean from yellowcard. no joke. and i was like ""sean, i didnt know it was you! im so sorry"" and he was nice and said ""i know man, but we gotta do this."" so i said ""are we still cool?"" he then gave me a hug and swung his butchers knife at my hand. it hurt, and i fell to the ground drenched in blood. and he was crying and told me to run before the rest of the guys came. so i booked it, and as soon as i jumped the 20 ft wall, i woke up.

"event","the snow came down, and down for a long time.

played halo with lanna and claire for awhile las night, then we watched bruce almighty; wonderful picture. went to bed, then i was so considerately called at 4 am by an unknown source to me and i will now relay the conversation... *phone rings* i wake, startled of course, and hazily drunk with sleep i answer ""hello?"" the voice on the other end sounds like someone i should know, but i dont (i did not recognize the number, but it was local considering the 253 area code). ""dude, look out your window right now, its snowing..."" at this point i am asking myself ""who is this?"" and apparently my thoughts traveld to my mouth and didnt stop because i was replied by something i couldnt exactly understand, i think it was along the lines of ""it doesnt matter..."". now by this point in the event my being torn from my sleep sets in and unified in anger... so rudely i said ""yah, okay"" and then i hung up the phone. so if you are the mystery caller, reveal yourself and experience my wrath.


max payne, the original is almost complete. i hope to pick myself up a copy of gladius today, so well see. 


<blockquote>""<i>16. Does God's eternal sovereignty imply an enternal creation for its exercise?

I would certainly not dare to deny that God is eternally sovereign Lord; yet at the same time I must not doubt that man was first created at a certain time, before which he did not exist. But when I ponder the question what was the eternal subject of God's eternal sovereignty, if creation did not always exist, I am afraid to give any positive answer,  because I examine myself and remember what the scripture says, 'What human being can know the design of God? Who will be able to think what God intends? For the thoughts of mortals are timorous, and our speculations uncertain. For the corruptable body weighs down the soul, and the earthly habitation depresses the mind as it ponders many thoughts.'""</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>""<i>5. For Christians, the passions offer a training in virtue, not an inducement to sin.

It is not at this point necessary to expound in copious detail what is taught about these passions in the divine Scriptures, which contain the syllabus of instruction for Christians. Scripture subjects the mind to God for his direction and assistance, and subjects the passions to the mind for their restraint and control so that they may be turned into the instruments of justice. In fact, in our discipline, the question is not <i>whether<i> it is sad, but what causes its sadness; not whether it is afraid, but what is the object of its fear.<i>""</i></i></i></i></blockquote>

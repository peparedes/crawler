"event","Last night, I had this..dream. here's how it goes.


Me, Bella and Eri were given this map, and we had to look for two places of opposite ends (east and west). The first place we went to was this old abandoned Haunted House, with two ghosts: a guy and a girl, who'd kill both good and evil. So we tried to get rid of it. Thing is, we got rid of the house too, using thing big giant whilwind.


The second place was a swamp, with a bridge over it. Below the bridge was a pool of anacondas (and you could tell they were anacondas) with lotsa eggs. bella and me fell in that gunk of sloppy snake and frog swapy mess. (she stepped on a stillborn) and then at the end of the bridge was this giant pitviper and two turtles covered in wormy moss.


Cool, eh?"

Yes, me! I know I haven't been updating for a loooooong time. Internet's faulty, so I'm using the school PC.

Me and my folk's watched Shark Tale. Ever since Home on The Range, Disney's closing all cartoon animation productions and all their future works would be three dimensional. At least, that's what they told me.

Dad got new DVD's, and I watched iRobot. Iz cool! There's this group of robots called the NS-5. Fast, but sensitive. I love the part where Sunny fights the other robots.


Oooh, and I realized that I missed this old animation called The Nightmare Before Christmas. Spooky and fun.

<P><FONT color=#6600cc size=2><STRONG>We played with this frosted chess set. It went fine at first, but the intellectual challenge brought us to insanity. We ended up with a draw.

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6600cc size=2>She was also struggling with my mouse. It wouldn't move, or it would skip a step. She told me to get an optical one. Wonder how much those things cost?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6600cc size=2>Then Eri had this funny cold. You know that feeling when you couldn't say anything properly because your nose is all clogged up?

<P><STRONG><FONT size=2>And Arwen will go ""Dammit, dad, I'm a thousand years old! I can handle this kind of thing!""</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT size=2>And Legolas goes all spooky-like. ""This mountain has spooky ghosts and we're all gonna die!!!!!""</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=2>That reminds me of the time, in LOTR2, where Aragorn and Legolas were bickering in Elvish.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=2>Aragorn was giving encouragement, like, ""We can win this! YAY!""</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT size=2>And he prods Aragon on the chest with every ""HUH?!?!?!?!?""</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=2>Soon they meet up after silence. Aragorn goes beside Legolas and goes. ""Hey""</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Anyway, then I had two separate dreams after the movie. The first one was an HP dream. I was in Hogwarts, in a classroom, crying (why I was crying, I have NO idea). Then I hear these voices coming. They tried to open the classroom, but the door was barricaded with things. The crowd outside was a group of Gryffindors and Slytherins. I knew coz of the patches on their robes. They were shouting that they needed this particular classroom. But I didn't let them in.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Then Draco Malfoy comes out of the crowd and starts banging his fists on the door and the windows.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>""Get out, mudblood! Get out!"" He said.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Draco crashed through the window and grabs my leg. He drags me outside the room, opens the door and lets everyone inside. After that, he picked a fight with me.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I left him, saying ""Go away, child. Go away""</STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>The second dream was in this weird modern house. There were nightcrawlers everywhere, and I couldn't seep well coz they were in my bed. Then, like in SIMS, I poked them and there these trangle things above their heads, and they started goingwhere I wanted them to go. Weird.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Ooh, I forgot to mention. I had a teensy HP dream. It was like a flash of it. Molly Weasley had a Black Mamba, and she was having trouble transfering it to an aquarium.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>No outreach, I got transferred. Dana got a duckling, I made a comic, talumpati, no shoes, spontanious speech, dorky outfit, finished, came home, watched the matrix, deja vu, black cat, Amazing Race 5, Manila Philippines, Grandma, soup for dinner, multiplication table, and my brother.</STRONG></P>

"event","<P><STRONG>We had our recollection today, and there were....</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>...</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>some horrible things. See, here's how it goes:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>On a paper, draw a boat on water and a shark that's <EM><U>REALLY </U></EM>hungry, fat and would eat ANYTHING. So, you're family's in the boat, and you're the captain. Then, the boat starts to sink, and you need to throw someone out (who, may I add, will 200% be eaten and be torn to shreds by the stupid shark) And the others will be perfectly safe. The THING that irked me was that you couldn't throw yourself out.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>THAT was stupid!!! I was the captain, wasn't I?!?!?!? I decide what happens to the passengers! If I say they live, they live! I'm already sacrificing shark-induced pain and they EXCLUDE me from it?!?!?!?&nbsp;How does limiting my options benefit in the situation, IF <EM><U>I</U></EM> AM THE CAPTAIN AND<EM><U>&nbsp; I SAY WHAT HAPPENS TO MY FAMILY!?!?! </U></EM>How are THEY gonna stop me from jumping off the ship, huh?! HUH?!?!?! <EM><U>HUH?!?!?!?!?!?</U></EM> </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>...</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>...</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>I feel much better now</STRONG></P>"

"event","<P>ooh, i found out this morning that i have a fever, my head hurts and my throat is burning like hell. the wild thornberries the movie cheered me up. Yeah, it was alright. kinda short (i think) but yeah, it will do....</P>
<P>The fever's very moderate,&nbsp;and mu,m told me to bathe to see if it would go away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Guess what?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It grew worse. She said to call her if it did. i haven't called her, but i will soon. I just need to clean my room first coz it smells like burning wood and incence ashes. Trust me, it smells like death. (Not the stinky kind of smell. It's that black-mood-someone's-gonna-die smell)</P>

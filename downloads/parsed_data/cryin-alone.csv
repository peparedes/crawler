I cant make him trust me, i cant tell him that hes wrong and im right because supposible thats all i ever say... Its one thing when i do things that could make him not trust me its another when i havnt done shit and hes just making it seem like everything he says is right... I hate all of my other relationships they were horrible but one thing i do wish i still had was a live.. I wish chris could just trust me and let me have friends with out being an ass about it like my ex's did....  If that makes sence...

Ian basically told me today that hes still in love with me and that emily was a way to try to get over me. "" but it didnt work "" as he said.

Love is suppose to feel good. its suppose to be specail but for some reason all i can do is cry. I feel like you turn your back on me like you give up to quikly. I'm trying like i said i would im making a point to do things the way you would. I dont get it. You say you love me but act like you dont want to be around me so we fight then you tell me im the problem im the bitch im the one who is making everything so hard. Im sorry for everything i did in the past i thought it would stay there but i was wrong it follows me every were and makes me see why im who i am. Im trying so hard to say that i can erase it all and that everything gets better and i dont have to worry about it when i look in the mirror see me there and you some were else. It brakes my heart to sit here and not do anything it makes me feel usless when i cant help you, when i dont know what you have been through when i cant make it all go away. I cant wait to go with you far away from here. Maybe we can leave tomorrow? do you think that will make everything better? Im not use to having someone not trust me only not trusting. This is all different. We have the same past maybe a little different but the feelings i have inside are the ones im hearing the ones that are telling me to go to you be with you and that we can fix everything and anything we are going to go through. I believe in us i know you do to. Im trying baby to fix it all to make it all go away so we can be together with out fighting. It kills me when i lie next to you and ? weather or not you love me the way i love you. Im sorry."

I DONT CARE WHO TALKS TO IAN I REALLY COULD FUCKING CARE LESS WHAT I DO FUCKING CARE ABOUT IS HIM TELLING EVERYONE WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHAT I TELL HIM CUZ IF I WANTED THEM TO KNOW I WOULD TELL THEM MYSELFS. And i wasnt talking about alicia with the cutting thing and no CHRIS ISNT MY FUCKING WORLD. OMG i havnt talked to you all in so fucking long how would you even know who is my life or not? and its not agenst the law for me to see him cuz were not sleeping together and since your all sick of my ""bullshit "" youll be happy to know im not ganna be here much longer.. OK im done im not explaining myself to you anymore im sick of people acting like they know whats going on adn then when you ask they have no fucking clue.

 But anyways for people who do care. This weekend kinda sucked, i packed my shit and i found so much stuff like notes from sam and shit like that i couldnt help but laugh cuz its been so long. I also had to figure out how to get it from my house to the apartment with out making a mess cuz im not doign a good job at orginizing my stuff. My mom is letting me go?  if that makes sence she said that as long as i get a job i can leave and shell leave me alone.. kinda good i guess. Im ganna get a cell phone so then i can talk to people cuz ive been grounded for fucking ever.. if you want the number tell me and ill give it to you when we go and get it. Ok and so chris told me he loved me and i said "" umm what?"" and then i was like "" why?"" lol it was a bad thing to say but the feeling in my stomach was unexplainable. Im happy now cuz i really like someone and no i dont care about what people have to say cuz its not up to you and you cant change feelings. I really didnt know what to say but i finally told him i loved him back and then cryed cuz i didnt know if i was telling him the truth or lying to him... I really dont think that i was lying because if i dont talk to him i get so upset and its like when im with him the feeling just keeps growing. Hes never really felt this way about anyone in a long time and hes older so he probably should have right? well Im in love... its wierd but i like it. I feel bad for ian cuz he wont move on... I have told him to and i have been mean to him so that he would and it just didnt work. I wish i could be like be over it and poff it worked... I dont know anymore .. im just trying to figure everything out and all i have really done is gotten myself to move out and lose alot of friends."

I have made the tears go away.. remarkable almost now that i know were they come from and why there caused i can say that im ganna make them all stop. How can you think that your better then everyone else in the world when all you do is cry like a fucking baby and cut your wrist cuz your supposive life sucks. Well thats the ever day life of some people here . and then others like more drama then friends and shit like that. Its all fucked up. So i learned that people just pretend to be your friend for a little while then one day there not. Ok so yeah today everyone is talking alot of shit and being really fucking stupid but then when i leave or something the only thing thats ganna happen is there all ganna wonder were i went. oh no i forgot they wont cuz there not real friends. I dont think that me being with someone self is the problem i dont think that me not wanting to be with ian is a problem i think the problem is they all need something to focuse on besides them selfs."

The appoige that i owed you and the things i never told you. Looking up at the sky wondering if she will ever be able to tell you she loves you to. Looking at all of the people who are still to this day wipping away tears. Fighting back all the bad feelings wanting to make everything go away. I was thinking about you Nick and I have something to say. I will forever remember you and you will forever be apart of me. I dont know how to say good-bye because it still makes no sence to me about how someone you could see one day can be gone the next. Now as i sit back and think about it everyday over and over wondering how everyone really close to you must feel. When i think about what they would want to say to you i come up with something so simple and stupid like "" sometimes things arent fair no one ever said they would be, but when you lose someone close to you someone you could barrly know it hurts you look back at all the things they have done for you and for them selfs. Nick i cant help but to think that your ok with everything that has just happen i onistly think your up there smiling and laughing with us everyday. I think you made it so that everytime we try to cry we cant. You make it so that when we want to cry we laught when we try to be mad were happy when we want you to come back you make us want you there. Thinking about what my mother had said to me and im sure your said it to you to.. "" hes happy now hes not in pain""? I hated to hear people say that i mean how do they know? what makes them think that everything is ok with you when i cant even look at you now. Im sorry? well should i be sorry should i feel bad or do you want me to be happy do you want me to smile instead of crying? do you want me to pray for you instead of yelling at god cuz of you. The anger that was there has growen and the pain of the voice inside no one heard for so long. Now that im crying out telling people i need help they look at me as if im not a person and im a stranger who just walked up to them and was like "" hi my name is aprel and im an  addict not only that but i dont want to be on this fucking planet because everyone i care about is gone. "" its almost liek i can say it all i want and i can think it all i want but theres nothing i can do about it. I want to be able to see your beautiful blue eyes and tell you myself that things happen words are said feelings are tost and emotions are lost. Time and time again i just want to make it all end but for some reason i cant and i think knowing your there and im here is the reason i want it to end so bad. I think you looking down on us know something is going to happen and you stop you [ you make me san ] thinking about it again {{ I just want it all to end }}"

I love you when i dont know you i hated you when i did. I wanted you to hold me and tell me everything would be ok. I want you to show me that i can get over him and i want you to make me see. Im sick of the bad feelings im tierd of always yelling. You told me that you loved me but for some reason you couldnt be with me. You told me you knew and that you could always see that for some reason you wanted to let me be. You said you knew i loved him and you seemed to make it so sure you think i cant get over him and then you close the door, you tell me every time i talk to you that something just isnt right. You hold me in your arms and sing me a lala bye. You love him april you forever will so i cant come into your life right now untill you can get out of his. I want you so much that much is true. I want you to be here so I can show you who I am. Theres a difference between me and him theres so much that he couldnt see you are so different and so loved by more then me. You seem to misunderstand you think that you could move on. You act like he doesnt love you and he never will. When deep down inside you know he will always be there, you know that everytime you turn away from him and everytime he walks away. That funnie feeling in your stomack gets so much stronger, he lied to you he broke his promice he made it so that all of his words are nothing but lies. Sorry I cant help you sorry i cant make this better im sorry im so much in love with you because I can never be with you. The day that i can hold you when your sleeping the day you can be all mine is the day you admit that he is all yours. For some reason you rob have thought all of that and told me over and over again. You make me feel wrong and make me cry so much. You make it seem as if i want to be hurt. Im sorry rob that i love him im sorry this is so hard. But im not going to try anymore I cant make him mine. All i can do now is look at the past. Now im making a future and he will never hold me. im not going to wast my time trying to make you love me. Im not going to look into your eyes. I love him that much is true but i cant keep being hurt by him.

 pS. All the love I hold for him seems to disappere with the hate. All the time that i have wasted trying to get with him when in the end it was a wast. Im sorry for trying so hard, no one should have to this isnt the way its suppose to work. You should love me because im me and you should want to be with me because im me. Not lie and cheat. Just hold and love.   Im sorry Rob this is killing you im sorry i cant stop the feeling im sorry for making you so mad. Please just come back. Dont leave me because of him.

Take the time today to say hello and then turn away
say good bye till it makes you cry
wish that everything will be ok
turned you back on me once then i did it again
made you see me for me and hate me for you
sorry that i hurt you 
sorry for not knowing you name
sorry for taking everything away
Im looking now in-to the past 
thinking of away
trying so hard as i slowly run away.
time has passed and time has come
people keep trying thinking there number 1
You couldnt say good-bye you didnt know you would die
thinking that everything was fine. 
getting in the car. never to look back
as you and your friends were having a good time
look at the angel 
the one whos taking you away
ask her a question
now ask her why
look in to the heavens and pled 
ask for another chance
making you wonder what you did 
making you laugh
thinking this is a dream 
one you will awake from
you will see everything okay
you will be waking up in bed. 
when you know your eyes arent yet closed
you try and try
theres always away to say it.
always time to think it 
but no one ever knows it.
say I love you and say Good-bye 
let everyone know that you will always shed a tear
this is all a dream one were you will never wake up
so i guess its just time to say good-bye to that stranger
the one i wish now i talked to and the one i wish i knew.

  Good bye Nick. We all love you and will always be there for you. closing my eyes wishing for another day wishing this would all go away

"event","Hey everyone,
   
   Some times things arent the way that are seen. Someone who you may love right now you may hate tomorrow. The people that seem so close to you and seem like they love you may not. I think that this is all recondeming. I dont think its right that people judge you but if you think about it thats all they can do is judge. Cuz when you let your gard down you may be letting your self be hurt in more then one way. You could be loving someone who doesnt love you you could trust someone who later is ganna rob you. You could be me and question everything just because no one told you or tought you what they were suppose to, you could find your self looking down the path that you have for so long wanted to get away from. When your a child you say that when you grow up you wont do drugs and that you will always do good in school and respect people... well remember that because everything that you said then is all the things you cant do now. When its to late youll be looking back going oh ok so i get it now. Well how does now help you? what does that make better? How can you say you will "" change "" What does that exactly mean? what does that do to everyone in the end. Everytime someone says they can do it they lied they dont know what ""changing "" is. I use to think that as longs as i had family and friends everything would be fine. I was wrong. Drugs, friends, sex, etc. all come in and take over all of the things that you use to want and need are the things that seem so far away from you.

   take it day by day"

I looked at it from someone elses point of view and I now get that I need to take my live and start living it. Drug free No more. Everything that I have lost because of them . I mean Ian left me and I hurt him so much I killed my mom. She was so happy with me she thought i was finally ganna be right and have the chance to change it. The drugs have taken a toil of my life. It has made it so that I only cared about that and my drug buddies. I have been thinking in the last few days about how much I have lost and gain. I have gain alot this past year, but then lost it all in one min because I wanted to trip? how is that worth it? I love someone with all of my heart and that person left me when I  was in the hospital because he was so mad that I did the pills. People keep asking me why I did it and how come I couldnt tell people i needed help when the truth is i dont know why i felt so unloved and like no one cared for me anymore. I dont know why that trip seemed so good to me. Well mabe it was the not being able to feel anything for a while. When those pills kicked in my body went numb and sitting here talking about it makes me see why there not worth it and why it was so easy for me to go back to them with a smile for so long. When in the end just like any other time I felt worse then in the beging. So many times i have replaced pain with drugs. and every time it was worse cuz i had to deal with everything all at the same time and it would all hit me at once. All i have to say is that in 5 min im ganna go tell the love of my live I want him back and that I love him and then from there I will live it like i was meant to. Straight. No drugs. And then Im ganna make all of this time that I have to think about what life means to me.

It's unbelievable, how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know
If you just don't know how I feel
Then let me show you that now I'm for real
If all the things in time, time will reveal
Yeah

1 - one, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one

(yeah)
It's so incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, hey
And undesirable, for us to be apart
I never would've made it very far
cause you know you got the keys to my heart
cause...

Repeat 1

Say farewell to the dark of night
I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child, whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line
Just in the nick of time

Repeat 1 to fade

 looking back on the smile 
 making sure I can forever stay the forgotten
 leaving the past to enter the future
 unclear of why. You are the one thing I cant see
 you arent in the future It seems you were never in the past
 looking forward to yesturday.
 I know its time to go
 but you cant seem to let it go
 when everything is hunting you in your dreams
 when you try to make the pain end in another way
 causing more to yourself
 not knowing how much your hurting other people
 when In your nightmares the look in there eyes scares you
 Making you scream to the point you cant breath. Seeing the blood
 taking more pills cuz the one you just took arnt working
 This time you plained it you made it seem so simple and sweet
 Knowing someone will find out when you tell me theres no problem.
 You are my bestfriend and It hurts you to see me here
 Hurts me to see you there so invisible to yourself and so empty to the world
 they will never know the girl inside til they give you a chance
 not knowing whats gana happen when I leave you in that corner
 thinking the best but expecting the worse. Sorry isnt ok anymore
 neather are you. You like to put that big smile on and those beautiful brown eyes
 but I can see behind them and I know whats going on I know he broke your heart
 I know you want to fix it and I know about every cut you have made
 the pain is like glass slowly cutting in you moving down your body so slow
 every move is a stinging pain you cant move or get ride of.
 the time that I look and see the girl all I see is that little princess
 who use to sit on the swings with a smile so real everyone wanted to be her
 but you hated her. You hate her so much that the pain is almost enjoyable
 you like all the pain and all the tears you think she should be dead
 everytime shes tryed shes failed and that makes you hate her even more.
 Sorry you say meaning it in a way. Not sorry for hurting god but sorry for not killing yourself this time like you promiced you would last.
 you said there is no problem you told me you were ok desided to start over
 you want to hate him but want nothing more but for him to love you
 wanted for so long that now that you know its almost over and that hes almost invisible to you hurts you so much that the pain to die is so much stronger
 You wanted to end it for so long making me so scared that this might be the time
 the one that you have been waiting for and the one that we have been fearing
 you are the baby, you make us all so happy and make us all so sad
 seeing you kill yourself over him kills me on the inside out
 Hes not worth it he doesnt know how to love he never will and you do
 you need to be loved back and you need to love
 the lonelyness that has been kept inside of you has caused so much to the girl i use to call my bestfriend. Now I call you a stranger. I dont know you anymore. Mabe because im so afraid of the end.
 what was once a beautiful little girl with big brown eyes Is a growen women with alot of hate and anger.

 pSs. April. I love you I really do but It kills me to see you try to end it. Mabe cuz im scared to see you actually make it cuz mabe I wasnt there or louise mabe your mom. Im so afraid that because of what he did to you your gana kill yourself just to hurt him. Last night was fucked Tonight was worse making everything seem so clear to me making myself sick. Trying to think that im lieing to myself trying to make that saying love kills change so that I can make you stay. I cant help until your willing and you are lieing to yourself and everyone around you. I hold you up I will for as long as i can but please understand. Dont kill yourself because of Ian. Live because of him and make him jealouse and want you back. Make him cry when he sees you. Make everything you use to want to live for be your reason for being here.

I DONT WANT TO LOVE YOU ANYMORE AND I CANT FUCKING DO THAT UNLESS IM NOT YOUR FRIEND. Not forever just for now so that I can get use to not being with you and you being with someone else. Until I can admit that I dont love you and mean it. Until im not crying everynight because I dont know what to do anymore when it comes to you. Im sick of the fucking smile on your face when it should be a fucking frown. Im sick of all the fucking bullshit. I ask you to stay away from me but you cant do that I tell you im not going to talk to you but you wont stop talking to me. Why is it so fucking hard for you not to talk to me. Why is it that you think I love you and that I will forever and that I do. I DONT WANT TO AND THATS THE FUCKING POINT. Im sick of trying for so much and getting nothing in return, you were suppose to give me a chance to show you that I could be what you wanted me to be but after a few days you leave and go to someone else. Well I can be everything you are and im going to be. I will not love you and im promicing myself that. I dont think that loving you is good and to be onist I dont think I will ever be close to you again. You have all the chances to take me back and everyone keeps saying that you will fall in love with me. Well im done waiting. You dont and never will so  here this is your christmas/birthday present from me. I will stop loving you and you can move on happyle and stress free. Ill leave you alone so can you just leave me alone for a little while. No never mind you will leave me alone and you will let me be what I want and do what I want

"event","The fact is for the last 8 months i have been hiding cuts bruises tears screaming anger.. Now that I lost the last true good thing in my live I let it all go. I hurt someone very close to me someone who has always been there and always has loved me no matter what. All of those stupid desitions like O.D.ing and cutting running away falling in love and out of it again. Making changes, the anger and fustration that comes out behind close doors. For the longest time I was hidding from everyone running from the past when thats all I know acting like everything was ok and always would be when nothing was and nothing good came out of the acting. When I finaly let people see the pain and all of the tears the feeling of insecurity inside of me got stronger. I pushed everyone away from me. Making all of the people who were close so distance and making them seem so small and hated in my mind. When I told you I didnt love him anymore and when I said I could stop and get over him I was lieing and you knew that you made me see how much I did love him and because of that I stand in the shadow of all of the things that made me who I was. Lost alot of friends to death alot more from anger and then it all came down to I didnt like me so I couldnt like you. All of the time that I have spent crying in my room hidding from everyone. The times I have made you so mad at me that you couldnt even look at me and thought it was funnie all of the times I made choices that effected everyone including you. You have been there all of my like you are my bestfriend. You made me show what I was hidding from everyone for so long. You were the first one standing with me when I was lieing in the hospital bed. When I said I was fine and there was no problem you told me not to lie. On the days were no one could make me smile you could make me cry.  The days were i was kicking myself in the ass because I made Ian fall out of love with me and I dont know how or why, you were there making sure I knew you loved me and needed me to be here. Now that things have turned and you hurt one of my closes friends. Not only that but you killed your child. The one that wasnt born still inside its mother looking forward to seeing you when the first day has come. You have made me so mad that I cant look at you. I can barrly say your name. You have hurt way to much. First you tell everyone that you love me then you love her then you ask her to marry you but you "" love me still "" and then, we find a tape in your truck. Wondering what it was Putting it in the vcr was one of the worse feelings inside of me you made me sick I was throwing up to the site of her eyes. You not only hurt her you killed her. She loved you more then anything she wanted  nothing but for you to be happy but for some reason that wasnt enought for you just like  I wasnt enough for ian. I hate you for that and i forever will.

Ps. I hate how ian and louise are assholes to us when we care about them so much. I agree. We WILL stop loving them and we will take control. We will leave and live some where else so far away no-one could find us. Sar*bear I love you -:- forever n' always -:-"

Im tierd of being everything your not, im tierd of curling up in a ball and holding myself so that i can cry and scream and let it all out of me for the first time in along time. I think about ways to let you know and ways to show you how i feel but im so scared to hurt you and i dont want to make you think that i hate you. The feelings i have inside are all in a ball and the emotions on the outside will never be noticed.I can hide it and i can lie about it for a long time. Its just when i know i have to let it go and have to show someone and let someone feel what i feel. You look down and over i look up and across. I think that in the end you will all realize who i am and you will all let it be that way... I just wish it could be today"

I get control i have a grip on it and no one but me can tell me when im hungry.. AND IM NOT... i dont think i have been hungry in a while.. when i do eat i get sick its almost like if i cant stop now will i ever be able to? thinking that the time will come were i will wake up and everything will be ok when i know it wont. For this has been the nighmare that keeps me up at night when i want it to be over i try so hard when in the end its really for nothing. Trying to stop the thing that feels so good yet so bad is why i think all of the pain around me .. the feeling of me losing my family all of my grades falling and all of the things that i want to show i cant. It makes me seem so small all of the time and it makes me seem so empty.. I want it to be ok again.. i want to be able to eat down with people and eat with them with out me feeling like i need to purge or just not eat making everyone seem like there judging me as if i need to be perfect for everyone.

"event","When i think that i can just go and do whatever it is i want people remind me that somethings cant be done because all it will do is leave me there ""playing games "" and later on it will make me feel like shit all of the time. Im sick of being me i hate losing and i hate how when i think i can win it just turns around and i fall behind. Why play games when you lose everytime? why think that everything is ok when you know it isnt and it probley never could be. Its getting so hard to stay away from drugs right now. If its not ian its parents if it not them its school and if its not that then its something else with friends or something. I never get a fucking brake from all of this shit it just keeps happening and keep bothering me. Its almost like theres nothing to do and when theres a thing standing in my way i dont know how to go around it. Going through it? thats exactly what i do and it makes me seem like nothing can make anything happyer. When i know im right and  your wrong in the end i let you be the big person and i let you have all control over me and theres nothing i can do. Everyone seems to make me want to get drugs more then less. When they say there here to help the only thing there doing is hurting me more because they make me see why i wanted to do it and make me see why i use to. Even though alot of the time it wasnt worth it to me then it seems to be more clearer to me everyday. I wake up and look out the window hoping that he has finally come for me and hes going to finally hold me and love me.. when its in the middle of the night. Going outside just so i can cry or be by myself. Making it seem like i cant do it around everyone and like im hidding shit. When im not its just that if i cry infront of you what would you say? nothing much to help me. I have always wanted to be some where else and i have been hidding things from people for so long that i dont think anyone knows who i really am.. They only know what i want to show and they can only be there when i want them to be its almost like all of the things i have control over are all of the things i want nothing to do with half of the time. Im sick of feeling like if i do something wrong me mothers going to spaze and think im doing drugs and shit when its not that. And im tierd of not being able to tell my friends anything because all they do it turn there backs on me and make it seem like everything is ok when NOTHING  is ok everything is wrong. I think that most of the time when im smiling at all of you im crying for me. And when im sitting there trying to hide stuff from you im just trying to make myself feel free and trying to make me feel like i can do it all by myself. If you dont know how i feel or what i think then you cant jugde me and that way i can hide almost everything. I show myself whats going on in the inside but its on the outside that i dont show and that i dont let people see. Someone told me that looking with in yourself is a hard thing to do but when you do and you finally bring it out for people to see they will love you and treasure you. When in the end all i can say now is what did that person know? because everytime i let it come out and showen someone things that make me who i am they run. I dont know if its because its to much or if its just because im who i am. Its like they can tell me they will be there but i dont believe that anymore. All i want now is to sit in that corner and hold myself till all of the tears stop and all of the pain just goes away. I want to be able to wake up with a real smile on my face and i want to see and feel everything the way you do. Not the way i do. Its all different and it makes me think why me? when you told me god listens and he helps people out .. you lied. Where is he now where was he when my father died where was he when i needed someone to fall back on and where was he when my mother went through hell just to be able to see her own kids when in the end she lost everything anyways. Looking back on it all now is like making a decition on weather or not i want to be part of it but if i dont then i will feel like im letting my mother down and if i do im afraid that all that will happen is i will let myelf down. When shes sitting there crying and thinking about how much shes lost in only one day it makes it feel like why and then i ask myself why am i here if there not? why could i leave im the oldest why was it that i had to get sick and make it so that my mom had no money and had to make the decition on weather or not giving them to him was a good move. God? I hate him for everything for letting me down everytime i needed him when i need someone or something to rely on theres nothing but me standing there looking around like a fucking idiot like i am. When i was younger i use to love the hugs and kiss's and all of the storys and sitting on there laps but now i hate everything because i dont want to be apart of it anymore i want answers for everything that has happen and i havent gotting anything close. And now i have to be happy all of the time and i cant let people see how i really feel because im scared to. Im afraid to cry outloud im afraid of the tears and im afraid of all of the people around me and what they might have to say. When all i want to do is cry there in his arms i cant because if im crying im his arms im letting my guard down and i cant do that anymore i have to keep everything safe for myself and i have to make sure i can servive on things the way that they are. Im so tierd of pretending i want to be ME. nothing but mE."

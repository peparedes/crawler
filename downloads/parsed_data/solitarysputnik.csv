So, this is something I'm sure we've all noticed at some point or another: people (generally women) stealing food from other people's plates.
This reads like classic primate flirtation behaviour, to me - a demonstration of classic monkey survival skills.
There's more to the idea than this, but that's about all I'm ready to articulate right now!"

"event","So, I was speaking to my housemate yesterday, and he mentioned that he had no intention of buying a bookcase for the unfurnished flat he's hoping to move into - now, the guy's a Bosnian evacuee with a drinking problem, but I still thought better of him than that!
See, to me a bookcase is more than just a thing that holds books - my bookcase is a picture of what I truly believe.
There's Altered Carbon and Glasshouse, because I believe in Transhumanism but don't expect it to fix the human condition any time soon.
There's David Eddings, because of the memories tied up there - me as a teenager first encountering Sir Sparhawk and seeing in his world-weariness an echo of mine - sharing them with my ex, arguing whether Ehlana was feminist (my argument) or annoying (hers) and trading tales - a moment that's gone and worth holding on to.
The complete collection of Ciaphas Caine books, a tribute to self-deprecation and whistling past the graveyard, and Neal Stephenson because sometimes we all want to feel clever - hundresds of points in time and memory, stories waiting to be shared - this one a loan from an old friend, this one abandoned in a cafe, fragments of faiths I've held and people I've known.
A bookcase isn't just storage, it's a piece of your soul you can show the world."

"event","So, I'm back from what I'm going to call a hiatus, and I'm going to try to post something every day - today, it's self-indulgence!
See, I'm trying to get used to expressing my thoughts for other people again - I've spent a long time wrestling Churchill's black dog, but it feels like I've got a good chance of shifting it now, and I'm so done with living life at arm's length.
That's my problem - I feel like I've become disconnected from the world, like I've drifted away from all the people I've cared about - never deliberately, but if I don't feel I've something to say I won't say anything, and just like that it's years since I've spoken to someone, and that just makes it that much harder.
There's no-one I can talk to about how I feel any more, and I'd almost convinced myself that that was because I didn't, but then all that changed.
See, back at the end of January I met a woman - a smart woman, an amazing woman, but also a faithless one.
I knew from the start what I was getting into - she was the friend of a friend, and I knew full well she was with someone else - someone who she thought neglected her.
This was the second time we'd met - the first hadn't gone so well, and this time she threw a drink at me (Which I'm assured was an accident, honest!) but she talked to me, too - we talked all night, in fact, just sharing our selves.
She opened her soul to me, light and dark both - and there was a lot of both there. Of course I fell in love! It was like rain on a desert, and I bloomed, felt things I hadn't done for years - care, and connection, and desire - They do say you always remember your first (And there's a fun fact for you - 24 years old, and I was still a virgin) and I could have done a lot worse - she did care for me too, and we were happy, but she still wouldn't leave him, and doubt started to set in - I mean, even if she did leave him how was I to know she wouldn't do it to me? So in the end, I broke it off with her, because I couldn't trust her any more than I could trust anyone else.
Now, breaking up with someone hurts, so I withdrew - and then I found myself re-reading a series of graphic novels that meant a lot to me as a teenager, The Books Of Magic by Neil Gaiman and John Ney Rieber.
It's like the perfect guide to growing up, and reading it just made me so tired of living half a life - it put me back in touch with my recently re-opened emotions and showed me that I could get myself to a better place, if I was willing to take my chances - and I'm trying, but I still feel alone - so I come to the main point of this post - apologies and thanks to the people who've meant so much to me over the years, people I've maybe not said enough to.
To the people of #gfaqs: You are the family of my heart. You've been there when no-one else was, and I'm sorry I'm so bad at being there for you.
To the marvelous Ms. Maravalo: You were the best friend I could have had, and I hope your life now is as wonderful as you could make it - I loved you (mostly) like a sister, and I'll always be proud to have known you.
To Gab: I really hope the UK is treating you well - you were always far kinder to me than I deserved.
...Is it weird that I've always been better at female friends? Anyway, whatever. Throughtout my life people have been great to me, I've never been good at recognising that in time, I'm grateful to you and I'm sorry I cut you out of my life.
...I may try to rewrite this to make it make more sense at some point, or I may not. My apologies for the ranting.
End of line.

EDIT: An apology I missed, for something more villainous than the others -
To Kylie, Sarah and Ivy: I don't think I ever really understood how much you cared, and I'm sorry for that - and for forgetting about you. I just reread my journals, and saw comments from you, and it brought you back and I'm sorry, because I didn't think I was the kind of person to just completely forget a friend."

It's not properly formatted or written yet, but I'm doing my best.

As for what it's about, well, let's just say that it's the tale of <lj-cut text=""A pathetic creature of meat and bone"">A pathetic creature of meat and bone.

OPEN:

Int. Flat, 2099

It is messy, but we can only see a hint of that as our view is focused on the screen, and the head of the Hacker in front of it. We can hear fans, and the noise of air traffic, but it is all muted behind the noise of typing.

The screen flashes so quickly that we cannot see it clearly, but something about a company called Triop, something about access, something about... Citadel.
The word flashes on the screen and then remains there, the Hacker has found what he wants.
Citadel Station - a live feed of a giant space station, spinning slowly in orbit. It looks elegant, but still functional - neither overly ornate, nor too brutal. Text now flickers in front of this feed, again faster than we can see, and in the mid-range a spinning red cone slowly resolves out of darkness.

Suddenly, everything on screen turns black and a message is spelt out.
Before the message is finished, the Hacker bolts from view.
THIS IS TRI-OPTIMUM CORPORATION DATA SECURITY DIVISION
YOUR HACK ATTEMPT HAS BEEN DETECTED
SECURITY TEAMS HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED
REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE

Cut now to behind the Hacker as he runs for the door - only to have it explode in his face as bulky shadows emerge from a searing white light. As one approaches, we can slowly make out that it is a heavily armed special forces operative, who strikes the Hacker with the butt of his shotgun and stands on him. Pan to a man in a sharp suit, with gelled back hair and expensive jewelery.

DIEGO: Let me make you an offer.

Black out.

Int. Medical facility
POV shot - Hacker

We come to lying on a futuristic bed - looking at ourselves, we see that we are dressed in scrubs, but there is a pile of clothes on a chair.
Pushing to our feet, we see a window and hobble over to it - we see earth below, and our reflection.
A green flash of light in the upper right of view and a corresponding spark in our reflection's eye as a young woman's face appears.

AGENT CARTER: Hacker?

We pull out through the eye, Agent carter vanishing, and turn around to see the hacker's eyes - the right one filled with a grainy green image of Agent Carter.
We rush in and the screen fills with green.
Agent Carter: Can you hear me, Hacker? Hacker?
Diplay title, green on black -
SYSTEM SHOCK.

"event","I'm either too smart or too stupid, depending on how you look at it.
I mean, I'm bright enough to know I'm broken, but not bright enough to fix myself.
Bright enough to know that I'm not the only person to feel like this, but too stupid to take any comfort from this.
If anything, that makes it worse; knowing that all over the world, flames burn in the darkness but they burn alone, a thousand lights, a thousand minds in concert, an elegy for youth denied.

I didn't realise how much I missed her until I went back and it crashed down on me, the lonliness I'd denied, and when I left it was winter, inside and out, but I'd thawed enough for the cold to cut.
And there's no-one I can tell this, because I can't let myself be weak in front of them, I have to be in control, and I don't know why; I never cry anymore, not even when I should or when I want to, when the lonliness cuts to the bone, when I think of the bridges I've burned, when the future crashes into me like a wave and it's ice, ice forever.
As I write this I'm staring at my blades, and it's like they're calling to me- I know it won't do any good, but I want it, I want it so much it hurts, but there's only one place this road ever ends up and I really don't want to see the inside of a hospital room again.
I'm falling apart, I know I am, I'm coming apart and I'm scared of what will be left because I know what I could be, How easy it would be to look the dark in the eye and make it my own, and why shouldn't I? What's the light ever gotten me?
I thought I was a writer, until I entered a class full of them and realised I was nothing, my writing fit for nothing, hollow and without feeling - because I don't feel, not like I should. I'm just a space, a rock life ruses around and doesn't really touch, just slowly wears away.

I feel like Laika, poor Laika, stranded and alone in a little metal tomb, a thousand miles above home and no way back.
I wonder if she was scared, if those walls seemed hateful when the air began to run thin, or if death came like a friend with a warm embrace.
And I think about how I'd like to do that, just just leave this blue planet behind and go where no-one expects anything of me, just sail away in the darkness.

But I have promises to keep,

ACCOMODATION: Pleasant enough, and the guy in the room next to me is an Irish punk, which counts as a good thing.
Bad thing: Further down the hall are some cypriots.
This in and of itself isn't a bad thing, save for the fact that it makes political discussion a tad tricky (I don't know if they're Greek or Turkish Cypriots) and the fact that last friday they were playing bizarre foreign music at high volumes until about 0400 saturday.
CAMPUS: Again, quite nice, but about half an hour away from where I am by bus.
Fortunately, the university lays on a free buss, but you have to get up pretty early in the morning to get on board before it fills up."

The UK is one of the better countries for homosexual rights, but are record is still somewhat patchy.
Until 2003, we had a law referred to as ""Section 28"", which essentially forbade teaching students about homosexuality in positive light.
Personally, I found the existence of this absolutely shocking when I found out about it, and was pleased to hear of its repeal.
Until I found out that Kent, the county in which I currently reside had, following the change of the law, had instituted its own regional variant on this law, keeping the original wording: ""(Kent authorities) shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality"" or ""promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.""
On the bright side, this was removed in february of 2005... only no, wait.
It was just reworded to state that heterosexual marriage and family relationships are the only firm foundations for society.
And this is in England.
Frankly, I'm ashamed to live in Kent."

"event","Last night I couldn't sleep, so I took my guitar and went for a walk, at two AM in the morning.
Luckily for posterity, I also took along a notepad, because I had a lot on my mind and wanted to think it through.

---Editor's note: Foul Language ahead.

CHICKEN!
POULTRY!
Okay, so that got old fast.
There are swears, though.

So, it's 0214 hours, and I'm leaning against a tree in the middle of Bumfuck, Nowhere, with a guitar by my side, a smoke in my mouth, and a notepad on my knee, getting to know myself.
I stopped practicing when A: I couldn't feel my fretting fingers anymore and B: The strings were slick with blood. (Okay, so that's an exaggeration, but i did slit my little finger sliding three to six on top E.)
The week has been up and down for me - Monday to Saturday I was pretty much doing nothing but moping, right up until I hit an absolute nadir on Saturday night.
I'll admit, it was nothing but self-pity and general assholeishness that was bring me down, and that's part of what I realised that snapped me out of it.

Some context: The previous tuesday, my sorta-girlfriend Laura came over to my dorm, and with my flatmate we did a little drinking.
Okay, a LOT of drinking.
I hate saying this, because it sounds like I'm boasting, but I just want this to be clear:
One bottle of JD.
Three crappy flavoured shots of something
And some Tequila.
As the evening was progressing (before I was too drunk) Laura and I talked, a lot, and with meaning.
I told her about Tamsin I (She knew about Tamsin II, albeit not the name... I only connected it myself whilst writing this, and I think it explains something about how I acted).
Then, at about midnight, I walked her back to her place, and she asked if I'd like to come on for a cup of tea (not ""A cup of tea and no sex"", which T II promised, and was a lie from start to finish).
I'm ashamed to write this even in a missive that no-one but me will read, but I, drunk out of my mind and horny to boot, tried to press the issue.
THankfully, I gave up, and never, EVER even considered trying to apply muscle (Honestly, had I done, I would in the morning have taken my own life. I have to remind myself that I'm not like that.)
I did this despite knowing, having been told that very night even, that she'd been hurt by guys before.
And I didn't even have the grace to remember and apologise in the morning.
Essentially, I fucked up in every way it's possible to.
Which brings us to this saturday night, and my downward spiral into mopetown.
I'd listen to a sad song (song of choice - always Hurt, by the Man In Black) and it'd almost make me cry, but I couldn't, which would make me feel worse, so I'd put on another sad song, and still not cry, not properly.
When I realised, however, that the player had moved on and I was getting teary to godsdamned TIFFANY, it all just suddenly clicked, and I had to hold myself back from laughing all night, and the following day.
I messaged Laura, and though she seemed a touch icy, I soon learned that this was because a certain someone (Naming no[my fucking flatmate, Paul] names) had told her that I was already seeing someone else.
Once disabused of this notion, she was positively eager to accompany me to the union's alt/rock night (Where I, at least, will not be drinking.)
So tonight, I came out here to get in touch with the trees, the stars, the music, and myself.
I figured out that I'm not a bad person, that neither Tamsin was all my fault, and that the early, early morning is fucking FREEZING.


---Edit:--- I could barely move my hands when i got in, and certainly couldn't sleep- Hooray for sleep madness!"

(Bear with me here, I've been awake for 19 hours and I've had all of one mars bar to eat, so my thoughts are somewhat disjointed)
What first got me thinking about this was society's treatment of people with non-standard sexual orientations.
For myself, I'm what they refer to as ""Heteroflexible""... I'm pretty much straight, but if I were to find a guy attractive, I'd have no qualms about boning them (And it's a damn, damn shame Christian Bale is married.)
But, I've been looking at the stats, and it seems sexuality-motivated assaults are approaching an all time high in England.
And I'm willing to bet a good portion of it is perpetrated by people unwilling to accept the fact that they, themselves, have homosexual leanings, so they externalise their feelings of guilt as rage and blame the victim and, by extension, their (Godsdamn it, what is the word? as Gender, but for a group linked by sexuality) for ""Making them feel like that"". And this got me thinking (Well, about two things actually, but one of them was lesbian makeouts... I haven't gotten laid in far too long) about truth.
I mean, I admit it: I lie all the time. It's almost pathological.
I have a whole emotionless facade that I apply, I smile and tell people that I'm fine, I fabricate entire events in my past because it's so dull it depresses me, I'm polite when all I really want to do is sink my teeth into someone's throat and rip it away (And I mean that literally... I have sharp teeth, and a short temper).
But worse, I lie to myself.
My emotions are a mess, a legacy of years of iron self-control.
Frankly, I don't even know what I'm feeling half of the time.
And with my emotional issues comes a whole parcel of other things, like my contact issues (I both despise being touched by most people, and long for human contact) and my self-loathing (Which, if convertible to electricity, could power Hokkaido for next twelve years).
But all of these things, I lie to myself about.
And I'm sick of it, but I don't know what the truth is anymore.
I can't be the only one, surely?"

"event","I think that is the root of my problems, reading too much.
<lj-cut text=""(I'm going to be rabbiting on about myself a lot here, so as a courtesy I'm going to put it behind a cut)"">
My earliest complete memory is going to an open-air book market in Germany with my mother. My father may have been there (It doesn't seem like he's present in many of my childhood memories, but that's a seperate issue I'll get to later) and there may have been more to the market than books (that seems likely) but the important thing is, my mother and books.
I was only five or six at the time, but she bought me a book so big I could only barely hold it for years: Dorling Kindersley's Enyclopaedia of Science.
It opened a whole new world to me.
To this day, I owe most of my understanding of science to knowledge I acquired when I when I was under the age of ten.
But more than that, the world of the page had been a source of interest to me before, but now it became a frontier, begging for me to explore it.
I ripped into book after book, eagerly consuming stories of far-off worlds and mythical journeys as suggested by my father (Who did, and does, have impeccable taste in books) and comedies and stories of humanity as suggested by mother, who was ever the well-grounded one.
And I loved them, but they took the place of a childhood for me.
I could never have had a normal childhood, not as an army kid, but I keep running into other military children (is it something in the way we carry ourselves? It seems we can always tell...) whose growth had at least a semblance of normality, but mine didn't.
It didn't help that I was burdened with a terrible name, which I am now busily divesting myself of, or that I wasn't exactly a looker (I looked SO gay as a kid you wouldn't believe it... a couple of subsititutes actually thought I was a girl. It was funny, until it wasn't.), or that I just knew more than most people around me.
I would always have a tight core (corps?) of friends, three or four people who I counted as really close (usually one of whom would be the girl I was secretly crushing on, who was also crushing on me but would instead go out with one of the other members of the Cabal simply because I seemed so unreachable (and I was, and am, to this day) which would drive me further away) and we'd play games that I'd dream up and we'd drift from fantasy to fantasy, none of us really engaging with the real world if we could help it, and only now do I realise how big a part of my life these people were, and I'm going to segue now.
(As an army kid, I got used to living my life three years at a time. It became policy to, whenever I left somewhere, go about pretending it didn't exist, pretty much blanking it from my memory, but now that I go back to think on it I can remember so many people, so many incidents, and I remember being so happy, and maybe I did have a childhood but I just made myself forget it. Back on topic now.)
When I hit secondary school, it was like a slap to the face: there was no more imagination, everything was facts and reality as far as the eye could see.
I still saw one (And only one) of my old friends, to this day I still try and see him when I get the chance, but even that changed (For starters, he ended up 'the other guy' in the little triangle I mentioned earlier - although I don't think she ever had any romantic feelings for me) and became far more grounded.
I tend to group my life into phases: There was the early phase, in which I was only barely sentient. then there's the primary stage, from which I have some fond memories and just as many bad ones, and there's the secondary stage which was pretty harsh, and the Higher/adult stage which I'm innow and is shaping up to be pretty fucking awful. Anyway, from the secondary phase onwards, I started to dislike my life more and more becauseit could never live up to what was on the pages and in my head.
I didn't want to trudge through schools, universities, and get a job somewhere, I wanted the excitement and adventure that our world has no place for anymore.
I didn't want to sit somewhere and canoodle with a pretty girl, I wanted the heart-stopping romances of Bogart and Bergman (Who were, yes, film stars, but I can't think of a romantic book I'd read at that age, so sue me) and as such I let all the chances for life pass me by.
So now here I am, in university, in a cold and lonely dorm room because I managed to utterly fail at yet another relationship, and what do I have to look forwards to?
If I follow my ideal path, I manage to get out of this country and the end of the year and spend three-four years in the states at a university there, then (hopefully) a year somewhere in the East teaching english (I'm thinking Taipei, I kind-of prefer Chinese to Japanese) and then what?
I'd have to settle down to a regular job doing something, the same thing, for the rest of my life.
The best solution I've come up with is to be a soldier, like my father and his father before me, but frankly it's not a job I can see a future past because I full intend to die in service, that my name would live on (you're never really dead as long as people remember you... Montgomery, Patton, Roger Young... as long as one man takes up a weapon to defend his home, they'll never die).
But still, I can't see the point...
I know that the only reason I don't just top myself right now is that it would hurt my family.
But one day, my mother and father will be dead.
(It's like someone said to me once... ""Everyone you love will either die or leave you"")
My brother, he'll be dead some day too, and even if not we'll eventually drift apart.
Outside of them, I honestly can't think of a single person who'd really care if, tomorrow, I were to turn up dead.
I mean, the people that regularly read this journal might feel a little sad, but in all honesty, what am I to you?
An anonymous voice, spewing terrible poetry and self-obsessed whining with equal vigour.
hell, for all you know I could be nothing more than a sophisticated Turing machine.
And I could just end it, I could do it right now.
I went shopping a week ago, and whilst I bought my regular razor heads (Gilette really IS the best a man can get) I saw a pack of old fashioned razor blades, and I couldn't not buy them.
Even as I did it, I thought that it was a mistake, and all the way home I tried to throw them away but I couldn't, and now they're staring at me and I've held one in my hand, so cold and so flimsy but so lethat, and I stood in the mirror and I hate what I see so much that I lifted it to my face and I nearly did something very, very stupid, but I'm resting it on the top of my keyboard now and I know that just a little pressure on a few spots on my throat, and it'll all be over in twelve seconds (And won't it confuse the police? I wonder how many people think to slit their own throats?) but I will be strong and I will not do it.
I already hurt myself this week, yesterday, with a lighter and a knife.
But even that is not the technicolour panacea that Plath and the others would make it out to be and I may feel better for an hour, maybe two, all I feel is sick of myself for not having the courage to tell the family to go hang and just end myself like the waste I am.
I have more to say, but I don't know how to say it yet.

It's pretty much entirely my fault, and I know it is.
The one thing, the only thing that I wish I'd done differently, the one thing that I think would have made it work out alright, is something I let fear and insecurity stop me doing.
I just wanted to hold her, properly holdher, at least once, but all the while I was too busy worrying that someone as special as her could never want someone like me to touch her, so I didn't.
I mean, I'm a terrible person.
I hurt people without meaning to, I close myself off from everyone and then complain about feeling alone, I think the worst of people, I once brutalised a complete stranger (Although the wife-beating piece of slime had it coming).
So I met her, and she smoked, and we talked a little until she had said all she wanted to say, and it was up to me to make the move that would determine how it went, and all I wanted to do was take her in my arms and hold her for a while, but she had her hands in her pockets and was turned away, so I thought she wanted me to talk, instead, and I failed at that.
As we walked back, I told her that all I had wanted to do was to hold her, and she told me that that had been what she wanted, and so I put my arm around her and she began walking faster and faster, just to get away, and that was when I knew I'd blown it, good and proper.
We reached the gate to her place and she just slipped through and left with barely a word.
I didn't give up then, though, I stood there for ten minutes just trying to think of something I could say, because it was like a weight had been lifted, I didn't have to worry about making the wrong move because hey, I already had done!
I sent her a text, asking her for just five more minutes of her time, because I decided that if she said yes, if she opened the gate, I would just step through and kiss her, without letting my cumbersome words get in the way.
Two hours in the cold and the rain later, she simply stodd on the other side of the gate and told me to go home.
One of my old friends used to quote Solomon's Ring often, ""This too shall pass"", and I guess it will, and I know I'll survive, a little bit sharper than I was before, but here and now it still hurts, you know?
Give me a couple of days, and I'll be Sputnik again, above and apart from it.

Tonight, I anticipated nothing more than an early night and maybe watching Equilibrium again (fucking fantastic film, BTW).
But, at about half past seven, I began to feel a little peckish.
""Not a problem!"" I think. ""I'll just walk to McDonalds!""
I put on my hat, my denim jacket, I place my headphones in my ears and kick off my MP3 player.
As the old song fades out (I left it in mid-song, I holds its position when switched off) I stepped out the door into the (heretofore unnoticed) driving rain, at the exact same time as the new song began: Nick Cave's ""Tupelo"".
""Oh, SHIT!"" I think. ""Goth Night!""
For indeed, it was.
I make it to the pub, despites the rain, and enter it in true cowboy style.
Groups of people, people more like me than most, sat around conversing as the stereo blasts Bauhaus.
Three hours and a litre and a half of Jack Daniels later, I'm still sat in a corner, trying to gather the courage to introduce myself to someone.

It involved being in the student's union from 1700 to 0100 the following day, but they provided plenty of free alcohol for us... something I probably shouldn't have taken advantage of, all things considered.
I've had very possibly the worst month of my life, worse than the month that saw me waking up on a hospital bed as I wasted the time of the doctors desperately trying to stop me from slipping into a coma after I consumed a massive dose of painkillers.
(As an example of how precarious my mental state is right now, I just watched the video for Linkin Park's Numb and felt like it had some kind of significance for me - so now I guess I really DO belong dead, like the emo bastard I am.)
My mind is at war with itself, because I know that on my desk is a razorblade, and I'd feel so much better, but if I start down that path right now I won't be waking up in hospital, I won't be waking up at all, but I'm far too willing to embrace that thought.
It's funny, I used to go to great pains to hide my wrists, but then I realised the simple fact that people don't care.
I wore a t-shirt yesterday, livid red marks striping my left wrist and no-one even looked twice. All those wasted hours, carefully wrapping my arms and securing my shirt so nothing would show!
I always thought it was hust a cliche about ""feeling most alone in the middle of a crowd"", but I guess cliches only get to be that by being accurate, at least a little.
The rest of the tech crew were off dancing with their partners (The tech crew, the biggest nerds on campus! I'm the only one without someone to hold!) and I just sat there in the DJ booth, trying to resist the temptation to open yet another beer, and trying not to let show how I felt inside. In one of those goals, I succeeded.
It's  tempting to think that this isn't really how I feel, that it's just the booze, but I know that all the drink did was to allow me to open up how I feel.

"event","It's time for my first foray into the world of live radio presentation.

The respective playlists are
1: Spirit of Radio - Rush
2: Cocaine - J. J. Cale
3: Lola - The Kinks
4: Whiskey in the Jar - Thin Lizzy
5: Cross-Eyed Mary - Jethro Tull
6: Fire and Rain - James Taylor
7: Paradise City - Guns and Roses
8: Up the Junction - Squeeze
9: Sympathy for the Devil - Rolling Stones
10: Teenage Kicks - The Undertones
11: Women in Uniform - Iron Maiden
12: Rocks - Primal Scream

Which I think is a nice cross-section of classic rock. (NExt week there will be more Eagles and R.E.M)
Now, hour 2:

3: Buck Rodgers - Feeder

"event","An attractive young lady was loitering on my path home today, wearing a hat almost identical to my own.
She attempted to strike up a conversation, at which point I politely declined, and indicated that I had shopping to put away.
Only now am I realising that she was totally hitting on me.
Yes, I am a sucker.
In my defence, they held a fire drill at 0645 this morning, which has thrown me out of whack.
That's my story, and I'm sticking to it!"

"event","I swear, if I find out who keeps tripping our fuses, I'm going to rip out his spine and show it to him.
I'm posting this from my laptop, which has about an hour and twenty minutes worth of charge left on it.
As an aside, and I'm probably just being paranoid, I'm getting worried about <lj user=""wreckofbones"">, she hasn't been online for a few days... Drop me a comment, would you? Just so I know you haven't died, or been bundled off to some ""But I'm a Cheerleader!"" style programming camp."

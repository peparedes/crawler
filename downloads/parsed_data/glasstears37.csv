I'M LETTING IT GO!!! i'm gonna be ok, i think, well, i hope!

"event","hello. i'm soooo happy. daniel came over last nite and it was perfect, it was more than perfect. it was different than any other time he's been over there. the past couple of times that he's come over, i hadn't ""blown up"". i think it was the deep conversation we had thursday nite. i dunno. i didn't want him to go b/c things were going so well, and everything was grrrrrrreat. so, i started to cry. i dunno why, but i think i've become more attatched to him than ever. if was older, i'd be on my knees begging him to marry me. i've never had someone love me the way he does, or never give up on me. no matter how angry i get or how mad i make him, he's never given up on me, even if i've broken up with him. he's never even given up on our relationship, where as, i have a few times. i've just never had a guy love me, truly, so i was new to it. i was so used to getting hurt in the end and getting depressed. and when i'd get mad at daniel and he wouldn't get mad, i'd be even more mad..why? b/c i've always had them be pissed off at me. i dunno. it's really hard to explain it. i'm glad he's never given up on me. if he had, i'd probably be with some dipshit guy--breaking my heart....again. but i'm glad that we've made it this far w/ all the faults we've had. without him, i couldn't have made it here to this day. i love him soooo much, words can't explain. no matter how pissed off i get at him, i still love him. i mean how can i not love him, it's impossible. just like he said it's impossible for him to not love me. deep down, i really do think we're meant for each other. i know i'm only 16 and he's about to be 18 in november, but age is nothing, neither is timing..well, timing sometimes. but i've found the love of my life. no other guy can compare to him, compare to the way he loves me, treats me, and so on. ahhh..i'm in paradise. i love you danny
love always,

Daniel found out that my popples won't be here until tomorrow, but i told him that it was ok b/c everyone else was giving me their gifts on saturday. He told me his plan was ruined or something. He got all pissy so, i decided that i was gonna let him kool down that way we wouldn't get into arguement. and that was around 12:30 or 1 am. haven't heard from him since. it seemed like he was getting all pissy at me, but that's understandable. if you're gonna get pissy you always seem to get pissed off at the nearest person. but hey! i did that to him so, i know how he feels now! grrr..it's too early in the morning..it's 9:50!!my real mom called me asking me what i wanted from sears, for my birthday. at first i was gonna get a necklace, but she couldn't find the one i wanted. so, i decided on clothes, and since im really picky about what i wear, she's gonna get me a 35 dollar gift card. good enough for me. i'm surprised she's getting me something. well, her friend chris is the one that's actually getting it for me. since, my mom barely has any money!well, i'm going over to my dad's today for my birthday. i talked to him yesterday on the phone. things have been hectic over at the house. we're going out for lunch tomorrow. i think it's gonna be me, my sister, my dad, me and my other grandpa. i'm not sure yet. but anyway, i'm having a little party on saturday and i think jv(my ex)is coming. it's kinda a bad thing b/c daniel(my current b/f)is gonna be there! i'm not sure what to do!! if they both decide to come, it's gonna be extremely weird.i'll have to talk to jv about him coming over another day that way it wouldn't be awkward for me and daniel. well, i'm gonna go.

These biorhythms cause your dark side to come out. You will feel guilty, embarrassed, jealous, shy, afraid and angry. Sounds like fun, right? You should be careful not to put your energy into one of these feelings, or things will just get worse.

creepy, huh? ya it is! i feel all of the above except shy. now why the hell would i be shy? well, i took some medicine that made me sleepy and i went to bed at 9 pm and woke up at 12:30 am. so, here i am, on the computer. i'm so bored. i was really tired from the medicine but then it wore off and now im tired again..grrrr! i'm bored...bored...bored. ahh! my neck popped. well, im gonna go. not much is going on.

"event","well, me and daniel got into a fight again, but this time it was my mistake. garrett, my ""Friend"", tells a lot of stories and he told me that daniel fooled around with other girls at the skating rink. garrett really likes me and he's just trying to break me and daniel up. and stupid me i believed garrett, i have no clue why. so, it upset daniel. i snapped and everything. but i finally came to my senses, but i didn't say anything. i felt pretty bad b/c for a minute there i didn't believe daniel. when garrett told me that, i just froze. i couldn't think at all. i got scared. i didn't know who or what to believe. i tried my best not to blow up, but it didn't exactly work. i got all shaky and i started breathing weird, then i blew up. i had to get out of the house. i didn't leave right away but when i did, it felt good to leave. i just wanted to leave and never come back. but i think i'd miss you guys too much.

"event","well,
it wasn't the best 4th ever, but i'll live. me and daniel got into a fight, but what's new? he told me tonite that his dad told him to get a new g/f b/c all i've done is cause him too much hurt for a 17 yr old. his dad doesn't know me and doesn't even understand me and why i'm the way i am and how i get, but daniel does. and hopefully, daniel will talk to his dad about it b/c it really hurt me. i know i've caused him pain but he's also caused me pain. only the 2 of us realize and understand why we love each other so much, but why can't everyone else? people think i'm just w/ daniel to ""play"" with him, Daniel is my first love-my first EVERYTHING!!! i'm not in it to hurt him or to ""play"" with him. if i was, i wouldn't be able to look him into the eyes and tell him i love him or that when he goes into the marines he's gonna have to propose to me. maybe people don't understand us b/c they've never felt love or just b/c they don't have a true love anymore. i'm not so sure anymore. people say move on, forget about him. i've tried both-believe me. and it's impossible. it's impossible to forget the one and only love you have/had. there's always going to be a special place in your/their heart for them/you, deep down inside, no matter what. i just wish daniel's dad would understand who i am and why. i think the only person who really does is daniel. he knows what is was like b/c he went through the same thing. through time, i'll eventually become a new and improved person...hopefully! but for now, i'm me and i'll always be me. even if YOU or anyone else doesn't like it.

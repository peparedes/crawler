"event","I bought yet another book tonight. Why do I torture myself and rape my bank account by returning to the bookstore every day? *sigh* The book I bought is called ""How I Became Stupid."" It's about an intellectual who decides to make himself into an idiot so that he can better fit into society. At one point he tries to become an alcoholic because he has observed that alcoholics never say anything intelligent. However, before he makes his first visit to the bar, he goes to the library and checks out like five books on alcohol so that he can become an alcoholic the smart way. Haha. I haven't even read 15 pages yet, and I'm in love with it. I think I may be addicted to books, CDs, and writing pointless livejournal entries. I would rather be listening, reading, or writing than being with people. *yet another sigh* Oh well. At least I'll be an intelligent recluse."

Rory and Kyle started a fire in the grill after Taylor and I complained about being cold. For the rest of the morning I smelled like campfire and I liked it.

"event","So, I definitely just spent an hour and a half at Blockbuster while Charlie was working. One of his coworkers, Linda (who, by the way, was old enough to be either of our mothers), is really cool. Her and I spent most of the time picking on Charlie. It was really funny. Anyway, at one point Charlie was telling a customer about a movie and saying that it was really depressing, but I inserted that it had some genuinely hilarious parts in it. That's when he turned around, threw a Blockbuster apron at me, and said, ""Hey, clock in, why don't ya?!"" Haha. It was funny, but I was very embarrassed. So yeah, my night has been interesting so far. Too bad HG is the only school that doesn't have a teacher workday tomorrow. I've been invited to several ""outings"" tonight, but I can't go because apparently Christian students shouldn't be given any opportunity to spend time with ""hell-bound public schoolers."" Oh well. I know I should be doing homework right now, but what motivation do I have when I'm graduating in less than a month? Not only that, but now I'm just going to CP, so my grades don't even matter. Bah.

"event","I'm at the Syska's house right now, and I got tired of just sitting around. Not much happened today except for the fact that I was on the verge of having an emotional breakdown at school, but somehow I managed to hold it off until I got home. I've been off my anti-depressants for about two months now, and even though I'm really glad I'm not taking them anymore, I've been really sensitive lately. Today, Lauren made a completely innocent comment about how I'm always perky when she's in a bad mood and how it pisses her off, and I almost started bawling right then and there. I just had to look away for a second and brush away a few tears before she saw me. I know that if my mom knew how I've been, she would make me start taking my pills again, but I love the way I can finally write poetry again, and I don't just feel numb all the time. I don't have to pretend to have emotions anymore--I actually have them! Anyway, I'm sure I'll be fine, I just need to ""toughen up and stick it out,"" like my dad always says. I'm just so grateful that I have people like Jordyn, Christina, Greg, and Steven who are always there to listen when I've had a bad day. They have been Jesus to me so many times, and I just thank God that He put them in my life. I am so blessed to even know them at all. Well, I ought to go because I don't want Mr. and Mrs. Syska to come home to find me on their computer. I'll update again later. 

Just remember: Watch how Jesus did things, and then follow His example. It's the best advice you'll ever get."

So, today was Field Day, and the seniors won. Yes, it was a lovely feeling. Anyway, I had a lot of fun. 

I was a little disappointed to find out from Jordyn that one of my private conversations with someone is now being talked about by everyone in the youth group. (Well, maybe not everyone...) Still, I was really frustrated because I thought I could trust this person, but apparently not.

After school I decided to call Charlie because we haven't talked in a long time. He sounded like hell when he picked up the phone, and he proceeded to tell me that his grandfather had died. I don't know if his grandfather was saved, but I know Charlie isn't. He's having a hard time, and I know that all I can do is just pray and be there for him when he needs me.

I was having an especially hard time today with my emotions. I kept seeing all the couples at our school hugging, holding hands, etc. It was hard, but I kept reminding myself that I have something even better on the way. I just have to wait (although that's easier said than done).

I'm going to tell you every last thing I've wanted to scream at you since I left you standing in the hall last week. You know who you are. I just pray you'll actually read this.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I got my first glimpse of you about 2 years ago. I saw you head banging at a church concert. You were going crazy, and you were dressed extremely weird. I even grimaced a little when I saw those ugly sneakers. But I saw your smile. It's the kind of smile that is so quirky, but it's obviously genuine. I remember asking someone if you had a girlfriend, and he told me ""no"" but looked at me like I was insane for asking. I introduced myself that night. You were friendly and a true gentleman. You were so polite and kind that I thought you were flirting at first. After a few weeks, though, I realized that's just who you were- ""the nice guy."" I liked talking to you. You made me feel important, like I always had something interesting to say and you couldn't wait to hear it. If I even seemed a little quieter than normal, you would pester me about it until I told you what was bothering me- and you didn't settle for vague answers like ""school sucks"" or ""my family is a pain."" I had a major crush on you for a long time, but it was unrequited. I eventually told you that I liked you, but I knew you already figured it out (I'm not good at hiding my feelings). Anyway, once I realized that I had no chance of ever ""winning you over,"" I decided to move on and find another guy. I dated a couple guys, and I was very good at forgetting you when I was with them. Even after those relationships ended, I could keep you off my mind pretty easily because you stopped coming to youth group. It's not that hard to put someone out of your mind when they live an hour and a half away and you never see or talk to them. Then, you came back. You told me that you were attracted to me. I was so pleased, but still a little worried about the distance. I knew that you didn't know how to handle that. I was willing to try anyway, but I knew you weren't so confident. One day I read in your online journal that you met a girl that you thought was really cute. That bothered me (a lot more than I wish it did). I even asked you about it, but you kind of shrugged it off. Then one night after youth group you pulled me aside and told me that you didn't think we would work out. You gave a couple (in my opinion) lame excuses, and then you tried to apologize. I didn't want to hear it though. I walked off and then proceeded to ignore you the rest of the night. What girl wouldn't? My pride was hurt, and I was too confused to know what to say. I shared the situation with my best friend a couple nights later. She told me that I ought to confront you, but I knew that I couldn't do that. I had so much I wanted to say, but you know me- I always hold back to prevent making things worse. Well, it's a week later, and I can't hold back anymore. Here's the deal: I think that if you really liked me as much as you made it seem like you did, then you would be willing to take a risk and try to make this work. In spite of the distance and whatever else, you should TAKE A CHANCE ON ME. If you don't, well, fine. I can't say that won't hurt, but I'll deal. I won't fall apart and become this pathetic, simpering female if you ""reject"" me. I like you a lot, but I can make it without you. Still, I'd really like it if you'd give ""us"" a chance. You've never even been on a date with me! How do you know it won't work? Please think about this. Pray about it. If you still don't think it'll work, then fine. I can accept that. But please don't just walk away because that's the easiest thing to do. The greatest things in life are the things you worked for.</P>"

I was fine one second, and then all of a sudden I'm crying ""on the shoulder"" of a stranger. I feel like my heart is in my throat and someone is reaching into my stomach and tearing out my insides. I don't want to marry him. Heck, I don't even want to date him. But, God, I want him in my life. You know how much he means to me. I would seriously give up my salvation for him (but that's a completely different matter). I love him. I have no choice. I will always love him. If he decides to leave for good this time, I will heal eventually. I know that. But it still hurts like Hell. And I know that at this very moment he's probably on the phone with a girl who doesn't know him like I do and certainly will never love him as much as I do. He's probably taken back his insipid, little freshman girlfriend with the boy's name. Remind me why I'm jealous... Because, even though I don't want him as a boyfriend, I am jealous of every second he spends with another girl when he could be talking to me. Instead, our ""cycle"" has gotten off track. It's been at least three months now. He's never taken that long to come back before. Should I be worried? I am. God, give me the strength to endure this."

"event","So, today... I went to church this morning and it was AMAZING. The choir sang a new song that definitely caused me to get teary-eyed. Pastor talked about how Jesus may send me off into the middle of a storm while He heads in the opposite direction, but He's watching me and just waiting for me to cry out to Him. When the disciples were in the middle of the sea while the storm raged around them, Jesus walked out on the water and would have passed them by except that they called out to Him. That's when He came to their aid.

After church I went to lunch at Salsas with Britt, Liz, Erin, Heather Moore, Jeremy, Amanda, Katie, David, Jessy, and Adam. Afterwards Britt, Liz, Erin, Heather, and I went to Off Broadway to look at all the shoes we can't afford. I found a pair that I am definitely going back to buy tomorrow.

I came home and was able to squeeze in a nap before work, and they even let me off 30 minutes early tonight.

Now I'm just sitting here trying to think of how I'm going to start making changes at school tomorrow. There is a lot to be altered, and I'm really not sure where to start. I've already decided that I'm not going to sit with ""the group"" at lunch anymore. I'm not cutting them out of my life, I just think it would be healthy for me to distance myself a little. I'm also going to read my Bible and pray at least once a week during lunch. This Wednesday during the ninth grade discipleship meeting, I'm going to give my testimony. Other than these changes, I don't know, but I'm trusting God to show me.

I can't believe I'm about to graduate! It just doesn't seem like I'm old enough to graduate, but I'm certainly ready. I hope I can go to CIU, but God knows best, so I'll just wait and see.

That's about all the info I have for you guys right now, but I hope you know how honored I feel to have all of you in my life. You make things interesting for me! ;)"

I also have found a job babysitting fulltime this summer. To any of ya'll who have been praying for me, THANK YOU! It really has paid off. Moving on, I have decided that even though I'm not skinny, and even though there are plenty of things I could do to make myself more attractive, I am happy. Maybe happy isn't the right word... Maybe content is a better word. I have come to terms with the person I am, and I feel great. I still don't feel very pretty, but I know that I have a good heart and that God will allow the man I'm made for to see me as the most beautiful woman in the world. I'm excited about that, but I can wait because I know I have a lot of growing up to do. I mean, how could I possibly love someone with all my heart when I don't even love God that much? He's still working on me, but I'm feeling much more encouraged about the whole painful process now."

As I was walking in this afternoon, I prayed that God would help me get through it until I can find another job. You know what? It worked. I don't like my job or anything, but I met several really nice customers tonight. One had on a really neat scarf, another has a daughter at Chapel Hill who wants to be a teacher, and the other talked to me for a long time about nudity. It was really interesting.

He's such a sweetie, and I really admire him. When I was talking to Thompson about prom and who I was going with, he said he was really excited for me.

I know I don't really need anyone's approval, but I was glad that I got it from him. Well, I went to hang out with Charlie last night, and I have to tell you that I think God was really protecting me from getting too close to him. We still had fun, but my eyes were really opened to just how dangerous it would be for me to date a non-Christian. I think we're going to hang out tomorrow night after I get off work, but I'm not worried about anything anymore. I know what I feel, and I feel really comfortable about the whole relationship now. We even talked about his situation (basically, he just got out of&nbsp;a really serious relationship, and he's not looking for a girlfriend). One thing he told me last night was that he thought girls my age were incredibly annoying and vapid. I was a little worried at first because I thought I was included in that generalization, but luckily that wasn't the case. He continued, saying that I had really impressed him because I was so intelligent. I know it's not the kind of comment a guy makes when he's hitting on you (another reason I'm not worried), but it still meant a lot to me. I would much rather be praised for my intelligence than for being pretty. Well, I'm done babbling. I just wanted to update now before I get slammed with work, babysitting, church, and a million other things. Please keep my job situation in your prayers. I would really appreciate it."

Anyway, when I visited him this time he told me I was pretty and then he hugged/held me. Awww. I'm still grinning. It reminds of this line in a Matchbook Romance song that says, ""I'll be going through withdrawal of you for this one night we have spent."" Well, I'm going to go listen to music and be bored."

At least I got to go to Tremont with Laura last night for the Epitaph Tour. It was soooooooo awesome. Being the genius that I am, I decided to wear flip-flops and then get smashed in the very front with jumping, crazy people. It was worth it though. I got to be in the very front when Matchbook Romance came up. It was so energetic, and I got completely caught up with it. I think it's the most fun I've had in a long time. Today I came into school over an hour late because my stepdad has decided he will no longer wash my clothes and I had nothing to wear. Therefore, I did started a load of laundry and slept while they were in the dryer. I came in just in time to hear John Baker speak in chapel, and it was great. I'm really glad I didn't miss it. I was so impressed with the way he let God speak through him, and it just blessed me so much. Well, anyway, I'll try to update again as soon as I get a chance."

Anyway, I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, what with work, school, homework, and church. Separately, those things aren't bad at all, but when you combine them all, it makes for a 18-hour day. I rarely get my homework done anymore. I definitely need your prayer on that one.

Another prayer request is for my uncle, Wayne Ward. If you want to know more specifically how to pray for him, ask me and I'll be happy to explain the situation. I'm just too rushed right now to type the whole story out.

"event","Have you ever heard a song for the first time and it just made you want to cry? And I'm not talking about after you hear certain lyrics in it; I mean before the words are even sung. You hear that intro and your breathing slows, you listen more closely, and longing fills your heart to its bursting point. It doesn't happen often due to most popular artists' utter lack of creativity, but if you happen upon a little know band, you might get lucky. They're the ones that give the rest of us hope."

"event","My livejournal no longer excites me. I feel disconnected, hurried, antsy. I think it's just my need to be in a new place. I've lived in North Carolina, Charlotte, and even the same house my whole life! I hate waking up and knowing I have to endure another day in the official--and very realistic-- simulation of Hades (a.k.a. HGBCS). I dread school. I feel like I'm just surviving, not really living. It's frustrating. I want to be passionate. Bah.

Moving on, I don't have my article written for Mr. Hicks because I have yet to interview Paul. I have been somewhat busy, but I know I could have tried harder to track him down than I did. The guilt is overwhelming (and that really is not sarcasm). I hate letting people down, especially my elders. It doesn't help that Mr. Hicks is one of the few teachers that I actually love and respect with all my heart. *le sigh* I know he'll get over it, but I so hate disappointing him.

However, my mom just sent me an e-mail that was kind of cheesy, but really uplifting. It was talking about different people who survived 9/11 because they were late to work for various reasons. One was late because he got stuck in traffic. Another was late because she spilled her breakfast on herself and had to go home to change clothes. Still another was late because her son wasn't ready on time for her to take him to school. It was a lot of little things like this that are so annoying when they happen, but they were better off annoyed than dead. 

Even though it's not likely that me missing a homework assignment or being late to school will save my life, it makes me realize that God has a purpose, even in the tiny details like that. Those annoyances are part of God's plan, and He has a reason for everything that happens in my life.

Anyway, I might as well do my devotions and go to bed early since I don't have a way to finish my article tonight. It's still frustrating, but I'm trying to concentrate on the fact that God still loves me and has everything figured out. I hope you all realize the same thing."

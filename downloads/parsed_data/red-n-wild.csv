"event","i feel like life is moving so fast n i can't catch up. my close friends are now people i see once every few weeks. my good friends(roommates) suddenly freak out when drunk n kick my ass. my ex is trying his damnest to be nice n get me back(fat chance). i feel like i'm isolated n i don't have anyone to talk to. i'm moving out of my place i think...maybe with jason n rico if things work out(i don't think they will). i'm starting school again n i should graduate may 20th, which will suck cuz none of my family can come so i don't think i'll say anything to anyone n just go myself. i can't get home to montana n i want to more than anything right now. i guess if i have to live on my own i'll get a puppy n try to make new friends since everyone else is busy with their own life. it's funny i don't even want to date anymore. which is a bad sign. must mean i'm going to start shutting out everyone who shut me out first...no good.
i don't do anything other than work 65hr weeks right now cuz i have nothing else to do. started running 6miles every day hoping that would help my mood, sometimes it does. well at work and i gotta run. til then

"event","so i've been sick the whole time my rents were here yet we still had fun. christmas was great n i got everything i wanted(n didn't know i wanted) from my roommates n rents. 

on a sad note my cousin died on sun(day after christmas). she was really close to my family n i. she was the one who introduced my rents in the first place n i used to babysit her grandbabies. i don't think it's set in yet or i'm really holding it in well cuz i still haven't cried yet. i've been keeping as busy as possible so i wouldn't think about it.

 2nite i'm going shopping(which i normally hate) to find a sexy outfit n shoes for the club 2nite. then i'm gonna party with my friends n just have fun. i guess it's much needed at this point. i really had to fight the urge to call tony last night to talk...or ask him back. retarded i know, but the urge was almost overwelming. guess i just didn't realize how much i depended on him til he left me. but don't freak jen cuz i didn't call him...i'm smarter than that. 

it just seems that everytime i start to get back on my feet n stable something happens to try n knock me back on my ass. don't get me wrong i'm not saying ""poor pity me"" i'm stronger n more upbeat than that. it just seems ironic to me n i just have to shake my head in wonderment at life. it's funny but no matter how old i become (not in yrs but experience) it seems life always has a twist to keep me on my toes.

well enough ""deep"" thoughts for now. have fun be safe and always remember to keep your chin up nothing is ever as desperate or hopeless as it seems.

p.s. wish me luck with the sexy outfit and finding some fun tonite!!! still a little ""riled up""

"event","all right i admit that i had a small pity party yesterday after i wrote my entry. but my bestest buddy jen helped me out of that. so when i went to the club i was rightously mad n spoiling for a fight if ass wipe showed. he didn't n i had fun dancing. my good friend shelia(also my boss) went w/ n we spent all night looking at men, talking, dancing, n drinking. i feel much better today. i realize i don't have to put up w/ shit like that. it's the old fish in the sea analogy. i just hooked the wrong one. but today looks like nothing but sunshine n rainbows. back to my old self of sillyness n happiness. i have to thank my friends jen, terry, michelle, shelia n meghan for helping me only have a 1 day funk instead of longer. i luv ya'll n u know i'm always here for u no matter what.
so keep smiling n always look at the sky not the sidewalk when walking through life.

"event","last night my bf tony wanted to c me. he said he had stuff to do at the mall n said i should meet him there. when i got there he said hello gave me a hug n kiss. we walked through the mall for 20min just chatting then he said we needed to talk. we sat on one of the benches outside the mall n he proceeded to tell me everything he didn't feel was right in our relationship. he told me he loved me w/ all his heart but he had to let me go cuz he didn't think our relationship was working.
    i should specify we've been together a yr n the whole time he was breaking up w/ me he kept saying how he loved me n how he'd miss me.

now i'm confused, if u love someone n the thought of not having them in your life hurts n makes u sad...why the FUCK do you leave them??? man i was hurt, n i was PISSED! so what do i do? do i talk to him or let him talk to me. do i even give him the time of day? i don't know. i'm so tired of the bs i'm just ready to throw in the towel n tell him ""i love u, but u made your bed now u have to lie in it""
   guess i just need some helpful advise."

"event","i just got done reading jen's 80's info page and it's sad that i've done 65 out of 69 of the questions...so i think i died in my sleep last night cuz i don't remember dreaming and i don't remember moving. i slept 10 1/2hrs and i was late to work by and hour(doesn't matter my boss is kewl and my friend so she understood). 

i'm totally jazzed for the weekend and i'm about to go shopping tonight(ugh...i hate shopping)i have to find a sweater for the weekend. i was bummed cuz my roommates were going to a work christmas party on sat(they all work at the same place...i'm the black sheep of the group) and the tat parlors don't have xmas parties. so my roomies managed to get a ticket for me and invited me to go.  yay for me! it's pretty fancy so i have a killer fancy dress to wear(never thought i'd ever get to wear it). then jen asked if i wanted to go as her ""date"" to her xmas party on sun. (used to work w/her...left cuz of sucky people) i'm going so that i can giggle w/ her at the silly people who thought i wouldn't do anything worthwhile after that job...i showed them!!!

it should be a blast this weekend...right now i'm off to be set up on a ""blind meeting"". my boss wants to introduce me to a guy she says is perfect for me and he works at one of our other parlors. wish me luck!!!

p.s. jen if you don't call me tonight, i know where you live and i have scissors...let's just say you'll have short hair...capeesh?

"event","so i thought i'd try writing an entry of my own. i'm so tired right now i'd love to curl up like a cat and not move for days. i only had about 3hrs. of sleep this morning(went to bed around 6am) then i put in a full day with my psycology classes and work. after work i stayed up to watch csi las vegas(woohoo go vegas!) then jen came over and we went to eat. so now i'm past delirious and have entered the slap happy stage of the night. last night was like a bad episode of a soap opera...i was literally thinking 'have i managed to somehow transport into a terrible soap or am i dreaming'.

 i was trying to get ready for the club last night with my girls(have 3 roommates, 2 girls, 1 guy, huge house) when one of my roommates got into a fight with her man. she's a tiny little mexican chick and her man is a little bigger than her but built strong as hell. so the fight went outside and started to get physical, that's when i stepped in, i had to seperate the boyfriend off my girl so my other roommate could get her inside to where it was safe. in the process of this i got a little pushed around and my foot was stomped all over(was barefoot at the time and my foot was already completely bruised and sprained). after we all got inside(minus the bf) we got ready and went to the club. once at the club my girls and i got drunk, one of my friends (who adores the ground i walk on...thats a direct quote)showed up. i gave him a hug hello and that's when all hell broke loose. my ex-bf was there(i didn't know he was there) and saw the hug he was pissed and looking for a fight. the next 2hrs were spent trying to keep him from fighting, trying to settle an arguement between myself and my other roommate and trying to keep my mexican friend away from her bf(yes he showed at the club). what a mess!!!! i was so upset and exhausted by the end of the night i took everyone home, got cussed out on the phone and broke down and cried...

i should specify that i HATE to cry, i rarely ever cry unless you push me to my limits with stress and just being a bastard.

today everyone was fine and acted like nothing happened...my ex had the nerve to call and say it was good to see me in the club!?!

i guess i just don't understand people sometimes. why would you want to get everyone riled up about something so stupid and cause all the drama. the whole thing was pointless and all it really accomplished was hurting me. and why the hell would my roommate get back together with her bf like nothing happened. she's damn lucky that it was me that got pushed around and not her( i'm from the country...i know how to fight and i know how to fight dirty if i'm at a disadvantage). it amazes me the thought process the human mind takes and what excuses people use to justify actions to themselves...

wow i feel so much better now that i vented...sorry for the complaining. i guess it's like my daddy always said 'tomorrows another day, so keep your head up cuz you can only learn from the bad days'

jen you rock for showing me how to lj. try not to kill anyone at work, or if you need to i know a guy, who knows a guy, who has a friend that could solve you problems for $50...just kidding   ;) sleep well and may you dream of nothing but faeries and moonlight

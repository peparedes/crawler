"event","I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care

And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear, my dear
The seven things I hate about you

The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing
I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
And when we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined
Everything's all right
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing
I like the most that you do
You make me love you
You do"

"event","I'm so relieved today, as I think I may have decided what I want to do in life, finally!
After looking at various university pages, and a discussion between my mom, sister and best friend last night, I came to a decision i want to settle somewhere in the Fashion-Journalism area.
I want to do my BA Hons in Fashion Journalism at London College of Fashion :)
I always said that I'd hate to live in London. I can hardly last a day there, let alone months in that city. And at the age of 18 I dont feel that I'd be ready for up and moving - on my own, to the big bad capital city of England.
But the thought of Fashion and London combined excites me.
I dont think it's the right idea to follow the lives of superstars, but i can't help myself after watching so many episodes of MTV reality show ""The Hills""
I think it's probably one of the most ridiculous things i've ever thought of doing, but the life of Lauren Conrad is easily compared to my own. Minus a few years of age, and the internship at Teen Vogue in LA (a life long DREAM of mine).
I sit here in bed, on a boring Sunday evening, dreaming of a better, more fashionable life this time in two years.
This time in two years, my life will be completely different. For the better I hope!
I hope that this degree will be somewhat a breath of fresh air for me. While i'll be getting away from the drama and the stress that Bristol and Newport gives me and starting a fresh in London, i will not be leaving the best of best behind. Charlotte will be down the road at Sussex, Dan will be studying in London, and Laura will be in Kent. I wont be alone, and however i may try and forget the past and push all negative past issues aside, i will never be able to forget. And I see this as bad thing, as I definately don't want to forget. Maybe only a couple of things, which will be easily left behind. For the better."

"event","another week has passed, and its finally that time again - party time!
even though my last entry was a mere 19 days ago, alot has changed, yet again.
my life is constantly moving forwards and backwards, and recently i havn't really known whats been going on in my life, but now i feel as if im on the straight and narrow road once again :)
jon mack - gone. we're friends, but no where near as close as we were. he's cocky and arogant, and generally not the nice person i thought that he was. but people change, especially as you get to know them better and have known them for a longer time period.
there is no real love intrest right now. which is rare for me. normally i need some form of male attention, but with the help of my new friends, i've come to the conclusion that i don't even have time for a boyfriend.
looking back on when i was with josh, i would go home with him, and end up walking off with him when we were on nights out. 
now, i wouldn't dream of doing that. i've had a selection of such amazing nights out with my girls, i couldnt think of anything worse than to be teared away from their humor and love, for someone who will just use and abuse me until they feel like they're done with me. boys come and go but friends will always stay, and i'm 100% sure that these ones will stay with me forever.

i've drifted from old friends, and it's sad. i don't even speak to them anymore, and lessons with some are awkward and to be quite honest, alot of effort which i could do without. they seem to have some sort of barrier up, protecting themselves from me, as if i've done something wrong. and i cant get through. we dont get on like we used to, and theres no way in hell that i could have a laugh and a joke with them anymore. it's weird. i havn't changed, it's them. i'd gladly still be close with them, i have kept many a friend in bristol close, even if i am away on weekends. but it just shows the sort of people that they are deep down, jealous, selfish and self centred. and i dont think i want to be part of that. infact, i know i don't. and i've made the right move.

i spend time with the new friends, and look at the old, and realise that the old were never really friends at all, infact far from it. they were just convienient.
but what is the definition of a friend?

""Friendship is a term used to denote co-operative and supportive behavior between two or more beings""

""supportive behaviour between two or more beings""  - supportive behaviour, something that i never felt from the old, but something i feel everyday, if more, with the new.

""for friends, we're so in love. it's crazy""
and the funny thing is, we are. we look out for eachother so much, and care for eachother, it's weird. i've never had friendship like it.
after days on end with eachother, most friends start to feel annoyed, as if they've spent too much time with one another. but since 29th february i have spent every weekend with them, and not once have i felt annoyed, or bored. 

it just goes to show that we're all meant to be friends, and meant to be friends for a long time, not just a stupid 5 second friendship.
even if uni does tear us apart, location wise, we will never be torn apart as friends. no matter what, we stick together.
people are jealous of our mega strong bond, i just admire it :)

xXx"

"event","you wouldn't believe it, but even MORE has changed since my last entry :)
some things for the better, others for the worst. but i think i'm finally finding ""my place"".
first things first my lifestyle has completely changed. i am constantly travelling to and from newport. it's like i have a totally different life now. the independance it has given me is a god send, and i like sitting down on the train for 35 minutes and having time and space just to listen to music. and think.
i spend all of my weekends in wales. friday nights - meze - hannahs. saturday - work with charl - meze - hannahs. sunday - hang outs.
that was my routine weekends for about a month. then on the 9th of april everything changed.
i didnt think someone would change me, but he did. and i believe that im a stronger person now, than i ever have been.
thankyou :)
for the weekends spent at harrow road. the cwtches in bed. for holding my hand when i was upset. and for generally just being a really nice guy. you've helped me more than ever for these past 2 months and i wouldn't have it any other way. you're a star, and probably deserve a better friend than me.
but thankyou for sticking around, even when i've acted like a complete bitch to you.
this wont make any sense because i havn't told the whole story, but all you need to know is that he has saved me at a time when i needed saving most.
no more joshua adam rimmer. no more friday night drama. its all over. and for once im happy, and the most content with life that i've ever been."

"event","soooooo much has changed since last entry!!!!
i've been going to newport every weekend, its been pretty sweet. i've made the most amazing friends ever, dan, hannah, drew, annie, aliese, oonagh, laura etc etc! and not forgetting charl, ash and cassie too :) we've had so many laughs its been insane.
the bristol people have pretty much lost all intrest in me, no one has made any effort to invite me to anything or meet up. not suprised though, just shows the kind of people they are really. when all my welsh friends are planning all the time to see me in our spare time. they just make me feel more wanted:)
been spending SO much time with josh, it's been lush. he's been out for the past 3 weeks with me on fridays and 2 out of 3 of those times i've ended up going home with him and he's just so niceeeeeeee and eeeeeeeee!
his kisses are the best and i love it when we're in bed and he makes me feel all secure :):) 
he just amazes me in every way possible and aaah, i've definately fallen for him. again.
3rd time lucky maybe? i hope so. cos we actually seem to be going somewhere now...whereas before it was a vicious circle.
he's asked me out too both these times i've stayed over, but nothings really carried on even though i've said yes both times. but then again, we're both very drunk when we both say these things haha.
but yes. im content :) and its been forever since i've actually felt like this! so it's nice to have things going my way for once.
i'll keep you updated as per usual. sorry for not writing for 2 months, but yeh. like i said.BUSY TIMESSS!
and i dont get upset anymore which is probs another reason why i dont write much anymore.
see you soon!
xoxoxo

20th February - Saw Josh
22nd February - Saw Josh
29th February - Saw Josh (amazing night with him)
1st March - Saw Josh
15th March - See Josh
16th March - Josh's Birthday

AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO! AAAAH!

it was amazing. probably the best 2 weeks in a while, and and and. i just dont know what to do :(
he is sooo gorgeous and when he touches my back i just get that fuzzy feeling and i feel so secure and safe. and when i held his hand as we fell asleep i never wanted to let it go...

i love being around him, we have so much fun and so many laughs. i just, i dont know what to think.
that russian cunt is moving to birmingham for uni this year which is a weight off my shoulders, still, theres gotta be something still going on there...i just cannot trust him as far as i can throw him.

i dont even know if he likes me in that way anymore? i've just assumed he's been having the same feelings as i've been having. but we both agreed in january we will never stop liking eachother, its just not possible after everything we've been together. but i cant just sit there and be his friend. cos the feelings for him will always be too strong, i'll always feel as if i want to take things further when im with him.

i stopped myself kissing him on friday night because i didnt know if it was what he would have wanted, as i was pretty drunk and he hadn't been out with me. i wish i had now, i should've taken the risk, cos things might have turned out different to what they did. 
:/

i've taken to listening to starting line again too, cos they remind me of happiness.

"event","hasn't it?
i've had such a packed lifestyle recently. and i've hardly been able to concentrate properly on anything.
i went to new york - it was amazing. the most beautiful city i have ever visited, it even beats paris!
not only was it an amazing city, but i travelled with some amazing friends. definatley a trip that will never be forgotten, and i made friends which will, hopefully, never be lost.
everything that happened to me at new year, it still sometimes passes through my head. but not so much as to drive me crazy. sometimes i still think wether i could have done something to change what happened, but i dont think there will ever be a right answer...
i'd like to think i'm very much over him, but i'll never be able to fully forget him. he's so special to me, STILL, after everything, after all the pain he has caused me, he will always have <i>that</i> place in my heart. i dont really think he deserves it, but you cant help who you fall for.
we still speak regularly, its nice. we're on mutual speaking terms which is how i always wanted this whole thing to end. its comforting to know that we both will still continue to care about eachother regardless of whatever is happening.
it does annoy me though, when he wants to come and pick me up, and wants to see me, and tells me this. i find it hard because i dont quite understand what he wants from me. he's ditched me 3 times before (3rd time lucky maybe?) for someone else, so what is so special about me? why does he still want to see me, and be around me? can he not just give me up? like so many other girls he has. i will never understand what goes on in his mind, but i think it's for the best.
well i'll keep you updated on current situations, as always. even if i dont post for a month or two, im sure i'll be back willing to spill my heart or rant here. this journal really has saved my sanity!

this feeling is like nothing i've felt before, a weight from my shoulders removed.
alot has happened these last 7 days - for the better.
you have told me that you are in a weird state of mind recently, and therefore don't know what you want. and i couldnt care less.
the thought of being with you makes me sick, whereas this time last week i would've jumped at the chance.
reality check. and around 100 episodes of sex and the city later, my body has realised i can do better than you, i don't deserve this, and you, at all. i deserve something so much better.
and i think you've finally realised that, and its shocking for you.

some mornings i wake up with no sign of you at all; 
no missed call, no new txt, no msn conversation, no trace.
i dread waking up to mornings like that. everyday.
it's the only way i can connect with you these days
a quick 10 minute call in the middle of the night.
a quick hello on msn while i am sleeping.

"event","<p align=left>nine months i come back to my live journal to find some of the most embaressing thoughts i have ever thought about someone written here...haha.de ja vu post i hear you cry? yeh. it's quite funny.i dont know how i had such strong feelings for someone i hadnt met but it seemed i was caught on him for a while! riiiight so at this moment in time,looking back on march 06 i think i have grown up alot.
i've realised true feelings for people and how they come about and why.
also i know when i know who i want, and how to get them.
i could be looking for someone, i could find someone. find them attractive but their personality
not so. normally im just looking for someone. but the people i fall for normally come when im least expecting them, and not looking for them at all. i've had a brief encounter of this a few weeks ago, and i think it was pretty magic :)!
i'm over my last ""love"", not completely over, i only have small amounts of feelings for him at the moment because
im scared of not having anyone there. i don't know if he likes me still or not, but i hope he has moved on because i have too.
well, so i think. this boy. he's lovely, perfect. but with one hitch. i've never been in this situation, its not as if i havnt met him, or he's not close enough, or he's too old for me, or even that he doesnt like me back! but the only reason my feelings have died for ******* is because i've been waiting for him for a heck of a time! i've waited so long that i've waited my feelings out.
and i dont want that to happen to my new interest. but i dont think that will happen any time soon...he's actually the most gorgeous person you could ever meet...mmmm! well this has become a slight essay! haha, but i dont care because i've been able to let my feelings out i guess.
i'll come back to you with this one...you never know!
xxx
ps; why do i feel so threatened by pretty people. i want to be perfect like everyone else seems, its not fair ahaha!
im feeling like i have to compete to actually stand out and make people be like ""wow, her outfit looks nice"" or anything like that! gaygaygay."

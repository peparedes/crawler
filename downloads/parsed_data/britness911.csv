"event","so........do you ever wonder why you let things get to you so much and why you show that it does? ?  i mean i dunno i guess my biggest weekness is letting things get to me and showing that it does. ok i guess sometimes it's good to show it but nope, not for me because i always fuck things up!! and for that i am sorry. i guess it's something that's been happening for a reason but still, i dunno i guess i need help working on that :-/.........
         let's see here what else has been going on, well i'm sick! i have a bad sinus infection and it sucks big time. oh and the doc started me on iron pills bc i'm highly anemic and they took my blood and are doing all these tests on it i dunno that kind of worries me a bit, and she said that i have to go back in like 2.5 weeks and get more blood taken and then another 2.5 weeks after that and if my blood counts haven't gone up significantly then i might need to get a blood transfusion!!!~YUCK~ yeah it kind of worries me about that too but i don't know. umm i start physical therapy on monday, thank god! i can't wait till i can run and play soccer and walk around campus without pain again. my justin's shoulder is getting much much better. i'm very happy about that! i can't wait till it's all better and i can just give him a HUGE hug!!!!!!!!~i know i'm a major dork!!~ oh jerusha comes to visit next friday. she gets to come from sunny 86* HAWAII weather to 0* snowy NEW YORK weather-haha she gets to deal with what we go through, tee hee-  well that's about it i need to watch ER take some hydrocodone, NYQUIL and go to bed, don't have class tomorrow till 1:00, YAAAAAAY!! well adios."

"event","Well let's see here i haven't written in a little bit, haven't really been up to it. My knee is doing A LOT better. I'm walking on it without crutches and everything. It did fill up with fluid last week to the point where i couldn't bend it or straighten it at all, it was HUGE, so i had to get it drained<YUCK>!!!! It's still a little hard to bend but with physical therapy AGAIN and with some time it will get better. Justin's shoulder is doing better, thank god, oh the other night by accident i like squeezed his arm and it hurt him, i felt soooooooooo bad, im a retard! Dad got his surgery, it went well, he's in A LOT of pain and his is going to take a long time to recover from. OH school started yesterday, i think this semester is going to go really well and i love my schedule. oh and to my SURPRISE i walked into my Criminal Investigation class and who do i see, ROBERT SMITH!!! for those who don't know he's a close friend of the family that we met in hawaii, he was in the marines but is out now and is back living here in NY and is IN MY CLASS!!! YAY!! So that's about all the new things, oh yeah and Jerusha comes home Feb. 6th from hawaii to visit and be in claud's wedding, VALENTINE'S DAY!!! should be lots of fun.

"event","Well i got my surgery yesterday, it went well. i guess what i did was i dislocated my knee cap and i kept playing on it the entire soccer season so i tore cartilage around it and i have a slight tear in my ACL. So they cut out the torn cartilage and left the ACL alone for now bc it's such a small tear, i just hope i don't tear that more! they also gave me a video and pictures of my surgery, i have yet to watch the video but the pictures are pretty interesting! oh and they didn't give my the spinal anesthesia they gave me general so i was pretty happy about that. yesterday when i got home i was pretty sick, but my justin was here to take care of me. i think i was sick because in the hospital on top of the morphine and stuff they gave me 2hydrocodone pills on an empty stomach~NOT GOOD!! and today i def blacked out and almost fell, good thing my dad was right behind me and he caught me and put me on the couch, he's my hero!!! it was a pretty scary thing and i am glad he was there bc if i had fallen on my knee, yeah that would be a very bad thing.oh and stefanie(my brother's gf) came home yesterday, very exciting. she is awesome! and well that's about it for now, think i am gonna go lay down and watch a movie or somethin, bc i am in some pain and i am extremely bored. lata!!!"

"event","Well let's see here.....this is my first entry thanks to steph! Umm not too much going on here, been pretty bored and am actually waiting for school to start again, the 20th. I am hoping that this semester goes a lot better than last because well, i did horrible. oh and because i did bad and was in a major that i should never have been put into i can't take over 14credits which means i am going to have to take about 3classes over the summer so that i can play soccer next year! gotta love HVCC. oh i get my surgery on my knee tomorrow. yup gotta be at the hospital by 6:30 but my surgery isn't until 8:30. yeah for those who don't know i messed up my knee playing soccer for HVCC in september. i am pretty nervous but i am hoping that it works because i want to actually be able to do things on it and not have it hurt esp. play soccer and next year be able to play b-ball at school since i couldn't this year.....well umm that's about it, oh my justin is doin better, he got his surgery last week, i was so scared for him but he gets his sling of in 11days!!YAY!! alrighty well that's all for now, wish me luck for tomorrow.........."

the new red hot chili peppers album comes out tomorrow!  i'm so excited!



i had a really good workout today.  i biked for 30 minutes and did 10 different machines.  i spent about 2 hours there today.  the perfect workout.



ooh i went shopping yesterday and bought some fun things.  things i wouldn't normally buy.  but i did!  so yay for new things.



i miss tallahassee ever so slightly.  mostly the people.  including my roommate.  or ex-roommate technically.  but i don't like the sound of that.  and also jcc.  jewish community center?  i think not.  i really don't understand myself sometimes.  actually it makes sense doesn't it?  you like someone better when they're nice to you.  when they're not so nice, you like them less.  EXACTLY.

"event","so apparently the Y by my house is closed until monday.  how annoying.  i've only been once since i've been home and i went today in the hopes that i would get back in my routine.  i guess not.  yeah and before i came home, i didn't go to the gym for like two weeks.  and it's bad because i'm being extra lazy at home.  that's ok, i guess monday isn't that far away.


in other news, i've become addicted to deal or no deal now.  it's a fun show.



people don't update their livejournal that much anymore.  i guess everyone got over it.  or have a myspace.  i don't really see what's so great about myspace really.  



oh yeah, when i was driving back from the Y today, i noticed something REALLY different about southside elementary.  the playground is gone!  i mean i took one glance and nearly hit the car in front of me.  there are just huge buildings going up where that awesome playground used to be.  i remember like a year ago, they turned that field at the front of the school where kids used to play into another place to put portables.  like 10 of them.  and now the other playground is gone.  for more buildings.  people need to stop having so many babies!  seriously, overpopulation.  not cool.  it's really very sad.  i used to play there when i was little.  pine view is probably changing too.  it's getting more stupid by the year.  that sounds horrible, but it's true.  it's all sad.  i'm sad for the kids who don't have their playground anymore.



also, it was alia's birthday yesterday.  happy birthday alia!  we went to olive garden for dinner.  it was pretty good.  i got to see people i haven't seen in a while.  so that was nice.  i realized that i miss talking to people i hung out with last year. which reminds me...i love finding things from a long time ago.  like today i found birthday cards from a few people, namely jill and alia from 9th grade.  and they were hilarious!  and i thouroughly enjoyed remembering all of our crazy inside jokes.  fun times.

it really is weird to be home.  i forgot how bored i get sometimes.  i mean i do have a room absolutely FULL of crap from fsu, but i just don't even know how to start unpacking all of it.  haha i hope i don't leave it there all summer.  i mean really, i can't even get to one of the windows in there.  so i guess that's one thing i could be doing.  i'm also trying to figure out what job to get.  i have a few options i just don't know which one to take.  in the mean time, i've been rereading harry potter.  i forgot how much i like the latest book.  and i guess i'll start going to the library again soon.  i know it's not going to be the same though.  it seems that after last year, all the volunteers stopped coming.  hopefully this summer we can get more people to come because last summer was really fun.

and what a question it is.  i'll have to be answering to that one soon because just an hour and a half ago, my red wings lost to the damned edmonton oilers.  and we're out.  and the lightning are out.  and now i don't know what to do with myself.  but seriously now, the OILERS???  i really could not stop swearing when they scored that 4th goal.  i mean come on, we were winning 2-0 (yes that's right, ZERO) after the second.  after that it was all downhill.  damn.  we should have won.  bottom line.  we should have beat them in four games.  maybe five.  i think towards the end of the regular season we were riding high, knowing we had the president's trophy and were in the playoffs.  but the oilers proved to be tougher than they look/are.  they played well against us.  and that's the only compliment they're getting from me, because really, they're just a bunch of...well, people i don't like.  let's leave it at that.  now i don't know who to cheer for.  i guess anyone who plays against the oilers.  because they suck.  also, i think there are going to be retirements.  i'm scared to see what happens because even though i know the potentials have had great careers, i'm not quite ready to see them go yet.  knock on wood.

i just realized i missed nicklas lidstrom's birthday.  it was yesterday, so i only missed it by a day.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!  at least he got to spend it at home in detroit.  but then they had to lose today.  gah i'm so upset.  but it's not over yet.  



oh yeah, i'm finally home.  my room is an absolute mess.  i really don't ever want to go through all that stuff, but i guess it would be nice to be able to walk around my room if i ever felt like it.  so yeah, i got home yesterday at like 8:30 or something.  and i went to bed at 10:30 and woke up at 9:30...that's 11 hours.  apparently i was tired.  and also i didn't sleep very well on thursday.  it was a bad night.  EVERYONE either left on thursday or was already gone.  so it was a lonely night.  and then i had to load up my car by myself.  it took me like 6 or 7 trips up and down the elevator to get all my crap downstairs.  good thing it was working then.  i would not have enjoyed carrying everything down the stairs.  anyways, i'm here now for the next 4 months.  i need to get myself a job and stuff.  we'll see how that works out.

well, lizzi is gone.  i have no more roommate!  she left on monday.  these past few days have actually been really hard.  how i felt when she left rivaled how i feel when my sister leaves after a visit.  i find i can't be in my room for very long without getting sad.  and it's not just her i miss, i'm going to miss 502, my double with bath, just everything.  i really get too attatched to things.  but really, this year was great for the most part.



ok i have two exams left: history of asia friday at 8 and advances in astronomy at 12:30 on friday.  i must study like i've never studied before for both of those since they are both very important for my final grade.  after those i'm out of here for good.  i've already started packing and i think i can fit everything in the back of my car.  i previously thought that i would need my dad's car too, but i really don't have that much stuff.

hockey tomorrow!  both my games are on at 7.  i'm missing both of them due to our goodbye dinner, but that's ok.  i can tape part of one of the games i guess and hopefully get back to watch the end of both of them.


man, i still have to go to three classes tomorrow.  that's crap.  i mean i don't HAVE to, but it would be beneficial for me to go.  ah yes, next fall i don't have to worry about friday classes because i don't have any!  that's very exciting.  i also think i'm going to bring a bike up since basically all of my classes are on the complete opposite corner of the campus.

let's make a list or two, shall we?  sounds good.


things i'm excited for:
-band concert tomorrow
-alias watching after band concert tomorrow
-family guy watching after alias watching after band concert tomorrow
-going home
-HOCKEY PLAYOFFS START FRIDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  yes i'm REALLY excited about this one, it's just too bad the edmonton oilers won't last past the first round.

things i'm not excited for:
-finals
-leaving 502
-saying goodbye to lizzi (i keep almost crying)
-packing
-hauling all of my crap to my car


oh wait, there's good news: i got my single.  SCORE!  room 512 in landis hall.  so beautiful.  such a nice number too.  not as good as 502, nothing can beat 502, but still nice.

"event","today has been the laziest and most boring day ever.  i woke up at 10:30 (which is pretty late for me) and proceeded to NOT have my usual big breakfast because of the large dinner i had at olive garden last night.  yeah salad, breadsticks, lasagna, tiramisu.  then lizzi and i took a quick publix trip to hunker down for the crazy thunderstorms we were supposed to have today.  except they never came, only for like 5 minutes.  i bought a whole publix sub.  normally i would be happy about that, but now i really don't feel like eating the other half for dinner.  it doesn't look or smell appealing to me.  but there's nothing else to eat unless i want to go somewhere.  i did get some work accomplished though.  i did my lab report this morning, which is crazy because usually i do that the day before it's due.  and i also read some for history, which could be helpful for the final.  and now i'm just sitting here watching a lightning game and listening to a red wings game on my computer.  fun times.  i love it when i hear the ""let's go red wings!"" chant at away games.  if i ever get over my fear of flying, i'm going to detroit to see some games.  yeah that would be the first thing i would do.  i really don't know if that's ever going to happen.  it's hard because the only way you can make yourself get over something like that is just to do it, and that's the thing that's hard in the first place.  i can't win!  


i want summer to be here.  not because of the beach, or the heat, or anything like that, but because i won't have school and all the work and stress that comes with it.  i'll probably be getting a job and hopefully be learning how to ice skate.  i'm very excited about that.  i know it sounds pretty lame, but i really don't care, it's something i really want to do.

on to the real entry.  i've been better since my four tests are over and done with.  i really hope i'm never that uptight again.  and i met with my advisor the other day finally.  i've almost decided that i'm sticking with meteorology and possibly getting a math major too.  i like math.  now if i can just study more...


i'm so excited for the hockey playoffs in like a month.  most teams have around 11 or 12 games left to play.  and of course my red wings are number one in the league.  hopefully this year i'll get to go to some lightning playoff games.  hockey games are really fun to go to.  and hockey has passed football as my favorite sport i think.  it's just more exciting.  and i think i've probably gotten into it more this year after not having it last year.  i wish stupid oln showed more red wings games.  i mean come on, they're like the yankees of baseball, everyone likes watching them.  i'm not even sure why the ""outdoor life network"" shows hockey games, but whatever.  i don't get to see any games besides the lightning otherwise.  



i spent like the whole day shopping, desperately looking for something to wear to my concert.  as of now i have a skirt, a shirt, and shoes i like, i just don't think they all go together perfectly.  it's like two of the three things go together.  it's very annoying.  i might end up just wearing it anyways unless i find something better.  other than that my weekend has been pretty quiet.  tomorrow i'll probably just hang around here, do some homework, and go to the gym.  because really, what else is there to do?

i tried eating away my troubles tonight (but not really on purpose, i just thought that sounded funny).  i had a chicken sandwhich, chips, salad, three chocolate chip cookies, some mashed potatoes, pasta, and cereal.  and that was just at dinner.  what can i say, sometimes i eat a lot.

i just went through my senior yearbook and got sad.  i guess i might go visit pine view one of these days so i can see hank and ms. cummings.  no one else really cares that much when they see seniors.  it's kind of weird to go back and visit actually.  i don't know, everything is changing there too.  someone today told me that pine view might get security cameras.  that sucks.  it also sucks that pine view is getting stupider by the year.  well i guess stupid is kind of a harsh word.  there are just too many kids.  overpopulation.  then pine view has to lower its standards.  i guess it's not my problem anymore.  i'll always love it though.


i'll stop talking about that now because it's rather depressing.  



i'm watching the oscars with my mom.  i don't really care that much, but i want to see like all of those movies.  sometimes i wish i liked to watch movies.  good thing a lot of good ones are being shown at the slc.  it's rather sad that i haven't been in there yet...

i have no idea why i just said that.  maybe because i was going to say everybody has stopped using livejournal and started using myspace and then paused for a moment to make sure that sentence made sense.


no roommate this weekend.  i feel like its been a while since i've seen her, even though it has only been two days.  i actually like having a roommate and i don't like thinking about how i won't have one next year.  i mean i could get a double, but i don't really feel like living with someone new and i don't know of anyone i do know to live with next year.  but the upside is i can probably get a single with my own bathroom, and that's just awesome.  oh and i'll also be living in the newly-renovated landis, which is the nicest hall on campus.  


i've been sick for like a week.  i'm just starting to get over it.  i guess it was kind of like a head cold or someting.  and it was at its worst on the two coldest days we've had so far: last monday and tuesday.  i believe it was 22 on monday.  that's quite chilly.


oh man, the swiss shut out canada today!  that's crazy.  it's because martin gerber is a really good goaltender.  that just makes me dislike the carolina hurricanes even more.  and sweden beat latvia 6-1.  i'm cheering for the swedes by the way.  they have 5 red wings players and one lightning player, how could i not?  they're playing the u.s. tomorrow at 11.  i hope i'll be up/done with breakfast by then.  i don't think that will happen though because it's already about midnight and i feel like i'm going to sleep a lot.  we'll see though.


goodnight."

"event","yay an update!  life has been pretty good lately.  except for wednesday and thursday.  those days were crazy.  see i had this astronomy exam on thursday that i thought was <i>this</i> thursday.  and i found that out on tuesday.  so i basically spent the whole day wednesday studying.  the test was really hard too.  i didnt do well.  and then, after my thursday classes which basically take up my whole day (9:30-9:30), i had to study for my history test friday morning.  i did that for a little bit, but ended up not doing that much.  that test was ok.  but he asks the most specific questions.  not cool.  but yeah, wednesday was the first time i've really ever studied, like really really studied.  and i was tired afterwards!  so i'll be having no more of that.  i'll still ""study,"" just a different way...or something.  



i've decided that i like the winter olympics a lot more than the summer ones.  mostly because of hockey.  but there are other cool things, like snowboarding and stuff.  speaking of hockey...the red wings are number one in the nhl right now!  that makes me happy.  the lightning are doing pretty well too.  there's this game on the monday of my spring break (the 6th) that i really want to go to.  and they have really good seats at ticketmaster.com.  but they're 115 dollars each.  casey and i want to go shopping at the international mall beforehand and then drive over to the forum that night to watch the game.  that would be a lot of fun.  but thats also a lot of money.  i'll see what my dad says.  that would just be a good day.  i've been really wanting to shop in tampa for a while and i also love hockey, so there you go.



crap this might be a long post.  anyways, i'm sick.  sore throat.  i have no idea where it came from.  i haven't had a sore throat or been sick at all for years.  and it's going to be cold up here for the next few days.  boo on that.  

  

ok i have to say this.  if there's one thing right now that i really really really want to do, it's learn to play hockey.  it sounds stupid i know.  i'm 19 and i live in florida.  i wish i had learned when i was like 5 so now i could be good.  and there's definitely no place around here i could go to learn.  j.p. igloo is a possibility i guess, but thats in ellenton and not for people my age.  and there's no women's thing at fsu.  apparently they're starting up a women's ice hockey club at uf or something.  if that's true, then i'm pissed.  i would SO do that.  i dont know, i just want to try.  if i'm no good, then i'm no good.  or maybe i would be good and it would be a lot of fun.  and it's something different for me to do.  i have no idea, i could go on about this forever, but i won't.  the bottom line is: i want to try, but i don't think it'll ever happen.

"event","so i've been thinking about updating these past few days.  on friday i was going to update on how i smelled like chili's.  or at least start the post that way.  but then i didnt.  and now i really am updating.  i'm actually just wasting a few minutes before i start my homework.  then i'm going to take a break to watch hockey at 8.  i really wish i studied harder.  quite honestly, i really dont study that much at all.  and yet somehow i always get A's and B's.  thats fine, but i'm in college now and some of these classes actually matter.  so yeah, i really need to get going because i think i'm pretty smart its just that i dont know how to apply my smartness to anything important.  so hopefully i'll get things done this week.  i have a chem test wednesday and a calc test thursday and then its home on friday!  too bad i wont get to hang out with shane this weekend.  but i WILL get to see alia and everyone else on saturday.  good times.  



lauren has just recently messed up my part.  and it wont go back to being perfectly straight.  crap.



i really wish it would get cold up here.  its been less-than-pleasant these past few days.  and its almost february.  i dont get it.  i still want an actual winter, even if it bothers my nose and basically eats my face.

"event","so yesterday was my birthday.  i'm officially 19 and i'm on my last year of teenager-hood.  thats crazy.  my birthday was overall pretty good.  it was missing something though.  i'm not sure what that something is.  but whatever, its over now.  at least i found a good italian restaurant to go to.  and at least i stayed up until 2:30 in the morning talking and playing cards with casey and john.  fun times.


i havent updated since sometime over break i think.  classes started last week.  they're going ok i guess.  i hate chemistry though, and the lab that goes with it.  but i'm trying to look past that because i have an awesome professor and a really cool t.a. for the recitation.  i'm also taking history of asia, advances in astronomy and cosmology, calc, and of course band.  the astronomy class might be a bit complicated because i've never taken any astronomy class before.  but it sounded interesting so whatever.  and everything else is good, just a lot of work.  oh man, there are FOUR tenor saxophones in band.  thats a lot compared to what i'm used to.  i actually dont like it.  i could deal with having one other one, but three is just too many for my liking.  i couldnt even hear myself sometimes because the kid next to me was playing so loud.  thats really all he did besides hitting wrong notes.  it made me a little crazy.  



today is the only day off we have all semester besides spring break.  that sucks.  its gone by really fast too.  partially because i woke up at 11.  but i feel like i didnt really do that much today.  i did a little bit of homework and now i'm sitting up in my room by myself watching hockey.  after that i need to do some reading.  and then it will be bed time.

"event","its about time i updated.  happy new year to everyone.  this was the only new years that seemed different to me.  because i guess it was different.  in 2005 i graduated from pine view after being there since 1994.  grades 2-12.  thats really a long time to be at one school.  i loved pine view and still do, even though i think they keep lowering the standards.  overpopulation is not cool.  anyways, i really miss band a lot.  good thing i have a lot of the songs we played on cds.  otherwise i would go crazy.  i miss eating at the same lunch table with the same people for three years.  i miss hank!  and even though i didnt take it in 12th grade, i miss french classes, mostly because alia and i had great times doing crazy skits in french in front of the class.  one thing i DONT miss: the student parking lot.  its nice to be able to have a clean car rather than one with white dust all over it.  having a black car always made that worse.  but back to what i was saying.  i miss the old days too.  like middle school.  and all the people that left after 8th grade to go to sarasota or riverview.  ok that just made me think of a bunch of people to look up on facebook.  and senior year was just...amazing.  the unauthorized ""band trip,"" and the vermonster eating contest and cobalt...just everything.  it seems so weird that half a year ago i was a T.A. for dutterer's class and vice president of z-club.  it feels like a whole different life.  and now the other big part of 2005...going to college.  i'm not really sure i can say that college has changed me, and i think thats a good thing.  but i've met a lot of good people.  and some not-so-good people.  and some amazing people.  i think maybe i've become more open about stuff.  i'm not sure if that makes sense.  but i'm really a pretty private person.  and not having my own space has made me less private.  something like that.  but i'm generally pretty happy when i'm up there, though i do miss my cats and my parents and my house a lot.  i think i lost track of what i was saying because i was just on the phone twice.  me and casey are meeting alia for breakfast at 8:30.  thats like 2 hours earlier than i've woken up this whole break.  yeah usually, 8:30 wouldnt be a problem.  but apparently my sleeping habits have changed.  so thats that.  



i got a black ipod yesterday!  its really cool.  and also, the windows on my car are now nice and tinted.  and i'm about to have an early birthday cake with my mom and sister.

"event","that was the craziest football game i have ever watched.  the bucs just beat the falcons 27-24 with 15 seconds left in OVERTIME.  the overtime quarter was insane.  we fumbled the kickoff, blocked their field goal, missed a really short field goal, they punted, we punted, they punted again, and then FINALLY matt bryant hit a 41-yard field goal to win.  seriously, i was depressed one minute, then really happy the next.  back and forth.  it took nearly 75 minutes for someone to come out with the win.  good thing it was us.


also, last night the red wings beat the blackhawks 3-2.  thats crazy because it was 2-0 blackhawks with 37 seconds left in the game.  then they scored twice.  and it went to overtime.  then datsyuk scored with one second left in overtime.  craziness all around.

"event","these past couple of days have been awesome.  friday night i went to frankie's for dinner with alia, ashley, and sami.  good times with 20 questions.  ""does it have a purpose?""  i'll leave friday at that.  then saturday i saw walk the line with my sister and mom.  then that night was the hockey game!  holy crap, we were so close to the ice.  it was AWESOME and really fun.  the game was really good too.  the lightning would score, then the wings, then the lightning again, and they kept going back and forth until the third period when the red wings scored 3 times and the lightning didnt score at all.  so the final score ended up being 6-3.  what a great night that was.  and probably a third of the fans were wings fans, so i certainly wasnt alone in cheering when they scored.  and i saw nicklas lidstrom!  not like up close or anything, but you know, i was in the same building he was in.  he is SO cool.  its really hard to get across how much fun i had.  oh, except for the drive back.  i found my way to the crosstown expressway going east, but then i got off at an exit by mistake.  no big deal right?  we were in brandon and i've been in brandon before...like once...when i was younger.  so yeah, i had NO idea where i was going, and had NO idea how to get back to the crosstown or to 75.  so we drove around for a while until i decided we were officially lost and that we should ask for directions.  so casey, nathan, and i went to a gas station and this lady tried to tell us how to get back to the crosstown.  except she left out something important because we ended up in the parking lot of the brandon mall.  so that was great fun.  i was getting pretty flustered after that but i kept driving around.  and then casey saved the day by spotting a sign for I-75.  so good job casey.  and we got home...at 12:30, a <i>little</i> later than expected.  then yesterday was steve's eagle scout thing.  that was cool.  i got to see a lot of people and eat some good cake.  sunday night we went to thailand for dinner.  pretty good, but not as good as siam orchid of course.  today was pretty quiet.  some shopping, lots of hockey played.  i've spent the past four nights without my retainer.  its depressing that i keep thinking about it.  


moving on...we can see our grades tomorrow.  the only one i'm nervous about is history.  OH!  that reminds me.  i got an 87 on my meteorology exam.  SWEET!  and consequently a B in the class.  that is AMAZING.  apparently the class average for the final was a 51.  so he added like 23 points.  seeing that made me really happy for obvious reasons.

i'm thinking i'm going to read almost my whole meteorology book over the break so that i can get a B in the class.  on the second test, i missed 43% of the questions.  thats just really bad.  so thats a priority.  also i need to remember to bring moulin rouge up here and possibly some other dvds.



i guess thats it.  happy friday!"

"event","i hate work!  i have so much of it.  and a large portion of it is for my meteorology lab class and its due tuesday!  but then after that i get to leave!  sweet.  so i just have to stop being so lazy and do my work.  sounds like a plan.  a plan that will hopefully work.


moving away from that...people are visiting me this weekend!  alia and berenger are coming on saturday which will be AWESOME and then nicole is coming up here on friday which is also awesome.  so yes it will be quite a weekend.  i'll have more excuses to not do work.  i guess thats why i should start tonight.  i might just do that.


i'm going to grad nite with nathan in may.  hopefully i'll be able to get the forms to him by monday.  yeah we definitely weren't allowed to bring people last year whats up with that?  but whatever, it'll be fun.  except i know NO ONE from booker high.  oh wait yes i do.  but very few.  and by very few i mean like 3, and one of them is nathan.


muffin has a UTI.  i'm sad, but at least she doesnt have a kidney infection like the vet thought.  i cant wait to see my cats!

"event","what a crazy day yesterday was.  in terms of football that is.  the bucs game was insane.  36-35.  we won of course, though i was worried for a while.  so yay for chris simms playing well!  i'm glad he didnt let all the criticism get to him.  


booo the red wings lost last night.  but hey they've only lost 3 games and one other in overtime and won 15, so that pretty much rules.  yeah we're number one in the nhl right now.  the lightning aren't doing as well.  they just dont have a consistent goalie.  but its fun because i watch a game basically every night.  like right now.



my weekend was pretty good.  lizzi was away so it was pretty quiet in my room.  but casey and i went to the gym and got breakfast and went shopping on saturday, so it wasnt too bad.  it was really nice sleeping in on friday instead of waking up to go to english.  i cant wait until next tuesday because that means i'm coming home!  and alia is coming saturday!  that pretty much rules.  


now i have nothing else to say."

"event","i finally made up my mind!  i'm not coming this weekend.  i'll be coming on tuesday the 22nd.  that should be a nice visit.  and i cant wait until winter break and my birthday and my hockey games.  i feel like this semester has gone by really quickly.  i dont know its weird to me that its already november.  i notice that i'm really stressed a lot of the time.  its really mostly my own fault i think.  i worry about my grades sometimes, but then i dont study enough.  i mean i've never really had to study that much to get good grades.  but i'm in college now, in the honors program which is a big thing.  but it doesnt really seem like a big deal because i went to pine view.  i dont know, its like everyone expects for you to be in the honors program so it doesnt seem like anything special.  but it kind of is and you have to keep a 3.20 to stay, which i have always had, but its like i'm not trying hard enough to get A's.  like i definitely will have an A in english (ironically) and calc and my meteorology lab.  but history will probably be a B and meteorology could well be a C.  i mean i'm not sure, but i got a 66 and 78 on the two tests we've had.  and i really dont like that i might get a C in a class i'm supposed to be really interested in.  i just dont understand myself sometimes.  maybe i'm also frustrated because i dont have enough fun things to do up here.  and i havent met that many new people.  i mean yeah i've met people, but like all i know is their name.  but i'm not outgoing enough.  or something.  or its like the people i am sort of friends with are just friends of a friend and not necessarily my friend, if that makes sense.  whatever, i'll get over it.  



i've realized that i like agatha christie books.  or at least the 80 pages i've read of one of her books.  i'm also very full from pizza and pokey sticks.  but tomorrow is thursday which means waking up when i want (which is 9), breakfast, and band.  not that that sentence had anything to do with being full.  anyways, thursdays always know how to cheer me up.  not that i'm really sad.  i'm just in a thinking mood.  or i guess pensive would be a better word.


i miss alia.  and z-club people.  and the band kids."

"event","crap theres a damn ""water outage"" for gilchrist right now.  what the heck???  what if i have to pee like i always do???  damn.  i just walked over to williams because i'm afraid of flushing our toilet.  maybe this is a sign that i should have gone home this weekend.  but probably not.  i THINK i'm coming home next weekend.  if i dont, then it wont be until thanksgiving.  the reading festival is tomorrow.  i'll be missing that for the first time.  that makes me sad.  man why do i have to be 5 hours away from srq?  its not that long i guess, but its so tiring and boring, even with casey in the car.


enough about that.  band yesterday was bad for me.  like i just didnt play well.  i was very out of tune and i could hear it but nothing i tried to do worked.  and i know my solo sounded bad.  but its definitely been better every other time, so hopefully i'll recover next week.  there was also this extremely annoying alto kid who sat next to me.  he was being very rude and disrespectful and i really just wanted to punch him.  i probably should have.  yeah then i came home tired and cranky, trying to decide when to come home.  except i didnt go to bed until after 1.  well i didnt fall asleep until then at least.  then i had to wake up and go to that stupid english class and then it was my history test.  which i dont feel good about.  i feel like i studied a lot of things that werent on the test.  i hate that.

on a lighter note, lizzi and i are totally going to win the door decorating contest because 502 obviously rules and we were one of like three doors that actually decorated.  and ours was just better.  so there.



i also have to finish writing my part of our english essay and write a journal.  YES!  i love that class so much.  i really really do.  except not.  i cant wait until i dont have to take english anymore.  that'll be next semester.  score.



kudos to chris osgood for his first start and win for the red wings.

"event","woo hoo go noles!  guess who went to the game?  thats right, i did because lizzi is awesome and gave me her extra ticket.  we had a little trouble actually getting the tickets, but it was worth it.  i should have worn my clown shoes though.  and/or brought a jacket because i was cold by the second quarter.  but yeah it was a good homecoming game.  yesterday we went to see the parade.  that was mildly interesting, nothing too impressive.  but yeah this was really my first real homecoming.  we certainly cant call last year's flag football game homecoming.  so yay for fsu.  and i'm actually glad the gators won because they beat #4 georgia and that can only be good news for us.


right now i'm watching the lightning game on tv (i put it on mute) and i'm listening to the detroit game on my computer.  its complicated but extra-exciting.  i seriously cant wait until december 17th.  i'll probably have multiple anneurisms and lose my voice.  but it'll be worth it.   


i sure hope chris simms plays well tomorrow.  



before i forget and end this post, i would just like to declare my love for the marching chiefs.  seriously, i should have joined.  like the only reason i didnt was because its so damn hot and when its hot i just shut down.  i guess also because its extremely time-consuming.  but i really wish i had joined, because they're just so cool.  maybe i can and will next year.  



yay for hockey and football!"

calc test tomorrow!  hopefully i'll own it like i did last time.


yay the red wings CRUSHED the blue jackets tonight 6-2!  woo hoo tonight was the first time i've seen them play since like a year and a half ago.  and hey i get to see them play in person on december 17th.  i'm very excited as you should know.



what else...oh yeah.  i'm coming home again either wednesday the 9th, or thursday the 19th and leaving on sunday the 13th (of november, obviously).  it all depends on whether or not i can convince casey to skip classes on thursday.  sadly, its not working.  but hey when thanksgiving comes, i might just be coming tuesday after my lab which ends at 10:45.  that would certainly be nice.  we'll have to see.


have a nice week everyone."

band tomorrow!  apparently we have only five rehearsals left until the concert.  i wish we met more than once a week.  whatever, i'm excited.


what would you say if i said that i wanted to chase hurricanes?  i've never really known exactly what i want to do with meteorology and i'm not really sure if chasing hurricanes is an actual career.  but it would be cool.

"event","this past weekend was good.  i love being home and i hate leaving.  the bucs game sunday RULED.  it was very fun, except casey and i had a hard time getting to lot 3 with all the stupid traffic.  we left there a little after three, then proceeded to get on 275 SOUTH instead of north so that was a little confusing.  and of course there are one way streets EVERYWHERE, but luckily i spotted the 275 north sign and we didnt waste too much time.  by the way, i hate I-10.  a lot.  you've been driving on 75 for a while and then when you get to I-10 you're like yay we're almost there!  OH WAIT, TALLAHASSEE IS 90 MILES AWAY STILL.  so yeah thats a good hour and 15 minutes depending on how fast you go.  damn it i hate that.  whatever, we got in sometime after 8 last night then went to publix because i just couldnt do without my bananas.  then of course i had to do homework for that stupid class (you know the one i'm talking about) and went to bed at around midnight, obviously later than i wanted to.  then i took a stupid nap today.  i hate those.  whatever.  now i'm sitting up here by myself thinking about doing work or something.  i dont know, i'm in an unhappy mood right now.  i think i just miss srq.  and my cats.

"event","i hate english.  i like how the first draft of our 6-8 page paper is due monday and all four of us are going home this weekend.  that was half sarcastic because i really do want to go home but that just means we have to write our paper today and tomorrow.  thats not going to happen, mark my words.  i feel like i have so much to do before i get to go home.  like that paper!  and also a journal.  and also a thing for history which is really easy.  i'm excited that tomorrow is thursday and i can sleep in, go get breakfast, and THEN make my way to calc.  and then friday i'll go to english (against my will, really) and go to history to turn in my assignment then leave and skip that class and met1010.  casey will probably get out of italian early because they have a test, so i plan on leaving directly after that.  i should be in srq a little after 2.  then i have an eye appointment at 4.  i dont think i mentioned this, but i need glasses.  desperately.  my poor eyes.  staring at the computer a lot doesnt help.  hopefully i'll look good in them.  


ahh i have to take CHEMISTRY next semester.  WHY???  i learned NOTHING from rostron's class.  except that i'm bad at chemistry.  i'm not too happy about that.  but i'm also taking weathercasting, history of asia, calc, advances in astronomy and cosmology, and of course band.  i love band.  and skip.


i really hope we get to the greek alphabet for hurricanes.  that would be awesome.  i think we will.  in fact, i think we'll get a few letters into it.  not too many, but a few.

what else...i got an 82 on my history exam!  thats higher than most of the grades i got in mccracken's class!  HA!



i hate english so much.  stupid group paper.  who does those??  not me apparently.  but i have to say, night of the living dead (from 1968) is a good movie.  its also hilarious.



oh i went to the fsu game on saturday with lizzi and her parents.  that was really fun but REALLY hot.  i have an amazing farmer's tan.  and my face got really burnt, as well as my right arm.  yeah and we're 5-0 now.  not many teams can say that.  especially not the gators.



i'm coming home this weekend.  BE EXCITED.  i know i am.  but i have like no time to do anything because i'm going to the bucs game on sunday and that basically takes up the whole day.  but it'll be good to be home and see my cats!  and my mom and dad.  and EPICURE and COSIMO'S.  i have been craving spinach ravioli for a looooong time.  so i'm going there.  not matter what.

"event","hmm i havent updated in a while.  but really, what is there to talk about?  yeah ok college i guess.  but thats it really.  i had my first calc test today.  it was fairly easy, especially because i should be in calc II.  and i have my first meteorology test tomorrow.  that too should be easy.  and i dont have english wednesday or friday!  i am immensely pleased at the thought of sleeping in an extra hour.


dude, my calc teacher = dr. rostron
ok a canadian version of dr. rostron.  he's like a GENIUS.  but he cant teach so well.  he mumbles all the time too.  its crazy.  he even LOOKS like rostron.  insane.


oh and band!  its awesome.  i have to say i love it.  i'm still the only tenor sax (go figure), but there are like 15 altos.  and a bazillion trumpets.  no really, like 20.  and many clarinets and flutes too.  and 8 or 9 tubas!  and trombones!  and the other day, tis a gift was in our folders.  we've been sight-reading differerent things every week, so hopefully this week we'll play that.  i love that song, but we never had the right instrumentation for it.  and last thursday, the conductor himself (there are two grad student conductors) told me that i played really well!  thats awesome.  it made me feel good.  


haha somehow fsu is 3-0 but hey, that works.  i really need to go get my student coupons so i can go to some games.

and the bucs, hey they started 3-0 too.  thats sweet.  AND i have 6 tickets to the december 17th hockey game lightning vs. RED WINGS.  yeah i definitely did not mean to get 6, but whatever.  i also spent WAY too much money on tickets.


so basically, life is good.  i just miss my cats and my piano a lot.  i did get to play one on saturday, but it was pretty crappy.  whatever.  i bought an illegal toaster oven on sunday.  so now me and my awesome roommate get to use it.  by the way, lizzi = awesome, if you didnt get that from the previous sentence.

damn right.


last night was LAGUNA!!!!!! OMG!!!    

oh wait, i hate that show.

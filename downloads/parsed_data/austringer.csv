"event","So I go to the store yesterday to get some veggies. I turrn the corner and what do I spy with my little eye? Valentines merchandise. WHAT THE HELL!!! It's bad enough to put Christmas stuff up just after Holloween but come on. Are they going to be doing this for every holiday? Might as well put up the Easter paraphanalia. Don't want to be late with that. And the fourth of july. That's coming up real soon. It's no wonder people say they don't have time to do things. The economic environment won't let a person enjoy what they do have for a long enough time to make a person feel like they have accomplished something. I have to go home now. 

Love, Peace, Drum Grease."

I have been reading the DUNE books. I'm almost halfway through the last book. I found that if I think about the implications of the theories in the book, I think my head would totally pop right off. I'm just going to be at a loss as to what to read next.
I think that's all I will dare say for now."

"event","I think I'm getting sick. I feel like poop and my nose is stuffy. My throat is sore and those fucking people keep going outside to have their 25th smoke break for the day. 

So my upstairs neighbors are driving my girlfriend nuts. They don't walk aroung their apartment, they stomp, It's like the major mode of transportation for the country they came from was a fucking pogo stick and they are wtill usuing it to remind them of home. I want them to die.

Now that I think about it I want a lot of people to die.

I've decided to not fix anymore of my typing mistakes for the rest of this entry.

I think I'm going to stay home tonight instead of giing to te the monday night drum circle that I sort of sponsered. I need to get my strienth up for tomorrows festivities. which consist of more drumming. I need to join a band and staert to get paid for this shit. I 'm doing tooo much and putting too much time into it without getting paid for it. I havd a paying gig last Thursday. that gfelt gookd . I made 20 bucks an hour that night.

"event","I have to move out by the end of November. I don't have the fundage to do this by myself. My girlfriend doesn'r have a job as of yet but is at least willing to get one, unlike my ex-wife. But my buddy wants to move out as well. But he said that he would not be ready till the end of December before he could move out. Here lies the problem. I don't make enough money by myself to afford a place on my own. I hear that the only kind of raise that I will get will be a quarter. I think that kind of sucks. But I like working here. I know a lot about how this place works and the people here are pretty cool. The upper managment is like all upper managments. But my coworkers are the best.

Like just now, one of the guys won the weekly football pool and bought us all KFC. That kind of thing rocks! Don't get me wrong though, if I get a call or oppertunity to make money doing something musical, I'm out of here. I answered an add in the Bay Guardian for a  
Percussionist/Drummer - wanted for Azigza. High level Trance-Rock-World-Fusion. CD out, important gigs coming. Complex music, orchestrated percussionsection in band with violin, guitar, bass, voice and Arabic/AAfrican/Indian percussion and trap. Professionalism SERIOUS CALLS ONLY
I think I could do this. Everyone that I have played with says that I'm really good but good enough to join a band doing it? The only thing I could do is try and see what comes of it. I already left a voice mail I think I'll leave another tonight. 

Wish me luck."

Booda you soooooo have to come to work here. I'm fucking bored out of my mind. I can't even take a lunch. Sorry for whining. I'll get better.


I went appartment shopping yesterday. Well not really. I shagged my girlfriend till about 3 in the afternoon. Then we went to an apartment house that I wanted to look at. Weird thing was, the manager was the same as the appartment that I last rented about 4 years ago. she was a total hard ass  I don't think I will rent from there. The rent was $1400 for a two bedroom. My friends Ed and Sara just moved into a two bedroom that's only nine hundred something a month. But they had to pay a $900 security deposit. But they allow pets and don't need a pet deposit. I don't know what I'm gonna do."

"event","So my good buddy Booda gave me this clock radio when his employment at this office was terminated. In his cube it was pretty cool. He was able to get some good rock stations and a funk/soul station. But since moving into my cube, all I can get is the local valley station, (which play crap like the Backside Boys, and Celine Dion), the Mexican station (nothing but mexican polka), a rap station that's not even very good, and the oldies from the 60's and 70's. All I want is Live 105, KSJO, or the Bone. Some one asked me once why the stuff you want to listen to is staticy and hard to hear but Barry Manalo has a satilite right over your radio at all times? I have another ponderance. Why is easy listening so hard to listen to? Does John Tesh actually think he has any talent? Okay now and then the sucky valley station plays something good. Right now I have U2- With or Without You. I like this one. But I bet you they will play something from the 98syncboys next. There needs to be another musical revolution. Remember when Hard Rock was becoming a parody of itself (much like Aerosmith is now) then Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Sound Garden came out? It was still hard and edgy but they didn't look like circus freaks (motly crue). We need that again. Look at the music that is out now. Papa Roach sucks. Green Day sucks. Limp Bizcit really sucks. Most of the bands out there now sound like each other or at least try to sound like another band that is older than it. (Creed = Stone Temple Pilots) (GodSmack = Alice n Chains). We need uniqueness. But the bands that are unique, Primus, Tool, Ozomatli, and Soul Coughing don't get radio play. Instead we get force fed Britney ""No Soul"" Spears, Bloodhound Gang, N' ""sold our soull to the devil"" Sync and some bitch by the name of Cisco. Even Ben Harper is starting to suck. WE NEED A REVOLUTION!!!    ---end transmission---"

"event","Well I talked to my boss today and we will talk about my transfer to the Washington office. As I said earlier, I want to get out of California. It is just too damned expensive to live here anymore. I've been wanting to move up there and I made a kind of joking remark to one of the ladies that works in the Kent office that I would like to work up there. Well she is all for it and started talking to the supervisor of that office and my boss. All with my permission mind you. So tomorrow at 3 I have a meeting with my boss about going up there. hopfully this will work out good. I still have to get the divorce papers together and signed before I go up there though. Living a life of crazy decisions is not all that bad really. :)"

So we had a new guy drop into the drum circle last night. He had this uber-cool snare drum that was about two inches thick and sat on his lap. I never seen anything like that before. He's going to come check out my gig tonight at the cafe and then join us at the Pub after the gig for more playing. I love Tuesdays. I'm going to do something musical for about 4 hours tonight. My hands may hurt tomorrow but it's fine by me. If there is anyone out there reading this who would like to have a percussionist added to their band, email me. I'm in the East San Fransisco bay area. I play hand drums : Congas, Dombek, shakers, Tabla (sort of) I also play bass. Actually I'll be willing to relocate to another town out of state to play with a good band or artist. 

But I digress....One of my coworkers is with child. She knows it is going to be a girl because they did an amneo (sp?). I gave her the idea to name it Isabella. And she liked it  So there will be a person running around this world going by a name that I thought up. I think that is one of the coolest things in the world."

"event","So I want to move out of California. I was thinking of going north to the rainforests of Washington. You see the valley that I Live in is a black hole that sucks other people into it and doesn't let those who were born here leave. I plan on being one of the few that will make it out though. As God as my witness.
 The only thing that I would miss is my mothers cooking. But i could always have her tamales express mailed to me. I'm lucky to have a terrific girlfriend who can cook like mad. And she loves me enough to make things that is good for me.
 She was a belly dancer for a number of years and can learn moves from a book easier than I can. So she has been reading my book on Qi Gong, the chinese breathing and movements that help develope qi (chi) in the body, and has been teaching it too me. We both love it."

"event","Well, it's monday. Columbus day. John Lennons Birthday. He would have been 60 today. Five bullets and not one hit Yoko. What the hell?! 

I still don't know what I'm going to do for a Holloween costume. I usually play a couple of gigs on Tuesdays. One with a Friend who plays Guitar and writes the songs. So I do a two hout gig with him, then I go to a pub and play for another two hours. So if I have a costume it will have to be easily shedable or something I can sweat in. By the way, I play hand drums. Congas, Djimbe, dumbek, and other percusion instruments. I have a middle eastern costume that I could wear. I think I'll do that.

I think that's all I have to say for now. Hope your Monday doesn't suck."

"event","So this being this first entry, let me start by saying thanks to Booda for showing me this cool corner of the web. Funny thing is, the day before I heard about this program my girlfriend asked why I don't keep a journal or note book. Warning: If something you read sounds like the insane ramblings of a crazed lunatic, it is. I have never had a journel before so things might not translate well from my head to the page. For that I am sorry. Here we go.


I'm really excited about this weekend. I'm going to another scottish games. That isn't the cool part though. I will be helping George with his booth. That is the cool part. I will be talking to the general public about Raptors; Hawks, Eagles, Owls, and Falcons. I'll get to hold Shilo again. Shilo being a tiercel (which means male) Harris Hawk. And hopefully Hootence will not try to take my finger off again. Hootence being a very agro Great Horned Owl.
So the trick will be to drive all the way to Ben Lomond from Livermore without getting pulled over by the police. You see I'm very stupid when it comes to my car and all things that have to do with it. My Registration is expired (since March) and my Licence just expired as well. But I technically have insurance. Unless they caneled that do to nonpayment. Like I said, I'm totally stupid when it comes to my car. 

I think that's all I have to say right now."

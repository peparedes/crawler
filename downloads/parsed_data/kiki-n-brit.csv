"event","<P><FONT color=#33ccff>No longer can I hide the feelings that&nbsp;I feel, because the pain I feel now has&nbsp;become too&nbsp;real. I messed up once, I won't do it again... I want you as so much more than a friend. I can't bear to look at you, and not want to burst into tears. Because your face becomes a reminder that&nbsp;my love was hindered by&nbsp;my fears. I did the one thing I try so hard not to do. Only problem is&nbsp;I'm not the only one hurt, now&nbsp;I've hurt&nbsp;you too. I cannot take back&nbsp;what I did&nbsp;or said, or&nbsp;make you just forget. But every waking moment I live is now&nbsp;spent in&nbsp;regret. I never knew just what I had,&nbsp;so what they say is true. I wish I'd been a better girlfriend, but&nbsp;I never gave up on you.&nbsp;I gave up on myself everytime&nbsp;I kept it all inside. I didn't know how to tell you you hurt me, because&nbsp;I held&nbsp;my head too high. My redeemer of strength, my friend who&nbsp;I called pride... is now the cause of all the pain I feel so deep inside. I don't know how to make it up, or even if I can. The only thing&nbsp;I know for sure is I'd die just to hold your hand. I'd walk a thousand shores of ice, to heal your broken heart, but saying I'm sorry is the only way&nbsp;I know to start. Today I cried, just like the other&nbsp;nights before...but today it was different;&nbsp;I cried so hard...where I was, I wasn't sure. I didn't know where&nbsp;I was coming from, or where&nbsp;I was to be going. And finally I realized that my true felings for&nbsp;you&nbsp;were showing. I can't make it in this life without you, I can state that as a fact. And if to you&nbsp;I am just a friend, around you&nbsp;I won't know how to act. I wake up at night with the taste of your name in my mouth...It's just another sign of how much&nbsp;I need you without a doubt. If you give me this chance, I swear to God I'll&nbsp;try to make it better. But if not, just know how hard&nbsp;I tried to express my love in this letter.</FONT></P>"

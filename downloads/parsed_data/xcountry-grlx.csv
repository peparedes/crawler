"event","alright so..... me and josh have been fighting WAAAY too much.  we ""removed the title"" on Tuesday this week and i printed out the conversation for Cara to read so she would be able to see both sides of the arguement and know what was going on from him and me.  well... Josh found out and got all pissed off at me over it.  he called me up and was yelling at me for a little bit then hung up on me (this is on wednesday by the way and Cara had ridden the bus home with me) so i was getting all upset b/c i didnt understand why he was getting so upset over it, i mean i was able to see where he might get mad about it but not as mad as he was.  i apologized for it and told him i would take it back if i could but that wasnt possible.  and he kept bringing it up and getting pissed and not letting it go and i started crying on the phone with him wednesday night so he told me it was all ok and he wasnt mad at me anymore and not to cry or lose any sleep about it.  so i figured everything was ok and went to sleep and figured it was all good... well the next day he wouldnt talk to me.  i IMed him and tried calling him and he wouldnt answer me... till later thursday night (Cara was over again) and he responded and was slamming everything in my face and making me feel like shit.  he told me he needed a couple days to sort all the shit out and i was like fine.  i cried my fucking eyes out that night and talked to Cara about alot of shit.  i told her about how i felt like i had lost so many friends in just the past 6 months.  things got fucked up with me and Chris, Meghan, Josh(at that moment), Kyle, and Jackie and Savvy (i mean were still ok but were not as close as we were)... after i was about cried out and still a little emotional, Zack called me and was like yall wanna go for a walk with me? so me and Cara went walking with Zack up to Stonestreet and smoked a little up there and talked about the whole thing.  Zack helped me come to the conclusion that i didnt want to or need to be with Josh at all.  he made it clear that this entire thing was rediculous and if he was getting this upset over this petty of shit that he wasnt worth my time and any girl should say fuck it to a college guy who starts this much drama, but im not the kinda of person who just quits on people.  i had decided that i still wanted to be able to talk to Josh and be friends but i wasnt gonna get too upset if things didnt work out that way and i sure as hell didnt wanna be a couple b/c it just caused way too much drama......
.....but yeah that was all on thursday night and early, early friday morning... on friday morning me and cara woke up and hung out for a little while then me and my dad took Cara home b/c Sean was coming over to see her and her parents were out of town ;) lol.  then i went up to the fish fry with my family and ate there then went with Jessi to the Bull Dog Cafe to see Chris' band play up there.  i saw Justin and like everybody else up there.  i talked to Chris' mom and Chris tried to talk to me but i turned him down b/c i didnt know what to say to him and was shocked that he had the balls to say anything to me.  i smoked a whole lot that night and got to see Jessi's friend Steven again for like the first time in over a year and we sorta clicked.  he was messing with me most of the night (and of course i didnt mind b/c things with Josh were shit at the moment and even if he wanted things to go back to the way they had been that i wasnt gonna have it.) he asked me for my number and of course i gave it to him and he called me at like 2 am that morning (i didnt answer b/c i was fast asleep and wasnt quite aware of what was going on) but yeah me and Steven have been talking for the past few days, i dont know if its like ""talking"" talking but were at least talking  lol.....
.....so Saturday... i didnt do shit.  i had the ingenious idea that i had been an idiot the night before when i ignored chris trying to talk to me.  i had bitched about how i hated him blowing me off and acting like he didnt give a shit about me then when he says something to me i just sorta froze and couldnt respond.  so Saturday i wrote him a message on myspace saying that i was sorry about the night before and pretty much everything i just said.  he actually wrote me back too!  he said it was all ok and that he was glad i liked the show and yeah.  then i wrote him back and i havent heard back from him yet but were making some progress.  Justin should be proud  lol.....
.....Sunday... i talked to Josh for a few minutes on the internet and then he started yelling at me about shit so i started yelling back and told him i was done fighting with him and that i felt like he didnt give a shit and i was just done with it.  then i said i was leaving b/c i needed to go walk and cool off some.  he calls me a little while later and was like ""meet me up at stonestreet"" i was like why, so he says i wanna talk about this. and i said fine im out walking anyways and met him up at stonestreet.  i got up there and we sat there in awkward silence for a few minutes while he finished off a cigarette then we talked about shit.  he apologized and was talking about how he wanted to make things work b/t us and that he cared about me and all this stuff. i told him i was done with fighting and i hated that he blamed me for everything and he had made me feel like shit the entire past week and i didnt want that anymore.  he kept trying to get me to say that i still wanted to be with him, but i couldnt honestly say i did.  he told me that he still had feelings for me and that he was willing to go to extremes to make it work.  i asked him""if you are willing to go to extremes then will you do something for me?"" he was yeah and i told him i wanted to see how things worked with us being just friends and that i felt we would fight less that way.  he said ok and asked if we were ok as just friends and i said yeah so we talked about some shit and i went to go home and run with Zack, but didnt get to b/c he had gone without me b/c he got sick of waiting.  so yeah me and Josh are just friends, me and Steven are talking, me and Daniel are sposed to do something next weekend, and me and kyle are still not talking [but hell i got better things to do ;) lmao life goes the hell on and i like it that way]  i am out!"

"event","ok so Friday night i smoked pot for the very first time ever.  it didnt really have an affect on me though which sucked b/c cara sean and josh were all being stupid and having fun and i was left out. :( . but then that night cara stayed the night with me and in the middle of the night i woke up and i would swear josh and sean were in my room with us but i couldnt find josh.  so i got out of bed and saw cara lying on the floor, i knelt by her and realized that she was not josh so i went to get a drink b/c my mouth was dry as fuck.  then i came back in my room looked around for josh, said fuck it and went back to sleep.  lol.....
.....Satuday i went with Cara and Sean up to KFC and we all got the same thing: honey BBQ boneless chicken wings, mMm.  and we planned how were gonna go underwear shopping again and Josh gets to come along this time.  lol  (last time we went it was me cara and sean and me and josh had only just started goin out and hadnt even seen each other since we had started going out so it would have been a little awkward lol)  but yeah  after we ate we went up to stonestreet and met up with Josh a little while later.  we hung out at stonestreet till about 8 or so then josh decided we were gonna go see Annapolis.  we went up to cinema 16 and the next showing was at 950 so we went over to Dixie Dozen and they werent even showing it! so we just called cara and sean and told them to meet us up at Iroquios Park for the usual and actually a little more than usual for me O:) .....
.....Sunday i got up went to church and realized how scared i was that me and josh were taking everything WAY too fast.  i mean weve only been goin out for 3 weeks now and weve already done more than i have done with any of my ex's even the ones i went out with for 3 months *cough* CHRiS *cough* i talked to Cara about it after church and she told me the same thing i had been telling myself, that i had to be straight forward about it and tell him if he tried anything.  a little later i talked to Brian about it and he told me that all i had to say was ""no"" and pretty much that if he didnt understand that then hes not worth it...i went to the movies with Josh at 240 to go see Annapolis (finally  lol) and it was REAllY GOOD!  i twisted my ankle on my way out of the theater though and it hurt really bad, its swollen like a bitch today and hurts pretty bad. well after the movie we went back over to Stonestreet to spend a little while together before he had to leave and i had to go to my Guatemala meeting that i thought was at 7... well around 515 we got a txt from sean saying that josh had to get me to st mikes ""NOW"" and i got totally stressed out about the whole thing and was like freaking out on my dad when i came home, it had turned out that my meeting was at 5 and i didnt even leave for it till 530 and it takes like half an hour to get out there!  i was totally stressed out.  so yeah i got there around 6 and Justin Lewis was there!  i love that guy  hes the greatest!  he was one of Chris' friends that i hung around with every-so-often when me and chris were together and i hadnt seen him in a really long time. i didnt think he liked me too much but he seemed pretty excited to see me and gave me an enthusiastic hug and was asking me about how the guy situation since chris.  i told him i had found somebody else and that chris was a dusche and he agreed! lmao after the meeting he gave me a ride home and we had a nice long conversation on the way, it was awesome getting to talk to him like that cuz hes just such an awesome guy.  lol  so yeah him and Jimmy (yet another totally cool one of Chris' old friends that i hung around with every-so-often) are going to Guatemala with us!  this should be awesom!  im so excited!!!... so after i came home from Guatemala meeting i had the house to myself till like 10 and i was pretty pleased b/c i lOVE being home alone.  then my mom got home from AZ and everybody went to bed...except me b/c i stayed up and talked on the computer till midnight like the genius i am.  lol
..... everythings going great today.  well except that my short story is due on thursday, and im not even halfway done, were starting on research papers, i have to memorize some shit for mrs merimee (BiTCH!), and i have to be reading my Gatsby book.  i HATE SCHOOl!!!  FUCKiNG HATE iT!  seriously i wish i could just drop out.  id be fine just working at Jani-King the rest of my life, my mom does just great with it.  but yeah, other than school, i came home and took a short nap then got on here and talked to Josh and Brian for a while then went and ate dinner (tacos lol) and here i am....."

Josh had to go home to pack b/c he leaves to go back to skool this morning. :( hes only gonna be gone till friday though, then hes coming back and were gonna go see Annapolis and go to Iroquios Park.  lol  well i gotta go to skool now (damnit!)"

"event","ok .....  so this past almost 2 weeks have been ggreat!  me and josh started goin out last monday and its been great!  hes a really great guy, i mean i have my doubts sometimes but he always proves me to be wrong and i love it! (how often do i like being wrong?  lol)  we got in our first fight yesterday (if you could even call it a fight, it was more a passionate arguement  lol)  it was stupid but everything got worked out and went to Wicks and then to Iroquios Park of course.  lol.....
..... me and Cara made this bet yesterday to see who could go the longest without kissing our boyfriends and kept on mouthing ""im gonna win!"" to each other and we didnt tell either of the guys.  finally Sean got all pissed off and shit so Cara told him.  it was really lame  and he was getting pissed off at Cara saying that she didnt even care that he was mad when we couldnt even tell if he was mad or not b/c every fucking time we would ask him if they were mad he would laugh!  kinda makes ya look not-so-mad. huh? but yeah  it was really lame.  i mean i love Sean to death but he can be SOOO dramatic sometimes and it bothers me!!!.....
well today was That 70s Shows Day at skool and i got to wear my hippie skirt and shirt!!!  i was SOOO happy!  (i love my hippie outfit!)  i got hit on by this Senioor too!!!  me and Rachel were walking to lunch and he looked at me and goes ""ooh id like to bring back the 70s with you baby!""  LMFAO  it was great!  i love when guys use cheesy pick up lines like that. its hilarious! and ya gotta give them credit for having the guts to say them.  ya kno?  but anywho.....
..... i think thats about it  lol"

(Sean did not get any by the way  lol)  and we all went to J-mall and wandered around for a while.  then we went to Wal-Mart and sat in the parking lot for a while.  Sean and Cara in Seans car and me and Josh in his truck... me and Josh shared our first kiss in the wal-mart parking lot listening to Nickelback's Animal.  LMAO  it was pretty cool.  then we all went inside after a while and wandered around in the CD/DVD/VHS section at Wal-mart and really just stood around till they were closing and Cara had to go home so we left and we went our seperate ways, Sean took Cara home and Josh took me home. then i took a bath and went to bed.....
.....so today i woke up at like 1 and got on the computer.  then Cara called me on Seans phone and they came and got me and we went to BW3s, which was really good.  i came home after b/c i was sposed to go running with Bessy but she had to go to work at like 6 this morning and got off at 230 so she was sleeping when i called her at 330 and im not gonna have time to go running tonight. :( . im gonna feel really guilty if i dont go for 2 days in a row.  and not to mention i get kinda sore when i dont run, wierd huh?.....
..... well i think im done writing for now.  this conversation stays between me and you.  LMAO"

"event","yeah so plans for today got canceled again :( Josh says that he was sick today.  i dunno.  i mean i should believe him i guess but im just so used to guys being full of shit and constantly ditching me that i seriously doubt him.  and well we had made plans 2 other nights this week besides today and they all ended up getting canceled for some wierd reason.  monday we were sposed to do something but he fell asleep then went out to kyles to get his guitar and forgot his phone so he had to drive all the way back out there to get it.  (which i know for a fact that happened b/c kyle called me on his phone wanting to know him home phone number to let him know he had forgotten it) then wednesday we were sposed to do something but he went out with kyle earlier that day and got caught in traffic, lost, and then ran out of gas. and today he was sick of course.  i dunno. i just dont really trust guys now.  Chris fucking scarred me and now i dont trust anyone..... bastard..... but yeah  i mean i feel bad for not really believing him b/c i know ill end up finding out he really was really sick and ill feel like an ass for having even doubted him, but i feel like i have to have my doubts or else ill just feel all the dumber if i find out hes full of it.  ya kno??? wow, and they say that girls are complicated!  whats up with that?!  i dunno....."

..... ok so my new years resolution is to lose enough weight to fit in2 these really cute jeans that i got at the thrift store but are a little too small.  their a size 4 and not stretchy at all but they almost fit me, i mean i can get them on alright but theyre not very comfortable. so yeah i think my resolution is a feasable one. i also want to lose 10-15-20 lbs.  these should be easy enough to do since me and Bessy have been running 3 miles aday and ive been drinking alot of water and eating pretty alright too.  im feeling great. .....
..... and i need to take a bath really bad bc i went running earlier today but billy fucking clogged the toilet and wont ""cant"" unclog it rite now so i have to wait till his shit sets for a while before hes goin to unclog it and then ill have to wait for the stench to leave before i can even take a bath s im not so happy ... fucking disgusting guys .....

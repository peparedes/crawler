"event","I turned 18 yesterday.

I've been hanging out with my brother's friends for the past three nights.
One of them hangs out longer with me though, alone.
His name is Jeff.
He's 22 and married, his wife is in the navy.
I sit with him on my bed, sometimes lay.
We just talk about the most random things, and I giggle stupidly.
I want this guy that I can't have.
Did I mention that I have a boyfriend?
Life is complicated for me.

Jeff and I watched a movie together last night. He fell asleep on my bed and so did I. We woke up at 6:30 in the morning...

I have never felt such a strong/weird connection to someone like this.
I'm in way over my head and I'm just going to get crushed because he lives in Virginia, nowhere close to me.

I sit outside with him at 2 in the morning and watch him smoke cigarettes.
We talk about everything.
Mostly math, he likes that.
We talk about stars and life.
We talk about movies and music and things that make us happy.
We talk about why he smokes and why his wife doesn't know.
We talk about innuendos and laugh whenever we think of them.



I am alone right now. 7:27 PM.
I just smoked my first cigarette.
In my bathroom.
I don't want to make that a habit.
I just needed to be reminded of him."

My Valentine's Day was AMAZING!!
My boyfriend is amazing.

You want to know what i got??? yeah, i'm gonna tell you anyway...
*Heart-shaped balloon that says ""I love you"", with a 'stuffed with beans' turtle weighing it down.
*A Baker's dozen of light pink roses with a little balloon saying 'i love you' or something. AND it was in an adorable little vase with hearts on it.
*Scrapbook for us to put ourselves in. and a 'vacation' one for when we go to Cali. next summer.
*3 bears-pink, purple, and a little tourquoise one---all 3 of my favorite colors. They are sitting in a little basket with cut out hearts.
*there was a sucker with a little tag that says ""I'm so happy with you.""
*Dinner at Olive Garden.

After dinner we went shopping at SUPER walmart. It's what we do.

School is more lame (lamer) than ever.
I have gym.

Then something fun later.

"event","my parents and i had a huge discussion about graduating early. my dad was very pissed off. my mom was more understanding, though. so much money has already been spent on seven & senators to quit at semester. i suppose. but high school is sooo pointless for me right now. i have all my credits and everything. 
so that's all fine and dandy, right? well my mom figured out that since i want to graduate at the semester and work more, that i must want to move out. yeah, well, she's right. There started a whole new argument. This was major. lots and lots and lots of yelling. My dad was trying to tell me that i will regret it and things. If i was moving in with a girlfriend, they wouldn't have such a fit about it. ""It's immoral to live with a guy before you are married."" ""you aren't a real Christian."" okay. cool.
man, that sucked a lot. i love my mom and i feel bad but i love my boyfriend, too. i/they have a while so whatever. i just want to work more. i neeed to work more. it's not so easy when you have to go to high school.

then gary and i hung out at his momma's house. 
we went to jared's after that. i am so pathetic: jerry and steve tracy started talking about Christian's and making fun of God and things of that sort. it made me REALLY upset. and of course, i was drunk so i was being really irrational about it. now jerry thinks i hate him. kinda. haha o well
i'm really glad my boyfriend cares more about my feelings.
we went home after that and it was funnn.

i had an amazing day on friday. thank you ;)

last night was crazzzy drama. like earl said : ""the earth must have flipped its axis because everything is so fucked up tonight."" (something like that) SERIOUSLY. BUT i was in a good mood all day/night. that's fucking awesome. i'm real happy with how things are right now. minus the sad things going on with friends. Lauren, thanks for letting us hang with you at your place last night!!
i'm very irrational about things that deal with *you*. get used to it.

i love lauren and erica movie nights! omg, do i!
i love alex jansen. and always will!!! :)

i saw desiree last night and she is *still* the most beautiful lady ever.

ryan and i talked last night. it was sad but okay because i got things off my chest that i haven't told him before.
i guess maybe i will start hanging out with him more again. but i don't trust myself, or him, for that matter.

my job at the mustard seed is going well. it's very boring but i like it. it's hard to dress appropriately, though. ya know?

i went to church this morning and out to brunch with my parents. i was sooo hungry, i had a big bread bowl salad and it was damn amazing. i bought a new cd that i don't really wanna talk about because it sucks sooo bad, it's absolutely horrible. i went tanning, talked to gary real quick, cried, and fell asleep listening to norah jones. i slept for 3 hours, woke up, and ate dinner. my parents had fun making me feel bad. that was cool. slept for 3 more hours and then mr. gary stopped by and we went for a long walk.

i just got back from the park, down the street. Colony West, that is.
I did some thinking.

Another school year is basically over. My ""changing of myself"" period has already happened this year. Good thing i got that out of the way before summer. hah. While at the park, i saw this man who always walks his dog and lives right next door to where Ryan used to live. And it reminded me that Ryan doesn't live there anymore. This will be my 4th summer of knowing Mr. McDonald. It saddens me somehow. Basically because we don't talk much anymore. It's just so sad to think of all the things that have happened with us together in this neighborhood.

Swingsets are the most fun things ever. I love swinging. I love the breeze. ahhhh

Gary Swaggerty left today for Cali/all the other cities Noone Knew is stopping in. I'm gonna miss my boo. haha 

My parents are dumb. Everything has to have a long discussion before or after it. Ridiculous.

I loved Lauren's party fer sure. We are gonna have so much fun this summer, Miss Jansen!

so im good with the way things are. i know i keep saying that, but it's just so different from what i'm used to... or something. but i told someone that 2 nights ago and that night i had a breakdown. cool. ...and of course there are the little silly sad things, like needing more attention, but eh, that happens. i'm just dumb like that.

I arrived home to my aunt and uncle. 
I really like them now.

Saturday was Hues and Harmonies set-up and rehearsal. I dined with my momma and aunt&uncle at The Feed Store for lunch. I took them to the lovely ""Deals."" The concert was saturday night and after that, i surprised mr. swaggerty and visited him at his new apartment.

I've been very sick lately again. My throat probably has cancer. haha
Sunday= church. i had a solo and it was perfect. my pastor kissed me on the cheek and i thought that was cute. but random [!]
my uncle told me he was proud to be my uncle and my aunt told me i rock. hehe, this makes me smile. i never used to talk to them because i was shy forever and they were mean. but, damn, i talked my ass off this weekend. yay
also, on sunday, i went to the dollar store and then made my way over to washington park. Hope & kids were there. it was a nice afternoon at the park. with them crazy, crazy hippies and scary people. we also saw Lillian in all her prettiness at the park. i eventually hung out with sir swaggerty and we stopped by earl's 'n' whatnot to pick up things. gary makes me smile a lot. hmmm, all in all, it was a lovely sunday.

I totally saw kaisa saturday night and it made my night. gawd, she's sooo hott.

Monday was dumb. But i went shopping with my sisterly. :)

Today= voice lesson, singing at senior award night thing, and Gary.

everyone seems to have had a wonderful weekend.

We drove all day friday to jackson mississippi and spent the night there. On saturday we drove to jazz fest, the one that was too rainy to go to yet so we had to waste time at a mall until 1:00 pm. Jazz fest was very wet and humid. BUT i thought ahead and wore my hair wavy. all the gals wore skirts and got muddy up to our knees. it was cute. i saw dave matthew's band, verrry nice. drunken guys (& hippies) and cigarette smoke. i wanted a cigarette so horribly bad. i thought jazz fest was like on the new orleans city streets and whatnot but it was definitely like at a fair grounds. just a bit disappointing. oh, and i bought a cute hippie skirt there. them hippies...saturday night was a different hotel and sunday morning we went to a plantation...it was actually kinda pretty. an alligator swamp tour was later. somewhere during the trip, (not sure when) we went to the french quarter and burbon street. lots of little shops that i loveddd. urban outfitters was there and we ate at hard rock cafe. the scenery was the best thing ever. we also went on a haunted city tour. a creepy guy touched me a lot and told long stories. i couldn't pay attention because i was in fucking new orleans so i was looking around a lot. there are many bikes used for transportation. people are adorable in new orleans and i saw a crossdresser. wow. monday was a clinic for jazz band and our choir at loyola university. our clinictian sucked and liked himself a lot. fuck that. we went to buloxi beach which is also part of the gulf of mexico. i absolutely loved it. i felt so peaceful but lonely at the same time. i walked along the shore and had to really look for the seashells, there really werent many. we drove to jackson mississippi again and on tuesday we drove allll day. that was depressing.

gabe trieger isn't suck an dick anymore, i've decided.
i learned a lot about the people in my choir and they aren't as sheltered as we all like to think. haha

"event","hi. 

i'm so sad.
so angry.
so irritated.

and its a very nice day outside. 

i reallllly don't like this.

""that time of the month"" is DEFINITELY showing.

i don't want to do anything, i don't want to see anyone. what the hell is wrong with me?? last nite= horrible. hah......
it was horrible for not really any reason at all. 

i'm not posting to get people to feel sorry for me, really, im just angry!

i watched White Oleander again last night. i shouldn't watch that anymore. especially when its night-time and im alone.


why do i feel like this!? gahh, it reminds me of back then.

im so sorry for this. sorry for hurting everyone.
umm...that was needed but not.

i probably have to start work again, tomorrow.
that will suck. i have lots of homework to do, too.

i don't like the way things are. and especially now. like, i never really have, except for some times. but i think everything is just dumb.

don't read this. ha


bye <3"

"event","Hanson had a show that night and It was a sold out concert. My family and friends all had ticket's for the show. I didn't have one, So I started begging people that I knew for there ticket. No one would care to give me a ticket and so I started crying. People were not going in through the front door's, They were going in through the back door's. So I didn't bother to follow them because I didn't have a ticket. So I waited out in front then Zac came out. We started talking like we had knowin each other for forever. He asked if I was gonna attend the show and I said that I dind't have a ticket. Then he said that he could get me one, So he left to go and get me a ticket. Zac came out with a ticket and I run and jump on him and we fell down. I fell on my back and he was on top of me. We looked at each other like we were shock of being 'body' close with eachother. Then Zac and I were talking and he came out saying we should swap phone number's so we can talk and get to know one another. So sure thing we did. I ran back home getting some shoe's on becasue I now had a ticket for the show and I didn't want my feet to be stepped on. (It was weird the house was like next door)I no longer had lived with my parent's so I barge into my brother room looking for his shoe's. I was in a hurry because the show was about to start. I ran back to Zac and we were sitting inside waiting for the door's to open (I don't know why he was with me waiting).

It was all a dream! I have been thinking about this all day, While I was at work. It's weird because I love all 3 Hanson but Isaac I fancy more. I have had 4 dream's of Hanson and each one were either I am with, dating, friend, or kissing Zac. I start to wonder do I fancy Zac more then Isaac and I just don't know it."

"event","We grew up with Hanson. They have been there through out our hard times and awkward year's. For some of us, They were our first loves (Even though they had never even seen us or dated) and for some of us they were the only ""friend"" that we had. When Hanson and 'we' got older, It's a different overlook. We grew and found love as they did as well. 
Just the love that they give us and there music that they give us is why we are still here. We love Hanson and Respect them."

"event","Let me start my story off by telling you that I like a guy whose married and has a son. Recently I have had a crush on this guy Padro, He work's with me at Mcdonald's. We have been flirting around for a couple week's. I tried not to grow feeling's for him but I did. So last night when he took me home after work. Him and I were in the car alone, He held my hand. I was trying not to seem like, I like the feeling of him holding my hand. Then he was hinting that he has a crush on me and that he is basically confused because he want's to be with me but doesn't want to get into the mess. So we both come out saying that we have crush's on each other. Before I left he asked for a kissed on hiss cheek and I gave him a kiss on his cheek.
Why does life have to be a b-i-t-c-h? I want to be with this guy but I don't know what to do. Do I want to get in this mess with him or not to get into this. I guess time will come and I will know what I want."

"event","Ha! Bet the subject caught your attention huh! Well Yea, I wish... But I really wish that I was with Isaac and have million's of lil Ikey's running around (A girl can dream). I was just thinking to myself as I was looking through my yahoo profile picture. You know how guy's look through your profile and they IM you if you are very pretty or if you have the same interest. Well I put a picture of Ike and I. I was thinking that alot of guy's are gonna think that he's my boy friend, Fiance, or Husband. Most guy's wouldn't know who Isaac Hanson is, So when they see that picture there gonna think were together. I know that does sound's a little teeny, But I don't give a crap. I like the feeling of people thinking I am with him. Then again if it's a cute guy, Then he an't gonna want to IM me.

"event","I met Hanson for the first time of my life! They are very hot in person! I met them at Red Hot and Boom on July.3, 2004. I just wanted to say thank you to XL106.7 for making my dream come true and thank you to Hanson for being such a great band and so loyal to your fan's. I love you guyz! Muazzz!!!!!

I went with a couple of friend's of mine Lizy and Melanie. At around 10:30 a.m., We finally arrived at Red Hot and Boom. We had parked by the Altomonte mall. We had to walk our lazy butt's to where the event was gonna be held at and did I mention that it was so freaking hot! I'm in my Ike shirt and green short's, So I was pretty comfortable. So we walk around looking for a place to sit. We didn't know weather to sit in fronte of the stage or right next to the dock. So finally we made a decision to sit next to the dock because we would get a good glimpse of the guy's. I lay the blanket on the ground and it was to small for the 3 of us to sit on. But I didn't care as long as I was on the blanket. It was so boring just sitting there. 

Melanie and I walked by a bus and I had thought it was there bus because I saw Jessica. But I wasn't sure if it was (but it was). I had met these girl's outside the hotel and my mission was to find a deck of card's to play with because we were so bored. These girl's were really nice. They had chair's and extra chair's (I was thinking to myself thank God I can finally sit in a chair then a dirty ground). Melanie and I introduce those girl's to Lizy. Melanie take's off with Nicole. Lizy and I went to the mall to get something to eat. We came back to see if Melanie was there. She was nowhere to be found. We were so pissed. We had called her on Nicole celly and she didn't even come over to where we were at. It started raining and we ran to the hotel. We went to the back of the hotel (were all the celebrity walk in and out of the hotel). So I finally see Melanie and Nicole. Nicole was flirting with the security. She had mention to us that he was gonna get us vip. So I am just sitting there, Bored to death all by myself on a bench. 

There were like 7 of us in the hallway. The security made a deal with us, That we could stay there as long as we don't go goo goo gaa gaa over the celebrity's. I got all nervous because the security tell's us that someone was gonna walk through here and he doesn't know who it will be. I am not sure what time it was, But I would say around 1:30 p.m. or so. So sitting there for about a hour and a half. I am just sitting there bored. I look up and Taylor walk's by. I look at him with a second glance with a shock on my face. I couldn't believe that he had just walked past me. I didn't even hear him come around the corner. He had a smile as he walked through. I guess he was being quite so he wouldn't get mobbed by fan's. I looked at Melanie and said very nervously was that Taylor and she said yea (She was shocked as well). So I am sitting there keeping a eye for when Taylor come's out. A few minute's later, Lizy and Melanie said Heather Isaac is coming and I said stop messing around. I was so nervous that I lit up a cigarette, Then right when I look up. Isaac walk's by looking at my shirt. He had a big smile (I will never forget that expression on his face). My eye's just followed him inside and I was just sitting there in shock. He looked so hot in person. I got pissed because I didn't even get a chance to ask for a autograpgh. Lizy told me that the security had stop Isaac to see if he had a pass to get in the hotel and Isaac told the security that he was a band member (I mean who could forget Hanson). So I am there smoking my cigarette from being all nervous, While looking for Isaac and Taylor to come out. I stand up just incase they do come out. A while after that I saw Isaac coming out of the elevator. I didn't know what to do or say to him. I could feel my feet getting all sweaty. Isaac was sighing a autograph for this girl inside the hotel. He come's out and I ask for a autograph. He reply's I don't have a pen. I gave him my marker that I had with me and I was shaking as I handed it to him. He signed a couple of autograph's. I didn't even say thank you (How rude was that). Then I realize that he was taking picture's with other fan's. When he was done signing autograph's, He was looking for the person that had gave him the marker. He was waving the pen and I said it was mine. I ask if I could get a picture with him (Through my nervous voice). He said sure. I gave the camra to Britney to take. I walk up to him looking all lost and when I was standing there next to him I felt like we were just gonna stand there for the picture. So I put my arm's around him and I thought to myself maybe I shouldn't put my arm's around him becuase when they were younger there parent's didn't like when they hugged fan's. So I pulled my hand's away from him and Isaac put his arm's around me (I had my little teeny bopper moment, All I thought was OmG he has his arm's around me). I felt so happy and star struck at the same time. I said thank you to late once I realize everone else have said it to him. Then I walk away taking picture's of him. These girl's asked for a autograph and I over heard that they didn't have a pen nor did he. So I put out my pen and the girl was looking through her purse for one. So I felt like a dumb idiot because he didn't even hear me. I walk away toward's the water fountain. He walk's toward us and Melanie ask for a hug. Isaac said sure and gave her a hug. Isaac said nice to meet you guys. I had called Angela and told her everything and I was freaking out. I felt like I was gonna cry of excitment.

It wasn't raining as hard and we decided to wait by the bus. No luck of Hanson. We were gonna walk back to where we were at before. We walked on the other side of the bus and I saw Isaac out of the window. He was signing autograph's and he went inside to do something (He left the window open). The security told us he didn't want us stepping all over the bushes. The security was knocking on the window, Isaac popped his head out. He told Isaac that he does not want the fans on the bushes and Isaac got the hint to shut the window. All I was thinking to myself Ike got introuble lOl. I think Ike was embarrassed. So we go back to that little hall way. As time came no luck of Hanson to be found. I was getting all worried that we would be late for the interview with Hanson with XL106.7 at 6:00 p.m. So about 10 mintue's before the interview, We walk over there. We wait up by the fence that they were gonna walk through, So we could get some good picture's and hopefully get Tay and Zac autograph's. As we were standing there it started raining and a possible of a tornado. So everyone ran to hide for cover. We were gonna go back to were we were at before we came here. As we were walking I saw a crowd of fan's around the tour bus. So I ran over there not having my camera or Underneath cover with me. Lizy had went somewhere else with the stuff. I thought I had droped it or lost it. Zac was signing autograph's and it started lightning and pouring. Zac said 'guyz you should go back inside, It's not to safe out here'.

I was so mad because I thought Red Hot and Boom was gonna be cancelled. Then my friend told me that she was listening to the radio and they said they were not gonna cancel, It was gona be delayed. A little after 9:oo p.m. We walked over to the bus waiting for Hanson to come out. 2 car's drove up to the bus. Hanson get's off the bus and head's there way to the car's. Lizy and I were in fronte of the the car while the car was in motion. We walked over to where they were gonna get out of the car. I was hoping to complete my autograpgh. They didn't stop to sigh autograpgh's, They walked over to the stand where XL106.7 was having the interview. I was about 3rd row away from them. After the interview they headed on stage. First they had to ride a boat to get there. Lizy, Brianna and I walked to find a good spot to be standing at. The place was packed with people and we didn't know where to stand at. I found a place which was a ok view. But they were so far away because the stage was in the middle of the lake. It was gonna be a accoustic show, They preformed ""Where's the love"", ""Deeper"", ""Misery"", and ""Penny and Me"". Lizy and I left before they were gonna sing ""Penny and me"". We wanted to wait by the bus. We REALLY wanted to get Taylor and Zac autograpgh.

While we were waiting by the bus the firework's went off. It was the longest firework's that I have seen. I didn't care about the firework, I was so worried that they went to the hotel. Lizy and I were thinking of where to be waiting at either by the bus or by the hotel. So after the firework's Lizy had the idea of waiting by the fence where Hanson has to walk through. We walked over there and it was crowded by fan's. I saw Zac. I stand up against the fence and I was between wet bushes. I had my hand out with the marker and the cover. I yell out Zac and he walk's over to me. I handed him my Underneath cover and he take's it in his hand along with the marker. He was signing it with the marker lead on. Then he relized that it was on. He looked at me and said 'I thought it was off' and gave me this weird look (Maybe because I took a picture while he was talking to me). Then Taylor walks by while talking to someone. I screamed Taylor name out and I kept trying to get his attention. This girl behind me was trying to get a picture with Zac. Zac looked at me and said 'can you please move, So she can get through'. I did move a little but my attention was getting Taylor's attention. Zac leaned on me, Since the girl couldn't get through. I had my teeny booper moment again, It was OmG he's leaning on me, I feel him lOl. Taylor walked by and I scream his name and I started taping on him. He turned around and I shove the cover in fronte of him. he signs it and sign's other and walked to the car. Lizy and I didn't see Isaac, But then we saw him already by the car. 

Lizy and I ran back to the bus and waited for the guyz to show up. They came out of the car and got on the bus. I had walked away to get my stuff out of Nicle's car. I came back and Lizy told me that Taylor said they would be be out to sign autograpgh's in 1 minute. That 1 minute turned into 2 hour's. Fan's started to chant a whole bunch of thing's like where's the love, Don't be ashame,appriciate, We suport you, Come out and more but I forgot. Fan's got in fronte of the bus and stayed there so. Poeple were getting mad at Hanson and started riping up Hanson poster's. The door opened and Zac came out. Zac said 'You guyz i'm really sorry but we were having a meeting' People ask if he would give autograpgh's and he had his marker ready. They had to get going. 

The bus had a hard time geting out of the parking lot, They had 2 buses. I came out of the hotel and I saw Isaac talking to the bus driver. Isaac saw me and had the biggest smile.


Here's a couple picz of the guyz that I took, While they were signing my Underneath cover. I do have more but I don't want to use up to much web space.

its been a pretty shitty day. i didn't get to sleep til bout 12 b/c i was studying for a fuckin history test, which i 

prolly failed. then, i got up not hearin my alarm and my mom had a fit. ::sigh:: on the way to school, i asked my mom if 

rachel could dye my hair and she said ""no........i don't want you with me on vacation looking like a punk"" WTF?? god mom, 

thanks for excepting your own daughter!! then i got to school, watched romeo and juliet, sat in biology and i HATE that 

class, except for the fact it w/ alyssa. then i got a C on my health test. how the fuck did i do that?? i dunno.... then i 

failed my history test, had a boring day in french and got a worksheet in geometry that made me feel more stupid than 

shit. then i came home, w/ 2 fuckin essays to write (one done and the other in progress). and here i am, feeling like shit 

b/c of how blind i was to all of the love my friends give me, but i don't take the time to notice, let alone appreciate. 

i'm sorry guys. (crap now my make up's running) i should do what wendy told me, open up my eyes. i also shouldn't be so 

hung up on guys. i look at her and see how happy she is and i should be some what just as happy as her. i should also over 

come my fear of face-to-face confrontation. i'm not sure how i'd handle it though. how many times can i be wrong in one 

journal entry?? obviously too many times. (sp. on obviously)  god, i fuckin hate life, ian, i think i'm goin to use that 

nuse you made me. god my sister's a fuckin retard. she hit my moms dog in the eye and its looks like she's blind in it now.

its not dialating and she can hardly open it. great, some more money going to the fucking vets office. GOD FUCK FUCK FUCK

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK 

FUCK!!!!!!!! Jesus Christ i'm fucking pissed off now!! my sister's suck a cunt ass douche bag fag fuckin loser. she acts 

like she's fuckin black, and not in the funny way. like she's the shit and no one can be as cool as her and she's a 

'gangsta' and a 'pimpsta' god i just want to beat the shit out of her. thank god for the little self control that i have.

"event","hey
you may be wonderin why i choose the name dyin_4_you. there's a few reasons behind it. 
1. Kevin's constant, you're still here, i thought you were goin to kill yourself.
2. i would easily die for any of my friends. 
3. on my english test today, a question asked something to the effect of would i die or live with out my true love (we're reading ROMEO & JULIET)  and i answered if they were my true love i would rather die rahter than live my life with out a meaning. and i think it's romantic to have someone to die for you. 
well, those are my reasons......well that and i think the name sounded pretty cool. lol.

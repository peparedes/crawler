"event","I hate it when men are ill.   Men who are ill are always right about everything even when they are not.  Men who are ill don't take suggestions as someone trying to help.  No I'm obviously just wrong and crap.  Well fine!  Whatever!  I know he feels crap and my 'rubbish' suggestions are just my way of trying to help him feel better.
And another thing, when I'm made to feel like this it makes me want to eat.  No wonder I got fat recently.  I feel so crappy now.  I have this lump in my throat and I am craving chocolate covered lard bars.  Anything just to take the bitter edge off.  I know stuff!!! I'm intelligent and have qualifications and a career to prove it.  yet he makes me feel like my opinion is worth nothing.  Rant rant rant.  sulk sulk sulk.  god I'm boring.  I bore myself at the moment with all this.  I'm not excited by my love life, I'm bored with disagreeing, I'm bored with not going anywhere and the prospect of not going anywhere.  
Am I a bitch?
Dunno.
I do know I'm disengaging mentally from us and rebuilding me.  not a good sign for our relationship.  Once I get like this, its very hard to pull back.

That's coz it's been ages since I've done anything.  I've been decorating to prepare for the new lodger.  Boring and draining and hard work and OMG where has my life gone!!!!!
I'm so bored.  I wanted to go to Elektrofest but the decorating and my parents and the trains talked me out of it and now I'm even more bored.  Thank god I have a sex life.  At least I can say I'm staying in but not on my own.
In fact I'm so bored with things at the mo, that writing about it is boring me.

My Grandma Died.
She was beautiful and funny and nice and the best house mate I've ever had.
At least she didn't suffer too much.
So now I'm rattling around the house on my own.
I have to get a lodger.
I wasn't ready for things to change yet.  I liked living with her.
She was ready to go.  No long drawn out suffering and hospitalisation for her.  No thank you.  Had enough, going now.
Bless her.
I'm starting to sleep a little better now.  It's been over a week since she died.
I'm gonna be poor for a while.
At least I can stay in the house.  It is my home.
RIP Grandma."

Off that subject.
I have to get my head down and plan for the impending photo shoot I have booked.  It's for the website.  I have 3 models and not enough origional clothes to put them in.
I have about 4 tops but no skirts ready.
I almost want to just model the lot myself, and that way I can cut the sewing work, but how dull will that look.  Nothing but pictures of me!  Naw.
I also want to plan the shoot properly.  A complete style look.  The photographer is doing it as a favour and has said its all up to me.
Gota dash

Then I had to go back to work.  So I worked 3 days then stopped and had another break for 3 days.  Why not.
I have woken up a bit today.  I've been booking things on the internet.  Flights to Amsterdam.  (Why not, it is the best place to go!)
Flights to Edinburgh for Dark City.
Is everyone going to Dark City?  Line up looks good so far.

Panto is finished and was a raging success.
We had the awards and I won 3.
Best Production Gimms Tales
Worst Prop, the thorn hedge in Grimms Tales
Cock up of the year, me for head butting the wall during Grimms Tales.  (It was a large and very painfull bump)
I got very drunk at Mike's party and was a Bad Heidi.  I had a great time though.
Anyway, more tomorrow.

Yep I've got a cold............AGAIN!
So pissed off.  I have to shake it off by tomorrow.  It's the Theatre Workshop Artistic Talent Awards (TWAT Awards).  It's a great night and NJ and I have decided to help present the awards in our Fairy outfits.  So I spent the best part of last night making a new tutu.  I have new goth lolita shoes to wear with new fairy outfit.  Yay!
I recon this year I should get at least 1 award.  Best Production of the year for my Grimms Tales effort during the summer.
Panto is going ok.  I am getting into character a bit more.  I was swinging my hips so hard in Sundays curtain call I nearly swung myself of the edge of the stage.  Oops.  very funny though.  I've been in the paper advertising it, which is always nice.

"event","I am on a 4 week sex ban.  I have to heal after the loop dia-thingey.  So last week and the week before I didn't care.  The thought of anything going any where near that part of me was beyond comprehension.  
Now, it's all I can think about.  Every programme I watch on telly seems to be about sex, how to do it, how not to, masturbation.  My part in the panto is all about sex, well, she's men't to be sexy anyway.  So I'm strutting round the stage in a tight 'tit's an ass' corset, pouting and flirting and.......MY GOD, I'M SO HORNY!
I was dreaming about vibrators last night.  Big buzzing pink vibrators.
This is pathetic.
I'm being a bit masochistic, in that I am flirting like a bitch on heat (hang on, am I a bitch on heat) and I'm snogging as much as possible.
Whatever.
I've got a photographer for the website, when I eventually get it up and running.  A guy called Scott Lewis.  I'm kinda nervous about doing a shoot.  He wants me to direct him on what I want the shoot to look like.  I want hime to tell me the poses that will look best.  2 adapters comprimising will not get much done.  I'll end up with more sappy pics like the ones I had done at the double take model thing studio.  Cute but not goth.
Anyway, should work now.

"event","I went a bit mental.
I wasn't very happy last week at all.  The trauma of the treatment caused a lot of stress, misery and depression.  I wasn't sleeping, I was panicking about the show/costume/carol singing and was convinced I was the lowest form of scum and nobody cared and I didn't matter, and why couldn't I cope because people have that done all the time and they cope, everyone expects me to cope, and why doesn't my body feel right, and all I wanted to do was hide under a rock.  Had tears and trauma at work on Friday and was sent home.  Have chilled out since then.  I'm not very good at not coping.  I tend to berate myself for it and refuse to admit that stuff gets to me.  It was a shitty thing they did, and it felt really crappy afterwards for quite a while.  
All terribly dramatic and self important crap.
Oh well.
I think Sunday 2nd run-through for the panto helped me to feel better, realising that I knew my lines - to a point - and it wasn't going to be quite as pants as I thought.
Plus most of my weekend was very relaxing and I stopped pressuring myself to do stuff.
There you go.
I've got a headache but I don't really care.

"event","I am in a funny place at the moment.
I had my treatment on Friday which was bloody uncomfortable.  I have to admit I cried like a baby.  But not painful after.  I had a couple of twinges but that's it.  The thing that has freaked me is the emotional after effects.  I have been tired, unenthusiastic, emotional, vulnerable, sensitive, generally quite crap.  It's like permenant PMT.  I cried after I left the pub last night because birdman didn't really talk to me.  He was talking to other people, no big deal, big deal to me in this frame of mind.  I want to sleep forever.
Another annoying side effect is I feel totally unsexy.  Not good for a Bond girl in the panto.  I am meant to be so out there and I just can't get it up. (metophorically speaking)
I think I need a damn good snog.  But I can't actually be bothered to go get one, because even though I know a couple of peeps that would oblige I wouldn't get the lust and passion from them I need to snap me out of the lethargy.  How can I ask anyone to fancy me when I can't stand myself?  Too heady.
I was talking about the boy girl differences with Paul the other night.  How boys say something and girls spend 20 mins analyising and interpreting and twisting it untill they get really confused and psycho. 
Boy says ""I'm hungry""
Girl thinks 'he said that very curtly, has he gone off me, am I not giving him what he needs, does he fancy someone else, am I dull/fat/unattractive/pscho?'
Boy means - I'm hungry, I want food.
I am a girl, but I understand boy thinking.  I think things as a girl, but I don't generally say girl things.  I drive myself mad for ages thinking about each comment and then my brain says 'he wants food' (or whatever the comment was) so I don't say any of the psycho stuff that is normally attributed to girls and just sit quietly.  I spend a lot of time not saying much.  But as a girl every so often it all comes out in a big gabble.
Why am I babbling about this?
Oh yeah, I think I'm more of a girl at the moment.  with the enhanced PMT and everything.

I'm on destruct about something.  I thought I'd gone through all this in therapy.  Yeah, shitty stuff happened.  I dealt at the time, why am I suddenly reacting against it now?  I'm having a few procedures that no one else is particularly worried about, why am I being so morbid?  I've got it in to my head that my luck is so shite I'm not gonna make it past 35.

There are a couple of things I could do without tonight.  
1.  Seeing the ex and his new bird - she's just too insecure for me to be around, she makes me insecure. 
2.  Chris W.  He is jsut annoying.  No opinions of his own and I think he has a thing for me.  Eeewwww!  Makes me squirm.

I was wandering the corrider in my pants and boots.  Just when I found a pair of trackie bottoms to put on I saw my boss, she was crouched on the floor of her office shaking her head and complaining about the state of young people.  I crouched down next to her and comiserated.
Weird because she actually scares me a bit, and yet I felt compelled to talk to her when I was in the vulnerable state of being half naked.  
I struggled to wake up this morning.

Anyway, last night I went to a Mary Kay cosmetic makeup training session as a guest.  Not overly impressed.  American motivational sales crap.  They were trying to sell the career to me.  No way, I hate sales jobs, and the makeup was nothing special, and the techniques were amaturish.  hilarious.

Straightened my hair last night.  Just to remind myself that I hate myself with straight hair.  was confirmed by most peeps at the rehearsal that it looks shit.  They're honest!  Noone at work has commented, which confirms that they don't actually look at me other that to tell me how pale I am.  I know I'm pale!  I cultivate the pale look for 2 reasons.  
1. because I'm goth 
and 
2.  because sun is bad for your skin.  

I've arranged to go for dinner with my ex next week.  Should be good.  I haven't seen him for weeks and I've really missed his perspective on life.  He is hilarious but he understands some of my weirdness aswell.  We were good talkers just not good partners.
I am noticing (and being alerted to) more that I have irratic moments where clarity dissappears.  Paul calls it me 'BEING A GIRL'.  I dunno.  Is it that simple?  Every moment of self doubt leading to strange antagonistic behaviour.  Being annoying to get a reaction, any reaction.  I watch myself behaving like a 3 year old and yet I can't do anything to stop myself.  Telling the truth seems impolite.  It seems to brash.  Yet if I tell the truth 3 days later, I feel like a bit of an idiot who was worried about nothing.  By truth I mean 'I feel' statements.
I feel vulnerable
I feel emotional
I feel worthless
I feel like I'm going to be abandoned.
No I don't say none of that truthfull stuff.  I go cutsie or annoying.  tickling, jokes, whatever I can think of to get attention.  Cos I'f I'm getting attention then the problem goes away.  for a few days anyway.  
Am I crazy?
Kinda all makes sense to me.

Not impressed.  the last big event I had booked before Christmas and I was sick.  We're talking head full cant breathe coughing nausea crapness.  Not fun.  So I sulked a lot.  Went to after-party at Slimes on the Sunday and was a complete wet blanket.
So I've had a week off everything.  No work, no panto rehersals, no friends.  I made my Chicken soup cold cure.  Drank 5 pints of the stuff.  great.  It's the chilli and ginger that make it so yum.
I made a cake, which pleased Grandma.  It's always a good day for Grandma when Cake is involved.  I guess too much time off makes me want to cook.
Yesterday I had a halloween tea party.  I made potato salad, and cooked Pizzas and had every kind of halloween sweet and cake thought of.  I drank myself silly on cosmopolitans.  We watched 3 horror films.  and if I may say so I was suitably witched up with my costume.  Emma and Nancy-Jane both want my hat.  It's a proper Salem style hat with a wire enforced brim.  Grandma was most impressed.
Tried NJ in my new dreads.  Wierd.  It looked good but not like her.  She's too blond to wear dark brown and purple dreads.  Her complexion doesn't like it.  she wants some blond dreads.  I've been in my waist length brown falls all weekend.  Upset a guy at a party who was excited about playing with my hair until he found out it was fake.  He started rambling angrily at me about people being true and chaos and calm being ying and yang.  I couldn't be arsed to argue with him about people's right to self expression through image and accessorising.  Probably a good thing cos I would have been arguing all night.  the guy in question was reported to have ended the night gibbering in his own vomit.  
Rambling now.
Going to the pub for lunch.
Yay.

I kinda lost momentum during the summer.  Now it's colder again I can focus.  Plus I am getting a computer soon sa I can get my website up and running.  And I've made some new photographer contacts.  
Yep need to concentrate.  and I need some money.  This month is going to be hard, cash wise.  One of the guys at work suggested I walk the streets.  I'm not convinced I'd make any money.  Plus I'm fussy about who I have sex with.  I think that's an age thing.  But I need to be sure that it's going to be worth doing.  
I suppose I'm quite lucky that I'm a good judge of a persons performance without trying them first, but no.  I'm glad I don't have to go looking for it at the mo.  Someone asked me how can I tell what someone's like in bed.  I couldn't work it out.  Its a combination of things.  the way they move, conversation skills, confidence, a sense of humour.  Flirting is a good way to tell.  Some people talk the talk but only to make up for a lack of confidence in the way they walk the walk.  
Sounds big headed, but I'm pretty confident that I'm good in bed.  The same people keep wanting to come back for more.  And they are the people that I rate as 'good'.  Enthusiasm has a lot to do with it.
I'm greedy though.  I like to cum a lot, and long and hard.  In fact if I can remember who I am afterwards then it's not enough.  Is that a bad thing.

I was at some weird town festival, the ones where they have  exotic foods stalls and cheep fun fair type stuff.  Everyone looked either like businessmen or mid american inbreds.  I met up with my family at a Chinease resturant.  Everyone was acting slightly unhinged.  It was set menu and really foul.  sweet and sour dog - a least that's what it looked like.  food was being split everywhere and mum was pissed off at me for being disrespectful to the businessmen.  I ran off and ended up in the local convience store.  There was a couple having nasty sex on the counter, real white trash types - he wore a lumberjack shirt with torn off sleeves and she was a trashy blonde in faded denim.  They stopped and started shooting up.  

That's when I woke up.  What the hell is wrong with my head?
Shrink would have a field day with all the symbolism behind that.
I'm getting fed up with not being able to sleep properly."

"event","Woke up really late today.  5 mins to get ready and all I could find to wear was white or cream.  Got a feeling that everyone will still think I'm wearing black.  It's wierd, people don't see colour on me any more.

I was going to start making some more stuff last night.  I want some new clothes for infest.  Just sat on the sofa, waiting for my brain to dribble out of my ears.  
Oh well.

I have had some really cool ideas for new clothes, I can't seem to pin them down on paper or even describe them.  It's just hints of images.  But then that's how I started last time.  the top kinda made itself.  I need a new supplier for fabrics.  I need to get the lightweight synthetics.  and it would be fun to get some plastics and uv reactive stuff.  Paul keeps telling me GLOSHOP.  I dunno.  Maybe I wasn't looking at it right.
It's a morph style that I'm making, I realised when I went to Slimelight at the weekend, it's not trad, it's not cyber, not fetish, yet has bits of all of them.  (With a little 80's retro added for fun!)  I felt good with my look on Sat night.
I think Paul liked it.  He'll not admit it though.
Anyway I should work now."

"event","It is unfortunate... The reason why I am back on my island. My home... My father passed away on Sunday, July 06, 2003.  The last time I saw him alive was two years ago... That was also the last time he held me, his only child; in his arms... The last time I told him, ""I love you"" was two weeks before he died... And people tell me, ""I'm sorry"" and in my head I think, ""yeah... me too!!!"".  And I cannot do anything about it... As each day becomes night and the cycle repeats itself; it slowly becomes more of a reality that I do not have a father.  A part of me is mad... It's just not fair... One day you have a father and the next you don't.  That's not how it's supposed to happen.  The one thing I loved about my father was that he was proud of me!  Something I cannot even be for myself.  

He looked so at peace in his ivory casket w/ gold accents... Almost as if he was sleeping.  He looked so real that I had expected him to wake up.  I cried when he did not; and when they closed that casket for the last time... I realized that this would be the last time I saw my father.  And it hurt so much!!!  Tears continue to bring no comfort... and I am just sad... And I miss him so much... I lost the one man who loved me unconditionally... who believed in me 110% and then some... the man who made sacrifices in his lifetime to ensure that I had the opportunities that he never had.  And it hurts even more to know that I did not make anything of those oppurtunities... All of a sudden I have this renewed energy and motivation to do something with my life... And I hate it as much as I welcome it!  

And now I am the man of the house... The man who is supposed to take care of my mother... The woman who found my father lifeless on the re-cliner in our living room.  What of her pain?  This entire situation has taken my life and turned it upside down!  I feel so lost sometimes... the rest of the time jaded; and my first instinct is to run.  Run like I have always done... Mommy and daddy will fix things right???  WRONG!!!  There is no mommy and daddy anymore... Just mommy and me... And I cannot even take care of myself, yet alone the two of us.  

Right now??? I'm just trying to find some closure... finish my crying... and then we'll take life one day at a time.  We only miss 100% of the shots we don't make!!!  


Daddy I love and miss you and you will always be in my heart!!!!!  And I want to say, ""come back!!!"" but it would be at no avail..."

"event","I wrote this tweaked out in AZ....  After reading this almost two years later I realize that maybe it wuz the drugs!!!

The days grow longer and longer
...Almost as if my life has stopped and the rest of the world continued on w/o me.

I can't say my life has lost it's meaning, but it's like I no longer know what that meaning is.  Purpose???

Could it be the DRUGS?  <-In Reference to ""meth""
No... The drugs are just a habbit I picked up so I could forget just how fuct up and unfair this world is.

And yet I have this intuitive feeling that there is more to life than this regimented cycle."

"event","I dunno when I wrote this... 

I used to watch you sleep
and it was then that I loved you most
...it was then you looked your best
innocent... so delicate
...like a porcelean Lladro...
I dare not touch you for fear of your waking
In turn causing my dream to end
And your scent... 
So intoxicating...
It was then I loved you most...
I would just watch you breathing
...sleeping; close to me

I tried to remember...
I tried but I couldn't feel you...
our arms entangled in a time long forgotten...
Pillows give me no sollace
Yet I hold tight to you,
   but no fabric can immitate your delicate skin...
Nor does it kiss back w/ sweet unending kisses.
Embrace me again!!!
Child... Man... Lover..."

"event","Slightly sleeping I woke up to my monotonous life.
In all direction reality surrounded me.
An empty darkness filled only w/ it's need to be whole...
   and complete...
The living dichotomy  in my sou
   became impartial to that beating organ in my chest.
...and when the moon casts it's shadow upon my earth
I sleep to wake...
...waiting to die"

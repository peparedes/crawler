"event","for the last 2 weeks, i have been back home in cali visiting friends.  Things between me and Jade are fucking awesome and i couldnt ask for more.  But there were some problems back home.  I used to be with this girl lana for 4 years and to make a long story short she was fucking my bestfriend for the majority of the time we were together.  I ended that relationship and came out here for a new start.  So back home, me and jade were having a picnic on the beach ***planned by me*** and lana appeared out of nowhere and she had the nerve to sit down with us.  All im gonna say is that I dont remember the last time I got so angry.  Out of all the beaches and all the days, she was there.  thats some crazy shit.  so after Jade bitched out lana we decided to go back to Marissas and call it a night.  
now we're back home--not living together--but still staying strong."

"event","Jade wants me to move in with her but I dont think that would be a good idea.  No job=no money.  I think that if I did move in with her, it would cause drama.  

In other news, i got some new ink.  I met this guy named Frank and he does stuff like that.  I got a nice discount and it looks fuckin rad.  Its this dragon thats blowing out flame.  
Ill write more later."

"event","Yet again, i have failed to post on here in the past few days and for that i apologize.  But I have some interesting news.  Jade and I had sex.  It was probably the best sex ive ever had in my life (and thats saying something) hahaha.  
I still have to find a job since NOBODY called me back. Big surprise.

"event","For the past couple of days Ive been staying over at Jades house.  That is the reason I havent updated.  I apologize to those of you that read my entries.  But we have been getting to know eachother alot better and my feelings might be changing towards her.  Im not really sure.  Im confused about lots of things right now and I have no clue where Im going in life.  I need a future."

"event","Im back.  Anyone miss me?  
I dont know how the whole job search went.  I havent gotten any call backs.  Maybe its the way i look.  Too bad I dont intend on changing anything about myself anytime soon.  
Ive been chillin with Jade and her friends lately and its been alot of fun.  I think she might be interested in being more than friends though, and im not down with that.  Shes a really nice girl and shes attractive but i dont feel anything like that towards her.  
Marissa.  You got a journal on here!  Now you just have to persuade everyone else to get one also. 
One thing thats different from Cali is the weather.  Snow should be coming soon, i believe.  I havent seen snow in the longest time so im looking forward to it. 
Alright. Ive gotta go pick up jade.  We're going bar hopping tonight. ;)"

Oh yeah.  I think my friend Marissa (from Cali) might be getting one of these journals.  If that does happen, Im hoping she'll get a nice warm welcome just like I did."

"event","I am confused about how to 'design' my screen.  If there's anyone that is good with that kind of stuff and that would be willing to help a guy out... let me know.  Im willing to fork-up my password in order for you to do some tweaking. 
Im thinking about trying to get some of my friends from back home on here.  It would probably cost alot less than talking to them on the phone all the time.
Last night I went out to Boston Tavern.  It was a drag.  Im not saying the bar was bad, but I didnt enjoy myself too much. I still need to search around here a bit. 
Thank you to all you wonderful ladies that added me!  Youre all awesome!"

Im Jack, 21 years old and I just recently moved to Illinois from California.  Its a big change for me and so far it blows.  Im not registered in school right now but id like to do something that involves music/business management since i adore music.  Living with relatives isnt as great as most people think.  Im staying with my Aunt Nikki and Uncle John for a little while.  Dont ask me why.  I think im going to check out some communities on here now."

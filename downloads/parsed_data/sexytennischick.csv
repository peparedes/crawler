"event","So much has happened since I wrote last...I don't even know if I remember it all!

THURS: Nothing happened during the day, but the night was intresting.  At my muny concert I finally decided to tell Steve what was up at Imo's afterwards.  So me and this girl named Beth went there and waited...and waited...and waited...and he never showed.  So I gave up.  No more Steve for me.  On the way home some guys in a Dodge mooned us.  It was great!!!


FRI: I left for Branson with Dave and his folks today.  Slept all the way there.

SAT: One word...hell!  Dave's dad is such a jackass!!!  He made our day miserable.  We went on the Ducks, which was fun, and then we went to the Dixie Stampede (which Tom made unbearable with his bitching).  After that though, me and Dave's mom went shopping, and that was fun!!!

SUN: Water water everywhere!  We went to the lake, and I was dangling my feet it the water when a boat went by about 700 ft away.  I thought ""oh look a boat"" and about 10 minutes later a gigantic wave washed me out!  Too funny!!!  Then we went and fed fish at the hatchery...which was so much fun!  I've never seen so many fish in my life!!!

MON: Came home from Branson, and went to muny rehearsal.  Talked with Jamie forever afterwards, and got stared at by 3 freshman.  Ugg.

TUES: Band camp who hoo.  It sux, except that Brian is there...he makes things fun.  I love playing the xyliphone.  Better than marching anyway!!!  Afterwards I went with Dave and my folks to see The Village.  Cool movie...makes ya think.

WED: More camp, but afterwards Drew called and we're gonna hang out in Forest Park tomorrow night hehe.  I'm so excited he is sooo cute!!!  I had a muny concert at a nursing home place, and it was great.  This one old guy even got up and danced to our last piece hehe.  Steve got his wisdom teeth out so I won't see him before he leaves (he actually called me to tell me my God!!!).  Oh darn!!!

I registered for school today!  Here are my classes!
Band
Honors World History
AP Stats
Adult Living/Current Issues

"event","Ahhh me and Jamie had waaayyy too much fun last night!  We went to the Muny to see Guys and Dolls, but didn't stay for the secound half.  We ended up going to the Loop, where Jamie gave this really creepy guy 20 bucks so he would leave us alone lol.  But before that...on the way there we pulled up next to a 15 passenger van from a church filled w/ young, yet good looking, good church going guys.  We waved and blew kisses at them and they were like drooling all over themselves which made us feel absolutely amazing hehe.  Anywayz we ended up at Steak 'N Shake laughing our asses off for about an hour hehe.  Too much fun!

Today I did housework, and went to my g-pa's for a while.  Fun times!

Anyway...my quote for the day may be inapropriate for some eyes hehe......

"event","Catch up time!
FRI~I played Monopoly w/ David to make him feel better.  We also went to KFC and ate food.  That night I went out w/ my daddy and saw I, Robot.  Great movie!

SAT~Joyce's brother got married, and I went to the reception.  It was so much fun!  I even danced w/ the DJ, but then Shea came.  I slow danced w/ him for every slow song,  and we got kinda close on the last song.  It was nice.

SUN~I caught up on my chores and went shopping.

MON~I hung out wiht Shea at the mall (we played w/ a Scottie dog hehe).  Then I went to rehearsal.  Steve actually talked to me!  On his own!!!  But as soon as his trombone friend came over, it was like I didn't exist.  So Eric and Chirs are gonna talk to him and see what's going on.

Today I have been sitting on my bum.  I'm tired.

"event","So yesterday David had surgery on his very private parts...ouch!!!  One of his ""brothers"" was all twisted, and they had to actually go in there and untwist it.  If they wouldn't have got to it in time, it may have fallen off!!!  Scary thought.  He was very upset, but then they gave hin Vicadyn and everything was a-ok...mostly b/c he was out like a light hehe.  So all day today I stayed over at his house making sure that he took his meds and stayed off his feet.

After that I had percussion rehearsal, and this guy there who helps teach us ACCTUALLY TALKED TO ME!!! His name's Brian, and I used to be really good friends w/ his older bro Dan (until he became a jackass). I've known him for years, but he usually doesn't talk with me unless no one else is around...but today he talked to me on his own, and not b/c I was doing something wrong.  It was kinda nice, he's a really cute guy.

After that I went to Jamie's and ate, and then we went to muny band.  A jazz combo played, and this old couple was slow dancing on the street.  SO ADORABLE!  I wish I was old and had a husband that would dance w/ me on a street even when no one else is.  I almost asked someone to dance...but I didn't.  Not sure why.  I didn't talk to Steve, and it was great!  He kept looking over at me, and I'd just laugh along w/ my buds and occasionally shoot him a glance.  Maybe he'll actually start initiating conversation more if I just ignore him, or maybe he likes the girl thats hard to get.  I dunno, I've tried everything else!!!!!!

Goodnite homies!!!

"event","So I haven't written in a while so heres a little catch up:

FRI~ummm Steve was supposed to call but he nevre did so I went to the Troy homecoming with Shea, and it was boring...
We did see Mr. Hipple there (getting smashed), and one of the people Shea used to play w/ in the Troy community band asked him if his girlfriend (gestured in my direction) played an instrument, and if she did she could play too.  Shea was like, ""Oh no it's not like that..."" but the guy never caught on and continued to call me Shea's gf.  Oh well...
After that we went to Joyce's and watched American Beauty w/ her and Joe, and Shea thought it was disgusting.  He never quite got the point of the movie but who cares?

SAT~I went to Grant's Farm w/ Dave and his folks...we pet animals and drank beer, and it was grand!  After that I waited around for Steve to call or show up at my house for 2 hours...got angry and me and Shea went and played pool BY OURSELVES!!!  If you don't get it yet...Steve has missed his opportunity.

SUN~I took some jeans back to American Eagle, and the girl gave me an extra $20 back...kick ass!!!  But then when I bought my other pair, she forgot to take the security thingy off!  Damn her to hell!!!!!!

MON~Went to rehearsal...talked w/ Jamie forEVER afterwards about stuff TOO MUCH FUN!  I love talking to her about stuff...she's prolly the coolest girl I know.  

TODAY~I went to the Madison County fair w/ my folks, Dave and his folks.  I pet the cows and the bunnies and looked at chickens the size of my torso and ate tons and tons of food.  I'm gonna halfta work out extra hard tomorrow to work off all that carnie food lol. 

I wish I was a cowgirl.  Yee-haw!!!

"event","Sorry, when I listed the people I missed in youth symphony I forgot Bruce (slapping myself).  I love Bruce he's the greatest!  We're gonna have so much fun next year!!!  Anywayz...


Today I watched movies...lotta them.  I watched Dirty Dancing Havana Nights (great movie must own), Van Wilder (another purchase), and Indiana Jones (already have them, got them the day they came out on dvd hehe).  Great movies!  Then I took a reeeeaaallly long shower.  

Bruce came to the muny concert tonight yay!!!  It looked like it was going to pour down rain any secound but thank God it didn't.  I'm sure it would have been quite amusing to watch me hobble back to my car, Steve in tow lol.  He is the greatest guy, but I just can't figure him out.  Does he like me at all or does he like me like me or what?  He's really hard to read.  But he did help me put my stuff in my car and everything.  He isn't sure if he can come with me to the homecoming this weekend...but I really hope he can!  I really want to spend some time with him.

David is over at Nick's house again tonight.  Prolly getting drunk......again.  Oh well he's the one who's gonna be sick in the morning.

See y'all later!!!

"event","So today I did a whole lotta nothing.  I was supposed to go to a muny band concert but my mom said that since my ankle was swelled up pretty bad that I'd better just stay home.  There goes $50.  Oh well, I'm only missing 4 this year anyway...unless something else goes wrong.  Knock on wood.........



Shea called me today to see how I was doing.  He might stop by tomorrow to give me a cd and all his old Triad shirts that he doesn't want now that he's going to college.  I just realized how much I'm gonna miss him.  When you have nothing else to do but sit on your bum, you think a lot.  He's been my best friend since like freshman year!!!  What am I gonna do without having him around to talk to?  Geez...I don't even want to think about it, but every time I hear from him thoughts go through my head.  


I miss youth symphony.  I miss Charles and Paul and Mary Ann and Drew (ohhh sexy man), and John the Narc of course.  I really wish that Steve was going to school around here b/c I think he could make it on trumpet next year.  Oh well maybe that Josh kid from SIUE will get it...he was sweet.  

Peace out yo!

"event","So I haven't written in a while.  I have good reason.  I haven't been home and I sprained my ankle...fun stuff ehh?  I'll write about everything here...


FRIDAY: I went to the St. Jacob homecoming with Shea and Joyce.  We didn't stay long though, b/c all those ""popular"" people wouldn't leave Shea alone, and he got sick of it.  We called Joyce's bf Joey and went and played tennis.  After that Chad came over to my house.  We ended up making out for about 3 hours...it was soooo much fun!  But nothing more than that.  Then we watched the South Park movie...fun stuff!

SATURDAY: Once again, I went to the homecoming, but this time I went with David.  We had an ok time, and after that we went back to my place to watch Pirates of the Carribean.

SUNDAY: Me and David went to the zoo, and he bought me a penguin.  Sooo cute!!!

MONDAY: Best and worst day ever!  I sprained my ankle playing tennis in the morning, and spent most of the day in the hospital getting it x-rayed and stuff.  After that, me and Jamie went to Wendy's before rehearsal and talked.  Then at rehearsal, Steve helped me get my horn out and everything...not like I could do it myself.  He was so sweet.  Afterwards, I called him over to my car to chat.  We ended up talking for a good half hour, and I asked him to come with us to the Troy homecoming this coming Sat night.  He said he didn't know for sure, but he'd let me know on Wed or Thurs.  I know that Jamie told me not to ask him but I can't help myself.  I really do like him.  What's a girl to do?

Today I've mostly sat around on my booty with ice on my leg, but tonight I have to help David sign up for his classes.  Then I gotta go to my grandpa's.  Boooring...

Peace!"

I talked to Steve today at my muny band concert (which went well...the concert I mean).  He was reeaal attentive at first.  I asked him if he wanted to come to the Highland muny band concert tomorrow night, but he can't b/c he has to go to UMKC to work on his dorm room or something...a house maybe I'm not sure he wasn't real specific.  Then, when I asked him if he wanted to go to the Troy homecoming the next weekend, he started to ignore me.  He would walk away while I was talking.  He said that he doesn't get out much, but he'd talk to me about it later...wierd.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!  If he doesn't want to spend time with me or talk to me, then why does he give me ANY attention.  I'm sooo confused.  Boys are stupid...no offense to boys that may be reading.  

Jamie's mom gave me some ""healthy cookies"" and they were fantastic!  She said she would make me a batch...or at least that's what I thought she said..hmm.  Not sure hehe.

          I have a boyfriend, and sometimes he's the greatest guy ever...but recently we've been having a lot of problems, and my mind has been wandering.  Is it bad to be able to come up with a list of guys you wish you could kiss?  B/c I have come up with one, and may pursue it if my bf doesn't shape up...
   But there's this one guy that I've had my eye on for a long time.  I just don't understand why I can't get him to like me!!  I would leave my bf for him in a second if he wanted me!  I just don't understand how I can get preppy, popular athletes to like me, but I can't get one great-looking, so sweet, incredibly talented trumpet player to fall for me!  I know he liked me once, but I had a bf...and then at this Bi-State festival thingy he gave me a massage and then I kinda started to like him...but then at this All-State festival he wouldn't even talk to me!  I don't understand guys they are so stupid sometimes.  He always says that he wishes he could find a girl that likes him...hello!!!  Can you say RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!!!!!  I think I'm going to ask him to come to a Highland Muny concert with me Friday night.  Hopefully he'll say yes!!!

Anywayz...what did I do today......
1)Picked up my senior picture proofs
2)Went with my bf to SWIC so he could take his placement tests
3)Had a horn lesson in the loop
4)Went to my muny band recording session
5)Thought about Steve...a ton (that's the guy)

         So last night was pretty uneventfull...we got out of rehearsal at 9:50, so I couldn't go do anything with Jamie.  It sucked...I was bored.  I came home and went to bed after watching Teacher's Pet on Toon Disney....fun, fun, fun.



Today was actually tons o' fun!  Really!  No tennis this morning again..too hot.  So I went to the rec center and worked out for about an hour, then met my mom for lunch and shopping in Fairview.  I bought a pair of capris and a pair of jeans at American Eagle (massive sale).  Let me elaborate......

                         Jeans...original price $48  price paid $21
                         Capris...original price $40  price paid $14

     After that I ate dinner with my bf David at Chili's, and then went to play pool with my old friend John who is down from good 'oll U of I.  We chatted it up and shot some balls until about 8:30....and now I'm home.  We talked about all kinds of stuff...from his college life to my lesbian experience...hehe.  Fun times.

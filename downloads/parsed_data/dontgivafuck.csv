i see the starving faces of panhandlers and the greedy faces of the rich
and i say fuck why am i here
why i have i been placed into a race that steels and lies and cheats
where people are only out for themselves 
who care about nothing except for where to get there next hit 
and then i scream outloud with such an utterly detestible rage 
FUCK YOU!!!!!"

"event","it figures the day i go to my therapy/counseling i get sick. wake up at 2 am tuesday morning with a swollen throat and all of that bullshit. all i've been eating is soup. my breath stinks. i am eating spagehtti o's now. i had to have something else.

everything has been alright. sis claire suggests i try and work on my anger issues. thing is, i haven't been getting angry lately. the only person(s) that make me angry anymore are jess and my dad. fuck them both. bah. 

i've been smoking lately. it makes me feel less stressed. 

we went to crystal's friday night. i snuck in. i got high off the atmosphere. some fags and lesbians bought me drinks. it was hot. i totally let go and danced like i haven't danced in forever. i felt free. i felt like myself. (i can't wait to go again.)

anyway. trying to write poetry when your muse sucks.... sucks. ha. yeah. everyone keep your fingers crossed that i get better. i don't need to miss anymore school.  i need to finish my homework.

out."

"event","we'll start with the least important first.


i don't have a date to homecoming, sadie, or prom. 
i'm quitting speech team/spring play because i'm not going to let my teachers treat me like shit. i'm not shit.
i hate my job, and i wish i didn't have to work with the video store.
my brother still isn't on good terms with me.
my aunt has cancer and less than 7 months to live.
my dad's liver is deteriorating. if they can't stop the deterioration (they might not), then he may day before graduation.
my grandmother has parkinsons and is getting sicker and sicker. older and older. when/if dad and aunt vicki die, she's gone.
when she dies, grandfather isn't gonna last.
when/if dad dies, i'm the only one in the family with enough brains and oomph to take over the stores.
if i take over the stores, that means no going to university of new orleans. no film school. no acting. no life.
we don't have money anymore. we can barely pay the water and electric bill. haven't paid a house note in god knows how long.
jess treats me like shit. she hurts my feelings. makes me feel like less than i already am.
i don't have any friends because i pushed them all away when i was with jess. it sucks. i sit at home on friday and saturday nights. i clean my room. i read. i bathe. i eat/drink/piss/shit. that's it.
my mom is getting more tired each day.  i'm afraid.
i'm afraid. 
i'm afraid.
i'm so fucking scared.
i miss ana. i miss megan. i miss rick. i miss farah. kirsten. everyone. if things were like they used to be, it may all be better. but they aren't. so i shut up.
i hate my biology II class. it's hard. and we probably aren't going to disect, says bonsall.
i'm sore. i start teaching cheerleading/tumbling on wednesday. i haven't practices or stretched in ages. i'm nervous.



this kind of got out of order. my bad. oh well.

i'ven't been enough for myself lately. i'm in a valley. no more mountain. if i can't be enough for myself, how can i be enough for anyone else?
when no one remembers to call. when i feel like a ghost walking through a wall. i feel it. i know i should feel something, but i don't know what. i'm in a wall. but i can't feel it. but i should. so i keep walking through things, trying to figure everything out, but it just isn't working. and i'm rambling. i can barely talk these days. i've been shakey. i've been moody. cold. and hot, then cold. the process repeats. 

sometimes i go to sleep at 9 and wake up at 10... and i have no urge to get out of bet. i could sleep for 12 more hours and it wouldn't be enough. i don't have the energy to bathe. to shave. to anything. everytime i think of getting dressed. hair make up clothes teeth everything, i groan inwardly because it's all so fucking boring. going to the movies, been there. done that and it's boring. shopping is boring. eating is boring. everything is boring. breathing is boring. life is boring.

i am boring. not even getting into stirring really makes a difference. what's it getting me? nothing. i haven't written anything worth writing lately. it makes me sad because that's what i am. a poet. and i can't even do that lately.

i'm sorry. i can't get all of this out the right way. i apologize."

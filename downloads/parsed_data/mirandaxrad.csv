But I got to go to the beach on Sunday & Saturday.  My nose is burned and I have white rings around my eyes from my sunglasses.  Hehe.  It was fun.  Dave brought a stereo and we played music before going into the water and while we ate, but this old guy came up to us and complained about the bad words.  Funny, but we had to turn it off.

*sigh* But it turns out we won't be getting a hotel room after all.  Just lazing away the rest of break at each other's houses.

I've come to the conclusion that I should never get my hopes up over anything.  Like the AFI concert, and then this Spring Break.  Both ended up disappointing me."

"event","Ahhhh it's the first day of Spring Break and I feel rad.

I'm over the whole cancelled tour.  And so far, everything is going pretty smoothly. I haven't spent any of my saved money, so I'll be able to finance my Spring Break plans.  :)  Me, Sydney, Danni, and Dave are going to rent a hotel room out in Daytona or Cocoa Beach and hang out in the area for a couple days.  Fiiinally I can get my tan back.  Since Sydney is of age, she may be getting a tattoo.  That's so awesome.  I'll probably get a temporary henna tat.  I'm actually going to wait a while before I get a real tattoo, but I'm definitely getting my lip pierced when I'm 18.  <i>Definitely</i>.  My mom said she'd kick me out if I got one, but I'm going to do it after I move out anyway.  Hehehe.  

Yeah.

This week's gonna rule."

AFI has cancelled the rest of their tour.  I read this at the AFI website.  This is... just..... OMG, unbelievable.  What the fuck, <b>3 days</b> before the fucking show.  I knew it!  Just knew it!  It was too fuckin' good to be true.

I am just sooooo completely unhappy right now.  Not sad enough to cry, but enough to lose my appetite and sleep all day.  I'm also feeling enraged.  Not at the band, but for this horrible twist of events.  I'm so unlucky."

"event","Ahhhh yes, I shall be seeing AFI once again this Monday, March 8, with Thursday and Coheed & Cambria.  Thursday!! I can't wait!  I hope I'll be able to stay after to try and meet them.  What if I can meet Geoff <i>and</i> Davey in the same day?!  That'd just make me the happiest gal ever.  

dkjeikfmesimcvmc,eigdkncx/  Weeeeeee!!!!!!! 

Sorry... just had a total meltdown right there, at the thoughts of meeting them.  

Well, I'll definitely write out a big review after the show!  Till then.."

"event","Yes... I've been forgetting to update.  Lately everything has been pretty uneventful.  School has been consuming my time.  I want to graduate riiiight... now.  Damn!  Still got one more year.

English is the suckiest class ever.  Die Huckleberry Finn, die!  We've been reading this novel for let's see... 4 weeks now.  God, we've been working on it for soo long, I think I will hate the book forever.

I've been feeling weird around Dave lately.  It appears that he treats me like his girlfriend.  Several people have noted this.  ""Are you guys going out?""  ""Is that your <i>boooyfriend</i>?""  Gah, I'm confused.  I <i>am</i> guilty of thinking about how it'd be if we went out, but I do value him highly as a friend.  I think I should like, kinda avoid him for a while.  Just lay low I guess, and see the outcome.

Ummm... I actually haven't listened to AFI for several days now.  My CD player has been rotating Thursday, From Autumn to Ashes, and Poison the Well.  I think I'll put in some AFI right now. Ahhh Synesthesia!!! <333"

"event","Ahh Friday.  And a lovely 4 day weekend to look forward to.  

Today, I got the usual funny little Valentine cards from my friends.  But Dave got me a balloon and some chocolates.  It wasn't necessary, but I was glad that he thought of me.  :)  I didn't get him anything special though... just a little card with some candy attached that I gave to everyone else.  I feel somewhat bad, but whatever.  He knows I think he's awesome.

It was great having 4 free periods today.  Except for english!  Grr..

So in conclusion, I had a very pleasant Friday the 13th.  The end!"

"event","Woooh... it's Friday the 13th tomorrow.  Awesomeness.  But ugh.. everyone's going to be celebrating the silly holiday tomorrow.  Now the spookiness of the 13th will be forgotten!  Oh well.

Dave asked me what I wanted for Valentine's Day.  I just shrugged; I don't really care for V-Day junk.  
He's a strange guy, and we have a strange relationship.  I like him as a friend on some days, and others I'm in love with him.  ...especially when he plays guitar while making up some improv lyrics.. even if it's just singing ""Ohhh Miraaaandaa"".  &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;

And I'm still sleeping on the couch.  I'm just too lazy to move everything back in my room.  Maybe this weekend.  Yump.  But oh!  I just remembered, me and Danni are going to Freddy's ""Valentine's day"" party on Saturday.  I heard he got a band to come play there.  Heh, it'll probably be a crappy starter band, but that's ok.  w00t for live music"

So today... was rather boring.  I never see Mike (that AFI kid I met) anymore.  It's like he switched lunches or something.  :(  Oh well, I would probably be too shy to talk to him again anyways.  

Me and my mom painted my walls red over the weekend.  It's pretty cool.  All my stuff is in the den and I've been sleeping on the couch the past few nights.  I can't wait till I can redecorate and reposition my furniture and such once the fumes clear out.

And.... well, that's all.  Haha, bye."

"event","Today was lovely.  Class was easy and laid-back and I have no homework.  Woo!  And my project presentation went alright, despite Andy's shitty contribution.  

This may sound shallow, but I have some stinking guy problems.  Two of my guy friends like me as more than a friend, but I, in no way, return the feeling and <i>never</i> will.  Everything is just sooo awkward when we hang out.  But the guy <i>I</i> like, Evan, doesn't feel the same way.  Yeah, I know what you're thinking.  Payback, eh?  Nah... We liked each other a lot last year, and everyone knew about it, but I was just way too shy to really open up to him.  Then we didn't see each other at all over the summer, and I suppose he lost interest in me.  :(  Since returning to school this year, he hasn't acted the same at all.  I'm like, just another friend.  It's frustrating. I keep telling myself to let go of him, but everytime I see him... *sigh* I just fall head over heels.  He's perfect.  And it sucks that I can't have him."

I still have to continue working on my history project. Argh, I'm never working in groups with Andy again!  He's such a slacker/moron/dumbass.  I can't stand him anymore!!  

Yeah... I better keep researching stuff now.  Bye!"

I hung out with Danni yesterday... went to the arcade and Sam Ash's, then ate dessert at Panera's.  Fun.  Sydney was supposed to come along, but she had to work on an English project.  Bummer.

I just finished a 2 hour workout a little bit ago.  And I'm pooped.  But, w00t, I'm ripped.  Hah, the computer and exercise equipment are all in one room.  How weird.  

So basically I have nothing exciting to share.  Maybe tomorrow, when the adventures at school resume..."

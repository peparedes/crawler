"event","well, today is the day, I finally get my 2 wisdom teeth and one molar out....yay! ( i think ) I've been suffering with these bad boys for long enough, though i am nervous about the whole operation. I hate needles, they scare me, but, it's for the greater good right? Luckily Rob is leaving work early to accompany me, that's at least a comfort! But I'm still scared , scared , scared!

  I had a pretty cool time the the other night, I went to Yellow Springs to get away before i had to do this. i stayed with my best friend Steve, Yellow Springs is an awesome little village, comprised of tons of artists and hippies, very comfortable little town. i got some great tapestries for our old farmhouse we just purchased, they look awesome, i can't wait to get this place totally fixed up and really show them off.
 
  The whole trip inspired me to get back into my art, i've been wasting it..it's been a bit difficult with work, five cats, a young hyper golden retriever and trying to get this house up to par, i'm getting antsy to do some stuff! can't wait till things start settling down! 


  Well, i'm off to the butcher to get these damn teeth out.

                                         Wish me luck"

"event","I've been sitting here reflecting on the past 2 years, how have I done it? The human endurance can be quite amazing!  Lets see, what has happened........well, I've come here only intending to stay for 3 months, being that the only reason for being here was the fact that my husband came here 3 months prior to my arrival to file for bankruptcy, in which we were forced into because his boss was a self- centered ass monkey who really didn't care how many bodies he trampled on on the way up!  That led us to having to start our lives over at least 5 times at least, and here we are doing it again.  This is the last time, finally!  I haven't been happy here, I can't work here, I've spent 2 years in my apartment, leaving only to see friends and family here,  It has taken a toll considering I never intended to stay this long.  I was happy in Dayton, I was close to family and friends, I could drive and do whatever I wanted too!  Here it has not been the case.  Since then,  i've been here I've been called a traitor by Americans who were coaxed into hating Canadians by the media, not even bothering to understand my reasons for being here in the first place,  I've missed out on the birth of a nephew, and maybe another one if I don't get home soon.  It's been hard financially considering I can't work here without a visa.  And I just miss fall in ohio, the mountains here are Beautiful, but lets face it , I wanna go home. And I wanna be there before Halloween.  There's nothing like going to Foy's in Fairborn at Halloween, they transform an entire street into costume shops, special effect shops, haunted houses, etc.  It's very festive for Halloween enthusiast such as myself. Here, Halloween barely exists, hmmm... i wonder why? I should ask Rob.  But it hasn't all been bad, I have made good friends here,  and I do have family here who do accept me,  I have had some good times here,  I ve seen some amazing wildlife and scenery,  I do have my kitties with me,  and best of all, I been with Rob the whole step of the way! Imagine if i'de stayed at home, we'de still be apart, that would have been the worse of all the evils.  As unlucky as I have been,  I've been extremely lucky to have him. So, when I look back at all of this , plus things I haven't mentioned, yeah i have to say that the human endurance is quite amazing!"

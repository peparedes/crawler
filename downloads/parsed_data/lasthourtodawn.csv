and to everyone who says stupid ass shit about bush, fuck all of you ass holes, hes here to stay for another four years so deal with it and quit fuckin whining, its getting old...

and to everyone who might be slightly offended by that, im just getting sick of everyone crying and not doing anything about it... and yes i do love george bush, i would marry him and proudly carry his name, but he doesnt think marriage should be changed to include gay couples as well.  by the way hes not a gay hater, and the 60 percent that voted yes isnt either, well some of them may be, but they just feel that marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman celebrating the joining of adam and eve... seperation of church and state can go to hell, everyone knows religion influences politics in every nation on earth and theres no way that we will ever get around it, so quit crying about that too...

fuck john kerry, bush is gonne be here for quite awhile yet..."

"event","i cannot believe that somebody actually reads this... nobody ever comments... eh, well yeah i almost died this morning... almost, oh well, maybe next time.  I stayed up REALLY late till like 6 AM and went driving like a fuckhead in the pouring rain and my truck was slipping all over and i almost went off road a few times (i was heading north on old 131 - now known as the east beltline/northland drive) and i wound up in Big Rapids when the rain slowed.  I was spending my 45 minutes on the way back listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers and i was really tired and i fell asleep driving and my truck started to drift off (bad news cuz i was going 75-80 with trees all around).  I was all the way off of the road and my truck went into the grass and it was super bumpy and i woke up barely in time to throw the wheel back to the road and skid a little.... the cluster of trees that i missed was about 10 to 15 feet in front of me when i swerved... to think that i was milliseconds from dying is a great thought... oh well, maybe I'll have better luck next time, eh?  Catch you later, maybe..."

Wake, Skate, Chill, Skate, Chill, Sleep.  But here's my little tweak to that.  Wake, Skate, Work or band practice maybe?, chill, skate, chill, play bass, chill, sleep.  it sounds great to me.  I'm not mad at anyone, i am not going to hold any grudges.  its all good."

"event","why did things have to take a hit like that? why can't they just go back to normal?  i was so happy before.  i thought that everyone else was too.  then things changed and now nobody else is willing to bring things back to normal.  maybe im just stuck up in the past.  well, what can i say?  and this time i didnt even do anything... theres an odd little change for once.  seeing as how im usually the center of every problem."

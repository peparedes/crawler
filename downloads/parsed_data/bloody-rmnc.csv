<P>he later called me in the night drunk; telling me i was a liar. he told me he'd call me in the morning to pick up my shit. (i doubt he'll remember this 'cause he was trashed, even though he'd hate to admit it)</P>

<P><IMG src=""http://www.crazewire.com/artwork/features/bands/cw.yyy.jpg""></P>
<P>this past <STRONG>friday</STRONG> <STRONG>was my school's guitar concert</STRONG>; it's where all the bands from my school preform. <STRONG>i was supposed to preform</STRONG> in it with my band, but some fucked up <STRONG>drama</STRONG> happened. this <STRONG>douche bag corey</STRONG> was supposed to my one of my band's guitarists. my band and i were practicing and he called us to practice with us, but of course we couldn't hear him calling us because we were too loud. so the little fuck <STRONG>went to brett's mom's work (my other guitarist) and started bitching at her about how he couldn't get a hold of the band</STRONG> and that he had to practice with us. brett's mom then tried to call brett, but of course we were practicing and so we couldn't hear the phone ring. she eventually got him on the phone and then started bitching about how <STRONG>she was pissed off that some teenager came barging into her work asking about him and how he couldn't get a hold of him.</STRONG> she put her foot down declaring that it was too much <STRONG>stress for her so she wasn't going to let brett play in the guitar concert</STRONG>. (oh yeah, corey also dropped out of the band) so we basically had <STRONG>no band</STRONG>, meaning that we <STRONG>couldn't play</STRONG>. (songs that we would have covered; <STRONG>i'm not okay, by my chemical romance</STRONG> and <STRONG>maps, by the yeah yeah yeahs</STRONG>)</P>
<P>i went to the guitar concert anyways to <STRONG>support max and his band</STRONG>. they were pretty good. <STRONG>max was extremly entertaining</STRONG>. i'm proud to say that <STRONG>he's my best friend</STRONG>. after his act i left for logan's to see a movie and get my mind off the sad fact that i didn't preform. half way there <STRONG>my car crapped out on 66</STRONG>. (just my luck! earlier that week my tire had popped too and i had to get a new one!) i sat there in the <STRONG>cold and rain waiting for a tow truck</STRONG> to come for my car. my car ended up not having oil in it so i filled it up. by the time the car was off the tow truck <STRONG>half of the oil had leaked out</STRONG> onto the ground. my car had a hole in the engine and it would cost way more than that pos's worth to fix it. so yeah my weekend was <STRONG>shot in the ass</STRONG>.</P>
<P>a turn of events though...saturday night my mom took me <STRONG>prom dress shopping</STRONG>. i got this awesome ass bright pink dress that looks hot as shit. cost? <STRONG>$300!</STRONG> i also got matching <STRONG>earings and a necklace</STRONG>. i'm going <STRONG>prom shoe shopping</STRONG> today after work.</P>
<P>yesterday i was sitting at logan's house pissed off about my car and unfortunate luck. my mom called me and told me she was on the way to his apartment and had a <STRONG>suprise for me</STRONG>. i figured it had something to do with prom. she called me again and told me that she was pulling into the apartment complex. i looked out the window for her car...but <STRONG>i couldn't find it</STRONG>...oh yeah, baby! my mom fucking bought me a <STRONG>brand&nbsp;new car! toyota carolla!</STRONG> i was so excited i literally <STRONG>cried</STRONG>. my new car was supposed to be my <STRONG>graduation g</STRONG>ift, but because i was carless and was in need of a new one my mom went of and got it earlier than planned. isn't that <STRONG>fucking awesome?!</STRONG></P>

<P>...<STRONG>happy anniversary, logan</STRONG>...</P>

<P>yeah, it's been <STRONG>a while</STRONG> right? <STRONG>no particular reason really</STRONG>. i've just been <STRONG>caught up</STRONG> in my own every day shit.</P>
<P>yesterday was <STRONG>logan and my eight month anniversary</STRONG>. we didn't really get to spend the whole day together like i'd have liked to. i had <STRONG>school</STRONG> in the morning while he had <STRONG>work</STRONG>. once i got out of school i had to go to <STRONG>work</STRONG>, and at around that time he was getting off of work. when i was done with work he had to go to his <STRONG>class</STRONG>, and i had to <STRONG>take picture with max</STRONG>. it was alright though 'cause<STRONG> we ate dinner together in his apartment and spent the some memorable time together</STRONG>. it's things like <STRONG>that in life</STRONG> that keeps me going. <STRONG>i love you, logan!</STRONG></P>
<P>i saw <STRONG>""be cool""</STRONG> at the movies. (<STRONG>twinkle twinkle</STRONG>, baby!) it was pretty good, but <STRONG>""the pacifier"" was just flat out cute as hell!</STRONG> (in logan's opinion it was <STRONG>too cute</STRONG>...but who says he has good taste in movies?)</P>
<P><STRONG>spring break is next week</STRONG>. i'm going to be so sad because <STRONG>logan is going away for five days to play golf with his dad</STRONG>. (i'm going to <STRONG>miss my loggy</STRONG>!) i'm probably going to go to the <STRONG>beach for part of the time to kinda get my mind off thinking about how my boyfriend isn't with me</STRONG>. goal? <STRONG>not to remember my spring break!</STRONG></P>
<P>alright i've got to get back to <STRONG>computer science</STRONG>. l8er!</P>

<P><IMG src=""http://www.brokenwindows.org/Franz%20Ferdinand%20Fibbers%2020031008/Franz%20Ferdinand%20Fibbers%2002.JPG""></P>
<P>i'd get all into my night<STRONG> last night</STRONG> for you, that is if i could <STRONG>remember</STRONG> it. i think i hung out with my <STRONG>dumbassadore</STRONG>, and then came over to <STRONG>logan's</STRONG> and got <STRONG>drunk</STRONG>. yeah...something like that.</P>
<P><STRONG>two</STRONG> <STRONG>nights</STRONG> ago i went over to <STRONG>john's</STRONG> and got <STRONG>drunk</STRONG>. i told him that i needed to be <STRONG>back at my car by eleven to pick up logan from work</STRONG>. it was <STRONG>nine</STRONG> o'clock when we were talking about this, and he <STRONG>promised</STRONG> me he would do <STRONG>whatever</STRONG> he could to get me back to my car by <STRONG>eleven</STRONG>. he told me that he would even call a <STRONG>taxi</STRONG> if he had to. we all decided to go to a party and left john's. on the way we went to <STRONG>wendy's</STRONG>. i stayed in the car and <STRONG>passed</STRONG> <STRONG>out</STRONG>, a few minutes later though <STRONG>i threw up</STRONG> like five times outside john's car. (ew)</P>
<P>when i woke up <STRONG>john</STRONG> was driving, and <STRONG>curby</STRONG> and <STRONG>sway</STRONG> were in the back of the car. i had <STRONG>no idea what was going on</STRONG>. i looked at the clock and it was <STRONG>ten thrity</STRONG>. john told me we were on the way to an open house party. i reminded him that i had to be back to my car at eleven and that i was now <STRONG>capable of driving</STRONG>. he told me he wasn't going to let me drive because he thought i was still drunk. when we got to the street of the party sway and curby left the car. <STRONG>john stayed and tried talking to me</STRONG>. i told him he <STRONG>promised</STRONG> to take me to my car and didn't seem to understand that i told logan i was going to do something, so i was going to keep my word and do it. ""rachel, you're like my best friend, but i'm <STRONG>single</STRONG> and i'm trying to go <STRONG>party</STRONG>. everytime i'm with you <STRONG>you're with logan</STRONG>, and..."" i cut him off right there. <STRONG>does that not sound like he was just looking for ass from me?</STRONG> regardless of the fact that he was drunk i felt so <STRONG>betrayed</STRONG>. i started curking out. he got pissed and started yelling at me and was like, ""<STRONG>i can't believe you would think that of me</STRONG> rachel, you know me <STRONG>of all people</STRONG>!"" he left the car with me in it, <STRONG>freezing my ass off.</STRONG></P>
<P>so i'm sitting in john's car, <STRONG>hung over, confused, hurt, crying, cold, and i had to pee</STRONG>. i ended up pissing in one of the cups i found in his car and threw it out the window. i called john's cell phone and <STRONG>sway</STRONG> answered. he asked me where i was and told me to stay there. <STRONG>he said he was going to come get me</STRONG>. i layed there for about fifteen minutes until sway got to&nbsp;the car. i started crying harder and told him everything that john and done and said. he told me that<STRONG> he didn't really care about john at the moment because he was being an asshole</STRONG>. according to sway <STRONG>he told john to take me back to my car and john refused to do it!</STRONG></P>
<P>sway drove me back to my car, but when we got there i realized <STRONG>john still had my keys</STRONG>. we went back and got them and then drove back to my car all over again. when i was about to get out of the car sway said, ""look rachel, just <STRONG>don't</STRONG> come around here for a while. don't call john and say <STRONG>sorry</STRONG> to him, you didn't do anything wrong. <STRONG>let him appoligize to you</STRONG>. he's being an <STRONG>asshole</STRONG>. if he doesn't call you and say sorry, i'll call you."" i thanked him about a<STRONG> million</STRONG> times before i drove off.</P>
<P>i can't believe that <STRONG>john</STRONG> was just going to <STRONG>leave me in his car that night</STRONG>. i could have gotten <STRONG>hypothermia</STRONG> or something. not only that, <STRONG>he broke his promise to me</STRONG>, and made me feel like a<STRONG> piece of ass</STRONG>. i <STRONG>haven't</STRONG> heard from him since, so i guess he really <STRONG>doesn't give a shit about me</STRONG> after all. it's crazy, <STRONG>you think you know someone</STRONG>...but you really <STRONG>don't</STRONG>...</P>
<P><STRONG>thank you sway</STRONG>, if you <STRONG>ever</STRONG> need a favor <STRONG>i'll be there for you</STRONG>.</P>

<P>well, fucking shit in a box! seems like we've got some <STRONG>catching up</STRONG> to do, eh?</P>
<P>i was at <STRONG>sunoco</STRONG> a few weeks ago buying some dough nuts. (oh, how <STRONG>double chocolate</STRONG> sounds right now...) after i had raped the shelves of double chocolate, i tried to figure out <STRONG>how to close the dough nut box</STRONG>...and the fucker <STRONG>wouldn't close</STRONG>. i mean it would, but <STRONG>i just didn't know</STRONG> how to close it. it had random parts sticking out and shit. you guys know what i'm talking about right? the boxes that you have to fold into a box? (don't give me that look i know <STRONG>you know what i'm talking</STRONG> <STRONG>about</STRONG>) eventually a clerk from the desk came up to me and asked me if i needed some help. (no shit) he closed the box for me and and then started to laugh and asked me if i knew what <STRONG>fluff</STRONG> was. (this is the good part...) he basically explained to me that<STRONG> fluff was the feathery stuff that's on pillows frilly-foo-foo shit like that. ""that's what you are,"" he said. ""fluff! youre real pretty to look at, but you serve no purpose. fluff is pointless, and stupid</STRONG>."" ummm, excuse me? but isn't he a<STRONG> sales clerk working at SUNOCO?</STRONG> even if i am fluff, you know have to be all open about that shit, do you?...what a <STRONG>jerk</STRONG>...</P>

(kinda <STRONG>creepy</STRONG>)</P>
<P>let's see, <STRONG>movies</STRONG> i've seen...oh yes! <STRONG>white noise and meet the fockers</STRONG>. i enjoyed <STRONG>white noise</STRONG>, it scared the ever living shit out of me. (yeah i'm a <STRONG>pussy</STRONG>, and what? at least i can admit it) the ending was kinda random and all, but over all it was alright. i never saw the moive before <STRONG>meet the fockers</STRONG> so i am able to say it was pretty funny. (keep in mind i have nothing to compare it to) most of the jokes were <STRONG>sexually oriented</STRONG>...<STRONG>not</STRONG> that i have a problem with that...</P>

<P><STRONG>logan's dad</STRONG> is going to buy me a new used car, because fixing my car will be&nbsp;cost <STRONG>more</STRONG> than my car actaully is worth. i'm supposed to go with <STRONG>kelly to logan's work</STRONG> to pick him up. after that i'm going to the <STRONG>junk yard to sell my car</STRONG>, and then try and get a hold of these people whom i'm trying to buy this car from. (thanks, <STRONG>kell</STRONG>)</P>
<P>i'm hoping shit will work out the way that i've planned them out to. if they <STRONG>do</STRONG>, i'll have a new car by <STRONG>tonight</STRONG>. if they don't i'm going to <STRONG>cry</STRONG>...yes cry...<STRONG>literally</STRONG>...like a little baby...kinda like this, ""waahhh!""</P>
<P>oh,<STRONG> i cut my hair </STRONG>finally. it's short enough to <STRONG>see the back of my neck</STRONG>. i'm planning on getting a <STRONG>neck peircing</STRONG> now.

<P>it's been <STRONG>crazy</STRONG>, and i mean<STRONG> fucking crazy!</STRONG> some of this shit <STRONG>i can't even believe</STRONG> has happened myself...bleh! so here i go...</P>
<P>after some <STRONG>christmas shopping</STRONG> two days ago i let <STRONG>logan</STRONG> drive my car back to his apartment. (logan has had <STRONG>two</STRONG> dui's) i guess he wasn't paying attention (duh) 'cause <STRONG>he crashed the car right into a stopped car infront of us</STRONG>. glass was <STRONG>everywhere</STRONG>! my hood was bent in <STRONG>half</STRONG>, and my radiator was <STRONG>leaking</STRONG>. (not a good sign) i jumped out of the car and said <STRONG>i</STRONG> was driving so that logan wouldn't get his ass hauled off to <STRONG>jail</STRONG>. i only have liability, so obviously i was <STRONG>fucked</STRONG>.</P>
<P><STRONG>logan told his dad</STRONG> about what happened, and he said that he'd <STRONG>cover for the money to fix my car</STRONG>. really though, he'd be better off buying me a <STRONG>new car of the same price</STRONG>. the amount that it's costing to fix my car is <STRONG>more </STRONG>than the shit box was actually worth.</P>
<P><STRONG>i told my mom</STRONG> <STRONG>i crashed the car</STRONG>, and she's real pissed about it. (not to mention that she's been pretty <STRONG>sore</STRONG> with me lately anyways)</P>
<P>i'm trying <STRONG>real hard</STRONG> to deal with the stress, but every time i think i'm able to breathe i get shit thrown on my shoulders all over again. (yeah, yeah, yeah <STRONG>max</STRONG>. accidents happen <STRONG>five minutes</STRONG> to and from your destination; i hear you!)</P>
<P><STRONG>my neck is pretty fucked up</STRONG> from this whole mess too. it was fine when i got out of the car, 'cause the only thing on my mind was, <STRONG>""holy shit, i'm going to die!""</STRONG> just when you think shit can't get worse, you best realise...it can, <STRONG>it can get so much worse</STRONG>...</P>
<P>i'm home for the <STRONG>holiday</STRONG>! (whoop whoop) i got my mommy dearest a nice ass <STRONG>jacket</STRONG> with (what it looks like) rabbit fluff on the inside. i'm digg'n it so <STRONG>i'm hopping she will</STRONG> as well.</P>
<P>i've got to crap so i'm cutting this entry off here. once again <STRONG>happy holidays to all</STRONG>, be <STRONG>happy</STRONG>, be <STRONG>safe</STRONG>, have a <STRONG>blast</STRONG>! peace!</P>
<P>""it's <STRONG>christmas</STRONG> time again. it's time to be <STRONG>nice to the people you can't stand</STRONG> all year. i'm growing tired of all this christmas cheer. you people <STRONG>scare me</STRONG>, please stay <STRONG>away</STRONG> from my home. if you don't want to get <STRONG>beat down</STRONG>, just leave the presents and <STRONG>let me be alone</STRONG>...""</P>

<P>i've been starting to come to <STRONG>school</STRONG>, and my god does it <STRONG>suck</STRONG>?! i'm waking up at five something every morning of the week days to come to school to <STRONG>fail</STRONG>. (awesome, just what every teenager in modern society should look forward to!) i've been skipping so much that it's <STRONG>so</STRONG> <STRONG>hard</STRONG> to move from class to class with out getting the strong feeling of wanting to just get into my car and <STRONG>dip the fuck out</STRONG> smacks me in the face. it sucks dude, it really does!</P>
<P><STRONG>caroline</STRONG> texted me last night saying that she wants to talk to me today after school. according to the plan we're going down to <STRONG>starbucks</STRONG> after school. (haven't been there in a while)</P>
<P>so i quit working at <STRONG>red robin</STRONG>. <STRONG>danny and i</STRONG> were sick of doing shit that we really shouldn't be having to do last week, so we both dipped the fuck out. (<STRONG>middle finger</STRONG> held high) we applied for a job a <STRONG>red rock canyon</STRONG>. i'm supposed to go in today to meet with the <STRONG>main manager to see if i got the job</STRONG>. we also applied to <STRONG>california pizza kitchen</STRONG>. <STRONG>logan</STRONG> is going to tell me if i got the job, or if there will be a spot open for me today after school. (not that i'll be able to find out right away, because <STRONG>my dumb ass left my cell phone at home</STRONG>) if i can get a job and ckp <STRONG>i'll take it over red rock canyon</STRONG>. ckp is a hell of a lot <STRONG>closer</STRONG> to me that red rock canyon!</P>
<P>i'm in <STRONG>computer science</STRONG> at the moment being bored out the ass. even though doing all of my work in this class with get me nothing but a big, fat, jucie <STRONG>F</STRONG> my teacher won't let me do anything else but <STRONG>work</STRONG>. (meaning i'm not supposed to be writting in my lj right now...oh what a <STRONG>rebel</STRONG>, eh?)</P>
<P>i'm going to <STRONG>close this entry</STRONG> now so that my ass doesn't get bitched at anymore by<STRONG> mr. fagington's</STRONG> ass. peace out, bitches!</P>

<P>being at school is absolutely <STRONG>pointless</STRONG>, but yet here i am again. now i remember the reasons that i wouldn't come to school. it's just such bore to hear and see the <STRONG>same things</STRONG>, the <STRONG>same people</STRONG>, just the <STRONG>same everything</STRONG>! senoir year needs to end real soon so that i can have <STRONG>my own life</STRONG>.</P>
<P><STRONG>yesterday</STRONG> after school, <STRONG>max</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>i </STRONG>talked about some stuff. he was pretty <STRONG>pissed</STRONG> at me for missing so much school and putting myself in this situation. (i think that's the <STRONG>loudest</STRONG> that i have <STRONG>ever</STRONG> heard max yell at me in my life)<STRONG> the talk did help</STRONG> though, and i hope that things aren't so tense between us now that we both got our feelings out.</P>
<P>after school i'm going to <STRONG>mason's</STRONG> house to pick up his <STRONG>drum set</STRONG>. i'm going to be <STRONG>rock'n out with danny and tyler</STRONG>. <STRONG>john</STRONG> was supposed to come with us but he has to drive his sister to md. hopefully things will run smoothly today.</P>
<P>alright, i'm going to try and catch up on some <STRONG>sleep</STRONG>. peace niggas!</P>

<P>so i'm being <STRONG>kicked out</STRONG> of annandale. (at least that's what the <STRONG>administration</STRONG> wants) i have missed so much school that i am not able to <STRONG>make up</STRONG> the hours now. mrs felix told me i should look into going to an <STRONG>alternative school</STRONG>, or just getting my <STRONG>ged</STRONG>. (i for one am not down with that) i'm suposed to have a <STRONG>court meeting</STRONG> next week at the court office. one of the ladies from the court is coming to my school <STRONG>today</STRONG> to talk to me about me missing school. she's going to basically give me a <STRONG>huge</STRONG> as warning. if i miss anymore school then i'm going to end up getting my <STRONG>driver's license taken away</STRONG> by the judge, get a <STRONG>parole officer</STRONG>, and get <STRONG>drug tested</STRONG>. <STRONG>i really can't get drug tested.</STRONG> if i do i'm going to be <STRONG>royaly screwed over</STRONG>, and i'll end up in <STRONG>ads</STRONG>. (yeah, bad times...but hi danny!)</P>

<P>i woke up this morning <STRONG>trashed</STRONG> from the night before. <STRONG>brandon</STRONG> was about to leave for work when i realized <STRONG>my car was gone</STRONG>...dude, where was my car? i back tracked the night unable to come up with any other conclusion other than <STRONG>i had let danny take my car</STRONG>, and he had been pulled over for driving drunk. from what my tiny memory could draw together i remembered that <STRONG>john</STRONG> and some girl had come over to play<STRONG> beer pong</STRONG>. afterwards they left, and <STRONG>i had given danny the keys to my car to go pick up chris</STRONG>. i remembered him getting here, and then the rest was kinda a <STRONG>blur</STRONG>. it's all good though 'cause <STRONG>danny and erica</STRONG> had ended up staying the night and <STRONG>tucker fucker's</STRONG> house, and got me <STRONG>denny's for breakfast</STRONG>.

<P>i'm now on brandon's computer with little miss erica by my side typing my <STRONG>hectic morning</STRONG>. i'm going to go plop off by <STRONG>logan's</STRONG> and see if he ever went home last night. peace niggas!</P>

<P>...<STRONG>boys smell</STRONG>, oh and<STRONG> happy turkey day</STRONG>...</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.dot-alt.com/MCRtitle.jpg""></P>
<P>i know that i haven't written in here for <STRONG>forever</STRONG>, but shit's been going<STRONG> up and down</STRONG> for me lately. before today i hadn't been home in about a <STRONG>week</STRONG>. (sweet but unsweet) my mom kept spazing out about how i've missed so much school and how i won't be able to catch up. (blah, blah, blah) maybe i should start from the <STRONG>begining</STRONG>...</P>
<P>the night i broke up with <STRONG>logan</STRONG> i was <STRONG>rolling</STRONG>. (in case you didn't know, there are such things as having a <STRONG>bad roll</STRONG>) i was an <STRONG>emotional mess</STRONG> (not that i'm not now), so it basically all went down hill from there. i hadn't drank anything during my roll so i was <STRONG>over heating</STRONG>. i thought that i should go to <STRONG>john's</STRONG>, because he'd be able to take care of me in this kind of a situation. i then remembered that it was a school night and that at 1:00am he'd most likely be sleeping. i then decided to drive to <STRONG>danny's</STRONG>. on the way i was going down a ramp at about <STRONG>40mph</STRONG> that was ment to be ridden at <STRONG>25mph</STRONG>. so, basically<STRONG> i crashed my car</STRONG> and skidded around some. i sat there <STRONG>crying</STRONG> for about thirty minutes. i saw someone pulling up behind me, so i put my car in drive and continued for <STRONG>danny's</STRONG>. i don't remember much of what happened that night, but according to danny and brandon i was in <STRONG>bad</STRONG> shape. my body was hot while in the mean time i was complaining that i was cold, and i was refusing to drink any water. i later tried to lick a <STRONG>light socket</STRONG>...yeah...<STRONG>bad night in general</STRONG>.</P>
<P>last night i went to <STRONG>logan's</STRONG> <STRONG>work</STRONG> to eat dinner with <STRONG>kelly</STRONG>. i couldn't help but be <STRONG>sad</STRONG> about him when he was telling me over and over again how sorry he was and how much he missed me. (yeah, i cried...)</P>
<P>afterwards i went to see <STRONG>saw</STRONG> with <STRONG>max</STRONG> who had happened to be having a <STRONG>shitty</STRONG> <STRONG>night</STRONG> <STRONG>like</STRONG> <STRONG>me</STRONG>. we spent our time bitching to eachother about shitty relationships. it felt kinda&nbsp;odd to be doing something that sinse<STRONG> i could never see us in that situation two and a half years ago</STRONG>...</P>
<P><STRONG>logan</STRONG> called me from his mom's house today, and i couldn't help but to get all <STRONG>emo chick like</STRONG> and shit. (whoopdy-fucking-doo) he told me that he would be at his house at around 6:00-8:00pm, but when i got to his house he <STRONG>wasn't</STRONG> there. as a matter of fact <STRONG>no one</STRONG> was there. well, there's <STRONG>logan</STRONG> for you!</P>
<P>i'm at <STRONG>danny's</STRONG> right now pondering about how my life has been for the <STRONG>past week</STRONG>. he's down stairs with erica. (happy couples make me sick) how do you get over someone that you were <STRONG>so attatched to?</STRONG> that you basically <STRONG>lived</STRONG> with, that you would take a <STRONG>bullet </STRONG>for, that was there to <STRONG>catch your tears</STRONG>, that you thought you could <STRONG>trust with the rest of your life</STRONG>...until he <STRONG>fucked up</STRONG>...i know i <STRONG>have to</STRONG> move on. that's <STRONG>why</STRONG> i ended it...but it's so <STRONG>hard</STRONG>. it hurts <STRONG>so</STRONG> much, and it feels <STRONG>so</STRONG> wrong. then again being with him <STRONG>hurts me just about the same.</STRONG> i'm <STRONG>confused</STRONG> and <STRONG>lost</STRONG> in my own world of emotions. i really wish that i had someone to talk to who <STRONG>understood</STRONG> the situation that i'm in, and who would be able to <STRONG>help</STRONG> <STRONG>me</STRONG>. life sucks, but i know i'm <STRONG>not</STRONG> the only one that feels that way. even though i know that i can't help but to feel that i'm all alone sometimes. i feel like i'm screaming in a big croweded room for someone to <STRONG>help me</STRONG>, for someone to <STRONG>save me</STRONG>...but <STRONG>no one</STRONG> turns around to even look at me. if someone does the only thing that seems to cross their mind is, <STRONG>""what's wrong with this chick? chill out!""</STRONG></P>
<P>moving on from the <STRONG>crappy past</STRONG> few days of me life...i had thanks giving with my mommy tonight. she was happy that i was there, and i had of course a bomb ass meal. (not that you all didn't, i hope)</P>
<P>i think i'm going to leave after this entry and try to <STRONG>deal with myself some more</STRONG>...</P>
<P><STRONG>i miss you logan, i wish you had never done what you had done. if that were the case, i'd be lying there in your arms as we fell asleep tonight...i love you...</STRONG></P>

<P>i <STRONG>didn't go to sleep</STRONG> last night, and i'm dead tired at the moment as i sit here in mr. billington's computer science class. there is of course a simple explaination for all of this; <STRONG>drinking plus sniffing equals good nights but bad mornings.</STRONG></P>

<P>last night <STRONG>kelly, max, mauricio, john, and i</STRONG> went to<STRONG> silverado's</STRONG> for dinner before the<STRONG> homecoming dance</STRONG>. (mmm...steak...) there were a lot of people from other schools there so the wait was <STRONG>unbearable</STRONG>. (don't you love the <STRONG>penis napkin</STRONG> you guys?)</P>
<P>afterwards we went to the dance for a little while. there were <STRONG>a lot</STRONG> of people there, but no one was really dancing. the dance was inside the<STRONG> gym</STRONG> this year as opposed to the<STRONG> cafeteria</STRONG>. you couldn't hear the vocals in the songs, because there was too much bass. all in all the dance kinda <STRONG>sucked</STRONG>. some of my lady friends were look'n kinda hot though!<STRONG> (you know i love you, christine!)</STRONG></P>
<P>a few of us left the dance kinda early since it wasn't too 'hopp'n' and went to <STRONG>geri's house</STRONG>. it was pretty chill. <STRONG>bloody marys, beer, mixed drinks, and good old fashion smoking just about made my night.</STRONG> mauricio was fucking drunk off his ass. he's such a crazy mother fucker, talking about christmas sex. (yeah i know you're reading this mauricio, and <STRONG>you know</STRONG> what i'm talking about!)</P>
<P>it's real <STRONG>ugly</STRONG> out today, and i kinda feel <STRONG>gloomy</STRONG>. (the weather reflects my mood way too much.) i think i'm going to try and get something <STRONG>productive</STRONG> done today...what that is i can not say just yet, but hopefully it will be something. ::rolls eyes::</P>

<P>do you ever feel like you've dug yourself into a <STRONG>huge hole</STRONG> and aren't able to get out? yeah, that's kinda how <STRONG>i'm feeling</STRONG> right now. i've got so much shit that's being backed up that i have to do. it feels like there are <STRONG>too many days</STRONG> in the school year, and <STRONG>not enough hours</STRONG> to support me with the things that i have to do. i'm sure<STRONG> i'm not the only one</STRONG> that's felt that way...</P>
<P>i saw <STRONG>coheed</STRONG> last weekend at the <STRONG>9:30 club</STRONG>. a whole group of us were off to scavenger tickets from people in line. we got lost a few times so the other car of us <STRONG>went to george town to get drunk. danny, erica, and i</STRONG> eventually found the fucking place. after asking around for tickets, we went in and enjoyed an <STRONG>orgasmic show</STRONG>. we had a fucking <STRONG>blast</STRONG>, and it was&nbsp;<STRONG>amazing</STRONG> to see coheed live.</P>
<P><STRONG>homecoming is coming up soon!</STRONG> this <STRONG>friday</STRONG> is our game, and <STRONG>saturday</STRONG> is our homecoming dance. max and i have picked out a dress, but thus far i can't seem to find any <STRONG>shoes</STRONG> that will match me dress. i'm going to go shoe shopping with <STRONG>amanda</STRONG> sometime this week, and she'll help me out. (thanks sissy!)</P>
<P>we're starting <STRONG>nutcracker</STRONG> at my studio, and so far i have to learn <STRONG>two solos</STRONG> that i know of. i think i might have to <STRONG>miss the bon fire tonight</STRONG> at our school due to rehersal. (poop!)</P>
<P>i've really got to start to get<STRONG> more sleep</STRONG>. it's getting <STRONG>cold</STRONG> in the mornings now, and i'm so warm in my bed that i don't want to get out of the body heat that surrounds me. don't you <STRONG>hate</STRONG> that? my house is like a fucking <STRONG>ice box</STRONG> too, so the that doesn't help at all! it's almost about time to start breaking out with the <STRONG>hot chocolate in the mornings before school!</STRONG></P>

<P>so <STRONG>michael made his speach</STRONG> in the last dance team practice that we had about beccie. he basically told&nbsp;everyone that <STRONG>he didn't want people talking shit about eachother on the team</STRONG>, because we've <STRONG>never</STRONG> had a problem before.

<P>...getting <STRONG>down</STRONG> with some of that <STRONG>yeayo</STRONG> tonight, bitches... </P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.razorandtiemedia.com/photos/brand%20new%201_72.jpg""></P>
<P>i went up to <STRONG>phili</STRONG> this weekend for my business meeting with <STRONG>quixx</STRONG><STRONG>tar</STRONG>. after seeing some of the <STRONG>millionaires</STRONG> that have come out of this business, i'm pretty damn confident that my life will be <STRONG>straight</STRONG> after a year or so. i met more inspirational people in the matter of <STRONG>one</STRONG> <STRONG>day</STRONG> than i have my entire seventeen years of living. i'm down for this shit nigga! </P>
<P>on the drive back from phili <STRONG>danny, john, and logan were getting shit faced</STRONG> off beer and liquor. john passed out in the back seat of my car, so danny <STRONG>pissed in an empty bottle and put it in john's lap</STRONG>. john unconsciously started to <STRONG>hug</STRONG> the bottle of piss for warmth in the middle of his fucking sleep. (what a trip)</P>
<P>&nbsp;after showering from the trip, we all headed down to <STRONG>drew's crib</STRONG>. his mom's out of town till <STRONG>tuesday</STRONG> so i guess you can figure what's been going down, eh? </P>
<P>i slept in like a bitch today. i was fucking tired as shit from being up for over thirty six hours. (the again who the fuck wouldn't be?)</P>
<P><STRONG>john's getting us our oz. of yeayo tonight</STRONG>. (good times, good times) it's about god damn time!</P>
<P>i'm pretty fucking pissed off at <STRONG>steveo</STRONG>. he found out about<STRONG> whitney and danny</STRONG>, and totally blamed it on <STRONG>logan and i</STRONG>. that's pretty fucking <STRONG>stupid </STRONG>in my opinion. i never told whitney to do what she did, i just told her to do what makes her happy. (isn't that what friends are for? not to tell you what to do, just make sure you are happy and satisfied with life?) at the time steveo was being an <STRONG>over controlling bitch</STRONG>. (well at least from what i could understand from whitney) steveo has cheated on whitney before. he's actually done it recently too. she found an IM on his computer talk to some ashley girl. she was talking about how she was sick, and how she <STRONG>wouldn't be able to kiss him anymore</STRONG>. steveo's response to it was that he was sick too, but when he felt better they would be able to <STRONG>kiss all that they wanted</STRONG>. really now, who the fuck is the <STRONG>asshole</STRONG> in this relationship? after calling me all sorts of names and shit, he trys to get the hook up for a ball from logan. he was like, <STRONG>""this is all business, and has no sort of relationship through it.""</STRONG> whatever mother fucker! if that's the case he can get his yack from someone else, 'cause logan only deals to <STRONG>friends/ people he can trust</STRONG>. if steveo wants to go talking shit and say he doesn't want to be our friend, he's counted<STRONG> out</STRONG>.</P>
<P>we've learned our <STRONG>first game dance and home coming dance for dance team</STRONG>. it's fucking <STRONG>hot</STRONG> as shit! we've got <STRONG>chairs</STRONG> and everything. <STRONG>michael</STRONG> knows what's up, niggas!</P>
<P>it's about <STRONG>five oh five</STRONG> now, so my lazy ass is about to go get <STRONG>humanized</STRONG>. peace.</P>

<P><IMG src=""http://www.planetverge.com/Senses_Fail/sensesfail_002.jpg""></P>
<P>sorry i haven't updated this shit in a <STRONG>while</STRONG>. i've been busy for the past few weeks helping <STRONG>logan</STRONG> move into his <STRONG>new</STRONG> apartment, and living up the <STRONG>last</STRONG> few days of the <STRONG>summer</STRONG> as much as i could. awww, speaking of summer...it's <STRONG>gone</STRONG>! ::tears:: <STRONG>school's</STRONG> started up now, and my classes really <STRONG>aren't</STRONG> that bad. i've got like <STRONG>two</STRONG> classes with <STRONG>max</STRONG> this year, and a <STRONG>lunch</STRONG>. ::good times, good times:: the only truly shitty thing about school (other than the fact that it's school...) is having to wake up <STRONG>early</STRONG> and find a fucking parking spot. that shit fucking sucks!</P>
<P><STRONG>dance</STRONG> <STRONG>team</STRONG> has started up again. there is a <STRONG>new</STRONG> girl who has been shit talking <STRONG>all</STRONG> the members on the team. i've gotten permission from the captains to bitch her out about it. who the fuck does she think she is? she's a fucking <STRONG>freshmen</STRONG>, and she's talking shit about all of <STRONG>us</STRONG>? some of us have been on this god damn team for fucking <STRONG>four</STRONG> years. what a worthless little fat ass. get a <STRONG>life</STRONG> bitch, and get a fucking <STRONG>face</STRONG>! bitch looks like she's fell out of the <STRONG>ugly</STRONG> tree, and hit one <STRONG>too</STRONG> many branches on the way down.</P>
<P>i got <STRONG>wasted</STRONG> as shit last night. (nothing to be proud of though...and you'll see why) <STRONG>andrea</STRONG> came back from collage and held a huge ass <STRONG>party</STRONG> at her house. we all went and got <STRONG>drunk</STRONG> as shit. i was too fucked up to drive so <STRONG>logan</STRONG> had to. half way to his house i fucking stuck my head out my car window and <STRONG>puked</STRONG>. logan pulled into an empty parking lot and left me puke some <STRONG>more</STRONG>. there was fucking puke all over the<STRONG> side of my fucking car</STRONG> when i looked up! i even managed to some how get puke on his <STRONG>toes</STRONG>. the mother fucker <STRONG>cleaned</STRONG> that shit up for me and drove me back to his house. now that's <STRONG>love</STRONG> right there bitches!</P>
<P>i've got to get ready for <STRONG>guitar</STRONG> <STRONG>classes</STRONG> in just a few. take care all!</P>

(thanks for the <FONT color=#3366ff><STRONG>love john</STRONG></FONT>!) the night wrapped up with a nice walk through the <FONT color=#3366ff><STRONG>sprinklers</STRONG> </FONT>in the yard.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3366ff>school</FONT></STRONG>...<FONT color=#3366ff><STRONG>dance</STRONG> </FONT><STRONG><FONT color=#3366ff>team</FONT></STRONG>...yeah...<STRONG><FONT color=#3366ff>fuck</FONT></STRONG>...</P>

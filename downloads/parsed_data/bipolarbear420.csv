It was so fun there for a while going to clubs and hanging out with the girls. But the girls suck ass now so whats a bitch to do? I dont know. Maybe I will call Laura and see if she wants to hang out and show me her new titties. LOL. well, I am gonna go lie around in the bathtub and write some poems or songs or something like that. Bye."

"event","Yeah, thatS my ghetto name, get it and get it right. So yeah, I am sore. I hate the zoo. I hate the bus ride to the zoo. As we were driving thru the U of M campus, I got to looking and thinking. All these fucking college kids, many my own age, run-walking to who the hell knows where. Classes i suppose. Look at those HUGE backpacks. I'd rather have a diaper bag. I decided, college is for some but not for me. college is retarded for me. Anyways, I was watching these people coming and going, and i am so glad they were.  i am so glad they can deal with the college bullshit. who else would run my future world. who will teach my son when he goes to school? who will run the bussinesses? who will be my psychiatrist? Who will stick a needle in my back and administer the epidural medicine for my next 42390482903 kids?  and whatever else those crazy people go to school for, who will do those things? they will. so, i decided not to glare at them, i smiled at them. i am sure some of them on the bus thought i was a nut case. well, i am. RAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA. sorry. SO THANKS ALL U COLLEGE KIDS FOR DOING IT BECAUSE I SURE AS HELL AM NOT! THANK YOU!"

"event","Hi. Last night was stupid. I HATE Stephon Dwayne Aaron. He is a big peice of shit (same color, too) and he is a BITTER BITCH. He will never get over me. Never. I dont want to sound conceited. It's just the truth of the matter. Yeah, I cheated on him, 5 fucking years ago. We both have significate others whom we have children with and he still cant let go. Not in a ""I miss you so much, I love you"" sense, but in a ""I fucking cant beleive you cheated on me, you hurt me so bad, and i am a big fucking baby who cannot seem to let it all go"" kind of way. And I think it is so stupid. I mean, I always act like a normal person around him and he acts like a childish little bitch. I don't understand it. I cheated on him and thats because he cheated on me so i didnt give a fuck. I dont care if i hurt him, I am glad i did, that was the whole point. But ya know, it needs to be dead by now. Its over with and time to move on. I guess the only thing i can do is just ignore him. Just cut him back out of my life like i had before. I dont know why i thought it owuld be a good idea to see him again and try to be friends. He will ALWAYS be the same old BITTER BITCH. The End."

So I am just sitting here listening to incubus and smoking CIGS. Ewe! I dont even know why. It's freezing in here because i left the door and windows open. Such an ass. So last night was ridiculous. I went to the club with Sarah and Bridgette and Bridgettes friend. It was ok. Sarah was bitching that she wanted to get home to her cry-baby bitch boyfriend. When we finally left (keep in mind that we didnt drink) The idiot Sarah told Bridgettes friend to drop us off at our parking garage. Well Sarah picked the wrong garage and i didnt know. So we walked around for 2 hours through 3 different parking garages. FREEZING. No coat, slutty club clothes on and platform sandals. I took the sandals off and walked all around downtown barefoot. Very healthy, Lisa. Anyways. So anyways. We finally found the car and I took the bitch home and went back to my apartment. Washed my face and changed and then drove over to Danielles house and we got really high. Then at 5am i drove to my moms and crawled in the bed and crashed. She took care of Shaun all day and I slept. I was thankful. Anyways. I hate my friends. They are man-obsessed idiots. I am with Shaun and I don't ditch out on my friends because of him. He and I do our own things on the weekend and thats what keeps us together and in love. These girls are retarded. So yeah, I cannot think about it cuz it makes me want to beat them. So, hopefully someday some people will read this. Bye!"

I was so tired from being up until 6 am the night before. Oh well. Then we went to HarMar and i bought a new outfit from DOTS. It's really cute. Then we went to Laura's house and met Colleen and Remi there. The 3 boys played. Then me and Colleen left and went to Brooklyn Center to buy a tree. Then we drove back to my apartment and smoked a blunt in the parking lot. Good, I loved it. Anyways, i have to go put this little monkey boy down for a nap."

Colleen and I smoked a fat blunt and then sat in my bedroom and laughed at the boys for like an hour while Shaun Sr. played party poker. It was funny. I need to start taking Shaun to ECFE playtime again. Maybe when it gets over 30 again. Shaun has a hard time keeping his hat on and staying under the blankets while he is in the stroller. I didnt drink last night and I woke up very nauseous. Or however you spell it. It's bullshit.I am supposed to get my period on the 11th. So we will see. Maybe Colleen and I will be pregnant together again. Then Laura will have to do it too so wecan be the same again. That would be crazy, thats for sure! Anyways. I think I want to have another baby. Double-strollers lookso fun. Plus i like when people in public fawn over the newborn. It's fun. I want a girl. I dont know.I am going to go suck some money out of shaun sr.  hahaha.

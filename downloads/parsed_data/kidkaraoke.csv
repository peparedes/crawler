"event","sometimes things are easy to not think of, but hard to forget. 

i wish someone would come play music with me. i wrote a bunch of stuff on vacation that would probably make for good songs. i found a lot of stuff in old notebooks. i like to look in the old notebooks and revise, then put it away for another year so i can do it all again occasionally pulling out lines or pages to use for songs. 

distractions are so cool."

"event","mary mother fucker. i said that to my mom once and she got pissed at me. my dad made me apologize, but that has nothing to do with what i'm thinking right now. 

i just turned 22. i hate girls right now. i love honesty. i need my license. 22 and no driver's license. i never drive. i just get others to do it for me. i pay for a car though...(results, not excuses)

my eyes feel like the desert. where's my fucking oasis? my site for sore eyes. my cozy bed with a girl that's true in it. if i can't trust the one that i ""love"" and have ""loved"" for quite some time, then who can i trust? i don't want to only trust myself. i want hope. i need it and i need a lot of it."

Sails are limp

Sea is calm

Lifeless ship

Bow your head

Step ashore

Skyline strong

Sandy floor

Disembark

Virgin eyes

Touch me soft

Gentle child

Leave a mark

I was here

Untie knots

Leave me dear

Waves grow high

Feel the swell

Pulling Moon

Lunar spell

Paint the sky

With our hands

Water dunes

Foreign land

Salty lips

Sun bruised hair

Far from home

Still right there

Endless trips

Battered shoes

Liquid roam

"event","one morning a couple months ago, i woke up with a knife under my pillow. it was one of those slicing knives you use to cut carrots, or potatoes, or apples with. the tip had been bent a little. i looked at the wall above my bed and saw some marks. i didn't know what had happened. my neighbors believe in putting rocks, and other miscellaneous items, under your pillow to help you have good dreams, or sleep, or whatever. i don't believe them, but i wonder what a knife is supposed to do to your dreams. i know that while i've been sleeping at my parents house the past couple of days, i've been having some very frightening dreams right as i'm going to sleep. i don't remember any of them, but i know they make me feel deathly afraid. they truly scare me. it's a new bed in a freshly painted room. maybe it's the paint. maybe it's my parents house. i just don't know."

"event","I know a man. He has all the right answers, and yet has problems of his own. He can tell me advice that is always right and true. He is the most accurate, correct person I've ever known. Everyone else but him is stupid. He never tells a lie. He is never wrong. He solves any problem with the flick of his tongue against the backs of his teeth. He has figured God out and knows more than He. He is the master of the universe. He knows everyone well. His knowledge surpasses knowledge itself. He is an ultra-genius surpassing the level of mega-genius that Einstein was at. Tell me what to do, oh, all knowing. Your measly existence can tell me everything.

I'll never ask anything of you again."

"event","i love it how often change runs through me. sometimes it doesn't even feel like i'm changing at all, but i know i am. it's just not as obvious or noticable. some good people tell me all the time to ""do big things. dream big no matter how small it looks from far away."" i agree. i'm beginning to break down anything i don't want to hold me back. somethings i want to hold me back, but most things i don't. in the words of that band i don't like called the killers, ""i'm breakin' out of my cage and i've been doin' just fine"". i know a lot of people have missed my bright eyes. i'm so much better when you can see my pupils. my father once asked me where the little me went. he said i used to be so excited and full of energy. now, i don't say much at all and sit on my ass a whole lot. i know he feels guilty for this, though, because of my childhood. because of him telling me to shut up all the time. he feels he's shut me up forever, but he hasn't. i've only just begun. i've spent the last 5 years or so in a state of numbed observation. now, it's time to do something big. it will happen. just you wait."

"event","last night i had yet another weird dream. it felt like i was at work in the big kitchen at the bakehouse, but really i was in a normal kitchen in some random house i didn't recognize. somebody wanted a lox, so i had to toast the everyseed bagel. it took a long time for the bagel to pop out toasted, so when i went to check the toaster, there was a pickel jar blocking the bagel from popping out. a fucking pickel jar. i took a knife and pushed the pickles. the bagel was burnt. some guy with a broom told me to remake it.

first it's ex-girlfriends chasing me with a bloody butchers knife, then it's dying birds, and now it's pickel jars in bagel toasters. what will be next? 

do these dreams have any meaning?
no, no, i think it's more like a ghost
that's been following us both
something vague that we're not seeing
something more like a feeling"

"event","i had a dream the other night. there was a table full of birds in a row. the birds looked similar to finches, but they were green with bits of yellow and orange on their wings. there was one bird that was particularly brighter than the others. it stood out, so i wanted to touch it, or pick it up. i went to pick it up and as soon as i touched it, it fell off the table and died just like that. the rest of the birds proceeded to loose all livelihood and then turned into fake, hollow birds. i was filled with disappointment and confusion. i turned to my friend jake. he was getting something out of the refrigerator."

"event","this room is hot and it makes my head hot. maybe it's because i'm wearing this hat for no particular reason other than to keep it on my head as to not lose it. i should leave. go outside and explore. i'm too afraid and i don't know why. i've never known why and most likely never will. here we go with this train wreck of emotions and self pity. fuck me. fuck what i think. fuck these things i feel. stop giving a shit, elliot. new orleans is drowning, though, and i can't help but give a shit. cemetaries are flooded and souls are being released. mother nature is the biggest terrorist. let's kill it."

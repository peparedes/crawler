"event","Wow, today was an exciting one.  I woke up and saw I had 4 missed calls and 4 text messages from Rachel whom needed a cigarette rather badly so I went over to her house and rolled a cigarette and we both shared it.  Last cigarette of the day for me but whatever I guess.  Then I went and chilled with Alex at her house.  Then we picked up Christina and went to the Fair which was alright except for the fact that it was early and there weren't too many people.  So Alex and I decided to go to my house and chill for a little bit until 6ish when people would actually be there.  While we were at my house I decided to ask her out one more time and this time guess what she said?  Just guess.  Yes!!  I was the happiest at the time then I've been in a long time.  So hooray for Alex and I.  Well that's all that's basically happened since I last updated.

Peace"

"event","So lately I've been kinda bored and I've missed hanging out with Alex as much as I did last week.  Hopefully things go better in the upcoming week.  Hmm... what else?  Oh yeah, the fair is going on now so maybe I'll go  chill there.  I don't know, it seems like Alex and I fight more now then we did before.  Kinda makes me wonder.  I don't know, I've just been down lately this week and I don't know why.  Maybe it's cause of all the fighting with people.  Someone please make me happy as this week sucks so far.  I realized last night that I need to stop smoking since I had an emotional breakdown when I remembered that I left my tobacco in Lennie's car and I couldn't get it.  Kinda sad how addicted I really am and all of you smokers out there that say you're not addicted are lying your ass off.  You just don't realize it until you can't get one.  So stop your phony bragging and realize that you're addicted.  Well I'm gonna bounce since I don't think you guys really wanna listen to me complain about my life....

"event","So the past two days have been filled mainly by hanging out with Alex.  I eally enjoy it so I'm not complaining.  Well yesterday I went to St. Paul to skate with Matt and PJ.  It was pretty tight.  I indyed the Big 3 and Matt varial flipped it.  Then we went to the four and i fakie half-cabbed it.  Then we went to Saturn 10 and I tried it but kicked out with about 3 steps left and we got kicked out after that.  My heels ae bruised for now form it but I'm gonna go back and do it as soon as they heal.  I was supposed to hang out with Alex today but she woke up late and had to get a hair cut and go to a paRty so there wasnt any time for me.  I was actaully kinda sad that I couldn't chill with her.  Hopefully I can tomorrow.  Like it's weird.  I hang out with her and I actually miss her if I don't see her for a couple days.  Probably think I'm a fag now but I don't really care.  Well I think I'm done rambling for now.

Take Care

"event","So last night I talked to Alex about how I felt about her and we both agreed to give it a little more time until we decide what happens.  That makes me happy to know that she digs me. :)  Today I went skating in St. Paul with Matt and Kyle which was fun.  I did my first handrail which was exciting but very tiresome.  My legs are dead as fuck.  I can hardly walk but oh well I'll live.  Then we went back into to town so Matt could charge his camera.  After that we went to Burnsville Skatepark which gets kinda boring after awhile but it was a nice cool down session.  Then I headed back into town and sat at Subway for a little bit until I had to go home.  Now I'm here at home playing Omerta which probably doesn't suprise many of you but I don't care whether you like it or not.  Well today was alright except for the fact that I kinda missed hanging out with Alex since she was at some family reunion but oh well.  We're gonna chill tomorrow and go to a movie and shit.  ;)  Well I think I'm done rambling for now so I'll talk to all of you guys and gals later. Take care

"event","Well back again for another entry.  So I spent most of the day playing Omerta, but then my mom told me I was done being grounded and it's 2 days early so I was pretty happy about it.  So I decided to hang out with the person I like and see if we had any chemistry.  We went to Burnsville Center and walked around and talked then we went back to her house and watched The Rocky Horror Picture Show which is a fucked up movie but I think I kinda like it.  I was amazed cause usually when I meet people I don't talk a lot but with her, we couldn't stop talking.  I'm starting to like her more and more and I think I might ask her out soon but I think it might be too early to do it now.  I don't know I guess we'll find out.  Hopefully we end up dating.  She's just so amazingly gorgeous and we talk about the weirdest but coolest things.  She's very easy to get along with and talk to about anything so hopefully everything works out between me and her.  So today has pretty much been the greatest day of my life considering I got ungrounded and I hung out with one of the coolest people I've ever met. Well I think I'm done for now.

"event","So I haven't updated in awhile since my internet has been hacked by a million viruses but now that that's fixed expect more updates.  I haven't been doing much of anything lately since I've been grounded for sneaking out to go skating with Matt.  Kevin's come over a lot lately which is tight since it gives me someone to chill with.  Steph and Frank came over the other day and that was tight.  Steph's an effin awesome person.  It's impossible to make her mad.  Frank's just funny looking, but in a good way.  Then today Morgan was supposed to come over since she promised me she would even if she had to walk which if she wouldve it's like a 1/2 mile walk.  But she ditched me.  I spend most of my day and night talking to people on AIM and playing Omerta.  On AIM I've met an amazing girl that I seem to have a lot in common with and I'm starting to like.  But it's too early to decide.  Well I think I'm done because I'm tired of rambling about nothing so I'm done.

"event","Wow...today was a hot one.  I woke up and did chores....again..since according to my mom I didn't do them well enought the first time.  Like they always say, if you want it done right then you gotta do it yourself.  After that I went and hung out with Morgan and Sami which was fun for the most part. During this time Nicole called and asked what I was doing and when I told her I was hanging out with Morgan and Sami she hung up right away.  I don't get what that was all about, but to me she seemed as if she thought I was the most retarded person in the world for hanging out with them.  Then Sami left to go to a movie with her grandma which sucked cause shes always entertaining.  I like hanging out with Morgan, but when it's just us two, none of us talk very much.  I don't know if shes afraid of me or maybe its me.  Sorry Morgan, I'll try and talk more next time.  Then Lennie called and wanted me to toke a joint with him so i went and picked him up and we went back to my house and smoked it.  It felt pretty good.  Thanks Lennie.  Then we went and skated Rosemount Skatepark and sweated our asses off like hell.  By then I was dying of heat exhaustion so we went to Subway and got a drink.  By then I had to go home and eat dinner with my mom which was gay as always.  I can't stand being around her.  Today she called me a fuck up and the black sheep of the family.  That oughta boost my self-esteem.  So to let off some steam I went and picked Lennie up and we went back to Rosemount Skatepark and skated until I had to go home.  And here I am now, at home, writing this.  I think I'm gonna go have a smoke break.

"event","Today was an alright day.  I woke up and did my chores which is gay as hell and then I drove into town and picked up Kyle and we went to Matts'.  We skated his box for a little bit then I went shopping for groceries with Morgan and Sami which was very interesting.  They are gonna suck at being adults when it comes to shopping for food.  It takes them forever to decide on what they want but oh well, I still love em'.  After shopping we went back to my house and chilled until they had to go home.  Then Kevin called and wanted to hang out so I picked him up and we went and skated Rosemount Skatepark which is way better than FSP.  I did alright; could've done better but oh well.  Then Kevin had to be home so I dropped him off.  Then Nicole called and wanted to hang out so I picked her up and we hung out for about an hour before I had to be fun.  I love hanging out with her; she never seems to disappoint me and she doesn't bitch at me for stupid shit.  Then I dropped her off and came home to listen to my mom bitch about how I never do anything around the hosue even though I cleaned and mopped and did everyones laundry.  I do that about 3 times a week so I don't get what the fuck she's complaining about.  Then she bitched at me cause I wanted to stay out later and hang out with Nicole.  I don't get why I have to be home at 9.  She tells me that that's when she starts to get ready for bed and she doesn't believe I'll come home when I tell her I will.  It's great to know that your parents don't trust you at all.  My family is really fucked up and she wonders why I never wanna be home and eat with her.  First of all, eating with her basically means that shes gonna bitch at me until shes blue in the face and by then I'm pissed as fuck and I just leave. Well know that you know why I'm always so pissed and shit(that's another reason I smoke cigarettes, to get away from her shit).  But I think I'm done rambling for now.

"event","Ahh, another entry.  Today I woke up to Sami calling me and asking if I wanted to hang out with her and Morgan at Crystal Lake, so I went.  It was alright except for all the fucking sand in my shoes and how hot it was and people that shouldn't be wearing swim suits were.  I hung out there for awhile until Lennie called and told me to pick him up from work so we could go skate MPLS.  He had to walk a mile to my truck because the god damn Pan-O-Prog Parade blocked off everything.  Once he got there we went back to his hosue so he could pick up his board and change clothes.  Then we headed to MOA and once we got there i went and bought some wax and a Bob Marley shirt thats tight as fuck.  Then we left for MPLS by way of the lightrail.  Once we got there we skated the Government Plaza for a little bit until a security guard chased us out.  Then we skated Nicollet Mall which is one of the tightest spots in my opinion.  But we got kicked out of there.  You would think that on a Sunday there would be less security guards then on a weekday but it's so not true.  We got kicked out more today then on a weekday.  After all this we were pretty tired and my leg was fucked to hell so we left for home.  Once back to Farmington I stopped at Subway and bought a sub.  Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki, very good, I recommend it.  By then I had to go home so here I am now typing this shit.  That's all for now.

"event","So today was an alright day...could've been better but I have had worse.  Anyways, my mom and I finally went and cashed my check and im using $100 of it tomorrow to go skate Minneapolis with Lennie and someone else, we don't exactly know who yet...we'll figure that out later.  But today I went to MOA and walked around a lot.  I wanted to skate but it was too motherfuckin hot out.  I did skate Matt's mini-pipe for a little bit but then once it got darker I went to FSP and skated with Mike and some other kids.  The I went to the high school and skated the loading docks there which was fun for a little bit.  By then I was tired as fuck so I went to Subway....again....and hung out with Lennie and Shawn and Derek and Mike.  The Mike needed an amp so we went to my house and I let him borrow mine.  Then I came home and I'm pretty sure my moms either drunk as fuck or tired as hell...I don't know which yet but I'll find out somehow.  Today's been a lame day not skating that much but oh well, I guess I'll live going one day without skating.  Tomorrow will be fuckin tight as hell skating Minneapolis on a Sunday when there aren't any fuckin Pigs.  So wish me good luck and I'll post tomorrow once we get back.

"event","So today I woke up to the sound of the Mexican's mowing my lawn and the hot sun shining through my window which made me sweat.  What a great way to wake up?  Anyways, since I was up so early I decided to wash my truck considering Flagstaff makes me truck dirty as fuck.  It was quite hard to wash considering everytime I went to dry it the sun had already done it which caused my truck to have streaks on it.  Didn't turn out the way I wanted but oh well, I'll live.  Then I decided to go skate before I went and hung out with Nicole.  That was alright except Farmington Skatepark sucks huge ass.  Then Nicole called me so I went to pick her up.  Then we went to Rainbow  in Apple Valley so she could see Matt.  She talked to him for awhile then we left and she called Alex whom she was supposed to hang out with later.  Alex told Nicole that she had to come over right then so I dropped Nicole off at Alex's.  It was disappointing considering I really like hanging out with Nicole.  She doesn't bitch like a lot of girls.  Then Andre called me and wanted to skate and he told me he was going to be at Matt's so I went there.  We skated Matt's mini-pipe for awhile then decided to go to the Burnsville Center so Andre could get some shit.  He got a Dimebag Darrell shirt at Hot Topic and Pimp Juice Energy Drink at Spencer's.  Then we went to Farmington Skatepark and shredded for awhile which was alright.  Then I had to go home to eat dinner with my mom which sucks ass hugely.  Then I came back into town and met Andre, Kyle, Tyler, and PJ at FSP(Farmington Skatepark, I'm tired of typing that shit) and shredded for awhile then tryed to skate Ace Hardware but that was a huge bust within 2 minutes.  By then I had to go home so I left and took a shower once I got home which was very relieving and now I'm typing this.  So I think I'm done for now.

"event","So today Lennie and I decided to go to Minneapolis to skate.  We took the light rail which is way cheaper than gas, but make sure u pay for your ticket now. I'm used to not paying and never getting fucked but today a fuckin cop decided to check everyones tickets and of course Lennie and I didn't have one.  So he pulled us off the light rail and asked for our ID's and he wrote our names down and made us buy a ticket whish is only like $1.50 but I'm poor, I gots ta pay for gas.  But paying for the ticket is a lot better than paying the $190 fine for not paying.  We just told the Pig that it was our first time riding it and we didn't know you had to pay so we didn't get a fine.  Then we finally got to Minneapolis and we skated these tight ass ledges that aren't too high but aren't too low either so that spot was pretty G until another fuckin Pig kicked us out.  After that i thought the rest of the day was gonna blow but it was Pig free which is good.  Then we stopped at Fobia and checked out the Fobia video, ""All-In"".  It was alright considering I've seen it about a gazillion times.  So we skated a little longer then we headed home.  When we got back into town we stopped where Lennie works which is at McDonalds in Lakeville.  We got 20 chicken mcnuggets for $2.79 since he gets a huge ass discount.  The we skated Lakeview Elementary which is right by Antler's Park.  It's a small loading dock which angle iron and a bank going up to it so you can ollie from the bank and do shit on the ledge.  It's a rather tight spot.  Then we headed back to fuckin Subway.  I don't get why we go there so much, maybe it's because we get free shit.  But anyways, we saw J motherfuckin Griff there who's a tight ass rapper from Minneapolis and told us he'd give us his new cd next time he sees us.  Then I headed home and now I'm currently watching Chapelle Show Season 1 which is funny as fuck.  So I'm out for now.

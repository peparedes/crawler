<P><FONT color=#99ff99>So, I woke up today round' 11:30, and I layed in bed for another half hour, doing nothing, and then I got up and took a shower. All I have to say about the new curtain in the shower is that its dumb. So then I lounged around for a bit more because I didnt have class until 2:00 joy. So then I had class from 2:315 and then at 410-525 with the same damn professor. Yeah hate his classes.</FONT> <FONT color=#ccffff>So then I came back and I hung around, went to eat with Nicole, Chris and Matt- oh the thought of AVI food *gags* So I just got back from getting free condoms downstairs, haha, I wanted the suntan lotion- go figure it did not come in the mail yet. So here I am, and I am putting off doing my paper thats due Friday as I said in the previous entry. But I should go- and do something more productive than this, thank you to everyone who has added me to their list so far! Yay! I miss you all back home, I think about you all the time *tear* </FONT><FONT color=#ffff66>bye bye sweetie pie(s)</FONT> </P>"

"event","<FONT color=#ccccff>Okay, so how do I get more friends? Haha, I do not know what I am doing with this site, but its kinda fun. So today is Sunday and I have a shit-load of homework I need to do, but I probably wont get anything done. I have to go turn in our housing application *crosses fingers* anyways, I can't wait for Spring Break, although none of the girls back home have the same one as me- which makes me sad. I miss them.&nbsp;Anyways, I have to go get dressed- and I will probably post again- bye :)</FONT>"

"event","Hey, yeah this is pretty cool, I can't figure out some of the things I want to because I am so tired- I hope you enjoy my site, and although these journals never really last long (because I never update them) this is a new attempt. I hope to meet some new people and keep in touch with some-so as for now this is what I've got."

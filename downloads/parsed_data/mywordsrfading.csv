A girl and guy were speeding over 100 mph on the road...


Girl: Slow down. Im scared.

Guy: This is fun!!!! Hold on to me.

Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!

Guy: Then tell me you love me.

Girl: I love you, please, slow down.

Guy: Now please give me a big hug!

*Girl hugs him*

Guy: Can you take my helmet off baby? It's bugging me..


In the paper the next day: A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of break failure. 2 ppl were on it but only 1 survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realizd that his breaks broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him &felt her hug 1 last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die.


if u love someone this much...let them no..and put this in ur profile"

This world that I found is too good to be true.
Standing here beside you,
I want so much to give you 
This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you.


Let them say we're crazy.
I don't care about that.
Put your hand in my hand, baby, don't ever look back.
Let the world around us just fall apart.
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart.


And we can build this thing together, 
Stand in stone forever, 
Nothing's gonna stop us now.
And if this world runs out of lovers we'll still have eachother.
Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now.


I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you, 
Whatever it takes to stay here with you.
Take it to the good times, 
See it through the bad times.
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do.


Let them say we're crazy.
What do they know?
Put your arms around me, baby, don't ever let go.
Let the world around us just fall apart.
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart.


Oh, all that I need is you.
All that I ever need.
All that I want to do is hold you forever, forever and ever."

I actually had a super time hanging out with him. We got in one little argument but then he dropped it. 
Last night though we got in a huge fight. I started crying it was very sad. He was telling me how he wants me to be the happiest i can be and all sorts of stuff like that. And i just started crying. What did I ever do to deserve him. He soo amazingly good to me. He makes me sooooooooooooo happy. 

Matty, im so sorry for anything i have put you through and if i have ever hurt you im soooo sorry. Its never my intension to hurt you. I LOVE YOU!

I wish i could just rewind back to where i first screwed up and do it all over again. Its hard waking up everyday and trying to feel like everything is the same that i never hurt my dad or anything. But i did. and it hurts me. All i do is screw up. Its like things can never be the same between me and my dad again. He told me he can never trust me again. and it just hurts. i want to be close to my dad. its just not going to happen after everything i did. No matter how many apology letters i write him. no matter what i do. It wont be the same. Now its hard for me to get out of this house because im not trusted and im grounded for all of eternity. Im only allowed at certain places. Like matty's or Ashley's. Thats it. Im just a big letdown to everyone in some way or another.

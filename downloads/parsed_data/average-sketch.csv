oh john, how do you do it. how do you live in your black out curtain fortress of smoke and herb, a mental cage made manifested by your lack of reality. how do you shelter yourself from one another seeking nothing and misplacing everything. seeking solace in your preservative jars of addiction to the un-addict-able substances that you swear by. i drove by the fortress yesterday, to let loose my own insecurities upon you in an anger fueled car ride. i wanted find my own solace in the knowledge that you were far worse than my own pathetic excuses. 

i left cold. i circled and saw empty windows, as if you are the only one left to keep the memory of such a horrid place. A lone scribe, of antiquated haze filled yesterdays."

"event","so i got hooked on the arctic monkeys about two to three years ago, and i had only ever seen one of their music videos. i decided that was an injustice since i thought every song of theirs deserved a music video... so i did what any sensible youtube addict, and looked them up... and i was not prepared for this. 

this was so fucking awesome i can't believe i didn't think of this. the song itself just seemed so anthem-ic to me and this video took it to another level. its so fucking intense throughout the whole thing. way to go monkeys... way to go.

"event","my intentions fell like shards of delicate glass, cutting small insignificant lines between my fingers. the forces from the center of my being are telling me that somethings horribly wrong. so much in fact that i feel evil... deep, unquestioning evil. my beliefs are failing me, my techniques are crumbling, loosening the foundation of my psyche to the point that i can feel it all rushing back again... and again... and again. 

and yet, the the point of origin is shadowed. it feels deep and foreboding, almost like I left something of sever importance behind. A deep gut feeling, physical and emotional and immediate all at the same time. i have to focus to breath and force to eat, i am an emotional husk now. I'm a hypocrite. 

stop

what does this mean? do i really feel like this. am i blowing things out of proportion again. so many things have changed in my life, not for the better... but also not for the worse. they have just changed. i'm afraid that i don't fit anymore. i feel like the puzzle piece your so sure should fit in that last hole in the beautiful picture that no matter how many times you twist, push, shove, and force, it still doesn't fit just right. 

is that alright. to not fit, it has to be. 

so lets break this down

whats wrong?
im angry and depressed

why?
because things have been falling apart and the status quo in my life has shifted

why?
because people feel it necessary to do stupid things and create drama

why?
because... i don't know... they feel it necessary

why?
maybe they feel the same way

why?
because maybe they're world feels dashed and hopeless too

why?
maybe they don't fit either

summation...
everyone feels like this... and if one person can get over themselves long enough to work out others problems maybe they will realize this too... and the cycle will end.

but i ask you, is it possible?


--------


supine. a word i learned the other day. it means literally, ""to lay on ones back and stare aimless up."" thats it, no more no less. its not emotional or dramatic, descriptive or indicative of anything else. you can be here, there, alone, with company, any day that feels good or bad, inside or outside... alive or dead. yet it describes so much more than that. sure its a verb, sure it is what it means. but laying on ones back staring into the void that is the sky, the night or the sun, ones mind wanders. thoughts creep around, vanish, build and snowball off of one another. you drift to thoughts that show just how insignificantly small you are in the world, and yet so huge and encompassing. 

this world is full of mysteries that are so astonishing that words don't do them justice. you can say something so profound and earth shattering as ""everything is made up of mass that can't be destroyed or created,"" a principle law in any scientific theory, and humanity will brush it off and not give it its due worth. we can't fathom that nothing can be destroyed, and that its just changed into something else. a fire burns logs into a gas that is released into our oxygen rich environment. water is turned into water vapor. we've all heard this, all have learned this. but we don't take it far enough. there is a set amount of mass in the world whether it is oxygen or carbon or some other element.

what about us. humans, animals, our things. can't we apply this to ourselves. we don't die because we quite literally can not be destroyed. so what happens? we are changed. 

lets back up real quick and go back to the elements that i was talking about. once again someone can make the case that because everything is made of carbon everything is connected... while this is partially true (there are other elements in the periodic table other than carbon so therefore there are differences in ""everything"") its not taken far enough. so lets take it a step further. all elements are made up of atoms... all of them. so therefore everything is made of atoms. so once again we can say we are all connected that way. however atoms ARE different depending on how they are made up. electrons differ from each atom depending on the element they make up. 
now we come to a delemma...atoms are the smallest known unit of measurement, period. and if they are different, well doesn't that prove that there is no connection between us and anything? well, yes and no. atomic differences have shown that there are clear differences in different elements, otherwise there would be no reason to classify them as such. however in the ladder we have been climbing down to prove everything is connected, humanity has stopped there because going any further was futile. why? because from all our studies into finding what makes up an atom, all we have been able to find are insignificantly small amounts of randomness. 

random. basically everything breaks down to random bits of random things come together at random times. we are made up of randomness, literally.  and it makes sense. think about everything that goes on in your life, anything that has happened to you and will happen to you. its all random. you never know what will happen because its random, and things that have happened to you you can look back at and say ""well that sure was random."" where you live, who your with, where you were born what you had for breakfast this morning, the drama that is occurring in your life... its all random things happening at random times because of random outside influences effecting you at random intervals. we are all connected through the random, because we are made up of random and we live in random. nothing will ever be certain because it can't be and never will be, because if things were certain in life then our functionality in this world would cease to be... well... functional. 

this idea of everything being made up of, what we can now call a noun, random can be tied directly into this idea that nothing can be destroyed or created. 

if there is a set amount of random in the world, then the world never increases or decreases in mass. therefore when we die our mass is just re-structured into something else. our essence, or our soul if you like, therefore reacts in the same way. its not destroyed its just assembled somewhere else. not like reincarnation where ""you"" personally are brought back as something else once you die. i mean, sure, its possible thats how the world works... but who knows for sure. maybe your ""soul"" is just wiped clean, or maybe its something completely different. but what i do know for sure, is that if you can not destroy or create anything, then Jesus had it right when saying, ""do unto others as you would do unto me"" and ""god is at work everywhere in your life and the life's of others."" he was speaking literally not figuratively... and yet religion still screwed it up...

god is the noun ""random"", and we are random. therefore everyone, everything and every experience that takes place in this entire universe and beyond is what i have come to understand as god. and if that is true if everything does make up god, that makes ""me"" singularly, so amazingly small and insignificant... however without me, god will not and cannot exist... so at the same time, i am unquestionably and without doubt severely important.

this... all of this... is MY definition of supine... 










































please don't think I'm stoned while writing this. because I'm not, i swear. please give this a chance, I'm sure I'm not the first to think of this and i won't be the last. this caution was meant to prepare you because I'm diving head first into something that shattered me to the core. if you don't agree, thats ok but please just hear me out"

"event","so my last entry was anger... so the logical progression would be to float to depression. which, without fault, it has. so i finally broke down and told what must never have been told, the fear that i fought so long against, the undeniable center to the fortress of my emotions. and it went well... or so i thought. untill i put two and two together and realized that that kind of thing has a tendancy to change how people look and act around you, and whether or not they trust you or not. it sucks... i mean, fuck alchol has a tendancy to ruin lives in the worst kind of ways... go figure that it would ruin something other than my liver..."

"event","i have seen good people do horrible things, i have seen good men stand idle at the hands of their oppressors, i have seen the collective let an individual fall, i have seen hypocrisy plague my immediate world. Someone must have stated the later before me, but the truth is not falliable because of its recurance. I can document my life in college to this point. 

1.) unbelievable bliss and happiness, new experiences, new friends, new life
2.)extremely loneliness, regret and depression, resentment and jealousy
3.) another high period full of fun adventures with old friends.
4.)deep brooding annoyance, carefully said words and hopes that things will change
and
5.) realizing that the friend base i associated with are a bunch of backstabing, spineless creeps not worthy of yeilding sympathy. 

the world is cruel, and it took one of my friends being savagely called out on a stage  in front of a bar full of people... and me being the only one to stand up for my friend... then being called an over-reactor because i did the right thing, when so many people wouldn't.

well you know what! FUCK YOU ALL!!! YOU DON""T FUCK WITH MY FRIENDS! I WOULD EXPECT ANY OF MY FRIENDS TO STAND UP FOR ME IF I WAS BEING ATTACKED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. AND YOU STOOD BY AND LET THIS HAPPEN! DON'T TELL ME THAT IT WAS NOTHING! IT WAS SOMETHING HUGE AND YOU BRUSHED IT OFF YOUR SHOULDER BECAUSE IT WASN'T YOU BEING ATTACKED. HOW CAN YOU BE MY FRIEND WHEN IN A BIND I KNOW I CAN'T RELY ON YOU. SO WHERE THE FUCK WAS YOUR REACTION YOU FUCKING DOUCHE BAGS. WHY DON'T YOU GROW SOME FUCKING BALLS AND STAND UP FOR ONCE IN YOUR FUCKING LIFE TO SOMEONE THAT ISN'T A FRIEND TO ANYONE BUT INSTEAD IS A FUCKING ANTAGONIST TO ALMOST EVERY SINGLE MOTHER FUCKING PROBLEM IN YOUR LIFE, YOU SPINELESS TWITS! HOW DARE YOU TAKE HIS SIDE WHEN YOUR ""FRIEND"" IS CRYING INTO HER PILLOW BECAUSE OF HIM!!! HE'S THE ONE WHO WAS BLATANTLY WRONG. ARE YOUR PERCEPTIONS OF RIGHT AND WRONG SO ASKEW THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL THAT! WHAT THE FUCK, WHAT THE FUCK, WHAT THE FUCK!!!! HOW CAN HUMANITY ALLOW THEIR FRIENDS TO GET FUCKED OVER WHILE THEY SIT AND WATCH AND DO NOTHING AND SUCK UP TO THE LOSER KNOCKING THEIR FRIEND OVER BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE NEXT! STAND UP AND TAKE CHARGE OF YOU MOTHER FUCKING LIFE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW... YOUR NOTHING MORE THAN MAGGOTS TO ME... LIES... YOUR LOWER THAN MAGGOTS... YOUR NOTHING BUT HALLOW HUSKS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BE GOOD AND RIGHTEOUS.

I HATE THESE PEOPLE MORE THAN I HAVE EVER HATED ANYONE... WAIT THATS NOT HATE... THATS FUCKING DISAPOINTMENT IN THE MOST SEVER USE OF THE WORD!

GROW UP YOU FUCKERS!"

"event","the inevitable occured, the brutal catch-offguard-mind-fuck-extrodinare of a talk about ""glorious roomate's"" downfalls. for the past couple months (aka the past year) you may recall the many rants in which I bitch and moan about chad's behavior. well i want you all to know that angry sean was finally unleashed last week. there has only ever been one other instance in which angrysean has revealed itself to the unknowing public and those who were close to the event can vividly remember it, so restating it would just be dredging up old wounds. 

getting back to the topic at hand, it went down like this. Sean got pissed, Sean verbally assulted piss-off-ie and sean left the ultimatium: change or get out (in so many words). 

and despite this being less overblown than the last revelance, i can say that good actually came out of this one. because change has occured and i think chad is officially scared of me... which only time will tell if thats a good or bad thing. muhahaha.

anyway, does anyone get on livejournal anymore?"

"event","it has come to my attention that in light of my past posts... my life seems to the casual reader to be one that closely resembles a person on the verge of anger induced comatose. not one hundred percent true, considering this is an outlet i use when i need somewhere to complain privately from the prying eyes of facebookies and myspacers. 

however, i must say... this whole blasted weekend was an utter failure to lift my downed spirits. seeing as i don't feel the particular diction needed to fully address my deep seeded feelings on these particular subjects, lets make a list shall we?

1.) firstly, we start on thursday. i am kicked out of my house (aka, parents house) seeing as i am not worthy of my dads presence... again. go see pirates of the carribian... return home when mother calls balling about how i ran away... again. yes, the ironic situation is dastardly annoying. by the by, thank you alex for saving my life there.

2.) Friday i make the mistake of telling my parents i was thinking of cutting my hair. parents immediately drop me off at cost cutters with twenty bucks. the fucking lady cuts my hair COMPLETELY off. i now look like a ten year old boy. 

3.)leave to work in south park moving wood friday night.saturday morning a tree falls on my head and manages to cut my wrist causing it to bleed purfusly... now i look emo, and i have a headache

4.) get a call from chad saying they're going to the drive in. im still in south park... i get pissed because he always does this sort of shit.

5.) i manage to return home (aka fort collins appartment) in time for the movie. i get home and taped to the door is a letter saying that the deposit for the apartment was declined and that now its going to cost me 390 dollars. i curse... danielles little brother gasps... bad.

6.) i leave the letter at home and go to the mall to get candy for movie. go to atm... my card is declined... i currently have eight quarters to my name. i go into nervous melt down mode.

7.) return home and call parents and inform them of situation. dad refuses to talk to me  because of #1, and i have the worst nervous break down i have ever have. i have never felt so completely hollow and utterly dead before and i never want to again. it scared the hell out of me. 

8.) return home sunday because grandparents come in. go to eat at aunts house with the whole family. cousin comes up to me crying and asking if i could drive him somewhere. i say yeah, and we get in the car and drive to a park where a group of his ""friends"" are. he gets out and launchs himself at a girl. i rush out of car and pull him back. apparently the girl suckered punched his girlfriend, breaking his girlfriends nose, minutes before and he was out for revenge. it wasn't fun. something happened in which my fore head split open. i think i recieved the blunt force of a stray punch... i don't remember. 

9.) return home and grandmother reminds me i need anger management... long story, if you really want the details ask me. i also find out that chad has a party with all of our friends at OUR appartment, and forgot to tell me. 

10.)monday, memorial day, we have everyone over our house. my cousin matt calls our house and asks to talk to my aunt. we learn that heidi (matts ex-girlfriend and mother to his child) is in jail, but thinks she'll be out in time to pick up alezea (the child in question) from my aunt kathy's house. matt called to tell my aunt to not let her. my aunt breaks down.

11.) once again my cousin from 8 comes to me not crying but almost. his dad called and informed him that he wasn't going to be able to make it to his high school graduation because he didn't want to spend the money on a plane ticket. my aunt from 10 stops breaking down long enough to curse the hell out of him over our phone for ten minutes. then goes back to breaking down. 

12.) through out this my father and i still haven't talked. he wont make eye contact with me. and ive seen chad and he still hasn't told me. 

im waiting for the trampling to stop... maybe then we can all get drunk and have a smokin good time."

"event","my eyes drooped lazily in and out of focus. fuzzing the air and giving off an uncomfortable aura in the bunker that was supposed to be my room. i felt immobilized and fragile, yet heavy and warm. i could feel how comfortable the spot i was to fall in the next few moments in every fiber of my being. my senses screamed for me to stop resisting and just give in. yet i felt a pressing need to maintain some sort of grasp on the waking world, if for nothing eles but to see what happened next. I remember hearing strange muffled sounds that reminded me of an old horror film, which would have frightened me if not for the pressing matter to drift into the abyss of REM. the cold concrete walls that looked metalic in the fuzz, seemed to bend around me and shoot upwards. a sense of vertigo unlike anything i have ever experienced enveloped me. i felt lost in gravity, lost in space, lost to conscienceness. how wonderful a feeling it was to feel like i was drifting upward, like i was draped over a giants arm who carefully lifted me upward with tender hands. 

than nothing. suddenly and abruptly i was nowhere. it surprised me that the overwhelming emotion and bliss i felt before, directly lead me to an abyss... or rather a sort of pergatory of black. than the strangest thought crept what little conscienceness i had left. 

i wish i could remember what it was."

I was driving up from Tampa
When the radiator burst
I was three sheets to the wind
A civilian saw me first
And then there was the cop
And then the children standing on the corner
Your love is like a cyclone in a swamp
And the weather's getting warmer

I was getting out of jail
Heading to the Greyhound
You said you'd hop on one yourself
And meet me on the way down
I was shaking way too hard to think
Dead on my feet about to drop
Went and got the case of vodka from a car
And walked the two miles to the bus stop

Got on the bus half drunk again
The driver glared at me
Met up with you in Inglis
Thumbed a ride to Cedar Key
If we never make it back to California
I want you to know I love you
But my love is like a dark cloud full of rain
That's always right there up above you





NO CHILDREN
(this ones my favorite)


I hope that our few remaining friends
Give up on trying to save us
I hope we come up with a failsafe plot
To piss off the dumb few that forgave us
I hope the fences we mended
Fall down beneath their own weight
And I hope we hang on past the last exit
I hope it's already too late
And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
Someday burns down
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
And I never come back to this town
Again in my life
I hope I lie
And tell everyone you were a good wife
And I hope you die
I hope we both die

I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
I hope it bleeds all day long
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
We're pretty sure they're all wrong
I hope it stays dark forever
I hope the worst isn't over
And I hope you blink before I do 

Yeah I hope I never get sober
And I hope when you think of me years down the line
You can't find one good thing to say
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out
You'd stay the hell out of my way
I am drowning
There is no sign of land
You are coming down with me
Hand in unlovable hand
And I hope you die
I hope we both die"

"event","the stairs felt like another snow covered mountain needed to get over, with every path iced over so that im bruised when i get to the top. there was a goat to the side of me, he told me to turn around and go back to the kitchen and get some food. i brushed the goats advice off and decided that i needed to brave my way to the top. there was nothing eles to do, it needed to be done. yet at the same time the song ""pink"" by areosmith was stuck in my head and completely confused me... what the hell, im braving an ice covered stair case to the top of uncertainty and one of the most pointless songs to my plight is running through my head as if it freakin owned the place. once again i brushed it off to coincedence. half way up this mountain i remember what waited me at the top. an ogre the size of texas and a fairy of misdirection who needed an attitude adjustment. i stopped. what the hell was wrong with me? it was about this time that gene simmons appeared out of no where and things got crazy. he pointed to a cave that said plastic surgery next to it and beckoned me in. instead of heeding his gesture to this mysterious cave i magically conjured the sword of a thousand hells and slaid the now monsterous dragon with the tounge of death previously known as gene simmons. once his head stopped wriggling on the ground, the carcas exploded sending back to the kitched where i was stupidly eating oreos with peanut butter and watching some weird skit show devised by the mentally retarded... i think it was called saul of the mole men. it kinda freaked me out, so i smashed the television with the jar of peanut butter, climed in, and beat the shit out of its creators. 

it was at the point when i entered the television that i knew this was dream, and the coolest thing happened... i had my first lucid dream. i ended up releasing the spawns of hell upon my enemies (aka teletubies, barney, the wiggles, seinfeld... pretty much any show ive found to be a hazard to my health because of how stupid it was.)

i wonder what this says about my character..."

as one wise man once said, ""pardon me while i burst into flame, i will never be the same."" my lives become chromatic and dull. lethargic doesn't cover it, its more or less a mess that i don't want to pull out the dust pan for. 

i have a friend whose life is too dramatic, a friend whose lifes not dramatic enough, a friend that decides to play a roll in all the drama, another friend whose wake creates drama, another one who ignores it all, and then theres me that seems to be a magnet for this shit. at least they make substances for this."

im sick. have been for the past couple days, in which i have slept a total of 27 hours. believe it or not, thats considered unhealthy. ive skipped all of my class's, and i am now behind... ive just caughed up some sort of green bile... just in case you wanted to know. i don't know, maybe a week of straight hooka wasn't a good idea and is now come back as some sort of karma. im still in bed... its four... my aunt will be here at five, to take me to have dinner. i haven't had breakfast or lunch in the past three days. 

the roomate has become involved with a band. horray for him. i have become the bands ""artist."" horray me. they have groopies. horray for them. i don't... damn it. 

i have become a knitter, if that is a word, and have made a scarf and hat. i feel femine, and it is a weird balance of shame of what i am doing and excitement from knowing im almost finished making a blasted hat or scarf. i needed a hobby... the hobby found me i guess. im wearing my hat. its warm. 

last night, i painted my hand with paint and watched ""invasion of the body snatchers."" it was cool.

 

oh yeah! i almost forgot, chad almost decked robert! yes robert is the gay guy on my hall, but there are instances that make me question whether or not he should be hit with a two-by-four. in my oppinion chad had full right to crush his nose, but after their initial fight chad took the high road and went to appalagize (sp) and instead recieved a verbal onslaught from robert which sent our RA into a tizzy threatening that if either one of them talk to the other she'll call the cops. if you want to hear the detail of this rediculous story ask. i need to go back to sleep."

thats what im going to do... heal. simple..."

"event","lately, i have been doing fairly well. despite the incessant injuries self-inflected and by the friendly banter of an overexcited aquaintence, that come with good health and good company.

""complications arose, and were soon overcome""

UPDATE:
           the past week

well, i actually am doing quite well with my new years resolution to be more social... its working. 

ive become friends again with some great people and have made some new connections. 

viewed the emporer's new groove and laughed so hard that the other viewies laughed with me. a first i must say. 

overrode into figure drawing and have established a good connection with the teacher... NUDIES EVERYDAY!!! WOOT!

attended the grand fiesta de Meghan and became more woozy than i have been... well, ever! fantastic night. tend to have them with those chaps everytime we meet. grand.

established that sublime is far better than anything else. especially while slightly intoxicated.

""crap! i spilt my drink again. here, wait, let me clean that up.""

became the honorary make-up artist for ian's band... i don't have a freakin clue how that happened... but whatever.

went to the CSU rec-center for the first time ever... despite being scared out of my mind, i had a good time.

went snowboarding with justin, and by deductive reasoning determined that it was too icy by sliding fifteen feet on my ass. 

saw some unbelievable ice sculptures in breckenridge, and had a damn good crepe. mmm... crepe.

found my happyness again. not going to let it go this time."

"event","This is the journal of Katherinne McKay.

This journal is my writing from forever and a day ago, as well as my newer things, such as novels, poetry, etc.

In these hallowed folders are my life, per se. Take them as you will, I tell the truth as only I know how (in fiction form ^^).

So, to know who is reading this, I am making this journal friends-only. You don't have to review or comment on anything, though that would be helpful. It's just so I know who my readers are.

E-mail me if you want to be my friend, 'cause it's been awhile since I've been on live journal.

Yours in novelling,

~Katherinne McKay"

"event","i havent had a chance to up date this since ive gotten it, its been like a week or so. i dont get on the computer much so my up date will be few and far between.plus i type like i have really fat fingers...ya well enjoy!!!!
   so anyway i really want to tell you all about my lovely birthday. it was last saturday and it ruled. baily and i went to the portland art museim that was really sweet. it was funny though because we both would rather have been to a low brow art show.heh then we basical walked around ptlnd and shoped baily got me a dvd. its the ninja scroll series and i bought my self zataoichi...its a movie. the funnie thing is that i was looking for clothesand i ended up geting two dvds.thats ok though because bai is going to get me a locust tee shirt. oh, we had lunch at a really good place called the kitchen,eat there.the whole day was really awesome.
   bailey and i a really cool idea for a comic. but now that i think about it... the storyline is very involved ad i dont feel like wrighting the whole thing out. maybe later.ha"

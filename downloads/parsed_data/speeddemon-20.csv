"event","Friday-I had class then worked at 7pm-11pm. It was a regular uneventful friday night. Jason went out with a few of the SBR guys but was cute and sweet enough to pick me up afterwards. So i stayed out at his house over night and we cuddled which was so cute.

Saturday-didn't do anything until about 10:30pm. Jason ended uptown before i did but i went and showed up cause it was Boner's birthday and i wanted to wish the birthday boy a very happy birthday. Bethany found me at wolfies while she was at a friends bachelorette party and picked me up and basically threw me around like a rag doll but it was GREAT seeing her and partying it up with her like old times. I also hung out with tami and had a good time with the SBR guys of course. i mean who doesn't when they're uptown with the SBR guys...they're crazy partiers. Of course i ended up drinking way too much on an empty stomach and once i got out to jason's house i went through 4 rounds of puking and laying on his bedroom floor twice before i got into his bed to make sure i was done puking my guts out. I also broke his toilet seat when i had to go pee. 

Sunday-basically a day of recovering. Doing some math homework and going down to bville for ""race night"" although no one races. I got bitched out by zapernick's woman for asking a question about how many times his car has blown up cause i couldn't remember. glad we're in college and can act our age. whatever, she's retarded and annoying. no one likes her anyways and she just gets pissed cause she knows it's the truth and can't handle the truth obviously. Well if the shoe fits hunny, wear it.

Other than all that i'm doing quite fine. I'm still a little bit achey and have a sore throat, but i'm surviving. I work tonight 5pm-10:30pm and hopefully we'll be out around 10pm. I may head up to wolfies to meet up with succh to have a few drinks with him and make fun of people doing karaoke. Since we haven't made fun of people and had a good laugh due to that for a very long time.

But i'm out. i'm going to relax a bit more before having to go to work. blech...i hate work!"

"event","So i have recently gone into a depressed state of mind. I don't really know what has brought this on. Maybe the fact of all the stress in my life...maybe the fact that i feel like i'm loosing friends. Or maybe it's something deeper than that. Nothing to do with my relationship. More to do with friendships. I feel like i have lost people along the way...i feel like i've become my own person, a loner shall i say to the world. I feel like a lot of people are angry with me. which in turn are only a few people to be exact, like 3 to count them. but of course for some reason it feels like so much more. 

Even though i'm depressed and in this state of mind i also feel equally free. But i'm not completely alright. I mean i feel like i can do whatever i want with no one complaining or bitching at me or picking on me or anything like that. But like i said it's not the greatest feeling either. I feel quite lost right now. I thought i had some type of direction but obviously that direction has lost me in turn and now i am lost without that direction. it's quite pathetic.

I miss my homie (homer) who helps keep me sane a LOT! I just miss a couple friends i guess. Homer especially. He isn't able to come up to PA cause he starts his job in a week and is busy moving from tallahassee to orlando. So i'm going to plan to see him before my fall semester starts cause i'm sure i'll be going insane by then and need another vacation. I miss my punk smartass as well. 

I've found out that one of those 3 people that hate me i never believed really talked shit on me until i got proof from his g/f who i'm befriending again after he told her not to talk to me anymore months ago. And that is by far the shittiest feeling ever to realize you were being stupid and blind for how many years and now it just hits you!? yeah...that's a pretty shitty feeling especially from someone you considered a very good friend and was always there for them through all their bullshit.

but i'm out. i'm going to listen to more depressing music even though it won't cheer me up. oh well."

"event","So this past weekend was quite fun. I attended Jason's cousin Sara Bruno's bachelorette party. Which was a hoot! We started drinking at 2pm while playing some games. Then went uptown to the bars and continued drinking while Sara completed her tasks until around midnight. Of course her friend Amanda and I busted out as soon as she got her 10th present for completing her 10th task. I left due to there were way too many cops out for my liking and Amanda left cause she had to drive back to Bville. I headed out to Jason's after the bachelorette party and basically just fell asleep. Oh...I didn't get drunk either for drinking for 9 hours either. I actually surprised myself cause I didn't hug the toilet or anything.

Sunday woke up next to jason's and basically did nothing all day. Jason and I went shopping to get me some stuff for our 2 year anniversary. I got a new bikini, 2 polo shirts, and a pair of shorts from pacsun.

Yesterday was memorial day and nothing special happened. I didn't have to work which i kind of wish i did only because i did absolutely nothing at all. I watched the first Rambo with Daneale, Matt, Tony, and Aaron and that was about my excitement for the day. Oh and we watched Aaron get his civic unstuck cause he ran over a tree stump at his buddy's house. I was supposed to chill out with Anne yesterday evening but that didn't happen for like the 4th time in a row, but it's chill. 

Today i woke up early for work thinking i worked 8am-12:30pm. Which i don't. I unfortunately work 11:15am-5:30pm (YUCK!). I'm kind of pissed cause i'm not supposed to work past 3pm that's what my availability said and obviously no one can pay attention to that. Well at least Jill can't cause she's a fucking retard and has no idea what the fuck she's doing. She always fucks up the schedule when haylee is away cause she doesn't know what she's doing. Can't wait to see how her store opening goes when she can't even do anything right at the store here in indiana. She basically sucks.

After work i have NO idea what I'm doing. I wanted to do a bunch of stuff today since i thought i got off at 12:30 HOWEVER obviously i was wrong. I wanted to tan today cause it's super nice out but no...my whole entire day is pretty much shot cause of working a shitty ass mid-shift. But i still get off at a decent time i guess when it's still daylight out however, you can't tan at like 6:00pm outside cause most of the sun is gone, i mean it's still light out and everything just not enough sun to get any type of tan. But i'm off tomorrow so i guess i'll tan tomorrow afternoon.

Anyways...i'm out. late!"

"event","Oh how i love my saturday and sundays due to the fact i don't have to work either one of those days. I have been feeling like a coffee slave to starbucks but that's nothing new i've felt like that for quite a while now. 

So I spent my saturday and sunday with jason and a bunch of friends doing bonfires which are always a good time. 

Today i'm going up to the HUGE indiana mall to do some 2 year anniversary shopping for jason's gift(s) cause our 2 year anniversary is tomorrow. which i'm pumped about. cause i mean 2 years is a long time, trust me, i know cause i was in another relationship before this one with jason for a little over 2 years. And it really is quite a long time. It's something you want to be proud about.

But other than that nothin else is goin on. i'm out. late!"

I must say, Daneale and I have had 2 successful fires in that thing UNLIKE when i first got it our fires pretty much sucked. haha. oh weeelll!!! anyways so wednesday it was just myself, tony, daneale, and matthew. Last night it was myself, brett, brian, matt, daneale, tony, eric, and katie. We all definitely had a good time. It was just chill and what not highly enjoyed it.

"event","Being home for a week now after my trip to florida has REALLY made me realize how stupid people are and that staying away from a ton of people is probably the best decision i made. I mean I've been home from Florida now for about a week and well while I was gone it was nice to not be around a ton of people. It really made me realize a lot of things. and well...here is what it made me realize which I should have known this for a long time, however, I forgot this concept. You don't need a huge amount of friends to be happy and to have fun. If you have a handful of friends then that's all you need because those handful are better than a large quantity because you know those handful of friends are always there for you no matter what. They're the ones that are proud for you when you do something extremely amazing! For example, I got a hold of Homer last night and he told me how proud he was for me about how I got a 3.5 GPA and made Dean's List. And of course there were a few other people that are extremely proud of me as well (Kinters). But...I've realized quite a few people i considered friends are mainly douche bags who are assholes or bitches and basically need to leave me the hell alone. OH! ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT CONSTANTLY FUCKING CALL ME AND I GIVE EXCUSES NOT TO TALK TO THEM!! THERE IS A REASON I TELL YOU I'M BUSY AND THERE'S A REASON I NEVER FUCKING CALL YOU BACK!!! HELLO!! USE YOUR BRAIN A LITTLE!

I am completely happy with myself after my little trip. And hopefully I'll go on another trip come august before school.

ok...that's enough. k bye!"

"event","So yesterday I got my final grades for the Spring '07 Semester. And just like I thought I did very well! And I was amazed that I got the grade I did in business law. So here's what I got...

BLAW 235: C
BTST 321: A
HPED 292: A
HPED 319: A

GPA= 3.5

That's right...I got 3 A's and ONLY 1 C. Plus I also qualified for Dean's List!!! Finally I'm actually getting grades that are at my potential. Of course I think most of it has to do with the fact I realized that I need to start kicking ass in my classes and getting awesome grades due to the fact that I want to go on and get my Master's Degree and I figured out what I want to do for sure with my major.

To all of you who doubted me and thought I'd always do horrible...I now laugh in your face! Cause I have finally proven you wrong. And I want to thank all of my friends who always knew I could do a lot better than I actually was for the past 3 years. 

Like the title says...this semester has been the best semester by far!"

"event","So today I return home from wonderful, beautiful, and exciting florida. And well, I really don't want to return home. But this always happens...cause I'm leaving a very good friend of mine and who knows when i'll see him again. Kinda sad isn't it? I just don't want to go home to all the drama or the boringness. Tallahassee is definitely a hot city with so much to do! 

So I have to leave homer again for a 2nd time. It's not always the easiest thing to do knowing that one of your best friends is so many miles away from you/so many states away. And the fact that he's going to be moving down to Orlando, which makes it easier for me to visit him, however, he is now completely done with his college career and is going out in the real world soon. Actually in like another month. BUT...good news is...he's hopefully driving up to PA near the end of the week this week to visit! OH THANK GOD! haha. Nah, i absolutely <3 homer to death and he's by far one of the best friends i could ask for and one of those friends i could trust with anything in the world. He's the only friend of mine that actually motivates me to do better in school when i do really shitty. He just knows me quite well to know i could do better sometimes. It's hard when a friend of yours that you care so much about is so far away sometimes...it's hard cause you're afraid you'll completely lose contact with them cause both of you have your own thing going on where you live. 

But anyways, I need to finish getting ready and packed to drive over 2 1/2 hours to jacksonville to fly home. I <3'd every moment down here in tallahassee visiting homer and partying it up. This 2nd trip has pushed me even more into trying to get into Grad School down here."

"event","So here I sit in the JFK International Airport in New York. Which by the way, I find it to be extremely dirty and gross along with describing it as a shithole. i'm definitely not a fan of this airport. Plus there is like NO WHERE to f'n eat except for these deli places and they don't have anything all that great. soo...i'm stuck with buying whatever they have to fill my stomach, even though it's really unhealthy food. So I'm just waiting to get down to the south and enjoy a weekend away from people and away from indiana in general. I've been needing to get outta indiana probably ever since i got back from Chicago back in January haha. I can only stand Indiana for a short period of time and then it tends to piss me off along with the people that live there as well.

I got a hold of jason once i landed in NY. He sent me a really cute text message telling me how he already misses me when i was sitting at my gate in pittsburgh. So i called him when i landed at JFK to let him know i was ok and that my plane didn't explode or crash with me on it. He worries about that kind of stuff. Which i find to be extremely adorable and cute. But of course i miss my cutie jason and my puppy bella tons!!! I especially miss bella.

Oh...i am a HUGE fan of JETBLUE AIRLINES. definitely a good choice to go with if you ever choose to fly anyhwere. Not only are the seats comfy but you get to watch FREE Direct TV or listen to FREE XM Radio. your choice! yeah obviously i get extremely excited over small things like this but of course this is my first time flying with jetblue and so far i actually enjoy their airline company.

Other than all of this i am extremely excited to see Homer and be down in Florida! woo! Hopefully the weather stays nice and i don't have any bad weather down there. The only thing i'm nervous about right now is driving from jacksonville to tallahassee all by myself. :(:-/ yeah...i'm not a big fan of driving in places i'm unfamiliar with state wise. although i can drive in orlando like any resident there, but this is my first time driving in north florida so it will be an experience.

"event","So i checked my e-mail today and got by far the GREATEST e-mail in the world. I won't say what it was exactly about but it was a reply to a complaint i made the other night about a company lying about a few things to gain access to an event they shouldn't even have access to certain parts of the event. So they told me they're going to check into this whole situation and they appreciated my thoughtfulness and if i needed anything next year they would definitely help me out. So i am basking in this not only because am i happy that they are FINALLY getting what they deserve for lying but also i am happy because for once my bitch side has done something extremely good and is getting something good in return. Of course jason and myself find this whole thing to be hilarious cause well, what I did was me just telling the truth. And of course if my name does get out in the open that i was the one that did this, well...sorry to say but i really don't care. At least i can back myself up on this one and of course jason can as well.

Other than that...work sucked today. i had to be at work at 5:30am but at least i got off work early. And it's my ONLY day of work this week cause tomorrow i have my one-on-one about my pay raise i'm getting for being at sbux now for 6 months and that's it. Then i leave for Florida on Thursday which i'm totally pumped about! can't wait! i really can't just because i need some time with friends and being away from this place for a while. I just can't stand a lot of people right now, this doesn't include jason, i just can't stand some idiots lately. I have my HPED 292 final today which is just a quiz so it shouldn't be TOO bad, hopefully. I also have to do a presentation in there today with my group on what we did and how we accomplished what we did for the class project. that isn't that hard at all. once i'm done with that, SUMMER VACATION FOR ME until june-july due to summer classes, but i only have summer classes during summer session 1. This is the FIRST summer that i actually have a somewhat normal summer vacation.

"event","So this past weekend I did end up going to Carlisle, which is a shithole town, for the weekend for the Performance & Style Car Show. Of course I didn't get there til Saturday morning, but whatever.  It was worth waiting til Saturday to drive out with Jason anyways.

Friday night almost turned out to be a catastrophe between jason and i. I wanted to really leave friday night to head out to carlisle, however, whenever i told jason this he ended up saying to just pack up all my shit that i have of his in a box and drop it off at his truck at slowboy racing. He was going to end our relationship over me leaving friday. He was obviously pissed that i was going to leave friday night and basically leave him behind all weekend and what not and he saw that i was putting a carshow over our relationship. Of course i broke down and cried and was like well if you're threat was serious, which i didn't think it was, i won't go tonight. He asked why can't i just basically wait until saturday to drive out. He was stuck at work late friday and told me that he was genuinely sorry about getting mad at me and reacting the way he did and told me how we'll go saturday morning out to carlisle and of course stay saturday into sunday. Garland was upset i believe that i didn't end up going out friday night with him, but he made it ok, and that's all that basically matters. I could careless about that kid right now, but i'll explain here in a little bit why. So Friday night i did last minute shopping for Jason. I got him 2 new pairs of shorts and a nice polo t-shirt from AE of course that total was $108.50. RIDICULOUS how much they charge for their clothing. Once I was done with that I went up to Brandon's apartment to  visit with Andrea and obviously get picked on hardcore by a bunch of smartasses. Oh well...I'm used to it cause Garland is the same way. Once jason FINALLY got off work at SBR like around 11pm, he had to stay late because they were 1,300 short of $100,000 for sales and jason didn't want to work saturday he stayed late along with all of the other sales reps to get that $1,300. Once he got home i left from Brandon's to head out to Jason's to spend the night. We went to bed early, cause we were going to get up at 7am to leave to drive 2 1/2 hours out to carlisle for the duration of the weekend.

Saturday was a good day. The Honda LOVED the turnpike just cause it didn't have to drive intown driving and it got to go about 90-100+ down the turnpike. I had my radar detector plugged in so it could warn me of any cops, which there weren't any state police on the turnpike. We didn't leave Marion Center until around 8am cause I had to get gas and everything and the fact that i ended up sleeping in until 7:30am. Jason took a shower while i was sleeping and failed to wake me up cause he couldn't help but let me sleep. So we got out to Carlisle around 11am. We got to the Super 8 where Garland, McCurdy, Bethany, Jude, Skylar, and others were staying. Once we walked into Garland's room it was the most DIRTIEST thing I've ever seen. the Super 8 in carlisle is basically a shithole as i would like to call it. The refrigerator was the A/C unit in the room and of course there was a bottle of rootbeer and a budlight can on it to keep both of them cold. haha...I of course found this to be ridiculous. It also smelled bad, mostly of cigarette smoke and pot. Jason couldn't stand the smell of cigarette smoke and of course when i took a deep breath in i was the one to point out that it was definitely not cigarette smoke, it was definitely pot. And about 2 seconds after i distinguished that smell, we found the pipe that they all smoked pot in. Sooo...jason told me to put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door so the cleaning lady wouldn't obviously find it and possibly call the cops. yeah, we're thoughtful like that. We both decided we were NOT going to stay there so I made a quick phone call over the Hotel Carlisle (the baller hotel) to see if they had any rooms for the night, which they did, so we made a reservation over there. We couldn't check in until 3pm or after. So we gathered up all our stuff and headed back down to the civic and drove over to the fairgrounds. 

The carshow wasn't all what i expected it to be. I guess i had high hopes from how badass it was 2 years ago. We gave garland the hotel key that they gave us to get into his room and made up some bullshit story about how we weren't allowed to stay and what not. of course i'm sure everyone knew it was bullshit. but jason and i didn't care. We both wore our slowboy racing t-shirts the entire day and mccurdy, jude, and everyone didn't like that at all either. Jude got on my case about wearing one and i'm like oh wait...that's right huml personally gave me free t-shirts to wear this weekend...oh and that's right jason works there so i'm supporting his job. I think half the reason the carshow wasn't that great was because jason and i just can't stand jude and mccurdy and bethany anymore. all they do is talk shit and well they don't like us that much either. not like either of us care. Garland was a total asshole to the both of us which kind of didn't surprise me, cause he has started to hang out with mccurdy and somehow when anyone hangs out with that fat piece of shit their attitude goes to hell. I made fun of Garlands ""new haircut"" which he got a mohawk. What a fag. It looks like he has a landing strip for DUMBASS AIRLINES going right down the middle of his head. I parked my car in the actual honda section only because my honda doesn't like to be parked next to piece of shit cars like judes and mccurdys. My civic would get angry. After we got our fill of the show for saturday i finally got jason convinced to go check into our hotel.

Hotel Carlisle is definitely baller. Our room was great...king sized bed (which is way too big for jason and i), an actual refrigerator, microwave, big t.v., indoor pool/hot tub, etc. you get the point. After we got everything in our hotel the first thing i did was take advantage of the hot tub and indoor pool. Once some of our friends (brett, amanda, and brian) got a hold of us to let us know they were going to stop over i ended up indulging session to head back up to the room and get changed. We were all going to go to the after party, however, that was a bust. We all couldn't find anything to do cause no one was doing ANYTHING AT ALL! McCurdy, Jude, and Bethany went to sleep at like 10pm. Bethany i can understand that cause friday night she got high and wasted and sprained her ankle by falling off a curb along with scrapping her knee. So she walked around saturday all day on crutches after being in the ER for hours on end. ha! that's what you get for being a fucking retard. So since they were all in bed, Garland had no one to basically hang out with so he finally calls me to see if anything is going on with jason and i. AFTER HE DIDN'T TALK TO US ALL DAY...hmmm...interesting.  He wanted me to bring my stereo i had in my car that i brought out over to his room and jason told me to tell him he can come over and get it himself. which garland would have none of. he wanted me to bring it over and he annoyed he hell out of the both of us. especially when super 8 was walking distance from our hotel. So jason and i ended up going to drive around for a little and to see if anything was going on anywhere at all which there wasn't, so we headed back to the hotel. I went down to our hotel bar to have a couple drinks and that was about it. Once i got back to the room i couldn't sleep cause well...a king sized bed is just way too big for jason and i. see we like to cuddle up extremely close to one another and the king sized bed just wasn't doing it for the both of us. we tried to cuddle up close and even then we were too far apart. haha. 

Sunday jason woke up before me and was confused cause i was about 2 feet away from him in the bed. He woke me up and i went down to check out of our room and then we went back up to pack up all of our stuff back into our car and head over to the fairgrounds. There was absolutely NOTHING going on really except another burnout contest, starboyz, and hydraulics contest. And i believe a bass competition as well. Jude pissed the both of us off by opening his dumb mouth. He went off on jason first then came after me and my honda about how it's a dunk (supposed to be pronounced donk, but people are stupid) cause it has 18 inch rims on it. ooo...big deal. And of course when jude opened his mouth i was like do you want me to punch you in the fucking face? cause i'll do it right now just to shut you the fuck up. and then basically everyone left me alone about me and my car. Jason and i stayed about maybe 20 min. after that. I got him a few posters for his office at SBR and hung out with amanda. Jason walked around with jude and mccurdy while i was with amanda and then we found each other and got organized to leave. We both just couldn't stand being around haters any longer basically. Brett, Brian, and Amanda left not too long after us either.

The trip home was fun. We talked about the haters and how if we were getting along with everyone it probably would have been a better time. We both talked about how we were glad we both decided not to stay with Garland and how we were glad we decided to stay at hotel carlisle. I didn't take any pictures cause there wasn't really anything worth taking a picture of. There wasn't anything to really videotape either. We both agreed that Performance & Style isn't what Modified Madness USED to be. And we both agreed we will not be going to P&S next year either."

Of course thursday i KNEW it was going to be one hell of a trip already. I took andrea, kalee, and daneale with me of course. ROAD TRIP TO NEW ALEX WOO! I got Daneale her nose piercing for an early birthday gift from me and she was totally stoked so she had to be there by 6:15pm. So on our way down there i get PULLED OVER by the Blairsville Police. YEAH FUCK THE POLICE! But I was lucky and got the NO POINTS violation. But of course it pissed me off highly cause I'm not going to carlisle, it's more important for me to pay that ticket first haha. So that's when we all knew it was going to be one hell of a night.

Daneale passed out when she got her nose pierced. haha. They actually had to crack open some smelling salts to wake her back up. haha...PUSSY! And my appointment wasn't til 8pm and so we all just chilled out talking to Rock the guy that pierced Daneale's nose who by the way is fucking crazy and hilarious.

I of course was nervous about getting a tattoo. I mean it's something PERMANENT and well yeah...you have it for the rest of your life. haha. Anyways...I had Jake do my tattoo cause when i made my appointment they asked me who i wanted and i said well this is my first time here and i was referred to by a friend named Kevin Garland so I'll take whoever does his tattoos. And Jake is by far extremely nice and awesome. We made fun of Garlands cover-up tattoo on the top of his back at the base of the neck. we made fun of garland's tattoo that says ""she loves me, she loves me not"" across his collar bone. haha. And of course we all just bullshitted. My tattoo is located on my left hip and it's a red & black nautical star with a japanese cherry blossom on each side of the nautical star. i'll post a pic here later. I may add on to it or i may get the same design on my right hip. who knows. I kind of want to just add onto what i have now. 

so after we left jake CALLED garland and told him how i had 3 chicks with me and all this other shit and when garland got a hold of me he was like where are you at? i told him bville and he's like i hear you have 3 other chicks with you and i'm like no daneale is the only one here and then i was like HEY! HOW DO YOU KNOW!? and of course garland pulled all this shit about how he knows everything...and i was like did JAKE FUCKING CALL YOU AFTER I LEFT!? and of course he did. 

But all in all my weekend was kick ass. Andrea is extremely proud of me! 

but i'm off...gotta get ready for coffee slave time at sbux! woo!"

"event","So Performance & Style is in 2 more weeks! I'm totally pumped about it. I really can't wait to be able to go down to the show and just have a weekend of fun with a bunch of crazy people i know.

Lets see what has been going on lately...not too much been extremely busy with school and work. Of course I'm still getting dragged into a bunch of drama bullshit and i can't stand it any longer. I'm just cutting my ties with people that have been talking their fair share of shit on me. It's the best way. I haven't talked to some people for like 6-7 months and now that we've started talking again all that's been going on are them running their damn mouthes and i'm done. i'm sick of it and i don't want to deal with it so i'm just not going to deal with them. I have this entire week off from work at Sbux well i work this upcoming Sunday but i have all week off up until then. I've been spending time with jason a lot lately which is absolutely wonderful although i'm kind of sad that he may not go to Performance & Style. But i'm still going to go either way. His boss, my friend, Mike Huml is going to give me some FREE SBR shirts to wear the entire weekend at Carlisle which is definitely kick ass! I don't have to pay for them...so that's just a plus. Cause i really don't feel like paying money for any clothing right now after my shopping spree 2 weeks ago at the westmoreland mall.

My internship is sucking right now cause i still have a good amount of hours to do and obviously i have a feeling that i may not get it completed and yet i know the only way i'm going to get these hours is by of course bullshitting hours and making up shit so i can get this pre-professional experience done. My GA knows that's the truth too and she's supportive and told me straight out i'll have to fudge some hours and of course everyone that works there isn't going to say anything at all. It's the ONLY way i'm going to get my completed hours for this damn thing. I'd have to say interning at the rec complex isn't the worst thing but when they don't have enough for you to do it is. Especially when it's for a class grade. Like if i end up getting a horrible grade because of this whole thing i'll recommend that IUP doesn't send students that are doing the pre-professional experience to the ice center at all. 

I've gone back to listening to my punk music and going back to the way i was when i used to get into it. Just cause I was better off cause i just didn't give a shit about what people said or thought soo...i figured it's better if i go back to that. I'm sick of being numb and acting/dressing like someone i'm not. I'm happier wearing my awesome stuff from PacSun and doing things i love to do without a care in the world or caring about other people. I just have realized it's better not to give a shit about what people say, think, or what looks they give you. Caring about all of this just leads to trouble and drama and i'm sick of drama. 

But other than all of that. i'm out. i'm going to probably head home from the ice center here soon cause obviously milt isn't coming back and no one has a key to let me into the upstairs office SOOooo...i'm just going to end up making up bullshit hours and what not. i'm out later."

So obviously I haven't written in here for a LONG time since Mardi Gras which was about 2 months ago basically.  I don't really have that much time to actually write in here, and since i'm bored at the moment i decided i'd actually update this thing. 

There are only about 2 weeks left in the spring semester which i'm totally pumped for this semester to over. HOWEVER, these past couple of weeks obviously are going to drag just like they do every single year. But that's expected cause you can't stop thinking about being done for the summer and doing nothing. But i of course am never done for a summer due to the fact that i continue my education during the summer months, however, this summer will be the FIRST summer I have MAY and AUGUST off because 2 classes I'm repeating are of course just during the June-July (summer 1 session). Which is SWEET! I've been going out lately on weekends, usually only on saturdays. I usually end up meeting up with Jason and Garland up at Wolfies and party with them and a few other people from our little car clique I shall say.

PERFORMANCE & STYLE Car Show in Carlisle is almost here and I'm totally stoked! I missed it last year which was depressing but i'm going this year. Jason got a job at Slowboy Racing which is badass however, he might not be able to attend Carlisle with me. And...since I already paid for my weekend admission I'm still going to go whether he goes or not. Cause even if he doesn't go most of my car clique will be there anyways so I'll still be around people I know. 

Jason and I are doing fine. Our 2 year anniversary is in May and i'm really excited about it. I can't believe it's going on 2 years it doesn't even seem that long but of course sometimes it does. We've been having our issues but obviously we've worked most of them out...and that's what a relationship is about. You gotta sometimes give more than take and I learned that a LONG time ago. But any relationship has it's moments...it's a normal thing.

I also MIGHT be moving out this summer depending on IF i can afford it. My friend Julie has offered me to room with her at her apartment for only $100.00/month which is sweet. of course i have to figure out if i can financially afford this because once i'm out of my house i of course have to pay for every single bill i have (books for school are  not included in this bill figure). I'll have to pay my own cellphone bill, gas, food, etc. you know the normal everyday stuff along with things for my puppy of course.  But who knows...we'll see. I also am planning on turboing my car, however, if i choose to move out i obviously won't be able to turbo my car. I mean i want to move out to see what it's like to live on my own...i'm 22 and obviously need to move out at SOME point and experience what it's like living on my own cause even if i don't do it this summer moving out and being on my own will eventually happen. it's the inevitable. 

Work is going well. I have pretty much hated being there for the past week however it's getting better so i don't mind it as much. What my work day is like is based on who i end up having as a shift supervisor basically cause i only get along with like 3/5. oh well. you'll have that i guess.

but i'm out for now. i need to find something to do."

"event","So i haven't really updated anything recently, due to the fact i've been extremely busy with school, work, and my internship. Along with trying to fit in friend time and boyfriend time all into that busy schedule as well. My internship is going great! I absolutely love it! Classes are also equally going great as well...of course HPED 292 is definitely stressing me out, however, you'll have that sometimes.

I got a FREE airline voucher from American Airlines today in the mail due to their HUGE fuck up they did when i flew to chicago over winter break and when i came home. I mean seriously, who loses luggage 2 times in a row!? But yeah, I got a FREE round-trip airline voucher from them to anywhere they fly. And that's definitely a blessing right there! cause i'm wanting to really fly down to FL over Spring Break to see Homer and check out more of the FSU campus cause I'm thinking I really want to go to FSU for Grad School. Yes, that's right, I'm thinking about doing Grad School. And why Florida State and NOT IUP? Well...I want to go to a more recognized university, I want a CLIMATE change (warm weather...NO MORE COLD), and of course I kind of want a cultural change as well. And since i'm a small town girl going to FSU which is located in Tallahassee, FL (the capital of FL if you didn't know this already) would definitely be a cultural change for me. And from what I've heard, their Sports Administration Master's Program is really good! So anyways back to how my free voucher is a blessing...I've been planning this trip for a couple weeks now, and well my mom has no free airline miles left after i took 2 trips over winter break, and so i was going to pay for my own plane ticket. Of course we got this HUGE winter storm that rolled through with 6 inches or more snow and a couple inches of ice on top of that. Well, I had to get my Honda out of my driveway and of course it got stuck. Go figure! But in the process of getting it out of my driveway and onto the street the ice/snow mixture broke my bumper in half! YES I SAID IN HALF!! the top half is still connected to my civic, however, the bottom half is no longer existing. So of course I ended up having to get a new bumper and that is costing me $159.00. So i told Homer I wouldn't be able to come down if i pay for my own plane ticket cause i have to replace my front bumper and get it painted. So...when i got this free airline voucher in the mail i'm like this has SERIOUSLY got to be a sign to tell me i should go to Florida in March! well at least that's what i'm hoping it stands for!

Other than all that excitement of making  trip down to FL, basically wrecking my car in my OWN driveway, and school it's MARDI GRAS weekend! and you know what that means!? gettin CRUNK! i mean sure it's fun to party  but when there's a holiday involved it just makes it even better! so i think after working at the ice center tonight i'm headin up to wolfies and partying it up hopefully with the other half of team badass (amanda). I will NOT go to the coney for Bacardigras just cause i have experienced the coney and it's not as fun as wolfies, plus since i know everyone at wolfies i feel outta place at the coney unless jared just is working at the bar and that's not too much to say.

but i'm out. i'll update again sometime in the future, who knows when."

"event","So classes are going great. EXTREMELY stressed out but great. I was in class the other day and we're doing a cover letter/resume project and we have to find job openings that appeal to us and are tied in with our major. And as i sat there in front of my computer searching up Athletic Director jobs i realized right then and there that i will most likely be going to Graduate School to get my Master's Degree. Because every single job opening for Athletic Director, be it high school or college prefers you to have your Master's Degree. Granted i could probably get a job with my Bachelor's Degree, but of course if someone is applying for the same job you are and they have their Master's Degree they'll get hired over me no doubt. Because that's an extra year or two (depending on where you go for Grad. school) experience under your belt which schools do like for you to have. Of course when i found this out it highly depressed me, i mean i figured i'd have to go to grad school already, but i was hoping i really wouldn't have to. 

So once i found all of this out i figured i'd have a talk with Jason about this WHOLE ordeal. I mean i thought i'd only have the dilemma of the ""if i have to get a job out of state (which i know will happen) once i graduate will jason really move with me?"" and of course NOW getting a job isn't even the case. It's ""if i choose to go to Grad. School will Jason be willing to move with me  just so i can continue my education without having a job?"" And of course i've already talked to him about this and at first his answer was why would i move away with you when all you're doing is going to school for another 2 years? And then he changed that answer the next day saying if i can get transferred to a job where you want to go to grad school then yeah i'll move with you and work while you're going to grad school. And of course I'm not sure if i want to go out of state for grad school or just get my Master's at IUP. Of course I know it would be in my best interest to probably go to a bigger university one that is more well known than IUP to get my masters. And i mean i REALLY want to go to FSU for grad school. When i went to visit my friend Homer (who is attending FSU for his Master's Degree) i highly enjoyed the area of tallahassee and i also really liked the campus (HUGE but i liked it). And IF i get my QPA up and kiss ass to a professor that i have this semester who also attended FSU and convince him to someday down the road to write a recommendation letter for me and i do well on the testing that you have to take to get into graduate school, then maybe i will head south to tallahassee to go to Grad School. Of course this is all a year away or so, i mean even though it's a year away i guess i've figured i better start figuring out my shit and come up with a solid plan of what i'm going to for sure do. right? right! And because of finding out i need to go to graduate school, i will forever be in debt to the higher educational system. WOOOOooo...*Sense the sarcasm*"

"event","So i HAVE to be by far the WORST g/f in the world! So last night i was getting into jason's truck, and when i opened the door some snow got onto the seat. Since it was snowing last night. Anyways, as i brushed off the snow a little bit, the ring he got me last christmas (not this past one) flew off, hit the plastic molding on the door and fell to the ground!!!! we tried to find it and failed miserably, and I of course balled my eyes out cause i felt so bad about loosing it! Jason tried to comfort me in saying it's only a ring, even though you could tell he was equally upset. He also tried comforting me in saying that it wasn't even the ring he originally wanted to get me, but it didn't help that much. So i have concluded i am by far the worst g/f in the world! Of course he told me well maybe someday i'll get you a bigger one or something. And i,  myself, wouldn't blame him if he never gets me another one. Now my left ring finger feels extremely weird without it, and i miss it horribly. :( Even though it's only a material object, i still miss it! I really really liked that ring too! 
This morning though i was driving home and heard the song that jason first told me reminded him of me and it cheered me up a little to hear it play on the way back to my house this morning. I mean i know everything is going to be ok, i guess, i just feel like the worst person in the world for loosing it. And i think the main reason why i'm depressed is because i KNOW how much he was worried over the ring and how he always told me he'd never get me one ever. And yet he did, and i LOST it!

i'm a horrible person."

"event","So Dave Clawson's wedding was small but very cute and elegant! The bridesmaids dresses looked gorgeous and Anna's wedding dress was extremely beautiful! Dave and the groomsmen all looked very handsome and P.I.M.P.! Jason of course was by far the best looking groomsman...of course he is my boyfriend so it's obvious i would say something like this. 

Anyways...after the ceremony there was a small little reception in the dinner hall of the church. It had really good little snacks and some punch. While we all were waiting for Dave and Anna to cut the cake, Megan (one of the bridesmaids) overheard how jason and mccurdy were planning on going up to the bars after the reception. Well she heard that they were inviting her husband (Matt) who is actually like a year or 2 younger than myself and Megan of course flipped out and said to matt, ""Well you can go up to the bars if you want to give up having sex with me all night!"" Now...not only did she say this when everyone was quiet and waiting for Dave and Anna to cut their cake but she also said this statement quite loudly too. And of course Jason, Mccurdy, Amber (one of Dave's friends who I met tonight), and myself found this to be quite rude and very funny because Megan is crazy (we all know this) and of course she said this extremely loud for everyone to hear! After all that...Dave and Anna finally went on to cut their cake (which was extremely beautiful!). I didn't really stay too much longer after the cake cutting, I gave Dave a hug letting him know i was going to get going and he asked if i wanted to take a piece of cake home with me. And i properly and nicely said to him ""Well i'm a girl driving a stick shift car with heels and i really don't want cake going all over my car."" And he COMPLETELY understood and offered to put ciran wrap on top of the cake so it wouldn't spill through out my car. Dave is by far one of the sweetest and most understanding guys i know. Plus he's quite the good listener...we've had quite a good number of talks where he pretty much listened to my problems. Once i got my slice of cake i basically left and told dave to give me a call sometime since i knew he had my # and maybe we can do something together and chill.

Right now i'm not doing anything at all. Jason and McCurdy went to Drillers thinking it was a BRIGHT idea to go to the bars with their tuxes on. Which really it isn't that great of an idea but what can i say? It's not like either one of them would listen to me anyways!

But i'm out...i'm going to meet up with Bethany! Maybe have a small girls night out since i'm not really in that great of a mood! later on."

"event","So today I woke up at 6:45am! yes i was up extremely early this morning. why? Cause i had to be at the White Township Recreation Center for my first day of being an intern there. I had to be at the Ice Center by 8am! But it actually wasn't too bad...i kept busy by getting this dodge ball tournament figured out that is all the high schools in the county going against one another. And I also had to make a flyer full of information on an Over 40 baseball league. I'm actually ALMOST done with the dodge ball tournament information packet so we can get them out to the high schools and all that good stuff.

tonight i have NO clue what I'm doing. I don't have any classes on Fridays this semester. So i MIGHT go out to jason's for the night and i might not. I may head uptown and hit up the bars but that is only a possibility as well. So basically i'm undecided about tonight! go figure!

Tomorrow not too much is going on really. I have to go to a wedding at 6:30pm but other than that nothing is really going on. Except for picking up my paycheck, picking up school stuff, and a few other errands.

My weekend so far consists of working at the Ice Center 1-4pm and 6-10pm as a skate guard to stop teenagers from acting like idiots. Then i work at Starbucks 2:45pm-11:00pm Sunday. 

But i'm out for now. Classes are great i LOVE my professors! It's goin to be a GREAT semester...i can already feel it!"

They lost my bag 2 times in the span of THREE DAYS!!! who the hell does that!? and i wasn't the ONLY one that didn't get their luggage from chicago. basically the WHOLE flight didn't get their luggage back! WTF is up with that?! So i got home probably around 3am this morning and i'm tired but i'll live. The reason why i'm really upset is because 1. All of my clothes are in there and 2. I bought a dress in Chicago to wear to a wedding i'm attending on Friday! Oh...and of course my make-up is in there as well.

Tomorrow classes start back up again which i'm not looking forward to. But hopefully i get my bag back tomorrow! HOPEFULLY! or maybe even get it back later today or tonight! but anyways classes start tomorrow which isn't too bad for me. I don't have class until 3pm and that's the ONLY class i have tomorrow! but then i also work at starbucks tomorrow as well after class sometime tomorrow. Not too bad for a day of school. Thursday is what is really not going to make me a happy camper. But oh well...i'll talk about thursday tomorrow.

I'm out to go run a few errands like develop some pictures and what not. Later on!"

"event","So today Oliver and Tara took me to St. Louis which was definitely FUN!!!! Although we were up extremely early it was still a GREAT day! We went to Anheiser-Busch, Inc. for their brewery tour on how they make the ORIGINAL BUDWEISER which was really interesting I must say. We got to see the Clydesdales which i have to say they live better than any human being that i know of! LITERALLY! oh and we also saw the Budweiser dalmatian!!! After the tour we got to have 2 free complimentary drinks of any type of beer they brewed or even some of these energy/alcohol drinks they also make. I had a Bud Light and a Rolling Rock. Tara and Oliver had pop. 

After the tour we went out to lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe. Which was a good time. Really good food! Then we headed over to the St. Louis (Gateway) Arch and went all the way to the top! this is the second time i've seen the arch, however, this is the first time i've actually been inside of it and up to the top. Of course since today's weather has been rainy and misty there wasn't much visibility at the top of the arch. but still it was a great experience.

Finally, we all got sick of the wet weather and came to the conclusion that it was time to head back home. We got Papa Del's deep dish cheese pizza and rented My Super Ex-Girlfriend, which by the way is HILARIOUS!!!! VERY FUNNY!! if you haven't seen this movie yet i highly recommend it if you are looking for a good laugh from a movie.

Tomorrow i head home back to PA. I have set up a notification thing with American Airlines to send me a voice message on my cellphone to let me know if my flight changes or anything about 2 hours before i am supposed to leave from Chicago O'Hare. But as of now I've checked my flight out and it is On-Time. and tonight i will be doing some HEAVY praying that my flight doesn't get delayed OR canceled. but by the time i leave, which is 8pm, the weather isn't supposed to be all that bad. and plus what bad weather we were supposed to get really hasn't happened, but like i said i'll be praying that this winter storm doesn't hit as bad as it's supposed to be and that my plane will still leave on time from chicago!

for now i'm out...i need some sleep. Getting up at probably 9am. it's my last day so tara and i are of course having a GIRLS DAY since Oliver doesn't have the day off tomorrow for M.L. King Day. So tara and i will have our own fun like the old school days back at IUP. IF the weather is really decent tomorrow we MIGHT go horseback riding IF possible since i haven't seen the ""BIG RED"" for a while now."

"event","Well i didn't get into illinois until actually today!!! i ended up getting STUCK at the pittsburgh airport for the night. But then again i got a free night at the Hyatt Hotel. which wasn't too bad. But the reason why i got stuck in pittsburgh was because there were no flights in or out of Chicago O' Hare airport last night due to the fact chicago was supposed to get hit by a HUGE ice storm which was supposed to produce 1-3"" of ice!!! However, what all happened was my American Airlines flight was canceled then they sent me and 3 other passengers over to U.S. Airways for a flight that actually got out and flew into the Chicago O' Hare airport however U.S. wouldn't let us on and told us to go back to our original gate. I told them that they needed to stop my bag cause it was on it's way over to be transferred onto the flight. They were supposed to stop my bag however they didn't and my bag went to chicago WITHOUT me!!!

SOOoooo...i got a flight out today at 6am on United Airlines. Which meant i had to get up at 4am this morning to go through security AGAIN! I got into chicago on time and found my bag AFTER walking a good 5 miles around the airport! i was sooo happy to find my bag that i basically yelled ""OMG MY BAG!!!!"" and of course people turned around and looked like i was crazy...but that's ok! i don't care i was sooo happy to get my bag back!

Now my only worry on coming home is the weather here in Illinois. because it's supposed to get really crappy over the weekend into monday. SOOooo HOPEFULLY i'm still able to fly outta here on monday and get home when i'm supposed to!

And by the time i get there, there won't be too much to do. But that depends on which shift manager is in charge. Jason and I are going to pick up a few things for Bella. Like some cedar chips to put in her dog house to keep away fleas and pick up an inside bed for her as well. Then we're most likely going over to wal*mart to pick up a few groceries.

That's how i roll though and i'm BALLIN'! Anyways...so far i've gotten a few plans from tara. Which include possibly going to the Anheiser-Busch company and getting a tour of the place in St. Louis which is a good couple of hours drive from Champaign, Illinois but it would definitely be interesting. Then we are also going horseback riding as well. I KNOW for a fact i will be needing to layer myself cause i checked out the weather and obviously since it's a northern state like PA it's cold. haha. but a winter horseback trail ride will definitely be a first for me and most likely fun! I have yet to get ready for the LIZZ INVASION myself. I haven't packed yet. But...i'll get to it tonight probably after work or tomorrow early in the morning since my flight doesn't leave until 7pm from Pittsburgh. So we'll see..i most likely will do my packing tomorrow morning. haha.

but i'm out. i gotta go uptown and meet with my cutie jason to do some shopping. later on."

i got a message from tara telling me to take out riding clothes out to champaign cause where tara's horse is being boarded the owner is going to take us out on some trails. heck yes! LUCKY! 

I haven't started packing yet...i REALLY need to do that. Along with cashing my paycheck so i have money to spend out there. I am in dire need of trying to find a really cute dress to wear to 4 weddings this year...and i'm POSITIVE i'll find something in chicago. I also have to figure out what i need to pack clothing wise. which means i need to actually check out the weather over there which i haven't done yet either.

but i'm out. i need to get ready for work and to be a coffee slave. wooo!"

"event","The upcoming weekend (my last weekend of break to be exact) includes the following activities:

Friday (Jan. 12): I depart from the Pittsburgh Airport at 7:00pm to head to Chicago, Illinois. Where Tara and Oliver will be picking me up at 7:45pm (time change, don't forget central time is an hour behind us, so really I land in Chicago around 8:45pm)

Saturday (Jan. 13): Tara and I will be going on a dress shopping adventure. For the following reason...I have FOUR, yes FOUR weddings to attend to this year. The first wedding i attend is actually JANUARY 19 (a week AFTER i leave for Illinois), I have another wedding June 2 which would be Justin and Sara's (Jason's cousin) wedding, followed by Jude and Bethany's wedding in August, and the fourth wedding is Lisa and her fiance's wedding as well. So this day is devoted to finding a dress i can actually wear to ALL four weddings instead of me going out and buying something new for every single one. And since we'll be going to outlets and stores in Chicago, I'm SURE we'll find something!

Sunday (Jan. 14): I really haven't gotten any clues on what will be going on this day. Possibly church? i have NO clue. although this is my next to last day in Champaigne.

Monday (Jan. 15): My last day here. However, I do not leave Chicago until 8:00pm. Which means we will be able to get one last out to eat dinner together before i must depart and head back. I also believe Tara and I will be visiting the BIG RED (tara's horse) and trying to calm him down from his wild antics that he has been doing lately.

Apparently Oliver (Tara's husband) found out about the tour of the Budweiser Co. in St. Louis which isn't a far drive from where Tara and Oliver live. Granted it is quite a few hours away but it'll be interesting. So we might be doing that one of the days i'm out there as well. 

I work tomorrow unfortunately. I believe 2:30pm-11:00pm. I am beginning to HATE working at Starbucks. but then again once i get those paychecks i can't help but love my job, especially getting paid $6.75/hr to either make people drinks or take their orders. And of course I need this job to pay bills. I also work Wednesday at Starbucks as well. of course i need to work before i leave. so i have a paycheck to come home to at least!

I got my haircut FINALLY after putting it off for about 4-5 months! glad i finally broke down and decided to get it cut. it was definitely getting way too long for my liking. so now it looks cute and not too short and not too long i guess is how to describe it. and i have bangs again! yay!

other than all that. nothing really is going on. i'm pumped to get outta here for the weekend and to see Tara and Oliver seeing as i haven't seen them since they came back during the summer to pick up the Big Red. so this will definitely be a fun and EXCITING weekend!

later on."

today i haven't really done too much. Except relax all day and play with Bella. I work tonight 6pm-11pm. not too bad. i can handle only 5 hours of work. even though i hate working til close cause that's the only shift i work now. I haven't opened for WEEKS ((not like i mind or anything, i really hate being at work 5:45am!)) So after work tonight i have NO clue what is going on at all! I might be going out to jason's for the night after work, but we'll see. Depends.

New years is right around the corner. Actually this up coming weekend. I can't believe how fast this year has flown by! I'm sure you're wondering what my plans are for New Years right? Well that's a GREAT question because I don't even know what's going on yet! Oh the possibilities! haha...rrriiiggghhht! There's only so many things I can end up doing for New Years.

Tomorrow i have another day off work! YAY! and i'm taking Bella for her FIRST vet appointment. should be interesting. i have NO clue how she's going to react but i'm sure she'll be fine. 

But other than that. i'm really not doing anything exciting. All I do lately is work and that's about it. I'm out."

today was definitely great having the day off. i spent the whole day with bella and just playing with her and takin care of her. and obviously taking care of myself since i'm still sick.

tomorrow i work 6pm-11pm. not too bad. only a 5 hour shift. i definitely don't mind just working 5 hours. hopefully i'm feeling better tomorrow whenever i wake up. HOPEFULLY!!!

"event","So it's Christmas, OBVIOUSLY!!! so before i head back out to jason's for the night i thought i'd post up my christmas day events that went on today.

last night was Christmas Eve and i had to work at starbucks. I got called in early cause apparently they were EXTREMELY busy throughout the afternoon with last minute shoppers. well by the time i got there it died down quite a bit. And as the afternoon went on and it started to get into the evening hours we really died. So...we got to close EARLY! thank god! i got out of work at 7:30pm last night. I spent the night out at jason's house so we could wake up by his mom Gwen coming over to the house at probably 7:30am so we could open presents. And since it was christmas eve jason had his pager on for any fire calls/accidents and luckily it was actually a pretty quite night.

Today, i got woken up by his mom texting him asking if her and her boyfriend, Bob, should come over at 7:30am and jason told them not to come over until 11am. THANK GOD! Then we went back to sleep and around 9:30am jason's fireman pager went off about a structure fire out in clymer. Apparently someone left their christmas lights on their tree which ended up getting over heated and catching the tree on fire. REALLY SMART PEOPLE!!!! so while jason was away i tried to go back to sleep but couldn't i got a phone call from jason's Grandma Rhodes asking where jason was and i told her. she told me she was coming over to drop off our presents she got us and i told her ok. Gwen messaged me as i was on the phone with Grandma Rhodes asking where i was and i told her i was at the house. Gwen called about 30 seconds after Grandma Rhodes hung up with me telling me her and Bob were on their way over as well and i told her how jason was called to a structure fire. Gwen and Bob came over at 11am jason got back just as they came in. and Grandma Rhodes got there just a little after jason got back. So we opened our presents...and here is what i got...
1. A pair of ""Naughty"" boxers
2. A pair of Camo Boxers
3. A NEW pillow for jason's bed for me to sleep on cause my old one was extremely flat
4. A comfy blanket
5. John Deere socks
6. Disney/Pixars ""Cars"" DVD
7. Ankle socks
8. Candle
9. Bella (my puppy) *early christmas gift from jason*
10. $30 Gift certificate for AE
11. $25 from Grandma Rhodes
and that's about it. so here's a funny story that happened today while we opened presents. I got jason's mom this muffin tin of 6 different candles you can pick out and put in it and you can burn the candles in the tin. Well Gwen opened it and after she opened it she decided to show it to Grandma Rhodes. WELLlllll...Gram thought the candles were for her from me and basically just took them home. haha. oh well! what can you do? FREAKIN hilarious though. so Bob, Jason, and myself of course gave Gwen shit for it. saying how Gram's car probably smelled good and how she played ""senile"" to just swipe some christmas gifts, how if Gwen wanted to smell her candles she'd have to go over to Gram's house to be able to smell them, and of course told her what candles i got her in the tin. haha. So after that jason and i went over to Aunt Debbie's for the family shindig and there was this grab bag thing. I actually pulled out a candle and Gwen was like OH OF COURSE SHE PULLS OUT THE CANDLE! haha! but i gave it to her cause i really didn't need it. Then dan and his girlfriend get the other candles that were in the grab bag as well! and Gwen couldn't believe that either! Jason loved his hunting backpack i got him as well.

but i'm headed out to jason's for the night. Hope everyone's Christmas was JOYFUL!!!

P.S.
CONGRATULATIONS TO JUSTIN AND SARA!!!! since they are OFFICIALLY engaged now!"

"event","So lately i have come back to the conclusion that i have officially become a coffee slave for starbucks. granted, i do like my job and everything but working till close for 3 days in a row really can wear a person out. Last night i worked 4:15pm-12:00am and tonight i work 3:30pm-12:00pm. And i also work on Christmas Eve 4pm-11pm. now i don't mind working evenings cause that gives me a chance to sleep in. but during my month off on break i would rather work mornings so i can at LEAST get to do things in the evening. and when i get off work yeah, i want to go out but by the time i get home to get changed to go out i'm exhausted! and seriously, who the hell goes to starbucks on christmas eve for coffee!? people should be at home spending time with family for christmas eve not at starbucks ordering coffee!!!

other than working the rest of the weekend...the holidays are obviously coming. tomorrow is christmas eve! i obviously work, however, HOPEFULLY after i get outta work i am going to jason's house and spend the night at his house. i at least got New Years Eve and New Years Day off next week...then at least i can go out and party it up! but who knows on that decision of partying it up on new years, i want to but wanting to and doing so are two completely different things.

Now that i'm home i'm getting back into the swing of things. last night i was STILL drained from the plane ride home thursday from Florida. but i worked through it and made it through work alright. Jason and i are doing great! i'm glad i'm home to see him and spend time with him again and i'm also glad to be home to play with my puppy Bella. so things are back to normal up here now...everything is the usual. Nothing is happening up here really which is also nothing new. when IUP is out for vacations Indiana, PA is DEAD! However, since i've lived here all my life i'm used to the laid back character of the town.

but i believe i'm goin to head out and relax for the next couple hours until i have to head to starbucks and slave away. HOPEFULLY i'm not on bar or anything, maybe DT or something else. later on."

yesterday i left Florida and i started to cry when i had to leave. of course homer asked if i was crying and i responded saying yes and so he asked why. and i told him that i'm going to miss him. he told me i'll have to come down again and i'm welcome to come down anytime. so possibly over the summer i'll be able to go back down.

today i have to work at starbucks from 4:15pm-12:00am...GAAAAaaayyyyy!!! kinda really don't wanna work tonight but i need the money. i obviously have to pay bills now that i'm home from florida and my small vacation. i also have to work tomorrow and even on x-mas eve. but oh well...it's a job and since i need the money i gotta go and work through it. even though i hate working til close but it's all good.

Then we went to sonics for dinner cause that's where the Tallahassee Muscle Car Club meets every tuesday, but we didn't stay long. we got our food and headed back.

today is my LAST official full day down here. we are going shopping. i'm goin to pick up a few FSU things while i'm down here. cause i wanna take a few things back with me of course! i think we're goin to go to the tallahassee mall too. cause homer has some x-mas shopping he needs to get done. haha.

so since i finally got a ride on a crotch rocket yesterday...it makes me want one even more now! haha. i mean i could probably get one and pay a loan on it and have no problem affording it. the insurance is what's the bitch! but oh well. down in FL you don't have to pay insurance..how gay is that!?

But of course i'm missing my cutie jason more than the world itself. In a way i can't wait to come home and just spend time with him and cuddle with him all day! i'm actually kind of excited to come home after tomorrow. But today is my next to last day here, tomorrow is my LAST day here and thursday i'm headin home back to good ol' PA. of course i'm not going to be excited about coming home to cold ass temperatures or anything. seeing as i'm getting spoiled down here with 79 degree weather and sun! god...i love it!

um...i think today i'm headin to the beach. it's a good hour or so away but it'll be worth it! i absolutely <3 the beach!!! so that will be EXCITING! i'll probably be dorky and gay and collect seashells. but i always do that. just cause obviously i live in Pennsylvania and i can't go to the beach unless i want to drive 6 hours. sooo i usually collect seashells whenever i get the chance and i take them home. Other than that i have NO clue what else is goin on. I need to pick up some FSU gear while i'm down here and take home. i'll probably get a hoodie and something else. not too sure on that. Tonight might go out might not. depends on how freakin tired i am i guess.

Tomorrow no clue what the plan is. I'm either going to get a tour of the FSU campus tomorrow with homer or i might not. 

Thursday i'm coming HOME! i'll probably not want to leave when i have to just cause i have got forewarnings that i'm comin home to some cold ass temperatures. which obviously sucks ass. but of course weather in PA sucks...and it's December...so the cold weather is expected. But i will be cuddling and snuggling with my cutie when i get home so we'll keep each other toasty warm! yay! and i can't wait to see my puppy bella. i miss her like CRAZY!!!! 

but other than that. not too much is goin on. i have NO clue why i'm up so early but i crashed early last night and got enough sleep. sooo...i'm out. i'll update later!"

Tomorrow i'm leaving to head down to Florida for a few days to kick back with a couple of friends. you know, just a little get away after the stressful semester. i'm kinda not wanting to go but that's how i am all the time. i hate leaving jason behind cause i miss him like crazy no matter what. i tend to feel EXTREMELY lost without him as does he with me. But it's only for a couple days. I at least get a few days off work! thank god for that too. i've officially become a coffee slave to starbucks! ugh! I am also not wanting to go cause i feel bad for leaving Bella as well since i just got her and obviously i don't know how she's going to react with me being gone for a couple days and not seeing me. i'm sure she'll be fine, but she's my little baby and i'm going to miss her terribly.

Other than work and heading to Florida tomorrow. not too much is going on. Jason and i are doing great as always! and as soon as i get home from Florida on thursday i'm going directly to his house to hopefully see him!

But i'm out! i'm kinda nervous about flying for some odd reason. i guess it's because i haven't flown by myself for quite a while. like probably for a year i haven't flown by myself. kinda odd i guess. hopefully the new security thing isn't too dreadful and doesn't make the check-in process and getting to my gate too long of a wait. i'll update this as soon as i can, cause i'm taking my laptop with me just for obvious reasons."

"event","So the fall 2006 semester is coming to a close! THANK GOD! this semester literally has been the semester from HELL and i really don't know why yet. maybe i've gotten over stressed with all of my classes when i shouldn't have been. and maybe i slacked off due to the fact i had way too much time on my hands when i didn't have a job. but who knows. HOPEFULLY finals will actually help me out than destroy me! I can't believe that the semester is almost over! usually the fall semester drags on extremely slowly, but time really did fly by this semester. Next week is finals week...AHHH!!! that basically explains the feeling of finals. But of course i only have 3 finals to take, but then again they're in the 3 classes i have sucked in all semester. so i'm hopin to crack down on my school work, hit the books, and hopefully do extremely good on my finals. HOPEFULLY is a key word here! But of course after finals i get to fly down to FL and visit one of my best buds which will be a GREAT relief after all the stress that finals brings. and of course it will be a great time as well! i'm pretty pumped about goin down to FL and chillin for a couple days down there. Of course even though i don't have to pay for lodging of my plane ticket i still need to save the paycheck i get next week for spending money. I'm going to TRY and not spend too much of that paycheck because i want to save the majority of it.

so this week i work 30 hours total at starbucks. of course it's great pay i just don't really feel like working this week. haha. the crappy shifts are Saturday 6:30am-1:30pm and Sunday 7:30am-3:30pm. but oh well it's kind of nice at the same time cause i get off during the afternoon and that leaves me with most of the day to just relax. 

but i'm out for the night. later on."

"event","so yesterday was my 22nd birthday. of course it started out GREAT! i was supposed to get my car back yesterday and a bunch of us were supposed to go uptown and have a good time. but as the day gradually went on the good vibes basically ended up falling apart and my day just ended up getting shittier and shittier. So i didn't get my car back cause my axle moved a little on my car cause the axles that came with my new engine are too short. but of course look on the bright side of that, i'd rather have them find that out BEFORE they gave the car back to me. Then basically nothing happened with the uptown plans. Jason ended up getting pissy cause of shit that happened during the horrible storm system that rolled through yesterday.

Today wasn't much better. of course i don't work until 4pm today which is nice. BUT...i work until 11pm tonight at starbucks and i won't even get to see jason because of my hours of working tonight. I've been depressed all day just because of all this shit happening. i'm sick of so many people in this god forsaken town it's not even funny. Jason ended up being mad at me for something and he told me we'd talk about it later and is now not wanting to talk about it because he says that if he talks about it he'll just get mad again. soo...i guess we're fine. idk. i hate not knowing what i did wrong, it ends up eating at me and making me depressed. Along with that i'm sick of jude, he tried to talk to me about our race we're goin to have come spring 07 cause i'm sick of him talkin his car up and down when it's slow, and he's tryin to tell me where we'll have this race at and like i care at the moment cause i'm balling my eyes out! i'm like dude can't you read the away message?! i really don't want to be bothered. so he of course reads it and is like why are you depressed? because of your car? did you and j split up? i'm like NO and NO i wouldn't tell you anyways! it's really none of your business. and of course he's like well if neither of those 2 happened then there's not much else to really care about! now that is just plain rude. for all he would know one of my friends he doesn't know could have been killed or something! who the hell says that!? so of course i tell him look i have more of a life than you and trust me i can get depressed over more than 2 things. and he's like i have a life i just work a lot though. i'm like idc. so then he says haha peace. what a dick! this is the reason why i hate a LOT of people around the area. they just think that no one really has anything more than 1 or 2 things to care about and get upset about. 

so yeah...work...4-11pm. WOOOoooo...definitly not looking forward to that at all! but then again, i've had a shitty day so i'm really not looking forward to much of anything really. i've realized that i had it way easy for the past couple of months i didn't have a job. i got used to be able to spend time with jason every weekend cause i didn't have to go to work or anything. and now that i finally got a job i've realized that wow i had it really easy the past couple of months without a job. and of course not being able to see him this weekend kind of really sucks. kinda makes me depressed over that too. all i really want to do today is just lay next to him in his bed and cuddle and snuggle up really close to him and never let him go. 

but i'm out. i gotta finish getting ready for an AWESOME 7 hour shift at Starbucks! woo...at least i'm getting paid $6.75/hr + whatever tips i get!"

"event","ok so today i had training at starbucks 3pm-8pm. there went most of my day off!!! however i did enjoy sleeping in until about 12pm today! now that...was WONDERFUL!! jason came down and took me to work which was great! i'm so thankful i have him and he's willing to help me out when i really do need a helping hand. especially since i don't have my car back yet. :( not having my car back yet is really depressing! but i'm dealin with it. i'd rather have them take this long to get it done right so then i know i won't have any problems down the road with it. and i know they're doing their best to get it done as soon as possible! 
tomorrow consists of me training 10am-3pm. blech! i'm really getting sick of training! i'm so sick of coffee right now it's not even funny! at least with making all these drinks and tasting them and getting so sick of coffee i won't be drinking too much of it while i'm working there. however, tomorrow, i know i'm goin to make myself something caffienated to wake my ass up since i have training at 10am! after i get off work i have NO clue what i'm doing. probably taking a nap IF possible, depends on how much caffiene i have throughout the day, and i also have to start on doing some homework. i have a bonus problem for accounting to do and HOPEFULLY bre sends me an e-mail with our lab information so i can make graphs and start typing up my HPED 343 lab we did on tuesday. Oh, and i also need to start studying for my ECON 122 final that i have since it's CUMULATIVE!!! GAY!!!
i can't believe that next week i'll be 22!!! god...i'm getting OLD! i can't believe that my birthday is actually almost here though too. time sure has been flying by!! but the week after my birthday is also basically the last full week we have of classes until we start finals week. blech! like i said, time has been flying by!! i'm ready for this semester to be over however and of course have the entire month off for winter break! since i'm going to FLORIDA and ILLINOIS! which both will be ROCKIN and KICK ASS!!!
but i'm out since i have an EARLY start of the day tomorrow!"

"event","HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!!!! So today was a really good day! it was turkey day...YAY!!! good food and good times! i spent thanksgiving with my cutie jason of course. and we went to his aunt's house for thanksgiving dinner. which was definitely a good time. Extremely good food! Then once we got home we both ended up taking an after thanksgiving dinner nap which are always great! you gotta love those naps after you've ate some good thanksgiving food especially when it involves turkey. cause you know how it goes, turkey always makes you sleepy! so i ended up getting in a nice 2-3 hour nap, i just ended up passing out in jason's bed right next to him. 
tomorrow consists of me training at starbucks from 3pm-8pm. blech. but it should be a good time, i think it's just mainly espresso bar and making drinks. and that's about it. i'm HOPEFULLY goin out to my cutie's for the weekend. which he said i would. which is always a good thing cause i just love spending time with him and being with him for long periods of time. and the weekends are the greatest cause i usually spend all weekend with him all day. jason is picking me up tomorrow afternoon to take me to training cause since my training time is an odd time, my mom has work at 10am and of course she can't really take me to work and i can't take her to work and then have her wait until 8:30pm for me to pick her up in saltsburg. so instead, jason is going to pick me up, take me to work, and then my mom is picking me up at 8pm. what a busy day and i still have to find time to do some awesome homework over the weekend. i have economics homework, typing up my HPED 343 lab #3 along with making graphs for my group for the lab, and then doing my accounting bonus homework. 
but other than all that not too much is goin on. I also have another day of training to go through on saturday from 10am-3pm. oh goodie! i am SOOOooo sick of training and so sick of coffee. but later on."

"event","So today wasn't all that bad. of course i didn't get a rental car instead i was lucky to get a ride up to work from debbie. cause i couldn't afford a rental car seeing as all that enterprise had left to rent was SUVs or Minivans and to rent them for a total of 2 days would cost me $155 and there was NO WAY in hell that i would pay $155 for 2 days of renting a damn car! especially when all i wanted was a compact car and of course they didn't have any left. so training was definitely long and boring today. what else is new? although we did make a lot of yummy drinks and i did learn quite a bit of information that i needed to know. Of course from about 10am-11am i felt like complete crap cause i didn't get to eat any breakfast today and of course drinking a lot of caffeinated drinks on an empty stomach and the majority of them have  syrups in them...yeah it's not a good idea. lets just say it will make you feel like you gotta puke really fast! 
Tonight i'm meeting jason up at the mall at about 8:10pm before the mall closes cause he went back to kays trying to find me an anniversary gift and still had NO clue what to get me. soooo...i'm goin to meet him as soon as i'm able to and try and find something i like. i found what the diamond bow necklace looked like, and i'm kinda glad that he did take it back, cause i'm just not a bow type of person. i mean it's cute, but it's definitly not me. but i'll hopefully find SOMETHING! i just can't believe he didn't listen to me like a month ago when i told him what i wanted. of course that's a guy for you. they REALLY don't listen to us girls when it comes down that stuff like that. and then when they have to get us something they're basically shit outta luck cause they HAD to wait til the LAST minute! guys...when are you goin to learn...waiting til the LAST minute to shop is NOT a good idea!!! it's a very bad idea! but i have a feeling i'm goin to end up having to shop around FOREVER! and i'm still kinda upset that i have to now go with jason to find my anniversary gift and then just have him give it to me after he pays for it. i'm not too big into going and finding a gift for me and then standing right there when jason pays for it and not being surprised or anything. and if i can't find anything tonight, and i have to continue shopping around for my own gift i'll be even more depressed. although i am proud of him for getting me a present a month ago even though he didn't end up getting me what i told him i wanted, but it's the thought that counts! and knowing he went a month in advance is a HUGE step for him. even though it pretty much backfired in his face. and i know he's disappointed in himself and depressed about it that i now have to go with him and he wasn't able to get me anything yet. and he knows i'm kinda upset about it. like the main thing that upsets me is that i have to go with him to pick out my year and a half anniversary gift which is kinda retarded and pretty pathetic. Watch jason pay for it and then he just hands over the bag with my necklace in it. ooooooo....what a SURPRISE!! gee...i wonder what could be in the bag...oh that's right...it's what i just picked out like a minute ago!  idk...i just hate having to pick out my own jewelry when it comes down to something kinda special like our year and a half anniversary. i kinda wanted to be surprised you know? and HOPEFULLY i don't have to go through picking something out for my birthday or anything seeing as that's next week. which he asked me what i wanted and i said a bracelet but then he made a good point about what would i want for christmas then. So i told him to just get me a dozen of roses again for my birthday which is fine by me. i LOVE getting flowers and i'm pretty used to getting roses on my birthday. but he doesn't want to get me roses this year cause he got them for me LAST year...he wants to get me something different. so i have NO clue what to tell him on that one. i hate it when people ask me what i want for my birthday, cause i can NEVER think of anything i want on the spot, i really have to sit down and think about it.
but i'm out for now. later on."

"event","so today was jason's any my year and a half anniversary! yay for us!!! of course my day consisted of classes and training at starbucks til about 8:30pm tonight. of course it wasn't all that bad, it was quite easy. after i got done with training i headed out to jason's and we spent a few hours together cuddling and being cute and dorky together of course. he's getting my gift tomorrow cause he ran into a little dilemma today with what he wanted to get me. but that's ok...material things aren't what makes me happy...as long as i have him beside me and in my life i am very extremely happy and content. 

tomorrow is a busy day. i have to rent a car at enterprise tomorrow since my car still isn't done yet, but hopefully will be done tomorrow. and then i have training at starbucks 10am-4pm. at least i'm done at 4 and i'm not working til close or anything. but i'm still working a good 7 hours tomorrow. ick! i'm hoping to get my car back tomorrow at some point, i really wanna have it back tomorrow since thursday is thanksgiving and everything. kinda want it back BEFORE my birthday! 

Speaking of my birthday...how awesome is this!? i was scheduled to work 8pm-12am on my birthday and i just asked a question on the 12am thing cause i didn't think we were open that late. and Haylee ((my manager)) said we're not usually open that late but since we're all not used to closing up it will take us a longer amount of time to probably clean up and get outta here. and then she asked why or something to that extent. and i told her how that is actually my birthday, i mean i really don't mind working those hours or anything i just wasn't sure about the 12am thing. well when she heard it was my actual birthday she told me she was going to give that shift to someone else and let me have that day off for my birthday!!! yes...haylee is by far the most awesome manager/boss i've ever had!!! along with my birthday, jason has NO idea what to get me  and i told him to just get me roses again like he did last year, but he wants to get me something different and i have NO clue what to tell him to get me. cause whenever anyone asks me what i want i can't ever think of anything on the spot. but i'm sure he'll come up with something!

but i'm out for the night. i have a LONG day again tomorrow.

"event","so this week is starting off pretty good actually. amazing for once actually. Today i only had one class which i'm glad and we did get outta class early cause she didn't get as far as she did with the other section as she did with my section of ECON 122. so the professor let us out early today which was extremely nice. I also had training for Starbucks from 3-8pm which wasn't really training at all, it was basically unpacking boxes and putting all the shipments away and getting the store looking nice. And that basically made my day actually. I didn't get home until about...8:15 or 8:30pm and luckily i didn't have any homework to do tonight for tomorrow cause it wouldn't be done anyways. Cleaning, unpacking, and putting stuff away at starbucks definitely wore me out!
     Tomorrow i have a total of 2 classes. my accounting class is canceled tomorrow due to the fact that my new professor has to go away for some type of conference so he canceled all his accounting classes. I will be getting out of my HPED 343 class early as well because all we're doing tomorrow for class is doing a cardiovascular lab and once we're done getting all the data for that, we get to leave early and what not. However, i have training again tomorrow from 3:30pm-8:30pm at starbucks. blech! i am soo sick of training! i don't think i've EVER done this much training for a job EVER! but of course i kinda need it seeing as i don't know too much about coffee and i kinda need to know that kinda stuff. 
I basically have training ALL this week except for thanksgiving off and the 26th i have off. woo...2 days off in basically 2 weeks! go figure. i can see it now...before i go to Florida i'll be working like 35 hour weeks or something like that. but oh well...i'll have some really nice paychecks since i get paid $6.75/hr.
     Jason is a little out of it now. he gets like this every holiday season. he HATES the holidays. but of course he deals with it. but even though he deals with the holidays you can tell he's not happy when they're around. 
      Tomorrow is jason's and my YEAR AND A HALF ANNIVERSARY! i'm so excited!!! i can't believe we've been together for a year and a half. but in some ways it definitely feels like we've been together a lot longer than just a year and a half. but i'm happy and i do truly love jason more than anything! i wouldn't have wanted to spend this past year and a half with anyone else but my cutie jason!! i really couldn't ask for a better guy to be with and to have in my life.
       But i'm out. i have an early start to the day tomorrow. and even though i only have 2 classes tomorrow, my day is still EXTREMELY long all due to awesome training at starbucks for FIVE HOURS 3:30-8:30pm! woot! NOT! oh...and HOPEFULLY my car is done tomorrow...LETS ALL HOPE AND PRAY THAT IT IS!!!"

My car won't be done until friday or monday. they got the engine in yesterday but the wiring harness and motor mounts weren't the correct ones for my engine and car. so they had to order new ones and the company couldn't over night them but they were able to send them by 2 day shipping. and as soon as they're in they're going to work on my car immediately.

this week is becoming the WORST week EVER! i had an exam yesterday in HPED 343 which i think i did alright. HOPEFULLY! but i also have an exam in ECON 122 and i need to get a 90% or higher to boost my grade up hardcore. jason and i are alright i guess...except for the fact that monday i got a prank call from his phone from one of his friends telling me that he was in a serious accident and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Of course i ended up going up to the hospital cause i thought it was serious but while i was waiting in line to get information at the ER jason calls me from his cell asking me what i was up to and where i was and i told him that i'm at the ER looking for him and i didn't know how he was able to call me. He then asked why are you at the ER looking for me? and i told him i got a phone call from his friends telling me that he was in a serious accident and was taken to the hospital. Of course he told me the guy that called me was drunk, but being drunk is NO excuse for that type of prank call!

I'm excited about traning for starbucks on monday. i can't wait to start working there...it's goin to be an AWESOME job!!

other than that...nothin else is goin on."

"event","So i haven't really updated on what's been going on in my life so i guess i'll fill you in on it...

I got a new job FINALLY and i start training next week (Nov. 13) for Starbucks, the new one being built next to advanced auto. I start out making $6.75/hr. plus whatever tips i get on top of that. Training is from 5-9pm next monday and i am in training until the day Starbucks opens which is Dec. 8 (a week after my 22nd birthday). 

I am officially hating my fall semester. all my classes suck expecially HPED 343. Exercise Phys. is really going to be the death of me and i have come to the conclusion that i am horrible at economics. i don't know why yet but i am. and i'm also horrible at accounting!

My Accounting professor (Dr. Woan) quit last week...MID-SEMESTER! who the hell quits their job mid-semester!? so tomorrow i get to meet my NEW professor and hopefully they are decent and i actually understand what they're talking about.

I got pulled over friday night, well actually 5:30am Saturday when i was driving around waiting for jason to leave ENP cause i ran through a redlight by accident and actually almost took a borough cop's front bumper with me when i blew through the red light.Of course he actually was a nice guy and let me go with just disobeying the traffic signal and let me off for wreckless driving seeing as i was on my cellphone when i went through the redlight. However, since it was 5:30am he make me take a breathalizer test to make sure i was sober enough to drive. So that citation cost me $106.50, which i paid today at the Indiana Magistrates Office.

Jason's and my year and a half anniversery is this month (Nov. 21) and i have NO idea what the hell to get him! of course he doesn't make it easy for me considering that he won't give me any damn ideas of what to get him. He's easy to shop for but he's sooo easy to shop for i tend to think too hard into it and can't really figure out what to buy him without him giving me some ideas. Hopefully he'll give me some ideas of what he wants or needs.

My Honda is STILL not done. The engine goes in tomorrow. and the guy who is working on my car just decided to NOT come into work today. GREEEAAATT!!! what a fucking retard! He didn't even call or anything. So who knows what the hell is going on with him. However, Brian Vello and Brian Jordan were working on my car today putting in the Shift Linkage and piping for my manual transmission. I probably won't get my car back until wednesday.

and that's about it that i can think of to update you all on. but i'm out for now...later."

"event","What a night last night. let me tell ya! i mean it started out great. hung out with fetterman, jude, and bethany at ironwood. once fetterman left bethany and i decided to head uptown to the bars. Of course we went to al patti's and then we went to wolfies where apparently jason was at however we didn't even see him at all even when we were up on the balcolny. oh well. I ended up having to give bethany a ride home last night cause jude decided to go home after fetterman left. So after i took bethany home i headed back uptown to go back to the bars but by the time i got there they were closed. I ran into jason outside wolfies and he thought i was ""doing detective work"" again to find him. and i literally got into a screaming fight with him about how i was up there and luckily mccurdy was right there to verify that he did see bethany and i at wolfies together. So after jason and i argued for a good bit we talked in his truck and then he wanted to go to eat n park with mccurdy and some other friend of mccurdy's. So he told me he wouldn't be that long and of course he was there longer than i thought he was going to be. I ended up driving around all night cause i got bored hangin out at wal*mart waiting for him. As time went by it got to 5:30am and i finally decided to make up some excuse to be able to wake up my mom and go to sleep. And right on my way home i ACCIDENTALLY went through a red light and got pulled over. I had to take a breathalizer test and the cop gave me a fine for $106.50 for disobeying the traffic sign and what not. At about 6am this morning jason calls me after he was finished at eat n park and wanted me to come out and i told him if i would come out now i would have to get up in 3 hours to get home and give my mom her car so she could get to work. And of course he understood and volunteered to pick me up but ended up that didn't happen. So i slept in until about 1:30pm this afternoon. Jason wanted me to come out this afternoon to watch college football but seeing as he slept in as well he has to do some work around the house first. So as you can see...i had another night from hell.

Today i haven't really done too much except do nothing and lay around the house basically all day. i have to go up to the indiana borough police station to pay for my citation and then HOPEFULLY i'm going out to jason's sometime today."

I start training Nov. 13.

So this long weekend i had was DEFINITLY great! my engine swap has BEGUN! hopefully will be done by friday...but who knows. I need to start learning how to drive a manual car. I got a new job.

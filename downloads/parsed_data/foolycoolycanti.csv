Rilo Kiley + Coldplay = Win!

Absolutely kickass show last night at the Garden.  I was surprised at how well Rilo Kiley was recieved by the crowd, let alone Kris, Balber, and Mike.  They tore shit up in the metaphorical sense.  Great live act. I've decided that when they come around again on their own tour, they're a must see.

Coldplay?  That was ridiculous.  Clocks and In My Place were the highlights of the night.  But the coolest moment was during White Shadows when they (well, the screen behind them) told everyone to take out their cameras and take pictures on cue.  Pretty fucking cool with all those flashes.  And giant yellow balloons during Yellow!"

Ants07: Your name is Brandon. You're gay. Choked on penis. Died. The end.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto response from IslezRule: writing my life story 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ants07: if you didn't see that coming, for shame
IslezRule: good one
IslezRule: PRICK
Ants07: its an A paper buddy
IslezRule: ur moms an A paper
Ants07: B+, there were some typos
IslezRule: haha
IslezRule: back to the paper....
Ants07: later

It made me chuckle.  Hopefully you too.

Note, that I also found a rough draft of a never-before-posted LJ post in a Word document similar in format to the AIM convo above.  It was something of a best of but this intrigued me the most:

""Note:  I did paste something here, a conversation between myself and Brandon.  However, the extent of the racism probably violates the Terms of Service of the internet, let alone LiveJournal.com.  That and the whole thing is funny as fuck...assuming you're not the least bit PC.  Mail me if you want it.""

The only problem is, I don't know what I'm looking for. =(


P.P.S:  I have a TON of LJ rough drafts apparently, some are possibly complete.  Why didn't I post these?"

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>=D</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hi.&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; It's me.&nbsp; Time for another tri-monthly update in the virtual pity party that is Livejournal.com.&nbsp; I'm chewing gum at the moment.&nbsp; It is Dentyne <STRONG>ICE</STRONG> <EM>Shiver Mint</EM>.&nbsp; That's about the biggest thing going on right now.&nbsp; I could watch ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" but seeing as it is the only Christmas present that I have not opened and used in it's entirety, I'm saving that for a later date.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Probably tomorrrow.</P>
<P>I decided that for my New Year's Resolution I will stop eating children.&nbsp; Now, I know what you are all saying: ""But Chris!&nbsp; You don't eat children!""&nbsp; Not anymore.&nbsp; Resolution fulfilled.&nbsp;&nbsp;I win again.</P>
<P>I really want to go to a concert.&nbsp; U2 is rumored to be coming to NYC in March sometime, like 17th-20th.&nbsp; That's cool and all (I'm gunning for general admission tickets, as long as they're not too expensive), but I want a smaller venue like Irving Plaza or the Bowery.&nbsp; No one I like&nbsp;is playing in the near future though. *tear*</P>
<P>On the subject of Eternal Sunshine, I thought about taking a trip on the trains to Montauk.&nbsp; After looking at the train schedules, that movie is full of shit.&nbsp; Of course, it was probably filmed before the MTA decided to cut services and raise fares (at the same time mind you), but no more than five trains run from Montauk eastward to New York within a 24 hour period.&nbsp; Miss the 2:51pm and your ass waits until after 10.&nbsp; It's $11 one way off peak too.&nbsp; Dangerous stuff.</P>
<P>I guess I could start working on my resume.&nbsp; I don't really know what to put on it, but I just spent four years in philosophy and English classes working for a bachelors in natural science.&nbsp; Bullshit should come easy.&nbsp; I watch my cousin play football so I am an active volunteer with the Baldwin Bombers (Actually, this is true.&nbsp; I do help out.)&nbsp; I donated $10 to the Democrats during the Republican Convention so that&nbsp;makes me an active participant in the Democratic party.</P>
<P>Nevermind that they lost and I want that money back.</P>
<P>I know the best and most efficient routes around Disney World.&nbsp; Time management with my mother becomes so problematic that on our last trip to Disney, we spent more time in the hotel than in the parks.&nbsp; Yet we managed to ride the crap out of nearly every working ride.&nbsp; I don't do ""It's a Small World.""&nbsp; My religion forbids it or something like that.&nbsp; Well, it might be the fact that it's the same doll reproduced thousands of times, singning the same song over and over again.&nbsp; If this isn't an advertisement for cloning, I don't know what is.</P>
<P>In truth, you could put every ride at Disney World in a negative light.&nbsp; Splash Mountain actively supports the isolation of ""wolves"" from the Brer community.&nbsp; The Haunted Mansion and the Tower of Terror both portray early 20th century buildings and people as creepy and unfit for civilzation.&nbsp; Aerosmith's Rock and Roller Coaster wants you to drive drunk!&nbsp; Epcot works as long as you don't mind being assaulted by AT&amp;T, General Motors, or every other company in the Western world.&nbsp; I thought the BCS bowl games were getting out of hand but I draw the line at Wedgewood's Tea Cups of the Future.</P>
<P>This is how fucking bored I am.</P>"

"event","As per the norm, I'm crushed with biochemistry once again.  I hate this subject so much which sucks cause I'm somewhat decent at it.  It's sad too.  I'm not procrastinating at all in this class.  My professor just likes to assign work on a whim.  AND SHE'S ON A CRUISE IN SOUTH AMERICA THIS WEEK.  What the fuck?  I think I've had more work in this class than all my others combined.  So since I have a cumulative, 23 chapter final, a protein synthesis-metabolism report, 35 definitions, and a paper on some new microplate techniques I don't think I'm going out this weekend.  Much like the last two.

Is it a problem if I enjoy theology more than I do biology?  This raises some red flags.

Speaking of red flags, the Mets have all but signed Pedro.  I'm up in the air about this one.  If this is the Big Move of the Offseason(tm), then I don't like it.  I'm naive enough to think we can get 2 good years out of him, maybe 3.  And I think the Mo Vaughn comparisons are a little excessive.  That was a guy who did Twinkies like it was HGH.  Pedro just has some wear and tear in his shoulder.  He's had it for a few years and done well in Fenway, a hitters park.  Now he comes to Shea which is a great pitchers park.  It's not a bad move, it gives us some street cred and attitude (something we've been missing for awhile now) but I really want a bat and some defense.  Delgado at first and Magglio in right would make me happy.  One of the two is probably realistic.

If you couldn't tell, I'm procrastinating.  But what I'm proscratinating is odd.

Our shower is broken.  The drain is clogged so it takes a while for it to drain out.  Today it's really bad.  My mother took a shower at about 6.  I got up at 8 to go to the bathroom and the tub was halfway filled.  Yum.  But that's not the bad part.

We have two full baths in my house.  The big secret (aside from the roof getting ready to blow off) is that we don't use the downstairs shower.  We as in people.  The dog, however, is a different story.  The downstairs shower is used maybe twice a year.  Unfortunately, I have to use it today.  It's clean in the sense that it doesn't look dirty.  But, well...

I'm going to feel dirty all day.  And not the good drrrty. (<-I hate myself for that.)"

"event","I hate my school.  I procrastinate and I get a moderate crush of work for Sunday night.  I actually do work when it should be done and I'm fucked.  Truly and utterly fucked.  Within the last week, I've had more work than most semesters total.  This parade of biochem hellspawn won't end until Nov. 15, so next Saturday might be the same as this Saturday:  studious.  Normally, that's a positive word.  But for someone who studied for 5 tests in his high school career, it's dirtier than the word ""Hasselhoff.""

Lately, I've been bored beyond words.  I don't know why.  Maybe I need a girlfriend.  Someone to shake things up.  It works for baseball teams.  Move the lineup around, go on a 12 game win streak.  At least I hear it works.  I'm a Met fan. =/

But I don't want to settle and I need someone who makes me look normal.  Complacent on the outside, batshit crazy on the inside.  I don't meet many new people so it becomes difficult.  However, I don't want to be set up.  This is just me complaining.

le sigh~

Back to copying biochem answers from the back of the textbook..."

But that didn't stop me from seeing Team America: World Police!  E-fucking-lite.  I noticed not many people were laughing in the theater, as it did go over the top sometimes.  It was probably the bloodiest movie I've seen in awhile.  It was still funny nonetheless.  They used the montage song from the ski episode (Stan...DARSH!)   Trey Parker and Matt Stone are awesome.  And the new season of South Park starts Wednesday!

Binghamtom is Thursday!  Reluctantly, I've decided to go as Quailman.  Now I like the idea to go as Awesome-o/Cardboard box robot, but, for the sake of convenience and sitting down, it's Quailman.  Just have to get some red fabric for my Q and cape.  I also have to figure out how Doug gets his belt to stay on his head like that.  He won't return my calls.  Fucking asshole.

Now this is not to say that I won't, at some point, be a cardboard robot.  If anything it makes the dream that much more sweeter.  If Adam has another party around Christmas time, I'll dress up and throw fruit at people.  I'm an evil robot.  An evil-rotten fruit throwing-cardboard robot.

I don't know what the hell I'm talking about and my middle and ring fingers on my left hand keep spazing out.

Happy Brandon?  I updated.  Now leave me alone for another 6 months."

Will she be legal by then?  No?  Well, murder's illegal anyway.

Fucking Fordham.  Thanks for the essays!  Oh a test on the Wednesday following my paper on who knows what the hell I just typed out?  Of course!  Who wouldn't mind that?"

"event","Schoolwork sucks and, as per the norm, I left it to the last minute.  Well almost the last minute.  I started on Saturday and it's not due until Tuesday.  That counts for something in my world.

So on Friday night it was brought up that I never update this livejournal.  It's true.  It might be a monthly thing.  And it's not very good.  Who would want to look forward to it?  I know I wouldn't.  If there was any, it certainly wouldn't live up to the hype.  So why have a livejournal?

The normal LJ (I'm lazy, Eat me.) consists primarily of daily activities and feelings.  That's cool if it's your thing but it's not my cup of tea.  My daily activity today consisted of waking up, eating a bagel with whitefish (awesomeness^2), then failing miserably in my search for shoes.  After that I proceeded to the task of that homework that was mentioned in the first paragraph.  I had a few IM conversations that involved killing roaches (Keep up the good fight Marissa) and a picture of Stewie patting his genitals (Thanks Sean!) while watching Outbreak.  And here we are now.

Were there emotions involved?  Absolutely.  Especially because FootLocker is having a ""2 for $90"" sale and I managed to find two pairs of shoes.  Granted it's the same style shoe in different colors but two nonetheless. They didn't have anything higher than a 9 1/2 though (If anyone asks, I have a size 30 shoe.  If you don't get that kill yourself).  I was dejected.  I was heartbroken.  I was hungry.  A frozen pizza fixed all three.

But the LJ (Em.) exists for me solely for the point of pointless posts like this.  Last night I threw out some topics in Word with some sentences I intend to use in the associated postings.  Unfortunately I don't have the time at the moment to start them up.  

Maybe next month."

Disney World is awesome, even when gallons of fluid leak out of your nose!  The Norberg family owns a time-share at the Boardwalk resort.  In a 1930's carnival setting, the resort has a number of stores including a bakery, general store, and ESPN Sportszone, all indicative of the time-period.  What I thought was best about the resort was the room we stayed in the first night (booking problems forced us to book a room for one night and one room the other five).  It smelled like cinnamon apple!  Usually rooms have a sterile, borderline hospital quality, as if to cover up the fact the previous guests decomposed in the beds.  The room may harbor the souls of lost tourists but damn did it smell nice!

The other room not so much.  Whenever we came back from a park, it smelled of ass.  Well not really ass, but it was somewhat rank until the doors to the balcony were opened!  And they opened to a view of the pool!  Yes the pool you perverts!  However, I've never had such hatred of a tree.  I don't know what kind of tree it was, I don't pretend I'm a biologist (uhm...), but it was arbor-annoying.

The parks were still as fun as the normally are.  Animal Kingdom was fun for about 4 hours and we never went back.  They had these dinosaur characters walking around that were hilarious.  Indescribable but hi-fucking-larious.  Let's see...pull your arms in like a T-Rex, kinda like your wrists come from your chest.  Now open your mouth as wide as you can.  Do the same with your eyes.  Make the only movable joints your wrists and hip and that's kinda what they looked like.

We took this tour of the Magic Kingdom that brings you backstage.  It was cool but the mystery and mystique of those tunnels beneath Disney were shot to hell.  It looks like a hospital basement.  However, I personally believe that there are far more tunnels hidden beneath those tunnels.  But I learned a lot of secrets about Main Street and whatnot.  It is 5 1/2 hours of walking though so that hurt.  2 blisters.

I guess that's it.  Read the DaVinci Code!  It's good and fast."

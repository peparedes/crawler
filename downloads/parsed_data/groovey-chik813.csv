"event","Hey, 
It's been awhile i know, but things have been hectic. With school, workin, and just life in general. Also i've been doin alot extra so i can get my mind off alot of other stuff. Alot of shit has been goin on with my cousin, Josh, and I. i like him...but he liked my cousin, there fore she told me that she would never date, n e one i liked, and then she turns around and does it. so oh well, but still it's been eating at me constantly. but i have a better chance of...gettin someone else, so therefore, i'm excited with that. but yet, all these things are conjoining together to make me one messed up person inside. But things might be better if i didn't try my hardest to get things goin good with Tasha and josh, even tho i don't want that to happen...oh well. to much shit to worry bout. I'm just excited that it is almost time for xmas. it's gonna be great. New years will be awesome again...gonna go to tasha's like last year and have a grand ole time. ! i'm hopin to get back to my regular summer routine for the next week! but i'm not sure if that will happen. oh well i need to get goin again...ttyl loves everyone! 
bye

"event","Life in general is startin to suck ass. I think it all starts at the age 16, life wasn't complicated before then. No petty little fights with your best friends and then turning around and being best friends again, no stress, no depression, no threats, just good happy thoughts. Now a days, forget it, things will never be the same again. we have innocent people die, and murderes get away with odvisously murder. We can hardly go to school and feel safe n e more, always have some crazy person deciding to threatin the school, wha's the world coming too?

n e who i'm done....talk to ya lata

"event","last night was so full of emotions from happy to sad to angry to happy again. but at least i had a good friend to go thru it with me. I got some good help from here and i didn't have to pay her. everyone's always wanting me to go to a shrink. well i know yea it might help but i know what there gonna say, Tell me wha's wrong, and we need to fix this. and i feel that if tha's what there gonna tell me then y pay money to hear it when i already know tha's what i need to do. but nothing against the people tha's there job i understand. I just don't see my self doin that, plus my trust is easily broken and it's part of whats keepin me from doin it to. In a way i'm glad last night happened i needed it but then again it feels like i'm relieing to much on my friend. It's gonna end up like it did with a couple of other friends, we now are not friends and i couldn't stand looseing these to. There sisters and they seem to know about everything i've been thru. i luv em so much, were just like sisters too, i'm just adopted :). well n e who i gots to get goin ttyl !

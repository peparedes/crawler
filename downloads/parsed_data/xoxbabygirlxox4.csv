"event","Annelise left yesterday :'( I miss herrrrr But she'll be back on Friday! :-D Her, me, Ash, Meg, and Co are making a wicked doubly super fantastic dance together.. eventually, lol. It'll be cool when we FINALLY finish. I love Annelise! I can't ever stop laughing with her :)
~*~
We didn't end up going to OOB because Joe never bothered showing up... ((go figure)) So Annelise, Eben, and Troy ended up chillin out here for awhile doing absolutely nothing at all :)
~*~
This is gonna be a scary night.. I'm FINALLY sleeping in my own bed again but it's gonna be alone :-[ It's been awhile.. But last night Ash slept over again and we started watching the South Park movie.. *Inspiration right there*
~*~
Today Ash and I woke up around 8 and got ready to go to Funtown. There was a serious drought of hott guys there today but PLENTY of rain. I loved being wet.. lol. We saw a few towards the end but nothing too special. I saw Josh and Nick from Westbrook tho :) I mean it's only been about 2 years... Then we made friends with a nice guy at the pizza place we went to which was nice lol ASH AND I ROCK AT BUMPER CARS!!!! We spent most of the first time spinning around in circles lol, we had a target but we couldn't keep up with him! Then the second time I got better at driving and we chased this little fat boy around and slammed into him pretty good :) He caught on and tried to get us back but, we were too good for him..;-)
~*~
I'm SO going to bed somewhat early tonight.. I feel like I'm gonna die I'm so tired and stuff, I feel kinda sick as well :-/ We'll see how this week goes.. ONLY ONE MORE WEEK UNTIL MY B-DAY PARTY!=-o Yikesssss

"event","Holy cow it's been awhile huh?! Havent written since before semi! ((Which sucked by the way..)) But the ice cream afterwards was a lot of fun. Meg and I were WAY too hyper.

I miss Andy and Chelsea who just HAD to move to Florida :( They left last month but some of you might not have known that since I didn't write about it. I'm hoping to visit them after I get birthday money to go down there.. I miss then :-[

Last week I went camping at Sebago State Park with my babygirl Ali Knight:-D I love her sooooooooooooooooooooooo much! We went ""fatty dipping"" and all that cool stuff. Then we went on the boat for the 4th to watch the Portland fireworks and her bf Chris came along and we met this guy from London who has a cool accent but makes me lose at bull shit because I don't understand him. We went to bed at what? 5:30 and it was real hard w/the damn birds chirping and it being really bright out!>:O

Ashley slept over Wednesday night and boy was I hyper! Whose Line Is It Anyway caused me to violently slap Ashley because I was laughing so friggin hard..Nice life

Thursday Megan slept over and we decided we were gonna dye our hair. We told Co about it and she came over the next day. Then we went dye/highlight shopping and I got my haircut. We also went around getting applications but everywhere we went ((including our beloved Blockbuster and Walmart)) said we had to be 16 or 17 which BITES. Anyway, we stayed up til 1 and we were still doing our hair. I did a GREAT job on Co's blonde highlights even tho I was very much doubted.. but I am a jeenius :)Megan's dye didn't work lol, so I used Co's leftover highlight stuff but you can only see them if it's in the sunlight. As for mine... well they were supposed to be brownish highlights but came out as a reddish tint which I guess is alright but you'll hafta see for yourself. My haircut is pretty kick ass tho :-D They sleptover of course but we didnt really ""sleep"" we went to bed at 6 am and Co ended up leaving at 8!=-O

Meg and I went to Old Orchard with Eben, Joe and Harbi<<English dude. We had an interesting time... we only saw two groups of hott guys and the one that followed us everywhere was the least hott but still hott lol. One was a SIZZLING hott but we only saw them once cuz after we ate they disappeared before we talked to them. There are SO many perverted old guys down there! Oh em gee.. We saw a really hott skater guy *melt* Cept he was 24 :-[ lol seriously.. THEN we had a very interesting time with the ketchup that i just HAD to dump all over us lol. It was gushing between my toes as well which was great. Then we came back and started watching a movie.. and Joe and Megan held hands!O:-) How cuteeee!

Then last night my beautiful Ashley slept over :-D Late night again.. I swear I'm gonna die from lack of sleep! She's gonna pick me up again later today to get her bellybutton pierced and hopefully I can too !:)

Tomorrow Annelise is coming over!!! and she's staying til Friday because I'm having a ""get together"" to plan out my party and Meg, Annelise and I are gonna make a dance because we're cool like that. On one of those days I'm going to Old Orchard too hopefully with Annelise, Meg, Ash, Joe, Eben, Cameron, and Troy.. MAYBE.

Yeah.. that's all I got for now, Don't let me go so long without writing next time!"

"event","Ashley ((<~ awesome chica)) came over today after school w/out a bus pass but a fake note.. The bus driver actually let her on but was really scary because she called the bus garage and found out no one called. Oh well.. then we ate a bunches of food after Ashley tried on the dress she was gonna wear to semi that she's borrowing. We went out to tan and then were gonna play our pretend volleyball but she got picked up :(

I got a 100 on my civics test!! woot!

Yesterday I stayed home cuz I was real tired and wanted a day off since I havent missed school at all this year. It was pretty cool. I babysat later in the afternoon for two hours which really wasnt bad. I told the youngest kid about 4-leaf clovers and he spent about an hour looking for it.. I'm a master already :-P

I'm really excited for this weekend cuz I actually have something to do.. I just hope it works out!! It would suck major if it didn't.

Wow, nothing really happened at all since I last wrote. Maybe tomorrow I'll have more to say.. I better have something after this weekend! OH YEAH.. You all should go to the semi-formal. I know it kinda sucks but... you should still go :-D

Andy might stay with me for awhile while his parents go to Florida. That'd be totally kick ass if it actually happens! Then its like.. whoa, SHOWER BUDDY! hahah jp O:) yeah.. hahah But seriously, it'll be awesome cuz i luvers him! :)

Just wanted to give a shout out to my boyy Carrrrll yupp, hes great! But I still love my Lena bunches!! She's leaving tomorrow for six flags :'( I'll miss her lots n* lots...

"event","Okay I keep saying I'll write in here like, everyday but I always end up taking it out of my profile or just get too distracted to finish it!! So let's recap on some things that have happened in the past week again...

-*((MY LAST WEEK))*-not too interesting might as well skip it lol

*Last saturday-Hmm.. as far as I can remember I THINK Troy came over but I'm not really sure what happened lol. I dont know why I cant remember!!

*Last monday-A few things happened but nothing to really mention.

*Last tuesday-Hahah I got like, An hour of sleep... woot. Hung out at Corsettis w/some ppl, then did cartwheels with kaprice during practice after being yelled at by the team to get out of their precious dug out.. and talked w/melissa and danielle for a bit. Then the freshman baseball game started and I watched that w/Joe S. while he was screaming random cheers and the opposing team looked like they were gonna shoot him lol. The dug out needs to be more enthusiastic by the way.. Not that it mattered because once again, we got CRUSHED and more pathetically.. but POLAND! But maybe I should stop saying that because since we're losing to crappy teams.. we're obviously not any good. But getting better? :) Then I had an induction for the Spanish Honor Society which i almost DIED at! oh man it sucked..

*Last wednesday-Nothing too interesting.. went to OOB for dinner tho :)

*Last thursday-Passed on the bus and hung out w/some ppl on the team before there game.. which they LOST AGAIN and then ended up staying at corsetti's til about 6 o'clock. Oh joy.. at least Grace Ciaran and Joshy were there.. Then I went and got my dress for semi and then ate with my aunt from virginia.. got home kinda late

*Yesterday-Went to the see Mean Girls w/Lena Andy Matt and Troy. Movie sucked lol.. then we hung at Burger King for about an hour where Matt yet again, managed to get in a fight w/the ignorant workers because he didnt get ""spicy chicken"" he just got ""chicken"" .. yeah, that was arite. Awkward moments and I have a big mouth. But i was entertained anyway :-D

We're sitting here watching Mean Girls and as someone on the movie starts making out, I lean over to Lena..

Me*Hey Lena
Lena*Huh?
Me*I'm wicked horny..
Lena*::BlankStare::
Me*Will you help me tonite ;-) *nudge*
Lena and me*HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Lena*::slap on the arm::
Me*OWWWWWWW... wait, that didnt hurt ::slap!::

Yeah.. I guess you'd hafta be there?
~*~

Then in the bathroom Lena leaves her cell on top of her sweatshirt by the sink while she pees. I take the cell, run out of the bathroom, throw it to Cooki, Troy, and Andy then run back inside..
Lena comes out, washes her hands, pick up her sweatshirt.. then wonders what happened to her cell phone. She looks in the stall she was in and starts FREAKING out cuz its not there. We get outside of the bathroom and Lena starts yelling at matt troy and andy to give it back but since they werent in the bathroom, they couldnt take it. Not that she even saks me at all but I'm an angel, why would I do such a thing? O:) 
Lena heads back into the bathroom while the four of us start laughing hysterically, then we shut up when she comes back out.. she starts freaking out saying its $100. *We try hard not to laugh*..
After quite a long time, finally Cook tells her her cell on the water fountain right beside her. *We start laughing*..*Lena tries to kill Matt*.. *Troy holds her back*..
I had taken the cell.. but even after we told her, she wasnt even mad at ME.. But she was pretty pissed long after she got it back.. and it was funny.

I know.. good story right? I guess you'd have to be there for that one too..

*Last night/early this morning-Lena slept over!!!! It was fun, we talked a lot about everything as usual and established that she was going to stay at my house for a whole weekend in two weeks. I put on my semi dress and when I opened the door she stood there speechless w/her mouth wide open.. lol, I hope it actually looks as good as she said :-D Its too bad she had to leave early for a car wash :-/ We had great sex tho.. even tho it wouldve been better if Whitney had joined in ;-)I felt bad for my Lena tho.. she felt all bad for me.. hahah It was really funny cuz she was more upset for me than me.. cuz I wasnt upset. Figure that one out. :-P


-*((EXTRA COMMENTS))*-

Hmm.. well, I would normally say that I really hate Erika but I dont really lol. Well I do, but its just so much fun that its like a game and I dont really hate her. Even if her and her.. ""friends""... try to intimidate me, its just so retarded that it makes me laugh :) It's nice to stay in this hate-hate relationship. Not to mention I made a few friends because of this.. it's cute. lol

Okay something that's bugging me. If I show the fact that I'm not entirely happy, everyone throws a fit saying Im depressed and in need of attention and a self-conscious super bitch. But if I put a smiley in my friggin profile or away, ya'll start bitching at me because i'm too happy when I shouldnt be! wtf.. make up yur mind! lol I have more to say but cant say it without saying more than I want most of you to read.

I love Lena.. I really do. LoL and I miss my Annelise :( I hope she can come next saturday!!!!!!-I know that I promised to do this a long time ago Brett but its better now than never right? BRETT IS THE HOTTEST PERSON ALIVE AND MY PERSONAL SEXY BUDDY ;-) He is the man.. he kicks ass. And i love him :-D Seriously, if you dont know Brett.. you shouldnt be living :-P

~*~
Forgot to mention we saw Dylan Dodge and Dan Tracy.. then later we were all comtemplating whether or not a skinny ""it"" in a dress was a man or woman.. then we found out it was a woman once we heard her talk. Somehow Andy wasnt convinced..

Ahh well I'm out of stuff to say for now... LEAVE A COMMENT!! It's the best part of these things. Other than the fact that it kept me busy when I was really bored. Cya... *kiss kiss* :-*"

"event","Well I gave up on the live journal for awhile because I had nothing to say other than some things people didn't really know so I didn't see the point. But once again I'm majorly bored so.. I'll fill you in on some insignificant stuff that's happened since I last wrote.
~*~
Annelise never came over during vacation... So when Troy and I finally hung out, Andy was left alone :( We're hoping she can come over tomorrow but it doesn't look like a good chance because when she said she'd try.. she ended up at her friends' house for the night.. WHATEVER
~*~
To answer EVERYBODY ((excluding the 50 million people who have already asked)) Yes, Troy and I are on a break and have been since Sunday. And to answer you again.. the reason why is complicated so don't bother lol. There's more I'd like to say but.. since I'm not just talking to myself, it wouldn't be very good.
~*~
I'm going to the freshman baseball game tomorrow and they're playing westbrook. Their at 1-4 right now which is NOT good and I've already threatened certain members of the team a horrible death if they lose to despicable westbrook ((no offense..i do love some of you)) And hopefully a couple of my friends from westbrook will come see me! :) And Megan might too!!:-D After, Troy ((and Andy if Annelise comes..)) is gonna come over and ... chill.
~*~
I would just like to say.. erika martin is a loser and so much more ((bad things of course)) =-O! Yeapp, that's right.. we all knew that but, incase erika missed it. And I'd be more than happy to say this to yur face erika but everytime I come around you hide! Tho it seems you have no problem opening yur big mouth whenever I'm NOT there.. I really hope you get guts to actually say something to my face someday.. I'd love to watch what happens :)
~*~
I wanted real bad to see 42nd Street tonite to see my darling Eben and Megan but unfortunately couldn't :( Then I wanted to see my other darlings Lena and Megan but ended up not going there either :'( I miss-ed my salty lil peanut :-/ I'm sorry things have been kinda retarded lately...
~*~
Overall, some things have gone to hell since I last wrote.. But there are some good things too I think? I'm just not sure what they are.. lol. I'm trying to look at the bright side in thinking I haven't completely lost anyone yet which is always good, while gaining a few more friends.. I'm happy with what I have right now even tho there's still something that could make me happier.. but my hopes for that arent up. I'M STILL HAPPY THO! :-D :-D
~*~
Please leave comments! I like reading them :) :)

"event","Well in english today we were reading Romeo and Juliet and I was leaning back in my chair like matt and trust me i felt SUPER cool :). So anyway, Matt pushed the bottom w/his foot so i slowly fell back forward and I pushed my chair back again and tried to do it to him. WELL, it didnt really work but he fell backwards anyway :-D It was pretty funny.. you shouldve seen his face!

Lena's party is on saturdayyyyyyyyy! Whoo! Happy Birthday Lena .. yesterday! lol ily

Yeah, stuff's been going on.. and I'm sorry Lena for denying it but, ya know, it's nothing too big :)I still wish things would go back to how they were at the beginning of the year tho, before everyone starting drifting apart or annoying each other.. *sigh* But apparently wishing wont do anything so I'm just gonna try and start over kinda .. thanks to those of you that are there tho.

Tomorrow I'm gonna give Ally a CD for her to listen to on the way to florida ((ugh.. she only reminds me about florida every FIVE SECONDS! >:o)) and then shes gonna give me some clothes lol. In gym we have to show ppl our awesome dance moves that we were supposed to make up too. Some of mine, alorie, chandra, and sam's are actually pretty cool but others we drew a blank and did something retarded.

I miss my Annelise :'( HOPEFULLY she can come over at some point this vacation so the two lovers ((her and andy)) can finally be reunited. Lol, they are pretty cute together..

Hmm.. I guess that's all I have to say for now so.. leave a commentttttttttt and I'll write soon. Hopefully something interesting will happen! Lata..

"event","So Troy came over around 8 this morning and woke me up :) Then we watch Spaceballs, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and What Women Want.. then at about 4 his mom came and brought us to his house but not before buying a ton of stuff for banana splits...:-D And we hung out there for awhile til my dad came WICKED EARLY to pick me up and we had just finished making our banana splits.. but hey, I got to take it with me :)

Tomorrow's Easter which means another holiday lunch at my grandmother's where my uncle is in a bad mood and causes everyone else to be in a bad mood, my great grandmother doesnt show up, and is just basically kinda dumb.. meh oh well

Yeah last night I went to Ally's and watched fatty's strip.. WHOO! I knew it'd be a blast.. me n* Ally then got all ""Haley and Paula"" on each other but u might not know what we mean unless yur in our spanish class... Now Ally's mad at me cuz I said something to her mom about how she failed those two tests but still got a 94 and uh.. she didnt know about them O:-) ooooopssssss thats what happens when she makes me go w/her mom alone!

Yeah... I""m a bitch a lot and I'm sorry but I still love Troy anyway :)

Today could have been better... But I won't complain. I hope things work out and everything. Today wasn't very eventful either, at least nothing you'd enjoy listening about but then again, nothing in this journal is :) I'm just trying to rid myself of boredom.

Tonite I'm going over Ally's after her game and eating dinner and then watching and taking notes on Real Women Have Curves. We watched it in Spanish and have to do a report.. For those of you who havent seen it yet, It's about this really snobby girl ((thats fat)) who ends up having sex w/a kidd 3 times as small as her and strips with a group of fat women later in the movie.. OMG ITS SO FRIGGIN HORNIFYING! Whoo.. almost had to uhh.. go to the bathroom in spanish class if u know what i mean :-[ no but really, its disgusting...

Eben brought his awesome bear hat today and I wrote ""Go Bears"" On his stomach w/the GO around his nipples.. boy did he like showing off himself.. *cough*

In gym I'm doing this dance thing and we did SUPER HOTT dance moves lol. I felt SO cool :-d .. yeah..

I guess thats all for now, I'm hanging out with Troy tomorrow :).. But okay, that's all I have left to say sooooo *Lata* ((and post a comment))"

"event","Yeah so today was B.O.R.I.N.G like u wouldnt believe.. Absolutely NOTHING good happened today so I don't ever know why I'm writing in this. I was being super-bitch today as well so I apologize to everyone experiencing my wrath :)

One good thing though was that I actually had a conversation with Melissa today. Haven't done that in awhile.. though, its not saying much. I havent really done much w/the friends all year but.. ya know

After about a year of putting off something my dad told me to do.. ((a YEAR, not kidding either)) I finally started doing it. It wasnt hard AT ALL so I have no idea why I never did it but w/e.. Especially since everytime I asked to do something he'd always rub the fact that I hadn't done that in my face and got mad.

It's funny to listen to people in class talking about how much some people suck on the baseball team. Apparently they're cutting 11? Well I've heard enough people to suck that passes that 11 so I'm not sure if the team will be any good.

Seriously, we don't have ANYTHING to drink in this house and I never thought I'd say this but.. I am SICK of noodles! Maybe this is my parents way of putting me on a diet.. by completely eliminating every scrap of food from our kitchen. *sigh*

Troy, AGAIN, didn't come over after school today :-/ But he'll supposedly come over tomorrow.. we'll see! And as happy as I am with him.. I'm starting to get aggrevated with everyone telling me how lucky I am because I have him. I know I'm lucky okay? It just makes me feel bad cuz.. if he's that great.. well, nvm I won't finish that thought.

But basically all this week, uhh.. as well as last week, I've been an all out bitch. Sorry.. And I'll have something more interesting to say in a day or two.. I'm going over Ally's on Friday and then Troy's on Saturday soo :)

Good luck to everyone trying out for baseball! Making cuts tonite.... I'm bored! Yupp, I'll stop rambling now :-D Lata.."

"event","So basically I feel like a major follower because this seems to be ""the thing"" that everyone that's cool has but I'm usually bored around this time so I figured I'd do something with it. I had this stupid account for TWO WEEKS but had trouble figuring it out and had nothing to say.. Luckily Lena helped me out and I noticed that no one else that had a journal had anything to say either..

    Last Friday my friend Annelise came over from Bridgton and we went to the movies with Troy, Andy, Lena, Eben, and Matt! It was fun and the movie was alrite, I totally FREAKED OUT when that dude came out of the bed and strangled Angelina Jolie.. and I wasn't too fond of the sex scene either.. But whatever, we had a fun time I guess and Burger King was interesting.. Eben chased this fat kidd that mooned us while doing his turkey impression and Matt had to wait a REALLY long time receive the food that was sitting right in front of him.. The woman working dropped his chicken tenders too! How lovely fast food joints are.. great workers.

    Then Saturday Troy and Andy came over to chill w/me and Annelise. Did I mention Andy and Annelise hooked up?? :-* OOooOO LaLaH! Heh, so we hung out and then went to this philipino concert thing cuz I was supposed to get tickets at the door but ended up not having to. We still hung out there for awhile and the opening act SUCKED BADLY but I felt bad for him so I still cheered even tho ppl glared at me :) Then Annelise, Heather ((my mom's friend's daughter)) and I went down from the balcony to *bOOgIe dOwN*.. that was a lot of fun. Then we were headed back upstairs and Troy got me and danced w/me! And.. he NEVER dances :-D It was sweet. but my mom just about had a cow when I kissed him on the cheek. Lame huh? I know..

    Sunday Annelise, Troy and I went to Pizza Hut with my dad, uncle and my dad's friend and his little daughter. She's wicked cute! I was anticipating the pizza cuz i was starving and ended up having a soda fight w/Annelise. That was cool.. Then the pizza came and before the lady set it down I grabbed a pizza and dug in :-{ lol, everyone just sat and watched for awhile, amused. Then while my dad hung out w/his friend after pizza.. we were left in the van. We took a walk around westbrook but had nothing to do so we came back.

    Monday well... it sucked I guess. Nothing interesting really happened and I dont like Mondays anyway. The Quest For Respect was.. well, it was better than science!

    Today I watched The Substitute.. Good movie I think. Troy was supposed to come over and I was so mad when his mom ""forgot"" to call the bus garage but he'll come over tomorrow.. Little does he know he'll have to help me do something for my dad O:-) yeah.. He'll deal tho lol, he always does. I gotta let you all know that I love Lena tho! Yeapp, just thought I'd throw that out there

   I guess that's it except I must say, *ANDY AND ANNELISE ARE SOOOOO CUTE TOGETHER!* heheh, yeah.. I'll stop rambling now. Until the next entry...

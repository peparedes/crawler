"event","^^ Kaiko's boifriendo sent her an email aboot going to Japan and when he was coming back. He said that he'd always think of her no matter what. Ain't he kawaii n sweet? ^.^; I want her Li-kun poster though! ARGH! But Kaiko gave me her brother, Hikage Tomoe/Kawanata to keep me happy. :) And I am. Hikage: Momma...save me from this crazy woman called Sukuya...;-; Onegai...
Shaddap, Hi-chan! *ahem* So Kaiko is very cheerful now dispit what happened to her earlier last week. I feel really sorri for her too. She has a boifriendo who she deeply loves and forever will, but then has a exboifriendo whos a jerk and a maniac. ;-; It sorta makes you not wanna fall in love. But no one said falling in love was easy-as Kaiko says. Anywayz I b goin now! Lata!"

"event","I've been sidetrack by love, parents, and story ideas. My brother came backu from Japan. I got a CardCaptorSakura illustration book to chapter 3. A Li-kun poster came along /w it. It's next to my Kamui poster on my wall. I just don't feel right about sort of neglecting Koma-chan and being more flirty than usual /w Li-kun. And Subaru from X/1999 and Tokyo Babylon is now in Kaiko Muyo. I'm being very flirty /w Subaru too. If I knew how to add a picture in here, I would have a picture of Subaru and Seishirou in this entry. Seishirou's hot too, but he's not in Kaiko Muyo yet. Best are for last, even though he might be an assassin, but what's wrong /w dat? Then again...he kills Subaru...T.T He killed his love! And he was crying too! Subaru was like ""...doushite...? ashiteru....seishirou...."" Personal, I think Subaru and Seishirou should b straight. Seishirou should go after Subaru's twin. ^^; She kinda does like Seishirou...hehe, but who wouldn't? XD *sigh* But I still don't feel comfortable /w hardly spending anytime /w Koma-chan...and more time /w Li-kun...Anywayz, I finally made up a theme song for Kaiko Muyo. It's called ""Is this love true?"" and well...that totally fits the anime since thats what I wonder since afterall...I have a lot of bishies! ^^ There was no song that fitted the anime...so why not make one up,ne? I'll write it up one day. I butter go now. Ja mata ne."

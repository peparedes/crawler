I am trying not to but it never gets better just worst. Let's start off with what the main problem is. My SISTER!!!!!!!!!!! I don't know if she realizes this but it is not just her life she is screwing up, her actions affect everyone around her. Over the summer she had a miscarriage and I guess that is what started it all. As you all know I felt really guilty for all of that. Then she gets this life changing DREAM!!!! What the hell am I doing. None of you all give a flying fuck about me. I can't believe how fucking naive I am."

Well, we talked about a lot of things but mostly just swam. We played a lot of water volleyball. (Sandra, me and you make a good team!) I don't know what else to say. My life has been boring lately. I am soooooooo ready for school to start back up. This year is junior ring dance. I am going to go but I just wish I had a date. Well, to be frank I wish I had a boyfriend! (Damn you Sandra) Just Joking. I am really happy for you. Well, I was just writing because i haven't wrote in awhile. I hope Dustin is having fun. I  just hope that those e-mails were sent after he left. Okay well, bye."

She lost the baby. I feel responsible because I knew something didn't feel right. The day that it happened I tried getting a hold of her early in the day because I woke up with this feeling that something was wrong with her or something bad was going to happen to her. I know how crazy this sounds considering ..... well that you aren't me. I get ""feelings"" a lot and they are almost always correct. I knew something was wrong and I didn't tell her or anybody I tried dealing with it on my own and I was right. I just feel so fucking guilty. I had to excited and buy her things and talk to her about the baby and when something didn't feel right I kept it to myself and when people said things I told them to be positive and that everything would be fine. But deep inside I knew it wouldn't and I didn't say shit. Now I'm in a situation where I feel like shit but can't show it because my sister is the one who needs the support. Well, I hope all is well in anyone who reads this life. If not I think I am living through enough bad for all of you. Well, I gotta run."

I thought since my grandma is getting older and she is exhausted that I would watch my nephew so she could have a break. I called my sister to ask and she was stand offish of the idea. Now, I probably should not take offense but I did. Ever since he was a few months old she does no like me watching him. I just found out why. The last time I watched him he fell and got a bump on his head. I guess that is my fault. Chad was seven months old at the time and was just learning to walk. She does not want that happening again. She said she would have to ask Chad's dad and see what he thought. But now that I'm thinking, Chad gets hurt constantly over at my grandma's. Babies get hurt. It is what they do! I don't know it just really got to me. I mean I base my whole life on my niece and nephew and know people are questioning how good I am with kids. That is what I want to do with my life for God sake!

However, what's the harm in asking. Lindsay also wanted for me to ask my mom if she could drive me to school on the first day. Guess what? My mom said no! I am very angry with her. My father was saying no also but I won him over. My sister was in a car with her boyfriend less than two days after he got his liscence and he is nearly six months younger than her. She said that she didn't want me dying in a car with a 16 year old driving. What the fuck is that?

"event","Hey. Well, this is one of the things I have been thinking about lately. GUYS HAVE IT SOOOOOOOOOO EASY!!!!!!!!!!! I am not talking about life in general but in the subject of relationships. Guys are the ones that can tell the person that they like them. They seem so unafraid. I, as a girl, can't do that. I am risking to many things. One they could say no and I would be rejected, two they could start a rumor about me, or three I could come become known as a slut. It is not fair. I really like this guy and I can't do anything about it. He also has a girlfriend (that all the guys think is hot which means I have no shot with him.) which makes me seem like an even bigger slut! That's my problem. I fall for guys that are taken. Example, Seth. He had a girlfriend and was not interested in me at all. I mean can you blame him. But now I don't like Seth like that I like this other guy who is also taken. I don't know it is just really getting to me. I mean Dustin (for example) could have just walked up to Candice and said ""Candice I like you."" (Sorry Dustin just wanted to throw some humor in there. I know you don't like Candice) However I can't walk up and say ""Andy I like you."" He would laugh in my face. Not to mention I would lose a friend. I am just totally lost now. I want to write another entry so I am going to stop this one now."

"event","Okay, this is my first journal. I just want to explain what has been going on with me. Sandra and Dustin I'm sorry. I don't want you to think that I have been mad at you lately. I have been going through a lot lately and pushed a lot of people away. I came out with a lot this year (I think you both know what I'm talking about) but things have changed. I don't want to dwell on that anymore. I didn't like how I was being seen. I told people (parents) that I was better ( I was lying) so I wouldn't have to deal with it anymore. Dustin this is the first part of me you met.  That's not who I am and I didn't know if you would accept the real me. Sanadra we became really close because of this and I didn't want to ruin anything because of this new information. I guess I did anyways. So there, now you know what has been up with me. I am sorry. I just don't want to be the depressed girl anymore. Please don't be mad. 
I love ya,
Brittany
P.S. Dustin happy late birthday!!!"

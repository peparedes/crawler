Also hurt my back walking home from the doctors yesterday, then walked around the new GameStop and WalMart. Bought a 2000 point card for Wii, Scott Pilgrim vs the World XBox Live code for Tyler, an XBox Live (it was supposed to be for PS3 which is why I have to go and exchange it today, if I can) code for Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare for Will, a cute pair of slipper socks and a necklace for Jess, socks for me and Logan, and a few movies. My Warcraft 3 battle chest came in yesterday, so I can't wait to play it. And waiting for whatever Logan bought me for xmas online to come in. Now, I'm gonna load up Warcraft 3, get dressed, and head off to Margaret's drs appt."

"event","<u><strong>Fable</strong></u><strong> <u>and</u> <u>Fable</u>: <u>The</u> <u>Lost</u> </strong><u><strong>Chapters</strong></u><br /><br />The first Fable was awesome. The story line was awesome. And not only did Jack of Blades (final boss) die once, but he died twice in Fable: The Lost Chapters. It was easy to be good, evil, or neutral.&nbsp; The weapon and armor selection was huge. Magic was strong.<br /><br /><u><strong>Fable</strong></u> <u><strong>II</strong></u><br /><br />The story line was okay. They added female Heroes. They took away armor and replaced it with regular clothing. They also removed crossbows and replaced them with guns. Magic was still pretty much the same. The world was pretty cool. Very disappointed in the final boss. He was blabbing away, I took out my gun, shot him, and he died. And that was it.<br /><br /><u><strong>Fable</strong></u> <u><strong>III</strong></u><br /><br />Started off a little rocky. They took away axes, cleavers, and maces. Now, you can only use swords and hammers for melee. Pistols and rifles for ranged. And they added spell gauntlets; meaning you can only use one spell at a time, and you have to keep going back to the sanctuary every time you want to use another spell. There's something called Spell Weaving. That lets you use two spells at a time. They kept some of the areas, like Bowerstone. The clothing they give you is pretty cool. Especially the outfit you get when you become king/queen, the armor set, and the mage set. Walter was the best character in the game. He trains you to become a Hero. He also dies at the end. The final boss, The Crawler, possesses Walter and you have to kill him, obviously. I was kinda disappointed. Although I used 6 or 7 potions, he really wasn't that hard.<br /><br />I still think the first one was the best."

"event","Monster Hunter Portable 3rd<br /><br />I can't wait! I can't wait! I can't wait!<br /><lj-embed id=""68""/><br />I know this one's gonna be harder than the other one's but it looks like so much fuuuun.<br /><br />Anyways, other news. I bought Sims 3 Ambitions and it came in yesterday. I'm still trying to figure out how to become a tattoo artist. One of my Sims is a ghost hunter. Whoo. Going to faire next weekend to watch Owen. Tyler's coming, too. I'll actually have money to spend, as well. I found out that my dad and stepmom took out a life insurance policy on me when I was younger, which neither one of us can pay for anymore, so I surrendered it. Looking forward to my $427 check. ^_^ Still waiting for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm to come out. I'm gonna spend a lot of money when it does. $250, to be exact. Not much else to talk about."

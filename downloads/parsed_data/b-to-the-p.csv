"event","wow, i forgot i had one of these things. anyways, im sitting here in virginia bored to tears because i have nothing to do here. i should start my job this week (target again...oh boy), so maybe i wont be so bored soon. since im bored i decided to update this thing with what everyone else updated their's with....what i learned in college (abridged of course).

1)studying generally helps your grades (shocker, i know)
2)resident evil 4 is probably the most frustrating game in history
3)bus drivers are just as lazy as i am, and they cannot be trusted to get you to your destination near the end of the day
4)go to class, important stuff usually goes on there....unless its chemistry
5)the chemistry department has a direct link to Hell, avoid at all costs
6)nitrate ion has a -1 charge (damn that lab final first semester)
7)papers are impossible to write unless the teacher specifically tells you what to write
8)fire alarms are only allowed to go off unless it is the worst time possible
9)always make sure your door is completely closed unless you want drunk people spending the night
10)snelling pizza is the food of the gods
11)the internet is sure to die when you most need it to work
12)cleaning up is over-rated
13)never take a class on monday or friday if at all possible (4day weekends are amazing)
14)the only way to pass a chemistry test is to beat your head against the practice test for way too many hours
15)if you dont know where all your socks went, odds are they are behind your bed
16)the meal plan at uga is the best thing ever
17)it is not fair for people to use marth in super smash brothers: melee
18)everything funny on the internet comes from something awful
19)elevators in creswell are plain retarded
20)any class with a lab is to be avoided because labs suck"

"event","wow, if orientation is anything to go by, college is gonna be AMAZING. after being there for 2 days i just want school to go ahead and start up again. forget summer...its not as fun. sure the time off is nice, but still i rather be going to college now. i think i share my opinion with like everyone that has gone to orientation. if you havent been yet (and youre going to UGA) then youre in for an awesome time. youll probably end up like the rest of us and wish you could just stay. anyway ill write more later i g2g."

"event","friday i didnt have to go to school because i got my wisdom teeth out. all i have to say about that is anesthesia is freakin weird. haha especially laughing gas. at first i didnt even notice that the gas was working, but then i suddenly felt like insanly relaxed. then the doctor started asking me questions to make sure the gas was working. it was just a bunch of easy questions that he already knew the answers too cause he's a friend of my mom.  stuff like ""where are you going to college in the fall?"" and ""do you have any brothers or sisters?"" hahaha the answers came to my mind immediatly, but i swear it took me forever to say them. my brain was working at 100000 mph but the rest of me was in park apparently. oh man its quite interesting. after that they put in the IV and i was gone in a minute or two. 
 
when i got home my mouth stayed numb bor like 7 hrs so i couldnt really talk, eat, or drink. i tried eating popsicles and stuff but i think i got more on my clothes than in my mouth cause i couldnt even feel the food. after school sarah came by for a while and we watched some horrible movie called Spanglish. i wouldnt recommend that movie to anyone cause it sucked.  when i woke up the next morning i was feeling better so i ended up running errands around town, and going to sarah's house for a while.  i think i did too much though cause i wasnt feeling too hot that night but oh well. 

sunday i spent most of the day with my family cause it was mother's day and all. we went out to eat and i could actually eat normal food without my mouth hurting much.  after dinner sarah and i went to brusters and had a brownie sundae. i swear i could live off those things....id be extremely fat, but id sure as hell be happy.  brusters was rediculously packed that day. everyone and their mom (ha go figure...it was mother's day) was there. 

yesterday was the AP bio exam. it was my first AP exam this year, and i totally raped that test. there is no way in hell i got anything lower than a 4, and i think theres a good chance that i got a 5. afterward dr. nichols treated us all to Johnny Carrino's. its not a cheap place by any means, and there was like 20+ kids there. i dont know how she can afford to do that for us. sheila and i spent a lot of time laughing at the fact that we sleep through class everyday and spout off answers once in a while, and we still have better grades than like all the people that sit there and take pages and pages of notes. i think bio just comes naturally to me or something...thats a good thing cause its my major next year."

"event","this song seems to describe how i feel as were going into the last few weeks of high school.  i think its how a lot of us feel.


I wanna live, I wanna leave, I wanna open up and breathe
I wanna go, I wanna be, I wanna feel it constantly
gotta show, gotta stay, I've gotta feeling that won't go away
I've gotta know, If they got away, my opportunities

just one, chance is all I ever wanted
just one, time I'd like to win the game
from now on, I'll take the chance if I can have it
just one, just one

I need to think, I need to feed
I need to see if I still bleed
I need a place, I need a time
cause I need to step outside that line
gonna give, gonna take
I'm gonna scream till I'm awake
I'm gonna budge, gonna budge
open up the door 

just one, chance is all I ever wanted
just one, time I'd like to win the game
from now on, I'll take the chance if I can have it
just one, just one

and if I knew when the door was open
I'd go through, I would go on through
and I can say, when I do I'll never be the same
never be the same

just one, chance is all I ever wanted
just one, time I'd like to win the game
from now on, I'll take the chance if I can have it

"event","so unlike most of you, i didnt spend my spring break getting drunk at the beach. took sarah to the zoo...that was fun, but the zoo just isnt as interesting as it was when youre like 7. went to six flags and saw a few people i knew there. sarah and i rode just about everything that was open except for the superman one cause there was a freakin 3 hr wait. i hate lines more than just about anything in the world, and ill be damned if i wait 3 hrs to ride something that lasts maybe a minute. on wednesday i went with my family up to virginia to go house hunting. for those of you that dont know, my dad got a promotion at work and he has to relocate to the washington d.c. office in june. ill be staying here to go to UGA, but the rest of my family will be up there. the price of houses is absolutely insane in the d.c. area. we found a house that is about the exact same as the one i live in now only it was on sale for $819,000. its honestly rediculous to cost so much. townhouses are all over $400,000, and regular houses are almost all over $500,000. thats half a million dollars, how does anyone afford that? i really do like the city of washington d.c. though. i hadnt been there since 5th grade, but its still a cool place. everything there seems cleaner, and everywhere you look theres national monuments and stuff. i dunno, theres just something about it that i like. sarahs been gone to the beach for a few days with her friend, haley. i havent been able to talk to her much since wednesday morning, and i miss her a lot. maybe if she gets home early enough tonight ill go visit. prom is this week and i cant wait to go. my tux is the definition of sexy in my opinion lol. i wish i could say more as to what is actually going on friday night, but i still dont know...youd have to ask sarah. ive spent so much money the past week and i still have to pay for prom. not to mention sarahs bday is on the 22nd. im gonna guess that by the time april is over ill have spent over $400. i sure as hell dont wanna go to school tomorrow morning. i much rather just pack up and go to UGA cause i cant wait for that."

"event","so ive spent the entire day working on my stupid government project.  ive done 4 out of the 6 journal entries and my paper is already 8 pages long, and ive already passed the word count. its not as bad as i thought it was gonna be. ill admit that it takes a while and is a lot of work, but im actually finding some of the articles pretty interesting. i just had to change my topic to something that had updates like everyday, and suddenly the paper was like 100 times easier.  i want to finish it tonight, but i dont want to stay up late since i still have one more day to work on it, and im honestly totally sick of typing today. i think i could run a documentary on whats been going on the past 6 weeks in iraq now. good thing i switched hours with a kid from work this week from wednesday to friday cause i really needed that day to work on my project. when i finish this thing tomorrow its gonna be like the biggest relief ever..."

"event","the class is super easy, but i do get bored in here like oh.....EVERYDAY. after i shelf the books for my assigned section of the library, i just sit here and do nothing (sometimes math hw, but today, nothing). hmm so i dont update very often anymore; once every few months i think is what its come down too.  honestly theres just not much to write about. i mean, i could sit here and write about all the time i spend with sarah and how much i love her, but i dont think anyone wants to read that over and over again (except maybe myself and sarah haha). damn im whoring the parentheses today. i guess i just have a bunch of side notes? umm ya so anyways...

for those of you that dont know, i got into uga, and i will be headed out there this fall. mr bill kitson and i are getting a dorm together, so you know how long we'll end up in college lol...maybe a semester, and thats pushing it. i think weve pretty much decided that our room will be open to visitation whenever, so please come on by. we'll only charge a few homework assignments (if we have those, and if not you have to type a portion of the paper that will most likely be due the next morning). i cant wait to get out of this place and move to athens. its gonna be a blast. hopefully this whole room thing goes to plan, or else the beginning of college is gonna suck. uga says they place roommate requests on top priority, so im pretty confident itll go through.

works been going well. im getting sick of going to work, but its money, and i need that stuff like ricky williams needs weed. apparently school is not an appropriate reason for calling out of work. i figured that a company that places so much emphasis on me continuing to do well in school while i work for them would understand that i cant go into work from 4-10 the night before i have a big group project due.  but no, school is not an appropriate reason for calling out, and i must request the time off 2 weeks in advance...too bad that doesnt work when you dont even have 2 weeks to work on the project. when i explained that they said i needed to find someone to work for me, only thing is I TRIED THAT, and since we're understaffed at the moment there was a whopping 3 people that could have possibly worked for me that day. everyone else was either already working or had requested that day off. so ya...as you can see i was quite pissed by that little ordeal.

crap, time for the bell, off to lunch...then directed studies...what a tough few periods"

"event","yet another thanksgiving has come around.  its probably my least favorite holiday of them all.  i dont know why but ive never really enjoyed thanksgiving like i know many other people do.  oh well, my thanksgiving also means that christmas is right around the corner...now thats my favorite holiday.  theres just something about the whole spirit of christmas that i cant get enough of.
     so i could be like everyone else and list the things im thankful for, but i dont feel like doing that.  dont get me wrong, im thankful for lots of stuff.  i just dont feel like listing them all out. instead i think ill just talk about my night last night.  first, i gathered up all the change i could find in my room (sarah threw in a few dollars worth), and we took it up to one of those coin machines at kroger.  we came out with like $55...i was insanely happy with that haha.  after that we went up to the mall and walked around for a bit.  we decided to go to best buy to look at subs for our cars...i want a system in my car SOOO bad.  then we went and ate at wendy's....then it was back to the mall cause i wanted to get a new beanie for the winter.  i ended up getting 2 cause they were on sale for 50% off.  after that, it was finally time for what we had gone out for in the first place ICE SKATING.  some of you may remember what happened to my leg last time i went skating (for those that dont, the skate rubbed the skin off and it was nasty).  well this time i wore long thick socks to prevent that, but it turns out it didnt help.  after about an hour my leg started to hurt, and when i looked at it the skate had started to rub the skin off again (it looked exactly the same as last time...same shape and everything).  i decided i should stop skating cause i didnt want it to get bad like last time when i was like ""oh well i dont care if it hurts.""  i kinda felt bad that i made us stop skating cause i know sarah wanted to skate more, and i did too.  i really like ice skating, but i guess i can only do it for a little while at a time.  after skating we went back to her house and watched a little tv, but not a lot cause i had to go home.  
     so that brings me back to today.  sarah is out of town for a few days...much to her disapproval, and im sitting her starving to death cause all i can smell is food.  i think im gonna go play more halo 2 now since im like totally addicted to that game...also much to sarah's disapproval haha.  hmm all this writing about her makes me miss her already.  so tomorrow i have to be at work at 7am.  definately not looking foward to that.  its gonna be so crazy.  the day after thanksgiving is the day where women let all their fristration out by beating the crap out of the other woman thats trying to get that ""super duper talks to you doll"" that <i>her</i> kid wants for christmas.  most of us men arent dumb enough to subject ourselves to the wrath of the woman who thinks tomorrow is the only day that she can buy that toy for her kid...we know much better than that.  christmas eve shopping is where its at haha.  actually i plan on getting all my shopping out of the way early this year, but we'll see how that goes.  i hope the food is done soon..."

"event","man im sick of work. it wouldnt be too bad if i actually had a weekend.  im off all week, but then i work like 6 hrs fridays then 8 hrs saturdays and another 8 hrs sundays.  id gladly work a day or two during the week if it meant cutting down on 8 hr days.  its too hard to get my weekend homework done the way it is now not to mention i dont really have time to see sarah...or anyone else for that matter. 

it was a long day yesterday.  i thought i was supposed to be at work at 10:30, but while i was eating breakfast target called and said that i was supposed to have been there at 9:30, so i was like 40 min late to work.  its a good thing andre decided to cover my last two hrs for me, cause if i would have gotten off at 6:00 like i was originally scheduled to it would have been hard to get ready for sarah's pageant.  i had a good time at the pageant yesterday.  sarah's parents saved my family seats in the first row, so we had a good view of everything.  sarah looked so amazingly <b>beautiful</b> last night.  im so proud that she actually went through with the pageant until the end.  i know she was getting tired of all the stuff that it required, and even stressed over it, but i knew she would be glad in the end...turns out shes very glad she did it.  sarah didnt win anything, but i couldnt be more happy for her.  getting to see her do what shes worked hard for the past few months was enough. shes such an <b>amazing</b> person, and (this is for you becky haha)i <b>LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE</b> her more than anything.  after the pageant was over i went back to sarah's house and watched the movies her dad took.  she kept laughing at herself and saying how bad it was, but none of it was that bad (at least not bad enough for me to make fun of haha). i left around midnight and came home where i immediately fell asleep.  i was so tired after work and the 3 hr long pageant.  well well well, bet you cant guess what i have to go do now....yes, i have to go to work again...argh i hate this."

"event","so i woke up this morning and i felt awful. i felt like i was going to puke and i had chills like crazy. i tried to get up and take a shower, but standing up only made me feel worse. i called sarah to tell her i wasnt going to school, but her dad answered and said hed relay my message. i hope he did, cause when i finally woke up and came downstairs this morning i saw that she had called my cell phone. i kinda feel bad that i wasnt able to take her to school today...i love that part of my day. anyways, i feel perfectly fine now. maybe i was just extremely tired or something? i dunno, but im seriously thinking about getting dressed and going to school for the second half of the day. 

yesterday was my and sarah's anniversary. 4 whole months now. i know that doesnt sound like a lot, cause its not really a whole lot to begin with. it sure seems like more than 4 months though. i feel like ive been with her my whole life, and i know she feels the same about me. we went out to eat yesterday for the first time...well not the first time actually, but it was the first time we'd gone out to eat by ourselves, we'd only been out with other people. we went to chili's and just ate a bunch of appitizers 1) cause we werent that hungry and 2) cause we were kinda in a rush to get sarah home so she could make pagent practice. kit house was our waiter. haha that was interesting, ive never been served by a friend before and it was fun being able to cut up with him.

hmm theres so much i could write about here. i havent updated in sooo long. but everything i can come up with to talk about revolves around how much i love sarah. soooooooooooo i dont want to bore you with that stuff, and ill just sum it all up with: i <b>LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE</b> her more than anything in the whole world, and right now im missing her like crazy while shes at school and im not. 

i think im gonna go eat some breakfast now, and maybe ill go up to school. if i dont i might add more to this, or maybe play halo 2...i cant decide. later."

"event","lets see, whats been goin down recently? haha well to sum it all up in one word, sarah. that may sound sad to some of you, but i wouldnt have it any other way. shes the absolute greatest person in the world. i felt bad today; it was jeff and emily's 6 month (sorta) anniversary. jeff did all these really nice things for emily to show her how much he loves her. it made me wish i did stuff like that for sarah. shed probably say something like ""oh dont worry, theyve been dating for 6 months."" so what if sarah and i have only been together for 2 months, i still wish id have done more nice stuff like jeff did. she knows how much i love her, i dont let her forget, but somehow i wish i could show it more. i think ill start doing more ""cute"" stuff for her. i dont care how whipped ill look for doing it. she deserves every bit of it. i dont know what id do without her.......i LOVE her; yes, thats right all you people that i know are gonna say ""you dont know what love is""....i DO love her. i wish i could describe all my feelings for her to everyone. when i think about it in my mind it sounds easy to do, but wheni try to do it i have way too many things to say at once. it would all just sound like babble. i know youre gonna read this as soon as i put it up, so i just want to say...........sarah, i really do love you more today than yesterday, but less than tomorrow. thats the best way i can describe it...i love you sooo much.

theres more stuff i want to write about, like what ive been doing for the past few weeks, but ill write that stuff later. i just had to get this stuff out first."

so school starts in like 3 days. wow summer went by fast. ill have to do a recap of my summer later on. i went to the registration thing at school yesterday and i got to see a lot of people i hadnt seen since school got out. it was pretty cool. i waited around for sarah to finish selling yearbooks. lol some lady couldnt spell her own name, and she kept yelling at poor sarah to fix it. hahahaha the lady kept adding and taking out letters. i was trying so hard not to laugh. actually im kinda anxious to get back to school now that ive seen a bunch of my friends. i guess ive kinda accepted the fact that summer might as well be over (since ill be gone all day tomorrow, and sunday i cant be out late). but ya, ive gotta get back to being ""sick"" now. later."

"event","something happened tonight. i did something that made me feel so horrible i wanted to puke. i was so afriad of losing something that i was shaking. so i grabbed my keys, told my mom i had to leave, and i left. i drove, it seemed like ages but according to the clock it was about 5 minutes. when i got to where i needed to be i believe the clock said 11:03. i took a deep breath and rang the doorbell. i asked to speak with the person i had upset, and that persons mother went to get them. they didnt want to talk to me, and i knew they wouldnt want to, but i also knew that i need to talk to them and i would have done anything to make them listen. so i basically poured my soul out. i said exactly what i felt. ive never spoken like that to anyone before. ive never meant anything so much before. i dont even know how i got up enough curage to say what i did. but to make a long story short everything worked out ok. 

sometimes i think we all wish we could just rewind time, and undo certain things. but if we could do that, would it really be worth it? maybe some things would be ok to change, but the things we wish to change the most, i dont think should be changed. when what happened tonight happened, the first thing i thought was ""omg why cant i just go back and not do what i did?"" but now i wouldnt have changed anything. ill probably remember tonight forever. something inside me changed today. im happy again, and theres nothing that can change that. and finally to the person ive been talking about, i cannot thank you enough. i could say thanks a million times and it wouldnt be enough. thank you so much."

"event","ok im in the middle of nowhere tenessee for my brothers baseball tournament. its the worst thing ever. ive only been here a few days but i cant stand it. theres no one here my age. theyre either adults or 11 year olds. lol i havent been this bored in a long time. my bros team is 3-0 so far, and i cant decide if i want him to win or to lose. 

i havent done much since ive been here. the pool is always too crowded to go swimming. the mall is so small that i can walk from one end to the other in about 7 minutes. haha theres no way i could ever live in a place like this. sheesh and i thought lville was boring. oh and:

sarah,
hey i know youre getting home before me, but i cant remember when that is haha. im assuming youll be home on friday (tomorrow). my dads cell is being gay so thats the only reason i havent called. ill try and call asap, i guess itll be youre cell since you should be back home. im assuming youll read this when you get back. sorry again, but ive been trying. miss you liz.

well im gonna go now. ill write when i get home. later."

"event","for the past week or 2 it seems like nothing can take me off this crazy summer high. its weird cause usually after a good week i suddenly wake up one morning in a bad mood. not this time though. im not even mad that i have to go to my brother's baseball tournament in tennessee on tuesday. i was originally gonna stay home cause i had to work, but since i really dont have a job anymore i have to go. i figured id be pissed about that, but the fact is...im not. sarah leaves tuesday as well only she gets to go to the beach instead of the middle of nowhere. hmmm maybe i can fit in her bags, im sure she wouldnt mind if i tagged along lol. speaking of her, i went over to her house last night and we watched The Butterfly Effect. that was one of the weirdest movies ive ever seen. i understood what was going on the whole time, but what was happening was a lot for my mind to grasp. it really made me think of how changing one simple event could totally change your entire life. but then again that is the butterfly effect.
 
  ""The flapping of a single butterfly's wing today produces a tiny change in the    state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done. So, in a month's time, a tornado that would have devastated the Indonesian coast doesn't happen. Or maybe one that wasn't going to happen, does.""

thats some crazy stuff to think about, and i think ill save it for later....much. anyways i had a great time last night. i decided im gonna have to teach sarah how to play poker, and maybe ill teach her to play 13 too. maybe if she gets to come over tonight we can begin her lessons. haha that sould be interesting. just thinking about it makes me smile. 

hmmm lets see what else is there. oh, my car passed emissions this time, but after $800 i was expecting no less. i get my tag for it tomorrow. haha its about time i get that. i need a job bad. i really should start looking again, but for some reason i dont want to go out and apply to places again. i guess i did that so much before that im still sick of it. stupid buffalos....why cant they just call me back to work, i was just starting to like it over there too. 

well thats it for now i think. maybe ill update tonight about the cards lol. dueces."

"event","<P>youve got to be kidding me. ive had my car for 3 days and its already in the shop. we took it for an emissions test today, and it failed. apparently several sensors are broken or not working properly or something. so ya, another few hundred dollars and i can drive my car. down in la grange (where we bought the car) they dont have to have emissions testing so i guess people there dont care if all the sensors work correctly. damn, now im carless for a few days. not to mention i cant get my license plate for a while longer. im mad at the guy that sold us the car. hes a damn mechanic and he swore there was nothing wrong with the car. YA WELL FUCK YOU, YOU WERE WRONG DOUCHE BAG!.&nbsp; anyways, yes, i am totally pissed. good thing my parents are being nice and helping me pay to get it fixed. otherwise id be screwed. im expecting to have about $500 worth of sensors to replace. one of them runs about $160, and theres 3 in the car so depending on how many are bad i could have to pay as much as $480 just for those. then the guy said one of the other sensors thats bad is expensive but hes not sure quite how much it is. then theres anything else that was wrong.......damn, ya id say at least $500. well, i have to go finish mowing the yard now. later.</P>"

"event","man o man, im running on 4.5 hrs of sleep today. i didnt fall asleep until 4 last night, and this morning i had to wake up at 8:30 because people were coming to look at the house. the reason i went to bed so late is that i got to go to the midnight premier of spider-man 2. i really liked the movie. my only complaint is that there was too much screaming. sometimes i felt like i was watching a horror movie. other than that, i think it was even better than the first spider-man movie. theres also this really good ""speech"" that aunt may gives peter parker about there being a hero in everyone...if i can find it online ill post it. anyway, id definately recommend spider-man 2 to everyone. id even go see it again.

in other news, i was once again supposed to get a car on monday. youll never guess what happened to that...yes, thats right, it didnt happen. we were gonna get the car last saturday, but the bank was closed for the weekend, and we needed to talk to someone there. so we agreed with the guy selling the car that wed just wait until monday, and he said he wouldnt sell it until then. anyway, i went home thinking that it was all wrapped up...boy was i wrong. monday morning my dad called the seller and was gonna finalize the time where wed go give him the check and stuff, but the guy said to give him a little while. a few hours later, he calls my dad and says that a guy bought the car, paid the original price (my dad had talked the price down a few hundred dollars) in cash. needless to say, im still carless. im sick of this crap...next time i find a car i really like, we are getting it on the spot, i dont care what my dad says. while im ranting, i might as well include work. last saturday, worked a grand total of 36 minutes before i get sent home because there wasnt enough business. yes, 36 minutes....at my salary that comes out to $3.09....wow a whole $3. WTF IS THAT BS? i really hope the job i applied for at networks comes through. i mean id basically be getting paid to play video games. how cool would that be? right now its looking good over there. the guy who works there really likes us (us being me and my neighbors who also applied there). weve been there a few times and played games just to make ourselves look more interested. they say i should hear really soon, so im crossing my fingers.

well this is getting longer than i expected, so i figure ill stop now. i need to see if i can find any cars online or in the paper now anyway (i shouldnt even have to be doing that still...). later."

"event","<P>its been a few days since ive written so i thought id update. theres really not much to say here. i got my SAT scores back last night. i only improved by 20 points. bah, im kinda mad i didnt study now. im still no where close to my goal. i seem to be missing 10 hrs of pay from work, but according to my paychecks they paid me for those hours in a seperate check. i think im gonna wait a few days to see if i get the missing check in the mail. if i dont im gonna have to go a talk to the manager and get my money. i was supposed to get a car on wednesday. my dad was out of town until wednesday, but he told me wed go get the car when he came back. the second he got back i asked if we could go get the car, and he says hes too tired cause the flight from cali is long. so the next day, yesterday, he was at my bros game and he tells me to go see if the car is still there, and if it was he was gonna drive to the dealership. so i get to the dealership, and i dont see the car. i asked one of the salesmen, and he said a guy drove in from north carolina the night before and bought it. i was sooooo pissed. so now its like starting over in terms of getting a car. now we have to go looking all over again. this totally sucks. i have to work tonight. i really dont feel like going at all. i mean, the job isnt too bad or anything, but i just hate it. my neighbor is getting a job at a LAN center thats opening in discover mills. theyre having an open house wednesday so, my neighbor is gonna take me up there, and put in a really good word for me while i fill out an application. that would be the coolest job ever. id get to play computer games, and get paid for it. my cousin works at a place like that on his college campus. he says its like the best job in history. i think ill leave yall with a pic of lindsay lohan from a mean girls poster.....notice the dildo in the lower right corner. i had never noticed it before.</P>

"event","i swear the more sleep i get, the more tired i am when i wake up. i was only up until like 12:30 last night, but i still slept until like 11. its more sleep than ive gotten in a while, and this morning i feel dead tired. oh well, work was crazy last night. first off, some guy walked out on a $50 tab at the bar, so the bartenders were going insane. then some guy that was at the bar (who had been there since like 6, this was at like 9:30) apparently thought that the bartenders were telling him that he needing to pick up the tab that the other guy had walked out on. who knows how he got that idea. anyway, he was yelling at the bartenders and the manager for like 10 min. at one point he looked like he was going to start a fight, so one of the waiters and i had to go hold him back. eventually he just threw his money across the bar and stormed out. speaking of storming, it was like a freaking monsoon there last night. the power kept going out, so all the computers were down. this made all the waiters have to calculate all the checks themselves. i decided to help, since i believe im like twice as smart as anyone there.....yes, its that bad over there lol. after a few checks we discovered that the office was flooded. we were cleaning that up when a broom broke and the waiter that was using it cut his finger on it. well part of his finger was just hanging there, and all he said was ""oh shit."" i think the poor guy was in shock because he was sweating, feeling sick, and turning blue. but ya, so we bandaged him up and sent him to the hospital. other than that, it was a normal day at work. filled with rapping, talking trash, and learning spanish from the cooks. haha i love the cooks. they are the nicest people. they dont like the fact that my last name is spanish and i cant speak the language, so they are always trying to teach me. 

wow i just wrote like a freaking book about work last night. i guess theres not much else going on. the ghp kids left this morning. ill miss them while theyre gone.....two in particular. ive been thinking about starting my summer work. i tried opening my ap bio book the other day. ya....that didnt work. i just looked at the first page of the chapter and closed the book. i really do have quite a bit of work this summer, so i think i really need to get started. im getting anxious to see my SAT scores. i can get them on the 28th. i better have gotten at least a 1400. 

everything is going well over here. ill be getting a car in the next week or so. thank god, now ill be able to go out during the day. it looks like ive written quite a bit. i think ill go ahead and stop writing now. hope everyone's summer is going well."

<P>this morning was the SAT. overall, i dont think it was that bad this time. of course there were a few words i had never seen before, but i was expecting that much. once again i had 4 LA sections and 3 math sections...i was hoping for the other way around this time. i dont know if thinking the test was pretty easy is good or bad. last time i thought i did horrible, and i ended up getting a 1300; which is not bad at all, but its not my best by a long shot. i didnt study again eventhough i said i would. i still plan on taking the test again, so ill study then right? im hoping i raised my score into the 1400's. my goal is to hit 1500 by the last time i take the test....i think if i studied i could do it. anyway, people are looking at the house now so i have to get going. </P>
<P>for those of you that took the test today, how do you think you did?</P>"

"event","last night something horrible happened. i think i lost a friend. no, they didnt die, but right now it looks like the friendship is over. things had been slowly getting worse between us for a while now. last night i find out that they cant even talk to me anymore, and that they are happier with out me in their life. as much as this persons means to me, i dont see why i should go out of my way to try and be friends with someone that isnt going to try back. maybe this isnt the right thing to do. part of me is saying i should walk away, and another part says to stay. i dont know. something like this has never happened to me before, and i have to say its one of the worst feelings ever. if anyone has any ideas, please let me know.

to the person i was referring to:
i dont know if youll ever read this, but maybe you will. i know youre happy with the way things are right now, and im glad you are. but i dont think you quite understand how important your friendship is to me. you and i, weve been through so much together. maybe thats the problem. if it is, then im sorry. im sorry for everything that ever happened; it was just leading to something like this. im hoping this isnt what it seems like. i hope we can continue being friends. but a friendship isnt a one sided deal. it takes 2 people for it to work. i am beyond willing to try, i just need you to be willing. please, give me this chance. please."

"event","today is memorial day. im 17 now and this is the first time ive ever considered a holiday like today. i was just watching tv and there was a show on that had letters from soldiers being read. i realize now what these people do. they lay down their lives in order to protect us here. i dont know why, but i think i see the bigger picture now. i was listening to the letters, and i swear i wanted to cry. here i am, thinking about what i can do to have fun 2 weeks from now. and as im doing that our soldiers are thinking about what they can do to stay alive 2 breaths from now. i cant even imagine living like that. knowing that every breath you take, every time you blink you may never do that again. my god that would be awful. in 6 months ill be 18. a man by our standards. is an 18 year old boy really a man? personally, i dont think ill be one in 6 months. and yet so many people that age go of to war, and many never come home. general patton once said, ""now i want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. he won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country."" unfortunatly, when both sides have this idea, people on both sides die. 18 years of age. not even old enough to go get a drink with friends, yet old enough to die in combat. will i be ready for that? only time will tell. 

here in america, i believe we are all brothers and sisters. and so on this memorial day, 31 may 2004, i would like to give all of my fallen brothers and sisters thanks. ive never met any of you, and none of you have ever met me. i want every one of you to know, i am truely grateful for what you have done. you made the ultimate sacrifice so that people like me can be happy. i hope that one day, i will be able to amount to what you have. everyone needs a hero. as of today i have countless heros, all of whom have shown the greatest of bravery. thank you all so very much. if by chance we meet in some other time, in a greater place, know that i will be proud to stand next to you. may you all rest in peace."

"event","so school is finally out and summer is in. oh man i feels so good to sleep in. i finally got a job today at buffalos. i walked in, filled out an application and they hired me on the spot. haha they must be desperate. i start tonight too, which i think is gay. but i guess the sooner i start, the sooner i have money so spend. i really need it bad too. i need new clothes, a car, and just some spending $ (and i gotta save up for college too). i found out i had the wrong answers on becky's boob guessing game. apparently i mixed up karena and becky....i did get the rest right though. by the way, becky, when you read this remind me to tell you what my friend said about your little game (and i agreed)....i think youll like it lol. havent really done anything since schools been out. actually ive been grounded until i got a job, so now im free. that means give me a ring and let me know whats up. i need to get out of the house. man i cant wait until my family goes out of town and i get the house to myself. im thinking im having everyone over like all the time. man oh man it should be some fun. anyway, gotta go get ready for work. ill try to write about the first day later tonight.

Update: its official, work sucks like no other. if i didnt need the money so bad theres no way id be doing this......"

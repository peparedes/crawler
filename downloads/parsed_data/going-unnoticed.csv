let me start you out with the background of my microwave.  its at least 15 years old, and HUGE.  it takes double the time of a regular microwave to cook food all the way through.  so i was in the process of making a bowl of delicious sphagetti o's, and i took it out of the microwave.  the problem is the bowl is extreemly hot.  so i use a hot pad and i picked it up, and for some reason there was a hole in the pot holder.  so i burnt my hand really bad, and that made me tip over the searing hot bowl of sphagetti o's. some of this lava got on my nipple... it got everywhere else in the kitchen.

it burns like fire... and im more sad because i spilt half of my LAST can of sphagetti o's."

"event","as much as id love to just add to the monstrosity below instead of moving on and making new journals, i wont.

not so often do i hate somthing, ok, well one thing that i hate is the movies.  everything about them sucks.  

starting with the price of movies, they keep on rising and rising.  its partially because we pay the actors 90843asdf984 million for a single role, and partially because i have no idea why but it should be stopped.

second, i HATE when young families bring their young children to any movie pg-13 and up.  its not daycare or a babysitter, its unfair to everyone trying to enjoy the already high priced movie.  i was sitting in spiderman 2 yesterday, and next to us was this 1 or two year old baby, who half the time cried and talked, and the other half walked around.  thats just rude to everyone else, and those people should be kicked out, or not allowed in for that matter.

third, pop corn.  of all the possible things they could have sold in a movie theatre, they had to sell a big tub of noisy, cracking (hence the name POP) corn.  when every person in the theatre is rustling through their bag to get the last few kernels, it takes away from the movie, which i paid nearly 10 dollars to see.  


ill add more if i remember anything of importance."

Which brings me to my point... im not saying hes not a really great film maker or not inteligent, but ive heard people (not picking on you brian) that say that his movies are great sources of information.  I cant really agree there because michael moore is an extreemly biased and one sided liberal.  His movies represent only one side of any issue, and to the uninformed masses, it can be viewed as fact, which would be wrong.  They should be viewed as entertainment and only entertainment, nothing more.  For it to be called a documentary is wrong and missleading.

i set up a myspace, been busy with that, ive nearly neglected my lj, but your used to it already.


graduation has come and gone, and im sorta depressed about the whole thing.  sure, yay, whole new live next year at santa cruz, but im really gonna miss the people in burbank.  it feels like now more than ever im just recently getting to know alot of people better.

on a lighter note, i bought a few cds this week (for those of you who know me, thats an amazing feat)  i got the best of reggie n the full effect, and another year on the streets vol. 3 (vagrant yearly cd), and some random bob marley (definatly will be coming in handy next year at santa cruz).

went up to orientation at santa cruz, registered in my classes, im official, cant believe it.  dorms look awsome, brand new, co-ed floors and bathrooms, im not sure if thats a good thing or bad thing, but i had no choice.  it will definatly be cleaner than an all guys bathroom.

So it was amazing, but so amazingly hot.  So many good bands.

I only got to see: pretty girls make graves, !!!, thursday, cursive, atmosphere, Belle & sebastian, Bright Eyes, flaming lips, and... oh yeah... THE CURE.

I cant believe i saw the Cure, once in a lifetime oppritunity.  They were unbelieveable btw.



I dont update this thing any more, but I had to after this weekend."

So i just got back from mammoth, it was such an awsome weekend.  I snowboarded saturday and sunday, im sooo sore.  The only good thing about going to school tomorow is knowing its only a 4 day week, meaning it will soon be the weekend.

its gonna be freakin awsome, snowboarding and whatnot.  I can test out my ipod while riding. 

I woke up at 9 o clock today, that was kinda bad, forged a note saying i had car problems.  Oh well... I only missed half of one class, i LOVE not having a first period, going in at nine is the best thing ever.

I really really need to get pictures on this thing."

I guess it was too ""hyped up"" and i had high expectations.

For some reason, right now seems like a calm before a storm.  Nothings going on, nothings new or exciting, and soon enough somthing big will come.  Not sure if its gonna be good or bad, we'll have to wait n see.

A movie i saw for the first time that was great was ""I am Sam.""  Thats a damn sad movie."

No one can say her name

Now she sits and sings something about my dreams
Hours go by before she looks at me
She breaks my heart
As I open my eyes to drink the melon sky



Ive got all these feelings inside me, but they can never be said.  If i were to like this person, there would be no way for her to like me back, i know this is for sure.  I guess theres nothing i can do.  Shes not even my type really, but i cant help my feelings.

In other news, all that ""studying"" paid off... 4.0 baby.  Although i didnt study at all, i rocked the anatomy final.  I bombed the english final, but it didnt matter, i had so high of an A.

When I told you that this was goodbye
You were begging me not tonight
Not here, not now
We're looking up at the same night sky
And keep pretending the sun will not rise 
Be together for one more night
Somewhere, somehow


Im ready for somthing new in my life... i have no idea what though, everythings so boring and the same.  

Finals are almost over, i barely studied... i only had 2 real finals, the rest were either auto, weight training, or a class where i had a high A or B.  Senior year is very chill... a little too chill, i sorta miss the fear of big projects and essays and whatnot.  Well next semester will be more chill, im dropping auto and weight training... going in at nine, and am a Lab Assistant for Childress.

Damn, i need to get a picture of me on this thing... even my Livejournals boring."

ross nick and i planned to go to a few parties tonight, but they were either too far away, or the people we were following decided to get lost.  So we cruised around burbank, did absolutly nothing, and wasted about a quarter of a tank of gas.  yay

I just got ""In Reverie"", the semi-new Saves the Day cd... its alright, the first song is the best, then the rest are alright.  I prefer the albumn ""Stay What You Are"" and ""Through Being Cool""

I just changed my schedule for next semester, i may be able to go in at 9, which would be pretty wild.  Maybe ill have to fill it with a TA first period."

This is based on how much I like doing various tasks and my education level.  Very interesting!  There were not any questions in relationship to addictions or anything so I was quite surprised at the results.  It just serves to validate my indebtedness to the student loan corporation.

"event","Hey guys--I'm participating in the aids walk this may, and part of my
duty is to raise some funds. While, I don't particularly know how to
ask people for money, it is for a good cause. You may donate as little
or as much as you wish--or nothing at all. The scariest thing to me is
that this is the 20th annual walk which means this epidemic has been
killing people for a long time. One of my favorite organizations in
NYC is sponsering this event which makes it even cooler. GMHC is
GREAT!! Anyway--it's worth a shot... 

You can donate (if you wish) by clicking the following text:

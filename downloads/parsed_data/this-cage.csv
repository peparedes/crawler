"event","I took my new car out for a drive yesterday. My parents went with me in the car, my dad only had to grab the steering wheel off of me once during the whole hour. Impressive, at least I didn't make my mum cry. I got kind of frustrated because my dad kept repeating things over and over and I kept wanting to yell ""yes I know that already. I have been driving for a few months now""! 
I went into a massive puddle and it went all over my car and I couldn't see or figure out how to turn my windscreen wipers on, my dad was almost jumping out of his seat, bless.
After that little charade I went horse riding and I didn't fall off that damn bucking miserable excuse of a horse although one girl lost control of her horse and ploughed almost into me at a canter and I just kept thinking how I was going to be stuck on a rodeo horse and praying he wouldn't go ballistic.
Anyway I met up with my boyfriend yay and we just walked around and talked. He ate my last bite of my ice cream after we went around terrorising the local supermarket and I found a childrens trolley with a flag which I commandeered.
We spent 6 hours together then 2 hours talking online and then 2 hours on the phone, at 12 at night I was like I'm sorry but Cinderella has to go."

To keep the red ribbons in
But once uncoiled it's undone
And the bandages wear thin
And it's happening just like before
And once again I'm
Bleeding ribbons on the floor

"event","Had today off from work because I have to work the weekend, anyway I got a txt from one of my friends asking me to please meet him up. So I went, made all the effort to go (pratically had to run to catch a bus because no one could take me in to town) and when I get there it's freezing cold, we didn't do anything but mill around and one of my friends was in a mood. I sat next to her and was like ""do you want to talk?"" and she said no so I left her to fume and then when some other friends appeared she started complaining about how bad her life was. I got angry because I'm her best friend and everyone was like ""its okay"" and ""dont say things like that"". It just made me really angry, I sound like such a bitch. Anyway I pratically felt like the third wheel seeing as everyone branched off into their own groups and I was left to tag along. :(
I know I probably sound very whiney but I just got so wound up about it, I don't understand why I get so affected by her actions, maybe it's because I'm really needy or something. I never used to be, have to work on that. Nothing like changing my personality. 
I was hoping I would spend some alone time with this guy I kinda like, he's told me he likes me to but I told him I needed to get know him better first. Why did I do that? Probably because I've never had a boyfriend before. Yeah well anyway he had to go and I just couldn't bring myself to say anything, I'm such a coward. If I didn't work ridiculous hours I would asked him out on a date but I'm doing a night shift and late shift this week so it's pratically impossible.
Blah, is all I can say right now. I'm being a whiney teenager in my own right."

"event","I feel shattered this morning, I went to two parties in a row last night and I feel lifeless. Firstly I went to a bar for a leaving party to watch the England vrs Scotland match which we lost spectacularly to, I actaully have never really watched a rugby match but there I was, howling at the large screen tv indignantly every time a player dropped the ball. I sounded like my dad.
I had to leave early to go to a house party where upon by the time I arrived (quite late) alot of people were slightly to merry to be sober. We played a very unsucessful game of twister, ran riot around the garden and danced for hours on end.
I spent the entire evening being harrassed by my friend who had the exact same conversation with me over and over about how talaneted I was but aparently I wasn't the only one who had the same conversation ie. everyone, although the topic varied slightly with different people such as you're so beautiful, you're so talaneted and oddly enough the Europian Union was discussed also. Eventually she passed out so it was ok.
After spending two hours of schemeing evilly about taking over small islands with two of my evillist friends I tried to find a place to sleep, suprisingly after knocking over and jug and cup full of water onto the floor I decided that was the best place to sleep and woke up in the morning slightly wet.
I feel quite sick as for breakfast I ate croissants and snowballs (the sweet variety just in case anyone had any doubts) and anything edible I could find that hadn't already been half eaten.
Going bowling later so I'm going to have to make myself look more presentable since I debated for a while whether to go home in my pyjamas but for everyones sake I thought it would be best if I changed."

Bit of a short kinda pointless entry really but my journal looks so blank. I feel empty just looking at it. Oh well, hopefully something interesting will happen later on, maybe."

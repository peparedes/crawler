let me just say, i am in love with a junior culinary boy. ooooh man he's so hott, i feel like amanda haha... or eden. anyway tho, i'm so trying to holler at that fo real. elana is supposed to say something to him for me. haha i'm so shy man. i really hope me and liss have a party tho with our decorations cuz he's all about coming! woo hooo. 

prom is fast approaching... gangsterness. i can't wait. i got my dress saturday morning. i love it! i'm going to have to find maddd extra tickets though, cuz let's see... well me and brandon (i get 2 free tickets), then tiff, ame, eden?, heather, lauren, shoba?, and i can't remember who else, but yeah. i just wish we were getting a limo, but the damn culinary girls didn't get the shit together early enough and i'm sure it's too late to get one now :( i really wanted one tho. eh well.

AND DARC AND BRITTANY AND KEESH ARE TRYING OUT!#$%$ i dunno if anyone else from the team is. that'll be soo fun if we all make it!#$% 

heather was telling me about this house in hawthorne on the water, single home, 3 bedrooms and i think 2 bathrooms, laurens gmom owns it and rents it out, and she'd rent it out to us. that'd be fucking awesome. we'd have so much fun. but she started telling me about it when i came into work crying really bad sunday morning, and i had told her i can't live with my dad anymore. she's all about it, me, her and lauren moving together. cuz they want a house-house anyway. and i honestly can't take living here anymore. it's time to move out.

so i got a new cell phone, with  A PLAN! yesterday tiff took me to her cell phone place and got me one on her name. it's gangster as shit yo. it's a camera phone, i love it! but i had to get a new number, which was sad cuz i'll miss my old number :/  but so yeah, if anyone wants the new digits, jus ask.


i got maddd laundry to do tonight. i already did like 2 loads, got like 3 more to do :(

i work everyday this week but saturday, and the only reason i'm of sat. is cuz i asked brad if i could be so i can go try out for the team. woo hoooo. i'm all about working mad hours again. like today, tomorrow and thursday and next monday i'm only scheduled to work 12-2, but i stayed til like 5 today, and i'ma prolly stay til at least 4 or 5 all the other days too. so i should have maddd hours by the end of the week. i need money, so i'm going to work as often as possible fo shizzy.

JQ and Marky-mark are having a party thing friday night, score to that. it's only going to be me, them, brandon, lauren and heather prolly though. it'll be fun though. then saturday night is heather and laurens party. woo hoooo. score to your mother again.

i hope we all go to woodlawn tomorrow after practice to watch the county championship (woodlawn against overlea)... i really hope Overlea wins, i doubt they will though. 

all i know is we gotta work our asses off to beat poly monday night. coach is supposedly giving us off of practice sat. but i told him we should definatly practice sat. too, but he wants to give us off oneday, so krystal said give us off friday and we practice sat. so i hope we do taht, cuz we can't go into a hard ass game monday night having two days off of practice. eff that. we're not letting that be our last game in highschool. hellllllll naw nig. haha.

then i came home, and slept from 4 pm-5 am this morning. haha. cuz i had only got like 2 hours of sleep the night before. sat. night, me and krystal went to ambers party. jen was there, jess, nicole, heather, and some other people. ya gotta love hut parties. heather is having one this weekend. then we went to dennys at like 2 which was packed so we went to another place and ate there. slaur was there!@$% good times. they were packed as shit as well though, but we got sat and got our food very fast.

i worked sat. night 5-close as well. 

i'm definately going backwards with my weekend. haha.

friday, me shannon and lauren hung out. we went to fells point and got some bla-zed pizza and pepsi. then we went to the mall for a lil while, and i can't remember if we did anything else. we got free starbucks from adam. saw amanda and jamie there. hottness.

i'm effing in love with this cherry grean tea!#$ shit is so bla-zed. Mmmmmmmmmmmm. i think i'm gonna make banana pudding later and put bananas on it. that'll be good. i hope we have whipped cream too.

food is so good. i ate 21052835 pieces of pizza at work earlier today. then the cab came mad early to pick me up so i was back at school at 1:55. so i just shot around for 35 minutes before practice.

coach told us that that gift was teh best gift ever, and we spent way too much money on him! awww i love him man. he was like ""just teh card would have been fine, that was my favorite thing."" awwwwwww. he loved what we all wrote to him n stuff.

the game sunday is going to be so fun, i can't wait. i think i'm gonna sell my extra ticket to keesh's friend. so it'll be: me, keesh, her friend, darcell, brittney, krystal, and whoever them two bring. if i wasn't selling my ticket to keesh's friend i was gonna ask ashley brewer if she wanted to go with us. or anyone on the team for that matter. 

i'm off work tomorrow, and we got practice at 2:45, so i don't know what i'm gonna do from 11:15-2:30. ahhh geeeez. i'll prolly just come home and sleep for a few hours, but i dunno, i don't feel like paying for a cab if i'm not working that day. i know coach would pick me up though, so if i can just find a ride home from school. hmmmm...

depending on how poly does tonight, it'll tell us if we're seeded. i kinda hope we are, but at the same time not. cuz like if we are, we won't play next friday, we wouldn't play til the following week. but if we aren't, we'd have a game next friday. but i mean i'm trying to go as far as possible so it'd give us lots more practice time n all. i wanna ask coach if he could have practice saturday, cuz as of now, we're not. i really wish we were though :/

friday night, we lost to overlea. by 1 point. we played like shit. i don't know how we can play so damn good wedsday, then play like shit 2 days later. we aren't getting a by this year for regionals. this is a first. the next 12 days=hell for practice. senior night is tomorrow, we play pikesville. i'm going to feel like shit with no parents there. i just hope some of my friends, or at least like 1 or 2 come. just so i have someone to give flowers or whatever they give us to. all the underclassmen keep meeting after practices lol, so i don't know what they are planning on getting us or something. we are going shopping either after practice today or before the game tomorrow for coach, coach, and john'as dad. i don't know what we're getting them all yet, but between the team we'll have $130 to spend, so hopefully we can find nice things.

after work=me and heather's evening of passionate romance!@$% haha. we bough all the goods to make our romantic candle lit dinner for two yesterday. it's going to be angel hair pasta with garlic alfredo sauce, broccoli, (chicken in hers), and mushrooms. and we got garlic bread for it, and then we are making strawberry short cake. yummmmmmmmm. i can't wait! i need to drink lots of coffee tonight to stay awake that late. haha. i'm such an early bird. i'm expecting I won't get out of work til like 1 or 2 if we are like they said it was last night (or worse). me and heather bought 2 movies from block buster for 10 DOLLARS LAST NIGHT!#$5 we're watching them bitches tonight. we might go back today and get more. we are getting a block buster card together next time we go too. shit will be gangstar.

before the game, when we were all there with our hands in, i was like ""tonight, let's do everything you know you'll regret after the game if you don't do it."" and we did. we played so incredible. if we keep this up, we'll go as far as possible. keesh said she thinks it was my little speech that made us so into it. that's so awesome. i'm just so happy right now.

also, starting this tuesday, i get out on work release. woooo hooooo. tomorrow is my last full day of school. thats awesome. <3.

we beat owings mills last night. i think my arm hurting threw my shot off, totally. i fucking missed almost every shot i took, and i took a shit load. it was rediculous. they did a good job denying to the post, but i still had mad shots. so needless to say, last night for me, totally sucked for points. :(  i'll get it back tomorrow night though, we go to chesapeake. i did however have a shit load of rebounds last night, and like 4 blocks, maybe more? so hopefully i'll be back in the Sun statistics for rebounds :/

i love just staying in my house by myself sometimes. i just get really bored though.

i probably should have tried working tonight seems how we didn't have school. if we get a blizzard, which we damn well better get one sometime before winter is over, then i'll definatly work a lot.

"event","me and shan had a wonderful evening after practice today. we went to the thrift store on bel air road and i bought like 5 shirts and bought her 2 as well. i got a frequent buyers card!#$ after i get it stamped like 10 times i get 10 dollars for free. woo hoooo. i spent like 19 there tonight. then we went to mcdonalds and we got a chocolate milkshake (that brought all the boys to the yard), 10 piece chicken nuggets, chicken sandwich and fries. it was good. i <3 mcdonalds. then we stopped at the hut so i could get my schedule. i don't know if i pull these 13 hours this week. lol.

we play lansdowne tomorrow... BIIIIG GAME... the only team that has beat us this year so far... we HAVE to beat them. definatly, have to kick some ass. right now, our team has the best record [9-1]... theres 2 teams (one being lansdowne) in our league that has the closest to that, which is 7-2. so we are in very good shape so far.

I MADE THE STATISTICS FOR REBOUNDING IN THE METRO AREA... i'm like #20 or something. that's so awesome man. ashley is in there for assists and john'a (of course for points!). score to that shit son.

my ear is hot, mine never does that, except when it gets really itchy, but it's not itchy, so this is odd.

i'm gonna try and fall asleep early tonight, considering i treid last night and didn't fall asleep til like 11 or 12 or some shiit. nite all.

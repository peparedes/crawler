"event","So a while back MCR did that thing <a href=""http://singitforjapan.com/"">#SINGitforjapan</a>. And like you could obviously buy the new version of Sing, or/and like a t-shirt or one of 200 prints of a photo I think Frank took in Japan.

I got one of those (<i>apparently nr. 27</i>), and today I went to get it at the post office (<i>it was slightly delayed, but they let us know so I was like *shrugs*</i>) and yes, it was in a cardboard tube so it wasn't fucked up at all. (<i>I hate when that happens. ugh. I mean the gets fucked up, obviously. lol.</i>)

Bought some food to eat because seriously haven't eaten anything since I woke up. lol. Oooops. XD Anyways when I got home I opened and my bros were like what is it, what is it?

My bro made a joke it was plumbing, or o_O a bomb. So I went all '<i>yeah, it's a pipebomb.</i>' idek. XD Not a funny thing to make a joke about, but ya know.

Anyways then I got the thing open and the Print is totally awesome, obviously. Otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. lol. I'mma frame it and I've always known where to hang that damn thing since I first bought it. XD Even tho that covers the sigs on the back. lol.

When I bought it it just said it'd be numbered and signed by Frank. <b>BUT</b> it was signed by <b>ALL</b> of them. :D

But I had no idea what their sigs even look like so I was all *<i>scratches head</i>* and the only one I knew was Mikey's because it just says <b>MIKEY</b>. XD It's kinda like how I write, except a little nicer. lol.

Then I took the pics below and put 'em on my Tumblr and the sig pic was like on the side. But eventually with the help of Twitter fronds, we managed to figure out which is which. XD

There's Mikey, then Gerard next to him and Under Mikey is Ray (<i>which I thought was Ray so hah I got him right at least</i>) and then Frank under Gerard (<i>and yes, lol my mind went ~there XD</i>)

Apparently Frank doesn't even write fast to get that scribble, he really concentrates on it. Or so I'm told. rofl. Adorbs weirdo. :')

So I am very, very happy. But in need of food and a frame for mah print. :D

So... I love this. And like if you can, you can buy this version on iTunes and 100% of the profits of the song goes to like Red cross Japan, I'm pretty sure. :33

All the info is at the end of the video and at <a href=""singitforjapan.com"">singitforjapan.com</a>.

Also if you can't buy the song (<i>like me D: unless I find someone willing to gift it to me or something</i>) you can if ya want buy a <a href=""http://singitforjapan.warnerbrosrecordsstore.com/"">T-shirt</a>. There was this print of a photo Frank Iero (<i>bandmember</i>) took in Japan. They were 200, signed by him and numbered. But he says they're sold out already. (<i>I got one. XD</i>)

All the profits of those things also go 100% to Japan.

I love this band. Like a lot. <3_<3"

And haha, the ep that just started? It's by Dollhouse's showrunners. lmao. Fain & Craft. lol. I remember it being a funny ep.

It's Harmony heavy. lol. But damn, I always kinda feel so bad for her. Even if she would have done the exact same thing in High School. She even stabbed Cordy in the back in High school. lol.

Fred is too nice for her own good. lol.

I'm gonna go back to teh watching. Yup."

<b>EDIT</b>: That prop 8 that banned gay marriage in California seems to have passed though, and stuff in other states. Which blows kinda for people living there. :( Kinda makes me not as happy. I mean this is awesome and all, but still. I really thought maybe California wouldn't let it pass. *<i>Sigh</i>*

"event","So I bumped across this on my f-list and thought I'd share it if you didn't see it on your f-list. :D

<i>Hopefully, on Tuesday, Californians will be voting down a proposition that will take away the right to gay marriage that was legalized by the California Supreme Court not that long ago. I just posted links to some videos here. 

In addition, I think we as part of the SGA fandom and any other fandoms who want to join (please post this around), should take a moment to write some drabbles on the theme of gay marriage.  Get ourselves pumped up and maybe donate, or at least chip in.  For everyone who writes a drabble or a fic as a comment to this post today, I'll donate a five dollars to the campaign, up to $150 (it would be a lot more if I wasn't a graduate student, trust me).  If anyone else wants to make a similar pledge, let me know and I'll add you.  

Thanks and I look forward to reading your drabbles.</i>

I know some of you do drabbles, and I thought you might like this. :D

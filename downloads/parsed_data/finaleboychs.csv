Today i stayed after school with akilah and sarah and this new girl named jessi... We had a freakin blast... akilah and sarah are so much fun... i just love how they are so care free and have no judgement and there is no drama... some would say that they are childish but i say they are probably the most mature people i know! well anyway... tonight was the colorguard auditions and like 20new people showed up which is totally awesome! It was so fun! Well i had to run the flags which is all the new people who have never spun before! That was interesting... I had to remind myself multiple times that patience is a virtue... well there was just this one girl with a headband... im sure that is going to be her new nickname lol! but anyway she was just crazy... We have dubbed her the new old megan for those of you who know what im talking about! ;)  Well im sure its going to be an interesting season and i am so freakin excited!

"event","I wish i had something new... I guess my life is pretty uneventful... Doug is coming over on friday... We're celebrating one month! I am going to make him dinner... I guess the only thing that is significant is that i had a big long long conversation with my parents about getting my tongue pierced for my birthday... Basically, the verdict was not until i am 17. oh well... what is one more year"

"event","Well, I finally gave in and got a live journal...  Mine is probably going to look like shit... I don't really know anything about this kind of stuff... On the bright side, i can finally bitch about people that have been annoying me... man i sound like a bitch... why am i cursing so much?  

Oooooooooo! i love this soundtrack... Its from the movie camp. That is such a good movie! I can't wait until GSA... It's going to be so much fun! I will miss doug though... and all my friends... I feel really bad for making it though... I wish akilah would have made it.. She is so amazing and deserves to make it... She thinks that i am... that i'm... Oh hell... i dont remember! but whatever it was i think she was right!

Hmmm... what to write, what to write...  I think i do ""..."" too much. I will try to stop. Anyway, back to doug.  I don't understand me... oh well maybe in the future i will have a better understanding about myself.."

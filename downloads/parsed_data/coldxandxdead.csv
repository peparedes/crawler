If you think cunt peice of shit is a good insult think harder if you can.
If you think I will just sit here and let life pass me by your wrong unless I go to jail then it will pass me by ha.
No you cannot fuck me over again.
So stop.
If you support gay rights thats cool.
If you have a baby thats cool.
If you don't care anymore about anything that is a serious mistake that you should take care off.
My cellar dog no longer lives in the cellar he lives in the upstairs world and hes pretty calm to he likes to swim in my brothers pool alot which I have a job cleaning argg but at least he doesnt live to far from Amandas plizzace so if anything CrAzY ever happens like before I can run down the street.
it would be cool to wake up and be like wow i's nice to see the sun even though the sun makes it the 100+ degrees it's been, and to be like wow I'm lucky to have ___, ___, and ___. And to know that someone else is waking up being thankful for the same things and for you that would be cool.

Her fucking parents had to pick her up from the police station otherwise she couldn't leave so they did and I saw her once for 5 mins before she left I hope her parents don't effect her or our relationship which would be the worst thing that could happen but I think it migt happen. The police found a pipe ( Bob) and 4 grams on Loraine and I took the blame for it I got my picture taken with a sign that said my name like all the other convicts much like myself hehe and I got finger printed and I have court Thursday morning at 8:30 and I may be going to a boot camp/juvenile place in new bedford for a few weeks or maybe WWL whichever they prefer but maybe nothing will happen who fucking cares I just want Susie back on thursday night and us to start getting OUR life together got anything bad to say about that anyone?

So shes been bitching at me to get a job ect... but I allready explained when she gets my car insured I will get a job. She hasn't slept at home because ""the police are ready to bust me"" bt it's just her poor excuse. Susie cut off her life from her parents and they think its my fault but it's really not. Today is me and Susie's 6 month anniversary, which is the nly good thing thats been going on. My mom is spending all of her inheritance money on the stupidest shit, she's gone to Florida twice and Hawaii next and it's been 3 months barely 150 to 30 in 3 months. She gave my sister a 9,000 dollar check and wrote "" i heart u"" on it but she has yet to get me my labtop or anything really the only thing I got was 100$ worth clothes that is known. I'm not one to usually be ungreatful but when promised so many things and I haven't got any of them but yet my sister who is in Hawaii got a 9,000 dollar check I'm getting pissed a little. My mother is just a lazy hypocritical middle aged women who doesn't know how to take care of a house or a hygene problem let alone any problem I would need help with. Susie is making me really sad and likes to make me feel bad for everything I say she stares out the window like an emo kid just so I can consoul her because she knows when shes sad it effects me more than anything. I'm debating on the ending to the story  again everything is just annoying with it though. I'm really annoyed with my mother picking her favorites and over-reacting with the stupidest things. FUCKING CLEAN THE CAT LITTER BOX YOU STUPED BITCH BEFORE YOU COMMAND ME TO DO YOUR LAUNDRY. My neighbor thinks she should be on MTV's Super Sweet SIxteen, which makes me laugh. My sister took a bunch of my clothes and Susies back to Hawaii with her and I'm pissed cause she stretched them BADLY, considering they are Susie's. ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

"event","I don't know if I'm really ready to drop out of high school, I know I hate it and I cant be in a high school building for more than 3 hours at a time but I don't know if I can just drop out. Dropping out is a much bigger decision than I thought it would be. Since I have to decide by the 28'th what I want to do I thought I might give an effort to think about it more. If I drop out I really have nothing I'll be the same way I am now but possibly more lonely considering susie is getting a job and won't be around all the time. So I thought about just getting a job to replace school. But there is a certain enjoyment I get from school, wheather it's the fact I do nothing and watch other people try so hard and stress about it all the time that ammuses me, I sit back and do nothing as people try and make me achieve my ""full potential"" and laugh at their attempts, or the fact I know that this goal they call ""graduating"" is completely achievable for me, or maybe I like to laugh at the teenage antics and drama, or just fucking like the people I don't know. I don't go to school now because it takes away my time from things I wish to do, and people I wish to be with, and because I don't like to be around people who think they have authority over me. I don't want to waste the next 3 years of my life sitting in a prison they call Westwood High School. But I secretely do want what they want, a diploma, just to show that the people who seem not to care are just as good at anything, as long as they want it. Stress makes me hurt. What the fuck is the answer to this bullshit.

Sociomatic< or something

- I'm failing EVERYTHING, but the school is 90% sure I won't have to stay back if I work my ass off.
- I have a huge hatred towards school, teachers, westwood, academics, authoritative fugures, tests, quizes, homework ect...
- BUT when I do my work it's usually mostly right.
- I'd rather stay in bed all day 12am-12pm than go to school at 745am-210pm
- I don't believe in time it's just there for people to overstress about.

I'm really getting annoyed with certain females. It feels like they try and make me feel bad for everything no matter how apologetic I am about things, and then I am guilted into giving up the world for them. Tears and Screams is what I'm use to hearing all the time it makes me hurt. And I've gotten sicker than before, I can see all the changes in myself and they are horrible. I see the way she treated others and flirted with them  ""Susie and Jills love was undescriable and forever will be the best feeling she ever had"". Then I see everything she said to her and how much she told her she loved her ect...and I just wish that I could seem like I have an effect on her. It seems like she treats me as a friend with benefits type of thing, and like shes not trying to be anything more. She told her how much she missed her an hour after she left, she told her how much she thought of herm flirted with her to try an impress her. I feel like all my appeal to her has been lost, and I just feel unwanted. Oh boo-who. Get Over It! Right?"

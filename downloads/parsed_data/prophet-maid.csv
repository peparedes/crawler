-Make Michael Kors dress round 2
-Light colored linen trousers for summer
-Double breasted winter coat with a shawl collar.

That last one is my next big project. The linen trousers I'm doing partially because I want more linen pants, but also because I really wanna get the fit down on my ""full rear"". The coat on the other hand will be my first attempt at interlining, a rolled collar, possibly pad stitching, maybe some tailoring, and I'm going to try to figure out the swayback adjustment (see also ""full rear""). Now that I have my shiny new machine I'm not afraid of things like buttonholes!"

How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Boris Karloff version of course. We watched that every single year on Christmas Eve at my dad's house, and it's one of the few family traditions that I've actually kept. That and eating ""roast beast"" for dinner. Of course if you watch a movie 20+ times in your life you'll get it memorized, but I still love every moment of that film.

"event","I just received word from <lj user=""jadeejf""> that some of you have sent harassing emails to the person referenced in my last post. 

Seriously, wtf? People, that is just unacceptable. This person, who is hurting over her own situation, lost sight of basic compassion and said something incredibly hurtful and offensive to me. Which means that I sent her an email detailing how what she said was hurtful, and ranted about it here and on facebook, because that's how I deal with things. But 1) I deal with this stuff..ME. 2) I have no ill will towards her. I still like her, I still wish her well, and told her so explicitly. What she said seriously crossed the line, but was said out of blindness, not malice. 

Just so you're aware, if you say something that pisses me off, if you do something I find truly unacceptable, you WILL hear about it from me, directly, in no uncertain terms. I don't play this passive aggressive talk behind the back game. 

A lot of people can't handle that, so you're being warned. 

I posted that entry for a reason, much like I'm posting this one. I hate how women in particular judge other women, and I hate how all of that judgment is used to silence and shame women. I've ranted about this before. So yes, when it comes up in my life, I will write about it here, partially to just release my anger, but also to make an example. What my friend said to me yesterday was unacceptable. It is unacceptable for anyone to treat any other person like that.

I'm making this entry today because it was unacceptable for you (and i don't know who you are, other than my lj friend) to send a harassing email to her. Or to contact her in any way. What happened between us is our business, which is why I said nothing identifying beyond what was immediately relevant to the situation. Perhaps her entry in question was public, I don't remember. Regardless, even if I said ""look at what <name> did to me!"" it is NOT acceptable. 

So, seriously, SHAME ON YOU. Also, what the fuck?

She reported you to LJ abuse, which sounds like was highly deserved. Seriously unacceptable people!

I'm making this one of my very few public entries. I want it KNOWN that I don't find shit like this acceptable under any circumstance. Moreover, as I suspect she will check up on this, I want her to know that I did not intend for my friends to harass her, did not provide identifying information, and did not suggest in any way that such a thing was acceptable. I don't mind if people think badly over stuff I've actually done, but it really pisses me off when people project shit on me and then hate me for it. 

I'm also disabling comments on this because I don't want deal with this situation any more. It's unfortunate, but it's done. Get over it. I have.

Cut it out people. And the two of you who sent her emails, apologize. Be a fucking adult."

<lj-cut text""I see this as a blessing"">
I'm a pagan, and when I purchased this house I swore to the Nature Spirits that I would do what I could to restore my land to be friendly to wildlife, and that I would allow any creature onto my land. Because of that oath, I've been trying to organically turn a barren, barely grass-covered clay lot into something that is sustainable, promotes biodiversity, is beautiful, and is a haven for wildlife. 

Keep in mind, I have a very small lot, so there's not a ton I can do.

In the past 3 years since I've bought this house I managed to, without chemicals, get my desolate suburban-like yard to thrive. I now have several trees, bushes, groundcover (mostly grass and clover, but I'm working on that), a garden, etc. My project is by no means finished. I want 2 prairie patches, lots of berrying bushes, and more. But it's a start. Considering the previous owners, with the help of professional turf managers (my local University's soccer field guy), could barely get mud to grow, I think I've been doing a damn good job.

And considering how elusive these moths are, that I've never seen them before in my life, and all of a sudden I have 2 gigantic moths that chose my yard as their home...well, I can't but see that as a sign I'm doing something right. Thus, I feel really really blessed. 

WOOT!

"event","Today is the 36th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, and like many women, I must mark this occasion with a post.

I am pro-choice. Outspokenly, adamantly, born and bred pro-choice. I was literally raised to be pro-choice by parents who are pro-choice. I will be doing the same with my daughter.

Because I am pro-choice, my daughter will always know that she exists solely because I wanted her. Not because my religion tells me I must breed (I'm looking at you Catholicism and Evangelical Christianity), not because my culture tells me I must breed (personally notable, Indians), not because of any political ideology (Republicans), not for any social recognition, not for any monetary reward (*cough* Duggars *cough*), not to make the world a better place or influence politics in any way (Evangelicals). Not even to please my family (despite my stepmother-in-law's prodding).

I am pregnant for the one truly justifiable reason to be so: I want to. I wanted to be a parent, and thus I will be. I think the fact that I have not been coerced in any way, that this pregnancy is my truly free choice, is vitally important and profound.

And it is my dearest wish that my daughter has this same choice.

I did not grow up believing that I was going to be a mother some day, that it was a foregone conclusion because I am the owner of a uterus. In fact, for a long time, I was convinced I never would be, and not just because of infertility. I similarly believe the same about my daughter. She may be a mother, she may not. That's her choice.

I do not believe that I am doing anything ""right"" or ""good"" because I got married at 22 and decided to have children at 22. (Of course, infertility and all means I won't have a child until I'm 25, but that's beside the point), though I have been explicitly told so. I do not believe I did anything ""wrong"" or ""bad"" because my husband is not my first sexual partner, or my second, or my third, or that he has done anything ""wrong"" or ""bad"" because I am not his first, or his second, or his third, and that neither of us have any other children because of sufficient use of a myriad of birth control options, even though I have been explicitly told so.

I believe that the only way to have a just society is to let people follow their bliss, to quote Joseph Campbell. That means to give every single person the free choice to decide their own life. I may in many ways be living a rather ""traditional"" (whose tradition?) female life, but solely because I choose to. I could have chosen to go to grad school and pursue a career in history and never had a family; in fact, I almost did.

I expect the same for my daughter. I have no life plan mapped out for her. She may go to college, she may not. She may have children, she may not. She may marry, or not, and may have sex with 15 women or only one man over her life, as she so chooses.

And should my daughter come to me someday and tell me she is pregnant under less than ideal circumstances, my reaction won't be to applaud or denigrate her, it won't be to tell her what to do, but to ask her what she wants to do. And then I will fully support her in any choice she makes, because I trust her enough, and value her enough, to let her make her own decisions.

Because of this, my daughter will be luckier than most, happier than most, and healthier than most. And that, right there, is the legacy of Roe v. Wade."

Thank everything above!!!!!</a>

I've been scared to death, almost literally, about the new rule Bush put in, set to take effect today, that amongst other things labels ""any act"" which can conceivably be construed to ""causing"" the end of a pregnancy to be abortion. It further made it illegal(?) to fire any employee of a health institution if they refused to do any part of their job because of their religious beliefs. 

I've read the actual regulation, and it is worded in such a way that, should I wind up in hospital bedrest, an evangelical janitor could refuse to clean my room because of my religious beliefs. It was SPECIFICALLY, INTENTIONALLY worded in this way so that reproductive treatments could be denied to homosexuals.

Obama is not the feminist I was hoping for, but he has been steadfastly pro-choice, thank everything above. This new rule would have amazingly horrific consequences for women's health, and ON THE FIRST FUCKING DAY of his administration Obama put a stop to it!

HOLY FUCK YEAH OMG THIS IS SO OMG YAY! 

I can't be any more coherent than that. I was so afraid he'd overlook it and other horrific regs Bush put in in the last 60 days, and he didn't!!!!!!

Shockingly, I responded. Magnanimously, if I might say, though I really wanted to call her a bigoted, paranoid bitch.

-""He's spent almost his entire adult life on one public payroll or another and proved himself a political opportunist at nearly every turn.""
-""One of the Senate's many <b>millionaires</b>, he's steadily climbed the ladder to the No. 2 post on the Democratic leadership team. In that position, he puts his partisan instincts to good use, blasting Republicans at every opportunity for real and imagined sins. Sometimes he gives his tongue too much free rein, like the time he likened U.S. troops in Iraq to Nazis or guards in Soviet gulags. Durbin caught so much flak he had to issue an insincere apology to cover his back.""

Ok, fine, total bullshit reasons to not like Durbin. Whatever.

2 days ago the same newspaper endorsed John McCain, a ""lifelong public servant"" who's never had a job in the private sector, who's so rich he forgets how many houses he owns, and says crazy stuff all the time.

<a href=""http://rioiriri.blogspot.com/2008/10/guest-post-sizing-in-stitchery.html"" target=""_blank"">This author</a> goes through her vintage clothing patterns, compares measurements, and pretty much proves that somewhere in the late 70s they started making clothes for women who had no figure (small boob to waist ratio) and stopped growing at about age 10. 

For some reason, the pre-pubescent look has stuck around, and we're all supposed to devote our lives to fitting into that.

Obviously, I call shenanigans. 

I'd love to go back to the time when a 44 1/2 inch bust was a pattern size 16, not the current pattern size 26. And, for the record, pattern v. street sizes, back when  I wore a street size 6 I was a pattern 12. So, a pattern 16 is roughly the equivalent of a 1960s street size 10. But, now, with my 44 1/2 inch bust, I'm practically in plus sizes.

And yet the continue to claim that they've had to expand clothing sizes to fit out disgustingly fat asses who don't deserve to wear clothing.

So, read this article, especially if you know anything about clothing. It's fascinating."

10 minutes into her speech, and she's made one single comment about policy, and none about herself. It's all McCain (understandable), and another round of introductions of her family. And so far, mostly her family.

10:23: Identity politics much?

12:00: So she's not Obama. Who the fuck is she?

13:22: So she is Obama? (Not a member of the Washington elite...)

15:00: Still no policy, just ""change""

17:53: I like vetos!

18:00: Finally she's talking issues and not stupidity. Well, it's still stupid, but it's better.

23:00: American workers bla bla bla; what about all the corporations shipping the jobs overseas?

24:24: Making fun of Obama for the same shit you all did for Bush is just kinda dumb...

25:00: So she's opposed to Constitutional rights. Why am I not surprised?

30:00: It's a 'do-nothing Senate' because Bush vetos everything that isn't filibustered by the Republicans. Which you've promised MORE of.

31:00: Be afraid cuz it's scary out there

And you know what, that's fine. Being fat is fine. The idea that fat=bad is not. 

I'm fat. I'm not disgusting, lazy, a pig, a non-human, unworthy of love, unworthy of decent clothes, ""oozing"", to quote one person on my friends list, smelly, ugly, disgusting, or any other bogus idea attached to fat.

I'm bigger than some women, smaller than others. I'm actually about as big as my mother, maybe, which means this is more than likely my final weight (dear god I hope so, I don't want a whole new damn wardrobe), and that's fine. 

I'm fat, and I honestly think I'm beautiful (when I'm not horrifically depressed and listening to the barrage of media messages). I have a great body, I'm curvy, I have boobs most people pay $1000s for, I have a better ass than either Beyonce or J-Lo (and always have, thank you!) and most importantly, I take up space. And I LIKE that I take up space. 

If the size of my body disgusts you, you have a problem, not me.

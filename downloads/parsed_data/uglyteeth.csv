"event","The other night I went out to LJs because this dude Trevor was ""spinning records"" or some kind of stupid shit. I mean, there was a snow storm, I felt like a beer, and I figured that maybe just maybe I would hear some so-so music. In the middle of a not bad, but definitely not incredible evening this butter face (old smashed in hag) stood up near the end of the bar and decided why the hell not, and got super nasty. She took off her top, then her pants, and tried her very best to shake some shit. I mean, really, shit. Then she waddled up and down the bar showing off her super-obvious fake tits. She even tried to impress us (or scare us) by rubbing a dollar bill or two in her ass-crack. (I learned the importance of washing your hands after being anywhere near money.) In the middle of the gross naked madness Colin came up and asked me where I had left my purse. Puzzled, I looked under a pile of coats where I had left it along with Kyle's. Of course, it was long gone. I looked up at him as he told me to follow him outside. He pointed out this run down lady near the end of the block. Without even a second thought I sprinted toward her. I snatched, twisted her arm back and yelled to see under her coat. I mean, she was holding it over a bulge in her belly. Think about that, It was snowing cats and dogs outside and there is no way (at least I'm hoping) anybody stuck a baby in that monster, so really, what could she be hiding? We started to tussle, and finally, like a ray of hot white light l I saw my leather bag swinging near the top of her shoulder. The sight of it made me go absolutely hog wild. I pulled her in closer and started yelling big triumphant swear words and names (like crack bitch, for instance) before kicking the complete shit out of her. I grabbed her by the throat and started to punch her in already sunk-in mug. I stopped after I had her pinned down in the middle of the road in a pile of snow; short (unfortunately) of any nose bleeds or fat black eyes, just to let her know that there wasn't even a good fifteen cents in my entire bag."

When we got there it was sort of slow and weird, so we knew we should maybe take over - like some band of party heros. Unfortunately, they (the throwers and goers) weren't so into it. We definitely cleared most of the rooms, especially the makeshift dance floor. I'm still real shocked they didn't appreciated a gem like, ""Hoochie Mama."" After a good-looking puke over the porch into the nice white snow I really took form. I danced wild on a coffee table, yelling, before flipping it on it's back and then throwing every couch and chair cushion I could around the room. Someone said, ""Why is this happening?"" I then, threw my drink to the floor and we ran from the party, laughing crazy. I'm going to go out on a limb and say I'm not invited back, ever."

Pouring a real heavy, satisfying layer over top of them. Except I, of course, didn't actually grab the tiny salt shaker. Instead I, being a real pinhead, picked up the giant glass jar of sugar. The waitress looked at me sort-of cross eyed and then asked in a sweet voice, ""Do you always put sugar on your french fries?""

Fortunately, for my sake, they were actually (and not lying) kind of good - like carnival fries, or kettle corn. The embarrassment, not as good-tasting."

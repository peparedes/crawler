Today was actually quite uneventful, but oh well. I painted a fence...or some of a fence...and i got all painty! oh my =O!! Then afterwards i went over QuElLeS hizouse..which rocked! when I got there we ran (literally) down to the movie rental..place and like the cool kids that we are, we rented IcE pRiNcEsS, and then we ran back. YAY of course, after all that we each had a piece of chocolate cake, which made me feel..well...not quite as guilty as i would have. We also watched an episode of Hellsing, and read some of her stories ( i envy her writing ability). 

we also did this...lmao...

Jess/PARTAY/WHAT NOW: ...Of course...does it come out of a duck's nose two? What if it really did? I mean, what if, NO, what if like okay, but like what if the duck drank the milk and it came out it's nose...HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE! So a cow would have to drink milk.

Quelle/Pants: Right...If you throw a cat out a car window does it become KITTY LITTER?

Quelle/I fall in love with bad guys: Why do suicide pilots wear helmets?

JESS/Dancer: Now theirs a tricky one, i guess either 1) they dont want it to hurt as much. Or 2) They are crazy people to begin with and ALWAYS have to wear a helmet and they figured, HEY im not going to take my helmet off right before i die! 3) it was welded to their head in an unfortunate welding accident. 4) He was born with it, and he thought...YAY! (not sure why he thought yay, he just did).

   today, as you may have guessed (or may not have) was my brothers birthday, and it was quite eventful! he had like, ALL his friends over, so i got nominated to play part time babysitter...which i didnt mind, but it got kinda boring. tOaSt came over to keep me company, and we took lotsa hott pictures. oh, and whats more is that we (or at least i) at more then my body weight today in junk food (hehehe jpjp).
   Lada on tOaSt left for work...but then came back and with her came f.FrIe,lEoN, and my sExIi BeAsT kYlE! (who wouldnt leave his belt here..lmao) we just kinda hung out and went swimming.(which was totally rad by the way...even tho lEoN didnt swim....oh well!)
   Tomorrow should be quite eventful because of bree, and ryan (which explains why my life is like a really interesting soap oprah) but its always fun.
    i guess i really have nothing else to say...except for the fact that i am exhausted, and i am sooo gunna need an ice cream tomorrow! YAY! lol

i love you with all my &hearts;"

"event","hey hey heyy!

 so this is what it feels like to have a livejournal...hmm...to be perfectly honest i dont think that it feels any different! oh well, im totally rad now (rite? hehe) today (or rather yesterday) i watched brat camp with f.FrIe, tOaSt, and kYlE (he was on the phone) and we all used our earth names (man were crazy!) and then f.FrIe went home and tOaSt and i went outside and just layed on the street, which is pretty normal. shes like my mini therapist (well..basically) we talk about everything. goodness gracious me oh my..im not really sure what i'd do without my friends. 
   This weekend i was supposed to go with sPaZz to Maine.. but i have to babysit on monday and tuesday so i have to stay home and go up later, so whatever. um. f.FrIe got a new fridge...which (although it may not seem it) is totally rad! so i was there basically all of yesterday. or today....which ever you prefer. 
   Rite now im actually quite bored and so tired! so i pinky promise i will update..and all that fun sha-stuff.

much love &hearts;"

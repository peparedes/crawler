"event","wow these last few days have prolly been the worst of my life.  i didnt end up going to see evanescence like i planed on doing.  thursday my grandma had to go to the hospital.  they dont kno what is wrong with her.  she is gettin better now tho so thats good.  also thursday my sweet tart decided he was going to join the navy.  he had to stay at a hotel that night to take the physical the next day and sign up.  he did all that and went to sign up and they didnt have the job he wanted.  so he was sposed to go monday for another job but went on vacation with his family.  that means no sweet tart for a week =-(  i dunno what he plans on doing when he comes back.  i hope he doesnt sign up.  i want him to be happy but i dunno.  i dont think he needs that. he could do good on his own.  i will miss him sooooooooo much if he goes.  i miss him already and he has only been on his vacation for a day.  heh

Lying here with you 
Listening to the rain 
Smiling just to see the smile upon your face 
These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive 
These are the moments I'll remember all my life 
I found all I've waited for 
And I could not ask for more 
Looking in your eyes 
Seeing all I need 
Everything you are is everything to me 
These are the moments 
I know heaven must exist 
These are the moments I know all I need is this 
I have all I've waited for 
And I could not ask for more 


I could not ask for more than this time together 
I could not ask for more than this time with you 
Every prayer has been answered 
Every dream I have's come true 
And right here in this moment is right where I'm meant to be 
Here with you here with me 

These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive 
These are the moments I'll remember all my life 
I've got all I've waited for 
And I could not ask for more 


I could not ask for more than the love you give me
'Coz it's all I've waited for 
And I could not ask for more 
I could not ask for more

But you can't see his blood 
It's nothing but some feelings 
That this old dog kicked up 

It's been raining since you left me 
Now I'm drowning in the flood 
You see I've always been a fighter 
But without you I give up 

Now I can't sing a love song 
Like the way it's meant to be 
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore 
But baby, that's just me 

And I will love you, baby - Always 
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always 
I'll be there till the stars don't shine 
Till the heavens burst and 
The words don't rhyme 
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind 
And I'll love you - Always 

Now your pictures that you left behind 
Are just memories of a different life 
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry 
One that made you have to say goodbye 
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair 
To touch your lips, to hold you near 
When you say your prayers try to understand 
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man 

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near 
When he says the words you've been needing to hear 
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine 
To say to you till the end of time 

Yeah, I will love you baby - Always 
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always 

If you told me to cry for you 
I could 
If you told me to die for you 
I would 
Take a look at my face 
There's no price I won't pay 
To say these words to you 

Well, there ain't no luck 
In these loaded dice 
But baby if you give me just one more try 
We can pack up our old dreams 
And our old lives 
We'll find a place where the sun still shines 

And I will love you, baby - Always 
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always 
I'll be there till the stars don't shine 
Till the heavens burst and 
The words don't rhyme 
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind

today i had a gay soccer game at 11:30.  it was really the worst game ive ever played in my entire life.  eric came to watch and i felt like and idiot cuz i sucked so bad. we only had like 1 sub tho. oh well, maybe next time.  today at work we were short a girl.  on top of doing all of her work, the dishwasher broke.  heh great.  we still got outta there at 7 tho so it wasnt too bad.

"event","well valentines day is this saturday.  im kinda already upset about it.  i kno its just some stupid hallmark holliday or whatever but the fact that ive NEVER had a valentine before makes me really want one this year.   i dunno y.  i guess i get jealous of everyone that has one... im stupid like that

prom is like 3 or so months away and im upset about that too.  ive never had a date to a school dance and i would really like one for prom.  i have this feeling i wont get one.  eveyone is like youll for sure find one for prom, but i dont want some kid that is like oh i need a date too ill go with you.  ive always wanted to go with someone that cares about me....i dunno how well thats gonna work out.

i dunno why lately ive been in this strange mood. maybe cuz im sick. i dunno.  i need to pull away.....

Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want 
Where you can always find me
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight 
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness 
Comes creeping on so haunting every time 
And as I stared I counted 
Webs from all the spiders 
Catching things and eating their insides 
Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason Will you come home and stop this pain tonight 
Don't waste your time on me you're already  
The voice inside my head

<h3>i love this song! =-) </h3>
The real me is a southern girl with her Levis on and an open heart
Wish I could save the world, like I was super girl
The real me used to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I start thinking about it, I almost forgot what it was like
To know what it feels right
Cause with you
I can let my hair down 
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you 
With you, with you, with you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me
Cuz I'm start thinking about it, I almost forgot what it was like
To know what it feels right
Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you

Come and take me
Love you save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself
With you

With you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now (Baby as I do now)
Now that I'm with you"

OH NO it was all together.  IT RIPPED OUT OF MY FACE!! OMG! =-(  very sad.  

after soccer me and my mom and tristin went out to eat. i came home and put my pjs on to see if any of the three (3) people that said they wanted to hang out would call.  none of them did.  so at like 11 ryan called and was like just got off of work, do u want to hang out? so we went to coney island for a lil bit. we came back to my house and watched mtv for awhile.  he kept saying how tired he was then eventually fell asleep on my couch and was like wake me up at 2.  i was like ummm ok. lol  i felt bad having to wake him up cuz i knew how tired he was.  but i had to cuz i didnt want him to get into trouble or anything for being late, so i woke him up.  he went home then i went up to bed.  just as i was falling asleep, i get a drunken phone call.  oh man was it funny. i talked till i was so tired i couldnt stay awake any longer, which was like 10 or 15 mins. lol

today didnt wake up till like 1:15.   have to work 4-7 today.  i think ima go eat some breakfast now"

omg such great seats. such a good time! oh man, that chester! =-) saw katie and nathan there, that was nice.  cant even describe how happy i was to see LINKIN PARK!!!!!!!

blah my mom didnt let me stay home today tho! lame!!!!!! so i didnt get home till like 1 am and had to go to school! errrr.  on top of it all, i have to work till 7.  again, very lame.  ryan is sposed to come over to finish up fixing our computer.  i hope he does cuz this thing pisses me off a lot and if he can make it better, ill be happy! =-)

tomorrow right after school i have to go see about this other job.  its a business ran outta their home, like that is prolly 1.859 mins from my house, so thats  nice.  you only have to work 3 days a week till 5, not bad not bad at all.  so well see about that.  then after the job thing i have to go to the bank right quick cuz my bill came for the BAHAMAS!!!!!! woop ima going to the BAHAMAS!!!!!! then i think maybe if i can get someone to go with me, i NEED to go to the 89x building to pick up my poster before they give it away or something!  so hopefully ill be able to do that!

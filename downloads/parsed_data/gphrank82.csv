To all the faithful followers that read the tales of near epic proportion held within my livejournal, I apologize for the lack of consistency in my entries.  I have actually been quite busy lately, thus making it difficult to post on even a nearly regular basis.  Basically I have been very consumed during the week by this pesky thing called work, and then in evenings have not done too much more than work out and make the most important phone calls of my day (clearly referring to my late night talks with Allison, not my business calls).

Speaking of Allison, she's pretty alright by me.  In fact, I've got to say that my stress levels have been significantly decreased lately, and I'm generally a happier person.  Although there is no way to truly eliminate all the crap that comes my way, she certainly has an odd ability to lessen the blow to all the negativity that I encounter and brings a ridiculous amount of positivity into my life as well.  For this, I cannot thank her enough.

Aside from this, things are pretty decent in general.  I have a lot to look forward to in the coming weeks here.  Christmas Eve with the Marheinekes will be rockin' as always, Christmas day with the Conti's and special guest Allison should prove to be a good time...still working on my white elephant gift.  None other than PAT TUCKER'S wedding with a good portion of the CMU Crew will clearly be a blast, and of course, New Year's Eve at Uncle Tim and Aunt Milissa's is always a good time.  Stay posted kids, I'll keep you all in the loop.

Oh yeah, and bundle up, its cold out there...I'm calling a cuddle alert!

My highest regards,
~Gino~"

"event","For those of you who hadn't noticed, it snows in Michigan.  This creates situations in which it is not pleasurable, safe, or simple to drive in.  This is particularly applicable for people who find it necessary to drive light, powerful, rear-wheel drive cars.  How stupid.

I am that guy.

I was very convinced upon time of purchase I would never regret my new car, but as of yesterday at approximately 9:36 am, I wanted to kill my Z...

I am actually not quite sure what was more embarassing, the fact that I spun out and found my car 3/4 of the way onto the median of the traffic circle, or the fact that the owner of a Hummer dealership came out chuckling at me to pull my car back onto the road.

All in all, it was quite the exciting experience, and going on past performance of about 24 hours of snow driving in the Z, it will be far more challenging than the Mustang.  I have a distinct feeling I will quickly get much better at oversteering, compensating, and sliding all over the damn road.  

Well, I'd love to write you all my life story here, but there are things to be done.  It is the Friday prior to the wine-tasting party and there is much to be done.  I am so very excited for some fine wine, great food, and even better company...that's right, Allison will be here :)

Until next time, be safe, have fun, and stay sexy.

Much love,

"event","29 degrees Fahrenheit is not warm.  I for one know this, but don't seem to exude the same amount of respect for said low temperature as others in the area do.  I lately have been blaming this on the fact that my office is about 85 degrees after 2:00 PM when they stop circulating the air in our building.  Basically, I combat this by getting away with polo shirts or thin dress shirts whenever possible, and never am in the mood to wear a jacket or sweater for fear of suffering a heat stroke in the late afternoon during an intense phone call.

This really hasn't proven to be a problem until this evening.  I went to the gym to work out, and it was a hard cardio day for me.  Being the genius I am, I figured I could just make a dash for my car after the workout.  Keep in mind...29 degrees and windy...I just worked out...I was sweaty...and running...into the wind.

Basically I discovered that a sweaty T-shirt is not a good source of insulation or protection from the elements.

Unfortunately this learning experience is probably lost on me, and I will likely repeat said events tomorrow.  I think this proves my idiocy, but I could be wrong.

Moral of the story...bundle up kids, its cold out there.

It was brought to my attention that my livejournal is horribly out of date by Allison this past weekend.  I think it was somewhere in between naps and our hectic workout schedule that she mentioned coming across my LJ by way of reading a post on Armand's.  Absolute craziness.

In the interest of catching you all up...Allison is the girlfriend of the eldest Gino.  Should you require details, backstory, explanation, details, or my hopelessly romantic plans for dating her just ask.  Just be sure to want to hear a lot of talk...I get going pretty good on subjects I like talking about.

I really have nothing else of note, to put in here, no really amusing stories, and nothing earth shattering at the moment.  However, I will attempt to entertain you on a more regular basis with anecdotes of my daily activities and clever, witty banter.

Ok, so really I'm sure that nobody will actually read this, after all, why would you?  I haven't posted in forever, and it is very likely that what I am about to ramble on about is not going to be very entertaining, so you should just stop reading right now.

The last few weeks have been relatively uneventful, in so much as nothing earth-shattering has happened lately.  Pretty much classes and working out have been all-consuming time commitments lately, and I haven't really done too much other than that, and spending some time with my lovely girlfriend when our free time coincides with one anothers.

This last weekend was pretty hectic, and anybody at CMU should know why...Central Western weekend.  The entire campus was crawling with visitors all weekend long and basically, you were hard-pressed to find a sober person past about 10 pm anywhere.  There was one pretty amusing story that came of this, though...

Our neighbors happen to enjoy partying quite a bit, apparently.  And they do not limit themselves to alcohol, because aparently smoking mad ganga is where its at.  Anyhow, hippy girl Patti came over asking to borrow Paul's cake pan to make some brownies.  As soon as she left with it, Paul and I both determined that brownie mix would not be the only thing in that pan.  Indeed we were right.  A couple days later, a totally wasted Patti returned a sparkling clean, but still reeking of weed pan.  I am still cautious to use it for fear that I might cook some dinner in it and accidentally go to class high.

So yeah, that was my major entertainment for the weekend.  Kinda lame, I know, but hey - I also found five bucks the other day!

Catch ya on tha flipside -

"event","Ok, so this was quite the weekend for me, specifically because of what happened on Friday night.  

[Backstory]  Kassidy spent the summer working with a guy named Scott.  Scott is gay.  Scott and Kassidy became friends.  [End backstory]

Kassidy and I drove to Grand Rapids on Friday to hang out with Scott.  Needless to say the place he chose to go out to was none other than Diversions, the gay bar in Grand Rapids.  I was pretty interested to see what things would be like.  Basically I envisioned it to be much like any other bar, but with the possibility of seeing some guys making out, or maybe a few drag queens.  Either way, I wasn't totally sure of what I would find, but wanted to be prepared so as not to seem shocked by anything I may have come across.  

Basically the beginning of the evening was relatively uneventful, with Kassidy, Scott and I mostly just chillin' in the bar, enjoying a few drinks (my favorite was the one legged lesbian kick boxer) and talking about the crowd in the bar.  I did see one drag queen, and he/she was not that impressive [oh well].  The real excitement began with my first trip to the bar while Kassidy and Scott sat by themselves.  I went up to get some water so that I wouldn't be totally dehydrated, and appartently one of the bartenders came over to Scott and Kassidy and said I was cute and asked if I was single.  Not only did my girlfriend and her friend lie to say I was single simply to embarass me, but they also added that I was well endowed, and would not be embarassed if he asked for my number.  Needless to say, this provided for a little bit of an awkward scenario later.  Then, with my first trip to the bathroom, I was just letting down my fly to relieve myself, and all of a sudden I felt a hand firmly gripping my left ass-cheek.  Splendid.  I serioiusly had to try so hard not to laugh out loud that I'm glad I was peeing into a urinal because otherwise it would have been all over.  The next two embarassing/interesting scenarios happened pretty much at the same time.  Scott went up to sing a song for kareoke and announced that I was single and needed a man.  I have never seen a person get out of his seat as fast as my soon-to-be buddy Christian was.  At least his promptness was pretty flattering.  Then, Scott put my name in for kareoke without really warning me.  So I went up to sing, and he sent up one of his bartender friends [male] to come and grind on me and give me a kiss while singing.  Again, this was quite unexpected, but I had nothing to do other than laugh and go with the flow.

Honestly, though, I had a freakin' blast.  Even though some of the stuff that happened to me was a little bit embarassing at the moment, by the time I made it back to the table after each of these incidents I was laughing so hard it didn't even matter.  

So really, that was my excitement for the weekend.  I seriously suggest a trip to a gay bar for any straight man who is comfortable enough to be seen there.  I know I had a good time, and wouldn't turn down and invitation for a second trip there.  Seeya next time kids!

Really after an intro like that, you would expect my readership to be pretty big, but I'm assuming all of 5 people will actually read this.  Oh well.  Basically things have been pretty much business as usual up here, with a few exceptions.  First of all, I had my first experience at an actual bar last Thursday.  Kassidy and I went out to Boomer's and we had a blast!  It was definitely a good time, and although I am not planning on making going out a regular event, I would go again.

Then on Saturday I got to witness Adams shut our Groves 21-0.  Way to go boys!  After that I went and finally got my tattoo done!  I have been waiting to do this for so long, and now I finally have!  It looks amazing and I am really happy with it.  After that I came back up, and as promised, Kassidy was the first to see it.  

Sunday was pretty relaxed, really, and I'm happy about that.  Kassidy and I went to Church early, came home and had some lunch and laundry.  Then I helped her put some highlights in her hair [afterwords I traded my panties in for some boxers] and then came back and cooked up a killer stir fry.  End of the weekend.

Well, I hope that all of you are happy and healthy.  See you all next time.

"event","well, suffice it to say, things are not the most exciting they have ever been around mount pleasant.  in fact, with the obvious exception of the time i spend with kassidy weekdays are a total bore and are starting to get on my nerves.  basically if i'm not in class or working out i'm reading and doing homework.  blah (at best).  so pretty much, its not to hard to figure out why i have a general lack of enthusiasm come sunday evening because i know that monday morning comes around with a vengance.  

however, the weekends are pretty nice!  in fact, i've actually done some catching up on movies, but more importantly spending some quality time with kassidy.  saw identity on friday night, and that was pretty cool.  weird movie, and it was really good, but the ending was sort of cheesy.  oh well.  saturday kassidy and i went and saw cellular and that was really good.  jason statham is still a favorite even though he took on the bad guy role this time...and i tell ya, i'd be scared of him too.  lastly, saw twisted last night too.  again, pretty weird, and man does ashley judd make some bad calls in that movie between all the alcohol and random hookups.  but a good movie anyhow.

well, that is all for this installment, i hope you all are having a wonderful weekend.  oh - and might i also add SCREW YOU NOTRE DAME!!!

"event","well boys and girls...and all of those who fit nicely in between - welcome to the least sexy place on the internet.  that's right - my subprofile.  basically, the purpose of this posting is nonexistent.  i was really bored, read armand's post, and decided to do one of my own.  

the first week of classes was not exactly as bad as i had anticipated, so i guess that is a refreshing start to the semester.  the only problem is that i will have lots of homework, and i will likely be doing it on a very daily basis because otherwise i will never get it all done.  this makes me want to vomit.  also, there will be lots of group work.  more vomit.  lastly, i got stuck with people in both group classes with people who i would love to smack in the face, and then smile at them.  as harsh as that souded, i really don't hate these people, i simply despise them and everything about them.  the annoying girl in my group in one clas isn't so terribly bad, because even though she is possibly the dumbest person i've ever met, she is at least friendly.  the guy in my group is another story completely, though.  basically his vocabulary is limited to about 25 words, none of which exceed 2 syllables.  and it does bother me that he cannot complete a sentence without saying 'fuck' at least twice.  

other than this things are going pretty well around CMU.  it is so incredibly nice to finally be able to see Kassidy on a regular basis again.  being able to see her each day makes me wonder just how we did it over the summer, but i know that lots of phone calls, plenty of will power, and the development of some powerful forearms have a lot to do with it.

well, that is all for today.  i'm not sure when i'll post again, so i'll see ya when i see ya!

Ok, so I know that my readership is probably not very big for my livejournal, but hey, no biggie...basically this has just been something for me to do when I am bored.  Considering that this is largely a project that originated out of boredom, it is kind of funny that I didn't do any updating on this all summer long...weird.

Anyhow - the summer was ok, and I suppose it could have been better, but it could have been much worse too.  I did a ton of work for the Chamber, and it was an unpaid internship, so that was not cool, but they want to hire me when I graduate, so that is pretty stellar.  Also, I was able to spend quite a bit of time with my lovely girlfriend despite all the miles in between us this summer.

Now I'm back up at school, though, and I am no longer an RA!  For the first time in my college career I am going to just be a student - no more crazy committments all the time and people needing me to do all types of crazy things for them at like 2am on a Tuesday night.  It should be interesting!

Well, I hope that everybody else had a great summer, and I'm looking forward to seeing some friendly faces back up at Central this year!

well, i can't really claim that there has been a terrible ammount of excitement in my life lately, but hey, what can you do?  i've pretty much been working like a fiend this summer, trying to get my 480 hours in as quickly as possible so that i can actually stand a chance of working for about a week and a half so that i'm not completely broke by the time i go up to school.  but in all honesty, i doubt that week and a half will really do that much good.  

basically the long and short of my summer is this - i've been working about 45 hours a week, and not getting paid, but still liking my internship for the most part.  aside from work, i have been visiting kassidy whenever i possibly can, unless, of course, she is coming here. this even includes going to her house on a thursday night and waking up at 4am to get to work on time, just because it meant that i was able to be with her for like 3 or 4 hours on that thursday.  but man was that an awesome few hours!  

well, that is pretty much it.  i am really looking forward to the first weekend in july, because it is going to be a really fun weekend.  my birthday is the 2nd, kassidy's is the 3rd, and the 4th is a big party at my house.  all of that and kassidy is taking a 4 day weekend, so she will be able to chill with me for the whole weekend!  so that's really cool, and i'm totally excited about that!  however, for as much as i am looking forward to that weekend, i am also looking forward to august...somewhere around the 13th, because that will mean that kassidy and i are going to actually be living in the same city again for a few months!  well, kids, i hope you've been having fun this summer, and i'll see you all later!

on a much more positive note, though, i am looking forward to this evening more than any other night this entire semeseter.  the reason - a fancy date with kassidy!  i can hardly wait for about 5:30 to roll around so i can go and pick her up and let the evening begin!  well, i'm outta here...gotta get ready to take my last final of the semester.  hope i don't do too terrible.

i went to chicago with kassidy on april 17th.  it was a blast!  we had a ton of fun, and i really didn't want to leave, but alass, we had to come back to school and continue to learn.  bummer.  since then, i have largely been working on getting done with this semester without going crazy (going fairly well) coordinating with paul and pat for next year's apartment (going pretty well) and hanging out with kassidy as much as possible (going really well) since i am mentally preparing myself to be without her over the summer (failing miserably).

so that is pretty much what's been going on with me lately.

this weekend was pretty quiet.  i was up at school for the long easter weekend, and it was pretty nice to not have class or work on friday.  in fact...it felt pretty darn good.  despite not having class, though, i did wake up kind of early and i quick ran kassidy over to whitman (and i just spelled that wrong) to bring her project to her prof's office, then i very likely ate some food and did some things in my room like cleaning the bathroom since it needed it very badly.  then kassidy and i began the weekend of chilling!

the remainder of friday was spent with kassidy and i chillin' like mad, renting a dvd that she hated, and doing some more hanging out until she was done being on duty.

saturday was actually very similar to friday, with the exception of me not waking up early, or really going much of anywhere except to get food.  since it was my turn to be on duty saturday night, kassidy and i hung out in the 303, watched a terrible movie, and called it a night.

sunday came and it was easter, so of course, well...i've got nothing.  i went to church and got my worship on, then came back and did some homework.  kassidy and i then went to get some food, more homework, doozie's run, more homework, group meeting, bulletin boards, and then a little more chill time before bed.

well, i certainly hope that the events of your weekend were as good as mine, because i enjoyed myself a lot being here.

have a lovely day and a pleasant tomorrow

"event","ok, so this whole updating on a relatively frequent basis really doesn't seem to work too well for me, but anyhow, here's what's been happening in the life of...well...me.

this week was pretty standard.  i did the class thing, lots of homework, typing of papers, meetings, and the like.  however, there has been a bit of extra excitement in my life the last week or so.

first, it was nice for the weather to finally be appropriate for me to go disc golfing. that was pretty freakin' exciting, mostly because i actually did pretty well!  a couple of birds and several pars later, i was happy to be back on the disc golf course.

also, i was able to play in my first (and likely only) merrill baseball league game.  i had a pretty solid performance at the plate, only striking out once.  i was disappointed that i didn't have an opportunity to make a play on defense, but i can't will the ball to come to me.

lastly, but most definitely not least, i got to spend plenty of time chillin' with kassidy!  this weekend was for sure a thursday, friday, saturday gino/kassidy hangout type of weekend, which made me happy.  it was even ok that i spent one evening helping kassidy with her CAD project.  its all good, though, since it looks awesome, and i don't want to take too much credit, because all i did was cut some foam forms for her, so all the artistic stuff was done by her.

that is pretty much everything worthy of note of the week, i think.  so yeah...everybody have a good day!

"event","well, another exciting weekend is in the books for me.  wondering how it went?  no? too bad, because i'm gonna tell you anyhow.

thursday was pretty normal by all standards, really.  during the day it was business as usual, and then i was on duty and did some major chillin' with kassidy.  we rented a thriller movie (my favorite) called cold creek manor.  it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  i was basically only interested since stephen dorf (blade) was in it, and he was pretty damn good in the movie.  after that, i introduced kassidy to the first half of desperado, until she began to fall asleep.  apparently she doesn't quite possess my movie watching stamina!

friday was kinda ho-hum during the day due to class and work.  but things started to pick up around 5 when kassidy and i went to grab a bite to eat.  we did some chillin', a little bit of laundry, and watched the end of desperado.  end of friday night.

saturday was actually pretty fun.  i ran some errands, once again accompanied by my trusty sidekick kassidy, to the bank, detroit donuts, oil change, staples, her printer, back to staples, then back to her printer.  fun times.  went ahead and was productive for a couple of hours doing some homework and the like, and then got some dinner before heading over to the fashion show in warriner at 7.  it was surprisingly entertaining, and really well done, so it really wasn't that bad, and i had a pretty good time, myself.  afterwords, we met up with a couple of her friends at pizza hut, chilled for like 10 minutes, and decided we were bored and wanted to do something, so what did we do???  go see a thriller movie, of course!  our pick of the evening happened to be taking lives.  it really wasn't that bad, but it was a bit disturbing, and of course, parts were a touch gorey, just like i like them.  i did feel kind of like a fool, though, since during a kind of 'boo' scary part, i may have jumped in my seat and uttered something like 'oh Jesus.'  not good for business, especially since kassidy did hear me.

so needless to say, i am really looking forward to working out or something like that this week, so i can actually start feeling like a man again.  oh well, i'm sure i'll live despite this more than somewhat embarassing occurance that i'm sure will be repeated as soon as kassidy can convince me to watch another movie like that with her.

that's all for now, boys and girls,

"event","well, today has been a pretty crazy day.  lots of walking back and forth from merrill to grawn, and vice versa.  i'm still not a big fan of class, or waking up at the buttcrack of dawn to work in academic advising, but hey, its all good.  life is treating me well, so i can't complain.  today was pretty exciting because even though i didn't have any classes with her, i still managed to run into the one and only kassidy not once, but twice today.  it made me smile.  so that's cool.  also, when i was in my room waiting for my one on one i got kidna bored, so i stole one of armand's ideas.  i put my playlist on random to see what the next 10 songs would come up as.  results are as follows...

1.  Phish - Lizards
2.  Jimi Hendrix - Have you ever been to electric lady land
3.  Dave Matthews Band - So Much To Say (live in chicago version)
4.  Joe Cocker - You Can Leave Your Hat On
5.  Robert W. Smith - The Odyssey (best classical song ever!)
6.  Clapton, Santana & Hendrix - After Midnight
7.  Sean Paul - Shake It
8.  Cake - Sad Songs And Waltzes
9.  Rockapell - Swing Low Sweet Chariot
10. Robert Randolph - Ted's Jam

for the record, song 11 was the bagpipes version of amazing grace...man do i wanna play some football right now.  anyhow, i'm glad to see that the only reall embarassing songs on there are 7 and 8.  so that's cool.  anyhow - i'm off to my one-on-one now, then another meeting, dinner with the coolest girl in the world (kassidy, in case you hadn't guessed), then renting a movie and chillin' with kassidy for the evening while i'm on duty.  sounds like fun to me.

so apparently life has not been very exciting for me lately.  i've not had a whole lot to update the journal with, but that which i have will now be passed on to you, the reader, specifically for your amusement.

so, seeing as most people don't want to hear about the major boring daily stuff i do, like attending class, working, being bored, and sleeping, i'll forego all of that and just give you the really exciting stuff...this should be short.

on monday i was eating some lunch with kassidy in the robinson dining commons during our break between classes.  this is nothing unusual, nor was the fact that the food all sucked, so i was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  however, while i was waiting for my bread to come out of the toaster, i noticed that only one piece came out.  i looked in the back, and it appeared as though the second piece was stuck.  in an attempt to dislodge the second piece, i threw the first piece at it.  this accomplished nothing other than mangling piece number one.  as a result, i decided to get a new piece of bread, and make 2 half sandwiches, one with toast, one with bread (this is riveting i know, but i swear it gets better).  however, as i was making these halfwiches, i noticed that the toaster was smoking quite badly.  odd, i thought, but then again, my bread was still in there somewhere.  upon closer examination, though, kassidy and i realized that my bread was not actually stuck, but was completely under the conveyor belt and was being run directly on the heating apparatus and was, in fact, flaming.  i laughed really hard for starting a fire in the dining commons.  unfortunately, robinson did not burn down.

the other exciting news for the day is that my car is back!  it looks magnificent too.  brand new bumper, wonderfully painted, new taillight cover, and man does that paint match well!  not only that, but then totally washed and detailed my car inside and out.  what a good group of guys.

well, that is all for now.  hope you are all having a wonderful day.

"event","wow, so i haven't been here to update the livejournal in a very long time.  i would say i'm sorry, but really, there are probably only 2 of you who read this anyhow, one of whom totally mocked the entire purpose for which i use this journal in his last post anyhow...

anyways, life has not been terribly exciting lately, but here is the update.  spring break was basically what i had expected it to be......boring.  for the most part, i just stuck around my house.  i tried to get some work done on the computer, and i worked out.  other than that, i didn't really do a whole lot more over spring break.  the only excitement i got was on the 2 saturdays of break, and the sundays that followed.  the first weekend of break, i was able to hang out with kassidy, so that was awesome, but it was only for a day, so that made me sad.  we went over to summerset mall and pretended for a while that we could afford to be there and went into all kinds of shops and looked at stuff we wanted to buy but didn't have the money to do.  great fun.  after a while we pretty much just reserved ourselves to sitting and peoplewatching until our table was ready at PF Changs.  good stuff.  then on sunday, kassidy and i woke up at 2:45 am so that i could drive her over to her dad's house to pick up some meds for her grandma, and be over at the airport by 5:15 am to catch her flight to florida.  that was really fun.  insert boring week here.  after the week was over, i went to see dominic play a pretty darn exciting RARA basketball game on saturday morning.  immediately following i headed down to good old Trenton MI to pick up Kassidy, fresh back from FLA.  we kinda hung around there for a while, got to see a little bit of where she used to live, and then headed back up to good old rochester.  the parental units ended up taking us out to dinner at Kruse and Muir's so that was hella cool, and then we went to check out Secret Window...great flick.  sunday was an official sleep-in day, and then we headed over to grandma and granpa conti's for a dinner large enough to feed the 3rd infantry.  after dinner, back to school, then impending doom...or just not liking classes.

well, that really is all.  i hope you enjoyed the livejournal update for this session.  and just for eryk....

this morning i woke up.  i was kind of groggy, so i put on my glasses.  then i walked into the bathroom.  my glasses weren't helping me see too well, so i put in my contacts.  also, i thought my breath must smell kinda bad, so i went ahead and brushed my teeth.  then i did my hair and got dressed.  i really didn't know what to wear, though, so i debated between 2 of my polo shirts.  i ended up picking the blue one.  yay for blue.  ok, i can't even tolerate this any longer.........i'm done for real now.

"event","ok - so it has been a phenominally long time since i last updated my livejournal.  basically, i have been really busy, and have not done too much exciting stuff worthy of an update, however, i will give a quick synopsis of the week just for kicks.

starting with last weekend, i went home.  it was nice to be there, saw the fam, chilled with my canadian friend conan, got some good food.  kassidy is awesome :)

got back to school and the week was kinda rough.  i had plenty of school work and meetings to keep me occupied and rather busy.  the week was pretty much normal, though.  lots of class, homework, visited the girl when i could, and that's about it.  however, the week did get exciting, but in a very bad way on wednesday.

after my 5:00 dining commons date with kassidy, we decided that dairy queen sounded good.  i parked my car at exactly 6:00.  i went over to kassidy's to chill for a bit before a program i was helping with at 8:00.  on my way back, one of my fellow RAs, jon barra stopped me to deliver some really bad news.  somebody hit my car while it was sitting in the lot.  and this was no simple bump.  they hit my car hard.  busted up the rear bumper really badly, broke a taillight cover, and put a little wrinkle in my fender.  bummer.

the positive side is that AAA is awesome and i'm not paying a penny for the repairs.  the only thing i am still pissed about is that it was a hit and run, and whoever hit me didn't have the decency to leave contact info.  oh well, my car is getting fixed for free.  i'm happy about that.

anyhow - spring break is around the corner, so i'm looking forward to a day or so in rochester with kassidy!

hope you all are doing well...that's it for now!

"event","well, here it is, near the end of the week, so i figure it must be time to update the livejornal.

the rest of monday was kind of disappointing from the class standpoint.  i went to my afternoon class and was really upset about my test grade.  you know that it is bad news when you felt awful after leaving the test, and the professor says he is really disappointed in the class's performance.  basically, i was pissed about my grade, and it only made me feel marginally better that the high grade for the class was a 76...not good for business.

tuesday was pretty ho-hum.  i had a test in my morning class, which actually went pretty well, i think.  i guess i will just have to wait and see, but i felt pretty good about it, and the essays at the end did not seem too bad.  hopefully my professor liked my answers.  my afternoon was pretty standard - class, workout, staff dinner, chill with kassidy, meetings all night long, and then over to see kassidy again.  big news for tuesday night is that the next merrill staff poker night has been set, and i will seek retribution on the ass of ryan phillips!

wednesday was pretty much just like any other wednesday, with the exception of it being totally different.  i took my usual morning walk to class with kassidy, we took our quiz, got some lunch, and then i was back in the saddle for more classes in the afternoon.  came back for a little dinner at 5 with kassidy, then we made a 7-11 run because, well...just because.  important note about wednesday - clogs were in full effect, this means that there will be very little actual shoe wearing taking place from now until next winter!  anyhow - my program was a success and it seemed to go over pretty well.  so that's cool.  i did bunches of homework afterwords, and then went over to chill with a very drowsy kassidy for a few minutes.

seeing as it is only 9am on thursday, and i've only been up for an hour and a half, nothing has really happened.  updates will be forthcoming as events require.

"event","hello all!

once again i am doing my update from work because i am bored to tears and my homework just does not seem to be holding my attention very well (anybody surprised?).  so basically here is the deal on how my weekend went - i hope you are firmly planted to your seat, because this is simply rivetting...

it all started on a quiet friday afternoon, when kassidy and i went to dinner.  then, out of nowhere...i saw pat tucker in the dining commons.  amazing, i know - i could hardly believe it, myself.  from there, kassidy and i just kinda chilled for a bit, then i went off to be productive for a little bit.  and by being productive, i mean working out and then showering.  after this, it was time to be truly productive, so i headed over to kassidy's with 2 dvd's in hand, and proceeded to call it a movie night over in sweeney.  we had fun.

then came saturday.  kassidy and i left mt. pleasant.  i know that they give you the whole seat, but you're only using the edge right now because this is so exciting...you heard me right, we actually left the city.  we drove over to the midland mall, because it is a shopping mecca and a thing of absolute splendor unmatched by any other shopping center i've ever witnessed.  well, at least it's better than the walmart we have here.  anyhow - after about an hour and a half or so, we got really bored there, and came back to good old CMU.  we grabbed a bite to eat shortly after our return, then kinda chilled for the rest of the evening by watching another 2 dvd's to complete the duty weekend for our sworn protector of sweeney hall.

sunday was pretty chill all the way around.  i slept in massively, which felt really good.  after going to a rather late brunch, i aided kassidy in a little studying for her religion test, did a little bit of chillin', then i finally got showered and dressed for my day at about 4.  wow, i'm awesome.  grabbed some little caesar's to stop my stomach from screaming at me, and then got my praise on at the evening service of young church.  after this, i hit the books with a vengance, and took notes on about 2 pages of marketing.  i hate not having an attention span.  after this futile attempt at doing my own work, i ran through some more of kassidy's religion stuff and called it a night.

monday is still in progress, and i'm at work.  also, it is snowing.  this makes me mad.  i hate snow.  i thought it was actually going away since the temperature was rising all last week and it was actually raining a bit and stuff to melt it.  now it is snowing more.  anyhow, i am bored, which is why i am updating my journal right now...

i'm still just sitting here updating the journal.

ok i'm done

"event","well, once again i have neglected to update the livejournal since monday, so here is the week in review!

monday night was pretty fun, as i ended up fairing pretty darn well in the first ever merrill staff poker night!  it was the first time i had ever played texas hold 'em, or any type of poker for that matter, but i ended up taking second for the night!  so that's pretty cool...but i'm looking for a first place finish in our next installment!

tuesday was pretty much a regular tuesday, except for the fact that my evening was made much better due to a lack of staff meeting!  it was pretty cool since i had other stuff i would much rather have been doing, so i was happy to hear we didn't haev a meeting to attend to.

wednesday, i honestly don't really remember much of what happened.  however, going on past experience, i can safely say that my day consisted of a walk to class at 10:40 with kassidy and steve, lunch with kassidy back in merrill, more class, lifted weights, ate dinner, and then proceeded to get my chill on due to my lack of homework.  yeah, sounds like a pretty normal day for me!

thursday was an interesting day.  i headed off to my first class of the day, and was then joined by kassidy for some lunch, which usually does not happen on thursdays, so i was very happy to have the company.  it was crazy, though, since i usually don't run into many people in the DUFC of the UC, but yesterday was the clear exception to the rule.  in the 30 to 40 minutes that kassidy and i were eating, i ran into/saw/talked with about 7 people i knew.  craziness.  after that i went ahead and attended my last class of the day, only to discover that i missed 'super student' status on my test by 2 percentage points, which is only a mild bummer since i didn't really work too hard on studying for it anyhow.  so i'm pretty happy with an 88 on that test.  came back from class, lifted hard so i could eat pizza later and not feel bad about it, then grabbed a little snack in the dining commons with kassidy, paul glahn, and had a special guest appearance of pat tucker!  after that i pretty much chilled out for the evening until 10:30 when it was time to meet up with kassidy, angie, and derek to get some cabin pizza!  after one trip out, and two full bellies, kassidy and i chilled and watched......er.......i watched and she slept through the count of monte cristo.  end of night.

friday, although still in progress, i went ahead and took my 10:40 walk to class with kassidy, came back for some lunch, and now i'm updating the journal.

hope you all enjoyed the update, more will be forthcoming as i see fit to update on the events of my life that should provide moderate enough levels of amusment to warrant people actually wanting to read about them.

"event","once again, hello and welcome to the land that is my livejournal.  now lets have that update from the last time that i posted...

friday was a pretty mellow day, by all standards.  after work, kassidy and i ran out to taco bell to grab some dinner, and then headed over to the good old family video to rent the particularly amazing movie 'confidence.'  went back to her place and watched the movie and then hung out watching some more stuff on tv while angie's friends and sister used about enough aresol hairspray to put another hole in the ozone.  after the taco bell, nerds rope, and hairspray, my long-haired compatriot, kassidy was not feeling so well, so i had to be her moral support to down some pepto bismol.  good work, kassidy, i knew you could do it.

pressing on to saturday, now.  valentine's day 2004, and i managed to keep it kinda low-key.  i apologize to all of you who were looking forward to another grand tale of how totally outrageous my evening was because i spent mondo dollars to have a good time.  but i didn't...spend lots of money, that is.  a good time was still had by all, though.  i went over to mountain town with kassidy and then saw the movie along came polly at the wonderful celebration cinemas.  so, are you for scuba?  anyhow - after that pretty much just headed back to my place and got our mad chill on.  damn we're cool.

sunday was another low-key day for the most part.  i slept in a bit, got all showered and ready for my day by noon and pretty much just sat around.  i was a little productive in the morning, but only a little bit since i really didn't have too much to do.  then around 2, the yale contis showed up at merrill with special gues dan griesbaum.  then, the yales, gries, myself and kassidy decided to invade bennigan's and we were there for a good couple of hours.  after a huge meal, did some chillin' with kassidy until it was time for a little dessert run over to the malt shop for a milkshake.

monday is still in progress, but its pretty much your run-of-the-mill monday for me.  got up uber early to go and work, then walked over to class at 10:40 only to discover that my test of doom wasn't quite that, since i did get a B-.  had some lunch with the one and only kassidy, then off to logistics to get manhandled by my test in that class.  and now i sit, updating my livejournal for your amusement until i have to attend my next class.  hope you all had a wonderful weekend, and that things are going well in your neck of the woods.

"event","well, it really has been quite the week for me, so here is a bit of an update...

most of the week was pretty routine.  lots of staying up late to do various things such as hang out with kassidy, do homework, staff meetings and the like.  then, last night was the marathon of studying for the marketing test of impending doom!  i am relatively proud of the ammount of time i was able to put into studying, since i do find it rather hard to concentrate on academics.  i actually had my nose in a book from 6 until about 11:30.  amazing.

i got up early this morning to get some fuel before the big test, and then took the walk over to grawn.  the wind was rather daunting, but honestly, it didn't worry me nearly as much as the test i had to take.  to my surprise, though, the test really wasn't as bad as i had cracked it up to be.  so hopefully next week i will be getting back a good grade, either that or ignorance is bliss and i failed.  but we'll just have to keep a good thought and hope i did well.

well, that is about all for this update, so i hope you all have a wonderful weekend and i'll see you all later.

unfortunately there really isn't a whole lot that has changed since saturday night, but i suppose sunday was eventful enough to warrant a post.  i actually slept in, so that was pretty cool.  once i did actually get up, i went to brunch with kassidy and lacey over in the towers, then came back to my place to attempt to be productive and to get ready to meet kassidy's mom and step-dad.  we all went over to bennigan's for dinner, which was good, and i think that i did fairly well fielding the semi-barrage of questions served up by her mother.  hopefully i didn't stick my foot in my mouth too many times...

after dinner, i pretty much just came back and chilled for a bit until i went over to sweeney to collect kassidy for the evening.  we did some serious hangin' out - which reminds me, i need to go shopping now - and then it was time to get some sleep.  so that pretty much brings us up to speed on the world of me!

"event","it has been brought to my attention that i have neglected to update the livejournal for a few days, so here's the deal, yo.

monday:
worked in the morning and was actually quite late, but it was cool since doug likes me.  i walked to class with kassidy at 10:40, then chilled, had some lunch, finished off my classes and came back for 5 o'clock dinner.  after dinner i did some hangin' with kassidy, then off to sleep for tuesday.

tuesday:
work again, not too much fun because i just added this 8am shift to my repitoire this week.  anyhow, i got all of my homework done during this shift, so thigs were good as far as i am concerned.  went to my classes, ended up accidentally skipping a class in the afternoon due to some bad information from my professor and came back for dinner at 5.  after dinner, did some serious chillin' with an individual of the kassidy persuasion, who still thinks she legitimately beat me in wrestling (it isn't losing if you want to), and eventually made my way to sleep.

wednesday:
very similar to monday, only i didn't work in the morning.  also, i walked back to the quad for lunch with kassidy since she had her one-on-one.  walked back to grawn for my afternoon classes, back to merrill for 5 o'clock dinner, then did some work and chilled with kassidy.  sleep.

thursday:
unenthsiastically went to work in the morning, but hey, its a living, right?  classes were decent, but not exciting.  came back to merrill for some mad gamecube action with paul glahn, dave and munger.  went to dinner at 5 as always, then commenced the gino and kassidy chill time.  we did some studying for our marketing quiz while she was working study hall, then celebrated our efforts with a trip to bennigan's for desert.

friday:
walked to class @ 10:40 with kassidy for our dreaded quiz, then walked back with her afterwords.  grabbed a bite to eat for lunch, then i headed to work for the afternoon.  i was visited by kassidy and family as her sister was being dropped off for siblings weekend.  we went to dinner at 5 and i was rejoined by kassidy and her sister later in the evening for a viewing of SWAT.

saturday:
got up for breakfast with kassidy, lacey (her sister), and angie.  breakfast wasn't great, but i enjoyed the company.  i trekked back to merrill to do some lifting, and then showered and got ready for some dinner.  ordered mancino's with kassidy and lacey and then we kinda chilled for a bit.  we took a walk over to kaya for some hot chocolate, then came back to merrill to watch the italian job and pirates of the carribean.  end of night.  sleep.

ok - sorry that took so long, but it was a full week of news.  i hope you are all as wonderful as i left you, and i'll seeya on the flipside.

after dinner at good old bennigan's, i went ahead and began workin' on my necklace and ended up finishing it off all in one sitting.  paul came by to visit momentarily and he drove up in his sweet, brand new, well, new....er....new to him ride!  its a killer dodge sundance...that's right, baby - look out now.  anyhow - he came on by with heather and borrowed desperado and then proceeded to attempt to light his apartment on fire doing some authentic chinese cooking.  to be honest, i don't even really know what exactly i did from the time paul left until about 9, so it must have been relatively low key, but i think i was pretty much just chatting online.  anyhow, at about 10 in the evening, made a 7-11 run and, as promised, finished watching rounders with kassidy and then chilled for the rest of her duty shift with her and angie, and a very groggy derek kaiser.

then it was SUPERBOWL SUNDAY!!!  unfortunately the better part of the day was spent doing work, but its all good, since it allowed me to actually sit and watch the game.  i actually was quite productive, getting my bulletin boards, reports, intent stuff and some homework done [yawn].  after all that fun and excitement of work, paul came on by and we grabbed a bite to eat, then came back to watch the game.  it was kinda cool to have a couple people to watch the game since paul stayed for a while, then kassidy swung by for just about enough time for me to make her a necklace while watching the game.  watched the rest of the game, was disappointed carolina lost, but way to go tom brady - still making u of m fans proud.  went to sleep, woke up late for work, and now i'm here.  well, see you all later,

"event","well, the kidnapping went well last night.  kassidy and angie took me prisoner (along with three high quality movies of mine) for the evening and we pretty much chilled, and discussed how much of a nerd i am.  so that was pretty awesome.  we ended up getting through all of se7en, boondock saints, and half of rounders.

on to today.  i actually slept...pretty well i might add, so i was feeling quite well-rested and ready for the day.  went over and ate some brunch with the one and only brandon wulf and met up with a few of his towers people (the most notable of which being his girlfiend, megan).  afterwords i met some guy named alex who had torn his meniscus in his knee and was trying to find a ride to whitman, and since i wasn't doing anything, i figured i'd do him the favor.  since i was already out i figured i would head over to ethnic creations and get some hemp for a bit of new jewelry and made an anklet.  

after i finished this up i finally got fully ready for the day and went for a dinner run at bennigan's with kassidy, and that pretty much brings me up to the moment.

see you all next time!

"event","to be totally honest, yesterday was pretty awesome.  i got up and was relatively bored at work, but to be realistic, i wasn't expecting excitement.  my morning shifts basically provide me an opportunity to wake up and get ready for my classes.  class was actually pretty cool on thursday too.  but really, who gives a rip about class?  because i know i don't.

biggest news of the day is that the conti brothers tattoo is all but done!  we finally have a design, know where we want to get it, all that good stuff...i'm pumped, a lot.  so basically i'm really excited about that and can't wait for spring break now so i can go and get some ink with armand!  anyways, after that was decided i kinda hung around the room a bit with paul and did a little halo action.

the evening was pretty fun, too, though - and there was really no lack of excitement for a change...went over to sarah's for a bit and watched some tv with her - it was good to see ya, buddy ;)  then the night got really interesting when i started talking to the one and only kassidy who apparenly had just about enough caffine to keep a horse awake for a month and was in, well, a rather chipper mood.  after several threats of a whitewash the next time i set foot outside my room, we decided that we were both hungry and that lil chef sounded good.  only one problem...the mustang was snowed in.  so, after a futile hour of trying to get my car out of the spot, kassidy and i made the trudge to the chief in the snow.  after our 2am breakfast we nearly froze to death on the way home, but it was all good...besides, it was 3am on the dot when we got back class didn't start until 11 this morning.  rock.

so now that i've lived through class today, i'm back at work and i'll be here until 5.  then its gonna off to dragon (even though some people think their food is awful) and then mentally preparing myself to be kidnapped at 7:30 or so.

"event","wow its too early for me, it was definitely another short night.  i'm not quite sure why it is, but i decide to do all sorts of things for other people that require me staying up really late, and then not getting to sleep when i really want to...but i digress

anyhow, it is shaping up to be another unexciting day at work today.  doug is not even in the office until about 1:00, so me being here at 8:00 seems like something of a formality.  oh well, at least i'm getting paid to sit here playing computer games for my 3 hours.  at any rate, we'll just have to see where the day goes.

as for yesterday, it was, by all standards a pretty darn good day.  after the 8am gino workout, i headed through the blistering cold to class and grabbed some lunch over in robinson with kassidy, and while i was there i found justin, who looked so sick i thought he might actually fall over into his salad.  that would have sucked.  after lunch, i finished off my classes for the day, grabbed a bite to eat where i was warned by angie and kassidy that i was going to be kidnapped this weekend...maybe its just me, but i thought the element of surprise was pretty important in a kidnapping...after dinner, i finished up the black and white of my design of the merrill logo and started to work on adding some color to it.  went to study hall and ended up having quite a good time since i actually had people down there with me the entire time!  it was amazing since brandon said he'd only stay for a little bit, but once we had a guest appearance from chase he stayed a bit longer, and by the time angie came down, he was pretty much there till the end.  it was a party in the dining commons.

that is all for now, so i'll see you crazy kids all later..."

"event","well, it has been a couple of days since my last post...or at least a while anyhow.  then again, life really has not been all that exciting.  basically, after an uneventful (at best) weekend, monday rolled around and it was back to the grind.  work was horribly boring, and i was ready to go to sleep by the time i needed to leave for class.  walking to class has been fun, exciting and nuerotic lately, seeing as we are pretty well coated with snow, and CMU doesn't like to pay people to remove it.  therefore trudging to class really is quite an experience.  basically your only hope is that enough people went to class before you to pack down an acceptable path for you to walk on.  but anyhow, in a nutshell that was monday...in case i didn't already write something about it.

tuesday was not much more exciting, to be honest.  class was pretty decent, but the evening was rather lackluster.  it pretty much consisted of meeting after meeting.  the only real excitement of the day was eating at los palomitos...which caused a little more excitement a couple hours later...

i did, however, witness something rather funny on tuesday on my way back from class that i would like to relay to all of you out in livejournalland.  once i was about 2/3 of the way back from class, i heard people behind me muttering things such as, 'hey' or 'watch it'.  i glanced back to see that it was the president of our university pushing and bumping his way through the crowd of students walking back from class.  i thought it was kind of inappropriate, but hey, what can a guy do?  anyhow, he kept breezing past people and nearly knocked me into the snow on his way past.  i felt like really telling him how i felt, but settle for an 'excuse you!'  despite my inability to tell him off, he got told...about 20 feet in front of me he hit a patch of ice, did some maneuvers straight out of riverdance and the nutcracker...then crashed to the ground.  i laughed - and so did everybody else that saw.

well, that is all for today, it is almost time for me to be heading to another day of classes.  see you all next time!

"event","basically, this weekend was crappy.  i had nothing to do all weekend.  most people went home, so it was pretty quiet around merrill hall, but i still had one roommate and some neighbors, right?  wrong.  basically, i just sat in my room all night on friday and kept trying to think of things to do, but most people around here were at caberfae skiing until late, and everybody else was gone or already busy.  oh well, saturday was to be another night...

yeah, saturday did not turn out to be much more interesting.  i went to breakfast/lunch with justin at about noon, then came back to the room and got some things straightened out.  finally got the replacement parts for my broken razor, so i got a nice clean shave...then proceeded to sit in my room for the rest of the day since everybody i would have hung out with went out to party.  at least brandon stopped by for a few minutes to play some xbox and watch a little tv, but that was about all the excitement this evening had to offer.  so that's about it...

this is me signing off for the evening...see you all later

"event","well, today was a pretty normal day by all standards, but at this point, normal is an improvement compared to depressing and dull.  the day didn't quite start the way i wanted it to, though, since i couldn't sleep again last night, so i slept through my alarm.  this would have made me upset, but i didn't really miss anything.  the only thing this meant to me was that instead of working out at 8am, i would have to work out at 5pm.  no harm done, really.  anyhow, i went to class and presented my group's marketing project about the condoms to the class...and they loved it.  i think our tagline for the Dr. Shagwell's condoms really won them over.  i mean, how can you beat ""your prescription for pleasure?""  for my money, i don't think it gets any better than that.

after class, i kassidy and i took the all indoor route back to the quad to avoid the elements...and because kassidy really hates the cold.  once we got back to the quad i bumped into the one and only adam wall.  we took a little bit of time to catch up, but unfortunately he was just getting out of work and had some things to do, so i had to be on my way.  i stopped in on lizandro for a bit in his office, we talked, it was fun.  then i went to work, which was possibly the most boring 3 hours of my life.  doug did not have any appointments scheduled, and was out of the office for most of the time since he had to hire orientation mentors for the summer.  this made my already boring job, well, more boring.  i only have one real complaint about work, though...the song selection on the radio sucked...

after work i went and had a rather good workout.  i was pleased to have it actually feel good and for me to be getting closer to putting up the weights i think i should be.

well, this is me signing off, so i hope you all have a good day, and a pleasant tomorrow."

"event","well, once again i was terribly wrong and spoke too soon.  see, on monday, after my world absolutely came crashing down on me, i told myself just before going to bed that my day could not get any worse.  however, as i was climging into bed, i saw that it was 11:59, and as soon as i saw that, my foot slipped, i cracked my shin on my ladder, slammed my face into the ladder on the way down and rolled my bad ankle.  i don't know what it was, perhaps it was fate trying to spite me and make sure i had the worst day possible, but at any rate, fast forward to today.

i actually thought today was a decent day.  i smiled today.  i actually laughed a little bit.  for the first time in a while, i felt good about being me for a change.  i was feeling really good about the way things had gone, right up until about 11:35.  now, although this is slightly different, it is uncanny how similar the results were.  on monday, i thought it could not get worse, today, i thought it was pretty good.  unfortunately, i had to go and be an idiot, starting a conversation i shouldn't have, drugging up some hurt for both sides, and making myself wonder why i am such and idiot.  all in all, the day is now crap.  i hate today almost as much as i hate monday.

so, without any further ado, i am going to attempt to put this all behind me.  i am going to try and reserve myself to the fact that when its over, its over, and i should just be thankful that it happened at all.  who knows, it may happen again, but only time will tell.  i am going to put all of my energy into being the best damn friend i know how to be, and nothing more.  i will do this with all the fervor and zeal in my body until the very moment this effort is no longer required if i must.  it is unfortunate, because this is not my will, but it is my will for this pain to stop, even if it means doing this.

"event","for those of you who have been keeping track, our lately downtrodden hero is slowly dusting himself off to get back in the old stirrups...

all in all, today was not a bad day.  classes were actually somewhat refreshing, and at times even fun.  in fact, the entire 50 minutes of my first class was spent doing a group excercise to figure out how to market a product that was selected at random by our professor.  my group got condoms.  how ironic that i should have to market a product i have never had the occasion to use...

dinner was pretty bad today, but i had good company at the table, so the meal did not seem quite as bad.  now it is time for me to finally get a little bit of relaxing in, and watch a movie with my good buddy adam.  after this cinematic adventure, i hope to get a good night's worth of rest so that i can be productive and energetic for tomorrow.

"event","well, i officially suck.  i guess i wasn't very good at the first thing, and now the second isn't coming very easy, either.  i'm so tired of not being able to make the things in my life work well and it sucks.  why can't there be one thing that i am good at which manages also to make me happy?!  i think that my problem is my inability to know how close to let myself get.  it sucks so much because when i finally found something i liked (loved) i tried to hold that as close as i could, but i think i suffocated it in doing so.  and now i just don't know if i can loosen that grip as quickly as is needed.  i'm sorry to the one i let down, and sorry to the rest of you for being so depressed lately, but i just can't see a positive in this yet.  if there is a light at the end of this tunnel, i certainly can't see it now, and i'm wondering when or if i will.

sarah, i'm sorry, i need not elaborate, i've already said my piece to you about why.

armand, i thank you for being the patient person you are, and for having enough sense to just let me ramble and enough caring to tell me not to worry."

"event","good morning all!

so basically mornings really suck...a lot...mostly because i seem to have this problem with not being able to sleep.  i think that possibly the most frustrating thing ever is when you are laying is bed absolutely exhausted, but you just can't quite get comfortable enough to fall asleep so you just stare at the ceiling.  then once you do finally get comfy enough to fall asleep, people next door, or under you or wherever start to make a lot of noise.  this stuff really makes me happy.

actually, the worst part about not being able to sleep is that i have to get up super-early to be at work on monday mornings.  this sucks because there is usually enough work to keep me busy for 30 to 40 minutes of a 3 hour shift.  this means that by 8:45 on any given day that i work i am already bored out of my mind and can't wait for my day to be over.  kind of a crappy way to start your day.  hope you all have a good one, though, and i'll catch ya on the flipside.

"event","well, if you couldn't guess, i'm really bored.  it is now almost 6:30 and i've been doing homework (reading since a little before 4:00) with only a short break to head over to dragon express with Cory.  dragon was awesome, and i was able to witness what may have been the best hit of the post-season in the indi/new england game.  however, i am in a horribly unenthusiastic mood because i know that as soon as i am done with this post, i am going to begin reading some more.  the worst part about this is that no matter how much i really enjoy the classes i have, the reading always sucks.

i have decided that having to pay 100 dollars or more for a textbook wouldn't be so bad if it were at least fun to read, or at the worst was not boring.  i cannot even imagine how much better i would do in my classes if i didn't mind doing the reading.  this is not so say i am a poor student, because this isn't the case, but i might be approaching a 4.0 if i could actually tolerate doing all the reading.  i think that anybody can agree, even if it is not your money being spent on books, that it is a monumental waste to purchase books that cause you to enter periodic fits of rage when faced with the prospect of reading them.  perhaps even worse, though, are the assignments given by crazy professors.

take, for example, the assignment i am nearly finished with for my management class.  keep in mind this is management...the assignment was to read the first chapter in the book, which i did, but could hardly stay awake for.  after reading the entire chapter carefully, i began to work on our worksheet.  however, the entire sheet was of math problems similar to what i was doing in accounting 202 last semester.  this bothered me immensely because of the fact that the chapter i read had nothing to do with accounting.  the entire chapter was on technology and the industrial revolution!

needless to say, the afternoon has not been as exciting as i was hoping, but i was so bored with the reading and needed a study break, that posting this rant seemed to be a very appropriate thing to do.  on the positive side, i only have reading for about 3 more classes to go, and i do ""work"" for 3 hours tomorrow morning, so i am guessing that a lot of my reading will be accomplished then, if not during my 2 hour lunch break between classes tomorrow.

if you actually read this entire post, i thank you, since i am guessing that there will only be 2 or 3 people who actually do, and i will be one of them just because i am a loser and have nothing else better to do."

Basically, I really don't have a whole lot of exciting things to put in this post since it is hardly after 2:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday and I've only been up since noon.

This weekend really hasn't even been all that exciting either, seeing as about the only thing I have really done is been on duty Friday and Saturday nights, played copius ammounts of video games with Paul during that time, and talked to my brother and Sarah a lot...

Well, this is it for now, so I guess this is Gino signing off, and maybe if something truly exciting occurs soon, I shall post again to let you all know!"

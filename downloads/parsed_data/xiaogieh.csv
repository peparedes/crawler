"event","wow. reading back my entries from 2 years ago made me realize how much i've grown. ah i feel good!
haha im sure no one reads this now. teheee. the colors of this page is so weird.....ah i cant believe i chose them 2 years ago. wow i bet i was a big whiny baby back then. well i still complain a lot now. theres too much to complain about life. but it's good nonetheless.

another thing i realize i've changed in.....back then i couldnt stand doing anything i didnt like, but could do well on things i liked. now i just seem average on my enthusiasm.....doesnt really matter whether i like it or not, i do what im supposed to do to get me to where i plan to be, whether or not its some place i really want to be at. in a way, i've become more....machine-like? hah. scary what college can do to a person."

"event","hihi! came back from europe almost 1 week now~it was AWESOME. WAYYY too much fun; partying, gaming, eating, sight-seeing, friends-making, joking, plus doing stupid stuffs to make everyone in the restaurants look at us.-_- yea oh and putting on make ups for 2 guys, it was their punishment for losing the card game. other girls had to do chicken walks; all the opera singing while we were lost, ...etc. 
anyway, i stopped liking sprite, he acts too young for me, that's all i can say!
i was quite satisfied w/ my GPA, and AP scores r coming in...OMG IM SO FREAKIING NERVOUSSSSSS

"event","i dont kno wut to write. hmm my gpa for 3rd quarter is 3.82, didnt try in english so got a B+. i cant try hard anyway cuz that class makes me fall asleep. its too comfy in there, and boring, of course. im beginning to dislike my eng teacher. she's weird.
everyday now i think about:
1.ditching history to sleep in library then call in sick
2.ditching wind ensemble to sleep more or study for calc
*btw i've never even done the above ones yet
3. quit swimming
4. dream about panda and me getting into la.
5. just ditching in general"

"event","im writing LJ again not because im obsessed w/ it...but because i dont want chris to see this
i found out about something about her ""him"" but i cant tell her because it'll hurt her, and mayb she'll think im talking bad things about him, and she'll hate me. 
i feel so lonely, she didnt really ditch me, but i feel she's gone from me now
wen i was in 3~5 grade i had a best friend, shirley
one time shirley's friend broke her leg and so shirley helped her to the bathroom and everywhere all the time
so i got jealous, so i wrote a note telling her i didnt want to be her friend anymore
she was really confused, i think we both cried
i still dont like that girl who broke her leg and took shirley away
after a couple yrs, after i came to US, i asked her in email whether she was still my best friend
i dont kno why i care so much about this whole ""best friend"" thinging
anyway wen she replied she didnt mention anything about it
i didnt expect it anyway since she'd become so so popular
all these ppl surrounding her
altho i was still very disappointed

today, same thing is happening
im still the selfish, full-of-jealousy kid
i dont kno wut to do....
i hate to b the one to act all intimate and stuff
but i feel that our distance is growing larger
so if i tell her that thing about him....i'll my 2nd best friend in life
now that i say best friend....im not so sure any more
i dont feel like she sees me as important as i see her
why is it that my best friend is always 32749018375908314 times more popular than me
they hav gazillion friends

ugh im so lonelyyyyy
i want a boyfriend
but i cant have one for too many reasons
the biggest being that i've come to believe that im meant to b single for life
for my ignorance about the world evolving around me, and for my hot temper.

i really dont want to stop talking 
but im too tired....
gonna go sleep now

 no one is reading this, right?
good"

"event","sometimes i wonder...is it the differences b/w 2 persons that make them fight? or is it their similarities?
my mom and i are really different...in most of the ways....for example, i erased most of the things she wrote on the white board in our house because its suppose to remind us things of the FUTURE not like ""2/14 took dad to airport"". she can really transform a calender into her own journal. -_- so anyway i erased those ""expired"" ones and wrote on things that are coming up. and she got really mad for that. she has really weird habbits.
my dad (who works in tw) said he cud understand how hard it is for us (my bro and i) to listen to her screaming all day long, but he also keeps on telling us to listen to her and just obey. wtheck? i really dont understand."

"event","today...i learned that feelings come and go...that is... infatuations only. sometimes i forget the feeling how i loved panda. but if i ever get into his school....i hope i'll get to re-experience it. 
ok admit i want a bf. but wanting is totally different then NEEDING. i dont need one, since i kno im those type of ppl that even if im really sad and had a crappy day i wont call him and rant on him.
haha why am i updating the LJ thing anyway? cuz i update my xanga too often nowadays....i dont wanna seem like a loser who sits infront of the xanga page all day long typing about how crappy life is.-_- besides this place is more private. hmm.
maybe not?!"

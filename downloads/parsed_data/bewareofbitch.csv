"event","Picture this.. it is about 11:55am on a sunday morning.. everything is blissful and quiet... i am sleeping soundly in my nice toasty warm bed... dreaming about all manner of wonderful things (including getting a proper Marvel vs Capcom arcade machine as a present!!!!!!)

Then IT happens...

Slowly a song begins to filter down from the apartment above.. it is loud. much louder than it should be at this time of the morning, especially since i worked last night...

The strains of this song begin to build and the words begin to become clearer as my brain reluctantly is torn from sleep and wonderful dreams of minigames with Felicia and BB Hood...

I open one eye... slowly... carefully.. adjusting to the light... Then the other, equally as slowly and I finally make out the lyrics of the song... a wounded hyena plaintively bawling: ""I don't know whyyyyyyy I didnnnnnn't commmmme...""

Well needless to say, I am not happy being woken up at any time before 1:30pm on a sunday, no matter if the method of waking is by being played one of my favourite songs.. but one of my pet hates is norah jones. Can't stand the bitch. 

So I *HUMPH*ed and rolled over, pulling the covers over my head in a vain attempt to block out the evil sound and sun, but to no avail, it was not getting any softer, and the next song on the album came on.

It was WAR.

I got up and turned on my lovely purring white beast and opened up iTunes, turned my stereo on to ""Bowel Rattling Bass"" mode and started up my rap playlist.

Now this is on my brand new Sony RRP $1000 stereo. Heh. Norah hasn't a chance.

Picture me smiling as the neighbours butter their croissants while they read their papers as ""Tony, he was italian, he didn't give a fuck, that's what I liked about him. He ate my pussy from dark to the mornin, called his girl up and told her we was bonin.."" comes out my window and into their dining room

Anyways, as mentioned earlier: Beware of Bitch.

Over and Out :)"

Goodness Gracious, you're everyone's favourite do-gooder Jean Grey, also known as Phoenix. You look after your teammates, get along with everyone, have a wonderful man who loves you and have pretty much achieved perfection. But look out when you're PMSing and you become Dark Phoenix: a raging homicidal bitch with a knack for causing trouble.

tee hee! the second part is certainly on the ball.. dunno about the ""do-gooder"" bit.. and the ""get along with everyone"" bit... ah wells"

"event","<P>I hope hope <EM>so much</EM>&nbsp;that Kerry wins this election.&nbsp; This year more than any other in&nbsp;my lifetime, at least, we really need a Democrat in the White House, and I'm not just saying that 'cause I am one (at least, will be when i freakin' turn 18).&nbsp; This country is headed in the wrong direction on so many levels.&nbsp; Our economy is a huge issue.&nbsp; That's a given.&nbsp; I mean, just look at what's happened since President Bush sent forces to Iraq.&nbsp; I know 9/11 was a huge factor in the recession, but the war kept us from recovering.&nbsp; It's like pouring acid onto a healing scab, if that's not too gross.&nbsp; We basically all know what's happened there.&nbsp; I mean, all you have to do is drive and shop to know.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Bigger than anything else is the fact that our own people are out there, dying for a cause that can't be resolved with warfare.&nbsp; Don't our leaders realize that we are dealing with a new kind of kamikaze fighters, people who are willing to kill themselves as well as their own kind to secure their troubled fight?&nbsp; Invading the Middle East is not going to stop them, but instead give them yet another reason to hurt us.&nbsp; They'll fight till they die, or we do, whichever comes first.&nbsp; We need to stop it all now before we've gone any farther.&nbsp; I mean, even I'm getting to the age where I'll start seeing my own friends drafted overseas.&nbsp; (That is, if even more soldiers are needed in the years to come).&nbsp; Bush got us into this mess.&nbsp; I'm sorry, but I just don't trust him to pull us out of it.&nbsp; Plus, his ""military experience,"" if you can call it that, isn't even.&nbsp; Kerry is a Vietnam vet; he knows what an illegitimate war is about.&nbsp; We need someone with that kind of knowledge to stop the insanity.</P>
<P>'Kay, those are just two reasons why I think our country is headed in the wrong direction.&nbsp; Then of course, there are so many other reasons.&nbsp; I won't name any more.&nbsp; Haha, I've probably offended enough people already.&nbsp; I hope I haven't!! :(&nbsp; It's just politics.&nbsp; Everyone is different, everyone has their own opinion.&nbsp; This just happens to be mine.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Aaaaaalllrighty!&nbsp; Go Kerry.&nbsp; And vote, if you're old enough, no matter who you're voting for!! :)</P>"

<P>I freakin' love those sox.&nbsp; LOVE 'EM.&nbsp; Like it's crazy.&nbsp; But I think all of Red Sox Nation is a little out of their wits now, wayyy worse than probably any other World Series year cause, obviously, it's just been so much longer now.&nbsp; Like... wow.&nbsp; I just really hope they don't win the whole damn thing on Thursday night for two reasons:&nbsp; 1. I'll be at work till 10 ish and probably miss it, and 2. I REALLY WANNA WIN IT IN FENWAY!&nbsp;&nbsp; AFter allll this time, wouldn't it just be amazing if our guys did it in the good ol' trusty ballpark?&nbsp; It neeeeeeds to happen that way.&nbsp; Like, I'm even gonna freakin' pray that they win it back in Fenway.&nbsp; And if they must win the Series in St. Louis, it would be greatly appreciated if they did the deed on Wednesday, ahem.&nbsp; I can't deal with missing that.&nbsp; I think I'd seriously quit my job to see it.</P>
<P>Been wicked busy, haven't updated in forever.&nbsp; Oh yeah, made NHS.&nbsp; My GPA at the end of term 3 last year was a 3.74.&nbsp; 3.744, to be exact.&nbsp; That made me <EM>mad</EM>.&nbsp; At the end of term 4 it was alraedy a 3.8, since I killed myself with doing well that term, but it didn't matter since the NHS doesn't look again till now.&nbsp; At least I'm in it at all. But seriously, I think I got screwed a little, since I know of at least one term grade from freshman year that <EM>was</EM> legitimately off.&nbsp; I just never did anything about it because it was term 4 and a lot of crazy stuff was going on at home, I just didn't even care.&nbsp; I never thought it'd affect me that much... hah!&nbsp; Whateverrrrr.&nbsp; I look on the bright side: I didn't have to deal with going to meetings all this time.&nbsp; Eh... kinda.&nbsp; mm.</P>
<P>I've gotta go get my eyebrows waxed like hell.&nbsp; They're horrible, I haven't even tweezed them in a week.&nbsp; If I don't do that soon, I'll start to resemble Johnny Damon in a freakish kinda way.</P>

"event","<P>Yesterday was wicked fun.&nbsp; Well.. there was school of course.&nbsp; eh.&nbsp; I'm wicked mad, I can't find my French work book and my mom didn't believe that I even did it.&nbsp; She kept making fun of me during class, and stuff.&nbsp; I mean come on, if she's gonna freakin' follow me to high school, she should at least not make <EM>me</EM> look bad.&nbsp; Which comes to something else.. in a second.</P>
<P>After school I visited Stonehill with Car and Ash.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;a lot of fun.&nbsp; We got a little lost in Easton, but still got there like forty minutes early.&nbsp; Our tour guides were a little on the chirpy, smart side, but nice all the same.&nbsp; I reallly like that school, a <EM>lot.&nbsp; </EM>It'd be really fun if we all ended up going there.&nbsp; They seem like they really like it, too.&nbsp; Out of all the schools I'm applying to, Stonehill is my first choice.&nbsp; Gotta love their shovels!&nbsp; </P>
<P>On the tour was this old guy and his strange daughter.&nbsp; He kept asking the guides all these weird, pointless questions, like how long it takes to walk from the cafeteria to any one of the dorms, and stuff.&nbsp; Then he asked a whole bunch of questions about part-time students and living off campus, when he later said that his daughter wasn't doing any of that.&nbsp; God, he was annoying.&nbsp; Then he'd make all these corny jokes and laugh rrrrreally loudly after.&nbsp; Uhm, he was the only one laughing at them too.&nbsp; The three of us were like... mkay.&nbsp; ""Now, at the end of the tour, we're all gonna run really really fast at you, and you'll have to walk backwards really fast!&nbsp; AH HAH HAH HAH HAH!"" The guides were like... okay.</P>
<P>Went to the dance last night.&nbsp; It was fun, but eh.&nbsp; The music was great.&nbsp; It was the first dance I've been to that didn't blast hardcore rap the entire night.&nbsp; To be honest the only reason I actually went was cause it was the Renaissance fundraiser, and I kinda had to go.&nbsp; It's not really fun standing around and fake slowdancing with one of my girls.. even though I love you guys and all.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; but stilll... </P>
<P>going to the movies today with Jill / Julie / Becky.&nbsp; Then working at 7 to cover half a freakin' shift.&nbsp; Wickedddd cool.&nbsp; </P>"

<P>anyways</P>
<P>Yesterday night was way funner.&nbsp; Pappas, Amanda, Anna and I randomly went out to the Kingston Mall.&nbsp; We saw a person in Best Buy or whatever wearing a skirt halfway up her spine.&nbsp; That was good.&nbsp; Then the atm machine wouldn't give Pappas his $200, and he had to try like eight times.&nbsp; We stole his money momentarily after it came out of the slot.&nbsp; That was better.&nbsp; But the rest of the night was just grand.&nbsp; Anna said something at dinner about my arteries slamming shut due to the massive amount of McDonald's I was ingesting, which set Pappas off like never before.&nbsp; He turned purple and his eyes bulged, as he gasped these short high choking gasps.&nbsp; I thought he was gonna die at first, but he turned out okay, unfortunately.&nbsp; Ha ha.&nbsp; Then we went into JC Penney to ""browse,"" and of course Pappas had to buy this really expensive cologne stuff.&nbsp; But while he was paying, we noticed this little promotional display for a new scent, which incidentally smelled like apples.&nbsp; The display was a bowl filled with water, or something, with pretty little (real) apples arranged nicely in it.&nbsp; Anna dared Pappas to take a bite out of it.&nbsp; He did.&nbsp; His reaction after was priceless;&nbsp; ""Oh, this is the best apple I've ever tasted! I love this!""&nbsp; Then his face contorted into a painful grimace as he ran to spit the thing out.&nbsp; ""AAAH, it turned SOUR!!""&nbsp; No wonder.&nbsp; It was a <EM>green </EM>apple.&nbsp; sheesh.</P>
<P>hahah.&nbsp; so yeah, i have to say that this weekend wasn't bad at all.</P>"

<P>on the way home from Maine we were hit with a downfall of torrential rains... seriously, i've never seen anything that bad.&nbsp; it got so bad that we couldn't see the taillights of the car right very in front of us.&nbsp; my mom, ever so nervous, made us pull into a rest stop in Kennebunkport; incidentaly, the very same one we stopped at on our way up to our <U>first</U> trip to Maine, which got me even <EM>more</EM> melancholy - where the rain only got worse.&nbsp; The place lost power, and their manager was running around acting all worried, and talking to some other road stop manager over a cell phone.&nbsp; He mentioned the in-effect tornado warning for that very county just a liiiiitle too loudly.&nbsp; Weyellll, I of course began to freak out.&nbsp; The fact that I was already a moody, pmsing, emotional mess didn't help matters much, either.&nbsp; plus dad was still out in the car, since he didn't wanna run in through the rain and get all wet.&nbsp; ugh.&nbsp; Mom, after hearing about the funnel cloud directly above us, actually hesitated in getting dad.&nbsp; he probably didn't know about it, and i know i wouldn't wanna be outside during a tornado, but she <U>still</U> wouldn't let either me or julie go.&nbsp; (she didn't want us to get wet).&nbsp; Sooo she took her time in looking for a plastic bag to put over her head, and when she didn't find one, she went into the little gift shop to peruse through the t-shirt rack to protect her from the water.&nbsp; well by that time i was getting pretty annoyed, and just decided to go out without telling her, but at the doors&nbsp;I met (thank god) Dad.&nbsp; (on a side note, if the person I loved was in even slight danger of a tornado or anything, a little bit of water wouldn't keep me from them in an instant.&nbsp; but that's another story).&nbsp; Well needless to say there was no tornado, but I'm still a little dazed by the whole affair.&nbsp; Never thought I'd have to deal with another tornado warning, let alone in Maine of all places.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; We survived, hoorah.&nbsp;</P>

"event","<P>Oh my god, you guys!&nbsp; Be forewarned.&nbsp; I'm gonna write a LOT today.&nbsp; I just got home from a week in Maine at my cousins' house, in Caribou.&nbsp; If you don't know where that is, just look at the highest tip of the state on a map, and there you go.&nbsp; They had this awesome cabin on a lake, and they had a boat and waterskiing and really good lobster... aaah okay, I need to breathe for a second.&nbsp; Breaathe.&nbsp; Brreeeeaaathe.&nbsp;&nbsp; OK.</P>
<P>We left on Saturday morning, the four of us, in the good ol' aqua blue minivan packed tight with.. so much <EM>stuff.</EM>&nbsp; We drove and drove.&nbsp; We went north through Boston, across the North Shore, and through New Hampshire for like ten minutes (okay maybe a little longer than that) before we hit Maine.&nbsp; Gosh, those New Hampshioners sure are rude!&nbsp; You're in their state for a split second when you're trying to get from Massachusetts to Maine, and they hit you with a toll that usually is backed up at least a mile or so.&nbsp; Pfft.&nbsp; Anywhom we finally got through the damn tollbooths and Maine wasn't very far off.&nbsp; Surprise surprise, I'd never been in that state before.&nbsp; But yey, I crossed the border, and was in!&nbsp; We drove and drove some more.&nbsp; I listened to every BNL song on the planet at least eight times each.&nbsp; Finally we stopped for the night in Bangor, a city about halfway up.&nbsp; And wow, Maine is really huge!&nbsp; I never even realized.&nbsp; They say that one of their counties, Aristook County, the one I was staying in, was larger than Massachusetts.&nbsp; Holy mooses.&nbsp; Yeah, it's one cool state, and I'm not even being sarcastic!</P>
<P>One silly little side note is that my uncle Jay and aunt Cathy, who live right here in Bridgewater on Fox Hill Drive, were still in Boston when we were in Kennebunkport, ME at a rest stop eating lunch.&nbsp; Kennebunkport isn't too far from Bangor.&nbsp; It is also the summer residence of Daddy Bush and the W.&nbsp; But anyways, we thought we were so smart and cool for a while because ohhh, Jay expected that we'd back out of the whole trip before we even left and his family are the travel people anyways.&nbsp; Swear to God, they could go to Connecticut for a loaf of bread and not even think twice on it.&nbsp; Soooo, when they strangely arrived in Bangor ten minutes after we did... well, whatever.&nbsp; It's all my dad's fault, he drives 55 on the highways.</P>
<P>Okay.&nbsp; So we left the next day after driving around Bangor looking for a church for at least an hour and subsequently giving up, and before long we were in the middle of rural Maine, the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; We stopped to use the bathroom sometime that day, getting off at an exit that advertised a nearby Citgo station.&nbsp; Well, that Citgo was about twenty miles down the road from the exit, and what it really was was this little diner with a gas pump outside.&nbsp; A bunch of old people were sitting around inside, and you could tell that they all knew each others' names and business and stuff.&nbsp; It was really very cool.&nbsp; OK, we got back on the high way till, finally, we hit Caribou!&nbsp; (OH yeah, right next to Caribou was, incidentaly, Bridgewater ME.&nbsp; Go figure).&nbsp; </P>
<P>We waited around for Jay, who arrived, once again, twenty minutes after us even though we'd left Bangor an hour earlier.&nbsp; Pfft.&nbsp; We had a rendez-vous at the local Shop n' Save, and proceded to my cousins' house for dinner.&nbsp; I met my cousins there for the first time, and they are all so awesome!&nbsp; Really outgoing, which was a huge relief.&nbsp; I was scared they'd be all teenager-y and quiet, but that wasn't the case at all.&nbsp; The five of us ate dinner at our own little table, and went downstairs to watch their tapes of them waterskiing.&nbsp; They were in the process of trying to convince Julie and me to do it.&nbsp; My mom was, at the time, adamantly against it.&nbsp; Justin, who's my age, tried to convince her while the rest of us were still watching, but she was all Mom-ish and I guess she gave him one of her evil teacher glares.&nbsp; Anyways, he didn't ask her about it anymore!&nbsp; sigh.&nbsp; Silly Mom.&nbsp; Jordan, who was my sisters' age, kind of made us shoot his gun-thing at a target in the basement.&nbsp; Whoah.&nbsp; I'd never held a gun before so much as shot one, so that was.. interesting.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Weyell, we finally went to their camp house after dinner, which turned out to be beautiful.&nbsp; Right on the lake, with no cars or airplanes or trains buzzing around us like in Bridgewater.. it was awesome.&nbsp; I won't get into everything that happened the whole week, sheesh this is already long enough, but still... That night we went out on their boat, while my cousins did their whole waterskiing act.&nbsp; They were <EM>good</EM>.&nbsp; During my one feeble attempt, I couldn't even get up.&nbsp; Julie did better than me, ha ha.&nbsp; Oh well.</P>
<P>Over the next few days, I saw the auroras for the first time, saw my first moose, re-learned how to play Cribbage, drove&nbsp;my first&nbsp;go-cart, waterskiied (kinda!&nbsp; haha), went water-tubing, saw a million ducks, heard loons, had a campfire, made s'mores, fell in love with their dog Madison (who actually tapped you with his paw if you stopped petting him.&nbsp; adorable.)&nbsp;, took a day trip and explored rural Canada (lol, i know), ate lobster, had my first scarlet red Maine hotdog, went a week without my computer or television and didn't miss it at alllll, slept in my first dormitory (sort of), and had so much fun.&nbsp; whew.&nbsp; okay.</P>
<P>this was unnecessarily long.&nbsp; i'm really very sorry about that.&nbsp; enough for now.&nbsp; sorry sorry sorry.</P>"

"event","<P>Okay, i think I might have figured out why i was so cheery the other night.&nbsp; Why lately I've been strangely optimistic.&nbsp; It's pretty weird, and I'm sure nobody cares.&nbsp; But, for the first time in a while I'm excited about, and interested in meeting some new people.&nbsp; Like, for the past three years of highschool I had it all laid out and planned, I knew exactly what it was I&nbsp;wanted and never really looked for anything else.&nbsp; And at the beginning of the summer, when that&nbsp;hurtful mean thing that Nick did was still fresh in my mind, I was just ready to give up on dating till at least after college and not have a damn thing to do with another equally thoughtless and self-centered guy for a long, long while.&nbsp; Yeah I know that was a little melodramatic, but I don't care, after the last time 'round with a significant other that's seriously just what i wanted at the time.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Though.. I'm not saying that&nbsp;I&nbsp;wanna be hooked up with some random stranger I don't even know.&nbsp; Eeh, not at all.&nbsp;This is just the first time I can remember that I really wanted to sort of branch out, to try new things, even if it does mean getting hurt like before.&nbsp; It's just exciting, that's all.&nbsp; And a nice feeling to not be so angry anymore towards the entire male gender just 'cause of&nbsp;one asshole.&nbsp;Not <EM>all</EM> guys suck.. !</P>
<P>hah but with my luck nothing even remotely interesting will happen till I leave for college.&nbsp; i already know too many people here in bridgewater and I don't think there's anything worthwhile that isn't already worth something, if you get what I mean.&nbsp; Yeah, I should just stop talking now.. but hey, even though i might have bored you to death at least typing it all out was fun and helped me to think!&nbsp; ahh damn journals. </P>"

"event","<P>yeah so for some reason lately i've just been a little different.&nbsp; ok this all isn't gonna make much sense, but well if ya know me then you know that i could sometimes, well, take stuff seriously.. a bit tooo much.. but like, for a little while now nothing has phased me.&nbsp; maybe i'm just suddenly extremely optimistic for no damn reason, who knows?&nbsp; ok yes now that you all think i've lost my mind (again).&nbsp; really though, whyyy do i have a feeling that something good is about to happen?&nbsp; eh, with my luck it probably won't.&nbsp; go figure, here i am, irish as they come and i'm not even lucky and i can barely drink any alcohol without barfing.&nbsp; looooove it!</P>

"event","yep so this morning i came home to find that carley wanted to swim in the pool.  that worked out grandly, for in the end a little group showed up.  di, car and ash, jenna, cat, nicole.  we swam around, trampolined, etc... oh it was really quite fun! weve gotta just do that, aka hang around and do nothing, more often.  i'm just excited about plymouth! i've never been on a plymouth adventure before.  lol dont ask..

after everyone left brendon came over and we just hung around and watched tv (i.e. tons of degrassi / i love the 90s) and gossiped and discussed my hair till my parents got home.  

yep.  they went to a johnny mathis concert.  good ol' rents.

all in all, it was a good day.. ;)"

"event","<P>yes so anyways.&nbsp; my weekend... was preeetty cool.&nbsp; can i just say.&nbsp; hahah yeeep, Saturday was the Donovan party at my house.. or to put it rightly, the Third Annual Donovan family Golf Tournament/ Pool Party/ Cookout.&nbsp; And it was at, of course,<EM>&nbsp;</EM>my house.&nbsp; Five Donovan boys and Johnny C., but my house.&nbsp; Well I didn't really mind.&nbsp; It was pretty nice seeing everybody, since I don't get to so much and they're pretty cool anyways.&nbsp; It was really nice spending the day with Nana.&nbsp; My little, 8 year old adhd-ridden cousin spent the day with us while everybody was off golfing, and he found the need to latch on to me.&nbsp; Ten cousins, and I was the one.&nbsp; He whined till I finally gave in to go in the pool or go on the trampoline wiht him or whatever.&nbsp; I'm lucky i even got into the bathroom wihtout the kid following me in there.&nbsp; He was really kissing up to my nana, who was loving it because she's really like me and we both dig that kind of stuff.&nbsp; But after he seriously asked her if she was 94, (or, at least mid-90's) and said, ""Oh, I love your perfume Nana!&nbsp; And hey, you're growing a mustache!&nbsp; Are you gonna get a beard too?""&nbsp; she told him to get lost and yep, he was miiine.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I could deal though.&nbsp; It was only one kid for one day in the year, I guess.&nbsp; and i 3 kids wayyy more than I probably should, heh, so he could get away with murder with me.&nbsp; </P>
<P>mm.&nbsp; Worked yesterday, that's pretty much all I did.&nbsp; Got up and worked 3:30-9.&nbsp; The evil water bag lady came in.. although that's another story for another time.&nbsp; I'm tired of typing.</P>

<P>it's official.&nbsp; Just as if Kerry saw the entry of yore and wanted to have some fun and be spiteful, he chose Edwards.&nbsp; Ah well, at least he chose <EM><U>somebody</U>.&nbsp; </EM>There's gotta be a reason why he chose him, at least.&nbsp; A polling reason.&nbsp; Perhaps he can deliver the South.. although, they say that he recently announced that he wasn't going to run for North Carolina senator next term again because a loss was, supposedly, blatant.&nbsp; Hmm, that's very... reassuring?&nbsp; But still.&nbsp; Ohh, and Edwards wasn't even Kerry's first choice.&nbsp; Surprise surprise, McCain was.&nbsp; If it had been a bipartisan Kerry McCain Democratic ticket, I would have gone berserk.&nbsp; I like McCain even more than I like Kerry - shocking!&nbsp;- and if it was Kerry <EM>vs.</EM> McCain and I was over eighteen, you bet I'd be voting for the latter.&nbsp; I'm crazy like that.&nbsp; I'm a crazy girl.&nbsp; You never know what spontaneous or mentally insane thing I may do next.</P>
<P>yeah but still.&nbsp; It would have made me infinitely happy if McCain had just accepted, and both were running together.&nbsp; When was the last time that a single nomination was bipartisan?&nbsp; That's wonderful.&nbsp; We would have gotten so many Republican votes too!&nbsp; And independents.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Okay, I've gotta stop talking about that now.&nbsp; On a more.. eeh, girly note, I designed/sewed my first top today.&nbsp; Like, a tank top.&nbsp; A blouse really.&nbsp; But not.&nbsp; i dunno, i honestly have no clue why I'm still writing anyways.</P>

"event","<P>Will Kerry <EM>please</EM> choose a running mate?&nbsp; This is driving me nuts.&nbsp; It's already July, and he doesn't have a running mate.&nbsp; The election's under six months away, and he's thiiis close to selecting John Edwards.&nbsp; I think Edwards is a sleaze, frankly.&nbsp; You know, one of those silver-spoon politicians you wouldn't wanna have a conversation with.&nbsp; It looks like he might choose him, too.&nbsp; I heard on the news that Edwards left abruptly in the middle of a family vacation to Disneyworld to fly to D.C. for a meeting with Kerry.&nbsp; Totally unexpected, with even some members of his own staff unaware of what he was doing.&nbsp; Eeh.&nbsp; I'd rather have Gephardt or Vilsack over Edwards.&nbsp; Really don't care which.&nbsp; But, even if Kerry does choose him over the other two, eh, he's still lightyears beyond fumbling Bush.&nbsp; Swear to god, if that guy's daddy hadn't been slightly powerful and famous throughout his lifetime then the W would be the most productive cattle farmer in the state of Texas.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Sorry about that little, well <EM>long</EM>, rant.&nbsp; I've been watching too much CNN.</P>
<P>My mom and I were in the kitchen making dinner when her cellphone rang.&nbsp; That was pretty odd since the only people who ever call her, albeit the only ones who even know her number, are me, Julie, and Dad.&nbsp; Julie was watching TV and Dad was in the family room.&nbsp; I answered it for her, and to my great surprise this Spanish guy was screaming on the other end, demanding that some Elaine pick up and talk to him.&nbsp; ""Elaine!&nbsp; Elaine!&nbsp; <EM>*unrecognizable spanish screaming*</EM>&nbsp; ELAINE!""&nbsp; He sounded like he was in a car.&nbsp; I handed my mom the phone and could still hear him from across the room.&nbsp; She said, in her teachery no-nonsense-from-me-you-chauvinistic-bastard tone of voice ""there is no Elaine here, for the third time, go away, goodbye!""&nbsp; She hung up the phone, the guy screaming in Spanish all the while.&nbsp; It was pretty creepy.&nbsp; Apparently the guy had called her before, but she thought it was no big deal and didn't tell anybody.&nbsp; Sheesh.&nbsp; We called Verizon and had her number changed.. probably the same thing the original Elaine had done.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I mean, my mom's had her phone for a few weeks now, which means that this Elaine&nbsp;must have discontinued that number a&nbsp;little while ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this Elaine had wanted the man to keep in touch with her, she surely would have given him her new number by now.&nbsp; Maybe, just maybe, she changed the number just to get away from this guy.&nbsp; I mean, I would have too!&nbsp; People don't usually scare me but talking to this guy for those .2 seconds did.&nbsp; I'm a little creeped out by this whole thing.&nbsp; Hah, I'm the only one too.&nbsp; As usual!</P>
<P>Oh well.&nbsp; &lt;3</P>"

"event","<P>Yes'm, I haven't updated in a while, have I now?&nbsp; Nothing interesting at all has happened.&nbsp; Like at <EM>all</EM>.&nbsp; Two nights ago I went out to dinner with the fam at the good ol' 99, which means i was actually wearing normal people clothes when the cell rang.&nbsp; It was Doon, with Car and Catherine in the background.&nbsp; We went out for icecream, and then stopped off at d'Angelo's to pay homage to Lybye.&nbsp; She was working, ha ha.&nbsp; I didn't see her there at all first, so I decided to make use of the fact that I was indeed in d'Angelo's and went to use the bathroom.&nbsp; I finished, opened the door, and yelped when I saw that Lybye was standing like RIGHT THERE.&nbsp; She was sweeping.&nbsp; It was kinda freaky.&nbsp; It figures, though, that she would see me getting out of the ladies' room.&nbsp; Surprise there, eh?  Car insisted on invading Ashley's.  So we sat in the driveway there for a few and talked to her and Dan.  </P>
<P>Worked all day yesterday.&nbsp; Some arse had told me that I was scheduled to work 4-10 when I called last weekend, when in reality he read the schedule of the girl right under me on the list.&nbsp; I was supposed to be in there at 2:30 damnit.&nbsp; So you can just imagine my surprise and annoyance when my manager called me right as I was getting out of the shower to tell me that, yey, I was nine minutes late.&nbsp; It's a good thing that the CVS people are very nice and flexible, they didn't really care, and<EM>&nbsp;</EM>I guess the lying culprit (whose name I shan't release) is a little slow on the uptake at times.&nbsp; meh.</P>

Just goes to show how out of shape I was.&nbsp;&nbsp;I slept over Nana's on Sunday night.&nbsp; Ohhhhh, how I love the Cape!&nbsp; Poppy became a little obsessed with my Bush quotes calendar, ya know, the one with all his weird scrambled-English misspeak, and read just about every single quote from that calendar to us at dinner.&nbsp; It was fun, though.&nbsp; Heh, i think I like being there just a little too much!&nbsp; I wanna go back.&nbsp; Like tomorrow.&nbsp; mkay.</P>
<P>Then on Monday, I had my first real day of work at CVS.&nbsp; So far so good, I like it alot.&nbsp; I'm a cashier, and I got the hang of it kind of soon... i guess!&nbsp; heh, I only had to call the manager down for help oh about 7406456465 times.&nbsp; My favorite part is the pager, of all things.&nbsp; ""Backup to the front please, backup to the front!""&nbsp; The people I work with are wicked cool too.&nbsp; I can tell it'll be pretty fun. </P>
<P>Yeah, today I went minigolfing with the gang.&nbsp; Di, Amanda, Brendon, Dan, Nicole and myself to be exact.&nbsp; We gave up on keeping score after, oh, the 1st hole though.&nbsp; We mostly just occupied ourselves with throwing the golfballs, retrieving them from the river, and kicking htem into the holes like cool kids.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We came swimming after, then watched Queer Eye in my den.&nbsp; Next week, they're doing a Queer Eye for the Gay Guy!&nbsp; Thaaaat should be interesting.</P>

"event","<P>Okay, tell me if you think all this is weird or not.&nbsp; In the past week, five bad luck, frreaky things have happened to me that have never happened before in my life.&nbsp; FIVE.&nbsp; Okay, here we go.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I was going into CVS for my interview one week ago today (which, by the way, went well and I am now hired, tee hee) and I didn't know where to go for it.&nbsp; So I waited in line at the cash register to ask the cashier where I was to be interviewed.&nbsp; The line was long, and it took forever, but finally it came to the lady in front of me.&nbsp; She payed, everything was fine, UNTIL....&nbsp;&nbsp; I just so happened to look up and see what change was due, and, sure enough, the number came to six dollars and sixty-six cents.&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; $6.66.&nbsp; Little odd?&nbsp; Well, I thought that that was a sign about the interview.&nbsp; At least it wasn't.&nbsp; But it goes on.</P>
<P>The next day was a half day at school for finals.&nbsp; I came home, put down my stuff,a nd went into the bathroom.&nbsp; But before I actually even touched it, the toilet flushed, <EM>all on its own</EM>.&nbsp; I was like a foot away from it.&nbsp; That got me.</P>
<P>Nothing happened till Monday, when Jenna, Cat, Brendon, Amanda, Allie, and Nicole came over for the afternoon.&nbsp; Brendon and Amanda thought they were being funny by staying locked in my room, while the rets of us did all we could to get them out.&nbsp; Eventually we got a ladder to climb up to the window and get their attention.&nbsp; I tripped, and accidentaly sort of walked under the ladder.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; There's more.</P>
<P>The next two have to do with cats.&nbsp; Two nights ago, Brendon, Amanda, and Daan came over to watch a movie.&nbsp; There was this random stray cat on my deck, meowing like hell.&nbsp; It was different shades of brown and just wouldn't leave.&nbsp; NONE of&nbsp;my neighbors have a cat like that.&nbsp; That wouldn't be weird except for its meow.&nbsp; It sounded so creepy!&nbsp; <EM>And it wouldn't stop.</EM>&nbsp; Aaaah.</P>
<P>The last thing happened .25 seconds ago.&nbsp; I was sitting out in the backyard on a lawn chair, tanning, when the sound of a bee buzzing near made me sit up.&nbsp; Perched by the pool, perfectly silhouetted, was a black-as-midnight cat.&nbsp; It was pretty big, and had these lime green eyes that just stared right at me.&nbsp; It didn't move an inch, even when I kind of yelped and ran away.&nbsp; It just sat there, <EM>staring</EM>.&nbsp; OK normally I wouldn't be scared of a freakin cat, but after the past week, ohhh man. I'm like, scared of my own shadow.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I dunno, am I crazy?&nbsp; Is it all in my own head?&nbsp; Or..... what?&nbsp; </P>"

What good aim!
Throwing it and running off as soon as he heard someone say ""OW!""

I just love the mischivieous acts going around school.
In one of my classes I had to write a report on anything I wanted.
Of course knowing me..
I picked how Video Games are made.
Ohh yeah I wrote a four page report on the subject.
Something I was glad I did.

So when I was makin' the title page today.
I put a picture of Calintz from Magna Carta.
Oh yeah that made me smile.

Also I learned our military train our soldiers with video games so they get hand eye coordination and have good stradigetic memories and shnit like that.

I'm just way too cool.
Seriously.
I also learned the soldiers in Iraq have like..Video cameras and cell phones with videos taping footage of the war and putting background music on it and stuff.

Or they're just plain fooling around. Lmfao!

I think this year is gonna be the best Christmas simply because..
I'm getting everything I want.
And I'm getting two Christmases!
Hahahahahhaahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahhahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!


Yeah I know most you get like five our six just because you've got friend's and family and stuff like that.
But this is the first time I'm getting more than one!!!!!

Come on! 
Live a little!

I got a test Friday.
I hate tests........
I hate school.......
But I guess I gotta get an education somewhere.....

They have to move on no matter what.
Is that weird?
I hate moving on no matter what.
Am I too human?
Or am I not human at all?
I amuse myself so easily.

There really is no justice is there?
It's just kinda there for people who can do anything.
But no one can do anything.
We can do somethings but not anything.

I amuse myself so easily.

Does this make me crazy?
Thinking these kinds of things?

Or am I just too human?
Or not human at all?
Haha..
It'd be funny if I was scaring a few people with these thoughts of mine.


I've been writing a story about my character, Ruby Yokota (Thus the name for some of you people reading this who don't know who I'm talking about)
She's being haunted by this silver haired man in her dreams.
It starts off with her in the nightmare fighting him off and she gets injured in her shoulder in the dream and he gets ready for the final blow and she wakes up and..Her scars are burning like they're cut open again but they're not.
But she's really injured in her shoulder. Like the dreams a reality but is the man just a dream?

^ ^ hehehehehehe

I'm so evil with the stories I write.

Hmm...Am I missing anything?
......No I guess not

Man..
I've been working hard around the house for money to buy presents and everything.
Two more weeks and school will be out for Christmas break I can hardly wait!!!
I already know a few things I'm getting thanks to my sisters and some spies ^ ^
I just cannot wait!
This is gonna be one of the best Christmas's yet. Not because of the presents but because I have everyone with me.
All of you.

I dunno why but I got depressed during my Seminar hour of class and wrote a really depressing poem.
Talk about an Emo moment.
But the poem was really..
Like I was living in the eyes of a Fallen Angel..
It was vivid.

Also I had a strange nightmare.
Imagine this.
A  red head struggling to get out of a cocoon of darkness.
Feeling all of her energy slipping away.
Every time she breaks from her struggle..
Her energy doesn't come back.
Glacial eyes turning red from the stress..
No one can hear her cries. They're in vain.
And then...
I felt a light in my dream..
And the red head looks up and an Angel that looks like Angel Sanctuary's Adam Kadamon helped the red head from the darkness and left without saying a word!
I've read his magic is neither white nor black.

It's a strange nightmare/dream
Since I was kinda saved from the dank nightmare I guess it was more like a dream.

Chelsea's out of school for a week due to an illness she caught last year that came back, and it's even eviller this time..
Is it the cause of the blood?
I shiver always thinking about that..

And for Soren's character development..It's kinda goin' smoothly..(I'm lying..But I'm getting close..Hehehhehe...)
You can't blame me..I'm having some blocks towards Characters (I dunno why..)


Peace out..

"event","I woke up this morning..Chelsea was sleeping to the right of me..I had my usual corner next to the wall in bed..My favorite spot.
I sleepily open my eyes to check to see if she's still asleep..and all over her face and in her mouth..
I see her own blood.
My eyes widened with shock and I was scared.
I yelled at her, ""Chelsea! Wake up! You have blood all over you!""and I'm not the kind of person to joke about blood.
The sight of it makes me scared..and even more sleepy. Like it's some kind of safeguard.

I really do get sleepy when I see blood.

She woke up with a start and ran for the bathroom...
Weird thing is she wasn't cut anywhere..
And the blood was fresh.
So she washed out her mouth and I wasn't able to back to sleep.

Today when she left..I didn't want to let her go..I was scared for her..
She said it was the second time it had happened..
And another weird thing..
None of it was on my pillows or blanket.
None of it.

Besides that I read the finished chapter and I absolutely love it.
I've been playing Magna Carta and I love that too.
And I ordered Wild Arms 2 the Orginial Soundtract finally and I can't wait 'til I get ahold of it.
I love the sound of the music and it really gets me going.

I've read this Manga called Chrono Crusade and I love that too!
The main character's name is Chrono and he's a demon that teamed up with a nun to fight against demons in the Americas! It's set in the 1920's!
After I read it I had some people call me Chrono that day since I fell in love with the name (Yeah only certain people can call me it XD)
But I love it. I have no idea why. I always have.

I get to have two Christmases this year since my dad totally blew last year's off (Yeah he got aressted on Christmas Eve..What a dope)
So I get to have Christmas a week before and right on it (Go me!)
He's planning on getting me something and my mom said..""I can't tell you what it is..but If he does get it for you..You'll love it and him too.""
I wonder what it is..And I'll keep wondering.

Happy Belated Birthday Shiela..

So..Uh..
I haven't been doing my math homework..>.> Hehhehehh...
I came home early due to my irritated eye from a fight that enused four days ago (Yes it still hurts the bruise is right on my eye for crying out loud)

And a nice new Tales of Symphonia skit by me..
Yggdrasil still going on about his underwear being stolen.
Ruby Yokota: Yggdrasil: ::Walks out and finds Yuan sitting down in a chair watching Tv wrapped in a blanket:: 
Ruby Yokota: Yuan: ::looks up at him:: ...?
Ruby Yokota: Yggdrasil: ::jerks the blanket off him and points saying sinisterly:: UNDERPANTS
Ruby Yokota: Kratos: ::walks in and then quickly walks back out:: What the crap..
Ruby Yokota: Yuan: T_T..Yeah teddy bear boxers..Now gimme my blankie.. 

I was going to gamestop and this lady had this on her car
""You shouldn't meddle in a dragon's affairs...For you taste good crispy and with ketchup.""
I'm not lying.

I thought it was funny..plus the sight of my character Sei (For descriptions IM me) wearing a bright red apron saying 'I'm Trying' LMAO!

Trying to cook that is..
Another shirt I can see him wearing is one that says ""Don't Turn Off"" or ""You like Guys.""

In other news...I got a hold of Rowan and We don't know if we'll have our RP party on the weekend. His mom is relucntant to go to the mountains now and they even took the mouse away (He claims he can't use a computer without a mouse but..He learned..He learned) So he calls me real quick so I can call back. I dunno if we'll be able to talk again very soon but I sure hope so.
I'm in the mood to play a game but I dunno what to play, Legend of Legaia, Devil May Cry, or a Final Fantasy game but I'm just so bored lately..I might even play Tales of Symphonia. 
And on top of that my mother is home now. I hope she does not have to go back to the Hospital anytime soon. I get so worried about her..More worried than I really leave off. People tell me I hide my emotions with anger and push people away with my silence but..What can I do? I normally don't talk to different people who don't know me...I just stick with what I got is there any harm in that? Excuse me for my sentimental part comming out but I just think these things and just wonder. Espically if there's anything out there besides us Humans. Who knows if Moutian Dragons still exist..Or A Sea Dragon in the deepest of oceans...Maybe there really is a Phoenix hiding in the sands of the desert. See? I wonder about so many things its not even funny. But its a good thing to day dream espically in the toughest of times like these. I haven't called my dad in a while but if he knew how busy I was with myself (like thinking and stuff like that) He'd probably understand. Espically by the fact of how my little sister was such a jerk to me (He didn't do anything to stop her) It really made me mad how he would spoil her and reluctantly spend money on me. Its because she's younger and more gullible that he can buy her off with his secrets in toys and fake but beautiful feather roses. She even got a black one (I had one before her. She thinks she has a right to copy me but when people do..I sometimes loath it) 
But I should stop my ranting and let my mother use the computer.

"event","I don't realize what I've been falling for
Everything is fading slowly
When I want to reach out
It slowly pulls away...

There's a few things that I've been holding in
I realize i've been fighting for nothing
I am not your disease!
You can't control me!

I watch you fall into darkness
Waiting for you to see...
Waiting for you to see...
Your Failed Light

I realize I've been pushed for nothing
I can't believe I didn't see it all.
I won't let you control me

I realize I've been fighting for nothing
I can't believe I've been holding on
You're loosing your grip..
I'm searching for my light.
(I AM NOT YOUR DISEASE!) 
I'm breaking away from you..
Be banished away to your HELL!"

"event","Is Basically My Clumsy Chelsea...Of course tackling me  yesterday was funny and painful but also bent my glasses and my nose piece fell off..She did break three vacums on accident at work I thought it was funny. I warned her of going to the bathroom by herself..I really bet she could be the Grim Reaper for Electrical Devices and Glasses. The whole time I was there she was pretty clumsy scratching me.. Pressing on the side she hurt while tackling...Yeah. 
But even after that I had a nice time there..I'll get ahold of Ellen Rimbauer's (I'm trying my best with that woman's last name) Diary on Rose Red (Chelsea's older sister has a copy of it and said I could borrow it as soon as she was done reading it) 
And I've been replaying Kingdom Hearts with Chelsea (Tag Teaming on that game is such sweet sorrow) 
And on top of that...I was thinking about having my character use duel handguns that were hand made by her (That'll rock the house) 
I hear my mom is gonna come home tomorrow (That better not ruin this Weekend's plans with RPing or I'm gonna be one ticked off girl) 
I actually wrote a song/poem right when I woke up..I'm probably gonna have Chelsea type it up for me so I can post it all for people to see...If she does it'll be in the next post. (Yes I'll post twice today to make up for tomorrow) 
Hopefully I'll get ahold of Rowan today..I heard he called while I was having fun..
When My sister, Meca picked me up today She had buy Limes and Milk..Then added Beef Jerky and a couple of hamburgers for us, because I was whining about it (Hahahaha)
I'm singing Mellow Candle and posting and at the same time Funny XDD

"event","Yeah so, Omigod if people do not stop calling my house for petty things for Chelsea I am gonna end up killing people. I'm gonna find a way to use Fire Alchemy over the phone. Mustang would reward me! And Houston needs to get his ass beat down. He's fluckin annoying. I'm just about to go and kick someone's butt and be happy for the rest of the day that I took my stress out on someone else ^ ^ But the weird thing is I really wish my mom was here She gave me thirty bucks to buy junkfood with (since someone isn't responsible enough for that.) Twenty of the money I earned and I can do what ever I want with. The other 10 is my little sister's so...Yeah. I want to be paid right now though..Arrggh I can hardly stand it. 
Man I wish I could bash Houston over the head with something SUPAH Hard. I'm probably gonna hate High School because I have to put up with preps, Biatches..and guess what? MORE Biatches. Devil May Cry 3 has so many things my Character would do in it..I'd have to play the whole thing through I mean..I never knew Virgil out of anyone would have fun enough to actually do a certain thing that Dante would do. Have the guts enough to say...,""JACK POT!"" Go Virgil! Even though you're a power craving half demon that's the identical twin of Dante...you're still hot!

And I couldn't go swimming but I went to the store earlier and I saw my friend Blake! He did a double take and saw me and gave me the peace sign! So Blake! Its so nice to see he's okay,fine, and well even though he doesn't really know me all that well I guess it's fine. I'm supposed to bring Bloody Roar 2 But Who knows I might be mean and not let Chelsea play it at all (I'm kidding) Just hopefully We can continue our Gundam Wing RP and get something to eat I'm starving like crazy! Ugghh! But anyway I'm wearing this purfume called Hawaian Ginger and it smells sooo good. Tomorrow maybe we'll go to the store and buy me a bathing suit. I want a red one cuz I'm crazy. What I really need to do is buy me a lot of new under garments...x.x Like you guys needed to read that anyway! lol! Now the fact is she's still not here and its driving me mad. We'd better RP Gundam Wing or I'm gonna go nuts cuz I found this awesome site with AWESOME humor Its just crazy mad funny! I was up 'til 6:30 in the morning laughing about it last night. I couldn't stand it Espically the bumper stickers. Cuz you know how many times did Heero try and press the PRETTY RED SELF DESTRUCT Buttton! Well enough writing the phone's ringing and its probably for me. ~ Ja ne"

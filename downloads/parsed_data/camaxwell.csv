Thursday night I went to Jamal's frat house, and had waaaay to much to drink.  My and my roomeys, and the guys across the street all came back home and had a little more to drink.  Thats when i came to my room and started puking.  I dont really remember goin to sleep, but Keith says i called him a few times and left messages that he couldnt even understand.  I woke up Friday morning, and threw up 12 times that day...ugh!!  It sucked. Keith got here Friday night, and we hung out and watched tv til like 3a.m. and yesterday we chilled all day and watched football.  He had some beers with Nick last night and played drinking games..i just watched and laughed, then my roomeys came home from a party.  Thats when Christina(other roomey) got here too, one roomey yelled at her cuz of some crap that she does.  And today we find out she is moving out..Ha!!  But yeah, keith and nick were wasted last night, with one of my roomeys, it was funny.  Then my baby had to leave early this monring..*tear*  So today I slept all day cuz i felt like shit again.  I keep getting sick, but only for the day.  UGH!! Then i watched a movie with my two roomeys, cuz Christina is outta here!  Now i'm chillin, eatin a fudge pop...thos things are the best in the world!!! Yummy!  Well, i'll update later.

I went to class all day then my roomate (one of them) decided to drink with one of our guy friends..i had to get up at 7 the next morning to go catch my flight home...so they didnt let me sleep.  They kept jumping on me in my bed to wake me up...yeah, ended up going to bed at 2 a.m.  Friday morning i flew home, chilled with keith and left for TN..keith didnt get to go..he was throwing up, yuck!  We arrived in TN and chilled with my dads best friend (where we stayed) and went to bed.  Nothing to great.  Saturday i went shopping with my mom, my dads best friends g/f, and her mom...Her mom is like 70 something and is the funniest old lady i know.  She cusses, smokes, drinks..she is just really funny.  We went and chilled with the g-rents, and that night we went to this really nice restaurant.  Its called High Point, and its in the mountains.  Al Capone owned it, and it was the middle point between chicago and miami..his little hide out.  There used to be underground tunnels leading differnt places from it.  They say its haunted..but i dont know.  Sunday we went to church, and hung with the g-rents, went to church again and came home..kinda boring but i had fun.  I came back to school monday, and had a few drinks with my roomeys...But i had early classes yesterday, so i went to bed a somewhat of a decent hour.  Last night my roomey and her b/f broke up so we comforted her, and she took shots, funny stuff.  And now i am here..ha!

Today I did nothing until I had class at 6:30...History...yuck..but my teacher is an x-druggie...lol.  He is from an Italian family and was raised in NY, but he came to GA to get out of the ""environment"" he was in.  He said he was just like some dude on the Sopranos.  He told us to not come to class high or drunk cuz he will be able to tell, he said he can spot that from 100 miles away..lol.  He was cracking us up.  But yeah, that was the highlight of the day i guess.  School is really easy.  Well, it was only the third day, but i think it will be really easy again.  Last semester didnt even feel like I was at college.  I never studied, and i used my books maybe 3 times the entire semester.  It was great.  If ur looking for an easy college, come to VSU...its great.  Well, i'm gonna go read some cuz i love it.  Peace

And then I got to stay home til today cuz they cancelled class yesterday and today cuz of the weather.  I just chilled with keith most of the time..and jenna too.  I love being home but I have to sleep in the guest room so that sucks kinda.  Me and my mom went to wal-mart on Monday and we laughed the whole time...I love that woman even tho sometimes she makes me mad..she will always be my #1 fan. Anyways...well i didnt have too much to say, but that my weekend was great.  Love to everyone!!!  I miss you guys!!
Love always

"event","Hello again!  Well, I know I didn't update yesterday so I guess I can do that today.  Yesterday I had to get up at 7 for a Bio. lab at 8...ugh..we had a quiz but it was soooo easy.  After that I slept cuz I had to get up so early.  I had Bio at 3:30 and Philosophy at 5...I love Bio.  I think that is what i'm gonna major in.  Its a lot of fun...I know..your thinking ""How in the world could biology possibly be fun"", but i'm a nerd so I like it..jk :) Then we all chilled at the apartment and Christina and Christie (2 roomates) decided to pull an all nighter.  That was funny, but I hit the sheets at like 2 after reading out of my kindergarten english book. LOL. I had that class at 9:30 this morning..to early so I slept after.  Then I had my perspectives class at 12:30..boring.  And now I have just been really lazy until Pol.Sci. tonight at 6:30.  Plus, its ok to be lazy on rainy days.  Anyways, I miss everyone sooo much and I love you all tttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssssssssss much!! Actually more but that's all i decided to say.  
Love always,
Cynthia

"event","Wow.  Well, at least one of my roommates has internet now so i'm using her computer.  None of us others have it yet tho cuz there is something messed up with it.  Yeah we are really pissed cuz for one it took this long for them to get it to us and now it is all messed up.  Geez!! Anyways, to the good stuff, I absolutely love college.  It is so much fun.  I recommend VSU to everyone.  My classes are really easy so far, all my teachers are really nice, and I have met so many people here.  It's amazing.  I've partied a lot..but not tooo much.  I went home last weekend cuz my dads birthday was yesterday and so we celebrated on Sat. night.  I hung out with Keith the whole time and of course Seth cuz they are always together.  I also hung out with Jenna a lot and Cali too.  Other than that I really didn't hang out with anyone else.  I miss all of my friends soooo much.  Especially, Alex, Jenna, Cali, Meg Dar, all my v-ball girls, Lauren, and Alyson.  If i didnt mention you then I dont care....NOT REALLY..JUST KIDDING!!  I miss everyone sooo much.  If you want to come see me just call and let me know.  I am up for it.  I am so excited cuz I am going to TN this weekend and it is gonna be a blast.  Redneck vacation again!!! Yay!! Well, I'm out i guess but I will try to update regularly now.  I have a new email address at college:  camaxwell@valdosta.edu  I think thats it..if not then i will let you know!!

"event","well, i just got back from france yesterday and had a blast.  My cousins are so awesome and so much fun to be around.  They made me laugh the whole time.  I hadnt seen them in so long and i surely did miss the family.  My grandma cried when i left.  It was so sad.  I didnt want to leave but i missed everyone here.  France is sooooo different from here.  I like it a lot better here tho.  Im glad im home but i leave again Saturday for college.  geez i have the hicups again.  How many times a day can u get those.  Anyways im excited/nervous about college.  Im ready for it tho.  So i came back yesterday and slept a lot.  I finally saw keith last night...i was so glad cuz i missed him a lot.  Tonight i went to lindseys to say bye to her cuz she is leaving tomorrow..it was kinda sad but i didnt cry until i was in my car goin to keiths.  I was balling and then i got there and stopped but when i layed down with him i broke down.  I'm gonna miss everyone soooooo much and i am so sad that i am leaving.  But i guess its gotta happen sooner or later.  Keith said its all a part of growing up....but i dont wanna grow up..lol..well i do but i dont want to leave all my friends.  The 4 people i hung out with for most of my life arent going to be with me...and it sucks really bad.  My best friend will be 5 hours away..and i dont know what im gonna do without her.  Alex, i love you soooo much and i will miss you!!! Youre the best!! i love you sis..anyways, i guess i will meet other people there but nobody can ever replace my friends that i have now.  Well, i'm out...remember...i love you girls..yall are awesome!!!

"event","Today I finally got to sleep in.  I slept till 12:30, and it felt really good.  Then I got up and went to Keith's to eat lunch.  I helped him study and then I came home.  I went and ran errands with the french boys cuz they had a few things to buy and so did I.  Then we got Taco Bell and came home.  I chilled here then went to Seth's cuz Dayna said to go there.  Me, Dayna, Seth, Cali, Keith, Erin, and Jake went to waffle house.  Didn't eat cuz Taco Bell filled me up.  Then we watched Big Daddy at Seth's.  That movie is so good.  This was like the 50th time that I have seen it tho.  Now I'm at the house just chillin and greatful to be on this planet.  Could you imagine if you didn't live on this planet.  Wow, that was random..LOL. Aight, I'm out!!! Goodnight!

"event","Well, i woke up saturday morning and went to ihop with my mom her two friends keith and seth.  then me, my mom, and seth went and got pedicures.  Haha. Seth got one..he loved it.  My mom told all the women there that he was gay.  It was funny cuz he got so mad at her.  Then we shopped some and came home.  I layed down for awhile then Jenna called and said ""lets go see Grease"", so I jumped in the shower and went.  You guys did an awesome job in that play.  It was really good.  Then we went to Partner's but they were closing so we went in to use the restroom and talked to a few folks for a little bit then went to Ruby Tuesday's with Keith, Seth, The french boys, Nick, and Dayna.  After that we went to Seth's.  I drank some.  It was a lot of fun.  Then today we got up and chilled.  Everyone had hang overs but me cuz I didnt get sick.  Then we went to Quizno's and back to Seth's.  We layed around all day cuz everyone was really tired cuz we didnt go to bed till like 5 a.m. hehe.  Then we all went our separate ways and me, keith, seth, and dayna all went to see spiderman 2.  Awesome movie but kinda dragged out.  It was just a little too long.  But i think there will be a 3rd.  Then we chilled at Seth's and watched Ice Age.  Now I am at home and really really tired.  By the way...me and Keith are a lot better now.  We talked about everything and he appologized a million times and junk.  THANK GOD!! Well, i'm out for the night.  Good night journal..see ya tomorrow!!

"event","Yesterday when I got done babysitting I went home and played aggravation.  Ha..told you I love that game.  Then I went to the pool with the french boys and met Gina and Justin there.  We sat and talked about tons of stuff..like back in the day junk, and what we are gonna do with our lives.  For some reason that is the topic with everyone I have spoken to.  We are all talking about college, and how it sucks to leave Newnan, even tho we are bored as crap when we are here.  But truely I will miss this place and all the people in it.  Anyways..then I went home and ran errands for my mom.  I got my 311 ticket..so for all of those people that are trying to tell everyone that lawn seats are sold out...THEY AREN'T SO GET OVER IT!!!..lol..so just go get your ticket and have fun there.  Then I went home played more aggravation and ate dinner.  I was gonna go hang out at Justin's but I ended up falling asleep after I got ready and slept till this morning when I had to get up and come babysit.  Well, I think we are gonna go bowling soon so I will update you later!! Peace up, A town Down!! lol

"event","Well, last night I went bowling and it was a lot of fun.  We had to catch up on a lot of things with Meg Dar cuz she has been at UGA this summer.  I missed her so much and I'm gonna miss her so much next year.  She was clueless about so much that has happened just over the summer..it was amazing tho.  And we laughed so much about all of our old times with volleyball.  I love them girls!!  It ended up being me, Ash Renee, Alex, Apanda, John, Meg Dar, Jessica, and Keith, Seth, Alyson, Cali, and Caroline stopped by.  Bowling is kinda fun tho.  You should try it sometime.  So afterwards we went to Michael Patterson's party.  It wasn't to big at first but then a little more people showed up.  I went and s----- with Stanton, Jenna, and Alex.  That was fun.  I'm guessing you could probably guess what that is.  Then we went back.  We chilled and then decided to go kill some frogs.  Well, I didn't cuz that doesn't seem like fun. So I just chilled in the truck with John and we talked about college and stuff.  I realized that I am really nervous/scared/sad about college.  But hey..i'll make it.  Then me, alex, john, and jess went to waffle house.  It was so fun.  But my waffle was burnt and I didn't want to say anything.  Our waitress was the nicest lady in the world and she said she was working three jobs to pay for her son's college in Savannah.  It's called SCAD.  Well our whole bill was 7.11 and we left like 15.00 for her.  We probably made her night.  Anyways I finally made it home at about 3:45 a.m. and hit the sheets.  I got up this morning and came to babysit.  That's what I'm doing now..fun fun.  Well, I'm out for now..I really didn't think I would type this much..but hey get over it.  Peace out journal.  I'll let you know more later.

Today I had to babysit again and I came home and went shopping for college stuff...hmm..College..Its so close I can't believe this summer is almost over. I'm gonna miss everyone so much.  I won't even have my best friend around..Alex I love you and I will miss you!!! Ok enough of that blabbing.  I gotta get in the shower and go shopping some more for more college stuff..aaahhhh its coming so soon.  Then dinner with Keith and his family then I'm going bowling with some of the most awesomest people...Alex, Megan Darrah (my role model) Apanda, Jenna, Stanton, and John.

Here goes: So far my day has been kinda boring but alright.  I got up early from Cali's house and had to go babysit the cutest little boy.  He is only 5 months old tho. so it kinda got annoying.  Then I came home and chilled with my mom, ran an errand for her and chilled some more.  Keith came over and we played aggravation with my mom..wow do I love that game!!  I get so into it..hehe. Well, now I'm just sitting here. I'll let you know if anything interesting happens in my life. Till next time!!

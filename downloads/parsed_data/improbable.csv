"event","Alright, I am wearing maternity jeans for the first time today, as I am officially sized out of my last pair of pants, at 22+ weeks. (For those readers who will never do this or never have, when I lie down now, it feels like I have a basketball in my abdomen. A wriggly basketball.) I spent the summer reading NPR's blog ""The Baby Project,"" since, suddenly, it had something to do with my own experience. (I don't guess NPR is going to re-do the project, leaving me to post about the indignities here in a familiar setting.) One of the pregnant commenters recommended just going ahead and moving into maternity clothes, since they are comfortable. I'm not sure, myself.

I have figured out that the real mechanism keeping these pants up is supposed to be one's front profile, but mine is kind of shallow right now, and it's not fulfilling the purpose. So for the time being, I'm dealing with the constant sensation that my pants are sliding down. I hope it improves. (Dear Old Navy, please consider making maternity jeans in something other than 'skinny' or 'flare.' What would be wrong about a nice trouser style?)

Despite how popular leggings and tunic tops have been for 15 years, I never actually wore an outfit like this. But leggings are now my dear friends."

"event","I was on an elliptical machine at the gym this morning, in front of a bank of television screens. I had music occupying my ears, but my eyes were free to take in headlines from the various cable news stations. Though I mostly focused on CNN, I did catch the talking heads on Fox News supposedly discussing whether the weekend's killing of OBL means the president is now free to order assasinations.

I am not surprised if the station's editors are just now discovering the possible threat of unchecked executive power, but this has been bothering me ever since: where do they get off calling it an assasination?

Just to make sure, I looked up the definition, which says ""the murder of an important person for religious or political reasons."" In backwards order, I don't think the reasons were political because the objective was not to effect any particular change, or any change that is particularly likely. I think the objective was simply to eliminate one person. I reject that there were any religious reasons. And as for important, the guy wasn't the head of a state, running for office, affiliated with a state or carrying out something important for a state (like being a scientist for the nuclear program). That's usually what I think of as being important enough that one's death gets labeled an assasination. Important is kind of a value judgement; I'm sure he was important to a good many people, but there have to be some guidelines.

This person, on the other hand, was the target, stated openly, of military capture or killing by a state, for almost a decade. If everyone in the world knows that if a certain nation finds you, they'll shoot you, then I think it's a killing, not an assasination. It seems to me that to see the killing of OBL as an assasination, you'd have to take the following fictional description in stride: ""FBI agents raided the compound today of a multi-state human trafficking ring and assasinated the head of the criminal organization."" It sound weird to me.

And at any rate, wasn't the time for this discussion nine years ago when the <i>former</i> president declared this person wanted dead or alive? I think it's somewhat debatable that the current president ordered the killing rather than authorized the operation that put a previously established U.S. policy into effect. But that is just semantics. In the end, what bothers me is that the news station feels free to the scariest set of words it has to gin up emotion instead of the appropriate words to describe events."

"event","The local public radio station is having an interminably long pledge drive. It mostly seems long because the local pledge-drummers have voices best suited for print, Southern ladies from the junior auxillary league of voting daughters of the confederacy, who seem to be tapping their social networks for funds on-air. I hope the station's audience extends further than this. It's a good station, but I had to turn it down in the car when today's lady started telling us how her cat listens to NPR during the day.

Jason sent in our donation yesterday. He said, ""Actually, I considered telling them on the phone that our dogs hear the station for most of the day. I would have had to point out, though, that it hasn't made them any smarter or willing to discuss current affairs. I guess it's only so good."""

"event","There's a tiny beer/wine bar in town that is all the rage. J and I have wanted to visit it for a while now. We cruised past it on the weekend, daunted by the crowd that poured out the front door onto the patio and obstructed the street. So we tried a weeknight, last night, instead.

The reason for the crowd is that the place is quite small, and the reason we had to drive over the center line to avoid hitting some of the patrons is because the tiny street has no sidewalks. The area of town is an up-and-coming former warehouse district near the train tracks, so it wasn't set up with concern for the nightlife of people with disposable income.

The place lived up to its reviews; it's very comfortable. J and I got a tray of 5 samples of the beers on tap (Barkeep: ""Do you want to choose, or you want me to?"" Jason: ""Make one of them <i>Old Rasputin</i>, and you can choose the rest."")

Relocating always involves a period of isolation, and J and I are smack in the middle of it. We've been feeling a little sorry for ourselves lately, which is natural. In Lexington, I basically let Jason make our friends for us, because a work-a-day job doesn't necessarily make that easy. So as we sat there, at a place we'd never been before, someone waved and said hi to Jason, and Jason did the same in return. It was one of his regular customers from the coffee shop. ""You are doing your magic!"" I said, remembering how Lexington had shaped up just that way, with people recognizing him in places all over town."

"event","The public library in my former city seems to have been better endowed than the public library in my current location, judging by the extent of the catalog. I'm a big fan of putting books on hold, but I'm often looking for them after reading a review in a paper or magazine. Several times, this hasn't worked for me, but I haven't yet resorted to inter-library loan.

I checked out ""The Israel Lobby"" this week. Ordinarily, if I consider not taking a book with me out in public, it's because the book is a romance novel. This one I considered reading at home just because it was so controversial and would attract attention. Sure enough, on our first outing, I sat at the coffee counter this morning beside Jason (who was reading a book about covert CIA actions in foreign countries). A man who carried what appeared to be a draft manuscript remarked, ""If you're reading 'The Israel Lobby,' you might be interested in __________, who is speaking at FSU on the 14th."" (I wasn't familiar with the speaker, and now I'm unable to remember the name.)

I switched my work hours from 8-5 to 9-6 this week. After the time change, I realized that the only usable hours of the day for walking around outside are going to be in the morning, for about the next six months. If I'm going to be sequestered inside, it might as well be when there's no better alternative. My schedule change has a positive side effect: our usual coffee shop is definitely open after 8 am.

It's technically supposed to be open every morning at 7 am. But sometimes the owner is late. Sometimes we get there around 7:20 and the door is open but there's no coffee ready (in which case we are sold americanos for the price of drip coffee). But generally, even when the door is open, the lights are on, and the coffee is already dripped, the owner is still stomping around and grumbling like... someone in need of coffee. Serious grousing. (I did mention to Jason that the owner could just change the sign on the door to 7:30 and solve this problem.)

So this morning, for the second time in a row, Jason and I arrived for the theoretical *second* open hour (8 to 9 am), to perch on our usual stools. Indeed, the owner is more congenial at this later hour. He made one of his customary references to being late with the coffee because customers followed him in the door and prevented him from setting up, but that he couldn't be crotchety to strangers. I turned to Jason and threw him a line under my breath, ""Yeah, because he's usually just like a cuddly teddy bear."""

Truthfully, we spent the last 4+ years allowing the already-terrible wood floors to continue deteriorating, so I had no idea that wood soap might make such a difference in the appearance.

We had also, recently, rearranged the bedroom furniture to block my dog Bert's access to the window that overlooks our neighbor's back yard, where, while we were gone, he could bark the whole time that Coco, the Rottweiler puppy, was in the yard.

Each time, we thought, how could we have waited this long to figure this out? Especially since we're leaving this apartment behind in another two weeks.

Yes, make fun, but those packets of instant coffee are all that stand between me and the office coffee, which like almost all coffee in this geographical region, is thin and sour.

(Where in the devil does she work, you may be asking yourself. I could spit and hit a Starbucks. If you were my husband, you'd do exactly that, but that's another story. The answer is, I work in a sizeable city with a mall, many stores and shopping centers, a military base nearby, and two school systems. Yet, the only serious coffee is tucked into a Barnes and Noble on the main strip about 5 miles on the other side of town.)

I was contemplating coffee from the McDonald's when I spied a sign that never caught my attention before, which said there is a Dunkin' Donuts at the exit five miles before my own. Yippee, thought I, because if it's a real DD, they can throw extra ""espresso"" into my coffee, and even so, I don't recall the coffee being that bad. (Possibly an error in recollection. I used to drink greater quantities of weaker coffee. I'm so much more efficient about it now.)

But no, it was actually a Pilot truck stop that serves a few DD donuts and makes DD coffee in big urns labeled ""classic brew"" and ""decaf."" The coffee is just as bad as any around here. It's most prominent feature is ... hot. (And the cruller was soggy, but that just serves me right.)

This is false advertising, is it not? Just as all service stations with logos appearing on one of those blue exit signs should have public restrooms, I think a Dunkin Donuts logo should not be on an exit sign if there is no actual DD there.

You may be thinking that I'm in a bad mood for someone who's got a three-day weekend starting in six hours. But that's just how important the morning coffee is. Maybe when the Barnes and Noble/Starbucks is open, I'll make the trip across town for a cup."

Then a month ago, my plans changed, so I called to cancel the reservation. Well, the weekend of the reservation came and went, and I got a bill in the mail saying that I'd been charged for the stay because I hadn't canceled it. Well, I called the place today to insist that I had canceled, by phone, but the whole time, I was aware that I had no proof or ammunition in case I was challenged on this, and it made me feel shaky, scuzzy, vulnerable. I actually had to remind myself that I really did call to cancel and that I was in the right on this, even if they did have an empty room on a festival weekend. The woman on the phone asked if I'd gotten an e-mail to confirm the cancellation; I did recognize this as a red herring: if I didn't get an e-mail, it was still their failure, and if I did get an e-mail, then I probably wouldn't have this problem. ""Who did you talk to?"" ""I don't remember; whoever answered the phone."" At one point, she said something like if I didn't get an email, then someone didn't get the call, and I corrected her, ""Someone *did* get my call; I just didn't get an email."" At any rate, the charge is being refunded, so I got what I needed. The moral of the story is to write down the dates you call and names of people that you talk to when you're doing anything that involves money."

And J's cousin made us wonderful breakfasts. J started finding his way around the neighborhood quickly, as he always does, so we drove to Alexandria's Old Town on Saturday afternoon. On Saturday night, we went out with J's family to a French restaurant, and they showed us parts of the Del Ray neighborhood where J's grandmother grew up.

On Sunday, J and I went out to Bolling Air Force Base to attend the picnic event which was the true reason for the weekend. Despite our negative reactions to walking into a big party full of complete strangers, we steeled ourselves and mingled for all we were worth. And J did get some good advice about intelligence or analysis work in overlooked agencies. The picnic tent was right on the river, with the Washington Monument visible in the distance on the opposite side. The fireworks display was pretty. (I just can't believe the show ended with a terrible orchestral version of ""Proud To Be An American,"" which is a song that has always set my teeth on edge.)

Traffic was heavy on Monday, coming back to Lexington. We failed to arrive in town soon enough to spring the dogs from the kennel, so I had to make a trip back home on Tuesday to pick them up.

Now, it's nice to get a job in which one has wide latitude to determine how to fulfill the basic directives. I've been enjoying it, but I keep hitting moments of epiphany, in which I suddenly realize things I think I should have known before now.

It's a series of small things, such as, don't panic about the public health interventions before you fulfill the case definition (i.e. don't take the doctor's word for it, they may be wrong). Don't waste time working with the health information departments of large urban hospitals when you can just call the infection control person (although what I dislike about this cheat is that the ICP is generally a very busy person aside from fielding calls from public health departments); i.e. deal with the system as it actually is instead of the way I think it should function.

It's frustrating, in every case, to realize I might have spent months doing something the hard way, when I find the easier or correct way. But as I write this, I realize that this is job experience; no wonder it is so valued and not easily replaced by education."

This time, though, the temperature is comfortably below freezing, which makes matters simpler. Plus, the snow held off until everyone with more sense than a turnip was tucked in at home for the weekend with extra groceries (for those with homes, of course). J and I hooked Bert up to a leash and put fresh tracks in the snow from our house to the coffee shop this morning. On the main street, snow plows had piled the snow many inches deep on the sidewalk, so there was a lot of trudging involved. Then I played a game of fetch in the back yard with Bert and a rubber squeaky teddy bear. It's the first time in a long time I've figured out how to make Bert tired. Now I'm at the library trying to fight the paralysis that plagues me on my research project."

It's generally a relaxing drive along the parkway (although there was a snowy early morning last week that served to remind me that bridges freeze more quickly than roads...), if a long one.

The commute is changing our existence again. I'm about to cut the internet connection to the house, because neither of us uses it enough to justify the enormous monthly fee. I spend my weekends glad to be away from a computer, and J hates them all of the time. When we were debating this, I pointed out that we've got a desktop computer that will become less useful. J responded, ""You're concentrating on the sunk cost. In economics, this is called 'throwing good money after bad.'""

I'm also giving up my personal phone in favor of the work-provided one, because I can hardly be trusted to answer it. Our household is becoming distinctly retrograde in the brave new digital world, but it comes at a time when privation is fashionable anyway.

So let's count the amenities we do without at my ""weekend home"": dishwasher, washer/dryer, internet, television, microwave... and I can hardly wait to get there."

My Monday-morning commute is long-distance, over an hour. Until this morning, it's been mostly in the dark. Today, the sun was up when I started out of Lexington, and it was nice to be able to see the scenery as I drove. The moon looked full and almost orange in the light blue sky, hanging low above the trees.

Our neighborhood has several large trees that are meeting places for huge congregations of soon-to-fly-south birds, who gather at dusk to go over the travel itinerary, I imagine. Hundreds of them, swooping in, all chittering at once. It's one of my favorite fall sights.

"event","I find myself with time on my hands, so let me fill you in on the latest. I do have a job, a real one, in my field, that I'm enjoying. In fact, it's six weeks in, and I'm still charmed at having an office. With a door. And a thermostat. And a window. And two computer monitors. For a computer onto which I've already downloaded EndNote and SAS (cheaply, because I am a student. Yay: discount!)

It's hard to tell what the job is like during a regular time, because so much of what I'm doing right now is focused on influenza. Last week, I got to be on a local radio show as a guest to talk about it, and tomorrow I will be on a panel of speakers at a community event in one of the 7 counties that make up my district.

The harsh part is the commute. I didn't give up the apartment in Lexington, because J needs it, it's good for the dogs, and it's ultra-cheap. But I couldn't drive for over 1.5 hours each way every day and maintain any sanity. So I'm staying with a friend in a town that's only about 40 minutes away from my job during the week. It's free, and I don't have to set up a new household. Although I have slowly duplicated stuff like make-up, hair stuff, pajamas, etc. And I mostly leave my work clothes in the closet.

I think the most interesting realization I've had so far, after leaving an environment in which I was a student surrounded by people in my field and moved to a place where I'm a professional surrounded by non-scientists is that the job itself confers authority on it's holder. In a knowledge sense, not a directive sense (I don't supervise anyone.). When I answer a question with information about flu, or legionellosis, or what to do in this situation or that, people <i>take my word for it.</i> I don't have to try and sell it; it must be right because I'm the person who would know. Fascinating. Of course, I am careful to be right, such as I can be."

The one issue that is a real thorn is the long commute that I'm doing. I arrived back in the country with one week to work out where to live before starting work, but I also had a to-do list.

Today, he attracted some attention. I heard the newspaper stand, to which his leash was wrapped, rattle and start to travel. So I dashed out with my coffee, but it was ok. He was trying to get closer to a woman who wanted to pet him. Fortunately, he chose a professional. I could tell by the side approach she performed. She's a volunteer at a local kennel, daycare and training place in town.

While we had a conversation, Bert ultimately got pet by several people. One of my co-workers asked where my other dog was, and I responded that the other one is very reactive and can't come along on coffee runs. The volunteer said there are classes with a professional trainer at her place just for dogs like that. It's something to think about when I have ready money.

Besides admiring Bert's good looks, she admired his age and nature. We agreed that we love middle-aged dogs best, because that's when they become good companions."

"event","<lj-cut text=""On the heels of my drive back from Atlanta, I drove out to the far western part of Kentucky."">Today was an all-day marathon of driving. I spent the night in Horse Cave with family, so I left their house at 7 am to make an 11 am appointment. According to Google maps, the drive from Hart County to Graves County takes just over 3 hours. So both ways, and counting the interview, It took nine hours. And then I was so tired and eager to be in my own space that I got back in the car to drive to Lexington without waiting for my Dad to get home and buy me dinner.

It was a job interview. For a type of job I'd like to have and money that I'd work for, even though the requirements are less than what I've got. And it's a step into the field. And it would be a job. In this economy.

But there are two huge drawbacks. First, the job is in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfield,_Kentucky"" target=""new"">very small city</a>**. And it is very far away. Second, (and possibly because of reason one), the posting keeps attracting people who leave it after a short time. I enjoyed talking to the district director, but he acknowledged that they are often having to fill the job and he was really hoping someone would stay for 2 to 3 years. Maybe this won't be my decision to make, but I can't promise that kind of commitment, so I suddenly felt bad passing myself off as the best candidate.

** ""By the way, why are you the only district that has two administrative offices?"" I asked. (The other is in Paducah, the largest city in the district.) Turns out, the reason is largely a historical artifact.

So I'll know sometime next week what they're thinking.</lj-cut>"

"event","Home again, home again, jiggity jig. It's been a long end of semester.

Finals week, aside from the actual taking of finals, was spent getting Jason ready to leave for Vietnam. We spent the weekend in Atlanta, and I dropped him yesterday at the airport. He will probably get where he's going sometime tonight.

I'm leaving the dogs in the kennel for another two days because I've got to drive out to Paducah for an interview on Wednesday. By the time they spent two months looking over applications, I'd just about talked myself out of that job, so now I'm not sure how I feel about it.

And I'm treating the Scion to a check-up and oil change in the morning."

"event","I bought, about 3 weeks ago, the last turkey breast from the Kroger on Romany Road that was being sold for $0.75 per pound. Since then, it's been in the freezer until I decided what to do. We don't own a roasting pan; I considered buying one. Then I found a recipe for cooking it in the crock pot, but I have a 4-quart model. To fit the turkey in with the apples, leeks, lemon zest and parsley, Jason had to cleave most of the meat from from bones and stack it that way. So I boiled the remainder; I now have packets of turkey and 3 jars of something that should be broth but is more like beige liquid. (It barely even produced fat.) So today I made gravy, as per instructions, to go with the turkey, which is necessary because the turkey itself is v.v. dry. After tasting the gravy, I boiled it longer, added salt, and doubled the butter/flour. I'm boiling up the rest of the wild rice we had in the apartment to go with. Most of the dishes in the kitchen are dirty. J. says the gravy is fantastic, but on the whole, I'm not sure yet that 75-cent turkey is worth the trouble."

"event","I'm trying to talk Jason into having a <i>bon voyage</i> party on Thursday of next week. He doesn't realize it, but his pals would consider it wrong if he basically sneaked out of town for the summer.

I've ignored my paranoia about inviting people over to an apartment in which the toilet is sometimes ambivalent about flushing, which is chief among the reasons we've avoided entertaining in the past. Another reason is the dogs, which would already be at the kennel by then. Then there's the cost of food; I think I could put out cheese straws and pigs in blankets for a reasonable price. The price of drinks: Jason's friends bring their own beer and bourbon wherever they go; very handy. What if it gets loud? These undergrads have been keeping us awake every weekend for the last month; we owe them some shouting on the front lawn, I replied. Besides, half of them are moving out at the end of the week.

So it came down to the fact that Jason doesn't like having lots of people walking around his house. ""Are you kidding me?!?"" I said<strike>, gently</strike>.

Yesterday, I spent over 3 hours editing his 24-page paper on the OAS and democracy promotion in South America. I think we are go for the party because I am owed considerably."

"event","The guy who fixes our house when it's broken came over this morning. He'd fixed the leak in our shower earlier in the week, but left us unable to turn on the hot water because the part of the pipe that screws into the handle was stripped beyond use (and he didn't realize that at the time). So Jason ""showered"" by pouring pitchers of hot water over his head, (""It isn't the first time that it's proved convenient to be able to reach the bathroom sink taps from the shower."") and I actually showed up to the gym on a regular basis.

We have the shower back again now, but he'll need to return to put in another valve. He couldn't turn off the main water to the house without the use of a 2-foot turning bar because we've got a very old-fashioned water meter installed under the house. ""Our apartment really is just made of playing cards, isn't it?"" I said to Jason."

"event","J and I had to do a complete re-install on the home computer last night, which was frustrating and long. It was uneventful, except for the part in which I couldn't get the sound to come back on and had to call customer support for help. We had caught a virus that used our computer to send spam (Ugh -- feel dirty) and got our ISP to shut off our access until I called to touch base with them.

The frustrating and long part had more to do with the way a lost evening derails the schedule of step-wise accomplishments, which are stacked up like so many teetering blocks.

And so, when its function was restored (except for reinstalling the Office suite), we started the next-to-last episode of the first season of ""Dexter."" I could have gotten to bed at a reasonable hour if we'd stopped then, but I couldn't deal with the cliffhanger, so we went ahead and watched the last episode in the season. In for a dime, in for a dollar."

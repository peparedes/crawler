"event","i wish i was little again, when the biggest decision you have to make is what toy u want to play with next and the biggest upset is a scraped knee.  I remeber i used to hysterically cry if i got so much as a bruise when i was little...blood has always scared me...i dunno why it jut does...i want to be carefree agian, now all i hear pple sayin is what are u goin to do in the future,  my parents keep buggin me about my grades, they r so annoyin sumtimes, all i wanna do is have fun, n maybe thas selfish but i think that we should live each moment, seize it, really see it, hold on to it and never give it back."

"event","Have you ever noticed that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you can never have them, when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips you miss them? Have you ever wondered which hurts the most: saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had? I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say. They are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them; words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head...to no more than living size when they are brought out. Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. If you do, they might break your heart, but if you don't, you might break theirs. Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person? Your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't. You can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to. Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you? Too many of us stay closed up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all. Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever? Or fell for your best friend in the entire world, and then stay around and watched them fall for someone else? Have you ever denied you feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle? Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump. Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have, or could have had. No one waits forever... 
i wish i could say i was that person for when it really mattered..."

"event","You have a vivid imagination and this is good. Great inventors, explorers all had inventive, imaginative minds. Your friends and acquaintances may consider you over-imaginative and given to fantasy or day-dreaming. So what ?... this is a part of your character and charm. 

Always anxious to accept the role of the leader, as indeed you often work well with people, but try to stay out of the limelight. You'd like a life of ease with no one to rock the boat... and someone who understands you is so important in your life...

You are prepared to establish a particular relationship that is being made available to you at this time...it could be a satisfactory liaison...but there could be a certain amount of conflict involved...try to avoid direct confrontation at all costs... 

From every direction there appears to be unwarranted restrictions on your freedom of action and this is producing considerable stress..You're really looking for independence and freedom from any restriction and therefore avoiding any obligations or anything which might prove hampering. You are being subjected to considerable pressures and you would like nothing better than to escape from them, but you tend to lack the necessary strength of purpose to succeed in this. Whichever way you turn you are being frustrated. You need to be free to do your ""thing"" in your own way...

You are anxious about all the limitations to which you are subjected to at this time.... You feel that you are not valued for what or who you are. You need OUT. So why procrastinate any longer .... MOVE!

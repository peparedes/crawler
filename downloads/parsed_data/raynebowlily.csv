"event","Did she die of heartache?  Her son, her best friend...the only family she really had died.  And now 5 months later so is she.  Was it the trim spa?  Did she kill herself?  Was she sick?  Soon we will find out.  She was radiant, beautiful, funny, she had her own character and sense of style.  If I was not so depressed with myself she would be my role model.  She was very strong.  Man I feel so bad for Howard Stern.  He has been so close to her and Daniel.  He has been in love with her forever, regardless whether the marriage was to protect Dannilynn.  This is so sad.  Its like it takes away from life.  Shes gone.  Man I swear  I dont understand life.  I dont understand why we live to die.  And the thing is it hurts everyone.  Everyone is sad.  That is such a horrible emotion.  But I am told not to question God.  I dont mean to, I just want to know.  I want a better understanding as to why someone who was once so joyous to someone has to become a painful memory."

"event","I have not been on in a long time and its kind of sad reading my last entry.  In the middle of June I ended up having a miscarriage.  I went to the emergency room because I wasnt feeling right and I wanted to get another sonogram done. They discovered there was nothing moving in the sac.  Plus it was much smaller than it should have been.  At that time  I should have been 11 weeks, but 3 weeks previous the sac only looked 5.5 weeks.  So they did a D&C and I swear my body has not felt the same since I went under.  I woke up and my whole body hurt so bad.  They said it would go away.  5 months later and I am still in pain.  My doctor recently diagnosed me with Fibromyalgia.  He thinks the miscarriage triggered it.  Everyday is really hard.  I was on short term disability, but Metlife decided to cut that off.  I have recently resigned from VZW because I cant work.  So my next step is to hopefully get SSI, but I need to find a good lawyer for that.  I can see why a lot of people with fibromyalgia suffer from depression.  The daily pain is bad enough, but then to have to deal with the fact that you cant do anything.  I feel less than, like I am a burden on my girl.  She says I am not, and I know that if it was her in this position I would not feel like she was, but I cant help it.  Plus, when we try again, are all of my symptoms going to get worse with pregnancy or will it get better?  Will I be able to lift my child?  Will I have the strength I need for a child?  I know the answer to all of this, but I cant imagine not having children.  This weather really is not helping matters at all.  Man I tell you, I really have been going through a lot these past months and the thing is there is still so much that I know I need to deal with that I have not yet allowed myself to think about...."

"event","I have been so busy and so tired...Between moving and working and being pregnant I have really been worn out!  But I am not complaining.  It is so amazing to grow a living being inside of you.  Everyday I stop and look at my fiance and say ""Baby...We are pregnant."" Here I am a different woman.  I dont want to talk bad about my past because it was what it was and yes I am thankful it is over.  Because this whole time the person I should have been with was always there.  But we know each other WELL...And there is no question about my future with her.  Just like her nickname she is absolutely PERFECT.  We are so happy and so in love.  And we are bringing a baby into the world together.  She loves me so much and it feels so good.  I get excited everyday when I wake up next to her.  I could cry everyday when we have to be apart at work.  And yes this is how I always feel...not just the hormones...lol.  So far my pregnancy has been great.  My only main symptom is being tired.  Thanks to my wife and my sister they take the all day sickness.  But everyone around me is so supportive.  I am so excited.  But aside from his beautiful baby coming into the world.  I have a wedding to plan.  That is some hard work.  But the main thing is a place.  I want to do it in a hotel, but they want to do the food.  Heck no. I dont like hotel food.  Except the Crowne Plaza in Philly.   Man that was the greatest birthday weekend ever!  Anyway...I better get off of here and walk this puppy before she looses it on my floor!"

"event","Wow!  It has been awhile since I have been on.  But alot has been going on in my world.  My baby bought me a puppy.  She is absolutely gorgous.  She is suppose to be an Alaskan Husky/Malamute mix, but the older she gets, we think its more of a husky/lab or husky/beagle.  I dont know, but we are going to take her to the vet.  She has really kept my hands full.  Training has been an adventure, but my little pup is coming along.  All she does is follow me around, no matter what.  I can walk to the trash and she is right there next to me.  But my baby and I figured out why she is so protective of me.......I AM PREGNANT!  I am so excited.  My fiance and I cannot believe it.  We took some tests, well I should say a lot of test the past 2 days and surprisingly they all came back positive.  So I went to my doctor and got a blood test and low and behold, we are expecting a little one.  But to also top that off we are getting ready to move out of the place we are in.  The apartment hunting went really smooth.  Actually the first apartment we saw we fell in love with.  But we will remain here for about a year or so and off to Georgia we go.  So the next year I will have a lot to plan.  Not only my wedding 07/07/07 but also my babies arrival. ETD 01/02/07.   So this is really now my venting post.  My breasts hurt and I am tired.  My hat goes off to every woman who has given birth.  I am having the hardest time making it through an eight hour day.  My girl wants me to have another one soon after.  Who am I? Britney Spears?  I dont know about that.  My sister agrees it is the best time, but we will see.  I will be a full time housewife/mommy so its not like I wont have the time on my hands, but dag lets get through the first one...lol!  But I just woke up from my 4 hour nap and it is time to catch some more sleep!  Ta Ta For Now!!

"event","I dont know what has been going on with me lately.  I have been restless.  Like today I got off from work about 1.  And I have the whole day ahead of me, but no matter what i decide to do, its not going to satisfy me.  I want to do something different.  Like what if every 6 months you had to move and take on a different job?  I am getting bored with my job.  I still have not found out about the other position I interviewed for.  Maybe all in all I am getting bored with myself."

"event","OK, I DONT KNOW IF I HAVE JUST BEEN SITTING AT HOME ALONE TOO LONG BY MYSELF (5 hours and 46 mins to be exact). BUT I AM THINKING ABOUT MY WEDDING AND HOW I WANT MY CEREMONY TO GO.  WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT TIME AND WHERE BUT THE ACTUAL CEREMONY.  THEN I THINK ABOUT THE LESBIAN WEDDINGS I HAVE BEEN TO AND THE CONVERSATIONS I HAVE WITH LESBIANS ABOUT THEIR ""DREAM"" WEDDING.  AND MOST PEOPLE TELL ME THE SAME THING...THAT THEY DONT WANT TO DO THE SAME WEDDING AS STRAIGHTS AND THEY DONT WANT TO BE IN A CHURCH blah blah blah.  AND I ONCE FELT THE SAME WAY UNTIL RECENTLY (5 mins ago).  IF MY GIRL AND I WERE TO MOVE TO MA AND GET MARRIED, THEY WOULD PERFORM THE SAME CEREMONY AS THEY DO FOR STRAIGHTS.  YOU GO TO THE COURT HOUSE AND APPLY FOR THE LICENSE, THEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT LIKE 24 HOURS-3 DAYS BEFORE THEY WILL MARRY YOU.  YOU HAVE TO GO BACK PICK UP THE LICENSE AND THEN THEY PULL YOU IN A ROOM AND SAY THE FAMOUS ""WE ARE GATHERED HER TODAY..."" SO WHEN LESBIANS DECIDE TO BE SO CALLED ""DIFFERENT"" ARE YOU REALLY CONSIDERED MARRIED?  I LIVE IN MARYLAND AND I REALLY DONT SEE MYSELF MOVING TO MA OR CA OR HI.  SO UNTIL MARYLAND DECIDES WE CAN GET MARRIED, I WILL HAVE MY WEDDING THE TRANDITIONAL WAY, EXCEPT NOT IN A CHURCH.  AND WHEN PEOPLE SAY MARRIAGE IS JUST A PIECE OF PAPER, I THINK THEY HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED TRUE LOVE.  BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE, YOU WANT THE RIGHTS THAT PUT YOU A STEP ABOVE BLOOD. ONCE YOU ARE MARRIED, THAT PERSON BECOMES YOUR NEW FAMILY.  YOUR FIRST PRIORITY, AND THAT IS HOW SOCIETY LOOKS AT IT.  IF I WAS MARRIED TO A MAN AND HAD TONS OF MONEY AND NO WILL, IT WOULD GO TO MY HUBAND AND NOT MY MOM.  SO TO ME, YES I WANT THAT PIECE OF PAPER AND YES I WANT A TRADITIONAL WEDDING!!"

I also found out today that my ex cheated on me a month before i kicked her out.  I once felt bad for falling in love with someone else so soon, but now i dont.  I am glad i never took her back and I am glad I got her out of my life when I did.  She did nothing but hold me back from life.  I just feel bad for her current girlfriend.  But who cares about all of that.  On to bigger and better things...like my ass.  Have you ever gone to sleep and woke up and something was much bigger on you then the day before.  Yeah well say Hello To Miss New Booty!!!  LOL  I would show a picture of it, but I think my girl would kill me.  lol...Well its off to work for me.  April is a very exciting month...I will find out about the position i just interviewed for, i get a raise and our wedding was suppose to be this month.  But since she has me so spoiled, I decided I wanted to wait a year and have the wedding i have been dreaming about, instead on having to settle for a location I dont want.  Besides I really want my mom to help me out with the arrangments.  BYE BYE FOR NOW!!"

I was putting on makeup before i went out tonight and so i was sitting on my bathroom countertop to get closer to the mirror and what do you know...I was sitting on a tube of toothpaste the entire time; not only did i waste the whole tube but i got it on my pants. Toothpaste is pretty gross and hard to clean up when its all gooey and not dried yet so i just wiped it all up with a towel. yea...i couldnt put the towel in the laundry so i just threw the whole thing away. maybe my mom wont notice. ahahahahhaha :D

Yea so i look for my parents, and they weren't home. I called their cell phones and they had both left them home. Hmm yea two hours later they came home, from <b>food shopping</b>. The streets were totally flooded with 4 feet of water, there are trees in the street, power lines down, winds at like 60 miles an hour, and my parents are out grocery shopping. pfff

so they came home and we watched the news. The whole thing passed in like a few hours...not that bad.

After that i sat around some more and watched tv. My life.

Tomorrow I have school. How exciting. So yea my one month of summer is finally over; and it went by so fast..

haah yea, and everyday i get the same questions:
<b>How is NC?
You going to the same school as the Erbs?
Are you okay from the hurricane?</b>

North Carolina sucks, Still sucks, Will always suck. I have no friends.

No, I live basically on the other side of town from the Erbs, we aren't going to the same high school.

"event","Las night me and Dana went to Dave's house. As we were driving there it started to rain and when we pulled up to his house he was standing outside with two umbrellas, one for each of us. He's such a <b>gentleman</b>.<3333


Ugh god Nicole called like 5 times at 9 this morning to wake me up. I finally got up at 9:40 when De called.

Took a shower and then went to the WoodBridge Mall.

I was really short on cash. I had a 5 dollar bill, which I used to buy lunch, and a gift card with $18.87 on it.

I bought a sub, two bags of chips, a cookie, two shirts, and a pair of underwear.

After the mall we went to Marshall's to get some other stuff. <b>Hahah we had some good times there.</b>

After that we dropped Dana and Deanna off and then Nicole and I went to chill with Jon and Ryan. We found them at Austin's house in his pool, even though Austin was at the beach.

Nicole also pushed me in the shallow end when I was bending over to sick my hands in. So then I pushed her in and then Ryan had to push me in all the way. So I just went in with my clothes.

Had to ride home soaking wet and now I am home.
Going to Dana's house soon after I shower.

Hmm....."

Caroline also left this morning and I didn't get to see her.

So I sat home all day and then took a nap bc I went to sleep at like 6 the night before.

Nicole and De went back to the movies, so it was just me and Dana last night.

We just chilled with some people.

Today, I am going to the beach with Dana and Noelle and staying down for the little Driftwood Sleepover they have every year.

Fun. Fun.

Ugh, God and I don't know why I am soo sore all over. I don't do anything..hah"

"event","So yesterday was 7/11. 7 11 Day. Also Momma Frangipane's Birthday!!<33

Woke up around 11:30 when Nicole called me to go to the beach with her and Dana. We stopped by the 7 11 in Little Silver, haha it was crazy in there.

After that we went to the 7 11 in Sea Bright, but it <b>sucked</b>. hha there was nothing there. But I was hungry so I bought some cheese cubes<33

Blah Blah we did what we usually do at the beach.

We walked down towards Ship Ahoy and as we were walking we past Sea Bright Beach Club and I saw a kid with bright red hair that kind of looked like Alex Henderson. So I was like 'Hey, Alex goes to this beach club.' So yea we kept walking and then of course I spotted some <b>CUTE</b> boys. hahaha and I saw a kid with some more bright red hair. [no offense Alex hahaha] So I went over to see if it was Alex. It was, and he was with Alexander Hovnanian, Satchel and some other cute boys.

We hung out with Alex and Alexander. We tried to go in the water but it was gross with jellyfish eggs.

When I came home Ryan Korn said we could come over. So I told my parents and I was getting ready and shit and then my dad always has to get involved with things and make everything fucked up. So then he said it was too late for me to go out. It was 9:00. So I sat home on my fat ass for the 3rd night in a row. My parents really want to make my summer suck.

<u>Boy has this last week been shit.</u>

I just can't stand these people.

God I really do hate my life.

But on a <b>good note</b>, Caroline came home last night!!! <333 I missed you soo much babes. However, she is leaving again this Saturday for the Outer Banks, and she is going to miss when I move. :(

Went to De's house at 6 and then went to Applebee's with Kate, Dana, Deanna, Nicole, Courtney and Megan (you my girl SPANKY!).

"event","I was watching late night tv with mom on Wed or Thurs. Mobile's local news was running stories of local churches who were jubilantly celebrating Obama's election as the next President. I watched with unbelieving eyes at people dancing, clapping, singing, and praising ""God"" for Obama's presidential victory, quoted as being ""the best thing that has ever happened to our country."" Appalled was not the word that I would apply to how I felt. Horrified, grieved, irate, and angry would be more apropos.

My immediate thought: their god is not my God.

My God is the God of the Bible; the God that spoke creation into existence, the God who gave us the Ten Commandments and then several thousand years later sent His Son into our world to fulfill them (Matt. 5:17). My God is pro-life and all that it entails; i.e. anti-stem cell research, anti-abortion, pro-family, and pro-marriage. I am so glad that the dopes who obviously voted for Obama to be our next president voted to add the pro-marriage amendment to the Florida Constitution. And the California Constitution.

Tricia reminded me of something that I have to keep in mind; evangelical Christians put Obama, a man who stand as the antithesis of our beliefs, into office. Sarah and I were talking to Bill @ the coffee shop on Tuesday evening. Sarah asked him how the family was. And his answer was a little surprising. He said for us to ask him what the future holds, not what the present was, indicating that the election's influence on the economy and its indicated change for us small businesses was foremost in his mind.  I looked at Sarah, and was reminded of Matthew 6:34 that I memorized as a teenager: ""Do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."" I came back at him with my thoughts about how America deserves this, that we are the ones who have not fulfilled the Great Commission and have left the faith of the Scriptures, and that VOM reports that the persecuted church in China prays for us to undergo persecution so that we can be purified. Sarah reminded me in the car that the Church Bride that Jesus is coming back for is without spot or wrinkle. And we are so faaaaaar away from that on the spotted and wrinkled side of the spectrum! We are all so silly, stupid, and shallow. It is our fault that we have not been the Light and Salt that we were commanded to be!

So I say, Lord, bring it on!
You are the One who orchestrates or steps.
Not one hair falls from our heads that You do not know about.
Our salvation is from you; You are our strength in time of trouble.
You help us and deliver us from the wicked, and save us
Because we take refuge in You! (Psalm 37:39-40).

I will continually seek you, Lord.
The wicked will gnash his teeth and melt away, but You will sustain the righteous forever.
I will meditate on Your Word, for it will feed my soul in the hard times ahead.
Am I afraid? Yes. But I will trust in You! For You have never left your servants alone.

""The fear of the LORD is to hate evil;
Pride and arrogance and the evil way and the perverted mouth, I hate. Counsel is mine and sound wisdom;
I am understanding, power is mine.
By me kings reign, and rulers decree justice.
By me princes rule, and nobles, all who judge rightly.
I love those who love me; and those who diligently seek me will find me.""
Proverbs 8:13-17"

Today in Joy & Stength (a devo by Mary Tilestone), I was reminded of it again in reading Psalm 145:16, ""You open Your hand, And satisfy the desire of every living thing."""

"event","In the last year, two girls that I know have gone through divorces. The one most recent was especially heart-wrenchingly painful.  Two more of my girlfriends have been going through therapy and classes for abuse that happened in childhood. I am continually struck by the fact that these gals will not let their past box them in. They were tricked, misled, cheated, and lied to by those who were close to them or should have been their protectors. But God wins in the end. Their past should not define who they are or what they become.

I have been reading Max Lucado's Come Thirsty this week, and have been reminded of God's sovereignty over the harsh times of life, but I still wince at the pain my sisters in Jesus have endured. 

It reminds me of several things that C. S Lewis wrote:
We're not necessarily doubting that God will do the best for us; we are wondering how painful the best will turn out to be.

God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks to us in our conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world."

"event","Did you know that pastors are dogs?
Sheepdogs, that is!

I am on a quest this summer; the goal is to read 8 books, and I am well on my way to finish! Last week's book was A J Kiesling's Skizzer. Great plot, well-developed characters, etc.  There was even a quote that struck me about pastors/shepherds.

""My fellow clergymen and I are just sheepdogs...not the real shepherd.""

And as I thought about that, it made me wonder...
How many Christians sit in pews, thinking that all the words and thoughts that drip from the mouths of their pastors are the Gospel truth? Is the check and balance system of God's Word never used anymore by the sheep?

I have sat during countless sermons, thinking that what I was hearing was anti-Scriptural, man's own ideas, or downright error. But then, I know what the Word says because I have read it and studied it and learned from it, and that filters all that I hear.

""...that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.""
2 Tim 3:15

But how many Christians lap up all they can get because they are so desperately hungry for spiritual feeding because they do not feed themselves?!  How pitifully sad. It is one of my few pet peeves."

"event","I am nearing the end of my stats class. I have to say, that of all the college work that I have done, I have hated this the most. Even studying for the College Algebra CLEP was not this terrible. Yuck. 

Tricia, Mom and I have worked very hard and set up the new OFFICE in Cori's old bedroom. YES! I have always wanted/needed a home office.  I have already ""broken it in "" with a batch of FICA taxes and homework last night.

The school is slowly coming together. This is the last week of summer tutoring for the year.  Three weeks off while I furiously whip the office/records/transcripts/scholarship appl/handbooks into shape. Aly has been a great help, and I am so glad to have her back! My teaching schedule for this fall is almost filled already. I think I have 8 slots left. Several of my former students/families have not returned my calls or arranged for planning meetings yet, so they are going to miss out on my skills this fall. I am teaching a Greek & Latin Roots (classical vocabulary-boosting) class and a Cooking/Nutrition class, in addition to Biology Dissection in November and my regular tutoring lessons.

I still need to...
Print photos from Cori's wedding and the 07-08 school year and put them in albums, read 4 more books (fulfilling my summer quota of 8), organized/sort through old student files, and see 4 movies (Dark Knight, Mama Mia!, WALL-E, Journey to Center).

I am in no way caught up, but am optimistic as always.
I am listening to sermons by R C Sproul & Bro Richard online this evening."

"event","I finished reading Prince Caspian. Gosh. There is a lot in that book that they left out of the movie, a lot of symbolism and metaphor that would have been magnificent. They turned the animals of Narnia into comic relief, rather than noble and righteous citizens of a realm that we only wish was real. Several major figures in the books were removed or made non-entities: the Bulgy Bears, the awakened trees, Giant Wimbleweather. Nothing was said of Dr. Cornelius being a half-dwarf. And the wonderful midsummer dance and feast was omitted as far as I could tell. Prince Caspian himself is good-looking, yet foppish. Aslan is made to roar instead of speak (what is up with that?!?) to get obedience.

Albeit, I am wholeheartedly a fan of the new movies...take your kids, go see them yourself, several times.  But read the books too. They can never be replaced. C. S. Lewis was a genius!

"event","Materialism is idolatry.

I see so many things that steal and thieve from the Church as a whole. Materialism and the love of money is the root of ALL evil, Paul said in 1 Tim. 6:10. ""For the love of money is the root of all evils; it is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced their hearts with many pangs."" RSV

Do you get that? People have turned their back on God for the love of money and riches and fame and a name.  On Saturday after Abby's wonderful wedding, we came home to watch a marathon of 7 episodes of the new season of BBC America's ""Robin Hood"". In episode 7, Allan-A-Dale is turncoat to Robin and gang, joining forces with Sir Guy, all because he wanted to reap monetary benefits for himself. He was no longer satisfied to ""take from the rich to give to the poor."" He sold out his friends to get what he wanted. I think sometimes we sell Jesus out to get what we want out of life. I have seen it too many times, over and over. We do our own thing with arrogant hearts turned against Him. We make decisions based on monetary concerns, rather than God's will.

BTW, you can check the show out here; it's FAB!!! I can't get over the fact that the handsome Richard Armitage who played the noble John in the movie adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's ""North and South"" plays antagonist Guy of Gisborne!

I have several friends who worship shopping...having the new ""IT"" thing...wearing the latest fads...or characterize themselves as ""material girls."" In fact, when I think of them, I think of them in reference to the things that they like- perfume, heels, makeup, hair, tattoos, etc. Well, ladies. God calls it idolatry...worshiping ourselves and the things of this world.

Do you remember Vanity Fair in Pilgrim's Progress?  I have listened to that book on tape and read about six different versions over my lifetime, but always will I remember the important and influential character Faithful who died in Vanity Fair. He refused to give up his faith in the face of so many worldly distractions and foes. He closed his eyes and look ""straight ahead"" so as not to be distracted, and in doing so made a life-changing impression on Christian.

If God does not consume our life in His, if He does not fully envelop our desires, dreams, playtimes, personality, relationships, hobbies, and secrets, then He is not our God. John said, ""Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."" KJV"

"event","I read an article this week that was about the economy, people cutting back, etc. One of the things that people are cutting out of their budget is bottled water. Americans spend $4 billion each year on bottled water right now. That is 4,000,000,000 dollars, folks! So, my question is, are people really going to be drinking their nasty tap water? Eww! NO!

My favorite bottled water at work is Zephyrhills; it is spring water from right here in Florida. As we drive to Destin every so often, we pass a bottling plant or something.  When I am at home, we have a filter system on our tap water, and it actually tastes good (I am drinking some now). Which brings up another question: do people really drink enough water?

They say that the average person needs 8 8-oz. glasses a day. So far, the only person that I have ever know to drink that much is Josh Whitehead!

Few of my students seem to drink it (no wonder they have difficulty thinking and concentrating...their brains have no oxygen!). I even relax and wind down with a tall glass of ice water before falling asleep every night (Aha! Now you know one of my nightly rituals!). It helps me to relax and unstress. Also I drink before classes and before taking online exams (more tricks).

So I don't know. Still thinking about it."

Cori is so bubbly; it is too cute.

I hostessed a bridal shower for Abby on June 21st. It was loverly (just posted pics in an album). She received many wonderful things for their home. I got her a sleek, modern, bright green pitcher and a collection of wonderful wooden/brown tone frames. I had fun. Gail & all the girls did wonderfully; the food was delicious. At last count, I was numberings almost 40 ladies there. My little house was happy!

I took a short nap after the shower, packed a bag, and headed to Panama City Beach to visit Lesley for the weekend. We had a wonderful visit, and brought her back home with us for the remainder of the week. What a hoot we had! We laughed so much that my stomach muscles are sore! It was good to have her here and catch up, talk, eat, laugh, and gossip, of course. I can't believe it's been 13 years since Indy!!! I love her dearly and hope and pray that she is blessed and secure in our Jesus. Also that her physical recovery from surgery goes smoothly and just as it should.

I am back at work at CIAS three full days per week. I am catching up on so much as my tutoring load is much lighter and I am able to focus on the office, records, transcripts, etc.  I have been doing meetings and interviews as well, since Mom has been in Orlando for several weeks, and the achievement test scores arrived. Most of our kids did very well; I am so proud of all of them!

Well, tomorrow is the big day.We are driving down to Disney World, Magic Kingdom, Splash Mtn, Epcot, and the Holy Land Experience for the VERY FIRST TIME (for me, anyway). Yeppers. I know. I am a little old. But we were poor when I was a kid, and my idea of vacation as an adult is at a condo on the beach or in a cabin in the Tennessee mountains, so we have never gone. I am soooo pumped!!! I am packing my bags tonight and in the morning...still have to finish some laundry.

Got to see Brooke tonight!  Yay!!! It's her hoppy birthday. It was good to see the girls too! Love you all dearly!"

http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,298336,00.html
They said, ""They plan to walk out each Thursday when the pledge is read and recite their version, which omits the reference to God and adds allegiance to constitutional rights, diversity and freedom, among other things.""

I am taking education and American history courses this semester.  If those imbecilic kids only knew that the basis of the free public school system was a plan that Puritan religious leaders hatched to make sure that young American colonists were being taught the moral, religious, and academic basics.  They felt like parents were neglectful of their children's education and that they were under teaching religion, so they developed the first school books and primers based on the Scriptures. There was no separation of church and state at that time, since our country was founded by religionists.  And if those 50 kids really knew what THAT really entailed, they wouldn't be so quick to jump out of their seats to make donkeys out of themselves.

What a hoot!

I am really enjoying my American history class this semester.  It is cool to be learning again; I can't believe that I have survived on just reading books all this time.  Even though I have broadened my intellectual and academic horizons,  I haven't done the in-depth studies that I loved years ago.

I took James out for lunch at Olive Garden on Friday.  Enjoyed that!  Also visited the chiropractor for a painful sciatic nerve adjustment. 

Cool movie for the week: The Ultimate Gift...I think it is my favorite for the year!

Looking forward to gardening and piddling in the yard tomorrow.  My birthday is just two weeks away!!!  :)

http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByTitle/2343_Pastors_Pragmatism_Pleasure_and_Pride/

Several things stood out to me:

"" Beware of sacrificing truth and holiness on the altar of what seems to work. Things are not what they seem.""

""Love the truth and so be saved.""

""The idolatry of pragmatism that ruins the church; the pleasure in unrighteousness that refuses to love the truth; and the pride of being strong that leads to destruction.""

""Leaning on the purifying power of ever-arriving future grace.""


I remember my first introduction to Christian hedonism.  I was enthralled by the concept of hedonism being turned into a passionate zealous fervor for God!  It tied into my early Christian discipleship roots in Oswald Chamber's books.  Grace IS a purifying power.  It burns out all other loves.  It ever fills me more and more as I get older.

""We as Christians, when we pass into heaven, are actually being raised from the dead to true life. Frankie was raised from the dead. He is happier than we can imagine. His passing should only increase our desire for our Eternal reward. ""

I have been to several funerals in my life...teens in accidents, people dead due to disease, and people who died unexpectantly in the prime of life. I sat beside a casket for my own grandmother, knowing that I might not ever see her again for eternity if she did not cry out to God during her last moments on earth.

I love the thought of this life being a fleeting shadow and our passing into heaven being the true beginning of our lives. It puts into perspective the earthly strife, sorrow, pain, suffering, sin, and despair that we endure and learn from. I guess I have read enough of the Mystics to appreciate the eternal bliss and happiness that is in store for us in heaven. There are so many people there that I want to meet. And I want to pick their brains. I want to see Jesus and feel his scarred hands. I want to worship before the Throne forever, and feast without gaining weight! :)

I took Aly, one of my girls, out for a promised late-birthday hoorah on Thursday.
Sushi at Ichiban.
Frappacino at Drowsy Poet.
Spa pedicures at my fav nail place, Diamond Nails. 
(BTW, they give the BEST peds in town!!!)
We talked and laughed and had a great time.
Introduced her to my BIL.
And Aly's ""we're just friends"" Jimmy texted her for four hours solid.
Yep.  That was really nice.

So, I have nothing inspirational to say today.  I am suffering with an ear infection of sorts.  Was dizzy and felt blah today, so I canceled my appointments and came home to medicate. Brought my laptop home so I could finish two major transcript projects.  Daniel was over for dinner (Rach was working late shift at the coffee shop), and Bryan was over as well.  I like him for Cori. :)  Sarah and ""the boys"" are going fishing in the morning.  I get to work at the bakery.  Then I need rest.

I have been perusing various presidential hopefuls online.  Yes, I am politically active, thank you!  I did a paper in high school on the power of one vote and impressed myself with the importance of being savy.  That gives me a good idea for essay assignments this year...There are so many candidates to choose from, and the Dems have got their best foot forward with the whole YouTube debate thing going on.  Really, really smart.

I want to see Becoming Jane, but alas, it is not playing here this week or next.
There are three new Austen book-based films out; Persuasion, Northanger Abbey, and Mansfield Park were released in Britain early in the spring.  One can always hope they will make it here by fall or winter. 

Oh, oh, oh!  MrMovieTimes.com says that it is landing here on Friday the 17th!!!  Yay!  I am so there.  :)  Whooppeeee!  <3<3<3"

I have been keeping up my blogs on myspace; many of my students read them there (and a few of you!).  I will repost several blogs.  Enjoy!

from July 29
 	

tired and inspired

I am sooooo tired.

With wedding cakes (just finished the two busiest wedding cakes weekends of the year), computer class projects/tests, multitudes of interviews at school, tutoring lessons, planning for next school year, taxes, and finances...I am OFFICIALLY exhausted.  I have begun getting headaches every day, sometimes migraines that lead to nausea, etc.  Last week at youth service I was drained before I got there for prayer.  But I needed to be there, and was heartened by the prayer time, especially Bobby's impassioned message.  I got sick feeling later on (the new carpet was toxic) and went to bed early.

So today....I took time off from the pressing world and slept in, enjoyed the sunshine for several hours, napped, looked at my mags, listened to music, visited with Summer & Meredith for a few mins, and started watching one my fav movies, Wives and Daughters.

I am reading E. Elliott's Music of His Promises every evening this month.  There have been so many little excerpts that have blessed/encouraged/stirred me...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Secret of Understanding

The man who has received my commands and obeys them--he it is who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by My Father; and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him"" (John 14:21).

Have you felt that you were stumbling along more or less in the dark, wishing now and then for a more vital spirituality, and greater understanding of God, and more ""love"" for Him? Obedience is the secret of spiritual insight.  It is not given to any but those who obey, for they are the only ones who love God. There is no love where there is no obedience.  To choose to disobey is to choose darkness.  No wonder we stumble. Open your heart to the Light by doing what God says. Then He will know you as His true lover, will love you and disclose Himself to you.  And you will walk in the light.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This was a good reminder for me, to show my abandoned LOVE for the Savior by obeying Him in everything, everytime He prompts me...so hard for my stubborn little self to do."

It's been a while since I have blogged here.
My apologies to you all!
I am too busy, really.
Summer is supposedly a break from my normal frenetic pace of life.
I need to slow down.

I am painting rooms in my house: Benjamin Moore's Arctic Blue & Bavarian Cream (fam rm), Potpourri Green (my room), Acadia Green (kitchen/dining).
Gardening and piddling in the yard.
Swimming and going to the beach.
Reading books and magazines.
Sorting and organizing my closets (i.e. throwing away old papers & ""stuff"").
Sleeping more. :)
Studying for online college classes (computer this summer).
Teaching three days a week.
Interviews for new students for the fall.
Academic planning meetings for returning students.
Icing cakes for all the bakery orders.
Prayer team for the youth group and my own kids.
I will be involved in the Branded by Fire Youth Conference in two weeks (http://www.brandedbyfire.org)."

"event","I enjoyed today.
Spent sometime at my house, swimming and soaking up the good sun.
A pair of cardinals were flitting about in the palm trees, and the pool Polaris tail flipped water on me every five minutes or so.  It was good just to rest, with nothing to do.  My neighbor was cutting his lawn and burning wood...both good smells.  Later listened to Josh Turner, took a nap, and finally perused my Coastal Living for the month.

I spent all of Friday cleaning and arranging the house in preparation for the Prom Party.  I went from room to room, washing, wiping, vacuuming, and straightening furniture.  It all looks splendid.  I had lost of visitors all day...it was GOOD to see Kristen!!! :)

The Prom and after party were both a SUCCESS!  Our proms are not really proms, in that we don't dance, but we do offer the opportunity for the high school kids to dress fancy/formal, dine at a 4-5 star restaurant, and have fun spending time together afterwards.  This year we had 30 kids at Zea's Rotisserie & Grille downtown.

The superlative votes went down this way:
Most Respected: Brandon Boyd
Most likely to succeed: Jay Odom
Most likely to still be working on a college degree in five years: Cary Hall
Most likely to get lost on a road trip: Aly Jeffrey
Most likely to sing in the shower: Roger Vaughn
Most likely to get a job as a furry animal character at an amusement park: Nathaniel Edwards
Prom King: Adam Narvaez
Prom Queen: Cary Hall

It was fun, and I got lots of great pics!!! :P
The after party was at Sarah and my house.  Mostly everyone played hide and go seek for a little, then settled in for over two hours of the game ""Battle of the Sexes.""  The kids were HILARIOUS!!!  I was in the next room, helping both teams and having a hoot.  It was midnight by the time they were winding down.  Most of the younger ones were getting picked up, so the seniors went swimming and stayed talking until 2:15 or so.  Overall it was a fun evening.  The only that went wrong were that we forgot to get a prize for Most Respected (to come later...) and I forgot to give out the prom favors: 2007 bubbles, glow-in-the-dark 2007 glasses, and grad tassel key rings for the seniors. Phooey!!! :P"

"event","The hardest part of my week is over.
I have taught 32 hours so far with only two to go.
But I do have a heavy cake weekend (no wedding).

Tomorrow morning bright and early I make my foray back into the college scene to take the CPT and register for an online computer class at PJC.  I figure that if I don't get the ball rolling for summer classes I will never take the plunge.  Also plan on studying for a sociology CLEP.  I have such great formidable goals to achieve, but I realize that everything will happen in its time.  I tried ORU's distance learning program for a year awhile back; I loved my Bible class, but the whole program is not organized and tends to be very unweildy.  I often was passed from person to person if I need something, and my professors never responded to e-mails or contacts.  I did get good grades though! :)  hehehe.

Tomorrow evening is the CIAS girls' sleepover/pool party at Sarah's and my new house!  The girls are all excited; we haven't had one in a long while, and supposedly they are famous memory makers! :)  Sarah and I have been spending every extra moment cleaning and doing yard work.  We want to grill hot dogs and burgers; I am even going to decorate a cake like a sleepover bed for them!  Still need to put up my painting supplies and move some book shelves against the living room wall.  Painting is such a big job, but I do enjoy seeing the palate of a room transform with fresh, new colors.  

Last weekend was so stressful.  
We had a designer cake to deliver on Pensacola Beach to a condo/house.  It was iced in lemony yellow icing and decorated in bright orange and raspberry pink icing stripes.  On top of everything, it was terribly humid all day (70-80%) with thunderstorms pending.  So on the way over, I suddenly get the feeling that something isn't right.  We pull over and sure enough, the top layer had pitched over and taken a roll across the back of the van.  Still intact (Jesus loves me!!!), I was able to roll it back smooth and fill in the one small gash.  After we got out there, we immediately took the bottom two layers up into the reception area (outside under the condo), and spent the next hour in the back of the van re-decorating the side of the top with new stripes.  The Lord was certainly watching out for us, since no sooner had we gotten it out and under canopy, the sky let loose and poured like crazy!  The bride's mother was like, ""I can't even tell!""  But I am a perfectionist, I guess.  It WAS an adorable cake, decorated with scattered orchids. but I don't think I will ever trust a torted triple layer top layer on its own in the van again.  I was shaking so badly afterwards.  It's been many years since we have had a cake accident. :(

Cori talked me into sushi and hibachi afterwards.  I am glad! :)  I enjoyed the chef and relaxed atmosphere, and it helped to settle me down for the weekend.  Sunday was restful.  I started a project that I have been planning for several years: organizing my vast recipe collection into two binders.  Also raked leaves and rested at my house.  Then I finished the FICA taxes for the quarter (bakery & CIAS) and listened to some late night jazz while reading.

Well, I just back back from a trip across town to the Drowsy Poet, my BIL's (by marriage) coffee shop.  Mocha Poetchino with an extra shot of chocolate.  Yum!!!  Chocolate makes MB happy!  And so does Jesus!!! :)"

But I am getting better.
This is the second week, and I still have a chest cold.

But, anywhooo...

Had lots to do this weekend.
Even more that I didn't get done.
On Friday, I did cakes all morning, taught two of my girls, and back to the bakery for the evening  to bake hot cross buns!  YUMMY!!!!
They were gorgeous AND delicious!!!  It was so funny; it's been so long since I have baked, that I was asking, ""Umm, where is the flour?  Sugar?"" Aly had a good laugh! :P
And I got to chat a long time about all kinds of stuff with her.

Saturday was back to the bakery. 
Got Chinese takeout.
Watched a little tv. 
Visited with a dear friend and former student.

Today.  Read the word; good feeding!  In the afternoon, I did worklogs for CIAS paychecks, filled out FICA tax records & forms, hung four loads of laundry, cooked yeast rolls, ate Easter dinner, organized the high school testing for tomorrow, and am headed to bed after a shower.  Enjoyed the jellybeans/chocolate that Sarah got for the fam. I had gotten everyone adorable little Hallmark cards with a chickie popping out of a basket of pansies.  Cute! :)

Tomorrow:
Up at 7 AM
Teaching from 8-5.
Finishing applications for four Bright Futures scholarships.
Pick up a consigned skirt from Sweet Repeats (the zipper is rough).
Shop for dinner makings...chicken perlo & mixed veggies..
Cook dinner
Watch & vote for Dancing with the Stars.

Love you all!
Love my Jesus!
Love my family!"

"event","I was looking over past sermon notes from several years back.  I ran across a few things that are super and worth noting.

For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, And do not return there without watering the earth And making it bear and sprout, And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater; So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; It will not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding {in the matter} for which I sent it.
~Isa. 55:10-11

Standards are not enforced on us by religion, 
but by the boundaries of a relationship with the Almighty God.

What would you do for Him?
No, maybe the better question is,
What would you NOT do for Him?

Then I was finishing a last perusal today of my notes from Jim Elliot's journals, and he quotes Amy Carmichael with this:
From subtle love of softening things,
From easy choices, weakenings,
Not thus are spirits fortified,
Not this way went the Crucified,
From all that dims Thy Calvary,
O Lamb of God, deliver me!

Talk about a lady who gave up the essence of her life, spent and spilled out, to be used as a firebrand in the Harvest!  A true ""little-Christ"" woman to be admired and emulated.

How many things do I hold close or harbor in my heart that weaken my zealousness?  That whittle away at my grip on God?  Lord, reveal the things that You would spurn and repudiate!  Help me to root them out before my life is rendered powerless and unfruitful!"

to catch up on sleep!  :P  Weird thing, even though this is spring break, I have been in bed by 10:30 every night and up around 9 every morning.  I can't seem to sleep late anymore!!! :(
 
I spent Monday with Cori at the condo, Tuesday with Sarah.
Got me a tidy little tan getting started (Okay, yes, I use SPF 15 now.  Come on, who wants skin cancer when they are 50?!?).  Planning on spending the weekend there too.  The wind was brusque and the sum warm and toasty.  Perfect private beach. Ahhhh.
 
Did finances with Sarah on Wed. AM.  Had to get the whole mortgage payments/ rent thing straightened out in my head.  Spent some cute time with the nieces and nephew. Had lots of computer work to do for CIAS, placing curriculum and library book orders. 
 
Thursday AM I spent catching up on myspace.  Hehehe.
Went on a bank run with Mom; enjoyed a rare lunch with her at Olive Garden.  Enjoyed my portobella steak alfredo!!!
 
Been finishing several books.  Come Thirsty by Max Lucado (so way good!!!) , skimmed Jim Elliot's Journals, and want to finish an Alice Smith book as well.
 
Doing several cakes today, lunch with Jenn, and off to the beach again this afternoon.
Thank the Lord for vacations! :P"

"event","One of our girls at school today mentioned that she had seen two of our former girls/grads drinking at TGIFriday's last week.  And even though she is young, she knew it was wrong, since she has relatives who drink and live worldly lives.

It boggles my mind, how Christians can excuse social drinking, knowing what Jesus says so plainly in Matthew 18.  I know that Paul said that taking a little wine medicinally was fine, but Jesus is  condemns any practice that might stumble a young Christian.  All I could think was shame, shame, shame on those who claim the name of Christ. 

""But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea."""

"event","Any fellow Jim Elliot fans out there?!?

I am once again reading his journals, inspired by the memory of a certain quote that I had marked somewhere in my copy years ago (can't find it now!).  He was such a passionate person, and unlike most people today, was zealous about things that count eternally.  The superfluous had no charm or hold on him.  And yet, he was a real man who lived in human skin with human flaws and idiocyncracies just like me.

Some of my re-marked quotes...

""Either take me to be with Thee, Savior, or put out the life of this old man as I draw near Thee in the flesh.  Consumer me, Fiery Lover, as Thou dost choose.""

""May my life be yielded that it might be wielded.""

""One does not surrender a life in an instant--that which is lifelong can only be surrendered in a lifetime.""

""Show me one burning heart.  Let me see a single worldling afire with true passion, one heavenling consumed with his God's eternal burning.""

""Earthly blessing is no sign of heavenly favor."""

"event","I am doing a study on faithfulness.  Once it is finished, I will post it here.

Recently, my ""craw""has been full of first hand examples of unfaithfulness- untrustworthy friends, several friends' marriages falling apart, etc.- so I am studying God's faithfullness and His commands for our faithfulness to rest my heart.  It is good stuff!!

There is a plethora of Almighty examples in the Scruiptures, but not too many human examples.  I was meditating and writing today, and found this in Steve Hill's Bible Reading Guide from years ago (1993?):

God is not like men (thank Him for THAT!!!), who make large promises, but either through iniability or carelessness or unfaithfulness, do not perform them; but will certainly be as good as His Word.-Matthew Pool

Amen and amen!"

Running the school en solo, tutoring 34 hours a week, and a much busier wedding cake season than ever before has me running ragged.  Since we had taken on extra students, that has really been a juggle to keep going.

Yesterday was a 13-hour work day- 8 AM to 9 PM.
Today is the FIRST day in two months that I have been able to sleep in (i.e. no appointments, no early cakes, no wedding cake)!!! 

With the weather warming up, I am enjoying the flowers at my house.  My camelia bush is in full bloom...gorgeous!  And my pansies.  :)  During spring break, I want to take several days out and finish rearranging the furniture and finish painting several rooms that I have the paint for already.  We are going to spend most of the week at the condo in Perdido Key.  Yay!!!  :)"

"event","It's a Good Day!

On the way to school this morning, I noticed that so many yards and roofs were covered in an icy white sheen of frost.  In Florida that means it is cold, especially since we are all thin-blooded!  I am enjoying a large caffe of coffee and reading Come Thirsty, as my first student called to say that we couldn't make it.

It's 8 AM.
I have been so busy lately.
Too busy to update my blogs or post to my kids on myspace.
Teaching from 8 to 5 M-Th and Friday afternoons, office hours on T/TH/F, cakes on Friday mornings and Saturdays.  And wedding season at the bakery starts this next Saturday!  This past Saturday Cori and I had a busy day (it was weirdly long!).  She had wedding cake consultations, and I had wedding cake supply inventory to do, plus two cakes.  Afterwards, we ate at Siam Thai and wandered around town for a bit, seeing as it was our last Saturday afternoon for the next three months to have no wedding to do.  I wanted to go to KMart to see if they had any nightgowns on clearance.  I have been wanting a new one, and they had cute cotton ones.

I have been fighting a cold.  Every evening I feel worse than in the morning.  Congestion and coughing.  I have been on Vit. C and Airborn.  On Sunday (my only day off in a week), I stayed home to rest.  Couldn't sleep any longer than 10 AM
This is what my day consisted of:
put up the dishes
packed up the Christmas tree ornaments
cleaned all my school clutter from the family room
washed three loads of laundry
set up the bi-weekly pay checks for CIAS employees
finished and filed W-2s for the bakery
watched Mobile Masterpiece's ""Ruby in the Smoke"" with the girls
hauled several boxes and washed linen over at my house
took a shower
bed at 11 
How's that for a day?!? :)

I promised myself that I would take it easier this week; take Tuesday evening off and crochet.  I also need to hang and fold the laundry I washed.  Why do I hate to do that?!

So, I want to rant about activism.
We tried to watch the new Hallmark, ""Love is a Four Letter Word"" this week.  It was so awful.  I normally love Hallmarks.  They are easy going, local color, family stories, and not all Hollywood glam.  But when they weave unnecessary immorality into the storyline, it goes too far.  I am going to complain, as usual.  I complained when the local theatre (PLT) allowed a pentagram to be designed into the stained glass for the church scene in ""The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,"" and I praised the kids who performed in Tate High's ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" last week.  If I don't give feedback, who else will be vigilant to praise and reprove accordingly?  Too many old cranks complain about panhandlers and politics, but hardly ever do I see letters to the editor written by Christians who are offended or disturbed.  Are we that apathetic?  Does righteous indignation not rise up in us anymore?  Does the holiness of the Holy Spirit not affect the way we live day to day in society?  I can understand someone who is not exposed to a lot of public life not getting involved; they do not see or hear what goes on.  But those of us who do lead very public lives (I teach 25 non-sheltered teenagers!!!) do have more responsibility.  It's funny.  Growing up in a conservative, sheltering family would typically not prepare a person for what we deal with every day.  But we were and we are, by the grace of God.  He teaches us everything that we need to know as we go along.

Well, my kids are arriving for school.
Good to catch up on everyone's blogs and journals."

Well, the guys are looking forward to that.  The girls are going to gossip and talk and giggle all afternoon. :)  It's the only time we let them bring their games (parties/holidays), so they are really stoked.

I will tutor again this afternoon.  Several kids out sick with strep and the flu.  Yuck.

It just dawned on me...I have been absent from LJ for sooo long.
Life is just too busy.
Wedding cake season has begun at the bakery.
We have three to do this coming weekend.

"event","Today would have been Grandma Jones's birthday.   I wish I could know I will see her again;  I wish she had not hardened her heart to the Lord.  Grandmas Mae would be 109 on Jan. 3rd.  Thank God for her; her prayers are the foundation of our family today!

I always get nostalgic during Christmas.  I think of all the great things the Lord has done for our family. 
The provisions and all the things we have been able to get done with His help and blessing: (9th graduating class at CIAS, unexpectedly purchasing the two houses, paying off our Civic, remodeling the school. 
The protection He provides us (me in my weird car accident, countless fender-benders I have watched Him protect me from).
The healthcare watch He gives us (I haven't been majorly sick at all this year or caught any of the family bugs.  Tricia has stayed well and in remission), thank Jesus!.

Lord, you are so good!
I couldn't ask for better.
I loved this,
""I want to express my heartfelt thanks to God for His mighty miracles.  All who are thankful should ponder them with me.  For His miracles demonstrate His Honor, Majesty, and Goodness!"" Ps. 111:1-2

""Thank You, Lord!  How good You are!  Your love for us continues on forever.  Who can ever list the glorious miracles of God?  Who can ever praise Him half enough?""  Ps. 106:1"

"event","I was thinking about this Christmas season and all the activities that we have attended; I  don't think I have ever been to so many activities.  It has been fun to get out and dress up.  I have finally worn the pretty black faux fur-collared sweater that I asked for last Christmas...many times!!!

Dec 1st
Kimberly's Little Women play (Sarah's student)
Hearts Ablaze Formal (with Sarah- got dressed up...looked fine!  good table conversation, cheap food, boring entertainment)

Dec 8th
Pensacola Childrens Chorus' ""Christmas on the Coast"" concert at the Saenger Theatre (with Cori- really delightful music, dressed up again, had a good time, Starbucks, Cori's student Ashley)

Yesterday was Tricia's birthday

This week-
Tomorrow is the CIAS Christmas party.
It's also Grandma's birthday, rest her soul.
Wednesday is the HA Christmas Costume Party (I am going as Mary, of course!)
Friday is lunch with Kristen (former student and employee, forever friend!)
Friday is also my last day of teaching for the year.
Saturday is a Winter Voice recital at PJC for Morgan and Christian (Sarah's students)
Sunday is the Pensacola Little Theatre's performance of The Best Christmas Pageant Ever (with Mom- Colton is the left stage manage, Mom's student)

Then we get three weeks off from teaching.  I get to try to catch up on report cards, the last of my Christmas shopping, mail Christmas cards, and set up a tree at my house.  Then baking for the bakery for the rest of the week.  For the first time in seven years, we are actually going to get Christmas Eve off from the bakery since it's on Sunday this year!!

And then, we get one whole week off after Christmas to do absolutely nothing if we so wish.  I do need to harvest my lemons, organize my finances for the year, and file FICA taxes for all the businesses.

Life has been busy but productive.  I finished up my Home Ec cooking class last Tuesday with a grilling class.  The girls LOVED that! :)  The week before, I took them for sushi; three of the five girls had never had it, and the best way to get introduced to sushi is to go with people who love it!  I  know I never would have tried it if Cori hadn't taken me several years ago and showed me what everything is for.  Ichiban is my favorite sushi place here, but it's across town, so I don't get there as often as I would like.

I think I will see if the condo is available for Cori's birthday on Jan. 4th.  She wants to do something special, and I can't think of anything original and cheap to do! :)  By the time we get through three birthdays and Christmas gifts for seven, everyone is pretty much penniless!"

"event","Cori, Sarah and I drove to Mobile last night for the Third Day Concert.
I didn't realize until today that it has been 4 years since we have been to one of their concerts, back in 2002!

We had a blast!

We got over there early enough to pick up our tickets, then eat at the Mellow Mushroom beforehand.

The concert was rockin'!  4000 people.  I was pumped (had a two glasses of tap root beer!).  By the time they got to Cry Out to Jesus, the place was electric.
Even enjoyed the David Crowder Band.
I did not win the Silverado. :(
Starbucks afterwards.

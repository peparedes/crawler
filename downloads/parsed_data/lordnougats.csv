"event","Last entry was about getting that horrible horrible job, among other things. If you ever have a chance to deal with lowermybills.com, DON'T! They are stupid, and evil, and lame, and all sorts of bad things. Dot commies. So...that gig lasted all of a month, then I was unemployed for awhile, brushed up on my Countestrike abilities for a month or 3, worked at a telco in downtown LA, was fun for the 1st 3 months, as I was contracted to do a specific project, but I tried to stay on after the project was complete, and that job became royally CRAPPY! I know some darn fine level 1 techs; at that place, I think we were level .5 or a little lower.
 Anyhoo, so I got rilly sick of that, so got this nifty job upgrading stuff for sony pictures entertainment. Yippee. Lots of other stuff has happened too. If you want to keep clued in to what's really going on, you'll read <a href=""http://dieyuppiescum.org"">this</a> on a regular basis. Or not, it doesn't matter."

"event","Yesterday I spoke with Jeff Gordon about the new job at his company, lowermybills.com. He told me to expect a call from allen, their sysadmin; no call has come as yet..but he's undoubtably a busy man, especially lacking help on the support end- my purpose to start.
Although it appears to be exactly the job I've been looking for, and truly hoped to find, I'm still, well, anxious. Everybody mocks superstition, yet everybody always seems to fall back on superstions in retrospect; so, finding one spider after another drowned in the laundry soaking in the tub is upsetting on so many levels. I mean, of course, the obvious-- the helpful little guys died-- but then, on the other hand, killing spiders is bad bad mojo. Technically, they killed themselves, assumably by accident. Then again, perhaps we're just difficult roommates. Most likeky thay hated the bleach smell wafting about, and went walkabout in search of less smelly digs, taking the obvious route, straight down, as spiders that live on the cieling are wont to do. 
 Well, on to other news. I just installed M$ Project, to familiarise meself with it. Nothing to it, on the surface anyway. Pretty self-explanitory by the looks of it. I kinda thought it had some kind of journal thingy...like this here, but not as such. It kinda does, but it seems geared toward tracking inventory and projects and managementey stuff like that; likely will be useful for something. I really DO need to get more organised.
 In a more desperate move, I tried to hock my bike and my camera, to cover bills. Nobody would take the camera, since it's battery is dead. One place offered to give me about $50, if I put in a new battery first. Duh!!! That's barely more than the cost of the battery!! Another shop wasn't interested in it at all, but would loan me $80 on the bike. Sounds alright, you say? Well what the hell do you know, and who asked you anyway?! See, it's an Aluminium Cannondale, for better or worse, with lots of fancy extras, which I paid well nigh on $1600 for, so a loan on this collateral for $80 is a pathetic tragic joke. What's that come out to? Well, 5%. Bla. 
 Well, as luck has it, see, I planned on calling the rest of the sleasy pawnshops in LA to ask them first, and was just about to when the mail came this morning, so I figured I'd just check that first, and lo! I got my unemployment check!! Saved! Not only that, but I get another check before officially losing my 'unemployed' status. 
 Wish me luck; I start this coming monday, and I'm the entire user support team!"

I stayed up late making it the bestest site there is in the whole wide world! 
Maybe I'll actually get the nifty Java backend to work again someday. 
Check it out if you're not behind any really stupidly configured (M$)proxies; if you are, check it out when you get home. Many of the links are actually just links to randommish pics I posted, but need to be clicked on in order to be viewed...I think that adds to the suspense, making it almost like a game! So, go play!"

"event","So, one of the scary skinhead network BOFHs just came by looking for a win9x box, but I know of no such specimen that we would've allowed to remain in our midst so I lent him my 98 install cd insted. I hope I don't forget. I always forget when I lend people stuff, then I just forever after wonder whatever happened to it. So, all I'm saying is, just don't let me forget. Now that I keep this ever so secret diary (dairy?), I might remember stuff better. 
 What was I talking about again? 
Oh yeah, so anyways I still think those thingies are ugly and wierd. Oh and you know how when you do that stuff happens, like when I press this here button"

"event","Er, or would that be heroinne?
Anywho, it was her super bril idea to defer my car payments in order to catch up on the expensiveness of life in general. Of course, I do still have to wait for a callback from that company; I just called them a bit ago, and the deferment department was busy, or something. So...they'll call be back within 24 to 48 hours. Maybe 'business hours'. 
Oh well, anyhoo, that's, as they say, that. I will now attempt to refinance the thing...I called my longest suffering credit union; and they want to make me fill out YALA (Yet Another Loan Application). 
 I'm still tormented by Sally's idea that I sell the car, and get a new bike, in the name of debt reduction. The very idea of riding a motorcycle in the terrifying commuter traffic gets my systolic and diastolic pressures exceeding thier recommended levels. Will have to save some cash when deferring payments to finance a move nearer here, with a less scary commute."

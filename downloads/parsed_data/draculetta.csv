he spoke to me in perfect algorithms....
such sweet soothing sounds of evil....

Ahhhhh, the darkness and despair of love!!

Now I see through my boyfriend's thinly masked bullshit!!!

Now I see how he tells me he loves me then screws the neighbors' wife in our living room while I'm picking up beer for him at Price Chopper!

Dirty little gremlins stabbing at my heart with the pitforks of capitalism! Stab away you little f-ers... Get one in for Microsoft!

Damn you all!!

Oh, that's right, I forgot: You're so great and happy and in control....

Let me ask you a question:

When you're all tucked away in your little castles, and you hear your husband's car start up in the garage at 3am...

Do you know where he's going?

Are you SURE he's not just banging the flavor of the month?

I TOLD my ex-beau already:

You want the flavor of the month, you go to Baskin Robbins baby, cause I am Draculetta...

Queen of the Druids!

Funny.... I don't look Druish.....

ha ha ha ha!!!!!

back to the sweet arms of sadness boys and girls......"

I am indeed a dark shadow lurking under the bridge...

A storm cloud hovering on the horizon...

but I am no Angel...."

"event","I feel sorry for those of you still clinging to your physical domain....

I Draculetta, harlot of Champy, have freed myself from such worldly cares...

Now, my sexuality glides
along with the midnight winds-
It swirls round with darkness.
and not just any darkness,
but the kind that permeates
all known matter.
The type that slices
through the silence-
toward truth.

I have mysterious ways and an even more mysterious mind."

in my head.
Darkness took her slender arms
and folded them around death's muscular shoulders...
What happened next is frightening...
the result was me."

"event","I had an epiphany the other day as I was taking a smoking break outside of the McDonald's where I work (temporarily-until the whole artist thing pans out....) 

So there I am, standing next to the dumpster, the smell of soggy cardboard and rancid milk making me want to vommit... But I'm just hanging out there taking it easy, taking in the colors, contemplating life's unfairness...

Then suddenly some jackass in a Yugo starts taunting me... Some fat, well dressed, presumtuous nazi with puffy white cheeks starts to giggle becuase I'm smoking next to a dumpster... 

He gives me the classic line ""don't you know smoking is bad for you?""

What bull$hit!! OH, I know, Cancer, Heart Disease, Blood Pressure.. yada yada yada

I'M NOT FREAKING SCARED, OK?

I will do what feels good, period. All you guys who let that stuff scare you are really being cowards, if you think about it. 

You're too SCARED to smoke. Why don't you run to your mommies and have them fix you a warm mug of milk, you bunch of overwight, spineless, whining pu$$ies!

I, on the other hand, live heroically... 

NOTHING scares me, especially the darkness of death...

I say, bring it on... Death is lovely in its own right.."

Oh that sacred emotion of fabled lore!

Come back to me ye fleeting feeling!

For I am Draculetta...

Sorcess of the night and Lake Champlain...

Mistress of Champy the sea monster!!!

Half spider, half woman...

Crawling along the edge of insanity."

So now I'm saying hello to the sweet arms of sadness....

Hello to that beautiful melancholy... Those nights of razorblades and black nail polish...

Those mornings of dark violets washed in frozen dew

hello sadness"

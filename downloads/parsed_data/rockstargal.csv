"event","So, its almost spring break, which means its almost my 21st birthday...YIPPEEEE!!  Everyday is one day closer and believe me I am counting down the days.

So school really sucks right now.  My cohort coordinator is a real jerk and I am totally not having fun under his tutilege.  Apparently, he lives in some sort of alternate universe where college kids don't have jobs or social lives and there are at least 35 hours in a day.  Each day, I just want to hit him over the head with a blunt object to knock him back to the reality that we live in.  I exercise sooo much restraint!  Anyways, he's really pissing me off.  I am seriously considering changing to another cohort next semester because he keeps warning us that its just gonna get worse.  None, and I mean NONE of the other cohorts have to do nearly as much extra work as we do.  Its completely unfair and not to mention unrealistic to load us down with so much when most of us are trying to stay afloat and support ourselves,juggling school and jobs.  UGH!!!!

Well, I am trying not to bog down with my complaints about school, so now I am going to talk about something else.....and the topic is: SPRING BREAK!!!  Its almost here and I could not be happier.  I get to see and hang out with Debra, which is prolly going to be the most fun.  I literally haven't seen her since before Christmas, so its totally time now.  We are gonna do all kinds of fun stuff, including getting another tattoo and getting completely shit-faced on my birthday.  Much fun will be had by all I am sure!!!  People at work are even excited about my birthday, waiting anxiously to take me out to the club and get our drink on.  

I love my coworkers!!  They are really the bomb diggity.  It reminds me a lot of when I worked at Friday's.  People all hang out and the atmosphere is really fun.  Most of us hang out outside of work and have a good time.  Plus, during the work day, I am really never bored because we all have fun.  Work is more enjoyable than sitting at home, which is something I thought I would never say.  

Alrighty, well I guess I should prolly pay attention in class now.  UGH!!  I hate sitting thru classes where all the information is common knowledge.  Its a totally of waste of not only my time, but also my $$$$$$.  Such is college I guess"

"event","Ok, so I came across this passage in ""Mansfield Park"" by Jane Austen and I thought it was just beautiful.  Its a statement made by Henry Crawford to Fanny Price, who doesn't think that she is worthy of the love of such an accomplished man.  I just though I would share it with all my girls out there who love to read statements like this.  I would want a guy to say something like this to me.  So, here it is:

""They shall prove that, as far as you can be deserved by anybody, I do deserve you.  You are infinitely my superior in merit; all that I know.  You have qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in  such degree in any human creature.  You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what-not merely beyond what one sees, because one never sees anything like it-but beyond what one fancies might be.  But still, I am not frightened.  It is not by equality of merit that you can be won.  That is out of the question.  It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest, who loves you the most devotedly, that has the best right to a return.  There I build my confidence.  By that right I do and will deserve you; and when once convinced that my attatchment is what I declare it it, I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes.""

Isn't that beautiful?  The whole book is soo awesome!!  I recommend it highly.  I have to say now, that I think Jane Austen is definitely my favorite author.  Hope yall enjoyed the passage!"

"event","Ahhh...its finally Friday, which means another week has flown by.  The weeks seem to be flying by lately, which I guess is a good thing.  Spring Break is slowly approaching, which also means that my birthday is coming soon!!  WOOHOOOO!!!  I am so excited.  

More than that though, I am excited to see and hang out with my family again.  I am seriously missing all of them, especially the kids.  I seriously have only been going home once every month, and its hard being so disconnected from all the people that I wish I could see everyday.  Does anyone else get in those moods, or is it just me?  I know that most people don't miss their families when they are at college, but I miss mine a lot.  Its because we are all soo close.  I would say that my family are more of my friends than some of my friends here in austin...I mean, my two aunts are the ones who want to take me out one night for my 21st birthday and get me drunk!  If that's not a close family, then what is?  

But anyways.....things are going good right now.  School is keeping me sooo busy, which is nice.  The new job is going pretty well too.  All the people I work with are so nice and the job is pretty easy.  Today was super busy!!!  I get to give tours of the complex, which means that I don't have to sit down all day and I get to interact with people a whole lot.  There are worse jobs out there!  I'm just glad that they are all so flexible with my schedule and that I don't have to drive anywhere!  Plus, they aren't open later than 8pm, which is nice when I work during the week.  Good stuff all around.

Tomorrow, if I don't have to work, is going to be shopping day!  I have to get a new pair of khaki pants for work, and I need to get some other dressy type pants to wear student teaching and/or work.  That's the only thing I hate about new jobs is having to buy new clothes.  I hate shopping ,especially here in austin because I have to drive pretty far to get a mall.  That sucks!  I am so spoiled living in Irving and having to drive five minutes to go to the ghetto Irving mall.  Its crazy the kind of things you miss about home...

Alrighty, well I guess I should go and relax from my day of work, very stressful you know!  

OMG!  There is one thing that I have to vent about---My roomates are slobs!  Our sink is completely full of dirty dishes when the dishwasher is only inches away.  Why not put the dishes in there instead of leaving them in the sink to stink up the house.  And it does smell because no one cleans up after themselves.  I do, ofcourse, but I refuse to clean up other people's shit!  Even the counters are full of dirty dishes because the sink is full and everyone seems to forget about that great invention called THE DISHWASHER!!  Geez ladies, we are women, not yucky dirty college boys.  We should make some effort not to live like slobs.  Our floor also hasn't been vacumned in months, yes months!  Both of our vacumns were lent out to friends of my roomates and no one has returned them, or even bothered to ask for them.  Our carpet is gross and my room too.  I wish I could vacumn it, but alas, there isn't a vacumn!  SO, I am guessing that tomorrow I will buy one, since I'll need one when the slobs move out!  Anyways, its irks me and I had to vent!!  UGH!!"

So last week was extremely exhausting and I am sure that this week will be just the same.  I've started my new job, so that adds a whole lot stress and eliminates a lot of my free time, but that is what being an adult is all about.  Plus, it pays my rent, so I gotta do it.

My mom and Doug came and had lunch with me today on their way home from San Antonio.  Much love to free meals!!  I got to see my mom's engagement ring and it is just GORGEOUS!!!!!!  Diamond's really are a girls best friend, and by the looks of my mom's ring, she's got a lot of best friends.  Her ring is more than just a solitaire diamond, there are several diamonds in it!  Its super nice!!

So I did my reading for tuesday for my reading assessment and development class, which is scary because I am working ahead.  Anyways, so I go to post it and guess what?  The server that controls where we post our responses is down!  UGH!!!!  I try and be studious and this is how I am repayed.  Craziness!!!  I hate technology sometimes, ya know?

I am seriously counting down the days until I am 21 now!  It seems so close, yet so far away.  Mike's birthday is on Sunday and I told him I would take him to dinner for his birthday.  That means that he gets to drink and just get to sit there and watch him...how bad does that suck??  I know that you are feelin me on this one Deb!!  Watching all your friends turn 21 around you is not a cool feeling!  But, its ok cause I only have 27 days.

Well, that's about it for now.  Just chilling here, listening to my new cd that I bought yesterday.  Maroon5 is totally awesome!!!"

"event","Ok, so if I were Picasso right now, I would definitely be in my blue period.  Everything that can and will go wrong has happened to me in a a span of 3 days. I've hard car trouble out the ass, including $400 worth of work done today AAAAHHHH!  It just seems like one thing after another.  I don't mean to sound melodramatic or anything, but really things are sucking right now!  

Even my professor is angry with me because I couldn't go to my observations yesterday.  I went out to my car early in the am to head on out and my car wouldn't start!  It was deader than a door nail.  So that must be my fault right?  Well, according to my professor it is.  He ""understands"" car problems, but I ""should have taken care of my responsibilities"".  Can you believe that???  What a jerk!!  ITs not like I invented car trouble in order to miss my observations.  I love my class and I love my kids, so it hurt me to miss, especially when I had my lesson plans already done and was excited about it.  Anyways, he just made me feel like crap.  My gosh, I am trying.  Things just really are not easy for me right now.  And as if that wasn't bad enough, he critiqued one of my responses to an article that we have to read.  In the responses, we are supposed to give our OPINION of the article, our OPINION.  I wasn't too keen on the article, but I articulated some points that I thought were important and then gave reasons why it was not my favorite.  He disagreed and said that there were ""gaps in my logic"".  Hello!!!!  Its my OPINION and I don't have to like it.  UGH!!!!!!  Can't a girl catch a break?

So, if you add all that bull crap on top of everything else going wrong and what do you get?  You get, the blue period.  The time when you want to just lock yourself in your room and not come out.  Unfortunately, I have such a busy schedule that I can't do such a thing, so I have to go on with each day baring a chip on my shoulder!  Oh well, I guess that is just the wonderful world of being an adult in the real world....

All that biznass sucks.  Phooey!!  Not to mention the fact that Friday is Valentine's Day--the dreaded day for all single people.  I hate Valentine's Day when I am single.  This is like the 2nd year in a row that I don't have a date on this stupid holiday!  AAAAHHH!!  I haven't been on a ""Real"" date in soooo long and this just makes it worse.  I mean, what does a girl have to do to get a date around here?  Woe is me!!

Whew!  So I think that I have gotten all that stuff off my chest for now.  And I've prolly depressed everyone who read this, but oh well.  Sorry Guys!!  I guess I should go now and study for my stupid test that I have tonight.  Not cool, but that's life.  Hopefully *crosses fingers* things get better, cause they couldn't get much worse!!"

This week was absolute hell!!  I was just stretched way too thin, too many things to do and not enough hours in a day.  It was not cool.  Hopefully this week will be better tho, because I cannot have another week like that and expect to survive.

But, a good thing did come out of last week-I got the job!!  Woohoo!!  I get to work in the office in my apartments and live rent free!  That is like the best deal ever.  I'm not starting until late next week, so I still have a couple of days before my schedule gets 10x worse, but its all good!

Last night I went to the movies with Mike and we saw that new movie ""May"".  Ok, I don't know if any of you have seen the previews for it or heard anything about it, but whoa...Weird is not even close to describing that movie.  Creepy, disturbing, freaky, gory, etc... And even those terms don't come close.  I don't Mike is ever going to let me pick the movie again because of that.  

That's it for now.  Got to start my day and accomplish a lot (hopefully)."

I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that these are the last days of my college career and the ""real world"" is just waiting to let me in!!!!!

I went home this weekend to celebrate my mom's birthday and get my car fixed.  I took my mom to the movies on Friday afternoon because she totally rocks and I am such the great daughter!  On saturday, was the most fun.  Mom and I went to the mall to do lots 'o shopping and I have to say that mom is the sweetest.  She asked me to help her pick out her wedding ring.  Isn't that so nice??  I felt so special when she was asking me my opinion.  I absolutely could not be happier for her, but I really can't wait til she tells the family cause I am just dying!!!!!!!

Tomorrow is the day for my job interview and I sooo need the job.  It works so well for my schedule and its close enough that I really don't even have to drive, which is awesome in this stupid city (drivers here suck!!).  Hopefully all goes well, because the money is slowly dwindling in my checking account.  Paying rent today was soo not cool!

On a more uplifting note, today I had a complete breakthrough with the boy I am tutoring for my classes.  The past couple of times he has been really aloof and not as into the sessions as I would have liked. I've been trying so hard to bridge the gap and get him into things, but today it finally worked!!  I can not express how happy it makes me to know that he's finally interested and excited about our meetings. For any of you who have had tutoring experience with children, especially one-on-one is just the most rewarding thing.  I am soooo glad that our meetings are more enjoyable for him because that makes them more enjoyable for me.

Lots of good things going on with tutoring and student teaching right now.  I am way crazy about all my kiddos and the experience I am getting is amazing.  My wish is that everyone who is in college now and about to embark on their careers has as much passion and excitement about beginning thier careers as I am.  Everyone should be experiencing the shear joy and felicity that I am right now!!

That's it for now. Gotta go work on some lesson plans and get ready for a meeting."

I am way proud of myself because for once in my life I am totally organized and actually completing work ahead of time!!!  I know its sounds crazy, but its true!!!!  Don't know what has gotten into me this year????

So this weekend has been not so fun.  The little lovely children that I work with during the week decided to give me all their little icky nasty germs, so I've been sick for the most part.  But, I am feeling a lot better already, so that's good.  Friday was a pointless day.  I literally stayed in bed all day and slept.  It was actually kind of nice.  Much love to having Friday's off!!!  Saturday, I felt a lot better so I went to run errands and get my car checked out.  Let me just say, I HATE MY CAR!!! Saturdauy was my day to get stuff done and I did just that.  I got Tuesday's homework done, which is quite shocking.  I also went to see a movie with my roomate and her friend. So, naturally I have to give a movie review:

Ok, so we went to see 25th hour, that new Spike Lee movie with Edward Norton.  It was actually pretty good.  It just furtherd my notion that Edward Norton is a phenomenal actor!  Every movie he's in, he just steals it.  I liked the movie and I liked the ending because it left you kinda guessing. Spike Lee did a good job in letting the audience think about what the character is going to do.  It was a good flick!

Today has been a lazy, but productive day.  Does that make sense?  I've gotten a lot of work done, but I feel like I've done nothing.  I haven't left my apartment because I really didn't need to.  Plus, its still cold and I'm still sick.  Don't much feel like prolonging the illness.  I've already done most of Thursday's homework and started to work on my lesson plans for the week.  I am absolutely horrified at my current lack of studiousness!!  

This week is Debra's Birthday and my Mom's Birthday!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  I'm really bummed tho cause I thought that I was going to be able to make a quick trip down to FT Worth on wednesday for Deb's b-day, but its not looking good.  But, I am going home this weekend for mom's bday, so I am hoping *crosses fingers* that I have some time to see Deb and Em!!

Ohhhhh, I forgot to mention...it looks like I may have a job pretty soon.  My apartments called me this week and told me that I am one of the final people they are considering, so that's good.  I waaaaay need a job and waaaay need some $$$$.  Having a job at my apartments would be soo dope because I don't have to worry about going anywhere-I can walk to the office and don't have to worry about wasting gas!  WOOHOO!!!!!  

That's it for now...gotta go back to being super productive!  Hope everyone has a good weekend and a great week!!"

"event","Whew!  Well, the first week is over and so is the first weekend of the semester.  The countdown has begun!!

My week was actually quite nice. A little overwhelming, but seeing as how I am so close to the end of college, its bound to be a little overwhelming.  My classes are pretty good, except for the amount of work that is required.  Basically I have to be at two Austin schools for tutoring/observation.  Plus, one of my classes that is not in my block requires mandatory volunteer hours, so just add that to my hours I already have to accomplish and you what do you get?  The answer is: NO FREE TIME!!  I think that all my instructors are under the impression that there are more than 24 hours a day.  I am just going to have to be super duper organzied and time managed this semester and from here on out.

Friday was nice because I don't have classes!  WOOHOO!!!  So, I ran errands, which consisted of buying books, and then I went to see ""The Hours"", the new movie with Nicole Kidman.  I went alone, which was an interesting experience.  It was kind of nice to go see what I wanted, sit where I wanted, and just enjoy the movie.  But it was a little akward walking in and sitting alone, but I soon got over that.  Ok, so back to the movie.  I have to say that I left the movie so depressed.  It was a very somber, introspective movie film.  I thought with all the hype that it would be like an amazing movie, but I was a little disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't the best one I've seen lately.

Saturday, I spent the day with my grandpa and Linda and Pete.  We went shopping and I got this fabulous outfit for under $20!  Much love to Khols clearance sales.  So now, I have one dressy outfit to wear when I do my student teaching, because, oh yeah, we have to dress up when we go to the schools.  Not cool, but its only two days a week, so I guess I can deal.  

After the shopping extravaganza, we just chilled at the house before going out to dinner to celebrate Pete's 23rd birthday.  We went to this super fancy restaurant called Flemmings.  It was mad yummy, but the atmosphere was fancy schmancy.  We had wine with our meal, bottles of wine, and I did not get carded.  They just poured me glass after glass.  I'm not a big wine fan, so I really didn't drink that much, but that's not the point.  Our bill was over $400 dollars, but with plates priced anywhere from $23 to $40, so its not a surprise.  But it was really cool and I didn't have to pay a dime, so that's all the matters.  After dinner, I just went home and watched tv before going to bed.  It wasn't a thrilling saturday night, but oh well.  I was tired, so I went to bed.

This brings me to today, Sunday.  As I like to call it, football day.  I plan on doing my laundry and watching football today, and watching the Golden Globes tonight.  Not that I care that much, but its an awards show and I seem to be addicted to awards shows, so its all good.  Doesn't my Sunday sound intriguing??  I know you are jealous :~)"

"event","This is yet another thrilling and exciting update from yours truly!!  As you can probably guess, nothing really exciting happend on my second first day of class, but here's the run down-

Day 2--This class, my reading development and assessment class is mostly my student teaching.  But, there is a small part of it that is actual class work.  That actual class work is going to be quite time consuming.  We have to write a short paper, critique some readings, and do a project.  While it sounds fairly easy, I assure you it isn't.  I have to accomplish all this, plus do all my student teaching and at some point, work!  This is going to be very stressful.  I did get my assignment for my teaching this semester, and I am at Cook Elementary in a bilingual Kindergarten class.  This is definitely going to be a challenge.  Hopefully, it will all be worth it in the end!

So that was my tuesday class.  We also learned how to use our expensive as hell piece of crap mac computers.  Fun fun!  

That's it about for now.  Tonight is my ALD 327 class from 7-10pm, which means that I miss my shows.  But thankfully, someone invented vcr's so that I can tape my shows and watch them later!  Tomorrow we get to go to Metz elementary, which is the school that I will be teaching at next semester for the rest of my education at UT.  No pressure or anything!!

Oh, this should amuse Debra: today I was looking thru some cd's and I found our ""Boys Suck"" cd that we made.  Bring back some memories???  So I listened to it and it brought back memories, memories of stupid stuff.  It just got me thinking about the stupid things we do sometimes, especially because of guys, guys who are sooo not worth it.  Gosh! I mean, I can't imagine if things would have worked out for me and Linden and Debra and Ronnie!  What a pitiful existence that would be??  It wouldn't have lasted long, but still....I am soooooo glad we past that bridge.  And now I can just sit, listen to the cd, and laugh.  HaHaHa!!

Alrighty, well I gotta start my lovely, long day.  Its sure to be an uneventful one."

"event","So, I am sure that you are all anxious to hear how my first of three first days back (does that make sense?)went!! Well, here it is:

Day 1=  Today's class was Guiding Young Children In Groups, with an emphasis on Pre K and Kindergarten classrooms.  The Professor, Tim, as he likes to be called, is quite the humorous guy.  He's very easygoing, with tons of experience, which is helpful when teaching future teachers how to be teachers.  We did all kinds of get to know you exercises since the people that are in my class are going to be in all my classes from now until graduation.  We don't have any tests, nor a final in this class which me likes very much.  We just have a bunch of easy papers and two hard projects, but I am not too worried about it.  Unlike all my classes before, I actually care about this class and doing well in it.  

So, all in all, my Monday class is going to be no biggie.  We only meet once a week, and next week there is no class due to Martin Luther King Day.  Let's hope that Tuesday and Wednesday's classes bode just as well.

Hope everyone had a great first day back!!"

Today is a yucky day outside, so I decided to go to the mall and spend my gift certificates.  I got awesome deals and I didn't even use all the money on my gift card.  I got this way cool shirt at Foleys that was marked down to $3.24.  I was totally pumped and I cannot wait to wear it. I also went to Bath & Body Works and bought lots of smell good stuff.  Overall, it wasn't a bad trip to the mall, which was a relief.

After a week of doing absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing, its the last two days before the next semester begins.  I am anxious/excited/nervous all in one.  I am looking forward to having something to do during the day, which is cool.  But, I start my student teaching, which is a little intimidating.  I know that after a couple days, I will totally feel at ease, but its those first couple of days that are nerve racking!  I love teaching and I think that I will be good at it, but we shall see!

Well, I think that's it for now.  As usual, nothing exciting is going on.  I am planning to start writing again, but I am not sure if it will be fan fiction.  I know, you're thinking that I am following in FictionLyn's footsteps, but its soo not true.  I have just been feeling really creative right now and very few ideas have to do with fan fiction.  Who knows, I may travel back down that path and attempt to restart/finish Emily's story, but don't count on it.  We'll just see how the process goes.  I find writing very theraputic, so whatever therapy I need to find in a particular story, I am gonna run with it.

That's the end for now!!!


Oh yeah, I just wanted to say ""Hey"" to Deb, who I totally miss!  Hope things are going well for you and your semester starts off super!  You need to plan a trip to Austin very very soon!!  I have Fridays off, so its all good. 


PS--Much love to a semester where I spend less than $150 on books!!  Quite a change since last semester's $425."

"event","Well, I can actually say that I did it.  I tried out for American Idol on wednesday afternoon.  I did great at my audition, and so Kim, but we didn't get callbacks.  Neither one of us cared though.  We did our best and that's all that matters.  At least we got to audition because over 2000 people were turned away and unable to audition.  Plus, we even heard some people there who obviously thought they could sing, when in fact they couldn't, so we felt that at least we deserved to be there.  I felt good and I had fun at the audition and I did it.  That's the important thing, that I actually did it.  I actually took steps to try and live out a dream of mine and that makes me just as happy as if I had actually gotten a callback.  I didn't just sit there and let an opportunity pass me by.  It was a great experience and I wouldn't have done anything different.

The audition did make me realize how much I miss singing and auditioning.  I always enjoyed trying out for region choir and all that jazz and I miss it.  I'm going to make an effort to get out there and do more singing and auditioning.  Granted, finishing school is my first priority, but I would still like to pursue music.  It was in my life for so long and I love it too much just to quit cold turkey.

Well, that's all I have to say for now. I am way too sick from sleeping outside in 40 degree weather to have done anything productive today and went to bed at 9 last night, waking up at 10 this morning.  So, I am going to go make dinner and then settle in for a little tv and then go to bed, doping myself up on NyQuil to help me sleep!

PS:  Thanks so much to Deb and Kasey and Laura and Sara and Kristen who lent their support to me during my auditions for American Idol.  Yall are the greatest and you don't know how much it eased the nerves to hear your encouraging words.  Especially you Deb!!  I miss you and I know you would have been right there with me if your car could have made the trip.  I love ya girlie!!!!!!!!"

"event","Happy Halloween everyone!!

Well, its October 31 and for once I am actually not going out for Halloween.  I know, its a night I can actually go out and the weather is very halloween-ish, but still.  I have a lot of stressful weeks coming up and have had a hell of week last week, so tonight I am going to relax.  My roomate, who has had a bitch of a week, and I are going to watch some serious Thursday night television and drink.  That will be my halloween this year. I am way excited though, so that's all that matters.

As much fun as I am going to have tonight, I almost wish that I had enough guts to drive to dallas and go spend halloween with my family.  I missed it last year, and the year before, and now this year.  Jared and Andi are really missing me, and I am missing them, and they wanted me to go spend halloween with them sooo bad.  Plus, this is Noah's first halloween and I bet he looks sooo cute.  But, I can't spend my whole day driving to dallas, spending a couple hours, and then driving back.  Its just too much, especially in the piece of crap school I am now driving.  So there's my boohoo of the day!

I registered today and it was great.  Usually registering makes me want to go on a shooting spree, but not this time. It took me a whole 5 minutes to do it all.  None of my classes were full and I got them all.  I'm so glad that I finally got to the point where its not a pain to register.  Woohoo!!!!!!!!!!

I'm not looking forward to the weekend!  I can't belive I just said that, but I'm not.  My weekend will be spent entirely at the library.  And I mean entirely.  I have two essays (4 pages each) for my history class, plus I have to read and make a significant dent in my HUGE paper that is due on the 19th.  Did I mention that I have a test on tuesday as well?  Fun times huh?  This is going to be the longest time I have spent at the library since I started school here.  Oh what an exciting life I lead!!!  (note the sarcasm)

Well, that's about it for now.  Nothing even remotely interesting happening and nothing remotely interesting predicted for the future."

"event","Yeah, so Deb told me I needed to update my journal, so I am.  School has been unbelievably crazy this semester and I haven't really had a lot of time to update the journal, but I need to try harder to set a couple minutes away for updating...

Nothing really exciting is happening to me really.  I am working really hard in all my classes and getting really anxious about starting to student teach in the spring.  Its all happening so fast, college I mean, and I never thought it was so close to being over.  But it is, and that's a little scary.  In less than two years, I will have to support myself completely on a teacher salary.  Not just that, but I will be responsible for a class full of young students.  Its a intimidating and daunting, but I guess that is all part of the new teacher nerves.  I'm gonna be starting my career, what I am gonna do for the rest of my natural life.  Whoa!  Ok, I need to stop talking about this cause I'm getting a little overwhelmed right now.

Like I said, nothing is going on with me except school, so unfortunately I really don't have a lot to update.  I am ready for this semester to be over because I hate my Age of Reformation class, but oh well.  I swear that my professor had to be a nazi in her past life because she totally tortures us!  

I am anxiously awaiting my trip to New York!!  Everytime I talk to Nathan we talk about it and he's just as excited.  The army vs navy game is gonna be such an amazing experience.  That is what is getting my through this semester-the fact that at the end, I get to go to NYC!  Come on NYC!!!!!!!!!!

Ok, so that's it for now.  Unfortunately, I have to go to class, but hopefully I will update again this week!"

"event","Whew!!!  This semester already has me soo completely busy, its not even funny.  Add to that the job search and I have like a ton more stress.

My classes are pretty hard this semester.  I totally think they are harder than anything I've taken before.  Mainly because there is just SOOOOOOOO much reading!  Oh well, I guess I will survive.

I got a job at bath and body works, but it would only be like 4 hours a week.  So, I decided to keep that job and then find another one, so that I would be working two jobs.  I dig the perks that I get with the B&BW job, so I feel the need to do it.  I've applied at a bunch of places, so hopefully this week I will get some calls.

Here's some random news:  BJ called me last night.  Just out of the blue he called to see how I was doing.  It was cool actually.  Apparently him, and Ryan, and Jeremy are doing really well.  There apartment is nice, so they say, and they've been pretty busy.  Good for them I guess.

So, that's pretty much it.  Just school, school, and more school.  Oh yeah, and work.  Boring Boring me.







PS--just to let you know how much homework I had this weekend, I watch the entire marathon of Sorority Life on MTV.  I saw the entire season in one day.  And I got totally addicted."

"event","Ok, since nothing else even remotely interesting is happening in my life, I thought I would devote this entry to my critique of the MTV VMA's.  So here it goes.....

Thought this years' was better than last year by far!

But what is up with everyone singing over themselves??  It was like a Britney concert all night.

I love rock music and I totally dig the Vines and the Hives, but I couldn't make out one single word that either band sang.  Maybe it was just me, but it really helps when your audience can understand what you are singing.

Britney and Christina looked pretty trashy.  Christina's hair looks like a zebra.  

I love Gwen Stefani, but what the hell was she wearing????  And on that fashion note, why was everyone wearing black???  The MTV awards are the time for outrageous and vivid fashions and tonight looked so blah!!

As for Justin's performance, well..he did good.  His dancing was awesome!  He was also doing that singing over himself stuff and I wasn't crazy about it, but I could pick out a few parts where he was really singing solo.  All in all, he did a good job.

Ok, so I love Eminem and think he's totally kick ass...but, he was just flat out rude during one of his speeches.  I understand that he has issues and all, but geez.

Pink, ok performance, but that whole being drunk thing and announcing it to the whole country was definitely not cool.  I know MTV isn't made for children, but you gotta know that a lot of kids were watching.  

And in conclusion, by far, the greatest part of the whole show was Guns N Roses performing!!!!!!!  I am a total GNR fan and was soooo happy that they came on the show.  That was just amazing.  Way to go MTV!  I don't know how they got them to perform, but bless them.  I grew up listening to GNR and seeing them perform again after so long was just soooo kick ass!!!!!!!!!!

So yeah, there's my take."

It feels so good to be back in Austin after spending a whole summer at home.  I love my family and it was nice to see them everyday, but I love being back on my own.

Summer is ending and a new semester about to begin.  I am excited, but already stressing.  I got my books today and all I can say is ouch!  None of the books look even remotely interesting.  Oh well, its my last semester of regular classes, so I am going to try and make the most of it.

The past summer was definitely interesting at times, but also totally boring!  I honestly didn't do a whole lot, except for those times when I drank entirely too much and hung out with a not-so-nice group.  I am glad I got over that pretty fast.  Didn't get to spend as much time with Deb and Em as I would have liked, but there's not much I can do about it now.  

My mom and I hung out a lot and got pretty close.  I just LOVE my mom.  She is just the greatest!!  My sis and I hung out a little bit and had some fun.  And just recently my Aunt Annie had a baby, little Noah.  He is just the most precious little thing ever.  I got to spend a lot of time with him when he was first born and I totally miss him now.  HE is just so cute!!!!

But anyways....I am glad summer is over and looking forward to classes.

So that's about it for now.  Just trying to get things back to normal here in the lovely city of Austin."

"event","I know this is getting awfully mundane, but its been a long time since I updated.  Its just that nothing even remotely interesting is happening to me that merits updating the journal...oh well!

One thing that is kind of interesting is that I haven't hung out with the guys in like a week.  Its nice, but at the same time I miss them.  I definitely feel more girly by not hanging out with them, but at times I miss their male antics.  

So mostly, I have been spending a lot of time reading and hanging out with the fam.  I am totally addicted to yet another fiction writer(thanks to Deb), plus I am reading the 4th Harry Potter book and Lord of the Rings.  Needless to say, I've been somewhat of a bookworm recently.  But surprisingly enough, I am ok with it.  I enjoy reading for fun and I know that next semester I prolly won't have time to read anything fun, so I better catch up now.  I have to say that Lord of the Rings is a really awesome book and very addicting.  Seriously, I have to make myself stop reading.  I love books like that, but at the same time I hate it.

Deb and Em leave tomorrow for Florida and I am so jealous!!!  I wish I was going, but I know that there is obviously a reason why God would not allow me to go on the trip.  My guess is that he's trying to teach me a lesson for being so awful with money.  I am definitely the poster child for improper spending!  Oh well, I have no one to blame but myself...and ofcourse all the awesome bands who put out cd's that I can't live without, as well as movies I have to own, etc, etc, etc, etc.....

Well, for now, that's about it.  I am going to stay up for a little while longer to see if Lyn updates and then I am going to sleep.  My plan is to go work out before I go to work, but who knows if that will actually happen.  I am looking forward to getting back to austin and having a gym right where I live.  Its really hard to get motivated to go to the track near my house.  Such is life I guess.."

"event","Ever hang around a group of guys for way too long that you start to feel like you aren't a girl anymore??  Well, that is how I am starting to feel hanging around with BJ, Ryan, Jeremy, and Ollie.  It feels like I'm not a girl anymore when I'm with them.  I'm just this person that they can talk about/do anything with...only, I happen to have breasts.

I love the guys to death, don't get me wrong.  They are prolly the greatest guys to have around.  But sometimes, you just want to feel like a girl, instead of one of the guys.  I don't feel pretty or girlie or even remotely feminine when I hang out with them and I HATE that.  I'm a girl, I like to be girlie, and pretty, and appreciated, and teased, and innocent.  I really loathe the fact that suddenly its ok for them to talk about when they jerk off, who has great tits, or fart in front of me.  None of that is very appealing to me no matter who it is.

Not to mention the fact that when I go out with them its almost impossible to pick up guys.  

I NEED some girl time!!!!!!!!!!  I need to go hang with Debra and Em.  I need to talk about NSync and google over how much I want to be Britney Spears.  I want to feel like a girl.  I want to be in a restaurant and check out guys without having a group of immature guys around me making a huge scene.  I want to feel the need to put make-up on and dress skanky just to go out.  I want to go on a date too!!!  

All this guy crap has even affected my writing.  It used to never be so hard for me to just start writing, but now it is.  I have tons of ideas, but I can't sit down and put them to work.  Why oh why>??????????????????????????????

So anyways...that is the crazy stuff going on in my life right now.  Other than that, things are boring.  Met Linden's new girl, that really sucked.  Saw Road to Perdition, which kicked ass!!!!!!!  

Oh well, at least I get to go hang out with Deb on Friday.  HOpefully that will be a nice change!"

School is over with for the summer, THANK GOD!!!!!!!!!!  I am very happy to be able to sleep late in the mornings now.  I think I made a B, but I won't know for a couple days.  Not that I care, but anyways....

Life has been pretty boring lately.  Hanging out with the same people, doing nothing.  I got to spend time with Debra on Friday which was totally awesome!!!  We just hung out and had fun.  I miss those times.  I feel like I don't get to spend enough time with her, especially now that I am actually in town and have the time.  It sucks and I honestly need to make a more conscious effort to go to Ft Worth cause I am really gonna miss her when I go back to Austin.  This semester I am sooo not going to be coming home very often cause I am gonna work like a mahd fool.  

I can't explain why I don't go out there more frequently because I have tons more fun hanging with her and Em than I do watching all the guys get high and such....

But that is going to change....

So I finally got caught up with Lyn and that makes me happy.  I am sooo anxious for her to post tomorrow!!!!  I wish that I had her talent, I really do.  I know that I say that a lot, but seriously.  Anyone who reads her will understand...

Gonna start writing again too.  I've had like 50 different ideas for the story now, so I seriously need to sit down and get started.  Granted, I keep saying that over and over, but still.

Well, that's about it for now.  Summer is pretty boring.  I hate to say it, but I am actually looking forward to the fall and school.  I just like being busy and challenged and all that stuff.  And boy am I gonna be busy and challenged in the fall....

Anyways....life has been pretty boring lately.  Friday night I got a little too drunk and don't remember a whole heck of a lot, but oh well.  At least I have great friends who took care of me.  Other than that though, life has been pretty uneventful.

I'm trying to really watch what I say on my journal now since Andy read it really recently.  So, if stuff starts to sound weird or something its because I am having to ""code"" my entires.  Not that it would be that difficult to figure it out I'm sure, but oh well.

So the aptly titled (by Deb and I at least) ""summer of get you some"" is definitely not turning out the way I had planned.  Granted, my plans were not very realistic as it is, but a girl can hope right?  For Deb, its going great however.  Which eventhough I am completely jealous, well except for the whole Ronnie fiasco,  I am still glad that at least one of us is accomplishing our goals...

Which brings me to a question that has been plaguing me recently.  Why oh why is it so hard for everyone to believe that I no longer have any romantic interest in Linden?????? I really just want to be friends with him now!!!!!!  I find him attractive, but I don't want to date him.  Eventhough I wouldn't mind if....wait...can't write that cause Andy might read this(since he has recently taken up the hobby of reading my journal).....Anyways, Andy doesn't believe me, neither does BJ or Ronnie, I think Deb only half believes me, and my mom certainly doubts me, as does my sister...I mean seriously, I've told the guy to his face that we are totally cool now as friends and yet no one takes my statement seriously.  Am  I doing something that suggests otherwise??? Granted, my drunken behavior the other night might contradict that, but hello, I was slightly intoxicated and totally not in control of my actions and speech.  Geez... I would just really like to know because its been bugging me lately.  And I don't want him to not believe me either cause apparently if everyone else doubts me I can only imagine what he thinks.  Oh well...I prolly won't figure it out, but if anyone knows, please fill me in.  

Anyways....can't really think of anything else to update about because like I said before, life is pretty boring.  I'm getting closer to working on chapter one of the new story, so Em should be pleased.  Once school is over with I can write a hella amount.  

That's it for now....hopefully something interesting or even remotely exciting will happen before too long so that I will actually have something to update that is worthwhile."

Anyways....school is boring.  Made an A on my first test without studying.  WOOHOO!!!!!!!!!!!  Made A's on all my quizzes so far.  Yeah, its not that interesting.

Went to Red Jacket on Sunday night and ran into Matt.   Well, let me just say one thing: DAAAAAAMMMMMNNN!!!!!!!!!!!  Could he have looked any better after all these years? I think not!!  I spent most of my night hanging out with him, which I enjoyed immensely!  He even bought me a drink.  It tasted about as yummy as he looked..which was pretty tasty!!!  We talked for a while and Deb and Em and I are going to Red Jacket tomorrow to hang out with him and his friends.

My job is going really well.  The kids are soo well behaved and a lot of fun.  Plus, I don't have to be there until 12 which is awesome!!!!!!

Anyways....that's about it for now.  It sucks that nothing exciting is happening, but that is usually how things are in my life.  OH well!!!"

"event","I am soo bored!!!  I can't wait until next week when I start my job so that I will have stuff to do during the day.  I just have to stay busy, that is just how I am.  

Ofcourse I should be taking advantage of the fact that I have a lot of spare time to be writing, but unfortunately I'm not.  I outlined some chapters, but haven't written anything solid yet.  Plus I am going to pull an Emily(you know I love ya) and start the story over.  I was reading last night and I just wasn't feelin it like I was.  So, I am starting over with chapter 1 and some of the stuff will be familiar, but some won't.  I just think that it would be a better story if I rewrite, so that is what I am gonna do.

Anyways, since nothing exciting is happening to me, that is really all I have to update with."

"event","Wow!  So it definitely has been a VERY LONG time since I updated my journal and since I have tons of other stuff I need to be doing this evening, I thought I would briefly update!

Finals were HELLLLL!  But thank the Lord, they are over with...made 2 A's and 3 B's which I am proud of considering how much I slacked off this semester.

Summer started off pretty boring.  Hung out with the Arlington crew like twice and got sick of them...but I am proud to say that I no longer have any interest in Linden other than strictly friendship.  Granted, it has taken me way too long to be able to say that, but alas I have reached that point.  

Just got back from Arizona yesterday.  My cousin graduated high school, so we went to that.  And let me just say that I am so thankful that our gradutation takes place indoors because theirs was outside in a 100+ heat.  Not very logical.  We went to the Grand Canyon which is absolutely amazing!!!!!! I recommend it very highly.  We also went tubing down the Salt River which was sooo fun.  All in all it was a fun, but short vacation.

Today I started summer classes.  It sux cause they are from 9:45 till 11:45 in the am, but its only 20 days.  My teacher is a real nut job, so at least it might be entertaining!  We have our first quiz tomorrow over the bill of rights and we have an exam every monday, as well as two quizzes each week.  OH yeah, and we have a group project.  But I only have to make a C in the class, so not a whole lot of effort will be put forth on my part.

Start my job next week, babysitting, so that will add a little excitement to my boring life.  Not to mention some much needed $$$$$$$$$$$$$$

That's about it for now.  Gotta go catch up on Lyn now...I am still on chapter 9 and she posted 11 today so I am in for some huge reading tonite!!"

"event","Ok, so its dead week and all, but something is baffling me...why do they call it dead week when we have finals starting wednesday?  There is nothing dead about having to study your ass off.  Plus, our last class day was friday, not wednesday.  If our last day had been wednesday and finals start this wednesday, then I could understand calling it 'dead week'.  But since that is the case, I think they should call it 'dead couple of days' instead of giving the impression that there is an entire week with nothing to do!

Whew!  I feel better now that I got that off my chest.

So I saw Dave Matthews Band on Thursday with my TCU crew and it was soooooooo awesome!!!  Dave rocks my world and puts on a kick ass show!  And he's a total hottie and I would love to see how those amazing guitar skills that he posseses work when they aren't playing..hehehe!!  Yes, I know, its bawdy and dirty, but who cares??  Dave is awesome and I completely recommend seeing a DMB show whenever you get the chance.  It is definitely an experience.

So I made an impromptu trip home this weekend so that my sis and I could get our mother's day shopping done since we couldn't do it any other time.  We did that Friday and amazingly enough we finished our shopping on Friday, so its all good.  Saturday I went out to eat with the fam and got to see my cousins Andy and Jared whom I adore to no end!  I just love those kids and can't wait to spend time with them over the summer.  I also got to see Aunt Annie and she told us that she is going to name the baby Noah Wade.  Isn't that a great name?  Little Noah was kicking up a storm at the restaurant and we all got to feel it.  It was sooo cool.

Then on saturday night I got to see ""Spiderman"".  I was sooo pumped about the movie and I drove my sister and Nick crazy being all goofy about it while we waited in line to get in.  I loved the movie, it was sooo good!  All except the very end when Kirsten Dunst has to say the most cheesy lines in the cemetery.  Other than that, it was totally rockin!!  Spiderman rulz!!!!!!

I turned my paper in this morning and it feels good to be done with it.  It turned out to be 7 pages, which is longer than I expected to write, but oh well.  But what sux is that I had to go spend $34 on a cartridge for my printer because of course, it decided to run out of ink when I needed to print my paper!  That pissed me off, but at least I didn't have to turn it in until 5pm, so it wouldn't have kept me from meeting the deadline.

I just got done laying out at the pool and now I am soo relaxed.  Its a shame that I have to go and study for hours on end, but at least I got some fun in the sun today!  I plan on going tomorrow too before I start my studying, so hopefully by the time I go to Arizona I will at least have some color.

Well I guess that I should go eat some lunch and them commence the studying.  Woohoo!!!!!!  Gotta love finals....wait...no, actually you don't!!"

I am constantly making lists of what I need to get accomplished and like groceries and stuff.  And I find that I actually stay on track and get more done when I make a list and can cross things off of it when I complete them.  

Yet another similarity between me and Miranda...I am such a dork.  I can't believe I am comparing myself with  fictional character, but oh well.  You know how we all secretly want to be one of Lyn's characters!!!!!!

Anyways, gotta go start the homework so that I can begin to cross things off my list!"

"event","Ok, so I found this passage when I was reading ""The Notebook"" by Nicholas Sparks, the same guy who wrote ""A Walk to Remember"", and I really liked it.  Just thought I would share it with yall:

     ""I am nothing special; of this I am sure.  I am a common man with common thoughts, and I've led a common life.  There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.
     The romantics would call this a love story, the cynics would call it a tragedy.  In my mind it's a little bit of both, and no matter how you choose to view it in the end, it does not change the fact that it involves a great deal of my life and the path I've chosen to follow.  I have no complaints about my path and the places it has taken me; enough complaints to fill a circus tent about other things, maybe, but the path I've chosen has always been the right one, and I wouldn't have had it any other way.""


I hope that one day I can look back at my life and say that no matter what happened, all the ups and downs, that I have no regrets. Anyways, I thought that was a great passage."

"event","Woohoo!  Its the last week of classes, thank God!  This is probably going to be the longest week of the whole semster, but its all good.

I had a pretty boring weekend as a whole.  Friday night I didn't go out cause I felt like crap.  I think I went to bed around 10 or so...pretty pathetic I know.  Saturday, instead of doing any of my homework I went to my uncle's house and saw my grandparents (they were visiting him).  I spent all day over there and got two free meals out of the whole thing!

Sunday I went and saw ""Life or Something Like It"", which was really good by the way, and then I did homework. From 3 until 12 all I did was work...I took an occasional break here and there, but still.

So saturday night I talked to Linden and needless to say he and I are friends again.  What can I say, I am putty in his hands and for some reason I need to feel like we are friends again.  Who knows.  He was telling me about how things were in his life and it was quite interesting.  Apparently he wants to get back together with Jessica, his ex.  Its here that he becomes such a girl!!  Jessica is being wishy-washy and making out with Linden's best friend right in front of him when she knows full well that Linden wants to get back together with her.  THen, later, she turns around and says that she wants to get back together too.  Ofcourse at that time he is recondsidering.  Its a constant back and forth now I like you/ now I don't thing.  

Here is where I put my two cents in because I have much experience with this sitaution... First of all, why on earth would you want to be with someone who is going to make out with your best friend in front of you, knowing your feelings????  That is not the kind of person that I want to be with, but maybe guys are different, I don't know.  Second, what kind of best friend do you have that will make out with a girl you like in front of you???  Not the kind of friend I want.  I can't understand why he still wants to be with her when she has such a blatant disrespect for his feelings, but whatever..

All this just further proves my point that guys are totally dense...Hello, get the picture!!  

But onto a more exicting and less stressful (at times at least) topic: my story.  I wrote a lot last night because my writers block suddenly disappeared and I knew that I had to write at that very moment.  I had sooo much fun writing what I did last night.  The pictures I had running through my mind were awesome!!!

I love writing, I really do.  I know that I am no Lyn or anything, but I'm a lot better than some fiction writers out there.  Writing makes me happy, and I know I've said that before, but it really does.  Its entirely up to me and whatever I want goes! I love that about it.  I guess its because sometimes I don't feel in control of things going on in my life, but when I'm writing I am in control.  Plus, with NSync fiction there is just soo much you can do!

I get another idea for a story as I was walking to the bus stop.  But first I have to write a story for myself!!  I think that my story is going to be kind of a prequel to the story I am writing now.  Its not for sure ofcourse, but I think it would be intersting and I've left some things out about Josh and I in this story that I can get explained in a prequel.  But writing a story about JC and I is definitely going to be a long time from now...must finish Em and Justin first!!  

I am so excited that I get to see Dave Matthews on thursday!!  Deb, Em, me and some other random people that I don't know in San Antonio seeing Dave...what a great way to celebrate the end of the semester.  Plus, finally Deb will get to see my apartment, which I have been tryign to get her to see for like a year now!!!!!!

Alrighty, well I guess that I should go get ready to register for classes. Its gonna suck and I am not looking forward to it, but that's part of life I guess.  Then off tonight to take a kiddie lit test. Oh what an exciting life I lead!!!!!"

"event","""But I never said that everything would be ok. And I never said that we would live to see another day... Motivate me, I want to get myself out of this bed. Captivate me, I want good thoughts inside of my head. If I fall down would come around pick me right up off the ground.
If I fall down would you come around, pick me right up off the ground""

Aww...gotta love Good Charlotte!!!

I seriously need some motivation to do something productive!  I didn't go to any classes today because my alarm didn't go off, so that was not in any way productive.  Then, I just sat around and was lazy for like forever.  I wrote a little bit in my story, but compared to the endless amount of homework and such that I have due in the next week, I wouldn't exactly call that productive.

Then I read a whopping 5 pages out of the 71 that I need to have read by tomorrow at 11.  Not exactly getting a whole lot done there.  Ofcourse I naturally got distracted and went to my room where I proceeded to pick up the third Harry Potter book and started reading that.

I could be productive and go to the review session for kiddie lit tonight, but that's not gonna happen.  All my shows are on tonight and while I could technically tape them, I'm not going to.  Plus, I have actually gone to kiddie lit the past weeks, so I don't see why I need to go to the session.  Living off campus makes you sooo lazy sometimes!

So I talked to my cousin Aimee today and we had an interesting convo.  She told me that she saw Linden yesterday I think it was.  She said that he told her to tell me Hi the next time she talked to me.  Ok, that surprises me.  Stupid boy hasn't spoken a word to me, not a word, since I found out about him and ashley.  NOT A FREAKIN WORD!!!!!!!!  And then he tells Aimee to tell me Hi...what kind of messed up crap is that??

Ofcourse that got me all emotional again.  Add to that the fact that I came across some stuff that I wrote during my Linden phase and that just made things worse.  I mean, I honestly don't think I can be friends with him anymore because he didn't treat me like a friend in any respect.  So, knowing that he didn't treat me fairly, why in the HELL do I want to work things out with him and be friends with him again??  Could someone please explain this to me!  Why in the world would I want someone back in my life who wasn't nice to me???  

Then I went on a pity party thinking I was wrong for acting like a bitch to Linden and the idea of apologizing to him crossed my mind.  I started to think that the next time I see him I would say I was sorry and that everything was my fault, yada yada yada....basically it would be me groveling at his feet, hoping that he would forgive my behavior in a drunken state.

Now, is this a good idea?  No, not entirely.  There is no reason for me to go groveling to some guy and taking all the blame for something that is not my fault.  You see, this is what guys do to girls.  I HATE it when they have this effect on you...it really sux ass!!!

Yet another reason my day has been unproductive...I've been thinking about all this Linden crap again.  When I wasn't thinking about him I was fine.  I was actually being a good student and getting a lot of work done, but not today.

Hopefully all this Linden stuff is stemming wholly from the fact that I just want some and Linden was the last somewhat decent (I in no way consider Adam a decent anything!!) guy that I got some from.  And I am definitely wanting some recently. I don't know why, but I have...Guess its just all the stress that comes with the last week of school I guess.  

Could this entry be more random??  I mean, geez, do I know how to float from topic to topic or what???

Today I was thinking that next weekend I might make a quick trip home to bring some stuff home for the summer.  When I come home after finals its gonna be like 8 at night when I finish my final, so I don't want to have to drive all the way back to my apartment and load a bunch of crap and then drive to Dallas.  Its already going to take forever to drive home and its gonna be dark, so the sooner I can get home, the better.  Who knows tho?  While this whole thing makes sense to me, it prolly won't make sense to anyone else.  Plus, I think my momma would be kinda pissed...which would mean I would have to stay somewhere else.  

And trying to find somewhere to stay is really a problem.  It used to be that I could just call up Andy and not have a problem  cause I wanted to be with Linden and Andy didn't care, but seeing as how Linden and I aren't speaking it might be odd for me to stay at his apartment.  And I don't want to bother Deb cause she'll be studying for finals and all that jazz, which I should be doing as well, but not the point.

Oh well I guess....So yeah, that's about it for now.  I've accomplished nothing today so far, I've put myself thru emotional stress over some stupid boy, etc...Honestly, could I have more issues???????????????

The good news tho is that in like 3 hours I will Monsters Inc on my computer.  WOOHOO!!!!!!!  That movie rocks!!  I watched A Walk To Remember yesterday, Monsters Inc tonight, and then hopefully Harry Potter this weekend!  Gotta love downloading movies off the internet for free!

I think I am gonna dye my hair again.  This time, it will be noticeable tho.  Its been long enough since I did it last time, so I may do it this weekend as a study break or something.  Fun times.....

Gotta go now and try to get something accomplished!"

WHY OH WHY....

1.  Why do we enjoy watching sad movies where we know that one of the main characters will die, yet we still cry???---Hello, I know its coming, its not a big shock, yet I still turn into a human fountain when it happens!  Especially ""A Walk to Remember"", ""Here on Earth"", ""My Girl"", and ""Love Story"".

2.  How come when you have the opportunity to get some from a 'friend with benefits' you don't really act on it, but as soon as something goes wrong between you, you suddenly crave it???---All I think I need to say here is Linden!

3. Why are movies that are based on books always soo different and never as good?--I read a walk to remember and it was soooo good.  Then I saw the movie, which was sooo different and not nearly as good.  I mean, I like the movie, but still.  Again, ""Jurassic Park"", ""Cider House Rules"", and ""Silence of the Lambs"" to name a few!

4.  Why do professors cram as much as they can into the last two weeks of classes?--We've had an entire semester to work on stuff, hello!  Spread it out over the semester, that's the logical thing to do.  If you are going to cram all the major stuff into the last two weeks, then classes should be two weeks long instead of an entire semester!  Just a thought..

5.  Why do hot dogs come in packages of 10, while hot dog buns come in packages of 8?--Not really a lot to say about this, except that it bugs me...oh, and I had hotdogs for dinner.  Who is the brainiac at the bun company who decided to goof on people like that?

6.  Why do professors grade the test that you feel confident about easily, while the test you struggled horribly with they go over it a vengance and show no mercy?--Happened to me in spanish.  The test we just took I felt really good about and our prof carelessly graded them and took off hardly any points.  Our first test, however, he graded as if we were native speakers!  And naturally, the first test was weighted more than our recent one.  Geez!!

7.  How come you always crave cookies, or any other dessert for that matter, when you don't have a single dessert item in your apartment?--Today I really wanted ice cream to make a milkshake, but do I have ice cream, oh no!  I also got a weird craving for oreos, but I don't have any of those either.  Ofcourse I don't feel like spending money and I am too lazy to go to the store to buy some.


I think that's about it for right now, but I am sure somethign else will bug me later. Plus, Law & Order is on..."

"event","So today I have actually done a lot, eventhough I am not nearly done doing everything I need to.

First off, I finished reading ""White Oleander"" by Janet Finch.  It was such a good book!  Then I read ""A Walk to Remember"".  THat was equally good!  IT was also sooo sad.  I started crying when I was at school today because of it.  It was good, but also very sad.  So I actually read an entire book today, so I was impressed with myself.

I actually did all my history homework too, which is soo unlike me.  

A surge of fiction creativity hit me today.  Many, many ideas for chapter 3 came into my mind today, so naturally, I wrote.  I am way excited about the story.  About 1/3 of the next chapter has been writte, and I am hoping that I can right another 1/3 tomorrow.  Who knows if it will happen, but ya know....Writing makes me happy!!  Just thought I would throw that in there.

I found out yesterday that my Aunt Annie is going to have a baby boy!  WOOHOO!!!!!!!  THat's what she wanted and I am soo happy.  ITs been way too long since we've had a baby in our family, and in september we'll have another one.  Babies are greatness!!  

it just hit me that next week is the actual last week of classes.  That is way soon.  And then it will be finals.  This semester has gone by way too fast, but I am soo glad to be done with it!

I think that's all I have to say for now.  Nothing exciting and I'm having trouble making any of my thoughts fit logically."

"event","Whew!  Yet another weekend has flown by...its almost as if my weekends seem to be getting shorter and shorter.  I feel like all I did was drive to Dallas and then drive back.

So this weekend was definitely a family visit.  I didn't see my friends at all.  Which, I love my friends to death, don't get my wrong, but it was nice to spend some time with my family.  I saw my dad and we did the birthday dinner thing, which was nice.  It like the first weekend in a very long time where I have actually spent the night at my own house for my entire stay.

I actually got a lot of homework done too, which is surprising since I never do work when I am at home, but ya know...

Sunday I auditioned for a group called The Ransom Notes.  I feel really good about my audition and I know I did my best.  Unfortunately, I didn't make it.  Surprisingly tho, I am not that terribly upset.  You would think that I would be since I am like super competitive and stuff, but I am not that upset.  I mean, yeah it sux, but that's life.  It just wasn't meant to be I guess.  God has some reason for me not to be a member of that group, and I guess I gotta respect that.  Maybe its a lesson in humility and a way for me to learn to accept that I am not always going to be the best at everything...whatever His reason, I am sure that he has other things in store for me, so its all good...

I just realized that there is only two weeks of actual classes left, WOOHOO!!!!!!!!  That is exciting.  The only downside to that is that means finals are soon approaching...now that sux!!  This semester I actually have to really really study hard for finals.  In the past I could get away with doing it half-ass, but not this semester.  Its cause I goofed off way too much this semester and now I am going to pay for it!!  Oh well, I'll live with it and study my ass off.

I got three rolls of film developed this weekend, which some pics were from christmas. I know, I am soo on top of things, huh?  Anyways...there were pics in there from spring break and New Orleans and the NSync concert.  I was looking thru them and I was thinking how I made such a big deal a couple of months ago because I didn't have picture of Linden.  In one of the rolls, oh look, I have a pic of Linden..a little late now!!!  I just thought it was funny.  There was also the pic of Deb and Ronnie with his fireman hat on...now that is such a cute pic!!!  Really, it looks good.  Don't worry Deb I got doubles!!!!  Now, what sucked is that my roll that I took at the NSync concert with the camera Deb got me, none of those pics came out...not a single one!!!  It pisses me off, but oh well.  I still haven't developed the roll with the pics from when they got off the tour buses, so I am hoping that those come out since I took them with my camera.  I guess its not a big deal tho since all the memories I need are in my head.  

So yeah, that's my life at the moment.  I got lots of work to do today, so I better get started.  I have kiddie lit tonight, which sux, but such is life.  Hopefully I can work on the story this week.  Sorry to Em and Deb for not getting  chapter 3 out last week, but yall know how stressful school can be sometimes.  I am going to make an effort to try and keep up with it more, but please cut me some slack, especially at this time of year.  

Later yall!!!"

"event","I know the title sounds stupid, but I wanted something to rhyme with 'class' and 'ass' is the first thing that came to my mind and since Adam REALLY is an ass, I thought it appropriate...no, I haven't spoken to him, much less even thought about him since last weekend, but I needed someone who really was an ass....so there's the explanation!!!

SO yesterday it was sooo pretty outside.  Sunny and hot, just the way I like it!!!  It was so nice that I even went and laid out yesterday and got a little color..gotta love the weater in Austin!!  Excpet that today its so cloudy and not so pretty.  Its humid and a nice temperature, but not as pretty as yesterday. 

Did you ever notice that when its cloudy and dreary outside all you want to do is sit at home and be lazy?  Or is it only me??  All i know is that I need to be doing something productive, but I just can't bring myself to do anything.  I did, however, go put gas in my car, which I guess is productive...who knows!!  Maybe its not the weather...maybe its just the fact that I am almost done for the week, so I want to get my weekend started already??????  Nah, its just the weather! LOL

I went to my advisor today and got my schedule all worked out and stuff.  I am on track to graduate in May of 2004, which on the surface seems far away, but in all actuality its not far at all!!!!!!  In 2 years I, Holli Ann, will be a certified teacher.  I will be in control of 30 children from 8 am to 3 pm...I am responsible for their education and social development...me???  I know that I am cut out to do it and its what I really want to do, I just didn't think it would be here so soon, ya know?  I thought college was supposed to take forever, kind of like high school.  But to me, college is going by way faster than HS did...scary!!!!  In two years, I will start my career....does that sound totally weird to any of my other college friends??  We will be starting our careers, jobs that we will work at for the rest of our lives!!!!!!!  

Needless to say, I am somewhat apprehensive about becoming a full fledged adult contributor to society.  I mean when I was 8 and thinking about ""what I want to be when I grow up"" I never thought it would be here so soon.  I thought that college would take a long, long, long time to get to and then once I was there, it would take even longer to get out.  Just goes to show you how naive we all are at 8.

Anyways... I talked to my momma this morning and we talked about our Arizona trip.  I am sooo pumped about it!!  My cousin Mike is graduating in may, so we are all (and when I say all, I mean ALL of my family) going to AZ to watch him graduate.  His graduation is outside at 7...an outside graduation in Arizona in the summer...does that seem illogical to anyone else??  Its gonna be over a 100 degrees!!!!  BUt its all good...my mom decided that we are going to go see the grand canyon when we are there, which is gonna be a lot of fun.  Plus, having all my family on the same flight, staying in the same hotel is bound to be amusing at some point.  I get to see my aunt Kelly, who is the bomb!  she's so fun and spunky.  I also get to see my cousin Megan who I haven't seen in many years!!  She's in hs now, which is soo scary.  I hear that she's gorgeous too, which isn't surprising since she always was pretty...so yeah, I can't wait.  And really, it will prolly be here before I know it...

There really is a lot of day left and I am tryign to decided how to best use my time.  I have to do laundry in order to have clothes to wear this weekend.  I really should read the book that I have to extra credit on for kiddie lit.  I also should do some history homework.  But the thing I must get accomplished tonight is my tv shows.  Thursday is my one night when I am literally watchign tv from 7 to 9:30.  All my good shows come on, so I gots to be done with the work by then or it ain't gettin done!!!

I guess I should prolly go get some stuff done then.  It will prolly take me 7 hours to get it done, which is sad, but such is college life!!!"

"event","Part One of spanish test is complete...woohoo!!!  Now I just have to study 3 chapters of vocab for part 2 tomorrow. I was so worried about part 1, but I sooo did awesome. Its amazing how studying till after 3am will cause you to get a good grade!!

Yeah, so I'm not going to ALD today, but I sooo need a nap, so I said screw it.  I'll go into my professors office hours on thursday and talk to her about and get brownie points.  No biggie!

Last night I went to a meeting for the vocal group I want to join and now I am way excited.  I tried out my freshman year, but I didn't make it.  I was upset, but seeing as how I had strep throat at the audition, I wasn't too surprised.  So, I am ready to audition this year and kick some booty!!  I have to pick a song to try out with and its not going very well.  I have 3 prospects, but I can't decide.  Whatever I sing has to not only show off my range, but my enthusiasm, and stage presence.  Its times like these I wish I had Marsha or Ms Scatt to help me out!!!

Auditions are sunday at 3:30 so I only have a couple days to really learn my song...but first I have to decide which one!!!

Well, I got less than 4 hours of sleep, so its definitely time to take a little nap, eventho I don't usually take naps.  But desperate times call for desperate measure!!!!"

"event","Nothing really interesting happened today that is worth writing about, but while I was reading today I came across a line that got me to thinking, so I decided to post it in my journal.  Now maybe my entries won't seem as frivolous (that comment is made to be funny...anyone who read my comments to Em's journal will understand)....Anyways here's the quote:

A person doesn't need to be beautiful, they just need to be loved.

After reading this line in the book, I just sat for a while and thought about it.  Today has been a very contemplative one I would like to say.  I have been thinking so much about things other than Spanish, like I should be, seeing as how I have a test tomorrow!!

Anyways...so back to the quote.  It made me think how much I worry about trying to be beautiful and having other people think I'm beautiful, when that isn't what's important.  So many hours I wasted trying to fit into this societal concept of what is ""beautiful"".  I feel like I wasted so much time doing that, and what did it get me? Nothing.  When Andy or BJ tell me I look sexy or beautiful does it really make me happy??  For a moment, yes, but that moment is fleeting...its just a random utterance that doesn't change who I am or make me feel truly better about who I am..  It means so much more to me when one of them says that they love me and that I'm a good person, etc. than when they tell me I look good!!!!

Being loved makes one beautiful.  Beauty of the soul and the heart is so much more important and worth striving for than outer beauty.  Outer beauty can fade away and deteriorate, but the inner beauty will always last!!  I feel so much happier on the inside and the outside when someone says ""I love you"" or ""You rock"".  Oh so much more so than when someone says ""you look so pretty"".  

I feel really good about myself all around when I'm loved by my friends and family and that is the best feeling in the whole world.  Better than being naturally or artificially beautiful.  Do you think 20 years from now I want people to remember me as ""man that girl was fizine!!!"" or ""you know, I loved hanging out with her..she was a nice person and fun to be around""???  Think about this logically....

Alright, so I have said my peace and will descend from my soap box now.  I just felt that after all the guy issues that I've had, as well as my personal issues that it was a good time to divulge my thoughts.  I feel a lot better venting now and getting all those heavy thoughts out of my head.  Now, I can make room for more flippant and lighter thoughts...start enjoying things around me and stop trying to make myself fit some stupid mold about how its so important to be ""beautiful"".  I have people who love me and that makes me feel DAMN good!!!!!"

"event","Yay!  I survived another monday!  It feels good to have another monday under my belt since there aren't many more mondays left until the end of the semester!  

I took my british lit test this morning, which really sucked!  Usually I feel ok about my tests in that class cause I totally rock in it, but not this time.  This test definitely sucked!  Oh well, its over and I have a good grade in there right now and I will just study really hard for the final.  No biggie!!

So my roomate comes in and asks me if I was going to kiddie lit tonight cause one of her friends wants to meet me.  I was definitely a little surprised.  It was quite random.  I told her no I wasn't going, which I wasn't, even before she came and talked to me.  His name is Bryant and I don't know a lot about him, but its fun when someone wants to meet you.  I am way pumped about meeting him and hanging out.  At this point, I need to meet guys who don't completely suck ass, even guys to just chill with.  He's going to come over here and we might go hang out somewhere or go eat or something like that.  

I am so proud of myself!  I have actually already read two of the books for kiddie lit and my test isn't for another 3 weeks.  I am soo on a roll.  I'm trying to get all that crap done with because in british lit we are about to start Jane Eyre and I know that's going to take up a lot of my time, so I need to get the kiddie lit stuff over with.

I had subway today and that made me happy!  I didn't feel like actually making food cause I went to bed at like 2 last night and woke up at 7:30 this morning, so I was feeling lazy when it came to food today.  But subway is yummy and I love it.

I don't have any homework that is actually due tomorrow, so I am just goofing off this afternoon. THink I am gonna paint my toes and be girlie, read some fun stuff, and just celebrate the fact that I am done with british lit tests until the end of the semester!!  

Gotta go pamper myself now!"

"event","Its the weekend finally!!!!  As much as I complain during the week about how I long for the weekends, you'd think I'd be more exicted when it gets here.

But alas, there is not excitement here.  Its the weekend, and what do I have planned?  Oh, nothing.  Just some homework and watching tv.  Thrilling I know, try not to be jealous.  I guess the reason I get bummed on the weekends is that its totally free, no schedules to keep.  I am one of those people that like to keep busy.  So during the week, I am always on the go and always have shit to do.  On the weekends, however, there is no schedule to keep.  I am totally free to do whatever.  There is not motivation to acutally do work when I don't have to wake up and go to class the next morning.  

Its pretty sad when you complain about having free time!  I must have hit some low.  Oh well...Like, I sooo have a HUGE british lit test on monday that is seriously going to kick my ass. That should be motivation to be studying right now instead of working on my journal.  As you can tell, though, its not working.  

So I was bored last night and really didn't have a lot of money to go out and have some fun, so I went and rented some movies from blockbuster.  I rented Ghost World, O, and Soul Survivors.  I watched Ghost World last night and had some popcorn.  As much as I say that I am soo over Linden, I guess last night I started to think about it again and it made me a tad anti-social.  Last night was definitely one of those 'hi, i want to sit alone, watch a movie, eat buttery popcorn, and wallow in my own self-pity because some guy treated me like shit' nights.  Ever get one of those?  Yeah, it kind of sucked, but sometimes I guess its good to just sit and reflect about things.  

No, I am not going into some depressive funk if that's what you're thinking.  Its just that sometimes all your emotions hit you at one time and its just like, WHOA!  I guess that is kind of my situation right now.  But thankfully, my goals with school and having last night to reflect are helping me overcome that.

I am seriously trying to be a good student and make up for all the time this past semester that I fucked up.  This is that point where all those times I stayed the night at Andy and Linden's on a sunday night, missed classes cause I didn't feel like it, and just plain laziness catch up with me and I hate myself for being such a slacker.  And I tell myself, no more, from now on its being a good student and not goofing up.  Will I keep this attitude?  Probably not, but at least I try and make an effort right?  Anyways, I would really like for this to be a spring semester where I can make Dean's List, instead of keeping up with as I like to call it 'the spring semester curse'.  Prolly won't happen, but oh well.....

Man, can I ramble on and on and float from topic to topic.  I got mahd skills in that department.  SO I am watching 'O' right now and its definitely different.  I thought that I would like it more than I am, but I'm not.  Maybe I just need to read the actual play by Shakespeare to fully enjoy the Othello experience.  And Josh Hartnett's character in this movie really bothers me.  Possibly it could be because he's like pure evil, but who knows.  Julia Stiles rocks in this movie, but she's one of my favorite actresses, so I guess that's why.  The whole movie kind of bothers me.  Oh well, I didn't really pay for it cause  if you rented 2 movies at blockbuster you got a third for like 25cents, so it was my third choice.

I decided that since I have pretty much goofed off this afternoon so far, I am going to do all my work tonight.  And I will get it done.  Tomorrow night I get to meet with my group at starbucks to work on our project.  I'm excited cause I get to go starbucks and I have been craving it.  There isn't one anywhere even remotely close to my apartment, so it sucks when I get a craving for it. That's what I like about being home, the fact that there is a starbucks close..well, that and other reasons.

Ok, so O is over with now and hmmm.....that's all I can really say about it.  I mean, it was ok, don't get me wrong and I usually like dark movies like that, but this one just bothered me.  It definitely put the point across that jealousy is a horrible emotion...Being jealous just sux and makes you crazy!!!  Guess that is one thing you can take from that film.

I think that i have successfully rambled for long enough and been unproductive for enough time now. I should prolly go get some kind of work done, even if it is a very small snippet of the massive amount I have to do."

"event","So, I just finished reading ""The Giver"" for my kiddie lit class.  Yes, I realize I read ahead of time, aren't you proud?  Anyways...so yeah, the book was soooo good!!  It was one of those books that really makes you think.  I love books like that!!  I mean seriously, wow!  I don't really see how it is much of a children's book per se since I think it requires a lot more cognitively demanding thinking, but oh well.  So, in conclusion, the book is making me think and I highly recommend it any one who hasn't read it...even adults.

Now, on the aggrivation. Today I decided to go out and buy the new software for my cd burner since it wasn't compatible with XP.  I've been really missing being able to make a cd on a whim...anyways, so I buy it and it was in no way cheap at all.  I really didn't have the money to buy it, but I really miss burning music.  I get it home and install it.  Then I have to go to some websit and download something else cause XP and the software company butt heads...After rebooting my computer 4 times, I started to make a cd.  And guess what?  It didn't work!!!!!!!!!  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I went to the website to get some help and ofcourse got none.  The instruction manual was also no help whatsoever..So it just left me very aggrivated and frustrated and wanting to kill Bill Gates and all his stupid computer freaks for inventing XP.  I was happy with my antiquated Windows 98, really I was.  I can honestly say that XP has made my life a living hell.  Thanks Bill!!!!

So earlier this morning I talked to my mom cause I talk to her almost everyday, but anyways..she said that when i come back home the next time we have to have a family meeting.  Naturally, I couldn't leave it at that, so I asked why.  Apparently, when my mom took the new position at her job, it was for a lot less money. A lot, lot less.  But despite that, we've been getting by just fine.  However, in august my sister turns 18 and my dad told us that he will no longer be paying child support.  It wasn't a big shock since he did the same when I turned 18, but still.  That means that mom won't be getting that extra $600 a month that she is used to and that is a problem.  Its going to effect our living situation.  We are either going to have to move in with my grandfather or my grandmother so that my mom won't go in debt cause she is already pretty much there because of Heather and I in school.  

I love our house in Irving and being close to everything, but I do live in Austin now, so its whatever.  But I can't help but feel a little guilty.  I mean, if I hadn't wanted to go to UT, which is not exactly a cheap school, and gone to UTA instead, I could be living at home, saving some money and contributing money as rent, then there wouldn't be a problem.  Maybe me staying back home would have eased the financial burdens that my mom has. Its not fair for her to carry so much on her shoulders after she has already given up so much for Heather and I.  I can't help but feel guilty.  She was saying somethign about getting a part time job and everything, which isn't fair to her.  That would mean that after working an 8hr day, she would go straight to another job instead of going home and relaxing.  That is not fair to her, especially since in the fall she was going to try and go back to school.  She shouldn't have to push her dreams of getting a better degree aside.  To make matters worse, Heather complained that she didn't want to move and all that jazz and we know why-Joe. How selfish can you be?  THis is the girl who gets to stay at home rent free, no job, going to Hawaii this summer, getting school paid for.  Geez...

So yeah, today has been interesting to say the least.  I also found out that unless I want to spend an extra year at school I won't be getting bilingually certified.  Which I guess isn't a big deal, but it is cause that is what I wanted to do.  It looks like I will just get my plain old degree, then in a couple years go back to school and get bilingually certified and then get my masters.  Not exactly how I wanted to do things, but I guess I gotta go with the flow.

But on the bright side, I don't have a british lit test tomorrow like I was supposed to.  It got moved back til monday, which is greatness since I am having trouble with all that stupid scansion crap anyways.  I get to go to my profs office hours tomorrow and get some extra help, which I am somewhat looking forward to.  This is my fave prof and I can't wait to get to talk to her on an individual basis.  I guess I am just a nerd like that!

And I am happy that Debra and I have recovered almost entirely from our unpleasant experiences with the Arlington boys.  Its funny how you can think so highly of someone for a little while, but then realize that they aren't what you expected or what you wanted.  That happened to us with Ronnie and Linden.  I am just glad that it happend sooner, rather than later.  Its all good tho cause being single definitely has its advantages!!!

I started writing again last night and felt totally happy.  When I am writing fiction, it just makes me happy.  I enjoy every aspect of the process.  I just wish I had as much talent as Lyn or Em...I am so jealous of how they write!!  And Deb is working on a story too, so I am way excited to read hers when she finishes the first chapter.  She is also an awesome writer!  I'm jealous of her too...I mean her story ""Reach"" kicked some serious ass!!!!!!!

This has become a kind of long entry, so I guess I should wrap it up.  A lot happened today.  I have spanish homework to do, some history, and I need to try and finish up chapter 2 of my story(which I regret to say is untitled..ugh!).  Homework, lots of tv, and I've already had a lot of caffine...whew! Its gonna be an exciting night!!!!!!!"

"event","As I sat today waiting for my ALD 325 class to start I suddenly had a rush of ideas for fan fiction.  And from this sudden outpour of ideas, I have decided to start writing again.  This will be great news to Em and Deb since they are the main readers, but still.

It seems that its a lot easier for me to write a fan fiction story when I don't like somebody.  I honestly don't know why that is, but its true.  I guess cause when you have an interest in someone and you are writing it can become cheesy real fast.  Now that I have NO interest in any guys whatsoever, I can start back up.

I am so exicted to start writing again because it makes me happy!  I know that I am no where near Lyn's quality, but I think I am decent.  I've read a lot of fiction to know that I have more talent than some writers out there.  Plus, *NSync makes me happy, eventho I am not nearly as obsessed as I once was.  But still, they are a good group to write about and I like it, so there...

I am hoping that maybe *crosses fingers* I saved the Em and Justin story on a disk so that I don't have to start all over.  Plus, I really like that first chapter I wrote and I don't think that I could write another one as good.  I also have a plethera of story ideas for a JC and me story, but I am so going to work on the Em and Justin one first since I way owe Em a story.

So despite the eventful and emotionally difficult weekend I had, I am slowly, but surely getting back into normal Holli mode.  Its amazing how one weekend can send you in a hundred directions, only to put you back on the right path once again.  So I guess that in a way I should thank Linden for being an ass...eh, maybe not!!!!!

Today after I cleaned my room, I put the pic of Deb and I into my nifty friends frame and it looks way awesome.  I honestly don't know what I would do without Deb.  She rocks my world!!!  And we look way cute in that pic, so its all good.

Fall course schedules came out today and its just becoming another stress in college life.  I hate how planning what classes you are going to take is such an ordeal.  I mean honestly, we go thru enough stress all semster, so shouldn't this be the easy part?  Yes, but it isn't.  Oh well....

I have a british lit test on friday and I am soo not looking forward to it.  Its over romantic poetry, which doesn't sound hard, but it is.  All of our other tests have had multiple novels and stuff, so they haven't been too challenging.  But poetry and having to write essays over short poems does not thrill me in the least bit.  Such is life I guess.  Plus, I have like a high A in this class and I really want to keep it that way...i know that's selfish of me, but hey, that's college.

Wow!  Its 4 oclock and I have successfully accomplished nothing academic in nature.  I really wish I could be more motivated to do work, but I'm just not!  I think that in the spring semester it just gets to a point when you have this whole ""screw school"" attitude...I definitely have that!

So I guess that I should go get some work done now so that I can watch my tv shows tonight and not feel guilty in the least!  Not that I would anyways, but that's not the point..."

I don't feel that I need to fully explain myself in this manner, because most of you who read this already know the story anyways....

So this weekend had it ups and downs.  I'm glad that I got to see my family and I'm glad that I got to have some quality time with Deb!  I am also very glad that I got to hang out with Nathan and his roomate Jake.  That was soo much fun with them on saturday...

SO today I had my children's lit test and it went ok...not the best I have ever done, but seeing as how I only studied today before it, I deserve whatever score I get.  Honestly, I am soo sick of school right now that I don't care about most of my classes.

I am soo tired right now, but can I go to bed? No!  Why? Cause i have countless hours of hw to do tonite that I naturally did not get done this weekend like I should have.  I don't know why I bother taking my hw with me when I go home cause I never do it! But, seeing as how I really don't think that I am going to be hanging out with Andy and his evil roomate anymore, I may actually have time to do hw!!

so here they are:

1.  Go to history class everyday for the rest of the semester.

2.  Go to ALD 325 every class day and go to professors office hours once every two weeks.

3.  Keep up with my reading for british lit

4.  Read novels for children's lit ahead of time...don't wait till week before test to read all 5!

5.  Stop worrying about boys and stupid things of that nature.  Live for me and do what I want and not worry about how it will effect certain boys!!

That's all the goals for now!"

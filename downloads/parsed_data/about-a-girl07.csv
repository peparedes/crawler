"event","so i'm listenin to chevelle.. damn it haven't listened to this CD in so long. i love it. 

my uncle's leaving monday, that's so fucking sad. i don't know. it's gonna be so hard on melissa, idk what she's gonna do with 3 kids. at least spring break is coming up. when i came home after school yesterday to get ready for work him and the kids were here. i told him i was gonna capture him and hold him hostage so he couldn't leave. he laughed =[ he's coming back for easter, but still. he's just gonna leave again after that. damn, i'm about to cry now. i'm gonna go up there around my birthday and see him i decided. hmm i'm just gonna stop bitching about this. 

so yesterday, nothing really happened. went to school went to work came home. ooommmg! ok so, my mom and john were in chicago so my aunt was supposed to pick me up from work, so she was supposed to be there at like 7 30 and iwaited til like 7 45 and she still wasn't there so i went upstairs and called my mom and told her that she wasn't so while i was waiting for my mom to call back frank (the owner) came and he looked at me like all shocked and he's like are you waitin for a ride? and i was like well my aunt's supposedto pick me up but she's not here yet. and he's like where do you live? and i was like off of prospect and he was like i'm goin up to the heights, i'll drop you off. so he gave me a ride. then when i got home my aunt still wasn't here. and i was alll worried n stuff. but i guess she waited and then i didn't come so she came home and saw that the lights were out so they went back and waited more and then finally came back home and i was there. theeeeenn the phone didn't work. omg i was sooo scared cause i was all home alone n like the phone didn't work n stuff. so then we went to my uncle's house to call my mom and tell her that jill was home and ok. so we chilled there for a bit. then dustin picked me up and we went to mi casa. and then my mom fixed the phone when she got home. and that was my night. 

today sucks. i'm sitting around dressed, hair done with nothing to do. it's so sad. i wish my mom would get home so she could take me somewhere. ahhhh! i'm gonna go like jump on the couch or something.

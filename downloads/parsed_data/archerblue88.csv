he was a cutie

I've got to stop looking at these guys- there's enough of them who want to beat the crap out of me already- if I wasn't in the advanced Taekwondo program them they probably would have tried.

They're all threatened by me. So sad.

I think they have this idea in their head that because i'm gay, I want to have sex with them all.

But then the few who actually know me, get to know who I actually think is hot, and realise that I'm so damn picky I'll probably never get laid.

oh well, i guess it's just easier for straight guys. All they have to do is put their hand up some chick's top and they're right.

I have to risk getting my face bashed in by asking 'are you into guys or girls' before i can make a move.

oh the complicated life of me. 

Nothing worse than being a mathematical genius who's got a rainbow sticker on his Vespa.

you really learn a lot about people when you get onto their online journal.

winter's really a talented writer.

and i'm so not looking forward to the games anymore.

there's just going to be so many people in melbourne, we won't be able to find each other, let alone get to the venues.

We've already bought our tickets, though. We're going to a morning athletics session at the MCG on the 18th, because I hda to come up with the crazy idea that it would be something we could tell our grandkids about, like my grandpa tells me about how when he was 18 he went down to the Olympics and watched the swimming heats. He's still got the ticket from that, framed up on his wall. He recently got me to value it on eBay and I was scared to tell him that the little bit of paper with 'MELBOURNE OLYMPIC GAMES 1956' stamped on it was worth more than his Jason recliner.

Oh well.

Anyway I'm going to join some of Winter's communities- that bam_ryan_otp sounds good. 

Hey- I might be a guy but I'm also, according to Winter's mum, 'as camp as a row of tents'. I do enjoy reading the odd bit of 'slash' as you girls call it.

So I'm going to join up, let me know if any of you get offended by a boy being a member.

"event","So Winter and Ryan got me onto this- even though Ryan has stopped updating and practically, well, literally deleted his account. 

But I'm going to school this year and I'm 300 kms away from Winter and everyone

and this is cheaper than txt messages.

so yeah
I'll be updating what life's like here at the Gram.

See you all when the Games are on

Don't forget that we're meeting at T-Bar, not Riverside, Winter.

see you on the 18th.

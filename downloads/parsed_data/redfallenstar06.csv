"event","Hey guys! It's been awhile but a lot has happened. I am offically and aunt as of 2:08 pm on Monday, June 20, 2005. I am soooooo excited. Her name is Isabella Rose Zimmerman. She is the most ADORABLE baby ever. She is perfect!! I went to the ranch for two weeks, helping my grandparents and stuff like that. built a fence, not quite finished so I'm going back and taking Stephen with me to work! Hahahah. Anyways. I'm having a wonderful time down here. But although I do kind of hate to say it, but I can't wait until school. I miss all my friends. Oh well. Later."

Then I came home, cleaned, ate dinner, went to Stephen's, he was sick. He was throwing up and I'm just really worried. He has a fever like no other. Ugh, will this day ever be over? This day was just really, icky. I hope tomorrow is a million times better. 


Stephen, I hope you feel better. I love you."

"event","Yes, so I have the SAT on May 7th, anyone else have it? I'll be at Trinity Christian Acadamy in Addison. Help me. I was signed up for the 4th of June, but I had to change it because, stupid me, signed up for the subject test and not the stupid reasoning test. But whatever. It collides with my sister's baby shower, which means I either A) can't go at all or B) show up late ... well. I'm hoping I get to go, but that is also a week before prom. I have a lot to do by then. Prom is only like less that 3 weeks away, and my SAT is in 17 days. Wow. That's really soon. Oh, well. Beka, I will probably borrow that black dress I tried on, if I can't find anything else with Tiffany. TAKS is this week. You know, taht really stupid beyond belief test that I now have to take in order to graduate. Yeah, stupid I know. I think, and I'm hoping that I did good on it. And we all know I'm in love with Stephen, and that I think he is the hottest guy on this Earth. I've been spending almost everyday with him, and I love it. 

Okay, I'm done ranting, but I'm still really pissed off that I had to change the SAT date. Oh well. I'm really kinda hoping that I do really really good on this test because I'm sending it to some colleges, and I'm not sure whether you can take the SAT as a senior or not. So pray that I do good on it! Later."

First off, because I don't know anyone, and second I don't know my way around this city. Well, I lied. I know one person. But I haven't seen this person in two years. I don't think that they would recognize me, so therefore doesn't want to hang out with me. Oh, and thirdly, my family doesn't know this person.

It was to his room upstairs and his dad said i was welcome anytime. now that i have the key, i know where i'm gonna be a lot. once i get my license. but yeah. it's a very nice room i like it. its big. big enough for two or three people. 
today was Kaitlin's 12th birthday. wasn't very exciting. i leave for austin again on friday afternoon sometime. i hope i get to see stephen. i better. i'm already missing one of the biggest moments in my life. Mr. Summers is gonna ask Paula to marry him, and yeah, guess what, i cant go.
For Kaitlin's birthday, my mom took us to the rockwall where Stephen was working, and he let them climb for free. I sorta met his boss Jeremy, nice guy, not properly introduced, but he told me that they are making me get on the wall the next time i go there. that's awesome. Hiroshi seems nice. i like his co-workers, or whatever you call them. but yes, i liked today. it was a good day, except for the part where i didnt get to see Stephen for my normal time frame. :-( i only got 30 minutes. but i'm off to bed, later kids."

Secondly, today, Stephen was gonna give me or show me or something a surprise, but it turns out, it was ruined because my mom has to take freakin' forever and my dad is making excuses. So we decided to have it tomorrow. Well, it turns out that we might be going to Austin for the weekend, and dropping Kaitlin off in Three Rivers, meeting my grandparents there. So that means, we can't do it tomorrow. Monday he starts school again. This sucks. Thirdly, I was asked to dinner by a guy in my IPC class, in which I agreed, because why can't friends have dinner? I really hope he doesn't think anything of it. And to top off my day, my mom is pissed off at my sister and I broke the DVD player in the bigscreen room. My life is now shit."

Awesomeness. I love it. Got into a fight with my parents, over the silliest things. 1st was with mom. It was Friday night, and it was because I stayed home. Sunday was with my dad. That one was over breakfast, I didn't make it fast enough, so my dad takes it away from me and tries to do it himself and cuts his finger, pretty good, and blames it on me. So today I tried to be good, but I guess that wasn't enough, so I cleaned the kitchen. Apparently that wasn't good enough either. So I don't know what to do. Oh well. Oh, and I saw Linzie for the first time in FOREVER! OMG! She looks good for being out for only 3 weeks. I can't wait to hang out with her."

"event","So I go to school today, and I'm already nervous about things, when Stephen Villarreal says to the Tech class that me and Meriam are hypocondriacts. Well he didn't say our names, but we are the only ones to have pains in the class. I thought that Tech was suppose to be the class I could share this stuff with..I guessed wrong. Apparently no one cares about anyone but themselves. Look Stephen, no one wants to hear you rambling on about how Tech isn't was it used to be, that the new techies aren't good enough, and that you don't care. You didn't have to tell any of us. We already know.
But since I'm a hypocondriact, I went to the doctor today and got all my test results back. the MRI, UGI, and Sonogram were all normal. All my blood work was normal. So they took more blood from me, and are looking for instead of Lispaus *Lupus, but I spelled it wrong before* they are testing me for another kind of arthritus and in which only happens when you're older. Oh, and they are testing my blood for Lyme Disease, stomach olser, and like 5 other things that could possibly be wrong. So I go back next week. 
I'm sorry, I'm just not very happy right now with a certain someone. But I'm very happy that I don't have Lispaus.

Then we arrived back to Kristen's at around 12ish. Went to bed and then woke up at 8 the next morning. Kinda sucked, but we went shopping. I got some new shoes and a new shirt. We came home on Sunday around 830. Went to bed, got up early on Monday because I had a doctor's appointment at 8. Ugh. At the doctor's, I was given a sonogram, upper GI, and a MRI. I went back to school at like 1120. The rest of the day was boring. Tuesday, I wore my new shoes, everyone liked them. Hung out with Stephen, and then went to bed. Today, was an okay day. Just like every other one. Hung out with Stephen, and now I'm here. So that's the update. Later."

After that, Angie, Blake and I went to Palio's and had us some dinner *mmm PIZZA* And then we took Angie home and then Blake took me home. We talked about me becoming an aunt and pretty much a mom to my sister's baby. And then he left. 

Then I took a quick body shower, because I smelled from just standing around in the room. And then Stephen came and picked me up and we went to his house. And now I'm here, at my house. But tomorrow is Monday and I have school, and it's DADDY""S BIRTHDAY! Woot!"

"event","So I go back to the doctor on Thursday. My appointment was at 10:20, I saw the doctor at 11:30. They took an EKG on me, which was normal, took blood, and took xrays. The doctor examined me really good, because my mom was pissed that they didn't the last time. He said everything with my heart was okay, but just to be sure, he sent me to a cardiologist. My appointment was at 2:30 that day, in Dallas. Her male nurse took another EKG on me just to be sure nothing has changed. So, he didn't give me a gown to wear, he just asked me to pull up my shirt. A lil uncomfortable. But he said that is was the same as the first one, normal. The cardiologist came in and examined me, she said it wasn't my heart, she thinks they are muscle spazims. But my doctor is checking my blood for calcium levels, and a thyroid check, and one other one that I can't remember. My blood work comes in next week. I'll let you know.

On another subject, last night was the TechieNightOut. Which I heard was annoying. I didn't go because I had already made plans to babysit. I kinda wish I could've gone. Blake is having one tonight, and I will try to make it, at least make an appearance. I'm spending the day with my best friend Anna and her mom, because they are moving to Canada on Friday. That's an awesome thing. No not really. I understand why and everything, but it's not fair. 

I came home at about 11 last night. And the whole way home, I had the WORST pain I've EVER had in my life. Right in the middle of my chest. I tried to help it go away, but nothing would work. I couldn't move. I was crying it hurt so bad. And I can take pain. I felt like i was dying, I almost told my mom to take me to the hospital to make sure I was having a heart attack or anything. Of course I wasn't, because I'm fine. I'm not dead, yet. It sure as hell felt like it. 

Well I have a couple of hours before I go shopping with Meriam for our shirs for the Battle of the Bands tomorrow. And then I'm off with Anna.

Hopefully they find something because then I don't know what to say about these pains I'm having, except growing pains, but I stopped growing like 2 years ago. So that can't be it.

Bad planning on their part. I can't go. I already have plans to babysit, and clean my room. I think I'd much rather stay at home with my family than with a bunch of people only pretending to want to be my friend. And the comments I got back on my LJ were absolutely beating around the bush. I told them to tell me whether or not they wanted to get the group back together and blah blah blah, their comments back were, we're not excluding anyone, it's just that we've all moved on. And some of us are still close, we're just not with you. Not the answer I was quite looking for, but I got it. They hate me, and frankly..I don't really care. I'm not going to try to be their friend if they don't want me as one. I will still be nice, but I will not hang out with them. On a worse note, I went to the doctor today, because of all the chest pains and body pains and the horrible cough that makes me cough really gross stuff up, looking for something like the flu or pneumonia or something, they told me I was perfectly fine. And I still have my pains and I still cough gross stuff up. Doctors are stupid and that is why I hate them. That's why I refuse to go to them unless I think I really need one.

Except Beka, she called when Stephen was over because she was bored. I told her I would call her back, and I did. But she didn't answer, so she either fell asleep, or found something to do. I wish I could just confront them and tell them that the way they exclude me out of everything and don't talk to me, hurts. But I know I can't do that. Cory still hasn't replied to my last comment. Taylor hasn't said anything. Beka and Chris are the only ones I've hung out with since this whole crappy thing began. I brealy hang out with Hodo now too. I mean, we still talk and we're still cool, but we haven't hung out for a lil while.  I think it was like a week before Seussical actually. Brandon and I are still weird around each other. That is when I do see him. I've just lost touch with everyone and it sucks. I want my life back. And I know it sounds selfish, and it kinda is but seriously, who wouldn't want to be happy? But I guess if they're happy without me, then I guess I will try to be happy too. And I always get the feeling, that they don't care. They don't want me to be friends with them, I just wish they would tell me instead of making me guess. And I don't want them to say ""Oh yeah, we want you to be our friend. We've missed you."" When they don't really mean it. Because when you find out that they really don't, it hurts even more. So I'm begging you guys, tell me the truth."

"event","Going back to Seussical, I know I put it in myspace, but not in here and I'm sorry. Seussical was amazing. It was a fun show to do and I'm kind of sad it's over. I know that Brandon was there *wow, a name that hasn't appeared in here in forever* he ""helped"" us with our side *SR* and I agree, we probably wouldn't have gotten everything on on time, but we wouldn't have been lost. Not once did we have to look at our scripts. Tiffany and I did a great job getting our stuff where it needed to be. And so did Brandon. But Brandon had a WHOLE different thing he was doing. Yes, we needed his help getting some set done, but not getting things on and off. Brandon had nothing to do with it. It was totally me and Tiffany, doing OUR job. I did get quite sick during the month of January. I lost about 7ish pounds. Throwing up and not eating wise. I had an upper respitaory infection, and now I think I'm sick again. But oh well. We've circled up in Tech the past two days, which we haven't done in a while. Kinda cool to know what everyone else is going through. And I agree with some people in the class. We have clicks, and as many people know, not everyone likes everyone in Tech. I know people in there don't like me and they say they do, they just don't think I like them..it's childish to say something like that. If you don't like me, please, by all means, tell me to my face (and that's not online). I think I deserve to know that you don't see eye to eye with me, or you don't think that I like you, ask me. I'll tell you. And I won't lie. If you ask me what I think of you, I will tell you. I know that might sound harsh, but I will tell you whether I like or not, or whether or not I think you like me. I feel like I've lost all my old friends. That's how I feel. You all don't talk to me anymore, when I try to talk to you, you walk off, or don't answer me (when online). It hurts. It's crap like that, that makes me want to either quit Tech, or just plain out kill myself. It makes me feel as if I've done something wrong. I know that I would never kill myself, I'm too chicken to do it, but I know some people know how I feel. At the beginning of this year, I'll admit it, I cut myself over crap that like. And I now I regret it because now I feel selfish because it was all about me. What's wrong with me? Why does everyone act like they hate me? Me, me, me. And I'm tired of it. I want to be friends with my old friends, and my new friends. But for some reason, I lost my old friends. Personally, I think it's because Blake and I broke up. After Blake and I split, everyone stopped talking to me. If that is the reason, tell me so I know. And hopefully, maybe one day, people will understand that we weren't ment to be and get over it. I'm tired of people asking me why we split, and all that other crap. 

And ending on good notes, I hope. Cory and Brandon, I hope you all the best, and I hope you all are together for a long time. Beka, you still rock my face off. Pleser, you are still my favorite ditz :-). Taylor, being a fish doesn't suck that bad does it? Chris, you're still cool and a sweet guy. Benson, you are still an awesome guy. I love all my friends, and I will always cherish the above people, even if we turn out not to be friends. They've changed my life."

"event","I think that super bowl weekend is the shiat. lol. patriots vs. eagles. hmm.. I don't quite know who I want to win. Daddy said he doesn't care. And every other person I've talked to about it is saying the Patriots. While the others say Eagles. Since I've been so busy, I really have to tell you that I haven't watched football since, well, the fall, like early october. So I really don't know. Since patriots won last year, I think I'll go for the eagles. Lol. Well, Daddy asked me to clean thw downstairs for tomorrow, might as well get it out of th way. Stephen is working 12-5 today, and tomorrow. Kinda sucks, he doesn't get to watch to the Super Bowl. And I most likely won't get to see him, unless he decides to come over after work. He might, but i would assume he would be tired. Lol. But gotta go, I'll write more later."

"event","<P>Well, its been a looooooong while since i have updated this, so let me clue you in since Blake and i got together. We went out for 4 months. Great guy, just not the one for me. So I meet <FONT color=#000099>Stephen</FONT>. Wonderful guy, actually the guy I'm with <EM><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>now</FONT></STRONG></EM>..and <FONT color=#cc66cc><EM><STRONG>forever</STRONG></EM></FONT>. This is the greatest guy I know. The only I know that would do all this for me: He stopped smoking, stopped drugs (although he stopped a lot of them before me), and he stopped drinking like he used to, now he doesn't drink at all....long story. Around January 3rdish..we had some problems, went on a break (as I would call it) and now we are back together again. I can't see myself without him. I've <U><EM><FONT color=#666666>tried</FONT></EM></U>. I was with Nick on the ""break"" and things didn't work out. <FONT color=#000099>Stephen</FONT> is the one for me, and I don't care what you think or what you say. <FONT color=#000099>I love him.</FONT> This is not our song, but this is what I listened to everynight when i was without <FONT color=#000099>Stephen</FONT>. </P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>...If I know me... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>-George Strait </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>We both said some things I know we never meant, And when I slammed the door tonight you wondered where I went. If I know you, you're probably wonderin' what to do. You're thinkin' that I'm gone for good, if I know you. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>[Chorus:] But if I know me, I'll turn this car around. I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry. I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too, And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>Sometimes I lose my head, say things to break your heart, Forgettin' if I lost your love, it would tear my world apart. If I know you, you didn't mean one single thing you said. Truth be known, you're dyin', cryin', lyin' there in bed. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>[Chorus] But if I know me, I'll turn this car around. I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry. I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too, And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me. If I know me, and I know me... </FONT></P>
<P>Awesome song, and it is so true, so me..but the song that reminds me of Stephen the most, is our song: </P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>...I Cross My Heart... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>-George Strait </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>Our love is unconditional, we knew it from the start. I see it in your eyes, you can feel it from my heart. From here on after let's stay the way we are right now, And share all the love and laughter that a lifetime will allow. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>[Chorus:] I cross my heart and promise to Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true. In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete, And as long as there's a breath in me, I'll make yours just as sweet. As we look into the future, it's as far as we can see, So let's make each tomorrow be the best that it can be. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>[Chorus] I cross my heart and promise to Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true. In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>And if along the way we find a day it starts to storm, You've got the promise of my love to keep you warm. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine, A love as true as mine.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT color=#000099><STRONG>Stephen, I love you soo much.</STRONG> </FONT></P>"

"event","well yesterday we were supposed to have a movie night at my house but there was a designated johnny concert at the lewisville ampitheater. blake, beka and chris were the only ones that showed up at my house. so we decided to go see designated johnny. although we got bad directions and got lost and almost beat the record of 6 towns by 5 towns. well i had fun. we decided to give up and decided to go back to my house to watch movies..stopped at starbucks first *of course* and then we came back and watched along came polly. and then everyone left.
and then today, beka called me up and said lets go find the ampitheater so i dont feel too stupid and we FINALLY did. we were so proud. and then we went to starbucks again..and met up with some people. trcka, antonio, lainy, and some other people and then she dropped me off here..but still..i had fun."

"event","So. Busy.

I'm working non-stop every evening lately on marketing and presentations and cards and ...  Tired.  Most of the work is free and I don't know for sure whether it'll pan out.

I've been led back to the metaphysical... kicking and screaming. Accounting is a ground and it's allowed me to ignore the Universe for a while. As anyone who's tried ignoring the Universe will tell you, it just sends more obvious signs until you have to be short-bus drooling stupid not to see them.  Or, as in my case, stubborn.

The details will be covered elsewhere as they're too involved for me to write here and at this hour. What matters is that it's all coming back in a big way and it's not just something to study on the side anymore. The business that I'm putting all this effort in has, as a major goal, the idea of uniting principles of energy and energy flow in a work environment.

People balance their energies at home, why not at work? If everything is energy then certainly the business can be represented by energy centers.

I know - it's pretty foo foo and I don't want to go into much detail... I believe in my heart of hearts that it's a good concept, though. The hard part's going to be in making it work. I'm not talking about customers either.  Customers are already interested in this. The world is changing and people are opening up far more than I ever thought would happen. No, I'm talking about the 3 other people I'm partnering with.

One of them doesn't really believe in this energy stuff. Another believes so much that if it were up to her we'd have no marketing and would just sit and meditate till our energy brought clients through the door. And the other one just balks at changing anything she has previously decided.

Imagine me trying to explain why a pretty picture on the cover of our business plan might need a rethink. It's not that I disagree with a picture at all - and this one is quite pretty. It's that I disagree with a functionless image as part of a business plan. That plan is for marketing the business so if you insist on having a fucking picture, either tie it in somehow or find one that's meaningful. Why is this a thing? Why?

I'm also giving a presentation on the business for potential clients and investors this Thursday and we'll be at a networking booth at a new age bookstore next weekend during their Mind, Body, Spirit expo. We have no business cards, no flyers printed, and we're still hammering out the mission and vision statements.  No pressure. Oh yeah, I'm building a website in my spare time as well since we have no money to pay a real web designer.

Actually the website is going well. I did a cool little flash intro page (still need to do a non-flash version), and I have the internal page layout / navigation completed. Right now it's a matter of adding content. The site is by no means great but it's my personal best and that's good enough for being temporary.

Remember when I taught about aura and tarot reading? I always felt wrong about that. I felt wrong about reading for money, too. That's part of why I went away from all this. I've realized through a great deal of introspection that I need to teach grounding. It's possible to have a spiritual existence while remaining firmly grounded in reality. I do it. I believe in all these things but I'm not flitting around with my head in the clouds. These two sides need to be united.

One final note, I've been very ill and staying up all night hasn't helped. Now on 6 weeks of Augmentin. I had borderline pneumonia for a while from bronchitis that won't leave. To my friends with asthma... wow. My lungs weren't closed off that much but I was still freaking out a little. And that albuterol inhaler shit is AWESOME.

Oh, and PS: Dick Clark needs to retire. Holy shit, dude. It's not cute or nostalgic to have him on TV at this point - it's fucking disturbing. When we were watching him I felt GUILTY. How am I supposed to enjoy ringing in the new year when I'm feeling sorry for this guy, relief that at least I'm not that bad, and then guilt over thinking such a thing?"

"event","Coding for the iPhone is drudgery.  I thought it might be fun but I was wrong.  VB was fun and I made a very powerful job costing system with it but whatever was there is gone here.  I'm writing now to try and figure out what's missing.

Obj-C can do more but is so boring to work with that I just can't keep my head in the code.  When I'm really in the zone with something - code especially - ideas flow like water.  I put on some trance music and just go.  Things start coming together.  Today marks the nth time I've tried and it's just not happening.  No matter what I try (see: coffee, booze, food, various music, and all possible combinations thereof) it's like pulling teeth to write ONE LINE OF CODE.  I've yet to try drugs.  Note to self: procure vicodin, valium, xanax, and weed.

I realize that part of it is the difficulty involved.  Obj-C blows goats as far as its friendliness to a novice.  One reason VB was easy is that it was very intuitive.  Like C, this is a language that only its mother could love.  Not knocking the language's ability, mainly just its implementation...  And, yes, that was a reference to the structure of C code.

The problem isn't that it's object oriented so much as that it's stupid.  It really is.  Here's a view controller and a delegate and a this and a that and a these and a those.  Just give me a fucking button so I can tell it what to do, okay?

Here's an example of what happens.  Let's say I want to put a button on the screen and I want to be able to press that button and change its color.  First I have to create an object class for the button that tells what happens when I push the button.  Then I have to put the button on a view in IB (or create it through code but don't even start me on that).  Then I have to get the fracking phone to load the view so the button displays.  Now tell the button graphic that it's actually a member of the button class so it knows what to do.  Now I think somewhere I might need an app delegate but, frankly, at this point I'm so sick and tired of looking at the code for a SINGLE BUTTON that I'm ready to quit.

Granted I've gotten much further than this.  I have sliding modal views that change as a result of the selections and buttons pressed and I have a very good start on the database component but I'm just SO SICK of dealing with the shitty tutorials and helpless help files and I don't want to spend an entire day working to find a solution to get the fucking page to slide to the right instead of up or down or JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I'M SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING LANGUAGE.

Technically it's not MY mac.  I'm borrowing it from the office but I may end up buying it because I REALLY like it.  We'll see how things go.  There's still a lot that I can't do on a mac and for those things I must have a PC but, at the moment, I'm in the process of migrating my Vista system to the Mac via Parallels so I can still run my productivity apps.

This could be a whole new era.

It could also suck royal balls - causing me to use two systems until QuickBooks starts supporting MacOS better or until M$ learns to play nice (read: never).

But two systems is evil.  Parallels is basically just like accessing my PC remotely.  So it's still like two systems but there's no KVM switch to contend with and I don't have to have 3 monitors on my desk.  Not that I dislike the idea of 3 monitors but I think it's a bit overkill when I don't have room for that.  I have room for 2 so that's now many I need."

"event","so, after driving through a forest of prop 102 signs in mesa today I was pretty pissed off by the time I got to the office.  I asked random people in my office what the Christians are so scared of.  What power do shawn and I have that terrifies them so much that they have to circumvent the law to hold it at bay?  My boss' answer?  Without hesitation, mind you, ""you're happy.""

Okay.  I know she was being facetious but I think she hit the nail right on the head.  Religion doesn't like happy people.  They're too hard to control because you have nothing to offer them.  Letting gays get married would let people see just how happy two individuals who stay together out of love rather than biblical retribution can be.  

*sigh*

I know 102 will pass.  Especially here in this silly-ass redneck state. That doesn't make it any easier.  What bothers me most isn't even the fact that they hate gays.  It's that they want to pollute the state constitution with religion.  Marriage is a word that belongs in churches...  Not on the lawbooks or in any constitution.  Have your word.  Have your meaning.  Just keep your silly tribal rituals to yourself."

Just parts of those simpler times.  I spent a lot of lonely nights back then... but the future was so bright.  When the world was confusing and scary, I went out and fucked my problems away.  I didn't have to worry about the bills of two people.  It was just me - just my credit - just my life.

This is impossible, though.  The actual programming is so infuriating that it's no wonder there are a ton of half-assed programs out there.  Granted, there are some really good ones but they are far outweighed by the ones that spend as much time crashing as they do running.

Why are the programs so shitty?  It's Apple... Shouldn't everything work beautifully?  Shouldn't fucking mermaids and butterflies appear as soon as you open the program?  Shouldn't you get a free Steve Jobs with every download?

Despite the wonderful things they have to say about themselves, Apple is just as fucked up as the rest of the computer world.  They're so enamored with themselves that, until just a few days ago, there was a NDA so strict that people couldn't even TALK about their code together.

As a result, nobody knows how to use the framework.  It's all just guesswork and it's individual guesswork because only a few brave souls have discussed it openly and risked the giant Apple falling on their heads.  Apple's own sad attempt at documentation says things like, ""OMG, you can totally do this with this thing and your life will be complete and there will be world peace and God will reveal itself to you.""

"event","I've been thinking about economics again.  I see about 6 possibilities for the future but here are the most dramatic ones.

1. Asian countries stepped into the limelight as China, Japan, and Korea became the dominant world superpowers.  Once America's debts climbed into the hundreds of trillions, the country basically had a fire sale and pieces of land were sold off in lieu of debt repayment.  American ""democracy"" becomes a chapter of world history textbooks - written in Chinese.

2. The American people dug deep into their roots and revolted against a failed system of government.  Many, many people died before order was restored by a leader who promised to take the people into a new era.  Society was built back up using the basic ideals upon which the country was originally founded.  Equality, liberty, separation of church and state, and freedom.

3. Most families went hungry a few nights each week because there was either no food to buy or it was too expensive.  Much of the southwest was abandoned due to continuing drought and inflation raising water prices beyond the means of anyone.  No wealt existed anymore because what wealth there had been was taxed into oblivion and the taxes were spent on a debt that couldn't be paid off.  Those wealthy people who had invested in foriegn stocks before the crash were able to move to Europe or South America, taking their money with them, and the poor who had begged for the wealthy be taxed to death were finally reaping the benefits.  The country languished behind the rest of the world in technology, education, healthcare, and as a society, for 60 years before finally paying off its debt and joining the rest of the world once again as a much humbled country.

4. American politicians finally got it right and changed everything such that nothing bad happened and everyone lived happily ever after.  HA!  And I learned shit golden midgets to boot!"

Taxation is not the way out.  Raising/lowering taxes is just a shell game as well.  Raise taxes for the rich and they'll just stop spending money - therefore the poor have no money.  Raise taxes for the poor and they'll stop spending money that goes into the rich pockets.  I'm not saying it shouldn't be fair.  Taxes need to be fair but ultimately the WHERE doesn't really matter.  It all levels out.

The only way to get out of this shitstorm is to spend less money.  The public doesn't want to hear that.  The rich want tax cuts and the poor want tax cuts and everybody wants limitless free healthcare and retirement benefits.  It's physically impossible.  There just isn't enough wealth to pay for all that.

In the US alone, think about the prevalence of religions like Christianity, Jehova's Witness, Scientology, and Mormonism.  Four tales that make any rational person say, ""Are you fucking kidding me?""

Think about the people who believe things because, ""the man on the TV said so.""  Or the people who believe the world is flat!

It's not intelligence.  Originally I thought it was but intelligence is the ability to learn and think critically about what you've learned.  Look at the Biblical ""scholars"" who have memorized sections of the Bible - which is not a small book - who then take pieces of the scripture apart and analyze it.  That proves intelligence.

I was reading the forums on the Flat Earth Society's website earlier.  Now there's a group of people who aren't all stupid.  I expected they would be.  Some of them have really put a lot of thought into their theories to find ways of bolstering them against reality.

That really speaks to the core of this.  Usually the flat earth arguments sound just like religious arguments.  They only make sense if you suspend belief of one or two key facts that have been proven time and time again.

So this was my big b-day present which I received last night.  Tonight, Shawn and my boss took us out to Kai for dinner.  Okay... This was the first 5 diamond restaurant I've ever been to.  It was amazing.  ...  amazing.  Okay, the waiters would just like appear at the table... yes, I did say waiters - plural - and in a coordinated move they would take away or put down plates/drinks at the same time.  They were polite and actually paid attention.  Granted, this was like a $500 meal (group, not per person) but still.

The restaurant is on the res at Gila River Wild Horse Pass Resort so they do all indian inspired stuff using local flavors.  I had cod wrapped in cedar.  Shawn had filet mignon with local spices (I swear one pieced tasted like rain).  Just awesome.  I can't even begin to talk about the appetizers...  Oh, and the souffle for dessert... plus two dirty martinis, a Kiltlifter, and an irish coffee to top it all off were the shit.  So good.

So that's my story.  Time for sleep."

"event","Okay.  Now the entire world looks like a love scene from ST:TOS.  You know how they always filmed the ""beautiful"" woman with a soft filter that made her look hazy and starbursty?  Yeah... that's my whole world right now.

Vision fluctuates between about 20/15 and 20/25.  Which is fine by me.  It's weird as hell to wake up and be able to see.  The pain is gone.  Now the only way to describe the feeling is... funny.  My eyelids are swolen so that's part of it but there's... it's a little like I've got something in my eye.  It's probably good that I wore contacts for so many years because I'm not as uncomfortable with the feeling of a foriegn object in my eye.

Not that there's an object but I'm sure that what I'm feeling is the cut on the cornea.

yeah, did I talk in the last post about the smell?  That was weird.  When the laser was burning away the cornea to make adjustments I could smell the flesh burning.  It was exactly the same smell as when your teeth are being drilled at the dentist.  Ugh.

Anyway.  that's it.  They said my eyes seem fine this morning.  The halo effect will disappear before long and... the reason I'm not getting all that excited yet is because I know I'm not out of the woods.  For the next 6 days I need to be exceedinly cautious about rubbing or bumping my eyes and complications are possible at any time.  So..  When I'm sure they're good I'll post again."

"event","So.  This is me without glasses or contacts.

Lasik is weird.  The whole day was weird.  The worst part was the device used to force the eyes open.  It was very Clockwork Orange and painful.  The cutting of the flap was weird becuase of the odd suction on the eye.

I can see, though.  At this point it seems better than 20/20 but it's...  hazy.  Anybody who's worn contacts will understand this: it looks like my contacts REALLY need to be cleaned.  Part of that is the drops that I'm on and part of it is the fact that there are still tiny bubbles in my cornea from the forming of the flap.  (a laser is used to make the flap by vaporizing a bunch of small holes 10 micrometers under the surface to create a perforation).

There was some discomfort when I got home.  All I can say is that I'm glad it's now night because I was really light sensitive earlier.  It felt like someone was punching me in the eye.  Now, of course, that's better.  It's just a very dull ache.

I'm so out of it.  Will post more on the emotional side of it when I can actually feel emotion."

"event","I'm totally relaxed this afternoon so before I go play a cheesy RPG for a while (see: Dungeon Runners) I've decided to post an update on life in general.

The reason I'm so relaxed is our new pool.  It's not that exciting, really.  It's a 10' round x 30"" high above ground.  You know what, though?  It's nice.  We installed it last night and I just spent the last hour or so drinking beer from our new floating cooler and getting tan enough to do justice to my Mexican name.

So there's that.  There's the trip to Jamaica planned for this fall with the family.  That's going to be awesome.  We're going to the same all inclusive resort as last time (see: Shawn's sister's wedding).  Free food and alcohol for 7 days.  ...  Yes.  That's all I've got to say.  Yes.

I'm going for my CMA now.  I'm still too scared of the time constraints to try taking the CPA exam review.  The book that I'm writing would have a lot more credibility if I had the CPA so I'm sure it won't be published until that's done but the CMA is...  Well it's going to give me three letters to put after my name in the meantime.  That may make finding a publisher a little easier.  That and the CPA test plus the Becker review is like $4K and my out of pocket for the CMA is $1K.

Some reviews say that the CMA test is as hard as the CPA test but I think I'll have a much easier time.  Certified Public Accountants look at financials and verify the actual financials.  They do tax returns and audits.  Certified Management Accountants look at the financials and draw conclusions about the business and do forecasting.  Everything in my career to date has led up to being a management accountant.  Not that they don't overlap - I mean I know CPAs who give management advice and I already do tax returns.  I'm just talking about the test itself.

Work is great.  The office moved.  Now I've got a corner office on the second floor with two walls of glass.  It's my favoritest office ever.  That plus my salary and an assigned covered parking space...  I often feel like they give me too much.  I've said so to my boss.  She just laughs and says I'm the best accountant she's ever known.  That says a lot because she's been in the business a while.  ...  Which is really sad to me because I'm not that good.  Don't get me wrong - I'm good.  ;)  But I don't think I'm THAT good.  I miss stuff.  I fuck up just like anybody else.

Last happy thing before my game.  I get to see Kat on Thursday!  We're going to Pita Jungle.  Best friend and best food.  This is going to be a good week.

I just set my mood to happy for this post.  Seriously.  I really am just plain happy and so lucky to have a life that permits that happiness.

So there we go.  Pretty soon I'll be a Lord and have the letters CMA to put after my name."

Today was also the first time since Atredies died that I've been in the yard.  We talked, we cried.   And then we pulled up the metal mesh used to keep the dogs from digging in the path.  (The yard is 3/4"" rock and there's a path of rock the same color as the rest but consiting of 1/4""- that runs from the porch out around the mounds and back.)  That was...  Nice.  Tessa's death has been tempered by the fact that she won't be digging at every storm/noise/small gust of wind.

So yesterday I went to Payson for a job.  It was snowing.  I half shit my pants.  Only half, though, because I do eventually want to move to Vancouver.

Also, I should make a note.  Shawn gave me the <a href=""http://www.movado.com/Details.aspx?Id=watchesmens&watchType=Mens&watchCode=&watchId=605790&page=6"">Movado</a> for Valentines Day.  The blue is deeper and more striking than this pic site gives justice.  It's absolutely fabulous.  And I DID just use the F word.

I gave him a Blu-Ray player because that's where Netflix decided to go.  Little did I know that the market was about to choose Blu-Ray as the winner....  Now watch the prices drop.  Damn.

He wants a new dog.  I want to feel this for a little while longer.  Until I can walk out in the backyard without welling up...  It's stupid but I feel like they deserve for me to be sad.  They deserve some pain from me for a while longer.  How long that will be, I don't know... but this is just too soon."

They figured that at her age it would probably end up being a lot more.  She had a good prognosis but it wasn't going to be cheap.  Tessa was at least 12.

Even for Rusty we couldn't have afforded that.  I had to look at it that way because I didn't want to be unfair to her.  I haven't been very close to Tessa ever since I caught her eating my dead horse one day back in high school.  At the same time she deserved every last bit of care and consideration we could give.  So there we were at the emergency vet...  There was blood all over.  They took her in on a stretcher and, ever the tough old bitch that she was, she bit one of the nurses.

If there is an afterlife I'm sure she's with Atredies... and they're both young again.  Those were the dogs of my youth.  Looking at them in pictures I see more.  It's the barn, the horses, the garden, my old truck, and playing with those dogs on a summer afternoon as the sun set on the mountains...  It's Shawn and me lifting them into the big outdoor tub to bathe them, watching them roll in the grass and jump afterward, barking.  Happy."

Let's review everything since Thanksgiving in chronological order.

1.  San Francisco is too crowded and smells like pee.  The subway smells worse.
2.  Staying on the 34th floor made it better.
3.  I saw a bum holding the sign, ""Family killed by ninjas.""  I died.
4.  Xmas was nice.
5.  Returned the Venus.
6.  Addicted to Flight Simulator again.
7.  Switched to the iPhone.
8.  Working too much.
9.  Love the rain.
10. Airborne really DOES keep you from getting a cold.
11. 4AM, 911, ambulance, OMG he's dying what will I tell the children.
12. Morphine 6 units.
13. Morphine 4 units.
14. Demerol. (Angels sing)
15. 7AM Shawn has kidney stone.
16. 9AM I tell him the ambulance driver was hot.
17. 9AM and two seconds he hits me.
18. Two days later and the stone won't leave.
19. Present.

I wish I could make this go away.  I said, ""I wish it was me with the stone and not you.""  He laughed and said, ""You really wouldn't do very well with this kind of pain.""

That's probably true.  Imagine me in the ambulance...

""You're not going fast enough!  If I could get 5 seconds of relief from the feeling of an overweight elephant tapdancing on my kidney in dainty shoes I'd drive the fucking thing myself now shift it asshole!  Do you need some fucking motivation?  Fine.  If you don't go faster I'm going to kill you.  You think I won't?  I'll get off with temporary fucking insanity.  Test me motherfucker.

Who the fuck do I have to kill to get some fucking drugs around here?!  Do you need me to do it myself?  I saw Trainspotting, okay.  Give me the fucking syringe, some rubber hose, and I'll do it myself because you're obviously incompetent and stupid.  You fucking turd spawn.  Your mother is a whore with a lazy eye.""

Actually that's eerily similar to the way I am in traffic.  And now all I can see is this old dried up wrinkly woman in a purple one-piece bathing suit.  The whore with the lazy eye.  Her lips are hanging out on both sides of the bathing suit and her boobs are so low they just look like a weird double beer belly.  She leans against a pole on the porch of her run-down house with a step up porch.  She's trying to look seductive, arching her back a little and smoking a cigarette while her lazy eye wanders off.  She coughs, everything jiggles.  OMG I'm going to shit myself from laughing.

I need sleep."

I felt a bond with that employment candidate and he brought up a lot of shit.  Were this a few years ago, I might say we could have shared a life together in the past.  Now... well, I don't know.  But there was a kinship of some sort.  In trying to give him some lesson about life, I told him why I never lie to a direct question and rarely lie indirectly.  I don't tell anybody about that but it was necessary.

The taste of what happened more than 10 years ago is still very bitter and I think about it often.

I'm looking at a sheet full of numbers (P&L by month for the past 6 months) and trying to see where they create patters - where they intereact.  It's SO cool.

So the applicant who lied about his education left me a VM yesterday.  He apologized profusely.  That's nice... And I'm not being facetious.  I think someone who was trying to play me wouldn't have done that.  I wrote him an e-mail and said that there was still no way I'd hire him but I respected and appreciated the apology and sent him the link to a recruiter I know at Robert Half.

Maybe he'll learn something from this.  I still believe he's a genuinely good person.  Not sure why...  It's just one of those feelings."

So the last doc I went to actually prescribed Levaquin.  This is the drug I'd been wanting to try for quite a while.  It seemed to work and he told me that if I got better - just don't worry about it but if I didn't that I should come back and see him.  Well, I got better.

Until now.

So I tried to go back and see him and both times I called was placed on terminal hold before even speaking to a person.  Dial the number ...  ""please hold for a moment - all of our representatives are busy...""  For 5 minutes.  No thanks.  I can get that shit from Arizona Department of Revenue all day long and I sure as fuck don't need it from the doctor.

Okay so here we go.  I make an appointment with a female doctor thinking, ""How bad can this be?""  ...  She has done more and been more responsive than any other doctor thus far.  However, she's a woman and she put her finger in my ass.

A woman.  Put her finger.  Up my asshole.

As if that wasn't enough, she wanted to give me a cancer screening!  So here she is, rolling my balls around in her fingers, explaining how I should do this to see if there are any lumps.  I'm like.. Fuck!  FUCK!!!  STOP TOUCHING ME THERE!

This has got to be what you straight people feel when going to a doctor of the same gender and I really do understand now.  OMG!  It felt so dirty and wrong!

That was yesterday.  Now I'm on Levaquin (antibiotic) and Uroxatrol (shrink the prostate).  Uroxatrol has the unfortunate side effect of ""retrograde ejaculation"".  Apparently I'm going to jizz backwards into my bladder.  This is no joke.  Look it up.

This year there will be rules.  I may amend this list but for the time being it's as follows:

1.  My mother and Shawn's mother may not speak to eachother.  At all.  Ever.

2.  Dinner is at 4PM, promptly.  No one may be late.  The door will be locked.

3.  No one may complain about anything.

4.  No one may share opinions of any kind about anything.

5.  Dinner will be enjoyed in silence with the exception of commenting on things that we're thankful for and asking for items to be passed around the table.

6.  After dinner, everyone will help clean up before eating pie.

7.  After pie, everyone will leave in an orderly fashion.

"event","It's still too busy for me to post very often.  This weekend I'm going to relax a bit.  Last weekend we had my parents' dogs here.  Can I share that story?  Wanna hear it here it go...

So they dropped the dogs off (2 of them, Chelsea and Sierra) on Tuesday night.  Sierra peed right away in the excitement.  Wednesday morning we learned that my parents get up around 5AM becuase we didn't let Sierra out until about 6:30 and she'd peed again.

Thursday was nice.  I still got up at the ass crack of dawn but I let them all out, they all went to the bathroom, and I went back to bed.  Friday, Shawn got up and let them out.  Someone had peed that morning - not sure who.

Saturday was the day it stormed all morning.  I woke up to violent thunder at about 5AM and, of course, the dogs don't go pee in the rain. They don't like the rain.  ... There I was, taking them out when the rain let up (because there were like 4 storm system passing overhead that morning) so we could try to get them to go to the bathroom.  Jesus fuck.

Saturday night at 11:30, I got into bed and started reading... Just about to turn the light off and my phone rang.  My parents' alarm had gone off.  ...  1 AM I finally got home and crawled back into bed.  Nothing was wrong - the person feeding their other animals hadn't bypassed a faulty sensor despite being instructed to do so and the thing went off.

To Chelsea's credit, she only peed once and pooped up by the catbox once.  She's so small, though, that it's like..  nothing.

Meh.  So there's last week."

"event","I went to Men's Wearhouse today.

I'm never buying clothes the regular way again.  It was awesome.  The guy just picked stuff and I liked it and it looked good.  Then he did the tailoring and made it all look good.

I ended up with a dark gray couture suit, a new jacket, a bunch of other stuff and alterations to the suit, jacket, and pants.  No, it was not cheap.  However, for as pleasant a shopping experience as it was and for how good the tailored fit is, I'm FINE with that.

OMG.  I can't wait to pick up the tailored stuff next week.  I'll post a pic of me in the new suit to the myspace page."

"event","Also, we're trying out Rosetta stone for learning a new language.  As much as Spanish pisses me off and I've fought learning it out of principle, I do sometimes wish I could speak ""maid"" so that I can understand the conversations around me at the grocery store.

If this is successful, I'm going to learn Japanese just because I've always wanted to travel there but never had the courage because I can't speak the language."

"event","I'm into the math/science books lately.  I finished Zero recently and have just started The Physics of Superheroes.  Geeky but interesting.  Now, the book rightly pointed out that the original Peter Parker used his knowledge of chemistry to create synthetic webbing... Presumably because a real spider shoots web from its anus.

The new Spider-man from the movies does make his own webbing but it comes from his wrists.  Why?  Wouldn't it be so much more disturbing, and that much more awesome, if the webbing came from his ass?

My imagination runneth over.  Spider-man farts and some poor idiot gets a blast of webbing to the face.  He gets food poisoning and the entire New-York sewer system is filled with shit-soaked webbing.  I suppose anal sex would be out of the question entirely.

"event","Wow... you know it's been a while since I've used this when I'm surprised about a subject line... *sigh* Guess I'm really desperate to write. I don't even think there's anything *to* write about. Well, yesterday was Tom and my 8 month anniversary. ^.^ So happy! 8 MONTHS! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT! This is a major feat for me, it really is. I'm pretty pleased with how life is going, for the most part. The spases could stop, and things can stop being so stressful, but that, sadly, not in my range of capability. So happy. Well, finals this week, and it sucks. A lot. I don't want to take them. Too much stress. Too much stuff. They're weighted too much. But, at least I'm eating normally again. Not eating makes you *really* hungry when you do decide to want to eat again. OH! I think I mentioned in my xanga that I finished by first scarf, but now I've moved on to Courtney's scarf. ^.^ And then I'll do Nora's, who I was going to make first, but somehow courtney's yarn ended up on the needles first, and then Britni. I wanted to make Nora's first because I'm going up soon and want it done by then. I think maybe I'll make others in IL a scarf too, if I have enough yarn. I'm going to make Tom some mittens. As soon as I learn how to read the damn pattern. ^.^ Well, that's all for me to write now. See everyone later!

"event","I guess I don't really have anything to say, or at least I can't think of anything... Hmmm... well, Tom's on some band trip, which kinda sucks, 'cus I won't get to see him this weekend, but that's kinda ok, because I need to work on my health project and I don't want any distractions, and believe me, he'd be a big distraction (not that that's a bad thing ^^) but I just wanna get it done 'cus it is due Monday and all... But today was pretty good, I went to anime club and gave all the Kenshin characters diseases (no, I didn't literally give them to them myself, but I labeled them all with diseases, like Kenshin got AIDS from that one guy he killed who was s'possed to be Tomo's wife and when he got cut, he took his bloody hand and rubbed it on his cut, so now he's got AIDS. And then later on, when he first met Tomo, his cut started bleeding and then it fell on her face and she accidentally swallowed it, so now she has AIDS and rabies. Then, later on, when they have sex, she gives him herpes.) So anyways... *dot dot dot... no one wanted to know that...* I think I should appologize right here to anyone I've offended or ignored or whatever. I swear I didn't mean to. Oh, and maybe I should appologize to Nick and Eric and all the others who will be pissed off at us, and trust me, they *will* be pissed. Tracy and I are so dead. But that's okay, 'cus it was fun. ^^ Well, that's all for now. Ja ne and ciao!

"event","So, it's been a while since I've written. Basically, nothing's happened except Robert broke up with me. But that's okay, because I'm Tom's girlfriend, and it's all good. I was in a bit of depression, in which I did cut my arm, but it's healing very nicely and I'm feeling a lot better, especially because of Tom. Oh, and I'll probably tell you this before you read this, but Tracy, he doesn't hate you. Well, that's all I have to say now. I already wrote in my other journal, so I'm kinda all done with what I needed to say. Ciao!"

"event","Ok, I really thought I wasn't going to get to see Robert tomorrow, and that would have made me veeeerrry sad. I'm so happy that I get to see him, because I barely ever get to see him. So I'm really happy. I'm also really happy for Rei because she got asked out. I'm so happy happy happy. Wow, I'm really hyper now. That's what lots of Gatorade and lots of happiness does. But I'm so excited. But he lost the note that I wrote him, but it was just a bunch or random crap. I got bored in disc. and health so I was like, 'Hmm... I should write Robert a note.' So I did. And it was a page and a half. I felt special. OH! AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ADVIL TODAY! GO ME!!! YAY!!! But yeah, I'm really happy, and I've nothing more to say. So congrats Rei. And I'm soooo excited if I haven't mentioned. YAY!

"event","Ok, so I watched Teen Titans as usual, right? Yea, so I was watching and my worst fear came about. Damn Terra, I'll teach you to take away my Beast Boy! He loves me! Got it? MEEE!!!!! Die, wench, die!!!!!! I HATE YOU TERRA!! Actually, I don't hate her as much as I say. I just hate her because of the whole Beast Boy thing. She is a little irritating and all, but I don't despise her. Just really, really, really, really, really, really, really hate her. But she's kind of cool in that she can move the rocks and crap. That's kind of cool. I like her voice actress' voice too. It's cool. But really, other than that, I hope that wench dies. BEAST BOY IS MINE, YOU HEAR ME! MIIIIINE!!!!!!! GAH! But I can't believe they made her a Teen Titan! No! It's awful! I hope they all realize what they just did reaaaly quick-like and kill her. She is a demon, I tell you, a demon!!!!!! DIE!!! And they should take her room and make it my room. Mine, and I would be happy. And they could make me a Teen Titan. That wouldn't be regrettable. No, in fact, it would be a very joyous event. Anyways, be warned Terra, you will die!"

"event","Now, as we all know, I like Robert. Yes, yes I do. I also like Roger, and all of you who don't like him, you can get over it. I know a few of you don't like him because of the whole 'anti-female' thing that he was going on about, but it's just one of those jokes between us. Like Jon and my rivalry. We're pretty good friends, but we like to laugh when we beat each other (more like me always beating him!) But now there's also one other person I like. Now, I really can't say this person's name, at risk of this person perhaps reading this and then it'd be all weird between us, and just when I'm finally starting to become this person's friend... no, it just doesn't work. But, I will tell you that this person is in my chorus class. I won't give names, and by this, you can eliminate the vast majority of the school. So, if you really must know, you can ask me personally, and I'll probably tell you, now that one half of the little secret is no longer secret. But, I don't want to say it on something that someone can just look at whenever."

"event","Ok, so yesterday I went to TACO. TACO was great cus now im the VP of adminisration. its great. i love it. its my dream to follow someone around with a clipboard. But anyways, I really like hair. I have a hair fetish. Some people just don't understand *sigh*. But Tracy, I'm sorry damn it. You know, I just like the hair. I only wanted to pet his hair. And I know you're pissed at me and I can understand why, but understand that I am not out to have him as my b/f, I just wanted to pet his bloody hair, and as long as you're not going out, I will pet. Because I cannot control myself. I enjoy petting hair, it is soft and so pretty and I like to pet hair. (Oh, crap, I just realized how scary that is... -_-) But anyways, it's just the hair, I don't want him as a b/f, you shouldn't be worried about that. Oh, and don't just tell me you're not worried about it and say that you're just pissed and I'm crazy and I really need to think about who I'm talking to because you can never be worried because you eliminate competition. I'm not here to cause conflict, I just want to clear things up. I just like hair, that's all. And the thing that really sucks is that whenever I try to clear things up with someone, I always end up saying everything that's on my mind and then that person who I'm talking to will get mad at me. And then I'll get mad at myself. And then I'll be angry, and that person will be angry with me, and we'll both be angry. And I hate that. I really hate that. And then I'll cry when I'm alone, and I'll think, 'That person probably doesn't feel a thing about this. They might even be happy about it.' And then I'll depress myself and waste half my time brooding over something that doesn't need this much depression. So now that I've gone so deep into my hatred of conflict and all that, I'll just stop now. I just want to apologize to you. So I'm sorry I pissed you off."

"event","My neck, it kills. Of course, it usually does. And the fact that I'm still getting dizzy from just standing normally never helps. Argh, at Ichiro's, I went all spazzy, and i couldn't stop. It was kinda bad. Oops, maybe it was from all the movement, I don't know. All I know if that I started to move and then I couldn't control my arms, then leg, then head/neck. Oh well. But I'm listening to the almighty Junko Iwao. She's my hero. She's the voice of Tomoyo, and Tomo (sp?), and Hikari (NGE YAY!), and some other people. MY HERO! Now, for more Tomoyo... YAY! The prettiness. Now, most people hate when I go into obsessive rants, but I'm going to because I can. So, I will say right now that I love this woman, she is my hero. If you don't like my rants... you can deal. Because it's a journal and I'm allowed to rant about whatever I want. And no one is gunna stop me. NO ONE. The stress causes headaches, and in order to get rid of them, I must say everything on my mind. EVERYTHING. But I don't feel like going into anything except my obsessive rant. For she is my hero. Even more so than Utada Hikaru. Yes, even more so. Hmm... 1020 already? Time for sleepy time, ne?

I think we need a song like Sakura and Tomoyo, their FruitsCandy song. Friday the 13 is actually our 'Chocolate Night,' but she couldn't do anything tomorrow, so it had to be today. Eh, in August it'll be Friday. It was great, she was all excited about her chocolate star. Yay for Card Captor Sakura! I want my own song. I should write my own Japanese song. Yay for me, now all I have to do is learn Japanese. Shouldn't be too hard, ne? Well, that's all I have to say for now.

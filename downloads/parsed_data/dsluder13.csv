"event","I was recently asked ""Now that you've graduated college, what are you going to do?""

I replied, but thought the answer was good enough to post in a blog.  So here it is.

i want to change the world.  i want to act in a meaningful way to substantially alter the world that we live in.

how am i going to do that?

i don't know yet.

one possibility i'm playing is being promoted within Target.  I've been kind of recommended to apply for an executive position within Human Resources and I think that's a job I could take and enjoy, but also one that would put me in a position to make Target a better company.  I'm not a huge fan of corporations and the way they take over the world, but if I'm going to have to deal with them (since they aren't going anywhere), then I want to make the one I'm in amazing.  The two things I want to do within the company are to become more socially responsible (as to the environment and the guests and its impact in the community) and also to help bring back the humanity of the individual workers.  Lots of time, I feel like I'm treated more like just some worker rather than an individual human being and I'm not a fan of that.  I'd like the company to take more care of its workers and help them feel like they are an integral part of the company and that their job is a meaningful extension of them, rather than just a way to pay the bills like it is for most.

I've also developed a heavy interest in making Tshirts.  Printing out a stencil, carving it out with an xacto knife, and then spray painting it.  I like the non-professional look to it and if there was a way I could make a living out of that, I would.

Or maybe I'll go back to school after taking a year or so off.  Seattle University has a pretty fantastic Existential-Phenomenological Therapeutic Masters of Psychology program.  It concentrates on how people create meaning in their lives (or fail to do so) and looks at some of the greater questions people tend to tackle in their routine, stagnant day-to-day existence.

I want to live. I want to love. I want to create positive change. These are goals I have, the means to which I've yet to discover.

How's that for an answer?"

"event","so i was looking at all my finances and i discovered that while i was in Mexico, I definitely spent around... $1,200.  yep, that's right - i spent A WHOLE LOT OF FRICKIN MONEY!!! oh well, i had a pretty good time definitely, but damn i should not have spent so much!  AND i went to the dentist today.  when i was in mexico i broke a big piece of one of my teeth off - my top right back molar.  and i had already chipped pieces off of it and the other molar on the opposite side.  the dentist thought that since they were pretty identical in how they were decayed, they may have not developed properly as i was growing up.  they developed to be weak and low-density and because of that, they were REALLY susceptible to decay.  so i was asking about the options i had and they would either have to do a root canal and then a crown with post, and all that, for ONE tooth, carried the hefty price tag of about $2,100.  And i'm going to have to get the same work done to both of them, so that means it would be about $4,200 AND my insurance wouldn't cover it.  so the only other option was extraction - takign the suckers out.  And for each tooth, it would be at most $210 for the extraction, meaning about $420 for both.  AND my insurance would cover 80% of it.  MEANING that, in total, i would only have to pay about $120 for everything.  

so it was a hard decision..$4,200 vs $120.  So next Tuesday I'm getting 2 teeth taken out.

Yippee!!!!!!!!

But life is frickin good man...it feels good to be back in Carrollton.  Peace out"

"event","Pues, estoy en Cuernavaca para aprender espanol.  I am alive and well and all is good!  I live with the nicest abeulita and she seems like she would do anything for Zach (my roommate) and I.  She cooks very well and is just such a sweet lady!  I have classes for 6 horas por dia.  Las primeras tres son en un clase de gramatica y las ultimas tres son en un clase de cultura.  In my culture class, we learned how to cook Molletes today.  Es facil!  We went to a mall today and, well, guess what - a Mexican mall is JUST LIKE AN AMERICAN ONE!  Plenty of overpriced stores!  The only difference is that here, we are the minority!  So we get watched pretty closely by the many security guards there.  Life's different when you're a minority!  Nevertheless, it was a good time.  What sucks is that some people here are here for the grade, not for the experience.  So they sometimes bring others down with them.  But last night was amazing!  Nosotros fueron al centro (city center) y comimos a un restaurante se llama ""Los Arcos.""  La comida fue buena y una poca barata.  After we walked around el centro some, nosotros volvimos a Los Arcos.  We sat around, drank some Coronitas, and just chilled!  It was a good feeling!  Everyone down here is so hospitable and willing to help.  And as Ron said, I will never ever complain about Atlanta traffic again.  You don't know nothing until you've ridden in a taxi down here!  Life is good though!  I can't say I miss the US much!  I'm trying to immerse myself as much as I can in the culture down here.  Tomorrow, for my culture class, we get to learn how to salsa.  And then Thursday night there are Salsa lessons at the Mambo Cafe (2 horas por 40 pesos = 2 hours for 4 dollars) and then we salsa the night away.  And Friday night we were invited by some university students down here to some big party at this place called VIP.  In other words - life is good down here!!!  A mi, me gusta mucho!!!

I wish everyone una semana buena!

Buenas noches!
Flaco D"

regardless, the weather forecast looks fantastic and i have to encourage everyone to spend as much time outside as possible.

what's the time?

"event","alright, so i have to suggest this to all who read this.  the next time you take a shower, don't take it with the intention of getting clean.  just Be in the shower.  what i like to do is put my head under the shower head and let the water run down me and just concentrate on it.  feel it as it runs through your hair, caresses your skin, and tickles each follicle on the way down.  every time i do this i just get goosebumps.  and just imagine - this is the kind of stuff we filter out, the kind of stuff that some people say doesn't matter.

well dammit, it matters to me!"

Healer Idealists are abstract in thought and speech, cooperative in striving for their ends, and informative and introverted in their interpersonal relations. Healer present a seemingly tranquil, and noticiably pleasant face to the world, and though to all appearances they might seem reserved, and even shy, on the inside they are anything but reserved, having a capacity for caring not always found in other types. They care deeply-indeed, passionately-about a few special persons or a favorite cause, and their fervent aim is to bring peace and integrity to their loved ones and the world.

Healers have a profound sense of idealism derived from a strong personal morality, and they conceive of the world as an ethical, honorable place. Indeed, to understand Healers, we must understand their idealism as almost boundless and selfless, inspiring them to make extraordinary sacrifices for someone or something they believe in. The Healer is the Prince or Princess of fairytale, the King's Champion or Defender of the Faith, like Sir Galahad or Joan of Arc. Healers are found in only 1 percent of the general population, although, at times, their idealism leaves them feeling even more isolated from the rest of humanity.

 Healers seek unity in their lives, unity of body and mind, emotions and intellect, perhaps because they are likely to have a sense of inner division threaded through their lives, which comes from their often unhappy childhood. Healers live a fantasy-filled childhood, which, unfortunately, is discouraged or even punished by many parents. In a practical-minded family, required by their parents to be sociable and industrious in concrete ways, and also given down-to-earth siblings who conform to these parental expectations, Healers come to see themselves as ugly ducklings. Other types usually shrug off parental expectations that do not fit them, but not the Healers. Wishing to please their parents and siblings, but not knowing quite how to do it, they try to hide their differences, believing they are bad to be so fanciful, so unlike their more solid brothers and sisters. They wonder, some of them for the rest of their lives, whether they are OK. They are quite OK, just different from the rest of their family-swans reared in a family of ducks. Even so, to realize and really believe this is not easy for them. Deeply committed to the positive and the good, yet taught to believe there is evil in them, Healers can come to develop a certain fascination with the problem of good and evil, sacred and profane. Healers are drawn toward purity, but can become engrossed with the profane, continuously on the lookout for the wickedness that lurks within them. Then, when Healers believe thay have yielded to an impure temptation, they may be given to acts of self-sacrifice in atonement. Others seldom detect this inner turmoil, however, for the struggle between good and evil is within the Healer, who does not feel compelled to make the issue public.

"event","So I was taking a shower and had a bit of an epiphany.  I know lots of people will think this is common sense, but clarity came with it.  It was something personal, and no matter what I say I can't convey what I felt, only what I thought.  No matter what I do, no matter what I say, no matter what I think, no matter how well I do in school, no matter who my friends are, no matter anything else, all I can do, all we can do, is simply exist.  We can only be, we have no control over it, it is a requirement for being human.  I can have wonderful thoughts, epiphanies, wonderful ideas, but all I'm doing is the same thing as everyone else.  Genghis Khan, Helen Keller, Adolf Hitler, Gandhi, Dahmer, MLK Jr., MLK Sr., my mom, my roommates, my girlfriend, my friends, my professors - we're all in the same boat.  I don't know how the world works or why it works, I think those questions can be a bit superficial.  

Wait, stop, I'm speaking more from thought than feeling.  I'm full of humility.  All I can think is of how we are all equal.  We don't have a choice in the matter, we are equal, there's no way for us to be unequal.  You can be as good or bad as you want to, you can transcend moral values if you want to, you can be God or the Devil, you can do whatever you want.  

Welcome to existence, nice to meet you.

So now that we're all in the same boat, what's next?  As you take your seat in the boat, will you give your neighbor the crotch or the ass?  Will you say excuse me, or will you elbow them in the face.  It's all your choice."

"event","alright, so for some reason, i REALLY don't feel like going to sleep.  im a little tired, and i could prolly fall asleep, but i just dont want to.  maybe im afraid to confront my thoughts because when im laying there in bed, i have no choice BUT to think and nothing to take my attention away from those thoughts.  or maybe...ill go ahead and confront them and write about them and get them OUT...sounds like a plan

caution: long entry ahead

so today the famous mac bowman passed away.  one guy who could be truly called a badass.  this guy was amazing and he had SUCH an effect on SO MANY people's lives!  when i die, that's what i would love to have done.  but then in the grand scheme of things, that's what we are all already doing.  i mean we all have an incredible effect on each other's lives, period.  you don't have to be a cool band director to do something like that.  hell, give a guy on the street a dollar, how about NOT refusing to give money to someone when you really do not have any idea what he/she will use it on.  sorry, i don't mean to preach or anything in the entry but i was just thinking of levinas and that popped into my head.  SO...death...the great equalizer.  a milestone in existentialism - how will you live your life knowing that, in the end, you will die.  period.  no ellipsis, your physical manifestation of being will end as you currently know it.  SO how should one live his or her life?  you don't know what's going to happen after you die.  you don't know what happened before you were born.  so get over it, quit worrying about it.  worry about now.  here. the present.  

when i caught news of his death, i immediately observed myself.  did i cry?  nope, not at all.  i haven't cried in years.  maybe it's because i have suppressed the need/desire through years of inculcation into the masculine stereotype (which i have yet to attain and hope to never arrive there).  i am man hear me...not cry.  me tarzan me strong and therefore not able to display sensitive emotions.  screw that, i feel like if i wanted to cry i would.  but i just didn't feel that want.  maybe i look at death differently.  maybe he meant more to manaree than to me.  maybe she plays into the ""stereotype"" of crying when someone dies.  i dont know.  i mean its not like they were close friends and buddy buddy when he died, she hadnt seen him in a while.  neither had i.  i had the memories though and plenty of them.  she did too.  his neck.  thats all i have to say.  and the eclipse.  and his jokes.  he was a badass i say, most definitely.  he had a hard exterior but that man loved music.  it flowed through him like the blood in his veins.  

life works in amazing ways.  right after amanda called, Come Sail Away came on the radio.  that was from our 10th grade show i think.  andrew thought it was a little creepy.  i didnt,  knew it was just one of those signs you get.  one of those metaphorical pats on the back letting you know all is well.  i have no doubt Mac is being his ornery, crazy self in the afterlife.  

but what do i know of the afterlife?  ive never been there.  or maybe i have and i just dont remember?  why dont i remember?  maybe i chose to forget it ... why?  because thats how this life works.  or maybe not.  im no expert!  i just love the philosophize and theorize about it.  itll be interesting what happens when i die.  maybe ill go to the fundamentalist Christian hell or the liberal Christian heaven.  or maybe ill ascend into nirvana (pending on attainment of enlightenment, of course).  or perhaps i will be reincarnated as a shetland pony.  hell if i know.  heaven if you know.  

what's it matter?  there's no way to definitely know.  so why not life not knowing, not worrying.  why not live life in such a way as to not cause any suffering for anyone else.  here's an idea!  be as benevolent as my mind, body, and spirit let me!  expand the minds of others...give a dollar when i have it...love like theres no tomorrow.  why?  because how do we know there is a tomorrow?  

is there a tomorrow?  can you concretely say that there is?  nope, no way, no how, nu uh buddy.  (imagine the pauly shore ""weasel"" as you think ""buddy"")  tomorrow is no guarantee.  ha, neither is yesterday.  maybe you woke up today, a completely manufactured human being with memories implanted into your head.  preposterous?  not really.  anything can happen if you really believe in it.  

what the hell is knowledge anyways?  what does it mean to ""know"" something?  are you assimilating new information or remembering forgotten, hidden information you now have access to?  who knows?  why worry? why bother?

Live, that's all you can do.  You can think, you can feel, you can philosophize, psychologize, sociologize, and ostracize for all I care.  i do it too.  but for God (or Allah or Budda or Krishna or Yahweh or (insert name for God) sake just live your life.  dont think about how to live it or think about living it - Just Do It.  

Ha, nike quote.  ""i've got the solution to sweatshops...air conditioning!""  i saw mitch hedberg in concert friday night and that was one of his jokes.  hes one funny guy.  did you know that a burrito is really just a sleeping bag for beef?  and that its fucking impossible to throw away a yo-yo.  it is, believe it or not!  

just live and love guys.  thats all i can say, and thats all i can ever ask of each and every one of you.  all other advice really just fits into that.  help each other out.  when someone dies, mourn the loss of them but don't attach yourself to the grief.  feel it and let it go.  and live and love.

and write a limerick if you can"

In September 2003 (reported in video on the CBS News Web site in January 2004), he set out on a 1,500-mile trip, rolling from Ratlam, India, to Lahore, Pakistan, where he said he hopes to thank President Pervez Musharraf for his India-Pakistan peace initiatives.

And a 12-year-old girl, who was improperly touched by a 40-year-old man (resulting in his conviction for lewd conduct), was revealed by court investigators to have voluntarily performed oral sex on, or intercourse with, at least 40 men (Monterey, Calif., February)."

"event","So I went to Arby's for lunch and had my #8 with curly fries and a coke.  I most certainly enjoyed it and then proceeded to drive back to work.  So we're all stopped at a red light, it's like a 4 lane, one way road with at least 4+ cars in each lane.  So I hear police sirens and look around and don't see em anywhere.  They sound pretty close so I'm spastically lookin around cuz I'm a kid when it comes to stuff like that and still like to watch them go by and all, lol.  Anyways, it turns out they were next to my lane pulling in right behind me.  So I pull up as far as I can (another 6-8 inches or so, wowwie) and then I can't go anywhere!  And they seem to be in a HUGE hurry!  So the first cop car turns its wheels as if it's about to go onto the sidewalk and he pauses and after not movin for about 10 more seconds, he gets on the sidewalk.  Ok, the sidewalk is about the width of his car plus 12 inches, not a lot of clearance!  The first cop barely squeezes through a signpost and newspaper stand thingie and the second cop follows him.  Well, he's about 6 inches too far to the right so his side mirror goes right into the sign post.  Luckily for him (and the mirror and the sign) he had those mirrors that fold in (you know, the ones where you walk by a car and run RIGHT into the side mirror and you're all ""HOLY CRAP i broke it!"" but it turns out it just folded in and all is good) so then the cops went about another 10 feet until they came to a trashcan thing bolted into the sidewalk.  Then they made the great decision to get the hell off the sidewalk and back behind another car that wasn't going anywhere.  After that the light changed to green and we all started goin and they flew the hell out of there.  So all in all, they accomplished pretty much what they would've accomplished had they waited for the light.  Well maybe they gained 3 car lengths.  So yeah, that was the highlight of my day thus far."

"event","Traditional Marriage in America Comes to an End 

Thousands of formerly ardent Christians filed for divorce this morning, as others raped their children and household pets, after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that gay people are citizens too. 

""My marriage is over,"" spoke one upset Christian as he dry-humped the fender of a parked car. ""My marriage isn't worth anything,"" he insisted. ""I feel no connection to my wife and children and I just want to do whatever I please, when it pleases me to do it."" With that he turned to a passing elderly woman and shouted for her to reveal her ""tits."" 

This same scene is being repeated over and over again, on every street in every city and town in America. Once devoted parents and spouses, America's Christians are denouncing any bonds between themselves and their families as they embark on a binge of sex, drugs and socialism. 

""We warned you that this would happen,"" insisted one anti-human rights activist. ""We told you that gay citizens enjoying equal rights would destroy marriage, the family and even Christianity itself. And now it's happened,"" he said. ""You should have listened to us. If you had, I wouldn't of had to have sex with three different strange men in a public restroom this morning."" 

The fallout from today's decision is enormous and far reaching. So big is the change that swept America this morning that it may be days before a true accounting of the damage is complete. As things stand, one unconfirmed report has Bob Jones Jr., of Bob Jones 
University, defecating on his bible upon hearing the news, while other witnesses have come forward to report that they had seen Pat Robertson, former leader of the Christian Coalition and the host of the 700 club, enjoying sex with a chair. 

Congress was quick to pass an appropriations bill funding the thousands of new orphanages needed to care for the abandoned children. It is hoped that this is only a temporary measure and that Christians will yet accept the financial responsibility for their families, even if they no longer love them and insist on masturbating 
in public."

I made a 108: Relatives may give you quizzical looks, and so may friends, but you know in your heart of hearts that you are following your inner voice. Though you may not be romancing a single person, you are romancing the world. Celebrate your freedom on National Quirkyalone Day, February 14th!"

"event","So, 9:10, at work...nothign to do.  Wow, routine rocks my socks off.  So last night me and mom went over to my bro's house to help him finish the apartment style basement.  They're putting up those tile ceilings so we were marking studs (oh yeah - the studfinder went crazy when I put it on me, you know what that means)  and nailing in the little ledges and stuff for their living room/dining room/kitchen.  Fun times.  Or not.  I stabbed my finger with one of the point edges and it went in like a half inch!  It clised my finger wide frickin open!  Blood was just splurting out!  haha, ok, not really - I did stab it and it bled for like a minute and that was all.  We were over there for like 3 hours and that was the extent of it.  When I grow up - my ass is paying someone else to build and finish my house cuz DAMN that's a pain.  Then I came home and chatted online and that was the extent of my night!  Exciting - I know.  But hey, at least this entry is pretty short!  The day is still young though, mwahahaha."

"event","What a wondaful wondaful weekend.  I went to good ol Jacksonville and visited a whole buncha people!  Let's see, I'm gonna try to make this not-so-long.  Friday night I went down there and FORGOT MY NEW CAMERA - I was ticked but didn't realize it until I was about an hour from my house, so I didn't feel like adding 2 hours to my trip time and kept on truckin!  So I got there and went by Sonic to have a good ol cheeseburger and a vurry vurry nice girl brought it out to me, I love Jacksonville because everyone is so damn friendly!  So then I called Argenia and she didn't pick up her phone!!!  So I went to Dixon Hall and visited Krista and met Katie who was pretty frickin cool.  Right as I went up to Dixon and called Krista, Argenia called me but I made her wait cuz she's my bitch like that (she denies it, but it's true, I don't care what she says).  So yeah, hung out in  Dixon for a little bit and saw Sam (gay people are such a trip, I for real miss them) and that was about it.  So then Argenia calls me to come play hide and seek over at this apartment complex so I eventually leave and come over there.  I get to meet David, Teddy, Stumpee(Lindsey was her real name, but nicknames are just so much better), and Becka.  Stumpee and Becka were most certainly cool as hell.  So after standing around and talking we ended up playing hide and seek in pairs but then Argenia left me when I had to pee and proceeded to do so in the woods near where we were standing.  And I didn't lost that game NOR did I lose the next one.  So we stopped and just talked a lot and THEN Miss Laura King drove up (she lives like right across the parking lot in the apartment complex) and it was all HOLY CRAP cuz I haven't seen her in ages!!!  Found out her and Cupcake broke up, surprised the hell out of me though - they seemed like they were a match made in heaven!  Guess not though!  But she seemed to be doin well, she's still workin at the Calhoun County Jail as a warden or whatever.  But it was really great seein her and talkin to her, it's been such a long time!  So while we were talkin, Argenia's little (for all you high school kiddies, Argenia is a sister in Sigma Alpha Iota, a professional music women's fraternity, and Emma is currently pledging or whatever they call it and Argenia is her big sister which is basically a mentor/friend already in SAI) drove up and I eventually got to meet her.  She was cool as anything too, a little too much like Argenia, it scared me!!!  So eventually Laura went in and we all left to go bowling.  I whupped up on the first 2 games but then Emma whupped up on me for the third game.  So then we left and like 2/3 of the way back to the apartment this TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR happened and it was wild, couldn't even see where you were going!!!  So we ran out of the car and ran in the apartment and then Stumpee wanted to play in the rain so me and emma and her did (that's right, I'm a pimp, you know it) and after that got boring we went inside and dried off.  Me and Argenia eventually went back to her place and we both basically passed the heck out!  Saturday slept late, it was fantastic!  Got up and took a shower after Argenia.  Nothing like a LUKEWARM shower that eventually turned into COLD WATER at the end.  That's ok though, it was a beautifully warm day!!!!!  So me and Argenia and Becka went to a bakery so Becka could order soem stuff for this guy's senior recital and then to Krystal's.  Becka and Argenia both ate 6 Krystals and 2 Chiks and then a half an order of cheese fries a piece.  I had 4 Krystal Chiks and was content...They were for real about to vomit everywhere, I felt so sorry for em.  So then Becka accidentally threw her pimptight sunglasses away so we found em and I got em out and we went to Hibbett Sports (yep, they have one in Jacksonville!) so Argenia can get some new shoes.  We proceeded to do so and Becka put a big foam elephant hat on that was nifty.  I so wish I could've had my camera though, so I could chronicle all this!  But that's ok...soon enough.  So we left and then went back to Argenia's apartment and I called Jen Toth, or she called me, I dunno, but me and her made plans that night.  And then I called Krista and went over to Dixon to hang out.  I met Rochelle who was the RA on duty in the lobby and she was a cool kid too.  She wasn't a Southerner but she still lived in Dixon so that makes her A-OK.  We all talked and hung out for a good little bit!  Eventually me and Krista went to Subway and ate and went back to Dixon.  I saw Jason of all people and we all talked and junk.  So after a bit I went back to Argenia's to wait for Jen to call.  She eventually did so and after going a tiny bit lost I found the house where she was at.  Jen is a Delta Zeta and one of her sisters was having a bit of a party at her house.  So for a while it was me, this other guy who was pretty cool and like 5 girls and then 10 girls and then at one point it seemed like there were 14 or 15 girls!!!  So we were likin the party until guys started showin up and girls started leavin.  Oh well, life shall surely go on.  But yeah, I had a real good time, met a few real cool people.  BUT on a side note - I was annoyed at one point cuz this guy said his mom was marrying a black man and you could just tell of how he brought it up and talked about it he disapproved of it.  And then this other guy was talking about how something like that was just kinda wrong.  Stuff like that just irks the HELL out of me.  I don't care if I was in AL, if a black man and a white woman wanna get married, so let them, the color of their skin shouldn't matter.  Ugh, racists piss me off.  ""I'm not prejudiced, I just have preferences""  Bullshit, that's racism.  Anyways, sorry, so I eventually left the house at like 5am and went to Argenia's and she was nice enough to let me have a key so I let myself in (instead of havin to wake her up like last time!) and crashed on the couch and it was good.  Sunday, slept late - AGAIN!  Watched ""Being John Malkovich"" on TV and eventually got up and took a shower.  Emma had come over to do some laundry and they were in Argenia's room.  And I took a hot shower and that was great, so then I came downstairs after getting de-nakefied and watched The Lion King 1 1/2 with them.  Argenia came up with the great word that Lion King 1 1/2 isn't a sequel or a prequel...it's a duringquel.  Special AL people.  I was famished and offered to go get some food for whoever wanted some and Argenia had me run by Long John Silver's and I spent $10 on one meal.  She had so much food...and soem good ol draft A&W root beer.  I just had a burger from Burger King...$3.01.  So I came back and she ate like half her meal and Emma fell asleep and then Argenia took a shower and while she was in the shower, I walked to open the door outside to get something out of my car and who was standing there to open the door to come in?  No one but good ol Michelle Connor.  Yeah, my ex girlfriend that was Argenia's roommate.  Kinda funny how me and Michelle dating made Argenia hate Michelle, but then they eventually became good friends!  Anyways, that's a whole nother story.  So yeah, I saw her, gave her a hug and grabbed the CD.  It was a little awkward the entire time though since I hadn't seen Michelle in I guess over a year or so.  So yeah, all four of us were there until Argenia and Emma left to go over to Becka's or sumthin and then it was me and Michelle for a split second and then Moose, her new ex boyfriend showed up.  This is the guy that hated me whenever I would come to Jax and I saw Michelle and gave her a hug or something because he couldn't understand how you could be friends with an ex.  Well...now he knows so I guess he doesn't hate me anymore.  It was pretty much her and Moose in her room and me in Argenia's room since there was still an awkward air.  So we all eventually left to go out out to eat with this group of people they always go out to eat with.  It was me, Krista, Michelle, Moose, Katie, and Sherri.  We went to Jefferson's and the seating arrangement happened to put me and Moose right beside each other.  The girls talked most of the night since it was about SAI stuff and me and Moose kinda sat there and listened.  Moose didn't really say a thing, I guess it was just awkward for him and maybe just a tiny bit for me but I eventually got over it all.  We had a good time and eventually I headed back to the apartment behind Moose and Michelle to grab all my stuff and head out.  I shook Moose's hand and said bye and then gave Michelle and hug.  She hugged me good back which just felt kinda good.  And we talked and poked fun at each other as she walked me to the door and then I gave her one more hug...another good one and I was on my way!  So then I got home and pretty much went to bed!  Good weekend eh?  So much for making a long story short!!!  Hope everyone else had a good one!"

Well have you ever had the opposite - you're all EXTRA full and somebody's cooking something and it smells, and you'd prolly like the smell if you were hungry, but you're full and the smell makes you wanna run away because it makes you feel queasy but the bad thing is that you're cubicle is like 15 feet from the little kitchen?  Yeah, well I'm the latter right about now.  I went to Quizno's for the first time in my life and had an oh so delicious Chicken Carbonara, I got the regular just because I try to not overeat like I used to and I still couldn't finish it!  The walk back to work wasn't bad but after I sat down I got that whole ""sickly full"" feeling.  Oh well, that's ok though, I'll just complain about it and it'll go away sooner or later.

"event","Off of Jay Leno:

Turning to this week's primary contests, Leno said: ""After all the voting, President Bush called John Kerry to congratulate him. I'm not sure what they talked about. I think we can rule out swapping war stories. Very nice of him to call John Kerry to congratulate him. I'm sure that was heartfelt. Imagine Osama bin Laden calling Bush and saying, hey congratulations getting Saddam, yeah, good luck buddy!"" 

""I watched the other night, John Kerry supporters were holding a big victory party. And they showed John Kerry and Ted Kennedy speaking to them on a giant screen. Then I realized it wasn't a giant screen. It was just John Kerry's head and Ted Kennedy's head. It just looked like a giant screen."" 

""After failing to win a single seat on Tuesday, John Edwards described his campaign as the little engine that could. And afterward Bush called him too and said you're not going to believe this, but I'm reading that book right now."" 

""As you know John Edwards based his campaign in the fact that there are two Americas -- one for the wealthy and one for everyone else. And after his speech he thanked everyone else and went back to the America for the wealthy."" 

""Actually, Edwards officially dropped out of the race yesterday. I love it how candidates always have to make it official when they drop out. We know they lost. When a team loses the Super Bowl they don't hold a press conference the next day. OK we're going to announce now, it's official, we lost. We know you lost. We were there."" 

Off of David Letterman:

""Have you seen any of the new Bush television commercials? ... In one of the commercials you see George Bush for 30 seconds, in another commercial you get to see George Bush for 60 seconds. Kind of like his stint in the National Guard."""

"event","Oh, what a wonderful wonderful weekend I had.  Here's the run through:  Friday night I went to Johnny's BBQ (it's been like a YEAR since I've been there!!!) with Mana, Jeanette, Brandon, Erin, and Erin's guy.  It was nifty, good food as always.  Jeanette and Mana got into it because Jeanette doesn't think Mana should get another Mustang but Mana's convinced that's the only car she would look good in.  Now I don't think she should get a mustang either, I mean it's got a shitty safety rating and there are gonna be plenty of cars out there with better gas mileage and safer and all.  If you ask me, there are CERTAINLY more important things in life than how good your car looks or how good you look in your car. BUT that's just me and it's her prerogative to do whatever she wants.  Mana was PMSin too so that prolly didn't help.  After that I ran home and took Mana home and then just hung out at Barnes & Noble for a bit.  Nothing like just hangin out by yourself and readin and doing whatever, it's very relaxing.  That was about it for that night, nothing too exciting. :-D  So then Saturday mom woke me up at 11:55 and she was like ""it's noon - you should be up by now!"" and I'm all ""NO IT'S NOT!!! I HAVE 5 MORE MINUTES!!"" but I got up anyway and went and took a shower and all and went to give Ducky her Amoxycillin for her ear infection and took the dogs for a walk and then I headed all the way to Fayetteville.  Not too bad of a drive, kinda scenic when you get off the interstate.  It took me like an hour and 15 to get there, not too bad.  So I went in and paid and eventually found Paragon and Brinay was all callin me a punk or something cuz I didn't tell her I was coming.  Surprises are fun!!!  And she seemed surprised so it was all good.  And then I went and found MHS and Tiff and Randi and Katie were all doing their little girl hair stuff.  It was cool, Tiff was listenin to Luda's ""Whats yo fantasy"" and I hadn't heard that in a LOOOOOOOOONG time.  Made me want to whip out my CD on the way home but Aakash still has that CD holder.  Dammit.  So I walked around and hung out and saw people and all and it was good stuff.  Haven't really hung out with Brinay in a good bit so it was great seein her.  They were talkin about goin to La Parrilla after the show and I was all excited cuz she invited me too!!!  So I helped GSU with their floor and as much as I absolutely LOVE Brinay her show is just not as exciting as it could be.  It's her first time ever writing a show like that so I've gotta give her some mad props.  I mean their score went up 11 points - how ya like them apples?  And McEachern was great of course.  A few dirty spots but I've got no doubt they'll be cleaned up.  And then the show ended and I found everyone and said bye to everyone and then left with Brinay and some of the GSU folks.  Turns out they weren't goin to La Parrilla cuz this one girl's mom made some spaghetti.  Sad times, but the spaghetti was good enough!  After following Brinay and doing a couple of U-turns we found their house - which was monstrous!!!!  I mean the lower level of the house was just a tad smaller than my entire house!  And the lower level had it's own kitchen with dishwasher and oven and stove and all!!!  I don't know why you need two kitchens when only 3 people were living in the house!!!  So I hung out for a bit and then headed home since I had to be at work at 8 on Sunday.  So...Sunday rolls around and I get to work at Target after being gone for 6 months.  It wasn't bad at all, I really enjoyed it!!!  It was great seeing all the old people that I missed and everything.  And of course Tracy was happy to be working with me and switched shifts with me cuz I am just that cool!!!  I fixed the two gift registry printers and did Tracy's break and just had good 'ol time!!!  I got off at 4:30 and then headed home and rotated my tires.  That took about 2 hours and absolutely tore my back up!!!  But it was done and now the tires up front have plenty of tread and it's amazing how much smoother the ride is!!!  Now I just gotta change my oil and I think I'll undertake that on Thursday before my trip to Jax this weekend.  So yeah, after that I went to Zaxby's and got some of the best chicken fingers in the WORLD with some of the best chicken finger sauce in the WORLD!  And then I got home and was about to read when Mana texted me and wanted me to get online and she told me about her Saturday, the high points of which I will not expose but this one guy seems to have a pretty big crush on her.  And she's also got another guy that she met online that she has SO MUCH in common with it's not even funny!!!  The weird thing is...this guy kinda acts and looks like me...it's freaky.  He was talkin about working at Target last night and just how he talks and flirts and all - SCARY!  But I'm really happy for her in that respect, she's been through a WHOLE lot of shit and she's never even really had a good boyfriend and right now, lol, she seems to have a couple of prospects!!!  So good for her, it's so funny to see her so excited and cut and paste pieces of her online conversations with Doug on our convo so I can see what she says.  It's great seeing friends you love happy like that.  Whenever she does that I wanna be like ""Ack Ack VOMIT!!!""  cuz it's so sweet it's sick, but then I have a feeling I've prolly done the same thing to her multiple times so it's all good.  I can't complain, I've had several great girlfriends and I know we did some sickeningly sweet stuff.  When she does stuff like that it kinda makes me miss em though, just because when you're with someone like that and entire new part of you comes out and it's such a great feeling.  But that's ok!!!  I've chosen to take a hiatus and I am thoroughly enjoying the single life, it's taken some getting used to but I don't mind it at all.  Whoever is the next person I date though, there's gonna be a whole lot of pent up...everything so I hope they'll be ready for it all, lol.  So yeah, that was my weekend and now I'm here at work and it's Monday and I think I'm gonna go do some schoolwork since I don't have anything else to do!!!  Everybody have a GREAT week and take it easy!"

"event","Alright, so last night I had one of the weirdest dreams.  And it's wild cuz I could so vividly remember it RIGHT when i got up.  But of course that memory slowly left throughout the day so I'm gonna go ahead and say what I remember of it.  It starts with us in an airplane.  I'm not sure who us is but I remember it felt like people I knew and then some I didn't.  Wait, I dunno if I knew any of them.  Anyways, it was just a regular plane and we were flying and it was like the plane was going in the wrong direction or something.  Just didn't feel like we were going where we were supposed to.  So we descend below cloud cover and below us, well, wait, it almost seems like we were flying like RIGHT above them, we were so close to them.  Them is all these wild buildings on the ground.  I mean they were just huge and so colorful and it was just like a whole different world, weird and wild architecture and everything.  Certainly an awe-inspiring sight.  And then I don't remember us landing or anything rather than just being on the ground. Wait, no, sorry to backtrack - I think at one point or another in the plane we were so close that we were taking ""evasive maneuvers"" to avoid some of these buildings.  And it almost seems that at oen point or another we were flying like straight for a building and we had to go higher and higher and higher and the nose of plane kept gettingcloser and closer to being straight up and I don't think we managed to clear the building and maybe after that is when I remember being on the ground with everyone that was in the plane.  And we, or at least I, was just in amazement of all the buildings around.  I mean its like a whole new world and everything's so huge and beautiful!  Sp then it's like we were all in this convenience store.  We were all a bit confused as to where we were or what was going on.  There were other people in the store that weren't off of the plane too.  So I remember going up to one person and saying something along the lines of ""I know this is going to sound really weird but we just got off a flight and I think we're lost and we have absolutely no idea where we are.""  And the person I was asking just walks away or shrugs it off or whatever.  So then I find another person and ask them the same question and they tell me that we are in "" New (something that started with a P like Polliner or something), New Oregon.""  And that's all I remember.  I wish I could convey what this place looked like though, I mean it was just amazing.  So yeah, that's my story.  Went to a lacrosse game today.  The team I was rooting for got their asses kicked.  But then again, it was their first game ever and pretty much the entire team was inexperienced and they played last year's state champions.  So yeah, then I came home and started putting some clothes away and all.  Then we had dinner and mom called me up to treat Ducky's ear infection and that was a whole lot of fun.  She had no idea what was going on or what to do and then Sergio was there saying ""do it this way"" or ""do it that way"" or ""you didn't do it right"" and all.  He really frustrates me when he does that, when he's all saying that you've gotta do it one way and he's never done it before!  Whew, ok, no more ranting, I'm watching Basic Instinct and it's getting good!!!  So ya'll have a great week and I'll talk to you later!!!"

"event","Alright - sorry sorry sorry for accusing Bush of the whole Draft crap.  He's not involved in it, he didn't start it and has no part in it really.  As much as I hate giving Bush any type of credit, he's not in the picture when it comes to this.  I left the post in a hurry and didn't check out the facts, yes I know.  The democrats proposed this and are the sponsors of it (13 of them at least)  Ok, so the question is Why?  I left something similar to this on Myspace.com and one of my friends, ""Get Rid of Bush,"" responded as he was the one that first notified me of this.  His ""theory"" is that maybe this bill isn't supposed to really go through the House and Senate and all.  Perhaps it's more of a stunt to show Republicans that your kids too could be involved in this war we have going on in an effort to bring about some empathy for the war situation.  Who knows, if I have time today I'm planning on emailing the Reps and Senators from GA and see what they have to say on the issue.  Lemme know what you think."

That's right, all able-bodied 18-26 year olds, both male and female, will be drafted and selected for either military service or something related to homeland security or some shit like that.  Check out <a href=""http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/g_three_sections_with_teasers/legislative_home.htm"">the Legislation Records</a> site and search for S 89 or HR 163 to check out the specifics of the bill.

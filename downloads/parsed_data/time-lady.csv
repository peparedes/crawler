"event","Okay, it was over-ambitious to think that I would be able to update my journal regularly while on this trip.  I haven't even managed to write in my actual journal every night.  Plus internet has been spottier than hoped.  But anyway, here's a quick update: 

We've spent the last week in London, having a fabulous time.  My friend Sarah flew out and met up with us on our first day and we proceded to take London by storm.  We saw three plays: Love Never Dies (the Phantom of the Opera sequel), Butley (with Paul McGann--whom I met and talked to and got an autograph from and am now more fully in love with than I was before which is saying something), and Les Miz (which I've always wanted to see and now have).

We also went on several day trips including Stonehenge, Windsor, Hampton Court, Bath, Leeds, Dover (technically...), etc. 

We saw all the major highlights in London, including, of course, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, St. Paul, Trafalger Square (my favorite--we climbed on the lions, which is always fun), etc. 

Oh, I also bought too many Doctor Who autographs, but they were excellent ones, including a Richard Briars autograph as the evil military guy in Paradise Towers, which I thought was wonderfully specific. 

We also did a thousand other things, but I'm paying for internet by the minute right now, so I'll cut it short.  Headed to Scotland now, and then Dublin.  Will update again when I can.

"event","Hello, all!  It's been...like...forever since I last posted on LJ, which makes me kind of sad, because I love LJ and I love all my LJ friends.  I've thought about posting about a thousand times over the last few months, but have never actually gotten around to it, largely because they're using a new filter at work that wont let me post from there --- not that I would post during working hours, of course....  But, as I hardly ever turn on my computer at home, not being able to pull up lj and post the little things that go through my brain throughout the day right before I go home means that I pretty much, well, never post them at all.  However, the magical SUMMER will be here in two short weeks, and I am making it my goal to begin posting and checking LJ again regularly as soon as it does.  I'm actually leaving for a three week trip to France, England, Scotland, and Ireland a week after school lets out, so (assuming I have internet access along the way) I plan to post about my trip as it's happening.  Oh, I also joined a dieting site (myfitnesspal.com -- it's awesome, you should check it out) about 4 months ago and have lost 25 pounds!  I've never actually done the ""dieting"" thing before, so I'm super excited about my progress and thought that, as it's a major event in my life, I should probably record my experiences in my JOURNAL.  That is what a journal's for, isn't it?  So, yeah.  I should have some posts on that front, as well.  

As it's been I don't even know how long since I last posted, I don't know if any of you lovely people even remember me, but if you do, I'm on my way back and I've missed you!  See you soon!"

"event","I've been going into TV withdrawal over the Christmas holidays--all of my shows have been either between seasons or on a holiday hold.  It. Has. Been. Hell.  But this weekend the tide turns!  Chuck is <i>finally</i> back tonight and last Friday Merlin's new season started airing.  Now all I need is Supernatural and Doctor Who to get the show on the road and my world will once again be complete.  And to make things even better, over the Christmas break I got a magical <b>DVR</b> to record all my wonderful shows, so I don't have to do anything drastic like <strike>illegally steal them from teh intranets</strike> if I want to, I don't know, go out on Friday night like a non-dork.

Speaking of non-dorkdom, I used my week-long snow day to finally LEARN HOW TO KNIT and managed to go from not having a clue about what I was doing last Friday to completing my first not-to-shabby-if-I-do-say-so-mahself scarf last night.  Pictures will follow.  I've long known the basics of crochet and have churned out many a crocheted scarf in my day, but my heart has always really been in knitting.  The stitches just look so much prettier and neater to me.  I don't know why it's taken me this long to get around to swapping over, but the day has finally come.  And, of course, now that I know how to knit, I no longer have an excuse to put off staring <a href=""http://wittylittleknitter.com/""><b>The Scarf</b></a>.  I never really wanted to get started on such a huge undertaking while I was crocheting, because obvs. The Scarf was <i>knitted</i> so I could never hope to achieve anything remotely authentic.  I don't know that I'll jump into this plan right away---I might need to hone my skills a bit first--but it is now In The Cards.  It is a Fait Accompli, if you will. The Scarf will be knitted.  And it will be good."

"event","School has now officially been canceled for the third day in a row.  Spring Break is dwindling before my very eyes.  I was really surprised when they called today because my dad and I drove to town in his old jeep and the roads were completely fine, except for over the bridges.  Even there it wasn't super slick, just fairly slushy.  I figure there are probably some back roads and old bridges some of the buses have to drive over that aren't in as good a shape as the main roads. I'm sure they had a reason.  

Anyway, I guess the upside is that tomorrow I can actually accomplish a few things, instead of sitting at home snowed in all day, updating my live-journal.    The lining in my car is falling around the sunroof, so I can finally get to the repair place while they're open and get that done.  It's supposed to only cost about 30 bucks, so it'll be good to get that checked off my list.  Plus my stupid iphone <i>still</i> refuses to install the update they put out in <i>JULY</i> and it's gotten to where I can't even download any apps because they all require the new software to work, so I need to go by the AT&T place and see what they can do about it.  That's needed to be done for a really long time now.  If I can get those two things accomplished, I will decide it was worth sacrificing <i>another</i> future day off.  

Another silver-lining of being trapped in my house with absolutely nothing to do for three days?  I've managed to get done some seriously over-due deep cleaning on my room and closet.  I've got a huge black plastic bag of donation stuff to get rid of, I have actual drawer space again, and my list of books to give away on paperbackswap.com has grown significantly.  I put a Doctor Who audiodrama up last night and it was snapped up in less than ten minutes.  To be truthful, I have way too many credits on pbs already, but I find it way easier to get rid of books if I know they're going to a loving home.  

Last bit of ramble--found some awesome snow day icons.  Way overdue, but I am now prepared for future lj snow references.  And as they are actually talking about more snow next week, future lj snow references are an unfortunate possibility."

"event","School's canceled again tomorrow!  Two days in a row.  We actually did get some snow--at least two inches, which is more than we've gotten in a long time.  I have mixed feelings about these two free days.  I know we'll have to make them up later, and I really liked the days off we had set up for the year--there was at least one day off every month until summer.  Now... Who knows?  I know last year we had to go in for a day of our spring break because of weather issues earlier in the year.  That seriously sucked.  Hopefully that won't happen again this year.  We're supposed to be off next Monday for MLK day--maybe they'll take that one away.  We've been out enough for this month.  On a very similar but slightly different note, if stuff like this keeps up, I'm going to have to find a snow-themed icon for my posts...  Any suggestions?  ^.^  This HP one almost counts.  They have on scarves.  And I think there's some snow in the background.  But they look a little <i>too</i> concerned about my snow day perils, if you know what I mean."

No regular milk at all. There was actually quite a bit of bread left--I think they must have run the bread truck today.

We were so tiny we couldn't even hook up to the regular disembarkation tunnel--we had to climb down stairs and walk across the tarmac!  But don't worry--I'm not going to bore you with pages of soliloquizing on the joys of my 12 day Alaskan adventure.  Instead I'm going to condense my thoughts into sets of worth-ten-thousand-words-each pictures, starting with:  

<b>10 Scenic Images</b>
I have about five hundred pictures of mountains on my computer right now, not to mention a few hundred rivers, several dozen glaciers, and a not-small amount of flowers and various plant life.  I have condensed these down to the top ten.  Enjoy.

My plan is to pick the top ten of several types of pictures I took on the trip.  Above, of course, are the scenic pictures.  Next up is ""Wildlife.""  Doll sheep and mooses and wales--oh my!

"event","Okay, I am two-thirds of the way through with my latest project: A Supernatural CD.  As in, a CD for the CW tv series <i>Supernatural</i>, not a CD with the ability to spontaneously combust, or produce unlimited number of pink fluffy bunnies or anything.  Although that would be cool.  Maybe I'm working on the wrong project.

But I digress.  

Here's what I have so far: 

Carry on Wayward Son, Kansas
Highway to Hell, AC/DC
Heat of the Moment, Asia *--""No Asia?"" --""I know.  This station sucks.""*
Lonely is the Night, Billy Squire
Don't Fear the Reaper, Blue Oyster Cult
Green Onions, Booker T and the MG's
Long, Long Way From Home, Foreigner
House of the Rising Sun, Led Zepplin
Renegade, The Styx
Eye of the Tiger
Sympathy for the Devil, Rolling Stones
O Death, Jen Titus
White Rabbit, Jefferson Airplane
Supernatural Ending Credits 

I'm actually also including ""You Found Me,"" by the Fray and ""Gives You Hell,"" by All-American Rejects, because they remind me personally of Supernatural (for my own <strike>notreallythat</strike> convoluted reasons), but they were never played on the show, so I didn't include them on my master list.  But even with those two extras, I still need about twenty minutes worth of songs to fill up the cd.  Any ideas?  I've found several sites that list music from the show, such as this great website

http://www.tvshowmusic.com/shows/supernatural

that not only lists all the commercial music used on the show, but has a ""station"" that lets you listen to music from the show.  But I don't really know the names of songs, so I don't know which ones will be particularly memorable from the show.  I've about run out of steam looking up random songs.  Do any songs in particular remind you of Supernatural?  From the show or not, I'm not picky. 

I obviously plan to start the cd off with Carry on Wayward Son.  That's a given.  ^.^  And I'm ending it with the ending-credits music (the rock version, not the spooky, wispy version.)  But I'm not sure what order I'll do the rest of the songs.  I could do them chronologically based on when they were featured on the show, or set them up with fun bouncy songs together and sad songs together and hard rock songs together, etc.  Or I could just hit shuffle....  That's probably what I'll do, actually.....   

Anyway, just wanted to share my progress so far and ask for any tips anyone might have.  I use lightscribe to make covers for my burned cds and I put kind of a ridiculous amount of time into getting the images just right.  I'll post what I come up with for Supernatural once I finalize everything.  I already have covers made for Dr. Horrible, Doctor Who, Spam-A-Lot, Sweeney Todd, Chameleon Circuit, and Wicked, if anyone else uses lightscribe and is interested."

"event","Okay, at long last and after much internal debate, I've decided to put actual effort into working out how to use lj headers.  I've got a set of instructions to follow (we'll see how that goes...) and now I need a header.  I've found a couple of fairly descent ones, but nothing I'm really excited about, and I've had no luck using the lj search feature.  (Did they change that, btw?  I'm fairly certain you used to be able to search by communities only...Now it's ""users and communities.""  Not nearly as helpful.) 

Anyway, my question is, <b>does anyone know a good place to look for lj headers?</b>  Preferably Doctor Who or Harry Potter (maybe even Supernatural), although generic ones could work, too.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thankye kindly in advance."

"event","Last Saturday I watched <i>Titanic</i> for the first time.  This week at school, my ninth grade classes rounded out their <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> unit by watching the movie.  For the record, I have seen Leonardo Dicaprio die horribly seven times this week.

Sometimes <strike>notreallyveryoftenatall</strike> my students do things that make me feel like maybe I accidentally taught them something.  Today I had two of those moments.

<b>Actual good teaching moment #1:</b> I had them memorize a soliloquy and recite it last week.  Today, in almost every class, I could hear kids talking along to that scene in the movie. 


<b>Actual good teaching moment #2:</b>  At the end of the movie version random, insignificant (but completely adorable) side character Balthazar rides away from the Capel monument in Romeo's car to keep the cops off his tail.  In the play, he stays to <strike>take a nap</strike> watch over Romeo.  When we got to the end of the movie, kids were saying, ""Hey, Balthazar was supposed to stay with Romeo.""  They remembered a random plot detail that I didn't spend weeks cramming down their throats over and over again.  Amazing. 

I won't mention the disproportionately large number of students who didn't bother to memorize the first line of the soliloquy.  I also won't mention the fact that two of my six classes have failing averages overall.  I'll just hold on to my couple of good teaching moments and try to stay sane for another 8 days."

Set-up: 

Last Thursday--a student asked if they could leave a baseball bat in my closet for a couple of days so she didn't have to take it home on the bus.  I agreed. 

Today--I needed something out of my closet in another class.

           <b> Student: Why do you have a bat in your closet?

                Me:  It wouldn't fit in my belfry.

Squee!  My sister and I decided years ago that if we could magically create any video game we wanted, it would be Lego Harry Potter.  Apparently, our mind powers are exercised and up-to-par, because it comes out in 2010.  I've heard rumors that they might be making it for a while now, but this is the first definitive proof I've seen that it will actually be released.

"event","Halloween is over.  I may cry.  But, fortunatly, I have my wonderful Halloween-related memories neatly filed away to sustain me until next year's festivities.  They are as follows:

<b>File Topic #1: Pre-Halloween Festivities</b>

Kat (my sister) and I weren't going to get to spend Halloween together (mostly because I had selfish Birminham-related plans in which she could not participate) so we decided to get started early and have our joint-halloween celebrations a day early.  Kat planned to spend Halloween giving out candy with her friends at our town house, so we decided that we would run out and buy as many cheap, cheesy Halloween decorations as the Dollor Tree could provide and spend the night decorating and watching horror movies.  The Dollar Tree obliged and for about twenty bucks we were loaded down with as many badly formed plastic representations of the macarbre as we could carry and enough cheap candy to prevent sugar-addled children from egging our house. 

We had fun decorating--both outside and inside--and settled down to watch <i>The Shining</i>, which was as <strike>stressful</strike> wonderful as ever.  Then we put in <i>The Exorcist</i> and things went a bit pear shaped.  We noticed when we were renting it that the cover said ""The version you've never seen before,"" which did not seem to boad well to us.  We checked that it was the original version, not some strange re-make, and it was, so we shrugged and checked it out.  Unfortunatly, soon after we started the movie, we realized the tag line on the front had been a misprint.  What they really meant to say was, ""The Disgusting, Border-line Child Pornographic Version You Never Knew You Never Wanted to See Before.""  I've written them to inform them of their typing error.  *washes brain for the eleventh time with bleach and greased-lighting*  I will never watch ANY version of the Exorcist again for any reason.  Ever.  It is ruined.  *continues to scrub brain*

Tomorrow--File Topic #2: Halloween Day Festivities <i>wherein our hero dons official holiday-garb and goes forth into a world of sugar-overdosing and merry-making.</i>"

3.  The kitten left the mouse on my doorstep.  <b>(What, you don't remember Kitten?  she's my favorite companion.  Cudly, but capable of scratching your eyes out.  Everything you need in a companion.  ...well, plus two sets of high heels and a short little kitten skirt, I guess...)</b>

<b>Circle the indirect objects</b>

4.  Jo wrote her friend a note.

5.  Sarah took Romana and Adric to the movies. <b>(Now there's a formula for an awkward date.)</b>

"event","Okay, so I've been watching Doctor Who all my life.  I live and breath it.  I spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about it.  And then I have a totally obvious, why-didn't-I-realize-that-when-I-was-five moment like the one that hit me yesterday...

So, I was putting together a new entry for my <strike>unhealthy</strike> ""Doctor Who Companions Game"" yesterday, and instead of using Ace's <strike>dumb</strike> completely awsome nickname, I changed it to her actual name, Dorothy, to aviod having kids comment on the fact that the name <i>Ace</i> was on the board.  My first big realization was that the other character whose real name I always have to use rather than their nickname is Dodo, who's real name is Dorothea.  Apparently Dorthoy and variations thereon are not so much loved by their owners.  But this was not a huge, smack-myself-in-the-forehead-for-not-thinking-of-it-earlier realization.  Just kind of interesting.  My big realization was--

Ace's real name is Dorothy and she meets the Doctor because of a (self-inflicted) ""time-storm"" in her bedroom that whisks her to a magical land of ice and waitressing.  <b><i>Dorothy</i></b> carried by a <b><i>storm</i></b> to a <b><i>strange land</i></b>.  *headdesk*"

"event","Haha!  I have successfully completed stage one of the Companion Game.  Quick reminder for those playing along at home:

<u>The Rules</u>
Use the names of the Doctor's companions chronologically in grammar examples used in my 9th and 10th grade classes.

<u><b>Entry Six: Wherein I complete the first round of The Game.</b></u>

Identify the subjects, verbs, and complements in the following sentences.

1.  Dorothy ate a hamburger.  

<i>(note: I use Ace's real name to avoid endless disruptions.  If a fly landing on the window can cause pandemonium, imagine a name like ""Ace."" *sigh* I'd never hear the end of it.)</i>

2.  Rose wants a new job. 

<i>(I think I get points for staying in character on this one...not sure)</i>

3.  Martha watched us fishing.

4.  Donna appeared happy to be there.

<u><b>Entry Seven: Wherein the Game shows its eternal nature by looping right back around to the beginning.</b></u>

Circle the subject complement in each of the following sentences.  

1.  Susan and Barbara planned a trip north over the summer holidays. <i>(Because lots of planets have a north)</i>

2.  Ian looked very enthusiastic about his possibilities of winning.

3.  Vicki and Stephen performed a duet at the saloon yesterday. <i>(Double points for staying in character at the cost of mentioning a ""saloon.""  They serve teh alchohol, you know.  Ver' evil.  Corrupts teh childrens.)</i>

4.  Dorothea gave a speech to the class about the importance of driving safety. <i>Once again, names changed to protect <strike>me</strike> the innocent. The name Dodo just ain't gonna make it onto a test. I value my sanity too highly.</i>

<b><u>Entry Eight</u></b>

Identify the following sentences as complete (C) or incomplete (I).

5.  Ben and Polly worked together to thwart the evil alien invaders. <i>So went there.</i>

6.  To check and see if Jamie had made it safely away from the attacking yeti. <i>So made a return visit there.</i>

7.  I never knew if Victoria made it on time to the meeting. <i>So didn't bother going there a third time.</i>

<b>And there you have it.  I made quite a bit of progress this week.  All the way through four Doctors and almost through a fifth.  Ver' impressive, if I do mention it in passing myself.  Remember, there are prizes for answer the grammar questions correctly!--You don't have to answer all of them, just give one or two a try and I'll give you a prize.  And I have to say, this week is particularly easy.  Btw, As no one has actually responded to the Quotation Game, I think I'll discontinue it. Or maybe I should make it its own post--grammar tends to put people to sleep.  Maybe no one was making it that far. My students certainly wouldn't. ^.^ </b>"

Technically, the kids will see the names out of order, because the first set below will appear on their test tomorrow and the second set is their bell ringer for the day, but frankly, I don't think they're going to <strike>know anything about this whole, slightly clandestine, affair</strike> care. 

<u>Second Entry (Appearing on grammar tests everywhere tomorrow)</u>

Coordinating vs. Correlative Conjunctions. 
Identify the underlined conjunctions in the following sentences as coordinating or correlative.

____ 9.  Both Viki and Stephen saw the play.
      a.	 coordinating
      b.	 correlative

____ 10.  Dorothy and Polly went to the game together and had a great time.
      a. coordinating
      b. correlative

____ 12.  Either Ben or Jamey would gladly see the play again.
      a. coordinating
      b. correlative

(no points this time for making the sentences fit the characters....)

<u>Third Entry</u>

Identify the part of speech for all of the following words.

1.  Jo and Sarah are best friends.

(which also receives no points for fitting the characters...oh well, I'll do better next week.)

<b>Remember, you can play along at home--test your grammar skills!  I'll be happy to get out the red pen and let you know all the things you did wrong.  I get a lot of practice at that. ^.^ </b>

For the Who fans out there who hate grammar with the same fiery passion that I did until I actually started teaching it, I have below a secondary game.  <i>Identify that Quote!</i>, the quotation sensation that's sweeping the nation.  

Identify the character and episode from which the following quote was taken.  First to answer correctly gets a special <strike>slightly lame</strike> prize!

""If nothing else, it's good for my teeth.""

The lady on the other end tells me she's from ""Branson Vacations"" and asks if I remember filling out a sheet for a chance to win a free week-long vacation to Branson.  It took me a minute, but then I recalled stopping for lunch in Arkansas on our way back from Seattle and seeing a little box for chances to win a vacation to Branson.  I only filled it out because Mom had wanted to go to Branson on our trip and we didn't have time.  I thought, ""oh, wouldn't it be funny if we won a free vacation and she got to go after all.""....

Most intelligent readers will have postulated where this story is going.

<b>I won a free week long vacation for four to Branson, MO with four nights worth of free tickets to shows, breakfast every morning, and a choice of five luxury hotels!</b>  And the tickets are good for 18 months.  Oh!--also, I get a second vacation that I can send away for after I take the first one.  Not sure about the details on that one.  It might just be discounted or something. (wouldn't that be a tragedy?) They're sending me a packet with all the information.  Yeah, so, wow.  I've never won anything before.  I still can't quite believe it.  Free trip to Branson.  *dies*"

We got a little lost coming into town, but we could see the space needle and just kept heading toward it.  It cost us 27 dollars to park! It hurt a little bit, but it was really near the space needle, so that was good.  We went up and saw the city, and sat at a little table and drank coffee.  It was very pleasant.  Then we went to the science fiction museum which is literally right next to the space needle.  It was great.  We dorked it up real good.  There was only one Doctor Who reference, which was sad, but I got a picture of the captain's chair from the first star trek and saw lots of fun stuff.  We also rode the monorail.  We didn't have time to visit the Seattle Underground, but we plan to do it tomorrow on the way out of town.  We should see Forks tomorrow and officially make it as far west as we possibly can.  I guess that means we'll have to turn around.  It'll be weird to see ""east-bound"" on the interstate signs instead of ""west-bound."""

*Drove and drove for several days to get to North Dakota
*Saw the ""Enchanted Highway"" in North Dakota that has fun metal sculptures along the road that you can take pictures with--very cute.
*Saw Mount Rushmore (for the second time).  It was still cool.
*Went down ten flights worth of stairs to check out a cave in South Dakota.  Then had to come back up.  x.x
*Drove across Yellow Stone National Park.  Took too many pictures.  Saw Old Faithful--was fairly faithful.
*Saw a lot of Montana and a little bit of Idaho (the top section).
*Made it to Washington.
*Should be in Seattle tomorrow.

Lots of fun, lots of driving.  I'm glad to be here, but I think I'm also glad to be turning around in a day or two.  Hotel rooms get old.

Should mail some postcards tomorrow.  I haven't been as good about that as I meant to be...Oh well.  Hopefully I can update again tomorrow.  We're planning to visit the Seattle underground, the Space Needle, the Science Fiction Museum, and anything else we can find to do.  And then we're (don't laugh) going to Forks.  As in, <i>Twilight</i> Forks.  I said don't laugh.  I can hear you, you know.  Kat really likes <i>Twilight</i> and the books didn't totally offend me so, since we'll be so close anyway, we decided to go check it out.  It'll be a laugh, anyway."

"event","Today's day two of our drive to Seattle.  Yesterday we didn't have much fun--just tried to put as much distance between ourselves and Alabama as possible.  My aunt and uncle live in Arkansas and said we could stay with them, so we drove about eleven hours trying to make it to their house. We had an adventure finding what will eventually be I-40, but for now is mysteriously named Corridor X in Birmingham.  It's not technically finished so they don't have a lot of signs up for it and we went through some very interesting country before stumbling onto it, but hey, you see the best stuff when you're lost, anyway.  We eventually found Corridor X (sounds like something out of a fifties sci-fi movie to me) and drove across Alabama and through the corner of Mississippi and up through Memphis, then to Farmington, which is at the top of Arkansas.  It was a very long trip, but we had fun talking to each other and making fun of place names along the way.  We saw a ""Carslile"" and had a lot of fun with that one.  We got to my aunt's at about 11:00 and were very glad to go to sleep.

Today was a lot more fun.  My aunt took us to Eureka Springs, which is a little town built in the late 1800s literally into the side of a mountain.  All the houses are built into the mountain sides and there are lots of really fun touristy shops to visit.  But best of all was the Crescent Moon Hotel.  It's really pretty with some great views and fun architecture from around the 1880s I think.  I didn't know until we got there that the Ghost Hunters had been there.  That's where they caught that footage of the army man with the red spot on his arm where he had been shot.  I really want to go back and stay in the hotel and see more of the town.  They had trains you could ride and carriage tours and all kinds of things to do.  Oh, and some kind of cave--I think it was called the Crystal Cave.  It sounded really fun.  Note to self: return to Eureka Springs.

We're going to spend another night at my aunt's and set out again tomorrow.  Omaha is our next planned destination. My plan is to post every night and tell of my wondrous adventures, but I don't know how realistic a plan it is.  I brought my lap top with me, but I don't know if I'll actually be able to get on the internet with it.  It has wireless capabilities, but I've never really messed with it anywhere but my house before.  I should find out tomorrow if it's going to work or not.  If not, they might have a public computer at the hotel I can use.  I know everyone's just on tender-hooks waiting to hear of my next adventure.  I'll try not to let you  down.  ^.^  

If people want post cards give me your address and I'll be glad to send them!

<3 from the road,

"event","No word on the visa so far......... Every day that passes is going to make it that much more awkward if the answer is ""yes, you can work in England,"" and I have to quit the teaching job I have now.  Technically, I should have let them know before school ended that I would be leaving.  Of course, I wasn't going to quit one job before getting another, and it looks like cautious was the way to go, since the visa people suck and apparently hate me. (And if you hate me, you hate teachers, and if you hate teachers you hate education, and if you hate education you hate children.  Do you really hate children visa people? Do you really? For shame.)  This week was especially depressing, because I spent a <strike>miserable</strike> week at cheerleader camp, training to take over the JV cheerleader squad at a school I thought I wouldn't even be teaching at next year.  Cheerleader sponsor.  Me.  Do you hear the universe laughing?  Because I do.  

So, anyway, long story short, I'm super stressed and depressed.  I picture the visa coming through and having to call up my principal and tell him he has a month to find a new English teacher.  Not good.  Everyone at that school has been so good to me, and they don't deserve that kind of unprofessional behavior.  Of course, then I picture the visa not coming through and see myself wasting another year of my life treading water and waiting for my life to get started.  Oh, and sponsoring JV cheerleaders.  That's a definite perk.  I hate to check my e-mail because I'm scared of what I'll find there and my heart skips a beat every time the phone rings.  I'm a mess.  Something needs to happen, because I've stressed long enough.  But at the same time, I'm scared of the answer--either way it goes.  This whole thing has just been a huge horrible experience.  Oh, did I mention I've actually signed a contract for a job in England?  It's in Norwich, which is one of, if not the oldest town in England and is perfect in every way.  They've hired me.  They love me.  They're excited to have me.  Will they get me?  *sigh* Who knows.  Whatever.  I don't even care anymore.  Bring on the cheerleaders, universe.  Enjoy your laugh.  I hope it's worth the ulcer developing in the pit of my stomach."

"event","Sooo....yesterday was our last full day of school.  The kids had been reviewing for their final for over a week.  I could literally not make myself say the words, ""the subject of a sentence can never be in a prepositional phrase"" one more time.  And I'm pretty sure they couldn't have stood to hear it one more time--even if they weren't actually listening.  So, what did I do?  Well, of course, I <b>showed them an episode of Doctor Who</b>.  Really, I had no choice. Class wasn't long enough to watch a whole movie.  Honestly, what else could I do?

My first class <strike>was subjected to</strike> had the honor of viewing ""Blink.""  Some of them were pretty into it, but honestly, most of them were bored.  I didn't really expect that class to enjoy it much though.  There was no blood or gore or anything, so I don't think they really got the point.  The next class, however, <strike>was subjected to</strike> got to watch ""Midnight.""  They already had an idea of the plot cause I used it as a ridiculously long example for one of their vocabulary words (""mimic""), and they were excited about getting to see it--just telling them the story in class had freaked some of them out.  They were totally into it and actually groaned when the bell rang before it was over.  I had to promise they could finish watching it after they were through with their final today.  It made my Whovian heart proud.  Someone had a wallet stolen right before my last class, though, and the confusion/vice-principal's visit/commotion wasn't over until there was hardly any time left in class, so I didn't get to show them an episode--which made me sad. They're my best class and they were really excited when I told them we were going to watch it.  I think they really would have enjoyed it.  Maybe there'll be time to watch at least some of it after their final.

Countdown to Summer: 2 half days.  woot!"

"event","Okay, so for many years now I have dreamed of learning to make music videos using clips from my favorite shows.  I love watching ones other people have made and literally every time I listen to a song, I'm trying to figure out which show would work for it and which clips I would use if I made a music video.  But the computer I was using up until a couple of weeks ago could not (in any universe) handle anything so fancy.  But now, I has job which pays monies and allows teh purchase of shinies so of course, I went straight for a new laptop with way more power and memory than I could ever possibly need.  The moral of this incredibly long and convoluted <strike>and unnecessary</strike> back-story is that I now have the memory and software necessary to make a music video.  And I have the song.  And I have the show that I want to make it for on dvd.  Now the snag(s).....

<b>How exactly do you get the show from the dvd onto the computer? </b> I know it's possible.  People have been making these music video things for a long time and they've only just lately (as far as I know) started putting out digital copies of shows for people to buy.  If anyone knows anything about this (or making music videos in general) please help a sista' out.  

Also--<b>What movie-playing program can I download that will allow me to make screen caps?</b> I had a movie player on my old computer that would let me, but neither of the movie-players on this new computer (""Window's Media Player"" and ""Media Smart"") will let me.  

Any help/info would be greatly appreciated!

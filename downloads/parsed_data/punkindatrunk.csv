I seem to be moving along quite nicely. 
I have a job...McDonalds
I have my permit
I have a prom date..Stubs...we are going as friends
Im getting my braces off in four days..fingers crossed
I got a ferret
I have a college plan

Then I stop and think. Man how insatable am I? I am absolutely ecstatic that I have all these great things going for me, My grades are all pretty low but at least im not failing, and i have been struggling all year. Now I never said that i couldn't live without a man, but jesus do i miss all those hugs and kisses i used to get whenever i saw my otherwise absent boyfriend those nine months. I don't know if i miss him or just the idea.
I bet you ten dollars that its not him that I miss, but ya know some times the lines blur.  

I think i just want the idea of the boyfriend who is there...
LOOSER!

cheers"

"event","Yeah,  Its been a while nothing important is happening. Prom is in three months, no one has asked me except justine asked me to take ben if she couldn't, and stubbs asked me to go with him if lyndsey says yes to matt also, i think matt might ask me if lyndsey says yes to stubbs. I don't want to be a fill in, or a reenforcement date. Maybe i should just ask  my matt to go to a movie with me that night, It would be cheaper. 

I love my stepmom she is so sweet and she loves me so much............. :)  My Debby loves me

haha I'm gonna leave that in, my wonderful stepmommy just wrote that while i was turning on the kerosene heater. Why am I turning on the Kerosene heater? Beacause after a week of beautiful weather it decided to snow today...TWICE! goddamnit! haha.Oh well :) 

I have a sneaky snake, today i played with my sneaky snake, I stuck her in my bathrobe, which i was wearing over my school clothes so she could stay warm and next thing i know, three feet of her is wrapped up in the newspaper lying next to me, and the other two is wrapped up in the couch!
Nadine is coming over this weekend, and I am going to see The Passion of The Christ with Debbie S, and Sarah W...i think someone else well, two someone elses are going, but i don't know who these two are.... last friday we were all supposed to go, but the film broke before the previews were over.maybe its a sign from god!Yeah right, god, i wonder what crackhead came up with that theory. *lighning bolt* okay maybe not..haha just kidding. 


well movies on..the 7year itch...i love Marilyn Monroe....I love channel 54 all those old ones hehe

Perhaps another day
will wind its tired way goodbye,
before you learn to say
the what, the when, the why.

is it considered bad for me
to walk a weary mile
out of the way for me to see 
a stranger's simple smile?

beauty in a simple right
glitter o'er all,
with majestic simple light 
beauty large, is beauty small.

just remind those ones to wait
to listen to the silent sound
to chance it all to fate
two people that each other found

if it's taken all away 
without a way to warn
ill be sure to stay
where to go when love is torn?

torture in my shallow mind where her shining face
is the only place to find 
us together in that place

sorrow is that melody whit lyrics left to spare
no beauty there is left to see
nothing shining nothing fair

attempt another day
to find that lonely place
theres got to be another way
to chance upon that smiling face

Another time for me 
confusion lends its tricky hand
to go and try to see
a stranger in a stranger land

blackest night may be short of stature
yet smile a shining grin
with hair and eyes of burning copper
is desire sin?

delving deep within my soul
remind my tawny eyes to wait
the green and blue may mingle whole
to amber colored state

oh tell the tale of darkened planes with clouds of copper grey
wish distant lightning visionary that shed electric all the day
yes tell us all of dust scraped lands, with rusted ancient metal view
and never silent weather veins squeak odd melodic just for you


See THIS!!?? That's from a friend of mine, who rocks very much. Some people who are very boring think that they can get me to like them by just being charming. Well its not that simple, you must also be endearing, sincere, and intelligent above all else. 
Love

coming soon, a poem in response. sort of. yeah

I bought gifts n stuff
I deleted all my old entries because I kept getting crap for them from people that i thought i was friends with, and for me, I'd rather just eliminate the problem than listen to a bunch of retards whine at me. So i deleted the old entries and dropped the loosers who can't deal with other peoples opinions. I'm only 16 I don't have to deal with fake friends just yet. I'll save that for when I get famous.

there is my retarded assumption for the week. I didn't actually write it because most retarded assumptions  can get you into trouble. I'm still learning to censor myself.

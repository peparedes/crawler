"event","So I guess a lot has happened since I last wrote.  But it feels like nothing much has happened.  I feel like I've always been here.  Everyone's been really nice.  I'm making some really good friends and some pretty interesting art.  I got to make silverwear this week.  It's cool stuff.  I still feel kind of alone sometimes...but I think it's fading.  My friend Julie says someday, I'll have an epiphany and just be over everything, and be a whole new me.  I hope it works that way.  I don't know if I need a whole new me.  I miss the farm and I miss cello...I didn't make the orchestra :(  I miss my friends...Nava's coming to see me tomorrow - yay :)  I see mom a lot...but not Dad so much.  It feels pretty normal.  I guess it's become routine, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.  One good thing though, I saw stargazer lily last week with dad.  We were on a guest list so we got in for free.  Susan the lead singer remembered me and wrote me a little note on my cd...talked to me a bit and let me follow her around.  I was so happy.  That kind of thing makes me feel so important - makes me smile.  Anyway, I guess that's it for now.  Progress, I suppose."

"event","Hey, so...I'm in college now.  Yay :)  Me and Caitlin had no trouble moving in and unpacking, and our beds are very tall because we've brought our matresses from home.  Our room is verging on pretty, it's well decorated, at least.  We're meeting lots of new people, everyone's friendly and doors are open all over the dorm.  We are on one of the only coed floors, which is cool, in my opinion.  Also, we seem to be living with lots of sophomores.  Still, it's comfy and generally advantageous.   Today's orientation was horribly boring.  Oh well.  Also, one of the administrator guys is just enough like Dr. Pavel to be unnerving.  Ick.  Maggie moved into today and Caitlin and I have been chilling with her some so that she can adjust to her somewhat withdrawn (very opposite) room mate.  She's doing alright though.  The food is actually not that bad, but because of scheduling the cafeteria closes at weird hours (for example, dinner ended at six).  It's all good though, cuz we've stocked our fridge, and just now a nice sophomore guy gave me some pizza.  He's conveniently very cute too.  I think I'll like these art school types.  Caitlin's been a little nervous and stressed and ill, but I think she'll adjust alright in the end.  I'm still waiting on my own computer, email and phone.  I'm buying a computer after my graphics class, I guess until then (next week, probably) i'll just use Caitlins.  That about covers it for now...oh yeah!  Orchestra auditions are Tuesday, and they already have 14 cello music majors...oh no!  It'll all work out....i hope....maybe.  So long :)"

"event","Ok, let me post my lovely schedule.

Thursday:  Work

Friday:  Take cat to vet, work, GOAT FACTORY SHOW (yay :) all of two five nine and Jeremy will be seen)

Saturday:  Begin house sitting (possibly) for Ben and Eva who have a pool, go to the farm

Sunday:  Go see ""Into the Woods"" on Broadway with Ivan, who invited me kinda last minute, but might I add, YAY!!!!  very exciting.

Monday - Wednesday:  Work, house sitting (various guests, to include Becca, Jeremy, Nava, Karen, Amelia, My Dad, whoever else ends up coming)

Thursday:  Free tix (acquired from rich customer at community audio who couldn't use them because of a business trip) for the Cake concert, will take Amelia

Friday through the 29th:  More house sitting, more working, more farm.  Then, move in to school :)  yay.  

Thus, my summer will end with a proverbial bang.  Smile.  All is well.  Can hardly wait.  Good times.  
In other news, my dad's new tenant is really hot.  I wouldn't normally say that, but damn.  
Also, I'm a little upset that my boss occasionally makes sexual remarks towards me.  He tells me he means nothing by it, but that doesn't make it much better.  I know he would never act on it, but it kinda makes me rather uncomfortable.  I confronted him today, so it will stop.  Or I will be forced to find other means of employment.  But I sincerely doubt it will continue to be an issue.  I have no idea why I am writing this here.  Oh well...the world may never know."

"event","For once I feel all smily for no reason.  It's refreshing.  Anyway, I'm on a hiatus from my regular journal and attempting not to overanalyze life for a bit.  I think it lets me be more creative, and my dreams get really weird when I've got more psychological stuff that's unresolved.  So, in my mind that's a double positive.  However, I do have lots of trouble falling asleep.  I don't know.  I feel like this is what my life is supposed to be like.  And I think that's a nice change of pace.  
So what's new?  Let's see.  Mike said he'd call last week after we had a somewhat awkward IM convo.  He hasn't...how Jeremy of him.  Jeremy on the other hand has been on good behavior.  I went to see him on Friday.  He bought me some pizza for lunch.  We watched a movie and headed for Dorney Park.  A nice mini adventure.  However, after he drove for an hour and we paid 15$ a piece for tickets we only got to go on two rides.  Then it started thundering and there was tons of rain.  I got cold so we sat in the van for a while.  After about a half an hour we gave up and just went home.  The moment we pulled into his driveway the power went out.  It felt majorly like someone was mocking us.  So we lit some candles, I took a shower, ate some food.  We played scrabble...yes, we were that bored.  I mean, it was like nine, neither of us were going to bed then.  We watched some TV...some Buffy, of course...there's rarely a time when that doesn't happen :).  Eventually we went to bed in his brother's room.  That bed was large and comfy, except for the fact that it slanted dowards.   What's the deal with that?  That made it much less comfortable.  Anyway,  I woke up early ish the next morning, ate some pizza, waited for him to get up.  Eventually he did, we just lazed around til lunch and eventually I headed home.  I can't have as much fun doing nothing with anyone else.  There was much complimenting and much making me smile and be happy.  I need that right now.  That's good for me.  The fear of pain and abandonment is subsiding, slowly but surely.  Still, trust is a major issue.
Other than that, I just got payed 15$ an hour for going to King of Prussia with my boss to buy stuff for the new van at work.   That's what I'll be doing all week...working and such.  And on friday Nava and I (and possibly Jeremy?)  will go to Doug's party.  Then on Saturday my first Dar Williams concert - yay :)  It's gonna be a good week.  Oh i am so damn optimistic, wow"

"event","You know, I feel thoroughly cheated by society and teen movies.  I feel like there was some sort of claim that the summer between high school and college is supposed to be crazy and exciting.  One is supposed to have flings and go on road trips and travel and find oneself.  You know, for me and those that I know it really hasn't been that way at all.  It's all about sitting around the house, or getting a job.  Maybe even a family vacation or two gets thrown in.  It doesn't feel all wild and crazy.  In fact it kind of sucks.  I can feel old friendships slipping away...and new ones seem very distant.  I remember we'd promised to keep in touch...but it won't happen.  I guess I'm just still letting go is all.  I am going to miss some people horribly - more than they can know...and I guess I really don't like that it's already starting.  I mean, nothing much has changed.  We're still all here, at least for about a month (I move in in exactly one month and five days).  Still...without school as an excuse to get together, we are divided by location and lack of bonds.  It makes me lonely.
In other news, there was a brief stint of conversation at the farm that made me think more about my relationships and such.  It was between Lou and David discussing an ex-boyfriend of Lou's.  She mused at what he was doing now, and then proclaimed him an asshole.  In the next moment she said how much she missed him.  David pointed out that the two things are not at all mutually exclusive.  I think that's basically how I feel about Jeremy.  He still won't return my calls...and after everything he still makes me feel like I don't matter.  So why can't I hate him?  And moreover, why don't I really want to?  Anyway, I've also decided that I'm using Mike and I need to stop because that's just unfair and generally mean.  I hate feeling used and I refuse to do it do another person.  Still, I can't quite bring myself to say this to him...but I will, have faith...perhaps I just need to give it a little more time"

"event","Take it from me ladies and gentlemen, I lost 6 pounds in 4 days!  And I'll guarantee that you can too!  It's simple, with just a little help from a little friend I like to call streptococcal bacteria.  This little helper will totally inflame your tonsils and cause them to swell to roughly the size of golfballs.  In this way our little buddy strep forces us not to swallow any solid foods...isn't that amazing!  Therefore, we are left with a highly limited diet of basically ice cream, yogurt, popsicles and applesauce.  Thus, the weight just seems to melt away.  Yes, ladies and gentleman, it's as easy as that!  Without treatment with harsh antibiotics, our little friend strep can last up to seven days, and may occur as often as once a month.  Just think...a cheap and easy way to slim down...finally, you can look great, because you owe it to yourself.  So go for it!  The swimsuit season is almost over! *

It is so not fair to be sick on the weekend during summer.  What's the freaking point?"

"event","You know, in all my boredom over the past few days, I began to realize that it's become rather pointless to write anything here.  I mean, no one seems to read it...although, I must admit I have been following certain journals without ever writing a comment in them.  I wonder if anyone who is not me or Diana has ever read any of this...I doubt it...it's so boring!  And while I am mostly just writing to write, sometimes I'd like an outside opinion reflected on an issue or comment.  The past three days have given me lots of time to think...to consider my options.  Especially as far as relationships go.  Still, I can't decide what I want.  I feel addicted to Jeremy...and I think I still want him, even though he has hurt me in unmentionable ways in the past.  I mean really...like...traumatic, i'll-need-therapy pain... but still, I can forgive almost anything.  And then there's Mike, who of late, has been bad with the following up, calling back, and arranging to do things.  However, for most of our time together, he has been prompt and pretty much perfect.  I think that scares me...I mean, because no one can really be perfect, so that tends to make me think that if they seem that way they are simply hiding faults...possibly deeper and darker ones.  So anyway, I think Mike's perfection scares me...he's just so cute, and so nice...and all my friends like him.  I just sometimes feel like I'm making excuses to stay with him.  He fits me so well...I don't know what to do.  I mean, isn't it unfair to him to be with him if I still have (strong, almost overwhelming) feelings for Jeremy?  Do I really want to be with Jeremy, no matter how much I care about him, if I can't trust him?  If he will hurt me again?  And then I got bored, and I called the guy that left the somewhat suggestive quote in my yearbook...but nothing has come of that yet, and maybe nothing will.  Okay, so this entry is really just me complaining about relationships...I should be happy that I care about so many people and that anyone likes me in the first place.  I mean, it's not like that's happened much in the past...I'm still new at this whole recipricated feelings thing...and while in some ways it's easier than unrequited, it is infinitely more complicated.  Instead of just worrying about myself being rejected or hurt, I in turn must be considerate of those who care about me, and must try not to hurt them.  It's all very diplomatic really.  I'm just lucky to have all these people in my life...but I'm not lucky because I lack the experience to deal with it all....I guess this will become my experience...I just hope that whatever I decide, I don't end up hurting people, and they don't end up hurting me.  Does this make sense to anyone?  Does anyone care at all?  Fucking hormones...I'll blame them as long as possible."

"event","So the past week was lots of fun...thanks to everyone who contributed to my experiences.  Let us start on Thursday, the fourth of July.  I had family here from all over - Washington DC...Switzerland... The fourth is my little bro's birthday.  I slept in, was all sociable, and did the whole family birthday party thing.  I had arranged to visit Jeremy, but had to push it back until after that.  Mon petit frere loved his gifts, including mine (the Star Wars version of the game Life - ""A Jedi's Journey""  or something like that).  Then everyone left to go swimming and  I threw some stuff in a bag and headed to the NEast...I wonder if that's how that should be spelled...anyone from Northeast Philadelphia who is reading this and would like to voice an opinion, it would be greatly appreciated.  Anyhow, I arrived to the greetings of Jeremy's friends, and he came down briefly in a towel, just before he showered.  It was rather awkward.  But then we watched some DVDS on a really big monitor he had borrowed from his job.  Eventually the friends left and we had some time to talk.  Mostly I talked - told him what he needed to do if he wanted to be my friend, or anything else.  He seemed to want to do just that...I hope he follows through.  He shaved - thank goodness....the beard thing was getting scary.  Anyway, we ate some leftover tacos, and went to get ice cream.  Then we went to watch the local fireworks.  They weren't bad...but certainly nothing out of the ordinary.  Next we headed home...relaxed...more movie watching.  More talking.  Then he decided to show me the private pool which is behind his back yard.  We decided to hop the fence and go swimming.  I got so hurt climbing the fence, my butt got all scratched when I was trying to jump down...I also got stung by a bee, or possibly a hornet, which caused my hand to swell up.  Other than that it was very teen movie...and more than a little romantic...I'm not sure if that's a good thing.  Anyway, we stayed up for a while after swimming, Jeremy did the things that he does best,  he never failed to make me smile and laugh... and was on his best behavior.  It made me miss the way things were so much.  I felt myself giving in when I really shouldn't.  I wish it didn't make me so happy - it would be much simpler that way.  But at the same time, it does make me happy...so...it just ends up confusing me.  I felt weird sleeping in his parents' bed.  Oh well.  I came home again, and went to work.  Bill tried to teach me stuff, but I was too tired, I don't think I absorbed any of it.  I came home, freshened up a bit, and went to get Nava.  Back to the NEast for Melissa's surprise birthday party.  It wouldn't have been fun, except that Melissa was so happy.  Her joy made it fun for everyone.  I think she enjoyed my gift...it was a bag with stuff for college in it and a long explanation.  Afterwards, Nava, Karen and I were going to chill in the NEast with friends of Karen for a while.  She started calling people, and then Dave Koch called her.  He has a beach house in a little town outside of Atlantic City - it's called Brigantine.  We decided to go, right then and there.  We stopped at Karen's house to borrow swimsuits....then we were off.  Approximately 1.5 hours later we arrived, and met Dave and friends and parents.  The friends explained that the cops were psycho there, and that they had been pulled over twice in ten minutes.  Somebody made the highly applicable comment, ""It was like they thought we were black or something, ""  because here in Philly, and esp. in the suburbs you only get pulled over for no reason if you are black....ah racial profiling...and who says this country hasn't come a long way since the days of segregation ? Anyhow, we got some food and chilled for about an hour, then we slept.  I woke up early and hit the beach with  Dave.  It was so lovely, swimming was really cold, but it made me happy none-the-less.  Dave let me borrow his ocean kayak...I kind of sucked, but it was still fun.  After a little more swimming and resting, I decided we ought to head back.  We showered, grabbed some lunch at a local sandwich place, after much searching for parking.  We noticed that my car was leaking fluids, I suspect that was because I had just added some coolant  and not put the top on correctly.  Anyhow, it was then that I began to worry that it might overheat.  It made it all the way to Philadelphia and on to Kelly Drive without dying, but then it finally hit the red.   I was somewhat accosted at a gas station by a begging guy while I let it cool down.  Eventually the guage went down a little, so we decided to try and make it home.  Finally, it just stalled out and wouldn't start right on Henry Ave.  We put up the hood and let it cool, and made a sign out of part of a box in the trunk.  I removed everything of value.  We used the rest of the box as sort of a buffer for oncoming traffic.  It was kind of amusing to watch drivers' reactions to a box in the road.  Most took the hint and went around the box, thus avoiding my car, which was about 40 feet in front of it.  Some people sort of stopped their cars and had stand offs with the box...one woman sort of ran it over and honked at it...another decided to go around it, and actually waited behind my car for several minutes before she noticed the smoke pouring from the front of the raised hood.  2 giant SUVs ran over the box just to prove that they could.   One man suggested that we move it.  My mom came to our rescue and called  AAA, who towed the car to my Dad's repair place... of course they won't be opened til tomorrow, but at least it's there.  I hope it's not destroyed, but Mom and Peter actually told me I can have Bev (their second car) in a matter of weeks - as soon as Peter goes back to work (he's had hip surgery recently).  I just decided to be dropped off at Nava's.  Karen got sick and left early, along with a slew of other people.  I drank hard raspberry lemonade, and fell asleep while watching Fight Club with Amelia and Nava.  Mike ended up having to work both today and yesterday evening, so we couldn't do anything :(  He's been working a lot lately.  He was supposed to call me several times and he hasn't.  I spent all day calling people, it was kind of interesting.  I really didn't do anything today.  I did practice though...I guess that's something.  Every time I see that gatorade commercial with the first Bach suite I realize how much I ought to practice.  Although I'm pissed that it's used as a commercial, it is somewhat motivational.  So tonight I am bored, I guess I'll just leave it at that.  But look, something interesting happened to me :"

"event","Yeah, I guess you could say that.  On the 20th of June I graduated high school...and might I be the first to say WOOO HOO!!!!!!! I thought I would be sad at some point, or at least a little nostalgic...but no, I was ecstatic...I had a glued on smile all the way through.  I think just the idea that it was finally over, that I had made it, all that just made me so happy.  Also, I felt like all at once I could let go of the bad stuff and retain all the good stuff, and it just gave me this elated feeling....like everything had turned out for the best.   So after I played my last marathon length pomp and circumstance...after I gathered my award for most original work of art....after the pictures, the hugs, the smiles....in short, after all was said and done, it was just over.  I went out to dinner with my parents...my gut felt a little heavy, but it didn't really sink in...somehow I wasn't going to see my classmates on Monday...no more Dr. Pavel...it was just over.  I went to 4 graduation parties since then, but I must say they were a bit lackluster...I hope I can keep in touch with everyone, I'd really like to.  I know some people have left, but others are still around, most are working a lot, and are as bored as me.  In other news, I've been seeing Mike a fair amount, he calls me when he's supposed to, and he kisses me and makes me smile...still, although we're headed towards a relationship, I think I've got some risidual feelings to take care of... I tried to do just that...Jeremy came to my house, I told him that it would be the last time he'd see me in a more than friend kind of way...his face just dropped.  I was sad too, because I just felt like it was reopening all kinds of wounds.  He left and we said goodbye - there's something new.  Still, I'm toying with calling him up, I kind of feel like he could change, and I really don't want to be away from him again.  Our friendship is pretty screwed at this point anyway, but I miss that more than anything.  I think I may make some demands, and see where it gets me.  I have begun to miss the friends I haven't seen, and the acquaintences I know I won't see, even if I'd like to.  I've been working a lot, and even managed to make about 400$ (not bad for 2 weeks).  This weekend we made hay at the farm.  It wasn't too bad - at least this year the Or-and-me dynamic was much more manageable...he seemed kind of subdued, I think it's cuz he just broke up with his g/f.  Liz was there, and she's doing very well.  The hot hay farmer got kind of chubby, that was upsetting - I guess it was the freshman 15, but perchance it was knocked up to about 30.  Whatever it was, it was no good...I mean, what good is stacking hay if I don't get to watch him do it (shirtless)?  I guess that about covers my life at the moment, I'll let you know if anything interesting happens...although I guess nothing interesting really happens to me...oh well.  So long"

"event","Hey journal...sorry it's been a while.  Lots of stuff is going on right now.  The sixth was prom...it was actually a really fun time :)  Everyone liked my date, and he brought me lovely flowers.  His name is Mike, he's Or's room mate.  He even waited outside in the rain, so I didn't have to get out when I picked him up.  He found topics of interest for all my friends, esp Nava - vegetarianism...and Pricille - business major-ness at Drexel.  We danced non stop, unless I had to sit down or wanted to dance with other people, it was pretty great.  He even breakdanced in front of everyone and was really good at it too.  He was very polite and enthusiastic, and our pictures came out well.  Afterwards me and like everyone and their mom went to Little Pete's...it was a good time.  Tim Johnson was there which made my evening complete because I had really wanted to get back in touch with him.  It was fun...milkshakes etc.  Then I took him back to my Dad's house (which I figure my parents don't really need to know)  and he slept in my dad's bed...we went to bed at like 4:30.  Another good thing - he really likes to rub feet...score!  The next day we just lied around the house eating ice cream and watching TV, then I took him home and went out to Zocalo with Nava, Abby, Caitlin and Amelia.  We all went out to the movies and ended up driving home illegally past curfew...I ran red lights accidentally while Nava had a fair amount of pot in her bag...oh we are such rebels...I was so scared I was going to get arrested.  That weekend I went down to see my sis and my new nephew Nathaniel.  He had jaundice, but everyone down there is well.  My sis had a really easy labor...she got an epidural (how is that spelled?)  and it only took about 2 hours.  We have pictures of her smiling just before and after birth...it seems bizarre.  Then we had school...blah blah....boring.  Last weekend I went to DC to see my cousin Louie and my other family, esp. my Grandma.  They were here from the West Coast for this history contest thing.  My cousin won 7th in the country for his video about Steve Allen.  He deserved it, it was amazing!  This week was soo boring til wednesday.  I worked a lot.  Then I went swimming with Mike, it was soo hot, I was soo happy he had a pool to go to.  He'll be a lifeguard over the summer, so I'll expect him to hook me up :) He's so much fun.  Yesterday was the senior picnic, it was kind of cold, but they had a heated pool...soooo nice....the food sucked.  I mostly chilled with Amelia, I nearly killed myself playing mini golf.  You know, it was also suprisingly un-sucky.  :)  So I guess I've been having lots of fun :)  Today was move up day and I got my yearbook, which a certain someone signed with a possible hint that he likes me in a more than friend sort of way...I'm going to meditate on it and then decide on a course of action.  It was interesting.  I got to play the horn during move up day...good times.  The yearbook is suprisingly unugly...also, I signed a crazy number of them, and today 29 people signed mine...I didn't even realize I knew that many people, much less that I liked that many, but apparently I do, because I know and like them all.  That seems redundant.  Anyway, that's plenty enough news, and I'm sick of typing.  So long for now"

Also, finals will be over after this week so I'll have more time to waste here.  I'm having fun in art a lot, now that AP testing is over...such a load off.  I can't wait...perhaps I should be getting all nostalgic...meh. That's overrated...if anything, I care less now than I ever have before.  It seems somewhat anti-climactic (is that spelled right?)  Diana is gone and the farm is weird without her...she leaves some kind of void...my other half.  It makes me feel lonely...which has been a growing thing this year, generally not because of her, but rather because of my disconnectedness with everyone.  This weekend was nice...student union retreat, saw my horses (poor Be has a puncture wound, but it's healing nicely...I  could walk him bareback at least), and went shoe shopping with my prom date mike.  He said he would buzz his hair -yesss, i must say I adore buzz cuts....also, he thoroughly enjoyed shoe shopping...it made me laugh, it's his only girlish tendency...All in all it was a good time.

"event","So on tuesday night I slept in the courtyard of the board of ed. building with about 20 other members of the Philadelphia Student Union.  We awoke early wednesday morning and formed groups.  We blocked all the entrances to the building, linked arms, sang, chanted, and generally commenced in civil disobedience.  It was pretty amazing.  The approximately 30 of us blocked a building that's about the size of a city block.  Nobody got in who came after 6:45 AM with the exception of James Nevels' (the evil head of the School Reform Commision) lawyer climbed in a window in the basement through the boiler room.  We had that blocked off quickly as well.  Apparently at some point they had wanted to use a crane to lift workers inside, but that would've just been silly.  There was only one arrest, Jake, he was arrested for ""obstructing a public highway""  but that was just ridiculous because the cop cars were what was obstructing the street, not him.  The charges were dropped, but he was still pretty traumatized.  He is only 15, after all.  Throughout the course of the day, I helped to block doors, the main entrance, buses that were to be used to move the meeting somewhere else, chased down a school district van, and made Nevels walk a lot by blocking his car.  The meeting about the privatization of elementary schools which we had tried to prevent was moved and postponed to 3 PM.  We took down our things at the board building and went to the meeting, exhausted.  The meeting ran for three hours, and in the end, the city people wanted to remove schools from the list to be privatized and add a parent vote whereas the state people said ""No, we're evil, let's give lots of schools to edison Inc.""  Of course, they used better words, but you understand.   We yelled a lot...""Shame""  and we sang ""We Shall Overcome.""   The best part was the fact that we made national news.  I was on NPR (national public radio), and the only student speaker, I might add (go me!).  We had articles on the front page of the New York Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer, The Metro and also, we had articles in The Philadelphia Daily News and USA Today.  We were on all the local news stations, and apparently there was a short segment on ""World News Tonight""  with Peter Jennings... I didn't see that myself, but apparently it was good.  It's so great, we've got so much support and publicity right now, it's awesome.  Now we are being sued for failure to respond to an injunction and for a restraining order and damages of $200,000...like we have that much!  The SRC is using such scare tactics, but really, they're the ones who are scared, not us.  We are in the right, and we have support, and we will win.  Just you wait and see :).  In other news, my solo has been getting a little better, and my skirt is mostly finished.  I'm displeased with Or because his Mom said stuff to Lou that made her think I betrayed her confidence when I think I was just stating my opinion.  I must be more careful in the future.  Bad me, I didn't go to work again!  Bad, bad me.  Now I must go to sleep, tomorrow I get to go to an awards ceremony for an art contest in which I won 3rd place, and possibly to the farm."

"event","So this week pretty much sucked.  I won't go into it much here, because I don't want this journal to be all heavy and sad.  Let's just say, simply, that involved death and incurable disease among animals and people I love.  This in turn caused me to think a little bit about what happens after death, and religion.  Religion, to me, is somewhat comical.  The whole concept of faith baffles me to a degree - I mean, to force oneself to believe the unbelievable and to explain the inexplicable...well there's just some element of fantasy that comes to my mind there.  I think reincarnation would be one of the best alternatives, I mean, you get to live again and right past wrongs, and if you screw up, you get a crappy life.  I think that's fair.  I was thinking about the movie Dogma...that's hilarious...I wish I knew more about Catholicism so it would be even funnier.  Oh well.  Kevin Smith is awesome...my dad met him once...there's another depressing thing, my Dad missed his Sundance deadline, he's really upset, and so am I.  But anyway, back to religion...I don't know all about trying to convert other people, and not just to your religion, but to your values and beliefs.  For instance, while a friend of mine was at Presidential Classroom she was asked if she was jewish, and then asked how it felt to be going to hell,,,,isn't that just wrong?  I mean, according to her beliefs maybe the other person is going to hell...ugh! so subjective!  In my religion I don't think there will be a hell - that's what high school is for :)  Anyway, and what about the abortion debate?  Isn't it enough if you think it's wrong not to have one?  Why should you stop other people from doing it?  I mean, you know they're going to get theirs in hell anyway, and their child?? Well by most religious beliefs a child born out of wedlock or by rape or incest is also pretty screwed right from the get go.... It's just bizarre, to want to control someone's freedom of choice like that...Religion seems somewhat brainwashing.  And now for another tangent...as I was walking home from the train station I saw one of those license plates that says ""You've Got A Friend in Jesus""  which I just think is improperly phrased... I mean, is it saying one of my friends is somehow inside Jesus?  Within him?  Did he eat one of my friends? It's especially confusing, because the plates are supposed to say, ""You've got a Friend in Pennsylvania""  which makes a hell of a lot more sense.  After my sucky week I went to student union today and learned about civil disobedience - being arrested sounds scary, but it's worth it, at this point.  On the way home I was sitting on the train with nothing to read or listen to, with the exception of my surroundings.  Behind me there were these little boys riding the train with their father.  It was the sweetest thing, they had never taken the train before, and made me realize how much I was taking my ride for granted.  They were awed and excited by the speed and everything outside...it was so cute.  They were having so much fun with something I find so incredibly dull.  It helped to put stuff in perspective, made me appreciate what I've got a little more.  It brought me back down to Earth and made me stop thinking about the crappiness of life for a little while.  Rejuvinating, really.  Well, so long for now, I'm off to my first art opening, and later out to dinner...ah the good life, ta ta :)"

"event","So today was my last all city rehearsal at Girl's High ever.  I can't say I'll miss it too much...still...it was fun to get out of all my classes.  Back when 259 was around we used to drive down Broad st. and get food and blast our music really loud...i miss them so... ah nostalgia.  Today I got out of all of my classes except for social science.  I really shouldn't have cut el func (elementary functions)  I'm quite lost at the moment...but oh well, really I only have to pass.  Yay...fourth semester...only a few brief months...makes me smile just thinking about it.  Anyway, back to today.  I was just realizing how I'm really not going to see anyone next year...but everyone makes me so proud.  All of my friends got into these crazy academic schools...Harvard, Swarthmore, Yale,  Penn, RISD, Stanford, Chicago, Brown...and more...it's really rather intimidating.  I never thought that everyone I know would get into so many prestigious schools...it almost makes me feel like my acceptence is somehow lesser...Then I realize that one cannot compare the two...I got into a very competitive art school and I have as much right to gloat as anyone else.  Still, my conversation with my friend Abby who just got accepted to both Harvard and Yale made me think about my peers as a group and appreciate how amazing they really are.  I guess that's all for today...it was a rather boring day besides that.  Perhaps I will get to the farm this weekend.  I have Monday off for the all city dress rehearsal, that will be a good day.  Also, the juniors are taking PSSAs all week which means I get to sleep in....yay :)  I feel the need to do something social.  I ought to figure that out.  Oh well..ta ta for now."

So spring break's been pretty dull, but restful.  I'm so into sleeping til noonish.  It's lovely.  I'm working on my solo and my skirt that I'm making for the solo.  Both are coming along pretty well, but I'm having a little trouble with creating a pattern for my skirt.  I may have bitten off more than I can chew.  Here's the somewhat suprising news...I met boys, yes that's right, plural, boys, over the spring break.  2 of them...nice and somewhat cute.  That's got to be some sort of record for me.  I'm a little lackluster in the romance department.  But I would like some romance, it never fails to make life interesting.  It's weird to write it here, but everyone's gone for the holidays so I have nobody to tell.  I could call Diana, but the phone is so far away, and she'll just read it here anyways.  So yesterday I was incredibly bored..I was talking to Jeremy online which made me simultaneously pleased and aggrivated.  Stuff's so complicated.  Anyway, then my friend Or's (who is rather aggrivating, but means well)  roomate Mike started talking to me.  I was telling him how I needed something to do and he invited me over to watch a movie.  It was nice and spontaneous.  Definitely a friendship thing, not a date.  But still fun with a member of the opposite sex.  So rare these days.  Anyway, I went there and ate ice cream and watched parts of movies and then took the train home.  Hey, it was something to do.   The other guy is Andrew who I met while waiting for the bus.  I don't expect anything to come of it because it just doesn't seem like it would.  But he works at Staples and plays bass in a band...and yeah, quite funny.  The bass and the funniness are good things, but I don't know about the working at Staples part...that's just odd.  But I'm odd, so I shouldn't talk.  I left him a little note on his website, but he hasn't written to me or anything.  I actually ended up having to go to Staples to buy posterboard and I saw him there and that was somewhat awkward, but nice.  So that's my super-exciting social life.  I want everyone to come back, but I really don't want to go back to school.  At least the year is basically over.  Thank goodness.  Only about 50 actual school days left...ahhh.  Again I reiterate, I'm so ready to be done with high school.  College is like the greener grass on the other side of the fence...I hope it still looks as green when I get there :)  Now I ought to go do some real work and give the computer to my little brother.  So long."

"event","I always thought supermodels looked angry because they were underfed, objectified, and in general just trying to look intense.  However after my experiences of the past few weeks I have found a different, highly plausible reason for those sulky magazine cover scowls.  That reason is the fact that nobody makes clothes that these models can wear.  Recently I have visted no less than 5 stores in an attempt to find possible prom dresses.  I was going for something pretty yet affordable.  Anyways, I went with some friends; all of us were bitching and moaning about how the damn things just don't fit.  However, I think I had the worst of it.  Apparently I have shrunk since last year from a size 2 to a size 0.  Department stores cary NOTHING in size zero.  Discount stores are not much better.  Basically, the only places that carry dresses in my size are ""designer""  shops, such as one on 2nd near my cello teacher's house.  This is awful...I can't afford to have a dress made.  I can attempt to take one in, but I don't want to buy something that doesn't fit.  It just doesn't seem worth it.  It's just not fair, where can I get something nice and cheap that will actually fit?  Sadly the answer is nowhere. So the supermodels and I will just be angry...we must spend lots of money buying dresses we will most likely wear only once because stupid stores will not sell clothing that actually fits us.  And it's not just super skinny people....people who are big, tall, or ""abnormally"" proportioned are screwed too.  It just disgusts me...limiting everyone, especially women, to some body shape norm...but I think I've whined enough.  Plus, I learned the real reason of why supermodels are always angry...and isn't that the important thing in life, to learn something?  Enough of this, Goodnight."

"event","I guess I haven't updated this in a while, but you see, I lead a boring, boring life where nothing ever happens.  If I were George Bernard Shaw I would call it heaven- a place where nothing ever happens.  But then again I figure pretty much anyone who has time for a livejournal leads a fairly equivilent boring life.  I finally got out to the farm this weekend, but it was too windy to ride.  My horse is shedding...he'll be very sleek and shiny in a month's time.  I think he misses me.  I miss Diana, she's never around anymore since she's been living out there...as Nava says, ""Diana needs to get off her high horse and come into the city, pun intended.""  But it's ok, because as long as she's happy I am happy.  I also did lots of research and got very little sleep.  Yesterday I missed a big student union rally with puppets...damn...well but I had to go to work.  The future of public education in Philadelphia is being decided by the School Reform Commission today...it's pretty scary...but I haven't even thought about it much.  That's because I didn't have to go to school.  Instead I went downtown to the church where orchestra has it concerts.  It was a dress rehearsal day. Still, it's a break from my regular classes, and that's precisely what orchestra is good for.  Before rehearsal a certain friend of mine (who shall remain nameless)  hooked up with this guy that she likes.  It made me happy, I had someone to live vicariously through :)  It was so cute.  Unfortunately I don't know if they realized that they were in plain sight...that's what happens when you're behind slightly blurred glass windows... Oh well, not too many people saw them, just a few friends.  Also a few acquaintences of mine were smoking pot in the church...isn't that just wrong?  and stupid, they're definitely getting caught, it wafted through the entire building.  Rehearsal was long, and boring, and did I mention it was long?  After rehearsal we wanted to see a movie, but of course since rehearsal ran over we could not.  We had lunch at Liberty Place and then went shopping.  I got a lovely dress with my mom and Emily's money...I felt a little guilty afterwards, but it's a great dress!  It's pretty slinky with a strapless top...it flares out a bit and comes to just below the knee...all black...a little retro and very pretty.  I wore it tonight, and managed to break one of the attachable straps with my cello shoulder strap.  Damn cello case- never helped anything.  Anyways, Abby and Alyssa went shoe shopping, Abby didn't find anything, but Alyssa got some heals.  After that we all just headed back to the church and ate food and waited til it was time to get ready....we watched the choir rehearse....the low quality was a little frightening, however there were some excellent solos.  Finally we all prettyfied ourselves and I wore my new dress and we sat and waited.  Jazz band, Percussion Ensemble, both did fairly well...choir wasn't half bad either.  Then intermission...I got to talk to James, Gorana, Rachel, Steve and Eva.  I miss James and Steve so much!  They're great.  Then we played and everyone did very well, with the exception of the bassoonist who couldn't get her entrances or tempos right and Alan the pianist who missed a measure and nearly threw the whole orchestra off during his concerto.  Luckily it all turned out well.  I made a lot of stupid little mistakes which pissed me off cuz I feel like I should be above that by now.  Oh well...nobody really noticed....just wait til next concert...that's what I'm worried about.  Anyhow, I think I'll neglect my work that I've not done and just head off to bed.  I really should sleep a bit.  I'm going to see James and Temple's orchestra on the 14th of April at the Kimmel Center, that's exciting...perhaps that will be me next year....I can always hope :)  Goodnight."

"event","Some comments that I made here sparked a long talk with Nava that I think was long in coming.  We talked about how she doesn't feel close to me, and how we sort of drifted apart.  I'm not sure what I expected to get out of it, or what she expected, for that matter.  But, while nothing was really solved, it felt nice to talk about it.  That made me think about my communication issues....of which there are plenty.  For example, my unwillingness to really share my feelings in a one on one situation.  I don't know really where it came from, but it's been there for a while.  I just get all uncomfortable and scared, it's really no good at all.  I guess it's something to work on...and it has to do with trusting people...but I'm not sure how to go about fixing it, or even if it's something that needs to be fixed.  In other news, Mr. Wilensky found my wallet - yay :) no ID and no permit, but hey it's better than nothing.  Also, if I can finish enough crap I can get out to the farm this weekend - I need to go...my head's all stressed and over cityfied.  I need to countryfy it for a day or two.  Maybe I could do some drawings...oh well, that never happens, but everyone can have dreams, right?  Everything else in my life is pretty blah...as usual I have a lesson tomorrow, for which I have practiced 0 times.  Bad unmotivated me, bad. C'est la vie.  I think I'll go read Handmaid's Tale now, it's even better the second time....Margaret Atwood is awesome.  Goodnight now."

"event","This week's been busy, yet not in a productive or fun way....just little stuff.  It's made me tired.  I've also been staying up talking to random people online for too long...that's no good.  I have this somewhat counterproductive thing where even if I'm really tired, if I feel like I haven't accomplished enough then I can't go to sleep.  Plus I have trouble sleeping when I feel I must contemplate things....but that's what my multiple journals are for.  Wednesday I got a ride downtown with Theresa and several other girls in my art class.  Thank heavens for last minute reaction papers.  It's so nice Theresa has a car.  Yesterday was quite blah...except rehearsal was bad...and Saulnier was no where to be found so I took the bus with Dave Thomas (no, not the dead founder of wendy's, a different one) and ended up late to work.  Meh.... Today wasn't bad.  Rehearsal was pretty average.  Then I had to force Saxon (my delinquint undercellist) into a sectional...and yes I am a total dorchestra nerd.   But hey, it lets me travel (to Israel, Canada, and next year China)and gives me power...I am principal cellist...and occasionally a bit of a tyrant.  Then I practiced for my lesson which I hadn't done all week.  Yuck.  I cut environmental science to work at the dorchestra bake sale...all in all we made between $700 and $930.  Best bake sale ever....we had smoothies, chinese food, pasta salad, and chocolate dipped strawberries, just to name a few items.  Ahh deliciousness.  Class was pretty dull...I kept going to help out at the bakesale between periods, which made all my teachers angry...oh well...by now they love me too much to care....that's the beauty of making good first impressions...you can always fall back on it.  I did some awful drawings in art...felt bad about it.  Then I handed in both my AP test money and my community service letter...that was a relief...it had been dangling precariously over my head for some time now (we are required 30 hours a year...luckily we conned the gym teachers into making marching band count...my friend Emily wrote our music, we showed up late to football games without costumes and played horribly...it was embarassing, but so totally worth it).  Then I got all packed up, and talked to Winky about China dates, he stressed that he needed cellos among other things.  Then I headed out to the subway only to realize that I had neither my wallet or tokens.  I began to walk back, but borrowed one from Julia Straka before I got all the way there.  Then Abby and Meir joined me.  We took the 8th and Market...they live in West Philly whereas my cello teacher lives in Old City.  It worked out ok though.  Meir says he wants to come ride horses with me...I have no clue how serious he is...it would be fun though.  He's been very friendly and affectionate towards me lately...interesting.  My cello lesson was, shall we say, less than stellar.  Oh well, it's to be expected.  For lack of my wallet I didn't go through with my evening plans of going to first friday and a poetry reading with Nava.  I borrowed money from my cello teacher and took the train home.  Fell quite asleep on the way.  I'm so about to go to sleep now, I'm quite tired.  No wait, Jeremy just came online, I'll talk to him first, oh nevermind, he's gone.  There you have another exciting chapter of my life.   Oh yes, I nearly forgot...in addition to being wallet less, money less and IDless, I have lost my learners permit which means I can't get my license.   It really sucks; hence the title of this entry.  I can do it now...but something always has to come up...c'est la vie.  At least I get to go see Schibby on Sunday...and I get a new bow :) yay."

"event","Today wasn't bad.  Yesterday was kind of a big deal...It started out fairly normally.  I did some house chores...homework...went out driving and learned to parallel park, which was actually kind of fun...but my Dad gets a bit exasperating sometimes.  I ended up back at my Mom's house just as my other family (Peter, my stepdad, and Rafi i.e. Harry Potter my 6 year old half brother) was finishing dinner.  I practiced and screwed up my concerto in front of their small audience.  Then I watched the closing ceremonies for the Olympics and finished 2 18 X20 drawings for my Jane Eyre project.  I don't think they were half bad considering I was falling asleep while doing them.  Then I went online, was talking to Schibby trying to arrange to see him this weekend.  I talked to Joni a bit too, she'll be in school on thursday which will be nice because I haven't seen her in months.  I miss them all...ah 259...good times.  Which is a good segway into the fact that Jeremy decided to talk to me.  He's my sort-of X....it's complicated.  Anyway he was being an ass when I saw him last and I had just been ignoring him.  I miss him like hell though...he was a really good friend of mine before we took that next step...I think I miss him more that way than in the more-than-friend sense.  Anyway...it made me all shaky, but it made me happy too, which is what I need now, so all in all I'd say it was a good thing.  Today was alright...nothing major.  Winky (Mr. Wilensky, my at times scary orchestra conductor)  yelled at everyone a lot... I don't know what he wants from me.  School was blah.  James was there, that was cool, I wish he had let me know he was coming so I could stay and talk to him... oh well.  I love James, he's so cute, but in a small child way...not in like a grown up guy way...I miss his funny expressions and our strange conversations...and of course good times in quartet ::sigh:: those were the days...but not really :)  I took the sub to center city with a small group of people...much hilarity....very amusing...somewhat dirty (as two of the party ended up on the subway floor... a fate no one should have to suffer).  I tried to do my reaction paper (like an art review thing, but more in depth...kind of an investigation of a piece), but all the galleries that I wanted to go to were closed.  I popped into a few stores looking for prom dresses, but didn't see anything dazzling...some stuff I liked though.  I'm determined to look absolutely lovely for prom...i'll do it to, just wait and see :)  It's one of the only times I'm ok with being girl-i-fied...I never do dresses or skirts, it's just not me.  Nava got a dress, but she didn't have time to tell me about it.  Then there's the whole date thing, but I think I won't worry about that now...I really don't much care.  Just thinking about how short a time it is til prom makes me happy :)  Because just after prom there's graduation and I am so out of that school - I can't wait.  People say they miss high school, and I'm sure I'll miss aspects of it, but I'm so ready to move on.   I feel much like I've outgrown it.  College here I come :)"

"event","Again a boring day...you know ever since I've gotten this livejournal thing my life has been quite uninteresting.  Maybe it's just because I've been forced to think about how boring it is that it seems that way.  I got my kitty back from the vet this morning, thankfully he's ok, he just needs to take more pills.  Boo pills...he hates them and I hate forcing them down his throat (occasionally literally).  Then my dad had me drive to the bank in the newer of our two 80s cars and I almost hit some guy because my vision was obstructed by my sunblocker thing...that was really scary.  Then I was all stressed and shaky.  I accompanied my Dad to this Temple (University, I will most likely attend its Tyler School of Art next year) reception for accepted students and then they gave us basketball tickets, which was our purpose for going, I gave them to Dad and his friend, my boss, John.  I left quickly, running late to meet Nava and Caitlin and go thrift store shopping and possibly to the movies.  Suprisingly Septa behaved itself. ..it still smelled though, but hey you can't have everything.  Then I went to bargain thrift instead of Village Thrift and thus nearly missed Nava until she met me at a corresponding bus stop.  We walked back to my house and watched a video.  Blah...talked some...we haven't really talked in a while.  She went online as me which she used to like to do a lot...it was weird.  Why do people always want to be me?  I'm not very exciting after all.  She talked to Schibby as me, which was fine...I shall see him next week when I head out to Swarthmore to pick up my new bow (as in the kind that you use to play the cello, not that with the arrows).  Then it was dinner time.  Nava left.  My Dad, Cindy (his g/f, my parents are divorced)  and I analyzed why I always escape on horseback when bad things happen in my dreams.  Contrary to the popular horses = sex symbolism, we decided that the horse = my ID and my ability to cope with and escape from stress and life's troubles.  We could be wrong...it happens a lot though, especially in my scary tsunami dreams.  Usually it's the horse that i ride (he's basically mine, he only loves two people and one of them is me :) ), Beemer, but sometimes, like the last dream I had, it was a random horse that I made up. Dreams are so strange, yet interesting and personal...like a mystery you can solve, but you can't quite remember it when it's over."

"event","I spent the greater part of last night and this morning finishing a stupid poster for a contest.  It involved mixed media (collage, colored pencil, marker, cut paper, etc.)and rather sappily depicted multi-ethnic children holding up the world.  The contest had the theme, ""No Borders, No Fences, Just Friends."" Classic and quite lame.  Anyway, I've won this contest with a crappy piece before, I don't see why I should put the effort into it.  There's something so lacking in art where the concept is not left to the artist...as if part of the creative process has been removed.  It pisses me off and therefore I don't like doing it.  However, Mrs. Cooperstein (my fairly cool art teacher), would not let me write on the entry form that my inspiration for my piece was mercenary, although I told her repeatedly that the only reason I did the contest was for the prize money and that it was required for a grade in her class.  She also wouldn't let me call it ""Sappiness"" or ""Psychedelic Children Holding up the World""...I had to settle for cliche ""Uplifting. "" (boo, hiss).  Anyhow, it made me think about myself as an artist and it made me consider all that art means to me which in turn made me feel good about how I am progressing in that area.  The rest of my life has been rather dull...I feel disconnected from my friends these days...but that's not entirely new.  I'm under practiced and I have all city orchestra tomorrow.  Yay, no school for Max :)  It starts at 1, but none of the teachers know that so we (the dorchestra kids) cut anything we fee like not attending.  As Nava once said, ""All City, the all purpose excuse.""  I went to work today, which was very blah.  My boss had me file things.  He's really great though, on tuesday he gave me a free pair of $120 speakers because he couldn't sell them.  I work at an audio electronic store...I crush boxes, assemble wires, repair speakers and turntables and soon I will be doing home installations which will make me a lovely 25$ an hour.  Anyway, I went to take the bus home, which is always just absolutely pleasant...I love the smell of urine and cigarettes in the evening... And of course,in regular Septa (south eastern transportation association? possibly...) fashion the bus took an hour and a half to come.  I didn't get home til well after eight, and I was dead asleep by then.  I can't afford to be when walking to my dad's house...it's not the best neighborhood.  But the air was quiet and the night was soft and pretty and I didn't mind so much as I would most February evenings.  I wish I had something more eventful to report, but alas, there is only bitching and whining to be done today.  Perhaps tomorrow will be better.  So long, for now.  I suppose I'll go watch some ice skating and put off reading Metamorphosis til tomorrow.  Eww...how much does english class suck?  I won't bore you with the details now, I've complained enough for one entry."

"event","My best friend has this journal thing that she writes in a lot...apparently it's a really good place to procrastinate, which is something I'm particularly good at.  Anyhow, she seemed to be having quite a lot of fun, so I figured, eh, I've got better things to do, but I'd rather waste my time, and I jumped right on the live journal bandwagon.  This is actually my third journal.  I have a hand written diary that I keep for my own personal writing and sanity and an online poetry journal which is more or less just for me as well...although I allow strangers to read my stuff (as I've written it under a pseudonym) but never my friends/people I know.  Writing, like most other things I do, is a stress release for me.  It helps me reorganize my thoughts in my rather scattered brain. When speaking with an adult friend of mine about this whole online journal thing, she called it ""online exhibitionism""  (goodness, that looks wrong, I hate spelling, it doesn't make any sense).  Anyway, I've decided that that's quite logical, but in terms of this journal it will be more along the lines of online random-flashing-in-a-Mardi-Gras-esque style, only without the beads,sort of a once a year exhibitionist thing (you see how that entire comment made no sense?  that's what I'm all about...you'll see what I mean).  I will reveal bits and pieces about my somewhat dull life through day to day musings.  Nothing deep or philosophical...nothing heavy...I can tackle that other places.  This will be my every day life, for better or for worse....it begins."

Today we went to an old/ill peoples home to sing carols etyc, and it was very scary. and also tragic. and heartbraking. singing songs about happy christmasses to people who cant even stand up etc. and during the second song this really old and distressed looking lady shouted out ""EXCUSE ME!"" and all the carers ignorded her basically, and after the song, she said to out singing teacher ""Excuse me, im not being nasty but can i leave this room while you are singing? I HATE IT! i HAVE TO GO NOW!"" etc, and everyone was laughing at her and she looked really distressed but they were all just cracking up. it took them ages to finally come and take her away, she looked so distressed. apart from that it wasnt too bad, but i ate FAR too many chocs. i keep overdosing on choc i swear. lol."

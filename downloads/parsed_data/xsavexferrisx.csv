"event","Remember me? Probably not. Haven't talked to anyone in a while. I took time from the thousands of apologies i owe and just stayed away from everyone for a while. And so this is my life so far. 
                  School is... okay. I love physics no matter how much i suck at the tests.. I just get it..     sometimes.. and I love the feeling of getting that one problem that no one else understands. and English can suck it.. in the words of Andrew jackson.. cause I hate english. 
                  Basketball.. is meh.. dont get me wrong.. I love the team.. but basketball in general.. is more or less just not the love of my life anymore. Maybe it never was.. but it just isn't doin it for me. I used to be good.. people used to look up to me.. But now I'm just.. ""meh"". 
            Everything else.. oh wait. there is nothing else. Basketball and school.. looks like i covered everything. What a life to live. College visting soon... exciting? i guess... I think i got a solid list of 5 or 6 colleges I wanna visit and apply to... close to home.. but far enough to havta live there. I started this college process thinking i wanted to go far away from here... but in the end..this is a place i've never left.. i've never moved from this town so i'll stay close.. explore what i need to explore.. and when im ready ill leave it behind. 
           I know people hate me.. and for reasons that you think i dont get or understand.. i do.. I could tell you that i'll change.. but i'd be lying. I could tell you I don't need you.. but god is that not true. And i could tell you I would rather drop everything and leave.. but i could never leave this.. i've grown too attached. So if in the end i'm alone.. then looks like it was meant to be and i'll accept it. 

well the Superbowl is today.. Go Pats.

But hey.. it was fun and i got to see guys get beat up:) always fun! 

After the game we headed back to Methuen and stoped at Friendly's in Middleton to grab a bite to eat.. This is when Justin went CRAZY.. buuut i love him anyways!! He's soo much fun to be with and just talk or laugh with. Got home a bit late but it was all good..

"event","So hey. 

havent written in a while so hey why not? 
Life recently has had its ups and downs. Started school. I Guess i have mixed feelings about this. I mean i like the whole school idea.. always have.. i know im insane but what can ya do. I like the teachers and i like the subjects i understand.I love some of the people there too. but then again.. its school.. filled with homework,projects, and tests, soo all in all i have no great hate for it but sometimes it just really pisses me off. 

Started sucking at life. I dont like anything anymore. I am a miserable person who is just a bitch 24/7. and it was never this bad. Like a year ago my life was fine.. i did sports.. got grades.. had friends.. was all together a happy person. Now i just feel like i have dropped into a sea of depression.. I have yet to make my parents like me.. everything i do they hate me for it. I have yet to make my friends like me.. i always blow them off to be with a boy.. and as for sports... I am just one HUGE disappointment. So basically I hate the person i am and i dont know how to get her back. hopefully things will change soon for the better.

but i've come to realize all of my sucking started when i met them. they pulled me away from everything and i dont know how i let it get this far. I left my friends for them... i disobeyed my parents for them.. we ruined each others lives and none of us want to admit it. We don't even know how to be happy anymore... our laughs are forced.. our smiles are plastered on like its the right thing to do. they have pulled me in and i have let them. I consider them my best friends for a time... who the hell was I kidding? I lost my best friends a loooong time ago. and they are the ones i miss. I miss being happy.. with them. I hate how i have let them ruin my life and i hate how the only thing i've come to know is them. I've lied to myself.. thinking that being with these people would make me happy.. that i could just forget everything else in the world that used to be important to me and just raise my life around them.. spend every waking moment with them.. it had gotten to the point where i couldnt go a day without seeing one of them or i would physically get sick. I have what they have done to me.. and i hate myself for what i have done to them. I wish i could just erase them from my mind and i've tried.. to get rid of all the pictures.. all the objects that remind me of them.. but theres just too many... everything reminds me of them..I dont even know who i am anymore... all I know is them, all i see is them. How did I let it get this bad? I didnt listen to ANYONE who warned me. Im so sorry to anyone and everyone who tried to help me.. I wish i could thank u for ur advice but in reality.. i was never even listening. I'm sorry to all my friends who i have ditched or just left behind.. u are still in my head and in my heart.. they are just taking over more of the space cause i let them. I let them  take ur place. I shouldnt have. no body could take ur places. I dont even know what to do anymore. If i try to stop speaking to them, stop thinking of them, throw away all our memories.. I am even more depressed because i know i have no one left.. it will be me and my memories of what i used to be.. of what i used to have.. of when i was happy. I let them control me... i had to make excuses to not hang out with someone.. or make an excuse to not talk to someone.. because they disapproved. cause they would find a way to get revenge and make me unhappy like they are. I was trapped. I couldnt be happy unless they were.. So i just caved in and let them have their way. and i cant erase what i've done. 

one good thing in life.. YES there is a good thing. *the only nerd who would come and talk to me at 12 oclock at night.. you are an amazing friend and u make me laugh when no one else can.

soo going to Maine today:) Always nice to have a change of scenary once in a while and hopefully it makes this summer somewhat exciting. Dont get me wrong.. what I do now is great. But video games can only get u so far! hehe And is it wrong that I'm not gonna miss some people? Maybe it's because I dont wanna think about them while I'm gone. 


Word of Advice to anyone in the Future.. dont be so sure that he's your friend. Would a friend call you fat and ugly and a bitch? I dont know about you but that doesnt really fit friend criteria in my book. So cheer up, eat less, and find new friends!

"event","So I made a cd for my favorite bus rider today and he wasn't on the bus! :(  He definetly did that on purpose! haha aw well.. I definetly fell asleep in my first class ever! I felt so proud.. even if I did get in trouble :/  I swear Mr. Jennings thinks I'm a genius cause I passed his class freshman year.. its great! He was all asking what was wrong with me and I just told him I had insomnia and I don;t sleep at night.. don't think he believed me but he sympathized :) 

So I've come to a conclusion that lying is ok.. right? I mean everyone does it, even the people you thought would never ever do it. So if everyone else does it, why not do it yourself? It's the cool thing to do right? 

Checked out the yearbook today.. and i looked like shit as usual But hey.. what can ya do. I checked out prince's picture.. looked good.. as usual.. I hate those people who take wicked awesome pictures. GR haha 

aaaaand!! at softball today! we had a wicked short practice (kicked ass) and coach made us all her amazing chicken soup that lived up to its expectations cause it was unbelieveably good!! Nice way to end a crappy day!   But Tomorrows gonna kick ass cause I got Chem. long block which is the best long block EVER! 

I'm out.

"event","I'm not out of my mind for caring about someone that comtemplates suicide...am I?
Do you know how much it hurts to love someone that you know will never love you back?
Its like theres a hole where his heart is.
I hate when he speaks of bullets.
He's got one of those neverending pains.
I wish I could help him...but he doesn't want it.
He has my heart and doesn't even know it.
It hurts to see him like this.
I don't know what to say to him....or how to say it without sounding wrong.
I can't understand him but I will never leave him.
I would feel too bad if I did knowing his state of mind.
No matter how many tears I shed it won't make a difference.
I don't think he's gonna see 21 so I want as many good times as possible.
I won't think about the bad...just the good, the great, the awesome.
I'm just being a good friend right?"

A while since things changed

You left my life forever

I thought I got over you

But hey I guess I was wrong

I had come to terms with everything

I thought I didn't love you anymore

I had actually been forgetting you

You hadn't really crossed my mind

Until someone mentioned you

I thought I was done

I felt like I was really moving on

Well yet again I'm wrong

I figured it out the other day 

<font size=8> I still <font color=red>love</font color> you</font size>

I Hate You
When did I lie?
How did I turn into a Two Faced Liar?
I fucking hate you!
You make me sick
Since when am I antisocial?
Why did you take my friends with your bullshit?
Although you say they were never my friends...
Fuck you
YOU were never my FRIEND!
I NEVER should have LOVED you!
All the time I wasted on you
It could have gone to someone more worthy!
Fuck You
I want nothing to do with you!

I loved you like no tomorrow.
Thats right...I said LOVED.
You mean nothing to me anymore.
I don't know what ever made me want you.
I regret everything I ever said.
I'm over you.
Baby you don't even know how hard it was for me to sit here and let you go.
I made a mistake but I said sorry.
I think you need to get your act together.
I cried all the tears that I could.
Nothing makes sense anymore.
I realized that it was a waste of time.
Being your fiend was fun.
We had our moment.
You said it Our Little Secret.
I got drunk and fucking spilled it all.
Then you said I was a slut.
You weren't saying that when YOU were in MY car getting off.
I thought I knew you better than that babe.
You kept me your Dirty Little Secret.
I fucked up and told it so now I'm just another regret.
Right?
You were never my friend."

"event","This thing that I call a friendship
It never seems to go my way
When it finally does I cant seem to get through it
I love him with everything in my heart
My mind is telling me no 
My heart says yes
I have no idea who I can talk to anymore
The person that I trust the most is the one that I dont think I can be around right now
I really can say that I am lost with him and lost without him
He is what keeps me sane in this hell hole
He makes me happy when I'm sad 
I make him happy too
I dont really know what to do now
All I think about is him

Things are changing
I dont exactly know how
I dont know if its good or bad
He told me that nothing will change
I just feel like it has

I'm on the verge of tears
I really cant make my decision 
I know whats right and whats wrong
At least I think so...

I'm at war with myself
I dont know anymore
I cant think straight
I couldnt even get high without thinking about him
I decided to stop smoking
Yes I say that all the time

I love him so much
I need to stop saying that
I'm such a jealous person
He knows that
We had an experience with that
I let him know how I felt about it

I cant even say anything else 
I know that I need to stop thinking about it
I just cant seem to help it
I have a picture of him on my wall
I might have to take it down temporarily
Thats bad I know but I just feel like its necessary

I think I'm a bitch for being this way
I hate it
I dont like myself this way
I'm overly protective of him 
I always have to know where he is
I kind of do some blocking when it comes to other girls
Yes I'm a bitch when it comes to him

I really am at war with myself."

"event","I did something the other day that I'm not going to sit here and say that I regret because I don't.  I said at the time that it was cool and that nothing would change...I woke up the next morning and realized what I did and basically was in shock and disbelief, since it was never supposed to happen.  The biggest battle of mind and heart has been driving me up the wall.  I think about whether or not it actually meant something or I just did it because of who it was...I mean how many times do you get the person that you dream about?? If you're lucky, one time if any at all.  I say I love him all the time because I truly do...when you get attached to someone in a friendship like way words just seem to slip out and stick.  My brain is telling me to just forget it...that it was a one time thing between friends...but my ever so kind and loving heart is totally pushing that out the window. When I think about him now I get butterflies...just a little bit though and I know that it means something...but I'm not so sure what yet.  I was told a few months ago that it will happen eventually, just give it some time.  Well it finally happened and I'm as confused as a drunk dog about what to do next.  We had a pretty good conversation before anything happened about what it would be like after...but now its after and I have no clue what to do...I think I need to talk to him...or something..."

I've been contemplating this for a while, I feel like I'm nothing, I'm not worth anyones time.  It makes me not want to talk to anyone.  The only person that I truely trust here is that one that I wish I could have 24/7...but thats never gonna happen.  If I were writing out of anger then I would have a different tone.  I'm writing out of a strange sadness, a depression kind of, I dont even really know anymore.  I have no clue what my purpose is...nothing ever goes the way I would want it to go.  I dont get what I want from anyone...I dont even have a true best friend in this shit hole...except for him.  It feels like I'm being strangled and cant breathe.  I'm not worthy of anything.  Being like this sucks but I cant help it anymore, everyone around me is so unhappy and I am too.  I'm sick of feeling like I'm not wanted.  I feel good with him, he can make me smile.  I feel so good around him...he makes me wanna stay."

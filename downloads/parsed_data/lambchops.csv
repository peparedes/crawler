What *is* good is the fact that I got my first check from Epinions on Saturday!  Talk about a hard earned $20.  Actually, it wasn't all that bad.  It just took some thought and some planning...now I'm well on my way to being a millionaire!  Okay.  Not really, but a girl can dream :)"

"event","Yeah.  I'm alive and yes, it's also been a while since I updated.  Why?  Well, yesterday I had this great entry.  I was a masterpiece.  Then, I try to post.  Stupid Live Journal is having technical difficulties.  Damn.

Anyway, I had a great wedding and reception and for that matter honeymoon.  The only major issue was the fact that somehow the marriage license got misplaced.  We never found it.  I figure that at the next funeral when whoever has it takes that jacket out again, he will find it.  We'll probably never know really since that individual will likely be very embarrassed (for good reason, of course).  We got a new marriage license (despite the county clerk's near refusal to help with the situation).  

Tonight, JT and I are opening the remainder of our wedding gifts.  It should be pretty fun :)"

"event","Woo-hoo!  I just got back on Sunday from my honeymoon.  Yup.  I'm married now to a super guy who loves me for me.  How sappy, I know.  Anyway, all is well and we had a wonderful ceremony and reception (I don't remember much-I was so busy).  The honeymoon was also great.  We went on the Monarch of the Seas from Royal Caribbean Cruises.  It was a great ship and a great trip.  We were down in the Caribbean for a week and saw:  St. Thomas, St. Maarten, Antigua, St. Lucia, and Barbados.  My favorite?  Barbados was wonderful.  We're definitely considering going back on a cruise.  GREAT!

What else?  We lost our Marriage License, so I had to go to the county clerk to get issued a new one.  Apparently, those women in that office are very unhappy with their lives and feel it necessary to complicate the lives of others.  I don't know how many times I told them that IT WAS LOST!!!  They just interrogated me, and treated me like a child.  It doesn't help that I look an entire six years younger than my age...yeah, I look like 18 or 19 when I am 24 almost 25.

So now, I am back at work.  I have a tan (or as much of one as a freckled redhead can have).  Nothing bad happened in my office when I was gone, so I'm happy with that.  Keep checking back!"

"event","Yeah.  It's my last day at work until after the big day.  I'm not nervous, just anxious and excited.  It seems very odd that the thing that I've been planning for so long is just around the corner.  I can't wait.  I'll see all sort of people, too...people from LSSU (my college), people from my hometown, and all of the family.  It should be interesting to say the least.  I'll let ya'll know how it goes after I get back from the honeymoon (yeah! no more crappy Michigan weather!).

So, I bet people will be interested in the ceremony.  I'm an atheist as is the husband-type.  Most people we have told just in passing, but there will be some shocked family when the mayor walks down the aisle instead of a church guy.  Like I said...it'll be interesting.  It'll be even more intersting if it rains since the ceremony is supposed to be outside.

Blah blah blah blah.  Yesterday I played ridiculous amounts of games on Pogo.com.  I just love anything that has to do with words, so they have some games I adore there, too.  I'm going to have accounts at every single online gaming site within months, I think.  Go figure...I finally have a real job and I have too much time on my hands.  I drive a 1/2 hour to work to sit at my desk all day and then drive 45 minutes-1 hour home to sit on my ass.

Wait, that's not right.  I don't have anyting to do at all. I already worked on the boss' old laptop and fixed a few other problems.  I also updated my personal webpage.  Beyond that life aint so grand...lovely grammar, I know.  

I just want to get out of here and go home and pack for the honeymoon.  Soon...like on Sunday...I'll be on a luxury cruise liner in the Caribbean.  I'm so excited.  And, to make it even better, I'll be there with my new husband!  What a great guy.  This week is pretty emotionally taxing for me.  I am fine at work, but this wedding stuff is piling up.  I just want to have it over and done with.  At least the packing for the week ahead is keeping me a bit occupied.

What else....

I've got a really bad piece o' poo for a computer at home.  I want a new one badly.  It's just that right now with the wedding we are kind of stretched for cash.  I'm crossing my fingers that we can buy one after (hey, maybe we'll get enough wedding cash for that!)...

"event","Cedar Point went wonderfully.  It only rained for like two hours all day...usually it rains all day when I'm there.  I didn't even get too much of a sunburn.  My feet and hips hurt from walking, but I should be recovered by the wedding (my wedding) on Saturday.  I rode quite a few rides, among which are:  Magnum, Raptor, and Power Tower.  I didn't make it onto Milennium Force this year...the rain and long lines prevented that from happening.  But, it was a good day with my friends and sister.  

Beyond that, life is boring.  I spent too much money at the mall yesterday on a pair of khakis, a few shirts, and a Fossil watch for the man's birthday.  Hopefully he likes it...actually, I know he will.  He should be very happy with the choice I made.  It's very manly and very nice looking in general.  

Work is blah.  Epinions is blah.  Neopets is blah.  I am blah. I just want this week to be over with.  My life is about to change quite a bit.  Hey!  It will finally be alright for the man to spend the night!

"event","See, I live in Michigan.  What does that mean?  Well, we don't get sun all winter and then when the weather finally perks up, the entire great lakes state is covered in a blanket of moisture.  It's hot, dank and absolutely disgusting.  Forget trying to go outside and actually maintaining a decent appearance.  I yank my hair bank into a little ponytail and I'm on my way.  I don't even attempt the impossible.  Rather, my clothes and hair stick to my head....

But, wait!  Michigan has basically been under drought conditions.  There's a watering ban.  Still, alas, it's humid as hell.  I just want the weather to normalize.  But, then again, I don't want to wish too hard and make it rain this weekend at Cedar Point or next weekend for my wedding.  That would really suck very badly.

Know what else?  The best thing in the world is free food.  I had some today, and regarless of what swill I choke down it tastes like 10x better if there is no price attached to it.  Although, I have to say that I wasn't happy being stuck sitting across from a person who wouldn't stop talking about stupid things and how beautiful her new modular house was.  Yeah right (although I didn't say one word to refute her bizarre claim).

I can just watch a whole bunch of beautiful kids get into trouble and corrupt the innocent one (Rachel, in this case).  I get a big kick out of it to say the least.  My favorite season was probably Boston (I liked Genesis and Jason) or Miami and my least favorite was maybe Hawaii (I HATE AMAYA).  Okay, yeah, I admit it...I'm a Real World addict.  Now that's off my chest I can continue on with life...

I've been doing more <a href=""http://lambchops.epinions.com"">Epinionating</a>.  That site it almost as addictive as <a href=""www.neopets.com"">Neopets</a>!  I just tracked down a guy who was copying reviews from one place on the web and passing them off as  his own.  What a loser.  Also, my friend foochow94 on Neopets just got his password changed.  I'm crossing my fingers that he gets that all figured out.  I'd die without my little virtual pets (yes, I've been playing for almost a year now nonstop).

Last night I went and saw my cousing and her two kids.  They are so cute.  Makes me almost want a few puppies of my own...all in due time.  Although, I have to say that when the baby puked sour milk on me that kind of turned my delicate little tummy.  Like I said...all in due time.

"event","Well, I just thought I'd say that for no reason in particular.  I just don't wanna grow up.  I want to be a college student forever.  Instead, I've got my degrees (yes, I tried to be a career student) and now I'm forced to work.  Oh poo.  I'm sitting at my computer, typing away.  I feel kind of like an old lady and if wasn't for the Mountain Dew I'm drinking and the rock I'm listening to, I could be categorized as such very easily.

I just wrote a few more reviews over at <a href=""lambchops.epinions.com"">Epinions.</a>.  One was about Mellow Gold by Beck and the other was about Foo Fighters debut.  The Beck one stirred some controversy.  One guy was like...""that's a bit dark for my taste, but good review!""  I don't think it's dark at all!  It's funny and observant and for that matter a hell of alot more creative than the crap he was listening to.  He told me in not so many words that my tastes would change alot with age.  Nope.  They won't.  I'm a rock girl.  Period.  And that won't destroy my children's lives...

I also just became fascinated with a movie from childhood.  It's one I forgot about, but in retrospect was twisted and could have helped to form my twisted taste in movie.  What's this work of art...this film I actually saw in the theater?  Well, it's ""Return to Oz.""  Yeah, I know that's stupid.  But, it was dark and everything I've read on the web reassures me that I'm right with that thought.  I think I'll buy it for $13.99 from Amazon.com...

And then the alarm came way too quickly.  But what can you do?  I want to make this money...in fact, I refuse to live in the squallor that being a student forces upon a person.  I want to be able to eat and to buy gas without using my credit card.  Those darned people at Discover don't deserve any more of my hard-earned cash.  I've already given them like thousands of dollars!

My aunt and uncle and cousin stopped by yesterday to check out my new house.  They liked it.  No suprise...everybody does :)  Okay.  Now, the bragging is over.  We all went out to dinner at a Mexican place the next town over.  Yum.

My life is all-too-boring.  I wish that something interesting would happen.  Oh.  Wait.  I'm getting married and going to the Caribbean in less than two weeks now.  That's interesting, right?"

"event","Okay.  Not really, but this one was really lo-key for me.  I didn't do anything but drink Mt. Dew and eat chips.  Well, I did *something* that happens to be somewhat productive.  I actually wrote four music reviews over at <a href=""http://lambchops.epinions.com"">Epinions.</a>  They were:  Alice in Chains, Facelift; Moby, Everything is Wrong; Soul Coughing, Irresistible Bliss; and Matthew Sweet, 100% Fun.  Talk about wasting my time. 

I also watched a few schlocky horror films, Wishmaster & Wishmaster 2.  Ah...the things on do on the weekend when the man's out of the house.  Also, I did laudry and watered the yard.  It's not that I'm an old lady (unless you consider 24 to be old), rather it's just that suddenly I seem to have more responsibility.  Yuck.  I don't much like responsibility in the traditional sense of the word.

My stupid Accord is acting up, too.  The power locks don't work all of the time.  They work sporadically, and I think it has something to do in some way with water getting to the electrical system and shorting out the wires.  Or something...I'm not inclinded in that area.  Anyway, when they stop working I can't even get my doors open.  I look like such an ass trying to turn the key in the door...some people probably think I'm trying to steal it...

Anyway, last night I caught the voting off of one Big Brother 2 cast member.  I haven't really been watching the show...I've seen this version like three times total.  Although, I was shocked as heck that they eliminated Sheryl.  She seemed like a nice enough lady.  I'm not sure if this show is going to be any better than last season's, but we'll wait and see.  It definitely can't be as boring...that seems impossible.

Right now, I'm hopped up on Hazelnut coffee.  It's not that the sludge tastes good, rather it just gets me off my butt and moving.  I'm still fascinated with ""Brave Fencer Musashi"" for the Playstation.  I played a bit last night and got further through the game.  I realize it's a game for kids, but I somehow enjoy every moment I sit there with the controller in my paws.

What else...I'm going to Cedar Point next weekend for my Bachelorette party.  I didn't want a raunchy party, so my sister arranged for a calmer version that included roller coasters.  To say the least, I'm very very very very very happy.  I've got about five people that will be there.  Hopefully it doesn't rain and we have a good time.

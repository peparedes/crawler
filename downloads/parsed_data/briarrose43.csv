"event","I live in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  Right now, that is quite the topic on the national news cycle, because of the Summit fire.  That fire is about 30 miles south/east of us with lots of rugged terrain in between.

I live among the sand hills in the San Lorenzo Valley.  Dig around here and you'll find shark's teeth and shells.  We also have manzanita, redwood, oak and pine.  All dry from the lack of our usual deluge of yearly rain.  The past two years we've had half our normal rainfall.  Living here, you know in the back of your mind, that one day you may have to evacuate.  Normally, you get used to down power lines in the winter and blocked roads.  Yesterday  trees toppled power lines less than a mile from my house.  I had left home to go and get the Peanut at school and came upon downed trees and thick plumes of smoke and then the local fire department coming right behind me.  I beat a hasty retreat back home, called the Hubby to go and get Peanut and to be prepared.  Thankfully several local fire stations quickly took charge of the area and with the help of 2 fire planes diverted from the Summit Fire, our local fire was under control in an hour.  Those planes flew so low over our house, I swear I could see the pilot.

I want to thank the fire crews of Ben Lomond, Zayante, Boulder Creek, Santa Cruz, Felton, Cal Fire, The California Youth Authority as well as the pilots of the planes for their quick response. As well as thanking all those firefighters on the front lines of the Summit Fire.  

Want to help?  Donate to the Red Cross who will be helping lots of displaced folks who have lost everything."

Which Historical Lunatic Are You?
You are Gaius Caesar Germanicus - better known as Caligula!

Third Emperor of Rome and ruler of one of the most powerful empires of all time, your common name means ""little boots"". Although you only reigned for four years, brief even by Roman standards, you still managed to garner a reputation as a cruel, extravagant and downright insane despot. Your father died in suspicious circumstances, you were not the intended heir, and one of your first acts as Emperor was to force the suicide of your father-in-law. Your sister Drusilla died that same year; faced with allegations that your relationship with her had been incestuous, you responded, bafflingly, by declaring her a god.

You revived a number of unpopular traditions, including auctions of properties left over from public shows. When a senator fell asleep at one such auction, you took each of his nods as bids, selling him 13 gladiators for a vast sum. You attempted to have your horse, Incitatus, made into a consul and hence one of the most powerful figures in Rome. It was granted a marble stable with jewels and a staff of servants. At one point you forced your comrade Macro to kill himself - in much the same vein as your father-in-law - accusing him of being his wife's pimp. You, of course, were having an affair with said wife at the time.

Things went from bad to worse. When supplies of condemned men ran short in the circus, you had innocent spectators dragged into the arena with the lions to fill their place. You claimed mastery of the sea by walking across a three-mile bridge of boats in the Bay of Naples; kissed the necks of your lovers, whispering sweet nothings like ""This lovely neck will be chopped as soon as I say so,""; dallied with your sister's lover and made her pull her unborn child out of her womb prematurely. Towards the end of your reign, you had a golden statue of yourself made and dressed each day in the same clothes you yourself wore. When you eventually died, the terrified people of Rome refused to believe that such a cruel reign could ever end, and believed you to be alive for years afterwards."

"event","I hath survived another Thanksgiving! No, it wasn't really that bad but at one point I almost gutted my father over a damn can of lima beans.  

This year, in addition to the usual Thanksgiving fare, I made a caramelized onion bread pudding that was unbelievably yummy!  It has been nice having my parents here, (regardless of the lima beans) and we had a good time today roaming the many aisles of the San Jose Harvest Faire.  I always manage to find great gifts for folks and for me too!

For many years Thanksgiving was a blur.  I was working retail in a mall and Thanksgiving usually meant I would show up exhausted at my parents house and sleep half the day away, help chop things, eat and go home and sleep more in preparation for the madness that is Black Friday.  Long gone are the days of working 16 hour shifts, and 150 hours for 11 days of work. (How on earth did I survived that?)  Now a days, I don't go anywhere near a mall on or around Christmas, (Praise the Internet!)  I enjoy Christmas/Yule and by eliminating that madness from my life means I enjoy it all the more.  Means more time to decorate the house within an inch of its life... ho ho ho!  Look out Santa!"

"event","I looked up the meaning of the word 'entitled"" - ""a legal right or a just claim to receive or do something.""


So why do people, and I am limiting this to Americans right now, why do we think we are so entitled to take up more than one parking spot?  snack from the produce section as we shop or not pay for that bagel we gave our screaming kid to eat because we forgot to pack a snack for him/her?  

Many years ago when I was in England, I heard, ""You Americans"" quite often.  Even when I asked the flight attendant, (ok it was so many years ago she might have been called a stewardess) to keep the whole can of coke, instead of just staying with the small 4 oz. you get in the plastic cup.  I look back at that and I still cannot figure out what I did made me one of those people.  An American.

We are entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  But what about that makes us think we can run over anyone else to get that?  I'm not sure where I am going with this thought process.  It just occurred to me today as I was waiting for 4 cars to cross in front of me as they clearly ran their red light and I wait through most of my green light."

"event","This past weekend, the Hubby and I, FINALLY got to celebrate our 12 year anniversary (from June).  Actually it was a lucky weekend away, because he was in 
Las Vegas for a conference, but dang it, it seems that when our anniversary comes around it gets relegated to a cheap dinner out and not much else. (this past anniversary, Hubby did not even get me a card.. which he regretted... A LOT!)  So I decided that this was our time to celebrate.  

It started off with my flight being delayed 2+ hours... so instead of arriving in Vegas at 2:10, I got to the hotel at 5:30.  Thankfully I was able to change our dinner reservations at Delmonicos to 8:30.. that place ROCKS!  Terrific service and wonderful food.  Not cheap mind you but it didn't kill us to spurge a bit on us.

We eventually went to the Bellagio for some chocolate at Jean Philippe Patisserie.  They have an incredible chocolate fountain and the sweets are to melt for.

Slept in on Saturday, went shopping for a gift for Peanut and then lounged by the lazy river for a few hours.  Lots of drunk or getting drunk college kids at the pools.  They were highly amusing.  Dinner was at a yummy oyster bar in Harrah's.  Then off to the Palm's Lounge to see the Playboy Comedy Tour.  All but one of the comedians were very funny.  Unfortunately no Playboy Bunnies showed up so the Hubby was a wee bit disappointed.

All in all it was a fun trip and a much needed get away."

This morning was a huge fit just to get him out of bed.  Hubby had to literally drag him out and stand him up, all the while he's crying about how tired he is, and starts to yell about waking up at 1:00am.  Hubby was losing his cool so I stepped in and became the voice of calm and reason (I know, go figure) and I managed to get him into the shower, continuing to talk to him about calming down, taking a deep breath.  I helped him wash his hair but leaving every so often to give him time to start calming down on his own.  

Then out of the shower and into some clothes.  He started to head to the other extreme of guilt and recrimination, 'I'm a jerk, I'm a bad seed, etc... I headed that off at the pass and got him to the counter for breakfast.  But I am also trying to explain to him what is happening with his body, the odd aches and pains the mood swings, and to hopefully get him to the place where he can maybe recognize when the HUGE mood swing is starting and to stop it or at least lessen it.

He has cried more in the past 4 months than in the past 4 years.

"event","I don't know how it happened, but this past Friday we came home with not one, but two new kittens.  I'd plead insanity but it is truly my fault as much as Hubby and Peanuts fault too.  I could never work at an animal shelter because I'd want to ring all of them home and love them.  It's a wonder we didn't end up with a dog too after touring the animal shelter.  

We have yet to rename them.  They are currently called Boots & Jelly Bean but those name do not quite fit their personalities.  They are both back with white feet and some white around their noses and are about 2 months old.

Boots is the girl and she is fearless and demanding.  She will nip at your toes or fingers if you do not pet her.

Jelly Bean is very skinny and a bit more laid back but has no problem holding his own against his sister.

Imp, our cat of three years is SERIOUSLY put out at this whole thing and doesn't seem to understand that we did this for him.  After Suzy left us, he seemed lonely.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

Here are some of the names we are contemplating:
Hoops & Yoyo
Thunder & Shadow
Pete and Repete
Nipper and Zipper

Of course it is cats I am talking about and ""here Kitty, Kitty"" pretty much suffices for most cats.  Although Imp will come when we whistle.  We have trained a couple of our cats to do that.  Beats using an electric can opener to get them to dinner."

Thankfully my fears were not realized and the place was actually not crowded, even for a Labor Day holiday weekend.  They had a wave pool, a lazy river and numerous types of very tall, drop down into some dark tube raft rides.  Of course Peanut and Hubby loved these rides.  I enjoyed them but they are too similar to roller coasters for my taste.  I tend to enjoy the lazy river (MGM Grand in Las Vegas is awesome!) and the wave pool was fun too.  We went the additional expense and rented a cabana for the day and it was well worth it.  Lots of shade and I actually got to nap.  A nice time was had by all!"

This summer he has grown some and his appetite is off the charts some days and nonexistent others.  But the emotional outbursts have been a big roller coaster this year.. OMG.  Most often happening around bedtime between he and his father, over the littlest things.   Last night was over the quality of his tooth brushing.  You'd have thought we had asked for him to be carted off to jail!  Then once the outburst is done comes the woeful remorse.

We have moved his bedtime back to hopefully allow for more sleep, we have moved any sugar to the mid-day time and lessened it. (not that he was allowed much anyway) and we are trying to remain calm when he is not.  Not an easy thing to do.

Can it be puberty already?  I'm not ready for this yet."

"event","All last week was cub scout camp.  Now normally that is not something to write about, but this year the Hubby and I were involved up to our eyeballs in it.  Earlier this year it was clear that the previous directors of this camp were done and someone new was needed to step up to the trap.. I mean, the bait.. oh hell.. no one was coming forward to do this. It is a huge time hole that is hard to do with no pay.  You do it for the kids.

First Hubby and a friend went off for a weekend in Petaluma to a scout camp training camp to learn now to be a camp director and a program director.  Then they came back full of ideas and started the hard work of recruiting volunteers to help out with everything from crafts, BB gun, archery and swimming.  Now that is where I came in.  Being related by marriage to the director pretty much meant I would get some sort of staff position or at least the title of 'the player to be named later'.  I started out in charge of registration, since my biggest beef about the opening day of camp, was the lack of clear organization to get the kid to his right den.  Then I was given the title of business manager as well.  We had no idea what that job would be mind you, but for now, it was an empty title.  Then the previous lifeguard said she was not coming back since she was too busy moving.  Well we then added another hat to my head as well as a whistle.  I had my doubts but it was for the kids.

I have very fond memories of several summers being at an away Girl Scout swim camp and I know how much fun the Peanut has had at the previous years camps, so how could I say no.. and the Hubby was the director... no way in Hell I could say no.

But for all the exhausting work that went into the preparation of camp, it went swimmingly... yes, pun intended.  I am very proud of Hubby.  He worked very hard and had a great bunch of volunteers who worked hard too.

Why did we do this?  That's easy... for the kids."

"event","Today, Hubby, The Peanut and I walked the Wharf to Wharf.  Last year Hubby ran it in little under an hour.  This year at the last minute he decided to walk it with us and be a team!  Thanks goodness he did that, because I might have jumped into the ocean along the way.  6.2 miles!  I have trained but have only gotten up to 3 miles and have had no time to train the past 2 weeks due to all the work leading up to next week's cub scout day camp. (more on that later).

My feet are no longer speaking to me, but we did it in 2:12:44.  I was really aiming to get in at 2 hours or a little under, but we stopped along the way to drum with a local taiko drumming group.  The Peanut is an avid drummer!  This race has lots of music stations along the way, with bands doing Rock, Reggae Soul etc.. there was even a Ukulele group too.  Since this winds thru residential areas many homeowners have their garden hoses out and are happy to spray you with water.  Thank goodness for that, since the race folks were lax in having enough water stations.

I don't know if I will do it next year.  I had heard that last year there were complaints about the lack of water and this year seems to not have fared much better.  My only other complaint was the lines for the bus were almost 1 mile long.  But the weather was terrific and the race fun and we made it thru!"

Last night we went to see Transformers.  Now I was a bit reluctant to go but I am so glad The Peanut talked me into it. (actually what he did was make the Puss N'Boots face and I caved).  I loved the movie!  The special effects are awesome.  This is nothing like the animated version of Transformers at all.  It does have some teenage content so beware of you are taking the less than 13 year-olds.  I would even see it again.

Now tonight Hubby and I went out to dinner at a relatively new place in Santa Cruz, called Hula's Island Grill & Tiki Bar.  We really enjoyed it and I love a place than can make a decent ahi poke outside of Maui. The Hubby enjoyed the mongolian beef bowl and I had the seared ahi with wasabi sauce.  It is a little pricey but not a bad splurge for a rare night out."

a rabbit.  Yes, folks, I opened the shades to the back door this morning and he was chowing down on a gray fuzzy bunny.  I sighed, closed the shades and promptly told Hubby he would have to deal with it.  ""Later."" I was told since Hubby had to get to work.

A few minutes later The Peanut yelled, ""He's burying it!""  Another sigh issued forth from me as I peeked out the kitchen window to indeed see Imp, trying to cover the bunny up with bark.

The pile is still there and I have no desire to deal with it.  Nope.. I'm not usually squeamish but I just do not want to deal with it.  I can only be grateful that I didn't witness the take down of the cute and fuzzy bunny.  Imp is akin to a lion as he chases his prey, growling at it as it darts all along the back yard and then he changes from ferocious king of the beasts, to a court jester, as he catches it and juggles the poor victim, tossing it with glee and almost doing back flips himself with pure animal joy."

"event","The day starts out like any other day.. too early.  Up by 6:15am, (silly of me to have not gone to bed until 1:00am and then there was that wrong number at 2:00am) we stopped by the local fire department's pancake breakfast (great way to carbo load for the upcoming adventure) and off we went to Moss Landing and to kayak.  This is what The Hubby wanted to do for Father's Day.  We were quickly checked-in, got the basic gear on (PFD, skirt) told the basics of paddling and off we went down to the docks to get in the water.

Hubby and I have kayaked only once before, and that was briefly in Morro Bay.  But it was enough to show us we enjoyed it and wanted to try more of it.  That time was a double seat... this time we had The Peanut with us, so Peanut wanted to ride with Daddy, and that left me with the single seat.   I can sum up my day in 2 words... ""Hard Work""

Now please, don't get me wrong.  I loved it all.  Moving with the tide, skimming by otters, seals, sea lions and dozens of different birds.  It was the coming back AGAINST the tide, with a 'let's push you backwards' wind, that made my arms ache and my shoulders threaten to fall off into the water and take their fate with the seals.

At one point a small boat was moving by me and I stuck my thumb out to hitch a ride.  They found my actions highly amusing and did offer a tow back, but I decided that at the expense of my aching arms, my pride dictated I finish the way I started. 

I won't even get into the getting out of the tippy kayak...suffice it to say, grace is not my first, middle or last name.  But I did make it out and not fall in, which was truly my (personal) ultimate goal. 

What was important, was that Hubby had a great time and he did.  The Peanut now has another nickname.. Windmill arms.. and we had some great family fun.

I'm turning on the hot tub now.  Thankfully, I do not need to lift my arms for that."

As the previews were starting he was wiping his hands on a napkin for 5 minutes.  One would have thought he was using sandpaper by the scraping noise it made.   A few weeks ago, it was the elderly lady behind us with a breathing apparatus that made rasping noises very time she exhaled.  Now of course no matter how annoying the sound was I could not complain.  She has a right to see the movie as much as anyone, but the folks who kick the back of my chair repeatedly, open up the glaring light of their cell phones to check their messages and just generally have bad manners bug the crap out of me.

Now granted on some days, bugging the crap out of me is not a difficult thing to do, but I do try to be patient and easy going for the most part... but... I am paying a small fortune to go to the movies and I want to be entertained not constantly bothered by people who think this public forum is their home.

"event","Way back, when I was about 8 years old, I went to the zoo in Wheeling West Virgina.(Oglebay Park)
 I can remember being fascinated by the peacocks in this beautiful wrought iron aviary but I was disappointed that the male birds (doesn't it figure the guys get the lovely plumage) were not showing their beautiful feathers.  The zookeeper said that they would only do it to impress the female birds and if he heard the right sound.  So I felt it a challenge and stood there until I could mimic the female peahens and get the male peacocks to plumage out.  

Well all through my life I have had animals do odd things like that around me and I usually have not thought anything about it.  A killer whale at the old Marine World just coming up on the deck... hummingbirds coming within inches of me and a dragonfly who thought I was his new buddy.  But the latest is the male quail in our backyard.  He's new to the whole covey thing since he currently only has one female he can boss around.  I guess he feels he needs some more since he has been hanging out and just the other day decided to land a few feet away from me and make his little noises and plump out his chest at me.  Now of course he could just be trying to assert his authority and scare me off but if you know anything about quail they are fairly timid birds and spend much of their day scurrying around from hidey hole to the next.  

This evening as I was turning off the sprinklers, it was a veritable UN of birds in the back yard, blue-jays, redheaded woodpeckers, finches and quail.  Lucky them Imp the cat was no where to be seen."

"event","During my son's spring break we drove to Las Vegas.  We had a room special with Hilton Grand Vacations and only had to allot some time to listen to them try and sell us a time share.  The 1 bedroom suite was very nice and the hotel is situated at the end of the strip near the Stratosphere.  All the major hotels have free parking so it was easy to drive to the other hotels.  Normally I don't recommend driving because the strip can be packed and take forever just to go a few blocks.  The first night we went to the Bellagio.  I wanted Hubby and The Peanut to see the chocolate fountain at Jean Philippe Patisserie and the Botanical Gardens.   Both are incredible.  I had seen the gardens in a Fall setting back in October but the Spring setting was incredible and the smell of the flowers was wonderful.  And of course hitting a few well paying slots while waiting for a table at the buffet was not bad either.

The next day we did some swimming.  But not for long since the wind had really kicked up and was really beginning to whip around the tall hotel buildings.  That night we took The Peanut to see the Blue Man Group.  if you ever have the opportunity to see them perform, do so.  An incredible show.  I think I enjoyed watching his reactions as much as the show itself.  We had second row just left of center seats which also included ponchos.  Everyone put them on but they really were not needed.

We decided to extend our trip an extra day, but the Hilton could not accommodate us. (Maybe if we had said yes to the time share they might have).  But we found a nice deal at the new MGM Signature. Lovely place, even if they did charge us for 3 nights instead of one. They did fix the mistake but it took a couple of days.  Money always goes out quicker then when it has to go back in.  We also took a drive out to see the Hoover Damn. (Of course i got to suffer 'damn' jokes all day too. I mean come on, a 10 year old that finally gets to use the 'damn' word often...who wouldn't take advantage of it)  But it was a great tour and really a modern marvel of its time.

We have stayed at the MGM before and had a great time there.  The lazy river pool is the best thing ever.  Makes up for the fact that their slots don't pay at all. (stick to Bellagio and Caesars for slots).  I did try my hand at some Blackjack and walked away with a profit.  Now that is saying something considering I am terrible at it. 
I really want to try my hand at Texas Hold'em.  

We have been to Las Vegas several times and have really enjoyed ourselves.  Yes, the cigarette smoke can get to you and the vast amount of people and of course there is the heat at times.  But I think the thing I enjoy the most is the people watching.  What draws people to this place in the middle of a frying pan?  I would not live there if you paid me, but it is still one of the fastest growing cities in America.

All in all a good time was had by all.  Well okay so the wind was so bad on the way back that several highways were closed... especially the one that would have saved us 2 additional hours of driving... oh well. We still slept well, ate well and got along.  Not bad at all."

I am very much looking forward to a big harvest this year and of course sending a lot of produce to my neighbors."

Yesterday there were 2 different types of Blue Jays, some Quail, Robins, Sparrows, Finches, Chickadees, and Red-Headed Woodpeckers flying in for a brief repast and then zooming off.  I imagine our cat thinks he has died and gone to heaven.  We have provided him with a buffet of delicacies to choose from.  What good parents we are.... or on the other hand, one can imagine what the birds must think of us?"

"event","I think one of the hardest things to do is to sit back and watch someone you love go down the black hole of life (again) and not be able to show them the way out.  I understand how easy it is to wallow in the 
self-pity and doubt.  It is safer there than it is with everything laid bare.  I am watching one of my brothers go thru this yet again and I am torn between heading north to try and get him out of the hole and staying home and offering only words of advice.  He is soon to be 40... how do you tell a 40 year old man to get his head out of his ass (again) and save himself?  You can lead a horse to water....
  

He has 2 adorable children that saved him once before but even the thought of their quiet desperation is not enough to pull him up this time.  My parents, have bent over backwards more times that I can count and eventually they have had to pull back less they get dragged down with him.

He is a bright and talented artist, musician and an incredibly patient father to his boys.  But for as long as I can remember he has always thought ""woe is me.""  The world is out to get him.  He has been lost before and fought his way back but this time I do not know if he can.

I can only hope that telling him he is loved and needed is enough to help him over this hump and to stand tall."

"event","This morning I awakened at 3am for some unknown reason.. perhaps it was the fact that I was thinking about waking up early to see The Peanut off on his field trip, or the pain in my lower back from too much gardening.. or the call of the bathroom...but for some reason I could not get back to sleep so by 4am I was up and perusing the lack of TV at that hour (I was too sleepy to make the Comcast thing work).  

By 4:30, I was frying some bacon and brewing a nice cup of earl grey tea.  The Peanut wandered out, with sleepy eyes and haystack hair, hugged me and said, ""I knew I could count on you.""  I think he had been concerned that I would oversleep and make him late for the drop-off of his big 2 nights away trip to the north to pan for gold.

It was still dark when we went out the door but by the time I dropped him off in town and waited to wave the kids off, the sky had lightened.  There was very little traffic (other than the expected deer) along the road and I was reminded of the many trips my family took together.  We always left at o'dark early and had breakfast a few hours down the road.  I saw the sun rise many times on my trips from WV to FL.  I recently discovered a couple of places in FL on the Internet.  One is still up and running (and I am sure totally changed  http://mermaid.weekiwachee.com/index.php?&MMN_position=1:1) and another one relegated to memories. (http://www.lostparks.com/fland.html).

"event","The Hubby and I took the last few days for ourselves, (Thank you Grandma Baba) and went to Solvang.   In the past we have usually gone to Mendocino, but this time I wanted to see something different.  I have to say if I were to move again (which I will not - EVER) (I hate moving but that is a whole different post) I would live near Solvang.  The town is lovely as are the surrounding Santa Ynez Mountains.  We stayed at the Wine Valley Inn and Cottages.  Our room was a jr. suite with loft bedroom.  Very nice but the bathroom was way too small.  We had some great dinners and did lots of walking around and shopping. 

 We even went to the De-stress cafe for massages.  Before we left on this adventure The Hubby had hurt his back.  He had been in so much pain the day before we were scheduled to leave that he even took a muscle relaxer.  This is a man who was in some PAIN cause I can count the number of times he has taken even aspirin on one hand in the 12 years we have been together.  But thankfully our chiropractor fixed him right up.  Between the adjustment, the massage and my driving down (ack) he was much better."

I am sitting at the computer and my head almost swivels around completely when I hear that question.  Who said that?  Wasn't me.  It was my husband.

""No,"" I said, and I am not saying any more than that.
He natters on about underwear sizing being off etc.. and I somewhat tune him out (sorry HB) and continue perusing my emails.

""Do I have a J.Lo. Butt?""  Again my brain stumbles and I am wondering who is this man and what have you done with my husband? 

""No.""

""Whats' the big deal about her butt?""

""I don't know."" I am really trying to get thru my emails and this conversation is about to head into surreal zones.  ""I guess it's because her butt is shapely... I couldn't say.""  (I never should have said a word)

""So you're saying my butt isn't shapely?""

I am now resisting the urge to bang my head on the keyboard.  Now I understand how the guy feels when the shoe is on the other foot... or the undies are on the other butt.

Do not even try you will not win."

Okay, I know I am lucky that it is only cold and not dropping ice and blizzard conditions here in the Santa Cruz Mountains, but I am loosing plants left and right here folks.  (not to mention the entire citrus crops of CA are now mostly orange popsicles)

It was about 5 degrees in Central Oregon the other day.  I know it is colder than here but I don't live there,  This morning, my neighbors roof looked like it had snow on it, there was so much frost.  Thankfully I do not have to go anywhere until later so therefore I do not have to scrape ice off of my windshield.  

I keep dreaming of Maui.  Balmy breezes, warm, blue water and if it does rain, it is warm too.

"event","Many blessings to one and all for the new year!

I have never been one to be excited about celebrating the new year. I'm not sure why.  Perhaps it was far too many of those New Year eves with no one to kiss at the stroke of midnight or it was the number of things that were new different the next day.  Perhaps it was all the well intended resolutions I, and many others would spew forth and fail to accomplish?  I do not know.  I am not going to make any resolutions this year.  But what I am going to do is make a list of 50 things I want to accomplish in my life, such as getting published to trying to be a better Mom and wife.  Things that are not confined to a resolution but to a better state of being within myself.  Far too often I have felt that life has past me by or has more control over me than I do.  I intend to remedy this... one day at a time... and with the help and love of my family and friends.

Happy New Beginnings to us all!"

You're the one who has the most fun. People are attracted to you because you don't pretend to be anything but what you are. You know you are attractive and like to play on that - which makes you even sexier. However, when it calls for you to be serious, like Rita, you need to know that only hard work will get success.

"event","A lot has happened recently that I haven't updated about. I was too upset to update last week. Tony cheated on me and it hurt a lot. It still hurts but we're working our problems out. I'm trying to be more aware and fulfilling of his needs. I hope its working because I can't loose him. I wouldn't know what to do if I did.

I'm also now in Finland with Billy. He needs someone to take care of him. He's been my best friend for so long I'd feel too guilty if I didn't help him out in his time of need since his selfish prick of a husband is off doing whatever it is he does.

If you need me call, I'll answer."

"event","I thought our life was going good.. I knew we weren't the same as before Sid was born but I still thought things were okay. I was so fucking wrong.

I know when Nancy died things got fucked up. I know that when we figured out that I got drunk and drugged and ended up with a miscarriage that things got even more fucked up. I didn't know that it would lead to this though. This is never what I wanted.

I cried myself to sleep last night, cuddling his pillow as close to me as humanly possible. I called Joel.. he took some time away from horse-teeth to come visit me. He's watching his nephew who he adores. He   held me a little last night or this morning, I'm not entirely sure when. I just know I woke up and he was in bed with me trying to calm me down. 

You blame me and I blame you but really I don't know who's at fault completely here. I hate you for doing this to our family but I love you. At least I didn't willingly sleep with another man and not just any man, a fucking asshole at that. 

I wish we could go back in time to when we first met since thats apparently when I fucked things up royally for us. 

Whatever.

I'm wondering if its even worth the fight anymore."

"event","one would think that inviting another man in their bed is a bad thing for a relationship.. let me just tell you that its not. Not only are threesomes fucking fun as hell and amazing and hot and oh god.. but they brought out the sex life that Tony and I once had. 

I'm walking funnier than I ever have in my entire life and I feel like I've stretched enough that I can fit him in without any help from lube and stuff."

"event","apparently when i went out 3 months ago to the bar I slept with some guy. I wouldn't have ever slept with anyone willingly so I guess I was rapped or something. I dont remember the night at all. All I know is I had a miscarriage and its the worst experience in the world. I can now relate to Tony in a horrible way.

I dont want to talk about it. I just want to crawl into a dark cave and never come out.

I'm so sorry Tony."

"event","Things are slowly starting to get better. Slowly. When we went to go see Sid yesterday he had his eyes open. He seemed to respond to us a lot. He looked worried about Tony when he was getting upset, and he held onto Tony's finger tightly and he seemed to try to move it.

He's our boy and he's strong. I know he's going to be fine. I wish we didn't have to wait for him to come home but its for the best. I think he's suprising his doctors already though. I haven't talked to them yet. I just have talked to Tony and the nurses about our baby.

We're going to go see him in a little bit. He seems happy when we're there."

"event","As you've probably read in my baby's overly fluffy loving adorable post we're having <font size=""4""><B>TWINS!!!</B></font>

I'm really hoping for a girl and a boy but honestly I dont care what sex they are just as long as they're healthy. I'm really happy that we're having twins and thats not just because I am one but I know what its like to be completely alone in the world but you have your twin there to help, and you realize that you're not completely alone. You realize that there is a part of you that is right beside you and their arms are around you tightly as you cry softly. The worst part of being a twin though is when they actually leave you. Now I'm not entirely sure how often this happens but Joel basically has left me. I need him here with me and he's not. He's out in hollywood fucking horseteeth and it bothers me to no end.

I started seeing a therapist as most of you know. She's helping a lot. The last time I spoke to her I didn't cry like I did the first time. I did get a little antsy for tony to come home and when he did I made him make love to me. I'm so lucky that I have a fiance that understands how much I need him. I'm so afraid of our past catching up with us again sometimes and thats part of the reason why I'm doing the therapy. I need to work these issues out and I am. Tony's coming to most of the sessions with me but there are the few times when I have to call.

I haven't ever been as happy as I am at this moment, even with the doubts I have in my head. I have Tony, and I have our children on the way, and I have amazing friends, Billy, Ville, Bam, Lauri, Frankie, and Steffy. Then of course my other friends who I dont get to speak to as often as I would like, you know who you are and I'm sorry.

I dont know where my mind is.. all I can think about is Tony's last statement in his post, that he's horny... SO with that I'm going to go and find him, though he posted hours ago I'm sure he's still ready for his future hubby as he now refers to me as."

I seem to be pampering him a lot and I love every second of it. I dont know what I would do without him.

We have a child on the way. I can't wait. I'm dying for the day that I can hear his or her heartbeating. I'm already talking to it and kissing Tony's tummy. My world is finally perfect. I couldn't ask for anything more."

I've decided to play a drinking game with myself that I found on the internet earlier. I shouldn't drink but I am bored as fuck and no one is entertaining me. Tony will be pissed when he wakes up but hopefully I can make him calm. I love him too much.

If anyone wants to party with me come join. If not then fine be that way."

Tony I love you so much babe. :*

Ville - We gotta talk hun. So much greatness.
Billy - I broke it. We gotta talk so that we can fix it kind of.
Frankie & Lauri - I'm glad I decided to not be a complete ass tonight. You've both shown me something amazing.

We're back from Japan now which is super nice in a sense but in the same sense its not nice at all and I'm going crazy, I can't even imagine what its like to be him. I fuckin did our laundry for the first time since we've been back together. I feel like a fucking housewife but its all good cause I would so do that for him. However I will not do laundry when we come home together in March. He can do it or we can pay to have someone do it.

I'm getting very sleepy and Tone's all laying there on his bed and looking so comfy and yeah."

"event","Joy made me update my journal again.  Went to my job thingy that they called me for.  It appears that my ""as needed"" position, isnt needed... poo... Oh well, my father has graciously offered to put me to work here so that I can earn the money to pay for my utilities and car insurance next semester.  Right, so beyond powerwashing, painting, and sleeping, I have no life.  Thus is fate, with its cruel twists and turns.  Anyhow, getting involved in my youth group, so thats a good thing.  I hang out with a couple of the guys from there every once in awhile.  Movie notes: If you havent seen Pirates of the Carribean, GO DO IT NOW!!! That moive rocks, Jonny Depp is hilarious.  If you havent seen LXG.... DONT cuz its really not that great, definately not worth $8... although Sean Connery is my all time favorite actor.  Sean, my boy, he let me down on this one... how could he sign on for that movie?!?  Cool special effects though.  WELL SIR off with me, ADIOS"

"event","OOOOOKKKKK so I did say I was going to keep this thing updated... obviously I lied.  Actually for all my dedicated readers out there (haha) you have my friend Joy to thank for the most recent entry.  AHEM where was I?  Right O' Life Of Dave!!!  Just got back from Peachtree City, visiting my friend Christina.  (for all of you non-Georgia residents, there are about a billion ""Peachtrees"" in Georgia... roads, cities, songs, everything.  Anyhow, we had tons of fun!  Christina rocks, and her little sister, who is 10, rocks too!  (I think her little sister wants to adopt me)  Ah yes, and a new experience for me... chocolate Fondu.  Thats pretty cool, grab random food,and dip it in chocolate using a poker-fork thingy that looks like it came off of Satan's table.  And another thing, in Peachtree City (henceforth known as PTC) EVERYONE has golfcarts.  A golfcart is like a second car, there are golfcart paths all over the place.  Furthermore, PTC has TONS of cops, I swear its like 2 cops to 1 other profession, and they are not above writing tickets to golfcart drivers.... its pretty goofy if you ask me.  *Big Huge YAWN* soo tired... ok, im going to bed, so I suppose I could say that I'll write again soon, but there really is no garantee of that so I'll just leave it to fate, luck, and bordom.

'NIGHT ALL!"

"event","OOOOOKKKK so its been what, like 4 months since my last entry, and about a year before that... oh well.  The point is, im back now and i guess i will try to use this journal thingy a little more often... (knock on wood)  Just to bring yall up to date, my first year of college was awsome, University of Oklahoma rocks. I made it onto the paintball team, which is also pretty cool.  If you take the time to look, you just might see me in some magazines before my 4 years is up.  Take notice of my earlier use of the slang ""yall"" which has relevence because I now reside in the great state of Georgia, which is considerable south of my former residence, Maryland.  I just got back from visiting all my friends in Maryland, that was a blast.  Went to the ocean, hung out with the paintball guys.  WOO HOO.  Yeah, dont expect me to use paragraphs, cuz i am WAY too lazy to do such a thing.  Anyhoo, i really dont know why i am writing this, i have no links to it on any IM profile, everyone of my friends who USED to look at it dont know it still exists, and i am probably not attracting too many fans from the online community present with my fairly normal and uneventful life.  Eh, the things i do to alleviate bordom.

So to the random encounterer and wayward browser i bid adieu
Dave

OOOO look at all the new moods and stuff they have since i was on last.  Oh im SO easily amused"

"event","Apparently I have an online journal.  I didnt think that this still existed.  I guess I had better write a little something to all of my concerned readers LOL!  First off, I would like to eat it about an earlier journal entry in reference to my not wanting to go to college in Georgia.  I actually ended up going to Georgia for the first semester.  However, it sucked....... bad....... so now im attending University of Oklahoma.  YaY!  Hanging out with my cousins and whatnot.  I LOVE IT HERE!  Its SOOO much better than Mercer in Georgia.  Anyhow, planning on taking a cruize to the Carribean for spring break, thats just after my Cutie comes to visit me!  By the way, i have a new cutie, cant remember if i had one before.  Luv ya Cutie!  OK BYE"

"event","Right.  For all of my faithful readers (HAHA, YEAH RIGHT) ahem, sorry i have not updated my journal for awhile.  I have been very VERY busy.  Last week, my parents went away for a few days so my brothers and i were left to fend for ourselves.  Now, fortunately for my parents, we are very good children, and thus no wild parties or the sort were thrown.  However, we did have to do all of our own laundry and cooking.  Coupled with the fact that i had to work every day that week cut down on my free time.  BUT! Now my parents are home, and everything is back into swing.  What will i do when i go to college?  I guess i will have to learn to do all this stuff by myself.  Oh well.  Anyhow, i have ordered my new paintball gun, it is on the way.  If all works out as it should, then i wont lose any money, infact, i will make a little.  Now all i have to do is sell my old gun, so come buy it!  More paintball news....im playing in a tourny on March 23, rookie division, i feel so bad cuz i am gunna be shooting little kids.  MUHAHAHAHA.  Last tourny we played we did good, and that was novice so rookie should be no challange.  I just hope the guys i am playing with are good, cuz i have never played with them before, they just needed an extra player.  If you have ever heard of the game DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION, which is awesome, i got it in my house.  YEA!  I was playing it for way too long today.  Well, until next time!

"event","Yeah, its late.  So the wages at the paintball store have become official.  I get an actual pay check, can you believe it.  More paintball news, sold my gun, but im playing in a tournament sometime in March.  So, where will i get a gun?  Who know! BUT I WILL!  Right on. (which is my phrase of choice for awhile)  Still trying to decide where to go to college.  I think i will be going to a smaller, liberal arts college.  That seems to fit my major the best.  My parents are angry that i will not be attending ANOTHER college visit next weekend.  Sorry, but i am all colleged out.  Oh, and as far as i can tell, everthing has turned out OK with my personal life, im telling you this as if you cared.

"event","Right, well back from Georgia.  13 hours in the back of a Lexus with my 2 brothers......  TORTURE.  Somehow, I survived.  Visited mad colleges, that was cool.  They were all really nice, but i am still undecided as of now on where to go.  I will cross that bridge when it arrives.  Other than that, not much happened.  Because this is an online journal, and basically anyone can read it (this is the point of an online journal) i am going to abstain from placing certain details of my very personal life into this entry.  All i have to say is i have GREAT friends, who support me no matter what.  And things seem to be working out for the best. 
 Laterz

"event","For all you ""Dave"" fans out there, and no, NOT DAVE MATTHEWS, ahem, sorry.  I am going away for the weekend.  Yep, thats right, all weekend.  Im going to Georgia to visit some colleges which is actually a waste of my time because i really dont plan on going to any colleges in Georgia anyway.  But, in the intrests of pleasing my father, i will go.  Plus, i hear that they have some good paintball places down there.  Well, it is late and i bid you adieu until my return, which will be tuesday.  And yes kelly, i plan on living, breathing, eating, and dreaming about paintball when i sleep, for an ENTIRE WEEK at the start of the summer.  Seriously though, if anyone out there actually has any questions about paintball, then email me and ask away.  But i suspect that it is jsut my buddies who are reading this and i know they really dotn care about my favorite sport/hobby   *tear*.....

"event","OK, so heres the deal.  I will never be writting entries on Wensdays, cuz i work and i have homework to do when i get home.  I dont really ever do all my homework, but im not a complete slacker.  Just so you know, I work at a paintball store.  I LOVE PAINTBALL.  I actually think that is what i am going to do for Senior Week.  Me and some friends are kinda planning on driving to Illinois, or some other paintball capital and just play ALL WEEK LONG.  That sounds like much more fun than going down to Ocean City, where all there is to do is go to the dirty, dirty beach, go to parties and get smashed, or have drunken sex don't you?  Oh yeah, and there is less chance that i get arrested, beat up, mugged, or , worst of all, forced to pay child care for the remainder of my life."

"event","As previously stated by Kelli, i think she will regret giving me the code for this.  MUHAHAHAHAHA  Anyhow, I have learned my first valuable lesson in the use of this program.  That is that some people, however much they may need it, do not deserve high quality advice and good natured encouragement.  I gave a nice comment to some girl, whose life seemed to be troubled, and she totally shot me down, called me a ""bumbling mumblebutt"" or something equally gay.  needless to say i retracted my comment.  On a side note, those of you who know that I lost my Microbiology book and thus missed the double credit book check today, well I have recovered it.  It seems that i left it in the car on my way into school today.  DOH!  Oh well.  Its just a couple of points.
Until later

"event","This weekend was absolutly the most BORING weekend ever. i didnt really do ne thing at all. friday night i sat home and watched tv all night. there was just nothing to do. at all. saturday night me keri and jess went out to dinner at winghouse and saw jon and tannea and kristina josh and pudge.  then we left and went to kyles house for a little bit. i miss like us all hangin out and getting along. i wish jenn would still talk to me. i miss her. me and her used to be really good freinds. but i guess everyone always goes their separate ways. highschool sucks.. alot. josh scott is moving to pennslyvania.. im going to miss him alot. he was a really good freind to me..he was a better freind to me then someone whom i have trusted and grew up with since i was four years old. and what josh did for me really ment alot to me and i could never thank him enough for being there for me and actually not lieing to me like alot of people have done this year. i have prayed for him so much for him to find a steady home with people that love him and treat him like he is actaully someone. he deserves it more then anyone. i hate to see such a good person with such a fucked up life. i no kristen is going to miss him too. i no she is acting like she doesnt care but i no how she feels and i no that inside she is hurting alot bueucs she is losing someone she loves alot. and i no she is going to hurt for along time about him moving out of state. i hope the best for both of them.  this morning i took jessica down to the graveyard to see blakes stone this morning. its so unreal still. i no how she felt when she told me when she walked in to my house yesterday and told me how she just felt like somethign was missing. everytime she would come over my house blake was always the first one so say Heyyyy jessica.  u dont realize how the little things mean so much to you after they dont happen any more. this christmas is guna be a really hard one this year. its like we dont have a family any more. its just me and brandon now. i mean kellies here but shes all moved out and has a life of her own now.  right now i dont even think i wanna wake up on christmas morning. blake always used to wake me up. ""look what santa got you hurry"". so now i no right when i open my eyes xmas morning i am guna start crying. just cus i dont have that any more. i always feel so confused. like i still cant come to understand that blake it gone. i always think that only if blake was delayed even a second then the timeing wouldnt of been just right any more and he would of never flipped that 4 wheeler. when me and amanda got home that day from whereever we went. we were pulling in the driveway and blake came up to us and asked me f i wanted to ride his new 4 wheeler. and i said no. but i no if i owuld of riden it. he would still be here. i mean i just think of little thinks like that. like is his timeing was delayed a little bit he wouldnt of been in that postion at that time. but i no it was his time to go and god made it so he went quick and he died doing somethign he loved to do. <3 i miss that kid <3 :*("

"event","this is pretty bogus.. im sitting home alone on halloween. life is gay. really gay. after school today i went fishing with brandon. it was boring...really boring. its really weird between me and brandon. and i dont care what anyone thinks honestly. yea i do still talk to him and yea i still do love him. i sin against the lord and he forgives  me every day. and still loves me and even though brandon did me really wrong i am going to forgive him. just things wont ever be the same.and i do still love him. but i dont no. i always wonder that if i love him like i think i do.. how come i always look for more? like something better? i dont no. maybe its bucus i no i can get better. when im around him i feel so disrespected. just cus the fact that he hooked up with her. i think im bipolar and if not then i dont no whats wrong with him. its like one minute i can love him so much and just want to be in his arms and then the next i will think about it all and i will jsut hate him more then anything. i honeslty have prayed so many times that god would help me to never talk to brandon or think about him again. i wish i could find someone new. but its like its impossable. me and brandon always end up back togeteer.. like always and its jsut not waht i want in my heart.. i no my mind wants it. bucus im lonely and he fufills that feeling of needing to be held. but in my heart deep down when i am in his arms, i feel like i hate him. i no theres no way my heart could ever forgive him. but my freindship can. we can never have what we did b4. bucuase there is nothing between us but distrust. and without trust u reallydont have anything. but i mean.. without being with him. its the only way he talks to me. but o well theres really nothing i can do. i hate how everyone has no problem finding guys, but i never meet anyone. seriously i scare people away. saturday night at cjs house... b4 that brandon called me and was all like i love u blah blah u no that whole scene but then we he seees me at cjs.. its like he doesnt even know me. all he cares about is being around his freinds. he doesnt even want to be around me. i mean am i that bad? i mean if this is the way he makes me feel about myself then i no i can find better. but the problem is just finding someone.. i feel stupid. stupid and naive for still talking to him. and i do see it. and im so tired of everyone always saying shit. especially josh bucus hes such a backstabber and i can never ever look at him and think of a brother abut him ever again. because he knew about brandon and whitney the whole time. and it makes me jsut want to cry bucus someone who i have trusted my whole life betrayed me. i guess u never really know anyone. everyone u think u no and trust.. u dont .i really have no one to trust. but i guess i have no problem talking to god about all my problems bucus i no he listens. i no he probably thats the answers to all my questions right in my face but i just am so blind i dont see it. sometimes i think that by me finding out what brandon did was a sign from god that i shouldnt be with him. but my heart just avoid that answer bucuse i dont want it to be true. but deep down,i know its true. everytime i get done thinking, it always ends up at that same answer and i no it must be god trying to tell me. i jsut want to cry i feel so stressed. this is what this stupid kid does to me. i want more then him and i no i am better then this. i just no i am. i have to be. but i might not be if i keep running back to him.. my head is nothing but a big maze right now. everytime i get a new start i end up right back at the beginning. im lost in my mind and my feelings. Today blake was brought up alot today.. this morning on the way to school a song came on the radio and all i could do was sit there and look at his picture in my dash board and i just found my self crying. i miss him so much. then josh started talking about him.. then today in 5th period cardino came up to me out of no where and told me he was sorry about blake and told me to hang in there. it was so hard not to cry. :("

I miss having him there. i miss him. but then i think about all the stuff he did and it all turns quickly to hatred. its like i duno. u no how people say love is blind. it really is true. bucause i always put brandon higher then everyone. to me he was better then everything i loved him and he was my everything. and now its like i realize hes just like everyone else. hes just another guy that cheats on his gf with a slut. hes just another DOG that doesnt think. and im jsut another girl to him. just like all the other girls to him. i just want to put my heart in his chest and let him feel how bad i hurt. i want to let him see. and i want to say look brandon, look what u did to me. and this is how i feel. i want to show him how i feel but there is no possible way. i want him to feel the way i feel but he cant becuase i have never done nething so awful to him to make him feel so hurt. he was my first love. and the first guy who has ever cheated on me did absolutly everythign possble to bring me as low as he could. i jsut feel stupid. when he hung out with her i knew they did something. and he told me he didnt. and i belived him. bucus he looked me in the eyes. and it was unbelieveable. but i beleived him. and it was unforgivable but i forgave him. and he says its forgettable. but its not. and now im without him. and i guess he taught me alot. im sad. i want him to miss me but i no he doesnt. i jsut want to make him love me but i no i cant make someone love me for who i am not."

"event","man these last couple days have sucked. i feel like brandon has just ripped out every little peice of dignity in my heart and just crushed it. i hate haveing this little picture in my mind of him and whitney hooking up and kissing and stuff. i hate it more then i think words can express. I just have to keep telling my heart that he is replaceable..its weird for me to tell myself that. bucus i dont no i have always jsut thought that the world just wouldnt be right any more with out us 2 together. i have always thought that me and brandon just belonged to eachotehr because for some strange reason fate just had to have us together. and now that we are broken up it feels like my world jsut is wrong. nothings right anymore. when he told me he hooked up with her i jsut wanted him to say he was more sry then ever. i wanted to cry in his arms bucus of how badly i hurt. and i wanted him to care. i wanted him to tell me he was so sorry and that he made the biggest mistake of his life. i wanted him to tell me he loved me more then anything and that his world would end without me. i wanted him to glue back my broken heart. i wanted him to make things right again. but the only thing he could say to me while i cryed to him was .. ""o well we all make mistakes"".. Its so amazing how low a person can make someone feel. I have no more strength to fight back with him and day by day i just get brought lower and lower. i no that he will get back waht he gave to me. bucus hes drowning in guilt right now and sooner or later he will run out of air to breathe.
i hope that they both feel very acomplished . brandon not only made my whole world fall apart the minute he told me but he also through away the best 2 years of my life.he through it away for a one night slut. and whitney she has earned herself that official name of a slut to me and i can never ever look at her without disgust..disgust of how she is and disgust how ugly her heart is for what she has done. He can go date her now for all i care. he kissed her and to me ..he is apart of her now."

Last night i think i actually came to my senses and i think that after hangin out with brandon for a couple hours made me realize that i truely am an idiot.
I like always break up with him beucase i dont wanna be with him but then itsl ike he just gets me right back and last nigght i realized just what he was doing. he wants to be single and go party and do what ever he wants and have me on the side whenever he feels like it. and after that i was jsut like fuck this. im not doing it any more. i no i say this everytime but i hope this time i can be strong and actually get away from him. i think its just hard to be freinds with him bucus i dont no how. i only no how to be his gf. and i need to learn how to be his freind. everyone always tells me how silly he is and stuff and im jsut thinkin.. are we talking about the same brandon miller? cus i dont really even no how he is. i have never hung out with him to really know that hes fun and goofy. and thats the kind of people i like to be around. and i want to get to no that freindly part of his personality. cus i havent seen it yet. its like i am not happy when i am with him but im lost when i am without him. so really im screwed either way. but i think i am guna choose to be without him bucus i will eventually move on. itll take a while but ill happen sooner or later.

But the heartache lives on inside
And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight?

And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow wherever you go
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion taking me over
Caught up in sorrow
Lost in the song 
But if you don't come back 
Come home to me, darling
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world to hold me tight?
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight

I'm there at your side,
I'm part of all the things you are
But you've got a part of someone else
You've got to find your shining star

"event","*its funny sometimes how life can be. I just think these past 2 years have been the best for me. Highschool has definetly been fun and its amazing that i will be graduating next year. when i think about it its kinda like i have one more year left to be a kid. after that life actually starts. its kind of scary. like no more relying on parents to do everything for me . i will be away for college. paying my own bills .. doing evereything and it frightens me cus im growing up and its silly becasue i remember when i was little i couldnt wait to hve my lisence and go out and now its like i wish i was little again. if i could be live forever at any age i think i would live when i was 10. everything was completely perfect. my little brothers and i were best freinds. I didnt even have to hang out with my freinds outside school becuase me and my little brothers just played and played. raised cain down the hallway. and mom yelling at us to settle down and it hurts becuase i no nothing like that will ever happen again. we started off with 8 of us living and scott and amanda moved away.. blake died, kellie moved out and now there are 3 left and after next year ill be gone too. its jsut so crazy how a house full of so much life can just sudden die. all the happiness is gone. and i wish i could bring it back but without youth theres nothing but a house of complete maturity. i miss brandon. i miss having someone always there to just call. having that feeling of being complete and not lonly. but im trying to keep myself occupied. i really treid to avoid finding out what he was doing this weeknd cus i no everytime we break up the first thing he automatically does is go party. and i duno .. i feel like the past 2 years were all just fake. liek in the beginning it was cute how his freinds would come up to me and tell me he was talking about how much he liked me to them and stuff while they were in class. and everything died away over time and i guess our relationship and his feeling about me did to. like at the beginning he would call me all the time and ask me to hang out every chance he got. and now he never wanted to be around me and it was hard to cope with it but i guess u get used to it over time. It always ends up weird in the end. like i dont no how im guna be freinds with him. i dont think ill ever feel normal around him. cus ill always just have that automatic feeling of just putting my arms around him and hugging him bucus thats just what i no. and now its guna be werid hanging around him bucus i cant do that. and i mean i dont really want to either bucus thats not what freinds do and i just want to be normal freinds with him.. like how i am with any of my guy freinds. its jsut guna take a little time i guess to feel normal around him again. and i no eventually he will start dating again. but its ok bucus i will always love him. and i hope he will always atleast remember me. i mean i was his longest releationshop and maybe when he grows older he can look back and smile? i no i will. ill prob get butterflies too. but i guess thats just how i am. homecomoing is going to be weird now. like were going to be in the same bus with the same people nd jsut being around eachother will make me feel uncomfortable. i hope things turn out ok. but i duno maybe i shouldnt evenn go at all cus i no if i see him all oveer another gurl it will tear me apart. i no ill end up crying my eyes out by the end of the night. and seeing him slow dance with another girl. him look into another girls eyes with desire for her..knowing that before that girl used to be me but is no longer cus i was replaced. i duno its guna be hard. i dont think i want to go to homecoming any more."

Brandon comes back todya im so happy because i miss him so much. i havent seen him for like 3 weeks. <3 school is in like 6 days and i dont even have any school sclothes hardly... i have like 1 out fit which i cant wear till winter.. all the clothes i bought are like for winter. which sucks cus its soo hot out and i cant wear them. man o man i have to work tonight. it really does suck there. every one is so dum.. well all the hostess are. and i need to learn the computer really bad bvcus if i did maybe i would get more hours.. right now my hours totally suck but no other places i applied at havent called me back whch sucks bucus i want them to call me back i need a new job.!.
i miss blake. like lately its been getting to me alot. i had a dream last night that like he was alive and we were talking and he was being goofy like he always was. crackin jokes and stuff with his silly little laugh. i miss his laugh. it was beyond something someone could ever imitate. it was cute.i can only imagine the pain my mother feels. to lose a child. he died believing the tooth fairy, easter bunny, santa claus and now its just like im living in a house full of adults.. theres no laughter or playing.. no raising cain down the hallway with blake and brandon playing tag.. no more blake wakeing me up every single xmas morning at like 4 am telling me to get up look waht santa brought me. he was so excited. i could just see him glowing. nothing is ever guna be like that ne more. i mean its crazy the things u have and take for granted then they are taken away and youll do just about ne thing in the world to get them back.. even if it is having someone wake u up at 4 to tell u to get up to see what santa brought me..i would reallly do any thing. anything at all just to see blake smile at me again. i always wonder liek what hes doing up in heaven. and i wonder if he still has that same silly little personality he had before he died. and if hes stil the same person. and i dont care what anyone says or thinks. im goign to do what ever i can do get to heaven.. im guna see blake again. and it hurts me because i see all these really good people like al my freineds and its just so amazing how far apart they are from god. they are so spirtually dead and they dotn even no.. bucuse they dont have the understanding to know. and i duno.. i go around to my freinds trying to plant the seeds and i cant do ne more. .and its up to them to let the seeds grow and bring the lord into their lives.. but i guess its up to god who he wants to have mercy on.. i cant choose for him. but i can try to bring people to him in hope that when we all die he will have mercy and grace for all of us.. cus with out it we would all defineltly go to hell without a second thought.and everyone i no seems to think that just by being nice and being a good person will get them into heaven.. and it wont. and i wish people would actually care and read and go to church and learn.and while they die and are on there way to judgement they are guna think o i have nothing to worry about i was a good person when i was living.. and then when they get to the lord they are guna say o lord save me and he is just guna say i dont no u and send them right to hell. and no one can seem to understand that nor even think that..but ne way i guess god wanted blake back home. he was such a good person.. he always looked at everyone and found atleast one good thing in that person.. and i think thats what im guna start to try to do.. like when someone comes up to me im not guna look at them for their faults.. im guna find atleast one good thing i see in them.."

From beginning of creation i think our maker had a plan. For us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand. And let the good light guide us through the waves and the wind, to the beaches in a world where we have never been And we'll climb up on a mountain, yall we'll let our voices ring. Those whove never tried it, theyll be the first to sing..Whoa my my, Ill see you on the other side, if i make it.

Well you dont bring nothing with you here and you cant take nothing back. I aint never seen a hearse, with a luggage rack. So ive torn my knees up prayin,scarred my back from fallin down. Spent so much time flying high, till im face first in the ground. So if your up there watchin me could you talk to god and say, tell him i might need a hand to see you both some day. So ill meet you on the other side, if i make it. And it might be along hard ride,but im guna take it.

"event","to my friends..                  
                Portrait Of A Friend 

I can't give solutions to all of life's problems, doubts, or fears. But I can listen to you, and together we will search for answers.
I can't change your past with all its heartache and pain, nor the future with its untold stories. But I can be there now when you need me to care.
I can't keep your feet from stumbling. I can only offer my hand that you may grasp it and not fall.
Your joys, triumphs, successes, and happiness are not mine; Yet I can share in your laughter.
Your decisions in life are not mine to make, nor to judge; I can only support you, encourage you, and help you when you ask.
I can't prevent you from falling away from friendship, from your values, from me. I can only pray for you, talk to you and wait for you.
I can't give you boundaries which I have determined for you, But I can give you the room to change, room to grow, room to be yourself.
I can't keep your heart from breaking and hurting, But I can cry with you and help you pick up the pieces and put them back in place.
I can't tell you who you are. 
I can only love you and be your friend."

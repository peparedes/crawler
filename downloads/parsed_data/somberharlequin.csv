Ok so I haven't been doing much lately, so the main bit of news here is just an invite, my birthday party is on the 29th of October, meeting around 8:30pm at the walkabout brighton, everyone is welcome to come join and it will be fancy dress (if everyone else doesn't chicken out anyhow) So yeah, if you know where brighton is, and are stuck for something to do saturday night, come join.

What else to say, um nope I really haven't done anything of note recently.

That in itself is so depressing I may cry, ... relax I'm kidding, but am <B>REALLY</B> gonna have to motivate myself.

Cyas all."

Ok, so a few posts back i mentioned my addiction to a TV show called Firefly, I hope you have all been watching it? You haven't???

<B>Well now you can redeem yourself</B>

Last week a movie came out called... yeah you guessed it, Serenity.  It is the movie of Firefly and earlier today I saw it.  IT IS FAN-BLOODY-TASTIC.  I heartily suggest anyone with even the vaguest interest in Sci-Fi go see it. Heck even my <I>Mum</I> enjoyed it. nuff said.

Seriously though the movie is very good, it takes the best bits from the series (manic plot twists, witty dialogue, tense exciting combat scenes and River) and adds in larger budget CGI and a storyline two hours long.  Giving, in my opinion at least, one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.

K nuff with the movie review, what else have I been up to today, well finally got that bloody SORN thing sorted (I think), chatted to a load of my friends in Swansea (Hey again guys) and spent some time skateboarding round brighton seafront.  All in all a rewarding day methinks, now for tommorow must get firm job offers!

Meh that'll do for tonight, think i'll just veg for a bit, night all."

The last time I wrote here I had been working at BMF for a little over a week, um so since then unsurprisingly I have been mostly working, 80+ hours a week for very little money (its commision based) so as I'm not very good at sales (so it turns out) I was earning somewhere in the region of 50p per hour.

Guess what... yup thats right I quit.  Shame really, cos even with the long hours and lots of exercise, it was actually a really fun job and all the guys at BMF were really cool, if ur reading this guys I miss ya all already!

So yeah, I quit on wednesday and have been job hunting since then, got a couple of prospects but we'll see how that all goes i guess.

<I>Now the main point to my post, a question.</I>

Is it possible after meeting someone for a couple of hours, barely getting a chance to speak, to <B>know</B> that they are going to have a big impact on your life?  Or is any supposed knowledge from this mere delusion?

Answers on a postcard to... just kidding, but anyones response would be greatly appreciated in the comments section.

Been working at my new job for a grand total of two days, (with a cool bunch of people I must add) and I'm told we have a conference on friday, no biggie right?

Wrong

The conference is in Manchester, We are in Sussex, spot the problem?

So ... awake at 4am expecting to be picked up around 4:45, guess what?  The boss is late, so pickup at 5:45ish Could have stayed in bed another hour but never mind.  We drive to Manchester and get absolutely lost, but due to numerous pedestrians directions we get where we're going in the end (and almost on time 10:35).

Skip ahead a few hours to 6:00, we are leaving the conference, expecting to be home by 11ish, we take a couple of short detours, no real worries there, then hit the M25, ah.

Rather predictably the M25 had some problem or other that resultant in a section being shut down, FOR TWO SODDING HOURS!!!!! We ended up getting out the minibus and playing on the road!  After we escaped that one the journey home was mainly uneventful, I got back at the uncivilised time of 1:45am. Oh well eh?

To make up for it I have spent the rest of this weekend lazing :D but I have work tomorrow so I had better go to bed.

"event","O...k... where to begin?

Well as you can see from the date its been over two months since I last posted, life's been a little hectic since then so I'll slam here a quick overview and see where I go from there.

Well first up I got me a job in Swansea (as I mentioned in my last post) working in an HSBC call centre, originally I was on telephone debt collecting, a job that is most definitely NOT for the faint hearted.  Due to staff shortages I got bounced from department to department and now know just about everything there is to know about HSBC and its banking and lending policies.

About six weeks into working at HSBC I took a holiday, went to see my dad in the Ukraine (a long story from before I started blogging, basically my dad left my mum, met a Ukrainian girl and moved out there to live with her).  Twas a bloody good holiday, lots of cheap vodka, pretty girls and jet-skiing.  I also dated a pretty Russian girl who was on holiday there for a few days, alright yes she was a psycho at least she should be unable to stalk me now I'm back in the UK (though I am a little concerned that my sister and her boyfriend gave the girl my home address - erp!) but oh well it was fun.

Oh yes and I forgot to mention that for most of this period I was homeless, my contract had run out on my old house and finding non-student accommodation at short notice is apparently harder than it sounds. So I was staying in a combination of friends houses and b&b's (thanks again to everyone who put me up).

So this brings us up to three weeks ago, to summarise twelve weeks of being homeless, employed but forking out a fortune on accommodation and food (eating out 3 meals a day is expensive). To cut to the point I was fed up and decided to call it quits, really I could not take another night of staring around the cheapest b&b room I could find, bored s**tless and with most of my friends home for the summer or away on holidays.  I did what any self respecting man would do in that situation... I called for my mummy.

So now I'm back in Sussex for a while, dunno how long for yet, but its gonna be a while at least while I sort my finances.  On the plus side I don't have to lug my stuff with me everywhere I go AND I'm near the best city anywhere (well I think so) BRIGHTON baby!

Heck and in the last few days things have started looking up some more, got some hopeful prospects for jobs, and managed to get most of the electrical equipment in the house working (a minor miracle as mum and my sis seem to be able to fry a circuit board just by looking at it!)

So I'm back where I started from, but it's not so bad, in a way having been away for the better part of two years allows me to see it from a new perspective, so yeah life is good.

Right I'm gonna get some sleep

Night

p.s. Does anyone still read this or am I talking to myself, let me know if it's the former, cheers."

Right I think I need to explain a little of the past situation before I go into whats 'bugging' me.  My friend from back home has been crashing on my floor for the last year (I live in a student house) because he wanted to get away from our hometown, and planned to move up here and get a place, unfortunately the company he worked for folded as he moved leaving him in a bit of a bind, jobless and no large amounts of cash. since then hes been here trying to get himself a new job and recoup on his loss. Well we finally got the startings of a break (we hope) so should be just about ok.

Ok history lesson over kids and remember there may be a test,

The current issue is my housemates (well most of them but ill get to that in a sec) while my friend has had enough money to chip in for bills - an equal share, no skiving here - They have recently decided that he owes them all a rent rebate amounting to for the fact that hes taken up space, hmm hows that again.. yup because he sleeps on MY floor (when hes not round his gf's) he owe THEM money... right!

And thats not all, they decided this just over a week ago and want it before they go home, so they expect us to gather in 2 weeks and eat??? Ok so I don't agree that he owes them more money, but hes agreed to pay so that wouldnt really piss me off, what pisses me off is the timescale and the fact that they are so greedy they feel like its owed them and is a fault that it isnt paid up instantly, grrrrrrrrrr.

Well enough of the rant and I will state for the record that one of my housemates has come to us (wishing anonymity) and said not to bother with theirs cause they don't feel they've earned or deserve it.

Right I've ripped loose my rage etc hope i didnt bore anyone too much.

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">Right as I alluded to earlier <i> </i>do have some interesting news to share with my adoring audience *laughs* both of them anyway.  Well first the mundane stuff while I work out how to phrase the important bits, I have spent most the day revising and playing UT including some frantic online matches.

Ok enough of the wool gathering, I have a bit of an *interesting*  romantic situation goin on atm and I need to just spell it out to clear my thoughts, and where better frankly than the internet where anyone can read it and laugh at me. :pAnyhow a brief summation of this to get  goin

A few months back I met a girl who I was bloody interested in, now anyone who knows me will recognise this as my usual stae of affairs, of course she wasn't intersted in me. Well lately she has been showing interest and has admiitted to her housemate who is my roommates gf that she 'fancys' me. Well I of course was interested in this news but i have been warned that this could quite poosibly be just due to the fact that I'm not chasing her anymore.So what to do, what to do, well I am supposedly meeting her this saturday with Andy and Sophie for a friendly drink, so we'll see how it goes from there, a month (or in fact a few days) ago I would have been umm and ahhing trying to decide what to do, but a handy spirit guide type dream helped me realise that if I approach it accepting the fact that she may lose interest the instant I show any again means I may as well just go for it, have a laugh and hope for the best without wrapping melf up in knots.

Well that'll do for now cause i feel like I've typed an essay and I'm tired, feel free to reply with comments to either give advice or just laugh at me.

night night everyone

Really... ok ok after reading my old entries it took me at least 20 minutes to stop laughing, was I EVER that young??? Ok I am no even gonna try and do an overview of everything that has happened since my last basically I'm still at uni, still loving life, but STILL single. Ah well can't have everything lol.

What else what else????? Um well I'm currrently doin my 2nd year exams so thats uh fun, my side project (if u know me well u no what it is :-) is making progress and I have just started hunting for a summer job and planning for my holiday to see my dad in Ukraine.

Todays been a bit slow, reorganised my room so u can actually see a little of the floor at the moment and played some computer. Thats about it for now, but I'll probably start updating again soon as it iis kinda fun. Untill then as always any comments are welcome good or bad ooooh and Dans blog is at http://greenribbon.blogspot.com so take a looksie, hes an...um... interesting guy :p

Well hope I sound a little less neurotic than I used to be and that someone found this interesting/amusing Catchas all"

The Chevalier personifies the vampire that acts<br>with noble intentions, despite what it is<br>capable of. Taking a conflicting nature and<br>resolving its issues, the chevalier both<br>embraces and yet keeps the vampiristic nature<br>in check; the hunt and taking of blood is<br>enjoyed greatly, yet is restricted to those who<br>willingly give, 'wrong-doers,' or is taken in<br>self-defense; its powers are also embraced<br>willingly, yet while it blatantly and proudly<br>uses them, those that harm are only used in<br>self-defense or in the defense of others. The<br>vampire charm is used in full, and the<br>chevalier appears as one of the most alluring<br>of all vampires, often lordly in appearance as<br>well. Because of the open embrace of its powers<br>and seemingly royal stature, the chevalier<br>often is an immensely powerful vampire.

Dominant personality trait: Pride<br>
Dominant color: Gold<br>

so yes revising starts in ernest tommorow, I'm serious, please stop laughing oh dear alter wants to put a word in

<i>he really is going to work, even if I have to throw him down in this little grimy cell and take over</i>

calm down alter I said I would work and I mean it, and ur cell isnt grimy, for a spare mind uve got pretty good accomodation.  And as the primary ego I decide what happens.

<i>That's what you think, I'm taking over right now, you've been mincing around for too long.  You were pitiful yesterday on your date so a firmer hand is needed.  What are you doing? No I won't go back! Stop stop ...</i>

Thats better sorry you all had to see that he tends to get a little tetchy when I'm less than perfect in anything, and alter was right on one respect I had a date with the girl I've been harping on about (she phoned me WaaHoo!) and while I didn't do anything wrong, I did very little right.  I'm thinking that next time I see her I shall follow the advice that most of my housemates have given me and kiss her as soon as is reasonably possible.  Though anyone reading this please comment with any advice or suggestions as I need all the help I can get.

"event","I just read through last nights albeit very short post, looking back it seems to be a rather silly way to unleash my frustrations but to be fair it was a very silly thing that upset me, kinda fitting really :p
    I will get to why I was upset last night, but its kind of embarrasing so I intend to take a run at it by talking about everything else first (gee I'm brave) ah to heck with it, best get it over and done with, any1 whose read my entry on saturday knows that I'm interested in a girl at my uni and that I was planning to see her at the uni club later that evening to try and find out where I stand, good plan no? see her there, chat for a bit and then ask her. Great plan with one minor snag... she didnt go that night, all her friends were there and said she was at home sleeping, so as I said a silly reason to get upset.  It was simply I got my hopes up that I would know one way or the other by the end of that night and I think I would probably have prefered a refusal to this uncertainty (though an acceptance would be much better, of course!) ah well, guess I'll have to wait at least a few more days.

    Now the confession is done I get to todays events which thankfully are on a much lighter note,  probably the best place to begin is 12 noon, cause thats when i was woken up, my house mate and his gf charged into my room and demanded off me ""wake up yer lazy bugger""  my response was a well composed and articulated ""nhu"".  Normally waking me up without a very good reason (house burning down, exam etc) gets evils thrown at them for the rest of the day, but they came with  peace offering, a full cooked breakfast thats enough to gain major forgiveness in my book!

    For the rest of the day we've just lazed around (its amazing how many distractions you can find when your supposed to be revising), and watched Super Troopers this evening, I would defineatly recomend it.

    Thats pretty much it, so night night all.

oh p.s I noticed I've been added to the Brighton people group, so a BIG Hiya to everyone back home from Swansea Uni and any of you guys coming up to Cardiff to watch Brighton win (i hope) drop in to Swansea it's a cool place. (But avoid newport and bridgend like the plague - You have been warned!!!!!

"event","Well ok these entries are getting scarcer and scarcer but what can you expect, im disorganised at the best of times and now I'm back at uni things are even more hectic!

Rather than attempt to go through the intervening time since my last entry day by day, i'll just give a brief overview *Right which ones of you said ""thank god""???*

Now my beautiful surfboard is here with me I have of course been surfing several times hurrah! but i am once again pretty awful at it, oh well.  Plenty of drinking has also been in order and I cringe whenever I think of LAST saturday (more in a mo :p)  Exam fever has now struck here and in fact ihave one tommo...this morning now so of course i would choose this time to update my diary.

Well what else? um as hinted at in previous entries I have renewed my friendship with an ex of mine and I would say is now one of my closest friends, so I spend a lot of time chatting to her (hint for all males out there - make sure u have close female friends as well as male ones, they are really good at clearing mental junk when ur down)

And finally met a young lady recently, she seems to be jinxed, whenever she sees me I'm at least half pissed especially last saturday, good lordy I'm still getting reports of silly things I did which i have absolutely no recollection of, erp!  I definately like her, and sometimes she seems to like me (flirtation is hard work, believe it :p) though occasionally she seems oblivious to my presence, I have, to be totally honest, no idea where I stand with her and I'm too much of a gutless wonder to follow the advice I've given others and ask her directly or as my housemate suggests 'just pull her'.  Well shes normally at the same clubs I go to so I guess I'll see what happens at Divas tonight.

That pretty much covers my life and actually whether anyone reads this or not it helps putting it down in black and white.  Well exam in 8 hours 10 mins (yes I know its gonna be a bloody saturday morning) so i better revise a little then sleep.

night night world

"event","Well the last couple of days have been eventful, let me start from yesterday.
Jiving lessons, well as usual was fun, and as always I popped outside for a breather and a couple of local girls mistook me for one of their friends, when the mistake was rectified the following conversation took place.
<i>girls</i> me
<i>""So is something interesting going on in there?""</i>
""yup dancing""
<i>""Oooh show us something""</i>
""I'm Afraid its a two person style of dancing""
<i> ""Oh please dance with me""</i>
I'm sure everyone can guess what my answer was, and after showing her a few simple moves (with only one major muckup :p) I headed back in.

Next odd event, having to help my mum work up the guts to ask a man to dance, it was strangely reminiscant to primary school, down to her fear of a gentlemans friends being near him incase he says no!.  My cajoling (including the line ""what do you think they are gonna do? pull your hair or something?"")  Eventually she got up and after that she had a half hour of power where she was asking everyone in site for dances, YAY.

Now onto todays events. Due to a comment by my ex girlfriend (you all know who im talking about)  I believed a group of my old friends were not so friendly towards me, I wont go into details about why, but today one of them txted me and invited me to their new place.  Now, I'v just got back from chillin there and we are as tight as we ever were. I am still rather drunk (hope there aren't to many spelling mistakes :p) and we had a laugh. So thats another aspect of my old life regained.

All in all a good couple of Days :-D"

"event","I delayed writing this in order to allow myself to calm down a bit. Yesterday (well technically two days ago since its past midnight) I learnt of a betrayal by my ex who until then I had assumed was trustworthy and honest.l

Well at least I now know how wrong I was. That (expletive deleted) hacked into my email account and instant messenger service (I had told her my password when we were dating and not bothered changing it since I didn't think there was a nessescity).

After chatting to a good friend of mine and snooping through the contents of my mail, she then phoned and emailed me complaining about the fact that I had blocked her on IM and deleted my old emails from her.  When I figured out what she had done I confronted her with the duplicity of such an act.  And to this she denied it!  After complaining I had deleted old mail from her, she denied she had accessed my inbox... right!

After recieving a couple of lovely emails from her calling me pathetic etc. and from my friend a copy of the conversation she held I have blocked her email address and IM name so I won't need to hear from her again via them.  I am also debating asking my mobile company to block her numbers.  All in all I want to be as far away from that pyscho as humanely possible.

Oh and I forgot to mention, in my inbox was my confirmation of signing up for this journal, so shes read this (and emailed insults about it) so If she reads this I hope it'll help her see what she has become and why what she has done feels so much like a knife in the back from someone I once cared for.

Infact I feel rather silly to, many people warned me about her, and she even told me she did this to one of her ex-boyfriends so I should have seen this coming, I was to trusting in the decency of human nature and not allowing for petty viciousness so perhaps I should raise my hand as guilty to.

My mood today, well there isnt an option for varied so I've chosen crappy to stand in for...
enraged
depressed
pensive  and
betrayed

Well I'm off to bed now, see if tommorow will herald a brighter mood.
p.s. As I said at the beggining I left this a while so I could calm down, the immediate entry would have looked like this...
(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)(expletive)....... you get the idea,"

"event","Well it's been three days since I posted an entry, so I think I'm a bit overdue.  What have I been up to... well Strenuous shopping for new shoes with me ma, DIY on the Guinea pigs run (only took two attempts to get the hinges on :-D ) , um my best mate's 18th birthday (with a bouncey castle WOOOOO!!) and today drinking and pool in the afternoon and more Jive lessons this eve.  I'm amazed I'm still standing!

No major emotional ups or downs recently so not much to say about that.

That about wraps it up for now me thinks."

"event","It's strange how sometimes a person can change your mood just with a few words, that happened to me today.  After being stood up by someone who I thought was a friend at the last moment (I was in the carpark of the place I was meant to meet them) I was in a fairly miserable mood.  Heck I even drove up devils dyke the one of the highest local hills for a stroll in the wind and rain to clear my head.
But that changed a little while ago, just from talking to a friend of mine online for a few minutes I felt much more cheerful.  If your reading this u'll know who u r so thanx, uve brightened my day.  
Well thats pretty much all of todays entry, so all I can say is I'm pleased today to set my mood to cheerful."

"event","You know I realised something today, while its great to be home, get free food and not have to worry about lectures etc, i miss uni life and especially my friends there.  I miss the random people who'd drop by just to say hi, the spur of the moment trips out to the beach or into town and especially the nightlife, cause none of my friends back here at home are really the party types.  But the silly thing is that the thing I miss most about it all is knowing that if I want someone to chat to I've always got someone near by, be it a housemate, a fellow pysics major or just one of my friends who live close.  In short I'm lonely.  This also isn't helped by the fact that I broke up with Katherine not long ago so while I don't want to get back with her I do miss the knowledge that there is someone to, as it's often described, come home to.  Good lordie I sound pathetic.  I'm sure this little depressive fit will pass, but damn its gettin me down.

On the more positive side, with all this free time on my hands, I have managed to patch the computer back together, it'll last maybe 2 weeks  yeurgh!  Have also done some more writing on my story so will probably upload chapter 4 in the next couple of days.  Um that pretty much covers my day. Now im gonna go off and cry (only kidding :p)

night night"

"event","Well what've I done today, well I fixed the computer (again- god im sick of this thing, cant wait to get back to my beautiful machine back at my uni house!) but at least I have convinced mum to consider at least a partial replacement woo-hoo.
Next of course followed the obligatory lazing :D. Now for the intersting bit...

Went back to the modern jive dancing lessons (like ya hadn't guessed from the title :p ) had a really good laugh, nearly dislocated my own shoulder while twirling my current partner (it ain't as easy as it looks!!!) then staggered back here exhausted.

Oh yeah and i've also done some work on my story and posted it on the web, i have set up a temporary page for now, cause the server i want to use is done for a few days, y'all can access the story <A HREF=""http://sombreharlequin.koolhost.com/""> Here </A> hope the link works,,, I'll check it when I've posted this, if it doesn't work ill throw up another blog entry with the address.

Well thats me for tonight"

"event","That is the question, wether tis nobler in the mind to pass out now or to do the little bit of work i set myself for today... <b>YAWN></b>
Today has been a very very quiet day, got up went to Brighton had my eyes poked and prodded, went home, went to burgess hill, got my eyes poked and prodded some more, came home again and thats pretty much it.... <i>Dull Dull Dull</i>  oh well enough moaning, though I <b>still</b> dont have a job grrrrr I have managed to dismantle the T.v. to try and repair it... the surprising thing... is that it actually works WOOHOO.

"event","Hi all,
Have been talked into this by a friend of mine (You know who you are grrrr!), she seemed to think that since I was reading hers it was only fair to give her a chance to read about my life in return. Ah well, fairs fair I suppose.
Lemme think what have I done today... um... well didnt crawl out of bed til about 1pm which seems to be becoming par for the course since I got back from Uni for the hols.  Then I energetically lazed around all day until I finally decided to try and find myself a job (Money - I have memories of a time when my finances weren't in negative numbers) So set up an interview for bar work at one of the local-yokel pubs then cooked dinner (my mum didn't believe I could!!!!), came online and played around until pretty much now!  I really need to get out more!!!
Well thats my life today, no crisises, no motivation, just good old fasioned laziness.
As the welsh would say... Ta-ra"

"event","WEll i know i wasnt suppost 2 write back until wednesday but ut has became apparent that there is old shit resurficing and hittng me when i am finally happy!!!!! this goes back like 1 year and a half. at this time my friends were jordan, justin, josh, heather, candice, cassy, and my best friend NIKKI!! i met nikki a few years prior and me and her naturlley clicked maybe is because i had a crush on her but yea we naturally click!!! well things with her didnt get weird until she meet this new boyfriend Ray i mean i never ever met him until he came into her life. my first impression was he didnt like me hanging ut with her because when he saw me hanging out with her he left!!! then SHe all of a sudden stopped talking 2 me 4 months!! i was the 1 person 2 stick by her side 4 years and then she left me hanging by myself. i called her home and nobodied answerd and it was like i was died 2 her which really hurt y feeling anyways i was gone from her life 4 no reason then one day she calls me and says how she tried calling me and all of this stuff i knew she was lieing but i was so glad 2 here from her i mean we were best friends!!!anyways i was brought back into her life and i was so happy it was nice 2 have communicated 2 the person i used 2 talk 2 daily.. but when i came back Ray and her were on ther rough edges with each other i was brought back in just 2 be part of the middle of hers and his relationship crisis!! i didnt want 2 be but i wanted 2 be there 4 my best friend!! anyways so i got 2 so meet RAY i thought at first that he was an asswhole but then i got 2 know him i honsetly thought he was a nice guy he was always very nice 2 me in my face and so wasint his cousin nick there were bother as nice 2 me along side nikki! but there was specialtion that nikki was beng abused by ray which in my  book was nit kool i mean she was my best friend u know u dont treat pplz like that she would always tell me how he treated her and i didnt like it. anyways so my friend jordan and nikki decided that they wanted 2 go out with each other!! so they did and me and ray were on good terms so i was damn i am still in the middle i felt bad 4 ray because he seemed like he really loved her and i was happy with nikki because she was happy so i was torn! in the middle, while i was down the middle i still hung out with Ray, and he was dating this girl  named alyssa, i never ever knew of her or anything, so i didnt know what 2 expect!! on day durning a thunderstorm alyssa called ray and told him that i belive she left he books in his car and thats the day i meet alyssa!!no i when i talked nikki she always talke  shit about alyssa like she has all these STD's and stuff and she was telling me how she and her were sworn enemys since the 7 grade!!! so i didn know that 2 expect so i got a chance 2 hang out with her and o thought she and her friend jamie was really kool and honsetly nice good pplz!!! so every time nikki would talk shit i would say there nice people and alyssa is not that bad she is a really nice and caring person. but she would have it and then jordan left nikki and then she went back with ray!! u thought me and him were good but man was i wrong!!! he wanted nothing 2 do with me because nikki was made at me 4 hanging out with alyssa so we came 2 a cross roads!! and well she picked ray over me because i didnt want 2 give up alyssa as a friend!! well is sooned realized that ray was all about her and i was in his way!! so again she stopped talking 2 me an that summer i hung out with alyssa like 2 times after that then i had a quite summer 0 drama boy was it nice lol but anyways  i talked 2 nikki from then on like 3 or 4 times every time i wanted 2 there was some new drama!!! well i always tred 2 keep in touch with alyssa and like these last few month me and her and her friends started 2 hang out more and we were starting 2 get 2 know each other!! it was nice 4 a change we had real fun it really like it but then now it seem like i lost Nick as a friend, ray and nikki because of the drama yes i can say i was not incentt but i was not the fucking blame 4 everything!! i really messed up by wanting everyone 2 be friends and 2 be my friend!! that was a huge problem on my part!!but now it seem that nick and nikki have settle there differnices withing today and now i am being painted as the bad guy!! next thing u know ray will talk 2 alyssa and really put the blame on me!!!

"event","Well i have decided that i am going though alot of differnt goals i want 2 accomplish in my life. i want 2 have many friends that r 
TRUE friends that will be there 4 me as i will be there 4 them, i want to be successful in whatever i put my mind 2 whether it is school, work, or hangging out with friends. WEll i cant reach all my goals so i am at the point where i have 2 pick and choose of what i can get and what i cant get. So i reached the cross roads of what i am crossing out. the  First x out is my role and job of Student Senete. i have came 2 the reason that i am not need nor i was never needed. When i joined the organization i was expecting to do the best i could 2 be of much help as i could be. And i accomplished that part of that goal. Because i worked my ass off in that group, with all of the tabling i did all of the meetings i went 2. and being the only person 2 stick with  acidemic advancement when everyone else left that commetee i was there. it was me who got the night students 2 vote in that last election. and with all the listed i feel as i gave my all last semester. but i didnt not get any respect or thank u or anything instead i got well u a worker but i want new people! i mean what the hell is that i got the short end of the stick 4 working my ass off. i mean give me someone else that worked there ass off as hard as me ( i mean as in the new senetors that enterd in the spring 2005) but i got well u can be a senetor at large and be happy with that. my goal was to prove all the people that overlooked me wrong. but i know now that it would take out alot of engry out of me so i Quit senete and i am will be foucasing only on my work ant HCC and srew everything else there.  My other out of reach goals is 2 patch some of my old friendships up. well again that is another stupied goal i had to bring everyone 2 getther but i realized that i need a break because i need 2 foucas on who i am as a person. i am tried of always proving people wrong i have done it 4 years from family 2 friends 2 adminastions2 orgainzations 2 whatever and i am sick of it i push myself 2 the limits 4 nothing i still dont recive respect.I want a peace full life where my friends r friends and not rivials or fake friends. and i want to relax. i now realize that i am going 2 recive crap but i finally can let it pass i nolonger am going 2 try 2 change people minds about me i am stated fresh and new where u r going 2 like me 4 who i am and if not well screw u go treat someelse like shit. 
 Well all of this venting sure did the trick till next time"

"event","Something odd has been brought to my attention lately. It started when Reno complained that Tseng and I had the same ""Mr. Creepy Man glare."" Then Elena commented that many of our mannerisms are unusually similar.

Tseng has dismissed such comments, and I'm inclined to as well.

But some part of me can't help but wonder..."

"event","<i>I am in deep trouble with Chaos. After letting it deal with my alternate all night, we returned to the Nexus and Chaos let me have control again. While there, I ran into a <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/sages_of_chaos/7239682.html?thread=488396034#t488396034"">boy</a> with some cookies that turned out to be LOLed. Normally I wouldn't have taken any, but I hadn't had breakfast yet. Nothing happened to me, but Chaos...<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/sages_of_chaos/7242376.html"">Chaos wasn't happy.</a> It still isn't, even if it did get non-LOLed cookies from my alternate.

On a different note, I <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/dear_multiverse/3057751.html"">later</a> went to a part of the Nexus I haven't been to since the Jenova wars. I was a bit bored and restless and delaying heading home. I got a few interesting suggestions as to what to do with myself now that I might just try out. Exhibition shooting, hm?

But that wasn't the highlight. I ran into <b>Hojo</b>. And...I wasn't afraid of him. For the first time in decades...I wasn't afraid. I was able to look him in the eye without any panic attacks or flashbacks.

Maybe that therapist Reno suggested to me had a point about facing my fears. Though I doubt she meant it so literally...</i>


<lj-cut text=""'Someone remembers.'"">Vincent smiled faintly as he finished typing his entry, sitting back. Today had been a productive day in his mind, and he was still in a good mood. He glanced over at Rufus, watching the blonde sleep with a softer smile.

He was about to get up to join his partner, when the muffled ring of his phone stopped him. He blinked, pulling it out of his pocket. Who could be calling at this hour? Everyone from Avalanche would be asleep, and no one else had his number. Most likely a wrong number.

He glanced at the Caller ID, frowning slightly at the unfamiliar number before answering. ""Hello?""

""Hello. Is this, ah...Mr. Vincent Valentine?""

Already warning flags were popping up. ""Who's asking?""

""This is Alan Greyr of Shin-Ra Accounting in Junon. I'm sorry for the late hour, but we only just found a way to reach you and we were assured you wouldn't mind the call...""

Vincent's frown became puzzled. That had been one of the precautions Rufus had taken before Weapon's attack on Midgar, moving several key departments to Junon. But what did that have to do with him? ""Why are you calling at all?""

""Well, sir, there seems to have been an oversight with your account with the company. Your status was never marked 'deceased,' so you're still listed as active duty. And since the account wasn't terminated, you've been receiving regular pay deposits since your last withdrawl.""

Vincent stared blankly at the wall, as brain-broken as if he'd seen a nun Reno or a Rude with a full head of hair. When he could find his voice again, he asked weakly, ""How...how much?""

There was a pause as the caller looked up the relevant information. And when he heard the answer, the phone fell from slack fingers to thud quietly on the floor, unheeded by the stunned man. <i>So much...how...?</i> How could this have happened? The company never made mistakes of THIS magnitude when it came to money.

Finally he gathered enough sense to pick up the phone, where the concerned caller was trying to get his attention.

""Sir? Are you all right?""

""How did this happen?"" he asked in a hoarse whisper.

""Let me check."" A brief pause. ""It looks like someone purposely tagged your account to remain active, with a note that says 'Someone remembers.'""

Vincent turned pale and almost dropped the phone again. ""N-nothing else?""

""No, sir. Nothing else. What would you like us to do about your account, sir?""

""...Leave it. For now. Please. I...need some time to think about this.""

""Very well, sir. Let us know when you decide. Thank you.""

Vincent barely noticed as the other hung up, mind still reeling from this development. This was <i>impossible</i>. And yet...it had happened.

Or had it? He quickly checked his call log, not sure whether to be relieved or not when he saw the number was indeed in the log. He stared at the screen for a long moment, mind running over the conversation, and the one sticking point.

<i>""Someone remembers.""</i>

<i><b>But who?</i></b></lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""If Rufus had developed one thing over the past few years, it was patience..."">If Rufus had developed one thing over the past few years, it was patience, which was a trait he had put to good use lately. It had been some time since he'd gotten the relieving news of Omega's defeat, but so far he had been unable to find out anything about whether Vincent had come out of the ordeal alive. It wasn't that he lacked confidence in the other, but he was worried.

He sighed to himself, leaning out the window of his room and closing his eyes partway at a breeze.

Abruptly a sharp, unnatural down draft of air hit Rufus, and a moment later a winged form dropped down to hover in front of the window, glowing orange eyes peering at the blonde in amused curiosity. This was Chaos, and the first time it and Rufus had met face-to-face.

This probably wasn't the best way for Chaos to introduce itself to Rufus. As it was, the blonde yelped and scampered back from the window, falling flat on his rear and looking gloriously undignified.

From the dark demigod's snicker, that was probably exactly what it was aiming for. It smirked and landed on the windowsill, folding its wings to its back. ""Are you all right?"" it asked, its voice an odd double tone of Vincent's voice mixed with...something else.

What in the world--

Wait, that voice...

Rufus relaxed a little. Just barely. ""I'm fine,"" he replied, tone cautious.

Chaos chuckled softly and explained simply, ""This one is Chaos. Vincent is this one's host.""

Chaos. Yes, of course Rufus had heard about Chaos, and that was probably why he still wasn't quite relaxing. ""Vincent is all right, then?""

The demigod nodded. ""He sleeps for now. He was physically exhausted and emotionally exhausted by the battle and the aftermath."" It looked a little sheepish. ""He had to struggle with this one when this one lost its head so close to the master. And then he spoke with the woman scientist.""

Rufus relaxed further, much more relieved, and stood. ""That is good, then,"" he murmured, dusting himself off and sighing.

Chaos watched Rufus intently for a moment, then swiftly slipped through the window to pounce the blonde, pinning him firmly against the wall.

That drew a startled yelp from Rufus. His eyes were rather wide from shock, and he quickly started to struggle against the other's hold.

Chaos let out a warning growl. ""<i>Be still</i>.""

Rufus froze where he was, still wide-eyed as he tried to take slow breaths to calm himself. It wasn't working too well.

""This one will not harm you,"" Chaos said quietly, its voice oddly soothing. ""This one wants to be sure you can be trusted with the host.""

He slowly relaxed, inclined to believe Chaos for the moment. ""What do you mean?"" he asked quietly.

""<i>He</i> may trust you, this one needs to be convinced.""

Rufus nodded slightly, calming just slightly more.

Chaos locked gazes with Rufus, lips parting unconsciously to reveal an impressive set of fangs. Its eyes seemed to burn brighter, as if the demigod was searching for something in Rufus' eyes.

Rufus did his best not to notice those fangs, focused more on Chaos's eyes at this point and unsure of what was going to happen.

After what seemed like an eternity, Chaos relaxed, letting Rufus go with a smile. ""This one is convinced. The host will be pleased to know this.""

Rufus gave a slight sigh and smiled back, relaxing as well. ""That is good to know.""

Chaos tilted its head, slowly smirking. ""He's starting to wake."" With that announcement, Chaos' form glowed, then dissolved into Vincent's.

Vincent stumbled slightly with a gasp, then fell to his knees, panting heavily.

Rufus jumped slightly, then knelt by Vincent, his expression one of concern.

Vincent blinked groggily, then lifted his head to look at the blonde. ""Rufus...""

A slight smile crossed the blonde's face, out of relief more than anything. ""Good to see that you're safe.""

Vincent looked at Rufus for a moment, then abruptly grabbed Rufus' face and kissed him deeply. He had <i>missed</i> Rufus.</lj-cut>"

"event","Vincent was in the Nexus again, but he didn't feel like asking a question. He was sitting under a tree in a less-populated area, staring off into space. It felt odd to be free of the ghosts of his past, and the related anger. And yet...it was refreshing.

The battle with Omega had proved harder than he'd expected, and when Chaos had lost its head that close to Omega, Vincent had had doubts that he'd even succeed. And yet he had. Now he was here, resting and recovering a bit before returning to his home.

As for Chaos...the creature was far from quiet, as relieved as he that it was over. Unfortunately, it hadn't learned the first time not to go poking around in the closed ""doors"" in Vincent's mind, so Vincent was a bit distracted."

Investigating various sources through the Nexus, he found several options that might help Chaos survive the battle with Omega. But further investigation proved that most weren't feasible, save one.

Energy shields, also called 'extra lives.' It seemed perfect. A little further investigation helped him narrow down the proper node worlds where the best were located, and which people might be best at providing them.

So it was that he sent a request for a meeting with one Marino at a set of coordinates for a secluded area in the Nexus."

"event","Vincent was troubled. He was perched beside a gable of Rufus' home, gazing off in the direction of Edge and Midgar, though it was invisible from this distance. He'd returned from the <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/sages_of_chaos/7208402.html"">Nexus</a> and immediately sought out a place on the roof to brood. Rufus had come to the nearby window to try talking to him at some point, but he'd barely noticed.

His flashbacks...he'd shrugged them off in light of the growing problem with disappearances, convincing himself it was nothing. Being over-tired, or hungry, or Reno had spiked his drink again. But they had only grown worse. More dangerous. He'd almost hurt one of Reeve's WRO workers while lost in a flashback.

He had a problem. And little time to deal with it, if events continued on their current course."

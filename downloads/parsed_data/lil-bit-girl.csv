Notice to employees

1, godliness, cleanliness and punctuality are the necessities of a good business
2, This firm has reduced the hours of work, and the clerical staff will now only have to be present between the hours of am. and 6pm on weekdays.
3, Daily prayers will be held each morning in the main office. The clerical staff will be present.
4, Clothing must be of a sober nature. The clerical staff will not disport themselves in raiment of bright colours, nor will they wear hose, unless in good repair.
5, overshoes and top-coats may not be worn in the office, but neck scarves and headwear may be worn in inclement weather.
6, A stove is provided for the benefit of the clerical staff. Coal and wood must be kept in the locker. It is recommended that each member of the clerical staff bring 4 pounds of coal each day during cold weather.
7, No member of the clerical staff may leave the room without permission from Mr. Rogers. The calls of nature are permitted and the clerical staff may use the garden below the second gate. This area must be kept in good order.
8. No talking is allowed during business hours.
9, The craving for tobacco, wines or spirits is a human weakness and as such is forbidden to all members of the clerical staff.
10, Now that the hours of business have been so drastically reduced, the partaking of food is only allowed between 11.30 a.m. and noon, but work will not, on any account cease.
11, members of the clerical staff will provide their own pens. A new sharpener is available on application to Mr. Rogers.
12, Mr. Rogers will nominate a senior clerk to be responsible for the cleanliness of the main office, and all the boys and juniors will report to him 40 minutes before prayers, and will remain after closing hours for similar work, brushes, brooms, scrubbers and soap are provided by the owners.
13, the new increased weekly wages are as hereunder detailed: junior boys (up to eleven years) is 4d., Boys (to 14 years) 2s. 1d., juniors 4s. 8d., junior clerks 8s. 7d., Clerks 10s. 9d., Senior Clerks (after 15 years with owners) 21s.

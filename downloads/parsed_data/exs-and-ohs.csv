It makes everything bad go away.
I want to kiss you.
A really nice soft kiss.
I want to hug you also.
There are other things I wish to do with you as well.
But we won't talk about those right now.

Feburary not so far away.

i want to hear your voice as soon as possible.


i took an extra long shower today with candles lit and the postal service playing and all i could think about was you and how perfect eveything would be if you were here with me. i wish we could be together.

it's strange but when i look to the future it has you in it always.
god i hope it's more than just a wish.
i want you in my future.
i want you to be mine.
i need you to be mine.
i want to love you.
i want you to love me.

in the hall i saw all these couples hugging and stuff and i wanted so badly to turn the corner and see you there and hug you for a long time.

blah i feel like such a little girl.
when i think about you i get giggly.

i hope i didn't cause you to kill anyone today.
that'd be bad.

i was standing by the car waiting for my ride to get there and it starts pouring and i wished you were there to kiss me.
i've always wanted to kiss in the rain.
i say we make it happen.
but if there's no rain we should kiss anyways.

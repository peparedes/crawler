"event","Mevashel:  well the proceeds from those shirts goes to an organization called savi - they do couseling for victims of domestic violence - and they go into school and organize educational programs - by selling these shirts online and in stores such as intermix she is raising awarness and money for the organization.
 ObsidianSW:  Okay, well good for her, I'd rather be shot than make the situation for progressive-minded people any more degrading than it already is.
 Mevashel:  all this about doing something about helping to make human life better is funny coming from the guy with 3000 flyers from that guys film in your apartmet
 ObsidianSW:  lol, what can I say? I'm lazy, but at least I never pretend to be the leader of a cool trendy new revolution
 Mevashel:  yeah but you being lazy cast that guy money time and probably did that guy more harm than had you not gotten involved in the first place
 ObsidianSW:  sure, but again, I'm not saying that I'm the perfect human being, and I'm not selling my thoughts to anyone
 Mevashel:  well what is your album than
 ObsidianSW:  an expression of my own that people can think about and appreciate or choose not to
 ObsidianSW:  it's nothing that says ""youuuu shoullld think like meeeeeeee""
 ObsidianSW:  or one step further, ""youuu should think like meee or you're a nazi""
 ObsidianSW:  I just hope that there's a day when people realize that the rebellion they think they are a part of, even if it has no physical or traceable ties to big business, is all part of the same bullshit
 Mevashel:  shes nto saying that
 ObsidianSW:  The only hope for our species is that we start thinking for ourselves and actually get our hands dirty to make things better
 Mevashel:  but how can you say that and say your lazy
 Mevashel:  thats bullshit
 ObsidianSW:  I'm lazy about getting some Italian fuck wad's movie posters posted
 ObsidianSW:  I'm not lazy about thinking, doing things on my own, expressing my thoughts in a constructive and non-impinging way
 Mevashel:  but you made a commitment and he trusted you 
ObsidianSW:  So what? That's a personal failing, I'm sure your friend who makes the t-shirts has plenty and she's not going to put it on a t-shirt
 Mevashel:  but your going to be selling your album
 Mevashel:  your music is totally self promoting

::snap!:: oh no you di-int!

 ObsidianSW:  My personal commitment to another person falls under the jurisdiction of my own, situation-to-situation ethical constitution. This case is an example of how I am not perfect, and because I know I'm not perfect, I only seek to perfect myself, not perfect other people.
 ObsidianSW:  Secondly, my music is not in any way self promoting to anyone other than myself or maybe a few girls. My music, which you shouldn't speak negatively about so cavalierly, is very close to a pure expression of my inner thoughts and images, and I can only make a song when I am truly moved to do so; I do not make music as a commodity.
 ObsidianSW:  The promotion of my music however, is something you are free to talk about, and sure, I want to have a successful music career in the same way that a public defense attorney probably hopes to make a living doing that

::nearly fifteen minutes pass::

 Mevashel:  lawyers and musicians are different species

"event","God, shit like this just pisses me off so much. All you need to know is that the site and product line we're discussing is viewable at www.bodyasbillboard.com - Originally, when my friend Josh mentioned the website, I thought he was talking about this thing I've been hearing about where girls will auction of spaces on their physical body for use as advertising space. I think that's hilarious and kind of cool in a way, or at least not really worth my getting pissed off over for any reason. But this bodyasbillboard.com shit has me so annoyed because I genuinely hate stupid NYC liberal kids who think it's hip to be commodified by ""the rebellion"" in the same way that other people are made to be drones for the Evil Empire. When will the idea ""think for yourself"" become cool? I don't know. Maybe after Arizona is famous ;-) But certainly not as long as lame little girls are doing stupid shit like this:

Mevashel:  bodyasbillboard.com
 Mevashel:  shes a friedn of mine
 ObsidianSW:  haha
 ObsidianSW:  I think I've heard about that
 ObsidianSW:  how do you know her?
 ObsidianSW:  I don't understand what is so amazing about this
 ObsidianSW:  betsy johnson says she's a creative genius?
 Mevashel:  friend of my sister
 Mevashel:  yeah
 Mevashel:  from the ""tits"" shirt
 ObsidianSW:  I guess I don't see it, but that's cool that you know her
 Mevashel:  im catching up on my corespondance
 ObsidianSW:  is that her modelling the shirts too?
 Mevashel:  yeah
 ObsidianSW:  this shit makes me cringe
 Mevashel:  explain
 ObsidianSW:  I just can't stand these women activists who pose in scant clothing with shirts like ""what would you give for a great pair of tits"" yet they obviously complain about men and sexism, etc.
 ObsidianSW:  if I were me, but a hot or semi-hot girl, and I saw this chick's shit, I'd proudly wear a shirt that said ""Banana Republic"" or whatever, because this 'body as billboard' bullshit is just as much as a brand
 ObsidianSW:  I mean it's cool that some of the proceeds go to charity, definitely, that's great
 Mevashel:  of course
 ObsidianSW:  but it's like... this is someone else's idea of rebellion... on my chest... wait a minute, this is retarded
 Mevashel:  well not exactly
 ObsidianSW:  what would actually be cool is if she sold you a bunch of white shirts and a black magic marker and said ""write whatever you want on it""
 Mevashel:  well its very political
 ObsidianSW:  if people did that, they'd be actually expressing themselves instead of someone else's idea and essentially allowing themselves to be branded as much as any other shirt does, it just seems hypocritical as all get-out
 Mevashel:  it raises awareness for a lot of issues people dont talk about
 ObsidianSW:  I mean, I'm sorry, but anyone who would wear these shirts already knows about the issues, and anyone who sees them is going to be like ""wow, what a stupid follower bitch"" not ""wow! what an interesting idea!""
 Mevashel:  i disagree
 ObsidianSW:  well then again, you're someone already indoctrinated into that line of thinking
 ObsidianSW:  like you're already involved with engaging the issues
 Mevashel:  yeah
 Mevashel:  and i dont wear obvious brands
 Mevashel:  but this i would wear
 ObsidianSW:  I just think it's lame, that's my take, but it's cool that she's doing well with it, I mean these shirts, which would cost 2 cents to make yourself, are being sold on eBay for 35@ 
 ObsidianSW:  35$
 Mevashel:  this is controlled anarchy
 ObsidianSW:  this is commercialism on a smaller scale, nothing else
 Mevashel:  exactly 
 ObsidianSW:  controlled anarchy would be a movement that encouraged people to stop buying brand shirts from anyone and just wear white t-shirts that you decorate yourself
 Mevashel:  but that would never happen
 ObsidianSW:  why not? I'd do that
 ObsidianSW:  wheras I'd rather take a screwdriver to the calf muscle then be caught dead wearing this poser bullshit
 Mevashel:  shes making me the sodomy one
 Mevashel:  i dont remember the catchphrase
 ObsidianSW:  I don't see it on here
 Mevashel:  im excited to wear it 
 Mevashel:  i dont think its on there
 Mevashel:  look her sceme isnt perfect but you have to think about who this is geared towards
 ObsidianSW:  well I'm glad you've found something you're into, but I'd rather be shot in my head than be involved with a movement like this
 ObsidianSW:  I mean her shit is totally corporate and self promoting, to me it sounds like bull shit
 Mevashel:  its both
 ObsidianSW:  she's got official representation, she's promoting a book, she's got her name all over everything
 ObsidianSW:  and she's making 35$ a t-shirt off of people who think it's cute to rebel against george bush by wearing stupid clothes
 Mevashel:  the only bush i trust is my own is quite clever
 ObsidianSW:  I guess, it's cute, but like, it's so Canal St. tourist bullshit
 Mevashel:  well it is now
 Mevashel:  but it wasnt 3 years ago
 ObsidianSW:  I mean look, it's cute and all, it's just fake rebellion
 ObsidianSW:  I'd rather wear a shirt that says ""fuck you you fucking fuck"" and know that whoever designed it was out to make a buck
 ObsidianSW:  and that they weren't going to be like ""yeahhhh I designed this shirt man because like, man, the injustice in the world, man""
 Mevashel:  and id rather give the buck to someone who is trying to make some sort of positive change in the world no matter how self promoting
 ObsidianSW:  In my view, this is the type of movement that makes it easier for Conservatives to swipe aside well-meaning people as liberal psychopaths and followers
 ObsidianSW:  And for that reason, I view it as highly counter-productive
 ObsidianSW:  You want to help battered women? Wearing a shirt about it isn't going to do a single thing for any single battered woman. Someone who wants to help should go stop being a pussy and volunteer at a battered woman's shelter.
 ObsidianSW:  In fact, not only is only that chick Perial profiting from the shirt, but she is profiting from issues such as rape, etc.
 ObsidianSW:  Those shirts wouldn't sell if there weren't the issues that they exploit, so she is in fact exploiting the people she portends to be advocating for
 ObsidianSW:  I mean I doubt she ever stopped to think about it that way, and the way she presents herself, she would be incapable of having a reasoned discussion about what she's doing (this is a preconception on my part, but that is the image she's created for herself and for whoever buys her shirts), but wheras buying even 100 of her shirts would likely do absolutely nothing to decrease rape in America, it would amount to $3500 in gross sales that arose because it's 'hip' to wear a shirt that is anti-rape
 ObsidianSW:  So because 1) it paints an image of a well-meaning person concerned with the issues as a raving liberal lunatic or at least someone without much of a mind of their own; and 2) it exploits real life victims as a marketing scheme; and 3) it's self-serviving; and 4) it does nothing tangible to help anyone, this is the kind of product that makes it easier for people like Bush and his followers to ignore the people who care about these issues; and as such, it makes the issues themselves less talked about
 ObsidianSW:  So that girl should stop being such a pussy and go actually do something, like dedicate a weekend every month or even every other month to making an actual human life better."

"event","...the beginning of a much MUCH needed enema! Those god damn hemmys just won't quit, the freaking grapes.

Anyway, I feel like not even close to being Ben again, but finally close to being able to start to be. For like the last several several months, I just felt like a real douche bag, just sitting on my ass, not being positive at all. I've done a lot of things lately that I'm not proud of, that I would have never done were I to have felt good about myself and at peace with the world. BTW, I still don't feel either of those things, but I'm going to make an effort to change. I have an album to do and an adulthood to embrace (which, by the way, sucks big big big balls when I really think about it). I'm going to try to get some sort of a volunteer job next year. I have a lot of really stupid shit to make up for, but I've really made the decision to be a good guy and I can't stray from that. And next year, god willing, I'll cut the shit and get into some kind of shape. I've outgrown the stupidity of the person I was (not to say that I don't still have it- god knows that some of the things I've said and done recently have been incredibly stupid and short sighted), and I've outgrown my limited physique. I really need to change. Well, not really- but I do need to feel free. The only time I ever felt like I really had it together, like I was really doing good was like a year ago, when I was at Stonybrook. I had a really nice relationship, and I felt like very at-one-with-the-world, and like I wasn't a supreme douche bag, but some how I managed to fuck all of that up. But no more, I cannot deal with that bullshit anymore. I'm not a fuck up, I'm a fucking champion! A champion of the universe, no less. It's going to take many many many months to undo the mess I've entangled myself in, and moreover, to just reach some kind of bliss again. It has been so very long since I felt that. I can only really pray that in a year from now, I will be sleeping easy- not feeling like the air is so thick that I can't breathe. I really, really, honest-to-god, want to be free in my life. To feel at ease with other people, and with myself, and with the people who matter most to me. I can't live with this acid in my stomach for much longer, and I really hope that I'm able to pry myself away from the things, and there are many, that are trapping me. I felt good once in my life, and I really want to feel that way again. I need to, because I feel so full of shit right now."

KreIianZG:  Yeah, it was a really bad hospital experience too. The lady who was cleaning out my leg kept pulling pieces of fat out of the wound with her forceps and waving them in my face, saying, ""Look! It's just like chicken-fat!"" 
 ObsidianSW:  ...omg 
 ObsidianSW:  that is disgusting 
 ObsidianSW:  why was she doing that? 
 KreIianZG:  Plus I had THE most flaming x-ray tech in the world. Had the stereotypical gay lisp and all, and when I got up on the table, he put a lead apron over my lap, patted it, and said ""Here you go! Thomething for yer thpectacles!"" 
 KreIianZG:  Because she was high? I have no clue

 ObsidianSW:  is that appropriate? are you supposed to pull fat out? 
 ObsidianSW:  that's fucking weird as all fucking hell 
 KreIianZG:  Well, it was already loose I guess

after a brief change in topic, I couldn't stop thinking about what he had said. So I asked him if his fat really looked like chicken fat. His reply?

 KreIianZG:  Well.....yeah, it did 
 KreIianZG:  Only it was coming out of my leg 
 ObsidianSW:  that's horrible!

 ObsidianSW:  what did you think at the time? 
 KreIianZG:  That these are the most fucked up doctors I've ever met 
 ObsidianSW:  were you like ""oh my god???????"" 
 ObsidianSW:  oh man, I am dying of laughter over here, that is the most fucked up story ever, and you've got some fucked up stories 

He really does. For example:

 KreIianZG:  When my dad was doing his fellowship, he watched this guy do a bone marrow biospy without giving this lady any painkillers and how she was screaming in pain 
 ObsidianSW:  ...that's amazing
 KreIianZG:  Evidently the guy turned to my dad and said ""See Steve, when properly done, biopsies are painless,"" with a huge grin on his face. 
 KreIianZG:  I hate doctors.

"event","A conversation about the musical I'm writing about Mr. Machine, a virtually unbeatable robot who becomes the benevolent king of the people, but he sometimes uses his gattling gun arm to kill people.

I'll start you off with the lyrics to one of the opening numbers, where Mr. Machine (not his real name, obviously) first wanders into the village:

Roobyerd Kipless (narrator):
oh hello, mr. machine
so nice to you see ya
glad that you're clean again, mr. machine
it's been a while
hasn't it been
till all the crossed wires crossed at the end?

Townspeople of the city Gli-Kle'en:
oh hello, mr. machine
so nice to see ya!
glad that you're clean again, mr. machine!
it's been a while
hasn't it been
till all the crossed wires crossed at the end?

The Mayoral Welcoming Comittee (initially masquerading as police men):
mr. machine, hands in the air
we've secretly been watching along
mr. machine, hands where I can see em
we've been secretly listening and singing along!

Company:
singing machine is our man
he is our m-a-n-i-c-a-n

Surly man:
catch a look at the plaque
caught a small round of gunfire and didn't look back

Company:
machine is our guy

Kliner Arumati (Heroic ambiguously asian teenager):
he is our guy-yuka-semi-am!

Company:
there's no choice, he's the best!

Proud Woman:
took a short burst of lazer to the chest!

Company:
(gleefull gasps as Mr. Machine adresses the crowd)

Mr. Machine (a terrifying robot):
oh hello, town of gli-kle'en
so nice to see you
back in the beams again, citizens and friends
it's been a while
but it wasn't the end
mr. machine is protector and friend

Company (visibly nervous)
yes machine is our man!
he is our m-a-n-i-c-a-n

Mr. Machine (confirming candidly he is an indestructable robot):
yes it's true, I won't lie,
you could set me on fire and I wouldn't die

Company (accepting their new leader):
machine is our lord!

Mr. Machine (relishing in their easy conversion and his new position as indestructable tyrant God-king):
I am your every th-i-n-g

Company (agreeing, affirming they are weak humans and are willing to bend to the will of the tyrant God-king Mr. Machine)
yes it's true, we reply
if you shot us with lazers, we'd die

Kliner (sweet and melodeously):
but secretly robot, you're empty within
with questions 

 EggbrtShootsFire:  LOL!!!!!!! 
 ObsidianSW:  lol that's awesome right? 
 ObsidianSW:  the music for it is great too 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  amazing 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  I'm really impressed 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  obviously the robot will kill people 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  but the obviousness does not a great musical make 
 ObsidianSW:  well actually, the kid Kliner, he starts singing about the robot's past, and apparently the robot is emotionally conflicted, well as far as a robot can be 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  but of course he does kill people ben 
 ObsidianSW:  he's not artificial intelligence, just a military robot 
 ObsidianSW:  yes of course 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  because if he doesn't kill people, then welcome to Suckville,  Population: Your Musical 
 ObsidianSW:  sometimes by accident, they will trigger his motion detector and his machine gun arm blows their head and right shoulder into peices 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  fantastic 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  does he end up completely uncaring about humans?  
 ObsidianSW:  yes, it ends with him accepting his role as evil robot ruler of the people 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  thank god 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  I like where this is going 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  oh so peter jackson is directing King Kong with Naomi Watts, but guess who is playing opposite her 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  hint: he's my fucking hero 
 ObsidianSW:  1/2 Tenatious D 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  yes 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  thank god 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  and they are making a tenacious d movie 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  I can't wait 
 ObsidianSW:  I know 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  you are actually seriously writing a musical now? 
 ObsidianSW:  a mini one 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  lol 
 ObsidianSW:  at the end he takes a guys face clean off with his blade hand 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  thank jesus 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  lol 
 ObsidianSW:  I know 
 ObsidianSW:  and the best part is it is about a robot that's not really all that spectacular, it doesn't think, it's not artificial intelligence 
 ObsidianSW:  but just because of the super strong reactions of the humans to this robot, the robot ""kinda"" learns emotions just by random chance and recall, and like ""kinda"" figures out he is their new ruler 
 ObsidianSW:  he's essentially retarded, a retarded military robot, completely lacking the smarts necessary to run a country 
 ObsidianSW:  but he does it because they almost force him to just be elementary stimulus/reaction reinforcement 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  LOL 
 ObsidianSW:  I think that is profound 
 ObsidianSW:  I was picturing doing it like a cartoon musical 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  cartoon?? 
 ObsidianSW:  like an anime musical mixed with like Lost in Space because the robot is not advanced looking- it looks like the robot from Lost in Space 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  but definitely threatening enough 
 ObsidianSW:  right well it is impervious to attack 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  like he might have those big corrugated tubes for arms 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  yeah 
 ObsidianSW:  right but within the arms are rockets 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  yeah 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  would he be boxy? or more sleek? 
 ObsidianSW:  he has rockets/webs/poison/acid/flame thrower/gattling run/short burst beam/continuous beam launchers 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  and would he roll on a wheel or would he have large bumbling legs? 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  LOL 
 ObsidianSW:  definitely it's tank treads on the legs, Johnny Five Style 
 ObsidianSW:  and definitely not ""stupid"" or ""bulky"" 
 ObsidianSW:  he has to look like something that was smartly designed 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  alright that's cool 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  smartly designed but like, several years ago  
 ObsidianSW:  but like imperfect, a relic, obviously not any better than a terminator 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  right 
 ObsidianSW:  aka. not designed to rule a people 
 ObsidianSW:  imagine them worshipping a terminator just because the terminator is *basically* indestructable and really could take on just about any attack the townspeople could mount against him 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  well robots aren't really designed to rule a people, but sometimes it just kind of happens that way 
 ObsidianSW:  but he isn't even like actively going up against them thaaaaat much, more like random accidental killings, because he doesn't really have a plan, he's not a thinking robot 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  right, and obviously they want the robot to rule them because when you give something of that much power leadership status,  why would you fear that he'd turn on you? he can do basically anything, and you want him on your side 
 ObsidianSW:  so they just are like ""welllll we better start making sure we're on this guy's good side, just in case he machine guns us"" 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  Yeah 
 ObsidianSW:  right exactly 
 ObsidianSW:  I think that says something powerful about America 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  but well accidents are accidents 
 ObsidianSW:  right 
 ObsidianSW:  anyway 
 ObsidianSW:  I think it'd be hilarious 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  and I'm sure they can look past a few accidental killings 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  yeah I completely agree 
 ObsidianSW:  as like an album my band does, or an EP, and we do it with some cartoon artist or something 
 ObsidianSW:  after our first major release 
 ObsidianSW:  to get ""cult status"" lol 
 EggbrtShootsFire:  lol nice 
 ObsidianSW:  or to ""slice people with our blade arm"""

"event","Sweet, sweet Christ: you have delivered me once again. Cassie, that ultimate champ who most of you know inspired my song ""Cassie"" (wow, what an incredibly difficult connection to make), is coming to New York tommorow, and I have the extreme honor of picking her up from the airport. To those with children: lock your doors, and to all young men and women: strap on your chastity belts because Cassie Pogul-Sussman and Benjamin Morris Wigler are coming to your town to rock you in the hardest core of ways. We're talking about never ending knife fights, webs that we can shoot from rifles that nail you to a wall and trap you under a web, shock prods that we produce from under our sleeves, guitars that we sling around our necks and rock bad ass tunes on and then press a button which ejects a missle. Cassie means business- she only has one eye, and she keeps explosive grenades in her eye socket, which she conceals with an eye patch. Be careful, because Cassie has been known to cause a severe allergic reaction whose symptoms may include:

*Hives
*Facial Swelling
*Asthma (wheezing)
*Shock
*Gigantic boners the size of the hubble telescope

Stop use and ask a doctor if an allergic reaction occurs and seek medical help right away, but most importantly, say your prayers because you probably have a high powered laser beam focused on your brain pan and Cassie is just dying to blow you away.

(needless to say, I will be chronicalling our adventures here)"

 Deep Ray:  has she seen it on your website 
 Deep Ray:  prob not i'm guessing 
 Deep Ray:  or I hope 
 ObsidianSW:  there's a new category: it's the ""other person replaces the serious conversation because we all know that while the serious one was really great, it's like the cast member that tries to get paid more but the studio won't do that so recasts"" conversation 
 Deep Ray:  this is brilliant 
 ObsidianSW:  okay update time 
 Deep Ray:  okay I need to get some rest, I am headed into the city tomorrow 
 ObsidianSW:  later dude 

2)  it's the ""other person replaces the serious conversation because we all know that while the serious one was really great, it's like the cast member that tries to get paid more but the studio won't do that so recasts"" conversation:

I'm too freaking RIPPED to give you a whole bunch of ""analysis"" about the ""four conversations"" or explain to you my CRAZY ""FREAKED OUT"" IDEAS that are going to make you FREAK OUT when I tell you. 

I WILL SIMPLY GIVE YOU THE TITLES. AND IF YOU ARE A TRUE MARIJUANA SHAMAN (aka. Josh Wigler) YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.


AND NOW


THE FOUR CONVERSATIONSaaationsaationssaations (supposed to be echoe effect like ""and nowwwww sssttonne coolld steeeeeeeeeeeeeevvve austinaustinaustin....)

1) ""The 'HOLY SHIT I'M SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RIPPED... whew... okay... I'm calm but still SO ripped... and only YOU are worthy enough to be told my other conversations but you don't really care and eventually leave...=("" conversation:

 ObsidianSW:  justin, jesus christ 
 Deep Ray:  what 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm fucking BUHHHLAAAAZED 
 Deep Ray:  LOL 
 Deep Ray:  where are you 
 Deep Ray:  at home?

 Deep Ray:  hahah well another time 
 ObsidianSW:  I just ""drunk IM'd"" lauren dentone 
 ObsidianSW:  lol 
 Deep Ray:  holy shit 
 ObsidianSW:  this conversation is really awkward 
 Deep Ray:  thats is amazing 
 ObsidianSW:   ObsidianSW:  Pretty good 
 Baby Elle5:  so whats up 
 ObsidianSW:  Just wanted to see how you were doing 
 Baby Elle5:  oh cute  
 Deep Ray:  when was the last time you talked with her 
 ObsidianSW:  haha I don't know, like 5 years? lol 
 ObsidianSW:  this conversation is taking a turn for the bizzare 
 Deep Ray:  thats is great 
 Deep Ray:  well you are gone 
 Deep Ray:  brb 
 ObsidianSW:  it's hilarious, I'm going to post three conversations I'm having concurrantly 
 ObsidianSW:  yours is the ""HOLY SHIT I""M FUCKED UP ... transitions too ... hey you, yeah only you can know about pot"" conversation 
 ObsidianSW:  and then there's the ""serious conversation"" about relationships 
 ObsidianSW:  and then there's the ""stalker but really doesn't mean to be"" convo with lauren dentone 
 Deep Ray:  hey how is the stalking going? 
 ObsidianSW:  hilarious 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm uploading the convos to the internet now 
 Deep Ray:  hahah okay 
 Deep Ray:  to what site? 
 ObsidianSW:  my live journal 
 ObsidianSW:  I'll give you the link, you'll SHIT YOURSELF 

2) The ""This Was the First Conversation, Started Before Getting Stoned, Happening again when you ARE stoned where you don't want the person to know you're stoned because you don't know if they like that but then realize you were just got by saying something far out and then you tell her and then the conversation gets really serious conversation but actually ends before the others with a really sweet beetles or alice cooper lyrics away message"" conversation:

 LACkadaiciCAL:  !!!!! 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  do you know what song? 
 ObsidianSW:  no 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  oh ok cool 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  tell me how it went with you and jamie

 LACkadaiciCAL:  how's it with you and jamie? 
 ObsidianSW:  oh right, sorry about that 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  sokay 
 ObsidianSW:  Everything between us is... better 
 ObsidianSW:  I wouldn't say 'fine' 
 ObsidianSW:  but I certainly wouldn't say bad  
 ObsidianSW:  I mean I'm freaking nuts about her and I think she is about me too 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  are you not looking at her the same old way ? 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  ^ 
 ObsidianSW:  well, only because of a percieved change in her tone 
 ObsidianSW:  but generally the same 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  yeah 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  same here 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm nuts about her, same as I've been for like 5 years lol 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  yeah 
 ObsidianSW:  but yeah, certainly not without problems 
 ObsidianSW:  but I think anyone our age in a relationship could say that 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  nothing's perfect 
 ObsidianSW:  right exactly 
 ObsidianSW:  so tell me more about ehren 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  i love him 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  that's about it 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  i went to pick up my textbook today at his house at 8 
 ObsidianSW:  how did that go? 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  he was just leaving for band but still in his room getting ready so i went to se him 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  and he gave me the book and wanted a kiss i think, but i'll save the kisses for more special times 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  we kiss a lot when we're alone 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah I hear that 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  he took a piece of milky way off my nose and rubbed it into my nose  
 LACkadaiciCAL:  into my coat*** 
 ObsidianSW:  LOL! 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  ^^^ 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  now that i think about it, that is pretty funny 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  and i walked him out to his car where his mom and sister were waiting 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  and then i waited to talk to him online at about 11 so i could hear about his day 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  that was all 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  i don't know what i'll do when he's going to graduate 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  this last week was so painful i couldn't believe it 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  for everything to repair and get stronger, that would make the future end even worse 
 ObsidianSW:  One second, Liz. 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  ok 
 ObsidianSW:  I just got off the phone with my brother, I need to read what you wrote 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  ok 
 ObsidianSW:  Oh man 
 ObsidianSW:  so he's a year younger? 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  two 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  he's 16 
 ObsidianSW:  oh I hear ye 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  how old are you? 
 ObsidianSW:  so it's like the same age dif. as me and jamie 
 ObsidianSW:  20 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  yeah 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  ahaha FINALLY 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  SOMEONE WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah to people give you shit? if so, they're retarded 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  nah not really 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  they just say i'm robbing the craddle 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  sometimes i have to remember he's only sixteen when it comes to certain issues, but he's VERY mature for his age 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  and i love him plenty to forgive him any flaws from his age 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah man believe me I hear that 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  excellent 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  i'm going to go study for two exams tomorrow 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  i wish i had the time to write a paper but i don't 
 ObsidianSW:  I know that feeling all to well 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  hahaha 
 ObsidianSW:  well you can call me if you need to talk 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  all right 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  i think i have you down in my wallet now which is a special thing 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  if i don't, i'll put you in 
 ObsidianSW:  oh nice! 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  adios, have a good night 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  do you have the white album? 
 ObsidianSW:  of course 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  I Will by the beatles 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  i just love it 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  first disk 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  might be track eleven 
 ObsidianSW:  The beatles are divine 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  i can't remember 
 LACkadaiciCAL:  oh they are

Who knows how long I've loved you 
You know I love you still 
Will I wait a lonely lifetime 
If you want me to I will 
For if I ever saw you 
I didn't catch your name 
But it never really matters 
I will always feel the same 
Love you forever and forever 
Love you with all my heart 
Love you whenever we're together 
Love you when we're apart 
And when at last I find you 
Your song will fill the air 
Sing it loud so I can hear you 
Make it easy to be near you 
For the things you do endear you to me 
Oh you know I will 
I will   

3) The ""I USED TO THINK YOU WERE HOT IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT HAVE NO IDEA IF YOU STILL ARE BUT I THINK YOU ARE NEAT BUT I IM'D YOU BY ACCIDENT AND NOW IT GETS REALLY AWKWARD"" conversation... with Lauren Dentone... ouch... I'm such a dumbass:

 ObsidianSW:  hey lauren 
 Baby Elle5:  whao 
 Baby Elle5:  hey 
 ObsidianSW:  How are you doing? 
 Baby Elle5:  ok you 
 ObsidianSW:  Pretty good 
 Baby Elle5:  so whats up 
 ObsidianSW:  Just wanted to see how you were doing 
 Baby Elle5:  ohj cute 
 Baby Elle5:  I am good 
 ObsidianSW:  That's good 
 ObsidianSW:  Are you still doing music at all? 
 Baby Elle5:  um not like i would like to be 
 ObsidianSW:  I was just hanging out with emilie bogrande, and her singing reminded me of you and so I figured I'd say what's up 
 ObsidianSW:  well you should be 
 Baby Elle5:  oh are you home? 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah, my semester just ended 
 Baby Elle5:  good 
 ObsidianSW:  Yeah so... yeah sorry for IM'ing you out of the blue 
 Baby Elle5:  nah that is fine 
 Baby Elle5:  i am sorry i havent imed before this 
 ObsidianSW:  That's okay :-) 
 Baby Elle5:  but i didnt have the same buddy list i used to 
 ObsidianSW:  sure- so anyway you should really start singing again, you had the best voice of any kid my age I had really heard 
 Baby Elle5:  thats so sweet 
 Baby Elle5:  I have no outlet to sing tho 
 ObsidianSW:  get a mic and record shit, that's what I do 
 Baby Elle5:  hhahahahaha 
 Baby Elle5:  cant 
 Baby Elle5:  lack of instrument 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah. I mean I could go on and be like ""just sing! you're so good it won't matter!"" but really, yeah, you kind of need to sing over something that's true lol 
 Baby Elle5:  hahahahahaha 
 Baby Elle5:  my voice is a lot stronger (i have no idea why i never snig) but it lacks somehting 
 Baby Elle5:  not as many high notes 
 Baby Elle5:  and a little throaty 
 ObsidianSW:  well that's cool, you had such a clean voice for a really long time 
 ObsidianSW:  I bet you could combine the two 
 Baby Elle5:  yeah 
 Baby Elle5:  its still there 
 Baby Elle5:  just not the same 
 Baby Elle5:  lower 
 Baby Elle5:  more sultry i guess 
 ObsidianSW:  right exactly 
 ObsidianSW:  that's probably just because you're a woman now and you were a kid in highschool 
 Baby Elle5:  yeah

 ObsidianSW:  she sounds like she seriously blows
 KreIianZG:  As of the end of last year it was 3.5, but i've been getting mostly B-s and Cs
 ObsidianSW:  well that's definitely colombia worthy! ;-)
 KreIianZG:  heh
 ObsidianSW:  so you'll go to NYU and party with Jamie and I it'll be great
 KreIianZG:  yeah, it'll be wizard
 ObsidianSW:  You can either break up with your idiot girlfriend or cheat on her like mad
 KreIianZG:  lemme copy and paste from a saved convo all the shit thats been going on
 ObsidianSW:  please
 KreIianZG:  genna and I have been on horrible terms for the past month or so. About a week ago i told her that it would probably be better if we broke up, and she told me no. She completely refused to accept that I'd break up with her. I haven't seen her in about a month now, and every time I talk to her, she's either really pissed off at me, or she acts like nothing is wrong. Its driving me crazy and as far as I'm concerned our relationship is over, but I haven't been able to bring myself to be really blunt with her about it because whenever I try to bring it up she either cuts me off and changes the subject or just gets incredibly upset.
 KreIianZG:  i know i need to just break up with her, cuz this relationship (if it can be called that anymore) is just way too stressful for me at this point in my life. I just feel so bad because she honestly can't understand that.
 KreIianZG:  i mean, is there really a point where I can say to myself that I should disregard her feelings completely and just do whats best for me? I feel like I need to at least explain stuff to her, but she doesnt let me......
 KreIianZG:  granted, there's more depth to it than I can explain in a few minutes, but suffice to say that she's been rather immature about all this and I feel like I'm trapped here because if I just straight-out break up with her, I know that its going to crush her, and I'd feel horrible doing that.......
 KreIianZG:  the problem is that its distracting me now, and this isn't exactly a point where I can afford it.....
 KreIianZG:  because suffice to say that I have a lot of pressures at home too, and I do kinda need to do decently in school for this quarter
 KreIianZG:  Fin
 ObsidianSW:  reading
 ObsidianSW:  Yeah man, I just got scary echoes of my relationship freshman year of college
 ObsidianSW:  you need to ice the bitch, Jeremy
 ObsidianSW:  She seemed sweet or whatever when I met her, but Jeremy Allen doesn't need to deal with crazy girls
 KreIianZG:  well, depends on how you define crazy
 KreIianZG:  :)
 KreIianZG:  but yeah, I know, I gotta end it
 KreIianZG:  Oh man, why do I always have these encouraging, helpful conversations about Genna when I'm high off my rocker:-P?
 ObsidianSW:  just kill her
 ObsidianSW:  I think that's your best option
 ObsidianSW:  lol
 KreIianZG:   i think i realized that the relationship was basically over when, the other day, I went to call her, and I realized that i had forgotten her phone number
 ObsidianSW:  LOL
 ObsidianSW:  that's a pretty good indicator that things have slid way past the danger zone
 ObsidianSW:  why not just phase her out entirely?
 ObsidianSW:  do the same thing she does, just ignore her
 KreIianZG:  yep. and the fact that the other day she called me up and asked if I wanted her to come into Roslyn during her lunch period and fuck....and I turned her down
 ObsidianSW:  eventually it will become a nonissue
 KreIianZG:  yeah
 ObsidianSW:  why did you turn it down? ass is ass, silly man
 KreIianZG:  Yeah......but you know what? I turned her into a raving nympho a while back...and its getting old
 KreIianZG:  I need variety
 KreIianZG:  which is why i've devised the greatest analogy to dating ever;
 ObsidianSW:  lol
 KreIianZG:  If you're planning to sell your house, its perfectly alright to start looking at other houses. Hell, spending a night in another one to see how it suits you is fine too.
 ObsidianSW:  amen
 ObsidianSW:  those are words to live by
 KreIianZG:  You remember Alex Brot, right?
 KreIianZG:  he came up with a better one
 ObsidianSW:  lol that kid is a genius
 KreIianZG:  ""Say you're baking a cake. Its gonna be delicious. BUT, you realize you're missing an ingredient. Its not wrong to go borrow that one ingredient from your neighbor, right?""
 KreIianZG:  then again, he also said ""Rape is illegal. Cheating is not illegal. Therefore, rape isn't cheating.""
 ObsidianSW:  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
 ObsidianSW:  wow I think you have just state 3 things that could go into the men's guide to dating bible
 ObsidianSW:  It basically comes down to this:
 ObsidianSW:  if your girlfriend is a complete psycho
 ObsidianSW:  and she's annoying out the ass
 ObsidianSW:  and is retarded
 ObsidianSW:  it is practically your obligation to cheat on her fervently
 KreIianZG:  indeed
 KreIianZG:  can I quote you on that?
 ObsidianSW:  I'm fortunate in that my girlfriend is picture perfect
 KreIianZG:  yeah, Jamie seems like a great girl
 ObsidianSW:  She is redonkulous
 ObsidianSW:  I've got nothing to complain about
 ObsidianSW:  yeah I'm quoting myself, this is going up on my website lol
 KreIianZG:  Score!
 KreIianZG:  Mine too
 KreIianZG:  oh shit, have you seen my proposed halloween costume?
 ObsidianSW:  anyway, I think you need to just go mess around with some other girls, maybe even take pictures, and hope that you can entirely phase genna (who will after freshman year never ever ever factor into your life again) out, if not, just shoot her a copy of the pictures and she'll get the idea 
 ObsidianSW:  no what's your idea?
 KreIianZG:  check out my uJournal
 KreIianZG:  two entries from tonight's
 ObsidianSW:  a friend of mine had a hilarious one- she's going to be the ghost from mario brothers, she's going to have the scary face on one side of a bedsheet, and then the ""huh? me? I didn't do anything"" face on the other, and stalk people around with the angry face, and when they turn around, she's going to turn around and have the ""huh?"" face 
 ObsidianSW:  lol
 ObsidianSW:  I think that's brilliant
 ObsidianSW:  and no I won't check out the uJournal, too much effort"

 ObsidianSW:  that'd be great 
 roundhoward:  if they did that 
 roundhoward:  i'd have an idea 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah? 
 roundhoward:  they should have two bad-ass lead characters 
 roundhoward:  Robert Patrick 
 roundhoward:  and Tom Sizemore 
 roundhoward:  good god 
 roundhoward:  that'd be the best 24 teamup 
 roundhoward:  in NYC 
 ObsidianSW:  holy shit 
 roundhoward:  right man? 
 ObsidianSW:  I'd like to see tom berenger in on it too 
 roundhoward:  as the bad guy 
 ObsidianSW:  right 
 roundhoward:  his inclusion to the show would be akin to Dennis Hopper's 
 ObsidianSW:  I really wish they had made season II have more to do with the rogue coral snake 
 roundhoward:  Tom Sizemore would play the director of NYC CTU, like a bad-ass version of George Mason 
 roundhoward:  and Robert Patrick would be the Jack Bauer type 
 roundhoward:  they'd play off each other so well, that'd be great

 roundhoward:  yeah man

 ObsidianSW:  That's fine 
 ObsidianSW:  Dean Cane was freaking malasyan

 roundhoward:  lance henriksen as Tony Stark 
 ObsidianSW:  no, we nailed it with guy pierce

 ObsidianSW:  Lance Henriksen is entirely evil unless he's Bishop

 roundhoward:  good idea 
 ObsidianSW:  Michaen Beihn as Mark Hamil playing superman 
 roundhoward:  hahaha 
 roundhoward:  frankly 
 roundhoward:  Hugh Jackman could do superman 
 ObsidianSW:  Yes, but he's not allowed to be the two best super heros, he's just not 
 roundhoward:  yeah

 ObsidianSW:  kate and leopold

 roundhoward:  and shows no shame in it

 ObsidianSW:  Everyone knows the Rock stopped Diesel in his tracks! 
 roundhoward:  yeah, thats true 
 ObsidianSW:  they would be retarded to cast Vin Diesel in anything with the Rock stomping about 
 roundhoward:  i can't believe that The Rock and Vin Diesel are the new Schwartzy and Stallone 
 ObsidianSW:  It's awesome 
 ObsidianSW:  It's been a long time coming  
 roundhoward:  what the hell happened to movies, its so crazy out there 
 roundhoward:  someone needs to clean things up 
 ObsidianSW:  No, The Rock is definitely a suitable replacement for Schwarz 
 roundhoward:  yeah agreed 
 ObsidianSW:  I really appreciate The Rock 
 roundhoward:  but what the hell is Vinny doing 
 ObsidianSW:  I don't know, Vin Diesel doesn't suck, in fact he's cool, he's just too wrapped up in being a fuckhead 
 ObsidianSW:  XXX, Fast and the Furious, that shit goes no where 
 roundhoward:  yeah man 
 roundhoward:  and now he wants to go back to Fast and Furious 
 roundhoward:  whereas he backed out of XXX2 
 ObsidianSW:  Pitch Black was awesome, he was great in that, Boiler Room he was even good in 
 roundhoward:  which will now be Ice Cube 
 ObsidianSW:  It's so true, diesel is stallone to The Rock's schwarz 
 roundhoward:  yeah

 roundhoward:  always a step behind in awesomeness 
 ObsidianSW:  their movies just suck 
 roundhoward:  they gotta pick it up, they have a large weight on their shoulders 
 roundhoward:  whos gonna be the new Bruce Willis? 
 ObsidianSW:  I have no problem with modern day actors, we have some GREAT mainstream actors- heath ledger, matt damon, george clooney, greg kinnear, these guys are all great 
 ObsidianSW:  it's modern day film makers that suck a cock, like McG 
 roundhoward:  thats true 
 roundhoward:  thats very true 
 ObsidianSW:  and modern day actresses suck asssss 
 roundhoward:  but actors these days, while talented, have poor decision making skills 
 ObsidianSW:  not too many good ones of those 
 roundhoward:  none of them know what they should be making 
 ObsidianSW:  I know, but they don't have much choice probably 
 ObsidianSW:  We've got great actors though, jesus christ, Jared Leto, Colin Farrell 
 roundhoward:  its just like they all got dumped onto the ground in the midst of a really crazy Jamaican market, and they're wandering around getting suckered into crazy Jamaican shacks 
 roundhoward:  where the Jamaicans are like ""here's hashish""

 ObsidianSW:  yeah Barrymore lost her edge after Wayne's World 
 roundhoward:  Lucy Liu needs to be O-Ren Ishii, AND THAT'S IT 
 roundhoward:  and Cameron Diaz should be demoted to porn 
 roundhoward:  thats how i'd like to deal with that 
 ObsidianSW:  Yeah Lucy Liu was great in that roll 
 ObsidianSW:  Cameron Diaz has overstayed her welcome in a major way 
 roundhoward:  yup 
 ObsidianSW:  which is a shame because she is very charming and talented 
 roundhoward:  yup 
 ObsidianSW:  obviously the worst torture imaginable for ben affleck and yennifer lopey 
 roundhoward:  yup 
 roundhoward:  yup 
 roundhoward:  yup 
 ObsidianSW:  I had a great call for luther a second ago that I'm totally forgetting 
 roundhoward:  ving rhames 
 roundhoward:  lol 
 ObsidianSW:  ving rhames for superman, he gets my support for anything 
 roundhoward:  hahahahahahahah 
 ObsidianSW:  in fact, I really would like to see a black jack bauer if we do it NYC style 
 ObsidianSW:  we could easily give whats his name some great roll, fuck wad, what's his name 
 ObsidianSW:  either mario van peebles 
 roundhoward:  nope 
 ObsidianSW:  or shithead from what's it called 
 ObsidianSW:  the christian bale movie 
 roundhoward:  taye diggs?! 
 ObsidianSW:  yes 
 roundhoward:  as the jack bauer role?! 
 roundhoward:  god no 
 roundhoward:  listen to me 
 roundhoward:  24 without Jack Bauer needs TONS of support 
 roundhoward:  we can't waste our time dilly-dallying with black people  
 roundhoward:  we need Robert Patrick 
 roundhoward:  and Tom Sizemore 
 ObsidianSW:  Robert Patrick is not NYC 
 ObsidianSW:  it needs to be NYC 24 
 roundhoward:  Tom Sizemore is ALL ABOUT NYC though 
 ObsidianSW:  John Dogget is not Jack Bauer, the two are not equaitable 
 ObsidianSW:  hey I'm not talking about Sizemore, he's locked in 
 roundhoward:  Tom Sizemore as one part Jack Bauer is locked 
 roundhoward:  Imagine him with a shotgun 
 ObsidianSW:  Sizemore's got it 
 roundhoward:  and like the Jack Bauer badge 
 roundhoward:  Tom Sizemore needs to get out of that other show and pitch this to Fox 
 ObsidianSW:  I'd be behind him all the way 
 ObsidianSW:  Fuck if only we had power! We would be the best TV producers ever 
 roundhoward:  he needs to go up to Jon Cassar and Howard Gordon and be like ""Listen, your show is great, make another version with me instead of Jack Bauer in NYC or i'll bust your balls"" 
 ObsidianSW:  lol 
 ObsidianSW:  He'd be phenomenal in that roll 
 roundhoward:  and he needs to say ""fuck shit piss damn"" as often as possible 
 roundhoward:  cause Tom Sizemore's foul mouth is better than anyone's 
 ObsidianSW:  It doesn't need to have anything to do with CTU/presiden palmer or anything 
 roundhoward:  no Palmer 
 roundhoward:  palmer sticks with jack 
 roundhoward:  instead 
 roundhoward:  I'd like to see an endearing old man play the senator type 
 roundhoward:  and towards the end of the season, have him be very twisted 
 ObsidianSW:  yes 
 roundhoward:  or instead of CTU LA or NY 
 roundhoward:  CTU Hogwarts"

"event","Westinghouse Red: but because there are these societal concerns that lead us to institue ""requirements""
ObsidianSW: UR has requirements?
Westinghouse Red: clusters
ObsidianSW: oh right
Westinghouse Red: I have no desire to learn about science
ObsidianSW: well whatever that shit sucks, but it does broaden your understanding of the world
Westinghouse Red: I am simply not interested in science
Westinghouse Red: I am not good at science
ObsidianSW: that's fine, but don't blame that on society
Westinghouse Red: I am never going to implement something which I have no desire to learn now into my future life
ObsidianSW: it's fine to be close minded like that- but you can't blame your own feelings on society
ObsidianSW: the study of science/math is a great thing for some and it's very important to our world
ObsidianSW: if you don't want to participate in it, that's your perogative
Westinghouse Red: yes but they are being close minded in assuming that it is justified to make everyone take it
ObsidianSW: well I don't think anything should be forced either
ObsidianSW: they should make it based on an incentive
Westinghouse Red: in order to get this thing called a diploma which is a key to unlock the magical world of business 
ObsidianSW: like you get a certain extra boost to your GPA if you take all the clusters or something
Westinghouse Red: right
Westinghouse Red: I just want to take the classes from my major
ObsidianSW: but change doesn't happen over night, and with the amount of bitching and moaning you do, it's easy to understand why they're not forming the system around you ;-)
Westinghouse Red: and maybe some art classes 
Westinghouse Red: I don't give a shit what there system is
ObsidianSW: so transfer man, I've done it twice
ObsidianSW: lol
Westinghouse Red: nope it's the same there are required core courses
ObsidianSW: not everywhere, man
Westinghouse Red: yeah but where would I go?
Westinghouse Red: I have no clue what's out there
ObsidianSW: Vassar doesn't have requirements, Wesleyan, lots of places don't
ObsidianSW: so stop bitching around and research it :-)
Westinghouse Red: vassar is expensive
ObsidianSW: so drop out of college?
Westinghouse Red: nope just take all the courses I want to
Westinghouse Red: and fuck the requirements
ObsidianSW: and what is that going to do for you? you won't graduate
Westinghouse Red: so
Westinghouse Red: I'll learn
Westinghouse Red: I'll have that knowledge
ObsidianSW: at the cost of someone else's money
Westinghouse Red: my money
ObsidianSW: either way, you're being a tremendous brat
ObsidianSW: are you paying for UR soley?
Westinghouse Red: I will be
ObsidianSW: when?
Westinghouse Red: when I graduate I will have to pay it all back
ObsidianSW: but it doesn't sound like you're going to graduate
ObsidianSW: it sounds like you're just being a panzy
Westinghouse Red: well when I'm done
ObsidianSW: how are you going to pay it back? with what income?
Westinghouse Red: the job I get after I'm done
ObsidianSW: which job? you won't have a degree and with your attitude, you couldn't get a job even as a mechanic because you would get your ass kicked
Westinghouse Red: I can take a punch
ObsidianSW: Doesn't matter, still wasting someone's money, you're escaping the question
Westinghouse Red: well then I should drop out
ObsidianSW: What this basically comes down to is not that society is bad- but that you are a leech and are most likely completely unworthy of anybody's generosity or consideration
ObsidianSW: Right, that is my suggestion
Westinghouse Red: and commit suicide
ObsidianSW: If you feel so inclined
Westinghouse Red: well if I am a leech
Westinghouse Red: and comepletely unworthy of anyone's time or consideration
Westinghouse Red: than I am basically worthless
ObsidianSW: right, it sort of seems that way
Westinghouse Red: so I serve no purpose
ObsidianSW: but I think you could drop out
Westinghouse Red: and die
ObsidianSW: get a job as a waiter or something
Westinghouse Red: nope
ObsidianSW: sure you could, that's easy schmeezy
Westinghouse Red: that would waste someones time
ObsidianSW: get a job doing that, build some back bone and then either persue music or something else
ObsidianSW: well, I said generosity and consideration
ObsidianSW: not time
Westinghouse Red: I'd rather just lay down and die
ObsidianSW: and being a waiter and serving someone food is worrthy of their time
ObsidianSW: well then that's your perogative, but I don't suggest it because I believe the consequences for that are more dire than you could imagine
Westinghouse Red: but at least then people will think I have an excuse to be a leech
ObsidianSW: you'd be giving something back by being a good waiter, I believe that you could do that job well
Westinghouse Red: no I couldn't I hate people
Westinghouse Red: I can't communicate properly
ObsidianSW: that's definitely true
ObsidianSW: so drop out and become a criminal?
Westinghouse Red: drop out become mentally sick and live off the state?
ObsidianSW: well you already sound mentally sick
ObsidianSW: I mean like mug people, etc.
Westinghouse Red: but that takes effort and a sense of motivation
ObsidianSW: right but you could end up being murdered that way and it'll be better than killing yourself
Westinghouse Red: but then someone else might feel guilty and that would be a waste of their time
ObsidianSW: or jailed, and then you are provided for and can be as languid as you want
ObsidianSW: we've already said that you're not a waste of time
Westinghouse Red: yes I am
ObsidianSW: just generosity and consideration
ObsidianSW: no, you're not wasting my time right now, I'm having fun
Westinghouse Red: oh ok
Westinghouse Red: so I should drop out and become a waiter?
ObsidianSW: right
Westinghouse Red: hmmm.....
Westinghouse Red: that means I can't be ugly right?
ObsidianSW: you can be as ugly as you'd like
Westinghouse Red: they won't want to hire an ugly person a t a good restaurant
ObsidianSW: you're not ugly
ObsidianSW: and even if you were, there are MUCH uglier
Westinghouse Red: so I'll have to work at a hole in the wall in the middle of nowhere
ObsidianSW: yeah and that'll take less work than anything
Westinghouse Red: until they go bankrupt from lack of business
ObsidianSW: sounds like a match made in purgatory :-)
ObsidianSW: right, and then you can get a job somewhere else
ObsidianSW: or kill yourself or make it so that you are killed
Westinghouse Red: right
ObsidianSW: but I strongly strongly advise against suicide
Westinghouse Red: was there a choice A?
ObsidianSW: there's choice A) waiter and B) criminal
ObsidianSW: I have to go run and catch a train
ObsidianSW: good luck with all of this stuff :-)"

ObsidianSW: are you going?
ObsidianSW: I'd like to catch a film
cullen812: Avant-Garde or tomrrow?
ObsidianSW: I don't think tommorow will work so avant-garde
ObsidianSW: it's been such a long time since I saw a non-mainstream film
cullen812: hmmm...its a possibility, my plan so far has been to spend some quality time in my bed watching movies
ObsidianSW: lol that rocks
cullen812: I bought last night ""1900"" by Bertolucci, it has deNiro and Gerrard Depardiu
cullen812: Bertolucci is pretty awesome, have you seen either ""Il Conformista"" or ""Last Tango in Paris""?
ObsidianSW: incredible
ObsidianSW: who is the one who did ""Besieged"", that's Bertolucci isn't it?
cullen812: I think it might, I haven't seen it yet
ObsidianSW: I loved it
cullen812: they're playing ""Last Tango"" at Lincoln Center next thursday

"event","ObsidianSW:  If Christian Bale wasn't SO bruce wayne, he COULD be Supes
 ObsidianSW:  You know who could be a great Clark Kent is John Cusack
 roundhoward:  i thought that too
 ObsidianSW:  probably a terrible superman
 roundhoward:  while i was thinking about it
 ObsidianSW:  but a great Clark Kent
 roundhoward:  exactly the problem
 roundhoward:  great Clark, bad Supes
 roundhoward:  Thomas Jane would be great as both, though
 roundhoward:  he could pull off the Supes hair too if they dyed it black
 ObsidianSW:  Yeah, but you really need someone who has it naturally
 roundhoward:  who would you pick?
 ObsidianSW:  let me think for a minute
 ObsidianSW:  oh yeah
 ObsidianSW:  KIEFER
 ObsidianSW:  lol jk
 roundhoward:  LOL
 roundhoward:  we both know that Kiefer should be Ghost Rider
 roundhoward:  but its not gonna happen
 ObsidianSW:  Bruce Willis to me embodies the sort of notion of Super Man but could never look like him
 roundhoward:  too old
 roundhoward:  all of the current contenders for superman suck
 ObsidianSW:  yes
 roundhoward:  that movie will suck
 ObsidianSW:  there really is no american actor to play supes
 roundhoward:  doesnt have to be american, just someone who can be american
 ObsidianSW:  oh here's the man for the job:
 roundhoward:  OKAY
 ObsidianSW:   KreIianZG:  Heya
 roundhoward:  Colin Farrell
 roundhoward:  He could do it
 roundhoward:  he could do anything
 ObsidianSW:  I was thinking that too, but he's too much of a dick
 roundhoward:  yeah thats true
 ObsidianSW:  You really need an American
 roundhoward:  hes so arrogant
 ObsidianSW:  Someone who will have NO sex appeal as Clark
 roundhoward:  i guess thats the thought process behind Brendan Fraser
 roundhoward:  they should have him play Clark, and just do CGI for superman lol
 ObsidianSW:  god, if only we had a time machine
 ObsidianSW:  bruce cambell 8 years ago? Paece
 roundhoward:  yeah, easily
 roundhoward:  or even Mel Gibson 8 years ago
 ObsidianSW:  sure, mel could do it
 ObsidianSW:  oh easy
 roundhoward:  ?
 ObsidianSW:  the dude who's playing jesus in gibson's movie
 ObsidianSW:  a little weak on the clark side
 ObsidianSW:  but very strong on the supes side
 ObsidianSW:  aka angel eye's guy
 roundhoward:  jim caviezel???
 ObsidianSW:  yeah definitely
 roundhoward:  the COUNT?!??!
 ObsidianSW:  yes, definitely (did you see that movie btw? excellent movie)
 roundhoward:  on that notion
 ObsidianSW:  yes
 ObsidianSW:  I know what you're thinking
 ObsidianSW:  definitely
 roundhoward:  yeah
 roundhoward:  i think he'd be good
 ObsidianSW:  exley could do it eaasily
 roundhoward:  actually
 ObsidianSW:  he'd be a better bats though
 roundhoward:  i'd rather use him for Iron Man
 ObsidianSW:  oh yeah absolutely
 roundhoward:  Guy Pierce is Iron Man
 roundhoward:  arrogant alcoholic millionaire
 roundhoward:  he could handle it
 ObsidianSW:  yeah
 roundhoward:  Jerry O'Connell would've been much better than any of the current contenders
 ObsidianSW:  yeah or even fuckhead chicken from the TV show lois and clark
 ObsidianSW:  mario lopez
 roundhoward:  hahahahaha
 roundhoward:  Ding Chavez
 ObsidianSW:  zack morris could do it
 roundhoward:  yeah
 roundhoward:  he came to mind earlier
 roundhoward:  he would be fantastic
 ObsidianSW:  He'd be a good supes
 ObsidianSW:  My vote is for him or Caviezel
 roundhoward:  yeah, i wonder who will be Luther
 ObsidianSW:  Luke Wilson would be a combination of Brendan Fraser and a more bad ass guy for Supes, but he's not bad ass enough
 roundhoward:  casting Superman is too tough
 roundhoward:  way too much pressure
 roundhoward:  I wouldn't even bother trying
 ObsidianSW:  I think it goes to Caviezel dude
 roundhoward:  yeah, but hes a bad Clark
 ObsidianSW:  for a modern superman, he's quite good
 ObsidianSW:  yeah, but we both know clark is going to fall by the wayside
 roundhoward:  I hate him so much though
 ObsidianSW:  if I were a movie exec, I'd cast Caviezel or Zack Morris
 ObsidianSW:  Zack Morris really could do it
 roundhoward:  Zack Morris would be very good
 ObsidianSW:  sean scott-williams lol
 roundhoward:  hahaha
 roundhoward:  Scott Wolf?  you remember him?
 ObsidianSW:  oh definitely
 roundhoward:  with glasses, he could look really nerdy
 ObsidianSW:  he's all over it
 roundhoward:  he'd be great
 roundhoward:  he'd be like on the set
 roundhoward:  and say
 roundhoward:  ""you know, I was Billy Lee""
 ObsidianSW:  HAHAHA
 roundhoward:  eating a donut
 ObsidianSW:  Okay, we've got Scott Wolf as superman
 ObsidianSW:  perfect
 roundhoward:  yeah, thats good for me
 ObsidianSW:  and we could get super fucked up because what's her face would be a pretty good lois lane, Nell Chinkums
 ObsidianSW:  what was her name
 ObsidianSW:  she was sydney 
 roundhoward:  neve campbell
 roundhoward:  what about John Stamos as superman?  lol
 ObsidianSW:  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
 ObsidianSW:  dude, uncle joey
 roundhoward:  hahahaha
 roundhoward:  why didn't John Stamos ever get involved in action movies?
 roundhoward:  he'd be so cool
 ObsidianSW:  Because he played it stupid
 roundhoward:  no way
 roundhoward:  i respect his career
 roundhoward:  being Uncle Jesse
 roundhoward:  then vanishing
 roundhoward:  that was great
 ObsidianSW:  Dude, Steve Gutenberg
 ObsidianSW:  what the fuck is vanishing?
 roundhoward:  no, he played Uncle Jesse, and then he disappeared forever
 ObsidianSW:  oh lol
 roundhoward:  he played it great
 ObsidianSW:  rebecca would have been a good lois
 ObsidianSW:  We need a kind of all american, non-anerexic girl for lois
 roundhoward:  Charlotte
 roundhoward:  you know what i mean
 ObsidianSW:  huh?
 roundhoward:  Kristen Davis i think her name is
 ObsidianSW:  no, I have no idea who Charlotte is
 ObsidianSW:  ohhhh
 roundhoward:  or is she too old?
 ObsidianSW:  yeah
 ObsidianSW:  too old
 ObsidianSW:  but would have been a good call
 roundhoward:  yeah
 roundhoward:  hmm
 ObsidianSW:  too old for wolf, and he's perfect
 roundhoward:  yeah, hes good
 roundhoward:  hes very all-american
 ObsidianSW:  both charlotte and her ex husband would have been ideal a few years ago
 roundhoward:  yeah
 roundhoward:  that guy whos hilarious
 roundhoward:  ""spiiice""
 ObsidianSW:  yeah absolutely
 roundhoward:  he'd have been excellent
 roundhoward:  Patrick Stewart as Jimmy Olsen
 ObsidianSW:  hahahaha
 roundhoward:  oh yeah
 roundhoward:  i forgot
 roundhoward:  this might be a throwaway
 ObsidianSW:  we gotta get sean scott bomo on Jimmy
 roundhoward:  but what about The Rock?
 ObsidianSW:  lol
 roundhoward:  seriously, hes becoming the man
 ObsidianSW:  he aint supes' material
 roundhoward:  I would love to see The Rock as supes
 roundhoward:  and him team up with Batman
 ObsidianSW:  even though he's definitely the best action star now
 roundhoward:  that'd be such an erection
 ObsidianSW:  Dude, they are thinking of making a Predator 3 with The Rock as dutch
 ObsidianSW:  they're gearing the rock up to be schwarz
 roundhoward:  yeah, hes not taking the part
 roundhoward:  he said ""what?""
 roundhoward:  and thens like ""no sorry you're confused""
 roundhoward:  and rumors were thereby debunked
 roundhoward:  but yeah -- The Rock is the new Schwarz, hes going to be phenomenal in everything he does
 roundhoward:  he'd be great as The Thing
 ObsidianSW:  fuck, predator would have ROCKED literally
 roundhoward:  for the Fantastic Four movie
 ObsidianSW:  yeah but that's too small a roll for him
 roundhoward:  no, thats the best role
 roundhoward:  he'd love it
 roundhoward:  Laura Linney as Invisible Woman
 roundhoward:  The Rock as The Thing
 ObsidianSW:  what's his name as stretchoid man
 roundhoward:  Mr. Fantastic
 ObsidianSW:  fuck I have his face, but not his name
 roundhoward:  whats he in?
 ObsidianSW:  I don't know, he's like an older guy, he's an asshole
 ObsidianSW:  oh a good guy for something, not sure what- the dude from borne identity, 'the professor' in that new angelina jolie movie
 roundhoward:  matt damon?
 ObsidianSW:  no
 ObsidianSW:  did you see that?
 roundhoward:  oh yeah
 roundhoward:  i know who
 roundhoward:  he can't be a good guy
 ObsidianSW:  obviously
 ObsidianSW:  I meant a good fit
 roundhoward:  he could never be a good guy

 roundhoward:  i'm a big fan
 roundhoward:  I don't care if anyone else isn't
 roundhoward:  I love him
 ObsidianSW:  obviously I think tia carerre would have been a sweet elektra back in the day
 roundhoward:  yeah obviously
 roundhoward:  back when i didn't know anything
 roundhoward:  about movies or actors
 roundhoward:  i wanted to cast an X-men movie

 ObsidianSW:  she'd be a perfect psychlocke
 roundhoward:  so I like picked Gina Davis for rogue
 ObsidianSW:  hahahahahaha
 roundhoward:  and like ""Angela Bassett"" as Storm
 ObsidianSW:  brie gave us an awsome name for the next batman, lawrence fishburne with ears stapled to his head

 roundhoward:  The Rock as fucking Cable
 roundhoward:  in a Cable movie
 ObsidianSW:  obviously
 roundhoward:  how fucking cool would that be

 ObsidianSW:  the rock in any movie
 ObsidianSW:  I'm SOOO glad the Rock is destroying vin diesel
 roundhoward:  a movie about Cable, with a giant plasma machine gun, PLAYED BY THE ROCK?!?!?!?!
 roundhoward:  co-starring Michael Dorn as Bishop
 ObsidianSW:  Vin Diesel was a disaster
 roundhoward:  Vin Diesel sucks
 ObsidianSW:  Vin Diesel was a virus, he was great in the iron giant and that's it
 roundhoward:  he was fabulous as Caparzo
 roundhoward:  cause he dies right away
 ObsidianSW:  lol
 ObsidianSW:  remind me what that is
 roundhoward:  Saving Pvt. Ryan
 ObsidianSW:  oh totally forgettable performance
 roundhoward:  Barry Pepper as Human Torch?
 ObsidianSW:  no, Barry pepper never gets used again

 ObsidianSW:  he could be the lead marine in A v. P that's about it
 roundhoward:  hahaha
 roundhoward:  bad career choices
 ObsidianSW:  terrible. What a waste
 roundhoward:  James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader
 ObsidianSW:  Wow, good call
 roundhoward:  thanks
 ObsidianSW:  man, if nothing else, we could be super good casting directors
 roundhoward:  thats accurate
 roundhoward:  good thing we'll cast and direct and write and STAR in all of our own movies funded by us
 roundhoward:  remember that movie i wanted to make, about the guy who gets married to this girl whos supposed to die but she doesnt and the mob gets involved and whatnot

 roundhoward:  it will
 ObsidianSW:  yes what about it?
 roundhoward:  Clive Owen as someone
 roundhoward:  besides Bond
 ObsidianSW:  oh absolutely

 roundhoward:  even though he's not American
 roundhoward:  fuck that
 roundhoward:  Clive Owen as fucking Duke in the G.I. Joe movie
 ObsidianSW:  no shit
 roundhoward:  Jeremy Irons as Voldemort for good

 ObsidianSW:  We gotta get some work to Keller and Beecher somehow
 roundhoward:  Beecher doesnt need work, he gets a lot of random work
 roundhoward:  Keller could use some more roles
 ObsidianSW:  We gotta give Keller a blade that extends out of his arm
 roundhoward:  Keller on 24 would be cool
 ObsidianSW:  you know I'm right about that
 roundhoward:  that would be pretty sweet
 ObsidianSW:  Keller would do good work on 24, but in the meantime, we gotta get some reason for him to have a blade arm
 ObsidianSW:  and have him be a psychopathic vigilanti
 roundhoward:  oh fuck
 roundhoward:  i wanna make a movie
 roundhoward:  about a fucking bad ass
 roundhoward:  with a crazy gun
 ObsidianSW:  a gun arm?
 roundhoward:  and maybe can get his hand cut off and get a big blade put on
 roundhoward:  or something
 roundhoward:  but hes like Duke Nukem
 ObsidianSW:  aka bruce cambell
 roundhoward:  and he fucking does dip
 ObsidianSW:  lol
 ObsidianSW:  that's hilarious
 roundhoward:  and spits everywhere"

"event","ObsidianSW:  I'm so fucking pumped 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm buying a few Kiefer posters for my place 
 roundhoward:  i have none, mom said she ordered me one, too bad she lied through her teeth 
 ObsidianSW:  I might buy three of the same kind and just have them in a row, or maybe on all different sides of the room looking at eachother 
 roundhoward:  how big is your place? 
 ObsidianSW:  ginormous for a kid 
 roundhoward:  so you have a shitload of room? 
 ObsidianSW:  like probably twice the dimensions of your room at home 
 roundhoward:  thats super sweet 
 roundhoward:  have you been meeting people? 
 ObsidianSW:  yes actually thank god 
 ObsidianSW:  I played two shows in the last two days 
 ObsidianSW:  (totally wasted I might add) 
 ObsidianSW:  and met about 3 or 4 people who I'd/I'll hang out with again 
 roundhoward:  amazing 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm going to be a rockstar 
 ObsidianSW:  and I met a girl through math class, a guy from italian, and I'm hoping my Rabbi neighbor and I can have some talks over the year because he seems like a fucking bad ass 
 roundhoward:  amazing, jack bauer 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah it should be the makings of a great year for next semester 
 ObsidianSW:  I rocked so hard at these two concerts 
 roundhoward:  tell me more 
 ObsidianSW:  I can proudly say ""holy shit, I know a rockstar and it's me."" 
 roundhoward:  what did you play? 
 ObsidianSW:  which songs? 
 roundhoward:  yeah 
 ObsidianSW:  that one I played for you most recently 
 roundhoward:  nice 
 roundhoward:  how was it recieved? 
 ObsidianSW:  then a one called surviving the savior, then the one we wrote together, then radiohead airbag, and then the fairly light 
 ObsidianSW:  People loved it 
 ObsidianSW:  one kid was like ""so uh... yeah... you set the bar pretty fucking high"" 
 ObsidianSW:  and then when he went on stage, he sucked hahahahahaha 
 roundhoward:  hahaha 
 ObsidianSW:  And I did all of this in the most drunken of stupors 
 ObsidianSW:  I find that being drunk really increases my powers by infinity 
 roundhoward:  being drunk makes it a different ball game when performing anything 
 ObsidianSW:  how do you mean? 
 roundhoward:  totally different experience 
 ObsidianSW:  oh yes 
 roundhoward:  when sober, you're very careful and focused 
 roundhoward:  when you're drunk, your confidence level is higher than anything imagineable 
 roundhoward:  and you're just like ""WHAAAAAT"" 
 roundhoward:  and rock out 
 ObsidianSW:  lol yeah exactly 
 ObsidianSW:  it was so fun 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm still so precise though, even though I swagger around 
 ObsidianSW:  like for 'the fairly light' I go ""I don't need this HAH"" and I throw my pick to the ground 
 roundhoward:  did anyone know how drunk you were? 
 ObsidianSW:  and I play with my hands 
 ObsidianSW:  and then I was like ""hmm where's that pick"" and I bent over and there it was and I picked it up in one deft move and then kept playing 
 ObsidianSW:  I don't know. If anyone was even remotely perceptive they could have seen that I was tanked 
 roundhoward:  hahahaha 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah it was fairly great 
 ObsidianSW:  my jewish neighbor is a genius 
 ObsidianSW:  he looks like he's in his 30s max 
 ObsidianSW:  but he's fully decked out with the beard, curly cues, hat, suit, etc. 
 ObsidianSW:  except his suit is bad ass, it's like a gangster suit 
 ObsidianSW:  like from snatch or something 
 roundhoward:  hahahaha 
 roundhoward:  thats fantastic 
 ObsidianSW:  and I was like fucking around in my room last night with this kid cullen 
 ObsidianSW:  and I was trying to figure out how loud I could be 
 ObsidianSW:  (I was still quite inebriated to the max) 
 ObsidianSW:  and I send cullen out of the room 
 ObsidianSW:  and I start clapping wildly 
 roundhoward:  hahahahahaha 
 ObsidianSW:  and I go ""can you hear that?"" 
 ObsidianSW:  and cullen's like ""the clapping? yes."" 
 ObsidianSW:  and my jewish neighbor (who I had never met, and until this point, feared tremendously) comes out 
 ObsidianSW:  and I almost make pudding 
 ObsidianSW:  but he goes ""just to let you know, we really don't care about the noise. Are you a musician?"" 
 ObsidianSW:  and I'm like ""yes!! here!!"" and I show him my guitar 
 ObsidianSW:  and he's like ""okay I believe you!"" 
 roundhoward:  haahahahha 
 ObsidianSW:  and then the rest of what happened, him leaving, etc. is a total blur 
 ObsidianSW:  but I remember thinking he was really really great  
 roundhoward:  i love getting that tanked 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm pretty sure I acted like a total fool 
 roundhoward:  good work soldier 
 roundhoward:  i have class now so i gotta run 
 roundhoward:  BUT ITS BEEN FUN 
 roundhoward:  ::vanishes:: 
 ObsidianSW:  later doshy 
 roundhoward:  oh wait 
 roundhoward:  ::reappears:: 
 ObsidianSW:  yes? 
 ObsidianSW:  LOL 
 roundhoward:  i have something great to tell you 
 roundhoward:  my next bowl 
 roundhoward:  the name 
 roundhoward:  will be 
 roundhoward:  COMMANDER WEDGE ANTILLES 
 roundhoward:  and his carrying case will be an X-Wing 
 ObsidianSW:  thank god 
 roundhoward:  anyone who says Wedge Antilles is anything short of a total bad ass Rogue Squadron leader would be lying through their teeth, and they know it 
 roundhoward:  okay bye

"event","Entertheminds:  lol youve got tons of shit! 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah it's not produced though dude 
 ObsidianSW:  it's fucked up right now 
 Entertheminds:  yea but you lay down the base of the track and take it from there, ive already got ideas for at least 4 or 5 songs 
 ObsidianSW:  dude, if you're thinking about jumping into this shit I have to worry about your professionalism 
 ObsidianSW:  that's just now how you do things 
 Entertheminds:  lol 
 Entertheminds:  how do you define jumping into shit? if you have an opportunity you seize it 
 Entertheminds:  im not sure what you think the process of ""producing"" is 
 Entertheminds:  but its not some long drawn out 9 month procedure 
 ObsidianSW:  Dude, I am a producer. You need to arrange, rehearse, get SOME idea of what you're doing. 
 ObsidianSW:  These songs don't have drums, bass, strings, even thought about 
 ObsidianSW:  I have no idea what I want the songs to sound like 
 Entertheminds:  of course but do u think being in the studio is just doing the exact 16 bar part and thats it? of course not.  
 Entertheminds:  you arrange and rehearse at the studio, thats part of the process 
 ObsidianSW:  not on studio time you don't  
 ObsidianSW:  I mean some people do 
 ObsidianSW:  Metallica does 
 ObsidianSW:  I can't really afford to do that 
 ObsidianSW:  I like to be professional 
 ObsidianSW:  And don't like go into things half cocked 
 ObsidianSW:  I've been doing this since I was 15 
 Entertheminds:  so you think its more professional to try to get a cello or violin player to come to a project studio figure out what theyre going to do and then go to the real studio to do it while paying them 150 bucks? 
 Entertheminds:  cuz thats not at all. if you have great players, stuff comes- besides the fact that the whole thing is if this guy can come through studio time wont be an issue at all 
 ObsidianSW:  Listen man. I'm not jumping at anything until I know who my drummer is, know who my bassist is, etc. 
 ObsidianSW:  You don't just pull folks off the street, even if they're kenny aranoff on drums 
 ObsidianSW:  It's just bad business. 
 ObsidianSW:  These things have to be thought out. 300 bucks a day is great but you don't just leap into these things without a full team already picked 
 Entertheminds:  whatever though- i have to question YOUR professionalism for even trying into question mine when im trying to hook you up at electric lady for less then 40 bucks an hour, maybe even less then that 
 ObsidianSW:  I mean that's great, I'd go there and check it out maybe lay some shit down since it's practically for free at that rate 
 ObsidianSW:  but I can't say that I'll commit to doing a whole album that way 
 Entertheminds:  yea, but how long does that take? its easy to find great session musicians- you've heard the drummer i use, viola player, etc. finding your session players isnt a 6 month process either 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm not saying it's a 6 month process, dude. 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm saying it's a process. 
 ObsidianSW:  Not something you just go out and do without any thoughts. 
 ObsidianSW:  I've never even met your drummer. I don't even know your full name. 
 ObsidianSW:  How can you be talking about jumping in to doing something like this? That's rediculous. 
 Entertheminds:  right but no one said you have to start tomorrow 
 Entertheminds:  YOU talked about jumping into it 
 ObsidianSW:  lol, I did? 
 Entertheminds:  yes 
 ObsidianSW:  You said ""if we can get hooked up, we should make this a starting sooner than 2 months thing"" 
 Entertheminds:  i said ""move on it soon"" which means starting a process now as opposed to the 3 months you said before 
 Entertheminds:  that doesnt mean go record on friday 
 ObsidianSW:  I'd like 2-3 months to fully plan out my schedule, find a drummer and bassist who I'm totally comfortable and can put my trust in, go over the arrangements for my songs, meet with the engineer, scope out the studio, etc. 
 Entertheminds:  and that certainly doesnt mean question someones professionalism when you clearly don't even know whats meant by a statement 
 ObsidianSW:  I have only 5 songs I like enough to even start thinking about recording 
 ObsidianSW:  Even jumping into it a month from now, without establishing the team, the battle plan, the budget, is rediculous. 
 ObsidianSW:  It simply can't be planned out like that in less than a month and planning could take more time than that. 
 ObsidianSW:  It's not a pick up and go thing. I've got 30k to spend, and I need to make sure I do it right. 
 ObsidianSW:  You have to appreciate that. 
 Entertheminds:  of course i do, but i dont think you still have any comprehension of what i meant when i said move on it soon 
 Entertheminds:  move on it does NOT mean start recording friday 
 ObsidianSW:  Nor did I think you meant friday 
 ObsidianSW:  but even if you meant three fridays from now 
 ObsidianSW:  I wouldn't be ready 
 Entertheminds:  your not getting it and honestly im not so sure if working with someone who questions my professionalism and clearly doesnt see anything wrong with that is going to be the best use of my time or my favors from other friends to give insane hookups 
 ObsidianSW:  What is my full name. 
 ObsidianSW:  Fast. 
 ObsidianSW:  You're taking too long, this should be easy 
 Entertheminds:  ben morris? 
 ObsidianSW:  Yes. That took you one minute. 
 Entertheminds:  your point being 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm supposed to be the guy you want to start spending 30,000 in less than a month or so.  
 ObsidianSW:  You should be able to snap my name off like it's nothing 
 ObsidianSW:  I have no idea what your name is. You've never told me. 
 Entertheminds:  its doug cohen- and you've never asked, and ive told you multiple times im down to meet up with you whenever your ready so im not quite sure what your implication is still 
 ObsidianSW:  Nevermind, Doug. I'm sure you're a great guy, etc. but I don't think this is going to work out. 
 ObsidianSW:  I have to get going 
 Entertheminds:  like ive said previously, no one told you about a start date 
 Entertheminds:  you took something i said and decided to question my professionalism 
 Entertheminds:  and you still havent apologized! 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm sorry, Doug. 
 ObsidianSW:  Good luck w/ everything I really need to get going. 
 Entertheminds:  sure 
ObsidianSW:  Dumb fuck."

"event","Listen, this post may get me a couple negative responses, but honestly this is a topic that makes me so furious... As those of you who know me know, I live in a huge estate with lots of frivolous things on it like a swimming pool and a tennis court. Those of you who know me also know that I'm not able to do a lot of things for myself, but I don't think any of you would say that my personality, my integrity as a friend, and my value as a human being has in any way suffered from the financial comfort my family has. 

Those of you who know my dad well at all know that he is a scientist who has revolutionized medicine, and has since the early 70s been working to rid humanity of diseases such as cancer. He was born into an extremely modest household, as were many of the fathers of the kids I associate myself with, and through sheer force of will and talent, dedicated half of his life to obtaining the training he needed to do an entirely selfless job. Through his brilliance, and also through a lot of luck, he happened to be able to make a fortune from his ideas, all of which have changed the face of the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, let alone countless other diseases and the production of all types of pharmaceutical equipment and drugs. My father's situation is so rare. He didn't go into this line of work seeking fortune- what scientist who wants to work for a public organization does?- but through hard work and talent (often at the sake of his sanity and health, and almost always at the sake of his family early on) he has not only changed the world forever, but allowed us to have the kind of (material) life that 90% of the world can barely even dream of. 

My mother had about as hard a time growing up as anyone who you could ever meet- 7 syblings, abusive parents, constantly relocating, etc. But she worked her ass off and went to college. She was a teacher until I was about 10. She doesn't work now because she doesn't need to and because she is extremely busy administrating all this rediculous estate that we have (now. We didn't always). Even though my mom's childhood was something out of a fucked up movie, she and my father have the moral fortitude to have raised my brother and I to be people who likewise don't want to be part of the problem of society- at the sake of modesty, Josh and I are very positive people with developed interpersonal skills who want to contribute to the world in some tangible way and who want to help bolster our generation- one which is taking a moral nose dive so sharp that it looks like we're heading for another dark ages. Neither of us are obsessed with material things that do not pertain to our specific passions- his being movies and the equipment to make them, and mine being music and the equipment to perform and record that. How many times have you seen me just go out to the mall and buy a shitload of clothes (my wardrobe consists mostly of t-shirts I wore at camp the summer of 1995), or beg my parents for a mercedez, or withdraw thousands of dollars for drugs, or do any of the things so called rich spoiled brats do? So when I make my bed it's a little sloppy- so maybe I don't do the dishes- but I think you'd be hard pressed to say I'm any worse of a person for being rich. In a lot of ways, I think it has made me the person that I am- and who a lot of people really like being around. And that is what money is SUPPOSED to do- enrich people's lives! Since when is it SUPPOSED to be a curse, or a symbol of being desperate or destitute? Material things do not always improve life- in many cases they do not- but because there is this stigma against it doesn't mean material things CAN'T make life nicer! If my parents hadn't had the money to be able to support my passion for music, I'd still be obsessed with creating and performing songs- but the equipment I have allows me to record the ideas I have with a very professional sound and it helps me promote myself in an ever increasingly competitive field. 

And whatever. My family is probably amongst the wealthiest in my community, but we are in no way in the top tier of american wealth. And my story is shared by many of the people who I associate with within my community- kids whose parents work their hearts out (in my father's case, literally) and are never home (I have a friend who's stocked to the gills in nice cars, etc. but whose parents have NEVER been home). We have it good but being a Cold Spring Harbor kid does not always mean we have it easy. My dad, like many others in our community, spent half of their lives going through the educational process in order to EARN the position they are in which allows them to EARN the money we have and are rejected for having. If our parents are the people who are opening people's chests up and operating on their hearts, or defending other people in court, (okay, if they sell BMW's or increase the disgusting corporate control of america, maybe they aren't welcome into this argument), don't you think they SHOULD be payed well? Would you want your heart in the hands of a person who is working rediculous hours to save peoples lives who are being paid less than they deserve to be? I sure wouldn't. 

Anyway I have to run. Here's the conversation that got me so pissed off in the first place. If you think this kid is being an asshole, feel free to IM him and tell him he's a fuckwad.

Heineken63802: i saw u the other night driving....u were pulling out of sevs
jamoibabe: yeah my friend was like ""there was someone waving at you"" but i

any of this by fighting with eachother, it's a shame you feel this way
Heineken63802: yea it is
Heineken63802: cuz every child in cold spring harbor is spoiled to 
shit...and ill fight with anybody about that
jamoibabe: but all i know is i'm sick of hearing kids that don't go to

no idea how hard our parents work
jamoibabe: myles honestly fuck you!

jamoibabe: that's really lame

Heineken63802: yea but he makes prolly 10 times my dad
Heineken63802: im going to work
jamoibabe: well he has a totally different job

Auto response from Heineken63802: work

jamoibabe: we don't live in a communist society
jamoibabe: my dad went to school for 12 years and then did a 5 year 
residency
jamoibabe: with no money
jamoibabe: to have the well paying job he has now
jamoibabe: you're dad works prolly just as hard
jamoibabe: he just has a diff job
jamoibabe: so what's the big deal?
jamoibabe: there is no reason to be mad that kids have money in cold spring 
harbor because we all pay a huge price for having it...and that price is 
taking shit from kids that don't go to school with us saying ""oh fucking 
rich cold spring harbor brats"".....and we just have to take it cuz other 
kids never want to listen to the fact that the only reason we have money is 
because are working their asses off, missing out school plays, not comming 
to sports games, not helping them out with homework, missing their 
graduation, ect., ect., ect......we all pay for it, so there is no reason 
why we should be made to feel guilty for living in nice houses by kids like 
you, who won't give us the time of day to listen to the reason why we live 
in nice houses, nor will they even respect that fact that we have just as 
many, if not more, problems that everyone else has, it's really really 
really sad....but i guess that's the way the world works....oh well....."

"event","Read this conversation I had with a drummer who wants to play in my band. Pray for Mojo. This is what I'm dealing with. Oh yeah, he's talking about beating cigarette addiction in the beginning.

Timm5150:  I have another relapse 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah? 
 Timm5150:  but Im not sure I have another recovery 
 Timm5150:  I have an idea  
ObsidianSW:  yeah? 
Timm5150:  lets keep this going, over the next week, or until we end up jamming 
 Timm5150:  and lets not talk about influential music 
 ObsidianSW:  okay you got it pally
 Timm5150:  and visions for any projects  
Timm5150:  and then when we finally get in a room 
 Timm5150:  we'll just, see what happens  
Timm5150:  I get really good vibes about this whole thing 
 ObsidianSW:  yeah? that's really good I'd really like it to work out so that I can have a drummer
 Timm5150:  It feels right 
 ObsidianSW:  oh yeah oh yeah 
Timm5150:  I accept that I am the next generation of truly amazing things to come  
Timm5150:  I believe and accept, that my generation is going to define the survival or destruction of our race 
 Timm5150:  we are the last 
 Timm5150:  or the first of something totally new 
 Timm5150:  and somehow  
 Timm5150:  music always felt to be something very important in it all  
Timm5150:  and New York, this huge energy concentration, is a place that is going to play big roles  
ObsidianSW:  as long as the strokes don't jizz all over the place for too much longer maybe 
Timm5150:  there's a lot of smart fucking people out there 
Timm5150:  I think the big problem, is that smart people also tend to be the unstable ones 
 Timm5150:  it takes us awhile to get our chit together, and control our own minds  
ObsidianSW:  I guess so, but I'm pretty nearly a genius and I'm extremely stable 
 Timm5150:  I am a genius  


--I'm just going to pause here to let the weight of that last line sink in, everybody.--

ObsidianSW:  really? 
 Timm5150:  it takes work for me to be ok with a lot of things  
ObsidianSW:  like...touchings?  

--I'm going to pause here again to let the weight of how fucking funny what I just said was sink in. Everybody everybody!--

Timm5150:  I also have OCD tendencies 
 ObsidianSW:  I hear you 
 Timm5150:  I like being anal 
 ObsidianSW:  you enjoy being anal 
 Timm5150:  people get a little weirded out sometimes though 
 ObsidianSW:  understandable 
 Timm5150:  Im a bit of a borderline paranoid schizo as well 
 Timm5150:  nothing clinical 
 ObsidianSW:  Well thank The lord for that 
 Timm5150:  I just have to be a bit careful when Im deep in though 
 ObsidianSW:  deep in what, anus? 
 Timm5150:  thought* 
 Timm5150:  my head gets shoved pretty far up my ass sometimes:) 
 Timm5150:  thats why I still smoke pot sometimes 
 Timm5150:  turns off the machines for awhile 
 ObsidianSW:  the smoke from the pot sort of collects and lubes your ass so your head can escape, metaphorically 
 Timm5150:  exactly 
 Timm5150:  that fucker slides right out of there 
 ObsidianSW:  and it comes out, smelly, a little brown, but functional and ready to promote the positive creative energy of our generation 
 Timm5150:  optimism is my weapon 
 Timm5150:  thank god I am an optimist 
 ObsidianSW:  yes, praise Him 
 Timm5150:  I might be in real trouble were it not for that 
 Timm5150:  Im not all into praising God 
 Timm5150:  I take the Ayn Rand stance on that 
 ObsidianSW:  well then we can't be friends 
 ObsidianSW:  I'm all about praising God, with ceremonies, gift certificates, etc. etc. 
 Timm5150:  we could do ritual work, it all goes to the same place anyway 
 ObsidianSW:  the anus. 
 Timm5150:  God is suffering from a rusty metal pole being slid in and out of his ass 
 ObsidianSW:  Anus spelled backwards is Suna, the belief in emulating the Prophet 
 Timm5150:  that is truly disturbing 
 ObsidianSW:  It. It.
 Timm5150:  I just rolled out of bed 
 Timm5150:  this is too much 
 ObsidianSW:  it's seriously intense- we should definitely keep up these sessions though 
 Timm5150:  yeah, agreed 
 Timm5150:  I gotta get my day into motion here 
 Timm5150:  I talk to you doon 
 Timm5150:  soon* 
 ObsidianSW:  cool 
 ObsidianSW:  talk to you doon/soon as well, Timm. 
 Timm5150:  your my type of asshole, you know that? 
 Timm5150:  ;) 
 ObsidianSW:  I'll make sure not to drop any soap around you, then 
 ObsidianSW:  or maybe... I'll make sure to drop the soap 
 ObsidianSW:  ...lover. 
 Timm5150:  hahahahaha 
 Timm5150:  my girlfriend will not hesitate to kick your ass 
 ObsidianSW:  then you better lock her away so you can protect my glorious asshole
 Timm5150:  I would never do that 
 Timm5150:  not even in jest 
 ObsidianSW:  how about in jestjest? 
 Timm5150:  what? 
 Timm5150:  Im going before you suck me into your homo-erotic fantasy land 
 ObsidianSW:  Jestjest. 
 ObsidianSW:  Yes, I suggest you run like the wind. 
 Timm5150:  is Jestjest a real word? 
 ObsidianSW:  Yes.

 ClsRebel97:  didn't you notice she is the aol today face? 
 ObsidianSW:  ................NOOOOOOOOOOO 
 ObsidianSW:  fuck, I want to morph into her father and then beat her some more, this time with a bicycle chain 
 ClsRebel97:  HAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA 
 ObsidianSW:  is she singing this stupid shit  
 ClsRebel97:  yep, she has a music video 
 ObsidianSW:  on what, the disney channel? 
 ClsRebel97:  no, they play it on mtv 
 ObsidianSW:  she's so worthless, all she is capable of doing is disney remakes 
 ObsidianSW:  you're kidding... god 
 ClsRebel97:  I know, LOL 
 ClsRebel97:  what do you know about her dad for real 
 ClsRebel97:  I have only heard little things 
 ObsidianSW:  I want to know why some asshole disney executive looked at Lohan and was like ""oh sweet hosana, we've found her! oh sweet providence, you have once again bequeathed to me a star so bright that she stokes the flames of heaven and burns like a lighthouse in the soul of mortal americans everywhere... thank you once again, jesus, for sending us lindsey lohan... who we shall make, with no difficulty because she is already so radient, into the world's biggest success since hailey mills"" 
 ClsRebel97:  LOL!!!!!!!! 
 ClsRebel97:  The end just sealed that for me 
 ObsidianSW:  all I heard about her dad was that she caught him masturbating to Parent Trap and she started crying and flailing around the room uncoordinatedly like a chicken and going ""nooooo poppy poppu nooooo poppy poppu"" and he eventually got so sick of it that he hit her with a lamp, dragged her out to the front yard by her hair and tethered her to a tree with a rope just long enough to get her near the street and near the house, but strong enough to keep her from doing either 
 ClsRebel97:  shut up LOL LOL
 ClsRebel97:  shut up LOL LOL 
 ObsidianSW:  no honestly what I did hear was that he was embezzling money from her 
 ObsidianSW:  that she found out, and that he beat her 
 ClsRebel97:  Yeah, I heard something like that 
 ObsidianSW:  and now there's a lawsuit against him 
 ClsRebel97:  Ic oudln't remember 
 ObsidianSW:  and that at the court date, he pulled out a giant penis (his own, he is very well hung) and within two or three beats he was shooting juice all over the room and screaming ""LOHAN! I'LL GET YOU FOR THIS LOHAN! YOU'LL NEVER BE SAFE! EVERY MOMENT YOU SPEND ALONE, YOU'LL BE LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND WONDERING WHEN IT WILL BE. WHEN IT WILL BE... DADDY'S DAY"" Last I heard, he was being approached by Disney to play the villain in Lindsey Lohan's new movie ""The Parent Set The Trap: Daddy's Day""  
 ClsRebel97:  LMFAO! 
 ObsidianSW:  Lindsay's only comment was said to be ""Yeah, when will it be daddy's day? Hmm..."" she then runs her finger onto a gluey splotch on one of the wood panels in the room and brings it to her lips: ""Hmm... Matt Aboff's tasted better"" and just when you think that's the end, she run's her whole hand through the mess and eats it hungrily!"

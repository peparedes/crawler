I woke up at 5:30 yesterday, well, the day before, time is a blur. 
Sleeping is on weird time zones that I've never even been to. weird.
Wake up, freak out, pack pack pack. I left an hour and a half early for blo-no, maybe to see someone...maybe not...
Got there, imagine that, an hour and a half early. Ate with Aaron at Zorbas.
I forgot how his eyes are. Pretty in that obnoxious way. Lots of catch-up, he paid. Ass hole. 
Borders, he's reading Dharma bums too now. Weird.
OH YEAH! I got an apartment. With stuff in it. Couches that are mine. (for now) and windows, and a dishwasher, and all sorts of cool shit. My major appliances are nicer than my parent's. Weird. 
Huge bed. Shop shop shop. move move. Shop shop, NAP. 
Woah, it's 1:30 damn, call Bryan, drive drive drive...almost into a lake.
Meet Bryan, chat, laugh, catch-up...5:30 AM. intended nap. nope...drive drive drive. 
No Tickets. Ice cream truck stops...but not that one from the winter of 2001.
Old school sing-a-long.
Home. 
talk talk talk...smoke...eat...smoke...its now 9:11 AM...that either means disaster or sleep...the latter."

however, if you would like some mild internet stalking, i have a new blog.
it's really just so i can post stuff home while I'm in England, but if any of you should be interested the address is.

http://walkingontheleft.blog.com/

That's really all I've got. 
I'm leaving Sept 16, so any time after that expect to see lots of funny random posts on there.
Facebook will probably have some photos.

During the summer I didn't have time, or the internet.
Now, my mind is a cluster fuck.

I need things like that sometimes.
I need to remember to eat breakfast before I go though.

I also love hanging out with my ""back home boys""
Last night was lots of fun swimming and being goofy and the rest of the world.
I am a little sad about something though. I guess I should have been expecting it, but I was not. I was not. 
I really don't know how to handle information sometimes. It just always comes from the wrong sources, saying the wrong things. Do I still know how to do this? Do I need to just  let this all go?
Where does reality start to cross into my fairytale? 
Ethan Hawke is really attractive. Even with really crooked teeth
How can I hold someone acountable for things that I don't expect to be held accountable for?
Becauuuse that's how I roll. I am unfair.
I get sucked into situations that I love and others are apathetic towards. I could give you a laundry list of names. People scattered around the country, world even. People that I once knew. and once gave a shit about.
Weird/
I get this every so often, and I still am not sure how to deal with it...
Oh well, perhpas I'll go hang out with my aunt....

i guess not really.
just dissapointing
not really
i dont know
its hard to think about life right now
i just want to put all of my thoughts together into something that makes sense
this used to be a way, and it's just not working

im watching the most insane show ever right now
mtv is insane to me
i just watched a show about spoiled little girls birthday parties
now im watching one about pageant girls, and their crazy moms.
this 16yr old just got lip injections
wtf
her parents are making her go see this coach for interviews
its stupid a lot
sometimes things like being home, and not having enough to do, and watching mtv make me really depressed about girls.
does that make sense?
of course I am not the best person. I am not the most well rounded, or conscious of everything around me. but these girls really do make me sick. and these girls are the people that other little girls are idolizing.
sure it would be fun to have a daddy with a credit card to buy me a pretty bmw for my birthday just because i want one, but really, this is not the life people should be yearning for.

oi

i do not like being home. as a side note.
i really have so little here that it makes me feel useless.
i know that the things i have are just other places, but it seems like it's all gone
i am really anxious to get down to camp where the craziness is non-stop
i need that constant activity..."

Spring break was amazing and life changing...
I have pictures up on facebook. It was a blast, and I met some really amazing people. Including Aaron, who has proven to be a great new person in my life.
My computer broke. I bought a new one on ebay. It's kind of shitty, but I guess I'll work with what I have...
I really only have to use it from now to summer. Summer means camp and no need for a computer. Fall means going to England, and not needing a computer...
PS. I got accepted to go to Sunderland. Hell yes.
Things are a little hectic right now. I don't quite know what to do with life, but we'll see.
Instead of doing all of the things I need to be doing I spent the day laying in the sun, and thinking and reading and writing. 
It was good.
I think I am losing my mind.
Probably...
I get too much stuff going on, and then I get stressed out, and shut down until the last minute. Must stop this. Ceramics does not leave room for procrastinating..."

"event","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tonight was fun.
I say it every time I'm there but hanging out at Bryan M's house reminds me a lot of high school. Listening to boys make fun of each other and play music in a basement. Chain smoking so much the room gets foggy. The boys all getting wasted face and me being sober and laughing. 

Tonight instead of ordering in some shitty food we went to the grocery store. Top notch idea. Lots of fun once again. Plus, way cheaper. Heck yes.
Speaking of money. I spent a lot of it today...eep
It was a lot of fun though. I got my hair dyed, bringing back the blonde stripe. We'll see how that goes. 

Plus, I bought 2 new pairs of pants and a bunch of earrings and some perfume, and a shirt. YAY for being a girl. And for being an independent girl and going out to play for the day by myself. 

by myself...I've been doing a lot of thinking about myself and my life, and sharing it and all that craziness. 
I'm not sure how I feel about it all yet, but I do know that I've got something in the works that is a lot of fun, and has made me feel good. I guess that's all I can ask for right now eh? Plus, we have matching feet, and make each other laugh.

My birthday was fun. Pretty low key but satisfactory. I got some fun things from my parents, including luggage for this semester i will hopefully not spend in Bloomington, and Chacos. I am already hella obsessed with them. Amy O the love of my life bought me a mr. potato head. Currently the pieces are stabbed into a real live potato and sitting on my desk. oh man, one more thing i have to remember to take care of before break.
2 phone calls I was counting on did not happen. It made me kind of sad. I always refer to some people as ""my best friends."" but apparently I was not important enough to remember. It really made me think about some things.
Where has it all gone? remember when we really were best friends?

ASB is coming quick. I'm feeling nervous about it. We'll see how it goes. Hopefully well...
I have a lot of things to do tomorrow. Laundry and packing, and cleaning the room, I don't even really know how to pack for this trip. Everything is so unsure about it. Oh man, I really hope I am not wasting my time with this. Hopefully it's good. I'm counting on it. If nothing else it will be a good story right? Plus, we're going to the zoo one day, that guaranteed to be a good time. I love the zoo. I hope the nashville one is something new and fun compared to St. Louis.

anyway...Time to go to bed, seeing as it's only 4:30 in the am. eep.

hung out talked danced a minute, 
Went to some cheesy bar with Bill and Scott and Kyle.
I must admit, I love those boys.
For those of you non-campy folk let me just set the scene.

Bill is a cowboy, from texas. He likes to make crude remarks, and smoke black and milds with the filter popped off. 
Scott is a cynical smart ass. He is a high school teacher and a really funny person.
Kyle is some sort of engineering student at u of i. he is one of the most laid back fun loving people i have ever met. 

I love all 3 of them.

We went to legends. a really dude-bro-ey bar in Champaign. a few beers and conversation ranging from where at camp to find indian arrowheads to whether or not it is more or less rude to spit or swallow. 

i miss camp.
i miss the staff.
i miss the kids.
i miss the nature.

lets go back.

I almost didn't go last night, because the weather was getting bad, and i am very very glad i went. i didnt hang out with the camp people i expected to, but none-the-less it was flippin amazing. as always. Went back to emma's and bill played me a song. and then some more songs that were pretty, and some that were funny, and we all slept sprawled out on the floor. scott's wish for life. ""i hope when im 40 i am still passing out on my friends kitchen floors."" 

i learned that snowflakes falling on your face is indeed one of the most sensual feelings ever.

i got to see lou for a minute which was fun, i finally saw him with a beard. i love beards. 

i have a lot of things to be doing right now, however, sitting on my futon being a bum is amazing.

I blew it off because I figured it would be some radical out there shit that wouldn't make sense to me. Something along the lines of Naked Lunch. I heard it's amazing, but I couldn't get through it. He did a lot of drugs, I assumed he probably still did, and would write like it.
One time this person and I had a few good conversations. Mostly about books and Mrs. Richey's English class. It was before I took the class. He told me to read Ordinary People. I did. It's a good book. Look into it sometime. 
I read his stories. They were actually good. A little dark. Made me wonder about him. 
He's dead. 
Over dosed. 
These things happen I guess...
Just not to people I once knew.

things are all right.
if i think too hard they're pretty shitty, but I mean, all in all I can't complain too much.

Friday night I went out and was ridunkulous!
it was fun.
I haven't done that in quite some time.
I'ts nice to be able to let go once in a while.

I'm feeling very distant right now.
I don't even get to see anyone im too busy.

im slightly obsessed with no less than 5 people at any given time...
mostly males...
i need human contact...

i just nude modeled for clare and amy it was funny.

the first night home was nice.
hung out with adam and steph and her friend tony, dj, lisa and her guy chris.
hung out drank some drinks
hy-ho-ed it up.
it was all in all pretty good.

tonight was pumpkin pie party at my house.
made pumpkin pie
played beat the clock to rent charlie and the chocolate factory before the pie was done
watched said movie. everyone else left except adam, who was asleep, and i had to drive home.

it was okay.

it seems like things are so much more different than i remember them

i guess thats how it goes

country music makes me weepy.
listened to it on the way home the first night. it was bizarre.
tonight i almost hit a raccoon on the way to adams, then almost hit a deer and then a cat on the way home.
southern il. please stop letting furry things go into the roads in front of my car.

one time, this time of year you called it perfect
now its fights with fire-hydrants...

i dont know what to say about the world right now.
not sure how to live anymore.
i miss...
i need to paint...maybe tomorrow...must set alarm

i forgot last night when i went to bed how amazing my room is. there are no windows, so there is no light. so when i woke up at 2 i didnt even know it was day yet...
i love it

did laundry...well some of it. 
i have a lot.
a whole lot...

i wrote it on my way and left it on your couch
i wanted you to be impressed

i wrote a poem once and posted it online 
i wrote it on my computer screen
I wanted anyone to be impressed.

i wrote a poem once and it stayed in my notebook...


6 felt tipped pages and still my mind wont be still.
i cant do this

life is ending all around
life is gone
run away from it
if you have the time and money...

no time
no money
not both together at least
the past rushes the future into mush
like these noodles
like my mind
""fuck my brain with the rocks and snakes and clouds and sky""
?
same thoughts
different states
listing to that old CD
hated it
loved it
forgot about it
cried to it
repeat
who do i miss what?
when does life stop?

end of thoughts
start of rant.

running out of time always running always jumping the fences 
stay on the fence dont think too hard either way
what are you what am i 
i am a rattle snake?
i wish I were
you might want to see me

people i miss overwhelm me
people that i cant possibly ever see again, and others that i just wont try to
others that are just too inconvenient

cry your eyes out little girl
i am high maintenance you told me that once. i believe it
i believed in you

i believed in you too

i have all of these thoughts directed at everyone and nothing to really say to them
i want you
and you
and you
come play 

stay the night
you have permission to love me
anyone

running around in my head is this image of how the world should be
how you should be
how we should be
but there are several ideals
i would settle for any of a few
but the attainable are not the reality of the ideal

are you following this because im not

i dont follow. or at least i tell myself that i dont, i really do.
i follow everyone like a puppy.
wandering in the footsteps

It seems as if life is moving more quickly than I thought.
Talked to Tyler today about BFA, and about study abroad. I feel like I should go first semester next year. I wonder what coming back here after being away will be like though.
I feel like being in another country could be really depressing for me.
I wonder how much I would really keep in touch with people. I barely have time for it here, let alone in a foreign country. 

I would have to do some hard core saving. 

I'm doing a lot of working lately. It's a little stressful on my studio life.

well very.
I don't know if I would be able to do this when I'm doing BFA and things.
I don't even know about anything right now.
I'm supposed to go class soon-ish. 
I don't want to.
I skipped my other one already, not ceramics, i would never skip that.
Really, there are so many things I want to do in there.
in fact i should go before my other class and cover some stuff up.

earlier i saw a commercial for m&amp;m's 
iron &amp; wine's cover of such great heights was playing...weird </span>"

gabby and evans wedding rocked my face off. it was beautiful.
Got a little wild, but it was way fun.
Got a speeding ticket on the way there, and broke my car kind of on the way back but still not enough to bring down the weekend.
im so sad now more than ever that i am not in lodge.
so many people have ""at camp"" away messages.
Waaaaaaaaaaaahh

my job is going well.
lots of hours.
got my first paycheck, that rocked.

my parents came up so my dad could fix my car, and they bought me walmart things, and a meal of not campus food. it was nice.

i worked thurs fri and sat which kind of sucked, but hey, i could use the cash right?

im not in the mood for this...

this would have been unheard of last year
i miss last year a bit
i have grown so much though no going back
I was listening to mates of state tonight, and realizing that i bought that CD last year this time after a visit to adam and really hard core falling in love with it
well, i remembered a speciffic time walking to philips listening to it, when it was this weather, and philip was usually thursday nights, it was interesting.
the feeling of one year ago, and how much different things are.
its insane.
There are very few constants in my life lately.
My sisters
Adam
Music
Art.

I guess those are the important ones anyway

this weekend
i can not wait
so many amazing people
so much love
so much beauty
no really.
camp is the most amazing place on earth
more aesthetic beauty, beautiful people, and amazing conversations than any place ever. I'm really anxious about bringing adam there, but i really want him to see the place that i really feel has changed me as a person more than most things ive encountered in life.

ah, just thinking about it makes me want to explode 
I made a painting for Gabby and Evan, I'm excited about giving it to them.
I really feel like it's a good piece, and I love being proud of something I made and having someone to appreciate it.

I'm enamored with life right now, yet slightly depressed, its an interesting balance.

I probably love you

"event","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">i found an old picture of myself while rummaging through deviant art.
i love it
its me at the south grand coffee co.
i went with adam and erica
adam and i were still dating.
i loved that the 3 of us could just hang out and have fun
theres smoke coming out of my mouth
i really love the lighting on it.
its weird to think about how long ago that really was.
i was still in high school
erica and i were really close
adam and i were both very different people

i was not who i am now is the biggest realization from this
i was just talking to mike, and it lead me to look through at my portfolio for getting into ISU's art dept. Very different from the way my work is going now.
it's amazing how much life can change a person.

I made a painting tonight for some one, well really 2 someones, but the point is i really like it, and i feel like it is a pivot point in my art.

i do doodles a lot, that are just shapes, juxtaposed and filled in black. lots of curves and swirls, and circles around the edges. i learned through this one piece that it can be artistic rather than just what i doodle and sketch.

im learning more about myself and art and the two in relation every day. sometimes i make progress, and sometimes, i just realize that previous assumptions are wrong. it's interesting.

this. this is why i am an art major.
i want nothing more than to keep on this experimentation and learning about myself and the world through the medium.

when i was upset about art and called matt we talked about how studio practice can change the way you view the world. and he isolated himself and worked a lot, and now he's able to look at the world through almost fresh eyes because he detached himself from it.

i dont want complete disassociation from the rest of the world, but im learning how to let life, and my art influence each other, its almost liberating.

the world is changing and so am i, and it's amazing how the two relate and dont...

sometimes i want it back. it was easier, but i feel like now is a period of rapid growth and realizations for me. and it sucks, and at the same time, makes me feel so much more.
feeling happy or sad or anxious, all of these things seem to be amplified lately, 
it hurts, but at the same time, it's amazing.

ive encountered people in my life with the complaint that they dont ""feel"" and doing things that didn't allow progress to help them ""feel"" its weird to think about being numb.
the things that were done to feel, i do to numb my senses. 

old habits are hard to break.

make one off hand comment and send me back into an irrational pattern of past solutions that didn't work then. but for some reason, they're like a security blanket.

my head is on fire lately, and it isn't this winter hat.

Kristin, and Carl, attention, your icon is the same icon.
weird.

I feel the need to let more things out lately.
I haven't really been as social this year as last.
Perhaps I'm just growing apart from the people I used to have, and not having enough energy for new ones. That's not even it though. I miss the last year Crew like hell. I just really do not have the mental energy for much human interaction lately. The interaction I do have is very surface level.

I miss hours of conversation over coffee.

I miss the kind of conversations I used to have with Philip. I used to think that that meant I missed him, and or our lack of/relationship.
But I'm realizing I just miss the KIND of interaction we had. I'm striving to get it back, but there are not many people like that.

I need to call Matt again and whine, I know it will make me feel better, but I always have the vague impression that he doesn't have the time for it. Not that he as ever expressed that, I just have this image of him ingrained into my head of what and who he is, and that he is too important to spend time conversing with lowly me.

I miss my family like woah sometimes.
Especially the sisters. However, I'm starting to be on better terms with the entire family as a whole. I realized that orange goop. The prefered hand cleaner of old men who have dirty jobs, is also amazing for removing oil paint. that was nice to know. And had a chat with my dad about it, it was cute. I also had a long chat with my mom about life and where mine is going etc. She doesn't get it, but she isn;t fighting it.

I wish I could afford to go see Christy over Thanksgiving. we'll see...</span>"

some people really hate smoke and i do not.
i dont like musty stale smoke in houses.
but i really do like smoke on people
like, my hoodie, or being next to someone who smells like smoke and soap, and a boy.

well, my mind wanders
the most amazing place to ever consume a cigarette is in my reach in a few days.

i like the cold.
i like the need to wear a scarf, i like the need to have someone rub your arms.

i like people, and being close to them

i feel like the world may or may not be closing in on me.
i feel like i really need to start focusing on school work that does not involve art.

i failed an art history test because i did not do the backside. boy do i feel like an ass.

i even studied a lot for it.

my lj entries get pretty long sometimes.
i dont think people really read them, and im okay with that, sometimes its more about making them than it is people reading them.

im too lazy for a real journal.

although there is something pretty romantic about words scribbled into composition notebooks furiously while drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes.
its funny how interchangeable the words romantic and cliche can be.

interesting.

i need something

i need to learn how to make needing something not needing someone.

""realists like ourselves are even emotional sometimes""
a phrase that could have come out of two different mouths.
except: im less realistic towards one, and desperately trying not to be emotional with either.

i try to hard.
at everything.

i miss pamco 

i feel like tomorrow will be a ULBC shirt day...

that means nothing to most people. and the world to me.

bowling alley's are pretty funny places.

Good because I made the best painting ive ever done today. not to say that it was actually good, but it was the best I've done.
And bad because i fear that I wont be able to sleep now.
Let's just see how it goes.

so much confusion 
so many decisions 
so little difference between good and bad.

at a bowling alley
its pretty fun
i think it will be more fun if i get to work with Drew.
I heart him
So does everyone else.
i don't feel like some of the people at work have really adjusted to me yet
one boy imparticlar accused me of being ""one of those punks that listens to all american rejects a lot.""
weird.
I loathe them.

too bad when i was talking about the bands i do like, he decided i was lying because he had not heard of any of them
interesting.

ive been hanging out with julio and mike and craig a lot more lately
well, at least at their apartment
its been interesting. not exactly my crowd, and sometimes really awkward, but sometimes amazingly fun in a really different way

i suck at all competitive activities, but last night i won once. and it was amazing.
but i feel like i won on sheer premise of someone else sucking more than me.
who knows.
who will ever find out.

in other news, this week has been insane but tonnight was low key.
got out of class, ate dinner with tim, who i adore.
napped, did some ceramics, 
fucked around online
talked to adam,
got some Jimmy Johns' with Amy
Hung out with julio and Mike at random party
said hair cut.
hung out a bit, 
brings us to now...

this week has been a lot of ups and downs.
who really knows hwat life is doind and who cares.
lots of ceramics.
i am falling in love quickly with clay and glaze and everything about the ceramics department including the faculty and grads...thats a whole story for another time...

this program is amazing, you can customize your toolbar with a fun-ction that is a taco, that produces simpsons quotes, the only button option after it is...fantastic.

i support it.

To the point where I am no longer crying about the movie, but crying about something else. Crying about everyone ive ever lost especially the ones who are still alive.

I had some interesting conversations tonight. 
Two in-particular. I'm kind of having some sort of life break-down. I realized that I put flippin a sick amount of hours of work into this piece for ceramics, and that it will never be anything more than something to take up room in my parents basement. 

My first call was interesting in a very different way than my second. First was from a non-art perspective, and was really intense as far as doing the things that need to be done. and just kind of sucking it up if this is what i want from life.

The second was similar in principle but had really different content, and hit a really different note. The first was from hands down the person i confide in and trust the most. the second was a casual friend that was a BFA student last year. 

Amazingly enough i had a much more emotionally charged conversation with the latter. It's weird how someone who I didn't even spend that much time with, or REALLY know that well, I could connect with so well talking about life in relation to art. I don't know what it was, but it was a mind blowingly amazing conversation.  

There are just some people you encounter that really do have some startlingly amazing impact, with out ever knowing it, or realizing how much good they are doing.

I have either had pointed out, or identified in myself a lot of shitty qualities that I can't seem to shake. I don't know.
There are a lot of things happening in my life right now that I can't seem to get a grip on, or care about.
I wonder when things will just settle the fuck down.
I need a stable something, and I just don't have that right now.
I need to quit trying to make that stable something a person. I need to realize that it can be something within myself.
Not only that it can be something within myself, it has to be, or it will be only another temporary solution to problems that will keep happening.

Current goals are some of the hardest things ever to deal with.

Let's learn how to live all over again.

e: The painting class I used to hate with a passion is getting better, the painting we're working on right now I don't loathe with every fiber of my being that's a start right?
f: My ceramics piece is going really well I feel. At least that has been the response I've gotten so far, and I stayed a bit late today to talk to my instructor about glazes, and I think I have something neat figured out. Yes. 


Life has been on a good roll lately, except for sucking at classes that are not art, and sucking at keeping track of money, but ya know, the important stuff like my studio classes are rocking, haha


Now, to get ready and pick up Tim and head out for champaign....

"event","You know... I don't know what to believe anymore... I have had so many people stab me in the back or lie to me.. tell something to my face and say the opposite to someone else.. how can one self be so mean? but that's life... I hate it when someone says ""I have never lied to you"" but you find out from one of your birdy friends that he/she did.. or he/she is lying.. 

Now that I think of it.. I can understand why ""someone"" can't keep a girlfriend... HE never has his head on straight. I once thought he was the one for me.. but now I'm startin not to.. I hate puttin up with someone who is really childish bout certain topics. It's fun to play games... but not screw u over games. I'm sick of being screwed over... and pushed aside.. Maybe It will stop one day. but you know. you can't control your fuckin heart... I've tried. don't work. Wish I could be like - STOP LIKIN HIM! but it don't work like that either

*sigh* Maybe I'm wrong bout all this... I don't know.. sorta hope I am... because I don't wanna loose him. I've grown so close to him. He's one of my best friends and I don't wanna loose what we have and you know.. I don't wanna give up either.. you learn from ur mistakes And I hope he comes to realize.. if you don't act fast you will loose a really good friend who doesn't care bout your past and never gives up on you! Man...Already lost one best friend over somethin stupid.. don't wanna loose another."

Got to verizon bout 10ish -10:30ish. Text Josh and Ash, they found us and we waited in line then finally got in. EVERY Time you turned around, you were given free shit. every tent you went to - free cds/buttons/stickers. I GOT A LOT OF FREE STUFF! 

Durin My Chemical Romance ( were the best( I love them ) ) A weak moshpit was started (well it was big to me because I'm so small hehe) well pushing and shoving and bodies flyin over ya was a lot of sweaty fun until Brandon fell and his lense popped out - couldn't find it! so we had to leave MCR's perfomance to call his mom and him go out to the car and get his contacts. that sucked. but We DID meet  a lot of bands that are just now starting out and heard a wittle bit of most of them too. Several of them weren't that bad. 

- all day long walking and looking. 6 stages!  And the last band that played was Hawthorne Heights.   VERY GOOD.   

We got Senses Fail and Thrice's autograph. I wanted Matchbook Romance and Hawthorne Heights but we didn't find out about it in time. I also wanted My Chemical Romance and FallOutBoy but they weren't signing. :(  Josh, Ash, Brandon, nor me got to see FallOutBoy. because we were in line for Thrice's autograph. We heard them though - they sounded gre-e-e-a-a-t!

We got pictures of ..... MCR.... Relient K..... Senses Fail.. and Hawthorne Heights... I think that's all.. and I got a MCR t-shirt along with a Warped tour '05 shirt. 

When we got home, we had Burger King. We were so hungry the only other time we ate was at 9 AM! We didn't want to spend money on food there - it's outragous! BUT there was free water... the only thing that sucked yesterday is that My Face Got FRIED! It's really red!

Other than that, it was awesome! I AM going back next year. It is soo0o0o0o0o0 worth it. but I will prolly try to save a little bit more money... so I can get more shirts... cds.. I will be prepared Tho - sunscreen... bag.... headache medicine.... and a hat! lol."

Did some fun things this past couple of days.

Thursday, mom came home from California. She said if I wasn't in high school, we'd move out there - that's how fun it is. 
Friday - haha.. ok.. Hung out with Matt. First thing we did was go to Mcdonalds to see Holly and Sarah. Talked to them then went to Wallyworld and tried on clothes... backtracking..... Went saw Josh in Drive thru then Karma... AND THEN WALLY WORLD. Next - We picked up Erika from hospital >>> her momma is in there.. :( got gas.. Double cheeseburgers..... Went to my house and got cassettes HANSON! MARIAH CAREY! BACKSTREET BOYS! CASSETTES! CASSETTES! CASSETTES! haha.. around 1 am... mom texts me ""wanna meet us at Denny's for food?"" we agree.. I go to pull into the parking lot ... and.... RAN OVER A CURB!!! IT WAS SOOOO FREAKIN FUNNY! MATT WAS SCREAMING... then mom pulled up and she called Jerry. As he was fixing it we were cracking up. Matt is halerious. 

""Silly Faggot - Dicks Are For Chicks""

""You Say I Suck Like It's A Bad Thing""

Ok OK anyways..... The only thing wrong with it was it wouldn't start. All Jerry had to do was press a button in my trunk b/c my car is a 94 When it thinks its in a collision the fuel pump shuts off. After that we ate Denny's yummm then around 3... took Matt home and Erika and I went back to the house, took the dog out, talked with momma, then bed.


Saturday -Picked up medication for cat.. between 10 - 11 ( Can't remember! that's sad) On way home, saw Josh in Marsh parking lot. Drove over and talked to him till he had to go back to work from his break. Later that Day - I promised to take Matt to Goody's. So Brandon and I took him there. He tried on Jeans - boys 'n girls.. hehe. lol. fun.. let me tell ya. it was actually funny. took him home then hung with Brandon.

Today - gave Baby her medication at the house, mom asked, ""Are you hungry?"" So0o0o0o0o0 we had King Buffet, hit Wally World, Hospital, back to Wally World to get clothes for 2 kids - Katie and Richard - then well.. here I am .... typing this and Erika is over. We gonna eat sometime this evening.. back to moms and take Erika to see her momma in the hospit-tt-t--t-tal...

Come on Wednesday... HURRY UP AND GET HERE!!!! *growl*

Sunday - Started of a Little shakey.. but turned out FUN!

Monday - OK.... got a hold of Matt Camden and decided to hang out. First thing we did - went to Mcdonalds because both of us were hungry. Talked for ever with The crew.. then headed towards the fair. The fair didn't seem bad but we saw clouds.. next thing we know while walkin towards the back of the fairgrounds was wind picking up and sand/dirt flying everywhere! a tent flew over and a Blow up Taz started flying towards us. So we went back TO mcdonalds! then after the rain cleared up ( for a lil bit ) we went back to the fair. I got this cool dragon thingy that you can hang in your car - that's exactly what I did. Hung it in my car. Then he bought me a wrist band and rode rides. THAT WAS FUN MATT! WE NEED TO DO IT AGAIN! 

hehehe I love hangin out with my old friends that I still keep in contact with. Now I know why I am their friend and we hang out! so much fun - laughing and makin jokes bout everything! 

Anywayz....
then we spotted Brandon as I was heading to call him, so Matt went home and We ( Brandon and I ) tried to babysit. They didn't need me, so back to the fair. lol. Saw Eric (old buddy that moved away) gave him my wrist band then took Brandon home and home myself.

Today - babysit and I'm eatin chicken! lol

Holly - GO TO THE FAIR FRIDAY LIKE WE PLANNED!! I wanna meet your boyfriend. Bring him because I will have Brandon with me. So you need someone."

"event","Mama told me when I was young 
Come sit beside me, my only son 
And listen closely to what I say. 
And if you do this 
It will help you some sunny day. 
Take your time... Don't live too fast, 
Troubles will come and they will pass. 
Go find a woman and you'll find love, 
And don't forget son, 
There is someone up above.

(Chorus) 
And be a simple kind of man. 
Be something you love and understand. 
Be a simple kind of man. 
Won't you do this for me son, 
If you can?

Forget your lust for the rich man's gold 
All that you need is in your soul, 
And you can do this if you try. 
All that I want for you my son, 
Is to be satisfied.

(Chorus)

Boy, don't you worry... you'll find yourself. 
Follow you heart and nothing else. 
And you can do this if you try. 
All I want for you my son, 
Is to be satisfied.

(Chorus)"

I'm not your baby girl
I've done ugly things and I have made mistakes
And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines
I am rotten to my core if they're to be believed
So what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every word?
Nothing ever smells of roses that rises out of mud

Why do you love me
Why do you love me
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy
Why do you love me
Why do you love me
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy

You're not some baby boy
Why you acting so surprised
You're sick of all the rules
Well I'm sick of all your lies
Now I've held back a wealth of shit, I think I'm gonna choke
I'm standing in the shadows with the words stuck in my throat
Does it really come as a surprise when I tell you I don't feel good?
Nothing ever came from nothing man
Oh man, ain't that the truth

Why do you love me
Why do you love me
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy
Why do you love me

I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it, I do it again

I think you're sleeping with a friend of mine
I have no proof but I think that I'm right
And you've still got the most beautiful face
It just makes me sad most of the time

I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it, I do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

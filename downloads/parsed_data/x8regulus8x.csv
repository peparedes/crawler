So I had my money refunded and stephen and I drove around Chicago for about 4 hours looking for the Crowne Plaza. After we found it, stephen and I were bent over by crowne plaza and raped severly moniteraly. It was all worth it. I am speechless as to the awesomeness of the show. I enjoyed Dragonforce 10,000 times more than I enjoyed Green day. I would have to say it was one of the best days of my life, thus far."

"event","Hopefully I get into this sheet metal apprentice ship. I think i've had a change of heart since my depression days, when I was missing alot of work and sleeping in and whatnot, but i've really turned things around, since I moved out to get a taste of what the real world is like. It's hard work. Keeping track of everything that you owe people, maintainence on your car and fridge, cleanliness, groceries, and many other things. I think that when Sarah's lease is up, I MIGHT move back home and finance a car, live @ home till I get a nice chunk of cash saved, pay off the loan on that car, and by then, stephen should deffinatley be back whereupon we make our living arrangements. I still don't know yet though. Everything is still up in the air. Once I find out if I'm getting in or not, plans will start to formulate. I hope everyone's year is going good.

"event","I went to work this morning. It sucked ass. I woke up way to early. I was violently awakened from my slumber by my damned alarm. I wanted to throw it into muck. But, i didnt. I meandered to the living room, where i put on pants. The thought of me sleeping happily in a forest with chipmunks and bunny rabbits ran through my head like a motion picture. Then came the shirt. Socks shortly there after, followed up by boots. A string of cuss-words about being so damn tired, and out the door i went. 

Down the stairs, and to the sidewalk. Pull out the keys. Slip them into the lock. Turn, click, open. ****...i left my helmet in my apartment. Back up the stairs. Click, thug, click, thud...open. There is my helmet. A somber reminder of my hapless existence. Back down the stairs i drag myself. 

Driving. I hate driving to work. The street lights. I count them. 476 till i get to work. It doesnt have the same effect on the way home. 

I hate my boss

"event","It's a thrilling thought, that this planet as a matter of fact is run with Black Magic - a planet where magic is not supposed to exist at all in any shape and form, except in the movies and in books, and if somebody tells you it does exist, he/she will most certainly be ridiculed. After people have watched movies like ""Lord of the Rings"" they wish there was more magic in their lives; little do they know ... 

From the occult, mind control and Intelligence have developed. By taking over the Movie Industry, the Record companies, and by their control of the Fine Arts, they know how to influence the teenagers to dance to their own tune and accept their kind of reality. This makes sense if you look at what kind of ""entertainment"" we are enforced to enjoy. 

The music the teenagers have to listen to is often totally without quality and lead them into ""robotism"", apathy, violence and drugs. It's also used for mind control, as we shall see later. Real quality music is rejected by the big record companies in favor for those with lack of talent. Since Black Sabbath in the beginning of the 70:s and the Rolling Stones before them, occultism and Satanism has been promoted through the music industry. Many groups followed on the same track and have always been Hard Sale and heavily promoted and distributed. 

The same thing goes with Hollywood, which is also controlled and created by the Illuminati. The ""E.T""-movies, Dooms Day films and catastrophe-movies all align with the purpose to influence us in certain directions. Occult movies have also been made popular. All to prepare for days to come ...

"event","Okay lets see... I am going to start writing in here again... I said that last time but never did it because I gave up, I tend to give up on things alot. Well much has happened since I last wrote and I dont really feel like going into it all. Today I saw Tye Dye, Amber, and Nate....oh yeah and Aunt Linda, Danny, and Hailey or however you spell her name... shes like almost 1 now. I still can't believe Jamie had a baby... but Jamie wants nothing to do with the family anymore so whatever... I got to see mom too.. first time since Mothers Day. She hasnt changed at all. Still out of her mind... she was trying to tell me about some little kid she saw with a mowhawk that she thought wass soo cute... she slurred half of her words together and got soo excited about telling me. Father said he wouldnt blame me if I never talked to her again but I try not to hold grudges like him... I dont really care. I mean shes my mom.. I have to love her. And I do dont get me wrong. If I stopped talking to her I would just end up like my Father... not speaking to any of my family, I mean I dont see my family alot but I do see them sometimes... my dad doesnt. I don't see my dad's family as much as I use to when I was living with my aunt and uncle... its because my Father doesnt speak to them... and I dont see my moms side much lately because she doesnt call me. I have like 4 familys.... its very confusing... I have my moms side, my dads side... my aunts family because I lived with them for so long and they became a big part of my family... and then I have Ashleys family. I see Ashleys family everyday.. theyre great people and I love them. I'm really happy they let me stay here and I try not to be a bother. So yeah.... that was pretty much my day. School starts Tuesday and I dont want to go. I really dont want to see people. I know I can take the whole 'lesbian' thing again and the whole stared at or laughed at thing, I just have to do good with my grades. This town really blows. I'm already sick of most of the people here.... they don't like me much either. I mean there are some people that are nice and I'd like to see... but thats only a small amount compared to everyone. Oh well... maybe school will be cool... hopefully new people.. or I become better friends with someone. Monicas not here this year so I dont have her... she made it soo much easier for me last year. And ever since that fight we kind of had we havent spoke.... I miss her alot most of the time... but theres nothing I can do... so I'm going to go. Toodles."

"event","Okay last entry.... I would rather not explain. I guess I've decided to start writing again.. This journal thing I guess can help me get things out... I don't know. It would be like talking to someone but I have no one I can talk to about stuff.. maybe I should get a counselor but I dont know if I want one. Well anyways... lately nothing really has happened except me and Ash have hung out with Chad and people at the center, me and Lin hung out with people at the mall... and school shopping. Well lets see if I have any highlights of my days to write about.... oh yeah.. this week or last week at some time me and Ash were walking down to the center to meet Chad and his friends cause they were skateboarding... well it was really hot out and I tend to over heat easily... We saw Chad and called for him but he didn't hear us, so then we couldn't find him.. So we were walking all over trying to find him, I started to get very hot and dehydrated... I had to take breaks every 5 minutes. We started walking home but I couldn't walk anymore.. I felt like I was going to faint so I layed down on the grass. Ashley told me to get up because I cop was coming by, the cop stopped and asked if I was okay and offered us a ride home... so we got to ride home in a cop car with was kind of cool... I just wanted to sleep. Other than that we've just been school shopping... me and Ash got booty shorts haha.. we were all excited about them. I don't know why though. The only thing I don't like about this online journal thing is I cant write everything because there are some things I dont want people to know... but then it would also be nice to hear peoples comments about them... I dont know. Bye for now I guess..."

"event","Yeah, I was going to make my journal and all friends one but its too much work so I decided not to. Anyways.. yesterday I woke up at 8 because Brandon and Victoria stared banging on the door. And of course I'm the only one that gets up to tell them to stop, plus I'm the only one sleeping on the floor.. so yeah, I got 3 hours of sleep because I had gone to bed around 5:30 and woke up at like 8-8:30. Well Nicole, Ashley, and I hung arond the house for a while... We wantd to do something but we didn't know what. Lin and Becky came over later. Nicole left around... hmmm 2-3. So Ashley and I wanted to do something so we made plans with Chad. Lin and Becky left right when Chad came around 6-6:30. Chad broght over his skating videos so we just watched them.. they are sooo funny. I was lauging so much. Especially Chad as a mad scientist... it was great. So we watched the videos for about like 2 hours. Then after we went outside to wait for his madre. Ash and him were running around and fighting.... it was like major flirting going on. But flirting is a natrual thing for both of them, its like they're the same person but ones a girl and ones a boy. They look kind of alike too. And both are very attractive haha. I think if they ever had kids it would be the cutest thing ever, I told them that before. So anyways after the adorable Chad left me and Ash just came upstairs and hung around. I really love hanging out with me and Chad and Ashley, its wicked fun, they're two of my good friends... the flirtation might get annoying sometimes but still they're great. We're going mini golfing soon I think... maybe this week. We have to wait until Chads not busy. Me and Ash just watched the Sex Talk Show and then I watched X-Files while talking to Eric. He loves the show, so do I... its wicked funny. Sculder is what Abby use to call Scully and Mulder... she combined their names. I mean Scully and Mulder were always together, why not combine the names? haha. Well I just stayed up talking to Eric andother people... and I went to bed around 4 maybe. I woke up at 10:30 today. Lin is over and we're just hanging around... I guess Justin has a football game today and Lins going.. I don't know if I am. Ash might be going over her dad's to fix up her room since they painted it, she picked the color red haha. Oh well... write more after figure out stuff. .....It sucks to want to ask the question, what does so-and-so have that I don't have?.... sorry that just came to my head.... okay well Toodles."

"event","I changed my journal, its because I was watching SLC Punk and it reminded me of Abby... and I just like the movie. So yeah. Today.... pretty boring. Ashley left to get her haircut around 3... Lin came over earlier with Beck, I don't like Becky much. Shes very annoying and loud and bossy. Well Nicole and I went to the kitchen to make sandwiches and right when I walked in I stepped into a HUGE puddle of water. So we went downstairs to get the mop and we cleaned it up and washed the floor... then right when we came back upstairs to finally make our food there was another puddle! So we guessed that it was the dishwasher since it was just running... we went downstairs again to get the mop... we told Laura (Lin's mom) about it and she went up and checked it out. I guess our pipe was messed up because there was water everywhere, we had to clean it all out and clean up all the water. Lisa came home and made brownies. Nicole was looking through the newspaper to look for any Ware news, we acually found some too... it was rather sad even thoug I didn't know the kid. Steve Miner died from gettin electricuted while working at some fair thing... Nicole said she knew who he was. Then we had ronni and ragu.. hahah *say it out loud*...Some great movies were on such as The Nightmare Before Christmas, SLC Punk, and Happy Gilmore.. so me and Nicole just watched some movies. Oh yeah we did those stupid things where you put them in water and they grow into sponge animals... I got a blue Ostrich and named it Bob.. and Nicole got a green Elephant and named it Sean. And now Ashleys home talking about nothing... well something but.. crayness. Yeah and we're watching Signs... okay I'm going to go now.. Toodles."

"event","I hate liking someone or wanting someone to like you...and I hate having wicked cute friends and then starting to maybe like them or just wish they liked you because they're so cute and you're already friends with them. But if you like a friend, first you might be 'too good of a friend' for them to like you, second they may like your best friend and want to talk to you about her, third they may not find you too attractive or don't like you like that so thats why you've just been a frined. And everyone I seem to like or think is cute and wished liked me tend to like Ashley... she doesn't know how lucky she is to have anyone she wants. Its horrible for the people who like her though..just waiting for someone is all you can do. Everyones soo annoyed with this whole finding a boyfriend or girlfriend thing. Whatever...

Okay about my day, I hung out with people around my house... and I taped Ashley trying to skate.. it was soooo funny! Shes great. Justin fell in his face! The later on Ash, Nicole, and I went to the center and we just hung out with people there... I was more open and happy today excet fo now... I mean I actually talked and stuff. Mostly to myself but still. I don't know I'm a weird person... oh well thats it, Ashley and Nicole are sleeping. Toodles for today."

"event","Well last night I watched My Best Friend's Wedding... I haven't bawled that much in a while... I cried until I couldn't cry anymore. I don't think it was just the movie making me cry though.... the movie reminded me of things... I felt like I knew what Julia Roberts character was feeling through the whole thing... but there were a couple differences between the problems, but pretty much the same. I don't know... Lin fell asleep on me during it. Well I woke up at 10, me and Lin woke up at the same exact time and we both thought it was later... like around 4. We both agreed it was really early and tried to go back to bed but I couldn't. We got showered and got ready for my dad's party... I didn't think my cousin's were coming anyways, and Kim asked me if I wanted to go to the Peach Fest with her and Pete.. so I said yeah. So I waited for Kim and Ash came home... she gave me this black wrap around skirt thing to wear with my bathing suit I guess... or just as a skirt. Kim came over with this dessert thing to give to my dad for his party, then we waited until Pete came. He picked us up and we went to the Peach Fest. We walked around and saw people like Amber, Roger, Matt, and all these girls who I had no clue who they were. Pete gave alot of hugs... hes a cute kid. They were making fun of the singer lady on stage, it was kind of funny but I dont think she heard it... and some girl was dancing to their music. There was these baby puppies and kittens there too! They were soooo cute! So we just walked around.... and we sat down for a while. Pete sat on my lap..hah... it was funny, but I was mad at him because he kept calling himself fat and ugly when hes not! But it was a pretty fun night. It was better than being here at my dad's party, but I guess everyone had fun. Kim and I left the Fest around 7 something I think maybe.... Pete was suppose to ge a ride home from Kim but he was having fun so Kim thought he could find a ride home so we left. I hung around Kim's house watching Corky Ramano with Kim and her mom. Then Kim's mom brought me home around 10. Nicole is sleeping over... it was really weird walking into the room, because the whole me and Ashley not talking much... and then me and Nicole said nothing so I sat there while Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back ended.... I got food and a drink and Watched Virgin Suicides with them. A pretty good movie. Then we decided to watch My Best Friend's Wedding again... because Nicole had never seen it, I watched the end to Invader Zim first. Nicole fell asleep before the movie got good and now Ashley is sleeping too and I'm just finishing it up, I might cry again I don't know. I hate love, and I hate liking people... I just wish someone I liked, liked me back and told me. But then I would feel bad if when someone actually DID like me I wouldn't like them the same way back... errr!!! Its making me soo mad... So I guess I'll go cry with the movie, write more later. Toodles."

I don't get why she doesn't, I think shes wicked pretty and funny... and a great friend. She does get angry alot lol but she can work on that! (hahah anger managment Kim!) Shes great. And then we talked about maybe people who once likED me... which is past tense... and it made me want someone to like me now... and to tell me they did so I would know. Just to have someone I like like me... I feel really lonely, but then I want to be alone... but I can't stand being alone anymore! AHH! haha I'm sooo complicated! Maybe if someone still liked me... oh well. I wish I hung out with Kim and her friends more... like become a good friend with all of them haha... oh wow... Well I'll stop talking know... toodles.

"event","Well... for the past 2 or 3 days I have been hanging out with Linny. She came over my house and hung out with me. Aunt John and Uncle Becky were having these church people over to swim... so some came over and were swimming so me and Lin went in the pool with Brandon and Vicky... the church people got out of the pool and Lin was like I think we scared them. Well we got out and we went out to eat with my dad at Chilies or however you spell that.. we had to wait like 15 minutes for a table. Through the whole night my dad and Lindsay kept saying that every waiter looked gay, it was driving me crazy! I wanted to just be like why don't you ask them if they are instead of assuming! And my dad was being a snot and saying all the girls working weren't pretty...  he was being mean, and he HAS a girlfriend and he doesn't need to be looking... and he shouldn't talk, hes not that pretty himself. Well some of the dinner was funny though... we left and went to Dick's so my dad could get a golf glove. I got gum! Then we came home and Lin and I went online the whole night, she was talking to her boyfriend Matt and I was talking to Eric and someone else I think, haha crazy Lindsay. Erics a crazy kid too... oh wow, I have weird friends. Well we got up around 11 I think, we just stayed around the house for a while but Lin got bored... so we decided to walk to Dunkin Donuts. It was a good walk... then we got these coffee ice cream drink things. Then we walked to the high school and went to the rest of Jusitn's football practice. He is the weirdest kid I know.... you can hear his voice out of everyone, you just know its him talking. Then Lisa came and got us, we went back to the house got our stuff then I slept over Lin's house. Kim told me she was trying to call me and no one picked up.. and she wanted me to hang out, I felt bad cause I would have loved to hang out! Err haha but I was with Lin... hopefully some other time. Lin and I just stayed online all night and watched tv.... she was falling asleep on the floor downstairs but right when we got to her room she was all hyper and dancing and talking! Shes the cutest thing... we went to bed around 4-4:30 I think. We woke up around 12 today. I think we're walking to the golf course and then maybe going to the mall later today... we'll see!

Lin was hanging out in the room with her. Okay well let me get caught up. Monday night I went over Kimmy's house, I haven't seen her in so long! I missed her. Mike was over too... they are the funniest people together! I couldn't stop laughing. They seem like such good friends... sometimes I wish I had more of that with people... but oh well. Yeah well we had fun playing Rummy and stuff. Mike drew on the dog with some window marker thing, Kim drew on the windows. Mike told her to write 'Obey Mike!' which she did. Then Kim drew a picture of Mike.... it was the funniest thing I ever saw! We couldn't stop laughing! Kim looked like she was about to die... yeah it was real fun going over there, I just wish I was more outgoing and stuff... Mike kept trying to make me to devil horns because I got three 6's in Rummy but I wouldn't... I don't know why I wouldn't but I didn't. It was funny though, they're two great people. I wish I had a friend I was wicked close to that I hung out with all the time like that... Kim tried to ask if we could sleep over but her mom said she didn't want to deal with it or something so Mike brought me home around 11. Its funny seeing him drive. Well I got home.. talked to Ash alittle bit then just layed down. Oh yeah and I found out Josh and Ashley are going out now.... well I don't really know how I feel about that just yet... I mean I am happy for them don't get me wrong but... I don't know I don't want to spend my time talking about that. Well Tuesday Lin came over, she spent most of the time in the room with Ashley. I sat out in the living room watching tv. I went outside and played with Brandon, Vicky, and Lin for a bit then just came inside... Ash stayed in the room online all day. We didn't talk much at all. Then at about 10:30 I went into the room... wrote in my notebook and went to bed. I haven't gone to bed that early in a long time. Well I had nothing else to do so yeah.... then today I woke up around 9 but layed in bed till about 10:30. Ashley got picked up to go to the cape around 11:30. I just took a long shower and now I'm here...My dad's having some weird patrty on Saturday... I think my cousin Heather is coming... I don't know about Amber yet, and Lin is coming too... I was going to ask Kim but its her birthday that day and I thought she would be busy doing something with her friends and stuff, I can't believe shes 16... I love her. So yeah.... I guess at the party I'm in control of the music and thats about it... I'll wirte more when I can think of it. Toodles people."

Last night Lindsay, Ashley, and I stayed up late talking about <STRONG>ALL</STRONG> kinds of stuff... I never realized how boring I am, and how many less stories than people. It was fun, we got up around 1 I think. Then we just hung around and read pick up lines and came home. Ash wanted to go to Dunkin Donuts to get a drink but Lisa wouldn't drive us untill we sang 'Happy Birthday' to my dad and had cake. So Lindsay and I went outside and played on the pirate ship, Vicky came out and played with us. Then Vicky wanted to go in so we started walking and Brandon ran at me and told me to carry him. Brandon, Lin, and I ran around and played stupid games. Brandon ran after Lindsay, and he scratched us both. He has long nails. We went inside and had some ice cream cake and sang. Lin put the '3' candle on backwards.. it was funny. Ashley decided she didn't want to go to Dunkin Donuts anymore... so now I'm here. We're watching A Night at the Roxbury.... goood movie. Except its edited so it kind of sucks. I use to watch this all the time with Ash and Lin. Yeah.... the last couple of days haven't been great but I guess okay.... doesn't matter.... I guess I'll go.

SOMEBODY KILL ME 

You don't know how much I need you. 

While you're around I don't feel blue. 

And when we kiss I know that you need me too. 

I can't believe I found a love that's so pure and true. 

But it all was bullshit. 

It was a goddam joke. 

And when I think of you and I, 

I hope you fucking choke. 

I hope you're glad with what you've done to me. 

I lay in bed all day long feeling melancholy. 

You left me here all alone, tears running constantly. 

Oh somebody kill me please, 

somebody kill me plee-ase, 

I'm on my knees, 

pretty pretty please kill me. 

I want to die. 

Put a bullet in my head. 

Some good songs from The Wedding Singer.... heres a nice one thats happier than the ones above...

GROW OLD WITH YOU

I wanna make you smile
Whenever you're sad
Carry you around when your arthritis is bad
Oh all I wanna do is grow old woth you.

I'll get your medicines
When your tummy aches
Build you a fire if the furnace breaks
Oh it could be so nice growing old with you

Chorus:
I'll kiss you, miss you
Give you my coat when you are cold
Need you, feed you

"event","Hmmm well Ashley and I are at Lindsay's house for the night. Today was Vicky's birthday party, she turns 2 Monday. And it was also my dad's birthday... I think hes like 43 or something. I made him a card with a funny song in it, he&nbsp;didn't know it was a song at first... I should have him listen to it. I also got him shirts that Lisa picked out, he was kind of upset that one was red and said that Lisa didn't know him at all... he wanted the house to just him and Lisa tonight.... ewww the thought.... but Justin and his friend Raymond are there so oh well. Yeah... the day was okay. I was online alot of the time talking to like Eric and other people. After a while me and Lin went outside, Ash was with us for a while but she went back inside. We danced to like Backstreet Boys and stuff, it was CRAZY! Justin was fighting Carol (his ex-girlfriend) and if she won they were going back out and if he won he was going out with some Megan girl or something... hes soo stupid. Thats not a good reason to go out with people, because you won a fight, and if I was Carol I wouldn't want to go out with him again because he wanted to go out with another girl but thats just me. Oh well.. it was soo hot outside and I just wanted to jump in the pool but I didn't. Ashley and Lin's grandpa is soooo awful, well I mean hes nice and everything but .. oh god its funny. He asked Ash if she was prejudice and she said no, she asked him if he was and he said yes.... he was like 'I'm not all the way prejudice.' and she was like 'Like 75%?' and he said around 74%.... I was like ooooohhhh mannn. Thats horrible. Then he asked her if she would marry a black man.... she was like 'Well I have to wait for Gram to die first so I can get the stuff on the will..' haha that was funny. Her whole family is kind of prejudice and alittle racist.... like her Gram doesn't want her to go out with a black person... she said she would kick her out of the family. Ash asked her Grandpa if he liked spanish people... and he said he had nothing against them if they were nice to him, but they were mostly crazy or something like that. And Ash said that they were fine if they didn't make her eat their rice, hahaha she was joking but it was sooo funny when she said it. I really wanted to say something though but I held myself back. Oh well... now I'm just here with Ash and Lin. We were watching American Wedding before we left, I had never seen the whole thing, but we couldn't watch all of it. We were also suppose to go school shopping tomorrow but we're not going to now... I don't know why because I wasn't paying attention. Oh yeah and if anyone knows how to change the name or the comments thing so it says something other than 'comments', or knows how to add any other special features to these spiffy LJ's please tell me and help me out. Thanks... well I guess I'll go now. Toodles."

Little Johnny 4 is here till tomorrow so Ash and I watched him today. I was worried he was going to throw up on me so I gave him to Ashley... he doesn't like me much. My dad kept saying he liked girls because they had boobs.... I'm like okay dad. I fixed up Justin's (Lin's friend) journal for him.... so pretty much I did nothing today. I've just been looking for a new icon... can't find a good one so if you find one I might like tell me! I found another picture of Running Thing haha Abby, and this time he had a friend riding his back! haha Vicky is wearing my coat and its HUGE on her... shes soo cute. Tori (Ash and Lin's cousin) is over and we're just hanging around the house.... I'm bored. I want to change my comment thing to say something else but I don't know how and I don't know what I would want it to say....

"event","<P>Okay well I have to write this whole entry over again because my computer lost it. Well I haven't been writing as much lately... mainly because I just think it does me no good but I will keep writing now.. I also don't get many comments, oh well. Skittles are good... Well after Ash got back from the movies we didn't talk at all... I guess its my fault because I was in a weird mood and didn't want to talk to anyone but she didn't try talking either..I was in a really bad mood though... I don't know what was wrong with me. I didn't want to talk to anyone. I sat in the bathroom for a while....I had this weird feeling that I wanted to wash my hair... so I went to the tub and turned it on and just wet my hair... I didn't wash it but I wet it, so I sat there dripping wet and getting soaked. Then I walked into the room and just layed down.... Ash fell asleep before me so after she didn I checked who was on and talked to Eric for a couple seconds and then layed down... I watched Daria and fell asleep. I woke up around 10 the next day, Michael and Ben (Ashley and Justin's half brothers) were coming over because Ash had to watch them. So Ash and I hadn't talked in a while. When Nicole called her we started talking a bit but not much.. but we eventually talked. We just hung around untill Ben and Michael left. That night Ash was online talking to Nick, Mike, and Josh..... yeah... I was sititng around. Then I got the idea that I wanted to sleep outside becuase I had read something that said that night was the best night to see the meteor shower. When I went outside it was really cloudy but we still decided to sleep out there. So we sat out there but it was still cloudy... but when we turned the light off we saw that part of the sky cleared up and we could see stars.Ash had never seen a shooting star so last night was a perfect time for it... she was sooo happy when she first saw one. There was a really good one, it kind of looked like it was a firecracker going off... it like blew up. I was soo birght then just burned out... usually they just like shoot across. There was at least one every minute. It was nice, we just layed and talked and watched the stars. We fell asleep out there, but I kept waking up because I was being bitten by Skeeters and I became very itchy. I kept waking up, and then one time I woke up Ash wasn't there so I thought she went inside and I was right so I went in and layed down. I had trouble sleeping because of the itching but I eventually fell asleep. During the night my dad came in a yelled about the blankets and stuff out on the porch.. that was around 5 in the morning and I had went to bed at 4.... I woke up later around 11 and showered and just hung aorund. Right when Lisa came home Ash., Vicky, and I were going to the mall to get my dad a birthday present. They didn't have the cd he wanted just like they didn't for Father's Day... so Lisa picked out two shirts for him. Then we came home and just hung around....I hate when people don't tell you the truth because they think it will 'hurt' you, its worse finding out yourself....or when they think you can't figure things out on your own. And I'm getting so sick of my face... its really bothering me... oh well.... I guess I'll write more later... toodles.</P>

"event","Yup... I'm home now and its almost 8:30 in the morning. I'm no usually up this early anymore. Well my Unk woke me up to get all my stuff together... Abby was still sleeping so I couldn't really say bye to her, shes leaving for Canada today with Kayla and Aunt. Unk bought me a bagel and Dunkin Donuts and brought me home... and this is where I am right now. Ashley is sleeping and I seem to be the only one in the house that is awake.... well Ash and I seem to be the only ones in the house at all. Oh yeah I have to tell about Abby's birthday. In the morning I woke up to the sound of Kayla talking to Abby... she was trying to wake her up. She told Abby we were going to Hyannis to buy her shoes for her birthday... and that we were going to the beach. So we got ready and I put flip-flops on and Abby was like 'you knew about this too?'... and Aunt went 'surprise!' so she found out I knew about it too. Then we were all getting into the car and Aunt brought out a French memo board thing.... something like that and Abby was asking her why she was bringing it and the only excuse she could come up with was that she didn't want the cats to get it. So we were driving and then Aunt asks if we have room for one more person... and we pull into Amy's driveway and Abby was like 'thats why you brought that board' or something like that... so Amy came with us. We drove up to Cape Cod... we stopped at some place so we could change... I wanted real clothes on since we weren't going to the beach right away... then we got into Hyannis after getting lost a couple times... we asked some old people and they gave us directions. The old man had no teeth... well anyways we got to the store where Abby's snazy shoes were and bought them. Then we walked around and went into a cd store... Abby wanted cd's and I was the moron who forgets everything because I was suppose to let her pick out a cd and stuff and get it for her but I forgot my money back at the house... so she had her mom buy them for her. She got <U>Hot Hot Heat</U> and <U>The Pixies</U> I think.... so after that we stopped at a resteraunt and ate, I got potato skins which were okay... but grosssss nasty bacon was on them... <STRONG>ALOT </STRONG>of it so it wasn't too great. It was time to go to the beach after that.. Kayla and Abby helped us find our way there.. So we got there and Abby went to go change with Amy and Kayla and I set up my stuff with Aunt. I didn't swim at all, I was too into the book Abby let me read... so I read the whole time and Amy listened to music and talked on the phone... Abby and Kayla were the only ones who swam. So I just sat in my shorts and t-shirt and read.... I didn't even sun tan, well actually I never do.. I'm the kind of person who hides from the sun. I finished the book at the beach... it was amazing. Well a really good book I think... I kind of think that after every good book I read though, just like the character from the book I just read...I reccomend reading it so you should... <STRONG>NOW</STRONG>! Well after the beach we were driving home and we stopped at IHOP to eat. It was fun.... the ride back was long though. And I was very full and had to pee so my stomach felt like I was pregnant, I told Abby to feel it and she laughed and told Kayla to feel it..... I actually do look like I'm pregnant... I mean not 9 months pregnat but my stomach has a bulge to it when I stick it out or I'm really full and stuff like that. So we dropped Amy off and then Kayla off and I slept over again..... last night we were just online talking and stuff... I was talking to Ashley and Abby was talking to Nate. Abby was looking at people's live journals... she thinks its fun. She kept showing me pictures of Christian even though I have seen them, Abby is a cutie though. And then thats when she showed me Running Thing.... that just brought a smile to my face! Abby was laughing so hard about that green dinosaur looking thing with many chins that just keeps smiling and running and never gets anywhere.. haha. I miss Abby alot sometimes... but it was good to see her. I'm suppose to jump on Ash and wake her up but I think that would be mean, so I won't untill later.... I guess I will find something to do...darn! I wanted to write down a list of books to look at from the back of Abby's book. I can never pick out books myself so.... well I want to get that one anyway so I'll just look then. Toodles for now... I must go find something to do, weird being up so early.....(Oh yeah I got sick of changing color all the time so I'm back to normal....)"

I woke up around 10:30 and got everything together to come over here... showerd and packed... no one was online so I just wrote alittle something in my journal and put up an away message. Dad brought me here around 1.... he dropped me off at the end of the driveway... hes like paranoid I don't know hes weird... I felt kind of odd just walking up the long driveway... Well I go inside and Aunt and Unk told me to go up and wake Abby up so I did... she was still sleeping. Sleepy head.... yeah well after she got up and I looked around her room cause I haven't been over for a while..We both went downstairs... Missy (Abby's&nbsp;sister)&nbsp;called so I talked to her on the phone, its always weird with her on the phone... a bunch of awkward silences because I never know what to say... I never thought she liked me much. I had just missed her because she was driving back down to Texas and she had left a couple days ago. Aunt is on the phone with her now... Well me and Abby played The Sims for a while and made a Dragon lady.. she was old... well after that Unk brought us to Friendlys where Aunt met us there... Unk left to go to Home Depot and Aunt ate with us.. I didn't eat much and Abby made fun of our waiter.. after that Aunt dropped me and Abby off at some kids house for some show. I met Casey Abby's friend for the first time, she seems nice. Pretty much all Abby's friends seemed nice... I saw Amy there, I haven't seen her in a long time... it kind of made me miss living up here alittle bit... well the whole time I really just read this book Abby told me to read called 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower'... its really good. The bands there were...ehhh.... yeah.... one band tried to sing my favorite Thrice song... the singing was&nbsp;horrible... they didn't know any of the lyrics so that sucked. Casey left early with some kid I didn't know so Abby was kind of sad about that but we hung out with another one of her friends.... it was okay. My lovely Abby is turning 15 tomorrow at 12:17 pm! Shes growing up so fast, its so funny shes younger than me though... she seems so much older. I told her I'm letting her pick out a cd for me to buy her. I love her.... well... I don't really know what else to write... that was my day... I love Fiona&nbsp;the puppy here... well actually shes not a puppy anymore, shes getting older but shes sooo cute. I think thats all I'll write right now.... toodles.</FONT>"

I got up around 8 today but I went back to bed... I can't stand getting up that early anymore.. theres nothing to do. So I woke up again around 11 or so and just layed around. Justin already had Carol and Raymond over.. they've been over every day this week.. its kind of annoying. I mean he can have like 3 friends over when no ones home but me and Ash can't even have 2 friends over when someone is home... but whatever. Lin was just here but she left. Ashley and I just cleaned up today just like any other day... I have nothing else to do... everyones out doing stuff I guess and no ones asked me to hang out or anything soo... yeah. Ash and Justin left for their Dad's so I'm alone for the weekend.... very very boring unless I find something to do. I'm watching some movie that I've seen before.. it has Elijah Wood in it and Mandy Moore... its called... All I Want... its pretty good. I watch alot of weird movies... I have nothing to do so I end up flipping through the movie channels and find some weird movie that seems kind of intersting and I watch it. TV is such a waste of time though... but I really have nothing else to do....I guess somethings going on between Shelby (Ashley's cousin by marriage) and Jenny (Ashley's aunt, Shelby's step-mom)... I think the story is that Jenny's Dad's side of the family doesn't know Jenny and Darrel (Shelby's Dad) met and Shelby told Stevie (Jenny's little brother) and Stevie told his Dad ( Jenny's Dad) and Jenny got really mad at Shelby... so Shelby was calling her mom or something and was crying on the phone... I don't know I'm not filled in with every detail.... but yeah, its just something to talk about on here since my life isn't that exciting. Wow... only 9 people on... people must be out doing stuff. I think alot of people are at the mall.... but I don't really talk to many people when I go and I have no one to go with anyways soo... blah blah blah.... For any readers I have, what would you rate my journal as in exciting or fun to read.. or something to do with like you enjoy reading it or whatever... 1 -10 and please tell me in a comment..... yeah okay I feel stupid for doing at but I'm very bored. I write alot... I usually do but even when I have something big to talk about I don't write this much... I have more I can write about too... me and Ash had another kind of talk again last night, about HIM and people she likes and stuff.. I told her I didn't care if they went out because I don't want to get into the middle of it and I don't want to stop them from going out when they like eachother.... but she said our friendship means more to her and even if it sucks she wouldn't go out with him... we both decided that the postion we&nbsp;both are in&nbsp;really sucks because hes soo.... HIM! Errrrr... I don't know.. more to think about... well I go, this is alot of boring stuff for you to read.... toodles.</FONT>"

No one can really understand how hard is to go through something like this unless they have themselves....it hurts alot. Okay he doesnt like me like that but...  think Im even loosing him as a friend and I dont even think he cares. Maybe Im just meant to suffer.... but my last question.... Why does he have to like my best friend?.."

"event","Okay... I went to Spencers today with Ash, Lin, and Kim.. I guess it was okay... there was a bunch of people... Lin went off with Bri the whole time. I kind of just hung around by myself off to the side but it was okay... Yeah Im really confused lately... I dont know what my mood is because when I start to think I feel normal and happy something like someone else being mad or something ticks me off... like it seems like when I actually seem to forget stuff and be happy for a moment someone gets mad at me for it ... I dontk now. And I dont even know if I am happy. Alot has happened in a couple days... well it feels like alot to me. First I realized what a messed up person I am and how my 'friends' never told me anything about it... and how no one tells me how they really feel about me so it just builds up until they burst and yell at me... and then I get my feelings crushed like I knew I was going to...it kind of sucks but.. I dont know... like I dont want to say every detail on here because there are somethings I dont want everyone to know and it would just make me seem like Im complaining or feeling sorry for myself which I guess I found out that I do that ALOT.... I dont know... I wish people would tell me things like that before it gets too bad... and I wish I could control who I liked, or that they liked me... but the weird thing is I bet that if I was prettier and 'hotter' than it wouldnt matter that were best friends or not.... but whatever... yeah I know you probably dont know what Im talking about so Im going to stop cause I feel like a fool... okay Ill update later... toodles."

People were staring at us when we were leaving because we were wearing the skirts over our pants. Oh well. When we got back Linny wanted to watch Freddy Vs. Jason so we watched that... I think its one of the worst movies... the blood and killing is really fake looking and in the end no one wins so it like has no purpose. I just laugh through the thing cause... I dont know. My Dad is so weird.. he gets on my nerves alot.. today I guess he wants to take us to some cook-out thing. Im not sure if I want to go though... but he'll probably be mad if I dont. So Im leaving it up to Lin. Lindsay really like to flash people.... especially when they dont expect it. Shes....different. So I really dont know what Im doing today or tomorrow... Ive been getting headaches alot lately and it really sucks... Dad said it probably had something to do with my eyes but I can see perfectly. Okay so I guess I'll go now... toodles."

"event","Today was okay... I got up and walked out to get some breakfast and Justin was like 'Im calling Spencer!' and I was like 'okay..... do I care?' so yeah he called Spencer and they talked... Spencer even called him back later. But anyways... Lin woke up after me and we got dressed and showered... then cleaned up alittle bit and watched some music videos. Lin got a craving for chocolate so we walked to the Corner Store (Countryside) and bought a bunch of candy and stuff like that. The bedroom door was open and the cat was in the room when we got back so I knew someone had gone in the room then I saw that my away message was off, Justin had gone into the room and talked to people and stuff while we were gone. I swear I hate him and I hope he fucking gets hit my a car or something like that and dies slowly. After that me and Lin sang and danced to Britney Spears. Linny got this idea to wear her skirt over her pants so I did too...I wore Lins pink skirt. So I was eating my Ring Pop (Mystery flavor, black and white swirled)and we were dancing and singing, Shleby, Carol, and Justin were looking at us weird but we didnt care.. I talked to a couple people online but Lin saw Chris Martin outside... with no shirt so she wanted to go outside to see him. So I went out with her and we danced to C.A and Will Smith and all this weird stuff. We got bored of that so we went inside and started to watch Bruce Almighty and had pizza... we got bored again and decided to go swimming.  We swam for a while and Brandon and Vicky wanted to come in so we tried to have Brandon get Vicky into her bathing suit but he had trouble undressing her.. it was the funniest thing... she started to cry when he was trying to take off her shorts so Lin had to get up and help him. Once she got in the pool Brandon went and got his on.... it started to rain and it felt nice and looked really pretty. I taught Brandon how to swim with a lifejacket on. Hes okay now and we dont always have to watch him unless he asks for help. So we got out and now here we are... oh yeah my dad gave me this book.. well its really suppose to be a book but he said the book was dumb so he put blank pages in it. On the cover theres a picture of I think Sid Vicious and it says 'Dancing with Skinheads & other bible study topics'.. I guess Im going to start writing in it... things I cant really write in here. Ive noticed that Im a very self concious and shy person.... when I feel unwanted I wont go for walks or do anything with anyone.. I just go sit by myself somewhere. And I dont know... I always think no one likes me cause Im ugly or something... but oh well... Spencer told me he would dance with me to see if I really suck at it... hes a weird kid, but he means good. Well me, my dad, and Lin are going to a movie later tonight.. write more after...toodles."

"event","Today didnt turn out like I thought it would... it was suppose to be a fun hangout day thing... but it ended up not being that.... okay well first I got up and tried to fix the posters that fell because last night I took down the infamous GC wall finally... I was in a bad mood so I needed something to do. Yeah well I was half asleep trying to put them up, then after I cleaned up the house and me and Lin took showers then Ashley finally got up and took hers... so the house was clean and everything. Kimmy came over at like 1:30... we were suppose to have Kim, Aaron, Chad, Spencer, Carl, and Kyle over.... well for like teo hours it was only Kim... Kimmy and Ahsley were swimming and Ashley told me and Lin to wait for everyone else like Spencer and them cause they said they were going to be here around 3.... yeah well we waited for like and hour and no one came... so then we decided to get our bathing suits on and Ashley asked us to get her water and right when I was walking out shes like 'wheres my water you fool?' Im like WHAT AM I YOUR MAID?! Why should I have gotten her water whne I was out waiting for HER friends while she swam. Yeah well after that liana called and said Spencer and them were walking down the street so they came down and Ashley met them down the street cause Dennis deided all those people couldnt come over... yeah and I had to watch Vicky so she wouldnt walk through the fence and Ashley kept yelling at me to go stand with them when I had to watch Vicky I was like I cant but she like.. I dont know... well anywasy they wanted to go for a walk and she wanted me to go but after all that I really didnt feel like going so she got mad at me from that so Ashley and Kim went walking with Spencer and all that and me and Lin were inside cooking dinner and watching Moulin Rouge (which I LOVE).. so we just get our food when they come back and theyre all on the porch and they just come in and take a bunch of food... I dont know why but I was in a bad mood right then and I felt like saying 'ummm you didnt cook that so go get your own food' but I didnt... they like took a bunch out onto the porch.... I dont know I just didnt have a great time then... Then Ashley left with her dad and Kims mom picked her up... right after they left I dont know, I think its Lin but I cheered up while watching and singing to Moulin Rouge with Linny. Lin is like super great sometimes... she was talking about the Duke's mustache (spelling?) in the Moulin Rouge and she decided to take a sharpie and draw her own on her face... it was all squiggly then had curls at the end it was great. We went out swimming and took the cd player and played the Moulin Rouge Soundtrack and I was like singing (horribly)... really squeaky too but it was funny. And we were just swimming and singing and listening to stuff like N*sync and stuff. Lins mustache started to disappear... but first just parts of it so it looked like two curls on the sides of her mouth and then like a hilter mustache in the middle...  I havent laughed that much in a while... well we just swam with VIcky, Jusitn, and his girlfriend Carol.  The greatest thing was when Vicky tried to get back into the pool area and she got stuck in the fence... it was the FUNNIEST thing... her face was just a once ina lifetime thing. She started like almost crying but I was just laughing... Justin was like 'SHES STUCK!' and he couldnt get her out so she just sat there for a while but finally got herself through... I wish I had a camera. Well Justin and Carol decided to be stupid and jump from the top of the slide into the pool and they got in trouble so we all had to get out of the pool... even though me and lin wanted to swim later. So me and Lin just got ice cream and watched Mighty Joe Young... I think I was the only loser thats ever cried to that movie.. I cried in the movie theater.. well anyways I found my 'wedding' song today... but I really dont think Im going to be married but its a sweet song I love and I dont want to tell people cause if I do get married I'd want that. NO STEALING! haha...But otherwise... I dont know... I always feel like when I try to talk to poeple I have to be the one who tries to make conversation... its like they dont even want to talk to me thats why I dont really IM people... I wait for them to IM me... which never really happens but oh well. I guess I'll write more later... feel free to leave a comment... or IM me if you wish... toodles.

Ashley left to go somewhere, she didnt tell me before she left but she called me and I guessed she was at Sue's or something. And I guess I felt like I needed a day to myself anyway... I need alot of those but they never help. Its suppose to be time for me to think and sort things out but I always start thinking badly and it gets me all sad and depressed... I can never help myself. Ive been feeling really lonely... I guess you could say left out but not really cause even when people ask me to go somewhere with them I end up just sitting there not talking... thats why Ive been declining offers to do things... I dont know I just feel stupid following people around and just sitting there and doing nothing. Yeah if I talk to Kim or Eric theyd say they were my friends and that theres nothing wrong with me but... I dont know... Im not really close to either of them... me and Eric dont talk much... me and Kim are pretty good friends I guess and I do have fun hanging out with her and stuff shes wicked cool... but Im not that close to her and she also has Alicia whos coming home soon. So reallyI dont know.... I dont really have any other friends... pathetic right? Yeah I know... I dont talk to any of my other 'friends' anymore... so yeah that helps make me feel alone.. I mean when I come online (which Im on ALL day) maybe one or two people talk to me for like 2 mins tops... and then that will be it for the rest of the day... But I guess Ive gotten use to that lately...I guess friends arent everything.... but Im not doing well by myself either.. I cant stand being with a big crowd of people hanging out but also Id rather have someone than be alone... so I guess you could say Im afraid to be alone even though I do push people away when I get into moods... I dont know its weird... I cant explain myself. Anyways... Justin has his little girlfriend over... shes kind of cute. Shes all 'ghetto' though but this whole town pretty much is. Jacob is also over, hes one of Justins cool friends... well as long as Ive known him he has been... he lives downt the street. Him and Justin went through this phase where they werent friends but they are now and Jacob just got a mowhawk its kind of cute. Well Im just watching tv and laying down... I have a headache like always so I guess Ill just go... toodles."

Then I took a shower and just got dressed. I didnt even have my mind on food which was good for me.. I think today Ive eaten a total of toast and peanut butter, cereal, and bread. I just have to keep eating less. Well when we realized Ashley wasnt going to her dads tonight Spencer wanted her to go over so she asked me to go with her... and yeah of course I tagged along. I always feel awkward when I go over cause... I dont know Im not good friends with anyone and yeah.. I dont enjoy following people around. Well we hung around outside and Spencer played hacky sack with Ashleys well really Justins hacky sack. Well Spencer ended up kicking it over the house so that was lost fast. Then we went inside.. when we finally went down stairs there was a movie on. It was me, Ashley, Spencer, Carl, and Kyle. Well Spencer, Ashley, and Kyle decided to go outside for a while so me and Carl were left inside to finish the movie which was pretty good but I hadnt seen the beginning. It was kind of quiet since me and Carl dont talk... probably my fault but whatever... well Spencers dad came down and picked up alittle and watched the ending of the movie too. Then everyone came back and we went for a walk outside. There was some kid on a motor scooter and Spencer wanted to kick him off of it and take the scooter, Spencer was also sticking his dads stickers all over cars and mailboxs and stuff... Ashley had them all over her back. Well we went back inside and hung out for a bit then went in the back to look for the hacky sack.. we didnt find it but we ended up going into my lovely Bri's backyard and Spencer, Ashley, and Kyle jumped on the trampoline... well we hung outside then went in the front yard again and Spencer and his dad gave us a ride home... so we came home and ate something since my stomach wouldnt shut up and Ashleys hurt. Ive been able to eat less and not think about it as much but its still like Im hungry all the time when my bodys not... oh well.. I dont know what to do... I need friends... hopefully were able to have people over Thursday and stuff... we have to ask and plan tomorrow.... I know Ashley stops wanting to do stuff after we start trying to plan it but Ill try to get her back into it... well anyways nothing really has happened.... Ashleys sleeping.. and Im watching Big Daddy.. so I guess I'll write more later.. toodles."

Okay well just when I think my family couldnt get anymore screwed up my cousin Amber tells me that Jamie (our other cousin) just go married to her friend Jodi... which would mean that shes a lesbian which I really dont care about. But then she also said that she doesnt want to see her daughter or her family anymore. Which would mean Aunt Linda would take the kid... and some how her not wanting to see her family again is hard to believe. Oh well... I havent seen her since before she had her baby anyways. Yeah and on top of that my mom called today but Justin hung up on her but when my dad found out he told me that if my mom calls I could never go anywhere with her unless he talks to her... and that if I go somewhere she might want to kidnap me which I think is not true... I dont think she would ever try... but my dad told me to punch her and tell the cops if she did... I think hes over reacting... well yeah... anyways I think I need to lay down... toodles."

"event","Tonight was actually fun... first we got back from Lin's house then Kimmy called and asked us if we wanted to go to a show at Fat Cats, we had never been but Kim had invited me to a couple before but I had never gone. So me and Ash tried to gather money... we counted all the spare change we had... the two dollars we had, Lin gave us three... and Lisa gave us five. So when we got the money we got ready and picked Kim up. Lisa brought us. We met up with Coyle and Aaron. We hung out outside for a bit then went in.... all these kids were running around into eachother... super funny. The bands were okay. After the first band ended we saw Pete, Eric, Ross, and that other kid that I always see with them but dont remember his name. We went outside and hung out for a while cause it was really hot and people were all sweaty. Me and Ash kept singing and saying all of our inside jokes from movies so everyone laughed at us. Coyle took Lin's snappy preteen prebondage bracelet thing and he was like playing around with it and he tried to get it to snap on a bar of the parking garage but it went through the bars and fell into the garage and I didnt feel like walking in a getting it so thats there... I miss it. We went inside to watch another band then came out and hung outside for a while... we walked around and talked and all that good stuff. Pretty funny kids I tell ya... I wish I was like better friends with them. Coyle and Aaron are great... and of course Kimmy is the best. The funniest thing was when Aaron all of a sudden said 'Yo tengo hambre' and Ashley and I both yelled 'I'm hungry!'... oh it was great. After a while of joking around we went in and watched the last band play. I was standing next to Coyle and the big staff man was in front of us and Coyle was like 'I hope he doesnt leave..' and he kept saying he thought he was going to leave but he never did. People had to pass by me and they were all sweaty so I had to like lean over into Kim or Ash or whoever was behind me and into Coyle. I saw Eric and Ross and Pete and their friends running around being weird... it was funny cause they were so small. Then the band ended and we left to go outside... Eric gave us all hugs then we walked across the street to wait for Kimmys dad.. Coyle and Aaron had to go so they gave us hugs too and they left. The Kim's  dad came and drove us home. Oh it was such a good night... me and Ash have to go more with Kim and them. It was so much funner than sitting at home. We are also planning sometime this week for Kim, Coyle, Aaron, Eric, and maybe Chad and possibly other people if they want to come over and go swimming and hang out maybe get some pizza too. Kim just has to ask Aaron and Coyle and stuff... oh soo much fun.. I wish I was good friends with everyone so I hung out with them more.. oh soo great... well me and Ash are watching Sleeping Beauty so I'll write more later.. toodles."

"event","Hmmm.... well everyones ready for bed. Lin is sleeping and me and Ash are going to once I finish updating. Okay well today Mike brought up something about someone talking to Matt's girlfriend... and something about me being mentioned. It was weird... but she talked to me and explained everything.... so I guess I kind of get it now... sort of. Shes really nice... it kind of makes me wish I was still friends with all the people I use to talk to. But what can you do right? Ashley just had to talk to this kid who like country music.... we were 'uhhh...hahaha' it was kind of odd... but oh well..I dont really know what else to say... Ive been thinking about friendships, relationships.. and whats going to happen at school next year alot lately... I dont know... maybe I need some shut eye... So I guess I'll write more later when I have better things to say... toodles."

"event","Well today was actually not a day where I was stuck inside doing nothing. First I went out for that walk with Josh then I went to that show thing. I guess it was okay... at least I wasnt stuck inside the house all day doing nothing... and Kim was there too so that was better. The bands were okay.. the first guys had a squeaky voice... kind of funny. Ash and Kim tried to skateboard alittle bit.. I just stood there. Eric sang for his band... he was pretty good but Ive heard him sing before so it wasnt like I never have. Ashley kept talking to Petes little brother Noah... I think he liked her.. he was like 5 or so. Then the last band was really good, they said they had only been a band for about 3 hours.. they had one song and then they did a song by Thrice which was really cool. The singer didnt know all the words though but thats okay. I was singing along. The singer was wicked cute... he reminded me of Cute Hair Boy. But to my luck theyre both 18... not like I would even talk to him anyway. He had this cool star tattoo on his wrist. The whole time I was feeling awkward and gross and just out of place. When the pizza came and Ash offered me one.. the cute kids something that made me feel fatter than I already felt... Ash said something like 'what are you like anorexic' because I had declined to having a peice of the pizza and hadnt eaten much all day... then the kid goes 'whos anorexic?' and Ash pointed to me and then he says 'she doesnt look anorexic'.. it made me feel so fat and gross... I dont know but I guess it was still better than being at home. I dont really talk to any of the people that I knew there anymore... like Pete.. I only talk to him when I see him in person, and I dont talk to Ross anymore becuase... I dont know why, and Eric.. I talk to him sometimes but.. oh well... Then Kims mom picked us up.. we stopped by the Polish Festival thingy... I felt kind of weird cause Im not even Polish, its funny cause when I was in Ware everyone was Polish and now when Im in East Longmeadow everyones Italian.. and Im neither one. After that we stayed at Kims for a while and played Rummy outside on the porch and talked... then went inside and watched the beginning of Along Came Polly.. we got picked up and came home. Everyones gone in the tope house... Lisa's out with her friends... my Dads not home yet and Justins at his friends house.. so me and Ashley got all these movies from the basement and got some ice cream and plan on watching some.. shes watching Gone With The Wind now... so yeah... lately Ive been feeling alittle lonely... I always am but I dont know... its kind of weird that when Im online ALL day no one IMs me then when Ashley comes on for two seconds like 10 people IM her... maybe Im just eing jealous like always... I should be use to this... well I guess I'll go... toodles."

"event","My feet hurt pretty bad...I went walking with Josh today...it was pretty fun. He could only walk around for an hour though which sucked. We met up at the fire station. Josh was at Daves (his cousin) house. We just walked around and talked about things... it wasnt as great as the first time we walked around but it was nice to see him again. We talked about movies..people dying... he talked about when he was at camp and stuff... I talked about the book I read... and he talked about his family and soo on. I love the kid... but hes so busy that I hardly see him... I think that everytime hes at his dads we should walk around. Some old man asked us why cats sit in the middle on the road... me and Josh were like 'uhhhhh....' it was kind of funny.. plenty of laughs. He told me how he got kicked out of his band because he was at camp for two weeks and he missed practices or something I felt kind of bad... and guess who took his place??!!...Mike Coyle... I was like 'are you kidding me?' and I had my jeans on that Coyle signed and it was like weird. Josh is great. I wanted to talk to him about stuff but I didnt... maybe next time I hang out with him. But yeah.... I miss him... okay.. well I think me and Ash might go to Eric's show tonight with Kim and Coyle so that should be fun. I'm actually out and doing stuff today. If only I could do this everyday. But anyways... I should go get dressed again... toodles."

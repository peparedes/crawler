"event","In which Raymond contemplates a serious decision for the first time in...ever.

Hello, The Internet. You might not know this, but since the start of May of this year I have been living in Downtown Toronto and working at what is supposed to be my last co-op placement of my last year of my sub par community college based education. 

The job has been awesome, and while my hilarious plan to have a ""Summer of George"" (LIKE FROM SEINFELD LOL) has pretty much consistently turned into a ""Summer of Raymond gets his ass kicked by Real Life"", it has actually been a really good experience for me considering I have, for most of my life, been pretty much a lazy waste of a person. I've learned lots about taking care of myself, grown to appreciate what I have instead of resenting what I don't, and thought hard about a bunch of things that people my age have probably already considered and done or not done a half dozen times by now. In short I am finally working towards manifesting all the anxiety I have about growing up and starting to actually do it instead.

I fully intend to MAKE IT HAPPEN.

My job was not at all what I expected it to be when it started. I have made a pretty relentless string of horrible jokes about how my career choice resembles the movie Office Space over the past 5 or 6 years, and this one has been no exception.I may or may not have even known exactly what my job function was for almost the first two months. I literally sit at a desk all day adding and removing access for bank employees all over Canada. Sometimes I add new hires. Sometimes I terminate people. It is usally somewhere in the middle. I make a mistake? There is a guy who's job it is to tell us we fucked up. So sometimes I fix mistakes.

But the job has basically been boiled down to me clicking a string of buttons and typing a whole lot.  And using the enter key on the numpad for some reason. Hard Enter can hard suck my nuts. But the people are pretty awesome. The guy in the cubicle next to me tells me to fuck off all the time, and we flip each other off a lot. The lady in the cubicle across from me shares crackers and I learn valuable future parenting tips from listening to her yell at her son on the phone. The girl that trained me makes fun of me, but never gets mad when I accidentally stare at her boobs.  Them, along with the rest of the security admin team keep saying I should try and get hired on full time after the summer. That it will get really busy and they will need me.

Getting hired fulltime was way up there on my ""List of Goals"" for the summer. But so was getting my CCNA. So was losing 30 pounds and picking up programming again. So was having friends and going to concerts and all sorts of other shit that working full time has left me too tired to do.

I am kind of all over the place here, but I think that is the point. Basically my mind is in two places right now, and I literally have two entirely different choices for what comes next. Lauren and I have been talking lots about our future together, and my ""fallback"" plan back in May when I wrote the ridiculous list of goals, was to head to school with her every day (more or less) and spend the time she was in class getting shit done that I actually want to get done. Going to the gym, studying for my CCNA in the library. Building web sites for both her and myself. Reading a whole fuck lot and basically making up a little bit for those long dark years where my head lived up my ass. My plan was to even start blogging about it and use that as a jumping point for building up my web development skills so I can make Lauren a fancy site once she starts doing Graphic Design crap. The closer we have been getting to the end of the summer, the more likely is has seemed that this plan will be what turns into reality.

But then! Today! I got offered another placement for another 4 months in another department within the bank that deals way more with hands on server (Unix!) and networking and scripting stuff, which I am really interested in learning more about. I thought my decision was made for me when my coordinator from school confirmed that no, I am not eligible for a student work term when I am no longer a student. But my employer's student coordinator actually came back and said they have made exceptions in the past, and she had asked the managers of this new placement for special permission to hire me. Which I have not heard back about yet. This would mean another 4 months in the city as a corporate drone. Is it stupid to not feel ready to work fulltime yet? I am dumb for being so torn up about this, because I know either decision can be hugely beneficial to me. But damnit, this is livejournal! If I wasn't at least a little bit melodramatic in every post then what would be the fucking point! 

TO SUM IT UP:

If you want to move home with your beloved girlfriend and devote 4 months to focusing on things in a way you may never again get the chance to, turn to page 46!

If you want to live in Toronto for another 4 months and get hands on experience in a way more technical placement even though you don't know where you will live or how much your aforementioned girlfriend will hate you, turn to page 125!

If you DON'T want to get eaten by a dragon, DON'T turn to page 104!"

"event","1. When was the last time you were ""Raymond Drunk""?

I try not to drink all that much anymore because it usually leads to this, so the instances of me getting hammered drunk have greatly reduced over the last little while. That being said I am still pretty much socially retarded, so most times I go somewhere where there are: other people I don't know, booze and no Lauren it is pretty much bound to happen. The last time I did was a month or so ago at my buddy's girlfriend's birthday dealie. It was myself, him, his lady and a bunch of her annoying friends. I definitely got hammered drunk, stole her ""IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!"" pin and did hardcore style twostepping when they tried to get me to dance.
I also got up and left for pita pit when we got back from the bar without telling anyone and told the girl working at pita pit that ""I liked how she had boobs"". 
I lose at life!

2. Does it ever bum you out when we tease you all the time?

Hahaha no way, I like to know when I suck.

3. Are you done with all those comics yet, I have so many more?

I have hit a rut on Starman! I am on the second or third chapter of the second one though and I'm starting to get more into it. Just that and Astro City to go so I will try to work on it - I can't believe I never got into comics before though, one of the things I am most psyched about for once I move to Toronto is being like a 30ish minute walk from the Silver Snail.

4. What was the best concert you ever saw?

This question is harrrrd. It has been a few years since I even went to a show, so my memories have gotten a bit hazy since then. I think best overall would probably be Radiohead at the Skydome in uhh..I forget, just after Hail to the Thief came out. They played for 2 and a half hours and then I went home and masturbated for at least that long. Shows I miss the most though are the hardcore shows with a bunch of different bands. I really miss the atmosphere and energy from those shows. My favourite one of those was seeing Blacklisted and Down to Nothing at Sneaky Dee's. They are both still two of my favourite bands.

5. Will you send me a naked picture of yourself?

Yes - but I am going to get Lauren to photoshop my wang so it's huge.

hahaha....also, I am not posting it on livejournal, I need your email."

Dotted lines around my favourite images punch holes through the the days where my head was anywhere but floating free above the clouds.

I want your eyes to read the thoughts I cannot speak. Be my empty vessel and let me pour into you. Fill yourself with the words I wish I had, the things I wish I did.

Believe in the ghost of my confidence, balanced squarely on the shoulders of your faith. Pull the words from my lips and the strength from my guts.

"event","Yeah so I got breathalized tonight.

I know I don't usually tell any sort of story very often when I write in this thing, but tonight was a fucking story and a half.

For starters I have basically decided that the only reason I go to bars with my friends is because that's where my friends are going...I'm trying to drink less so I almost never get drunk anymore and just kind of hang in the background while more or less everyone drinks. That being said tonight was pretty much the same deal...A friend from school owed me a gram from a previous evening, and he finally gave it to me today at school. That's fine. Me being me I smoked a couple joints and had another joint left in a container I had. This is important background information.

Actually, let's go back. I woke up this morning at 6:30am so I could get ready and be at class for 8am. I learned subnetting, did math homework and listened to my linux teacher read from a text book. Still no police involved. Things are still fine here. After my first block of class, Lauren and I met up to rent movies for an upcoming lazy day and also eat food. After food I had to go back do a presentation in my ghetto communications class (pseudo english for ESL and retards, I didn't write no stinkin' placement test!) I talked for twice as long as the minimum because I definitely thought I didn't have enough of a presentation and my on the spot filler evidently overcompensated huge. Sweet. Despite being long, I have no complaints about my day at this point.

I happened to be on the phone as I was leaving my school parking lot, which I need a pass to get out of. This means that I only have one hand and some cards in my wallet end up on the floor of the car. I think I pick them all up before driving away. I am wrong. This is obvious foreshadowing.

SKIP AHEAD SKIP AHEAD SKIP AHEAD

In the downtime, things you need to know:
1. I rolled 3 smaaaall joints and smoked almost 2 over the course of the evening.
2. I begrudgingly drank ONE beer.
3. This is the important one and makes me have spooky-esque thoughts: Before leaving the library to do my presentation, I make use of someone who hasn't logged off of the school network's print credits. I e-mail my assignment to myself with the subject ""THIS IS BAD KARMA"", and use the print credits anyway.

My friends get drunk. High fives are had, pool is played  and for some reason bandanas are worn.I am now half asleep and on my way home. Skipping further ahead, I am roughly < 2 minutes from my house and going a bit (like 10-20km) over 100 because like I said, I'm close to home and want to go to sleep. I make note of a car's headlights as I speed past the road immediately before the one that my house is on.
Immediately after turning onto my road, the car turns out to be, in fact, of the police variety.
I shit my pants.
The guy comes to the window and asks for my licence. Great. I look through my wallet and hand it to him.
1. It's not my G, for some reason I have not gotten rid of my G2 (I think it's because I'm retarded)
2. I can't find my G anywhere in my wallet.
He asks me if I've had anything to drink. I tell the truth: one beer. He decides this is enough to breathalyze me. I am unshaken-- having already figuratively and almost literally shit my pants, I didn't think this could be much worse.
I am wrong.
I completely forget about my drug paraphanelia- container with joint and 2 roaches in it, rolling machine and papers. The officer does not and asks me what's in my pocket.
I tell the truth. He takes everything.
I blow in the breathalyzer and somehow blow a zero. The lady officer who gave me the test says she has never seen anyone who admitted to drinking (ONE FRIGGIN BEER) blow a 0.0 before.
I shit my pants again but for opposite reasons.
I have awkward banter with officer about my drug habits.
He tells me a criminal offence would ruin my chances of employment.
I nod. They let me go.
I get home and find my G on the floor under my seat."

I feel like I sift through the thoughts I've lost for glimpses of someone I can never actually be. I question my motivations and am not frightened by the complete lack thereof. Rather I take comfort in my lack of faith. I am strengthened by my throws of apathy and the uneasy comfort of a stomach forever twisted by the anxious desire to be so much more than a part of a society that I am at once chained to and ashamed to belong to.

----SEGUE SEGUE SEGUE SEGUE SEGUE----

Let's blink our way into the future, an entire generation passing itself by while the universe rubs its tired eyes...Stumbles in the dark as our temporary solutions give way to permanent problems.
We cannot know the truth but that does not wash down the lies that take comfort in the ease at which they pass through lips and into ears, into minds. We process everything but question nothing. The revolution has came and gone a thousand times, throwing itself again and again into the rocks, like the relentless assault of a seething ocean. Our heroes splash helpless against their targets while our villains readily walk the line between martyr and scapegoat. Lives so afraid of apocalypse that they unwittingly bring it upon themselves."

Alot of crap has happened since the last time I wrote up in this bitch, but I'm still kind of at a loss as to what to write...

Montreal was lots of fun. The roadtrip part was kind of lacking on accounta we weren't on the road for all that much of it, compared to the length of the trip at least. But I'd like to think we met at least part of the recommended triply intake of adventure. Seeing Montreal and pretending I know French was fun too. Lauren and I got hammered and took lots of pictures. We went to Ottawa too, where I was supposed to meet up with a friend I knew from Toronto...except for the part where Lauren's friends roommates told him I wasn't there. Yeah, that part was heavily rooted in suck. But we made it home and neither of us even died!

About two weeks after that, I went to Baltimore with Jen (who sucks) and some people from high school (who don't suck, but even if they did...It would be like they didn't compared to Jen, who, as noted..sucks). This is a trip that was definitely rife with peril and adventure! Some highlights include:
- A random ""Did we get all the drug paraphenalia out of the car?"" inquiry resulting in a heated search of the car and luckily catching the last exit before the border so we could ditch the pipe that I dug out of the glove compartment.
- Upon being pulled over at the border for Jen's car to be searched, realizing that our search was poorly done when a douchebag american asked me ""what i flushed"".
-They found another pipe anyway. hahaha.
-DFD owns my nuts...I got drunk and had good talks and good times and we didnt get shot even though we walked through the ""ghetto for real""

I am coming back to this entry after giving up on writing halfway through! Tying up loose ends = baltimore was sweet!

The past month a whole lot of nothing all that significant has happened. I'm sort of struggling at school, but it's more a result of apathy/""why don't i just play wow?!"" than not really getting the material....procrastination and general responsibility shirking is like the core of who I am! Working on finding a co-op right now though, so hopefully the efforts at desuckifying surrounded those efforts will pull me out of lazytown.

"event","It was new years! woo!....yeah, sort of. I went to a bar downtown with some friends and ferried people back and forth from the bar instead of drinking for some reason, it was still fun...ish, it's kind of a precursor to something sweet!
Operation: Not Dying in Montreal
Wednesday morning Lauren and I are taking a road trip to Poutineland USA(actually in Canada) with big plans for cheap adventures. I haven't been on a road trip since uh...whenever the last time I went to New Brunswick with my parents, which was at least 3 years ago.

Also this will be the first time I've gone on a road trip with anyone who wasn't my parents. Lauren and I might hate each other by the time we get there...but poutine is the cure for things like that...and if it isn't at least I got abandoned in a place with lots of strippers. After a day or two in Montreal (we haven't decided...we're staying at the roughly 8 star resort ""Le Travelodge"" the first night at least) we're heading to Ottawa for a day and then back in time to hopefully wow it up for a day or two before it's back to school.

I might be going on another road trip with Jen to see DFD's last show, my credit card is maxed out and the ticketmaster outlet in barrie doesn't sell them because it's in baltimore...soo I have to figure that out before the show buuuuut..yeah!

I read something someone else wrote randomly on the internet tonight and it made me write in my journal.

At our worst we find our best.
Shining failure brought to it's feet by the steady hand of a shattered absolution,
a hope that begrudgingly refuses to let go.
Every moment of relapse accompanied by the ghost of second chances.
The redeeming pang of,
""Still time to get it right, still time to set things straight.""
It's the certainty of the dawn that drags us through the night."

"event","and it's probably the best gift I've got since the last one that I don't have anymore for reasons I'm embarassed to get into.

I went to church this morning with my dad. It made me sad, and it made me happy.
I spent alot of the time I was there wondering if these people would love each other if Jesus didn't tell them to...It's a kinda jaded viewpoint to take I guess, but like...it seems like so many religious people live their lives so religiously that they're almost missing the point. At the same time I believe more things now than I have since I was like 12, so it was a good chance to think about some stuff like that. Except I forgot when to kneel...good thing they ring that bell.

It wasnt a good or bad christmas. it was just christmas, and i'm glad it's over. I'm still awake for some reason but probably by the time I wake up half my family will be here and I will wish I wasn't.

here are some things I wrote in yon journal that I wish I could express conversationally to certain people that I might never actually talk to again.

Drag me to my future with the practiced aggression of deliberate loss of control.
Kicking and screaming, my eyes are focused on blurry vision and a life half lived.
We are innocent victims who saw all of this coming.
A steady descent into a waking dream that only ends when you close your eyes and plead for sleep that never comes.
We walk in the moments buried beneath our tired eyes, bathing in the volumes of subtext we keep secret between the lines.
Caught on that hook, all efforts at happiness shred themselves on a stubborness that knows nothing but commitment to itself.

and this one is about the best friend i never had.

Write me off like somehow it matters, like somewhere along the line we were digging this hole together.
Like somehow I'm losing something that gave back more than I put in.
When really, this is reciprocation. The equation is finally reversed and the bullshit will cancel itself out.
Somewhere along the line I was more than just there. I was better than that shit up your nose or all the fucking lies that you told.
Because the truth is I dig my own holes and even if you were ever in there with me, even for a second, I can't let myself pretend I was ever anything more than a way to pass the time.
No love lost.
I'm pawning those memories for a shot at self respect.
Keep my name on your tongue, because someday I want you to choke on it."

I have watched my promising future fade into hopeless past as I pushed these broken memories from my mind a blackout at a time. My fear of hope has chased it into no tomorrow. A world of promise devoid of motivation, vast potential squandered in a sea of apathy. My optimism has given way to love of failure.


We should be outraged but our shiny faces smile and our clocks go right on punching while our lives go right on sucking and your wives go right on fucking. There is nothing left of happiness but the ghost of precious moments, fleeting glimpses into forgotten childhood. Draw a noose around your neck or bite the barrel of a gun, tired old analogies hammer in just how far we all have come.

So where's our anger, what will it take? A thousand more cries of 'it's too late'? We chastise our youth and ignore the old, bitter lives growing cold, cold, cold. We only feel this way because of what we've lost, stubborn refusal to pay uncertain costs. Swallow your ego and open your heart, somewhere you're still the same person you were from the start."

a giant strike through everything you ever thought you had. a line across those faces you only thought you knew, we're crossing out the memories of lives burnt out too soon. bitter lines block out days when we knew better and nights spent chasing dreams, the days when friends could still be everything they seemed. A line to chase away the same new beginnings with their tired old endings. A line across every failed attempt, every abandoned plan, every second chance. Block out that lingering past and erase our shitty future. Draw a line through your fears and your ego, a line through your love, lust and libido. A line through selfish pride, anger and remorse. Draw lines through those around you until it can't get any worse.


....I got the new(est) blacklisted cd finally and the lyrics are making me want to write stuff. I love writing but I'm pretty self conscious I guess...so like, while I'm writing I'm all like ""you suck raymond, way to suck"" and I think I try too hard and that might end up making it suck more. Regardless of that I still like posting it on the internet....I think it's because whether or not I'm good at it or people like it, writing is one of the only things that, when I'm doing it...I feel like I'm supposed to be doing it...like sometimes it just comes out and it makes me feel better.

Another thing about this band is listening to them makes me really wish I was in a band...a hardcore band probably cause they're the most fun for me live. I feel like that when I listen to hardcore pretty much all the time, but these guys make me feel like I could do it. Minus the part where I don't know anything about making music, other than that though....totally do-able."

Speaking of which, I started playing WOW again. Despite all former evidence to the contrary, this is definitely a good thing. World of Warcraft is more or less better than real life, and I'm not even saying that because I suck at real life. As long as I can stay committed to the idea that playing world of warcraft has some sort of significance to the rest of my life, then things will remain awesome.

Keeping with this theme it has become more apparent to me that video games in general rule pretty hard...My program at Georgian is ridden with game hungry nerds who've got less action than me, which means two things.
         One: I end up talking about games in some capacity for roughly 90% of the time I'm at school.
         Two: I still get to say ""haha, take a load of the nerds"", because of late my douchliness overshadows my nerdliness and I ain't got shit on some of these dudes.

Something that simultaneously makes college rule and me look like a creep is the enormous amount of really good looking girls that go here...it's enough to make a dude get really drunk at his friend's party and wake up with some girl...except that's completely metaphorical and never actually happened. haha.

Not alot of other stuff has really happened to me lately...I got my gst check the other day and am going to use it to make weed brownies (NOTE: it is common knowledge that the government intends for GST checks to be spent on drugs, booze or cigarettes and nothing else).

So that will probably be sweet.
yes.

As part of Operation: Don't Fail at Life, it kinda became apparent that there were some things that needed to be done to get ready for round two other than just know when I need to show up. I spent a couple hours wandering the begrudgingly familiar (this is a story, probably not for livejournal though) halls of yon Georgian College.

Things I did while I was there:
1. student card picture
2. no less than three seperate visits to the registrar's office for unrelated reasons
3. forgot where the bathroom was
4. got a new mission objective via cellphone from my dad (my life is better when I make it like video games)
5. felt old-ish...as a part of frosh day, i have to goto some sort of orientation event filled with prizes and a carnival (i seriously just want to learn!)
6. found out that I have to make an effort to get transfer credits...there is a good chance this means i won't get transfer credits...so, hello french gen ed! i hope i don't fail you!

After that I went to Lauren's for ""chickenloaf""...which really shouldn't be in quotes like that, because it was really a chickenloaf, but y'know...that's weird. Then we came back for beer, hangouts with my sister and cousin (negligent babymammas!!!!) and Lauren being really good at dvd movie trivia games.

...anyway, one of the funniest things we do at my work is tow cars when people violate the ""20 minutes limit"" posted on a buttload of signs in our parking lot...usually it doesn't amount to much because the douches who try to douche up some free parking from us make it back to their cars before the tow truck gets there, or they just accept the fact that they pulled a douche move and suck it up...Not this time!
on liiiiike....Monday of the long weekend that just past, the store was basically dead except our parking lot was full...I wasn't really too concerned because believe it or not I don't do a whole lot of douchey things (at least not while sober), and have never actually towed a car...i just laugh when it happens...so anyway i went to get lunch and when I come back one of the dudes i work with was outside looking at which cars could be towed...and then, he called a tow truck...I basically forgot about it, because that's what i do...I forget things (hey! a castle!), anyway, i eat my lunch and finish my break and go up to the office because i had to do some office-esque things (like eat ice cream and make fun of people through the two way glass), so I'm sitting there with Luke (the guy who towed that shit) and my boss Lorna (who is a catlady/cougar) and this guy comes in all like ""where's my car?""...so Luke tells him we towed it, and he's like ""well, call them and tell them to bring it back"" 

""well, we can call you a taxi""

 ""NO! I want you to call those people and tell them you messed up and to bring it back""

..it goes back and forth like this for awhile as Luke and I are basically just repeating over and over that we're not going to do it...so eventually Luke just calls the tow truck place anyway, and instead of saying anything like, ""we just towed this guy's truck and he wants you to bring it back"" he just says, ""ya, that guy you just towed wants to talk to you"" and puts the phone in the dude's face....followed by ""$296?! you've gotta be fucking kidding me!!"" (I had no idea it was this much, but at this point I knew the guy was a dick so it was really hard not to laugh)...the guy gets off the phone and really starts losing his shit...i started saying things like ""just chill out, man"" and ""it's just money, dude""...he told me I should pay it and then started telling Luke he was going to ""ring his fucking neck""....then I was like ""Ok you need to get out"", he wanted all of our names ""for the paper""...so I gave them to him and was like ""ok, leave""....except that was when the cop came in because apparently Lorna went to get him at some point in the middle of all this hilarity....the cop makes the guy go outside and gets our end of what happened then goes out to talk to him...and that was basically it...and the dude still had to pay for it, on top of having to admit to the cops that he threatened the life of someone who could've been like half his age.

And we haven't even been in the paper yet!

 People assume that we're dicks because our job puts us in a position to be dicks...but jesus christ, next time you think someone ID'ing you is being a jerk think about how many times a day they have to deal with retards thinking they're a jerk for doing their fucking job...and if you ever come into the lcbo in wasaga beach, wear some fucking shoes or I'll tow truck your face."

"event","Hello! it is tuesday!...in august?!
It's like I woke up and the summer was half over...I know not a whole lot has really happened this summer (well, at least not a whole lot of anything fun) but i guess the routine of work/bongs/sleep is kinda working it's way into my summer being a blur....that's not to say I haven't done anything fun this summer...I think i'm clear of the ""getting so drunk i wake up in jail"" stage of this summer and am into the ""hey, there are sweet things happening in august"" stage. While I look forward to school I also have ""wonderland season passes are the price of two regular admissions so we better friggin go at least once more"" day with Lauren and hopefully Jen and Jesse, the reunion of a toronto band I really like, staff parties and hopefully lots of warmachine and gamecube and hopefully getting kidnapped alot by Lauren. I know it's weird that I'm in a relationship again so soon and it kinda scares me, but things have been going sweet and she makes me happy.
A couple weeks ago I went down to Toronto for a bit by myself and realized that I miss it there sooooooooooooooo much...I miss being able to walk everywhere, I miss people watching all around the city, I miss crazy people on the subway, I miss going to shows and I miss the memories that are attached to the time i spent there...i kind of also really miss not living at home...it rules here because my parents are awesome and they let me get away with being a sketchbag, but I miss living on my own.
It's almost unnerving to think that my life could only be like....25% over at this point, what the hell is going to happen to the world before I die? Alot of people over the years have thought the world would end in their lifetime, but how close to being likely has it been as it is now? :P I'm not going to war if (when) there is one. My friend from work would go, and I understand and absolutely respect why he would, but even when war is the answer i don't think it should be...so hopefully there aren't any concentration camps for pussies. I don't want to goto the rapture either. I think that unless there's some sort of ""tormented soul"" claus...or some sort of contract of misery involved, that i could be pretty happy as a ghost.
Anyway the summer is almost over and i'm ok with that. I'm trying to take things a day at a time but also look at the big picture. Happiness and contentment are similar words but the difference is obvious."

"event","you know that feeling you get when it's summertime and no matter what is going on, it feels like everything can be ok just because it's summer and the days are longer and the sun is brighter and things are greener?

what the fuck happened to that feeling?

i feel like i'm digging myself into holes in so many different ways, but i guess if i don't commit to something i'll never go anywhere but deeper (into holes, each decision like another shovelful of dirt...simile and metaphor! SIMILE AND METAPHOR!!!!!!!!)....i'm retarded

...anyway, yeah....very little is going on lately...sometimes i wonder what it's like to not be socially retarded....buuuut then, bongs!

I definitely caught my parents watching showcase porno last night...came upstairs to get food and see some titties (on tv! jesus!!)....i laughed pretty hard and my dad said ""what?!?!""...they play dumb, which is for the best...i really don't want to sit down and have that chat with them.

in approximately 10 minutes i'm rolling up and off to work....more than likely going to be wading crotch deep in ginos but that's ok, my job rules....tonight =?!?!? probably more hangouts with some girl :D"

not really, but im starting somewhere.
I realize basically every shift that i'm so friggin lucky to have such an awesome job...and i work with sweet people (mostly cougars, except not really) who put up with me being a sketchbag and instead offer me longterm employment!!!
so yeah, i've been working a bunch more now that we're on summer hours...which is good because i have very little money saved for Raymond's attempt at an education v1.1...I still don't know whether or not I'm going to stay in parenttown or move to barrie, but i really want to move to barrie.
My social life rules lately...i basically just watch movies and cuddle with a ladyfriend or go play nintendo/warmachine at jesse's...I'm going to try really hard for real to straighten up and fly right and im trying to just take things easy for awhile and so far so good.
also, i met head automatica and probably scoped daryl palumbo's package...because we definitely only scoped the last song and a half :(

i like metal alot and it's awesome...so is digging up depeche mode and taking back sunday in between LL cool J while I tear down the shower with a crowbar....music rules, all of it! so do dance parties with my niece, biking to work but getting a ride home, basically every single warmachine model, warioware, bongs and having a day off tomorrow.

i think livejournal might also rule, because writing in it kinda does."

"event","hey so I'm posting on livejournal because i remembered i don't like myspace and also way less people know i have livejournal...so it means i can be less self conscious about things i write.

So basically my entire life is a crapshoot at this point...shit's all up in the air and shit and at this point it's either gonna stay there or get all over my goddamn shoes....let's pretend that means something and i'll ignore the fact that i have no idea what i'm talking about.

i should act way more grown up than i do at this point and i basically have no idea why i don't. I look at some of the things other people my age know/do/are at least able to conceive the idea of and it's like i'm that retarded kid i got a sticker for playing with in grade 3...i was his friend and everything, but i definitely knew about the sticker beforehand.

sometimes i think people think this way about me.

So much of my life has been lived for other people...and i'm starting to think it's not because i let myself get too attached/controlled/whatever the hell, but more because i basically have no motivation whatsoever to do very much of anything and letting people tell me what to do is just easier.

I think anyone that claims to be a completely unique individual is lying to themselves...but i still think they're right.

That is to say that, we are all individuals struggling to define ourselves as individuals. pulling out all the grey for ourselves until all we see is black and white. we separate ourselves from that crowd until we're all standing beside each other again. 

....i wish i had more interest in learning/doing things so i didn't ramble about things i have little to no concept of outside of my own.

i am going to school to learn how to build and maintain computers but it's been soooo long since i even pretended to know how to build and maintain computers....i'm pumped because:
1. i'll be doing something with my life other than being a waste of a person
2. i really liked working on computers before, and minus the fucking up i did, i was getting a little good at it.

i'm the opposite of pumped because:
1. apathy flows through me like heroin through that guy in trainspotting so i'm worried i'll go all ""meh"" again.
2. i'm really good at getting drunk and fucking things up.

ok i'm going to try to goto sleep for real this time...honestly if you read this say something to me, even if you're like...a creepy random person who will rape me as soon as i find out we're BOTH not actually 14 year old girls, but i'm still the pretty one so you figure what the hell and it's too late because i agreed to get the key and meet you in the room instead of the lobby...because i don't talk to many people, and if you actually read this whole thing then maybe there are things we can talk about."

"event","so i dont write in livejournal very often.

i've got a shitty cold and dont really feel like moving, so this is a last ditch effort to fend off boredom.

one of the problems i have with writing in a livejournal is, for me, it kind of defeats the purpose of having a journal. I feel like if I wrote all kinds of crap in here people would read it and it'd be all like I got violated, because like....i might talk to that person and they might bring up something i wrote in here, and then i'd be all like ""dude that's creepy""...i know this because that's exactly how i feel anytime i read anyone else's journal. another reason is that i really have no opinion on anything interesting, and that's a pretty general statement but it's usually true...i dont know if it's a motivation issue or just my own stupidity, but there are very few things that i actually care alot about, and even if they were something relevant to people other than me, i'd feel like an asshole getting up in everyone's bidness and making some sort of pitch about dingo torture in the deep outback.

ok, this is the part where i give an ironic and accurate depiction of a pretty common occurance of hypocrisy (see above then see below).

homeless people make me really sad. when i was like 8 i came to toronto with my family, and my mom gave me 5 dollars to give to a homeless guy. since then i've moved here for school and find it really hard to walk past people asking me for change without giving them any. i also feel like an asshole when i go to give people change, and i only have like a dime in my pocket....it's like, ""ok, well you're already reduced to living on the street and having no self respect, how bout i slap you in the face with this useless amount of money?""....i gave pretty much any change i ever had (that i didnt need for the subway) to people on the street...i realize that this is a huge issue, and it definitely has two sides, but just looking at the surface of it, it's something that really bothers me and i wish i could do something more effective about it.

music is something else that i have a pretty big interest in...i have no talent, and alot of the times i dont even know the words to songs that i really love, but live music is one of the few things that can put me in a good mood regardless of any other happenings that might be...happening in my life.

writing in livejournal is something that i feel should be done with little to no coherence.
i hope little to no people read this.
i almost wrote ""know"" instead of ""no""...i fucking hate when i type the other spelling of a word im thinking...not as much as when people point it out because they think im stupid, because that's just anal, and besides...jokes on you! i am stupid!
ohhhh that reminds me of another one....it's funny when people are talking about themselves and are all like ""OH MAN I WORE MISMATCHED SOCKS! I AM SO WEIRD!""
so that killed some time
ill go back to being sick and next time ill write something less useless"

i got paid, then i spent most of it on cds and beer....ohhhh and fubar, shit yeah finally.
looking forward to more metal/punk shows in and around barrie....apparently there is a music scene there, and now that i know about it i can stop saying ""i wish there was a music scene around here""....went and saw the 21st impact with the video dead there, and they were both damn good. looking forward to seeing at the mercy of inspiration with the thanatron solution and a bunch more localesque bands next week....i'll try to dance, but they should be fun nonetheless.

"event","And that's the end of that. Home for the summer now, and half my crap is put away, the other half is strewn all over the place. Last night in res was alot of fun, going to miss floor nine, but it's also good to be home.
The plan for the summer is going to be all about making money, hitting up bars legitimately, reading as many books as possible, going to as many concerts as possible (which is going to be hard without money and living back in the boonies....I'll train rodents to play instruments, and then start a mosh pit in the living room with my mom while a bunch of hamsters play the best of the top 40 charts).

Before I forget, that reminds me of how I thought there was a p in the word hamster until I was like 16. I thought it was hampster....and no, I didnt think it was silent, I am, in fact, an idiot.

I've always wondered where silent letters come from, and what business they have not really making any noise. They're like the useless ninjas of the grammatical world...ready at any moment to put a KNIFE in your back....ZING!

Back to the summer at hand; Im really looking forward to it, even if i end up working back at the parks....kinda ran out of steam there...probably going to bed now.
To conclude: summer good, pterodactyls bad."

Crap What's Been Going On Lately....
in between exams ive had a lot of spare time, so ive used it to accomplish absolutely nothing. Last Monday I went and saw Tubring again at the Rockit and they kicked some ass. Daiquiri (who played when they opened for Mindless too, but I was late that time) opened and they covered a bunch of funny pop songs and put on a good show. The crowd wasn't into it as much at this show, but Tubring still rocked the pants off. Saturday night laura and I went to see Dog Fashion Disco and it kicked major ass. A dude I went to high school's band opened for them and well.....they were kinda bad....but it kicked ass just to see someone I went to school with doing something as awesome as that, and their whole band was pretty pumped about it. After the show I went over to Julie's place and we spent a couple days just hanging out and basking in awesomeness.

It's my last week in res and it's looking like this:
1. I have 12 dollars to survive until I get home.
2. My parents took my fridge home, so any food I buy has like a 90% chance of being eaten by some mystery douche on floor nine (the only thing they're doing all the time, is being a douche).
3. I only have one exam left, and it's worth 60% of the mark and I went to the class twice.
4. Not sure where I'll be working for the summer, but I'll be 19 less than a month after I get home, and as a rule, that means it's going to be a good one.
5. Thursday (probably all day, I mean...why the hell not) Julie and I are celebrating the end of exams by getting so drunk we forget it all...which, if you think about it...is kind of ridiculous.

So I'll be home soon, which is going to be quasi-weird, but aw well it's only a few months.
ok, posse out"

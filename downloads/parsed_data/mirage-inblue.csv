"event","<p>Finished cleaning my room earlier, finally......<br />And I had time to watch  a concert dvd. Missed arashi so much so I watch arash iza now tour dvd. I remember I used to be so addicted to arashi back in 2004. And I love nino's solo in this concert. Konseki remains as one of my favourite nino's solo. I wish he can play konseki on piano. It's a pity that he is hurt at that time. I love this song...though it's really a sad song. I wonder what nino is thinking when he composed this song. Here's the lyrics and some translation. Enjoy!<br /><br /><br />Konseki<br /><br />kienu kienu samidare no ato<br />kawa-kanu namida no ato<br />kessenu kessenu yami yori ukabu<br />itoshi ki hito no kage<br /><br />yuuyake ga warau waru itteru<br />kimi to iisshoni egao surete<br />kyou no bango hanna-ni shioo<br />chissana sugoku chissana futsuu no shiawase<br /><br />shinde itta anata wa boku no<br />kokoro ni shimite ikita<br /><br /><br />hokano hito-o wa aishite mo<br />hokano hito de shika arimassen<br />iku goto naku kisetsu mata itemo     <br />hontou wa hanareta wa kieruno ga kowakute<br /><br />sumire wo mitsume, kono hanakire-e<br />demo itsuka wakare runo ne<br />toki wa yuukure, shuni majiwaruto<br />minamo ni futari no koshite<br /><br />kage wa kage wo kasanete<br />hitotsu ni naru no-o osorete<br />kizuku no ga ososhito<br />minamo ni hitori<br /><br />ano hi umeta kokoro no tane wa<br />hatsuka sugi nebuki majita<br />tsugata katachi chiga edo kawaran<br />uwai yasashii hikari<br /><br />Translation<br /><br />Lingering, lingering,<br />After the early summer rain<br />Undried remains of tears.<br />Unerasable, unerasable,<br />My beloved's shadow floats in the dark night.<br /><br />Walking along the river banks at sunset,<br />With you, we lead each other along with just our smiles.<br />What shall we do for dinner tonight?<br />It was such a small, a very small and humble happiness.<br /><br />Though you have died, you live submerged in my heart,(3)<br />I could love someone else, but there is no one but you.<br />No matter how many seasons I struggle through,<br />I'm afraid of letting go, of letting it disappear.<br /><br />I gaze at violets.<br />What a pretty flower,<br />But I know that one day it will wilt.<br /><br />It is evening,<br />If I touch the crimson waters,(4)<br />There remains the two of us on the liquid's surface.<br />Shadows heap on top of each other,<br />I'm afraid of being alone(6)<br />Realizing it too late,<br />There is only one person on the liquid's surface.<br /><br />The seed planted in my heart on that day,<br />Buds sprouted twenty days after,<br />In appearance and form it is different,<br />But my love is unchanged,<br />That gentle light.</p>"

I've got the ""Remote procedure call (RPC) service terminated unexpectedly"" virus/worm that's going around, and everything people are telling me to do isn't working. (see my comments) I can't get into regedit, I can't hit control-alt-delete and find the thing from there. I can't do anything. I can't even open msconfig. The patch download page keeps crashing on me too. It's fucking pathetic. And I've still got that ""Worm/Randon"" thing going on too.

Please help me, I'm almost in tears because I'm so furious"

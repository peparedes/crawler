what a great way to be welcomed back into the country: being swarmed by around a half dozen girls before even stepping out of my car

meeting last night was...interesting.&nbsp; its nice that things are starting to run more smoothly and everyone is making an effort to get along, but some things die hard.&nbsp; oh well, we'll see how it all works out.&nbsp; most of the problems discussed last night were more for troupe than drama.

a new year is beginning, time to saddle up"

"event","OH SHIT!  Better batton down the hatches and hide your women folk, Ryan is back in the United States.  Granted, I'm sitting here in Newark for the next two hours, but damn, it feels good to <strike>be a gansta</strike> hear english again.

Operation: <strike>Keep Annie Mosher in the Dark</strike> Hammer of Light failed just in time for the suprise not to be a suprise, due to Annie's craftiness, but I'm suprised it worked as long as it did.  onwards and upwards, i say, time for more plotting and scheming of a not-enitrely evil nature.

Paris was...different.  thats all i can say.  i think i've been to so many cities i'm jaded to the whole traveling thing.  its a different city, with its own perks, its own pitfalls (x-ref: lack of pooper scooper laws and keyboards specifically designed to fuck over americans), its own sights, and its own sounds.  the sights did look a tad familiar though, st. petersburg being modelled after it and everything (that and washington tends to employ some of its architecture).  rather odd though, it all looks very home-ish.  my brother and i were thrown the first few days by the fact that everything seemed sort of familiar, and the people looked like they were from here, but we'd pass them in the street and they'd be speaking their crazy moon-language.  that would snap us back to reality and we'd realize we weren't in kansas anymore (and we havent ever been to kansas, either)

total expenses paid by ryan in paris: $0.  i like this game of conserving money.

in all honesty, i would rather have been home sooner than i was, or will be, at any rate.  i've missed so much, i'm still missing a lot.  things are going to be pretty disorienting in the next week.

see you all soon"

TO THE VIRGINS, TO MAKE MUCH OF TIME.
by Robert Herrick


GATHER ye rosebuds while ye may, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; Old time is still a-flying : 
And this same flower that smiles to-day 
&nbsp; &nbsp; To-morrow will be dying.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; The higher he's a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; And nearer he's to setting.

That age is best which is the first, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; When youth and blood are warmer ; 
But being spent, the worse, and worst 
&nbsp; &nbsp; Times still succeed the former.

Then be not coy, but use your time, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; And while ye may go marry : 
For having lost but once your prime 
&nbsp; &nbsp; You may for ever tarry.

<strike>speaking of productions:
my family has tickets to see peter pan at wof trap this sat (row a, orchestra == front seats)
we also just realized there is a schedule conflict and have bought tickets for the following night
this means that there are 3 front row peter pan tickets for sale for sat night if anyone wants them.
first come first served, and my dad has also put them up for grabs at work.
cost is $65 each.</strike>

"event","so, back from new york.

nothing terribly special happened, so here's a quick run through:

-saw lennon
-sat not five seats away from yoko ono
-experienced the diversity that is nyc (ate a mexican quesadilla at an italian restorant at the southside docks, with 80s madonna hits playing over the speakers)
-wandered the city
-learned some stuff about nyu
-saw forbidden broadway
-got to see my dad's cousin (we've always been close) and his fiancee

so we get back to union station, load up the car (my car, by the way, more on that later), and try to start it.&nbsp; it wakes the whir-ing sound, but doesnt roll over.&nbsp; well shit.&nbsp; try again.&nbsp; nope.&nbsp; nothing.&nbsp; usually this happens if its cold out, but seeing as it has been baking in the sun for 3 days, its unexplainable.&nbsp; so after 30 minutes of fiddling, we decide to call AAA.&nbsp; as soon as my mom dials the number, the engine starts.&nbsp; well, sort of.&nbsp; it gives a jump, makes like its about to start, then doesnt.&nbsp; so we wait five minutes and try it again.&nbsp; finally beat the car into submission.&nbsp; then came the fun of driving it home. it ran a little funnily, even i could tell and i wasn't driving.&nbsp;  constantly worried that it was about to die.&nbsp; but, we made it to the exxon okay.

anyways, after some deliberation, my dad and i have come to the agreement that i dont really need a new car.&nbsp; the explorer is already paid for and can haul lots and lots of wood (and people).&nbsp; so, the explorer is now mine officially.&nbsp; it shall be cleansed of whatever crap my parents used to keep in there and will now store a sweet 125 pc tool kit i got for 60 bucks (12 volt drill though is a little weak).&nbsp; in the middle of making it home today, i realised that i hadn't named it.&nbsp; now, any good pirate, or sailor for that matter, knows that sailing on an unnamed ship is bad luck.&nbsp; at first i thought andrea doria, but that didnt have the ring to it i wanted, nor the sort of irony i was looking for.&nbsp; so, i stuck to the most familiar, warm sounding, and funny (not funny sounding, just naming it such makes me laugh) name i could.&nbsp; so i channeled the spirit of my old car into the new one, and she is now named Mary Celeste II.&nbsp; shes much bigger than the old sunbird-class clipper (as stated, shes an explorer-class galleon), and will likely do better should she ever go through a fight similar to the one that ended Mary Celeste I.

landlubbas beware!&nbsp; the dread pirate captain ryan roves the high seas again with a larger ship fer takin' yer booty."

Beneath the roof there is a bed;
But not yet weary are our feet,
Still round the corner we may meet
A sudden tree or standing stone
That none have seen but we alone.

&nbsp;  Let them pass!&nbsp; Let them pass!
&nbsp;  Hill and water under sky,
&nbsp;  Pass them by!&nbsp; Pass them by!

A new road or a secret gate,

Tomorrow we may come this way
And take the hidden paths that run
Towards the Moon or to the Sun.

"event","so this storm just popped up, and im happy to see it.&nbsp; i hope it actually does somethign (hopefully not destroy the tree right outside my window, though, that would be sad, becasue then ryan would have no more bedroom)

forrest gump is actually a really good movie.&nbsp; i saw it when i was little, didnt get any of it, was really bored except for the vietnam parts, and so didnt like it too much.&nbsp; but we watched it again in hum today, and i realize now that it is a very well done movie.

rory, matt, and sam came over today again to work on russian project.&nbsp; rachel lazarus came with us too.&nbsp; we had five guys.&nbsp; then worked a little on the project.&nbsp; then katie and amanda dropped by, left about the same time matt and rachel did, and sam, rory, and i continued to work on the project (i still need to finish my part of it).&nbsp; we wound up talkign about a lot of things that just made us a little depressed and then everyone went home.

if this storm breaks i will be much happier.&nbsp; i think i'm goign to go sit outside"

"event","actual update now that im not studying physics

was in bed at 11 last night, didnt fall asleep until 2:30, and only then after popping a nice tylenol sinus nighttime (the only one i could find that would knowck me out, in theory at least)

woke up at 6:30 because i forgot to reset my alarm for 7 (which is what it is when i drive to school)

reset alarm to be 7.&nbsp; as soon as my head hits my pillow, my dad comes in and says theres a horrible accident on telegraph and the beltway (read: right by our house) and that every route between here and tj will be clogged.&nbsp; therefore, i should get up right then and leave for school immediately.

precalc was a test that i thought was much easier than expected, but it cuold be the sleep dep talking.

then after school was physics study party with lizbeth.&nbsp; cry.&nbsp; i want there to be a party this week.&nbsp; none of my classes have one, and i cant go to the ones after school because of other things to do."

5 things i do to relax

2)&nbsp; play games
3)&nbsp; listen to music, eyes closed on my floor
4)&nbsp; punch something repeatedly (yes, it does calm me down sometimes)
5)&nbsp; i dont know, i'm pretty relaxed as it is.&nbsp; its hard thinking about what i do because i never in my mind go ""oh shit, i so need to relax right now, what should i do?""&nbsp; it just never comes up i suppose

"event","hmmm, the landlubbas have disappeared from my buddy list (i have never seen one entire group be empty before.&nbsp; and for those who dont know, my buddy list is seperated into pirates and landlubbas.&nbsp; however, i cannot for the life of me figure out how i organize it.&nbsp; the method i do it by must be super top secret)

anyways, in other news:

yesterday was party at jeff's.&nbsp; much karaoke, tried a sinatra song that i dont know the words for, failed, but thats okay, its the only song i wanted to sing.&nbsp; lots of frisbee throwing, lots of gravel, lots of food.&nbsp; my yellow sunglasses broke (theyre made of plastic). i'll fix them before the weekend is through.

time trials today.&nbsp; i hate time trials.&nbsp; so fucking long.&nbsp; and you have to swim everything.&nbsp; got to see a bunch of people i havent in about a year.&nbsp; its funny, a kid on the team goes to tj, and we're great friends during the season, but dont talk to each other at school.&nbsp; and my other friend daniel is the same way, except he goes to edison.&nbsp; but its so weird to jsut pick up like that season after season.

then rory, sam, and matt mahony came over and we worked on our russian project (and also played halo 2 while matt went home to get something).&nbsp; then matt had to leave and the rest of us saw mr and mrs smith.&nbsp; we can only describe it as: ridiculous.&nbsp; then we came home, saw the end of mortal combat annihilation on spike, and played some more halo.&nbsp; merciful hell, swords are fun.&nbsp; as are rockets.

gods below, my back is burned.&nbsp; oh well, live and learn, and then get melanoma.

update: ah, two landlubbas on.&nbsp; that and i decided to give some meanign to having two groups.&nbsp; now im off to sleep.&nbsp; precalc studying tomorrow.&nbsp; fun"

"event","general warning:

if oyu do not like pulling a few g's in a car, especially a big suv, don't ride with me.&nbsp; while i may stay within 10 mph over the speed limit, i will take turns at close to 25 mph (realize this is an suv known for rollovers), and speed bumps at whatever speed i feel like.&nbsp; i know the limits of my car, i know what it can take and what is too much, and i will push it to the edge of most people's comfort zone.

that being said, i totally was not expecting it to do that.&nbsp; but it was fun anyways.

"event","today was rather interesting, if hectic

woke up 30 minutes late, which is good since traffic is much better at about thirty minutes after when i usually leave and i arrive at teh same time anyways.&nbsp; that actually makes me a little sad that that happens

got pulled out of first period to set up sound for topics in glabalization thingie.&nbsp; that was a pain.&nbsp; they wanted two wireless as well as the podium.&nbsp; the wall was closed in the auditorium so i couldnt set up sound and test levels at the same time or even quickly at all.

found out from chris later that they pulled him out of third becasue all of a sudden the mics stopped working.&nbsp; the problem: a russian.&nbsp; he found eugene in booth.&nbsp; eugene didnt know there was still something happening in the auditorium so he muted the mics

found out about halfway through the day that the precalc collaborative was today.&nbsp; me and wes did fine on that.&nbsp; we've taken so many collaboratives together we work really well.

school ended and i ran home so that i could do somethings before my recital.&nbsp; is it just me or does everyone turn into ball-less fucks who cant drive whenever youre in a hurry.

recital went fine, amde more mistakes than i'm used to, but i caught them.

came home, i think i might start another story tonight.&nbsp; i feel...inspired."

"event","im hoping this storm will break over top of me.

i dont want to leave this message indirectly, but when you get to it, i'm sorry teara.&nbsp; we'll talk later (not as serious as it sounds, it's just i've been meaning to say it)

im feeling restless again.&nbsp; i drive and suddenly dont feel like hitting the brakes, and instead just accelerating until something stops me.&nbsp; i feel like i can let go of everything.&nbsp; i want to burn bridges and leave all of you behind.

i realized today, i'm not afraid of death.&nbsp; instead, i'm worried that i wont have a say in it.&nbsp; i step out into the road with cars rushing by, not because i want to seem all tough or cool, its because i don't care.&nbsp; i step out there not to prove anything, i do it because i believe i am in firm control of my fate.&nbsp; i can stare at a car rushing towards me, entirely capable of sending me to the next world without fear that it will actually happen.&nbsp; i've known for a long time how i will die.&nbsp; i will die because i will do something stupid, and i will die fighting, i will be on plan b, the last resort, and fight till they kill me.&nbsp; that's what i'm most afraid of about death, not fighting till the end.&nbsp; i refuse to go quietly and without taking something or someone with me.&nbsp; but i can accept my death.&nbsp; i can do these things that could very well kill me and not be afraid because i don't plan on dying that day.&nbsp; not yet.&nbsp; so dont be scared for me, i still plan on living for a while.

on a lighter note, pirate day should be announced next time.&nbsp; maybe flyers?

not as down right now, becasue car rocks my sox, as well as magical trevor.

i think i'm going to go writing"

"event","nearly passed out today in every class and also while sitting at stoplights.&nbsp; maybe i shouldnt be driving.&nbsp; oh well, i made it everywhere alright.&nbsp; so sleepy: talked to my brother, who just got back from texas, about pretty much everything until 3 in the morning.&nbsp; it got rather interesting becasue by that point he was a little inebriated.

so a funny thing happened today during lunch.&nbsp; matt and i were throwing around a frisbee down a stretch of hallway.&nbsp; i do a toss and it gains some more altitude than i intended, bumping the ceiling.&nbsp; now, the exact moment it touched the ceiling (a blank tile by the way), the power went out.&nbsp; now, before you say anything, i can firmly state that we did not do it.&nbsp; you see, blank tiles have nothing on them, and tapping one with a frisbee wont make it jump the 6 inches into the air it would actually need to hit anything vaguely important.&nbsp; besides, there is no way in hell that a vital system, something connected in series with the rest of the school's power, would a) be that sensitive and b) exist.&nbsp; so all you people blaming us, fuck off.&nbsp; the school is actually just that crappy.&nbsp; aparantly, a tree fell on a transformer the other day, and the one they gave us is shit.

oh, and honestly, kidding me about stuff you know pisses me off (a good hint that im annoyed is when i say fuck off and walk away never to return becasue everyone is being an ass), like how i hurt my finger, or that my hair is indeed blue(ish), just pisses me off even more.&nbsp; i dont care if you do it lovingly.&nbsp; im tired of it.&nbsp; my patience with everyone is dwindling, and as some of you have realized, im snapping at people more and more often.&nbsp; so please, dont aggravate me.&nbsp; (psst, hey, this means dont go around lovingly joking tomorrow saying that i caused the power to go out.&nbsp; i might just sandblast the curb with your teeth.&nbsp; i let you know what happened because i thought it was a hell of a coincidence.&nbsp; i put in the defending statements, not to try and cover my ass, mearly to show how you would have to be a moron to seriously think we caused the power outage)."

as if there were any doubts

anyways, ive figured out that once rory gets his island, i get my palace on said island, i rent out said palace to gypsies, i get my boat (the reason i rent said palace on said island to said gypsies), i use a time machine to go back in time on said boat, hire actual ninjas for crew of said boat, then return to own time with said ninja-pirates to plunder the high seas, i will get a black labrador, and name said dog ""scurvy""

i've also decided i want a hammock in my room.&nbsp; i dont know where it would go, but i think it would be funny"

"event","so, this room gets repressively hot (and yes, i do mean repressive and not oppressive.&nbsp; i think its funnier that way.&nbsp; LET MY PEOPLE GO!) especially with a comp turned on.&nbsp; i really should install that new heatsink&nbsp; so i dont have to have a ginormous fan of air-blowing pointed straight at the cpu.

in other news:
i got my car back.&nbsp; it runs much more nicely now.&nbsp; pedals were readjusted too, so no more give in braking and accelerating.

time to go to that thing and see if i can get a job over the summer."

DAYS<br />I work most evenings lately, so my days lay blank and empty before me while dave is away at school or work.&nbsp; He's a baking machine and it seems I hardly ever see him.<br /><br />1.1 Sewing<br />to fill the empty space and pour creativity somewhere i've been sewing.&nbsp; projects so far:<br />- giant squid reconstructed black t-shirt<br />- puffy sleeved brown surf shirt<br />- ""some kind of monster"" metallica t-shirt made into a stylish and elegant black 3/4 sleeve shirt<br />- re-size of dave's thermal army shirt<br />- re-sleeve of another army shirt<br />- kimono-style top from grey ""death before disco"" sweatshirt<br />- brown ""farmers do it in the fields"" reconstruction<br />and the crowning glory:<br />tiny brown leather mocassins for my baby nephew colton.&nbsp; i have plans for another pair in a larger size when his little feet grow and actually need shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />1.2 Internet<br />i've also been spending a lot of time using the internet.&nbsp; sometimes feels like wasted time, but then i can always convince myself i need to look something up before actually *doing* something.&nbsp; like this:<br /><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/t_shirt_surgery"">www.livejournal.com/community/t_shirt_surgery</a>&nbsp; or this<br /><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/t_shirt_bitchery"">www.livejournal.com/community/t_shirt_bitchery</a>&nbsp; or this<br /><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/clothes_surgery"">www.livejournal.com/community/clothes_surgery</a>&nbsp; or this<br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/tamikolicious"">www.myspace.com/tamikolicious</a>&nbsp;or even this&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/toomanytamikos"">www.livejournal.com/users/toomanytamikos</a>&nbsp; (obviously) and in my nostalgia i even look at this one<br /><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/victoria_bc"">www.livejournal.com/community/victoria_bc</a>&nbsp; just because i miss it<br /><br />1.3 Music<br />I haven't been spending any time practicing, studying, or performing any music.&nbsp; the sewing has taken over my thoughts.&nbsp; however, i will be going to see songs:ohia in 2 weeks in edmonton, and bonnie prince billy in vancouver in november.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />1.4 Weather<br />Weather doesn't *do* it for me...&nbsp; but the cold has finally broken and it's sunny beautiful crisp fall, as it should be.&nbsp; one thing to be said for edmonton (and alberta in general) weather - you definitely get the full spectrum of seasons.&nbsp; no half-assed seasons for us albertans.&nbsp; we go whole hog.&nbsp; summer is summer and winter is WINTER.&nbsp; hat season, here i come, when it's hat time of day all day every day.<br /><br />1.5 Cooking/Domestic<br />Somehow i can't bring myself to do anything domestic.&nbsp; but perhaps it's just because i'm getting over a cold.&nbsp; today, however, i'm getting better.&nbsp; plans to cook oyaku donburi tonight for dave.&nbsp; he thinks i'm amazing when i&nbsp;cook japanese food.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />1.6 Post<br />I've been meaning to mail a package to manusha, but it just ain't happening yet, and she sent me a lovely little card yesterday.&nbsp; guilt setting in, but post office so far away...&nbsp; don't worry manusha!&nbsp; i won't forget!!&nbsp;<br /><br />1.7 Baby<br />Colton!!&nbsp; we went down to red deer (area) for the baby shower on the weekend.&nbsp; my first ""shower"" experience, and it's strange.&nbsp; everyone gathers round on sofas and chairs and chit-chats leading up to the big event... the person in the spotlight opens gifts everyone's brought.&nbsp; and then the people go home.&nbsp; but we stayed longer and hung out with eldon and sue and baby for the evening.&nbsp; one could just sit and look at him, watch his frantic little arm and leg movements and his quivery chin all day.&nbsp; i can understand how the floor could remain unswept, dishes in the sink, when one has a new baby.&nbsp; it's all so exciting, so all-encompassing.&nbsp; like you could fall down deep into the peace of his eyes and begin to see things the way he does, with the wonder of first sight.&nbsp; </p>"

living in alberta and experiencing autumn for the first time in years, in september, no less, is an interesting event.&nbsp; at first i was angry because it was damn cold and raining and i didn't want summer to be over (""this is what winter is like in victoria!!"") but now&nbsp;i think i'm ready for it.&nbsp; smelling that crisp earthy smell tinged with woodsmoke is bringing me back to places i didn't realize i had left.&nbsp; smell of meat cooking in the oven while our feet get cold on the hardwood floor and the furnace clunks into motion with its dusty summer smell.&nbsp; something about the quality of light between rare bursts of sunlight through the blinds on my sewing table.&nbsp; i like it.&nbsp; and at least in alberta i'll be able to wear all those garments that were too warm for victorian winters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

since i've been working strange hours lately, hours that don't match up with dave's hours, and i'm home alone a lot.&nbsp; i've started to sew like a madwoman.&nbsp; just about a new garment each day.&nbsp; yesterday i made little moccasins for colton and they're SO CUTE.&nbsp; if my digital camera was working i'd take a picture to show y'all, i'm that proud of them.&nbsp; i'm actually thinking of maybe selling some of my things online... ebay?&nbsp; i'm not really sure if i should do that or just have a different website for it...&nbsp; i made a rad shirt the other day that had a giant squid all across it.&nbsp;&nbsp;yayaya sewing!&nbsp; i'm all into this DIY business... t-shirt surgery.&nbsp; i'm a t-shirt surgeon."

"event","sooooo... i thought i'd post again just to tell y'all about my trip to sanfran.&nbsp;&nbsp;

it sure is a big city.&nbsp; i just couldn't help but think it, even as something inside of me rebelled against that country bumpkin idea.&nbsp; but what the heck, i've been in forestburg for most of the summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

i got in on friday afternoon, and jill's flight was supposed to get in like 10 minutes before mine but it was delayed like 2 hours.&nbsp; so alaina and i just hung around the airport drinking coffee and eating scones.&nbsp; when we were all together laines drove us out to walnut creek where she lives.&nbsp; it's amazing the difference between walnut creek and the city in temperatures.&nbsp; we'd be sweating out in walnut creek, but we'd have to bring sweaters into san francisco.

that night we went to the ben harper concert at the greek theatre in berkeley, which is a far out venue (i just incorporated that adjective into my vocabulary, just now!&nbsp; groovy, hey?)&nbsp; and because it was so warm in the california sun, all the stone steps that acted as seats were still toasty in the dark.&nbsp; damian marley opened the show with his cool reggae and RAD dancers.&nbsp; maybe when i grow up i can be a reggae dancer too.&nbsp; then ben harper came on and was cool and had two sweet guests in the show: Radio, from spearhead, who did some excellent beatboxing, and FREAKING CARLOS SANTANA!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;when he said that name everybody was suddenly standing up and cheering.&nbsp; very cool.

SATURDAY&nbsp;we went into san francisco for a little bit of shopping.&nbsp; while we were walking downtown we were interrupted by this zombie parade.&nbsp; all these people (zombies?) stumbling along the sidewalk moaning and clutching and doing their zombie thing, bloody and torn, and every once in a while they'd get another one.&nbsp; like zombies.&nbsp; then the veteran zombies would get the ""blood"" all over that person, and they'd become part of the zombie parade.&nbsp; then at the very end there was a man carrying a sign that said ""god hates zombies"".&nbsp;&nbsp;
that night was the party bus.&nbsp;for those who don't know, a party bus is like your own personal pub crawl: a bus you hire for the night and fill with a bunch of your friends to go out to different clubs.&nbsp; i had some major reservations about the party bus (you know me and dance clubs) but it was actually really fun.&nbsp; we had some drinks and danced the night away.&nbsp; the first bar we went to was this one that had 3 floors, one of them being sort of a retro floor, so all these dudes were dressed up in their retro party duds.&nbsp; quite fun.&nbsp; we just went around dancing with random guys and getting pictures with them.&nbsp; jill danced with this one guy in a one-piece ski suit and goggles... she liked his ski pants.

we ended up sleeping on couches at alaina's friend's house, then driving back to walnut creek at noon on SUNDAY.&nbsp; later we went into san fran and took a ferry to sausalito, the island that the golden gate bridge goes to.&nbsp; walked around there in the tourist shops, then called it a night &nbsp;(i think.&nbsp; i can't really remember if we did anything else).

MONDAY alaina had to work (7pm-7am) so we drove down to Haight-Ashbury to see the hippie section of sanfran and buy some tie dye for dave and baby.&nbsp; alaina went home and jill and i continued to tourist around, hoping to go to alcatraz, but sadly too late for tickets.&nbsp; we ended up just riding the cable car around and doing other tourist things.&nbsp; we took the bart (bay area rapid transit) back to alaina's, ate greasy food, and went to bed.&nbsp;

in the morning we all slept in very late and had to haul our butts in order to make it to the ""monet in normandy"" exhibit that was happening.&nbsp; it was jill's birthday so we went out for dinner to a fancy tapas place, and then to the top of the mark.&nbsp; it's like this swanky cocktail bar on the top floor of the mark hopkins hotel, which is on the top of a crazy san francisco hill.&nbsp; when you're up there you have this amazing view of the whole city, all twinkling lights and fog.&nbsp; it was quite pretty and there was a cool jazz pianist working there that night.&nbsp; as we were walking back down the hill to the car, all three of us in heels, we had to hold hands.&nbsp; the road was so steep that there were ruts cut into the sidewalk for traction.&nbsp; it was steeper than the steepest part of that caddy bay road.&nbsp; *crazy*

then the next day i flew home.&nbsp; there you go - my sanfrancisco treat... ding ding!"

"event","last october my roommate from first year, Margaret, died of ovarian cancer.&nbsp; i've been looking at her <a href=""http://www.caringbridge.org/canada/margaret"">website</a>&nbsp;and her friend karin's and it's sort of making me feel... petty.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />something about the vivacity in the entries these girls write/wrote is simply so amazing.&nbsp; it's a life i can't even begin to identify with, and it makes me feel like all my lazy procrastinated and mediocre days aren't really the best use of my time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />i just got back from san francisco yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; before i left edmonton last week i was having a bit of a fit about my finances, and about how it felt like i had wasted my whole summer, since i didn't work and i keep having to borrow money from my parents.&nbsp; but then as i got off the plane in san francisco, i realized that i really have had a rich summer.&nbsp; i just didn't make any money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />- i went to italy and boston<br />- i MOVED<br />- i spent a month out on the farm<br />- i went to san francisco<br /><br />my summer was like a four month-long holiday... and all i can do is complain.&nbsp; granted, it is a bit stressful not having any money and being in debt and starting over in a new province from nothing.&nbsp; i keep getting these feelings like i should have just scrapped the whole 6-year university degree and opted for a two-year diploma that shoots me right out into the work force.&nbsp; it's hard not to think like that.&nbsp; but now, for what it's worth, i'm going to enjoy thinking about all the magnificent rolls of film i have yet to develop, all those images of sights i have seen.&nbsp; they can be my production from the summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />oh, AND i rode the party bus."

"event","update time!

what's new with you?&nbsp; wanna know what's new with me?&nbsp; here it is:&nbsp; (the list is my favourite sort of writing)

- dave and i found a place to live.&nbsp; we painted it and moved our things in, but now we have to actually move ourselves in.&nbsp; this is tricky because we need a vehicle that can stay in The City with us, or at least a person who is willing to give us a ride to edmonton.&nbsp; it's harder than you'd think.&nbsp; farm life is awful busy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- we need to buy a car now, as well as decide which type of phone service to get.&nbsp; anybody have any advice?&nbsp; we're musing on telus (blah), shaw digital phone, or some kind of cellphone family plan or mike plan.&nbsp; but being out here on the farm is quite difficult for finding things out about anything.&nbsp; slow dial up in the country.

- it's been stormy and blustery here, it feels like a harbinger of autumn

- i'm not sure if i used harbinger in the right sense there

- my parents are coming for a visit in a week or so

- i am once again jobless.&nbsp; i was working for a short while for a 75 year old lady in town (forestburg) who is recovering slowly from a hip operation.&nbsp; she paid me $15 an hour to do things like fold the laundry, clean the kitchen, paint a fence, decorate a rocking chair, take her grocery shopping, and hang out with her.&nbsp; it was sweet, but it's over now.&nbsp; apparently she doesn't need me anymore.&nbsp; sad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- today i went to the dump today with dave, and then into forestburg.&nbsp; it was such an exciting outing that i began to feel strange about living out here in the country.&nbsp; maybe it was something in the air or maybe it was the dream i had last night, but i started to feel depressed about the rough quality of life out here.&nbsp; it's hard to explain, but i feel sort of like... you can never fully get clean in this terrible little shower we have in the kitchen.&nbsp; the bathtub has a layer of something that won't come off and a growing rust stain in the bottom.&nbsp; you could clean this house forever and never feel like it was really clean, there are only different stages of dirtiness.&nbsp; i don't wear makeup ever anymore, and i'm starting again to disregard bras.&nbsp; sometimes i don't even comb my hair.&nbsp; there's dirt and dust everywhere.&nbsp; we've started eating margarine.&nbsp; cars can never get clean because to leave or get to the farm they have to travel 3 miles of dirt road.&nbsp; anytime you go outside you run the risk of getting smeary giant nose prints all over your clothes from gus and lucy (dogs).&nbsp; there's something depressing that the late summer wind brings, that isn't here in the peak of summer, that almost lets you forget that you live 5 miles from forestburg and 50 miles from anywhere else.&nbsp; maybe it feels like i could grow old and unattractive in a place like this and live for years and years without even realizing it, without noticing that nobody ever looked at me anymore and that i had become caught up in all the small town awfulness just as much as the women i can't stand.&nbsp; i could become deb wiltse and long for balogna sandwiches made with mustard and processed cheese on white wonderbread with the crusts cut off.&nbsp; cheez whiz.&nbsp; wine coolers.&nbsp; a glimmer of hope though, in the form of our solace in the city, our little house where we'll live with our cats and our nice neighbours, where we'll drink mineral water and strong coffee;&nbsp; tea in the evenings and butter instead of margarine.&nbsp; extravirgin olive oil and ethiopian cuisine.&nbsp; homemade bread and soup and cheese.&nbsp; shirts that i have made out of other shirts and shoes with sequins on them.&nbsp; i need all these things to feel sane in the wintertime.&nbsp; and i need my own kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- we'll be leaving the farm soon.&nbsp; i'm beginning to get a bit loopy.&nbsp;"

saturday: finished p &amp; p, shopping with jenn for 50's era dress.&nbsp; found a very stewardess-ish jacket and dress combo (that i didn't even end up wearing) from overbearing british fashionista who convinced me to buy ""control top"" pantyhose.&nbsp; also purchased liquid liner from MAC - my first extravagant cosmetics buy.&nbsp; played around with clarinet and flute with gill and reese.&nbsp; dinner at ferris' with good food and bad service crammed into a tiny booth in the dishwater-smelling ""atrium"".&nbsp; grad party - good times, lots of alcohol, and a 4am night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

sunday: 1pm morning (!) and breakfast (!) at the blue fox with gillian and reese.&nbsp; ""i sure like having them around"" says dave.&nbsp; good couple friends.&nbsp; it only happens when you can have friendships separately in all combinations - a rare joy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

they just left in hopes of getting the six pm ferry and dave and i will be drinking gatorade and watching movies tonight for we are both still feeling under the weather.&nbsp; probably the drinking and late night of the grad party last night was not the best thing for my chest cold, and not the best for my ""sick day"" excuse tomorrow at school, but it was a one-time opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

only 3 more weeks of school - yipee!

i only have 4 weeks left of school, and the last week i'm not supposed to really be ""teaching"" my english classes anything.&nbsp; go figure.&nbsp; since the kids are so notoriously bad at handing things in on time, i'm supposed to have everything due a week before i'm done, and then spend the last week chasing down the kids who haven't finished yet.&nbsp; SO... i only have 8 more english classes to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

this weekend i made a trip out to value village and bought two extra large t-shirts and made them into something cool.&nbsp; it's too bad i have to wear teacher clothes so much of the time.&nbsp; i want to show off my creations, but they're a bit too casual for school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

just watched memoirs of a geisha... nice to look at, but i just couldn't quite get into it.&nbsp; i felt that way with the book too.&nbsp; however, i did notice things about the location or the way the people behaved.&nbsp; there's this gesture that japanese people make to signal ""come here"":&nbsp; it's sort of like the way we wave goodbye to a baby, but with the whole hand moving up and down, hingeing at the wrist.&nbsp; like the way you might fan something.&nbsp; very strange, and not totally understandable at first.&nbsp; i remember being in japan and my dad's cousin waving at me like that.&nbsp; i was like ""you want me to go away? wha?&nbsp; come over there?""&nbsp; very confusing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

last week went by so fast, it was friday before i was ready for it.&nbsp; and now it's sunday night again.&nbsp; (sigh)

i just realized that my poetry unit is almost over and i didn't make it nearly as cool as i wanted to.&nbsp; it's sad, because the kids hated poetry before we started and they still hate it.&nbsp; what a failure.&nbsp; it's quite startling how different the students can be in terms of ability and work habits and everything.&nbsp; that's why public school is challenging - who do you teach to?&nbsp; the people who can get your jokes about politics and your puns, or the ones who need to you to tell them how many syllables are in the word ""stupid""?"

Avery Band at Logan's.&nbsp; Great show - and they've expanded Logan's so it's a heck of a lot nicer than it used to be.&nbsp; The dance floor is now bare cement though, which is hard on the knees after a while.&nbsp; They played the <a href=""http://www.cravery.com/?page=CR_Avery_News_Travels_Fast_ft_the_Be_Good_Tanyas.mp3&amp;videosection="">song</a> I'm listening to right now, and it was much better last night.&nbsp; It's like beer parlour gospel music and the whole bar is singing along in drunken harmonies somehow more free and real than sober ones.&nbsp; Like That Feel by Tom Waits on Bone Machine... how it gets so wonderfully lush at the end.&nbsp; and it's not tidy either.<br /><br />I've been searching around looking for music and i stumbled upon the Blind Boys of Alabama site and it's like opening a wound.&nbsp; I wanted <em>so badly</em> to see that show - and i just found out that they do a cover of a tom waits song.&nbsp; I have to content myself with an internet video of one of their shows.&nbsp; a bunch of seventy year old blind men singing gospel... *sigh*<br /><br />going camping today, so i'm trying to bone up (what the hell does that mean?) on what kinds of things one should take camping.&nbsp; very educational."

yesterday i took dave out on a date...&nbsp; we went to see my school's performance of Joseph and whatever whatever dreamcoat.&nbsp; it was really good, very exciting to see all the kids.&nbsp; the brothers were especially impressive - they got all funny and silly with it.&nbsp; strange to see these boys who don't talk at all in class really hamming it up there on stage and singing with great french and caribbean and cowboy&nbsp;accents.&nbsp; wonderful!

that's all.&nbsp; just cleaning and getting dirty today.&nbsp; windows open, smell of bleach and murphy's oil soap."

"event","Hi Friends...

Every weekend I find a few days too short, and it is no different this weekend, even though there was no school on Friday, and tomorrow I have a UVic seminar for the morning and don't have to go to the middle school until after lunch.&nbsp; Still, I'm dreading my Monday.&nbsp; Too soon, too soon.&nbsp; I'm especially thinking about one of my English classes with dread, which is terrible.&nbsp; But they're just so UNlively... it's like I'm a performer, tap-dancing my heart out on stage, and barely a clap from the audience.&nbsp; Most of them aren't even watching.&nbsp; I come to the big finish with jazz hands and chest heaving, and the people just sit there, looking blankly.&nbsp; And if I were a tap-dancer, I'd say they're killing me, and be able to look forward to the next performance in front of a better audience.&nbsp; Since I'm not a tap-dancer, but an English teacher and I have to face these inert Pubes 3 days a week, I'm going to need to come up with something good.&nbsp; Either that, or resign myself to the one-sided communication of Teacher&nbsp;to Students.&nbsp;

My weekend so far:
1. trip to vancouver: germs on the ferry, conference and sickness and ballet in the city
2. ferry back to victoria: inane chatter with new&nbsp;ferry&nbsp; ""friend""&nbsp;
3. delicious vietnamese food (it's so good sometimes i think about it even when i'm not hungry and then i get hungry)
4. hike on mt. doug up the best trail.&nbsp; amazing views, azure skies, icicles at the bottom, t-shirt at the top
5. new casserole dish from retro kitchen store
6. delicious pseudo-indian food and anna and settlers of catan.&nbsp;&nbsp;
7. this

i wish for once this semester i could get sick enough that i could miss a day of school without feeling guilty.&nbsp; so far, I've just been (amazingly) able to push on through my days at the middle school, merely infecting others in my path.&nbsp; but i could use a day of rest.&nbsp;"

<P>spring is so exciting here.&nbsp; well, i suppose it's exciting everywhere, but in victoria it seems to come all at once, and all the trees and daffodils and crocuses are blooming before you even realize.&nbsp; it's lovely.&nbsp; the sun is out making everything look its best and jim is in the back yard building a chicken run for our lone chicken.&nbsp; today when we came home winston was on top of the small chicken enclosure the chicken usually stays in, and when we came closer to see we realized that there were two little birds stuck in the foot-tall pen.&nbsp; winston was terrorizing them, and when we came over they started to freak out even more.&nbsp; it's weird that they were in there though, and the chicken was off somewhere else doing her thing.&nbsp; </P>"

<P><EM>I&nbsp; </EM>realize that the way i handled the situation in my class on friday was not the best.&nbsp; I have to live with that and get past it and deal with any ramifications with those students on Tuesday when&nbsp;I face them all over again.&nbsp; I also realize that there are better, more ideal situations in which i could have nurtured that student's independence and free thinking as an individual.&nbsp; however, along with all those other important qualities that schools are supposed to be teaching, they also need to instill some kind of respect.&nbsp; the boy in my class quite simply did not want to be in the class any more when he could be out wandering the halls.&nbsp; when i refused to let him do that it created a power struggle and his reaction was created so that he would not lose face in front of his peers.&nbsp; it was disrespectful, and i believe it was just&nbsp;him ""testing"" the student teacher, since my sponsor was out of the room at the time.&nbsp; quite possibly i failed.&nbsp; </P>
<P>in addition, it is damn hard to be in that school and even just do what i can to follow the norm.&nbsp; it's much harder than it is to just talk about the way education <EM>should </EM>be.&nbsp; </P>"

<P>today in school a boy swore in my class.&nbsp; he told me he was ""sick"" and he needed to go get his ""medicine"" in the middle of class.&nbsp; i told him he could wait to the end.&nbsp; he said something like ""i'm just going to go then"" and i was like ""No- you're going to stay here until the end of class""&nbsp;&nbsp;and he said ""well this fuckin' sucks"" and slumped back down in his chair.&nbsp; it was a bit of a confrontation, and i guess i sort of made it into a power struggle.&nbsp; then when my sponsor found out (he had been out of the room at the time) he stormed out to find the twerpy perp, and sent him to detention hall.&nbsp; i have mixed feelings about this.&nbsp; but now i sort of know what to do for next time.&nbsp; </P>

"event","<P>News, in brief:</P>
<P>1) i start my english unit next week (as in a few days from now).&nbsp; i'm nervous and excited and frightened, but i know that my english sponsor is cool and funny and will support me and help me.&nbsp; which is more than i can say for my music sponsor...</P>
<P>2) each day i grow more dissatisfied and disheartened with the way our working relationship goes.&nbsp; and aside from his disorganization (which is turning out to be a major problem) i feel like the source of this badness is that he actually doesn't want to have a student teacher, and someone pulled strings for me to be at this school and had to twist his arm to do it.&nbsp; very discouraging.&nbsp; especially since the edmonton school district will be at the job fair on Feb 8th for interviews and they'll need to look at my evaluations, on which he only writes things that need improvement.&nbsp; all these people will find out from the evaluations is what i can't do (which is a hell of a lot).&nbsp; something inside my chest is sinking.</P>
<P>3) david's sister is pregnant, which is SO EXCITING!&nbsp; i guess she's had scary complications in the past with pregnancies, but she's in her 2nd month, so it feels safer now.&nbsp; AND she's due in august, which means that dave and i will be living in alberta when the baby comes!&nbsp; i guess dave sort of feels one-upped because his little sister is having a baby before he is, but she also finished university before he did.&nbsp; and her boyfriend bought a cool old tractor.&nbsp; so they have a tractor, and a house before he does.&nbsp; there's no way we can catch up... i guess we just have to be happy for them.&nbsp; and i'm not budging on my timeline.</P>
<P>4) winston and pants are on the bed, grooming each other.&nbsp; they have a progression.&nbsp; sleeping separately - sleeping closer together - winston makes the purring asking sound - winston moves over to pants and starts licking his paws - pants begins licking winston's head - winston stops licking pants - pants starts biting winston - a fight ensues.</P>"

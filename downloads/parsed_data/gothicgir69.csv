THERE IS LIFE ON THIS PLANET...... everytime i talk to him i hear this wonderful VERITY.... (mr. webster gave me that word!!!!) the sincerity in his voice tells me he is tellin me the truth in everything that he says to me.... its so sweet.... one day we are at each others throats wanting to practically stab each other  (hypothetically (BIG WORD) speaking) and the next we are dating.... how ironic (BIG WORD) is that......... well i gotta go... i want to annoy the person who is on Joey's sn and then get off and call max.... hehehe

Words of the Day: 1. Verity: truth; true statement; really existing thing
2. Zombie: dead person said to be brought to life by witchcraft

BY MYSELF....... but anywho..... missing max and wishing he was here with me....... i hope i get to see him tomorrow...... and we can have fun.... OH GUESS WHAT??? dont tell max... but i had this really good idea....... earlier... i cant say because i know he reads these... but it is good..... i know when July 13,2005 comes along and we are still together i will tell u.... plus he will be surprised........ its fun really it is.... it gives me a chance to tell him the feelings i feel everyday..... in a little note........ hehehe... i am not goin to say anymore....... because he will know what it is...... and i dont want that i want it to be a surprise..... anywho.... i have had so much goin on lately..... Zach gave me an invitation last nite to ""fuck"" him.... and i didnt do it at all.... That is good... i am learning to control myself..... which is good... and as i sit here i miss max even more..... he went out somewhere with his dad and sis and one of his dad's ex's to dinner...... OH JOY!!!!!!!! not really......... but anyway...... guess what i have the two poems i said i would post in the next few days... here they are....

Let you go

I hesitate to tell you
what's on my mind
I can't hesitate anymore
i must speak my mind
For years I have loved you
this you know
You know that I'd give up everything
for you in a heartbeat
But dispite our countless hours
on the phone
And our endless conversations
about love and marriage
I must tell you
my heart is with you
It probably always will
be with you
But I can't take it anymore
the pain, the suffering,
The anger, the depression
the emptiness, and the worthlessness
I love you
but I can't do this anymore
Your heart belongs to someone else
and I can't compete with that
I don't intend to try
what's the point?
Your ont going to wind up
picking me
As much as this hurts me
i let you go
Your free from me
love who you choose
Love me but only as your friend
which is all that I want
This is goodbye
i've let you go

and the other one.... BTW... this is not based on personal experience like all my other poems but it is still as good as the others....

Unfound Letter

I sit her in my room
and clean
As I clean
I find a letter
I sit her and read the letter
as tears stream down my face
its a love letter from you
the man I once loved
bearing all your feelings 
and laying your cards 
on the table
This letter dates back to 2002
I can't believe my eyes
as I read this beautiful confession
I sit alone in my room and cry
after reading this wonderful letter
why didn't I find it sooner
I am set to marry another man
in less than a month
For I had thought
you had forgotten about me
So I moved on
and now this....
I call you
to tell you I found your letter
You respond with ""You did""
and ""it took you this long?""
You tell me that your still available
I tell you ""I'm getting married""
I hear your voice crak
I know your crying
I told you I didn't know 
anything about this letter
until now
I thought you had forgotten
about me
So i decided to move on
I hear you cry
I tell you i have found someone else
you cry more
It hurts me to make you cry
I tell you I will always love you
I tell you my sinful confessions
You know now
the truth
I moved on
because of an 
Unfound Letter


I hope you liked my poems.... Comment if u like on them....

Word of the Day: Macabre: Horrible; Death-like

Bye guys..... 

I love you max!!!!!! *kiss*kiss*"

Death is Better than....

Verse 1

I feel empty
like a blackhole has consumed me
I feel as if the one person I love
has pushed me off the edge of the cliff 
I am now stranded on this desert isle

Chours 1

Death seems so close yet so far 
the death sounds better than bearing
this fucking pain I hold the knife
steady and almost ready to get
away from this hell of a life

Verse 2

The gun was pointed straight at my
heart the trigger was pulled the
bullet released the bullet penetrated 
what once was my heart yet i still
survived the bullet may be gone, but
the pain lives on in my heart

Chours 1

Verse 3

The shooter, the one i love,
the one who pushed me off 
the cliff and stranded me on this island
knows i'm alive, but only just
I am merely held together by a few
threads of my heart every second i 
am not with him is like another 
thread is cut and he moves a step
closer to falling in love with another

Chours 2

Deaht is better than this bullshit
another minute alive is another chance 
to fuck up i sway the knife
on my wrist thinking of all the 
fuck ups I've had why live
so I can have more?

Verse 4

The one I love I feel I've lost
Its like I'm climbing a wall
that stands between us and 
I have two choices I can either 
fall and let myself die or keep
going knowing he's on the other side
waiting for me to climb over and jump
so he can catch me in his arms

Chours 1

Bridge

After four years of knowing 
him I grew to love him from the 
moment we met til now four
years later my love grew stronger
every day with him I dont feel
empty or worthless but complete
All my anger and sadness would fade
as soon as i heard his voice I want
to feel complete again and to
be with him forever.......

Verse 5

I've found what I seek in him
He has heard my cry he has seen
the smoke signals I've made
he has caught me after I jumped
from the wall and has carried me
away I have won the pain is gone
I am complete once again
I am happy and I have my happily
ever after

Chours 3 

Death was so close yet so far
the death is not better then the 
happiness I am feeling now
I put the knife away gone because
I've won I say good-bye to the 
pain and sadness and hello to 
a new life

Word of the day: Acrimonious: bitter in temper or language

well i am goin to go pee now... bye"

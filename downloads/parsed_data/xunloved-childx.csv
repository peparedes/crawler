"event","So i lost the love of my life. Right before homecoming. Everything is horrible. Im heartbroken beyond belief but trying to keep my spirits up. He wont even talk to me anymore... He ignores me. He wrote me a really bitchy not about how much he hates me. Damn i mustve done something horrible. I wish i knew what it was. But he wont tell me that either. I still went to homecoming though. && i had a blast. Im crushing on people, but one happens to be his best friend, Joe Daniels. So yeah. It kinda sucks. I cant do anything about anything right now. I wanna move on but i try and i cant. Everytime i see him i can literally feel my heart sinking. Its like one of those things that you see on tv, that you never think will be you, bc you just wanna have the perfect fairytale relationship. well i had that, and the perfect fairytale heartbreaking ending came right along with it. If i had my way, i would have him back. AT LEAST as i friend, i would settle. But for some reason he hates me and idky. I hate it. I hate him. But yet im in love with him. 
I hate alan more..
Hes the love of my life..
He also fucking killed me.
Thanks alot..
Yeah sry about the rambling but ineeded to get it out and idt anyone reads these anymore anyways.
kthnx

"event","So yeahhh. Pretty much all ive been doing is hitting the mall and the movies all the time with Tim. Yesterday i went to his house and we chilled there, then we went to the mall. I saw everyone. Bethani >.<, Zack >.<, Joeii, Rachel, Erin, Eddie, Sara, Puggy, Nicole, and a bunch of other people i used to hang out there with last summer. I even saw Dirk. He looked upset so i talked to him and him and his girl were having problems. I saw him in the same spot we used to hang out at and the same spot where i broke his heart. *sigh* it killed me. Then me and Tim got in the elevator which made it even WORSE cuz thats where me and Dirk always went. I almost cried. It took all i had to hold back tears. So then Me, Tim, and Danny went to the movies and saw Clerks 2. While we were waiting on Danny we talked and i watched Tim skate until it startd raining and we talked about how we were going to sneak some people in. Which i never helped lol but i was suppossed to but they kinda took over. But all in all the movie was good until Tim got mad at me, which really fkn' sucked but everything was better eventually. I love that kid sooo much. Then we came home and talked on the phone about a buncha stuff. I ended up bawling my eyes out for some stupid stuff, but then i wrote him a long ass note and went to be and when i woke up everything was alot better amazingly. I was suppossed to hang out with Tim today but i ended up being forced to the fair which i was kinda glad to go. Its mine and kevins tradition, and he always gets me roses. Well i wanted to ride rides. I didnt care how big or scary, cuz i dont like most of them. But we went on some really cool ones including the Drop Zone which is fuckin' scary but awesome lol i didnt even scream and i made through it!! I was proud. I got a teddy and a rose of course. I saw like a bazzillion people i knew and people i aint seen in forever. Like Travis, Danny, Danny, Dylan, Sam, and a bunch of others. So yeah. Now im home and it sucks cuz' Tim aint callin' me adn i wanted to sneak out and see him. *sigh* hes probably mad that i didnt hang with him today but i know ill make up for it i promise i will but he wont ever read this so its not like he'll know. But ive been tryin to get ahold of him forever. 
But yeah 2mrrw im most deff. hanging with him so NOONE try and change my plans. Then Wednesday im going to see Clerks 2 again cuz' it was just that damn good, then Friday and Saturday i have to go back to the fair for the Demolition Derby. Its 3 bucks to get in. Then afterwards im going to go ride some more rides and shit and its gonna be freakin' awesome. I really hope Tim goes with me though. Im really falling for that kid hard and idk what to do..It hasnt even been that long. But idk imma go wait on him to NOT call me i guess.

"event","Soo last night was pretty fun i guess you could say. Me, Kevin, Kendra, and Brian all chilled out here until Joeii and Tahnee came to get us for the movies. Kevin ended up going with us. We saw XMen 3 lol It was pretty awesome even though me, kendra, and Tahnee hadnt ever seen the 1st too. But it was good, ill admit. Lol. Soooo we were practicly the only ones in the theatre and me and kevin were messing around the whole time lol and like tickling each other and wrestling (THATS IT!!!!). And Yeah. I jumped a couple times. It was kinda scary lol. Thenn....i forget why but i got mad about something kendra said and i moved down a few rows and sat by myself for the end of the movie. I ended up clapping with my flip flops and getting extremely made fun of. haha. I was being immature and i loved it, Yes indeed. :] But anywayss. I tried climbing over the seats to the bottom but i only got like 2 and it DIDNT work out. Lol i almost fell so i stopped. Uhhmm...Then......i found my new favorite song. The really cool song off of Tokyo Drift. ^.^ Its pretty cool. We were dancing in the car. Then we came home. Uhhmm...Me and Joeii got in a ""fight"" in the middle of the street. Haha. It was funny. Errmm...They all left, Me and kevin ate dinner. Cole came over. We hung out. Yeah. That was about my night because then i got sick and yeahh. >.<
But i am getting ready to hang out with Joeii, Hailie, and Brittany so i guess i will write again later.

We went to the mall and met up with Joeii, Tolentino, Tahnee, and Hailie?Yea. Well we were all having a great time. I got a new shirt and a necklace and stuf fand it was just really fun. Well me and Hailie ended up talking about Brad and how much of an asswhole he is to girls and i thought i had her convinced not to go out with the loser cuz it would kill me and joeii both. Well we ended up leaving them and me and john went to see click again at 10. so we saw kyle and we chilled and talked on the phone to james and then watched the movie. well i got a voicemail from hailie saying brad was bout to ask her out and she was going to say yes. So i called joeii and told him and yeah. drama drama drama. now brad and hailie might go out and its crazy and idk if ill be able to talk to her once she does cuz shes hurting joeii and hes my BEST FRIEND and i dont wanna see her and brad together cuz, well, thats bullshit for one. >.< Gahhhh. Idk i just hate drama. but enough of the drama. uhhhmm...
Yeah. So its sunday..cole comes home 2nite or 2mrrw and then we are gonna spend the day together!!!!

"event","So i havent written in here since like forever. And joeii told me he wrote in his so i thought that id write in mine too. :) it all works. So lets see...I went out with...Codey for awhile. We broke up> Uhm...3x to be exact. Then i went out with brad whom i loved with all my heart but thats a completely different story. b/c now we are not aloud to talk to each other or anything of the sort so yeah. Thats over. Yeah. Ive been having relationship problems. It kinda sucks. I just wanna fine ""the one"" so then i can just be happy and move on from all this other past i have left and just not have to worry about anymore heartbreak and anything else. I did think Brad was the one..but then i also thought Dirk was too and that didnt turn out so well. There has been a few i thought was IT but it wasnt. But theres this guy now i like...and its not working out so well. Im not mentioning names just that hes been a good friend for about a year now. And ive known him since elementary school. I really like him, he really likes me, but for some reason he never wants to go out and its kinda annoying cuz im sick of just messing around i want a real relationship. but anyways. Enough rambling about guys. 
Family life really sucks. Nothing new. Yelling yelling, bitching, complaining, still living with my mom unfortunatly. Her new b/fs in and out. Her and my grandma both in and out of the hostpial. Yeah. Crazy. But oh well. 
Friends. well ive lost alot of them. from drama, and running their mouths, and me opening mine too unfortunatly. but just stupid stuff that you shouldnt loose friends over, i have. but hey. obviously they werent real friends then if they were going to let stuff like that happen again. ive also gained alot of really good friends that i wouldnt trade for the world..then some of them i just wanna kill lol but thats another story. But here latley ive been meeting up with alot of my old friends from last summer. Its kinda depressing. I really wish i really didnt have all those memories of last summer. But i think imma start usuing this more again. So i guess ill write later.

To much has happened to remember or write.

I just know that school last week was awesome.
Everything has been going pretty good since the last lock-in.
Wow. i think its a record.
god..im just so happy.
Idky. I just..havent been able to stop smiling since last weekend.
heh.

Anywayzz--
Im not going into my whole week last week.
Theres to much.
Ill just start from..hmm...i guess friday.

Friday--
Eddie didnt go to school.
So i didnt see him.
When i got home i did my hw and he came over.
We hung out on my front porch.
Eventually Courtney and Kendra came over.
Then Carlos.

Kevin couldnt cuz he had to help his mom w/ a garage sale then he went to a dumb concert.
hmm...
I wonder..hah.

We had alot of fun.
We just messed aroudn all day.
I really dont remember in detail everything that happened.
'Cept that Carlos gave me a gage for my ear.
Its only like a 14 or 16(katie said it was a 14)
But i still did it.
And i guess its awesome.
Now i still have to get my belly done.
After over 5 months of begging, i better get it done 2mrrw.
Everytime my mom says shes gonna take me she backs out.
It makes me mad.

Eventually though everyone left cept me and kendra.
The josh clark came over.
We walked around for awhile.
Sang a lil' bit of ICP.
And just hung out.
Then i had to go home and go in to eat dinner.

I talked on the phone to Eddie for awhile.
Then i felt really bad.
I layed down and went to sleep.
I wanted to wait up for kevin to call me but i just couldnt.
I was so sick.
My head was spinning.
I just needed rest...I needed him.
But obviously the only thing i got was rest.

Today--
I woke up at like 8am.
Still sick.
I realized kevin called..only once..at like midnight.
I was so upset.
I just wanted to talk to him.
I never see him anymore....its so gay.
I hate it.

Anywayzz--
I went back to sleep and woke up again at like 12:30.
I took a shower and went outside w/ a bunch of people.
I saw kevin off and on all day.
I guess i was sorta happy.
...sorta...

We hung out all day.
I was suppossed to go w/ kendra to columbus but my mom didnt want me to go if there were no parents.
Then she said that i didnt wanna go.
I honestly couldve cared less if i went or not.
Just blame everything on me...

Then everyone left and i came in.
My mom was being a bitch.
But whats new.

Later on tonight people are comin over to hang out.
Hopefully my mom will be drunk.
Itll help everything out sooo much.

Kevins not gonan be home all night.
I probably cant see him 2mrrw.
I cant see him the rest of the week.
Cant see him next friday cuz hes going to a stupid concert.
Oh well.
My friends have been a good target for replacing him when i miss him..

I just wish i could talk to him and see him more.
Thats all i want.

So muhc has happened.
So much has changed.
Im really confused, but yet so happy.
Ive never been this happy.
Even w/o him near me...ive never been so content..so happy.
Its weird.

But ya.

2mrrw is the last day of my funfilled (not) weekend.
Im gonna make the best of it.
Idk what im doing but its gonna be a pimpin day i can tell you that.
..At least i hope..

Well, right now im talking to Brian and waiting on people to come over.
Bored as hell.
So im out for now.

Ill update again whenever i remember.

So Eddie and I walked around then decided to head back to the Acres.
Springer passed us in a car.
But im not talking to him so ya..who cares.
So we kept walkin' and we stopped at Josh Clarks house to see him and kevin.
We ended up walking to kevins w/ him and messin' around a bit. 
Then we went to my house to get a drink.

We walked Eddie out of the neighborhood and i went home by myself.
I talked on the phone.
Watched tv and ate.

Eventually people came over for my mom.
I ate dinner and then went outside w/ Kyra, Kendra, and Courtney.
We went down to kevins and hung out.

"event","Well i went to the mall and Lockin friday.
It was awesome!!!!
Usually i dont like being aroudn a huge group of people.
But at the mall, it seemed like i was always w/ everyone.
It was awesome.
I saw shank, mara, stephani, joe, andy,tahnee, and tons of others.
It was the greatest!!

Zach rode the bus home w/ me Friday and went to the mall w/me.
It was fun.
Then at the mall we got kicked out.
It was a dumb reason but oh well.
So everyone went walkin to the dollar movies.
I stayed at AMC and called my mom to pick me up.

I met these two chicks there.
Holly and Kelly.
They were kinda preppy.
One of them was getting stood up.
Felt bad for her. Dumbass guy.
Then these boys were knockin on the window at her. lol
Bet she felt loved.
We talked about stuff. Mostly school, b/f's, friends, ect.
Talked about how i got kicked out of the mall.
Everything.

It was fun. Then my mom showed up.
I left the chicks and kevin called.
We talked. 
Then i talked to kendra.
When i got home i went down to kevins and hung out.
Swept his room.
Ect.

I stayed till 10:30 i think and we left and went off to the lockin.
Daniel called me 2x that night.
I was surprised.
We are starting to hang out again which really makes me happy.

Anywayzz--
We got there and i saw a bunch of my friends.
I saw Danny too.
I dont even think he knew who i was but now he does im sure lol.
So we got our braclets and just hung out.
Mostly i hung in the dance room w/ Sean, Mike, and Eddie.
I was soooo effin hyper it wasnt funny.
I couldnt sit still and had to be running around the whole time.

So thats what we did. 
Then i hung out w/ Daniel a whole whole lot.
And w/ Brian, Derek, and Spencer a little.
It was awesome.
I was right where i wanted to be.
In the middle of the fun.
W/ all of my friends.
..well..most of them..
and it was awesome.

Sean kinda started a little ''dance off'' in the dance room.
We took pictures.
It was cool.
He smoked every wigger in the place!!
It was awesome!! lol

We hung out the rest of the night mostly outside or upstairs.
Then somethin happened to katie.
I was worried but i couldnt do anything.
So i didnt stay w/ her and crystal.
oh todd and kevin too.
I just couldnt look at her the way she was acting.
Noone understands why. 
But oh well.
They can be mad at me for not being there...i really dont care.
I have my reasons.

Anywayzz--
Kevin got mad at me i think.
But thats ok cuz idc about that either.
I had the best night ive ever had in months so i really dont care.
Then when i got tired out i was going to lay by kevin but heh..no..
It was really crowded w/ people and him and crystal were less than an inch apart.
There was no room for me to even try.
So i layed down between Derek and Brian while we talked about Eddie and Daniel.

Eventually alot of people left.
I said my goodbyes.
And stood with Daniel and talked.
Then kevin woke up so we went outside to wait on our parents.
My mom showed up quickly.
hugs.
Then left.
He forgot his keys so it took him awhile to get inside.
But i didnt care.
I tried to fall asleep in the backside while we waited to make sure he was in.

I got home and it took awhile to sleep.
Eddie, mike, and sean called me and we talked a little.
Mara called and we talked a little. 
And tons of others called.
I fell asleep.
I woke up at 10.
Went back to sleep at 1.
And slept the rest of the day.
Woke up at 3:30 and ate dinner.

Then joe and me tried to find a way to the mall w/ a bunch of people.
It didnt happen.
Then i wanted to talk to or see kevin but go figure...im the last thing on his mind.
I miss him like hell.
He doesnt understand that i want to be w/ him...
But honestly, i think he could care less.
Specially as long as he has certain people in his life.

Oh well. 
They wont always be there for him.
i will..unless he fucks me over the way that i think he will..

So i talked on the phone.
Called Kevin.
He couldnt talk cuz for heavens sake he had to call his cousin so now idk where he is.
But oh well.
2mrrw im gonna hang out w/ my new friends and if he wants to see me..well..
he can kiss my ass.

But for now im out.
Lotsa Love.

So kendra and I went down to kevins and they were all there.
They talked.
I mostly listened.
I talked to Ashley a little though.
So it was ok.
I wasnt that lonely.

Then everyone left but Kevin, Kendra, Ashley, and I.
We hung out.
Then they all went in but kevin and kendra left.
I stayed there and we talked and hung out until like 8:30.
It was fun.
I <i>Love</i> spending time w/ him...

<b><i>Its me favorite time of day.</i></b>

We had sooo much fun.
Then the rest of my break i saw him maybe 2 times.
It sucked.

Then a bunch of drama happened which totally ruined my break.
But i soon got over it.
Well, no..i take that back..im still not really over it, 
but more important stuff took over my head.

I dont really remember much of what happened over my break, honestly.
There was too many things.
Too much.
But i do know that kevin and i got into it more than once.
It sucked but what am i supossed to do?
I try to work it out w/ him but it never goes that good.

Too much stuff happened w/ me and him over break to even go into.
I just know if i loose him again, idk what ill do.
Hes everything to me.

Anywayzz--
Last night Kendra went up to Tony's.
I wanted to go but couldnt.
It sucked.
I was supossed to go somewhere w/ Springer but it didnt work out.
So i stayed home.

I talked on the phone w/ Tony and Kendra.
Got i love that boy.
i miss him soooo much....
Then i met this new guy.
One of Tony's friends.
Moffitt. Idk how to spell it but thats how it sounds.

He seems really cool.
I want to meet him.
Im sure i will by the end of summer.
Dunno though.
Hoping...

Then i stayed up and talked all night online w/ the voice thingy.
W/ Zach and Tyler.
It was fun.
Kevin has church today and its almost 4.
Hes not home, well at least noone will answer.
Ive saw him 3 times over break and all i wanted to do was spend my last w/ him...
Oh well.
Thats not gonna happen.

I was supossed to get my belly pierced today!!
My mom finally agreed after months and months of begging and watching my friends get it and me not being able too.
I have almost enough money.
In fact i think i do have enough.
But i cant go to the lockin friday if i do it.
Oh well, ill spend my Josh!! lol
Thatll be fun.

Maybe ill go mallin' and such.
Most likely.
Might see a movie.
Just hang alone.
Who knows.
I guess ill find out when the time comes.

Well, i dont want to get my belly pierced today...
I do but i missed my chance cuz i dont wanna go alone.
I want kevin to go w/ me...but he has to be at church at 4 fuckin oclock w/ Ash, Katie, and Crystal.
Hmmmm....oh well.

Like always....

Shes really cool.
Glad im getting to know her.
We all went to the mall.
I saw Stan, Joey, Johnni, everyone was there.

It was pretty fun.
I spent most of my time w/ stan.
Lookin' at posters and different things like that.
Stan, John, and I saw a clown at the mall.
It was fat and had purple hair. haha

Well, i ended up getting sick at the mall.
Like dieing sick.
I felt like i was going to die.
I couldnt move w/o being in pain, but i didnt want to leave.
So i just walked around.

Then John, Kevin, and Tahnee got kicked out.
I wanted to hang w/ them and wasnt gonna just leave them by theirselves so i left w/ them.
We walked around and stuff. I was feeling a little better too.
Then i felt sick again.
We went to Best Buy to look for the new ABK cd.
I saw Aaron Pruitt there. Wow. its been awhile.
He was laughing at me. 
Probably cuza Kevin.
Oh well.

We left and went back to the mall. 
I called my mom and told her i was really sick.
She needed to come pick us up.
So we sat and waited.
Then john had to leave.
Right after that we left too.

Then here comes the fun...not.
Stupid church peoplez, teenagers, whatever, had the great idea to drive out in front of us.
Smart...sooooo smart..
I think everyone can fill in the blanks after that.
The stupid car hit us.
Crash.
Blah.
All i wanted to do was go home and sleep.
And they ruined my plans.

<i>Thanks soooo much.</i>

Anywayzz--
We took Tahnee home after cops came, swapped insurance, ect.
Then we took kevin home.
Then i went home.
I went straight to the bathroom then bed.
Talked on the phone to kevin a little bit, but i had no energy left to get online.
So i ended up falling asleep..
Then my mom woke me up for whitecastles.
Fun.

So ya..fun filled first day of spring break.
Idk if im gonna do much the rest of it..
Doubtful.
But idk.

But peoplez are calling my cell so i gotta hit it.

Love much.

I went to the mall with Katie and her little brother Justin.
We had so much fun.
We just messed around the whole time.

We were in Spencer 14 times! and one time for over 2 hours.
It was awesome.
We just hung out in there.
And katie wore her pimpin' marijuana leaf outfit! haha.
Well, we ate and stuff and hung out in the food court.
We went in Nirvana and a bunch of other places.

We all went in DEBS and katie and i were looking at dresses.
Then her brother looked at this white dress. Hes lie ""45$!! Thats a cheap wedding dress!""
It was great.
He kept jumping out of clothes racks at us too.
Omg he about killed katie! lol it was awesome.

Then i think it was katie that fell down on the floor in the mall.
In front of everyone. lol haha funny shit right there.

Anywayzz-
After being in Spencers for 2 hours i dragged them out. haha
We walked through Von Maur and we were walking up that ramp thing and we spotted Brian!
I was happy then!
We gave him hugs and i talked on the phone w/ kevin while watching him and katie play hackey sack.
Then he let me play with his sack! hehe yay!!

He had been there for 2 effin hours and didnt ONCE go into Spencers!!
Grr. I couldve beat that boy.
Then, as soon as we found him he had to leave.
I was like omgthis is gay.
So we were back to being just the 3 of us again.

We went back in Spencers.
Nonie, Dalton, and a bunch of other people were there.
I cant believe i liked Dalton for 3 effin years!! grrr..yuck!
We arent friends w/ Nonie but we knew who she was from school.
So we ended up leaving Spencers...again.
We walked to the food court and saw Zandra and a bunch of people.
Then we walked to Dicks.

We played around on the excersize equipment for awhile.
Then katie moshed with the punching bags.
Justin found him a little g/f name...Katie.!  haha.
Adorable.
We eventually had to leave though so we went back to the mall.

We went to Hot Topic and saw Lana, Jesse, Nonie, and a bunch of other people.
Lana hat a pimp hat and a weiner! haha. 
It was great.
Then we got to see jesse in a size small shirt.
It was hot haha lol. He was hot! lol
So we walked around and ended up where..Back in Spencers! lol

Lana and them came in there too.
She gave Katie and I little pins that said I AM LOVED!
It was awesome.
Eventually they kicked us out cuz the mall was closing. Grrrness.
So we went outside to wait on katies mom to pick us up.
Well before that we were being stalked by Mexicans..we were paraniod to be alone outside.
Sooo her mom ended up being an hour late.
Withing that hour we sang songs and planned on how to make money and live as a bum.

Last night was all a blur...
Everything was.
I dont know why.

I got up and got on the bus.
Everything normal.
Went to school.
We hung out and shit then went to class.
It was our last day for 12 week classes so i was happy.
I won something in computers.
Then i ran down the hallway screaming ""Im so happy! I never have to come back to this hell hole again..."" then my friend cut me off and said, ""Until next year""
You ruined everything!! lol
Well..the rest of my day is also..a blur.
Besides the fact that i got to sit out of gym and Derek, Andy and Brian walked me to computers.

Derek..You are a dumbass! And you got me in trouble.! grr lol.

Anywayz--
I went to last period. 
We had to make a flashlight.
We were the last people done and we got minus 2 pts. Lol
Oh well. At least it worked.

Then i talked to Michael, Sam, and the new kid Kameron.
The new kid seems cool.
Smart and short, heh, but cool.
Grant didnt like him at the beggining of the year cuz he was short.
It was hilarious.

So then..i ate the foil off our flashlight! haha.
Jessica stuck duct tape on my back that said virgin(not) haha.
Then michael took the paper off his battery and i stuck it onmy shirt.
Fun fuN!!.

Well after that class i remember bits and pieces.
I went to my locker.
I chatted w/ my ""LockerMates"".
I dont think anyone came to my locker that time but honestly..i dont remember.
I got on the bus and kevin and i were wrestling.
Then he grabbed me and he obviously didnt realize it but he squeezed my wrists really hard.
They still hurt.
I was scared.
But i FINALLY got Pete's tennis ball. Heh.

So i came home and talked online.
Then to kevin on the phone.
Then i got a visit from Alan, then Springer.
Fun.

I was suppossed to go to Acts but i canceled that to go to Logos.
But then my mom was being a bitch and said no i change me mind you cant go.
I was so mad.
There was noone to talk to.
Then kevin called me back.
We talked forever it seemed as i was reading a story online.
Its awesome.
But then all i remember was i layed down on the top bunk in the computer room.
The radio was on.
The door was shut.

I remember talking about nothing. Just sitting there.
Falling slowly into a deep sleep on him.
I heard him ask if i wanted to go to sleep.
I think i said no.
He asked that question alot though.
Then the next thing i knew...i woke up.

The door was open.
The computer was off.
My cd was out of the computer..
and most of all.
The phone had been put on charge.

Did i fall asleep on the phone w/ him?
I dont even fucking know.
I just want to know what happened last night.
Im worried i said something that i shouldnt have said.
But i dont even know.
I wish i knew how our conversation ended.
I really do.

I wish i knew if i said I Love You or not...
even though he knows i do.
I just dont know.
I wish he would call me though.
I need to talk to him...Badly..

Well, Gotta hit it.
Off to the shower.

Anywayzz--
Today went well i guess..kinda.
I got up and turned my alarm off.
Then fell back asleep.
I woke up super late and rushed to get ready.
Only cuz i wanted to see kevin on the bus.
If it wasnt for him i would have taken my time.

Well, i got ready and made it outside.
I got on the bus and we Chit chatted awhile.
It was Pete's b-day.
I woke alot of people up yelling happy birthday to him. heh.
Sorry guys.
So i cuddled w/ kevin until we were at school. 
We got off the bus and headed in.

We all hung out and walked around. 
It was fun.
Then 1st period we had a sub. Even funner.
Then every other period until gym was normal i think.
Besides the fact Micheal was back!
Omg i was so fucking happy!
My talking buddy was back.
All my classes wouldnt be as boring since he was back.
I think he skipped.hehe
Shhh! dont tell!

Then gym. We had ""Hoops for Heart"" 
Of course, i forgot to collect money.
So we stayed in our gym and ran around and junk w/ the eight graders.
In the period before that my friend Grant tripped me. 
Dustin was laughing at me.
Then to top that off they were in there getting scoliosis junk done.
So they were making fun of me probably.
Grr you guys! lol.
Grr you!!

Anywayzz--
We got done and went to the locker rooms.
There were like a gazillion fights today.
One w/ Elizabeth Shacke and Tiffany something.
Well everyone was asking me if i got in a fight.
I was like me. In a fight. Come on now. No way.
All the chicks were talking about it. 
We were all talking about it.
And the other fights of the day.
It was great. 
Then we went to lunch.

Uhh..Zach got in a fight today and got his lip busted.
Poor zach. _sniffles_
But he got to eat lunch w/ us b/c of it. w00h00! 
Thats awesomeness.
We had so much fun.

Mad is mad lol.

So i went in class then i saw Kevin outside in E hall. 
Idk what he was doing.
He was suppossed to be in A.
So then me, sam, and Tara struggled to build a flashlight.
Heh. We got the bulb to light up does that count for anything?
And i found the paperclips!! WOOHOO!! GO ME!! Lol anywaysz..

Well then it was fun fun in science class. 
Then i saw kevin leave on 1st bell w/ a bunch of chicks.
He barley looked at me.
I felt weird.
I felt...idk.
I wanted to go w/ him but i know mrs.Borland knows im 2nd bell.
I wasnt going to get caught.
So i just talked and waited.

I finally got out of class.
Kevin was right there at my locker. 
Well..ya.
Then Kendra and I got in trouble for sitting on the ramps.
Ok..so kevin and i cuddled on the bus as usual..
And then we got off and left.

The whole world pissed me off.
Why the fuck are people the way they are.
So disrespectful. So missunderstanding.
So hateful. Why are they all fucking bitches?
Ok well not all of them but alot of them.

Grrr..And our convo about racism and predgiodist and stuff made me even more mad.
Going against people cuz a different skin color.
The type of clothes they wear.
Or as my teacher said the color hair they have..Thanks Mrs. Borland. heh. It was directed towards me.
I just dont understand how that makes a difference..
But ok..
Whatever whips your cream..haha stephani.

I said by to my 'locker mates' haha.
And departed to go to my exit.
Hmm..i saw everyone.

I really thought nothing of it.
It just hurt thats all..well i guess not.

Last night it started hurting WORSE and Worse...
I was almost in tears.
I ended up laying down w/ an icepack on it.
I fell asleep.
I woke up at 9 and went to the bathroom.
I looked in the mirror and my fucking eye was allll swollen.
I FLIPPED!
I ran in and woke me mom.
She said she was taking me to the hospital later.
I cried and yelled then went back to bed and put a cold, wet rag on it.

I slept. Long and hard.
I woke up off and on every few min. 
Sometimes just for no reason. 
Sometimes cuz my phone was ringing.
I never once answered it though.
I was just hoping it was Brian or Kevin.
So i stayed asleep till 3.
I woke up to kevin calling.

He was at Brians.
They wanted me to come down there.
WERE THEY INSANE!!
Obviously.
I looked at my eye again.
No better.
I told him about it. 
I said i could come down and we got off the phone.
Well i ended up getting ready and going down there to hang out.

We ended up at his house after awhile.
AFTER Brian and him had a floppy disk fight! haha.
Long story.
Anywayzz--
We went down there and hung out for awhile.
Then went outside until his mom got home.

Brian and I came here and watched tv.

I left kendra at the computer.
Didnt tell anyone i was leaving. 
I just kinda got up and walked away.
I layed down on the couch.
I felt helpless.
I dont even know why.
I just layed there and cried.

My mom walked in the room.
Then kendra.
I quickly dried my tears.
Not that it mattered.
I was tired.
I wanted to rest.

First i have been online all day.
Having so much effin fun.
Talking to Brian mostly.
Thats it.

And then Kendra came down.
We hung out a bit, and then we went to the store.
We had to go in and get stuff for Tacos.
Hehe. Some old guys got squidward..lol
Long story.

Then we went to the gas station.
Fun.
We went in to get a paper for my mommi-oz.
Some dude told kendra her shoe was untied w/o looking at her shoe even.
lol weird.

Well, we went home.
Got here, my grandma said Kevin's dad came to the door..
For my mom.
I figured i knew what he wanted..
I <i><b>partialy</b></i> right.
But there was more.

They sat in the kitchen and talked about me and kevin.
Kendra and I listened from the bathroom for awhile.
Then she came in here and got on the computer.
I stayed in the bathroom.
I listened.
I did my makeup..
I cried.

How the hell do they think all this shit?
How do they find out all of this?
They think i left cigs in kevins room!?!
No. No way.
Just cuz a certain person told them that.

<i>Do they always believe what they here?</i>

Obviously.
Oh well. 
Their problem..

So ya. 
Kevins dad knows we have been on the phone till 4 in the morning now.
Great.
No more talking to him.
God. 
I fucking hate parents.
They need to fucking..grr..go somewhere other than here.
Ya thats it.
In nice terms.

Anywayzz--
Ya.
I found out a bunch of other stuff that they know.
And grr.
Its pissing me off.
And i guess i cant talk to kevin about it until Wednesday. 
Oh ya. What joy!

<b>Not.</b>

Grr..i hate this.
I hate this so bad.
They said Kevin and I are both good kids.
We just get mixed in w/ the wrong people.
Well, i dont think i am.
And i dont think ive done anything <i>that bad</i> latley.
Not bad enough to get in trouble for anywayzz.

Im not the one who has 3 referals in 2 days.
Im not the one who gets 2 ASD's in one day.
Im not the one that gets ISS for a week.
Exactly...

Well idk. 
But if i cant talked to kevin im gonna be majorly pissed.
MAJORLY!

Oh well. Its not my fault.
Really.
Its peoples.
Other than mine.
But thats about it for now.

Oh well.

Anywayzz--
I was really hyper. 
It was funny.
I was singing to him.
It was cute i guess.
We talked about anything and everything.

Then his phone died around 3 or 4. 
Something like that.
After that i just drifted off to sleep.
<i>Dreaming Of Him</i>

Today--
I slept on the couch.
At 11:30 i felt something weird on my face.
It was my doggie!
She was licking my face to wake me. 
Awww..What a way to wake up..To my adorable doggie.
She wanted to play so even though i was half asleep...
We played.
Only for about 5 min. But we still played.

Then..my mother yelled at me. 
Go figure.
She wouldnt stop.
It really pissed me off.

So..i yelled back.
She got mad. 
Very mad.
I watched tv and ate some chips after that.
Then took a shower and got dressed.

Now im sitting here.
Talking to my Brian and my Rach-ull.

Anywayzz--
Courtney came over and we listened to our old music.
Relived our old times throughout last summer.
When i was obcessed w/ David..
So nieve.

It was sad at first.
Then we talked to her b/f Stan which none of you know.
So its pretty pointless to mention him. Oh well.
Hes ghetto. Sounds kool.
Better treat her right or ill kill him.
Grr...

She eventually left. I did some laundrey and cleaned some more.
Then i got online to have a little fun.
The rest of the night is absolutley mine.

I hung out w/ kendra for awhile.
I wasnt going to go to A.c.ts but then i realized...
Jessi was going! i wanted to see her so effin bad.
I missed her.
I hurried to get ready. 
Then kendra and I left for acts.

We got there. I saw everyone. It was awesome.
We danced, had fun. 
Normal night at club acts.
It was a little weird being their w/ all of me 'old' friends.
People that i havent talked to or hung out w/ in forever.
We were just..all together.
It was ok i guess.

We had fun. 
Jessi and Crystal are becoming close again.
i guess thats cool.
Awesome.

Jenni is going out w/ this Jordan dude now.
Sooo sweet hehe.
<i>I Love You Jenni! Im always here for you!</i>

Then...hmm..nothing else really different.

After devotion just sucked.
I hung out for a little bit.
Then got tired of following people around. 
Hanging out.
Talking ect.
I got sick of it.

I just walked around by myself.
Hugging my little bear i got from kevin.
Thinking.
I didnt really talk to many after that.

Then kevin called my moms cell phone.
We talked till it was time for me to go home.
I kinda hung out and talked after that.
But not to very many.
I mostly just walked around.alone.
Talked on my mothers phone to kevin.

It was time to leave.
I got off the phone.
Said my goodbye.
And kendra and I left.
My mom took us to whitecastle and then we came home.
I ate.Then talked on the phone more to kevin..

We got off and i got online and watched tv.
I tried to sleep. Cant.
I read peoples websites...ya..found something out and read something off someones i didnt want to read.
It really pissed me off. But hey. Oh well.
Im sure thats why it was on there.
Of course.

Well, now im here doing this stupid livejournal. 
I guess im just gonna go off and mess around.
Maybe mess w/ my site and look at more peoples.

Idk.

Last night i was suppossed to go to acts and couldnt. 
It sucked but i really didnt want to go anyway.
I dont think im gonna go at all anymore.
Not unless my Jessmess goes.
I miss her dearly.

So, last night i wasnt suppossed to go anywhere.
Well i threw a bigggggg fit until i could.
I ended up going to the mall to see my bub.
It was awesome. 
Alot of people were there but we hung out together most of the time.
Just us.
I missed him so much i almost cried when i saw him.

I ran to his arms and gave him the biggest hug i think hes ever recieved.
Then i got invited to the movies by some people to see BoogeyMan.
I went.
Kendra, Keiona whom i havent seen forever.
I would never pass up the opportunity to see her.
Then Zach which many or most all of you dont know.
And Big Joe.

We saw Josh Bell there. Which none of you know either.
Kendra got mad a little but she ended up calming down.
There were many people there we knew.
We saw Spencer. Daniel..honestly not who i wanted to see at that time.
Then some other people leaving the movies with them when we were coming in.

There was just everyone there.
And the movie. All out great.
Awesome.
The ending sucked but it was great.
Recommended!!

Then i came home and Zach, Kendra, and I finished all of my hot cheetos.
I came in the house and talked on the phone for awhile. It was 12 or 1.
Then i ended up getting tired.
Got off the phone.
And drifted off to sleep.

Thats about my day.

Weird..but awesome.

<b>Friday--</b>
Aj rode the bus home w/ me. We had tons of freakin fun on the bus.
It was great.
He seemed to fit in pretty well w/ everyone.

Then, Springer came over and hung out w/ Aj, Kendra, Alicia, and I.
Courtney was here for a bit too.
Then James came over but he got mad at me cuz' springer was over.
I hate that.
I cant even be friends w/ who i want to be.
But i just love my bubbi so fucking much. Idk anymore.
James left and Aj and I went in to eat Wendy's.

Then Kendra and Katie came over. Little Katie.
We hung out. Pictures. Cuddles. hehe. Fun stuff.
Then Alicia came over. Kendra left. And we hung out on the computer for awhile.
Then...time for acts.
Which my mom FORCED us to go to. I told her no i didnt wanna go. But she wouldnt listen.
Go figure. Nothin new.
So we went and actually, had an AWESOME time.

It was ALOT funner than usual. I made alot of new friends within the hours i was there.
God i loved it. And in the end I was pretty happy my mom made us go.

My Katie crowd surfed for the first time!! w00t w00t!! go katie!! 

Anyways. Katies mom picked us all up and took us to Aj's. We went in and met his mom.
I saw his baby brother who is soooo adorable.
Then it was time for us to come home.
So we said out goodbyes to him and all came to my house.
I lost my voice and got really sick. So we didnt do that much when we got home.
They both spent the night.

Well..theres my Super Cool Friday.

<b>Saturday--</b>
I woke up w/ absolutley NO VOICE.
Eventually it slowly started to come back, but i was really horse.
I talked to my bub. Big Joe. And he gave me some ideas of how to get it back within the hours.
It came back very little. I tried everything.
Theraflu. Salt water. Throat spray. Cough syrup. Dayquil. Tea w/ honey and lemon(alicias idea) and Hot sauce! Ajs mom said it would work lol. It kinda did. lol. Took forever for me to try it though.

So it came back a little. And then...I had to go to Ajs for dinner.
Wow. I was so Fucking scared it wasnt even funny.
I was shaking and katie was laughing at me.
Well, i got ready VERY quickly. I was rushing around like crazy.
I coudnt calm down.
Then, I heard the cardoors and a minute later they were at the door.
They came in and chit chatted w/ my momma for a bit.

Then we left. Went to the store. Then back to his house.
We talked. Cuddled. Kissed. So on and so forth. It was awesome.
He is soooo romantic...hehe. And really sweet. Such a gentleman.
Hes freakin awesome. Not like anyone ive ever been w/ before.
Gosh..its great.

I played w/ his kittie and then his dog. Cookie. It was fun.

Then..dinner time.
We ate and watched a movie w/ his mom and stepdad. 
It was called the Collateral i THINK. None of us really remembered.
It was pretty good. It was kinda violent in a way..but hey.what isnt these days?

We talked a little during the movie and dinner. Then, after the movie was over. 
Aj and i headed upstairs to his room.
We hung out for a half an hour or so until it was about 11:00.
Then my mom called to get directions. And awhile after the doorbell rang.
I said my goodbyes and left.
So sad..._tears_

I miss him already.

:[

Then my mom and i went to kroger. I stayed in the car and listened to the radio. 
She came out and we talked about my night and laughed.
Then we went home and brought in the groceries to once leave again.
We went to meijer and i bought me a cd called <b>Headbangers Ball Vol.2.</b> 
Its a pretty good cd. It has A Perfect Circle, Korn, Slipknot, Kittie, HIM, Bleeding Through, Lamb of God, and alot more.
I also got an adorable black skirt. It it very cute. I mostly got it for valentines day even though its a ways away. Ill prolly get a different one from the mall though.
Who knows.

So i came home and then went to bed.
And now..here i am. Being bored online. Ive been up since 10. I need to clean.
Dont really feel like it though.
Now, my mom and i are supossed to go to the mall. Very doubtful though.
So im just gonna sit here and hang out for awhile until something to do just falls out of the sky.

So until then i guys im off. 
Talking to my Austin. :]!!!!!! Yaynessess!!

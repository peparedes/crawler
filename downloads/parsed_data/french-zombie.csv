"event","So I am now officially no longer in France.  I'd like to say I shed a tear for my hometown of the past year as the train pulled away, but that would be lying.  Actually I flipped it the bird and cackled, much to the disapproval of the woman sitting across from me.  But I will admit that for the briefest instant I had a feeling that Clermont Ferrand was genuinely sad to see me go and actually tried to convince me to stay by apologizing for its previous behavior.  While trying to lug my 200 lbs. of luggage down the six flights of stairs in my building, the cleaning lady came down and offered for me to use the elevator!  Then I finally lugged all my crap down to the bus station only to wait half an hour and find out that the busses weren't running and I was going to miss my train.  But then by some miracle a huge tourbus stopped right in front of me and dropped off the last passenger on the bus.  I stared at the driver's back until he looked at me and I asked jokingly if he was going by the train station.  He laughed and said, ""No, why?""  Then I glanced at all my luggage and said, ""because I have a lot of luggage.""  And he helped me load my suitcases and took me to the train station even though it was way out of his way, for FREE!!!!!  I have to admit that at that point I was slightly terrified that a 747 was about to crash into me and blow me to kingdom come, but it never happened.  And so France had won, completely and utterly.  It teased and tormented me the whole time I was there, to the point where I could completely justify hqting its guts, and then (since France always has the final say) France turned around and was exceedingly nice to me, just so I would feel guilty and awkward about hating it all the time.  The last supreme victory, France has stolen my right to be pissed off.  Like France is Rebecca and I am the new Mrs. DeWinter or something.  

So farewell to everyone who laughed and cried and cursed right along with me and my blog.  I'd like to say it's been fun but . . .well, actually I wouldn't really like to say that.  (But you KNOW the sick part of me liked it.  If complaining were an Olympic sport, I'd definitely be on the podium)"

"event","OOH!  How professor Umbridgey!  I didn't even notice until after I typed it.  . . .you guys can tell this is going to be 'one of those days', can't you . . .  Yeah so anyway, on Sunday I actually got to go hiking out in the volcanoes because Jonathan is my hero and he found the bus that goes out there (it would have been an exceedingly long walk otherwise) and so we went up there and the second we got off the bus (and it was quite literally to the second) it began to rain.  We took two steps towards the visitors center and it started to pour.  We took two MORE steps towards the safety of the visitors center and were bombarded with lightening and thunder (which is particularly terrifying when you are on the top of a volcano).  We started sprinting and soon found the air so thick with water and electricity that it was just easier to swim the rest of the way.  It would be two hours before the bus came back, and we were now stranded on the top of a quickly flooding mountain, but we lived in naive hope that the rain would stop long enough for us to walk around.  (yeah, right!  have you READ the rest of my journal!?)  So we sat in the cafe with all the Frenchies and waited for an hour and a half, then finally the rain let up and we decided to at least take a quick once around the mountain before we went back down.  
We started walking and got all the way around to the point of no return (ya know, the point where it would be just as easy to go forward as backward to get to where you started) when the rain started up again, and this wasn't just little drizzly stuff that turned into rain.  No, it was like  . . .no rain, LOTS OF RAIN!  We opted not to bother running, since after about two seconds the downpour had already thouroughly soaked our underwear, but the weather didn't like being snubbed, so it dropped dime-sized hail on us the rest of the way back.  We ran then.  We got back to the visitors lodge and there was a large group of French people standing at the windows watching the whole thing, who subsequently laughed at us as we sloshed our way towards the bathrooms to find paper towels.  Of course there weren't any, so we left the bathrooms soaking wet and covered in little shreds of toilet paper, which we found out doesn't handle water well without dissintegrating into a million sticky pieces.  

And so the score remains, France: 3766, Me: 0

In other news, I have discovered that I am very good at pretending, particularly at pretending I'm not home.  This has only recently become necessary since I ran into this guy from Senegal who has apparently been watching me all year wanting to talk to me and finally got the guts to do it.  Yeah, great, whatever, he was kind of interesting to talk to at the time, but now he won't go away.  I wouldn't mind so much except that he seems mildly stalker-like and he fancies himself a philosopher and spent all Monday afternoon explaining to me how democracy is the worst form of slavery, and that kings are way better (at which point I was thinking, 'yeah, tell that to the serfs.')  I then asked him if Senegal was a democracy, which it is, and he said 'yeah, it's way better now than it was.'  And I had to bite me toungue to keep from saying innocently, 'oh, you mean when it had kings?' Then he went into this bleeding hearts why-his-girlfriend-dumped-him speech, which almost made me physically sick, and the verdict at the end was that she dumped him because he loved her too much . . . Funny, I was getting the impression that she dumped you because you were needy, always out with your other girlfriends, never bathed, and were poor to boot.  I guess maybe I just didn't understand it correctly.  So now he comes knocking on my door a couple times a day, at which point I ignore him completely, and now I only have to talk to him if he catches me on the street, because I can't just be rude and say go away.  He's actually perfectly nice, he's just a very trying person to be around, magnified by the fact that he thinks we are kindred spirits or something like that because he thinks I think deep thoughts just like him.  I don't have the heart to tell him that my deep thoughts are all about Harry Potter and X-men and other equally inane things to think deeply about.  Oh well, only five more days and I'll leave this country forever."

"event","So it is now a million degrees outside, never a cloud in the sky, and the sun stays out for 20 hours at a time.  I never noticed that we had air conditioning at home, in fact I was always turning it down, but now that I don't have it . . . I'm ready to kill someone.  It is SO hot that all you can do in the afternoons is go find a nice airconditioned theatre or cafe, or sit in your dorm room in your underwear.  The problem is that I don't want to, nor can I afford to go to the theatre everyday, and cafes don't HAVE air conditioning here.  So I'm stuck being insufferably hot all the time.  This brings about several other problems as well.  (well duh)  Being hot doesn't rule out the necessity for exercise, plus I have to walk everywhere anyway, so I go take walks and come back and do Tai Bo and drink gallons of water.  I also sweat profusely.  You may now be thinking that this really isn't a problem, but WAIT FOR IT!  My window must now remain open all the time (I don't think I've shut it for two weeks) to prevent being cooked alive in my room.  So my window's wide open and my bed is right under the window so I get a nice breeze while I'm sleeping, but I woke up this morning to find out that I wasn't alone.  The salt on my skin had attracted beetles which I found crawling all over my arms.  Talk about a rude awakening.  That was at six in the morning (the sun was already shining brightly) so I decided to go back to sleep for a while.  The next time I woke up because I thought I heard something.  I sat up and immediately felt a huge thing on my throat.  I batted at it and a huge bumblebee went flying out the window.  The stupid bee had been attracted to my Be Delicious perfume.  Needless to say the window is now closed and will remain so for the rest of my stay here.   . . .I hate this country."

"event","So, normally I would be beyond boredom at this point since there is nothing to do and no one to talk to and I don't have any money, but somehow I seem to fill the days.  Mostly with thinking deep thoughts, but there is also the constant hunt for food since the French seem to have upped the number of impromptu bank holidays and have also decided that the cafeteria will now only serve students if it feels like it.  I actually walked in there the other day and they kicked me out because the food was for some baseball team and NOT for students, which I thought was a little harsh since there was plenty of food and only one of me.  

Anyway, deep thoughts.  I have been analyzing recently my social anxiety and have decided that it is more likely a bizarre form of ego-centrism.  Take, for example, the things I am usually thinking about OTHER people as I walk down the street:

She thinks my shoes look retarded.
That guy is probably on his way to close the grocery store before I get there.
Wow!  HE doesn't look like a serial killer *sarcasm*  What if he's waiting in the bushes when I get home!?
I've seen that woman every day for two weeks!  I think she's stalking me!  (that one was my personal favorite thought because immediately afterwards my brain said, 'You're always walking behind her!  If anything YOU are stalking HER!'  to which I replied, 'That's exactly what she'd WANT me to think!')

Notice the only thing in common between these thoughts is ME.  And the thing that would make me avoid human contact is the PARANOIA of how all these people are going to affect me.  See, so now I have proved that there is no such thing as social anxiety.  It is actually a combination of ego-centrism and paranoia.  I'm a genius!  I should write a thesis and publish it in a medical journal.  I might even win a Nobel!

"event","Okay so yesterday I was sitting in my room minding my own business when I hear this giant crash in the bushes.  I poke my head out the window cause I'm assuming that one of the alley cats fell down the hill behind my dorms, but I can't see anything on all the bushes.  Then I see everyone else looking out the window too, only they are staring straight down at the bushes right next to the building.  That's when I saw a foot sticking out of the top of the bushes.  Someone had fallen out the window.  This is a particularly bewildering thing for someone who lives on the fifth floor.  I sat there clutching the window ledge unable to move, just staring down at this guy in the bushes.  I couldn't even ask him if he was okay, I was like a deer in the head lights.  The whole time I'm just thinking  ""Oh my GOD!  You CAN fall out of the windows!""  Luckily he was fine since he only fell out of the second story, but for a second I thought he HAD fallen off the fifth floor because I recognized him as the guy who lives next door to me.  I was thinking either he was drunk and fell out or he was drunk and jumped out on a dare, but it turns out they were having a party and he was standing on the bed by the window when someone bumped into him.  There is now a hilarious cartoon-style human shaped hole of breakage in the bushes beneath my window."

"event","Okay, so my parents came to visit and showed me that everywhere ELSE in France is pretty and fun, and I just happen to live in the one exception. Kinda like the Twilight Zone or something.  Then we went to Austria (Alps are the best mountains ever) and Bavaria (Mad Ludwig owns my soul) then they went home without me . . . I was less enthusiastic about this part of the deal.  So now I'm back in Shi- . . . Clermont and things have slipped into their usual groove of amazing weird crap that happens to me all the time.  My new favorite happened on Friday night.  I had been in a considerable amount of pain all day from an ailment that I thought I was over (I shall spare you the details of this ailment, but you'll probably figure out what it was anyway).  Finally at around midnight I decided that I couldn't wait this out through the weekend when the student clinic opened on Monday, I needed to go to the hospital NOW!!!  The first snag I ran into was that I didn't know where the hospital was, and I probably couldn't have walked all the way there even if I did, so I would need some wheels.  I decided that since I wasn't bleeding out of any gaping neck wounds or anything the occasion didn't warrant an ambulance, which I was unwilling to pay for anyway, so I dug out my trusty student handbook and called a cab.  In true French form, he said he'd be around in forty minutes.  I told him, no hurry, but I would like to see the hospital in the near future and hopefully not in a bodybag.  He said he'd be at the door in five minutes.  Funny how time and distances fluctuate for the injured.  So, unwashed, wearing my baggy pajamas and glasses, I slipped on the only slip on shoes I had, my shiny black dress shoes and ran down the six flights of stairs and through the student building to meet the cabbie on the other side.  I jumped in and he drove at about 200 km/hr for about 15 seconds and we were there.  He asked for six euros and I handed him the only cash I had, which was a twenty.  He glanced at it and asked me if I had anything smaller.  Smaller?  SMALLER?!  We're sitting there in the ambulance wing and I am shaking with pain and he asked me for CORRECT CHANGE?!  Finally he gave me change and said good luck and left me there to wander through a labirinth of frosted doors and hallways to find the emergency room, which was harder than I thought necessary.

So, of course, I walk in there in my glasses and pajamas and dress shoes and everyone else is impeccably dressed, even and especially the doctors.  Having watched a lot of hospital dramas in America I was for some reason under the impression that nurses and doctors wear white shoes, or at least practical shoes so as to promote hygiene and efficiency.  One doctor was wearing strappy turquoise high heels that matched her scrubs, a nurse was wearing hot pink crocs that didn't match anything, and a lot of the guys were wearing Burkenstock sandals . . . I could tell it was going to be a long night.  Luckily it wasn't a busy night and they got me in there fairly quickly (though they didn't seem to believe that I was ailing) and handed me the little urine cup and the backless paper moo-moo with questionable yellow stains on it.  The backless, stained moo-moo was compulsory, so I threw it on and then was forced to walk through all the rooms we had just come through filled with doctors and patients to the bathroom which was back in the first waiting room.  Surely, I thought as I closed the door, they could afford to have more than ONE bathroom in the hospital.  But whatever, just pee in the cup and make them happy.

Now I don't pretend to know ANYTHING about medicine, but luckily I am familiar enough with snow to know that urine is not generally the same color as black cherry cool-aid.  I think I stood in the bathroom staring in disbelief at that cup for a full five minutes before the doctor knocked on the door and asked if I had fallen in.  Straightening my backless moo-moo I walked out and handed it to him, at which point he stopped smiling.  'Damn straight' I thought to myself.  He took me back to a little room with a stretcher just for me, right next to a woman who looked like she was dying, but was still impeccably dressed.  So I just kind of sat there cross-legged on the stretcher, whiling away the hours by trying to guess what the woman next to me had and whether or not it was contagious.  

At about 2:30 the doctor comes back in with a nurse and I'm wondering if he brought her because he had to tell me I had 2 hours to live and would need consolation (then I remembered that all male doctors need to be accompanied by a female nurse for safety . . . or male ego stroking, I'm not sure which it is in France) He informed me of my ailment, at which point we all rolled our eyes like 'Duh, we all know what I had the second I handed them the cup' then he gave me a prescription that I could get in the morning and told me to go away.  At this point I was in shock because the whole reason I had come in was to get medicine NOW.  I hurt right NOW!  I asked him where the twenty-four hour pharmacy was.  The DOCTOR didn't KNOW.  After ten minutes I convinced him that waiting until the Pharmacies decided to open was not an option, and he gave me my first dose of whatever it was before I left.  

So, 2:30 in the morning and I'm feeling slightly dizzy and alert with the medication they gave me and I decide that it would be a good idea to walk home . . . not one of my better decisions, but to be fair I really didn't live that far away.  So I just march right out the door and into the night and walked for a while and then realized I had no idea where I was or how to get back.  I didn't know it was so late either, but it wouldn't have really made a difference.  So I saw a hotel and decided to call a taxi to the hotel and wait for it in the lobby.  The outer door to the hotel was open, but the inner door to the lobby was locked, so I just stood in the little glass entranceway and searched through my phone for the taxi's number.  I dialed it and suddenly I hear a very confused 'Hello?' on the other end.  It didn't sound like a French taxi driver, in fact it sounded like an English voice.  'Hello? Erin?'  Aaaah! whoever it is knows my name!  Oh wait . . . 'Is this Jonathan?'  Of course it was Jonathan.  Of course I had woken him up at an ungodly hour of the morning.  Why not, let's add horrible embarrassement to everything else.  So I apologized profusely and then hung up, at which point my phone wheezed out it's last breath of power and then died.  Yes, no surprise there.  I knocked on the door of the hotel and mercifully an entourage of night staff opened it and agreed to call me a taxi, if only to get me to stop apologizing loudly into my phone in their entranceway at 2:30 in the morning.  Somehow my phone miraculously came back to life when my mother called after the cab ride, which proves my selective-dead-battery theory and also my France-thinks-it's-funny-to-kick-me-when-I'm-down theory.  Turned out I had been walking directly behind my dorm building, but one street over . . . yeah. 

 So in the end I didn't die and I passed the ultimate language test.  If, while wearing a backless paper moo-moo, you can impart your ailment successfully to a doctor of the opposite sex and their grinning nurse in a room with a dying woman at 2 in the morning, then I think it is safe to say that you have some control over a language. . . .and I never want to take the test again."

"event","Okay, so for the past week it has become apparent to me that there is some sort of club forming around me.  If I had to guess at the name I'd say . . .The Bother-that-American-chick fan club.  All these guys are suddenly walking up to me randomly at the store and on the street and in the dorms and pointing out to me that I always eat lunch alone.  At this point I wanted to name their club the Pointing-out-the-obvious club, but it seems to go a little beyond that, because then they all offer to eat lunch with me so I wont face the terror of creamed spinach and kidney on my own.  According to them they arre all worried for my welfare because . . . well I'm a little shady on the details but I think I walk around looking unhappy all the time.  This is easily understood as stoopid people will often confuse looks of concentration and deep thought as unhappy, but it gets a little tiresome to keep assuring everyone I pass that I don't need them to save me from myself.  In fact they would be much more useful if they could save me from THEMselves.  I'm actually usually in a stellar mood, but I get lost in my thoughts and don't pay attention to anything so people think I'm broody.  Whatever, it wasn't that bad until they started going out of their way to run into me.  I walked by the front of the CROUS building yesterday and saw one of them coming out looking at me, but I went around through the gate to the back of the building to get to my room and suddenly the same guys was walking out the back doors trying to say Hi to me.  Then at lunch the other day one of them sat at my table a little way down but I was ignoring him and listening to music.  It's just this group of 6 or 7 guys and it's kinda weird.  I don't get it, but I figure they'll get the hint eventually.  Anyhoo, creepy French aside . . .oh I guess that was it, nevermind."

"event","The student strike appears to be over . . . sort of.  On Tuesday some people decided to do their strike activites in a classroom manner, that is they all got together in the lecture hall and discussed whatever it is they are protesting.  And some of the teachers will spontaneously show up and grab kids out of the halls to lecture at.  It's kind of a weird limbo period where no one is quite sure how to reinitiate class for EVERYONE because no one knows where EVERYONE is.  But I had a laugh when I took a picture of one of their recruiting posters featuring Uncle Sam.  It's weird because the very symbol of liberty and freedom, which is first and foremost in the mind of every American and American-wanna-be, is our very own French-born Lady Liberty.  Yet in France the symbol of oppression or conscription or whatever (anything bad, really) is America's Uncle Sam.  I just thought that was a fun thought to break the mold with since I'm usually complaining about the French.  I wanted to show you that I have indifferent opinions too. 

Oh! And yesterday I was walking through the park when I saw a man who was truly in love with his job and it made me feel good.  It was also awesome to watch him work because he was a dog poop cleaner, believe it or not, but the amazing thing was HOW he was cleaning up all the dog poop in the dog park.  He was wearing the customary neon green jumpsuit with reflector stripes and he was sitting astride a motorcycle with a vacuum built into it.  His mandatory witch's broom was strapped across his back like a rifle and he was tearing through the park on his motorcycle with the vacuum tube in his hand sucking up dog poop as he passed it at forty miles an hour.  The best part was that he never missed and he was whooping and hollering as he did it, much to the chagrin of the rest of the French.  It was awesome and almost made me wanna take up dog poop duty.  Almost.  It's little things like that that remind me why I don't go live on the top of a mountian as a hermit for the rest of my life.  People are as entertaining as they are stupid and infuriating."

I did have a weird dream last night though, which I really don't remember much of.  All I know is Ethan was in the front seat of the car and Isaac was driving and I was in the back and we were apparently driving really fast across the ocean (yes the ocean)and Ethan was holding Devin outside the window and dunking her in the water and then pulling her out and laughing because she was too wet to scramble back in the car.  For some reason I thought that this was completely plausible and normal and did not object until an octopus jumped up and grabbed Ethan and yanked him out the window.  Isaac then let go of the wheel to grab him and I was rather perturbed at this for some reason so I leaned over the back seat and took the steering wheel and kicked Isaac out.  I don't know what happened next because I woke myself up when I shouted 'Oh, for God's sake' really loudly.  I really shouted too.

"event","Hello all!  This is the first time in weeks I've been able to get to the computers because of the mass student orgies going in the hallways Woodstock-style. (that may be a bit of exaggeration)  The hallways are packed with old desks and camping stuff and students are smoking and drinking and cooking in the classrooms and generally just LIVING at the school (NOT an exaggeration), which actually would not have stopped me from using the computers because I am a student and can do whatever I want now.  No, the problem is that all the teachers have vacated the buildings for the past few weeks so whenever I DID go in none of the computers were working.  I don't know why they are working today because none of the teachers are here.  It's one of the mysteries of France.  One of the MANY mysteries.  Things here have been general chaos and since the students aren't going to class they are now taking over the city and oozing out of every McDonald's and cafe around.  I really hate it because I don't like students at the BEST of times and this has got to be the WORST time I've ever seen.  I went to the mall to check out the movie scene (since my student card now gets me in for three bucks) and I noticed that there was an underlying tension to the usual 'I don't give a merde!' French attitude.  Everyone was afraid of student riots while at the same time pretending not to notice or care that the students were hanging around everywhere.  This was puctuated by the squadrons of cops patrolling the mall with their machine guns at the ready.  The funny part about that was that even the COPS had that 'we don't actually care' attitude.  I only just got back home in time to miss this massive parade of 6000 students marching down the streets; but I heard the chanting and then several sirens from my room, in which I stayed cloistered for the rest of the day.  I'm not a big 'crowd' person, so unruly mobs don't rate high on my list.  However, amazingly and in the French manner I have somehow come through without the student strike affecting me at all personally, but am now more than ever convinced that everything in France that inconveniences me is being diliberately done TO me BY the French.  Yes, even the students wanting better jobs is just a tool that France uses to make MY day a little less pleasant.  

. . .I would also like to point out that I am not in the LEAST egocentric and think of nothing but other people all day long, and what they are doing TO ME. *smirk*  I need to get out of the house more."

"event","Okay okay, So I just got back from the most amazing week ever in Paris with Amy.  (The Mont Saint Michel owned my soul!) Paris, the city which I despise, is delightfully tolerable when accompanied by someone else, but the second Amy left I got all moody and pissed off at the world and sulked in the train station for two hours, nearly biting the head off a bum who sat down next to me to beg for a cup of coffee.  I very rudely told him exactly where he could stick his coffee, and then informed him of all the horrible things I would do to him if he didn't immediately vacate my peripheral vision.  Perhaps I was a bit harsh, but I wasn't in the mood for explaining that I had no more cash on me, so sorry, why don't you try hitting up that RICH guy sitting over there in his Armani suit!  I think I scared him.  BUT, luckily I'm slightly insane and am now in a wonderful mood today because I got a rude awakening this morning which amused me greatly.  There it was, 9 AM and I'm sleeping when suddenly there is a loud knock on my door.  I'm not sure if it really was a knock so I roll over.  Then someone BANGS on the door with their fist and I jump out of bed and tell them I'm coming.  As I'm making my way over I hear the door being unlocked from the other side and I shout very testily that I'M COMING, DON'T GET YOUR PANTIES IN A TWIST!  I open the door and am not wearing my glasses and am still groggy from sleep and don't know what to expect when suddely a large blurry man pushes past me into the room while asking if he can come in and have a word.  He is followed into the room by a small blurry woman clutching a pile of papers to her chest.  I'm tired and confused so i just sit down and wait for an explanation.  Apparently I had forgotten to pay the rent and they had sent out the French equivalent of Guido to extract it from me.  As soon as I understood what they wanted (he asked me if I was aware that the dorms weren't free)  told them to get out because I had every intention of paying them this morning AFTER I had gotten dressed.  They then apologized profusely for some reason and the door hit them on the way out.  I have since been in a marvelous mood.  I dunno why.  Oh, and in case you were wondering I DID pay my bill this morning."

"event","Okay okay, so last night I forced myself to go eat dinner because I had forgotten to eat anything all day because I was busy packing and junk, so I get down to the cafeteria and they slap the very dregs of the food onto a plate and I sit down and begin eating it.  The first item was milky, watery spinach moosh and there was a GIANT glop of it consuming the plate.  It reminded me of Calvin and Hobbes when Calvin is pretending to be attacked by his disgusting dinner.  I managed three bites of it, but it was SO salty and SO milky that I finally had to stop before I was sick all over the table.  I then noticed a funny smell that reminded me of my Anatomy class when we went to the cadaver lab (I kid you not, that IS what I was thinking of).  I turned to the pile of meat drenched in some red sauce of unknown origin and, assuming it to be the usual turkey, I took and large chunk and ate it.  It was indescribable, but ofcourse I shall describe it to you anyway.  It was harder and chewier than any meat I have ever tasted and resembled stewed sponge.  The taste smacked of copper, like I was sucking on a penny.  So I guess in essence I felt like I was eating a stewed sponge/copper brillo pad hybrid.  I managed to choke it down and then I unsauced a piece of meat to look at it.  It was liver.  I just KNOW it was liver, and I know what I'm talking about because I've seen my share of livers.  It was exactly the same but with more onions.  Well it was at this point that I linked up the previous smell with the current aftertaste and nearly yawned in technicolor all over the table, but I retained my dignity by running away up to my room, taking only the yogurt off my tray.  I was about to hate the cafeteria cooks forever but they redeemed themselves today by feeding me Greek something-or-other-that-isn't-liver.  *shudders*"

"event","Okay, so as of yesterday I am totally convinced that the world is coming to an end, and I will give you a detailed list of the reasons why that you have to believe because I am totally not making this stuff up.

     So I was walking home from school yesterday and suddenly these two old ladies dressed in 40's clothing walk up to me and started talking to me in french.
Lady: ""Are you a student?""
Me: ""um, yeah""
Lady: ""Oh good! Me and my friend were just walking all around this building to see what it was and there aren't any signs or anything! Do you know what it is?""
Me: ""Buh . . .I'm not exactly sure.  I think it's some kind of art school.  L'Ecole des Beaux Arts or something like that.""
Lady: ""Oh!  That's funny 'cuz it's ATROCIOUS to look at, isn't it!
Me: ""heh, yeah""
Lady: ""You're foreign, aren't you?""
Me: *here we go* ""yeah""
Lady: *slightly suspicious* ""What are you? English? *dripping with disdain* German? *absolute loathing*
Me: *not thinking* ""Yeah, english.
Lady: ""Ah, I see""  (Then she gave me this horrible pitying look as though I were a dying, like I had some horrible disease that made me ENGLISH.  Then I corrected myself)
Me: ""Oh, well actually American;""
Lady: *face brightens* ""Ah, you hear that Brigitte? She's Americain!  That's a lot better!  We shall have to be nice to her now!""
I just standing there trying not to laugh at these insane ladies who then bade me goodbye.  Now here's where the creepy part comes in, I started walking away and turned back around to look at them and they weren't there! *cue the creepy bull fiddle music*

    Then a little later I went back to school to use the computer lab and there was no one in the street.  No pedestrians and no cars.  All I could hear was the wind and the distant traffic on the highway.  I got all the way to school without seeing a single person and then when I walked into the school itself it was deserted too.  The silence was deafening.  It was really creepy.  But nothing was really sinking it yet because people in Clermont do tend to just disappear somethimes and I don't know where they go to.  The thing that really struck me was when I got to the computer lab and it was empty.  Every computer was vacant and that is when I started to get really scared because I never get a computer without waiting for forty minutes first.  I wondered if maybe a fire alarm had been pulled but there was no sound and the French don't evacuate when the alarm goes off anyway.  I looked out the window and there was no one on the campus grounds either.  A million things went through my head. Gas leak? Bomb scare? Unnofficial holiday? National Scare-the-snot-out-of-Americans Day? Invisibility Cloak give-away day? Time warp? I'm dead? They're dead? There's a glitch in the Martix? A spot on my contact lenses that coincidentally covers a person everytime they walk in my line of sight?  I'm insane?  Shaun of the Dead?  Should I find a bar to hide out in?  Should I go check the boiler room just so I can die and keep the plot serious?  I wonder what's for dinner? Oh no!  It's the end of the world!  The world ended without me and now I'm stuck here all by myself!  Panicked, I ran out of the room and out into the street and finally there were cars and people (though not very many of either) and I felt okay again.  The world may be ending, but at least it wasn't ending without ME.  So I started walking home and suddenly I noticed that it was a sparklingly brilliant sunny day, and the reason for that was that there was bright sunshine, not a cloud in the sky, and it was snowing. . . I was now more convinced than ever that the world was about to end and I started running home as the snow fell heavier and heavier and the wind whipped up and it turned into a bright sunny blizzard.  I couldn't hardly see because the sun was so blinding as reflected by the billions of giant white snowflakes.  So I finally got to my room and slammed the door and sat down and I wasn't really purturbed about the world actually ending, but I was petrified of it ending while I was in FRANCE.  The mantra I had chanted to myself as I ran up the stairs was, ""Idon'twannadieinFRANCE!Idon'twannadieinFRANCE!Idon'twannadieinFRANCE!""  Then I was sitting there in my room on the floor, minding my own business reading when suddenly a penny that has sat on the floor in the corner for weeks launches itself at my head.  I didn't actually see it happen, so I don't know if it was really aiming for my head, but it hit me in the leg anyway.   . . . It scared the snot out of me, but I figured if the world was about to end then ghosts weren't really that big a deal anymore so I ignored it and continued reading.  I have suspected for some time that there was a ghost or something in my building anyway.

       So finally things calmed down and I saw the clouds appear in the sky so that it was no longer doomsday snow, it was just regular old pain-in-the-butt snow.  Then I rearranged my furniture (because they had it arranged retardedly and this was the first time it occurred to me to move it)  And so I was feeling pretty good when I woke up this morning until suddenly I heard what sounds like air raid sirens going all over the city. And even all the church bells (and there are a LOT of them) were going off and the looming end of the world drew near again.  But I looked out on the street and none of the FRENCH seemed to be perturbed, so I relaxed, though I know full well that they would probably only bother worrying AFTER a bomb hit.  And even then they would probably be complaining about the inconvenience of it all.  Any way, remember that if the world ends tomorrow you heard it from me first.  

    Is is wrong to like being slightly insane?  It was put to me the other day to come up with a motto for my life and I had settled on, ""When God gives me lemons I feel like making milkshakes""  I liked that:)"

"event","I almost died laughing on my way to school today, because on the sidewalk there was a pigeon all fluffed up and laying on the sidewalk sleeping with his little head resting on someone's front step.  He looked just like a little bum!  That should not have been funny for several reasons, but then he turned and looked up at me as I walked by with such indifference that I could swear that I believed in reincarnated street bums.  My insanity aside, I woke up with a mysterious cut on my finger, and I can't for the life of my think how I got it.  It looks like I nicked my knuckle with a razor or something, (and it hurts like a monkey!) but it wasn't there when I went to bed and there was nothing in my bed when I got up that could have done it.  This immediately made me think of Gulliver's Travels where Gulliver gets drugged everynight and wakes up with a new cut on his finger every morning.  But that just creeped me out so I stopped thinking about it.   
 . . . I didn't actually put my insanity aside at all for that, did I.  Oh well, life's more fun when you look at it through a funhouse mirror."

Is that so much to ask?  Well apparently it is, so I'll just have to suck it up and take it.  The winter here is pathetic and it's getting me down, because it's not consistenly nice enough to go out hiking around, but it's not the kind of weather that makes you like staying indoors either.  So now I'm going stir-crazy in my room and I feel miserable and wet when I go outside.  I hate this country.  Plus someone left me a hate message on my art page because I didn't give credit for a picture I sorta copied from a revered internet artist.  It totally killed the happy mood that I was building up by reading all my emails.  I didn't really think it was that big a deal because I don't make money off my art anyway, and it wasn't even my best piece AND I forgot I even copied it at all, but I put the artist's name on it and refrained from saying all sorts of nasty things to the girl who yelled at me for not doing it in the first place.  But it's okay now because Amy will be coming soon and we can bop around Paris and hate the French together.  Hate is always more fun in a group."

"event","So not a lot happened over the weekend . . . okay so lots of stuff happened but most of it was good so there isn't a lot to talk about . . . isn't that sad?!  Oh, but I did run into the english speaking gang and got invited to a tea house with the BEST TEA I HAVE EVER TASTED!!!!  Then we went to the short film festival and it was awesome!  Okay THIS will take explaining.  For the next few weeks is the annual Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival (whose name I won't bother to tell you cuz it's in French) and all over the city at all these different theatres and arenas and stuff you can go see all these short films and you just get a ticket for a two-hour set of films and, yeah it's awesome!! (I got made fun of for saying 'awesome' yesterday) Of the ones I saw some were serious (which i didn't like as much) and the rest were just bizarre.  The most bizarre one was this social worker in Glasgow who was checking out people's homes because they smelled funny and you got the impression he was checking for bodies or murder or, i dunno, some kind of crime.  The whole thing was really creepy, and then the last house he goes into has a REALLY bad smell and the guy who lives there is scary, and while the social worker is poking around the house the scary guy picks up a . . . something to stab him with.  The whole time you can kind of hear a baby crying in the background.  The social worker is about to leave when he sees (dramatic BUH BUH BUH music) the last door he didn't see before and he walks in and there is a horrific look on his face and the scary guy attacks him but gets overpowered, then you see what's in the room.  At this point we were expecting dead babies, or slave women or SOMETHING like that, and it turns out to be a dead donkey on a mattress.  Then the donkey gets up because he isn't actually dead and the scary guy goes all soft and starts petting it and talking to it.  You find out it is an old donkey who can't live out in the cold in the winter and we were all filled with such relief I forgot most of what happened afterwards.  But I know the last thing you see is the social worker walking down the street leading the donkey behind him with a WTF look on his face.  
But my favorite is one that I never even saw, but it was described to me in great detail and I will try to do it justice.  It starts out in a neighborhood and there are all these mothers and children out in the yards talking and suddenly you hear this music start up and they all start saying about how they really ought to put a stop to this and call the cops.  Then your hear the singing start and the husbands all come out of the houses and start taking their jackets and ties off and the women are holding them back and trying to re-dress them.  The song is sung by a chorus of men and with every new line they go up a note and add another singer.  The lyrics are, ""One naked man, two naked men, three naked men, . . . and on and on up to nine, then they keep singing ""nine naked men"" over and over again and you see nine naked men marching down the street to the music.  The postman tries to resist, but finally he strips down and joins the line of men who hit the crescendo and sing ""TEN NAKED MEN!""  the end.  I wish I had seen it cuz it sounds absolutely hilarious.  Buh . . . apparently I have digressed from an actual post to ""ten naked men"" so this seems like a good place to stop."

"event","Well, I realized that I sounded like an old woman in my last post, so I decided to make up for it by actually going to that 'Robert Burns Poetry Night' with those Scottish girls. (It was on my floor anyway) and it ROCKED!!!!  Robert Burns did a poem to haggis apparently, so they parade the haggis into the room by bagpipe music, then they hostess recites the poem while stabbing the haggis to death with a knife . . . which really seemed to be more detrimental to the haggis rather than honoring, but whatever.  Then we toasted the haggis with Scotch (duh) which tastes like battery acid and feels like fire.  It was kind of the most awesome thing ever.  Then we actually had to EAT the haggis and it was the best thing I had tasted in a long time.  Me and the other two Americans were absolutely confused and almost horrified that we liked it so much, considering how bad it is supposed to be.  Then after food one of the guys does a 'Toast to the Lassies' where he's supposed to kind of poke fun at all the girls at the party, then we toast the lassies.  Kevin (the Texan) got to do the toast and he had this really great and heartwarming speech going and one of the girls was practically in tears cuz it was so sweet, then Kevin got to the part that explained he was talking about all of the dogs who had BEEN Lassie in the show, and that they had ALL been BOYS because boys are obviously way better and yadda yadda.  We died laughing and toasted, then one of the girls had to respond, but before anyone could think of anything to say, the girl who had been the most 'touched' by the speech piped up and said, ""Lassie may have been smart, but it was TIMMY who fell down the well!""  It was the best thing ever, and I felt really bad for the one French girl who was there because she had NO idea who Lassie was.  So yeah, good party, had haggis and scotch, things have come down to a nice balance of good and evil."

I cannot even fathom such a thing as leaving this wretched stink hole *thinks of the septic tank that leaked into the street yesterday* so I have forgotten my actual date of departure.

2. This is the most urgent topic of discussion at the moment and I'm afraid it will turn into a rant very quickly.  An unknown higher power has decided that the French weren't making my life nearly as much of a living hell as they ought, so he has now added The Italians and Smokers to my hit list!  As far as smokers go, to all of you out there who smoke, whether I know you or not, I don't care if we've never even been on the same continent, F*** YOU!!!!!!!!!!!  Especially those of you smokers who happen to be Italian and living on my floor (or in some cases, just showing up because you're Italian) where you then proceed to stand in the hallway screeching at each other in Italian at the top of your voices at 2 in the morning while smoking a bazillion cigarettes!!!  Now I know what you guys are thinking, 'so what, they were having a party in the hallway, just ignore them.'  Well I could have done, but unfortunately the kitchen is right across from my room so last night for about six straight hours there were 27 loud, obnoxious, drunk Italians standing right outside my room and even leaning ON MY DOOR while smoking!!!!!  I was pacing around in my room like a caged animal trying desperately to find reasons for why I SHOULDN'T just walk out there and throw them all through the kitchen window!!!  Not even the prospect of going to jail could curb my blood lust until I realized that I would be in a FRENCH prison FOREVER!!!!!  Then this morning three of them were going at it again at around 8 o clock right outside my door, but this time they were screaming at the cleaning lady, who had blamed them for the 400 cigarette butts that were now piled up against my door!!  Luckily I found THIS conversation very amusing because it was in French so I understood it.  Basically someone else who lived on the floor had fingered a girl named Francesca as the main culprit who let all those people in, and the cleaning lady accused her, then Francesca went all Italian on her and started schreeching uncontrollably about how unfair it was for people to be blaming her for everything that had happened.  Then the cleaning lady said fine, she believed her, but Francesca would not be silenced and kept going on and on about the injustice of someone blaming her.  The cleaning lady basically told her to shut up and calm down three times and everytime Francesca would start the whole speech over again and would get louder and louder, EVEN THOUGH THE CLEANING LADY HAD SAID IT WAS OKAY!!  What the hell is WRONG with people!?   . . . you know what it is, I think it's me.  The only common factor between all the stupid crap that has happened to me was me.  Me, and France.  So which gets the blame?  I don't know.  All I know is that I have been in the best mood ever all week long and then suddenly it was smote in the least subtle of ways by forces unknown.  The forces of FRANCE *says it with utter loathing*! So I have been in a powerfully terrible mood all day and have been snapping at any innocent person who dares to ask me why I look like I just sucked a lemon!  . . . in other news . . .

3. Annika has now reappeared, sort of.  She left me a text message that she had been ditching classes to go skiing and that she'd be back soon, so awesome.

4. Here is my twenty second bask in the glow of someone who is already basking in someone ELSE's glow of fame.  (yeah, that made sense)  I ran into Kevin at the cafeteria the other night and he made me sit down and he introduced me to all his friends and one of them happens to be a girl from Scotland by the name of Emily Scrimgoeur (spelling?)  You guys are all like, yeah so what, but her mother was in a writing class with JK Rowling right about the time she started doing the Harry Potters, and there just so happens to be a character in the . . . sixth book? by the name of Rufus Scrimgoeur.  If you haven't made the connection then I'm not going to explain it further.  But yeah, I met her and she even invited me to her Scottish poet celebration thing tomorrow night.  Don't think I'll go though, cuz there will be drinking and as has already been established I am not fond of inebriated company.

There, NOW I'm gonna try to catch a movie and lift my spirits.  Oh, that reminds me, that Acid pooping space turkey thing was in reference to a movie I saw last week.  It was a movie of French origins and I had seen a trailer for it at the beginning of January.  It's called A Ticket to Space, and the trailer at first suggested that it was a family drama like Apollo 13, then it decided it was a threat to the world like Armageddon, THEN it decided it was a monster in space movie like Alien.  Well OFCOURSE I wanted to see it.  So I get in the theatre and the movie starts with a SHEEP flying a helicopter for the chief whoosies of some government thing.  This is when I realized exactly what I had gotten into.  The plot progressed in a Mel Brooks like fashion setting up the love story, the father-having-to-impress-his-son story, and the villian-infiltrates-his-way-onto-the-space-station story.  Then we get to space and the bad guy takes over the ship and says he'll crash it into earth unless they release his homocidal brother from prison.  So they release the brother, who then gets killed by a bag of flaming rocks that was flung by a medieval catapult from a movie set two streets away.  So the good guys have to travel back in time naked (well ofcourse they were naked, have you forgottn where I am?) Yadda yadda yadda the bad guy steals the good guy's woman then dumps her and she becames a woman scorned and jetisons him into space THEN a turkey that they brought into space with them eats some hormone pills and turns into the Giant, Acid-pooping, Space turkey, and they jettison HIM as well.  And I died laughing the entire time.  It was the dumbest movie I have ever seen but certainly not the worst.  (the worst movie I ever saw was last summer when a bunch of second rate actors got together and tried to make a movie out of the short story I LOVE about the butterfly affect by . . .Ray Bradbury? it was made in all earnesty and it was TERRIBLE)  Anyhoo, Leaving now.  Y'all have fun in the land of the free."

"event","So last week I got so stressed out and messed up from the time change and just France in general that I have since fallen ill and went to the doctor where you have to pee in a cup no matter what your illness.  I laughed out loud at the doctor though, because she said that I was perfectly healthy except that I was too fat and that I should stop eating fries and drinking sodas.  Those were her exact words (only they were in French when she said them) and she thinks I'm crazy now because I was laughing so hard at her.  I just found her bluntness terribly amusing. 
Anywho, now that things have calmed down after . . . all that other stuff, I'm lonely and bored because none of my friends have showed up for class.  Oh, except yesterday Jonathan was there and we hung out after class.  It was awsome because he wanted to go check out the sports center and the stadium and we got there but we couldn't see the tennis courts from where we were so I decided to be very French and just open the gate and walk in.  But when I opened the gate the alarm went off so we ran like the dickens.  Then we realized it had been the bell from the school next door and Jonathan had the gaule to laugh at me even though he had been running just as fast.  So I suppose yesterday wasn't so bad.  But I now have several matching sets of brite yellow underwear and socks because something leaked yellow in the wash.  The best part is that I don't own anything yellow (or at least I didn't before) so I have no idea what it was that leaked.  

Okay, I'm starving now so I'm leaving.  (By the way John, I HAVE eaten at the Quick burger restaurant, but only once because yes, it was that bad.  I just didn't realize it was the quick burger because it's actually called the Quick Quality Burger Restaurant.  Ew.)

Oh yeah, and Happy Birthday John!  Tell Mom to go get out the goony present I left for you.  She should know where it is."

"event","So I am back in France now *bad taste in mouth* and I didn't manage to do ANY of the things I said I would, but it didn't matter at the time because I was wallowing in Americana.  In retrospect I should NOT have done that because now France is that much worse.  But the good news is it isn't my fault, nor is it necessarily the fault of the French (though I would LOVE to blame them for it).  Turns out that there is an Anti-Erin barrier all around the borders of France that senses when I've entered the country and makes everything go insane right before my eyes and now I have circumstantial evidence to proove it!  
      On my way back this time I had to go through England and I even had a seven hour layover that I spent rooting around the palace and watching the NewYear's Parade, which I stumbled right into the middle of.  It was wonderful and amazing and I loved it, EVEN in my sleep deprived state (I fell asleep on the subway).  I even called my mother to tell her that I seemed to have gotten the hang of traveling and that everything was coming up roses.  Then I got on my connecting flight and the women next to me were nice and happy and chugging champagne as fast as they could get it and things were going wonderfully . . . then we . . . crossed the border into France.  So begins the fun.
      It was at this point that all the champagne kicked in and the women became rather loud and boisterous, which was actually preferable to when they suddenly went silent and I glanced up to find them making out unabashedly right next to me.  Needless to say I spent a majority of the flight pretending to wait for the bathroom at the opposite end of the plane.  That should have been my first hint, but no, I still thought things were okay.  I got off the plane in Lyon into pouring rain and ran out to the buses, only to find that there was only one and it was full so I would have to wait twenty minutes in the rain for the next one.  Fine, okay, whatever.  The rain would keep me awake at least.  So the next bus came and I got on and it dropped me off at the train station, which was supposed to be near my hotel.  As the bus drives away I suddenly realize that I was the ONLY one who got off and now I was alone at a train station in Lyon at midnight.  I looked up and down the street to see if I recognized my hotel, which I didn't, so I asked the welcome desk in the train station which was mercifully open.  Turns out my hotel was on the exact opposite side of the station, so I dragged my giant suitcase and my heavy backback and forty ton laptop case outside and stared into . . . darkness.  all the street lights were out on that side because of construction.  I looked helplessly up and down the street and luckily looked directly across from me as well because that is where the hotel was.  It still took me twenty minutes to find it because it DID NOT look like the picture I had of it and the neon sign was missing some key identifying letters.  
       Now lets skip ahead to after I crash in the room and then miss breakfast in the morning.  I got my ticket to Clermont Ferrand and collapsed against a cement pillar with a bottle of water and a snickers that I had bought at the airport in England the day before.  I would have had something better but I hadn't been able to find an ATM so I had exactly 4 euros left that I was saving for the busride from the train station in Clermont Ferrand.  Hungry and sleep deprived, I stumbled out onto the platform and waited for the train with a few other people.  The train arrived and I chucked my stuff on and got into an empty car.  As the train pulled away I noticed that very few of the people had gotten on the train with me.  This didn't bother me until the train got out into the countryside and it . . . didn't really look right.  Everything was a little lusher and just  . . .different.  I didn't become worried until I saw snow.  Then I panicked because now I knew I was not on the right train.  By deduction I also figured out I was going in the OPPOSITE direction from Clermont Ferrand, which would soon land me in the Alps.  Great.  I contemplated getting off and switching trains but every stop we came too looked closed down and covered in grafitti, so I waited until I got to the end of the line where I knew the station would be big enough to be open.  When we stopped I quite literally THREW all my bags out onto the platform and all but kicked them into the terminal.  I bought a SECOND ticket to Clermont Ferrand and found an ATM so I decided to go to a little cafe in the terminal.  I sat down and demanded the steak and fries.  (that's how you order in France, you demand things, and actually the word for ""ask"" in French is ""demande"")  My steak came and it looked really good . . . then I cut into it and it bled all over and was virtually frozen on the inside.  I ate my fries and drank my coke and glared the waitress away to get the check when she tried to ask why I hadn't eaten the steak and why didn't I want coffee and dessert after.
       So I took the train BACK to Lyon and waited around for four hours for the train to Clermont Ferrand.  As the time to board was approaching I went to the platform (because I realized that I got on the wrong train because they switched platforms without telling me) so I wanted to make sure I waited till the last second, which was a mistake.  The only way to get to the platform was to take a single escalator which drops you at a dead-end billboard.  People inevitably get clogged at the top and at one point there was nowhere for anyone to go so they had to use the emergency stop on the escalator which, unlike a staircase, continues shoving people into a space whether there is room or not.  (It was actually kind of scary for a second and several babies in pumpkin seats got passed out to the crowd so that they wouldn't be crushed in the mad rush to get away from the escalator.  I ended up with one at one point) Then the French had the GAUL to change the platform for the Clermont train at the very last second so there was a mad rush to get to the other side of the platform which resulted in several elbows in my face and several hands clutching my arms to keep people from falling off.  When I finally got on the train all the sitting room was gone so I got to spend 3 hours riding standing up in the frigid baggage car.  I was so tired that I actually fell asleep like that, standing up in the frigid baggage car.  A nice old couple woke me up before my stop, where I again kicked all my luggage onto the platform, then kicked it down all the stairs that go under the platforms.  Unfortunately I had to carry them all back UP the next set of stairs to where the buses were because kicking UP doesn't really work.  Then I got on the bus and spent a very uneventful, but still rainy, bus trip to my residence hall.  
       I dragged all my luggage up the two flights of stairs to the welcome center, which is what I had been dreading since I had left America.  Right before leaving I discovered that the key to my dorm room was missing (I think it fell out of my suitcase in Paris *says with disdain* when that stupid cleaning lady robbed me) and now I had to ask THE FRENCH for another one.  I slumped up to the counter laden with baggage and they gave me that 'you are the biggest idiot I have ever seen' look and said that they didn't have any spares but they could unlock the door for me and I could just keep it unlocked until morning when the office would be open and then THEY could give me The Look too.  (You need the key to relock the doors from the inside too).  'Fine' I said.  Whatever, I really didn't care if my door was locked or not as long as I could sleep.  I was also looking forward to having help in getting up to my room in the fifth floor since it was dark, ten thirty at night, and raining, and I was absolutely EXHAUSTED!  'Go ahead to the Foyer, I'll be along in a minute.' said the French woman.  Okay, I thought to myself, I can get it up that far and tehn she'll help me.  So I dragged all my stuff out into the rain and up two more flights of stairs and then waited in the foyer as this woman took her sweet time getting there.  The whole time all I could think to myself was, ""She's gonna take the elevator!  She is going to take that ****ing service elevator and leave me to walk up the whole long way!""  Which is why I was surprised by what happened next.  I punched in the code and let her through the door and she came in and looked at me, then she said, ""Okay, I'll meet you up there.""  Then she walked through the service door and stepped into the ****ing elevator!  I stood there dumbfounded for a second, I hadn't actually expected her to leave me there with ALL my luggage!  So I gritted my teeth and put the backpack and the laptop case on my back and slid my arms through the straps of my two ton suitcase, lifting it up to my chest.  In this way I started climbing the five flights of stairs up to my floor, yelling and swearing in English the whole time, occasionally shouting down the hallways ""This is NOT my life!""  Around the third floor my arms completely gave out to exhaustion and couldn't physically hold the suitcase even if my life had depended on it, so I put it on it's wheels and yanked it up one stair at a time, making a loud bang with each step.  All the noise I was making roused some curious students from their rooms, but ofcourse they didn't help me, no, they just stared at me from they're doorways.  Although to be fair I was probably pretty fightening at that point.  So I finally get to the top and I compose myself so as not to collapse on the landing, and THAT WOMAN, that FRENCH woman HAS THE NERVE TO LOOK IMPATIENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then she looks at me as though she noticed the luggage for the first time and says 'oh, sorry' in a NOT VERY SORRY WAY AT ALL!!!!!  She opens the door and I kick the luggage past her into the room and she tells me to turn on the lights before I leave so I'll know if anyone is in there and to not tell anyone that it is unlocked because 'we care about you and don't want anything to happen to you' . . . . . . . .

 . . .*most incredulous jaw drop ever* . . . I was speachless until two minutes later when I shed everything down to my Tshirt and pants and went tearing back down all the stairs (now feeling amazingly light) and related everything back to my mother VERY LOUDLY while running six blocks in the freezing rain at ten at night to get food because the cafeteria was closed that night!  I think I frightened the girls working at the Crousti Pain  because I walked in screaming incredulously through the phone in English, stopped and calmly ordered dinner in French, then continued screaming through the phone in English while they prepared it.  I actually laughed out loud at the expression on the girl's face as she handed me my change and said in bewildered English ""Thank you.  Come again.""  as though she was worried that I might actually come up again.   

I am now out of breath . . . yeah, that's a worthy homecoming journal entry if ever I saw one."

"event",". . . the past few weeks were what is called 'radio silence' . . .which is bad . . . and I'm sorry but I refuse to wait for more than an hour for a computer just to tell you that French people suck!  But today I ditched class and got a computer right away so I decided to talk to you all again.  I can't remember where I left off, so let's go back to last weekend.  It was the first time I had ever gone somewhere WITH A FRIEND (I'm a rather pathetic creature), anyway I went to see Harry Potter with Annika, who is awesome, but unfortunately we had to see it in French because they weren't playing the English one at the time.  It was still amazing and we both cried like little girls at the end but we also killed the mood for all the French people in the audience because we snickered at all the words we didn't know.  If you want to learn a language via films I suggest you choose one based on reality because all the stuff in Harry Potter have weird names to begin with because JK Rowling was just stringing letters together, so in the French version they decide to call everything a different name because 'snitch' and 'Portkey' don't mean anything to a French person.  UNFORTUNATELY they use the same method as JK Rowling when renaming stuff and they just string letter together, but since it's french they make words that are 9 letters long but contain only 2 consonants so it's very difficult to understand what they are talking about.  Luckily (and unluckily) most of the important words were direct traslations so we knew what they meant.  I say 'unlucky' because no matter how much I hear French some of the words are just funny.  So when they said Death-Eater they actually said Mange-morts, because it was directly translated into French.  Written it's not that bad, but when they said it on screen it sounded like 'the Munch-mores' and inevitably Annika and I would snicker because all the people on screen were absolutely terrified of the 'Munch-mores' and then they couldn't STOP saying 'Munch-mores' and everytime it became the topic of conversation we had to bury our heads in our coats to keep from guffawing out loud.  But Munch-mores aside we had an awesome time at the movie and then we walked under the scary Cathedrale in the dark and ran into her friends and they all talked German to each other (of which I only ever caught the word for 'merde')and every minute or so Annika would turn to me and translate it into French for me, which I thought was hilarious, then we went to McDonalds but Annika was crushed because they didn't have any apple pie.  It was the best time I've had here so far, punctuated by the fact that I had to walk home alone in the dark, because she lives in a different dorm than me, which was kinda scary considering all the bridges I have to walk under . . .which now that I think on it is only one . . . whatever.  The thing that made THAT part great was that I didn't die.  Not dying has become my new focus in life.  

In other news, there is no other news because I have spent the last two weeks buying stuff at the Christmas market and preparing to return home and being very antsy about it and forgetting to eat at all yesterday because I was so worried my train ticket wouldn't be good or the worst possible thing ever that the plane would explode before I got there and they'd tell me I had to stay in PARIS *says with disdain* for the next few days.  At which point I would throw a hissy fit and probably kill several airport guards before being subdued and thrown in prison where I would sit there looking like Munch's 'The Scream' until someone came and rescued me from PARIS *says with loathing*

But yay for me I only have one more class and then I take the train on Saturday and the plane home on Sunday and then I get really excited about being home for the first week and then for the second week I will become horribly depressed because I will be thinking of where I will be returning.  Oh well, at least it won't be PARIS *says with utter loathing and contempt*  I'd love to keep chatting about stuff but I must go to the store and buy food before I die.  I have spent all week packing without realizing that I would need to WEAR all the clothes I already packed. So now I have all my outfits for the week lined up so they can then be washed and put back into the suitcase (which makes me look like a total pratt according to one of Annika's German friends who's name I can't spell).

I would also like Dad to know that I recieved what can only be described as a butt-load of postcards ranging in date from a few days ago to November.  Almost all of them arrived on the same day and I just laughed because it was like in Harry Potter when the house is full of letters only it was the floor littered with multicolored postcards that made the door hard to open.

Anyway, that's it before I leave, but be expecting a massive art dump when I get home.  I've got some great stuff!"

"event","So I just now tried to re-register for my place holder class at CSU, only to have the *edit* computer tell me that the class is full and I'm a loser.  When I tried again the computer told me that my mother was a hampster and my father smelt of elderberries.  On the thrid try the computer merely farted in my general direction.  This is . . .not a horrible thing because it happened last semester in much the same fashion but I have to wonder that if, when you stick the coding for this class into the website, you know that the class will automatically register as full, then why do you not automatically FIX IT!  I had to write an email to my oober retardo Study Abroad councellor, Mr. Kinnear. (no, his name is not Greg) Granted this guy is new, but when the senior teacher of the French department emails ME asking for advice on how to complete the paperwork for her students, you hafta wonder why this guy got hired.  This teacher's wording led me to believe that when she said ""Mr. Kinnear is rather vague on the details of getting a Visa and my students want your advice,"" what she actually meant was, ""That *edit* is still telling people to buy 300 dollar plane tickets to LA, and I'm about to kill him but I want your assurance that he's wrong before I jump him in the parking lot with a baguette.""  Needless to say, it was rather difficult for me to compose an email to him.  I had to refrain from writing:
     Dear Jack*edit*
   Your *edit* website is *edit* *edit* *edit* and I can't seem to get the *edit* schedule to *edit work!  Therefore I would like you to kindly remove your *edit* from your *edit* and make sure that the next time I try to *edit* edit* it will *edit* work!  Otherwise I will *edit* *edit* *edit* and tell you exactly where you can shove it too!
     Love, Erin

I mostly didn't write that because you can't understand what I want with all those ""edit""s in there.  Plus I didn't think he could understand words more than five letters long, so I resorted to this:

      Hey, fix the web site so I can keep going to school here.  Thank you (dripping with sarcasm)

I think I did better with that one.  Now all that's left is for him to email me back saying, ""I'm afraid you can't register from France so I'll need you to fly back to America and use my computer to do it, but my computer's broken so you'll get here and it won't work and you'll have to go back to France to do it anyway.""
 . . . I'm in a sour mood apparently . . . I'm not bitter . . .
 . . .  or salty (I couldn't resist using another 'taste' adjective)"

"event","Do my posts seem ridiculously long to anyone else?! 

Now, everyone tell me how depressingly wonderful your Thanksgiving was so I can have a good long sulk.  My Civ teacher actually wished me a ""Bon Thanksgiving"" today, then sounded confused as to why she did it.  The French don't seem to understand the concept of Thanksgiving, and while I was thinking how stupid they were it suddenly occurred to me that I didn't really understand it either, it was just something that always was.  In school they tell you it was to celebrate the first settlers in America, but somehow that seems, I dunno, not as big as it should be considering how big the holiday is now.  Although now that I think about it, some baby being born in a barn in the middle of a winter's night is a pretty humble beginning for a multi-billion dollar holiday franchise too.  All holidays aside, things here remain craptacular and uneventful, though I did see a shining beacon of hope today on my way to class.  I chose to walk by the University of ARCHITECTURE today, just by pure chance, and had a hard time finding it at first because the sign was covered.  What was it covered with, you ask?  Nothing other than the entire front wall of the building which had fallen over during the night.  HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!  I laughed out loud SO HARD that I fell over!  I love this country, because stupid crap happens to EVERYBODY, not just me!  If you'll excuse me, I've started laughing all over again and must leave to retain what little dignity I still possess."

"event","Okay, so I had a pretty good weekend, I went and saw Oliver Twist in French on Saturday.  I'm not sure if I liked it because it was really sad and I really like the musical one AND I only understood every 15th word they said, but visually I liked it.  Although I suppose the opening credits could have used a little jazzing up.  Then on SUNDAY I broke into the mall to go see Zorro.  Okay, that's going to need some explaining.  See, the Jaude theatre is INSIDE the mall, and on Saturday that's not a huge deal cuz the mall is open and the halls are full of embarrassed-looking men standing in front of lingerie stores waiting for their wives to come out.  No big deal, but when I went on Sunday all the stores in the mall were closed and only the theatre remained open, but they have those big gates closed at the end of every hallway so you can't get anywhere.  I didn't know the mall was closed, and I snuck in through a side door that happened to be propped open with a giant plastic Santa.  At the end of the hallway the gate wasn't shut all the way because they had been decorating the halls with giant stuffed penguins and junk like that, so I crawled underneath it (I suspected I wasn't supposed to be here at this point)  It was kinda cool to walk through and empty mall dressed in its winter wonderland stuff.  The next gate I came to was closed, but they don't lock, so I undid it and went through to the escalator, which was still moving.  I got up to the top and the theatre was open, but I don't know how NORMAL people get there.  
So anyway, I saw Zorro in French, and I was a little worried that Antonio Banderas would lose most of his charm when played by a french guy.  Turns out that, no, he is very much himself whether he speaks or not, but they almost managed to ruin Catherine Zeta Jones by giving her a high-pitched whiny French voice.  Luckily she pulled herself out of THAT one and was amazing anyway.  It was funny though, and I can only assume that the plot was absolute crap because I loved the movie even though I had no idea why the bad guy was so evil because I couldn't understand any of that part.  Something about nitro and soap and whine bottles and blowing up the entire Yankee army?  I dunno.  Really the plot is just lip service for those audience members who need a reason for the bad guy to be bad.  The rest of us know that the bad guy is only there so that Zorro can kick his but in amazing, acrobatic, and creative ways using various props and quippy remarks.  Anyway, I loved it and can't wait to see it in English.  ALL OF THAT came about because I was GOING to see Harry Potter, but it doesn't come out till next Wednesday, so me and Annika are going together next weekend cuz she wants to see it too, AND like me she would also prefer it in English with French subtitles, so hopefully they will bring that version to our little Backwater Capital of the Auvergne Valley.  And this is completely random and obscure, but I passed it on the street on my way over here so I have to ask you, did I already rant about the Taxi-Phone Cyber Cafe?  If not, I want everyone to make a list of the things that you think you'd find at such a business.  I haven't whined ranted about the French in a while and I'm getting rusty.  

The Last Mail Counter Ever:  I got a postcard from Dad, and yes I have eaten some ""fine french cuisine,"" but the food here is really heavy because we aren't past the oil barrier yet so not a whole lot.  I also got a letter from John containing: one hilarious comic about Jesus and Fridays (yes, I got it) and one note saying that my empty mail counter is both depressing and self inflicted since I write to you guys all the time via this thing so there is no need for you to write me letters, THEREFORE the mail counter will be no more, and if I get stuff, I'll tell you."

"event","I use this thing a lot . . .which makes sense considering how many hours I have to wait every day to use it.  So yesterday I got home and I had a mail summons on the floor.  It informed me that for some reason the lady at the welcome counter looked too shifty to entrust with my package, so they decided to keep it with THEM at the post office.  Okay, fine, good.  It then invited me to come and pick it up at my leisure . . . before nine AM the next morning, lest it be incinerated or whatever they do to punish you for not picking it up on time.  Fine, I got up early this morning anyway because apparently the people next door decided let matadors practice in their room at six in the morning.  Since I had never been to this post office before, I looked it up on the map and low and behold it was right behind all the student housing.  No big deal, right?  Heh, well it turns out that the road that you have to cross to get there has been completely blown to pieces by what could only have been a nuclear warhead, therefore I could walk up to the fence and see the wreckage and I could even see the post office from where I was, but it was physically impossible for me to get across the street.  So I took the nice 25 minute detour through the French ghetto, with it's armour plated bomb-shelter style shutters on every window and the lovely stench of turpentine and wet dog.  It was creepy and weird, not to mention zero degrees outside, so the walk was rather longer and more unpleasant than necessary.  Upon arriving at said post office the woman told me I was a day early and that they didn't have my package yet . . .at which point I was ready to go postal (inspired, of course, by the post office I was standing in) on her, but she suddenly remebered what day it was and said, ""oh yeah! it's right here!"" *reaches over to the ONLY package sitting on her desk*  Eager to open it, I ran back home through the ""ghetto"" (it's not really the ghetto, it just looked and smelled really nasty) when I remembered that I had talked to the lady at the welcome desk the day before.  I had asked about these loud firecracker noises I had been hearing late at night and asked who kept setting off the fireworks.  She gave me her best French ""you're stupid"" look and said ""they were gun shots"" . . .
   . . . needless to say I hurried even faster.  I got home and opened the package, which was from John, and there it was.  ""Spamelot"" the CD.  I nearly maimed my computer trying to get it in there and immediately listened to ""Always look on the bright side of life"" which was the only one I had time for because I had to go to class.  I put the CD in my portable CD player (duh) and got ALL the way down ALL the stairs when it suddenly died and Oscar-worthy death, shreiking like a woman in a horror film, battery acid oozing out theatrically.  (okay, not really, the batteries just died)  But I didn't have the time or energy to go pack up all the stairs so I went to class instead, thinking about the ghetto, gunshots, and the viscious chicken of Bristol.  It sucked butt.  On the upside though, I got two post cards from Dad.  I will be thinking of you on Turkey Day too.  I'm rather put out that the French don't celebrate our arrival in America.  (They're just jealous cuz we got there first)  I had something even more stupid and nonsensical to tell you but I seem to have forgotten it.

"event","So it was an incredibly long weekend because these French just keep piling on the holidays and telling us last minute so that I end up with no food on Friday because I hadn't gone to the store and all the stores and cafeterias were closed, but I ended up finishing Eldest (not easy) and it was actually a really nice weekend with the most awesome crappy weather ever.  Apparently there was some Carnival or other going on but it must have been well hidden because I didn't find it all weekend.  Yesterday I pestered Jonathan with scores of annoying questions one after another and then I waited in the computer lab for two hours before giving up. . . did you know that if there aren't any holiday celebrations you lose track of the time?  I have no idea how long I've been here, or what month it really is, because they don't celebrate Thanksgiving, so we're right into Christmas and it just doen't feel right.  Also, because this is a really random and haphazard post, we worked on our story today in class and Zofia, whom I found out today is Polish, suggested we have someone say ""May the Force be with you!""  Hilarious in it's own right, but I died laughing because she said it in English and everyone else in the class understood it and giggled.  Everyone but the teacher, that is, because apparently the French translate it into French before they say it.  But it was amusing none the less, so now our tiny, muscular, Spanish snail naked Antonio says ""may the Force be with you!""  I laughed more today, because Zofia asked me where in England I was from.  When I corrected her she said, ""oh, I couldn't tell because your american accent isn't very strong.""  I knew, of course, that she meant I didn't sound like a hick with three teeth, but I didn't say so out loud. I saw her point though.  The other day Jonathan heard Kevin, the other American in my class, reading out the answers to the homework with the most attrocious accent in the world.  Jonathan turned to me and said, ""Wow, you can really tell that guy is American by his accent.""  I didn't have the heart to tell Jonathan that HIS accent sounded like British upset stomach, and that I couldn't understand a thing he said to me in French.  It's kind of an unspoken rule in this little foreign world of ours that you don't address the sevarity of your classmates' accents, at least not to their faces.  It's just . . . bad form.

Mail Counter: none, but that's probably good because the Stewie Griffin thing I sent myself didn't have the room number on it so they yelled at me when I came down to get it.  *sheepish grin*"

"event","So I actually dragged my carcass out of bed at the crack of dawn this morning, just so I could run 30-odd blocks in the freezing rain (and the dark) to end up late for Civ class anyway. It was okay though, because the guys in my group were even later than me, so the teacher spent her whole time berating THEM.  They are actually pretty awesome though. We were supposed to be working on our project today but we don't actually have to present until after Christmas, so instead we started talking about other random crap.  They are both Chinese and upon seeing my lack of knowledge about China they proceeded to explain the Communist government to me.  It was actually really interesting and all in odd Franglais, because they too recognize more English words than French ones, so I got to learn about how dumb the government is, but how good communism is and how Hong Kong is Capitalist . . . we figured that if the Civ teacher wasn't going to teach us about civilization we might as well teach each other.  Apparently everyone in China likes big expensive cars (just like America) and Zheng told me he wants a Mercedes SUV.  Inevitably the subject of movies came about and I found out that Chinese people really like catastrophic movies, like Titanic and The Day After Tomorrow.  They also like SpiderMan (which they couldn't say and it took them several long minutes to get me to understand).  Zheng also told me he loves 24, especially the first season because he had the hots for Jack's wife.  I died laughing and the teacher came over and grilled us about our project for several painful minutes.  So it was that I spent the two and a half hours of French Civ class discussing Chinese civilization.  (oh, and how much the Japanese suck . . . apparently they aren't friends)  It was funny because Zheng is so excited about being Chinese that he can't even stand himself, and he would inevitably continue talking even when the teacher was trying to explain something.  The boy would not shut up.  Over all it has been a really good week in the social department, though the weather is crap because in the sunlight it's hot AND nippy at the same time, and in the shade it's below zero.  Whatever, the point is I love that none of the people I speak to are actually French. It's not the same as choosing people that speak English, I speak in French to everyone I know, so it's a surreal feeling to be in this place where no one belongs but everyone is.  The full weight of where I am hit me like a ton of bricks yesterday . . . I don't know if it was good or bad, it was just heavy.

"event","I had an amazing morning (amazing in the good way instead of the bad way this time).  For some reason I woke up at the crack of dawn to see the best sunset ever right outside my window.  Then I went to class where Annika, Zofia and myself all made fun of the teacher quietly while he taught us what and adverb was.  (He totally deserved the ribbing cuz he was being really mean to ZhiHeng, who had come in late and was constantly berated for it throughout the class;)  Then the three of us continued writing our story about Antonio the snail, occasionally bursting into peals of laughter, dusturbing everyone else in the class.  We won.  The beginning of OUR story was a whole page and everyone else's was a paragraph.  Unfortunately, the story is supposed to be a page total, so we actually lost, but we totally don't care cuz we're planning to illustrate the whole thing and publish it and become rich (yeah, like that's gonna happen).  After class I was talking to Annika and Harry Potter came up.  She asked me if it's really true that there are people in the US who banned the book because it's not appropriate for kids.  I said yes and she thinks we're weird.  It's fun to talk to her, but not very good for my French speaking skills, because we both speak Franglais, so we speak in flurried but atrocious french until we come to a word we don't know and use the Enlish word without slowing down.  Sometimes she uses German too.  It's kind of really awesome.  Anyway, I also wanted to inform all potential gift givers that I just bought The Stewie Griffin Story on DVD, so don't get me that.  I decided to indulge myself just this once.

"event","So a complete stranger started talking to me yesterday and when I said I didn't want to go out for a drink he said I had a cold heart and wondered if I was thinking of committing suicide . . .*looks nonplussed*  He then went all Lifetime channel on me and said that God put people on this earth to be together and live in peace and harmony and that if everyone just loved one another there would be no more war.  I was expecting him to break into song (Give Peace a Chance, Why can't we be Friends, ...etc)  I promptly ended the conversation and walked home in a daze, thinking that at any given moment someone would jump out in front of me and say, ""Smile! you're on candid camera!""  Also, before I got rid of him, he wanted to listen to my CD player because it was in English (he was from the Congo but his dream, as he so informed me, was to be able to speak english perfectly and maybe have a friend in America to visit *not subtle*) but I forgot which CD was in there and when he was done with the first track he asked me if it was a love song, because the lyrics were ""I love you baby . . .""  It was then that I realized that he had been listening to the first track of Tenacious D.  I didn't know what to say, so I said, ""Yes, it's a love song.  About love, love and nothing else.  A love of babies, yeah that's it, he likes kids.  Kids are awesome.  Look there's some kids over there!  Speaking of over there, I'm going to end this discussion now.""   . . . I think I handled it pretty well.  Overall the day was the weirdest one I've had to date, and I spent much of the night laughing at myself.  

In other, completely unrelated news, I had this odd sense of paranoia the other night.  Having just read a book featuring nasty faeries that lived in the city, I walked out into the hallway and noticed these faint circular patterns of muck on the floor.  Of course I assumed they were some sort of Faery magic designed to ensnare me and trap me in the hallway till the end of time, so I yelped and jumped over them, sprinting to the bathroom like there was no tomorrow. . . needless to say, there is a reason that everyone on my floor thinks I'm weird.  Foreign countries do strange things to your mind.

"event","So I have been rather forelorn lately because I thought I was getting fatter, with good reason.  All of my pants are way tighter than they usually are, but I was confused because I've been walking everywhere all the time and climbing all those stairs.  Then I put my shoes on and noticed they were also two inches shorter than they should have been . . . I shrank them *facepalm* All but two pairs of pants that I have now are high waters.  I felt retarded, but it was good news on the health front.  Plus I also found out why I seem more tired than everyone else who climbs all those stairs.  Apparently my backpack is ridiculously heavy, because when the security guard at the store took it to leave behind the counter he almost fell over when I tossed it into his hands.  Silly me.  He asked me if I was from America after that, which surprised me.  He informed me that most French girls would have broken in half, so he knew I wasn't local.  *laughs for no apparent reason*"

"event","Well, ""apparently"" fall is officially here because the ""apparently"" famous Auvergne wind has set in.  I,m not talking autumn breezes either.  These are honest-to-god gale force winds barreling down the tiny streets and alleys.  All of your clothes must be tight fitting and completely buttoned and zipped, unless of course you're in a hurry, then you unzip your jacket and get swept down the street at breakneck speed.  (It's usually good to make sure the wind is going the direction you need to go before doing this.) . . .that only works until you hit the intersections.  At the intersections all the winds combine to form a vortex of upward air, at which point every article of clothing you are wearing (and sometimes your backpack) get sucked UP.  This means you have to have registered whether or not your crosswalk man was green BEFORE you got to the intersection, because you cross the street with your shirt over your head and your pantlegs at crotch height.  Not only would you not SEE the car coming, but your pants would be so bunched up that you wouldn't be able to jump out of the way anyway.  So now at school my already Hermione-esque hair looks like a giant ball of blond fuzz.  Luckily I only have to cross two intersections to get to school because after about the forth one my hair has turned into a giant beehive dreadlock . . . it looks kinda like a lumpy Q-tip.  The most amazing thing about this wind is that it doesn't seem to affect everyone else the same way, because they all have nice, thin, slick hair that falls neatly back into place the second they enter a building.  Oh well, I already know that I can't pull off the same stuff as these other girls.  Especially this no smiling thing.  All the other girls manage to make it look like sultry indifference.  However, I have been informed that I either look chronically depressed all the time, or I look like I'll rip your arms off and stuff them up your nose if you look at me cock-eyed.  I had to laugh at this observation because I have actually had that feeling recently.  Anyway, to use the observer's term I look too ""jolly"" to not smile.  I guess I have to agree, I have thought that occasionally.  Anywho, must go to class now, I was caught off guard because there isn't anyone on campus and I had expected the lab to be full.

"event","So I've had these red bumps all over me all week and I just assumed I was getting hives from extreme amounts of stress or something, cuz lets face it there's a LOT of that running around over here.  Then yesterday I noticed that they all had little puncture marks in them . . .spider bites.  I'm in another freaking country and they STILL follow me!  So, arachnophobe that I am, I pulled apart the bed and washed everything without finding a single spider.  I put the bed bzck together and slept there anyway (because in a room that small it really doesn't matter WHERE you are, it's going to find you anyway.)  So this morning I get up and have five more big red welts going up my legs, only these ones are freaking huge!  They were two inches across, it looked like the spider had been sitting there pumping in venom with a hose and a tank or something!  They also itched like crazy, which wasn't helping the size at all.  (I ended up quenching the itchiness with 805 Honey Company Body butter, which worked better than anything I've ever used before, go figure)  Suddenly I saw a shadow under the bed and, stupid person that I am, I took the bait and crouched down with my face on the floor to see if it was the sock that I had lost last week.  I couldn't see that well but luckily I wasn't stupid enough to reach in there; I got a flashlight instead.  I turned it on and shined it on the biggest, blackest, hairiest spider I had ever seen!  Either terrified by the light or sadistic, the spider ran out from under the bed right at me, at which point I screamed and of course leaped onto the bed.  This spider was about as big as my palm and it scuttled around towards my pile of dirty clothes on the floor.  Well, I wasn't going to follow it in there so I scrambled to the door and, rather noisily, unlocked it and ran into the hallway.  My room is right across from the ""kitchen"" in which there happened to be some guy cooking breakfast.  He just stood there staring at me, stirring his oatmeal, until I grabbed him and handed him the dustpan, quickly explaining in French what it was he was now hunting.  He laughed at me until HE saw it too, then he killed it for me (he had to whack it six times before it stopped twitching, and even HE was jumping everytime it moved).  Needless to say I also made him check under the bed for others, but there was only a ginormous web, which we had the cleaning lady suck out with the vacuum.  . . . before you ask, mother, I took the carcass down to the clinic and asked if I would die from my 23 odd bites.  She said no, so I think I'll live.  Personally, I blame John for this scenario, that spider-loving jerk who sets them free all the time *shakes fist at no one in particular* . . . *notices others in computer room staring and stops shaking fist*  It was scary! *fake sobbing*  Whatever, the worst part is that everyone on my floor will now be smirking at me as they walk by, I just KNOW they will!  Have a good weekend everyone!  I know I will!  I'm going to see Zorro!

"event","Okay, I'm going to start off with the apparently necessary ""I'm not going to die"" speech, and remind everyone that even though I constantly say awful things that doesn't mean that is all that is happening to me.  It's just terribly boring for EVERYONE involved if I give you a play by play of: well, first I got up and had a piece of toast, then I brushed my teeth and enjoyed twenty mintues of Dexter's Lab in French and . . .geez, it's even boring to write.  So yeah, had a good weekend, had an even better day today because we have to write a story in Narration about princes and princesses and Annika and I are really going to embarress ourselves when we have to present it (we're both a little crazy and ended up with a weightlifting princess who eats escargots, one of which continued living in her stomach and now talks to her, his name is Antonio . . . he's Italien). . .ANY WHO I also wanted to impart to you how aggravating it is to be constantly getting hit on for various reasons.  Apparently a lot of the Morrocans are looking for a green card and a lot of the French guys are looking for so,ething else entirely.  It has gotten to the point where I don't even stop to see what people are trying to ask me anymore.  Unfortunately, these guys are more wiley than I thought and have discovered ways around that.  The other day, for example, I was walking down the street minding my own business when this group of guys started walking towards me.  The one closest to me was staring straight at me, very obviously trying to get my attention.  I was looking straight ahead and, very obviously, pretending not to see him.  Not to be discouraged, he jumped RIGHT in front of me.  For my part, I didn't want to bother encouraging this behavior by stopping, so without slowing down I shoved him out of the way and said, ""I don't care what you want, go away!""  I didn't dare turn around to look, but I knew he wasn't following me cuz his friends were laughing hysterically at him for being so forcefully rejected.  I have to admit I smiled the whole way home.  It got out some repressed aggression.  So I guess, constant annoyance that it is, I can handle it okay.  *laughs at self*  I'm dumb.  In other news, thanks for all the stuff Mom and John, it got here yesterday and I already finished one of the books.

Mail counter: One ginormously cumbersome and unnecessarily huge package from John.  The thing was in a giant sack so I looked like Santa lugging it up all those stairs, (yeah, that's right, I had to carry it up myself, even though the cleaning ladies would've gotten to use the service elevator)  On that note, try to keep the packages under twenty pounds people, I am NOT a pack mule.  Imagine yourself carrying it up seven flights of stairs, if you can't do it just assume I can't either."

Woke up feeling good, the weekend should be good and next week when classes start again I will feel crappy again.  It's a vicious cycle.  Also, here is a new addition to my posts, the Mail Counter.  It'll tell ya whose mail has arrived.

"event","Yes, the suckage continues, so much so that I forgot what Halloween was, inspite of the orange confetti that plagues the hallways now.  But I had a good long hissy-fit yesterday and now I feel . . . good is too strong a word . . .less miserable.  No wait, I actually feel amazing cuz Devin actually answered her phone yesterday.  The point is ""under the thumb of hardship will grow a stronger man""  . . . is that actually a quote or did I just make that up?  Well, I guess now that I've said it it's quotable. *chuckles to self*  But I don't wanna be a strong man . . . *chuckles to self again and imagines self returning home looking like Howard the Winking Lumberjack*  I suppose there are worse things to come back as.  

In other news, I found out that when I get mail the cleaning ladies will bring it up to my room for me! *rock on*  So here's my address for anybody who cares:

Erin Kalisek B521
25, Rue Etienne Dolet
63000 CLERMONT-FERRAND

So now you can send me Hogwarts toilet seats!
SIDE NOTE: Ho-chen, I have more awesome pictures of the puberty train!  Prepare yourself, cuz I'm storing up all the older sistering for when I come back for Christmas!"

"event","This semester is going to royally suck . . . as will next semester because I get the feeling that I will be repeating the same stuff over again.  In my French Civilization class the teacher doesn't actually do any of the teaching, all of the students do, so we had to pair off and I now get to explain agriculture in retardo French to a bunch of people who won't understand it anyway.  Plus I agreed to work with Zheng and Tao, who are both Asian AND male, so they're trying to complicate the hell out of this whole thing!  They seem worried that they won't be able to fill their ten minutes of presentation time, and I don't know how to tell them that they will spend most of their time explaining all the hard words to the rest of the class.  Whatever, the worst news is that our final depends on these presentations, because we walk in there and they ask us questions about all the subjects presented and we have to answer using all the vocab and junk that we just learned.  THEN, because that isn't awful enough, we go into another room where they pick one of the topics and give us fifteen minutes to think about it, THEN I have to go and talk about the subject for fifteen minutes in French. . . . I am going to DIE!!!!  I don't even mind presenting in agriculture, I can totally do that, but giving us fifteen minutes to prepare an equally long speech in another language . . .that's just mean.  I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT IN ENGLISH!  I have started thinking about irrational and increasingly creative ways to get permanently deported from this stupid country full of mean people.  I . . . can't even stand myself . . . it's like things only happen to me if they're comically inconvenient and/or tragically ironic.  Or just dumb, cuz I was stupid and thought it would be a good idea to leave the country and make fifteen minute speeches in French.  I'm out of words . . .I have no words.  *sighs*  John, not sure you should buy that return ticket yet.  I may be crashing and burning by then."

"event","First of all I would like to send a big YOU SUCK! to all the peeps i tried to call last night who didn't answer (which was everyone i tried to call)  I ended up paying 10 euros to talk to a bunch of voicemails.  On another topic, why didn't anyone (but Devin) tell me that the French sucked and that the Germans were awesome?!  If this was your idea of a joke, I ain't laughin'.  Plus, like everyone here is doing some kind of art thing.  Xieng wants to be an art teacher, Annika wants to be a history of art teacher . . .you know, I'm the only one doing actual art . . . and I'm also the only one here who isn't planning the French language into my career plans.  Go figure.  I'm like the woebegone loser no matter what country I'm in.  Ya know, if I'm gonna be a loser, I'd rather do it in my own language.  ""I HATE this planet!"" ( kudos to you if you can name that quote)  I know I'm punishing myself for something, (lets face it, i MUST be) but I can't for the life of me figure out what it was that I did.  I'll bet you Devin's right; I did something in a past life for which I now have this Dobby-like tendancy to punish myself and then not know why I did it.  I probably shot Lincoln or something.  Or maybe Ghandi (wait, did he get shot?).
     On to a new, but very much related topic, depression really does get the creative juices flowing.  I have been doodling non-stop since I got here, and some of it is actually good/funny.  I am very excited for Christmas so that I can post my GIANT LEGENDARY APES OF AMERICA series of drawings (the annotated version)!  I also have a comic started called, Erin in Douche-land.  It will aparently be my musings in this stupid country.  That one is in a very rough and not in a very aesthetically pleasing form, but whatever, I'm not redoing it now.  Buh . . . that's it I guess.  Still no mail recieved yet, but I don't want to give out my address until I KNOW that I can get the mail.  *runs home to see if the mail has come yet*"

"event","This is really just to test that this page actually works, but I'm doing okay so far.  I had horrible food poisoning on the day of the test so I had came to school today expecting that they would . . .I dunno, deport me or something and they just handed me a copy of the written test.  I'm not sure exactly how I did, but I think the consensus was that I write very well at level 3 (out of 4) and I speak like a retarded monkey hanging upside down in a goldfish bowl. . . I don't know where that puts me classwise.  Anywho I will have back entries as to my first days here for anyone who cares to know how delightfully messed up this place is.  I hope to get a video camera/photo camera digital thing *wink wink Santa* for christmas so that I can take pictures and movies to illustrate my point.  It would be so much more poignant that way.  Also, if you have questions about how to use this thing you can email me or preferably my friend Devin who would be more likely to answer you with the right answer.  Her email is desotomercury@yahoo.com

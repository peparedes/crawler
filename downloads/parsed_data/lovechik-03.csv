   First i am so happy cause it's a new year, and i have a great new job in my career... of massage therapy..
 I finally finished school and i am a free woman...until i go back to school next fall...
Second, I have learned so many things about the challenages in life and why it comes to you...and it has changed me alot.  I believe that i am a different person...not completely different but somewhat different...
I have lost a great deal in my life this past year....and it all started from june but...now i know things that i wish i could explain what happened but i would rather not say....it's kind of embrassesing(i dont know if spelled that right, i have a brain fart, lol) but lets just say that i wish i could keeps some things that i have lost and change the past, in some way, but then that wouldnt make me the person that i am today....:) and i am pretty happy about it...
lets just say that right now...many things are changing and i am happy(for that most part any way.)"

"event","As you guys know many people go out for the holiday. you know they go and see their family.  and all of that stuff but not me and my room mates we didnt do anything. because i had to work like a dumbass standing there waiting for freak'n people to come and see me like always.  but okay some people did come but they got on my dam nerves because some of them kept on asking the same questions at the same time. then they just wouldnt shut the F up.  i mean you can understand the same people coming over and over and then asking the same dam thing again and again. so i ignored them because i didnt give a dam.  well anyways i didnt get to go w/ my familia because of that and then the next day i had to wait 4 my cuz 2 get off of work for we can leave. well then after my cuz got off i had 2  wait 4 her boyfriend 2 get off too.  okay. but we finally got home and i got 2 c my boyfriend. i was happy.  but i would have gotten home earlier if it wasnt for these dam peoples.  some people need 2 get there own rides home and stuff.  but im not realy b_ch'n about it cuz i got chinese food and a nice shirt out of it.  so im happy about that. and i got 2 go 2 a mall i have never been too.  so theres another outcome. i guess. well neways theres some of my holiday happiness. but there is no cheer for me.  other then i went home and saw all of my family. and that i saw my boyfriend. who ate all of my COOKIES!!"

"event","(Continued)and a new drma
Sonia and Gisela are talking right now but i havent found out what happened between then that now they are okay.  but last night something else happened.
Now last night, Sonia started some other shit with her xgirlfriend claudia.  The Thing was that when they were all leaving school (annie had picked them up). and they were leaving claudia was following them and sonia and them pulled over to supposely kick some ass. but claudia and her friends left.  so then sonia and them all went to claudias house with a bat.  and throw down some punches and crap.  see what she wanted was that all the fook'n btch's (cynthia, claudia, and the other hoes)to come down so they(annie,sonia,gisela,and some other girls)can beat them up. so heres the ting claudia come down and sonia was talkn 2 her askn why is she doin this 2 her.  claudia""ahhahahahahah"" thats all she said.  then walked, and all sonia did was throw a cigerette in her face.  and claudia went upstairs.  then sonia cried. (to me that was unnessary) crybaby if you ask me but yeah its okay.then the one ting sonia wanted when all the girls came down sonia just left.. i mean if your going to go to someones else and start something then i suggest to atleast finish it in a proper way.  right?? but no all she did was cry and thats it.then hopped into the truck and took off.  i mean what the hell was that please people start it then make sure that you finish it in a proper manner. i mean its just not fear to the other people like myself who went to see the punches throw down.  and nothing happens."

"event","My boyfriend called to wake me up this morning. So i could actually get early to school.  But it didnt work out i was still late. Then my friend was complaning about it too.  I am going to out to work at 11am for the first time this week.  Because they lowered my hours, for one of the stupidest reasons ever.  They said that i dont smile enough when at the end of the day my freak'n face hurst from all that smiling.  while thats alright cause im getting another job soon.  This job is like 10 miles away and then my room mate is going to start working there today.  and he's going to be a dish washer the one thing he hates the most but hey he said"" ITS MONEY"".  i just laughed. ahahha
Dam my class is boring i cant stand that much any more my professor tries to treat us like high school kids.  and i cant stand that at all.  well only two more weeks and im not of it so i guess its okay.   right???
Well anyways, let me tell you about a drama that happened with my dramma friends yesterday: includes: sonia, gisela, and annie.

Sonia(the lesbo) was telling us that gisela was trying to get with your girlfriend annie.  But thats not true because gisela is straight as they can get. so they went out and then gisela and sonia started talking then sonia ran out like a little dramma queen.  then here comes annie talking to gisela. then they get into it and gisela starts crying because they dont believe her being straight.  sonia in these couple of days theres going to be more and just more fighting and crying about this being gay and straight.  So ill tell  you as it goes along.  But let me tell you something about these people.  They are always created dramma about any little dumb ass thing going around.  like for example:  i broke a nail!!! you broke my F**k'n Nail bitch. no!! what the fuck is this.  how is it my fault.  
Yes this is the way they start going out with things.

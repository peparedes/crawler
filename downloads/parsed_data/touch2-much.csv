I dont understand how some people can have such a strong ""faith"" to were they believe life is such a blessing. In all the reality I have left, It makes me sick to think that you have to feel so much pain and guilt to pass through each day, just to end up dead one day. And what the fuck was it all worth? Everybody crashes someday.

*** I'm scared that if he wont be able to move in, we'll have to break up.  Its not easy trying to have a long distance relationship. It doesnt work. I dont want to have to wait until I move out to be with him. He lives in gresham.. its too hard to talk to him on the phone since its long distance, and we both dont have cars to see each other, and even if we did, we still wouldnt see each other as often as we'd like to, because its too many miles away from each other.

But the point is, we worked shit out and I'm happy with him, and I had fun last night.. lol 

Hmm.. been thinking about people a lot lately that I never seem to hang out with Anymore.. like Amanda Graham, and Kami, and all of the old friends I used to hang out with before all of them had some weird dishonest thing.. (too long of a story) but pretty much, they couldnt tell me what was on their minds... I just think its really weird that after all that, people started to realise who their real friends were, and now, the big group that used to hang out all the time, is now like.. comepletely different. I dont see anyone from that ""group"" hanging out with anyone else. I think it sucks, and I'm starting to miss my old frineds.. but I was a baby about it and left the whole group and got new frineds, so I guess thats what I get for giving up on people. I guess I just worry because of how meny people I've been screwed over by, in the past.

"event","Hmm... so Amanda Graham hates me. haha Nikole was supossed to come over today but i dont know if thats going to work out since she has a cell phone, but you know how that oges... (if you have a cell phone, USE IT. its a way to get ahold of you when you arent home....) BUT thats ok. anyways. Yes it was stupid and imature of me to write such things about Lindsey... sometimes i dont feel that way about her, but last night i did. I dont like it when people are %100 fake to my face, and then go around talking shit. um WTF did i do to you EVER?? besides the comments I left about you last night. All i did, was say that he was cheating because he was too PUSSY to do it himself. Fuck any guy that cant get the balls to tell the truth. what is the point of cheating anyways? why cant you dump the person and go do whatever else your going to? im sure the chick would rather hear ""your dumped, i dont like you anymore"" rather then find out that her boyfrined was messing around with someone else. 

oh enough of that topic. I said what i wanted to say, i cant take my words back. fuck it, who cares. ive been meaning to say it for a while anyways. No one deserves to get cheated on, but at the same damn time, no one deserves to be treated like shit and called a slut EVERYDAY because of a stupid regretful thing. 

ok! so! today I'm goingto get the garage sale shit ready.. I have some pretty cute stuffed animal things toget rid of.. its hard getting rid of stuffed animals cos theyre so cute, and when your ready to get rid of them, they always seem to have a look on their face that says ""you dont love me anymore???"" aww.. its sad. i just cant stand anymore god damned stuffed things! lol I've kept my stuffed oscar meyer weiner mobile.. and my greatful dead bears.. oh and a few TY's haha but thats it! (and my garfeild collection.. which is like, 900 fucking stuffed animals all by its self) ugh... i dont know. WELL.. this is getting lame. Nikole, come over god damnit. i am bored. lol later....

I'm really getting used to him being here, and I love it. lol I think that when he moves in, it'll be really good.. we'll get along really well and stuff. :) perfect match :) ok that was really dumb. Anyways.. to get to the AWFUL part.. i must say that there are some DUMB bitches in this world. everywhere you go, theres some BITCH and when I say bitch, I do mean FEMALE.. glaring, or looking at you all funny..talking shit.. anything to make them feel better... and its like, jesus. why is it human nature for females to be such cunts???? no joke.. I'll even admit that I know I'm a bitch to people. A selective few I'm nice to.. all girls are bitches. (whats the point???) Well.. Theres a little girl named Lindsey. yeah, shes nice to me and I have nothing to bitch about.. but I chose to bitch because little Lindsey has a big attitude problem, and a big fucking mouth. Also, i chose to bitch because of someone named NIKOLE. Nikole hasnt been a friend of mine for a long time or anything, but shes a good one. she hasnt screwed me over like most females do... and I know that she would do a lot for me if i needed it. I'm getting tired of her getting shit for a mistake in her past that she didnt think would turn into a big regret. GET THE FUCK OVER IT LINDSEY. Move on, grow the fuck up, and just realize.. You just obviously werent good enough. ""Isn't it cute how Lindsey thinks shes better than everyone else?""

Love you Nikole, Im glad things are getting better for you."

Kyles been in the bitchiest mood.. he broke his ancle (kinda) he has a really bad cold, and he has 3000 something in fines he has to pay.. so i gues i can understand, but jesus.. hes been so rude lately. He never acts like he wants to talk to me when i call him, and i ALWAYS have to be the one to call him.. and its like, god, why did you even ask me back out if your annoied with me, or you dont want to talk to me? i dont know, im hoping that when we see each other next weekend we'll make everything better.. its just really depressing to think that your boyfrined might really not want to talk to you, no matter how bad you want to talk to him, and no matter how much you love to hear his voice over the God Dammed phone.
Hmm.. another thing that really sucks, is that i need two juniors or seniors to invite Kyle and I to prom, otherwise we wont be able to go. I really wan to go because I made plans already adn it seems like it would be the ""best night of my life"" but its stressing me out and i guess that since its been so hard to get tickets to prom so far.. maybe its just not ment to fucking happen. GOD !!!
well whatever.. yah i guess im going to go. i just needed to complain about my ""oh so horrible life"" heh. teenage life, boyfrined problems and prom.. what a tragic life.

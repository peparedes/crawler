things are a lil..well stressful i guess you would say..i find myself snapping at people and i dont mean to, but then again i can't really help it. A person can only handle so much ya know...and...i know a lot of things are going on and what may or never happen. I have tryed to ignore it and act like nothing is going on and forget, but it's there.  The bad thing is its starting to effect my motivation..as in school work..im not really fallin behind just find myself highly not wanting to do it and just have a good time get away not have to worry.  ..i just keep waiting for something good to walk into my life and im beginning to think it's just not going to happen.

""YOU THINK IM JOKIN LEAVE NOW!""

..yeah just two lil minor things my mom just said to me...we just got into a huge fight and i have been crying for like an hour now.  I can't believe some things she just said to me and they way she said them.

I swear these last few months have been so hard on me...i feel like im losing everything..and i just dont feel happy anymore. I have even thought about leaving..going for away..as in you have to take a plain to get there.  Then i dont have to worry about anything..and not talk to anyone just focus on nothing but school and me.

I dont know i have had so many feelings and thoughts and i have kept all of them bottled up inside for so long and more is being adding idk how much i can take...i know what you are thinking(my close buds) i have always tryed to be stronger than i really am..i try to take way to much sometimes..but i cant help it.. i have to deal with things must people never will or never had to at my age..and i was taught that feelings and emotions and crying is a weakness.

But i think that not dealing with it and keeping it all inside..is a weakness as well...

so i guess.....  .. im weak"

"event","I just dont understand why things happen sometimes..i have been so stressed and scared for a couple of weeks cause of my brother and school starting and everyone moving away...my mom and i where getting along real good better than we have in years!  Now,lately, she has bee a BITCH..all she does is yell at me nothing is ever good enough no matter what i do..i help her around the house..with the kids..and do the yard work when she needs helps or asks me to do it..i keep the upstairs clean and do my chores in the dwn stairs..but all she does is put me down and yell at me all the time..

example: Tonight
 she was pissed cause i went to the V-ball game...i came home and she yelled at me and said that im not a high school student im not allowed to go to school events or go to the hight school and i dont need to be friends with high schoolers..and that she doesn't care how old i am im gonna be in by 9 mon-friday!

Yeah, how much of a bitch is that..on top of that Ben and I get into a huge fight cause he has been as ass to me lately so i got tired of it cause he blew me off again tonight..and he tells me that he is tryin to get use to not being around me and surpressing his feelings...aka pushing me away..because he is going to be leaving for college and needs to get use to it!

OK..thanks alot..and he tells me all kinds of crazy stuff..we fought from 9:30-11:30 ..freakin nuts

I was suppose to go with Eric and Corey and some others to go have some fun..but then my mom and I got into a huge fight and then Bruce got into it..on top of me and ben fighting...OMG!!!!!!!! saying that they want me out..

....on top of all that my brother has been in the hosiptal for weeks he just gets out and then had to go back in and now he's out again..and they keep giveing different kinds of meds. tryin to kill and keep this STAFF from coming back and his body is rejecting everything that they give him..cause it has to be only certain stuff...cause only certain meds. kill this rare type of STAFF..which is very very very very serious..kinda like cancer serious.  And if they dont find one that his body will accept...it's gonna kill him!!!!!!
We already almost lost him...for a week straight everyday i got off work i drove to Indy to see him and stayed with him till i had to leave and everyday after i left i just cryed the whole way home..cause him and i have always been very close..and even though his a boy..whenever anything happened or went wrong he always looked at me to be the stronger one to take charge..which was no big deal cause my dad raised me to be that way..and he also made me have to be that way..cause everything i went throught with him and and other stuff..my close freinds know what i mean..so when i was there i would never cry..and i tryed real hard to seem perfect and not bothered or worried a few he would say ""whats wrong sis"" and i was like o im tired hard day at work or i didnt feel so good or something..cause i didnt want him to feel alarmed...we didn't tell him everything that the doctor told us..because he would flip out and they where afraid it would make his condtion worse...he had 3 surgerys already!
He may not be able to go to school this year.

Plus i have been sick for 5 weeks now..u cant get it..it really sucks having this though.  My chest always hurts..im always druged up on pain med. for it..half the time im to tired to do anything cause of the meds. and the other half i dont have any strength to do antyhing..after i take a shower and get ready...im ready for a nap. mY head always hurts really bad..my eyes hurt..it hurts to look around lights hurt.  I walk everyday 2 or 3 miles and then run 2 miles at night..and i have been on a diet for 2 and half weeks now..i have lost 10 lbs. 'i think that may have something to do with my not havin energy to..idk'

it's just i have all this stuff sitting on me and i dont know what to do...i like someone and i dont think he likes me back..it kinda bugs me..im scared about school..im scared cause its new and different and im scared im not gonna be able to do it...and im gonna be a failure..."

<P>I have never seen him like this...then the nurses came to do all this work to him...and his fever came back and he was shakin cause he was so cold and screamin...that went on forever..and nick wasnt helping any he kept yelling also which made it worse...and i was about to flip out...</P>
<P>i kept tryin to keep him busy by makin look at me and talkin to him and asking questions..cause he was in so much pain and all the stuff they where doing to him...i had to walk out once cause i almosted started to cry...i did good though i never cryed in front of him..i held it together..but i cryed on the way home...</P>
<P>and the rest of the week sucks..cause i need to go up there tomorrow..and i work from 9-3 and then i work from 8 to 3 and then the next day i have to pick up my sister and take her to court and then work 8-3 and then friday i work 9-2</P>

<P>i have all this stuff going on...and im so scared i just cant seem to sleep but a&nbsp; few minutes at a time..so i hope this helps..cause i have no one to talk to and i think if i get some of it off my chest i'll be able to sleep..i have to get some sleep cause i have to get up and go to work till 3 and then go to Indy and then work from 8-3...im gonna be dead..and i feel like shit...which doesn't help any...</P>

<P><FONT color=#33ccff size=4><EM>Sometime today i have to sit down and write a letter.&nbsp; It's going to take me hours to do...it's gonna be one of the hardest letters i have ever written before.&nbsp; I don't even&nbsp; know how to start it or what to say really. I mean when i just think to myself i know what to say...it's all there and its not hard to say out loud but when i have to say it out loud and to the person it's like my mind goes blank..there's nothing there..i dont even know where to start.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff size=4><EM>I had a chance to last night and when it came up i was tryin to think of what to say and i couldn't and it was so hard if anything did.&nbsp; I have never had that problem before..i have always been able to think quick on my feet..lol my friends know that cause when they have a minute to think of a lie they call me..""hey,what should say to my mom"" ..lol</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff size=4><EM>But for some reason this is different..i can't think quick and i don't know what to do.&nbsp; I have never been so nervours and exicited all at the same time. It makes me want to cry thinking about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like im setting myself up for a big disappointment and heart ache.&nbsp; Who knows i guess i will have to wait till tonight to find out..if it happens tonight..i don't know if i'll do it or not. I want to bring it all up and asks some things and then give the letter..but i don't know...i guess i'll have to wait...</EM></FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>Last night was senior night..it was nice i guess. Well it was a CIC game and we won..but some people made it not so fun...but idc cause they where wrong.&nbsp; KJ almost made me cry when she came out and huged me..lol..but i was strong i didn't cry.&nbsp; It's kinda depressing the thought that everyone is gonna go their own ways..and you more than likely aren't going to see most of them </FONT><FONT color=#009900>ever or for a long time.&nbsp; I just hope that the ones i have been closest to don't forget me..or my friends that are still in school.&nbsp; I already got a gift from my step mom..she gave me a really pricey necklace..its nice.Actually im wearing it today..lol</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#009900>Anyways...i hope this weekend is better than last..i didnt really do anything over the weekend..a whole lot of nothing.&nbsp; Man, im glad some stuff is done and out of the way..yesterday i had a CIC </FONT><FONT color=#cc6600>game and it was senior night like i said plus i had to be at an awards show for Voca and i had to meet my step mom and all this..its like gesh....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc6600>I have had so much on my mind lately and so much going on it's starting to catch up with me...some stuff is starting to pull me down..but i have been fighting it...and so far im doing ok.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc6600>As you can see i have&nbsp; alot to say cause im just going on about whatever just happens to pop into </FONT><FONT color=#3366ff>my head. Well some things i can't really say on here..because i dont want rumors started or anyone to know some things. Cause 3 of us learned that this can be used against you..lol- and the other two people haven't writen much since then..lol. I hate when people are gay.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>LOL- wanna know something funny..im sitting here at school writting all this...now here's the catch..hehe...i am sitting in the ISR room..lol...yeah how gay is that...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>now now...you know me better than that..im not in troulbe or anything..i didn't have anywhere to </FONT><FONT color=#ffcc33>go for contact..well i did have some where to go but the teacher left and i couldn't be there withouth him so i had to go to the office and they sent everyone who didnt have anywhere to go up here. Never been in here before...and im glad cause it sucks. It's boring and the desks are gay and i feel confined or something idk.</FONT></P>

Sam M, and Sam S, and I played ball against J, Chris, and Sqweek.&nbsp; They won of course but we had fun.&nbsp; Then Sqweek and Sam played one on one and he kept cheating and changing </FONT><FONT color=#ffcc00>the rules cause he was losing..thats weak..lol she beat him 3 times...cause he would be like we are playing to 5 no we are playing to 7 and kept going cause he was losing..lol! Way to go </FONT></FONT><FONT color=#6600cc>Sam! I freakin hurt my ankle last night at the game&nbsp;cause our stupid shoes don't have any ankle support..they said it was a minor sprang..so thats good..i stayed up all night icing my foot so it would swell or hurt as bad.&nbsp; It actually feels alot better then it did last night.&nbsp; Alright i think i wrote enough for today...so </FONT></P>

"event","Faythe Isabelle was born on March 14th, 2004 after 22 hours of labor.  She was 8lb 7oz and 20.5 inches long.  She was born via rotational forceps delivery due to her being presented face-up as well as not coming down at the right angle.  Basically they had to go in with the forceps and turn her around, straighten her out and with me pushing, pull her out!  Since I had a fever during my labor and was on antibiotics, Faythe was put into the special care nursery and was also put on antibiotics for 48 hours so make sure she did not have an infection.  Unfortunately because of this I was unable to share a room with her and had to be wheeled down to the nursery every few hours to feed.  Luckily we were both okay.  She is a very easy-going baby and loves people.  To see more about her, please click on the following link:

<P>I've always thought of different songs that I wanted to sing to my children as lullabyes.&nbsp; I really didn't want to do all the classic standard stuff but things that would be special with us.&nbsp; This song from Jewel has always been one of my favorites.&nbsp; Of course actually hearing the song makes a bigger impression than just the words themselves.&nbsp; I also have a favorite from an old obscure 70s band called Renaissance.&nbsp; The song is called ""Think of You"".</P>
<P><EM>I love you like the stream flows restless to the sea</EM></P>
<P><EM>See you like the mist, touches clouds touches me</EM></P>
<P><EM>I see you in the stars, wherever you may be...</EM></P>

<P>It's hard to believe that my little girl will be here soon!&nbsp; I also can't believe that I will be going on mat leave in 2 weeks.&nbsp; I don't think I'm going to handle that very well.</P>
<P>Saw the doctor on Thursday (not my dr but a sub cuz mine is in Mexico on vacation!) and everything is going well.&nbsp; She said that the baby is engaged in the pelvis now so that gives me about 2 to 3 weeks before she is ready to be born.&nbsp; We had to have another ultrasound a few weeks back because I have been measuring big.&nbsp; As it turns out the baby is normal sized but I have lots and lots and lots of amniotic fluid!&nbsp; People better look out when that bag breaks!!&nbsp; I've always said that my girl likes to have room, so naturally I'd have lots of space for her to swim around in.&nbsp; The tech also confirmed for us that the baby is definately a girl.&nbsp; My Faythe Isabelle is on her way, she has been waiting a long time!</P>
<P>We have the crib done, have a little set of drawers for her clothes (all washed and put away!) that works as a changing table as well.&nbsp; Father-n-law got us a stroller/car seat so we're set there as well.&nbsp; Not sure when we're going to get a swing but I imagine it will be after the baby is born.&nbsp; Her little corner of the room is all decorated with Pooh and Tigger stuff and looks so darn cute!&nbsp; If I can remember, I'll try to post a pic of it.</P>
<P>Not much else to say except that I'm feeling good and getting anxious for the big day.&nbsp; If I'm having any problems at all is just sheer exhaustion.&nbsp; It's very hard for me to sleep (hard to turn over from one side to the other) and then when I finally get sleep is about time for me to get up for work so that is very difficult.&nbsp; I'm usually pretty tired all day until I can come home and lay down!&nbsp; I really hope that I am able to have that week after I'm done working and before Faythe is due so that I can get some rest before she arrives.&nbsp; Alan is getting very impatient and wants her here now.&nbsp; It's really cute how he's been reacting to everything.&nbsp; We had our childbirth class last Saturday and he was all prepared with his notebook and pencil.&nbsp; He's been so good to me getting things that I need and massaging my feet and helping me out.&nbsp; I'm so lucky to have him for my husband!</P>
<P>I will try to post again before the baby is born.&nbsp; I can't promise anything as I seem to be too tired and lazy to do much of anything these days!&nbsp; If I don't, I will definitely post about the birth!</P>"

"event","Here I go forgetting to update my journal again!  I have been getting back into Star Wars Galaxies as of late and with the holidays it has left me no time to post!

I can't believe I only have 2 months left.  It has gone by so fast!  I'll never forget how scary and slow the first trimester was and now for Faythe to almost be here it sure is strange.

We had a pretty good Christmas, Alan's father got us a stroller and his mom got us a mattress for our crib.  We're slowly but surely getting all the things we need for the baby.  I did splurge and get something for the crib.  I bought this old-style Tigger that is laying down and you wind it up and it plays a lullaby while moving it's tail really slow.  The tail has a butterfly on it too, it's so cute!  We're doing a Tigger theme for the crib (since that was Alan's nickname when we met online).  Unfortunately we can't find a whole lot that is only Tigger except for animals so it's more of a Pooh theme.  We have a Pooh mobile an some cute stick-ons for the wall.  We're going to have the crib in our room for the first year, then when she gets older she will have a room of her own.  Since I will be breast-feeding, I prefer to have her in the same room, especially at night!  Also we are right there if she ever needs anything.

I have taken a bunch of pictures of my belly from 27-30 weeks and will be developing them tomorrow.  I'll post the pictures as soon as I get them developed!  I also have an OB appt on Thursday so I'll most likely update again then.

That's it for now!"

"event","Well here I go trying to start a journal then I don't even write in it!!

On Sunday, December 7th, I will officially be 7 ""months"" pregnant (27 weeks), 3 months from my due date of March 7th and my neice will be celebrating her 7th (golden) birthday!  I still have to send out her package tho EEEEEK.  I can't wait until she sees the lavendar singing unicorn I got her lol!

As far as any latest baby news....tummy is still getting bigger (and rounder, Lynn :)) and Faythe is supposed to be about 2 pounds now.  She sure is getting stronger, she kicks and punches me at the same time so I can feel her on both sides of my belly.  So far she seems to be the most active in the morning so I sure hope it stays that way after she's born!

I got some film so I will be taking more prego pics this weekend and will scan them and change my pic here :).

Better go do my wifely duties and make dinner!"

"event","Well this is my first attempt at an on-line journal.  I'm not exactly sure how I feel about having this being relatively public so I may change it to private/friends at a later date.

When I first found out I was pregnant, my friend told me that everything I watched from now on, I would picture myself or my child in that situation.  She sure was right!  I turned on the tv and a rerun of Angel is on where he becomes a father.  Granted I'm not a vampire but I am definitely picturing myself in his shoes as a new parent and all the awesome feelings that will bring about on the day my child is born.

It's kind-of funny how everything I see makes me think of babies or being pregnant.  Kind-of like when you buy a car, you never noticed anyone else driving that particular type before but after you get it, you look around and everyone seems to have one!  Like when I decided to move to Vancouver, I never remember hearing stories about it before (besides the fact that the X Files was filmed there and the hooplah that ensued after David Duchovny decided he wanted to move it to LA) or Canada really but yet now every time I go home I hear about it on the news and people I know suddenly have friends or family that have been there before and tell me how beautiful it is.  It's so strange how much is going on around us that we are not conscious of.

As far as baby news is concerned, I'm 25 weeks now and getting very excited about finally looking pregnant.  Now I don't look like I'm just getting fat!!  I am having really bad water retention problems so that is causing me to gain weight rather quickly.  I've already gained close to 30 pounds and so I need to try to watch it the next 15 weeks.

We're about 80% sure that we are having a girl.  The tech wouldn't give us the 100% but I did see ""it"" so I do believe that the baby is definitely a girl!  If so her name will be Faythe Isabelle (and I'll be referring to her from now on as Faythe).  Even if the baby does end up being a boy, our boy's name is Seth Amra (Amra for King of the Lions from the Conan the Barbarian comic book series).  So since Seth and Faythe sound pretty similar, I don't think I will have confused the baby too much by calling her Faythe in utero!

Not really having too many problems with the pregnancy so far.  I am getting heartburn a lot (which I was so sure I wasn't going to get)!  My friend that just had a baby told me that I would get it but I thought naaaaah, I've never had it my whole life!  Then about 2 weeks ago I had this horrible, kinda burping pain and when I told Alan about it, he said ""Honey, you're having heartburn!!"".  Thank goodness I'm allowed to have Tums!  I don't know what I'd do otherwise!  I have to be very picky about what I eat and drink now, just about everything seems to cause it.  Of course the old wive's tale is that the baby has a lot of hair and that causes the heartburn...I guess we shall see in 15 weeks!

I've been having quite a bit of growing pains in the ligaments on my left side today.  Guess that means I may be popping out more soon!  I will have to get on a more routine schedule of taking pictures so I can document things better.

Well I think I've rambled on enough for one day.  I brought homework home from work (phew! say that 20 times fast!) and it's about 9:20pm so I better get a move on!"

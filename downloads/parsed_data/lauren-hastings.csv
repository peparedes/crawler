"event","I flew to New York two nights ago.  Time to break away, even just for a little.

I'll stop by and visit the family, before flying back to L.A.

I miss Justin and Trace.  Maybe I'll call them later, and harass them.

*yawns* I believe I need some beauty sleep, so I'll update later!

"event","This morning, I took my bags down to the airport.  I got an early flight out to Millington.  Trace wanted me to come and visit for some company.

So, here I am.  We've been hanging out all day, and he met me down at the airport.  We'll fly to Arizona on the 4th to see Justin, and Christina kick off the tour.

It'll be fun.

Sunburn hurts, especially when it's on your ass. ;*"

"event","One of the hardest things is to walk away from a relationship.  Then there's the part where you have to get over it.  Which takes a rather long time.

I'm over my Ex-Boyfriend.  I'm ready to move on.  Time to go on with my life.

Tonight, I'll probably hang with J and Trace.  If not, I'll go scouting at the clubs.  What else is there to do?"

"event","::Stepping inside her apartment, she kicked the door closed behind her. Tugging blonde tresses free from that news boy cap, she emmited a small sigh. Making her way towards the couch, she arched her knees and sat down. Retreiving her cell phone from her pocket, she placed it to her ear. Cradling it, she listened to her voicemails.:: Hey everyone. I'm Lauren Hastings, a model. Uhm..where to begin. Well, I'm most famous for my part in Justin's video 'Cry me a river.' I was the Britney look-a-like.

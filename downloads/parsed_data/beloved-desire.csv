"event","I talked to him..
the one who makes me quiver..
the one who never leaves my thoughts and makes me shatter inside.
the one whose broken my little heart the heart which has been repaired many times.
but by this one who i love so much i love him with all the love i can give.
he hurt me and i hurt him in return 
i miss him and want his love back so bad
i guess its true u dont know what u have until its gone
then u dont have it nemore
and you r lost without it.
thats how this is i want him back more than anything
he is my john doe and im his jane doe!! <3love :::CRUSHED:::"

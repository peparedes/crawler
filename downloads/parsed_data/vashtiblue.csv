"event","Yesterday was a bit of a 'one of them' day.  I had a meeting with my caseworker, worked through some issues and talked about what has been making me punch things and why I have been feeling like I feel.

Spoke to Jay loads today so I am happy.  Sad ain't it, U speak to some one U love and they make U feel all happy.

Been feeling very strange for a few days now, many things going on in this fcukt up little head of mine, want to go grrr, scream, punch, kick and plead to be put back into where I came from... if only this could happen.

Tom (Roche) shaved me head, feel better about it now as I was beginning to feel like a scruffy bugger, ha ha how could someone as ugly have a feeling of being a scruffy bugger, but yeah it does happen.  Had a bath and a shave and now I feel like a pretty thing again ha ha.

Played with my nu fone loads, changed pictures, music and shit.  I loves me nu fone soooo much... pity it has to be charged so bloody much.  Managed to get my crying baby ringtone to work, bugger knows why it wasn't working before but now it does.

Ain't spoken to Dickwadd for a while now, since he rang me on Sunday when he went to see his dad.  He sounded so out of it, and even I had never heard him sound so bad... he is now a rock head, what the fcuk is he doing to himself... but whatever it is he ain't gonna get to me.  I have tried so much to help him and support him, but there is just no point in it anymore... he is a person and a person I shared a long time in my life with but I just can't do no more for him, maybe if he admitted he had a problem instead of coming out with the same shit (I am just a fcukt up kid) he has been coming out with since I first met him then there might be some way to help him or to help him get help, but he says he ain't got a problem so hey that's up to him.

"event","Well what can I say, 2day started of shittier than an incontenants shitty shits, but improved as I got my shit 2gether & worked through a lot of stuff.

After Dave (my kind of lodger man) come home we went 2 see Jays family, where I sort of learnt something about lawnmowers... never mess with them, get a man in ha ha!

Jay, btw is 1 of the guys who entered Mr Gay Bournemouth.  I have been spending loads of time with him over the past few weeks.  He is such a babe :-).

Jays family R just 2 cool for words, they R like the family I never had as a child.  They R all 1 big unit, unlike the crappy screwed up hateful abusive rubbish pass the parcel family I was unfortunately thrown in 2.

Grrr bloody Big Brother, I h8 it with a passion, whats the point in it. so bloody boring, I think I have finally lost it... or have I just lost the plot.

I have been working hard on Mr Gay Bournemouth (www.mrgaybournemouth.co.uk) & it is all coming 2gether now, I know who the winner is, & really wanna let him know, but can't say nothing as it would really ruin things, but it would make him so happy & I would love 2 see him smile, cos he is happy, not just cos he feels he has 2.

I aint really spent much time with the ShiraCreatorMachine as he has been having a few problems, some fcuking tosser stole his car grrr makes me mad as he is a cool guy & didn't need that shit.

Since my last entry I have been through a lot of shit.  The Groms got attacked and nearly died, but is coming along in leaps & bounds, getting better every day, still has a nasty scar across her back, but she is alive.  

I now have a new downstairs neighbour, a dirty disgusting smackhead, there are comings and goings more than here at the House of Lush.  I thort the dirty whore who used 2 live downstairs was bad, she was dirty & a total skank, but atleast she wasn't a smackhead.

I ain't spoke 2 Dickwadd 4 a long time now, as I just don't know what 2 say 2 him, he is far 2 fcukt up in the head 2 even work out what 2 say to him.  Last thing I heard about him is that he is pinning up and doing the rent scene 2 make funds 4 his habit.  What a turn around, he used to be the clean one when we first met all those years ago, then steadily got worse & worse over the years, with all the support he had from me, he eventually ended up a smackhead... see I told ya there wasn't much I could say.

Me really wants 2 talk 2 me BSF Shira, me misses her so much :-( me wants 2 hugs her and kisses her, cos me lurrrves her... not that she will talk 2 me but hey, now she knows if she reads this.  & I know that the ShiraCreatorMachine would be soooo happy.

I finally got me bindhi done, it looks real cool, but by bloody fcuk did it hurt, I must be mad but I am getting some more done 2 it soon :-)

Am now gonna get me shit 2 try & go 2 Asda, wanna see if I can get meself a nu webcam as this heap is doing my head in... will be such a big step if I can actually manage 2 get there and back on me own... yes yes yes I am going 2 do it.

When I got home I was a bit pooped at a few things but hey, nothing like it will ever happen again.  Think I now need a holiday to get over the last one and the hassles I had upon my return :-(

Since getting back I have been rushed off my feet.  Had loads of holiday washing to catch up with and had to get my house all tidy and fresh.  Went shopping and bought loads of new nic nacs :-) Have even more gargoyles and scarey things for the bedroom now :-)

I have had just about as much of piss takers as I can get.  I have helped people out and they expect me to run round like a fcuking cleaner, doing washing, clearing up after them and acting like a cleaner in my home place, ha ha what do they take me for... I might do it for a while but then the ARRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH factor kicks in and I say ""NO MORE"" and off they get fcukt!

Bloody men are just so self self self... I tell a person I want my flat and my space back and its all ""Whats wrong with me? what have I done? Y U treating me this way?"" ha ha does he really need to ask?

"event","Well what more can I say? Today would of been my mums birthday had she still been alive, but she died of cancer in January 1999.  I am not the kind of guy that handles death very well, and this is the time of the year that it gets to me most.  I have listened to what all these people harp on about getting over it and that I should be past the stage of letting it worry me and that I should not care any more, but all I can say to them is ""Go fcuk urselves"".  These people have most obviously never loved someone so much that they feel lost, abandoned and very very alone in this big wide world of pain and heartache  Maybe I am a sad twat, maybe I should do what people want me to do and get on with it and not give a care in the world for the woman that bought me up and suffered so much to give her children what she felt they had a right to have, that being a happy settled childhood, but I am never gonna get over it me thinks.  Maybe I don't think about her every day and maybe I am not the most loving of sons that a mother could of wished for, maybe I was the beast incarnate when I was a youngster but by fcuk do I miss her now and wish I could make a mends for all the nasty evil shit I put her through  and I wish I had more time with her to truly get to know her as a person and not just a mother, but I guess this was not to be... so there is my penance for being such an evil little shit.

Well now my feeling sorry for myself part is done, I would just like to say to all my sexy peeps, thanks for being around and thanks for being my friends, I love you all.

I am not going to be very good at handling anything for the next little while so I will not be writing nothing on my LJ for a while, as I would not know where to start.  Those who need me know where I am and how to get hold of me, but rest assured I will be back, with more waffle than ever he he, but for now I am taking a vow of silence.

I went to France last week from Sunday 2 Monday night, met and got off with this well sexy french bit, he was well cute :-) yeah so I am a flirt and me loves it.  Will I ever be able to show my face on a Brittany Ferries craft again? yeah hell, why not :-P I am the nevy of my much better looking friend, who went with me.  He could never understand how the magic of Tizi. works, he saw it in action and now hates me ha ha do I care? NO!

Have not spoken to my BSF Shira but hey I am sure I am gonna catch up with her at some point... did go see the Shiracreatormachine so that's a good thing, he makes me smile, sorts me out above all the shit that life throws at me, mainly at the hands of pathetic two faced crap spouting shit stirring no life men, yeah U guessed it, the twat that is Dickwadd, the no lifer I spent so many years with.  What part of ""I don't want to know, don't give a fcuk"" do men not get? I don't think I waill ever find out, cos no one has the answer. Blagged my way onto the guest list for HOMELANDS, just by being me, honest I never had to blow anyone :-)... well maybe just a quick one :-P

Wrote a cool begging letter to the executors of my mum's will, and I never used the word fcuk once, I used it about 100 times but hey it's my money and I want it, so they had better give it to me or they will feel the wraith of Tizi. come down on them like a Queen without a shag!

Busy, busy, a womons work is never done... washing and more washing, the dishwasher hates me, the telly thinks I am dead and the stereo is gonna explode if I hear Eminem one more time in this hour!

"event","2day has been just one of those 'bloody people' days, people always want me for something and never want to help me out, with the exceptions of a few.  Wayne, my cousin, come round 2 finish my hallway, bless him, he even bought the gloss.

Spoke 2 Ickle a few times, he is still cool, he is such a sweet guy, not that he would like me saying it but he is so what the fcuk if I say it.

nowt else has really happened apart from being bored of this and bored of that and bored or the other ha ha.

Found out 2day that Josh wants 2 divorce his dad and have me as his dad, OMG what a fcuking crap dad I would make.  I have been a crap dad 2 my own daughter, so I don't think I would make a better dad 2 him... can't say as I was so young when my own daughter was born, many would say I was just a child then, maybe I have matured with age, but hey I don't know.

Miss my BSF Shira, she is such a girl, me loves her 2 pieces :-) Luv n hugs 2 The greatness of Shira."

"event","Yay, hooray and all that.  I stuck my neck out and made a decision, I went to see Phil, my fave little tattoo artist sweetie (www.skintech.co.uk) and he did my tattoo for me, I am chuffed to pieces which is not hard really, I get chuffed at the slightest things.  I went for one of my funny little faces, on the small of my back, just above me trouser line :-) It is cool and fabbo and great and... he he :-) can't wait to show it off now.  Dunno what Ickle will say about it, but hey if I like it he will like it, me hopes.  

Ha ha , spoke 2 Ickle and he just told me that he don't like tattoo's ha ha well he shit out then as I have 15 tattoo's now :-) more tats than skin.  Ha ha he wants me 2 go out to The Venue for UNDER 18's night, me thinks I would look like a right old perv being there at the age of 34! ha ha well I guess I will just go and get completely trollied at the Gallery bar and meet up with them afterwards.  Could he handle me in a skirt pisst as a fart? I don't think so, ha ha.

Just had a might quick chat with the greatness that is the shiracreatormachine, he was on and off like a flash :-( He is such a busy busy man, one wonders how he ever found the time to create such a beautiful creation as the superior mistress, my BSF, the ONE & ONLY Shira xxx me wubs her U know :-). xxxxx

Am sat here now with my little tattoo designer man, the Josh Oxborough, he is such a good little doodler, he comes up with some good ideas... I am gonna run out of space soon.  I would love 2 have a Shira creation on my  body but it would take like forver to complete on me and forever is a mighty long time, I know I love tattoo's but could I really be sat there half dressed or even nekkid for as long as it would take to do a Shira masterpiece, urm well I think I could :-P"

"event","Well I have just come back from a time out with the shiracreatormachine, and woe of woes, his knob fell off in his hands, and I had to give it back :-( he he.  I will not elaborate on this matter, but 4 all U dirty minded buggers out there, it is NOT what U may of at first thort.

I was toying with the idea of a new tattoo, but as I am such a decisiveless person, using the term person loosely, I could not decide on where 2 go 2 have it done, or where 2 have it done, or even 4 that matter which one of my three designs 2 have done.  I wish I did not need someone 2 make my decisions 4 me but thats me :-(  I shall consult the oracle of wisedom (Ickle) and the greatness that is Shira, I am sure they will advise me:-)

I am now gonna treat myself to a nice cream cake :-) pile on the pounds and regret it 4 years afterwards but hey what the hell :-P

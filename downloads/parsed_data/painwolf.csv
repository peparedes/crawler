Your eating style is reserved. You are a bit of a fussy eater, and you have very specific ways you like your food prepared.

You have a total sweet tooth. When you can get away with it, you like to have dessert before dinner!

Your taste in food tends to be pretty flexible. You may crave sushi one night, and your favorite childhood recipe the next.

Admit it, you're a little trashy and low class at times. You're definitely more comfortable at a tattoo parlor than the theater.

You are a tough person who isn't afraid to live life fully. There isn't a lot that scares you.

You are laid back and extremely easygoing. You never make a fuss, and you try to enjoy every moment.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourpeanutbutterandjellysandwichsayaboutyouquiz/"">What Does Your Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich Say About You?</a></div>"

The truth is I broke up with Lauren, it wasn't her or forced by anyone. It was all me I made the choice to break up with her. She didn't want to and I talked her into splitting up, saying it would be better for her. I left Lauren she never wanted to leave me, I left her in her time of need when she need me most. I'm the ass hole not her. I hurt her she never hurt me.

Anywho!

On to better news, Just started my Job with Trek bikes. Working with there Freestyle team and bikes on building lighter stronger frames and so on. Also doing complete builds and rebuilds of bike for them. The fun part is I get to ride, crash, bash and distroy trek bikes and then get together with the other wrenchers and look and see what we can do to make them better and inprove on with there bikes. Today on my first day I took a Gary Fisher PhD (about a $2000 bike) and just bash the shit out of it. Fucking awesome bike for doing freestyle and jumping you can get awesome air with it and its nice and light so it's easy to toss around and do tricks while in the air. Tomarrow I'm going to smash up a Gary Fisher Fat Possum can't wait. 

Only sad thing is even with a awesome job doing something I love and have a major passion for I still feel vary empty and just like alone right now. *shrugs* what can you do right? Just keep on going and hope things work out for you in the end is all I really have left now. I think the feelings sadly also helped out on me taring the shit out of that bike today which when I was done did make me feel alittle better but not by much."

XP I know I shouldn't of eaten that 2 month old burrito in my fridge with that past due date chocolate milk. 10 points if I blow chuncks all over my Math teacher or a student next class. As for all you peeps who been asking me what my next con is, its currently looking like it will be walk con 2007 A.K.A. AC 07. I going to be dragged to that kicking and screaming. OH JOY! So expect to see me drunk off me ass again for the whole con. (I know its a ways away) I don't know if it will be the same unless I'm drunk on the floor screaming Kargo! or getting kicked in the nuts by spain. As far a life at the moment its going. Putting along, I spend 80% of the day asleep the other time I'm at school or making dinner. I got a Slobber Monster now, his names Quincie we like to sit around the apartment hopped on the Q together. Other then that theres nothing new. Well I got 15 mins till math and the chance to blow chuncks all over a student or my teacher lets see what happens! I could use those ten points at the moment. I can turn them in hopefully for some Asprin for this fucking headache from hell!"

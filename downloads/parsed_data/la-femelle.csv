"event","I'm a huge fan of dreams.<br /><br />I keep a dream journal and write in it even if it's only a split second of a dream.&nbsp; It's fun to go back later and read what I was dreaming about years ago...most of them I don't even remember, and I think to myself, ""Where in the <i>world</i> did that come from?""&nbsp; So then I thought about it some more today, and I wondered, where do my dreams come from?<br /><br />It's like this:&nbsp; the other day I was on ebaumsworld and saw a picture of a champion hula hooper with what looked like a hundred hula hoops going around her body all at once.&nbsp; So that night, I had a dream that some random, fictional dream lady gave me a hula hoop and told me to practice with it until she finished a phone call.&nbsp; Obviously, I know what prompted that dream.&nbsp; But what I'm wondering is, why would that conjure up a really weird dream in my brain while, say, the ""Dramatic Chipmunk"" video on youtube failed to make me have a strange dream involving chipmunks making funny faces and suspense music in the background?<br /><a href=""../../../update.bml"">Update Journal</a><br />It's just odd to me, because as much as I love thinking about dreams and what causes them and all that kind of stuff...I just don't understand how the most miniscule, split second of an event from a whole 16 hour day could make me have an entire dream based solely on that insignificant occurrence.&nbsp; And I'm not really into psychology, so I don't know anything about it in that aspect...but on a different level, I'm baffled.<br /><br />:-/"

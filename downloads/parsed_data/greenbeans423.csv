"event","A woman was asked by a coworker, ""What is it like to be a Christian?""
 
      The coworker replied, ""It is like being a pumpkin.""  God picks you from the patch, brings you in, and washes all the dirt off of you.  Then He cuts off the top and scoops out all the yucky stuff.
 
      He removes the seeds of doubt, hate, and greed.  Then He carves you a new smiling face and puts His light inside of you to shine for all the world to see."" 
 
      This was passed on to me by another pumpkin.  Now it's your turn to pass it to other pumpkins.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I showered and shaved............... I adjusted my tie. 

I got there and sat.............. In a pew just in time. 

Bowing my head in prayer......... As I closed my eyes. 

I saw the shoe of the man next to me..... Touching my own. I sighed. 

With plenty of room on either side...... I thought, ""Why 

must our soles touch?"" 

It bothered me, his shoe touching mine... But it didn't 

bother him much. 


A prayer began: ""Our Father""............. I thought, ""This 

man with the shoes.. has no pride. 

They're dusty, worn, and scratched. Even worse, there are holes on the side!"" 

""Thank You for blessings,"" the prayer went on. 

The shoe man said............... a quiet ""Amen."" 

I tried to focus on the prayer....... But my thoughts were 

on his shoes again 

Aren't we supposed to look our best.. When walking through that door? 

""Well, this certainly isn't it,"" I thought, Glancing toward the floor. 

Then the prayer was ended............ And the songs of praise began. 

The shoe man was certainly loud...... Sounding proud as he sang. 

 His voice lifted the rafters......... His hands were raised high. 

The Lord could surely hear.. The shoe man's voice from the sky. 

It was time for the offering......... And what I threw in was steep. 

I watched as the shoe man reached.... Into his pockets so deep. 

I saw what was pulled out............ What the shoe man put in. 

Then I heard a soft ""clink"" . as when silver hits tin. 

The sermon really bored me.......... To tears, and that's no lie 

It was the same for the shoe man..... For tears fell from his eyes. 

At the end of the service........ As is the custom here 

We must greet new visitors.. And show them all good cheer. 

But I felt moved somehow............. And wanted to meet the shoe man 

So after the closing prayer.......... I reached over and shook his hand. 

He was old and his skin was dark..... And his hair was truly a mess 

But I thanked him for coming......... For being our guest. 

He said, ""My names' Charlie.......... I'm glad to meet you, my friend."" 

There were tears in his eyes......... But he had a large, wide grin 

""Let me explain,"" he said........... Wiping tears from his eyes. 

""I've been coming here for months.... And you're the first to say 'Hi.'"" 

""I know that my appearance.........""Is not like all the rest 

""But I really do try.................""To always look my best."" 

""I always clean and polish my shoes..""Before my very long walk. 

""But by the time I get here.........""They're dirty and  dusty, like chalk."" 

My heart filled with pain............ and I swallowed to hide my tears 

As he continued to apologize......... For daring to sit so near. 

He said, ""When I get here...........""I know I must look a sight. 

""But I thought if I could touch you..""Then maybe our souls might unite."" 

I was silent for a moment............ Knowing whatever was said 

Would pale in comparison... I spoke from my heart, not my head. 

""Oh, you've touched me,"" I said......""And taught me, in part; 

""That the best of any man............""Is what is found in his heart."" 

The rest, I thought,................. This shoe man will never know. 

Like just how thankful I really am... That his dirty old shoe touched my soul 

You are special to me and you have made a difference in my 
life. 

I respect you, and truly cherish you. 
Send this to your friends, 

 No matter how often you talk, 

Or how close you are, 
And send it to the person who sent it to you. 

 Let old friends know you haven't forgotten them, and tell 

new friends you never will. 

 Remember, everyone needs a friend. 

Someday you might feel like you have no friends at all. 
Just remember this e-mail and take comfort in knowing that 

someone out there cares about you..... and always will."

<P>Don't Laugh at me- Peter Yarrow</P><PRE style=""FONT: 12px arial"">I'm a little boy with glasses
The one they call the geek
A little girl who never smiles
'Cause I've got braces on my teeth
And I know how it feels
To cry myself to sleep.

I'm that kid on every playground
Who's always chosen last
A single teenage mother
Tryin' to overcome my past
You don't have to be my friend
Is it too much to ask?

Chorus:
Don't laugh at me, don't call me names
Don't get your pleasure from my pain
In God's eyes we're all the same
Someday we'll all have perfect wings
Don't laugh at me.

I'm the cripple on the corner
You pass me on the street
I wouldn't be out here beggin'
If I had enough to eat
And don't think that I don't notice
That our eyes never meet.

I lost my wife and little boy
Someone crossed that yellow line
The day we laid 'em in the ground
Is the day I lost my mind
Right now I'm down to holdin'
This little cardboard sign.

Chorus:
Don't laugh at me, don't call me names
Don't get your pleasure from my pain
In God's eyes we're all the same
Someday we'll all have perfect wings
Don't laugh at me.

I'm fat, I'm thin, I'm short, I'm tall
I'm deaf, I'm blind, hey aren't we all?

Chorus:
Don't laugh at me, don't call me names
Don't get your pleasure from my pain
In God's eyes we're all the same
Someday we'll all have perfect wings

Camp Lajeune, all through high school and before that
So I don't mind tellin' you, I'm scared to death
The doctor is goin' in on the 25th 
It's the same thing my daddy had 
Thank God they caught it fast

But if something should happen 
Stop in some time and say hello to Catherine 
You and Marianne could always keep her laughing 
Because shes gonna need a lot of that 
Take her out to a movie 
It's gonna take sometime before shes back on her feet. 
I know you think I'll be fine and I'm talkin crazy 
But theres always that chance 
That's why I'm askin 
If something should happen 

Little Nathan is growing up so fast 
This November he'll turn 10 
He wants to play quarterback. 
I'm supposed to coach his team this fall 
But I may not get to afterall 
He's gonna need someone to catch a pass 
And to throw it back 

If something should happen 
Oh, promise me you'll take that boy out campin 
Throw a line out in the water every now and then 
Answer any questions that he has 
Maybe once he gets older 
You can sit and have that first cold beer together 
And tell him a couple stories on his father 
He's always known your my best friend
That's why I'm askin'
If something should happen 

I hope I live until I'm 80 
And I get to see my son get married 
And have babies 
And make a million more memories with my wife
Yeah, buddy I pray you're right 
But if it's my time to leave 
Could you watch over them for me? 

If something should happen [6x] </PRE></PRE>"

We haven't&nbsp;heard back from the people or the realtor &nbsp;yet which is really odd because realtors are suppose to reply like ASAP but uh they haven't.&nbsp; It's a really really ugly house but my parents are super excited about ""fixing it up"" haha.

Verse 1:
When you cry be sure, to dry your eyes
Cause better days are sure to come.

And when you smile be sure, to smile wide
And don't let them know that they have won.

And when you walk, walk with pride
Don't show the hurt inside because the pain will soon be gone.

Chorus:
And when you dream, dream big.
As big as the ocean blue.

Cause when you dream it might come true. 
And when you dream, dream big.

Verse 2:
And when you laugh be sure, to laugh outloud 
Cause it will carry, all your cares away.

And when you see, see the beauty all around and in yourself
And it will help you feel okay.

And when you pray, pray for strength 
To help you carry on when the troubles come your way.

And when you laugh, be sure (dream big) to laugh outloud

You're in a better place, 
I've heard a thousand times 
And at least a thousand times 
I've rejoiced for you 
But the reason why I'm broken, 
the reason why I cry 
Is how long must I wait to be with you 

I close my eyes and I see your face 
If home's where my heart is then I'm out of place 
Lord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow 
I've never been more homesick than now 

Help me Lord cause I don't understand your ways 
The reason why I wonder if I'll ever know 
But, even if you showed me, the hurt would be the same 
Cause I'm still here so far away from home 

I close my eyes and I see your face 
If home's where my heart is then I'm out of place 
Lord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow 
I've never been more homesick than now 

In Christ, there are no goodbye 
And in Christ, there is no end 
So I'll hold onto Jesus with all that I have 
To see you again 
To see you again 

And I close my eyes and I see your face 
If home's where my heart is then I'm out of place 
Lord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow 
Won't you give me strength to make it through somehow 
Won't you give me strength to make it through somehow 

I've never been more homesick than now"

"event","It's so interesting.  When we were playing truth or dare the other night, everyone had to tell who they currently liked and I didn't answer because I don't like anyone at the moment.  It's been quite a while since I've liked anyone and it's really kinda cool because I've been putting God before all the guys and drama and everything else (well most everything:() and life's going just fine.  I miss some of my friends though cuz high school's changed a lot of us and we sit in different places at lunch, hang out with different people and just are altogether different people than we were in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. So to those of you who I haven't talked to in a while- I miss you guys.  I hope everything's going alright for you.  Email me or leave a comment, or better yet, call me on my cell anytime, if you wanna talk. Just to say hi.  I miss being able to do that kinda thing. Like just call people to say ""hey how was your day?"" but it's ok. 

I'm gunna go color my veggie tales coloring book then go to sleep cuz I'm real tired from working out at the gym with my hot friend. OH LA LA CREME.

"event","From a book called ""God doesn't believe in atheists""(people who don't believe in God).  It's a really awesome entry so you should all read it even if you don't believe in God I encourage you to read the whole thing.

Chapter One - Who Made God? 

Someone with dry wit once made me laugh when he mumbled, ""Come in, boat number nine. Please come in, boat number nine. Boat number nine, can you hear me? Wait a minute--we don't have a boat number nine! Boat number six - are you in trouble?"" 

It amazes me that people can have a belief in the existence of God, and yet not think for a minute that something is radically wrong in our world. They can smile while boat number six sits upside-down in the water, slowly sinking. Let's look at an average day on God's fair earth. The day dawns to find that (according to UNICEF), 20,000 children have starved to death during the night. Another 20,000 children and many thousands of adults will die today of severe malnutrition. Nothing new there. Thousands of people will die from snake bites, poisonous spiders, attacks by sharks (an average of twenty-eight per year), scorpion bites, being eaten by lions, tigers, and devoured by other man-eating killers, not to mention blood-sucking mosquitoes and leeches. 

Perhaps today we will have a surprise volcanic eruption, or an earthquake to crush families to death beneath the debris of their homes. Cancerous diseases will continue to take their toll and cause thousands to die in agony. Multitudes will perish from fatal ailments that have always plagued mankind, from asthma to typhoid to leprosy to heart disease. Today, human beings will be struck by lightning, drowned in floods, stung to death by killer bees, killed by hurricanes and tornadoes, tormented by blights, pestilence and infestations. They will be afflicted, devastated and brought to ruin. 

The fact is, there are only three alternatives to explain all this suffering: 
1. There is no God, as evidenced by the chaos.
2. God is totally incompetent and can't control His creation (or won't, which makes Him a tyrant).
3. Another explanation exists, one which the Bible gives for the state of the world. 
Let's take a rational, logical look at the first of these three possibilities. It is the basis of a philosophy commonly called ""atheism."" 

Faith Is for Wimps
From my own experience and from listening to many objections to Christianity, I have found that the subject of faith is often offensive to the nonbeliever. My own thinking was that faith was for the weak-minded, for little old ladies, and for those near death. Yet every belief you and I have about history, other countries, science, biology, etc., exists because of faith. You only believe what you believe because you believed the person who told you the information you believe. You don't know who discovered America. You simply have faith that what was told to you is indeed true. Neither do you know if General Custer died at the hands of Indians, or if Napoleon really existed. 

We can't live without faith. Try it. Say to yourself, ""Today, I refuse to exercise any faith at all."" Then before you eat your corn flakes, go through every flake, scientifically testing it before you eat it. Refuse to trust that the manufacturers have obeyed health regulations and mixed the ingredients correctly. Do the same tests on the milk before you pour it on the corn flakes, in faith. You don't know that the milk processors have done their job and given you pure milk. They may have mixed in something that could be harmful to your health. Don't trust the sugar producers either. God only knows what they did while they were processing the sugar. Check the microscope and other tools used for your analysis. How can you really trust that the information you gather from them is reliable? Don't trust your weight to the chair at the breakfast table. Don't believe today's weather report or any news item until you actually go to the proper location and see for yourself if what they would have you believe is true. Even then you will have to trust your natural senses (which can't always be trusted). 

Before you drink your coffee, don't trust that the cup is perfectly clean. Wash it out yourself. Don't use untested water, in faith. We really don't know what's in it nowadays. It may be contaminated. Analyze the coffee. If you decide to take a taxi to work, you will have to trust your life to the vehicle and the taxi driver, and trust the other drivers to stay on their side of the road. You will have to trust elevators, stairways, airplanes, the post office, and banks. Believe me -- we either live with faith or fall victim to paranoia. 

If, then, faith so evidently surrounds us, why should it be so offensive? It is simply because faith is as essential to the spiritual realm as oxygen is to the natural realm. The professing atheist thinks that if he can get rid of any thought of faith, he can get rid of Christianity. In trying to do so, he saws through the branch he is sitting on. His own faith in the erroneous information he has, makes him think he is atheistic in his beliefs. 

Trump Card
I have found from experience that the popular atheist's question, ""Who made God?"" doesn't deserve to have a question mark. It is usually presented as a statement. The questioner is persuaded that such a question cannot be answered. A twinkle is usually seen in his eye as he tosses what he thinks is his trump card onto the table. He gambles his very soul on the belief that there is no higher card--that it cannot be answered. 

Actually, the explanation is very simple. Does space have an end? If it does--if there is a brick wall at the end of space that reads ""The End,"" I want to know what's behind the brick wall. By faith you and I are forced to believe that no matter in which direction we set off, space will never end. It just goes on and on and on--forever. It has no beginning or end. It hurts the brain to think about such a state, but we have no choice but to accept that fact by faith. 

God also has no beginning and no end. But with God, we have a little more information than we have with space. Time is a dimension that God has created and it is to this dimension that mankind is subjected. We have to wait for time to pass. We can't jump ahead even one second in time. We are enslaved in its power. It is because we are in time that reason demands a beginning and an end. It hurts the brain to think of any other dimension. 

God is not subject to the dimension of time. He dwells in eternity. The Bible tells us that a day to the Lord is as a thousand years to us (see Psalm 90:4 & 2 Peter 3:8). You can prove this for yourself by studying the prophecies of the Bible mentioned in a later chapter. God can flick through time as you and I flick through the pages of a history book. If you find this hard to believe, even when confronted with the evidence of biblical prophecies, you will find it to be true one day. The Scriptures tell us that God will eventually withdraw time, and we will then dwell in eternity. 

The Christian is told that he understands ""by faith."" This happens if I have major surgery. I trust a surgeon, even though I have no real understanding of how he is going to operate. I have to trust him or there will be no operation. I understand that he has the ability to make me well, so I have faith in him. 

In the same manner, I trust God. Many have died at the hands of surgeons, but no one perishes in the hands of God. God's ability is boundless and His promises are ""both sure and steadfast, an anchor of the soul"" (Hebrews 6:19). Doctors and pilots will fail you, friends you trust will disappoint you, elevators will let you down, but the promises of Almighty God are utterly trustworthy. This may be hard for you to appreciate at this time, but I want to encourage you to have an open mind as we look closely at the subject of atheism. 

The Atheist Test
I don't believe in atheists. This isn't because I haven't met people who claim the title, but because such a person cannot be. Let's imagine that you are a professing atheist. I will ask you two questions: First, do you know the combined weight of all the sand on all the beaches of Hawaii? I think I can safely assume that you don't. This brings us to the second question: Do you know how many hairs are on the back of a fully grown male Tibetan yak? Probably not. I think, therefore, that it is reasonable for me to conclude that there are some things you don't know. It is important to ask these questions because there are some people who think they know everything. 

Let's say that you know an incredible one percent of all the knowledge in the universe. To know 100 percent, you would have to know everything. There wouldn't be a rock in the universe that you would not be intimately familiar with, or a grain of sand that you would not be aware of. You would know everything that has happened in history, from that which is common knowledge to the minor details of the secret love life of Napoleon's great-grandmother's black cat's fleas. You would know every hair of every head, and every thought of every heart. All history would be laid out before you, because you would be omniscient (all-knowing). 

Bear in mind that one of the greatest scientists who ever lived, Thomas Edison, said, ""We do not know a millionth of one percent about anything."" Let me repeat: Let's say that you have an incredible one percent of all the knowledge in the universe. Would it be possible, in the ninety-nine percent of the knowledge that you haven't yet come across, that there might be ample evidence to prove the existence of God? If you are reasonable, you will be forced to admit that it is possible. Somewhere, in the knowledge you haven't yet discovered, there could be enough evidence to prove that God does exist. 

Let's look at the same thought from another angle. If I were to make an absolute statement such as, ""There is no gold in China,"" what is needed for that statement to be proven true? I need absolute or total knowledge. I need to have information that there is no gold in any rock, in any river, in the ground, in any store, in any ring, or in any mouth (gold filling) in China. If there is one speck of gold in China, then my statement is false and I have no basis for it. I need absolute knowledge before I can make an absolute statement. Conversely, for me to say, ""There is gold in China,"" I don't need to have all knowledge. I just need to have seen a speck of gold in the country, and the statement is then true. 

To say categorically, ""There is no God,"" is to make an absolute statement. For the statement to be true, I must know for certain that there is no God in the entire universe. No human being has all knowledge. Therefore, none of us is able to truthfully make this assertion. 

If you insist upon disbelief in God, what you must say is, ""Having the limited knowledge I have at present, I believe that there is no God."" Owing to a lack of knowledge on your part, you don't know if God exists. So, in the strict sense of the word, you cannot be an atheist. The only true qualifier for the title is the One who has absolute knowledge, and why on earth would God want to deny His own existence? 

The professing atheist is what is commonly known as an ""agnostic""--one who claims he ""doesn't know"" if God exists. It is interesting to note that the Latin equivalent for the Greek word is ""ignoramus."" The Bible tells us that this ignorance is ""willful"" (Psalm 10:4). It's not that a person can't find God, but that he won't. It has been rightly said that the ""atheist"" can't find God for the same reason a thief can't find a policeman. He knows that if he admits that there is a God, he is admitting that he is ultimately responsible to Him. This is not a pleasant thought for some. 

It is said that Mussolini (the Italian dictator), once stood on a pinnacle and cried, ""'God, if you are there, strike me dead!"" When God didn't immediately bow to his dictates, Mussolini then concluded that there was no God. However, his prayer was answered some time later."

</CENTER>
<P><FONT face=""Trebuchet MS, Times, Arial"" color=#ffcc99 size=4>A man was sleeping at night in his cabin when suddenly his room filled with light and the Savior appeared. The Lord told the man he had work for him to do, and showed him a large rock in front of his cabin. The Lord explained that the man was to push against the rock with all his might. This the man did, day after day. For many years he toiled from sun up to sun down, his shoulders set squarely against the cold, massive surface of the unmoving rock, pushing with all his might.<BR><BR>Each night the man returned to his cabin sore, and worn out, feeling that his whole day had been spent in vain. Seeing that the man was showing signs of discouragement, the Adversary decided to enter the picture by placing thoughts into the man's weary mind: ""You have been pushing against that rock for a long time, and it hasn't budged. Why kill yourself over this? You are never going to move it."" Thus giving the man the impression that the task was impossible and that he was a failure, these thoughts discouraged and disheartened the man.<BR><BR>""Why kill myself over this?"" he thought. ""I'll just put in my time, giving just the minimum effort and that will be good enough."" And that is what he planned to do until one day he decided to make it a matter of prayer and take his troubled thoughts to the Lord. ""Lord"" he said, ""I have labored long and hard in your service, putting all my strength to do that which you have asked. Yet, after all this time, I have not even budged that rock by half a millimeter. What is wrong? Why am I failing?""<BR><BR>The Lord responded compassionately, ""My child, when I asked you to serve me and you accepted, I told you that your task was to push against the rock with all your strength, which you have done. Never once did I mention to you that I expected you to move it. Your task was to push. And now you come to me, with your strength spent, thinking that you have failed. But, is that really so? Look at yourself. Your arms are strong and muscled, your back sinew and brown, your hands are callused from constant pressure, and your legs have become massive and hard. Through opposition you have grown much and your abilities now surpass that which you used to have. Yet you haven't moved the rock. But your calling was to be obedient and to push and to exercise your faith and trust in My wisdom. This you have done. I, my friend, will now move the rock.""<BR><BR>At times, when we hear a word from God, we tend to use our own intellect to decipher what He wants, when actually what God wants is just simple obedience and faith in Him. By all means, exercise the faith that moves mountains, but know that it is still God who moves the mountains.<BR><BR>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes... Romans 1:16</FONT>

"event","For those who already have children past this age, this is hilarious. For 
those who have children this age, this is not funny. For those who have 
children nearing this age, this is a warning. For those who have not yet had 
children, this is birth control. 

The following came from an anonymous Mother in Austin, Texas (Those kids 
born in Texas!) Things I've learned from my Children (honest & no kidding): 


1. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. ft. house 4 
inches deep. 
2. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with 
rollerblades, they can ignite. 
3. A 3-year old's voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded restaurant. 
4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong 
enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a Superman 
cape. It is strong enough, however, if tied to a paint can, to spread paint 
on all four walls of a 20x20 ft. room. 
5. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When using 
a ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you 
get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. 
6. The glass in windows (even double-pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit by a 
ceiling fan. 
7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words ""uh oh,"" it's already too 
late. 
8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it. 
9. A six-year old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36-year 
old man says they can only do it in the movies. 
10. Certain Lego's will pass through the digestive tract of a 4-year old. 
11. Play dough and microwave should not be used in the same sentence. 
12. Super glue is forever. 
13. No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't 
walk on water. 
14. Pool filters do not like Jell-O. 
15. VCR's do not eject PB&J sandwiches even though TV commercials show they 
do. 
16. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes. 
17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving. 
18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is. 
19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do not like 
ovens. 
20. The fire department in Austin, TX has a 5-minute response time. 
21. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earthworms dizzy. 
22. It will, however, make cats dizzy. 
23. Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy. 
24. The mind of a 6-year old is wonderful. First grade...true story: One day 
the first grade teacher was reading the story of the Three Little Pigs to 
her class. She came to the part of the story where the first pig was trying 
to accumulate the building materials for his home. She read,""...And so the 
pig went up to the man with the wheelbarrow full of straw and said, 'Pardon 
me sir, but may I have some of that straw to build my house?'"" The teacher 
paused then asked the class, ""And what do you think that man said?"" One 
little boy raised his hand and said, ""I think he said...'Oh my goodness! A 
talking pig!'"" The teacher was unable to teach for the next 10 minutes. 
25. 60% of men who read this will try mixing the Clorox and brake fluid."

"event","It's funny how in middle school and in high school (at least the first few years of hs) boy/girl friends how much they love eachother.  Can you really truly understand what it's like to LOVE that person?  I mean, sure I love some of my friends and I would be so sad if they ever moved away or died or something. I just don't think people can truly and honestly love their bfs/gfs in ""that way"" until they're like 18 or older.   Know what I mean? And also, one of them just says it to the other because they were told that the other person loved them, so they felt like they had to say that they loved them back. It's like pressure, except not as.... noticeable. Ya know?  Anyhow, we've got plenty of time to find that one special person out there, why rush things?

He will take away my sin

amazing grace, how sweet the sound
once was lost, but now i'm found
once was blind, but now i see
amazing grace saved a wretch like me
alleluhia, alleluhia....."

You are too critical
You are too practical and down to earth
You are intelligent but distant
You are a drama queen (or king)
You seek adventure when you are in pain.
You act like the victim
You are impressed by status symbols
You'll do a lot to avoid confrontation
You think first and then act much later

I tried to put all of the stories on here with those cut things butttt it didn't work too well. So please please check out all of these sites and just take the time to think about what each one means.  They are really meaningful and powerful. Too cool. I seriously just spent an hour or more reading the stories. 

God bless you all :D"

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After living a ""decent"" life my time on earth came to an end. The first thing I remember is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of what I thought to be a court house. The doors opened and I was instructed to come in and have a seat by the defense table.<BR><BR>As I looked around I saw the ""Prosecutor"". He was a villainous looking gent who snarled as he stared at me, he definitely was the most evil person I have ever seen. I sat down and looked to my left and there sat my lawyer, a kind and gentle looking man whose appearance seemed very familiar to me.<BR><BR>The corner door flew open and there appeared the Judge in full flowing robes. He commanded an awesome presence as he moved across the room and I couldn't take my eyes off of him. As he took his seat behind the bench he said, ""Let us begin.""<BR><BR>The prosecutor rose and said, ""My name is Satan and I am here to show you why this human belongs in hell."" He proceeded to tell of lies that I told, things that I stole and in the past when I cheated others. Satan told of other terrible perversions that were once in my life and the more he spoke, the further down in my seat I sank. I was so embarrassed that I couldn't look at anyone, even my own lawyer, as the Devil told of sins that even I had completely forgotten about.<BR><BR>As upset as I was at Satan for telling all these things about me, I was equally upset at my representative who sat there silently not offering any form of defense at all. I know I had been guilty of those things, but I had done some good in my life - couldn't that at least equal out part of the harm I've done?<BR><BR>Satan finished with a fury and said, ""This human belongs in hell, they are guilty of all that I have charged and there is not a person who can prove otherwise. When it was his turn, my lawyer first asked if he might approach the bench. The judge allowed this over the strong objection of Satan, and beckoned him to come forward.<BR><BR>As he got up and started walking I was able to see him now in his full splendor and majesty. Now I realized why he seemed so familiar. This was Jesus representing me, my Lord and my Savior. He stopped at the bench and softly said to the judge, ""Hi Dad,"" and then he turned to address the court.<BR><BR>""Satan was correct in saying that this person had sinned, I won't deny any of these allegations. And yes, the wages of sins is death and they deserve to be punished."" Jesus took a deep breath and turned to his Father with outstretched arms and proclaimed, ""However, I died on the cross so that this person might have eternal life and they have accepted me as their Savior, so they are mine.""<BR><BR>My Lord continued with, ""Their name is written in the book of life and no one can snatch them from me. Satan still does not understand yet, this person is not to be given justice but rather mercy."" As Jesus sat down, he quietly paused, looked at his Father and replied, ""There is nothing else that needs to be done, I've done it all."" <BR><BR>The Judge lifted his mighty hand and slammed the gavel down and the following words bellowed from his lips - ""This soul is free - the penalty for them has already been paid in full. Case dismissed!""<BR><BR>As my Lord led me away I could hear Satan ranting and raving, ""I won't give up, I'll win the next one."" I asked Jesus as he gave me my instructions where to go next, ""Have you ever lost a case?"" Christ lovingly smiled and said, ""Everyone that has come to me and asked me to represent them has received the same verdict as you...Paid in Full.""<BR><BR>This is a modern day take on the Easter Story. Each of us has committed the ""crime of sin"". Satan would like to accuse us, make us feel guilty for the things we've done. But the good news is that Jesus, through his mercy, paid our penalty for us. This trial is acted out in the hearts and minds of men day in and day out, and will continue to do so until Jesus comes back to gather us believers into one body. <BR><BR>What would your defense be if you were to stand trial for your life today? Would Jesus be your representative? What will your verdict be? Are you not sure?

<P>Don't undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others<BR>It is because we are different that each of us is special.<BR><BR>Don't set your goals by what other people deem important.<BR><BR>Don't take for granted the things closest to your heart. Cling to them as you would your life, for without them, life is meaningless.<BR><BR>Don't let your life slip through your fingers by living in the past or for the future. By living your life one day at a time, you live all the days of your life.<BR><BR>Don't give up when you still have something to give. Nothing is really over....until the moment you stop trying.<BR><BR>Don't be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect. It is this fragile thread that binds us to each other.<BR><BR>Don't be afraid to take risks. It is by taking chances that we learn how to be brave.<BR><BR>Don't shut love out of your life by saying it's impossible to find. The quickest way to receive love is to give love. The fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly: and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.<BR><BR>Don't ever dismiss your dreams. To be without dreams is to be without hope! To be without hope is to be without purpose.<BR><BR>Don't run through life so fast that you forget not only where you've been, but also where you're going. Life is not a race, but a journey to be savored each step of the way.<BR></P>

<P>One day a man was walking on a beach at low tide. All the way up and down the beach, for as far as he could see, there were starfish washed up on the shore, left to die by the receding water. As he walked along the water's edge, he saw a little boy bending down, picking up the starfish, and throwing them back into the ocean.<BR><BR>As the man approached the little boy he said, ""Why do you waste your efforts trying to save these starfish? Don't you see that what you are doing doesn't matter, since there are too many starfish for you to possibly save them all?""<BR><BR>With that the little boy bent down, picked up a starfish and hurled it back into the ocean. Then he looked up at the man and said, ""It mattered to that one.""<BR><BR></P>

<P>With all the billions of people in the world, each with their own sins and problems, it may seem like there are too many of us for God to care about us all. But, the Bible teaches us that each one of us are special and worthy in His eyes. God does not wish that any one of us spend eternity away from Him, so He sacrificed his son, Jesus, so that each one of us might be saved. He would have done so even to save just you. Each of us matters.<BR></P>

<P>An article in National Geographic several years ago provided a penetrating picture of God's wings...<BR><BR>After a forest fire in Yellowstone National Park, forest rangers began their trek up a mountain to assess the inferno's damage. One ranger found a bird literally petrified in ashes, perched statuesquely on the ground at the base of a tree. Somewhat sickened by the eerie sight, he knocked over the bird with a stick.<BR><BR>When he struck it, three tiny chicks scurried from under their dead mother's wings. The loving mother, keenly aware of impending disaster, had carried her offspring to the base of the tree and had gathered them under her wings, instinctively knowing that the toxic smoke would rise. She could have flown to safety but had refused to abandon her babies. When the blaze had arrived and the heat had scorched her small body, the mother had remained steadfast. Because she had been willing to die, those under the cover of her wings would live.<BR><BR></P>

<P><BR>Being loved this much should make a difference in your life. Remember that God loves you and wishes to protect you. Then, be different because of it. </P>

<P>Louise Redden, a poorly dressed lady with a look of defeat on her face, walked into a grocery store. She approached the owner of the store in a most humble manner and asked if he would let her charge a few groceries. She softly explained that her husband was very ill and unable to work, they had seven children and they needed food.<BR><BR>John Longhouse, the grocer, scoffed at her and requested that she leave his store. Visualizing the family needs, she said, ""Please, sir! I will bring you the money just as soon as I can."" John told her he could not give her credit, as she did not have a charge account at his store.<BR><BR>Standing beside the counter was a customer who overheard the conversation between the two. The customer walked forward and told the grocer that he would stand good for whatever she needed for her family. The grocer said, in a very reluctant voice, ""Do you have a grocery list?"" Louise replied, ""Yes sir."" ""O.K."" he said, ""put your grocery list on the scales and whatever your grocery list weighs, I will give you that amount in groceries.""<BR><BR>Louise hesitated a moment. With a bowed head, she reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper and scribbled something on it. She then laid the piece of paper on the scale carefully with her head still bowed. The eyes of the grocer and the customer showed amazement when the scales went down and stayed down. The grocer, staring at the scales, turned slowly to the customer and said begrudgingly, ""I can't believe it.""<BR><BR>The customer smiled and the grocer started putting the groceries on the other side of the scales. The scale did not balance so he continued to put more and more groceries on them until the scales would hold no more. The grocery stood there in utter disgust. Finally, he grabbed the piece of paper from the scales and looked at it with greater amazement.<BR><BR>It was not a grocery list, it was a prayer which said: ""Dear Lord, you know my needs and I am leaving this in your hands."" The grocer gave her the groceries that he had gathered and stood in stunned silence. Louise thanked him and left the store. The customer handed a fifty-dollar bill to the grocer and said, ""It was worth every penny of it.""<BR><BR>It was sometime later that the grocer discovered the scales were broken; therefore, only God knows how much a prayer weighs. </P>

<P><lj-cut text=""Keep your fork""> </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There was a woman who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and had been given three months to live. So as she was getting her things in order, she contacted her pastor and had him come to her house to discuss certain aspects of her final wishes. She told him which songs she wanted sung at the service, what scriptures she would like read, and what outfit she wanted to be buried in. The woman also requested to be buried with her favorite Bible.<BR><BR>Everything was in order and the pastor was preparing to leave when the woman suddenly remembered something very important to her. ""There's one more thing,"" she said excitedly. ""What's that?"" came the pastor's reply."" This is very important,"" the woman continued. ""I want to be buried witha fork in my right hand.""<BR><BR>The pastor stood looking at the woman, not knowing quite what to say."" That surprises you, doesn't it?"" the woman asked. ""Well, to be honest, I'm puzzled by the request,"" said the pastor. The woman explained. <BR><BR>""In all my years of attending church socials and potluck dinners, I always remember that when the dishes of the main course were being cleared, someone would inevitably lean over and say,'Keepyour fork.' It was my favorite part because I knew that something better was coming ... like velvety chocolate cake or deep-dish apple pie. Something wonderful, and with substance! So, I just want people to see me there in that casket with a fork in my hand and I want them to wonder ""What's with the fork?'. Then I want you to tell them: 'Keep your fork....the best is yet to come.'""<BR><BR>The pastor's eyes welled up with tears of joy as he hugged the woman good-bye. He knew this would be one of the last times he would see her before her death. But he also knew that the woman had a better grasp of heaven than he did. She KNEW that something better was coming.<BR><BR>At the funeral people were walking by the woman's casket and they saw the pretty dress she was wearing and her favorite Bible and the fork placed in her right hand. Over and over, the pastor heard the question, ""What's with the fork?"" And over and over he smiled.<BR><BR>During his message, the pastor told the people of the conversation he had with the woman shortly before she died. He also told them about the fork and about what it symbolized to her. The pastor told the people how he could not stop thinking about the fork and told them that they probably would not be able to stop thinking about it either. He was right. So the next time you reach down for your fork, let it remind you oh so gently, that the best is yet to come. </P>

<P>Two traveling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the mansion's guest room. Instead the angels were given a space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied...""Things aren't always what they seem.""<BR><BR>The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable farmer and his wife. After sharing what little food they had, the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their sole income, lay dead in the field.<BR><BR>The younger angel was infuriated and asked the older angel, ""How could you have let this happen!? The first man had everything, yet you helped him,"" she accused. ""The second family had little, but was willing to share everything, and you let their cow die.""<BR><BR>""Things aren't always what they seem,"" the older angel replied. ""When we stayed in the basement of the mansion, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune, I sealed the wall so he wouldn't find it.<BR><BR>Then last night as we slept in the farmers bed, the angel of death came for his wife.

<P><lj-cut text=""The Envelope""> </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It's just a small, white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree. No name, no identification, no inscription. It has peeked through the branches of our tree for the past 10 years or so.<BR><BR>It all began because my husband Mike hated Christmas --- oh, not the true meaning of Christmas, but the commercial aspects of it-overspending... the frantic running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and the dusting powder for Grandma, the gifts given in desperation because you couldn't think of anything else.<BR><BR>Knowing he felt this way, I decided one year to bypass the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so forth. I reached for something special just for Mike. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was wrestling at the junior level at the school he attended; and shortly before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church, mostly black. These youngsters, dressed in sneakers so ragged that shoestrings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, presented a sharp contrast to our boys in their spiffy blue and gold uniforms and sparkling new wrestling shoes.<BR><BR>As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without headgear, a kind of light helmet designed to protect a wrestler's ears. It was a luxury the ragtag team obviously could not afford. Well, we ended up walloping them. We took every weight class. And as each of their boys got up from the mat, he swaggered around in his tatters with false bravado, a kind of street pride that couldn't acknowledge defeat.<BR><BR>Mike, seated beside me, shook his head sadly, ""I wish just one of them could have won,"" he said. ""They have a lot of potential, but losing like this could take the heart right out of them."" Mike loved kids - all kids - and he knew them, having coached little league football, baseball and lacrosse. That's when the idea for his present came.<BR><BR>That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an assortment of wrestling headgear and shoes and sent them anonymously to the inner-city church. On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me.<BR><BR>His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year and in succeeding years. For each Christmas, I followed the tradition --- one year sending a group of mentally handicapped youngsters to a hockey game, another year a check to a pair of elderly brothers whose home had burned to the ground the week before Christmas, and on and on.<BR><BR>The envelope became the highlight of our Christmas. It was always the last thing opened on Christmas morning and our children, ignoring their new toys, would stand with wide-eyed anticipation as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to reveal its contents.<BR><BR>As the children grew, the toys gave way to more practical presents, but the envelope never lost its allure. The story doesn't end there. You see, we lost Mike last year due to dreaded cancer. When Christmas rolled around, I was still so wrapped in grief that I barely got the tree up. But Christmas Eve found me placing an envelope on the tree, and in the morning, it was joined by three more.<BR><BR>Each of our children, unbeknownst to the others, had placed an envelope on the tree for their dad. The tradition has grown and someday will expand even further with our grandchildren standing around the tree with wide-eyed anticipation watching as their fathers take down the envelope. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us.<BR><BR>May we all remember Christ, who is the reason for this season, and the true Christmas spirit this year and always. </P>

<P><lj-cut text=""Three Trees""> </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once there were three trees on a hill in the woods. They were discussing their hopes and dreams when the first tree said, ""Someday I hope to be a treasure chest. I could be filled with gold, silver and precious gems. I could be decorated with intricate carving and everyone would see the beauty.""<BR><BR>Then the second tree said, ""Someday I will be a mighty ship. I will take kings and queens across the waters and sail to the corners of the world. Everyone will feel safe in me because of the strength of my hull.""<BR><BR>Finally the third tree said, ""I want to grow to be the tallest and straightest tree in the forest. People will see me on top of the hill and look up to my branches, and think of the heavens and God and how close to them I am reaching. I will be the greatest tree of all time and people will always remember me.""<BR><BR>After a few years of praying that their dreams would come true, a group of woodsmen came upon the trees. When one came to the first tree he said,""This looks like a strong tree, I think I should be able to sell the wood to a carpenter."" and he began cutting it down. The tree was happy, because he knew that the carpenter would make him into a treasure chest.<BR><BR>At the second tree a woodsman said, ""This looks like a strong tree. I should be able to sell it to the shipyard."" The second tree was happy because he knew he was on his way to becoming a mighty ship.<BR><BR>When the woodsmen came upon the third tree, the tree was frightened, because he knew that if they cut him down his dreams would not come true. One of the woodsmen said, ""I don't need anything special from my tree so I'll take this one"", and he cut it down.<BR><BR>When the first tree arrived at the carpenters, he was made into a feed box for animals. He was then placed in a barn and filled with hay. This was not at all what he had prayed for. The second tree was cut and made into a small fishing boat. His dreams of being a mighty ship and carrying kings had come to an end. The third tree was cut into large pieces and left alone in the dark.<BR><BR>The years went by, and the trees forgot about their dreams. Then one day, a man and woman came to the barn. She gave birth and they placed the baby in the hay in the feed box that was made from the first tree. The man wished that he could have made a crib for the baby, but this manger would have to do. The tree could feel the importance of this event and knew that it had held the greatest treasure of all time.<BR><BR>Years later, a group of men got in the fishing boat made from the second tree. One of them was tired and went to sleep. While they were out on the water, a great storm arose and the tree didn't think it was strong enough to keep the men safe. The men woke the sleeping man, and he stood and said, ""Peace"" and the storm stopped. At this time, the tree knew that it had carried the King of Kings in its boat.<BR><BR>Finally, someone came and got the third tree. It was carried through the streets as the people mocked the man who was carrying it. When they came to a stop, the man was nailed to the tree and raised in the air to die at the top of a hill. When Sunday came, the tree came to realize that it was strong enough to stand at the top of the hill and be as close to God as was possible, because Jesus had been crucified on it.<BR><BR>The moral of this story is that when things don't seem to be going your way, always know that God has a plan for you. If you place your trust in Him, He will give you great gifts. Each of the trees got what they wanted, just not in the way they had imagined. We don't always know what God's plans are for us. We just know that His ways are not our ways, but His ways are always best. </P>

<P><lj-cut text=""White Roses""> </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I hurried into the local department store to grab some last minute Christmas gifts. I looked at all the people and grumbled to myself. I would be in here forever and I just had so much to do. Christmas was beginning to become such a drag. I kinda wished that I could just sleep through Christmas.<BR><BR>But I hurried the best I could through all the people to the toy department. Once again I kind of mumbled to myself at the prices of all these toys, and wondered if the grandkids would even play with them.<BR><BR>I found myself in the doll aisle. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a little boy of about five holding a lovely doll. He kept touching her hair and he held her so gently. I could not seem to help myself. I just kept looking over at the little boy and wondered who the doll was for. I watched him turn to a woman and he called his aunt by name and said, ""Are you sure I don't have enough money?"" She replied a bit impatiently, ""You know that you don't have enough money for it.""<BR><BR>The aunt told the little boy not to go anywhere that she had to go get some other things and would be back in a few minutes. And then she left the aisle. The boy continued to hold the doll. After a bit I asked the boy who the doll was for. He said, ""It is the doll my sister wanted so badly for Christmas. She just knew that Santa would bring it.<BR><BR>""I told him that maybe Santa was going to bring it. He said ""No, Santa can't go where my sister is...I have to give the doll to my Mamma to take to her"". I asked him where his sister was. He looked at me with the saddest eyes and said ""She has gone to be with Jesus"". My Daddy says that Mama is going to have to go be with her.<BR><BR>My heart nearly stopped beating. Then the boy looked at me again and said, I told my Daddy to tell Mama not to go yet. I told him to tell her to wait till I got back from the store"". Then he asked me if I wanted to see his picture. I told him I would love to. He pulled out some pictures he'd had taken at the front of the store. He said ""I want my Mamma to take this with her so she don't ever forget me."" ""I love my Mama so very much and I wish she did not have to leave me"". ""But Daddy says she will need to be with my sister.""<BR><BR>I saw that the little boy had lowered his head and had grown so very quiet. While he was not looking I reached into my purse and pulled out a handful of bills. I asked the little boy, ""Shall we count that money one more time?"" He grew excited and said ""Yes, I just know it has to be enough"".<BR><BR>So I slipped my money in with his and we began to count it. Of course it was plenty for the doll. He softly said, ""Thank you Jesus for giving me enough money."" Then the boy said ""I just asked Jesus to give me enough money to buy this doll so Mama can take it with her to give to my sister. And he heard my prayer. I wanted to ask him for enough to buy my Mama a white rose, but I didn't ask him, but he gave me enough to buy the doll and a rose for my Mama. She loves white roses so very, very much"".<BR><BR>In a few minutes the aunt came back and I wheeled my cart away. I could not keep from thinking about the little boy as I finished my shopping in a totally different spirit than when I had started. I kept remembering a story I had seen in the newspaper several days earlier, about a drunk driver hitting a car and killing a little girl and the Mother was in serious condition. The family was deciding on whether to remove the life support. Now surely this little boy did not belong with that story?<BR><BR>Two days later I read in the paper where the family had disconnected the life support and the young woman had died. I could not forget the little boy and just kept wondering if the two were somehow connected. Later that day, I could not help myself and I went out and bought some white roses and took them to the funeral home where the young woman was. And there she was, holding a lovely white rose, the beautiful doll, and the picture of the little boy in the store. I left there in tears, my life changed forever.<BR><BR>The love that little boy had for his little sister and his mother was overwhelming. And in a split second a drunk driver had ripped the life of that little boy to pieces. Now angels had carried them both off to heaven.... </P>

<P><lj-cut text=""Who will take the son?""> </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A wealthy man and his son loved to collect rare works of art. They had everything in their collection, from Picasso to Raphael. They would often sit together and admire the great works of art. When the Viet Nam conflict broke out, the son went to war. He was very courageous and died in battle while rescuing another soldier. The father was notified and grieved deeply for his only son.<BR><BR>About a month later, just before Christmas, there was a knock at the door. A young man stood at the door with a large package in his hands. He said,""Sir, you don't know me, but I am the soldier for whom your son gave his life. He saved many lives that day, and he was carrying me to safety when a bullet struck him in the heart and he died instantly. He often talked about you, and your love for art.<BR><BR>The young man held out his package. ""I know this isn't much. I'm not really a great artist, but I think your son would have wanted you to have this."" The father opened the package. It was a portrait of his son, painted by the young man. He stared in awe at the way the soldier had captured the personality of his son in the painting. The father was so drawn to the eyes that his own eyes welled up with tears. He thanked the young man and offered to pay him for the picture. ""Oh, no sir, I could never repay what your son did for me. It's a gift.""<BR><BR>The father hung the portrait over his mantle. Every time visitors came to his home he took them to see the portrait of his son before he showed them any of the other great works he had collected.<BR><BR>The man died a few months later. There was to be a great auction of his paintings. Many influential people gathered, excited over seeing the great paintings and having an opportunity to purchase one for their collection. On the platform sat the painting of the son.<BR><BR>The auctioneer pounded his gavel. ""We will start the bidding with this picture of the son. Who will bid for this picture?"" There was silence. Then a voice in the back of the room shouted. ""We want to see the famous paintings. Skip this one."" But the auctioneer persisted. ""Will someone bid for this painting? Who will start the bidding? $100, $200?"" Another voice shouted angrily. ""We didn't come to see this painting. We came to see the Van Goghs, the Rembrandts. Get on with the real bids!""<BR><BR>But still the auctioneer continued. ""The son! The son! Who'll take the son?"" Finally, a voice came from the very back of the room. It was the longtime gardener of the man and his son. ""I'll give $10 for the painting."" Being a poor man, it was all he could afford. ""We have $10, who will bid $20?"" ""Give it to him for $10. Let's see the masters."" ""$10 is the bid, won't someone bid $20?"" The crowd was becoming angry. They didn't want the picture of the son. They wanted the more worthy investments for their collections. The auctioneer pounded the gavel. ""Going once, twice, SOLD for $10!""<BR><BR>A man sitting on the second row shouted. ""Now let's get on with the collection!"" The auctioneer laid down his gavel. ""I'm sorry, the auction is over."" ""What about the paintings?"" ""I am sorry. When I was called to conduct this auction, I was told of a secret stipulation in the will. I was not allowed to reveal that stipulation until this time. Only the painting of the son would be auctioned. Whoever bought that painting would inherit the entire estate, including the paintings. The man who took the son gets every thing!""<BR><BR>God gave His son 2,000 years ago to die on a cruel cross. Much like the auctioneer, His message today is, ""The son, the son, who'll take the son?"" Because, you see, whoever takes the Son gets everything. --author unknown </P>

<P>funn how a $100 ""looks""so big when you take it to church, but so small when you take it to the mall.<BR><BR></P>
<LI>Funny how long it takes to serve God for an hour, but how quickly a team plays 60 minutes of basketball.<BR><BR>
<LI>Funny how long a couple of hours spent at church are, but how short they are when watching a movie.<BR><BR>
<LI>Funny how we can't think of anything to say when we pray, but don't have difficulty thinking of things to talk about to a friend.<BR><BR>
<LI>Funny how we get thrilled when a baseball game goes into extra innings, but we complain when a sermon is longer than the regular time.<BR><BR>
<LI>Funny how hard it is to read a chapter in the Bible, but how easy it is to read 100 pages of a best selling novel.<BR><BR>
<LI>Funny how people want to get a front seat at any game or concert, but scramble to get a back seat at church services.<BR><BR>
<LI>Funny how we need 2 or 3 weeks advance notice to fit a church event into our schedule, but can adjust our schedule for other events at the last moment.<BR><BR>
<LI>Funny how hard it is for people to learn a simple gospel well enough to tell others, but how simple it is for the same people to understand and repeat gossip.<BR><BR>
<LI>Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says.<BR><BR>
<LI>Funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not have to believe, or think, or say, or do anything.<BR><BR>
<LI>Funny how you can send a thousand 'jokes' through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start ending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing.<BR><BR>FUNNY, ISN'T IT ? Are you laughing? Are you thinking? Spread the Word and give thanks to the Lord for He is good! Funny isn't it when you go to forward this message how many on your list are not receiving it because you're not sure they believe in anything? Funny?.........Sad! </LI>"

"event","""And there were sheperds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.  An angel of the lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.  But the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid.  I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all people.  Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.  This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.'
     Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
    ""Glory to God in the highest,
      and on earth peace to men on whom his favor  
            rests.'""

"event","""A Christian friend of mine was killed by a drunk driver. Why does God allow bad things to happen to his people?"" 
 Tony Campolo said is response ""I can understand why you'd ask that question.  But when tragic things happen, we make a mistake if we blame on God.  A friend of mine, the chaplain of a college, was brokenhearted when he found out one of his brightest students, a Christian, had been hit b a bus and killed.  One upset student asked my friend, 'Why did Jesus kill Cliff?' My friend answered, 'You're an intelligent person.  You ought to be able to tell the difference between Jesus and a bus!'""  
 
This was in an extra page in my bible. I think it's important to remember stuff like this.  God doesn't create evil (look at Genesis 1:31 and Timothy 1 4:4 and also look at Romans 8:28)  I just thought this is something people should keep in mind when you start thinking that God made something bad happen and ask ""How could it happen to me?"" well why shouldn't it happen to you? 






When the Sand Runs Out- Rascal Flatts

I spent the morning at an old friend's grave
Flowers and 'Amazing Grace', he was a good man
He spent his whole life spinning his wheels
Never knowing how the real thing feels
He never took a chance or took the time to dance
And I stood there thinking, as I said goodbye
Today is the first day of the rest of my life

I'm gonna stop looking back and starting moving on
And learn how to face my fears
Love with all of my heart, make my mark
I wanna leave something here
Go out on a ledge, without any net
That's what I'm gonna be about
Yeah, I wanna be running
When the sand runs out

Cause people do it everyday
Promise themselves they're gonna change
I've been there, but I'm changing from the inside out
That was then and this is now
I'm a new man, yeah, I'm a brand new man
And when they carve my stone, they'll write these words
Here lies a man who lived life for all that it's worth

I'm gonna stop looking back and starting moving on
And learn how to face my fears
Love with all of my heart, make my mark
I wanna leave something here
Go out on a ledge, without any net
That's what I'm gonna be about
Yeah, I wanna be running
When the sand runs out

And as the cold wind blows across the graveyard
I think I hear the voice of my old friend, whisper in my ear

I'm gonna stop looking back and start moving on
And learn how to face my fears
Love with all of my heart and make my mark
I wanna leave something here
Go out on a ledge, without any net
That's what I'm gonna be about
Yeah, I wanna be running
When the sand runs out
I wanna be running 
When the sand runs out
Yes I do, mmm"

"event","As you got up this morning, I watched you, and hoped you would talk to me, even if it was just a few words, asking my opinion or thanking me for something good that happened in your life yesterday. But I noticed you were too busy, trying to find the right outfit to wear. 

When you ran around the house getting ready, I knew there would be a few minutes for you to stop and say hello, but you were to busy. At one point you had to wait fifteen minutes with nothing to do except sit in a chair. Then I saw you spring to your feet. I thought you wanted to talk to me but you ran to the phone and called a friend to get the latest gossip instead. I watched patiently all day long. With all our activities I guess you were too busy to say anything to me. 


I noticed that before lunch you looked around, maybe you felt embarrassed to talk to me, that is why you didn't bow your head. You glanced three or four tables over and you noticed some of your friends talking to me briefly before they ate, but you didn't. That's okay. There is still more time left, and I hope that you will talk to me yet. 

You went home and it seems as if you had lots of things to do. After a few of them were done, you turned on the TV. I don't know if you like TV or not, just about anything goes there and you spend a lot of time each day in front of it not thinking about anything, just enjoying the show. I waited patiently again as you watched the TV and ate your meal, but again you didn't talk to me. 

Bedtime I guess you felt too tired. After you said goodnight to your family you plopped into bed and fell asleep in no time. That's okay because you may not realize that I am always there for you.. I've got patience, more than you will ever know... I even want to teach you how to be patient with others as well. 

I love you so much that I wait everyday for a nod, prayer or thought, or a thankful part of your heart. It is hard to have a one-sided conversation. 

Well, you are getting up once again. Once again I will wait, with nothing but love for you. Hoping that today you will give me some time. Have a nice day! 

Your friend, 

GOD"

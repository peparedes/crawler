I know that I shouldn't be nice to people only to have them be nice to me--and I'm not, for real. But every once in awhile, I wish that people would appreciate me. I hate how selfish I've become."

"event","I feel so disconnected with the world today. It's hard to tell why for sure. However, I think I know what it is. My body and mind are just simply exhausted. It's my fault; I don't blame anyone else. I just keep up with my damned expectations. Because I feel so strongly about them, my heart just keeps repeatedly getting broke. The saddest part is that who can I really talk to about this? I have several wonderful friends who I know would take time out to listen to me, but I feel worthless admitting my thoughts and anyhow, why bore them? I'll figure it out someday, I'm sure."

     When scanning the suggestions for our first journal entry, the one that automatically popped out at me was ""living a life worth living"". It's a topic I myself have grappled with on several occasions. Although I have come to some fairly complicated answers, my mind continually travels back to a seemingly simple concept. It's merely figuring out what one does well, then doing it the best one possibly can. Again, it only appears to be straightforward. However, we are not given a sheet of paper at birth stating what we are meant to do. Although this makes the path of life more interesting, it also causes people to have many questions, such as ""How does one live a life worth living?"""

"event","I'm a double major, and usually when I say that one of my concentrations is in English, people assume that I plan to either teach or write with my major. However, I do not consider myself to be any good at writing, and I certainly am not a teacher. I actually would like to become a book editor, and help those who can write to make their works a little better. My other major is Religious Studies. The idea of any type of religion is fascinating to me, and I've considered going to graduate school in the concentration of New Testament studies, and I'd like to keep this potential goal attainable.

     As one probably would guess, I am a fan of English classes, and always have been. It all began in elementary school. I was always known among my classmates as a big reader, and that reputation followed me throughout middle and high school years. The fact that I read so much even outside of school helped me to comprehend the poems, essays, short stories, and books I needed to read for my various classes. This love of words and my language in general has made me appreciate all that I learn in English classes, no matter what level."

"event","So tonight my views about something were suddenly quite radically changed. I've been wanting to lose weight for quite some time now. However, the reason was so a guy would finally like me. But then I realized something. Do I really want a guy who's that focused on how I look? I don't need someone who puts me under pressure to look good. So now I've decided to lose weight for my health, and so my mother won't worry about me. 

    But then thinking about the whole guy issue made me think of what a perfect guy for me would be like. I decided to put all this on here so I could have a reference point for me, as literally no one reads this anymore (which is just fine by me). First of all, I want someone who is genuinely a nice person to everyone, no matter who they are. Secondly, I would prefer someone with an excellent and broad sense of humor. In regards to how he views me, I don't want him wearing rose colored glasses. I hope he realizes my faults, then finds out that my positives outweigh my negatives, which makes him want to stick around. If he's mad at me, I want him to tell me why, and vice-versa.

    I would like a guy who loves children, and is good with them. I also want someone who's sensitive enough to care if something's wrong with someone, yet not someone who's too sensitive. I would like the guy to occasionally be romantic, yet not ever overdo it. Another big thing of mine is that I wouldn't want him to always pay for me, yet I'd like him to believe that I deserve it. (Along those same lines, I would know he deserved for me to pay for him sometimes, as well). I wouldn't be picky as to whether he remembered what outfit I was wearing the day before or even when my birthday/our anniversary was. That's not so important to me. The important things would be how he treats people in general, and not just me. I want him to feel free to hang out with his friends (even if they're girls) as much as he wants, so long as he pays me the same courtesy. 

    I used to believe I could only marry someone who was a Christian. I'm not sure how I feel about that anymore. I do know that it would be nice, as my faith is probably the biggest part of my life. But if he were a Christian, I'd prefer a non-judgemental one. We wouldn't have to agree on everything, but I hope we'd both listen to one another, at least. 
 
    My last must has to do with two other extremely important parts of my life: my friends and family. First of all, my family and friends must approve of him. I've seen too many people not listen to the wisdom of the people who love them the most and end up getting majorly hurt. Plus I would want them to invite him to things, and for him to feel comfortable there. I also hope that his family and friends approve of me, and that I'm welcomed there. I wouldn't want me to be the cause of any ill feelings.

    I suppose that's really it. I don't know if I'll ever find this guy, but I know I need to learn to be content without that perfect guy, or anyone. I have so much other positives in my life that I don't truly need anything else. So that's about it."

"event","Just in case people still read this, I have a warning about this entry. This is REALLY long and boring, so I'm telling you now--you are not going to want to read it, lol. I just did it because I was bored and saw something similar on a friend's Xanga. So yeah. :-)

~I have over 500 CDs, and I keep them all in alphabetical order.~
~Along the same lines, music is a huge passion of mine. I have about a billion favorite artists, groups, and songs, but some of my obsessions are: Train, Barry Manilow, Queen, Goo Goo Dolls, Kanye West, and Frank Sinatra.~
~I have about 50 shoes. I wear maybe 5 of them.~
~One of the things I hate most about myself is that I am close-minded about close-minded people. Not much else pisses me off more.~
~I don't consider piss to be a cuss word, no matter what others say.~
~I say the word nice too much, particularly when I have nothing else to say.~
~I hate silence. Sometimes if it's unbearably, awkwardly quiet I'll just say whatever is on my mind, no matter how stupid it is.~
~However, once I read that if two people can be silent together for 10 minutes without either of them feeling like they need to say anything, that is a sign of a deep friendship. I'm still waiting for that friend.~
~I dislike most vegetables, wheat bread, and nearly every type of diet food.~ 
~I love pasta, white bread, and cheese.~
~Needless to say, I'm not the healthiest person ever.~
~I used to be a good singer. However, when I stopped singing every day, I became very flat. I'm working on it.~
~I love to meet new people and find out about them.~
~If it were up to me, guys would have to take one day a month to wear a tuxedo. I find them unbearably hot.~
~I wish my hair wasn't frizzy.~
~I adore taking pictures of--and with--people.~
~I have been told I'm too quiet and that I talk too much. Once I was told both these things in one day.~
~I don't like to like things just because others do. I also dislike really liking something that's unique, then everyone else finding out about it and making it popular, and then wearing it out.~
~I love old TV shows and music. I sometimes wonder if I was born in the right decade.~
~I'm a Christian--first by raising, now by choice. However, please don't use that as a stereotype to judge me by. I'm most definitely a liberal Christian, which is different than what people usually think of when they think ""Christian"".~
~I adore my family.~
~My father is one of my heroes, and I'm a ""Daddy's Girl"" to a fault.~
~Recently I've gotten into the habit of saying what I think someone needs to hear, whether it's hard for them to hear. But to be fair, I'm trying to be more open to criticism about myself.~
~I rarely wear make-up.~
~I can tell you a lot about the TV show Friends. Some may call it pathetic, but I enjoy it.~
~I cry way too easily about little things.~
~I truly thank God for my trials, because I'm realizing that without them, I wouldn't be who I am today.~
~I don't like alcohol. The smell makes me sick and I hate what it does to people.~
~I also don't like tobacco. It smells, makes me cough, and kills people.~
~I tend to hold grudges longer than necessary, particularly against people who either hurt my friends or break my heart.~
~I dislike when people say ""That's gay"" or ""That's retarded"" because it implies that both of them are negatives.~
~My eye twitches when I'm either annoyed or hear an ugly/really high noise.~
~I recently learned how to wink.~
~One of my favorite songs is ""Baby Got Back"" and I can recite it all.(notice I didn't claim to be able to rap it, lol)~
~I have obsessions with random celebrities and claim to want to marry them. Some people find that odd.~
~I find myself to be a conversation whore a lot, which I hate about myself.~
~I can wiggle one ear at a time.~
~I hate to let people down. I'd rather 10 people be mad at me than one person be disappointed in me.~
~I hate when anyone doesn't like me, even when I don't like that person.~
~I was raised to say please, thank you, and you're welcome. It sometimes annoys me when others don't do it.~
~I don't like it when people blame God for a person's stupidity.~
~I truly believe that there are two sides to every story, even though sometimes I need a reminder.~
~I hate math, yet love to multiply fractions.~
~I used to be a writer in the way that something would pop up in my brain that would be the exact perfect pattern of words to describe something. I've heard of professional writers feeling this way, and it always made me feel good to experience it like them. However, I've since lost that ability and now would rather help writers to write.~
~I adore reading to a fault.~
~I love to laugh. I have the type of sense of humor where it's easy to make me amused, as I enjoy all types of humor.~
~Sadly, one of my biggest fears is that I'll never get married. I differ from many girls in that my wedding is not planned perfectly in my mind, because I don't want to jinx myself.~
~It'd probably be a good thing if I never got married, as I'd make a crappy wife. I can't cook very well and I abhor cleaning.~
~It bothers me when people don't look past appearances.~
~Even when someone annoys me beyond belief, I still make myself look for their positives.~
~I love doing puzzles.~
~I hate when my hands are sticky or dirty. I have to wash them immediately.~
~I hate how messy my room is, but I never can make myself just clean it.~
~I'm a naturally ditzy person, but I can have random deep thoughts.~
~I love giving presents.~
~I'm scared of sharks, bees, and heights, among other things.~
~I hate cell phones, but have one anyhow.~
~I love to make others laugh, even though I'm not too good at it.~
~I wish I could read people's minds because I'm not too intuitive and I'd like to know what people think about me.~
~I love good quotes.~
~I wish I could make everyone happy.~
~I often wish I was skinnier, yet I rarely do much to help myself in that department.~
~Finishing a Sudoku puzzle gives me a very sad sense of accomplishment.~
~All four of my grandparents are still alive, which makes me happy beyond belief, as they are all completely amazing people.~
~I like to help solve people's problems.~
~My main passions in life are: God, friends/family, music, and reading.~
~I spend way too much time doing nothing.~
~I think talking religion is one of the most fascinating things ever.~
~I love looking at stars.~
~I suck at anything physical.~
~I can get lucky sometimes when it comes to bowling and crane machines.~
~I have an odd love for carbonated drinks, unfortunately.~
~I don't like the smell of freezers.~
~Dogs and penguins are amazing to me.~
~I love my last name, no matter how many times it's misprounounced or misspelled.~
~I suck at geography/directions.~
~I've recently learned that worrying and getting stressed are worthless, so I've become much more relaxed.~
~I love college and miss it greatly.~
~However, since being away, I've realized that my hometown is pretty cool.~
~I don't really like much ice in drinks because it waters it down.~
~I hate that gas prices have gone up so much because I love to just drive/ride around and listen to music.~
~I am one of those annoying girls who says ""Awwww"" too much.~
~I don't like water.~
~I'm not one for roller coasters.~
~I love free samples.~
~When it comes to ""checking out"" guys, I look at arms, the smile and eyes. I also love the way some guys smell (Curve, Axe, Eternity, etc). However, when actually liking a guy, none of that really matters. It's all about the personality. I truly believe that a good personality either makes a guy hot or enhances his hotness.~
~I adore Mark Twain's writing.~
~I have facebook and Xanga and check them more times a day than I want to admit.~
~I love the smell of gardenias and honeysuckles.~

"event","So realization hit two nights ago. Yes, I've been hit by this same discovery before. However, this time it hit me like a bus. Merely the thought alone brought me to tears. I walked out of the dorm sobbing uncontrollably. I still don't understand what I did, exactly. I mean, it had to have been me. It's driving me insane trying to figure it all out, but I'm receiving no help. So it's kind of like trying to solve a math problem without any givens. But the one positive is that now I believe I can begin the process of giving up again. It's a long, hard process I'm not looking forward to at all, but it is necessary for my peace of mind. So if anyone looks at this at all anymore (and I completely don't blame anyone if they don't, as it is really boring--I do know that), please pray for me. Thanks.
(On a completely other note, yesterday I got closure from something else--it sucked, but I know it, too, was essential. So yay for that!)"

"event","So I don't get life. We just go through this everyday confusion and try to make sense of it? Plus throw in regrets: we make decisions that we have to make, then spend forever looking back and trying to figure out whether we made the right choices? We spend the entire time looking for love, yet we don't know exactly what that is? Why do we continue to have feelings for people who don't have them back? Isn't this a huge waste of time? And what if that just always happens? I can't just stop liking someone, can I? And if I do, what if he decides to come back? Shouldn't I wait for him? Or should I just face the inevitable? I don't like these questions."

"event","Feelings suck. I mean, I've had an awesome day/great week and I have so much to look forward to, but I still have this underlying sadness that I can't shake. I know that liking someone is no reason to be all depressed or anything. I know it's not really a big deal. But somehow--to me--it is in this case. Will I ever find someone else who makes me this extraordinarily happy?"

"event","I have had the most insane mood swings lately. Over the weekend I was feeling happy, but Sunday hit and I became depressed. I feel like this place is becoming my home more and more and that Wabash is fading away, which makes me unbelievably sad. However, I am having a good time here. Another positive thing is that the more I explore my religion, the closer I fee to God, which is wonderful. Maybe I'm not an orthodox Christian--some may even claim I'm not a Christian at all--but I feel such peace thinking of Him, which is something I haven't felt in a long while. Anyhow, thanks for reading this all who still read it (aka Joyce and Laura D. lol) I love you! :-)"

I pray to Him that you will be happy. Deep down, I know that if all those stars that I have hung that wish on could talk, they would tell me that I could never make you happy. For that I am eternally regretful."

However, now the things I'm staying for may not happen...but it's all good, I guess. Anyhow, half of me is excited for break because I get to see everyone back in Wabash who I've missed. However, a whole month without my UIndy friends makes me sad. I think after a week I'll be ready to go back. :-\ Oh, well. Not much else to say, I suppose..."

First of all, thank you for being such an awesome friend so so freaking long. I always appreciate how you listen to me and don't make fun of my stupid thoughts. Plus you are unbelievably trustworthy, which is such an awesome quality to possess. I know you've had some hard times lately, and I also know how you usually stuff your emotions in. So I'm going to tell you that you really should get at least some of them out. I'm always here to listen to you--I hope you know that. So yeah. Thanks again and I love you, Laura! :-)"

Although I'm not going to Florida like half the people ever, I still think it'll be fun. We have a couple movie nights planned, I'm going to hear Philip Gulley--one of my favorite authors--speak, some of us are planning on going to Kokomo, and another night--we're thinking Wednesday right now--we're going to Holiday Inn just for the heck of it, and to end my break, I'm spending the night at U of I to make certain that's where I'm going to go. So I have most of my vacation filled with random--yet fun--activities. 

I just realized something. The two other people who speak code are like the only ones who really read this. So here's some code to finish up my entry: E is glad that J and K are going to the p together. KJ is a weird person obsessed with lecturing about underwear. Talk to you all later!"

"event","I've learned something the past like 2 days without getting on the Internet. If I stop complaining about how bored I am, and actually DO something, my life doesn't suck near as bad. On Wednesday I went to see Shrek 2 with Anne, Jaimie, Kelly, and Tim. Then everyone but Tim went to Wal-Mart. Then I came home and my mom and I went and visited my father out during his summer camping thing. Then I got home and watched Shrek and fell asleep.
Thursday was a lot of fun. After Summer Theater I went to percussion--okay, that was really boring--but then I went with some other people to Kelly's house to watch the funniest movie I've seen in awhile. I was there until a little before 1:00--some people stayed until twenty til 4, though. Even though these things that have happened the last two days don't sound exciting, they were a lot of fun. Today my mom saw Zach Batz at Bechtol's. :-P And that's about it. Wait--I took this quiz.

"event","Today was slightly more eventful. I woke up at 12:15. I walked out to my car to leave and these two guys were standing on the sidewalk. They were like, ""Ma'm?"" and I was thinking, who are they talking to? Turns out it was me. Apparently, the house two doors down from me is being taken by the government (there are rumors that the owner was growing marijuana and her cat dug it up, lol) and the guys wanted to know if I knew if my next door neighbor wanted her swing that was on the marijuana selling neighbor's yard. I told them I didn't know, but I would ask her later for them. So that was my ""excitement"" of the day--how pitiful. I then went to Summer Theater from 1-3:30. I talked to my neighbor--never even met her before--and then went to work from 4 until a little after 7. I went to percussion, came home, ate supper, went to Family Video and Kroger's then came home. I'm thinking about going wild and actually doing something tomorrow--getting a group of people to go see Shrek 2, as I couldn't hear half of it the last time, lol."

First I woke up at like 9:00, went to church, came home and ate, took a nap, then went with the Merrimans and Samantha to see Harry Potter 3--it was pretty good, Sam and I made some parts funny that weren't and I amused everyone by gasping at a freaky part. Overall, fun. Then Katy and I went to youth group. We all went to the minister's house and just talked--it was pretty interesting. Then I came home and had supper and watched Friends. Tomorrow I have to go thrift shopping for Summer Theater, then to Summer Theater, then Jessi and I are eating supper then Lori's coming over and we're going to get movies and possibly go Bechtoling. And that's my exciting life."

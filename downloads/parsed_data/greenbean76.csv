"event","Dear Journal, JKJK ok so yeah a lot actually happened in the last few days of my O SO CAPTIVATING life. hmm ok so lets start monday. well me and kim went bike riding to Mendon Ponds Park and omg it was soooo tiring when we were riding there! we seriously were walking up most of the hhills and it seemed like forever to get somewhere....because at first we really didnt know where we were going and no bikes were allowed on the trails which stunk, so then we decided to go to the sledding hills to ride up and down them HAHA it was great! however, every time we had to bring them back up we were so pathetically tired we would collapse lol.ok so then we decided to go and get our hair wet at one of the pump things and then all the sudden this old, dark colored, evil teenage rapist boy car started up and they were like looking right  at us and we didnt notice that they had been there so we FREAKED out that they were going to rape us so we got on our bikes quite hastily and rode down to the bathing beach where WELL some interesting things happened. when we got there it was REALLY hot and we parked our bikes and then decided to go swimming.... so then we did *cough* * HMMMMMM* *cough* and we were swimming next to this huge family that had a father that seriously looked like a LIVING APE lol. When we were in the water a large flock of geese got up on to the shore and was seriously surrounding our shoes and stuff and it seriously seemed like they were going to eat it and PLUS this woman that as also swimming was yelling ""THEY WANT SOME SNEAKA GIRLS! THEY GUN EAT YO SNEAKERS AND CLOTHES BETTA WATCH OUT!"" lol it was odd... so yeah that interesting thing happened. So we got out and attempted to dry off with washclothes and then went swwinging to get dry. but then this large fat black kid with his brother came running over and the fat one fell on the ground and was like paralzed in this weird position with this slightly funny  ""hurt"" face on for like five minutes and wouldn't say anythign but then he just got up and went to the swings...weird. so after that we left the bathing beach and ew wet shorts riding is the WORST thing especially when your butt starts to die and it hurts so bad. poo poop.  
Yesterday i went to seabreeze with kim, emily, caroline, Mrs. Floeser, karen, julia, and her friend bryana. it was so much fun! we went on waterslides first and then on the dry rides. the new roller coaster the WHIRL WIND was really fun too hehe and the spring was fun even though its like the lamest ride there but it gives you such great laughter and fun in such a short amount of glorious HAPPY TIME. the gyrosphere rocked except that ont he second time we went there were these scary punk boy losers---that had spit on the jack rabbit in the tunnel and got it on everyone--- that were on the ride with us and this one kid was SOO freaky and we kept passing him! me and kim also went on the screaming eagle 3 times in a row whcih was fun the first 2 times but on the last well i think that it was just a little too much then. but hey we did it so YAY heh. YEAAAH. so i dont know what i am going to do today but i REALLY HOPE we can go to THE VILLAGE tonight hehe YAY it will be so cool..omg but a lot of ppl are saying that its boring and stuff but i mean ppl thought the day after tomorrow was a bad movie and I LOVED IT i mean it was really really interesting and everythign and plus JAKE GLYENHALL WAS IN IT YAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAY! hes soooo GREAT. lol he will be mine, O YES, he will be mine. hehe so yeah we have wanted to see the village for soooooo long now! i just hope that its not incredibly dissapointing but seriously i DO NOT think that i will be! ppl just think about the twists and miss the true goodness of the movie wwhen they are all wrapped up the in plot and tryign to figure out things every second of the movie. i personally think that its better to just sit back and watch it and take it all in and it will probably be better that way. 
ehhhhh im really tired maybe i should go back to sleep.....i feel like watching a good movie... hmmm ok well i guess i have written enough even though more stuff happened like online but i already told some ppl about that so i dont know if i should put that in... ehh maybe later haha ok so ill hopefully write soon again! ttyl .:Avy:."

"event","yeah so today definatly wasnt the most exciting day of my life but i am really looking forward to next week..well this week. Me and kim really want to go to seabreeze sometime and then see THE VILLAGE! i have to see that movie it looks so good! but besides that i really havent done much today...i cant even remember what i did except eat ice cream... ha ok hmm Kim got bk from the Adirondacks today which was good and i am hoping that we can do stuff tomorrow...the summer is almost gone i mean i have this week, and then running camp---the camp from hell---and then sports start the day after i get bk from camp and then BOOM school starts!! so i really have to get in some adventures and stuff. i mean the summer would have been better if all of our friends were around at the same time thats all, but some parts of the summer were definatly good. ugh what am i doing saying that the summer is over and sulking about it? i need to get out and do stuff to make it worth while! AND PLUS we still have a month left, its just full of a lot of sports and stuff....that doesnt mean that i wont have time to do other things. mmmmmmmmmmmm chocolate covered raisins...... im eating them right now..mmmm ok so besides THAT i guess i shall be departing. and if anyone besides kim reads this...tell me if u have seen BECKY MILLER! i think she disappeared off the face of the earth! OK so i guess that was kinda a short entry but not much really happened today. ill write later lyl .:Avy:."

"event","ok so here i am writing my first entry in the livejournal thing. Where should i start? ok so i guess ill just recap what happened yesterday...
so yea i was babysitting for the Hess' for the first time yesterday and there are two boys Ryan and Peter. Ryan was like really smart..he talked about air compressers and how they make waves at Roseland waterpark..mhmm yeah and then peter was obsessed with kissing peter EVERYWHERE and then said that he could break Ryans spine with an axe...yeah ok that boy has major issues!!! Overall i guess i could say that the babysitting was ok even though there house smelled and lacked of cleanliness AND the the dad was telling me about these 300 pound women who cant run on there softball team...ok did i really need to know that and was there really any relevance there? but omg ok so kim is out of town the adirondacks for the weekend and we really wanted to see THE VILLAGE~! it stinks because we wanted to see it this weekend but now they are out of town... hopefully we will be able to see it when they get back. 
so school is coming up soon and i am actually kinda excited to go back..i guess for the social aspect mainly. i cant wait to see everyone!! i actually have a few ppl in mind that i really want to see hehe and i really hope some interesting things happen next year..we will all be somphmores!           
actually a lot of odd things have been happening lately. me and kim seem to feel like our group is falling apart and its depressing in some ways. a few days ago we went biking with liam and zack and it was fun and stuff..plus liam ran in to a mailbox but thats besides the point lol..but like we didnt really talk that much during lunch and everthing. evan hardly has been home the whole summer which stinks and kim and i really want to go on this bike trip on the trail with zack and evan but there hardly seems to be time for it. Along with everything else liam and zack seem to really want to spend time with their camp friends more than they want to spend time with us which kinda sucks... but i guess thats how everything is going. i guess overall im not really sure whats going to happen with our group over the school year...i guess we will have to sit back and see. 
theres been a lot going on with other ppl i know..mostly through kim if you catch my drift.. but i dont rreally think i should say anything..onnly that i hope it works out. i guess i have written enough for my first entry but i will probably write more today and tomorrow while kim is gone.  
my moms friend Mary just came to our house to go to the bathroom....odd i can say and omg she looks like orphan Annie on drugs lol. lets just hope she doesnt read this. ok so i think i might be going school shopping today for jeans or sumthing so i guess i will stop writing.. UGH if only it wasnt raining for the past 4 weeks! well lyl ..:Avy:.."

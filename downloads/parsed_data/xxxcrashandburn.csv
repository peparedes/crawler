its almost my 20th birthday and my last REAL entry in to this thing was rite at my 19th birthday!

how long its been.......

back in the day when i hated this thing at first but becasue of chad and the girl ""whos name is not spoken"" i got one...got addicted then myspace came along and then I seemed to fall of the face of the planit!


so i guess i'd see whos still on here and see whats been going on?

as for me i'm back in school...back at good ole OU, livein the dorm life and loveing it!

my car finaly broke the 300whp and 300wtq mark...i think theres a dyno pic on my photo thing
http://s36.photobucket.com/albums/e19/06Black/

i still wake up every day and hope i'll get back into contact with the poeple back home becase thats the most important thing...but then i find myself tobusy or pissed cuz i never hear from them to make a solid effert to call them....so i guess i'm kinda stuck.

i think that some how we need to make a b-dubs trip here just for the hell of it...chad,lauren,amanda,tom,both kyles...everybody!.....lol..lauren wow havent said that name in a while...

or at least who ever the fuck can make it!

idk...what do ya'll think?"

"event","not to long ago i turned down hanging out with my old trusty friends i traded them for a collige a party wich at the time sounded cool but a day or two later a kid who is like family to me confrunted me about it and only them did i realize that i did in fact ""hoe"" them out and i've felt kinda shity about it for the past few days mainly because things dont seem to be the same between me and him and thats not cool. but i can tell you all one thing...never leave your true friends for any party or any other people its not worth it. so i ask that you can let me slide on this one and i hope things get back to the way they were. what do you say?"

So this is my first all nighter of collige and its not all i exspected it to be but ohhh fuckin well.....the main reason i'm writeing this is cuz i think i'm bout to give up on the ""long"" hair idea that i started a bit ago....its just so fuckin annoying rite now plus it hasent realy had many or any good reasons to have it but idk also i've been thinkin bout not shavin and growin some facial hair or somethin idk i whant to change somethin ya kno why not? drop your comment's or thoughts on that we will just go from here....fucked if i kno man. 
One more random thing i was readin my like first cupple lj entries and wow how things have changed from no more b-dubs to people movin away(loveyatom)and we all seemed so dam happy god what a great time seniour year was and chad one thing i gotta say is""we rule"" god that was an awesome comment.....one mroe thing its a bit of advise my soseoligy prof said on monday when we were havin a tlak about ""people and there nature"" he said ask your friends a few questions so here they are
1)if i needed would you give me a place to stay
2)if i came to you asking for help how far would you go
3)what if one day i changed what would you do or say
4)what would you do if i did something totaly unexspected
5)if you could ask me JUST one queiston what would it be.

Thats it and thats all mane"

why do we think so many things but never do them?
why do we care so much about what other people think of us?
why do we care so much about how we look comparied to everybody else?
why do we wish so many thing but never go after them?
why are some blessed with everything when others can only wish?
why does it always seem like we never have enought or were not good enough?
why does it matter who we know and who we are connected with?
and the bigist thing...
why does it seem like I always want and wish for the things that i can never have...but i'm never happy with what I've got?
am i the only one who feels these things?




to all my friends i just whant to say thank you...just for every thing, for all the times i've rambled on about pointless shit you were always willing to sit there and lision.also for the times that i've gone on about a girl for days...only to come back a day later and bitch and mone about how it dident work out just like every thing else...i just owe u all a huge thank you...and chad mainly you bro...hope things work out with every thing u ever want..and i cant waite to ride with you with the windows down in the ion.

Thanks friends...you are the best a guy like me could ever ask for

to all the hot girls i've ever been friends with..you kno who you are cuz i've prob told u at least 3 times....i thank you to...for makeing these pointless school days worth comeing to...if for nothing more than a simple hello,a hug, and a smile.."

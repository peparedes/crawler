Everyone will be happy if I just disapear.  Maybe not molly, but krissy would be because she won't have to hear my constant bitching and i know she is already tired of my shit so she won't give a damn.  Mom she will hurt but in the end it will save her money and she won't have to worry about me anymore.  Dad will be sad but he will know that I did it for my own sanity?  Matt well he will be sad, but he will move on. i hope.  and well lets just say that basically everyone will be satisfyed for the death of Lisa Renae Behnke."

If I could have chosen to live to see tomorrow I would. For my body is now buried and my spirit wanders through YOUR world.  Your crying my love.  But my faded, cold, transparant fingers cannot wipe away your tears.  My voice that used to be so strong and bold is now just apart of the air you breath.  I feel more alone dead that I ever imagined possible when I was alive.  My sisters children shall never know who I was, only memories from my sister will be what they know, and faded pictures of what I was.  They wouldn't have known that if I was still alive that I would have grown to be a well known writer and would have sold millions.  

My love, I visit you in your dreams telling you I'm sorry.  Sorry for giving up, sorry for hurting you.  You try to speak but your tears and emotions are too much.  You wake up only to see somthing small and shiny under a chair across your room.  It is the music box you gave me.  You open it up to hear it's sweet melody.  With this box comes memories.  Memories that only you and I shall ever know of.  

If I would have chosen to live to see tomorrow I would.  For now to future others I am Jane Doe, cause of death to others except myself unknown.........
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jane's death was caused the doctors say is ""unknown"".  But to Jane she was lying on her bed and she ended her life with concentraiting on death itself.  As her mind zeroed in on complete nothingness her heart stopped pumping and her mind went into a deep trance.  Her blood stopped dead in it's track and her organs stopped working.  She achieved her wonderous dream, to be dead.  But now Jane must suffer the consiquences."

"event","I deserve to die for all of the heartache I caused Matt.  I HATE MYSELF! I AM THE WORST PERSON IN THE WHOLE FUC KING WORLD!  DEATH TO LISA.  DIE LISA DIE!  

He feels this distance between us.  It's MY fault.

He doesn't fully believe that I love him.  It's MY fault.

I LIED TO HIM, I SMOKED UP, I CHEATED ON HIM, I STARTED SMOKING, I CHANGED MYSELF TO SEE WHO I WANTED TO BE WHICH TURNED OUT THAT HE HATES WHAT I'M EVOLVING INTO.  EVERYTHING ABOUT ME IS WRONG.  he loves me.  THAT is the reason we have stayed togeather.  That IS the best reason in the whole world that people stay togeather.  But i'm causing him so much pain, i don't know if it's worth staying togeather.  I WANT TO BE WITH HIM FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.  But the thing I want most is for HIM to be happy even if it causes me to go back into my depressed spiral again.  It's just everytime I talk to him I get this feeling that he is going to say ""I'm setting you free into the world.  It's over between us.""  I cry inside when I talk to him because actually I feel he is hurting and I know it's MY fault.  I have hurt the man I love...How ignorant can I be?!  I'm quiting my smoking.  after these last 2 ciggs (wich i'm almost done smoking right now)  wich would end my pack of cigg's, I am taking the money mom took for my ciggs and i'm telling her to put it back into my bank account and telling her NEVER TO BUY ME CIGGS AGAIN.  I am not going on break with Angie and Jim until I know my habit is broken.  I stopped smoking up.  I cut my hair but i'm letting it grow out and i'm only going to get it trimmed from now on.  I won't look at other people, my head will forever be faced downward at the ground.  I remember when I looked down ALL the time.  Never once looking up.  If I could do that before, I can do it again.  I am going to loose weight.  I want to make him happy.  I have to.  I will make him happy.  I won't do anything wrong.  I am not going to even look at porn.  I must make him happy......

I must make him happy.  I will make him happy.  I must make him happy.  I will make him happy.  I must make him happy.  I will make him happy.

I just told mom to put my money back, and never buy me cigg's again.  I feel relieved actually.  SOMTHING might actually be going right with me for once.....

I want to make him happy.  I will make him happy.

I caused to much heartache and pain for him.  I have to change myself to make him happy.  I HAVE TO.  No matter what ANYONE says.  I WILL change myself to make him happy.  I've been so bad.  see this would be the point in time which I would have cut, it would go somthing like this>>>>
  ""You've been a bad girl ::cut cut:: You deserve to die ::cut cut cut:: You are stupid ::cut cut cut cut cut cut cut::  nothing you do is right ::cut cut:: inflict MORE pain  ::cut cut cut cut:: must make the pain inside go away ::cut cut cut cut cut cut cut SLASH!::  ::Blood starts to pour down my arm::  good girl.  VERY good girl.  You did somthing right for once.  You made yourself bleed.  STUPID STUPID C~UNT! ::cut cut cut cut:: how could you do somthing like that?! ::cut cut cut cut cut::  WHY ARE YOU SO FRIGG'N STUPID! ::cut cut cut cut cut:: HOW COULD YOU DARE MAKE HIM HURT INSIDE!  ::cut cut cut cut cut:: WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!  ::cut cut cut:: DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE!!!!!!!!!  ::cut cut cut cut SLASH SLASH SLASH!!!::  ::blood everywhere:: b~itch.""

that feels so good to type out...I think I should do that now when I need to cut is to type it out....I can just imagine the warm blood seeping over my pale skin.....and that is how I feel about everything basically......

goodbye for now...I'll write again later...."

"event","No I didn't cut, I just picked at the scabs that are on my arm.  And the blood started to bubble and seep, and drip and form a beautiful thing.  I miss that. :( ...The open wound, the smell of fresh blood, the taste of the red drops (maybe i'm a vampire teehee), the sence of feeling one with my body and soul.  I loved it when the blood formed into somthing that could not be created ever again.  Like a child developing in a woman's stomach creating somthing that has never been seen ever before, the shape of the nose, a face so perfect, a body so fragile that even the slightest thing like paper could harm it's tiny little body with a single cut.  Just like a child this form of blood symbolizes life.  And with life brings death.  So many people have found there way to death with a slit of their wrists, and overdose of pills, and many other things.  A knife that has never been thought of being used for self harm to others has brought death to one single soul.  Pills thought to cure a simple headache has quickly been popped one after another just to cure a reacurring or desperate problem for one person.  With life comes death, With death comes life.  For some our lives seem to go to a halt, and then with the help of an item that seems so perfect with a certain painful process it becomes our way out of this life, and brings us forth unto another life.  With blood drawn from our fragile bodies it seems as though it symbolizes thousands of things.  Things that many other people have not yet learned.  Things that others may not even consider.  But I leave you with one simple little thing, keep an open mind for those whom have thought of death as a beautiful thing, for I am one of those people.  I am not going to commit suicide, but I do find death beautiful and a trip to another life.  A life that can only be found when death has been done with.  

:) i hope you all enjoy my thoughts and feelings of these matters, and i hope you all can understand it.  for some people do not feel or think this way, so it's merely a chance for others to learn another perspective in this life."

And yes I do know that I will see him again.  But ppl do you really know how it feels like to basically live with someone you love with all of your body mind and soul for 3 weeks and then have him taken away from you in a matter of seconds????

And all I do is wait for my love to blow away the sadness from me.  I sit on my bed late at night holding the red bear and I stare at his picture.  I know I have school the next day but that truly doesn't faze me at that point in time because all I want to do (and I actually do it) is just sit there and cry.  Waiting until he can hold me again, cradle me in his arms so I can fall asleep.  Waiting until I can cuddle up close to him and breath in his sent.  Waiting...Crying....Waiting....Crying....It seems as though that is all I do now is wait and cry.  Sad thought huh? someone who used to be so fucking strong and in control, has finally been beaten down my her own thoughts and feelings.  But I promised him I would take care of myself, and I truly try to.  But today I couldn't lift myself up the energy to go to school because I was so depressed.

"event","I HATE mike.  I don't care if stephanie ""loves"" him.  She has said she loves alot of people and then she goes to somebody else, so I am unsure that it is true love.  Besides he is a dick.  Actually, calling him a dick is a compliment so really there is nothing that I can compare him to because he is the absolute LOWEST degrading thing on the face of this earth that anybody can be called...He treats girls like they are nothing, like they should just be passed around by his wishes.  and when he is with a girl they must wear what he wants them to wear, and keep thier hair a certain length.  He is immature. VERY fucking immature.  He is ugly too.  Sorry to say but I would never touch him with a ten foot pole, let alone a 50 foot pole.  I just want to punch him....but that would consider touching him, which means I would be going against my saying above, so that would therefore make me a hypocrite hence why i would never punch him.  I cannot believe he lived in my house, and breathed my precious air.  He has contaminated my mind.  hmmm....spitting....would that be considered touch??? I just want to show him how degrading I feel of him....Yeah i should spit on him hehe...ooo that sounds like fun.  I warned stephanie about him...and when he goes to jail he is gunna be bubba's bitch! lol YES! :: evil laugh :: just thinking about that makes me all giddy inside.

"event","His hand was gently caressing my face and he leaned in for a kiss. A smile spread across his face as he pulled away and saw my cheeks turn a deep red color. ""God I love you"" he whispered in my right ear. Inside I squealed with delight from him saying those words, I immediatly jumped on his lap and said, ""I think I'm ready."" His smile immediatly got bigger, but his eyes were somewhere else. Like he had something else on his mind. But I ignored that fact as soon as he picked me up from his lap and stood up with me in his arms, right away we walked into his room. 

His walls were filled with pictures of me. Me in his car, me walking down the street, me eating strawberry ice cream, me just doing everyday things. He told me he was just practicing taking photo's because he wanted to be a photographer, so I told him click away. I was amazed of how many I didn't even know of, but then I saw his bed and immediatly thought ""well today is the day I loose my virginity to a man who loves me""...He gently layed me down and onto his bed and started to kiss me all over. He slowly took off my clothes and kissed my stomach then my thighs. As one of his hands was busy doing something not with me, I didn't care because he started to kiss me and his other arm was linked around my body in a firm manor. Then I felt something cold and sharp glide up my right outter leg. He smiled and said, ""You know I love you hunny, but there are times when a slut needs to learn a lesson."" And that when I saw what that was, it was a butcher knife and it was too late to do anything, he held it too my heart, and I stared at him with tears running down my face. I screamed ""WHY?!"". He didn't answer he pushed forcefully down on my chest and I screamed. The pain was so intense it froze up my body and I couldn't move, I just layed there in his arms screaming. He pulled the knife hard out of my chest and laughed. He traced my face with the knife ""Such a pretty face, such a shame it's going to be ruined."", and with that he lashed at my face. I finally got enough energy to move and I kicked as hard as I could but his body was too heavy for me. He slit my throat, and I passed out. I heard this tiny voice inside of me saying, ""No you can't die! You must fight!"" but it was too late, I saw this beautiful bluish white light and I was floating towards it. But only now I realized that I just gave him the satisfation he wanted. I was dead and he lived."

Because i'm REALLY getting confused and shit...I mean you say that you love him one day, then the next day you want to dump him...I think you should take some time alone like when your at home without interuptions and just think over EVERYTHING about you and him, and decided once and for all if you like him as a boyfriend or not...Because if you are dating him and you don't like him like a boyfriend...Well that isn't right because that is leading him on....And you say that you don't want to hurt him (in your journal) but what do you think it does to him when he see's you kinda all over mike? LOL i mean I think I should listen to this too because I flirt WAY to much...so yeah, but i have been cutting back and shit...But anyways! so yeah if you think about it when you are all over other guys it probably hurts him...And leading him on probably hurts him in the over all end of it because he would probably be thinking ""hey she stayed with me long, so maybe i should ask her some other time...."" you know what i mean?

"event","I am so fucking tired of fighting and getting back togeather and then fighting again...So obveously we made up, but I truly cannot lie and say that I take back everything that I said because what I say I say the truth, and wat I feel is how I say it and shit.  I still feel this distance with Stephanie and shit, but knowing us we will probably forget that this fight ever happened and it will probably happen again...

Ok Matt Said that he doubts we will ""make love, fuck"" in his journal because he thinks (and correct me if i'm wrong) that it is because of that is why I don't talk to him as much. Well it really isn't that, it's because I just been like feeling wierd and shit about us..I mean don't get me wrong..I love him to death...but idk...I just havn't been this close to someone before....yeah I've fucked around the bush a bit...But that was just fucking and shit....and there really wasn't feelings that I've felt for the guys, but with matt it's like...""Whoa! hello? heart is that you? omg it's been forever! i havn't felt you beat forever...I thought you were dead!""...and I don't know wat to do....I always feel that I don't deserve him, and when he says that he doesn't deserve me...Well it makes me want to cry because I can't see anything he see's in me...Isn't that pathetic? I mean god you would think I could find one friek'n thing good about me without just saying something to satisfy someone with an answer, but I can't...And I havn't been talking as long as usual because, yeah I do have friends over alot...And when I DO get to talk to him, well idk I just don't know wat to say...Like I feel stupid saying anything to him...And I want to say shit, and how I feel but it's like idk....I can't seem to let myself go, and speak freely anymore....I try to hide myself, and make others happy...But then I just destroy myself with doing that, but I can't seem to let go of the fact that I shouldn't speak because I have nothing to say...well that is how i see it anyway...

Gah, last night I felt like cutting a deep deep fucking cut, but I fought the urge off for a bit, but then I looked into the mirror and all I could see was how fat I was....So I made myself throw up....God all I could think about was shoving my finger down deeper and deeper, and just let go of everything....So I could control wat my body would get...And it's sad to say but I will probably go and do it again tonight...and it's even more sadder to say that I still feel fucking suicidal and I want to cut tonight also..But I hope I can at least fight off the urge to cut....God it's so wierd to think about it...But I might...erm....probably am becoming belimick (spel?)...Thats a really big drop for my self esteem...lol wat self esteem? god I fucking lost that a long time ago....I miss my self esteem....Can I borrow someones? just for a bit? until I find mine? anyone? gah..no one is there...eep i'm alone.....so alone.....will anyone save me? can someone please save me from myself? anyone? HELLO?!....it's really frusterating to ask people for help when no one is there.....and it's even more frusterating to ask for help to myself....Because all I say to myself is ""Die you ugly whore! DIE! JUST FUCKING DIE!"" That is all I hear in my head....tis a sad thought..... :( ....gah my cuts are so beautiful...it would be wonderful just to make one more....just one more.....no no no i can't.....anyone there? anyone there to say it's ok? anyone there to stop me? nope no one....i guess i'm a failure with everything.....oh great...pitty party time.....so fucking sad....I am so fucking pathetic...and i'm whineing and expecting help when I can't even think once of helping myself...."

I mean I told her and molly about my rape, and I mean fucking everything, and I tell her shit ALL the fucking time....I have a right to be pissed and bitchy and cry and cut and everything...SO I don't really care right now if this entry pisses anyone off.....Then she says that when she talks to molly and Me well then we just repeat shit....Well that is because she either doesn't listen or she doesn't believe the answer me and molly say......It really pisses me off.....I mean I can't please her with anything I say.....really I can't....So I don't know what to do!GAH!!!!!!!! I don't want to lose her as a friend...But when she keeps saying shit that me and molly ARN'T her friends and she doesn't know why we hang out with her.....Well then I don't really see the point of being with her if she doesn't want to accept the fucking fact that we ARE/WERE her friends....Then SOMETIMES not all the time it just seems that she pins her problems on certain shit and then doesn't face the facts that she can handle them and she is just ignoring shit...and she isn't women enough to face them.......GAH NOW SHE IS BLAMING ME FOR MAKING HER DEPRESSED BASICALLY......I'M SICK OF ALL OF THIS FUCKING SHIT!

I mean god the least she could have done was say, ""Hey you guys i really don't feel like talking right now...I just need some time to think..."" But Hell no, she ignored us...And Molly and I wrote her a letter saying how we felt and shit because we wanted her to know how WE felt...You know I mean we talk to her and talk about how she feels like all of the time, so I think it's about time that Molly and I should get to say how WE feel. If she is pissed off, suicidal, or sad about wat we said (which is basically everything that i've been talking about before and now) then I don't know wat to do...I mean we should get to give our emotions, and not just her...Well that is how I feel...And like when molly and I went upstairs because she wasn't even talking to us and shit...Well she didn't even come upstairs to ask wat was wrong, or say ""Hey i'm sorry"" or anything....No she and Jill just stayed down there laughing, and talking....And YES they were laughing because Molly and I could hear that in the vents and shit....Gah I really hate vents...They piss me off because they mock me...Gah when a friend ignores us, and only talks to my own fuck'n sister and not her 2 suposidly good friends and the sound of laughter goes through the vents and trails up to us it crushes my heart...I thought she was my friend....I....I....I thought we were going to move up to canada in the future so I could be with my boyfriend and she could get away from shit, and Hoel (spel?) and she could move on with her life and be happy and have a good friend by her side....That is wat I thought....But she ignored us....She crushed my heart...She....She...I miss her, and she just ignores me...I won't talk to her until she says sorry for ignoring us...or At least gives me a damn good excuse to why she chose My sister over me and molly.  I know she and my sister are friends...but when she ignored us...How do you think that made us feel??? If you don't know....well lemmie tell ya...It hurts...I really, truly hurts... :(

God I want matt here right now to hold me...And just fuck'n comfort me...I need him right now...I need him so fucking bad...This distance is getting to me....But of course I will wait it out and wait till he gets here....my love...I miss you so much....I really do...My heart aches to see you in person again....

I am craving a blade...I am craving a safty pin...I am craving ANYTHING sharp to numb my pain....I want to drag that sharp object across my arm, across my leg, across my thighs, across my stomach, across my fingers, across my ankles, across my feet....And just lie on my cold, hardwood floor in my room and with my arms and legs spread, and just feel the pain and sorrows drain out of me....There is a pencil sharpener in my room....there is a screw driver lieing right beside it....I COULD take it apart like I did before, and let the cutting commence..But I won't...I've gone exactly 1 week and 2 fucking days without cutting and I won't give in....I CAN'T give in...But I don't know how long I can go without numbing my pain but inflicting pain....I used to be so strong growing up..I used to think there was something I was made for....But now I am so weak....And I gave up my dream of becoming a counselor...I feel so drained...I'm craving sleep and matt and cutting....And yet I can't fully get any of them....Sure I sleep...But it consist's of tossing and turing, and waking up sweating, and scared out of my mind....Scared that I might loose my one true love....And matt, living so far away...I can't have him with me, I can't see him whenever I want to...that makes me wanna cut just thinking of that....and thinking about stephanie....God cutting sounds sooo good....growing weaker by the second...Dreams are gone...Boyfriend is far...Friend is lost....I am nothing.....And it's eating me away inside....So fucking fat...So fucking stupid...What does matt see in me? I don't get how he can love me so much...I mean I'm fat...And I have so many issues....Most guys would run in the opposite direction..But he sticks with me...I am lucky to have him...God...i'm fucking crying...I hate to cry....So weak...Inside i'm dieing....Would you hate me if I cut? Would you hate me if I gave into my addiction that I tried so hard to quit....Would you? I mean it's most likely bound to happen again for me to cut...So why not start now?...Or is the question really WHY START cutting? why get so consumed in it that I might actually go to far? Why?...But life is full of questions, and very little answers....Goodnight everyone.  I hope your lives are at least a little, if not more better than mine...... :("

And hell yeah I know DAMN well that I can be one of the most bitchiest people in the world but still...At least when I'm a bitch I don't IGNORE people and make them feel terrible and stressed and Pissy and crying and sad....I at least tell my friends how I feel...Unlike Stephanie who ignores us and then talks to jill....So does that mean that we arn't her friends? Does that mean that all this fun times and sad times were nothing? That we were just there when she didn't have anyone to go to and we were just some friek'n ppl to take ciggs from and have what I thought were supposed memories....Well I guess that is all that we are to her...Just nothing...And if she reads this she better not say well I tried to keep away from you guys because I know that you would have bitched about my problem...Well YA KNOW WHAT STEPHANIE! YOU FUCK'N TOLD US TO HELP YOU WHEN YOU NEEDED IT AND SHIT, AND WHEN WE DO TRY TO HELP YOU, YOU FUCK'N PUSH US AWAY! HOW THE HELL IS IT THAT WE ARE SUPPOSE TO HELP YOU WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN LET US?!?! Please fuck'n answer that fuck'n question! because molly and I have been trying our hardest to make you happy and help you with your problems and what do you do? You push us away, you fight with our answers to help you, and you ignore us when we sometimes talk to you.  well i'll write later! because mom needs the phone....so I'll bitch about this later!"

Like if we are gunna get engaged...That is a big step, and usually ppl that are engaged live togeather or they at least live close by each other...And we are neither...nor are we engaged...But whenever that would even happened...where will we be? gah wat will we be doing?  idk...This is just one of the MANY things I've been thinking about....So yeah...I kinda wished I wouldn't have called him last night...But I did have 2 questions to ask him so yeah....But it could have waited till I myself was definatly done thinking...But that is okies, I mean I think I have settle most issues...OH PLEASE let me have settled most of the issues...I don't like evil issues...When they arise...It just breaks my heart cuz it's like usually my fault for them...But yeah....God I am in a desperate need of a smoke...and I can't go on break...I mean the only ppl that I go with are Jim, Elana, and Angie..And they are all gone... :( ...Gah, so friek'n bored...Yeah i'm just kinda typing to give me something to do if ya can't tell....So yeah...idk...but when do i know...like never...well i really do, but i never say? is that a possibility? oh yea, i'm rambling on and on and on....GAH! there i go again...I love this song...Lucy in the sky with Dimonds, by the Beatles...They are awesome...I used to listen to them with my dad...Oh the memories...Good memories...eep dad breaking things off with mom...Bad memories...Daddy actually cheated on MY mommy...Oh how heartbroken she must have been to hear that...The only thing I remember of the divorce like when it was told...Was it was at our old house on the farm, and Dad was sitting in his chair (the one at his house right now), and me, Jill, and mom were sitting on the couch (also at dads house right now).  And when he said it...Gah it's gett'n fuzzy now...i don't remember...but yeah...And I remember when we were mov'n out of the farm...Me mom and jill were mov'n to our now old house across the alley...And I was sitting on the stairs that lead upstairs at the farm...And 2 guys (whom i don't remember who they are)And they were carrying this huge mirror downstairs, and i (being 3 at the time) stuck my tounge out at the mirror...Damn...It's getting fuzzy....I don't remember anything else of that day....My memory sux...And it doesn't help that I've blocked basically everything from my past from my memory...But maybe one day I will remember..That would be great...I mean I WANT to remember the past...I want to remember my dad...But I don't know if I wanna remember waiting up for him to get home...Sometimes drunk...or if I wanna remember...like just ####...The waiting up for him was told to me by my mom, so I didn't REALLY remember that...It's just what happened and I was told that it happened...Dad is such a good christian guy...And if you just met him you wouldn't have had a ####'n clue that he was a drunk...or that he used to hit jill...Gah or did drugs....SPEAKING of drugs...I am craving weed...gah i hate to admit it...but i am... 1. i have no one that i know to do it with or has any 2. Matt would KILL me if I did it 3.Friends would hate me for life i think if i did it.....So yeah those are my MAIN 3 reasons why I can't...But I mean I still stick with my origonal thoughts of this is my body and I should get to do what I want...But i probably ain't gunna cuz of matt...And how he friek's out about it when you even bring up the subject of that....But oh well...Oooo plus i really am curious of cocaine..coke...watever you wanna call it...Jill tried it, and told me never to do it...hehe when ppl tell me NOT to do something...It really just makes me wanna do it even more...She says it REALLY ##### you up...And i'm kewl with that...She says she saw things...That just there sounds ####'n awesome...She also says that you don't sleep for like EVER...that would be awesome, I mean I have sleeping problems anyways...And she says that you can't stop moving or doing something...THAT WOULD BE FUN....GAH but my mind is ###### up, and I always think that #### like that sounds fun...Even though I know it's not good for me, and I know matt would hate me forever if I did it...and the thing that stops me is matt....I love him to much...GAH love...I hate the effect that is drives you 2 lol...o man...But i'm used to getting my way and #### so it sux when he says i can't do somthing lol...But i'm okies with it...i GUESS...lol...o man...idk...GAH i just don't ####'n know.....But yeah...well i'm gunna go...cuz i don't have no ####'n clue wat else to type about...later all..."

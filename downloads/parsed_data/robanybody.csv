"event","I thought I'd update just to let everyone know why I took a break from being online a few weeks ago. I know some people were worried at my abrupt departure, and I'm really sorry for that. Thank you to everyone who checked in with me and sent me birthday wishes. Dine, thank you for your wonderful card. It was just what I needed when I needed it. &hearts;

So basically, about a month or so ago, I fucked up my shoulder, and the resulting pinched nerve got bad enough to immobilize me for two days and rendered my right arm useless for two weeks. I'll spare you the details of the endless doctors' visits, the medications that did exactly jackshit, and the panicked, agonizing ER visit that lasted half a day and finally led to the right medications being prescribed to me. What you need to know is that I'm better now, for the most part. I still have some pain in my arm and my fingers are still kind of numb, but I'm not living in constant agony, and I'm no longer passing out in exhaustion from trying to keep it together at work.

(I cried a lot at work from trying to deal with the pain. My co-workers did everything they could to make things better for me, and when that didn't work, they actually went and got my BIL and made him take me to the ER to get checked out. I continue to love my job and the people I work with because they are some of the best people on earth. Also, my BIL is amazing and took good care of me while I was incapacitated. I owe him a lot. He is a very good man.)

Anyway, the last month was hellish and brutal, but I finished my round of medication and am doing weekly massage therapy, so I'm in a much better place. I think I might need a few more massage therapy sessions before I'm back to normal, but for now, I'm basically offline because using the computer for more than five minutes puts too much strain on my arm, which makes work really interesting, let me tell you. I tried commenting on LJ entries today, but I didn't last more than a few minutes before my arm started aching again, so I'm not ready to be online just yet. I've been doing everything through my phone, so if you need to reach me, just email me and I'll get back to you eventually.

I'm sorry for all the birthdays I missed, and all the birthdays I will miss, but I hope your natal day was full of good things and people telling you how important you are to them. If I owe you fic, and I know I do, I will try to get it written as soon as I can handle working on a computer, and I hope it will be worth the wait. I will also make an attempt to read ALL THE FIC, especially Avengers now that I've seen the movie twice, when I get back online. 

I miss you all, and I hope to be back soon.

"event","Taking a break from being online for a while. I've been in intense pain for the last week, and even anti-inflammatories and Percocet don't seem to be making a dent. 

I'll be back when I can type without feeling like someone's sawing off my elbow. Hope you're all doing well.

"event","So I got sick again. And by 'got sick', I mean that I woke up on Thursday with a cough. By the time I got to work, I felt shitty. By the time I was done all my meetings, I was so cold that not even three layers of sweaters could warm me up. By the time it was 2:30, the BIL was worried enough about me to take me to the walk-in clinic to see a dcotor, who promptly diagnosed me with a high fever and shoved a prescription for antibiotics into my shivering hand.

I came home, showered in the hottest water I could stand, and then passed out into coma sleep for about three hours. Woke up, took my meds, couldn't eat anything because antibiotics makes everything taste <i>terrible</i>, and slept for another eight hours. I still felt awful on Friday and stayed home instead of trying to make it in to work. I watched a lot of bad movies and napped on and off all day long with a cat on my lap. I still couldn't eat anything because it all just tasted horrible and eating just brought on nausea, even though I was hungry enough to be nauseous about it. Basically, Friday sucked.

I'm feeling better today, or at least, I'm feeling good enough that I ate a whole piece of toast with cheese on it, and had a cup of tea as well. You know you're feeling better when you can actually drink tea. I will continue this trend of eating cautiously until I get my full appetite back, and then I just have to stop feeling weak and tired and achey. And stop getting sick all the time because holy shit, am I tired of that.

I'm sorry for not answering comments or posts. I'm trying to catch up on everything while I'm still upright. Happy belated birthdays to <lj user=""zombres""> and <lj user=""meus_venator"">. I'm so sorry for missing out on wishing you on your birthdays, but I hope you spent your natal days being venerated for being the quality human beings that you are. &hearts;

Okay, I'm going to go lie down until the world stops spinning.

"event","All of this is being done in a rush because I left my packing for the last minute, which I realize is entirely my fault, but anyway, today I am off on family vacation time so I'm gone for four days of food, stupid family stories, and hot tubbing until I turn into a squid.

Since I won't be around (I plan on not checking my phone every five minutes for once), I want to wish people for their birthdays in advance.

<lj user=""annlarimer"">, <lj user=""o_contrary"">, and <lj user=""rubywisp"">, happy birthday in advance. I hope there are presents and cake and company with people you like who know you and love you, and everyone making a fuss over how great you are. I'm sorry I'll miss it, but I hope it'll be a cavalcade of love on your birthdays. &hearts;

To the rest of you, I will miss you. I hope you have either a happy Easter or just a fabulous weekend of doing whatever you want, and I will be back soon to tell you about all things about me and my family got up to while I was away. There may even be pictures! (Crappy cellphone pictures, but this is not news.)

I'll also answer everything when I come back because I am terrible at managing my time in my personal life, although I do well in my professional life. Go figure.

"event","My sincerest apologies to anyone following me on Tumblr who had to deal with my endless bitching all day. I was trying to be more positive, but then today happened.

So, I've had this pain in the right side of my mouth whenever I eat, and it's been going on for the last week and a half. It's something to do with the crown I had put in six years ago, so I ended up doing the adult, responsible thing and going to see the dentist. She isn't the dentist who did the root canal and put in the crown, but she was really nice and understanding, even while she was whacking my tooth and causing me pain.

It turns out that I have an abscess building up in this misbegotten tooth because some bacteria from a previous infection might have lingered. Joyous. So now my options are root canal treatment, which would fix the abscess and let me keep the crown, but which costs close to $2,000 that I am <i>never</i> going to have. Or I could just extract the tooth for $200 and be on my merry way. I'm going for the tooth extraction because I do not have a spare $1,700 just lying around in case I need dental work done. God, teeth, why do we need them?!

The thing that made me want to cry was when my dentist said, ""It's only $200,"" in reference to the cost of the tooth extraction, and I wanted to tell her that that is a third of my weekly paycheck and there is nothing 'only' about it. Not to mention that it will not be just $200; it'll be $200, plus taxes, plus about a hundred dollars more for the anesthetic because my stupid body has a high tolerance for drugs so it'll take about seven shots of anesthetic to get me numbed enough for any kind of surgery. I shudder to think what'll happen if I ever need major surgery involving anesthetic. They might as well knock me out with a club.

And there is a small, stupid, shallow part of me that doesn't want to lose a tooth because it'll be non-symmetrical, but the practical part of me knows that I have to think short-term now and long-term later, so I'm losing a tooth in two weeks. I'll just have to get over my issues with it.

The thing that got me through today was venting to the BIL about the racism and misogyny discussions happening on Tumblr re: <i>Elementary</i> and <i>The Hunger Games</i> because I was genuinely upset over some of the things being said. I give the BIL shit because he tends to get on my nerves at times, but he is honestly such a good guy. He let me get it all out and made the same points that I had made and was just basically a rock. I love that guy, he is fucking amazing. 

I just want it to be the weekend so I can hide from everything in my pajamas and drink tea and read all the hockey fic and watch all the hockey links <lj user=""misspamela""> and <lj user=""nicolasechs""> sent me.

If you go to the link, you will see the most brilliant tags ever, and now I want an Avengers/Mean Girls fusion. Tony can be Regina, Bruce is Cady, Clint is Gretchen, and Steve is Karen. Natasha can be Janis, Clint can be Damian, and maybe Pepper can be Ms. Norbury. 

I'm not sure who Thor or Nick Fury would be, but basically, I just want this to happen now.

"event","Every time I try to make a post with words instead of videos or pictures or gifs, I just get horribly tired and quit halfway through. I seem to be doing that a lot more lately, so I guess this means another trip to my doctor and more blood tests. Bah!

Anyway, have some good news in point form:

<li>my work contract got extended till September of this year. Which is really wonderful because right now, there are a lot of cuts being planned due to the upcoming budget, and everyone's freaking out right now. So I'm incredibly thrilled that I am staying on at this place for a little while longer. It's still full of amazing people doing amazing work, and I still love it here.

<li>got tickets to go see <i>Young Frankenstein: The Musical</i> with the brother-in-law in May. MY DORKY EXCITEMENT CANNOT BE CONTAINED.  

<li>reserved tickets for the Ottawa Comic Con coming up May 12 to 13 where JEAN-LUC PICARD AND Q ARE ATTENDING. My inner Next Gen nerd is incredibly happy. I will be going with the sister and brother-in-law and we plan to geek the fuck out for a day. Have I mentioned lately how much my birth month is going to rock this year?

<li>am going up to Calaboogie with the family to celebrate Easter. Two more weeks and it's family time! Also, there will be hot tubs and stupid stories. I can't wait.

<li>could possibly be attending Con.txt and meeting <lj user=""misspamela""> if I can get my salary worked out and save enough in time. I want this to happen because omg Miss P hugs!

<li>also, more salary means I can finally save up to go visit Cee and Danny. Hand to heart, this has been a dream of mine for a really long time. It's going to happen, this year or next.

<li>similarly, will (hopefully) finally be meeting <lj user=""charliehey""> this June after ten years of knowing her. FUTURAMA AND MEL BROOKS MARATHONS, HERE WE COME. :D

<li>I will be staying at <lj user=""bookofdays"">' apartment in three weeks and I will finally get to meet her cat. And go see movies with her. I am so excited! &hearts;

Fannish-y things:

<li>watched <i>21 Jump Street</i> and laughed myself into several coughing fits. Besides the fact that this movie clearly doesn't take itself seriously and writes all the filthy humor that appeals to me, there's a real sweetness and affection between the characters that I didn't expect in a movie like this. And not the ""I love you, man"" aspect of it either, but the very real friendship and complicated feelings between Jenko and Schmidt from their high school days to their cop days to the Jump Street program days. 

I kind of want all the gen fic about them being buds and hanging out and cheating at video games and Jenko giving Schmidt tips about not being a nervous sweat bomb in front of women. I also not-so-secretly want stories about Jenko and his teeny, cute science nerd teaching him more about covalent bonds and making out on the couch, but since Jenko/Schmidt is going to become the main pairing of this fandom, I suspect I'm out of luck. Oh, well.

<li>hey, did you know <i>Avengers</i> is coming out soon? WHY IS IT NOT OUT ALREADY? I CAN'T STAND THE WAITING.

<li>bought <i>The Muppets</i> and <i>Tintin</i> on DVD, and watched all the behind-the-scenes stuff for the Muppets movie. You guys, they have interviews with the Muppets, and Miss Piggy and Emily Blunt square off, and Miss Piggy and Kermit mess up a line and kiss in apology, and <i>Deadly shows off his dance moves</i>. And they have a Muppet director and a human director, a monster producer and a human producer, and one Muppet makes a ""key grip"" joke. BEST MOVIE EVER. I still have hearts in my eyes over it.

"event","I have spent the day listening to women making catty comments about how some other women dress, being stuck in a three-hour meeting where everyone argued and no one listened, and have swung between being too hot for a sweater and shivering like I have the flu when I took the sweater off. 

So I have been more than a little ""GRRRRR"" on tumblr, and I'm sorry for that. I promise it'll go back to Futurama and art reblogs and liking every post with Chris Evans' FACE.

In the meantime, have the most adorable puppy gif from <a href=""http://sirona-gs.tumblr.com/page/4"" target=""blank"">sirona-gs's tumblr</a>, which is apparently where joy lives now.

<img src=""http://img407.imageshack.us/img407/3337/doggy.gif"">

I swear to God, the last time I saw a puppy that looked like that, he was on <i>The Muppet Show</i> cuddling with Miss Piggy while Kermit yelled that he was ""not the dog's Dada."" I thought they were muppets, I didn't know they were real dogs!

I need a mug of tea and then I'm going to collapse in my bed and watch my newly acquired second season of <i>Psych</i>. Gus/Shawn forever.

Secondly, here is my favorite thing on the internet today: Mr. B: The Gentleman Rapper - More Kissing in Porn, Please, We're British

<lj-embed id=""216""/>

Finally, a song that speaks to me on a very important level! Seriously, I have opinions on this kind of thing.

I'm going to go have tea and eat ginger cookies. It's a good way to start a Wednesday, I feel.

"event","Here, enjoy the BIL's new theme song for when he calls me on the phone:

<lj-embed id=""214""/>

And if you're wondering why it's so perfect for him, keep in mind that he's the guy who got the Death Star tattooed on his arm to commemorate the fact that just about every single day of his life has led to some kind of Star Wars reference. Yeah, he's <i>that</i> level of geek.

Also, here's the Grimm AU idea I pitched to <lj user=""misspamela""> to keep her entertained in class:

Hank and Wu mutually quit the force after they almost die for the nth time because of Nick's Grimm business and instead open up a private investigation agency. Cue all the banter and/or bickering ever with Hank bitching about having to take pictures of cheating husbands while Wu classes it up with a fedora and his Sam Spade imitation.

And then they fall head-first into a genuine murder mystery and have to dodge bullets and bad men while trying to figure out whodunnit. Nick and Monroe can show up every once in a while to flirt madly and be of absolutely no help, although they will affectionately mock Hank for being the grumpiest PI ever. 

If anyone ever writes that, I will be delighted. And possibly give you a real cookie.

Okay, back to not doing anything while in my pajamas and napping whenever I feel like it. Long live the Sunday morning!

"event","You'd think after not posting for a bit, I'd have exciting things to report, but you'd be wrong. Instead, it's all family health issues I'd rather not talk about, so I spend too much time on Tumblr reblogging art, typography, and all the Avengers stuff that catches my eye. Avengers > real-life problems right now.

So is this just my fantastically bad idea or would this song be perfect for an <i>American Horror Story</i> vid?

Maybe from the point of view of the house and the ghosts? It could work, right?

"event","So the BIL discovered that Jonathan Coulton loves They Might Be Giants and downloaded their entire discography. I will be spending the next few weeks listening to TMBG in the car to and from work, and this is absolutely no problem since they are great.

Of course, listening to them made me think of <i>Tiny Toons</i>, and this video popped into my brain as it was the first time I had ever heard a TMBG song:

<lj-embed id=""211""/>

Although the one I really loved was <a href=""http://www.retrojunk.com/details_commercial/461/"" target=""blank"">Particle Man</a> because it was everything I loved about music and cartoons in one perfect sketch. Oh, Plucky, you and Daffy were always my favorites.

God, I miss Spielberg's wacky cartoon shows, although I will never forgive <i>Hysteria</i> for misleading me on what a vomitorium actually is. That was not what it was used for, writers! I had the wrong idea about Romans for YEARS.

Anyway, I've had a headache for the last two days, but I finally got about eight hours of uninterrupted sleep last night and I'm going to apply St. Hubert's to my face this evening to make up for the entirety of this week. 

Also, naps. This weekend will be made of naps.


p.s. - to all the people on tumblr who keep posting gifs of the new Trek cast and their shenanigans and Chris Pine's ridiculous face: thank you for making me laugh when I would've punched the screen to make the hurting stop. You are all awesome people. &hearts;

"event","So apparently fandom is being shitty over Lucy Liu being cast as Watson. Must be a Wednesday.

Personally, I wish Liu was cast as Sherlock because a) it would be more interesting in terms of story and dynamic, b) Jonny Lee Miller bores me to tears, and c) I'm burned out on misanthropic geniuses solving mysteries with their badass sidekicks, so I'm pretty much out already. I might give it a shot just for Lucy because she is awesome, but quite frankly, I'm already sick of hearing about this show and the wank it creates, and just tired of new shows in general. 

Maybe I'll just go back to watching all the seasons of <i>Murder She Wrote</i> and wanting to be Jessica Fletcher. That's a good life goal for me.

Meanwhile, I'll spend the rest of the day staring at this:

That is just awesome. Period.


<b>Addendum:</b> I've apparently fallen down the Tumblr hole because it turns out that it's easier to use than my brain had previously comprehended. At the very least, it makes posting pictures ridiculously easy, so I'm all set.

So I'm <a href=""http://rob-anybody.tumblr.com/"" target=""blank"">here</a> if anyone feels like following me. The theme is ""EVERYTHING I FIND INTERESTING AND/OR COOL"" and the rest devolves into chaos and fangirl squeeing. It's a lot like following my journal, but with more pictures and less text. Win-win for everyone!

Tell me where you are so I may follow and fangirl you in that order.

Grumblestiltskin
Grumberella
Jack and the Grumblestalk
Grumbelina
Hansel and Grumble
Tom Grump
The Goose That Laid the Golden Grumble

My family is awesome. You know you wish you were us right now.

(Also, I feel like this is a running gag that Monroe would pull when Nick was being cranky, which makes Nick even crankier, which is even more hilarious.)

We watched <strike>an illegal copy of</strike> <i>The Muppets</i> today and I am all nostalgic for the Muppet songs of my youth. Here's one that never stops making me want to dance:

<lj-embed id=""207""/>

The BIL is convinced that I am a Muppet. So far, I haven't come up with any kind of convincing evidence that I'm not. It's hard to argue that you're not made out of felt when you're pretty much the real-life version of Fozzie Bear, you know? I just need a bowtie and a wee hat to complete the look.

"event","Thank you to everyone who has been sending me virtual gifts! Dragons are totally my favorite ever creatures that I wish were real, and blue is my favorite color, so you can see how I would be totally delighted to receive these things. You are all lovely people. &hearts;

Also, to the person who bought more LJ time for me: thank you, thank you, <i>thank you</i>, you magnificently generous person! Seriously, I am wobbly with emotion (the good kind!) over such a gift, and I truly appreciate it. I promise not to ramble on about random crap in return, although I may post more webcomics that reference <i>Doctor Who</i>, if that's what you like. &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;

Incredibly cool thing for today: <a href=""http://mlekopijca.livejournal.com/175202.html#t2047330"" target=""blank"">a genderswap casting for The Avengers</a>. The casting for Nick Fury was just genius, and that post is the first time I <strike>wanted to bang</strike> cared about Loki. 

No lie, I would watch that movie seventeen times in the theater and about a hundred times more on DVD. 

Things that I am enjoying right now:

<li>Grimm - CAGE FIGHT. Also, Captain Renard, you intrigue me. I am halfway to wanting into your pants after that stunt.

Also, where is all the 'Monroe and Nick accidentally end up dating/married and Hank is suspicious and Wu makes all the jokes ever' fic? I cannot find it and I need it! I'm slowly making my way through all the Juliette/Nick/Monroe fics because hello, threesomes, my favorite thing! but I want more bantering and bicker-flirting with all the cops in Portland PD.

<li>H50 - hey, welcome back, show! I've missed you for the past two months, but you're finally back to being the show I love and adore. (Although I am still displeased with the way you handled Lori, but at this point, I'm resigned to the fact that you fuck up any woman who isn't Kono, so I'm going to handwave it for now.) Please keep it up. I want to continue loving you and making heart-eyes at the whole team being family again.

<li>Person of Interest - seriously, how does this show keep getting better and better with each episode? I never thought I'd watch anything with Jim Cavizel, let alone enjoy it, but I am riveted every week. Also, CARTER IS THE BEST EVER OMFG. I love, love, love her beyond any kind of coherent articulation.

So, who's writing the Human Target/Person of Interest crossover that lives in my head? The one where Reese and Chance both end up trying to help the same person and being distrustful of each other while working together, Guerrero and Finch threaten each other over various technology while secretly being impressed with the other, and Winston makes various D-faces, tries to avoid Carter who is onto them, and tries to figure out what the hell is going on while yelling at Finch and Guerrero every chance he gets. C'mon, I can't be the only one who's thought of this.

So this happened yesterday:

<b>Brother-in-law:</b> ""Blah, blah, blah, Angry Birds have to kill the pigs, this is what I mean."" <i>[loads up Angry Birds on the sister's iPod Touch and launches a bird at the pig]</i>
<b>Sister:</b> ""Oh! I had no idea what you were talking about. Anyway, give the Touch to Nettie and let's go. You have to drive me to the party.""
<b>Me:</b> <i>[ten minutes into playing Angry Birds]</i> ""Oh, goddammit, I will not let you defeat me, you stupid, cute pigs. YOU GO SQUISH NOW.""

An hour later, the BIL comes back home and this conversation takes place.

<b>Brother-in-law:</b> ""Hey, you're still playing the game.""
<b>Me:</b> ""Yeah, but I suck at it. I'm still on level five.""
<b>Brother-in-law:</b> ""That's so cool. Not that you're on level five, that's just sad. But that you're still playing it.""
<b>Me:</b> ""This just proves that I am shitty at videogames, like I've said all along!""
<b>Brother-in-law:</b> ""You know you can just hit the birds in the air and they explode into threes, right?
<b>Me:</b> ""...what?""
<b>Brother-in-law:</b> ""You tap the birds in the air and they break off into three birds and hit everything. If you time it right, you can--""
<b>Me:</b> ""Yes! Yes! I am winning! I am beating you, you stupid game! I AM THE QUEEN OF ANGRY BIRDS.""

Truth: I am actually not the queen of Angry Birds, but I'm having too much fun playing the game. I just want to get to the level with the exploding birds. That can't be so hard, can it?

<lj user=""misspamela""> has already promised to inform my family, who will clearly never see me again, that I love them.

"event","Over a week ago, <lj user=""lillian13""> told me she was going to send me something in the mail, and like every cartoon character ever, I waited impatiently by the mailbox for it to show up. 

Or rather, I was excited for a few hours and then totally forgot that entire conversation and the existence of a present in the mail for me because I have the memory of a goldfish. Also, I've been sick, so I think this totally excuses the fact that I can't remember anything for more than fifteen minutes.

So when I got home today and found a package in the mail for me, I was surprised! And confused! And then surprised all over again! It was like a never-ending loop of intrigue and head-scratching as I tried to figure out what I'd bought and whether I was turning into a Patton Oswalt routine as I age disgracefully.

Halfway through opening it, I remembered <lj user=""lillian13"">, and when I finally got the whole thing open, I pretty much squealed with joy:

<img src=""http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/6679/puppetsi.jpg"" width=""400"">

Eeeeeeeeeeee! Thank you so much, bibi! My utter delight cannot be textually rendered, but please know that I LOVE THEM TO PIECES AND ADORE YOU FOR THINKING OF ME WHEN YOU SAW THEM.

So of course, I made them do this the minute no one was looking:

<img src=""http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/2694/puppets2n.jpg"">

Once again, thank you for such an awesome gift. I love them so much. If you want anything -- fanmix, fic, icon, graphic -- please just ask, and I will make it for you. It is the least I can do for the amount of joy you've just dropped into my life. &hearts;

You want to know the absolute best part? Wil Wheaton was involved in its creation. Because Wil and Joel are kind of besties and Wil is constantly daring Joel on Twitter to make geeky comics. 

This is, like, the apex of nerdery.

And before you ask, I've already begged the family for <a href=""http://sharksplode.com/fighting-time-lords/"" target=""blank"">the shirt</a> for my birthday. Because the Fighting Time Lords is exactly the kind of thing I would wear out in public.

Seriously, I have hearts in my eyes right now.

(I am not reading the comments for this article because I just know that a) idiots won't get it, and b) there will be more jackholes saying stupid, sexist things. I'm just going to re-read the article and bask in its awesomeness.)

More awesomeness: Sara Quin (of Tegan & Sara) and Jonathan Coulton do a studio version of <i>Still Alive</i>.

<lj-embed id=""206""/>

There's a theremin! Also, confirmation that Sara Quin is a nerd makes me happy beyond belief.

Am skipping <i>Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance</i> because it is ONLY available in 3D. (Good job, Hollywood, I'm not watching that until it comes out on DVD now.) Instead, I will be watching Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds <strike>flirt with</strike> chase each other in <i>Safe House</i>. After that, it'll be a three-day weekend for me because I get Family Day off.

Everything is fantastic today.

"event","Happy things for today:

<li>thank you to all you amazing, lovely people who sent me hearts today! It was a wonderful surprise and I haven't stopped smiling yet. I love you all a lot. &hearts;

<li>on Sunday, I put together all my Ikea boxes that I bought a few weeks ago and arranged all my CDs and DVDs. This means that everything in my bedroom has now been put away neatly and I have a floor again. I cannot even begin to tell you how good it feels to have all my stuff in its place, although I feel like I should mention that I keep walking around my room and marveling at the amount of space I have now that I don't have big boxes cluttering up the floor.

Shit, my room is big.

<li>I found all my Tragically Hip CDs! It's weird how much nostalgia I have for the Hip, considering that I was never a huge fan of theirs when I was younger. Now, though, their music reminds me of being young and belonging to Canada, even though I was new to the country.

It also reminds me of when MuchMusic played interesting music and had a national identity and wasn't just a third-rate MTV clone playing useless crap. I can't believe I actually <strike>remember</strike> miss Erica Ehm. *is old*

<li>my boss gave me a teeny pot with a cluster of tiny roses in them. So pretty! These are apparently self-watering, so at least they won't die on me. I don't have a green thumb, but even I can keep self-watering roses alive.

<li>I just found out that Sarah Slean has a double album that she released last year, which means new Sarah Slean music for meeeeee! Hello, fantabulous birthday present, why are you not in my hands yet?

Guys, I've been listening to Sarah's amazing voice for about eleven years now. She is, hands-down, one of my favorite artists of all time, and I own just about all of her albums, except for the ones I can't find in print anymore. To find out that she has a new album, one with a rock side and an instrumental side, is like finding out that Santa isn't a giant robot with a bazooka aimed at you, but more like a jolly fat man with a giant sack of presents for you.

Basically, best news ever! 

<li>shall be seeing <i>Ghost Rider 2</i> in theaters this Friday for Idris Elba's FACE. I don't even care how wretched the movie is, I'm paying money for it so that I can see Idris look good in a leather jacket and hear his lovely British accent. Don't even judge me for this because just look at the man and tell me you wouldn't do the same.

Also, here's a book series rec: Jonathan L. Howard's Johannes Cabal series. A dark, funny series about an analytical German necromancer who wants to defeat death, is just terrible with people, and gets into all sorts of shenanigans through no real fault of his own. I really love it because the humor is dry and warped, the characters are interesting, and Johannes himself is a good anti-hero who you can't help but like, even as he does less-than-good things. And the first book discusses the absurdity of the bureaucracy of Hell, which, if you've known me for any length of time, is exactly the kind of thing that I <i>love</i> to read about. 

Plus, it is honestly laugh-out-loud funny at times. The brother-in-law and I spent a lot of our time stifling our giggles because we were reading it at work and we didn't want to attract attention. It's a lot like reading <i>Good Omens</i>, but with a German necromancer in the lead. 

So happy Valentine's Day, everyone! Or happy Tuesday in general!

"event","Things heard way too frequently around my house:

""Do you want to watch <i>Grimm</i>?""
""Don't you mean... <b>the Grim</b>?""
""Where's that from again?""
""Harry Potter.""
""Oh my God, you nerd!""
""Grimmy grimm.""
""Shut up and watch the show.""

""Oopsy-doodle!""

""Hey, kitty. Who's got a little face?""
""...what?""
""Shut up, I'm allowed to say stupid things to the cats.""

""Are you mad at me?""
""No, why?""
""You have a mad look on your face.""
""...<i>that's just my face</i>.""

""God, you're so sensitive.""
""WHAT? Wahhhhhhhhhh, you're so mean to me!""
""Siiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.""

""Frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrost!""
(This is why my sister is not allowed to watch <i>Blade</i> in the house anymore because she's got us all doing it.)

""WHAT?""
""YEAH.""
""OKAY.""
(If you haven't watched Dave Chapelle playing Lil Jon on <i>The Chapelle Show</i>, none of this will make sense.)

""Haha! You love me. Stupid.""

""Wocka wocka.""

""You know he was on <i>The Wire</i>, right?""

""Filthy neutrals with their hearts full of neutrality!""

And then the BIL and I discussed which Muppets would play which Avenger and here's what we came up with:

Kermit = Nick Fury
Miss Piggy = Natasha Romanov/Black Widow
Sam the Eagle = Steve Rogers/Captain America
Fozzie = Clint Barton/Hawkeye
Animal = The Hulk
Beaker = Dr. Bruce Banner
Scooter = Phil Coulson

I still have no idea who would play Tony Stark, Thor, or Loki, but I will probably spend the rest of the day thinking about that.


<b>Addendum:</b> the first two suggestions are courtesy of <lj user=""laughingacademy"">'s mad genius.

Gonzo the Great - Tony Stark
Camilla - Pepper Potts
Waldorf & Statler - Thor & Loki

"event","So I was reading one of those free romance e-books that comes with Meep (my Kobo reader, named brilliantly by <lj user=""sinden"">) and wanting to smack the crap out of the lead characters because they're kind of stupid in the way that most romance novel characters are stupid if you want to make the book last more than ten pages. Anyway, I was reading it and, even though the characters weren't described anything close to this, this is how I pictured them:

Needless to say, I am now rooting for these crazy kids to make it through whatever idiotic misunderstanding is keeping them apart because no one ever has a real conversation to clear up their problems in stories like these. You can make it, you two!

Also, I want someone to write me endless porn where these two get naked and sweaty together.

Still sick, but I had a blast with Ron seeing <i>Haywire</i> and loosing my sister on her for the first time. Next up on my movie list: <i>Man on a Ledge</i> (Jamie Bell, get in my pants! still!) and <i>Spaceballs</i> in the theater this Wednesday as part of the digital film festival.

It's going to be a good week.

"event","I have been sick since yesterday. And by 'sick', I mean that I am so congested, I have an ongoing headache and problems sleeping at night because I can't breathe properly. And by 'yesterday', I mean that I am on the verge of ripping out my nostrils and lungs so that I can finally get some form of rest from all the sneezing, snotty tissues, and coughing. Stupid body, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST WORK PROPERLY?

God, everything sucks so much right now. I miss being able to breathe without setting off a coughing fit. I'd even take being able to smell the awful stench of rotting food in our lunchroom if it meant that I could breathe normally again. UGH.

I did buy Gotye and Feist's most recent albums, as well as <i>The Great Muppet Caper</i>, so at least there's some bright spots on the miserable, sniffling horizon. Plus, I am going out to have dinner and see <i>Haywire</i> with Ron and the sister tomorrow, so that's really all that's keeping me going right now.

"event","Today, I have all the cute underwear in various shades of red and hot pink, so I am set for the year. This will come in handy for calming me down in February when I will want to stab everything in the face because I am sick to fucking death of winter, snow, and ice. It's preventative retail therapy, and people will thank me for it in about two weeks.

Also, I took a picture at the grocery store of my sister pretending to eat a huge half-wheel of freshly made Parmesan cheese. Because dorkhood runs in this family. 

Since Megaupload went tits-up a few days ago, I had to re-upload my <a href=""http://robanybody.livejournal.com/587765.html"" target=""blank"">last</a> <a href=""http://robanybody.livejournal.com/588242.html"" target=""blank"">three</a> <a href=""http://robanybody.livejournal.com/588804.html"" target=""blank"">fanmixes</a> to sites that aren't stupid enough to basically taunt the FBI into prosecuting them (as I have seen reported in the news, but who knows how accurate that is?). So if you missed them the first time or need to download them again for various reasons, there they are. I'm not sure how long the Sandman Slim mix will remain on Sendspace (probably thirty days), but if it expires, I'll consider putting it up on another website (that can handle over 200 mb of music) if people actually want to download it some more (I just really like parentheses).

I am completely and utterly exhausted from doing groceries and some much-needed clothes shopping. I am torn between irritation at being so fatigued and ignoring all my feelings in favor of a long nap. Either way, I'm going to have a nice cup of English tea, curl up with my Kobo to read more H.G. Wells, and maybe paint my nails a nice fuschia if I feel up for it.

God bless the weekends.

"event","TV thoughts:

<li>H50 - you are on serious fucking notice with me after this week's episode. Any more bullshit and I will be done with you. The only reason you even get another chance was because of Rachel and Sang Min's existences this week, but you are skating on thin ice with everything else. Whatever you're doing to be cool, stop it because you SUCK at it. Be better, goddammit.

<li>Jeeves & Wooster - haaaaaaaaaaart! Everything about this show is delightful and makes me want to give PG Wodehouse another try. (I quit trying to get into him when I was younger, but I might have been too hasty.) Also, Stephen Fry and his bedroom eyes, rawr. I am a little unsettled by how attractive I find him when he plays Jeeves, considering that, to me, he's always been more like the charming uncle who occasionally says stupid shit that you forgive him for because you adore him so much. I'm not used to finding him fuckable. :O

<li>Castle - I love this show, even though I am getting a little tired <lj-cut text=""possible spoiler, I guess"">of the conspiracy thing. But I tend to hate conspiracies in general (my least favorite <i>X-Files</i> episodes dealt with the conspiracy arc, and I gave up on that show once it became the main focus), so I can't really fault the show for that; it's clearly my problem.</lj-cut> 

Still, I love everyone. Beckett and Castle continue to be fabulous together, Esposito and Ryan are even more bromantical now that Ryan's married, and Martha and Alexis are the best people ever. &hearts; <lj-cut text=""Spoiler?"">Also, what was the name of that cute, hot actress who ran the Dial A Goddess service? I kind of fell madly in love with her, especially with the glasses and the hair in a bun. Thank you for that, show!</lj-cut>

<li>Lewis: this show should totally be called <i>Oxford Behaving Badly</i> because the cases, oh my God! I watch them with my jaw dropped to the floor. But ugh, Lewis and Hathaway make me so happy with their quiet friendship and sly banter and how they're always poking around each others' lives, trying to get a peek in.

On a more serious note, I really do appreciate how they portray Muslims, and minorities in general, on this show. I'm on series three, and from what I've seen so far, they get to be people, complex and complicated with needs and desires like everyone else, without being pigeonholed as victims or villains. I really appreciate that. 

These days, whenever I watch shows and there are PoCs involved, I start to cringe in advance because I know there's a good chance there will be some awful stereotype that I will have to work hard to handwave so I can enjoy the rest of the episode. Like every time <i>NCIS</i> had an Arab character or a terrorist plotline, I had to sigh and mentally disregard everything that wasn't team banter or Abby and Gibbs being cute together because otherwise, I would've been ragey throughout the entire episode. And honestly, that shit's exhausting. 

But I don't have to do that with <i>Lewis</i>, and I really can't articulate enough how glad I am of that. I don't want to have to work so hard just to enjoy a show, I have other things to do with my life.

(<lj  user=""lamardeuse"">, I have watched Life Born of Fire and AFJDSK WHAT IS THIS SHOW? And how is it that everyone on this show ships Lewis and Hathaway, <i>including Innocent, their boss</i>, jfk? What did you get me into?!

However, I am a big schmooper and just want to write tons of Lewis/Hathaway where they trade quips and quotes and Lewis complains about literary references and Hathaway makes faces at Lewis' musical choices and Hobson shows up every once in a while to ask after Hathaway and roll her eyes when Lewis pretends not to know what she's talking about. 

God, what is my life and its choices?)

<li>Futurama - from the beginning. Yup, still as awesome and hilarious as I remember it. Bender continues to be my favorite while I continue to be Leela, apparently.

I have drunk a lot of tea in the last two days. I think I might be well enough to go into work tomorrow. I'll let you know.

"event","I spent yesterday at home drinking tea and watching TV because I was as sick as a dog. I'm still sick today, but I'm making an attempt to go into work because I can't really afford to take time off to be sick. I doubt I'll make it since I'm coughing hard enough to not be able to breathe, but at least I got dressed this morning.

So yesterday I watched all of <i>Ziegfeld Follies</i> instead of just 'The Babbitt and the Bromide', like I always do, for Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire in a dance-off with Sigmund Freud beards at the end. Besides that, this is my other favorite bit from the movie:

<lj-embed id=""204""/>

Goddamn, I love Judy Garland. I didn't like her much as a kid because I only ever knew her from <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> and I hate that movie (I know, I know, I'm a terrible person), but as I get older and watch her in more stuff, the more I discover how amazingly talented and funny she was. 

Also, finished series one of <i>Lewis</i> wherein one of the episodes had an actual, canon undercover-boyfriends moment and I about fell out of my chair with glee. God, I love this show and cannot wait to watch the rest of the seasons.

Ugh. I think I might go lie down. I feel so sick that I don't trust myself to stand right now.

"event","There is a long, boring explanation for why I ended up making a fanmix for <i>2 Broke Girls</i>, but the short version is: I really didn't mean to, it just sort of happened. And I wish the show were better so I wouldn't be embarrassed about liking it, but since it's got two female leads being dysfunctional friends and talking about things other than guys, I'll take it for now.

I also did not mean to use songs from other famous musicals for this fanmix, but a) if you think of the story of Caroline and Max as a frothy musical about horses, friendship, and cupcakes, it kind of makes everything better, and b) if Tarantino can do it for his soundtrack, I can do it for my fanmix. Why should he have all the fun?

Love and thanks to <lj user=""charliehey""> for listening to this ahead of time and letting me know what worked and what didn't. She is the queen of everything, and also a premier song-stitcher. Basically, she is amazing and I'm lucky to have her in my life. 

Medafire, graphics included, and I apologize for the absurd cupcake fantasy number I have in the middle of the mix, but as usual, only I think I'm funny, and you all have to suffer as a result. 

Hopefully, the music will make up for all of this.

I have started watching <i>Jeeves & Wooster</i>, and it's hilarious. I had forgotten how much I used to like Wodehouse when I was younger, or that Hugh Laurie used to play British idiots so well. Also, they are so in love. It's not even funny how in love they are. I'm only on the second episode, but I cannot wait to watch all the seasons.

Plus, Hugh playing the piano and singing beautifully, and all the costume porn I can handle. Oh, this show. &lt;3

"event","This is what I was looking at all day while chaos was raining down around me:

<img src=""http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/6650/70969902.jpg"">

It's saved as 'oh captain my captain' because OH STEVE.

Also, has anyone written the story where Steve mentions to Tony in passing that he used watch the Busby Berkeley musicals when he was a kid and it's too bad they don't make movies like that anymore because he really loved them? And Tony kind of blinks at him like he wasn't expecting that, but the next day when Steve comes down for breakfast, Jarvis has all the musicals ever cued up for him to watch, and Steve is kind of ridiculously happy and touched by the whole thing.

And it turns out that he likes all the usual suspects - Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and the like - but it surprises him how much he loves the modern musicals too. He loves The Phantom of the Opera and has to wipe away tears at the end, he is enthralled by West Side Story and Rent, he laughs at the Muppets movies (which Tony only put in there because Sam the Eagle reminds him so much of Steve, but in a good way), he learns all the songs in Mamma Mia! and sings them in a pleasant enough baritone that Natasha doesn't threaten to disembowel him, even though she hates ABBA, and he isn't quite sure how to react to The Producers, especially the Springtime For Hitler song, but he does enjoy the dance numbers and the chorus girls.

And then maybe Steve dances by himself around the house, trying to imitate moves he saw in the movies, and someone catches him doing it and teaches him to dance properly? It can be anyone, although I really like the idea of Pepper teaching him to waltz properly because he would be bashful and she would be gentle with him, and eventually Peggy would come up, and they could talk about her over tea (Pepper loves Earl Grey, Steve is addicted to peppermint) and Steve could finally have someone to talk to about all his feelings while Pepper would enjoy having a conversation that isn't work or Tony-related.

I just want Pepper and Steve being BFFs. Is that so wrong?

"event","Yesterday morning was spent dealing with jerks on the road and this morning was spent dealing with even more jerks on the road. I am just going to stare at this picture all day until the urge to smack people goes away.

<img src=http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/7599/wexrz6i9kyerre9.jpg>

I have been shipping Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse since I was a pre-teen because <a href=""http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/535/tumblrlpztmcq7ts1qk9xnh.jpg/"" target=""blank"">look</a> at <a href=""http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/822/080617cydcharissevmed23.jpg/"" target=""blank"">them</a>. 

Also, she called him ""delicious,"" which secretly thrills me.

Also, they had chemistry that was obvious even to me, and I'm oblivious most of the time.

Also, I wish there were a ton of RPF of them having torrid affairs and trading wisecracks and him ogling her legs and her appreciating his perfect ass. The fact that there isn't any makes me sadface.

I have rice and my mom's meatball curry for lunch. This might help with how ridiculous I am today.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Sometimes, I get cranky about TV. H-50 deserves my wrath this season."">Every major story arc of <i>Hawaii Five-O</i> this season:

<b>Joe:</b> ""I know the secret of the thing your dad was working on that led to him and your mom being killed. But I won't tell you.""
<b>Steve:</b> ""Tell me.""
<b>Joe:</b> ""No.""
<b>Steve:</b> ""Tell me!""
<b>Joe:</b> ""No.""
<b>Steve:</b> ""TELL ME.""

[Joe goes off and kidnaps the head of the Yakuza in front of dozens of witnesses, <i>including the man's son</i>, gets blamed for his murder, and gets the unadulterated shit kicked out of him by the son when the police won't do a damn thing]

<b>Steve:</b> ""Look, I know you're doing some shady shit and now the cops think you killed Hiro, so just level with me already.""
<b>Joe:</b> ""I'm doing this for your own safety, son.""
<b>Steve:</b> ""Tell me.""
<b>Joe:</b> ""No.""
<b>Steve:</b> ""Just tell me.""
<b>Joe:</b> ""You know, a few decades ago, I could have had you brought up on subordination charges.""
<b>Steve:</b> ""You're not my commanding officer anymore <strike>asshole</strike>. FUCKING TELL ME ALREADY.""
<b>Joe:</b> [leaves in a huffy, self-righteous way]
<b>Me:</b> ""Oh, you can just FUCK RIGHT OFF.""

Memo to the show: Joe White is the most boring fucking plot point ever. Have him reveal his knowledge and move on already, so I can stop grinding my goddamn teeth every time he's onscreen. HE ADDS NOTHING TO THE SHOW AND TAKES AWAY FROM OTHER CHARACTERS THAT ACTUALLY MATTER. Seriously, fuck Joe White. You are dragging out a storyline that could've been satisfactorily resolved in a few episodes and without Terry O'Quinn wasting his time acting like Gibbs. How is it that most of fandom is vitriolic toward Lori when Joe is the most useless, charmless character ever?

Every couple of weeks, I steel myself to watch the episodes of this show piling up on the DVR, hoping against hope that it'll go back to being the show I loved, hoping it'll capture at least a smidgen of its past charm and humor. And just when the show manages an episode that reminds me while I fell in love with it in the first place, it's immediately followed by an episode that slaps me in the goddamn face and asks me what the hell do I think I'm doing watching it. 

Stop failing, show, and go back to being the thing I loved best. Or at least fucking fail hard and get canceled, but stop jerking me around like this. You're killing what little good feeling I have left, and I don't have the patience for that shit anymore.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Sherlock, on the other hand, was fantastic."">A Scandal in Belgravia: ALL OF IT. I loved all of it to a degree that is possibly not healthy for me. Irene Adler was always my favorite, but she is so goddamn magnificent here. I loved her so much and could totally see why Sherlock was disarmed and compelled by her. And that scene where he came for her at the end and the smile on her face, gahhhhh. I don't read any fic for BBC Sherlock, but I would read anything involving Irene, Sherlock, and John, whether it was gen, het, or slash. I just want them to play the game with each other all the time.

Also, MRS. HUDSON IS MY HERO. My God, I adore that woman. I love how fiercely she protects John and Sherlock and how fiercely they protect her back. Plus, she's totally sneaky and she calls Sherlock a ""clod,"" so I was pretty much in love even more than before.

I really adore Molly, and I'm glad she finally called Sherlock on his dickish behavior. I'm equally pleased that he apologized for being so awful to her. Now, Molly, go seduce the handsome detective inspector with the silver hair and forget about Sherlock. You need a smart, funny, uncomplicated man who won't make you cry or commit crimes behind your back, and Lestrade is perfect for a good roll in the hay.

The Buckingham Palace scene was a hoot. As was the deerstalker hat. Oh, show. &hearts;___________&hearts;</lj-cut>

I had tea and shortbread cookies. It helped. As did finding my copy of <i>Passion & Profession</i> in the mail today, eeeeeeeeeeeee! It is the most beautiful thing ever and I cannot wait to <strike>rub it against</strike> hold it to my bosom. <lj user=""demon_rum"">, you are fantastic. &hearts;</lj-cut>

"event","This gif sums up all my feelings: 

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/robanybody/pic/00fsq1w3"">

Happy birthday, <lj user=""amy_vic"">! She is wonderful and talented and I like her. I hope your birthday is excellent to you, bibi.

And Happy New Year's, you guys! I hope you all had wonderful celebrations and will have an excellent 2012. 

I am a lazy bastard, so I didn't do any of the memes or resolutions and such, but I did spend all day at the movie theater yesterday and rung in the new year by watching season one of <i>Black Books</i> and randomly texting people, so it was a good day.

Things that make me happy:

<li>watching <i>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol</i> and shipping the hell out of Benjy (Simon Pegg) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner). It's the first time I've enjoyed an MI movie, and that's probably because it didn't take itself so seriously for once. Kudos to the writers, producers, and director for crafting a totally enjoyable action movie. 

Also, Michael Nyquist is very attractive. Well done, Sweden!

Also, Anil Kapoor! Dude, I have been watching your family in movies for years. How awesome are you?

Also, Paula Patton. Le rawr-rawr!

<li>watched <i>Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn</i> and aiiiigh, everything was so gorgeously rendered and wonderful and perfect. I didn't think Spielberg could do this movie justice, but he did, and I'm so happy I finally got to see it. (I had to try very hard to ignore the vibes between Tintin and Haddock because I do not want to see slash in my childhood books. But Haddock's face when he disappointed Tintin-- afjsdk NO.)

<li>watched <i>Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows</i> with the BIL since he hadn't seen it yet and both of us laughed and loved it to pieces. I still continue to be delighted by <lj-cut text=""wee spoiler"">HOLMES ON A PONY. Seriously, the entire callback to <i>Two Mules for Sister Sara</i> is the most delightful thing for me because I LOVED that movie growing up, so kudos to the movie for putting that in there.</lj-cut>

Also, after seeing the movie, the BIL is totally convinced that Sherlock is desperately in love with Watson, which is pretty much the main theme of the movie. I approve, and want all the Sherlock/Mary/Watson stories out there. Someone has to have written them, right? It's practically canon at this point.

<li>made the BIL watch <i>Blazing Saddles</i> and <i>The Producers</i> (the musical), and he loved both. Now I just need to make him watch <i>Young Frankenstein</i> and his conversion to Brooksian humor will be complete.

<li>2012 seems to be the Year of Tatum, which is awesome. I will be watching all his movies in the theater, possibly on opening night. GIVE HIM MORE COMEDIES, HOLLYWOOD, HE'S REALLY GOOD AT THAT. Watch <i>She's the Man</i> if you don't believe me.

<li>all of YOU. &lt;3

Things that make me sad:

<li>whyfor no Benjy/Brandt? Seriously, competency and bickering and Brandt's wee, cranky face when Benjy's explaining the plan to him.

<li>I do not have enough time to read all the things I want to read, online and off. Boo.

<li>I have been messing around with Paypal for two weeks so that I can finally pay the people I need to pay, and I have been tripped up by the fact that I couldn't remember who was my favorite author in the '90s when I created this fucking account. Sigh. So I made a whole new account and money should be outgoing in the next few days, but goddamn, that was frustrating.

<li>I am not home with my parents right now, having a big Indian breakfast and my dad's fresh-brewed coffee, talking about ridiculous things and trading work horror stories. :(

<li>I have not met all of you and given you hugs in person. I am trying to save up money so that I can do this soon. I owe a whole bunch of people who have known me forever a lot of squeezy hugs.

And now I go to pick up my sister from Kingston, bring her home, and spend the rest of the day doing nothing. Ah, 2012, I'm greeting you in style.

Secondly, I'm bored at work. Here, have Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly dancing in chairs and being <i>adorable</i> together:

I have so many hearts in my eyes, I can't see any of my work.

Also, Maurice Chevalier and Hermione Gingold singing <i>I Remember It Well</i>, which my mother used to sing to me as a kid, along with <i>Thank Heavens for Little Girls</i>. There is a reason I grew up loving Maurice. :D

I remember watching this with <lj user=""shmanny""> and discussing how much strength it would take to be able to kick out like that while crouched down. Gene Kelly still makes my heart flutter, but oh Donald O'Connor, you are right up there.

I'm going to do laundry, talk to Jen, and watch all the musicals I have in an attempt to cheer me up. Later, I might even post a clip of Maurice Chevalier (favoritest omg!) singing in <i>Gigi</i> if I can find it.

"event","I am having such a joyous Noel this year that I can't even describe how happy I am right now. I got the two gifts I really wanted -- a Kobo e-reader and a gorgeous green purse with long straps -- and have spent the last few hours uploading ALL the free Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie novels that I could find. <lj user=""misspamela""> is a total superstar and offered to send me all the romance novels my Kobo could handle without giving up in protest, and I transferred all my stuff from my old bag to my new and have been gazing lovingly at it for hours now. 

But the best part of this holiday was seeing the looks on my family's faces when they saw the gifts they got. My mom got some pretty clothes and handmade copper earrings that went perfectly with her outfits, which thrilled her because she never buys herself anything pretty, even when she really wants to, so she loved this. Since the brother has been doing his version of art therapy and sketching up a storm, we got him an easel set with extra oil paints, brushes, and graphic pencils. And since my dad finally has his appetite back after the chemo, we got him a huge bagful of foods: jams, oatcakes, cheeses, salsas, and everything else we could fit in without breaking the bag. 

We hugged each other and laughed and traded stories and hugged each other some more, and basically, we had a wonderful Christmas. After the rough patches of this year, it was nice to sit together and be happy and be a family together. All my materialism aside, that was the best Christmas gift ever: just being together and still loving each other to want to be with each other for Christmas. It's something I didn't think I'd get this year, but I did, and I'm so grateful for it.

I am also grateful to all of you for being in my life. Please understand that I honestly would not have made it through this year without your support, your caring, your opinions and thoughts and art and everything you do that makes my life a better life. You guys were right there when I needed someone to talk to, someone to hold me while I cried, to distract me and make me laugh when I was anxious, and to just generally be amazing people that I am glad to know and have in my life. Thank you for letting me into your lives and joining in mine. 

That was totally sappy, wasn't it? Right, INSERT DICK JOKE HERE. I love you all like cake, you guys. Have a wonderful holiday/weekend and I hope your lives are full of love and other good things.

"event","Point #1: comments on my LJ posts are working, but I still cannot comment to other journal entries. This is irritating, but somehow, life goes on. Insert your usual 'godDAMMIT, Livejournal' rant here.

Point #2: I have caught up on <i>American Horror Story</i> and have thoughts on it. Here are those thoughts.

<lj-cut text=""Actual thinky thoughts on American Horror Story. Mentions of violence and rape, so skip if you don&#39;t want to read."">
<li>so I have been reading the <a href=""http://tvrecaps.ew.com/tv-show/american-horror-story/"" target=""blank"">AHS recaps</a> over on Entertainment Weekly's website because I love Jeff Jensen's thoughts. He points out interesting things I had missed, explains pop culture references that not everyone might get, and connects things to bits of literature that flesh out the story a little bit more. His recaps are truly amazing, and if you watch AHS, I would recommend reading them because they're just really smart, funny, and full of fascinating tidbits that make you think.

But that's not the point of this point. The point of this point is that I have been reading the comments, and the thing I have noticed the most on the EW posts is that there are a lot of people were heartbroken by the revelation that Tate is a) a psychotic mass murderer, and b) the rapist and father of Vivien's baby. The consensus seems to be that he was so caring and careful with Violet, that he genuinely loved her, and surely that meant he could be redeemed.

And I kind of feel like a horrible cynic for thinking this, but, uh, no. No matter how sweet and loving Tate is, no matter how much he takes care of Violet and protects her, <i>nothing</i> he does can erase what he's done. I never felt that there was redemption for Tate because the minute I found out that he had shot up his school and killed so many students, that was the end of any tender feelings I might have had for him. 

And everything I have found out about him since then just makes me root for him even less. He goes on a mass murder spree, he kills Chad and Pat and rapes Pat with a poker after (an unnecessary, vicious act), he rapes Vivien and gets her pregnant, he had set Larry on fire in a flashback, and attacks Ben when Ben threatens to take Violet away from the house. He did the worst stuff <i>after</i> he was dead, and what he did when he was alive was bad enough. Nothing about these actions makes me think that Tate could be rehabilitated, that he deserved forgiveness, and thus, I was, and am, astonished that people were actually rooting for Tate. 

This is not to say that I don't have sympathy for the guy, either. He went through hell being Constance's kid, and I understand where his fury and hate came from, and I genuinely feel sad for the life he suffered through when he was alive. I don't hate Tate, but I can't excuse the awful, horrific shit he has done, whether it was for himself or at others' requests. Violet pointed out that he never paid for what he had done, that he had never been brought to justice for the lives he took and the pain he caused, and I agree with her completely. I also think that being taken away from Violet is not punishment enough for what he did, but I would have never been able to write a show with all these layers, so ignore me.

I hope season two proves me wrong, though. I would love to see Tate finally admit to every terrible thing he ever did and feel genuine remorse for it, not just admitting some things and squirming away from the rest when Violet calls him on it. I would like to not dislike him so much for a change.

<li>this is the most important point to me, but: has anyone noticed that this entire show is about female anger? 

Let me backtrack: a few weeks ago, <lj user=""nilchance""> posted a link that talked about women's anger and how it's never really acknowledged or taken seriously, how women never allow themselves to feel anger because society has conditioned them to not let themselves get angry. And I thought about this article while I was watching AHS because this show is all about the ways women get angry, the way these women show their anger, the ways that their anger has the power to shape reality in that house.

Hayden is anger personified. When she's alive, she is furious that she's shunted aside so easily after Ben had taken everything he needed from her, angry that her baby isn't as important as Vivien's; when she's dead, her rage just overtakes her and governs her every action and reaction. She is a woman scorned and she makes the world around her pay for every slight, every time she was pushed away, every time she was judged for having an affair with a married man and trying to matter to him. 

And the thing I love about this show is that it takes Hayden's anger seriously. Her anger is completely and totally reasonable with how shabbily she has been treated, and she is allowed to express it as loudly and as often as she wants. It goes to scary places once she's dead, but she gets to have her anger, she gets to feel it and show it, and the show never chastises her for being angry.

I say this as someone who cannot stand Hayden, by the way. I disliked her whiny petulance at Ben when she's alive, but I understand her rage with him, with Vivien, with every man who uses her and leaves her. She has become a magnificent force to be reckoned with and she is breathtaking to watch in action. The only one I enjoy watching more is Constance, who is a magnificent bitch and my favorite of all time. Jessica Lange deserves every single award she's going to get.

Same thing with Vivien, who makes the house thunder with her fury; her fury at her useless, cheating husband, the house that has become a trap for her, her life at not being what she wanted it to be. As the show progresses, her anger inhabits her, much like it does for Hayden, and she gives into it whenever Ben pushes her. And the show makes it clear that she has the right to her anger, that she is not some hysterical, bitchy woman just screaming for the hell of it; it acknowledges that she has real reasons to be angry, that she has the right to express that anger, and there's nothing wrong with her for doing that.

Constance, Moira, Nora, Vivien, Hayden, Violet, even Hayden's sister. There is a pulse of female anger threaded throughout every story in that house, with the exception of Chad and Pat, who have their own anger and betrayal to deal with. Every story has a rightfully angry woman and it always starts because of a man who betrayed her. Ben and Vivien are only the latest incarnation of that. It's an interesting dynamic and I wonder if it's going to continue in the second season.

<li>oh, Violet. That's really all I have to say because goddamn, that kid is heartbreaking. The scene where she finds out she's dead just made me want to cry because she looked so devastated. She's the heart of that house, she really is. For all my complaints about her in the beginning, she ended up being so sad and wonderful and tragic. I keep hearing Tate say, ""You died crying,"" and I have to go away and do something else so I don't weep.</lj-cut>

God, that was long. 

So, I love this show. I don't know if that came across, but I really do. It's a lot smarter than I ever thought it would be, and it's doing such interesting things with all the horror clich&eacute;s that I'm delighted. Plus, CONSTANCE. Jesus, she is the best thing on TV for me right now.

I really hope that season two is as amazing and ballsy as season one. 

In conclusion, I saw the new Sherlock Holmes movie in the theater last week and <lj-cut text=""spoiler"">HOLMES ON A PONY. WITH THAT SONG PLAYING.</lj-cut> it was so good to me. I'm a fan.</lj-cut>

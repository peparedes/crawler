"event","ok. first too all who know me, this will sound very odd...but i dont care because its something i must say! I'v been asked by so many people i know, even my parents, ""you wouldnt take her back would you?"" my reply, no matter how badly anyone wants to kill me after saying this is ""Yes! I would!"" im sorry to all that think me foolish. i am in love with her still. i tried and couldnt rid my self before of my fealings for her and still cant...and chances are i wont either. my 1 wish is to one day wind up with her again. 
there...i said my piece. i feal better now. criticize all you damn want. beat me if you so please. it wont help, nor change my mind. later.

"event","my friends have been gettin in little fueds and wars. i dont care anymore. im not gonna get in the middle anymore.
 
shey- though you may never see this i write it here anyway. im sorry for always delivering my harsh words but it seems to be the onlly way for me to tell you anything without you arguing the point with me. i am your friend and the way you put what happened the other day was hurtfull to me. but its in the past and i take it you were angry as was i. i am sorry.

rissika- you are a nice person an all and tho we all tend to fool around a lot when were all together. that does not mean i like it when you hit on me. and you do. i am taken. i am with kat and i am happy. and because shes gone dose not mean to take advantage of the situation. if you couldnt tell it was bothering me the other day. next time i will restrain you or use force if nessessary. im sry. i consider you a friend but you do go too far. you got what you deserved the other night when mark twisted your wrists. YOU greabbed him then slapped him for stoping YOU! then YOU stomped outta here and slammed both doors...I HAVE NEIGHBORS! THAT WERE TRYING TO SLEEP AT MIDNIGHT AS YOU DID THIS!! i tell you now you will never come here if that ever happens again, got it!

luke- i think what youve done is folish and rash. but thats because i know from experiance. it will be harder then you think but as always i am here for ya bro. just have the job before you decide to move out here. its all i ask.

glen- you are a nice guy when you want to be and all thats happened seems to have affected you. but what has happened i cant say you dont deserve it my friend. you piss me off to no end as well. you have children. sopposedly one with kira on the way.  its time to stop the playing all the girls you meet and stick to one. i also think that you need to go somewhere and for one night stop your training and just sit there and be absorbed in the wilderness again. i can also see your worried about katie but she has her own life, she needs to make her own desicions and her own mistakes.  and i will be there with her to help when i can. i will protect her with my life.  time for you to let go.

Misticwolf- i thank you for everything youve done to keep everything somewhat calm and sane. you keep watch over me and help to calm me if angered. especially sence katie has left. you do your best and is worth me saying. thank you.

mark- same for you as i said to karwen. you help to keep me sane. you provide me with company and friendship and are there when we both need a laugh. ^_^

kera- you are troubbled by events and need some support. the others dont see you as i do and probibly wont. unless they are willing to accept you for who you are. your nice, kind , and like everyone are troubbled. i am your friend and am here for ya. i can only hope the others will notice that your a  good person as well. i actually think they have. but im unsure. ^_^ misticwolf1984 asks you to put her back on your friends list. she wants to talk to ya...and no shes not gonna start with ya. ^_^ 

there. iv said my piece and feal better. wow. being reserved just isnt me. ^_^"

"event","yesterday was a day. it went from great to bad to dowbright fun to idk and back to fun. i donteven know where to start.ok. glen and mark showed up and hung out for awhile. i showed them a flash toon called xiaoxiao. we all died laughin. then went to the school at 2 o'clock. i hung with manda who surprised me and stayed thete with us insted of going to art club. so squee. that made me happy. then it was off to the bank. i got there and the teller was a friend of my famlies for...years. she showed me the reason why i have a $240 debt on my debit card. i was less then pleased but at least i understood now. so i tryed to cash my check. hah! like i actually could. the bank wouldnt cash it b/c of the overballence. but she cashed it anyways. so now i gotta save everything i got and nextweeks as wekk so i can pay it back on time. this involves not eating btw. so im gonna starve again.o well. then it was off to the park for the <quote un quote> fight! on the way we passed a tux shop. cheeredf me up a bit. i know where it is now. im goin there today to price out my tux! ^_^ when we got to the park no one was there but some annoying little kids who DIDNT KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP!! i wanted to throw them off the playground we were waitin on. but they are kids. finally a few minnutes before time katie karen and chris show up. my first thought as i laid eyes on katie was this is going to be desasterous, i can almost see it. like 2 nukes hitting at high speed! rissa showed up and we all ran to say hi to her. katie and i began to chat a lil. i thing we all got bored of waitin. sudenly all ya see is bodies flyin everywhere as we are in am all out war. haha. it was fun. at first no one could take me down because i kept dodgin people and snowballs matrix style but eventually they got me. chris' tackle was griet. thats my longest skidmark yet.then glen tackels me by surprise, lifts me off the ground, and sends me skidding again. katie just downright picked on me the whole time...till she was hurt a lil i guess. i ended up leaving on my own. mostly causa stuff i had on the mind i had to sort out like that bank issue. but before i knew it everyone was over and havin a blast. glen got pissed anout somethin and left again. he came back later on. katie mostly and karen were pickin on me after...and before glen mark and rissa left. finally near the end of it all when it was starting to calm down a bit chris at tthe request of luke chuchs a cd at me. it sliced open my right aer a bit. i want in and started to take care of it then katie offers her help. there was amost a look of concern in her eyes. then it was me and akira. just like oll times. had i been pissed i wouldda beat the shit outta him there and then. but i was calm and mostly collected. at this point im back to my old self. the oll yamato everyone here knew and loved.
this mornin tho i got up wonderin what it was that mase katie so angry at me in the first place. i was thinking of going to her house giving her a hug and saying im sorry for what i did that made you soo angry in the first place. less do i even know what it was. right now is a hard time for me and i need the support of all my friends. i think ill go to flatrock for awhile and think like i used to. i mean the weathers nice enough. <sighs> my mind is going in a thousand different derections."

it starts off with me waitin outside the school for amanda like i always do. then i look to the left to see the doors burst open and amanda come flying at me!! i cought her of course. she almost knocked me backwards. (hmm wonder where i remember that from...) then i went up an got a pass to join her in artclub which was fun. i actually miss school b/c of that club ^_^ !!
left, went home for a coupple of hours, got up off my ass, and walked down to the buffet to meet amanda yet again. i got there like 10 minutes early...an she was 20 minutes late(what else is new).
we had a woderful time at dinner. told stories that made us both laugh. later on she said she heard a rumor that i cheat on and lie to all my gf's. im like wtf who said that. she wouldnt tell me. ""i dont care what youve done in your past. as long as you dont do it to me were good.
*huge smile on my face then*
no one hes ever said that to me. i am usually the one who ends up sayin it. an as we left the global she an i picked up tooothpics and sincronously put them in our mouths and started to walk off. im like you noticed that right?
haha. we then went over to the bookstore and she brings me to the mythology section. my eyes were buggin out. i love mythology and all that! an she brings me there. shes like my dream girl or somethin i swear.
then went down to the movie thearter... fun. i hop on the harly davidson game. there was a sight. i forgot how cheap the one in the thearter is. no second lean turn. asked her if she wanted to play anything...nope. we walked in and got a nice dark corner in the thearter. we saw white noise. I recomend this movie to anyone. its awesome. i couldnt help myself. it was a scary movie an i was crackin jokes left an right.
the funeral scene- i had to look away. too many bad memories there. tho i felt a warm an gentle breeze. i told her to hold up her hand(she was cuddled to my arm for most the movie...if not all[not in fear tho...in happyness])an i held mine just away from hers...the wind ws comin from her. it was so warm an fimiliar. i almost cried. i cant explain how...ro how i know this even...but thats the fealing iv been missing. an our energy is resonating when were together. i cant even describe. after the movie, waiting for her mom in the lobby area. i played with both my new lighters. i bought them an 26 boxes of dragons blood insence. ^_^ . ok, so i was beefin up the 2 lighters. and atempting to make a blowtoarch, it backfired(most literaly) and set my hand and arm on fire. haha. that was fun!!. im such a piro...i did it again a few minutes later. amanda was amazed that it didnt hurt me. ^_^ immunity to fire...i love it!! ^_^
haha...then i talked to her online all last night up to like 2am. sweetness. yesterday couldnt have gone any better. wait it did. she kissed me(multipal times too) ^_^ i do love her. no question in my mind now! never was really...but its deffinite. this time im gooin slow and treetin it as serously as i can(this relationship). who knows. mabie this time iv found someone wholl care the same for me as i do them!! no...i have. question is does she feal the same as i do?

hmm...lemmie see, where to start...

ok, lately iv been talking to this girl and i get more interested the more i talk to her. I went down to the school today after my shopping spree for food and spent some time with her. she just happens to wear my favriote stone around her neck...moonstone! we sat there till someone spotted morgan and dan. morgan ran towards me not knowing i was there and i jumped out and tried to grab her(she was running away from dan for someodd reason or another)
Dan wanted to race me on foot. we raced...and he kicked my ass royaly(happens alot lately). i need to start training in the sword and my speed again cause thats crazy.
then i left and started off with glen to dunken doughnuts and his bro's. he happened to say your falling in love..i cold see it as you were sitting there with her. im not gonna deny it either, cause i think i am too. warning warning. i know what your thinking now...but he was in love with morgan tho...well thats kinda true kinda not. see i liked morgan(still do) but lately iv been talkin to amanda and like, idk...things are just sorta clicking i guess. she and i share so much in common and shes cute and funnny and psychotic and an artist...just wow!
yeh...anyways, i got to marks. he wasnt there. he was out searchin for glen an me. beth had a coupple of her friends over too(alll female) I was attacked. tickeled from all sides. it totally was not fair!! later on i went with shey for pizza and had a blast...hope she did too. she always thinks he world dont like her or somethin. so i hope shes happier now.
i got home and there was a note from the cable guy saying he was here today. he was due tomorow...or so i was told! the appointment was for today and the girl i talked to said tuesday the 4th. no...twas today...dont matter. i got the damn thing fixed now soo sall good!

</lj-cut> i cut it so it dont take up the entire friends page.
im still a single guy. (damn it *snaps fingers*) i talked to morgan on friday after school about it an she dont wanna be in a relationship for now she said. *sigh* that usually meens nothing good. oh well. ill wait for now cause iv grown so madly close to her. but if somethin dont happen soon someone might jus come an take me away! oh well...ill come to that when it happens. i live my life one day at a time.
morgans party was fun. movies, music, dancing, strobelights, gay anime, ice wars...yep, it dont get much better then that!^_^
i got ice down my pants on both sides but it was very fun.
iv got something new im gonna try with my comic so wish me luck. i hope it works. iv also gotten exelent reviews on my music video crawling in the dark 1 by...youguessed it, hoobastank! i had hours of fun makin it.
ya know what i miss the most about having a g/f? its knowing you have somone who you can se and you know they care for you. something friends just cant do. your abble to kiss or be kissed whenever needed or when ya jus want to. same gos for holding them and being held in their arms. theres nothing more soothing a feling then seein someone ya love and then winding up in  their arms. *sigh* hopless romantic talkin.im probibly one of the only guys i know who dont look at females simply as sex objects or just b/c (quote unquote) ii know i can get some. i dont care bout any of that. bein with thems enough. if they wanna then thats a plus but i could care less. i say that should be reserved for someone you truely love and not just do b/c ya wanted to ease your tensions or it happened at the spurr of the moment.
... i could go on like this for hours but for the sake of everyones sanity and their friends pages i wont. not much else to tell other then iv become a mt dew addict.

"event","<center> today i wasnt planning on leaving the house yet again.
robin and morgan cal from the highschool. they wanted me to come down...more morgan then robin. i still cant get a strait answer why. so i got off my lazy ass and ran outta the house. i was there (and i clocked myself) in 45 seconds.
I havent run that fast senca i was younger and had control over my superspeed. even running to the schol should take like 2 minnutes at least the way i came. hell it takes 2 minutes in a car, yetr none the less it was only 45 seconds for me.
of course when i got there i threw myself aganst a pillar and cluched my heart, couldnt breath, and was surprised by my speed as i noticed it as i was running! then morgan comes and tackels me. yeh... hurtin then tackel. Can we say pain kids? ""pain"" Good, now run along and play. ^_^ outta charicter experiance.
got home. robin came over like 5ish.she was freakin waisted. she didnt get any better almost the whole night. she went home around 8:30ish.
I just got done makin an awesome music video. if ya wanna see it and are on kazaa, search for crawling in the dark 1 and download it from yamato13126. *my universal name*
im gonna try putting it on my website too. dont know if itll work but well see.
speeking of pain. my knee... i just tried to move it and it now feals like a sword has stabbed through it. ouch...
i was planninng on asking out morgan on her b-day when i see her, but idk any more. i havent really talked to her bout how she feals or anything so i will talk to her in person bout it on sat. and if she says cool then i will. idk why i feal like this. i havent tried this strongly for anyone sence makoto. its the same fealing too. im not giving up on my promice but im gonna try to live in the here and now. i hate being ruled by my past. time to get over it and start new. im here now. not there back then.
and morgan. idk how i can say this so soon but i love her. its not just the happyness i feal when im around her its...idk. theres something about her that just interests me and theres something inside me that keeps saying go go go. 
tonights also the first time i have bowed before my mother moon in a long time. funny it happened to be a crescent too. haha, what are the odds.
oh...im gonna see if i can get it up on my deviantart account too!(the music video)

today just sucked. i got up and no one was online so i decided to watch a movie. then i had to go to the store.
the guys that stayed over this weekend ate everything except some hotdogs and mac'n'cheese. as well as spent al my money on food for their greedy asses. i handed luke a $20 (expecting them to go to wendies) and expecting to get change back later at walmart. i didnt. no money. they spent it all at the A&W. i was hurtin b/c i treeted them to dinner the night b4 too. but i thought id be nice and let them eat. I will never do that again!! 
the whole thing pissed me off really. i mean i have no money to get anyone anything for christmas this year now. i have all i can do for the food!
which leads me to this!!
i went to the big M and got all the stuff i needed and shit, i only had $40 to get food with for the week. if you shop you know that wont get a whole hell of a lot either. so i got up to the regester and the girl rung it all up i reached into my wallet and did doubbletakes when i saw it was empty!
so i ran my ass back home and searched my pockets and found the $. then ran back to the store and bought the stuff(i had toremove a few things.). the walk home was fun and painfull. when i got in, as soon as i opened the door the phone rang. it was robin. i dropped the stuff and colapsed on my lil banister thingy seperatingmy hall from the stairs.
i watched anime for most the rest of the night while talking to Morgan. 
i also went out again looking for robin who was coming over...an she said that like hours before. she was at a friend house. got back on with morgan and began to work on my latest pic.
check out my deviant art account to see it. <http://yamato13126.deviantart.com> 
iv spent most of the night trying to show someone how much they matter and why they shouldnt always be saying shit to down themselves. that went over like a ton of rocks. so im gonna be here at home and starving all week...im me or gimmie a call.

I went to the global buffet cause i was like hungry. i sat there and ate for like 10 minutes. i had to be home by 2:30. i didnt get outta there till like 2:20. so i ran all the way home. i passed a cop and he looked at me like wtf did u just do?!! i just turned and smiled at him and laughed as i ran. hence my new answering machine message ""if ya need to get a hold of me just follow the sirens!!""
so im home now just waitin for my peeps to get here. I sorta confessed everything to morgan last night on aim. about how i feal about her and my promice and my past and all that shit. I wanna be with her in the worst way. I feel happy just being around her...i know i may have said that in the past but same applys. mabie shell be the first who wont break my heart into 1million little pieces. she like me is searching for something...i hope one day we can search for those things together!

this is a poem inspired by a conversation i had on aim earlier with goodie!

goodnight my love
til lights first break
thus do i wait to look apon you
and see your shimmering eyes 
as they look back apon me

the quiet of the morning
and the chirping of birds
the sight of the plants that encircle the room
a unicorn and a dragon
who sleep in a sweet embrace

first light has not yet shed 
its gallant glow apon the earth
and as i watch you as you sleep
baithed in moonlight holding me 
in your sweet embrace

a tear runs down my face
it is cought by a loving hand 
and in a soft voice you ask
whats wrong?
my reply can only be
I have finally found happyness

you curl up to me and i hold you close
for morning has not yet come
but i feal you close so i fall asleep again
waiting for the new day
and to face it with you...my love.

"event","<center>today was not just another ordenary day.
I woke up around 12:30 in the afternoon...got online, chatted with some of my peeps, jumpped in the shower...its after i got out i noticed that there was something around my shoulder blades. i ignored it for awhile, until the pain started to set in. dude...i didnt move for like hours. I finally got hungry enough to move to the kitchen. Robin comes and kidnaps me and brings me to Morgans...not like im complaining at all ^_- . we had a grand oll time over there, + I could actually move!...until Morgan hopped on the back trying to stop me from goin outside. She stopped me alright. She now realizes a little bit why I dont listen to rap. its not that I dont like it...its just the pain of the memories that surfice while its playing. ill overcome it eventually...for her. I updated my website a lil. www.freewebs.com/yamato13126/ check it out. ^_^ I have a section for everyone called Private Property ^_- . im really starting to get desprite for ideas for charicters and events for my comic as im on a sorta block right now. -_- .

I'm going to try and get into the highschol after school to hang with Morgan for a few. Still not sure if i can but i will try.if not ill just wait outside for her to come out. 
She trusts me now. thats a good thing! ^_^ . I dont know why  but i keep getting this fealing whenever im around her. its happy...warm like. Shes not the first iv let see my darkness i carry inside but this time i show someone i think i can trust. trust is very hard to get from me quickly...but i have that fealing. Idk. for now ill take it as it comes, one step at a time. i dont wanna rush anything.

<lj-cut text=""time and all that bullshit!"">
Ok...i know iv writen about this in the past but did anyone really get it? I really dont think so.

this universe is made of two things...time and space. both can be manipulated. example... a lil while ago I was teaching my friend Chris how to use a sword. He said when we were done that things seemed like they were going in slow motion. the mind has the ability to alter the reality of the universe into its own will as seen in this example. he was able to react at a speed that is blindingly fast and he saw it in slow motion and was able to make the nessessary adjustments to his technique before it struck. 

There is no such thing as time! time is an illusion created be the mind. free your mind and time has no bounds. it is limitless and infinite. i know it sounds like i pulled that from the matrix but really that movie has a point. free your mind. anything is possible. ""your focus determines your reality"". many people live in a world not seen by human eyes. one where people have no limits due to their focus or abilities.the consider themselves more then human. they are the ones that have already free'd their minds and so live in a world with out time.
</lj-cut>
ooooohhhhh....chips.*munch, munch* he he ^_- ! mid morning snack. its only like 1:15 now...no sence in waisting the night!im gonna listen to music an have fun till the sun comes up.

"event","<center>today was rather uneventful compared to the other day.
Lemmie see... Ok got it. Robin woke me up at like 10am or somethin like that. Needles to say i didnt get to sleep until like 5 in the am. Haha... 5 hours sleep + me dont mix as well as me getting woken up! It was all good though. I downed a bottle o Mt. Dew! Took a shower, Got dressed and ran up to robins to see her and Morgan. got there and we all took a trip up to where Robins mom works. Walked back to Robins to fetch Morgans stuff and I escorted her down to her grandparrents house. i sat there and got questioned by her rents(who seem to like me). From there they kidnapped me and brought me to their place. Its a beautiful house out in the country.
Morgan showed me the house. The indides freakin huge! proceding to her room I noticed a dragon and a unicorn sitting next to one another on her wall. She drew it. Then she showed me her layr. its great for hangin or if you just dont wanna be found for awhile. I think i kissed her like twice before Chris came. He arrived in the Triumph TR6. No sooner did he say want a ride then did I hop in and say Lets go! He mannaged to peal outta the driveway...*cough* hehe. i swear it was an awesome ride...I WANT ONE!!!
Got back and warmed up. i think Morgan and I have grown a lil closer. Something told me to kiss her yet again. I think I'v grown attached to her! Best part is shes just like me...sept 4 the rap. *bangs head offa wall*
Yeh...she tried to get me to dance to(if listening to wasnt bad enough) rap! The world is coing to an end i swear...me dance to rap!

Today...
Got up around 1 in the pm. Showered around 2 after doing nothing but video editing on the god oll comp. Watched The Last Samurai. Robin came over to hang w/me 4 awhile durring the movie. I was too lazy to get dressed so when she got there i was in my bathrobe an it was like half on half off. Im not shy am I? NO. Not really. Just dont care! Ha Ha. ^_^ Anyway...I eventually got dressed and went out to Friendlies for dinner(Cause I was too damn lazy to cook...yet again!) Got my Colosal All American Burger came home and did a pic. and talked to my peeps the rest of the night. Ha Ha! Its only like 1:30am...the night is still young!

"event","<center>tonight was sopposed to be the night of my birthday party. well due to certan events i decided to hold it next weekend insted. some friends came over to hang with me tonight tho. chris, ryan, robin and morgan. we all had a good time. first drink wars and flame tag. sound interesting. chris got ahold of one of my lighters and played. poored hot wax over our arms. it hurt but it feals awesome. later when ryan took the girls home i decided to tag along.ended up going for a ride listening to rammstein. i also kissed morgan. shes like the perfect match for me, only problem is shes 16. but i have never found that a problem in the past and deffinately not now. im willing to give it a shot. we sat around talking for like an hour or so. i had to piss but morgan wouldnt let me leave so i went around the barn. hehe, too bad ya didnt wanna hear it. after that i sat down and hung out for awhile more. finally ryan decides to go home so i went with him. morgan really didnt want me to go. i gave her another kiss and left with ryan. robbins mad at him cause shethinks hes gonna turn out like chris, a macicist...or however ya spell it. thats my night in a nutshell and i got most of it on video. hehehe! thanx chris! it was fun. im gonna ask out morgan after christmas or newyears. come summer ill have my licence so...heehe.

"event","destiny...fate...life...death...to someone like me these are words of great meening. my famous saying ""hold tight the light in the darkness"". yet does anyone know what i mean? darkness has begun to enshroud us all. i felt it tonighe as i was having dinner. i felt its overwhelming energy staggering through me. i know now why i am here. its not for love or to save people. its to wait. i was once nicknamed the manslayer of the shadows for a reason. lately i have grown soft. i began to care about such trivial things as love, trust, and friendship there are still a select few i trust and i consider my friends. my purpose is to die. thats the reason im here. to show you all the truth. ""the servers are the seven chaos, chaos is power enriched by the heart.""...sound fimiliar. if you knw me even a lil you know the phrase. or youve heard it on a videogame. but it still speaks the truth
prophecy-in a time of unparaleled darness as evil enshrouds the univeese the warriors will apear to fight for the universe and to restor ballence. the 7 servers of chaos shall grant fourth their power to their master, the controler..the one who can unify the chaos. sacrificing his life he shall reliece chaos' true potential and subdue the darkness, once again bringing ballence to the universe.

that text is as old as the lunatian race itself.mellenia before man was ever thought up. humans are the infants of the universe. you are bound to your limitations simply because you believe in such things. you think in 3D when in fact there are so many more if you just look clearly.recent events have made me less then happy as i got pulled down the middle. i am not any more. my trust was betrayed. my someone i considered to be a friend no less. he made a choice and in doing so like everything else it had and will have reprocutions. i wanted someone to come up to me and mess with me tonight as i walked around simply b/c i wouldnt hesitate to kill them. that side of me has made it painfully clear that i will die using my sword but it will be in the arms of my true love. that may or may not be makoto.its also clear o me that my one true wish will and can never be fofilled. i leave you with these words for now. hold tight the light in the darkness, which side are you on...friend or foe.

I'v been loving the late night,early morning fights with glen and mark ay their place. ya know, sence I took off my pentacal on halloween I feal like I have more control over my powers. like it was locking them away somehow.
anywho... chris came over for a bit tonight. I no longe have any fluid in either of my brand new lighters. Never ever let this man play with fire...not like I'm saying let me either but he turned a normal ciggarette lighter into a 2 1/2 foot blowtorch flame. and he blew it right across my lap. *cringing thought of a nasty burn there* he also succeded in almost burning my other eye. My left was burnt by luke playing with his lighter at the state fair this year. that summs up the events of so far, except for me waiting for 2 checks that are sopposed to come soon. they better come before the weekend or I'll be pissed!

Dont get me wrong, I have my positive outlook on life and well just lately...It feals as if theres something missing from me. I cant say what it is because I really dont know. Lately I have looked more into Alchemy for some reason. every night also, I seem to be looking more toward the stars hoping to see the moon, hoping to go home. Mabie thats it. Mabie I just wanna go home again. too bad that will be a while. oh well. once I'm finished here I can go home. there are not that many words that make sence to me but the ones spoken by TheLastToLive make the most sence to me. for that I thank her, Destiny.

It signals the begining of the end. the time of the awakening and only those of us who have been around sence before the creation of everything the first time can stop it! but lately I'v asked myself ""why should I?"" what am I trying to save? humans arnt even worth it! they are the ones who destroyed over a mellenia of piece and prosperity, destroted my kingdom, and killed people I loved. so why should I protect them from their own doing? Sure I may not be 1/millionth of what I used to be but I am getting there again. Soon I shall return home to the moon. then darkness shall overtake this world and the 7 chaos gods shall awaken from their slumber and wreak havoc upon this unsuspecting world. 7 Gods older the time and the univirse live now upon this planet. Watching, waiting, judging. preparing for their decision. they look like regular ordenary people but the each command ever increasing awesome powers that could destroy the universe if uncontrolled.

Its been like 2 months. lately I'v found myself wanting to talk to her for awhile now. I made her laugh her ass off...and vice versa.

Slipknot-MY PLAUGE

I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the
Everyday bullshit things that you have done

Your impossible ego fuck is like a
Megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
You fucking touch me I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that
Shit you call a heart
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I don't mind being odballed, ridiculed
Made to feel miniscule
If you consider the source, it's kinda pitiful
The only thing you really know about me is..
That's all you'll ever know

I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

I'm turning it around like a knife in the shell
I wanna understand why, but I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lot of reasons to stop it
I can't just drop it
I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it
At least I admit it

I know why you blame me

Kill you - Fuck you - I will never be you
I can't fucking take it anymore

It hurts to try to breath. then Glen kicks me just below the lungs knocking the air out of me. now look just 2 sentences back. It hurts to breath already. can anyone immagine how much that hurt!!!!! I could not breath for close to an hour! only little puffs. also I fucked up my knee in the fight before that too. then Katie and everyone wants to go trick r treeting. im thinking around the naborhood. nope. went down utica. it was when I fornd out she was looking for mark that I turned my ass around and went back to her place. I waited there for her until 10pm, cause I wanted to talk to her for a few. didnt surprise me when she never came back. her mom gave me a ride to my place on 5th st. this is my fucking bad day! get used to it. looks like I'll have a lot more. I am adopting my old name of Shadow Tsukiyami, the name of my dark side. my world has decended into darkness and right now I am blind to any light. be one found, someone show me the way to it as I am crouched in a corner cowering from my chaos, my life.

Today just has gone all wrong. I waited in the chineese place for my family, whom were not coming. glad i didnt start without them. I woulda had a lot of explaining to do.
After that I killed some time up at the college.
After that went to katies for her party. I promiced her a back massage but never got the time to do it. The only fun I had there at the party was the fighting agenst Glen. Sword, Staff, and 2 fist fights. I know now why hes a guardian. although I held back the whole time because I have this thing about hurting my friends. I'm always afraid I'll end up hurting one of them so I'm always held back. It was cool seeing Akira again. got to chat with him alot durring the party. the one person I wanted to see and spend some time with was almost never around though. it seemed like if I entered the same area as her, she would go to another area. I dont know when the next time I'll be able to see her again. could be this coming week, could be a month or more from now. who knows?! I sure as hell don't! And this whole Lycan thing has me furiously pissed!!!!!!!!!!!
apperently people think I'm a liar whan I say I'm  not a lycan and I hate them with the upmost passion! Apperently katie has a thought about that or something b/c shes been acting really strange around me and now tonight just plain out avoided me. The whole fucking reason I was there was b/c she wanted me there and I wanted to be around her! I dont know what to think or who to trust anymore. Chris is the only one who knows whats even remotely running through my head. I have to be home by 10am tomorow morning and have to pick up my bike at katies. I dont plan on waking her up. right now I dont wanna see anyone. I want to see her but right now im wwwwaaaayyyyy too pissed!!!!!
Damn it I wish today never happened. Just once in me fucking shit ass life I wish Something would go my way! Fuck it! Fuck the world! sorry to my friends! Darkness has taken over(again)!
Shadow has returned!

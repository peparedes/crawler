"event","OK, I'm working on a little something called ""What I want in a man.""

It's not finished yet, but it will be soon, so for those of you who care, look for it to be posted later tonite.  

As for now... there comes a time when you just want to run around and scream at the top of your lungs.  If I were gonna do that right now, I would probably say something random, like ""The Redcoats are coming!""  Deep down, it just signifies that you don't feel like you have any control of your life anymore, and you want to take it back by doing something random and audacious.  

This brings up an interesting point.  Control.  This is a huge issue in my life.  In fact, I'd argue it's a huge issue in all of our lives.  While some of us feel we have complete control of our lives, we are actually struggling (subconsciously) to grasp for it because we feel like we've lost it.  We think we can get it back by doing random things (waking up one morning and deciding to skip a year in high school, for example) or by rebelling against our parents (partying all the time, smoking, drinking... dare I list everything?)  The point is, control is a big thing.  Why do we crave it so much?  

Maybe I crave control of my life, and that is the reason I am unhappy in my relationship.  Maybe I am unhappy because I thought I had control of what I was getting into with my boyfriend, only to realize that he had equal control over me as I had over myself (and sometimes, even more control over me).  Naturally, rebellion and random actions followed the loss of control, and I'm stuck in a swirl of confusion over the whole relationship altogether.  

In a nutshell (God, I hate that phrase, but it works) it seems like I've lost control of myself, and I can't stand that.  To top it all off, my needs (AND the needs of my boyfriend) are not being met, for reasons that have yet to be explained.  What are the answers to our problems?  Who knows... 

All I know at the moment is that my ten-foot, concrete wall that was built as a result of a shattered heart 3.5 years ago is slowly being reinforced (by the very same person who urged me to construct it).  To top it off, there are sharp-shooting snipers at every possible angle.  I feel sorry for anyone who tries to get to my heart from this point forward."

"event","I think it's about time I updated this schin-dig.  Here's what's happened over the past few weeks...

I turned 21, which wasn't as bad as I thought it might be.  I still feel old, but then again, it's like a cool milestone or a trophy or something.  

My cousin/best friend and my boyfriend's brother are now dating, which is an end to what has been a year-long struggle!  Jon and I have been trying to get those two together for quite some time.  Finally, a sigh of relief!

Oh yeah, and on another note for my cousin, Tittina, who gave me an excellent birthday gift (you rock)... no more crazy, I wanna-be-rebellious ideas, OK?

And on another-another note for my boyfriend, thank God you didn't let us get into an argument on Valentine's day.  I think that gift was pretty good in itself.  By the way, the candle with the carved Chinese character in it (awesome job) was one of the most thoughtful I've ever gotten.   

Insert Monty Python quote here:
""And now for something completely different...""

Time for the gossip of the family.  Yaaaaaay!
So, we all know that my cousin Bessie has been hiding her pregnancy for a few months by not coming to family functions, and we can guess why... and we're pretty much offended by her lack of family respect.  But to make things better, they decided to announce Bessie's pregnancy at my 21st birthday party... (dot dot dot) yeah, we were all ecstatic and completely surprised (all sarcasm intended).  Thia Despina broke out the video camera, and I almost feel bad since there was literally NO reaction to her white t-shirt with a pink sign that says ""baby"" and an arrow pointing to her uterus.  LOL!  I almost died after that.  That's what happens when you try to be sneaky.  The best part is, my cousin Stephanie and I had busted into her house the day before to see how far along she was, so she probably felt like she had to ""come out of the baby closet.""  Oh well.  Shouldn't have tried to keep shit like that from us.  It's not like she hasn't been married for 3 years or anything.  Stupid jinx mati crap.

And here's the best part.  My Thia Despina feels like she has to get back at us for not having this wonderful, surprised reaction to Bessie being pregnant, so she goes and says something stupid.  Well, first, she asks us all how we knew.  We were all like ""Well, she used to be really skinny, so you could tell almost immediately, and plus her boobs are really big now.""  That's all my Thia needed to hear.  As I was going to start opening presents, she asks me, out of nowhere mind you, ""Moree, Tzina, eisai engaios?""  Translation... Gina, are you pregnant?!?  Just like that, out of nowhere, in front of my aunts, my mom, and my cousins!  I lost it.  What that told me (translation in my head) was one of two things:  a. you're a slut, or b. you're fat.  Very nice addition to my party.  Everyone was pissed at her, and she felt like shit.  Serves her right.  See what happens to women with big boobs in this world?!?  Titties, you're probably next, so be careful what you wear at the Titsis house next time you go over to one of their ""family"" functions... oh wait.  They probably won't invite you, seeing how they only consider their ""family"" people whose last name start with the word ""tit.""

The end."

"event","*Someone referred to what I'm going through as a ""quarter-life crisis.""  What he meant by this, I've yet to fully understand.  I suppose the changes my personality is going through constitutes most of it.  The rest is just perspective, how I see the world.  And honestly, I don't know any of it.  Pathetic how perfect strangers seem to know me better than I know myself.  Scratch that.  It's not pathetic... it's frightening.

*I'm not quite sure how to go about getting this ""stage"" over with.  I hate it.  It's a horrible feeling.  One of my amazing friends just talked to me on the phone last night, and although he didn't mean to shoot me down, he really set it straight.  He said that if I'm too busy concentrating on how unhappy I am, it only leaves me a lot of room to be ungrateful for the things I do have right now.  And in saying that, I appreciated even more the fact that I have a friend who'll be cut-throat like that with me without hurting my feelings.  Thanks, Mikie.

*The topic of discussion was my relationship with my boyfriend.  It tough for me, as it may be for others, to see things from someone else's eyes, objective eyes.  Can we really be objective when we're the ones involved?  I argue not.  So we need someone to set us straight from time to time.  Because we're selfish children, some of us more than others (notably myself).  But I just don't want to grow up.  I don't think I should have to just yet.  I'm damn 20 years old.  Leave me alone.

*Anyone care to share their comments, please do.  I won't get offended.  It'll only help me work this out."

I don't know..sometime I.want to move on but then we have amazin nights like last night..n I forget all about the bad. no one will ever truly.get the kind of connection we have. its like none other. we have our differences but I think it just takes time. to me relationships last bc u try harder when.it gets tough instead of running.away. I wish he wasn't such an angry person sometimes but I know that when I.feel like that, I'm more upset about my situation. and everything else that's going on. when I was talking to his cousin..she made it seem like its always like that n he will never change. she said he never brings girls around n that he's not a relationship kind of guy. which really made me feel like I'm wasting my time. I dont know what to think. he mentioned staying with me a few nights a week. which is fine for my boyfriend..but not someone I'm just dating. we celebrated our 7 month anniversary last night:) we went to all the places we went to on out first date. it was fun. I enjoyed myself. I just want us to get past the bullshit so bad. he mentioned I really pissed him off last time we saw each other. I just threw what he said in his face very ignorantly. I was wasted barely remember it though. what bothers me is that he talks to his cousin Jason about our issues..but he told me that Jason is bipolar n schizophrenic ..n this is who u turn to for advice..weird! Idk. its crazy how much shit he's talked on him but goes out with him every night. his other cousin called him an alcoholic ..that concerns me..but he was really nice to Z when we went over there last Tuesday..Idk. well see what happens when I move. </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p>"

I'm planning on moving out...in.a week. and I want to start this new chapter in my life. its the moment&nbsp; I'm doing something that I really want him to be a part of..that's when I know I truly miss him. I've never done anything. just him..this whole time. it sucks bc I have no one to talk to. my friends are tired of hearing it..n.I just feel stupid now. do I give up? will things ever change? will I ever be his?..my mind is flooded with ""what ifs"" I want it to stop. does he really lm? just one time..I want him to just admit hes wrong..but I feel he's impossible to talk to. he's hurt me one too many times...there's a lot of damage. I can't trust him with my heart. I'm scared. he's going to hurt me..sometimes I say that so when he is mean it keeps me from crying. I've shed so many tears..n there were many times that he'd just keep being mean..it hurts. I want someone who can appreciate who I am. I'm a single mom..holding down a full time job..getting my own place soon..and most importantly educated. I have my own..n I'm proud of me. I wish he would say that...but I bet he never will. I wish he could understand that happiness is created..and we have to work together on it. I can but I don't believe he will. if it means spending a lot of time alone..I&nbsp; will. </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","<p>the past 4 days have been absolutely crazy. Wed. night I went to see Rob..n ER got in to it..bad!!!! I don't even know where to begin. I met him up at Sports..I walked away from him within the first 10 minutes..we ended up going back to his place to smoke..his mom comes out all concerned bc his phone is dead..then we get into a huge fight bc he didn't believe he called me a whore ever..so I looked it up in my text n u could see it..but there was also a text from Kelly with the word in it and he wanted to read it. well there's a lot of shit in those messages ..I talked shit on him and his best friend and I didn't feel comfortable with him trading it without ne being able to explain..he automatically accused me of hiding other guys which wasn't the case at all. I.went fucking crazy on him..like I beat the Fuck outta him physically ..it was so much built in anger..n I totally took.it out on him but he was saying mean shit n talking down on me n.it just pissed me off. I knew then n there that it was over. I didn't expect him to forgive me at all! I was so embarrassed...we didn't see each other the next day..he called me names n talked shit the whole day..then Friday comes around n he wants to talk..I thought we were going to move forward n the next day..he's mean all over again. I call him at like 7 n he apoligizes..n tells me he wants to see me. so we end up going out.<p>&nbsp;</p>we get to Lumiere n go to this bar. I'm telling him about this job offer n he spots someone we work.with..I.dropped my wallet so I go under the table to get it..n.I'm so embarrassed ..really? we left that bar n went to meet his friend at the Four Seasons..this bar was so fancy! we went outside n they had a fire going and the view was so beautiful .looking over the arch n water..so pretty. we drank champagne n kissed in the firelight. so nice..we get back inside m he drops a bomb.<p>&nbsp;</p>he told me that he went on a date with someone else. nothing happened supposedly n he never talked to her again. what hurt the most is that thus whole time he's accused me of dating other people m he was the one doing it. Wtf? some bullshit. I was so blinded by the good parts..that I almost forgot to be mad at him.<p>&nbsp;</p>his sister picks us up n.we go by steak n shake n go.back.to his place. by far the best make up ever. it was amazing. I was so drunk but I.remember a lot. we decided to work thru this bc we really do love each other. now we need to figure out how to stay happy. he doesn't like being mean..he told me a million times that he is so lucky to be with me..n happy I'm still with him pretty much. <p>&nbsp;</p>miss him already! </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","<p>well things have been up n down since we got back from.Columbia.. the arguing is still there. what I'm noticing is that the jealousy increased but he apologizes a lot more quickly. I like it..bc its progress. its just weird ...the kind of stuff he comes up with when he's mad. Omg.I mean really. Idk what I can do or say for him to know that its just him. I really haven't been with anyone else besides him. the intimacy is so strong that I know ill never have what we have with anyone else. n I don't want to let it go. I don't desire to be with anyone else. Im still attracted to him. he said the same thing last night. when I'm with him I just can keep my hands off him. he just arouses me instantly ..its crazy how much I miss him right now even though I know ill see him tomorrow ..n I just left his house a few hours ago...like when I'm with him..n its good..I never want to leave..he is like no one I've ever been with before. he's not perfect..but when hes nice..he something like it. sometimes I feel like he.hates talking to me if he.doesn't care..or sometimes he says the meanest things..for example..i was stressing n really upset talking to him about Z n how expensive things.r and how I.don't sleep much..n I feel like I'm missing out on so.much ect...n he was like didnt u think about that when u were trying to have a kid. wtf? a complete stranger in Columbia smacked him for being a jerk..n.he really wasn't trying to be..its crazy its like hr doesn't know what he's doing while he's that mad..n then once he realizes it..he feels so bad..he use to stay mad..n this last time he just stopped..n texted me "" *sweetness*Im going to stop bc im sorry I am acting like this,i dont wanna fight like this ever. Ttyl"" yea. pretty big shock to me too. but it shows me that he's tryin ..and I know he really does care about me. he wants us to be happy..as much as I do. n the kind of changes we need to make in order for this to get better isn't going to happen over night or in a week or month. its really going to take time. Im talking complete change of character. don't get me wrong i love who he is..but its going to take a minute for him to be secure again. bitches really fucked his head up..ill stick by him for now..but this can't go on for years..I have faith that we will work out. I can't wait to call him my boyfriend n post pics of us together..n just really be his. I told him last night that he should just be with me n only me n his response was ""i am"" priceless! now when I say Ily he says Ily 2 ..:) he's so freakin cute. can't wait to see him again. <3 </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","<p>so Friday night was an absolute disaster. but NYE was absolutely amazing. About 3 weeks ago I asked Rob to go to Patrick Read's show with me. the weekend b4 the show I hung out with Rob and his friends. when we got back to his place we talked about the show n how he wanted to get a hotel n stuff. so I asked my sister to keep Z bc I wanted to spend as much time as I could with him. I bought the cutest nighty n everything. so Thursday he tells me that he volunteered to work sat. so I was totally Bummed out. I wanted to take him places n make it a special night. so we fought the whole day. he told&nbsp; me that Thursday night was like his Friday n he.asked me to do something with him n I wanted to but I.was so pissed about him having to work sat..n I really didn't want to go out 3 nights in a row. so we didn't go out Thursday but I went over there at like midnight to smoke with him..we decided not to talk about it. he was even being a jerk when we were doin it..I was so mad at him I faked it. n I never do that. so Friday comes around n he was having his sister bring him to Alton to hang out for a little bit cuz he wanted to be home by midnight. so he gets to Fast Eddies around 9 n I let my bro use my car around 6 n.he still wasn't back yet. my bro ended up getting arrested n my car so I called my sis to let me use her car . on top of everything my bro had ny debit card so I didn't have any money and Rob forgot it was a cash only.bar n needed cash..so I asked my mom to write her a check so I could get some cash. my sister shows up at 945pm so I didn't get to him til 10..n that's what time the show started. so I picked him up n he knows I'm.mad as Fuck ..tells me he's not mad..we get to the show n it was cool. seen some ppl from hs...but when we were at the table he brought up somethin n told me not to talk to him like that at work. I smiled n said ill do what I want. I always say that when someone tells me what to do..I was totally joking but he got pissed n wanted to leave ..so we leave n I planned on taking him home so it was like 11 n he wants to go to fast eddies again. n hes sayin that he was going to have his sister pick him up. I'm so angry at this point. my bro has my car..I had to listen to my.mom bitch..borrow my sisters car ..n I just wanted to have a nice evening with him. so we get to fast eddies n he's pissed. walks away from me. twice n ends up yelling at me in front of ppl n leaves with his sister. I was so upset. so we argue all night he's basically calling me a whore n accusing me of being out when I was home with my daughter. when I get home my bro gets back n hes pissed bc he got like 5 tickets n went to jail with his daughter in the car. Rob is bitchin at me the whole time. calls me 3 times n hung up on me all 3 times. I finally have enough..smoke n went to sleep. I was tired of arguing.I wake up to his psycho text messages..we fight all morning..n then I called him a psycho for the first time. he finally calmed down n talked to me really felt bad for how he acted ..so I told him I still wanted to spend NYE with him so we made plans to go out. <p>&nbsp;</p>this was seriously one of the best nights of my life. he makes reservations at Bristol (that I didn't know about) it was so nice. really nice inside..very classy to say the least. I felt a little out of place..n I didn't feel like I was dressed properly for that kind of restaurant but..it was great. I let him order me dinner n I had scallops(sp) for the first time..it was by far the best dinner I've ever had...great choice:) we left n went to the Piano bar to bring in the new year. he was so nice..such a gentleman. we kissed at midnight drank champagne ..n held each other close. it was so sweet . he can really be a good guy...when we got back to his place ..the night got even better. I love being alone with him. I put on the sexy nighty I got for him n for the first time ..he asked me to make love to him. it just melted my heart again just sayin it. amazing night. great way to bring in the new year. I hope there's more to come. he's been including me in things lately..like future plans. he agreed with me last night when I said that the only difference btw doing what we're doing and me being his gf is just a title. so what does that mean? I'm with him all the time. my every spare moment I'm either with him..texting him..or thinking about him. I feel like he definitely treats me like his girlfriend ..n he knows he does. I explain myself to him like he's my bf. its like btw me n him...we're together...but due to the fact we work together we just can't right now. what I really want to know is if we didn't work together would he be with me ever? the more I think about it..the more I convince myself that its not going to happen for me. I still feel like Zoey makes him feel uncomfortable ..which makes me feel uncomfortable. n when he said it was inappropriate for me to send him a pic of Z after 6 months of dating..that totally rubbed me the wrong way. I'm glad he doesn't say that he loves me yet bc he can't love me until he's been around the both of us...I've been writing forever. Z has been sleep in my arms the whole time. awe my precious angel:) </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p>"

I'm so glad things are better btw us. last night I went to see him at this bar in st Charles. he was with his friends n the.first thing he does when I pull up is open my door n kiss me. it was the.cutest thing. then we went into his friends truck to smokey n he grabbed me.hand..pulled me close to him n kissed me..his friend was trying to pass n we're all kissy face. it made me feel really good about where we are in this confusing relationship or whatever you.want to call it. then while we were in the bar..we talked n he stopped in the middle of the.bar..looked me in the eye n said Merry Christmas..I melted it was so cute. but my fav part of the.night.was when we got back to his place n I was lying there n he.wraps.hiself around me looked directly at me n said you're beautiful..n to slowly make love to him. awe man. it was a perfect night. he was so sweet. my sweetness ..I wish I was with him now:) he talked about going back to.school..n I definitely want him to. he's a really smart guy. he's thinking Kansas City.. and asked if I would consider moving there..yes I'd consider it. I mean its a lot to think about n he's not.even my.bf. I would never get to go out..n I don't know if he really loves me enough for all that. he told me when he was drunk that he loves me and that he'd be.lying if.he.said he.didn't. referred to himself as being a sucker for it. he also admitted to being insecure n feels bad for the.way.he treats me sometimes. he.sounded.like he.was trying to.end.things.bet when I.said somethin about that.being the.last ie relationship before. I told him yes n.he.said.he.had.too..n kissed me n told me he'd make.it work. I plan to move out n he.said that he.would adjust. Idk. I'm scared bc he.has his.times.where he's perfect n then other times where he's not. n I'm scared he'll take it out on Z..n I could never forgive myself. Idc if he's mean to me but please not my.baby. I need to know how.he's.going to be.around.her. will he want to hold her? will he play with.her..sing to her..ect. Idk. its time to move.forward with this. I mean were going to be at the 6 month mark in a couple weeks n.I want to know.whether or not we're going to be.official or continue what we're doing. I don't want to think too far ahead but I want to make a plan. and if we really decide to do this then it would be better if I just stayed with my.mom to.save money...until he's ready to go. at the same.time I need to.plan.my.life around.Z..decisions decisions. I want him to spend.time with.us..n see if I'm worth it. I might be more than.he.bargained for. he's never been around.me.n.Z. he's use to having all my attention n affection..Idk if he's ok.with.sharing it with her. that was one of my.biggest challenges when I dated someone with kids ..deep breath..I'm so confused.

I want him to cone over..n spend time with me. this morning..it came to me..maybe he trying to not spend so much time with me..or maybe he knows he's going to be broke n just can't afford it..or maybe hes dating someone else already. I don't want to think that. I'm really working on being mire secure but its when he acts like this is when I font know what to do. last night I sent him two message n he never responded. he knew he wasn't going to work today so I think he went out with.someone else. maybe if I keep telling myself that ill get over him more quickly.

I don't even know where to start.<p>&nbsp;</p>trevor n I met on st pactricks day 2006..I couldn't believe that someone like him would ever be interested in me. we talked for a while then once I graduated from college..we started offically dating. from there..things picked up rather quickly. this was my first real relationship. I made a lot of mistakes ..as did he..but it was a.great learning experience. I'd be be.losing if I said I don't still think about him..but he was a big part of my life. we ended things on a positive note n now he's in a relationship that he's.been in for the past 2 years..I'm happy for him definitely. I'm glad he has that kind of stability. I envy it. I find myself falling for guys that either abuse me or abandon me. I want that kind of connection we had. n I thought I.found it. a few times.<p>&nbsp;</p>after a 6 month depression..I started dating. while in grad school..I met Ben. he had just got out of a.serious relationship too. it only lasted a month bc.he.was just a.little too soft and I knew I'd hurt him. soon after that..I met Jay..I liked him but he was a. little too controling from the.start..so that ended after a couple weeks. a couple months later I met Damien..someone I wish I never met. he was the first guy I was intimate with.since trevor. I really thought we had something. he ended up stealing from me n robbing my.apt. so I let that go...I started hanging out withthis girl I worked with at express scripts ..she was in a motorcycle&nbsp; crew called the ruff ryders..I met Andre..I didn't want to talk to him initally bc he.was just too pretty..but after a few months of talking..I decided to.be.his.girl. we never went on a day. he came clean about his case n his daughter but I.found.it hard to.forgive.him. during this argument..I got pregnant..I told him about it..n he left. haven't seen or heard from him since Nov 2010.now he's in jail for the.next.3 years..so. that's that. in Jan. I met another guy named Ben..he was cool but I could tell he just wanted to sleep with me so I let that go quick. the last thing I wanted while I was.pregnant was sex. I felt disgusted bc it doesn't mean what it means to me..I'm not a promiscuous girl..n the person I give myself to.is.someone.I truly.see myself with. so after that I.quit dating. I started feeling really lonely.because I had a bad pregnancy n was stuck in the hospital for a few months. I created a plenty of fish.account which is a online dating site n I met this guy Michael.<p>&nbsp;</p>he couldn't be.more perfect..in the beginning. he told me everything I wanted to.hear. he.asked about Zoey..he tallied to me for hours when.I was.in the.hospital. just being a.good person. a few weeks in to it..I realized he was all talk. he.never really.wanted.to.see. me..so a month before I had Zoey...I let him go. I asked him not to hurt my.feelings n that's exactly.what he.did...so me being the relentless person I am..I got back on the.dating site n met Robert.<p>&nbsp;</p>I didn't find him attractive initally..but he was really nice to me. so after talking online for 3 weeks..I gave him my number n he called...July 10 2011..it was the sweetest voicemail in the world. I couldn't wait to meet him. so on July 30th we made plans to go out for the.first time. I was so excited but at the same time..curious. we discovered in the time we were just talking that we work together! how ironic. we went to the piano bar at Harrahs ..n it was so nice. I totally kissed him out of no where. he was so much cuter in person...I couldn't help&nbsp; it. it had been so long since I felt the touch n affection of a man so I kinda got ahead of myself. I did sleep with him but I knew within the first 30 minutes I wanted to pursue things ..one of the first things I asked him was weather he was looking to just sleep with me or build something..n he said the he didn't want to just have sex with me..n that made me happy.&nbsp; so we started seeing each other..next thing I knew 3 months passed an we were offically dating. that's when the madness began. the first time I upset him was bc I fell asleep with baby Zoey when we had plans..he was mad at me for 2 days. soon after that he got mad bc he said I flirt with.this old guy we work with...which is not the case at all. after that he.accuused me of messing around with other guys bc I never hid my pof account. so I did n then he got mad bc I got on the site to hide it. he ditched me one night after we made plans n I dropped. off Zoey n everyhing I was so pissed. it ended up being a mis understanding&nbsp; cuz he thought I said meet at his place at 1am instead of first. so..after that he was mad again bc I.showed the old guy&nbsp; I worked with the movie tickkets I bought for us..then he.gets mad ..on top of it I was suppose to go bowling with him a couple weeks ago n my car ran out of gas..n he didn't come get me. its 930pm n I'm on the side of the highway n north county st Louis..I forgave him in less than an hour. I feel like such an idiot for still talking to him bc he was just mad at me for like 5 days bc my I told him I deleted all our text messages n I didn't. I like the ones where he's nice bc when hrs mean..I can go back n be reminded of why I like him. he can br such a gentleman. n when were alone..I love him more. he can be so sweet..n listen to me n actually hold a conversation. we have the same 2 initials..majored in the same thing in.college..love for the history channel..n live in the moment. he can be absolutely perfect and in the sclerosis breath br the biggest asshole on the planet. this last argument really broke my heart. he said some of the meanest things to me n it hurt. I don't think I can trust him with my heart ever again. yes I have love for him. but I'm slowly realizing that I'm more in love with the idea of him. the idea of having a man to run to..n hold me..n do things with..n go out with..I love that. I want it so bad..I'm willing to be treated like a lying cheating whore. n I'm not. I'm someone's mother now. n I just want to be happy. my mind is telling me to leave but ny heart wants to stick it out. at least for the holidays. I'm so tired of being lonely. I want him to care about me like I care about him. I want him to be more understanding...but it seems that I'm just asking for too much..n its really not. why does he find pleasure in making me miserable ? that's how I feel. n now he just told me he's going to quit n tell his friend here that he slept with me. this sucks. y would hr do that to me? I don't get it. I gotta stop for now. more coming soon</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","I've had a nice break. Two more days of work left.  I just wish i didn't have to be there so early in the morning. It should be fun tho with Angela, Sara, Heather, and Kristi there. Im gunna miss the FB crew. Friday will be my last day as a FB associate. Oh man. I just thought about that. Last night was my last time being on the floor. WoW I've been working there for so long. Its going to be wierd coming home and not working there. Time to move on i guess. Speaking of moving on, Jake and I are moving quite smoothly. He's so cute. I can't believe i called for him today. I was so proud of myself. I hope i get to see him tomorrow. I want to get a new cell phone. But i'll probably have to wait til friday, when i get paid....unless my sugar daddy wants to buy it for me haha. I wish i had a sugar daddy. Not really, Jake is enough for me. Im satisfied. I wanted to stay with him so badly the other night. We did not want to leave each other. I hated being the one to leave first. But i knew that if i stayed any  longer, we would have sat in front of my house forever lol. He makes me tingle inside. Is that normal? Its a good tingle. And sometimes when he kisses me, i get warmed up inside. Like i actually feel it. I wonder what that is exactly. Obviously some feeling, but whats it called? And how long does it last? He told me that he was thinking about me today. I wanted to ask him what, but i didn't want to be the typical girl ya know. Thats something i'd rather hear in person, so i can see the look on his face.  That night we were sitting in fron of my house, every time i kissed him, he'd have this cute little smile. So i'd ask him why  he was smiling and he replied im just happy. I thought that was so cute.  He has this smile, this smile that elicits smiles. You just can't help it. Well i cant. My favorite was when he would grab my face and kiss me a million times. Im going to miss that so much when i go back to school. But we're going to keep in touch this time. Really. Or at least put some effort towards it. I don't plan on talking to him everyday. But at least 2 or 3 times a week. Well if i get that a month, i'd be happy. I don't think we really need to talk everyday. I don't talk to anyone everyday. I don't want to run out of things to talk about. Thinking about that, i dont think its possible. Im such a talker. I asked him to tell me a story and he did. That was soo cute too. lol I just cant stop thinking about him, like always. He is constantly on my mind. I bet he's thinking bout me  too. Wishing i was there!! hehe Ok i have to stop talking about him, i get carried away. 

So i talked to Randy. That was exciting. He's usually there for me. He feels bad when he doesn't talk to me as much as he thinks he should. I think thats cute! I think everything is freakin cute!! lol But we had to catch up. I told him everything. He was kinda disappointed when i told him that i was starting to like Jake again, but then he said that if it makes me happy then i should go  for it. He opened my eyes to something tho. Sometimes i think that he feels inferior to me, but don't mean to make him feel that way. And Randy just wanted to be sure that Jake understands how much i value education. Which i think i do. I talk about school a lot, but i haven't really said those exact words. But since i talk about it, i thought he would just know that. I should make it more clear tho. Randy is so awesome. I hope i get to see him over the summer. That would rock my world. 

Ok im done writing. Maybe i'll try that sleep thing. HOLLA"

Things have been going well for me. Today was my last day working on the floor. Forever. It was kind of sad. Im going to miss the FB crew. Especially security. They're awesome. I bought a really cute jean jacket. Its sooo hott. 

I finally turned my phone on!! haha its about time right?

I came home from work yesterday feeling like shit and in a bad mood. So i hit the bed and took a nap. Woke up, to see that Jake called. To be sure, i asked my mom if anyone called for me and she said ""some boy named Jake"" After that, i was offically GEEKED out. I called him back, and he came to pick me up. We did what we do and talked for a while. I was assured that he likes me just as much as i like him. We're going to work on the 'calling thing'. I feel a little more comfortable calling, well i haven't done it yet..i'll do it tomorrow. I was suppose to call today, but i chickened out. I really want to see him later. Man o Man.

i gotta continue this when i wake up...its pretty late"

"event","Lets talk about last night. So i got some school work done ofcourse, and then i watched the spongebob movie for the 11th time with my nephew Taylor. He knows all the words now LOL. He's so cute. While watching the movie, i fell asleep. I knew i had to be at work at 6pm tho. So my mom leaves to go to the grocery store around 3:45pm n takes Taylor with her. So i wake up from my nap at abot 4:30pm and get in the shower to start getting ready for work. So i got out the shower, and realized i hadn't called Jess all day. So i thought i'd call and see what she's up to before i go to work. I call there and Jake answers the phone. I was sooo happy. SO we talked for 20 minutes. I was just asking about him how he was doing and ..you know small talk. I asked him if he missed me and he said yes. As we were talking i could tell he wanted to see me as badly as i wanted to see him. So we made plans to see each other when i got off work. He wanted me to call his house and ask for him...uhh NO. I still think his parents hate me. And i've told him a million times that i just dont feel comfortable calling there for him. So, he went in to town and told me to call this cell when i got off, and we'd chill. So of course i call, and he's no where to be found. So i didn't see him. But it's ok. It only hurt my feeling a lot. Nothing new. I had Steph take me to my sisters house, and i started tellin my sis about Jake and she said, if you want to you can take my car. And thats somethin that NEVER happens. But i ended up just hangin out with Steph and Ben. It wasn't bad at all. I had a really nice talk with Steph. She could tell that i was hurt, but i tried to hide it as much as i could. She could tell cuz i'll talk about everything, and i wont stop. That my way of not thinkin of him, but of course it never works. So i stayed at my sister's house. It was nice. I really like her new house. She's doin the damn thang!Im O so very proud of her. We're having Thanksgiving dinner at her house.It should be nice. I kinda don't wanna go. But i really dont have a choice. Im still a lil pissed from last night. Im losing my strength. I only know of one other person that has ever had me like that. OoO wee wee. Lets not go there. But its time for me to shower and get ready for dinner. holla"

"event","Dear Ravi Faith,
Here is your single's love horoscope
for Tuesday, November 8:

If things aren't fitting into tidy little pigeonholes, well, maybe it's time to set those birds free. Watch them spread their pretty wings, and remember the corny adage: If they come back to you, they're truly yours. 

Is this a sign or what?!?! in my last entry,well not with LJ but with my other one, i wrote that i can no longer be the one putting in all the effort. And that i was just going to let go, and see what happens. If he wants to be with me, then let it be...but im not doing it anymore. He has to prove to me or show me he's worthy of my time. I feel he appreciates it when im there and he tells me, but he really doesn't show it. What makes is easier is that i think i like someone else. But i don't want to get in to that just yet. Its still the way beginning...hasn't even been a week yet. I'll just say that i enjoy his company and im very sure he enjoys mine also. Im tired of the bullshit. Im tired of complaining about it...its time to take action. And i think i started pretty well tho. Cuz i put my foot down when i was at home. I cried, because i didn't get out and hug him b4 i left, but i couldn't do that. I knew that simple little thing would make me like him twenty times more, so when it came time to do this...it woulda been a lot harder for me. When im with him, everything is ok. And im sooo happy. But its like i know he cares about me but he has a fucked up way of showing it. Whats wrong with a phone call...geez. Im not asking for your arm or leg...just a phone call...not for an hour or more just about 5 maybe 10 minutes of his time. I can't do it. It really hurts me. I thought it was because he doesnt realize how much it hurts me...but i told him this past time how much it hurts my feelings and how much it makes me feel like shit when he does that. And i thought it would change. and it didn't. Just one phone call. I've been gone for over four weeks...over a month, and he hasnt called once. If i felt comfortable calling him i would, but given circumstances...i can't do it. He knows and understands why i can't, but he refuses to call. Its a sign. Im gunna let him go, if he's truely mine, then he'll come back.  Ok im done with this journal thing

im out!"

Im in sooo much pain tho. I don't know if i can do it. Im hurting sooo bad and i really don't feel like doing much, so i had to leave EIU and have a little vacation with my real friends. It feels great. But i know i have to go back...back to reality! And it sucks. I just don't feel like doing anything. Just sleeping and more sleeping. I don't even feel like eating, and thats shocking. I had a follow up appt with the dentist a couple days ago and the muscles around my jaw are tense. So, im on muscle relaxers but all they do is make me sleepy. He told me to keep my eating and talking to a minimum. yeah its a bitch! all i do is sit and watch tv and watch my friends make fools of themselves. Which is quite intertaining. lol But i got to crack open one of these books and get to work before the pill wares off."

"event","WORDS WOMEN USE ... 

FINE 
This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up. 

FIVE MINUTES 
If she is getting dressed, this is half an hour. Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given 5 more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house. 

NOTHING 
This is the calm before the storm. This means ""something,"" and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with 'Nothing' usually end in ""Fine"". 

GO AHEAD 
This is a dare, not permission. Don't do it! 

LOUD SIGH 
This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A ""Loud Sigh"" means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over ""Nothing"". 

THAT'S OKAY 
This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. ""That's Okay"" means that she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake. 

THANKS 
A woman is thanking you. Do not question it or faint. Just say you're welcome. 

WHATEVER 
It's a woman's way of saying F*** YOU! 

Send this to the men you know to warn them about future arguments they can avoid if they remember the terminology! 

And send it to your women friends to give them a good laugh!"

"event","So i had a nice weekend at home. Til sunday when EVERYONE pissed me off. but o well...who cares about my feelings right? Nanie and i had a pretty good time. My mom acutally likes her. Out of all my friends my mom only likes 2, and Nanie is one of them. She really liked Ashli too, but i dont even hang out with her like that anymore. Im glad i saw her at Paisley's tho. That was nice, to see some people that i use to like. Some were pretty cool, and some were definitely lame. This one chick was talkin to her boy and said 'i don't think that girl likes me' as i walked by, and i was like i sure don't! ahaha Then i saw Katie Miller, wow, never thought i'd talk to her again. She's just the same...DRAMAFUL!!!! I'll have to remind myself why i don't like her. Don't get me wrong, i'm glad that i talked to her, but only so that when i see her somewhere, we're not lookin at each other crazy or sayin shit. Well i know i wont, but katie would. She reminds me of Chelsea soooo much now. she talk just like her, and its all about the drama...yet they both claim how much they hate drama. ahaha that get me weak. I was really happy to see pais, jessie, jenna, and dyl. That was cool. Being there for an entire weekend reminded me why i NEVER want to live there...EVER ever ever. It makes me work 20x harder in school so i never have to return. well i will do see the fam, but other than that...hell no. I also saw jake. That was nice. I love what he says to me, but his actions....they need a little help...well a lotta help. So instead of setting myself up for failure, i withdrew myself from the situation. As bad as i wanted to see him longer than i did, i didn't let myself. I always expect the worst, so that i don't get let down. When he lets me down, it hurts soo much more that it does when other people do. So i leared to accept that thats just the way it is. But i have to move on and stay strong. I still like him, and i still have feelings for him, but they're protected.I think i did a good job. yeah girl. Now im back at school....just doing a ton of work. I gotta a paper due tomorrow and 12 journal articl summaries due on thursday. Damn it blows big balls, but you know, this is what i want to do. At least its about psychology, so i'll actually read it and do a good job. Im better at doing thing under pressure. Then i have to put my Modern Dance Journal together, then study for a test. I'll get it done. I also need to unpack my shit and put it away. But i just don't wanna. I'll have to make myself do it! Well im done for now, i have class soon. holla ata girl...PEACE"

when you least expect them to !!!

Dear GOD, I thank You for this day.

I thank You for my being able to see and to hear this morning.

I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God and an understanding God.

You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing me.

Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or thought that
was not pleasing to you.

I ask now for Your forgiveness.

Please keep me safe from all danger and harm. Help me to start this day 
with a new
attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let me make the best of each and every 
day to clear
my mind so that I can hear from You. Please broaden my mind that I can 
accept all
things. Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over. 
And it's the
best response when I'm pushed beyond my limits. I know that when I can't 
pray, You
listen to my heart.

Continue to use me to do Your will. Continue to bless me that I may be a 
blessing
to others. Keep me strong that I may help the weak... Keep me uplifted 
that I may
have words of encouragement for others. I pray for those that are lost and can't find

"event","My mom has always told me to 'be carful'. And careful i shall be. Not only with the obvious, but also who you choose to be friends with. Im just now realizing that i made a bad choice. Her parents are 1846 racists. As bad as i want to believe that she's not like that, i know that deep down inside, she's just like her parents. To be honest, being mad at her made me realize the type of person she is and and i personally prefer not to be friends with somoene so selfish and childish. I just dont have time. Talking with my mother about the situation gave me a better understanding of where she's coming from. Even though im completely in the right, my mom says the christian thing to do is forgive. You cant live on and pretend to be whatever if you don't have forgiveness in your heart. And its just what i have to do. Not only  because she says so, but also because i know in my heart its the right thing to do (as stubborn as i am). My mom also says what you have to do for people who act out in the way that my friend did is pray for them. Pray that they'll see what they're doing and how bad they hurt the ones that love them the most. Pray that they'll get better and whatever is stoping then for being they person that they truely are. Man..i love her so much. She's such a wonderful,caring woman. I envy her!

"event","Things have been a lot better for me. I've been keeping in touch with my friends from home. I miss those sexy bitches! Im glad that Pais and I have established a phone relationship. I also talk to Jessie a lot...she finally got a house phone! Christophers birthday is coming up and im sad that i wont be there. Ya know its just ridiculous. I met a nice guy but it really didnt work out .....well i just wasnt feelin him. Picky me. Lets see what else has happened lately....mmm. O Someone i was really close to reminded me why i don't like girls. She was just being a bitch for like a week and i really tried to be nice and be a good friend and i even let her get snippy with me, and if you know me, you know that im not the type to let people talk to me crazy. But since she was my friend, i let it slide. I can only do it for so long tho. So she just pulled the last straw down in the cafeteria. I wanted to snap sooooo badly. but i didnt. And i thought that was really nice of me to do. Cuz i make people feel like shit when i snap... What makes me sooo mad about it is that i was soo nice to her all summer and all i've ever done was try to be a good friend to her. And i never ever ever take my anger out on her. But she has the tendency to take her anger out on everyone in sight.I know that if i had a penis, she wouldnt have talked to me like that. Its like she cares more about a guy that treats her like shit then she does about the people that care most about her. Like she lets the guy that treats her badly just waltz right in to her life a but she pushes all the good friends away. How backwards is that. I completely understand that no one is perfect, but ...no i cant make an excuse. Plus i really hate stupid people. Like i can deal with confusion, but to be just retarded....that shit kills me. I hate stupid people. And she just took a seat right in the middle of stupid. I wouldnt be as mean about it if i didn't tell her for 4 months how stupid she was being.  its like most of the time she bitchy, its about a stupid guy or something that she cant control. Its still not a reason to treat your friends like shit. But after that, its like i give up. Its like the situation with nicole. She chose to be with Tom rather than being friends with me.  She pushed me away just like jeanine is doing...well did. so i give up. when i give up,  i give up...seriously. There is no point of trying cuz im not a push over like some people. And i cant keep going if i have people pulling me down. As much as im upset that the guy that im infatuated with hasnt called me for a month, i don't take it out on my friends. Never. So i guess i'll be solo...well not really cuz i have steph, megan, megan, lauren, katie, laura, the EIU dancers, all my boys. I don't need anyone that makes me mad or that makes me feel like im not good enough. Cuz i like the person that i am, and i keep it real. I don't put 8 pounds of sugar on shit before i say things. And the friends i have will be the friends that i keep. Unless the fuck up like you know who. I mean its not like i'll never talk to her, it just wont be deep like it use to. And it'll probably be a while. She really wont know shit about me. But i can be civil. really. I wont be a bitch either. Sometimes i wait too long then i forget about the person. Which is usually my intention, but since i like her roommate, it probably wont reach that point. Well im done with this....holla at cha girl."

IT may have been an accident, but i just get pissed..yah . i use to like when people started doing things that i did. now its just annoying. I hate it. Its like ""just be yourself you fucking douche bag"" man. I hate people who claim that they are so mature but they're not at all. I hate people that claim to be your friend but don't show friendship at all. Part of being friends is being honest, and bitch you are not honest. YOu lie about everything, but i'm not even going to say a damn thing cuz your fucking time will come. Im a FIRM believer if Karma. The only time im mean is when someone is mean to me first. ooooo

I hate boring people. I hate people that can't hold a fucking conversation. What the fuck. I can't wait to get the fuck out of here. The people here are so ignorant. THe only people that get it is the the people that are away, and left the this hell hole. 

It sucks when the people that you're supposedly cool with don't fucking call, but the ones that treat you like shit want to hang out all the time. AJG, you amaze me. do you like me or not? stop being so wishy-washy with me. Just be straight up. Well you say that i make guys not want to have a girlfriend yet you call me everyday. You want to hang out with me and take me out but you're so mean to me. I don't get it. I'm so tired of you thinking that everything has to happen on your time. Part of having a friendship is compromise. i don't think you know what that is. it makes me mad because i can't call you stupid, because you're not. Its like you pretend to be someone that you're not.  Oh well

ANd for the idiot. WTF?!?!?! this friend thing jsut aint workin. I'd rather eat my arm. Just stay out of my life. I don't want nothing to do with you. YOu make me sick. I can't believe i wasted so much time with yo punk ass. mmmmm. I know if i see you im just going to beat the fuck outta you. I hope you fall on your face...kunt

"event","I've learned not to bring old friends around new friends. It just doesn't mix well. I honestly believe that i have matured for the better but when certain people from the past come around, the new friends begin to think that i am a completely different person. I have to admit, i was a different person. Im not the same. I went to visit an old friend, and i brought some new friends with me. I revealed a side of me that no one but associates from home know.The reason for this comment is that one of my new friends said something that hurt my feelings yesterday. I know she didn't mean it do it, but it's just something that she'll never understand. No one will ever understand the relationship this guy and i had...and im sorry that she had to see me act like that. Im not mad at her...i'm mad at myself. I know that i shouldn't have handled the situation like i did. That was the old me...the new me wouldn't have let it go that far. Now i know. I know nanni didn't mean it like that...but the way she said kinda hurt me. But i know the only reason why is because she doesn't really know. Im not going to hold it against her and i'm not even going to talk about it with her. Im just going to let it go.  I still love her....im just a little sensitive sometimes. 

The flippin' weekend blew. But i did meet a few FINE ASS cats.

I can't wait to go home. Im going shopping for a car,a lap top, down comforters, shoes, and a new fit! I think i'm going to have to go down town STL. Hopefully my sis will take me so we can spend some time to gether. I miss her. I dont get to talk to her as much as i ust to b/c her phones are disconnected. And she really doesn't have time to get online as much. 2 jobs, 2 kids, and school keeps her busy. But i think i'll treat her to lunch and/or dinner. That should make her day. NOt only do i get to see my wonderful family, i get to see my friend. YEEEEAAAHHH BOOOOOOOYYYYYYYY! Pretty excited. I also have a paper to write. So that will take  up some time...keep me busy. And away from all the buzzdowns in Atown. ya know.

Its not right. Its like being mad at yourself b/c we're the same person. We talk JUST ALIKE...its great. But i really can't wait for her to leave her douche bag bf. HE's so gay. and she can do so much better! But oh well. ITs not my life. After the settlement, we went to class, watched Passions together, went to the library, ate dinner, and worked out. We were extremely pissed at the fact that one of the RA's walked into our room b/c our FONKY neighbor said that nicole's phone was vibrating and it was annoying her. OH boo f*ckin hoo..cry me a flippin river. What a kunt.  Now i'm at the library studying while she does whatever it is she does when i'm here. I should be studying for a test that i have tomorrow....but i will..eventually. I really want to get a good grade in this class. But i think i'll do fine. Maybe. Say a little prayer for me! Im bonding more with Jeanine and Nannie. Which is good. I need to meet new people and make new friends. I talked to my mom and she made me feel a lot better. I love her. she's the best. Now that's MY BEST FRIEND! 

AJG really wants me to go to SIUC this weekend...and i reallly want to go. but i just don't have the money. He said that if i bought my train ticket there, he'd pay for my ticket back. I don't know. I don't think it's a good idea. He told me that he was still in love with me and that he hopes i come there... hmmm. I don't know. I think you're suppose to be happy when someone says they love you, but i didn't get happy. I was kinda disappointed. It's like i love him, but im not IN love with him. Plus i'm not really attracted to him. I just like talking to him. He gives me attention...and I LOVE attention. Then after that i was surprised Antonio called me. I haven't talked to him in a week. Last week i called him and we talked for like 15 minutes and he told me he'd call back in 10 minutes...yeah he didnt call til last night. It really hurt my feelings because we had a really deep conversation and i though it meant something to him. but it didn't obviously. So that same day that i talked to him, i sent him a text message calling him a bitch...but he didn't get it til last night. Nextels are weird phones...i hate them. I think they are sooo tacky! And hopefully it offened everyone that has one of those stupid phones because they SUCK...yeah i said it THEY FUCKING SUCK! what are you going to do?but back to what i was sayin...so he called and i talked to him, told him how bogus he was, but he still doesn't care. oh well. Im trying to get over him, and it's working. I'm doing a lot better. I just learned now that it's impossible to be friends with an ex. It just doesn't work for me. And i let the other people's opinion persuade me to make the wrong decision, and set myself up for falilure. I knew i shouldn't of answered the phone. That was a bad idea. I shouldn't of talked to him again. I should of just left things how they were. I was happy, not sad because he didn't have the opportunity to hurt me...but i let him back in my life and he hurt me. Im done now. I learned my lesson.  whew...

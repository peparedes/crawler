"event","I have ridden the bus for over a year now.  I have made friends in this time, and have gotten to know a few people.  But there is one guy.  Everyone knows of him, but no one knows him.  If you try to speak to him, he stares down his nose at you as if you were an insect.  He sits on the bus everyday, staring straight ahead, talking to no one.  The rest of us joke and laugh, he sits and stares.  For now I will call him ""Ed"".  

Not too long ago there was some trouble with the bus routes, and we were forced to take a different bus, that drops us off a little further from home.  One of the guys had a ride there, and offered to drop Ed off on his way back through the subdivision.  Ed acted insulted by the offer of help.  All that was offered was a short ride, a little help.  You would think this would be welcomed given the possibility of a two mile walk, but Ed seemed offended by the offer.

We do have good friendships on the bus.  If someone is out for a day, you can expect that everyone of the regulars will ask where they were.  It's like a little family almost, though I doubt any of the friendships will extend past the bus.  Well, maybe the one who is also my neighbor (he lives two doors over from me)."

<lj-cut text=""Geek vs. Nerd"">

<b>Geek:</b> A person who is fascinated, perhaps obsessively, by
technology and imagination. 

<ul><li>A person who is interested in technology, especially computing and new media.  Newest definition, Late 20th and early 21st century. </li>
<li>A person with a devotion to something in a way that places him or her outside the mainstream.  Late 20th and early 21st century. </li>
<li>A derogatory term for one with low social skills, often with average intelligence.  It is theorized that many of these people have Asperger's syndrome (a pervasive developmental disorder often referred to as ""High Functioning"" Autism).  Late 20th century. </li>
<li>An acronym from the U.S. military.  Stands for General Electrical Engineering Knowledge.  Unclear whether this was the origin of the newer meanings of geek, or if the acronym was developed because those meanings were already established. </li>
<li>A person who swallows live animals, bugs, etc., as a form of entertainment at fairs.  Probably originated from the Scottish term 'geck', meaning 'fool'.  19th Century. </li>
<li>The most popular Urban Dictionary definition is acute in mirroring the general social acceptance for Geeks: Geek, n.  Someone who you beat up in High School and end up working for later in life. </li>
<li>Now frequently used in technical fields as an honorific used to describe someone of exceptional knowledge or skill. </li></ul>

<b>Nerd:</b> Traditionally applies to a very intelligent but lonely and socially awkward person, one fascinated by knowledge, especially science and mathematics, and less interested in physical and social activities. 
<ul>
<li>In the 1990s, nerds on the internet reclaimed the word as a badge of pride, and began using it as a positive description of any technically competent person. </li>
<li>Adopted in the mid-1960s to describe a stereotypical intelligent recluse with poor social skills, often the butt of others' jokes. </li>
<li>First appeared in Dr. Seuss' book If I Ran the Zoo, published in 1950, used to describe one of the many comical imaginary animals. </li>
<li>Another theory of the word's origin sees it as a version of Mortimer Snerd, the name of a slow-witted character created by ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his radio show. </li>
<li>Yet another theory traces the term to Northern Electric Research and Development, where the employees wore pocket-protectors with the acronym N.E.R.D. on them. </li>
<li>And yet another theory claims that the word came from the word ""drunk"" reversed to ""knurd"", to describe someone who did not drink at parties. </li>
</ul>

<b>Relationship between Geek and Nerd: </b>

<ul><li>Often disputed by pundits and observers. </li>
<li>Some view Geek as a less technically-skilled Nerd. </li>
<li>Some maintain that Nerds are technically-skilled and socially-competent, while geeks are technically-skilled and socially-incompetent.  Others hold the exact opposite view. </li>
<li>Some regional differences in connotation may exist. </li>
<li>In the US, West Coast has been noted as considering 'geek' less offensive than 'nerd'.  East Coast tends to view 'nerd' as being less offensive, although many dispute this. </li>
<li>In Britain, 'geek' is an affectionate term, 'nerd' is an offensive term. </li>
<li>Nerd originated in the 1950s as a derogatory term.  Geek became widespread during the 1980s and has avoided many of the harsher negative connotations. </li>
<li>'Geek' as a milder form of 'Nerd' may apply to people who are socially insignificant, while 'Nerd' is applied to people who are socially inept. </li></ul>

A quick clearification on my post yesterday...

I am not saying my friend owes me anything.  I was merely saying that the same way I have treated a friend (going out of my way to help out) is the way I would expect a true friend to respond.  A good example is the group of ""friends"" I had in high school.  When we all left for college, I went out of my way to try and keep in touch.  Email, phone calls, whatever.  But that effort was one sided, emails rarely returned (phone calls even less).  

I guess I fell for the ""Hollywood"" version of what  a true friend is.  The type of friends you see in movies and on TV.  The friend you can call at 3:00AM, and not have them get upset.  The type of friend I guess I will never know..."

"event","So I have been slowing slipping back into depression lately, but I had so far been sucessfully fighting back.  This morning was a huge set back in that arena.  Standing the in the rain for 20 minutes waiting for a bus and realizing that no one, not even those I consider my closest of friends, has my back was a large disappointment to say the least.  I am now at work, slightly damp, and cold.  I have resigned myself to the final and inevitable collapse of the tiny shred of a support structure I once thought I had.  

Maybe it is my misinformed idea of friendship that is the problem.  When a person that I consider one of my best friends started having difficulty due to not having permanent employment, I did what I could to help.  At the time the situation benefitted us both because I am not able to drive right now.  I paid for gas in exchange for rides to work and home (I paid for *much* more gas then was used to transport me).  I also went out of my way to make sure there were groceries in the house, often making trips weekly, so that he could eat (he had become a roommate with us, for some time with out rent being asked).  He is now a full house mate with us, and his rent situation is a dealing with the house owner (we moved into a house in Sept/Oct last year).  After all this, I suddenly find myself in a situation where he often won't answer me.  When I *truly* needed a ride to work this morning due to the driving rain, I knocked on his door to see if it was possible.  No answer.  Not even after knocking six times.  And so I put on a raincoat, and stepped out into the deluge.  I stood in the driving rain for 20 minutes waiting for the bus.  I got to work wet, and cold.  I know that inevitably he will say he did not hear me knocking and I will accept this as reasonable.  But that doesn't explain other things, like leaving the room 5 minutes after I sit down to watch whatever show he is watching.  I don't know what his deal is, and given the myriad of excuses I have heard to this point, I probably never will.  

And so I struggle against the depression alone, no friends to help me.  And for me, this only makes it worse."

1.  Spend 6 hours on a BMX bike, riding 42 miles on a 1/4 track to raise money for charity.

2.  Spending more then 24 hours straight on a bus to go see the Pope when he came to Denver in 1993.

3.  Stayed awake for 56 straight hours, ending with a Thanksgiving day dinner.

4.  Slept 24 straight hours because of #3.

5.  Ridden as a passenger in a big rig as a way to get home for a holiday break from college (while not being involved with the trucking company in any way).

6.  Worked as a private contractor at the age of 16, making $1200 in a week to unload trucks.

7.  Taken a flight to Hawaii twice, spending a week each time, for nothing more then the cost of snacks (without working for an airline).

8.  Arrived at an airport 3 hours after my luggage.

9.  Slipped on ice in such a way as to have the flag part of a zipper go through my bottom lip, resulting in stiches and a scar.

10.  Been a part of a Beta test for wireless broadband that resulted in over a years free internet service, ultimately to have the entire service cancelled out from under me (only 3 more months of free service).

I am now to be known in SCA circles as Lord Anders Knudsen.  I also got word that my Coat of Arms is near approval at corporate, and I should hear back about it soon.

Try and think of a Song ( Artist + Title ) that reminds you of me. Post that song as a comment and I'll see if I know it, and if not, I'll try and look it up. Post this in your journal so other people can do the same for you."

"event","Just been a bit busy since Pennsic.  Moving this weekend to the house, even though all the paperwork isn't settled yet.  Sounds like its gonna be fun.  

Got a baronial meeting on Sunday, and for the first time I am doing deputy duty for the chronicler.  I get to take notes at the meeting, that will then be put in the next baronial news letter.  At least I can give back in some way.

I haven't been too involved with SCA other than Pennsic.  I am going to a local event at the end of the month.  It should be fun.

That's about all the update I can handle for now, but I am working on getting back to regular posts, maybe after we settle in the house it will be easier."

"event","The field was freshly cut, and the sun was shining down. I could smell the hay bales as they baked in the sun. I could see the enemy across the field and they looked more nervous the we did. Most people facing Atlantia look nervous.

Our King stood two rows ahead of me, the local Baron two columns to my right. I knew we would take the lead on the offensive, so I prepared myself. This would be a battle sung about for years to come.

The cannon sounded the beginning of the battle, and we marched forward to meet destiny. Around midfield, the unit to our right engaged, and our King called for us to flank that enemy unit. We plowed into the side of the unit, only to be flanked on our left by another enemy unit. The fighting was fierce and valiant. With the enemy pressing on my left, I turned and joined our Baron in his battles, but the numbers were against us. Another unit had engaged us, and we were being attacked on three sides. I fell along side my Baron, fighting to the last. As I fell, I saw that the army of the east (our ally) was making quick work of the remnants of the units that had engaged us. The battle was won for ourside, but the armies of Atlantia paid the price for that victory. A few minutes later, the cannons signalled the end of the battle. No one from Atlantia had survived.

That was the only battle where the whole of Atlantia fell to the enemy. In every other battle during War week, Atlantia was a major force. To be honest, we were in this battle also, due to the fact that we took a lot of the enemy with us when we died."

I am still deciding what articles I want to write about my first Pennsic, and hope to publish them soon. I also have been busy unpacking and cleaning up from my trip, so not much time to do anything.

I really do need this week away from it all.

The sky fell upon a barren desert
And the moon blocked out the sun.
Amid the commotion I saw her,
A perfect ten.
I asked for nothing
But to be allowed
To gaze upon her beauty.
Even this she denied me.
Can I live without her?
This only time can tell.
But for now I will wear a mask
A mask to hide my tears from her.
She was my first love,
And one that was never returned."

I don't know if there are going to be enough hours to do this.  I really don't.  I need to sew two tunics (at least, probably more).  I need to do some armour repair projects (and armour clean up).  I need to set up and air the tent.  I need to... do *everything*.  And only a week to go until my first Pennsic.  

I'm gonna hate it this week, but love it the next."

"event","A glance

The anger was born 
And did convey itself in violence
Sadness died,
And is buried beneath the tree 
In the back yard.
Happiness shone its bright smile 
Across the sky
As a rainbow
All the while my heart did beat.
Until I gazed upon the one 
Of beauty untold.
My heart stopped
For a brief moment
And I knew joy."

We are less than two weeks away from when I would need to depart for Pennsic, and I don't know if I will be able to go. I would love to make it there, but there are certain things that may not allow it to happen. Specificly, lack of funds and lack of garb. It was a good dream while it lasted. The problem is, I know that if I told certain persons in the local group my problems, they would make it happen. *Sigh* What do to?

Oh, well..."

It's been both busy and boring the last week or two.  I have spent both weekends out with my roommate looking at houses.  He's decided that paying rent is getting no-where, so he's investing.  He made an offer this week, and accepted the counter offer made by the seller.  If everything goes ok with the inspections, he should close by the end of August, and we should be moving in September.  More updates as the process goes along.  As I told him, I am being cautiously optimistic.  I'll celebrate when the inspections are done.

I just started another brew going.  Gonna have to get that one to bottles before we move (it's pushing the time line, but I think it will be ok).  This one is a Cyser.  It's a mead, but instead of using honey and water, it's based on honey and apple juice.  I think it will turn out well.  It has a potential to be almost 30 proof.

Other than that, not much going on.  I will update as I have more info."

I am ponder sending the book out to see if it would get published, but it is hard to let go of something like this (something so personal) without truthful feedback.  Let me know what you think.

To my broken heart:

I wore my heart upon my sleeve
She struck it without mercy.
I fell down to writhe in pain
She smiled in her glory.

She knows not how she wounds my heart
A secret kept forever
Knowledge of my souls torment
To reach her ears, never.

And so I lament my loss
The love I dare not show
And the pain I feel inside
I hope she shall never know.

Do I dare to speak these words,
Or forever hold my tongue?
A torturous secret to try to keep
From when this had first begun.

I know now that my words did wound
A solitary heart.
I wish I had held my tongue
And not made us to part.

Friendship we did have back then
Closer to be, never.
Dare I reveal my pain?
Dare I speak it ever?

I know the truth inside my soul.
There it should have stayed.
Anything to avoid hurting her
And have my pain delayed."

You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.

Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.

You are not to be messed with. You may explode.

"event","Ok, so I picked this up from <lj user=""tesselene""> and thought it would be fun.  So, here goes:

<i>Who are you? Why am I on your friends' list? Why do you watch my journal?

Come on, tell the class. Even if you think it's a big ""duh"", and I should know... pretend I forgot. Or pretend everyone else is dying to know...</i>

Let's have fun...."

"event","Some people are intolerant.  They can't handle it when someone doesn't agree with them.  I wish at this point that I was only being vague, but this is a problem that has arisen in the office.  Apparently, I am not allowed to even mention politics or religion at work.  I don't really mention religion anyway, so that's not too big an issue.

What I do find funny, is that the only program that they have on the TV's in the break room is CNN.  So, if you eat lunch at work, and don't go over to the cafeteria, you get 60 mins of political debate and information.  I guess coming back and reporting the news to people is just too political for persons in this office.  I try to report objectively, and just say what happened today, but as with anyone, it sometimes ends up tainted by my views.  

I am not trying to push my politcal agenda on anyone.  I am merely sharing my views.  Some people just can't handle it when you disagree with their views.  Now this has become an issue we have to take up at a team meeting.  Someone has told the manager that this is an issue within the department, and we must now dedicate time to telling people to censor themselves.  

For the sake of office harmony, I will agree to censor myself (even though I have said nothing objectionable).  My requirement in this is to censor the middle school type behaviour and language being used around me.  I have listened to my co-workers use the term ""Dusty"" to describe a negative connatation on things for over six months.  ""That's just Dusty"" makes no sense, and I should not have to listen to it 20 times a day.  Some people just need something to complain about I guess."

"event","Today, I have decided to do a technology review to get things started.  There are several things that have come to light in the last few days, and while I am only commenting on a couple of them, I suggest that everyone periodicly check <a href=""http://slashdot.org"">Slashdot</a> for updates.  

Graphics card manufacturer nVidia has now taken a step that I have longed to see.  The 6800 series nVidia cards will feature Scan Line Interleaving technology (SLI) and GPU load balancing. For those unfamiliar with this concept the <a href=""http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20040628/index.html"">article</a> over at Tom's Hardware does a good job of explaining how the technology works.  

Sprint PCS has also announced the use of <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/biztech/06/22/telecoms.sprint.reut/index.html"">EV-DO technology</a> for broadband enabled phones.  I can understand selling wireless broadband for laptops, but why would I need DSL speeds to surf the web on my cellular phone?  I barely use the wireless web on it now, and I don't think that speeding up the web access would really bring anything new to the game.

One last item of note from yesterdays news:  <a href=""http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/28/1255228&mode=thread&tid=126&tid=137&tid=162&tid=99"">Herman Goldstein</a>, father of the ENIAC and EDVAC computer systems (the first computers) died at the age of 90.  I wonder what Mr. Goldstein thought of everything that has come from his work.  We have really come a long way since he started us out.

That is all for todays technology review."

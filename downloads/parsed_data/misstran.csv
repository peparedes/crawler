"event","Intriguing opening statement.  

Funny remark.  Strained embellishment.  Desperate hyperbole.  Penetrating wisdom. Cryptically loaded innuendo.  Irrelevantly descriptive detail. Colorful celebrity allusion. Reflectively prying observation. Simmering rage cloaked with calculated propriety.  Self-deprecating mock modesty. Reluctant dismissal of obsessive self-absorption.

Poignantly in-conclusive conclusion.

Virtual wink."

"event","When do training wheels come off?  Were they ever on in the first place?

When you suddenly lose a parent you feel as though you're walking on a tight rope and there's only part of the safety net underneath that's still there.  I've become independent from my parents for a long time but emotionally, knowing my creators are still alive who are always wondering how I'm doing, and then losing one so suddenly, is like having a kneecap shot from under you while you were taking an aimless stroll through a vast field. The shock, the fear, the confusion, the grief, the phantom feeling in that limb, the regret, the love, the longing, the blind hope.  What will happen to him in the afterlife?  Is there one?  Is he a wandering life force or converted energy in the bellies of little earthen beasts?

I lost a training wheel and at times, I glow, walk with confidence, forced to stand stronger to compensate for the loss. Other times, small waves will take me out with the current and swallow me until I've swallowed enough and wade back to shore to continue my trek onward.

I know in some ways, we were lucky.  Things always could be worse no matter how much pity would like to consume us. And if good comes out of this...a reevaluation of life, of love, of family, of purpose, discovering the person behind my father, discovering the country that he loved more than his substitute home called America...then he will be smiling and more at peace.  And that makes me smile and more at peace when I need it.

Life goes on.  I'm just trying to catch up."

Probably because you dont really need to see as well in a freezer (my freezer space in particular is quite small) as you do in the refrigeration section of the unit, which has shelves, and doors, etc inside of it making it trickier to navigate with no light...
Think about it, has your bulb ever gone out in the fridge? Its quite lame. You could be grabbing for the chocolate syrup one second, and drinking maple syrup milk the next (why does that sound good? i am a pig, that's why).
Considering all these people who have freezers with lights in them, it sounds like maybe I need to step my game up and get a nicer unit."

"event","I think livejournal may be desperate. They constantly make new options and features available even for the free accounts (like mine) that look more and more like myspace, facebook, etc.

Either way I think it's because no one ever checks their lj anymore. 

Which is fine. I am sure the fine folks at livejournal dont need to eat anyways.

""the only sensible way to live, is without rules"". 

I am going to eat that sentence for breakfast EVERY morning. Will I become The Joker? no... not my style.
 
All I know, is that it made me think. 

I have to stop feeling so ""bad"" and ""guilty"" for everything that I do, because frankly, I have no idea who I want to be or WHAT the fuck I have been holding myself up to for so many years... I just want to be me... just me. 

It's like fucking sinner's guilt or something. I have it, I acknowledge it, and I dont even really internalize it in my heart. Instead, I just fucking carry it around all the time... like I was born with it or something. Which I dont believe... so I am not going to do that anymore.

The only way to do that is to make choices that make me happy now, and choices that could benefit a prosperous future for myself, my soul, and my loved ones. 

So I will monitor myself (for as long as I can remember to do it). Which, now that I am writing it out, seems like an oxymoron, but its not, really... I am not going to have any ultimate goal of what fucking ""person"" I want to be anymore. It's not like I ever did, but I sure THOUGHT I did.

Lets see what happens."

"event","i wont sit here and say that life is a curse. because it isnt. but i will say that being an american sort of is.

i have had the opportunity to listen to bad religion's latest album pretty much all year, and i found a nugget of a song the other day that REALLY made me think.

basically, no matter what role you play on earth- even if you were to, lets say, be IN bad religion and playing punk music and drinking for a living... you are still making your attempt to get your slice of this enormous pie that everyone (including I) consider to be rather delicious. its all about HOW you want to do it... HOW you want to live... THATS what dreams are. dreams are about what you want to do to make yourself happy, but what is the dream? what is happy? a family? money? all these things? fans who love you? philosophically- its pretty much bullshit no matter how you slice it!

its not my dream of chasing a music career that i am attacking here. that would be silly... i love doing what i do and WHO i do it with, i couldnt ask for a better situation ALTOGETHER. in fact, that statement includes everything in my life that doesnt pertain to music as well.

its the idea that i have to CHASE my dreams because it was instilled into me from a young age BY MY ENVIRONMENT that i have to search for happiness by making WHO I AM all about WHAT I DO...

so heres the result. 

A) most importantly... if you play in a band that can make another human being analyze his/her own life in this fashion because of the words that you sing, congratulations. you have acheived what music has been trying to do for years now, and you are an awesome band... good job bad religion. i love you still after all these years.
B) i HAVE to do my best to be a happy person despite my shortcomings in this life.  i say that so that i may define my DREAM as a personal goal for closure and (of course) happiness as merely person who expresses himself through a medium. NOT a fucking gunslinger.. THERE is no label for what i do anymore. i am who i am. if i give myself a label, thats a shackle. 
C)i MUST thirst for the EXPERIENCE of life and what this great country could potentially offer me in the future, based on what i can TAKE from it rather than what it can GIVE to me; FUTHERMORE...  what it can TAKE from me and i can GIVE to IT... YES!

some of you may do this already, and thats ok, maybe i missed the bus a while ago. shit happens.

anyhow, this is the song that sparked these thoughts.

""Submission Complete""

""Dedication is the price you pay: the initiated are
Coddled and caged
Before you walk, as soon as you crawl
Hope is pointless 'cuz you're stuck in the trawl

Fuck the freshman lectures and brandishments
They just betray impoverished accomplishments
The puppet masters fear originality
They tighten up the tethers and they shackle your feet
Submission complete!

Young recruits never have a chance, enticed to 
The drill, admonished to dance
Early to rise and early to shine, life is long but the end is nigh

Break the guilty trammels from yesteryear
Remember how rejuvenation conquers all fears
Lowly opportunists take commanding roles
And hawk ultimatums so their weakness won't show

The sad reflection of dead ambition
You live for nothing 
Submission complete!

Yeah, break the guilty trammels from yesteryear
Remember how the taste of failure makes it all clear
The lowly opportunists take commanding roles
And hawk ultimatums so their weakness won't show

The sad reflection of dead ambition
You live for nothing

Expectation, indoctrination
Life's a damnation
Submission complete!

Dying on your feet
Submission complete
A total defeat""




so i would say, life beats the shit out of you if you really want it to/let it. but its only because america is the biggest mindfuck in human history. we are born into shackles and most of us die in shackles. 

i, absolutley, will not let that happen. you shouldnt either. shoot the sniper before he shoots you.

thanks for the good times last night at my holiday party. you guys are my family and i seriously love all of you."

anyways, i have been so excited about florida that i have just been wishing my time away. so now, i both like and do not like how fast time has been going. i hope it doesnt go this fast in florida. moving on...

i have made the best music there is to make, pretty much. i got to have my record mastered in nashville... i did alot of hard work and it has been paying off. cant argue with that being awesome. i am very proud of myself. 

bad religion will be doing a show in covington. you can bet your ass that steve and i will be there, fingers in the air. cant argue with that not sucking. if anyone wants to tag along, you are absolutely welcome to. but i doubt you will because steve and i are the only people we know who listen to BR besides jake... but he's too busy being a brand of beer.

getting ready to start touring next year. which means i have to buckle down and save my money...i have responsi-bills-to-pay...
but it also means i have the honor and privelege of letting the things that i am good at doing define who i am. like playing my guitar. it also means that i dont have to be a fucking office clerk anymore. there is nothing like smashing your life into a tree and starting over. i am more excited about that than anything right now. i get to start over. i get to do something different. i couldnt be more grateful.

anyways, thats my life right now. bad punctuation/grammar and all.

if you want to stew on a thought, stew on what i find myself thinking about alot...

what is so fascinating about violence? i mean, its not like i am fascinated by it, but i feel like our society is in love with violence, hate, and fear. 
i am just curious as to why, as humans, we have to kill each other or cause pain and harm to one another to prove whatever it is that we have to prove. i dont know why this is, but i dont like it. and thats that...if being rational makes you a hippie, i guess im jerry fucking garcia.

Police: Senior citizen had $50K of cocaine in car

By Julie Manganis , Staff writer
Salem News


SALEM - An elderly driver who allegedly cut off an unmarked police cruiser, then made an obscene gesture at the officer behind the wheel, had more than $50,000 worth of uncut cocaine under his front seat, police say. 

Now Joseph Oreto, 72, of Revere and his passenger, Daniel Hibbard, 47, of Winthrop, are facing cocaine-trafficking charges.

i became interested in the related videos that came up after the original video ends. so i clicked on what looked like a police interview ""gone wrong"". i figured maybe it would just be like a fight or some guy fucking with the cops, or even sketch comedy- like not even real.
so the cop is about to interview some criminal. cop leaves the room for a second- and crimnal brandishes a gun from under his shirt and blows his own fucking head off. this is a REAL video. the guy shoots himself in the head. his eye kind of pops out and everything- i have to say that it was the single most disturbing thing i have ever seen in my life. and i didnt even know i was about to see it. for the first time in my life- i am truly offended by something in a media source. i got sick to my stomach and nearly shed a tear. i did not need to see that whatsoever. thanks myspace for taking the youtube phenomenon to ""the next level"" by not monitoring the fucking videos that come across your site- you fuckers. thats going to stay in my head for quite some time... i appreciate that.

i dont need to hold your hand to earn my keep.

"event","on my drive to my boring shithole job, in my wife's car that i have to drive since this is our country's fourth consecutive effort at suicide, i managed to take the life of a raccoon. i was, i'll admit, driving rather fast, and late for work. i felt guilty almost immediately afterwards. he came out of nowhere. i have no idea if it was a male or female, nor does it matter now. nor did it ever. it will no longer feel the need to destroy and eat my trash. nor did it ever. it is and was always meant to die that day on fairmount road. things are just where they need to be for that raccoon. so it goes.

get this: im at the gas station putting gas in my wife's car (suicide, you know), it was a modest amount of ten dollars. in the pump to the right, were about five tough biker types with really loud ""hogs"" and i suppose something to prove about their little peckers. four of the five were helmetless. although i know this is none of my business, i cant help but to wish a grisly accident upon the fucking geniuses who do this to themselves. why risk the health of your bloody sponge so that people can see how creepy your face is? and dont you know goddamnit, right there in that gas station, i did it again, i wished death on another motorist. 

those that call me ""friend"", are very familiar with my neverending deathwishes for idiot motorists. im sure alot of people are probably like that. well, not sure, but id bet AT LEAST five dollars that one in ten are.  

whatever.

so i left the gas station. only to stop about three hundred yards down the road in a traffic backup. there had been an accident. dont worry, it wasnt the bikers. oh, the power of words.

the police were routing traffic around the gas station in front of which it had happened. i had no idea what the fuck was happening. i was just trying to get to my shithole. the hive. you know, work.

as i came out of a neighboring restaurant from the gas station, i looked to my left at the scene that was inevitably to be looked at. i looked just like any other man would look. i looked and i learned a valuable lesson about looking. i looked and i saw enough to have my breath beaten from my body by shock. there, in the middle of the street, lay a body in a sheet. a dead human. so it goes. 

get this: i can't tell you WHY anything happens. i cant tell you THE why pertaining to the raccoon's death, or THE whys in my deathwishes. nor could i tell you THE why for that pedestrian, that was crossing bardstown road (on foot, just like the raccoon) in this armpit end of town, when a van struck and killed him almost forty five minutes before i killed a racoon with my vehicle. the only thing i can do is look at, deal with, and share the situation. 

i was crushed.

i was crushed because life is far too fragile to even write about. so fragile, its nearly meaningless because of which. and i think i learned everything i need to know about anything from this particular trip to the shithole.

do you think the human who killed the other human is going to WRITE about this? become an alcoholic? blow his brains out? its very possible. but i will give him some credit. most humans are outstanding at moving on emotionally dont you think? poor fella.

i see it this way. i took a life the EXACT same manner. just forty five minutes before the ford minivan driving human did. and i just kept driving. i didnt call the police. if i had, they would have been too busy up the road witht he human to come and help me with my raccoon situation. what does that say about things? human lives are more important than any other earthling life? yes. it does. i hope the police come to my scene first and not the raccoon's. that would be a motherfucker if not.

dripping with absolutley no sarcasm whatsoever, i pray that the dead human's family manages to overcome his death, and that the man in the minivan can keep kicking through his life in good mental shape. 

fuck.

on my way back to the house, i noticed there was no raccoon carcass. no, the police didnt come to the scene and file reports with the coroner or anything like that (oh, the power of words). im sure some lucky coyotes and vultures will eat like faberge dealers on thanksgiving. so good for them. as for the raccoon... so it goes."

You are more than a little eccentric, and you're apt to keep very unusual habits.
Whether you're a nightowl, living in a commune, or taking a vow of silence - you like to experiment with your lifestyle.
Expressing your individuality is important to you, and you often lie awake in bed thinking about the world and your place in it.
You enjoy staying home, but that doesn't mean you're a hermit. You also appreciate quality time with family and close friends.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whattimeofdayareyouquiz/"">What Time Of Day Are You?</a></div>"

<center><strong>Rational (NT)</strong></center>

You are both logical and creative. You are full of ideas.
You are so rational that you analyze everything. This drives people a little crazy!

Intelligence is important to you. You always like to be around smart people.
In fact, you're often a little short with people who don't impress you mentally.

You seem distant to some - but it's usually because you're deep in thought.
Those who understand you best are fellow Rationals.

In love, you tend to approach things with logic. You seek a compatible mate - who is also very intelligent.

At work, you tend to gravitate toward idea building careers - like programming, medicine, or academia.

With others, you are very honest and direct. People often can't take your criticism well.

As far as your looks go, you're coasting on what you were born with. You think fashion is silly.

On weekends, you spend most of your time thinking, experimenting with new ideas, or learning new things.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/threequestionpersonalitytest/"">The Three Question Personality Test</a></div>"

"event","Sometimes people come into your life & you know right away that they were meant to be there. to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson, or help you figure out who you are & or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be (possibly your roommate, neighbor, professor, long lost friend, lover, or even a complete stranger), but when you lock eyes with them, you know at the very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way. Sometime things will happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, & unfair at first, but in reflection you find that without overcoming these obstacles that you would have never realized your true potential, strength, will power, or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by mean of good luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness & sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without this small test, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. It would be safe & comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless. The people that you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience, help to create who you are and who you will become.Even the bad experiences are learned from. In fact, they are the most poignant ones. If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious when you open your heart. If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love & how to open your heart & eyes to things. Make everyday count. Appreciate every moment & take from those moments everything you possibly can for you may never be able to experience it again. Talk to people that you have never talked to before & actually listen... Let yourself fall in love again, break free, and set your sights high. Hold your head up because you have every right too. Tell yourself that you are a great individual & believe in yourself. For if you don't believe in yourself, it will be hard for others to believe in you. You can make your life anything you wish.....Create your own life & then go out & live it with absolutely NO REGRETS. Most importantly, if you love someone tell him or her, for you NEVER know what tomorrow may have in store. And learn a lesson in life each day you live. Today is the tomorrow you were worried about yesterday.... Was it worth it?"

"event","So before I left and drove home from CA yesterday I talked my Grandpa into buying a house..(holy crap). uh then I bought 10 SOBE's for 10 bucks before I left...couldn't resist.
 
Got home at 6. Went to Nicole's BBQ, went swimming.Grabbed something to eat then watched a movie. Got home around midnight..It was fun. Then Jenzen called me around 2am..""COME GET DRUNK WITH ME""...haha he's so crazy. Instead I stayed home and crashed. It felt good to sleep in my own bed.
then end."

So today I found out a opossum lives in my backyard! crazy I know. Went to the mall then saw War of the Worlds..not too bad, from the reviews I was expecting it to be real lame. Oh, I called that subway and it turns out they never put the money back on my card. So I have to go in and walk out with 80 dollars cash according to the manager.
Oh yea...theres no food. nothing to drink..I think i might die. hahaha..Im staying at my grandpa's house. He gets back from his 3week trip Saturday night. Until then Im just chillin."

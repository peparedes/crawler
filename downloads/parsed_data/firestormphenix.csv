"event","I really should be sleeping right now - I'm supposed to be up at 2:15 AM to get dressed and leave the house to pick up coffee and doughnuts and be at work for a bright and early start on inventory at 3AM. 

Now, considering that I just pulled a 12 hour 20 minute day counting the clothting inventory and chased it with another 4 hours of ballroom teaching, the fact that I'm still awake and able to type this is insane. Tomorrow I'll have a longer inventory day combined with another 3 teaching hours.


Sleep. Definitely overrated. I'm so much more productive without it."

numerous adventures, attempts at stabbing people for stupidity, and
general bad and hostile feelings, things are starting to get back to
some semblance of normal. I'm officially graduating in May - no thanks
to certain people I was surrounded by last year - and I think I'm in a
mildly better place because of it. I have to help Andre take care of
business because he is only a few credits off of graduating. Kinda
funny that this is coming from the guy that keeps telling me that he
can't wait to start planning our life together and knows that he has to
graduate in order to make this happen, but what can you do.<br>
<br>
I have a lot of important decisions to make in the not-so-distant
future. I need to find a job now for once school ends. I also need to
figure out whether I'm going to stick around here or try something new,
even though my parents won't be overjoyed at the prospect...I've been
invited to take some time off in VA by the couple that actually brought
us together. The sad thing is I'm actually contemplating it seriously.
I stayed here initially for undergraduate because I was afraid to let
someone go. I don't want to make that mistake twice, and I think it
might be good for me to go away for awhile. Seriously get away. I can't
block out all the other things going on in my life just because I don't
want to think about them. I have to take care of business...whether I
always want to or not.<br>
<br>
On the really bright side, Dre almost has an engagement date set in
stone. I'm kinda nervous, but at the same time it seems so
exciting...:-D<br>

Fun times....<br>

"event","It's been really strange to have an absolutely wonderful weekend with
only a minor snag. After the living hell that I've been though as of
late, I couldn't be more thankful for it if I tried.<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"">Thursday</span>&nbsp; -&nbsp; Reprieve granted!<br>
<br>
I was really nevous this particular Thursday because I had 2 exams for
the same professor in 2 different classses and I didn't really have the
time to study as much as I wanted to the night before. UGH! I knew I
shouldn't have stuck around for that Steampunk meeting but...it was so
much fun I couldn't help it. The next morning was that pesky snowstorm
which caught all of us off guard because by the weather reports, we
should have had a snowday. No such luck. Well, I went to drama (making
good on my promise to go to all my classes) - luckily we got out a few
minutes early so I went to the library to cram. Next I knew I was
breathing deeply as I entered the building for Criminology. Well, lo
and behold, wouldn't you believe there was a sign up that said ""Prof.
Holt's Soci 216 class is cancelled, exam Tuesday"". You wouldn't believe
the moment of shock that I had as I stared at the sign in disbelief. I
followed my next instinct, which was to go to Urban Sociology to see if
that exam was cancelled too. Sure enough, it was. My weekend started at
10:11 a.m.&nbsp; and I didn't even know it, plus I had more time to
study. Hoo-RAH!<br>
<br>
I spent the entire rest of the day at work. That is a whole different
story that could take a while to explain. All that need be said is that
it was fun and productive.<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"">Friday</span> - Enough is Enough<br>
<br>
I was awakened by a phone call from Bryan (my co-coordinator at the
SOC) who wanted to know what I meant by an e-mail I sent out to the
staff. Arg. Not cool. Again we discover that Janella had not briefed
him on anything , and he was on a warpath to take her out. He wanted to
meet at 12:15 at the SOC to talk to her. So much for a relatively lazy
day.<br>
<br>
I went to the SOC where we laid out a plan of attack and made ourselves
sound intelligent before we ran upstairs. Figuring I was the more
tactful one, I planned on being the one to introduce the topic. Sure
enough, when the time came to sit with my supervisor, I very tactfully
told her about all of the communication issues going in the SOC and how
it was not entirely my fault and Bryan's fault for circumventing
channels we did not know existed! She couldn't have been quieter if she
tried. For once, I was happy with my supervisor.<br>
<br>
Bryan and I had lunch with Suzanne at Chuck and Augies, followed by a
trip to the garage to get Bryan's car tested for emissions. Yay fun.
Then I drove to RI to get my poor car fixed ( a friend of Andre's knows
a great dealer that will fix it for cheap). Some of his friends had a
party, so we stuck around and crashed at the house.<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"">Saturday</span> - Easter nervousness and Chili bills<br>
<br>
We came back from RI just in time for me to fill in a Saturday shift
from 12-4. Kim and Chris stopped by, and we decided to go to the mall
after work. We never made it there, we only made it as far as Chili's
because they were hungry. It was then that I realized how sweet my
arrangement is with Dre when paying a bill. We stopped at the
supermarket so Kim could get the ingredients for her Heavenly pie to
bring to Chris's house, then went to mine so she could make it.&nbsp;
Hours later, we returned back to campus and I had to console her
about&nbsp; her nervousness and on what to wear. Too funny.<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"">Sunday</span> - Family get togethers<br>
<br>
Dre and I left for my house, where we were all departing for&nbsp;
mom's mother's house. I really didn't want to go, but I made myself
look nice and left anyway. She lives in a senior community in Hartford,
and Dre ran into one of his uncles there! Apparently my *gulp*
grandmother and his uncle know each other. Too funny yet again. <br>
<br>
I also saw my 4 month old cousin Jada. She's beautiful...and the sad
thing is that I can see traits of my cousin Danielle in her. She's
going to be quite a handful....<br>
<br>
We came home and life was good. Yay.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That brings me to today, where I'm sitting here planning out my week
though I should be in lab and just relaxing. Meh, sometimes you just
have to take time out for yourself.<br>"

that was afraid of her own shadow. Three incidents caused me so much
emotional damage that I lost confidence in being able to handle my

"event","It just dawned on me today that in a very short period of time I will be starting the next chapter of my life.<br>
<br>
You'd think this would have sunk in a long time ago. You'd think this
would have been obvious before, but it really wasn't. Not till today.<br>
<br>
I spent today hiding and studying for my Law and Society midterm essay.
I didn't really talk to anyone, save Ken whom I ran into when I ate
lunch. The exam itself wasn't too painful....at least afterwards I
didn't feel a need to throw up. I was on top of the world for awhile,
had a great dinner with friends, came back and did my DDR exercise for
the day, and then sat down at my computer to listen to a friend needing
help with room assignments. That's when I realized how scary this next
phase of my life is.<br>
<br>
<lj-cut text=""The rambling complaint of a scared senior"">
I'm leaving everything that's familiar - AGAIN. I can barely deal with
all the leftover crap from the last mess, now I have to figure out when
all this will be resolved, secure gainful employment, and ponder if
marriage is really what I want, all while maintaining a composed
exterior while trying not&nbsp; to fall off the deep end. Quite
frankly, I'm scared shitless. I haven't felt this way since senior year
of high school - of course then I had an obsene number of
recommendations and grades to boot. I feel like I have almost nothing.
Everything is messed up, and I just want to curl up in a corner and cry
the rest of my life away.The only perk to this situation is that I'm
not necessarily rebelling against this change, I just feel like I'm
less than adequately prepared to start a new beginning. There is no
safety net if I screw up...nothing that will save my butt except me. I
feel like I cannot articulate what I'm trying to say. I do not feel
intelligent anymore. I feel like a very messed up shell of what I used
to be. Then again, no one would ever believe what I'm going through.
Not that I'd really expect them to. They'd just think I'm messed up and
dismiss me as fast as they asked.
</lj-cut>
<br>
<br>
At least today was better than yesterday. Maybe someday everything will feel alright again.<br>"

I'm happy to report one thing though - at least I can breathe out of my nose. This seemed to be a lost art. :)

I awakened to more coughing and sickness, took some medicine, had lunch, took more medicine, and cleaned. Oh, and there was that trip with Kim to Walmart and racing back here to fill in for a couple of hours at work.

I definitely think it's time for a change. Not sure how to make that happen though. I'll start by rearranging this room, maybe switching desks, and playing some DDR. 

Sadly enough, the only thing I'd like right now is to be held by my boyfriend, who unlike me will have both Sunday and Monday off and refuses to come down here without me blatantly saying so due to a paper. I'm not feeling so well, and I have to beg and plead to get someone that's not going to act all phony about caring for me? At least giving me a hug?

I'm so glad I'll be feeling better soon. All this will make a lot more sense.

I should get to work on that other backentry that makes the friends only post make more sense. Next project!"

"event","Well, today has been quite oxymoronic. Quite oxymoronic indeed.

I woke up this morning to discover, much to my happiness, that I didn't have to help Dave prep for his competition. I really wasn't in the mood to go back to UConn after being there already the last 4 days I was supposed to have off. The phone call came at about 10 o'clock this morning, so I promptly jumped for joy, ran upstairs, and tried to lay down for the first time in weeks.

OXYMORONIC OCCURENCE 1: And then I get another phone call. It's Bryan, telling me that I need to fill out my timecard before 5pm today.

Now, of course when I went to CSI yesterday there weren't any timecards, but hey, of course they are up there on my day off - which means I have to drive to campus anyway to sign off on it. Of course.

There was going to be a saving grace to all of this - I was going to get my issues with the bank all straightened out, since they were the only ones that could unlock my account. Then I was going to go to the store to get stuff for the surprise dinner I'm making for Dre and his parents, and stop at the house to tidy up and clear out the truck.

OXYMORONIC OCCURRENCE 2: I didn't make it past UConn.

At first I was going to park in the metered parking area, but decided to park in S lot. Sure enough, I see a friend's car in the row across from me! I stopped to call them to see where they were, but they didn't answer.

OXYMORONIC OCCURENCE 3: I didn't have to go to the bank. The flag had magically disappeared off of the account.

I have no clue what to say about that. After weeks of not having the time to fix this account, it's now fine. ARG! The teller just looked at me with this really confused look and said that everything was fine. Sigh. What can you do.

OXYMORONIC OCCURRENCE 4: Well, I went to the SOC where I did another 2 hours worth of work (ON MY DAY OFF).

We (Bryan and I) were going to work some stuff out with the guy that's over our supervisor, since we're transitioning from one to another, but of course the new one was there - and just as clueless as ever. I would have thought she would have been diving headfirst in all of this, but no. She was too afraid to step on the predecessors toes. I suppose I can actually sympathize with that...

OXYMORONIC OCCURRENCE 5: As I'm walking back to the parking lot with my friend, he gets a call from a job - his first one since he graduated in December! 

We decided to stop at the bar in the Nathan Hale Inn to celebrate. Of course I end up staying there till 5. By the time I was finished reliving the good ol' days and what not, it was late and people were driving stupid. To little sense to drive another 15 minutes to tidy up the house when I had to go back there later anyway. And the store? That was out too.

So the plan for today was supposed to be exercise, practice, timecard, bank, store, cleaning house, cleaning truck, cooking, and pampering myself before the craziness that will be tomorrow.

Today ended up as timecard, bank, SOC, and sitting on this computer. Can't win them all I suppose.


In other news, Dre will be coming home tomorrow. This is great, considering I have not spent more than 2 hours with him since December 15th, roughly. What is not so great is that I have to drive his beloved baby (his 2003 truck) to the airport in SLEET at 10 o'clock at night. It wouldn't be so bad if I only had to deal with him, but I also have to make an appearance in front of his parents, who very well might ask me to drive home because they will be tired. Sigh. I guess it's no crazier than anything I dealt with in 2004, right?

Who am I kidding. Nothing could be worse than reliving all of that...and rest assured I won't, darn it."

purchase in over 2 years that wasn't food), but it didn't look all that
great and I really wanted something that would make me feel more like
the beautiful, sophisticated woman that I'm supposed to be and less
like the scrub that I usually feel like. Go fig. Once I got back, it
was all about my new WinTV system...yeah.<br>
<br>
You'd think that I would have outgrown things like techtoys by now, but I guess I will always have a little techie inside me.<br>
<br>
I did nothing else today but relax - and that's probably a good thing
considering everything else I have to do tomorrow. Looks a little
something like this:<br>
<br>
Call Progressive<br>
E-mail reminder/update everyone about Friday's Demonstration<br>
Check Dre's to make sure everything's peachy<br>
Clean room<br>
Laundry<br>
Call Dean of Students to make an appointment<br>
Call Dentist<br>
Work 12-5<br>
Take  </span><lj user=""ooohshinyobject"" /><span class=""ljuser"" style=""white-space: nowrap;"">&nbsp; to the mall/Dunkin Donuts/anywhere else <br>
<br>
And that's the abbreviated list...man, I should really go to bed...<br>

I don't know how my mother is being strong through all of this. I don't know how my father is dealing with all of this. I don't know if it's just me who's screwed up or if it's the rest of the world. I'm torn between me and this crazed desire to make everyone else happy. It's almost to the point that bad things are happening not because of things I did or didn't do, but because I was imposing them on myself unconcously. There are just so many things that I need to take care of, to do, to be.
 
I did the only thing that I could think of to do that I had never tried. 

I decided to say FU to the rest of the world, I've got to take care of me for a minute.

It's amazing the feeling of liberation you get from just telling people to leave you alone or taking care of things you need taken care of just because it needs to be done. Because you want them to be. No one else.

Thank God I'm starting to learn how to do this before it was too late..."

Then I finally found my Ballroom Master Disk! (YAY!!!) Only problem is, it's not working. It's really not that big of a problem because I did make a backup CD, but I don't remember when I backed it up the last time, so it may be missing a few files. Oh well. 

I've got some friends visiting soon, so I should probably get ready...I just really want to get this CD working..."

I've been overly sensitive for awhile now, and I decided to cut the crap last week. It feels so incredibly wonderful!!! Angela called this morning to firm up plans for Sunday as well as to let me bounce a couple of ideas off her. I can't wait to see her this weekend!

For the first time since I started this position I actually feel like I know both what I want to do and how I want to go about it. I have a set plan and people that I know will support something that is well thought out and will ditch anything that doesn't seem productive. After re-reading the bylaws and realizing that I didn't have the descriptions right, a couple of things are going to change...yay.

Aside from doing some much needed ""me things"" like sleeping in and light brainstorming, I heard the most wonderful song from Jill Scott called ""Golden"". It's about appreciating life, freedom, and happiness...and being that it's my new focus, that's exactly what I needed as a theme!

Now I'm going to start working on e-mail #2, as well as the agenda for the next meeting. This should be interesting...."

I'm having a lot of problems relaxing. I can't separate work from personal life, and that's proving to be a very difficult task, especially with a presidency and entrance exams right around the corner. Anyone have any really good ways of getting your mind to turn off after a really long week?

On a good note, I've finally started work on my new costume. Hopefully it'll be ready for the home competition (wait, was I competing in that? eh, probably not) or at least for my next pro-am should I decide to do one. Whoo hoo!!!"

A couple of days ago a friend of mine told me I was absolutely nuts for trying to go to law school. I think that since somebody probably told Oprah that she couldn't do it, I'm just not going to take it as personally as I have been and just use it as determination to do it that much more. So there.

So now, more cleaning, more sorting of ballroom information, and figuring out what the heck to do about some paperwork for school, and getting this all done before Dre comes back from his job.

Go me."

"event","Well, after the wonderful weekend I had with Andre, the real world
kinda seemed so distant, so...removed. I guess that's definitely one of
the benefits of seeing someone like him - someone that makes you think
that you're on top of the world, someone that makes you realize that
the world isn't so doom and gloom.<br>
<br>
After a long drive back from RI this morning at the crack of dawn, a
nap, and a movie, I realized that I have to get a job. This really
wouldn't be so bad of a thing except that no one's going to hire
someone this late in the summer for only a month. Whatever job I get
has to be a permanent part-time issue - on top of 2 majors (or a major
and a minor), a presidential position, and a job that I'll probably get
on campus. I knew that the real world could stink, but it doesn't look
like I'm going to enjoy this at all. So much for my senior year being
fun and a time to celebrate all my hard work...<br>
<br>
Theoretically, I should be happy - I definitely won't be bored. I might
be sad, but not bored. I think I might curl up and sniffle a bit now.<br>"

"event","Well, I guess today goes in the record books as both the best esteem-boosting day and the most aggravating ending to an esteem-boosting day.

After working quite a few hours (with some overtime!) I came home, turned on the air conditioner, and went to sleep. I awakened at 2:15 pm in a state of shock that I had slept that long. After freshening a bit and getting dressed, I wandered downstairs, poked mom to get ready, and then it was off to go shopping for last minute things for the two weddings that I'm going to be attending.

After a brief stop at one Payless, I decided to cash my check at the bank. A man who was also filling out something at the counter asked me if we had met before. I said that it was entirely possible as I've been meeting an insane number of people lately. He then smiled uneasily and asked if I were single, to which I responded no. He then asked if I were marriend, to which I told him no as well. Then he asked which one it was, and I responded that I was seeing someone at the time. He then sighed, said oh well, and told me to have a nice day. He then left the bank and drove away. It was definitely nice to have someone notice me...

Well, I thought that was the funniest thing and promptly laughed all the way to the car. Mom inquired about all my laughter, and I told her what had happened. Quite funny stuff, really. 

The next stop was Buckland, where she could pick up her shoes and I could hunt for any lasp minute necessities. I was greeted by a number of glances and stares as I walked, and I have to admit it felt really really good. It was great, really. More people saying hello and acting like they knew me. Maybe they did and I just didn't realize it. 

We didn't see any shoes for her there, so I harassed mom to go to DSW. Well, as I sat out in the parking lot this woman comes up next to me, gets out of her car, and walks around the car. She informs me that I'm apparently going to do great things for young people. Well, I don't know what to say about that. I'll keep you posted.

When I had my conversation with Dre earlier, he then reminded me that we probably should have reserved a hotel room for the wedding. !@#$%^& simply because I asked him about that 3 weeks ago! Sigh....oh well. I guess I'll just make the trips and call it a day...wish me luck."

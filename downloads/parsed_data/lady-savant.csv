"event","no one leaves home unless
home is the mouth of a shark
you only run for the border
when you see the whole city running as well

your neighbours running faster than you
breath bloody in their throats
the boy you went to school with
who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory
is holding a gun bigger than his body
you only leave home
when home won't let you stay.

no one leaves home unless home chases you
fire under feet
hot blood in your belly
it's not something you ever thought of doing
until the blade burnt threats into
your neck
and even then you carried the anthem under
your breath
only tearing up your passport in an airport toilets
sobbing as each mouthful of paper
made it clear that you wouldn't be going back.

you have to understand,
that no one puts their children in a boat
unless the water is safer than the land
no one burns their palms
under trains
beneath carriages
no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck
feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled 
means something more than journey.
no one crawls under fences
no one wants to be beaten
pitied

no one chooses refugee camps
or strip searches where your
body is left aching
or prison,
because prison is safer
than a city of fire
and one prison guard
in the night
is better than a truckload
of men who look like your father
no one could take it
no one could stomach it
no one skin would be tough enough

the
go home blacks
refugees
dirty immigrants
asylum seekers
sucking our country dry
niggers with their hands out
they smell strange
savage
messed up their country and now they want
to mess ours up
how do the words
the dirty looks
roll off your backs
maybe because the blow is softer
than a limb torn off

or the words are more tender
than fourteen men between 
your legs
or the insults are easier 
to swallow
than rubble
than bone
than your child body
in pieces.
i want to go home,
but home is the mouth of a shark
home is the barrel of the gun
and no one would leave home
unless home chased you to the shore
unless home told you 
to quicken your legs
leave your clothes behind
crawl through the desert
wade through the oceans
drown
save
be hunger
beg
forget pride
your survival is more important

no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear
saying-
leave,
run away from me now
i dont know what i've become
but i know that anywhere
is safer than here.

I don't want to make new friends. I don't want bodies. At some point, for whatever reason, you'll leave, and ill still be here. Most of you aren't my type anyway. I want you to do your fucking job while leaving me the fuck alone. Just pretend i'm not here once I give you report. Do what needs to be done and go home when your shift is done.

Also, a good caregiver is one who takes care of themselves so they have something to give. Driving yourself into the ground for someone else's benefit, in the long term, is of benefit to No One! Besides, if you can't take care of yourself how are the people you care for going to learn how?

I didn't get much sleep last night but give learned a lot about my tablet in the process. Luckily my music sync seems to be going far better this evening. It took me all day to get it going, and I need to stay up until its done so no one ducks it up, but its working.

I had probably my first tooth cleaning today. It was really deep. Pick, sonic pick, water pick, mouthwash, laser pick! My mouth is sore!! I go back Friday to finish my root canal. Yay! I should have said no thank you to the fluoride treatment. My teeth went from squeaky clear to yuck in no time.

I'm really getting in to using the slowcooker to cook whole chickens. Nice and juicy. I just miss the crunchy skin, but the house staying cooler is a major plus. Chicken breast, over cheese sauce, over broccoli and cornflower. Yum!

When this transfer is done in going to bed. I should do some reading in the meantime."

I don't have everything that I want and I don't always have everything that I need, but I have some good people around me who care about me (even when my brain says they don't or shouldn't). I have things to do that challenge me and that I enjoy. 

I'm coming to realize, (... Again?) that I don't have to keep track of everything that everyone thinks I need to keep track of. (I'm in the process of culling Facebook groups and pages.) Andd if what makes me happy is unpopular who cares, if it bothers people it's not my problem unless they try to change me which point I can take necessary action, but people don't care unless I put a counterpoint on a news site on Facebook. Why do I care what they think anyway? 

""Why do I care?"" is a good question. I want to leave this world a better place than I found it and there are just so many asshats running around. But I can't fix everyone... Or anyone for that matter. So I choose to live by example. 

In other news:
I have found that eating too many carbs, espechily grains throws my moods off and that exercise is a joy that wrangles my moods back in. I found myself wondering why it takes to become a trainer or fitness coach this morning. I'll look in to that later though if the idea sticks with me. </p>"

I really should be heading to bed but I wanted to journal first.

I reopened and transferred my digital magical notes over to <lj user=""Savantium"" />, my magical journal. I really do not think paper journaling is for me. I love the versatility and ease of LJ. I just finished that up. I kept forgetting that I was in the middle of doing it. Just as I keep forgetting that I am in the middle of reading an email from <lj user=""uke_avalon"" />

Today I slept in after going to bed at 0630. Derwin confused his bosses at work about the hearing aid and Kerr programs and they called me at 0930. I'm sure I was surly. I clerified things for them and then went back to sleep. Tyrnan called at 1230 and woke me again. He was on his way to the eye doctor because he hadn't adjusted to his new glasses in under four days. He let me go so I could go back to sleep but my bladder disagreed with that plan and I got up and showered. Made breakfast and such. 

Derwin got home first and didn't close the garage. Then Brian got home and gave him hell for forgetting. I took off with the car to the library, Powell's and then the bank. I picked up ""Why we get fat and what to do about it"" by Gary Taubes, ""The Weiser concise guide to alchemy"" by Brian Cotnoir, ""The way of the crucible"" by Robert Allen Bartlett, and ""The book of crystal spells"" by Ember Grant. The first book was prebought and my main reason for going. The last book practically jumped off the shelf and demanded I take it home with me. 

I realized that I had spent more money than I had intended and really need to watch that next month and pay Amanda back and get Erik to do my reading first thing.

I got none of the gardening done I had planed but did a little reading and much chatting on fb. I made the peirogies for dinner. some of them had been punctured and gotten water inside and were no longer good and got tossed. But there was more than enough for everyone. 

Brian and I spent the evening listening to old country music and tinkering on our respective computers while Derwin hung out in his bedroom. I still wish I had gotten more reading done. 

Ah well. It is late and I told Brian to wake me after he finished with my screed project so I could help him with the garage tomorrow before the magical meet up. I still need to make my dish for tomorrow as well. That will be easy though. Assuming I have frozen peas. If not I will need to go to the store first. 

Good night y'all. Safe travels."

Us humans are lots of small tribes crammed into tiny spaces we call cities and towns, why are we so surprised that its so hard for us to get along?

This evenings meal was delicious. It could probably use some refining but it still taste good. Steamed shrimp dumplings sprinkled with sesame oil and mushroom sauce, blanched baby bak choy with a spicy sauce, mung bean-sprouts fresh from our counter. There was also rice but I am trying to avoid starches. 

This is after having Sonic for lunch with a molten cake desert and a chocolate cherry rootbeer. 0_0 

We did a good bit of running around today. We bought two 10'X10' easy-up canopies from Grocery outlet because it is the cheapest we have ever seen it plus they had a $20 off limit two coupon to go with it. So they were dirt cheap. One is for the back porch and the other will be for vending. I will sew some side panels for it over the next year. We stopped at the closest store and I called two others before finding one that still had them in stock. 

I mailed <lj user=""uke_avalon"" />'s birthday gift to him today. They said it should reach him on Monday. Brian showed me where his friend took him fishing this year and its a nice little spot I think I would like to go swimming. The idea makes Brian's teeth chatter. lol Lizard! We cleaned up some mess that other people made of the area. Two paper grocery bags full. I'm still always amazed at how filthy my fellow Americans are. 

I have done one walk today. And started reading ""She loses, He loses"" by Karen Miller-Kovach. Dr. Moffit recommended Weight Watchers and I know that it worked well for Kat and Taylor so I am reading the material. Seems finding a definitive guide to start with is hard to find which I find very frustrating. 

0013 on the 6th
I'm down to just a hand full of things still to wash. That makes three loads of dishes his evening. But that's for the last two days. I am considering packing up half of our coffee mugs to free up some cupboard space.I will ask Brian what he thinks of that tomorrow. He was napping after dinner, food coma, and helped me put the last of the food away then headed to bed.

Discussing gender issues with <lj user=""uke_avalon"" /> I said this. 
""I think one of the things that get me about gender identity is that most of it is based off societies view of what each gender is and should be/look like while in truth we are all a flux of being and can call upon either spectrum as needed or desired.""
 
I got the last of the dishes done and drying. I have spent way more time on facebook than I did reading and that sucks. Need to adjust that. I think I will bake banana bread tomorrow night. For now I think I need to head to bed. Good night y'all and Safe travels."

<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Chaotic Good</b> A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society. Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a good heart with a free spirit. However, chaotic good can be a dangerous alignment when it disrupts the order of society and punishes those who do well for themselves.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.
<br><br><u>Class:</u><br><b>Sorcerers</b> are arcane spellcasters who manipulate magic energy with imagination and talent rather than studious discipline. They have no books, no mentors, no theories just raw power that they direct at will. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire them more slowly, but they can cast individual spells more often and have no need to prepare their incantations ahead of time. Also unlike wizards, sorcerers cannot specialize in a school of magic. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they have more time to learn fighting skills and are proficient with simple weapons. Charisma is very important for sorcerers; the higher their value in this ability, the higher the spell level they can cast.

I think a big part of the reason I have never felt like I found my path in life is that I have spent my entire life searching for it outside myself. Even when I knew it couldn't be found there.

I have officially laid aside my business. This, at least ad it has been, is not my path and I have put more than enough energy and time into it to know. I recived council from both Taylor and Amanda on this in the last eight mints and have made up my mind

What this means is I have the time and energy to put towards the things that matter to me instead of what I ""Think"" I should be doing to ""Get ahead"". I am reading more and since the only projects I have are for myself or gifts I want to give I am not pressuring myself to favor one over the other. 

This will also free up monies for me to follow my desires for learning or social participation. I want to get back to my yoga class but also have a daily yoga and tai chi chaun practice. I want to take a few classes; archery, lampworking, welding, fiber spinning, possibly fire dancing. I'm looking into either buying of creating my own portable labyrinth. The small trinity labyrinth I found and like is one thousand dollars though so buying one will probably have to wait.

Something I have thought a great deal about over the years is, ""what do I want to do with my life?"" I came across a new title/profession the other day while reading ""way of the winding path"", 'labyrinth facilitator'. This appealed to me a great deal and I am looking into it. I have found certification courses, two really, and they look interesting even if I never go in to leading others. But I like the idea of sharing my knowledge with others in the long-run. 

I want to go to some of the conventions and fairs that have caught my eye over the years. Pantheacon, NorWesCon, Faireworlds, Pacific fire gathering, Shabaricon, portland juggling festival, the county fair and explanations. As well as getting back to old favorites. All's fair, OryCon, pagan fair, pagan pride day, Saturday market.

Sometimes u get to thinking about how unprepared I am, we are, if shit hits the fan in the world. And I'm pretty convinced that it will in my lifetime. And yet I am whole unprepared for it. 

There's this guy on Facebook who gets me seriously thinking about it often. He's a survivalist hardcore, off the grid totally prepared type. Kinda where I wish I were. 

Part of my difficulty in this is how on earth would I prepare for a disaster in regards to Derwin? Oxygen and ventilator needs. Forts I think going solar would be ideal, having the concentrator is a plus. To my knowledge as long as they are not running at time of EMP they would continue to work after a hit. Am I wrong? 

I can't currently move out of the city, party because of lack of funds and partly due to Derwin's need for services. I've talked to my roommate about keeping chickens and he's like why would we want to.

On the 3rd
I'm what I would call depressed this evening. I'm feeling worthless and useless and like a complete failure. I feel like I get by far more in life than I thrive or am happy in it. I'm just barely keeping my head above water today. 

I don't know why I am giving Amanda business or life advice she is doing far batter than I am at either of them. She's not massively in debt and people are buying her product. 

I just never seem to get enough of a footing to make a sufferance in my own damned life. Paul says I have had a great impact on many lives and that I am a great example to others.. It's a nice thought but my life is going no where quickly and if it is it isn't usually anywhere I want to go. 

I don't get like this often. I'm just wondering why it feels like I am trying so hard and getting nowhere for my effort?

I called the hospitals billing department today to get their mailing address for the last bit of paperwork they needed from me. It's been over a week and an in city letter should have reached me by now. I got that in the mail. Yay. She made it sound like it had already been approved so that gives me even more hope that my bill will be covered. 

I've been thinking of display ideas for future events and have come up with a really cool one involving large picture frames, satin fabric and crocheted lace. Amanda seems to really like it as well. So when I get money I get to troll goodwill for picture frames and baring that make some myself. 

Also I am going to look for a vending cage to re-paint. Several of the vendors have them and I think they would only benefit us. Diana could barely be bothered to talk about the business at the stitch n bitch this evening because she brought a friend and spent most of the time talking to her, she only really became more social when Delight arrived and sat on the opposite side of Amanda and I. I found it very aggravating. I enjoyed seeing Delight though. 

Kat has a bookmark commission for me but got called into work early today and has to postpone. I think we agreed on tomorrow. Its a simple design but like all cross stitch time consuming. I just wish other people appreciated it and their books enough to buy my bookmarks. I appreciate that Kat and Taylor see the worth of what I make. They don't strike me as the type to buy something just because we're friends, which I also appreciate. 

I have two necklaces on my bead-board waiting to be strung and many other ideas. I don't have many charms but I've been reading about prayer strands and they are not required really. 

On my walk as I talked to Paul this evening a black cat walked up to me for pets with very little, read practically none, coaxing. They stayed for several minutes before the neighbors racket and my jangly keys spooked them. Bastet, are you listening? Are you still there? 

And here I am feeling tears prick my eyes again. I think it might be time for a shower before it gets too late. Besides, no one questions tears in the shower...

Why does it still blow my mind that my last period started June tenth? It just randomly hits me from time to time. I never disliked having a period and now it's kind of sad, more than a little sad, that I will never have another.

Today has been good. Hanging at the house with Brian, Derwin in the other room. I've been reading mostly from ""The plant spirit familiars"" book. I think my brain is a little roasted on it though. I pulled out my last few finished dragon-scale items to tuck tails on to complete. Tomorrow I will write up price lists and start putting tags on everything else. 

Brian went for a walk with me again this evening. He talked to his mom on the phone most of the way. She's always been nice. She asked how I was, Manny even asked how I was when Brian was testing her while we were out shopping with Amanda yesterday. It was a nice walk. When we arrived home it felt much warmer in the house then it had before we left. Brian is making dinner this evening at my prompting. Pancakes, eggs and bacon. Yum! He is mostly Plainfield Call of Duty today and doing laundry. 

I slept without my bellyband for the first time last night. It was a little odd but good. I didn't wake up in any unusual pain or anything. This prompted me to go a good portion of my day without it, which again physically felt odd but not painful really. I am still sore. Feels like an deep ache that refuses to go away, until it's suddenly gone and you remember and wonder when it left usually. I put it back on when I decided to go for my walk.

Today has been busy. I had a good time because I was with good friends, Brian and Amanda. He drove and in doing so helped me help the last bit I could with the Faireworlds preparations. Amanda picked up the last of everything she needed from the seven stores we hit today. Luckily in spending a little gas she was able to save probably at least one honored dollies on things for the event. We were out from two to seven o'clock in the enjoy doing it. 

Before getting Amanda Brian took me to the library and then Bi-Mart to pick up a book on hold ""Witchcraft on a shoestring"" and then 4oz jam mason jars for storing herbs and oils and ointments in. 

Getting home was nice. we goofed on the pcs for a while then I did dishes and he cleaned litter boxes and floors. I Lisa got on the cleaning kick cause A) the warm house stank when we walked in and B) it bothers me to do spellwork in a dirty space. Messy I can deal though it is not ideal, dirty needs cleaning idlers it is a spelling Emergancy, of which I have never had one. 

I put new herbs in new jars and pulled out my never before been used coffee... I mean herb grinder and powdered myself some basil for later use. So I now have basil and powdered basil. 

Brian went off to have a beer with Manny and I decided to come upstairs and follow through on an idea that has been kicking around my brain. It goes something like this...

I have more knowledge in my head then I have ever even tried to use. 

So as I think about my future and things I want to take forward in my life my herbal studies, both medicinal and magical, stand forefront in my mind. Also being more active but that is another habit and mental block I am working on. 

So I have been researching herbs again and when I think of spellwork I turn towards herbs and crystals first, well second because I first thought of Bune and when I meditated on him I got a big ""do what you know"" from him. I thought about it and realized that I had stepped away from a path that means a great deal to me. So I pulled my favorite spell and reference books off the shelves and started seeing what might work for me. 

I would say my favorite spellbook is ""Everyday Magic"" by Dorothy Morrison. For reference I pull out Scott Cunningham every time. 

When i got up here I cleared a shelf of library books to move my meditation books out of the way so I had another shelf for the storage of my growing collection of Ball jam and ointment jars. I will get a bit bigger size next month for things I buy more of/I used more often. 

I'm working on turning my vanity into a working altar space as well. First things first is putting away laundry and cleaning my room. I have a box of journals with little bits in each that need to be transcribed and well bits of things everywhere in my life. 

0102
Laundry put away, books moved, herb shelves organized, time for a nice relaxing shower. showering makes my incision feel better Which makes me sleep better. 

Across the street two cop cars have a car pulled over. They finally turned off the red and blue lights and have been talking to him for a while. Now they are searching his vehicle. This is a first for this neighborhood since we've lived here, at least while I was home. 

0148
The shower was nice. The air drying was relaxing. I read more from ""The plant spirit familiar"" by Christopher Penczak. With this renewed tug from the plant and mineral, mostly plant, worlds it is a very perfect book for me. It will be the one book I buy next month. But i am tired and need to get to sleep. Safe travels y'all. 

0241
Sleep has proven elusive, And I have proven to be hungry. I am up eating some mashed red potatoes made with broth buttered seasoned and topped with feta cheese. I'm reading more on the green path. This falls very much in line with a call/invitation I received from the fairy underworld tradition that Kat practices. At least it feels that way to me. 

Via google maps it is 3.8 miles to the Sunnyside Kaiser permanente which has the closest labyrinth to my house... That I know of. I would really like to work up to walking there daily. It says it is just over an hour walk one way. Two hours of walking a day is a good bit of activity and a worthy goal I think. 

I can honestly say I have felt the Call of the Green as long as I can remember. Now, back to reading and making my plans.

It occurred to me that I have not done spell-work in quite some time. And I know that I have never done spell-work for money. And I got to thinking about this because I have never not needed money in my life. I have always been broke and barely getting by money wise. 

Digging deeper into this I realize that I have a block as far as me having enough money goes. There is a part of me that actively believes I will never have enough money and helps make it a reality. I sabotage myself regularly. 

Now, my reason for not ever doing magic for money has nothing to do with the ""you can't/shouldn't do magic for personal gain"" crap I heard much of when I was first starting out. I doubt the Gods will get pissed if I get a head on my bills and can put good food on my table. In fact I think that's just the sort of things they Would want because the healthier and happier I am the better I can serve them. Not that I subscribe to the me serving the Gods schtick. I believe in working with the Gods and entities and energies, etc. But, Anyway...

So, I've been looking into it today, well started last night. I pulled out ""Everyday Magic"" by Dorothy Morrison. I have decided to try a few things. One is for my business mostly, a money drawing ointment/oil. Another is for my medical bills, a jar enchantment. Not sure if that's the right term for it but it seems to me to be. 

I went gathering supplies today. Yellow and green candles and much herby goodness. There are some crystal ideas for some other types of spells but they will have to wait or be found in my beading/crystal stash. I found out after the shopping that Brian's check was really short and luckily I had not spent much and could cover what he was short on bills. I have just enough to get sone mason jam jars to store the herbs. 

Earlier today I tripped down the last three stairs inside the house. I'm glad that I wasn't any further up. Admittedly I was goofing with my brother at the time but my equilibrium towards the top of the stairs has been shaky lately. I hurt my pinky keeping myself upright and gave myself quite a scare. I was shaking for a while afterwards. I also rattled my gut a bit because it has been more sore since. 

I went over and talked to Amanda for a little while. An item exchange was inorder for some magical equipment. I need to write out pricing instructions for a good bit of my yarn stuff. There is just little point individually pricing everything. The jewelry and bookmarks are another matter. The insane part is how much longer it takes to cross stitch one bookmark verses one crochet or knit one pouch. I think it is hard for buyers to wrap their heads around the fact that something a quarter of the size can take four times long to make. 

0343
I think I drank way too much coffee today. The most I've drank in one day since mid June. I knew I should be tired and was a little. I laid down and have kind of dozed off and on. Then Derwin made a really loud sound downstairs and I went to investigate. Turned out that he was frustrated with his game. I grabbed a bowl of cereal and brought it back up to my room. I started reading ""Magical Identity"" by Taylor Ellwood. I will admit that sometimes I feel he is way over my head and ten he will say something that just makes perfect sense or clicks with something I just understand. It's good stuff and will at the very least make you think. 

My stomach is still sore. I need to stop slouching as well. It doesn't help it not Hirt. In fact I think it is contributing to the pain. 

Finding white to black variegated yarn in the weight I need is really a pain in the ass. I might have to see if I can commission it in the long run.

Out for a walk, taking a break at the park. It's really nice out right now though a bit of a breeze would be nice. Ever notice that about people we an usually find fault and a better situation than we are in even if it's the best we've ever had. 

I tried to lay on my stomach on the floor to pet a Moose a few nights ago and it only took a second, probably less, to figure out thy was a bad idea. I still mostly feel like I've been gut-punched with a sledgehammer.. Repeatedly. My gut feels bruised and deep breathing makes me really feel it. 

Staying asleep is getting easier though I am still taking the oxycodone to get to sleep. I can sleep on both sides now even. I'm not sure if sitting leaning back or forwards is more aggravating to my lower abdomen, but I am certain that I would go nuts and probably not heal as well if I just laid in bed all day. 

My energy levels have been lower the last few days. Joann reminded me of the blood transfusion and that my iron could be low again and told me i looked rather pale. So today I started taking my iron again. I think I might want to switch to the poached fish in the evening and a salad and something for lunch, the heavier Mexican we have been having is... well, sitting more heavily in my stomach and feeling blah. 

I am letting myself sleep the longer hours it seems to want this week. I'm not sure if it's energy level or shear frustration and lack of direction in life, maybe I'm depressed. It feels weird that something so big could come and go through my life and barely leave a ripple behind it. I mean I get to miss and event I was REALLY looking forward to experiencing and vending at and I get a huge bill I can't really afford which puts me way further behind then I ever have been before debt wise towards my goal of owning my own home and being able to afford basic good food for my family every day and night. Other than that my life is pretty much moving on without skipping a beat and it again amazes me. Same thing happened when our mom died. A whirlwind of activity and then routine. I miss my childhood. Through the chaos, pain, heartache it was easier to deal with then this routine that makes me feel like I am going nowhere. 

As for that bill. The financial department at OHSU caught up with me and we set up a temporary payment plan they like to set it up to be paid off in 30 months and that would be $230 a month, which I could pull off by the skin of my teeth but would rather not try. So they agreed to $175 until my financial aide is processed at which point we can revisit it and might even get my money back if they decide to cover my entire bill. I need to get off my ass and do some magic. 

0116 on the 20th
I enjoy talking with Joann, Derwin's main nurse now, she really seems to care about me and gives me good advice on Derwin and my own dealings. She told me tonight something I mentioned earlier about possibly being a bit depressed. I guess this morning she had talked to Brian about that very possibility. She tells me that it's okay to morn what I've lost. And I know it is, I've just never been good at it. I'm not sure I know how and letting go has never been my strong suit. I find myself crying now that I'm upstairs alone in my room. Tears rolling down my cheeks as I type this. 

Nothing has changed, yet everything has changed. My brother Ty hasn't asked me how I'm doing since I left the hospital (glad he was so concerned), I don't hear from Amanda much already, I've seen/heard from Kit once since I got out (kinda brushed by each other on Facebook a few times), Kat and Taylor are on vacation on the east coast. None of this is really a bad thing or out of the ordinary... Just... Everything feels the same as before and something like this happens you would think things would change. 

I want to continue loosing weight, in a healthy way this time, but Brian is back to not exercising and never wanted to walk with me when he was on his running kick. Even knowing it would be really good for me he doesn't say ""okay kid, let's go for that walk now. No really you need this as much as I do."" he just sits there playing Facebook games on his laptop and chatting with others on his phone. I get hugs when he passes me and he helps with things I specifically ask for but he's not one to push me for my own good. 

And yes I know that I'm whining about something I should do for myself. I want to be in better shape. It's one of my main goals, though changing my body isn't ad important to me as being healthy and active, I want to be active. I want to lose fat and be more active. Most of the be more active things I want to do call for moneys and that is yet again something I am short on. Right now I am only up for short slowish walks and I don't think a lot of yoga would be great though some of it might. If I had a VCR I would be right in line for Tai chi chuan I need to see if I can find that series on DVD. But my living room is full of stuff yet again making space for anything an issue. 

Talking to Tyrnan tends to be very insightful, mostly uplifting. He sees that some of the things I fear are actually being really good at something and that the being good at it will probably entail leaving people behind in my life, And this is very true. This is something I have seen in myself for a long time now. He also sees that I am very hard on myself, not that this one is hard to see at all. He sees that I am capable of Much more then I do and he pushes me at times. 

Brian really has been a Great friend since I got back. He really is the brother I never had, the family I always wanted. He does the lifting and carrying I can't right now. He is doing the litter boxes, even though I usually have to remind him of it. I've started doing the dishes again because it is about the one chore around here other than cooking I can do. Derwin was grumpy today because I made him unload the dish-drainer three times. Poor baby. 

Derwin has been forgetting to take his evening medication but he is remembering to brush his teeth morning and night... I don't know about him. Without a me he would be lost I think. Am I a good person solely because I take care of my brother at the expense of living a different, possibly my own life? Or would I be a good person anyway? I choose to take care of him because I love him and I promised that I would. I think if he treated me badly I would be able to walk away from the promise and find some other way that was good for us both, but he lives and cares in his own way. If he sees me wince in pain he asks after my healing. When I am tired he asks if I am okay. He is not uncaring he is simply different caring when it comes to showing it and seeing it I think. 

My roses look like hell. My yellow roses came back thankfully. Brian was sure they were dead. I NEED to get out there and cut them back this equinox. Also feeding them would be a good thing now. There is so much that needs doing. I want to put a boarder around the planting area around the porch. It's bought, last summer in fact, and yet still not in. I want to garden, and yet still I have not. Brian is going to put in the raised bed that was his bed-frame... Just as soon as he levels the area for it. We need to resurface the back porch and the grill really should be replaced. I would like the one that also has a smoker, cause smoked beef steak is oh so tasty. I would like to cover the back porch too. I would love to put a shed in the back yard and turn that server cabinet into a solar dehydrator. It all seems like big things but with the right skills and some money it could all be so simple. 

I'm reading more, though I am still finding myself stuck on Facebook and other Internet haunts for a good portion of my day. I need to set limits with myself for this. Like only when Brian is home and on the net but then there will be no hope of doing non-Internet stuff with him ever. I would rather throw darts than scan fb again but he would rather play darts with the friends he leaves the house to visit and play on the Internet at home. Grr, rehashing old gripes. 

I would like to get into archery as well as throwing knives and axes. I would like to go to paintball park with the friends. I would like to learn lampworking. I would like to learn chain mail jewelry making, as well as armor. I wish people wanted to buy what I want to make. I wish that I had the time and money for everything I wanted.

As I was going to sleep last night it occurred to me that if my mom sang me lullabies I don't know what they were. And I'm not sure why that matters enough to cross my mind and stick with me but it did. 

Today has been a really good day. Brian worked on my display for my barefoot sandals and did the dishes. I made it to the stitch n bitch, drove and everything, with Amanda. It had been so long since we had gotten together that we all had stuff to talk about and share. 

I bought ""The inner temple of witchcraft"" by Christopher Penczak at Powell's then coffee and munchies at Starbucks. Then I received two books from Diana that she was unable to sell at Powell's. I got some stitching for Faireworlds done at the SnB. After we had dinner at the Horse Brass Pub, which I now know the name AND location for, in SE Portland with Amanda and another lively conversation before heading home. 

I've been hanging out with Brian listening to old Hip-Hop songs this evening and surfing FaceBook and a bit more stitching since I got home. 

0303 on the 16th
Wow, I just had a blast from my past. One of the last guys I really hung out with back in Oklahoma great friend just got back in touch with me via FaceBook. I knew him as Brian, he goes by Scott now.

I was happy and nervous giving him my phone number. I like to think I haven't changed much, maybe become more Me, and people thought well of me but realities can be vastly different then memory as I have found often. I even cried a little. 

Seems I am just the way he remembers me. Quick sharp wit and stubborn. Two of the first things most people learn about me. We hold a lot of the same views and positions just from different positions. He has a son and seems to be a great dad. His growing up is not as I remembered but families tend to hide abuse knowing he was beat then kicked out just pisses me off. I thought better of them. He has made his peace with it and is well out of it so it's the past. Sounds like he has a decent life. We spent at least two hours talking, well I think he did at least three quarters of the talking, which is pretty normal for me too. 

Why do I always feel like I am not living up to my life?

I revived the biggest of my medical bills today so it seems like a good time for a run down of them. In approximate order I received them. 

Anesthesiologist $2,441.59
ER visit 6/20. $1,853.05
Ultrasounds+
Thoracentesis $1,141.00
ER visit 6/22, 
Hospital stay+ 
surgery $58,365.45
TOTAL= $63,801.09

I have no insurance to cover any of the cost but I am strangle calm. The worst part is over, I'm alive and the money will work it's self out with some work. I'm alive, that's the important part. 

I decided to test myself driving running small errands today before I attempted driving across town tomorrow. I'm more sore this evening than last, I'm stronghold that to being active and to deciding to go shopping on the fly and winding up probably lifting bags heavier than 10 pounds. Oops. 

Actually right now I am sore and tired and going to head to bed, right after a hot shower.Good night y'all, safe travels. 

0200
Amanda came for a visit to figure out where she and I stand money wise, revive money and talk business mostly. I took her buy Wal-Mart on the way home walked through with her but couldn't stand in line, I was too sore. 

Sitting in the car is when I opened the latest bill. I handed it to Amanda when she got out and I think she was a little shocked, which was mirrored by Brian when I showed him when I arrived home. I am hopeful the financial aide people will see the truth of my situation and help me out. I still have not revived my bill for the follow-up appointment and who knows what other bills await me. But I am staying positive that it will work out. 

Im trying to stay awake as I airdry before putting my nightgown and belly band on and getting to sleep. Good night again.

Yesterday was uneventful. I watched Borjia while tucking crochet tails in my barefoot sandals that are being sent with Amanda to Faireworlds. I hope that we do well this year and go again next year. Brian brought my other bins down for me and I realized that with the ten pound lifting limit just to get to the things to price I will need to wait until he is home. 

Today I decided to go without my belly band, at least for a while.

I went to bed earlier than I have been. I was just so tired. I had an early and than busy day with Brian. 

First I had a follow up appointment at NARA with my primary doctor. He was blown away. He knew it wasn't appendicitis because of a text he did that I know the ER doctor did, but on the 22nd I think all the other signs were so well presented they were willing to overlook that one not being present. 

He told Ruthann who has been my primary for a long time and heads the diabetes program I'm in. She came in and was just as amazed. She put together my minor kind of obtuse abdominal complaint from May 17th with this new development. She was concerned and very kind. 

Robert, my new primary doctor, gave me a prescription for Flonase and assured me that it and Liratadine would not conflict with anything the gyn/oncology gave me. My gyn/oncology doctor's name is Moffit. I like her, she is straight forward but caring. I like that in people. Robert is like that with a good sense of humor and laugh as well. 

Brian decided to stay home yesterday because he had a headache that would nit go away. I went with him to Home Depot for a pipe snake for the septic drain we found is clogged going from the house to the tank. What lead me to find the septic problem was really the water from the house coming up through the vent pipe instead of going to the septic tank. Brian never checked the under the porch part if what I said he just assumed I meant the concreat cover at the end of the porch I think. Anyway, today he's supposed to try and snake the drain from the cent to the tank.

Then we went to Fred Meyer to get some bins to send my business stuff to Faireworlds with Amanda. I am keeping them all the sane color for connivence sake. Brian reminded me that he owed me for the snap-tight storage containers he took doughnuts back to Oklahoma in but decided to leave there. I found a grill for making cake-pops and traded that debt for it instead. I really like those pops and will enjoy making them at home. 

Brian contacted a guy on Craig's list about a laptop and we wound up in bothered Portland. Nobb Hill area to pick it up. It seems to be a great system and later Brian swapped out their 75g drive for his new 750g and it worked perfectly after doing a few updates. He is very happy with it.

We decided to grab lunch in the area over on Nw 23rd. We stopped at a place called Besaw's. They had some of the best Mac-n-cheese I've ever had with spinach and roasted garlic as an add in. 

We got home and played on the computer the rest of the evening. I read more of my friend (LJ-user=memoryanddreams) page on her hysterectomy and struggle with treatment last year. I'm just blown away by the hoops and bullshit they put her through for treatment. Our stories are so similar and yet so different it is mind boggling. I wish I had been around more for her.

I went to bed early.

I realized, well a long time ago, but two months ago or so that a lot of my personal identity was wrapped up in my sexuality. A sexuality I hadn't felt comfortable pursuing for quite some time. Last night, two nights ago, I started wondering what this new turn in my life meant for that identity.

In the last two days I've seen most of my closest friends. Visiting around is turning out kind of painful, but the exercise and socialization is good for me and for Brian and we've had a good time. 

Just got back from Amanda and Damon's place. He made good taco soup and we played some cards then some Rummicube. My abdomen really doesn't like the leaning forward that entails. Hopefully getting the staples out tomorrow will help with some of that.

Tomorrow is my two week-ish (it's one day early) check up from the surgery. I'm nervous about getting the staples removed because of how vulnerable I felt after they took the tape off my incision site even though there was no logical reason for me to feel that way. 

I'm still not sure what I should ask the doctor if anything. The incision site looks huge for what they can supposedly do with micro-surgery these days but then I remember that they had to remove a 12"" tumor and all my reproductive organs and it seems more reasonable.

One of the hardest things for me is to sit back and let others do for me or do the things I an supposed to be doing, or simply have taken on. Asking for help with something I can usually manage is the worst, but just needing to ask at all gets me. I'm so used to people not doing what I ask or leaving it for ""later"" or some such that I immediately figure if I hand something off to another it will not get done. Brian has been picking up the slack like he did last winter when I hurt my back, and he's been good about it. I have to remind him about the litter boxes but e does them. 

You would think that I would have gotten more reading and crochet done but frankly I haven't until the last few days. Some of that might have been the fog of the pain meds the first several days but I think a bit of it is me wrapping my brain around it all. 

What should I do with my life? 

What do I do that justifies my existence in this world?

June was a hell of a month for me. I went in expecting to have a fun birthday and not much else. Brian was going on a long vacation back home to Oklahoma and I would have the house mostly to myself.

Brian left on the ninth and I was pretty sick, had been for about a week but I thought it was just allergies. Went to the clinic with trouble breathing, a painful abdomen and not keeping any food down for two days. There I met a new awesome doctor Dr. Robert on the twelfth. He didn't know what exactly was wrong but put he through texts and decided it was a bladder infection and something else. I was sent for x-rays of my abdomen. He also gave me back my daily asthma MID that a previous doctor had taken me off of for reasons I never understood. 

The next day he said I had pneumonia and a bladder infection and assumed the other stomach problems were due to the first two. He changed my antibiotics and I made an appointment for Friday the 15th for a follow up. He also sent me for a chest c-ray to confirm diagnosis.

On friday I told him I was much improved but my gut was still off. He prescribed that I see the dietitian and walk thirty minutes everyday.

I did pretty good with the walking for a couple of days then the prednazone and antibiotics were finished and I felt progressively worse. On the twentieth I went to the ER because Dr. Robert had made me promise that if I spiked high temps again I would, so when I did I did. 

I was spiking a 102.3 temp when I went in to the OHSU ER. I I had been waking to soaked sheets all week and weekend. Not fun. I also presented with shortness and hard time breathing and abdominal pain. They looked me over and decided yay it was my asthma acting up really badly and gave me a duo neb (albuteral and ipatropiam bromide) which helped my breathing. They took chest x-rays and blood work and found nothing wrong with me they could test for or see. So they sent me home with it being worsening asthma and when I asked about my gut pain they said that it must be a reaction to the antibiotics and to take proibotics. So I drove myself home and did what I was told until Friday.

Friday I was on the phone with Tyrnan and took him to the bathroom with me. The pain became excruciating, 1-10 scale I learned what 10 felt like. Doing energy work Tyrnan tried to take some of my pain so I could stand and leave the bathroom but even with that it took me thirty minutes just to stand leaning against the sink. I got off the phone with him. 

From there I finally made it to the livingroom. I sat here trying to decide if I should see if Damon could take me to the ER after work or if I should call an ambulance since I wasn't sure I would be able to make it to the car. I also had the, to me, problem that I had promised Kat and Taylor that I would care for their cats for one more night. I asked Amanda if she would feed them for me and Damon if he would drive us by to do so and they both agreed. Kat and Taylor both say I should have called they could have come home early or something. 

Did I ever mention that I'm stubborn and only break promises when HAVE to?

Damon stayed with me and Amanda until he had to go hone and get food and sleep for the next day at work. Which was nice of him and imprecise since he hates hospitals. Amanda canceled her shift and work and stayed with me for the first two days of what was to come. She really stepped up for me in ways I had not expected but was so happy to see. When she said I was her best friend she really did mean it. I spent at least three hours in the waiting room. Remember folks Friday and Saturday nights are the business in an ER so unless you are in danger of dying immediately expect to wait. 

My pain was on my right lower abdomen so we were all thinking appendicitis, even the examining doctors. The triage nurse explained that appendicitis can flair up and go away a few times before they catch it. Fun! Is all I thought about that. Makes sense though really, sucky sense but sense.

They sent me off for a Kat scan to confirm. I revived Daluden and contrast dye at this point. The Daluden worked quickly and effectively and still when moving I was feeling pain. For the record there were no cats involved and I feel jiped! Just kidding, about feeling jiped that is. 

When they came back to tell us the results from the scan I had a complaint new team of doctors and nurses. Seems the scan showed them something completely unexpected and it was a really good thing Amanda stayed because I was in no state to ask questions for myself and I was so scared. She held my hand a lot, between my suddenly zoning out and snorting at her of course. -chuckles- 

The new team was a gynecological oncology team. To simplify this, they found a tumor on my right ovary and I would need surgery as soon as possible. Since I don't have insurance they doctor was worried I would get lost in the system if I were sent home so she did everything in her power to see that I was admitted that night/morning. I saw my surgeon/doctor when they moved me to the ER observation room to wait for a bed. The daulden continued until I was in the room on the 13th floor, room 1 of the Kholer pavilion when they switched me to oxycodone. 

I was taken for a few tests. An ultrasound to get a better look at what they were dealing with. The tumor was twelve inches across. A thorasentesis, where they drain the fluid from around my lung, they got almost a liter of fluid that looked like a medium brown beer. An EKG, to check out my heart I supposed. And of course blood work... Lots of blood work.

During this weekend I did a lot of thinking. See the doctor said that they could try and save my fertility. If they went in and found the tumor was cancerous they could look my other ovary and my uterus over and keep them if they looked unaffected. This kind of appealed to me because I have always wanted kids and thought I would be a great mom but then I thought of what would happen to Derwin if I did that and the cancer came back. I told the doctor that if it is cancer to do what was most likely to be successful and take everything. 

They were just working out a way to send me home with a scheduled surgery on Friday the 29th, when an opening occurred in her schedule allowing the operation to suddenly go through on Tuesday. I went into surgery with out having the chance to explain anything to Derwin or tell him how much i loved him or anything. I felt very bad for that. The doctor brought in an interpreter and explained things to him after the surgery and before i got to see him. When I did see him I think the sight of me terrified him. I must have looked a sight. I was not fully out of the anesteia yet and in lots of pain. 

When I came out I was on morphine and frankly I didn't care for it. I could give myself a burst every ten minutes but if I fell asleep I got behind and woke in lots of pain. Wednesday they got menace on oxycodone and over the next few days found that 15mg every four hours with a back up of ibuprofen and Tylenol seemed to be what it took to keep me mostly pain free. they wanted me up walking asap and I couldn't go home until I passed gas or had a bowel movement. I was so happy when I farted for the first time! You have no idea.

Around Wednesday I started feeling like I was going to fall out my room window and started enjoying when the curtains would get closed at night. I found out that the building's ability to shift in an earthquake translates to it shifting in high winds as well and that this was effecting me on several levels. This i think was triggering my motion sickness on a very tiny level that was hard to decern.

I came home on June thirtieth, the day before Brian was to fly back in to town. 

All throughout this Amanda, Kat and Taylor were taking good care of me, Derwin and the cats. Amanda staying up at the hospital when she could and asking questions I couldn't think of through the pain meds. Kat and Taylor making sure Derwin ate real food for dinner and feeding the cats and cleaning the litter boxes as well as visiting each day and then bringing Derwin up to see me.

1724
My fear of falling/heights seems to have come back with a vengeance, or maybe it's my fear of being out if control that is rearing it's head. Driving up to get my prescription refill of oxycodone from the Kohler pavilion at OHSU on The Hill had my heart doing all sorts of gymnastics trying to get out of my chest as Brian drove me up Terwiliger's windy high curves to get there. :( Mind you Brian is a good driver, taught me everything I know about driving, so it's not his driving that bothers me.

I had a good low key day today. I worked on my first dragon scale scarf. It's coming along but now I'm thinking maybe I should take it apart and make barefoot sandals out of the yarn instead. That's much more likely to sell at Faireworlds this summer. I have about three hours of stitching done and I think I'm getting better at the pattern. What do you guys think? (Not that I think anybody is still around reading my entries. At least no one who's going to respond.)

Amanda told me ad I was walking out the door to go get her that she had a headache and would be staying home. I think what irritate me is that she waits till I'm probably on the road to her house before she tells me these things. I really shouldn't let it bother me. She missed game night with the kids though, her loss.

When I arrayed Taylor gave me a book he thought I would benefit from ""The fire starter sessions"" by Danielle Laporte. Flipping through the pages it's set up interestingly. Part of the blurb on the back caught my eye ""Life balance is a myth, and the pursuit of it is causing us more stress than the craving for balance itself."" I pointed out that it was the first thing that struck me but I'm sure I bungled it when I spoke further. I personally believe in the pursuit of balance and that finding balance hints on finding out what idle truly important to you. I think most of us especially in our first attempts towards balance try to balance everything we currently have on our plates. We soon realize, or not, that we must declutter our lives before we can did balance in them. I find that simplification is a first step in finding balance. But that could just be me. I know I didn't say anything as cleaver on well thought out as the above earlier though. 
<b>Edit 4-25-2012:1730</b>
{Also, and I think this is what I said, ""is that people tend to overcompensate and overbalance themselves"". Which is not to say they create too much balance but that they try to do too much of what they have been neglecting at once and thus and thus tip themselves off balance in the other direction or give up out of frustration.}

I had a good time playing games, especially after Kelson's went to bed. I don't nessecerily think it's his fault but he can tire a person. I got to play Othello again with Taylor this time and it was fun. He's good at the game. I headed out a bit earlier than usual he looked like he wanted to do some reading and I felt a headache coming on. 

I went for a little drive around the area and then home. I chatted with Joann some trading her a lemon Marionberry muffin for a roastbeef and cheeder sandwich. I worked on my scarf, which I might be taking apart, while watching Every Day. The little boy in that movie has the best smile every. I decided to come ip and maybe read some before bed buy I think journaling and than meditation might be my best course instead."

It strikes me that while I have not done it often I have always been drawn to bread and baking. And listening to a TED talk on Netflix it occurred to me that bread making is alchemy.

I just heard what must have been an entire flock of geese fly over my house. They sounded joyous, like they were having a good time of it. 

0252 on the 24th
I finished five barefoot sandals out of the silver sparkle Vanna yarn. Once I got the hang of the crocodile stitch it went very quickly. Having figured out the triangle scale pattern the rectangular scarf is proving easier to figure out. (Providing I don't skip half a V stitch.) The hot pink cotton fingerling yarn I traded Diana a amulet pooch for is proving a bitch to do this stitch with and after two more rows tomorrow, I got my first row done moments ago, I might scrap it's use for this and use it for something with a simpler stitch that will showcase the variegation in the yarn width. Maybe a thin scarf with a bigger hook. For this it's proving quite annoying.

For now I'm tired. I watched 23 TED talk episodes. Great interesting stuff, but I am talk and crafted out for the evening. Off to bed for me.

I think I tend to push myself harder than I really need to. I think I demand more of myself sometimes than I should. I can be completely ungrateful of what I have accomplished. I can be completely uncaring that I have done a splendid job by anyone's sane standards. 

At times, most times, I think I expect instant results from things, especially magical things. An expecting that is unrealistic on any terms. I have realized that I read more books than three quarters of my my closest friends, and still I find myself berating myself for not having read more.

Playing Small
There will never be an ""us""
if I play small.

-SHARON PRE I S S

In Dante's Divine Comedy, the only difference between the lovers who find themselves enduring Hell and the lovers working their way through Paradise is that those in Hell have no individual center, and so they spin in endless identification with each other.

Hard as it is, we cannot shrink from our relationships or we simply become an audience or gofer for the dominant partner or friend. Like most of us, I have struggled with this my whole life: fearful of what might happen if I actually voice my concerns and needs, surprised that doing so-while not always easy or pleasant-always enables me to be myself more fully.

Then, not by chance, I'm always more able to feel and see the world around me. I bring more to the scene and am revitalized more readily by my daily experience.

The great philosopher Martin Buber, who believed that God is most deeply known through relationship, spoke to the heart of this paradox. He said that before there can be a true relationship, there must be two separate beings who can relate. Most of our life experience bears this out. Unless we work to be ourselves, we can never truly know others or the numinous world we live in.

- As you breathe, do not disappear.

- Sit quietly, and as you inhale, realize that the expansion of your spirit is what knows the world.

- During your day, when feeling small, inhale slowly and present yourself again to all that is around you.

Today is a beautiful day. Brian has bible study with Mike and I decided to stay out for awhile. I dropped off books that were due at the library and then drove around listing to Abney Park enjoying a nice long drive around the southeast Portland/ Sellwood area. 

I finally decided to stop at the tiny park on Flavel to read and maybe crochet. I keep coming up with dragon-scale design adaptation ideas that I really should illustrate. I need to learn the stitch before I can create them but I know they are good ideals.

I opened this to say that I have really always loved spiral staircases. I think they would be great in a home.

It's lovely out. I cane home from the park after reading to work in the yard before the magical meet-up. I cleared a yard debris bin of blackberry vies from the side of the house. There is probably four bins full still to go. After that is cleared I have rose bushes to prune as well. It was good physical labor strenuous, which tells me I'm way out of shape. 

Brian is cleaning up the garage and it looks like e is getting rid of a bunch of stuff. The entire neighborhood is trimming lawns and playing and sitting out enjoying te afternoon warmth. I pulled out my crochet to work on some dragon-scale footless sandals to try and get the pattern down. I think they might sell well at Faireworlds as well. I will work on thicker stuff for the fall and winter venues.

I find it really interesting that Brian insisted on setting up storage for my bike in the garage in a way that I cant hope to use without his assistance. The last bike was hung from the ceiling and I could barely reach it let alone get it down to use. This was not courtly allure crap in the way of me doing so even if I were able. The new bike was to heavy and awkward for even Brian to put on the ceiling. So he was thinkig of another alway and one f us suggested that we put it one the wall. So he's doing that and hasn't even asked me if I think I can do it.

Thinking on it I believe I was the one who digested the wall hook which would explain why he never asked. Once done he did ask if I could get it down and back up and I could with some finagling. The hook wants to turn and that will probably be a problem in te long run.

Time to cook my side dish and get going to the meet-up. Amanda just texted and asked for a ride to the gathering and frankly I thought that was a given. Nice of her to ask instead of assume though.

Brian seems in a less than pleased. Maybe grumpy would be the way to put it. After Mike left he started working on the garage which has needed a deep cleaning for a long time now. The garage and his bedroom are the only things i insist he clean since they are his rooms. Derwin walked out and said it was a beautiful day and Brian bit his head off about himself working not playing. I don't think Derwin noticed and I just shooed him back inside and ignored Brian's grumping. I'm getting better at that. Not all of his moods have anything to do with me and until he brings a grievance to me I should act like it's not my duck unless I know I commuted an offense. Besides his bring grumpy about spending his beautiful day cleaning is his fault, I did not tell him that he had to clean it this weekend, he chose to do it.

1114 on the 22nd
I cooked green-beans squires with onions and garlic for my side to take to the magical meet-up and it turned out well. I'm trying to broaden my repotuar of side dishes and it's nice to discover that it's working well.

In telling another group of people about my magical background I find it changes slightly each time. I think partly it's due to self understanding and self editing. Figuring out which part of my story is relevant to my telling. It's all true, even the stuff I tell no one about. Because there are things I almost don't believe but I know I experienced. Though if there were a group of people to understand and believe this would be them. I love the fact the it's such a diverse group. In one gathering we can touch on a multitude of topics, sometimes it sends my head reaping trying to keep up, but I love it.

Last nights experiment and presentation were well timed and left me exhausted and exhilarated. I needed some alone time to process and get it down. Then Kat gifted me her finger labyrinth which is a large two foot wide eleven circuit green labyrinth. It was moving and means a lot to me. I have looking at getting one but as with so many magical tools I've looked at price has been a major factor. It will help me greatly with my magical/labyrinth studies. 

I took Amanda home, deciding not to visit more at her place I needed to go home an process the evenings events. When I arrived home Brian was getting out of the bath and took me back down to see what he had accomplished in the garage. It look(ed-s) so much better. I saw like five boxes worth of stuff stacked at the back and sitting along the side of the driveway. Very well done. He wants Amanda to check out the bike in the garage that Willie left and see if she likes it. It would cost less than a new bike to fix and he offered to do the work.

After applying aloe to my arms and chest, I burnt myself pretty good sitting reading in the sun yesterday, and writing in my magical journal I decided the best course was to get some sleep. I was so tired. I laid down and got back up wide awake twice. Finally I just stayed up reading ""A Spiral Staircase"" until around four in the morning. I grabbed an apple and a cheese stick munched and awhile later got some sleep. 

I kept waking up but when I finally got out of bed around nine-thirty I was well rested.

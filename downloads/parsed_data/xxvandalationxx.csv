"event","I don't really know what to say. I don't even know how to name the feelings in correct words that I am feeling. I am so torn. I still love you. And no matter what I always will. It's crazy to be so open about how I feel about someone and feel on top of the world and then five minutes later I get hurt and I feel like I have to throw those walls up and run away again. But how can I runaway from you? You are my best friend. I can't act like I don't care and secretly let it eat away at me inside when you know me better than that. I feel so many emotions right now. Guilt, stupidity, love, sadness, lonely, longing, sorrow, I am still happy to know how you feel. And I know what you said to me was true, I know your feelings are true. I have no doubt in this world that you would never lie to me or intentionally hurt me. If you were someone else I wouldn't waste another moment thinking about you, I would move on. I would take those feelings and throw it out of my mind as easily as if it were trash. But you? You make it so much more difficult. I feel like God made you for me. Or since you came first maybe I was made for you. I have always considered myself as a huge puzzle that no one can ever figure out or finish. But not only can you figure it out, but you are like the final piece. I know that one day this will all be cleared up, and I know that you love me, and God knows there aren't words to express how much I love you. But I understand that those feelings must go back into secrecy. I understand that though you love me you aren't ready to be with me and that really hurts. But as your best friend I understand where you are coming from, and as the girl that loves you I would rather have all of you than the you that isn't ready and only giving half your heart. So I will just sit here and wait. You call it loyalty, but all it is is me being loyal to my heart. If I didn't really love you I would have been with someone else, but after all this time now that I know how you feel about me, I don't want any other man but you. So I'll suffer, I'll dream about you every night, I'll think about you every morning, everytime something small reminds me of you I will smile, I will just be patient. My love for you will last forevor, but our time may not. Just know that...."

"event","Now that Jasons relationship is over I am smothering him and I feel horrible for it. I think from now on I will back off and be his friend from a distance. I love himm but I am incredibly scared. I'm in love with that boy. I would do anything for him. I just wish I could just tell him just how much I love him and portray all of my emotions fully to him. But there are just no words. There is nothing that I can do or say to portray that to him. I love him more than he will ever know and I will never be able to get him to understand that. I just don't know what to do. I mean I know now isn't the best time to tell him how I feel. He is really hurt and I know just how much he really cared about this girl. So I will try to be there for him in anyway that I can because he is my best friend and I know he would do it for me. But I also do it because I love him and it hurts me to see him hurt. I just wanna be there for him. I know it sounds cheesey but I just want to take care of him, I want to be there in so many more ways. I want to be able to be his everything. I know that this is not a crush, I know this is so much more. I have been in love with everything about him since I was 15 years old. And crushes don't last for 4 years. I just wish things weren't so complicated. I just wish we could be together. I wish I could hold him, I wish I could kiss him, I wish I could just look into his eyes and not feel guilty about wanting to tell him that I love him. I wish that I could just be honest and open about my emotions for him with him. But I can't. I just don't know what the fuck to do. I have been waiting for this moment where the both of us are single and on the same page for 4 years. And now that I have an idea of how he feels......I am just at a lost to let him go and find someone else. I know he lives in Tampa, but I would make that sacrifice to be with him. I would make that transition to be with the love of my life. Everyone has one true love, and I honestly believe his is mine and that this is fate. I feel like such a dork saying and admitting all of this. But I am serious. I believe this to the fullest. I would marry this boy tomorrow and never think twice about it. Being with him would make life so simple. Every hard thing that came along I would just take it in stride and deal with it because at the end of the day I know I'm going home to him. And I would want him to feel the same. Our life would be so perfect. Every single morning I would wake up early just to make us breakfast so we could sit and eat together. Then we would split and go to our daily rituals of work and then I would come home early and make us dinner. And then we would go out for the evening and engage in a dorky experience, like playing miniature golf, or going bowling, I would pretend to let him win but in actuality I would just really suck at it. Then we would go home and lay in bed cuddling and talking all night until we fell asleep. If my everyday was like that I could die a happy camper.  I just wish I knew it was the same for him...."

"event","This morning my mom and I got into a huge argument. Everyday she tells me how she wants me and my sister to move out. Then when the day comes for it to actually happen she freaks. I told her I was going to start saving. I may not be able to move out until summer but I will at least have enough money to do so responsibly. Anyways it's really frustrating, she says one thing and then does something completely different. Before it was ""if you move out I'll pay your rent and buy you a condo."" Now it's ""if you move out I'm not going to help you at all and I'm gonna be a bitch and make it even harder on you by making you pay your own car insurance."" I don't understand her. I don't understand my families logic at all. I just want my own space. I want to come home and not have my bed be broken. I just want privacy......and time alone, and that is something I never get at my house. It's become so ridiculous that I am sick to death of my entire family. And it's obvious that this just isn't going to happen unless I move out and do it completely on my own........so I guess it's time to start saving for my trip to Europe along with my new studio apartment since mom and dad aren't going to help me, but that's fine I'll just do it on my own."

"event","1. I really like Mike alot.
2. I miss Jason.
3. I'm feeling sick.
4. I go to ARC and SCC now
5. Valentines Day sucks and is a commercial holiday (but that still doesn't stop me from wanting a Valentine)
6. Cheating is bad, and it happens. Most people are in denial about it. No one is cheating on me because I am in a friendship not a relationship. But if I were in this predicament I would definately be questionable. I think that people at times get a little to comfortable pushing the individual rather than the relationship while both are equally important. But at times I think that a persons emotions blind them to the possibility that someone could run away with their heart just to kill it. ( this isme being a pessismist again)
7. A little pain never hurt anyone, but it can kill you if you let it.
8. The 70's were great except for the clothes.
9. I want to learn how to break dance........still.
10.The people at the Mexican place never give me my fries.
11.Fate is real, real fucked up.
12. Sometimes I wonder just what the future holds in store for me. After a long conversation with Jen the other night I realized that I don't ever want to date another person that I don't deem as marriage material. Isn't that crazy? That at 19 years old I am looking for marriage material. To be honest I think it is just an excuse to torture myself. It is just an excuse for me to turn people down and to push people away. Don't get me wrong I want to be married and I want to have a family and every single day my body drops hints that it is ready to carry that torch, but I am too afraid of getting hurt again. So rather than give people chances I let them get so close and then I close up like a shell the second I feel the slightest form of rejection. I know that's not healthy, I know I need to work on that.......but honestly......I don't know if it worth it.
13. A part of me knows that I am bound to end up as an old lady with tons of cats, which sucks because I am allergic to cats. 
14. I often think that none of my friends would be there for me if I really needed them and look at myself often as a loner. 
15. I don't think anyone understands me. 
16. I am truly much more emotional than I appear to be. 
17. I am not as strong as I appear to be, there are honestly few things in this world that keep me going........and I will never tell anyone what they are out of fear that they will take them away. But in the end if someone tries to take these things away then I will kill because they are 100% worth fighting for.....
18. My sister is here and I really don't want to see or talk to her. She is really really annoying
19. I am the most responsible and logical person in my parents house. 
20. Jen and Brad are here and now I have to go."

"event","..so this weekend was cool. On friday I went to work all day, did practically nothing since no one was there. But I got trained on the scanning project which was at least something new. After work I came home and changed and headed to get melissa. After that we headed back to megans house and waited for her doyle and spike to get there. While we were talking I saw an animal fall down the hill and I was like ""Dude Melissa WTF is that?"" And this bitch says ""coyote"" and if that wasn't bad enough her dumb ass starts whistlin at it, trying to get it's attention and shit. I was like OMG this bitch is crazy. SO I hid behind the screen, if he was gonna eat somebody it better have been melissa. Then finally megan got there. We all hung out and talked and chilled. Then Eric came over and we made daquiris. After the drinks I took Melissa home and headed out. Then yesterday I woke up and made breakfast. Then I took a shower and helped the babys get ready to go to my cousins football game. Then I helped Cyndi get ready for her interview. By that time it was lunchtime so I made something to eat. I tried calling Jason a few times and couldn't get a hold of him and said fuck it! So I got up and got ready and drove out to the wedding. I had so much fun hanging out with him and his family. I usually feel so odd around a bunch of people I don't know but I felt 100% comfortable. And Jason is never in town so it was like extremely nice to see him and spend time with him even though it was only for so long. Anywho after a long night of drinking, eating, meeting people, and kicking jasons ass I headed back to my house and got de-divafied. I laid down and I was OUT! I woke up this morning to my bitcchass cousin drinking upall my rockstars. I was pissed. Anywho I took a shower and got dress, said by to Jason and headed out to pieces with melissa. We had a nice girly lunch and then I took her home and headed back. My cousins washed my car which was nice, I painted Faithe's nails, talked to my mom about spring break, cleaned my room, and right now my sister and I are trying to decide what to make for dinner. I am making strawberry and banana cupcakes. But that is it so far. LoL Anywho gotta go find some recipes and study for poli sci. Holla at this bitch........"

"event","....I am starting to get to that lonely rejection stage in my mind now. It was alright in the beginning when I didn't recognize it. But every single day it becomes even stronger and more apparent that I have lost something and that I am alone. It's so much more difficult. Being around a crowd and feeling like you are still alone. Or being in a relationship where you feel you are alone. There is so much to feel and yet nothing to ground me or to hold onto at all. It seems like everytime I have something to look forward to I turn around and it's completely changed or gone. I don't understand why it's like that. I don't understand why things always have to be so fucking complicated. All I want in life is to never worry about money, to never worry about a place to live. Sometimes I wish I could just lock myself away from the rest of the world and be completely confined. It just seems like there is so much stress, so much pressure, so much loneliness out there. So much that I can't let myself experience. So much that I never want to. I always tell myself I am over it, but I guess it's just my mind playing tricks on me."

"event","Last night I had the craziest dream ever! Because everyone was telling me to be nice and hang out with Megan again I did. And she said that we should go to her Apt with her and her bf, so we get to this street and the car breaks down. She says it always happens right there and that we had to walk to the house by foot. So we walk through this hollow with all these trees and we get to this huge dark old mansion. It's like a huge estate and the second we step foot on the grass I start getting an icy cold feeling. Then Megan looks at me and says 1-2-3 GO! And she just starts running as fast as she can towards the house and out of fear I followed her. As we started to run, white, silvery, milky spirits started to come out of the hollow that we had just came through, there were hundreds of them flying around us. We finally got inside and we were safe. I asked her what that was all about and she acted like it was nothing. I asked her boyfriend and he smiled and kept walking. The house was old inside and has old victorian furniture everywhere. It even had one of those fancy classic fireplaces. The thing that was even more interesting was that there were other people living there. I suppose her and her boyfriend were just renting a room. Anyhow they showed me to the guest room. I said I wouldn't be spending the night, they said there was no choice and I had to, I had no way home and I wasn't about to walk through that grass or hollow again, especially not alone. So I laid in the bed but couldn't sleep. The house made all these strange noises, and the paintings actually stared at you. In my room I could see the shadows moving as if they were people. So then I woke up and ran out of my room, I had decided that I wasn't going to stay there, and when I went to leave this old black man in an old suit with grey hair stopped me. As he stopped me the front doors had opened and it was morning, as the doors opened I saw these huge dogs, pitbulls, with bodies resembling pigs. I asked him an important question..........and he answered..........but I fear that I do no remember either the question or answer."

But I suppose that it's best to focus on the time being, the job at hand, spending time. I just wish it wasn't like this. God I hope that I can get into a school down there.

But in Order of the Phoenix they killed off my favorite character and in Half Blood they killed off my other. I think the fact that I am turning Carlos around and getting him to watch and read a bit more about it is taking me out of my normal Harry Potter drug addiction. In my attempt to find new movie clips from ""goblet"" I started to think to myself and I realized that Harry Potter is a huge part of Popular culture, along with Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, they are all EPIC. Something that will be in history books because of how many people it effected or how many people paid how much money to read and see it. I decided that I am going to make myself an epidemic.

Except for the inevitable coverage flaws which will be placed on me but I refuse to get in trouble over something I didn't do so that won't be too much of a problem since it isn't my fault. Lately I have been thinking about applying to Long Beach State. It' still in So Cal. It's a State University, and it's got a really good art program. I dunno if I'm smart enough to get into a real school. But they do accept portfolios and what not so I guess right now it is time to bust out the jar of creativity. And I think that is exactly what I will start doing with my days off when school starts. Just create. It's decided I will apply to three schools next semester since my parents refuse to have me go to Arts school. UCLA (like I'll ever get in there), UCR, and Long Beach State. It never hurts to try right? And I am thinking also that I will add another class this semester as well as next. That way I'll be able to transfer sooner and if I wanna take a summer school class I can do it second semester or first and then take a month off to travel. I definately wanna visit Carlos again, but this time I wanna spend like a week. And I kinda really wanna go on the road trip with the girls to Oregon because I have never been there and it will be so much fun. But I also wanna spend a week in New York and a week in Florida. I haven't seen Jason in forevor and I have never been to Florida so I would really like to visit there too. I guess I gots alots on my plate right now but school is first."

It just feels like I am once again stuck, all alone and all by myself. I hate feeling like that. I hate how God always places me in the same cycle over and over again. I went through this in high school, twice. Then again after I graduated, and now it's happening all over again. And I hate how everyone says, ""If you got threw all of those things you'll get threw this."" It's like thanks but that doesn't change how things are now and there is nothing other than me hitting the lottery that will. I just wish that I wasn't always the last to do everything. It just makes me feel so slow, so stupid, so behind which I know I am not and all that does is leads to me being even more restless. My sister is coming home from her insurance schooling today. I am happy for her I truly am but I can't help feeling like have no accomplishments, I have accomplished nothing. At least nothing ""worth"" accomplishing. I think when she comes home I will be happy for her but I will just end up going to bed early and drowning myself in sleeping bliss. You know what is even worst about this whole thing, even my ditsy sister Erin is getting out of here. She is applying to Sonoma and Sac State. She will at least be moving out where ever she goes as long as she gets accepted. I am happy for her too. But I am more bitter about her going away to college than anything. My parents, the cheapest people in the world are willing to pay money to send her away but not me. Me who has known what I have wanted to since forevor, ne who has always gotten better grades, me the responsible one. But they send her because she is older and because she is majoring in something ""worthy"", nevermind the fact that she wasted a year of my parents money while not attending school and now I am only a year behind her. But my parents refuse to put any faith in me. They put it all in her."

It's 8:23 and I just spent the last 23 minutes listening to everyone on 7 talk about the old people that used to work here. There used to be a guy named Peter who worked here and they said that he would ride his bike to work everyday and then he would alternate his clothes between 4 different suites every other day and he would never wash them. Imagine. Someone who has ridden their bike from land park to down town sweating WITHOUT deodorant and then putting on a dirty suit and coming to work. They said that it would be so bad that everyone would plug their nose when they came in and when he wasn't in his office they would spray it. Then they told me about this intern kid who smelled too and he would always fall asleep. That was hilarious to me because they would light candles around him and literally spray his body . Then they said one day he went to lunch and just never came back. People are funny.

I am seriously considering getting my own place. But I don't think it will honestly do me any good. It's no longer just the everyday terror of my family but more so Sacramento in itself.

In SB it's just a piece scene. And if that means you wanna call them crusties or hippies or whatever then that's what you can call them. But they don't smell, their not dirty, they are just normal people. The thing is that they actually believe in something real. They aren't racist, they don't hurt people unless it's necessary, they actual have ideals, they actually want to make a change in life. Their whole existence isn't just monitored around one huge ego trip. The scene here at times seems like it's nothing more than that. I just get so sick of the drama. It's at home, it's with my friends. It's all over the place. I will be so glad when I get outta town for 4 days. It will be so nice to just truly have a vacation before school comes and all the madness starts again. But like I was saying I want to move out, but I am afraid I will be stuck in Sacramento for the rest of my life. I don't want to settle for a hick town masquerading as a big city. And as much as I hate being around my overbearing father and self absorbed sister I would rather stick it out for another year, put my dreams on hold, and then just get the hell out of dodge. 
From now on I am no longer hanging out with the regular crowd. I can be a better person than that. I will still see my usual friends and go to shows on occasion but I will no longer be a part of the drama. I am not a punk. Nor have I ever been. I have always simply just been myself. And if who I am and what my personality is like classifies me as that then so be it, but let it be known that I have never and will never be a chaos punk. I am spending more time with me and on me now. I have been blocked for too long and it's time to go into my garage and shelter myself from the rest of the world so that one day I can recreate it. It's time to reinvent my artistic identity."

I have to have someone to cover the phones for the smallest things. It's so irritating. Just now I finished the mail and Debbie comes right back up and brings me a whole new stack. I hate mail. I can't stand it. Especially on Mondays. None of it is ever for me. Oh Poo. I am just not in a good mood."

This weekend I promised Megan and Melissa I would go with them to trash til dawn and I have every intention of going.........but I wouldn't mind getting dressed up and having a girls evening until 11:30. I think it will be nice to look our best, dressing up is always fun. Maybe I'll bring my camera and we can take myspace photos. I will have to put the pressure on mom to reload the drivers so we can do our new myspace.

"event","I hate feeling like I have no control over the series of events and the outcome of what happens in my ilfe. I feel like to often do other people try to control me or make me feel bad about doing what I want to do or being who I want to be. At this point in time it feels like everyone is an enemy to me, no one has a mind of their own anymore, and I hate that. From now on my life revolves around me. I want to move so bad. I want to just get out of this place. I hate it here. I feel like every moment that I am alive and breathing this air that I am another moment away from death. There is nothing for me here anymore. So Cal has everything......love happiness, growth, spirituality, there is always so much going on at once and I love that. At least there I would have someone that truly loves me rather than the fake faces that lie about so here. I am just sick of the fonies. I want something more real. I want people that understand, I want people that are like me. All my life I have felt alone even when in a large crowd of people. Lately it's even worst. I talk to the people at my job more than the people in my family. My mom takes me to work and we say nothing at all in the car. The sad part is the silence is calming. My niece and nephew are bad and they don't know how to act, and I feel like talking to my sisters is a lost cause. Erin doesn't talk to me about anything but her camera and Cyndi has so many problems that I feel bad even bringing one of my own up. It's just so upsetting, having a million people around you at once and not being able to be yourself around anyone of them. Not being able to be happy, not being able to say what's on your mind. Something has pushed me back into the egg and I want to be broken. I want to be free, free to do what I want and free to be happy. I want to reembrace my creativity instead of having it choked out of my skull. I hate the world that I am in and I just desperately want an out........I don't feel beautiful anymore, nothing is beautiful anymore, there is no beauty."

"event","I have been realizing lately how invisible I am. And I have come to find out that that is actually in itself a really really good thing. I used to always be the token black girl and now since the novelty has worn off I can see who my real friends are and who could give a damn. Parts of me feel horrible because there are tons of people that I know feel the same about me....but the fact of the matter is that I love each and every one of my friends I just am too busy rushing at 1000 MPH to show them. I mean there are little things I do here and there, making cards and care packages, just emailing to say hi, keeping contact and showing I still care in so many little ways should be so comforting. The sad thing is I never receive it back. With some friends I care, with others I really don't. A part of me loves all of you, but a part of me would rather be alone. In this time I have found that loneliness is actually a good thing. You learn to be happy with yourself, and in my loneliness I create marvelous things. In my loneliness I am a better person and I learn many things about the world along with myself. Alone I stopped eating meat, and I have never been more healthy and more aware of what goes into my body, alone I started to spread my wings and travel and observe, alone I have discovered a large part of me. Thanks to the friends that I have that I do find fond and close to my heart I have learned to slow down while the rest of the world is going crazy. I have learned to calm myself and to take in all that is around me. With Carlos I had the best Sunday I have ever had and the funny thing was I didn't do anything. All we did was lay in th grass, eat, talk, listen to music, and buy art supplies. Isn't that something? That a person can have fun without spending a billion dollars and being fake. I love the person that he has helped me become. I have always been real, but now because of him I am raw and that is beautiful. I wonder sometimes if the rest of the world realizes how stupid they are. I mean if you honestly think about it money has no real value. And neither does gold. The only reason people care about it so much is because everyone else wants it. But honestly what is money other than green paper with dead faces on them? If we didn't care so much about money no one would. The only reason I even work is because in this society people have not yet learned how to give up their material world and live above that. Sure I like to have nice clothes and I like to have nice things. But everything I wear or own is to help me with where I am going in my life and to express myself, and I don't need to spend thousands of dollars to do it. That is one of the largest reasons why I reject this society. It's time to create a new society even if it's only small. It's time to rethink our world and sadly enough I see everyone around me too busy shopping, getting wasted, and sitting on their behinds. We are the future and we are the change, but how can we ever change what we aren't when we are going down the same roads as the ones before us?"

It's okay to be afraid, it's okay to fear what one has never experieneced. I fear it as well.

Yesterday I bought Carlos a hookah for his birthday and today I bought myself season 2 of degrassi. 

It's starting to bug me that my sister has 2 myspace accounts and a lj. It's annoying because I can never sign in on my accounts alone anymore. It's annoying because she is always in front of the computer trying to find people and be friends with the people she doesn't know. It's annoying because she has no online friends. It's just annoying. I always feel like I'm babysitting whenever I'm around her. I love her but she is just so immature, so annoying, so fake. LIFE! It just doesn't get any better than this.

Anywho I got a new Iman compact, then I FINALLY got some Eye shadow base and a really cute blush. I also got this awesome red eye liner that will go so cute with my yellow eyeshadow. TOnight I will be doing some single handed shopping picking up some clothes and some hur. Then settlin down with my boo for anight of conversation on the phone. I wish he lives closer sometimes.

"event","My birthday is exactly 2 weeks from Thursday (june 2 for the mathematically challenged) I expect at least a phone call from all you my friends telling me happy birthday. If not a phone call then I want presents. Especially flowers.........I never get flowers. For other ideas check out all the shit I like in my interests. And for the people who don't wanna buy me anything just call. It's at least nice to know that your friends care. Holla!"

"event","I would like to make an observation. In regards to the last post (pot pie) I recieved two posts from two white males (jason and nate) and I recieved one from one black male (dennis,destiny's friend) and I would just like that say that from this I have learned that only white people like to eat the slop in the crust that they call pot pie. Black people don't eat that shit.........I swear strange customs you pale folk have.

"event","I find myself feeling a billion worrisome emotions. I hate how things are. I don't have anyone that I'm close to. At least not girl wise. And the only guy that I am close to is carlos. So I suppose I'm not really close to anyone except him anymore. I hate worrying about getting into art school. I feel like everything all the work im doing all that I'm hoping for will be a big lead up to nothing. I guess at the same time I'm just being dramatic. God has never let me down so why would he now, right? I just don't feel like I belong anywhere. I just dont feel beautiful, I just don't feel anything. I wish so badly that I could just disappear. Just go away and never come back. I just wish this whole thing could just be over. Why do I do this to myself? Why do I always feel this way. No one understands how it feels to be trapped when you desperately just want to run. I feel like eeveryone is so happy with where they are, so content at least. I just can't have or take this anymore. SOmething has definately got to change. Because at this moment I feel that everything I have is nothing. My job, my money, my car, it's nothing. None of it matters without the rest of it."

"event","Today I actually deleted all of the fucking names of the people that I don't talk to  off my buddy list. I suppose this is the beginning of a purging process. Rather funny that I do it that way. None of these ""online"" people are your real friends anyways. Their just people too problematic to make friends in real life so they cling on to internet pals for self gratification.  It's so desperate........wah wah please post on my picture comment about how beautiful I am. I haven't heard it enough with the last 75 comments. Rather funny. I have about 39 people on my buddy list left. At the end of the day if your no longer on my friends list or myspace you will know where you stand. Kind of brutal isn't it? Not so much as rejection. Just honesty. If you suck then you suck. Just deal with it. I don't have time to babysit people you know. I dunno. Whatever, I'm in a mood.

I saw all of these gorgeous dresses at torrid and they want liek 79 bucks for em. So I decided to make my own. We will see how this turns out. 

I have to go to an art show tomorrow or sunday and I am in no mood to hang out tonight. I suppose I just need alone and creation time......every can understand that right?"

"event","I am for some odd reason obessed with this movie called girl. I think the obsession hails in rememberance. I remember how it felt to be a girl. To get all gitty at the thought of a boy and if he so much as waved to you it was orgasmic. Now as a young woman I don't feel like that anymore, your heart matures, feelings run deeper, you once again know what love is, but in so much more of a spiritual setting. Doesn't mean you don't still feel good things when a boy shows you attention, just means you know what's up. Forgive me I am rambling on about nothing..........to work I go...."

its officially 1:06 a.m. and i just got home from the effin greenday, new found glory, and sugarcult concert.

holy fucking shit. that was one of the best nights of my life.

ok so i came home after school and got ready and junk. then alisa came over and we waited for jordan and stephen to come get us. and then something happened with james's ride and then it took like way longer then it was supposed to. SO we ended up not getting picked up til 6ish when we were supposed to get picked up at 4. so we were really late.

so we're driving there, and we had to stop at regis at rosedale for jordan to get money from his mom. so then we get lost like 8 times just trying to find rosedale. then we finally find it, and the concert is like starting. so jess let us listen to sugarcult from her phone  :)  shes such a sweet&hearts;.

so FINALLY we get there. and its like 7:30. 
so we go to will call to get our FLOOR tickets, and coincidentaly, THEY AREN'T THERE.

so we had to go to the box office and buy tickets there!
but we actually got some decent ones... section 101 in like the 3rd row. 
our seats were honestly good. so that was cool.

so we RUN in and the SECOND we walk in, new found glory is being announced.
it was like amazing timing.

so me and alisa and james sit, and i was going fucking CRAZY.
i fucking LOVE new found glory. i knew every fucking word to every song.
it was maddddd shit. and i LOVED them. they did so good.
their best song was probably ""failures not flattering"" 
but they did awesome in all the songs.

ok so then i took a bazillion pictures and shit, and finally we find stephen and jordan, and they came and sat down. and then suddenly jordan was talking to his dad and shit and he told me that we were gonna get moved to floor and his dad was gonna come get us or w/e. and i grabbed him and kissed him on the cheek i was so excited. and then like 10 min later, his dad called again and said that if we met him at 9:10 at the top of our section, we could go backstage and meet new found glory. i JUMPED over james and jumped right on top of jordan cuz i was so f-ing excited. oh man it was a rush.

so then we went up and met up with a BUNCH of ppl... jess, sammi, kelli, drew, liz, gates, mitch bohn, redman, and some other kid, and then we saw rachel, luke (alisa's friend) and his friends, and tylers sister. it f-ing rocked.

so then we went and sat down and green day came on. then kelli found us and told us she lost her shoe, so she came up to the stands with us. then at 9:10, jordan's dad never showed up...

so we kept watching the show and stuff... then at like 9:30 jordan's dad told us to go upstairs and meet him right now or w/e. so we went up there and waited and his dad never came.  :\  but yeah.

so then we kept watching greenday... they FUCKING ROCKED. honest to god, it kicked some serious ass. my voice and my neck hurts so fucking bad from screaming and headbanging lol. it was AWESOME.

so then after the concert we were gonna meet his dad after the floor cleared, but his dad wasn't out there and the security guards wouldn't let us back there. so we went to the lobby, and they continued to push us out the door. so we decided that we were gonna go stand by the tour buses.

me and james immediatly were up for it, so we went out there, with thin clothes at like 11pm and we stood there with some other ppl. it was fucking cold. so we were like making friends with the ppl around us, then all of a sudden some guy knocks on the door of one of the tour buses, and the drummer for green day comes strolling out with a piece of pizza in his hand. and james goes ""i'm fucking cold and hungry dude. hey can i have a bite?!"" and the fuckin drummer hands him his half eaten piece of pizza. it was fucking awesome. 

so we continued to wait and then eventually the security made us move to the other side of the street, so we did. and we stood and stood and stood. 

finally the bassist for green day walks out and we booked across the street and got his autograph on james's chest and jordan's hat.

then we went and waited some more, then all of a sudden, billy (lead singer of green day) walks out with security guards around him, and i yelled to him how much i loved him and he WAVED at me! lol it was funny. 

then we were looking in the windows of one of the buses and we saw billy making out with some chick... it was fucking hilarious. and i yelled ""i wish i was her!"" and he noticed the window was open and he came over and like made out with the window and then shut the blinds. it was fucking hilarious.

so then we were like finally like about to leave, and it was like 12:15am, so we started walking away or whatever, and something just like made us turn around. and thank the fuck god we did because right there was fuckign JORDAN, lead fucking singer of new found fucking glory. omg my whole mouth dropped and i was in complete awe. 

i ran over and like groped him lol it was hilarious. i told him that hes like my idol and i love him and i would have done anything to meet him and i was like all over him lol. i hugged him like 7 times, haha. and i got 2 pictures with him and he signed my shirt. WOW. it fucking ROCKED. and james was going crazy excited too. oh man it rocked so bad. wow lol. idk it was just f-ing awesome as hell.

so then after i groped and got pictures and an autograph, i left like jumping and screaming. haha and james was so excited he grabbed me and kissed me lol it was hilarious.

so then we finally left at 12:30 and i just got home. 
but all i have to say is fucking WOW.

the concert f-ing ROCKED.
i f-ing met jordan. wow. 
it was all around a rockin fuckin night! 

ok i'm tired so i'm going to bed. i think i'm gonna skip 1st hr tomorrow, and come in during second hr, but we'll see. then i can hopefully get my pictures developed in the morning. and do my homework lol.

AND I'M F-ING GOING! FUCKIN RIGHT!

i'm so f-ing excited. 
i tend to say fuck alot when i'm excited. :)

tonight, i went over to jakes and we went and got his permit!
yahooooo! good job jacob!

then i went to drop off my application at culvers, and then i went to sams club! after that, i came home and ate dinner. then me and jake went to splat to get my money from nick. but he didn't have it. so then we went to the mall to get our hairs cut. and i got my eye brows waxed too. then we roamed and looked at stores and i bought a NEW FOUND GLORY shirt. i'm f-ing obsessed with them. so i'm gonna wear that tomorrow to the concert :)

school= BORINGGGGGGG!
presentations today in honors english AND ap history.
terrifying.

oh well! GREENDAY IS F-ING TOMORROW.
god i'm excited. can you tell? 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! :)

well this was short.

oh by the way, i'm beginning to think nick isn't worth it.
hes kind of a dick and hes just not nice. he makes me feel worthless.
so i really don't think its worth it anymore. 

unless he like gets his head knocked in and suddenly realizes he should be nice to me. but i doubt that will happen.

i'm just gonna leave it like it is for a while and not even bother.
because if its meant to happen, then hopefully it will.
so i'm just gonna chill for a bit and see what happens.

he obviously doesn't show a great interest in wanting to be my friend at all.

maybe me and him just aren't meant to be together, or friends, or much of anything.

oh well, i just hope he realizes he should be nicer to me.
lets hope he does!

ok i'm gonna go dream about NEW FOUND GLORY and greenday! fucking YESSSSSS

"event","well heres the dealio.

i'm in an ok mood actually.
for the first time in a while.

i mean, i've come to realize that i'm fucked in school.
like i can't bring my grades up... so why should i even care anymore?

so i decided to give up for my last 3 days of school, 
cuz honestly i'm just like ""WHO CARES!""

so heres what i did today.
i got in an arguement with mr. deushbag in first hr (a.k.a mr. dussl).
it was actually quite hilarious.
and he pissed me off to the point where i decided to do something about it.

so randy signed me up to see the school psychologist dude (mr. johnson or something) and so i went down there and talked to him about mr. deushbag. 

he suggested that i make a petition and have all the students and parents of students who get good grades and are getting a bad grade in his class sign a petition and present it to mr. handy.

to be honest, i hate this fag so much that i'm willing to do that.
and the funny part is i get out of his class next quarter.
but i'm doing it for the sake of everyone else in his retarded class.

so yeah, i have to work on a petition for that whole plan.

nothing else really happened today.
i finally made up my mockingbird test, 
even though i never actually finished the book. haha
but i actually think i passed!
so i'm ALMOST caught up in english.
i just have a paper to write that i'm gonna hopefully do tonight.
then i'm caught up!

so that means all i have left is a.p. shit! 
like 4 tests  :\
that class BLOWS. i want to drop it so bad.
ugh.
and the damn tests i take, i bomb them anyways.
so its gay. but w/e.

what else is new?!

i have behind the wheel tonight.
yippie skippie. lol
just one step closer to getting my license!

oh yeah, i picked up 3 job applications tonight.
mcdonalds, culvers, and dairy queen,
lets hope i get hired somewhere!

alrighty well this is like extremely boring.
but thats my whole entry i guess!
i don't really have much to say today.

oh, i talked to nick. twice in one day!
its a world record ladies and gentlemen! lol
chelsea told him he should call me to hang out more.
I SO AGREE!!!!!!! lol

but yeah today, it was actually an ok day!

alright i've got behind the wheel in 20 min. eeeeek.
wish me luck! and watch out cuz i just might hit you!

..... i'm not kidding either  :\  lol

"event","ok so i woke up this morning. 
and i realized how much i miss nick.


if you know him, please dont tell him this.
but i just want to share with everyone what i feel like.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/ashleemarie22x/AshleeandNick.jpg"">

i woke up and i realize that i don't know what happiness IS without nick.
i miss him so much.


it was so weird. i got this just sudden realization that i need him so bad.
so i got up at 10:30ish and i've been on the computer since. its 5:07 right now.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/ashleemarie22x/formal0013.jpg"">

all day i looked at old pictures of me and nick and read old convos.

and reading all these things and looking at all these pictures really make me wonder what happened.

i didn't change. not even a little bit. but nick changed DRASTICALLY. and i don't see where the change came from or why he suddenly wasn't in love with me anymore... or anything. i don't get it at all.

some of these convos made me just bawl my eyes out.
he was begging for my forgiveness when we fought, telling me he loves me so much and he can't live without me. and in other convos, he was telling me that we WILL last forever, and I was the one doubting HIM. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/ashleemarie22x/nickash0003.jpg"">

it just makes me want to cry and cry and cry. 

i lost someone who treated me like a princess.
honest to god i took for granted every second we spent together.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/ashleemarie22x/2.jpg"">

i was a selfish, stupid bitch. 

and i can never change that.

i regret the way i treated nick so much now.
reading those convos, and him being so sweet, and me just being a complete bitch... 
it just makes me feel responsible for my pain. i did this to myself.
if i would have been a better girlfriend, maybe nick would still be here. and that hurts.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/ashleemarie22x/ashnick20003.jpg"">

i fucked everything up. me.

not him.

ME.

and i can't go back now. 
if i had nick back today, i'd treat him like fucking royalty.
i swear to god i would do NO WRONG. 

i would do anything to keep him with me and make him realize that i loved him.

because before, i not only didn't show him my love, i treated him like SHIT.

i just want to fix it.
i miss him so much.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/ashleemarie22x/AshleeNick2.jpg"">

i dream about him every night. and i hate it.
because he's not mine anymore. and most likely, he never will be.



i pushed him away.
i made him stop loving me.
its all MY fault.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/ashleemarie22x/3.jpg"">

now i get to live with that guilt forever.
i ruined the best relationship i will ever have.
and i lost the love of my life.



but i've finally realized that. 
and i'll make sure he knows.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/ashleemarie22x/sunsetrose.bmp"">

idk what i'm gonna do, or how i will go about telling him.
but i will. even if i have to wait months until its the right time...
i will tell him.



i love nick castrodale. 

it may have taken me 7 months to realize that,
but it'll take me forever to stop.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/ashleemarie22x/nickandashleecollage.jpg"">

i have psycho amounts of homework.
so i'm gonna go.

"event","well, today was alright.

so this morning i had a project in a.p. so i needed my dad to drive me because there was a lot of stuff to bring. but when i told him that he was not happy.  :\  he freaked out. but yeah.

2st hr i had a science test that i totally bombed! 
oh and i saw ryan mcdonald in i.s.s! i almost cried! lol
i have no idea why he's in there, so if you know, then tell me!

2nd hr, worked on my project with eichhorn, tiffany, and ashley on caesar. and we finally FINISHED. so that was good.

third houw was ok. just the usual singing and junk lol. nothing new.

lunch, just normal.

4th hour, presentations and stuff. i'm so behind in that class its crazy. the end of the quarter is next frickin thursday and i'm missing 3 tests. its crazy. so i gotta start making that shit up!

after school, i went to nicks and hung out with him til like 3:15. i watched him play the new grand theft auto lol so it wasn't anything special. then i chit-chatted with his dad for awhile and well that was it.

then i came home and went online for a while, then gates came over and we watched ""soul plane"". that movie is hilarious lol. then he spent alot of the night making fun of ppl online lol. 

jake came over around like 8ish and we hung out for a while.

then at like 8:45, we decided to go to perkins! that was a blast.
me and jake and mitch were hanging out outside for our ride, so i decided to invite nick too. so he came, surprisingly.

me, mitch, jake, nick, danielle, kelly, nicole, david, jordan, casey, stephen, taylor, and kelli went, along with some of stephens friends that we didn't know. oh and stephens ex gf and her friend. lol so yeah. it wsa fun.

nick was unhappy about being there. he was sitting in the corner for like an hour, saying how everyone hates him and how he doesn't relate to anyone. but the thing is he hasn't even tried to get to know them. i wish he would, cuz they are cool ppl. so alot of ppl went over and told him they don't hate him and stuff, and convincd him to come sit over with us again.

then me, tay, and casey left and went to mcdonalds and to the gas station in search of atkins friendly food. lol then we came back. then i left with jake, mitch, and nick about 10 minutes later. soooo yeah it was cool.

i'm kinda confused about this whole nick situation. i mean, he treats me like shit allllll the time, but he still wants to be my friend?! i don't get it. i mean, we dont hang out or talk alot, so i made an attempt and invited him to perkins with us, and he was a dick the whole time! idk i wish he'd take the whole friendship thing more seriously. the only time he's even a little bit nice to me is when he's witb chelsea. that pisses me off. but idk why i try so hard. i mean, if i'm not good enough to be his friend, then i shouldn't care. but you all know why i care  &hearts;  so its hard just to let it go. i guess i just hope things go better. 

i'm down 1.5 pounds from yesterday! yessss. thats the kick ass part about this diet.... in the first couple wks, you just drop weight- and fast. some days its a pound, some days its 2 pounds... but its awesome to see ur achieving something. and i turned down a cookie, a milkshake, and nachos yesterday. i'm proud of myself! that shit was hard! lol

well this is way long so i'm gonna go. i think i'm going to donny's today! yahoooooo! and on sunday, i'm chillin with molls! we're getting in our pjs and watching degrassi all day. yessssss. now THAT is what i call fun. lol

"event","alright. so i need to update you on yesterday and today.

so starting with yesterday.
the school day was gay. like always.
i was really late first hour. 

in second hour i had to go explain to my ap why i wasn't in 4th hr on monday.. that was interesting lol. i also was told by some ppl that chelsea was spreading some bullshit lies around about me. that wasn't a happy thing to hear. 

third hour was boring, lunch was gay. 

i talked to nick and chelsea before 4th hr and nick said everything chelsea is saying is a lie and chelsea says that everything nick is saying is a lie. so idk what to believe there. 

stayed after school for a.p. and made up this vocab thing. 

then i went home and got online and i talked to chelsea. and i basically told her that i'm sick of this bullshit going on behind our backs and that all this fighting is based on rumors and we should just STOP. so we decided that we just want to team up and try and be there for nick and help nick. 

so chelsea talked to nick on the phone and just told him that we both want to be his friend because we are seriously sick of fighitng and we just want him to quit drugs and be friends with both of us because we care about him or w/e. so then he called me and we talked about it. and it went ok. he was being pretty cool about it and said that he just doesn't want our friendship to turn into a ""relationship"", and i told him him that i don't want a relationship with him anymore  :\  and that i just don't want to hear about that part of his life. he agreed to that. so, i guess we're friends.

i talked to nolan, finally.. it went good. i was happy cuz i missed him! lol and hes my buddy, so i'm happy we're like cool again. so yeah, it seemed like a pretty good day. 

i stayed up and watched the elections... the time was just flying by. 

it was like 7, then suddenly it was 10, next thing i know its 12 and anitas dad is making her get offline lol. 

i stayed up until about 4, when i finally decided that this whole ohio thing was gonna take a while, so i figured i'd take a nap... so my alarm went off every 10-15 minutes until 5, then i got up and watched the news until 6:30... then i decided i had better get ready to go lol.

i went to jakes and they were already gone so i had to wait and his mom had to drive me up there seperately. i felt bad  :\  but shes way cool.

went outside for 1st hr and randy & brad were my cubs and i was the mama bear in the game we played. and they died, but i lived. muahahahaha. :)

2nd hr was the play. very confusing. and that was also the period that i found out that kerry conceded.  :(  i almost cried. i was getting so sick of political talk all day though. ppl that don't have a clue about politics and just pick a candidate for the hell of it bug me. because its annoying when they don't even know if the candidate is gonna do any good for our country or not. thats probably why teenagers can't vote.

Focus, i talked to chelsea for like 5 minutes and she told me abotu her and nicks convo. then I took a test, that i didn't finish, but i got pretty far. 

3rd hr was millers PARTAY. very fun. i ate pepperoni and cheese cubes. haha he loved the party too. it was really cooooool.

lunch was eh.

4th hr was boring.

and yes. that is where i am now.
oh and i started atkins today. thank god.
i need to lose weight and fast.
i figure i can lose 25 lbs by christmas, that'll be my goal.
but i guess we'll see.

i didn't talk to nick. at all.
like he said hi to me when he was with chelsea.
but thats it.

i think i'm scared to just approach him out of the blue and start talking to him, because i don't know how he'll react. especially when hes with chelsea. its an intimidating situation and i guess i don't really know when i can and can't approach him. i wish he'd make an attempt to approach me once in a while  :\  but w/e. i hope our ""friendship"" actually becomes a true FRIENDSHIP, not just a title. i actually want to be friends and have fun together, so i hope that can happen. 

well thats about it for my day.
molls stayed home so i was bummed.

tonight my uncle and aunt from rochester are coming over.
tomorrow night me and mitch are having a movie fest! yahooooo.
i'm looking forward to tomorow because its like FRIDAY! yesssss.

ok i'm done. ttyl. i have more to write about stuff so i'll do it later.
this is more of an overview, its not really emotional. but i've got a lot more i want to say about the way i feel right now, so i'll do that later.

leave me comments. PLEASE. 
and thanks to my lovely friends that have been! 
you guys are kick ass! love you!

it bummed me out to be in that place.
me and nick used to go there and play mancala and write on the chalk board.
oh the memories...

i made anita cry today.
its because she understands.
most ppl don't and she does. and thats why she cried.
she gets it. and i love her for that. shes the only one i have.

i love molls too. i hope she feels better soon :(
you are my best friend babe and i love you no matter what! 
i'm sorry i'm making you sad!  :(  i'll try and cheer up, i promise! lol

"event","guys are all liars. honestly. i do not trust any of them. they will tell you over and over that they never want to hurt you and see you go through any
pain, when in the end, they will just throw you out like a piece of trash anyways. i'm not mad at nolan. i don't have a reason to be mad at him because all he did was pick a damn girl and tell the damn truth. but nolan did make me realize that all guys are out to hurt me and lie to me and break my heart, just like nick did. i thought nolan honestly liked me, and i honestly think he acted like he did... but in the end, i guess he lead me on the whole time? i don't really understand what happened or what the heck goes on in his head, but w/e. he picked bridget over me. thats it. and i'm not mad at him. i'm just frustrated. because i thought nolan was different when he turned out to be the same as the rest of the male population. guys are all a bunch of nick castrodale clones. i will explain to them that i'm scared to get hurt again and get my heart broken, yet they completely disregard my warnings and they just go and break my heart over and over and over. i dont really understand why. maybe my heart is like a play-toy or something, cuz that sure is how guys treat it. at this point, i'm done trying & crying & being frustrated over anything with a dick. 

i'm just done. 

fuck guys, 
fuck relationships, 
and fuck love.

seriously, just fuck it."

"event","hey babes and studs &hearts;

me and molls are home from bomb's partay. it rocked off my socks. lol we chilled. and i talked to nolan and donny and dan for like a long time. lol on the telemophono. lol. it was rockin. :) so yep! 

mollie mehri passed out on my bed like an hour ago. lol its funny. all of a sudden, she was sleeping so i was like ""hmm what to do, what to do"" so now i'm writing in here!

i feel alot better then i did earlier today.

i did alot of thinking and i've come to the sudden realization that i really don't care what nick does with other girls cuz i just don't! hes not worthy of my time and i dont think someone like that belongs in my life at all anyways! honestly, he can screw chelsea bell and i could care less at this point, as long as i don't have to see it. as long as i don't see him being touchy feely or kissing or anything with her, then wtf ever! idc! seriously its gay to care. cuz hes gonna obviously go out with many more girls in his life time (actually i'm sorta doubting that since no girls like drug addicts and cocaine users :\ ) but i shouldn't care because i gotta get over that anyways. so YAY. i'm feeling happier actually. and that rocks.

plus, my convo with nolan. that rocked too. that made me happy. :) idk what conclusion i came to from the convo, but he sure is fun to talk to! lol and dan is hilarious and donny is awwwesome so thats always good. lol so yeah! it was cool. i'm all happy.

tomorrow morning, or actually this morning, i'm going to donny's house to ""PARTY"" with them. lol its gonna be perddddy fun!

well i'm gonna go to sleep! i'm excited. so yep.

ttyl! x's and o's! 

BOMSTADS PARTY ROCKED! JESSICA, YOU ARE THE ---BOMB---! 

love you! ashlee

"event","alright. i seriously HATE everything right now.

i am sitting over here and i was talking to molls and i really started to think... what is the point? this is never going to get better. my feelings, all of these problems, they are never going to go away. so what is the point of trying to be happy when its all a lie anyways?

i swear, i'm to the point where honestly i don't think its possible for me to actually be happy. because it seems like the whole world is like turning against me. everything is like being dropped on me at the exact same time and its just making things a thousand times worse.

i'm so completely frustrated and UNHAPPY right now.

lemme give you the jist of what is going on...
so after the interesting choir concert night, there were some rumors going around that chelsea and nick are ""going out"" and stuff. i was very unhappy to hear these things.. so i got very frustrated at lunch. and i talked/bitched at chelsea. and didn't stop.. for like 8 minutes straight. i found that she ISNT going out with nick, thank god. and i was very good about not fighting her or hitting her. you should be proud. 

i did not see or talk to nolan all day on friday. 
i was sorta not in the greatest mood in the whole world obviously and spent alot of the day like pretty much hiding. plus, thursday night i was up most of the night crying so i really didn't feel like getting ready on friday. 
it was just not a good day.

last night i went to jordans party. it was ok.
i seriously was trying to have fun. its just really hard right now.

i got home at 1am and went to bed. 

this morning i got up at 11:30 and came online and interestingly enough, talked to chelsea. we got into it alittle bit YET AGAIN. but then, i said i was done with nick and the whole thing changed. she was like begging me not to give up on him. that, i don't understand. she said she'd step completely out of it just so i wouldn't give up. I DONT GET IT. i still continued to say no, because he doesn't care and he doesn't even have enough decency to apologize for everything he has done to me. 

well she said he does care and he wants me to be happy. 

well i'm not. i don't think i should give someone that tortures my life the time of day. hes not worthy of my time. he doesn't even deserve to be in my life anymore if hes going to treat me like this.

so i'm moving on. and here is what i know. 

i'm gonna start getting completely over him and moving away from everything and i'm gonna get over it and be FINE. and you know what he will do? hes gonna go ""omg shes really gone, shes really leaving""... and hes gonna crawl back to me. and i'm not going to be there. 

thats exactly what will happen. 

so i don't care anymore. i am done. i am moving on. he won't ever want to be with me at the same time i want to be with him. so... i'm done trying and crying and yelling and screaming and feeling LIKE THIS. i'm just done.

and like i told chelsea, all i want from him is my $30, my stuff, and if hes a nice enough guy, a decent apology. plain and simple. and then i'm gone, out of his life... i'm just done. i don't want to look at him, talk to him, or even hear his name. hes just gone. and thats it. 

well, nolan reads these things. 
now i know that. so i fucked myself over there.
nolan probably misunderstands what i mean when i talk in here though.

the point is, nolan makes me happy. i honestly can't find one other guy that makes me smile and completely forget about all this shit that is happening with nick. even if i have known him for 2 weeks, i know hes special. and all of my friends can tell that hes special too. to me, thats enough to know i like him alot. he seems to disagree..

see he can't figure out how i know i like him so much if i've only known him for 2 wks. but the thing is that i DO know. in 2 weeks, i have gotten to know him better and the one thing i know for sure is that he is a very good guy. he keeps telling me hes not. but i know he is. hes fun, hes sweet, hes hot, hes nice, hes understanding, and most of all, hes caring. i appreciate that so much. i really think hes a very very good guy.

i wish he'd make up his mind. because i know i want to be with him. i just want to know if he wants to be with me too. 

i know we don't know eachother THAT well, but there must be something special there, ya know? 

not to mention that the whole freshmen and sophomore class seems to think he broke up with katrina because he liked me... if that is true, then why in the WORLD is he CHOOSING now? its sorta confusing...




whatever. i just hope things get better from here on out. 
cuz all this junk, its just all coming at once.
i haven't felt like this since the summer.

i need to feel better and smile because i'm happy, and not because i want to try and show ppl that i'm okay. that is my goal.



tonight is bomstad's party and molls is coming over soon. so we are gonna get ready and go over there around 6pm. i'm gonna try really really hard to have fun tonight. 

please leave me comments if you have anything to say or any advice.. or just talk to me about it. 

thanks to everyone who has been here for me through all of this stuff. i love you all so much. you don't know how much it means to me to know i have friends like you. so thank you.

i'm gonna get ready. ttyl.

"event","alright yesterday was f-ing crazy. idk even what to say about yesterday. it was fucked up. i guess the day wasn't all bad, except i totally bombed an ap test again, but i have a b- in the class! woooohooooo! its awesome. so i'm excited about that. 

after school, i went over to molls house and then me, her, and laura went shopping at kohls for dress pants for the choir concert.

then i went home and got ready for the concert and ate some nasty shit for dinner (lol it really was) and ok so then i went to my grandmas and drove to the concert with them.

ok so i got to the concert. we practiced on stage, then we walked around. donny and dan and jessica were there, so that was nice of them lol but they were there for bridget lol but still it was cool. 

well the night WAS very interesting cuz alot of ppl were seeing shit that i was fucking PISSED off about, i was like having a heart attack i was so pissed.. but ppl saw shit like nick and chelsea were like holding hands and she had her legs on him and he was supposedly ""kissing her toes"" and all this fucking bullshit so i was like freaking out. so then EVERYONE was seeing this shit and looking over there and it was really GAY.

so we sang and it went AWESOME. and donny and dan were whispering ashlee to me lol i almost died. but yeah ok so i was walking off stage and when i walked by bengal mixed i stared at them with the BITCHIEST face i could possibly make. and i fucking hope they noticed. and when i sat down, i was soooo pissed, wow. 

so then the concert ended and i walked down and shit and saw chelsea and nick together yet AGAIN so i was all pissed off, but i sat and talked to molly and jessica and sammi and ashley and kerry for awhile. and then i walked away with jess the bomb and we saw that nick and chelsea were right behind us. so i went and met with my mom and grandparents and nick tried so fucking hard to avoid the situation, you could so tell. so i yelled ""HEY NICK, WHY DONT YOU COME SAY HI TO MY FAMILY?!"" cuz i was soooo pissed so he said hi and thats about it, and then i seriously gave him the meanest look of my whole entire life and walked right by him. i was SERIOUSLY pissed worse then ever. my adreniline was like fucking running so fast. and i was bitching all the way out to the car and in the car all the way home.

when i got home and got online, i was still bitching my ass off. i was so pissed you don't even know. then chelsea came on and asked me what was WRONG. well i'll just show you the whole f-ing convo cuz its worth reading so that everyone can know what was said so heres what it says:

AshleeMarie22x (9:48:03 PM): well are you on the phone with nick
CoWgIrL 0359 (9:48:26 PM): NO
CoWgIrL 0359 (9:48:36 PM): HE CALLED ME AND I TOLD HIM I HAD TO GO
AshleeMarie22x (9:48:44 PM): well i'm calling his cunt ass back then because this is bullshit
CoWgIrL 0359 (9:49:09 PM): OK

ok so in the middle of this, nick calls me out of the blue and hes like ""wtf is wrong? why are you so pissed at me? and why are you bitching chelsea out?"" so i screamed my ass off at him for like a fucking hour, i just yelled and screamed and bitched and i told him how much he fucked my life over and i seriously just SCREAMED at him.

at the end, i told him to go die and he said ""ok i will"" and that was the end of the convo.

well then i wanted to call him back and tell him that i didn't tell chelsea to make her decision and that she made it on her own, so i called him back and we bitched some more and he told me he doesn't care if i'm in his life. oh and he told me he'd shoot me if i came in his house because if i was dead, that way he wouldn't have to listen to my bitching anymore. i got SOOOO fucking pissed about that one.

well then we got off the phone for that convo and he called back like 15 minutes later. so he told me that i had better not fuck up and say something bad or he'd hang up on me cuz hes not gonna ""take my shit"". then he proceeded to give me a long list of RULES i need to follow if i can be in his life. so i said FUCK THAT. i'm not gonna fucking follow rules just so i can be his friend or something. so instead, i told him that i'm done. and that i'm gonna do everything in my power to forget all about him cuz i was sick of feeling this way.

then i read him this like 14 page note that i wrote in the summer when i was like really depressed cuz i knew he needed to hear what it said. i bawled through the whole thing. i seriously could hardly read it and i know that impacted him. so w/e i don't care. i'm done caring. and i'm done crying. i am moving my ass on and i'm gonna forget about anything and everything to do with him. and thats it.

i gotta go to school.

"event","ok heres the day. i think it was ok for the most part. i mean, ya know, it was decent at first. i mean, i've never gotten so much homework in one night in my frickin LIFE, but its not like i'm gonna do it anyways. but besides that, it was managable.

so, whatever. i managed to make it through the day. and then i took the bus home. a girl on the bus did taro cards for me. interestingly, they were VERY true. my past was that i was benefitting and that i like had something i really wanted (NICK), my present was like losing something and going crazy and disappointment (NICK DUMPING ME), and my future was basically about giving up hope and that i won't get what i want. which just seems so realistic to me. its a little scary.

anyways, i went and hung out with jake for a while after that. i went home around 5 and got ready and got dropped off at Molls. We hung out and then i ate and she went to voice lessons so me and her sister watched ""gilmore girls"". and then molls came home and we went to the game. 

so the game. it was interesting. everything sorta sucks at the presiding moment. because ok. i like nolan. i will not deny that. but i do NOT want to hurt anyone at all. seriously i have no intention of being with him if its going to hurt any of my friends. if they are not ok with me being with him or liking him, then i will easily fix that. i just dont want anyone getting mad at me over a boy. i just want to talk to anyone who has a problem with it so i know if they will manage with me possibly ever going out with him or if they are completely against it, because it would make this whole process a LOT easier. but idk, me and nolan tried to talk and that didn't work out so good, so hopefully we can figure some crap out later sometime.

i like him alot guys. i really do. hes sweet and nice, hes fun to be with, hes a major stud, he makes me smile no matter what, and he makes me forget about nick. i have yet to find another guy that does that for me, so that must mean he's special. i really hope something can eventually happen between us. i guess we'll have to see!

alright. now i'm sorta just bumming out. i've got like soooo much homework its psycho. but idc, i dont want to do it. i really just DON'T feel like it. so idc. i'll just copy someones or something. 

and i'm kind of sad honestly. i talked to nick last night on the phone. i tried to tell him how i feel, sort of. but everything i said went in one ear and out the other. 

idk, feeling like this makes it hard to want to do much of anything. i can't concentrate anymore enough to do my damn homework. i can't really concentrate to do anything at all anymore. i hate that feeling. i just wish i could do SOMETHING to fix this bs. like either forget him completely, or just lose my feelings for him all together. ugh.

here are all the things i am feeling like right now:
i am hungry. i am cranky.
i am freezing. i am blah.
i am sore. i am disappointed.
i am aggravated. i am exhausted.
i am rejected. i am dreading h/w.
i am blank. i am gloomy.
i am frustrated. i am depressed.
i am numb. i am unsatisfied.
i am sad. i am cynical.
i am guilty. i am pessimistic.
i am bitchy. i am unhopeful.
i am lost. i am wishing.
i am desperate. i am stressed.
i am psycho. i am confused.

"event","well. i'm crabby. idc this is all so retarded.

well lets see. i'm so far behind is school thats its turned like depressing. i don't WANT to do my work because i don't FEEL like it because when your pissed or sad, you really don't FEEL like doing anything. its kind of funny to me that i could still be sad.. to this day.. about something that happened months ago.

i am so frustrated with everything right now. 

i don't know what is wrong with me! something must be.
i'm going crazy. thats it. i'm going completely psycho.

i don't know what to do anymore. everything is just going all so wrong. love is TORTURE. i swear to god i don't understand. because he is a diiiiiiickhead! HOW CAN A DICKHEAD BE SO PERFECT IN MY EYES?! :-\

this was over. over 6 months ago. yet that bastard won't go away. its stuck in my head. and it won't go away. its funny because i get all excited and i like someone else soooo much and then when it actually gets to a point where something might happen... i freeze up. and i start trying to find each and every fault in the person i ""like"". and then, i slowly like them less. i blame every bit of it on that stupid bastard. fucking over 6 fucking months ago. grrrrrrrrrrr.

anyways i'm calling him to talk to him. cuz i think he should know. not like he'll give a fucking shit anyways. but hey, i mise well tell him. 

fuck this shit.

"event","well the wedding. it was fun. the food kicked ASSSS. oh man. i ate waaaay alot of food. lol and then i danced with my grandma and my mom. we did the chicken dance - haha. and i slow danced with my grandpapa. that was cute. so yup. for the most part, the wedding.. it was fun.

i don't like weddings though. i decided that. i really like seeing ppl that love eachother. cuz love is like the best feeling in the whole world. but i can't  help but think that they are gonna lose it anyways. sometimes i wonder if love can actually last forever. idk it seems to me like all couples run into their problems and slowly drift apart. i guess only the lucky ones get to experience true, longlasting love.

i guess weddings make me sad. they make me think about what i could have right now that i don't. and i hate that. becuz i don't want to think about that. but weddings make me think that way. about the plans i made for my future... how many kids we were going to have, where we were going to live, what our wedding would be like... weddings make me go back and think about nick. i don't like to think about nick. but thats what weddings do to me. and because of nick, i now found it hard to like weddings. becuz i always think that they will break up anyways. nick took the fun out of weddings for me. i guess he really took the fun out of a lot of things for me. and in same ways, i hate him for that. for lying to me. for pretending he loved me. it only made it harder. sometimes i think i want to just go back and just say no from the get-go. i don't know if that would have been a good idea or not. i guess i will never know. and i guess i will never know where me and nick could be today if we were still together. because we won't be together. ever again. and i guess that fact won't get through my head. no matter how much i think i'm over him, it seems to me that i still can't get him out of my head. god i hate that feeling.

but the good part... is that i have finally found someone who makes me forget about nick. and so. hopefully something happens with this someone. cuz obviously hes special if he takes nick completely out of my mind. and like all my friends have been telling me, thats exactly what i need right now. 

so anyways. back to the wedding. it was fun for the most part. and when i got home from the wedding, i was bored. so i watched ""love actually"". again. for like the 45th time. lol i love that movie. its so cute.

i was writting down quotes from the movie. because that whole movie is like just adorable and there are some really cute quotes so i wrote some of them down.

that movie is one of the best in the whole world. you laugh, you cry, you get mad, you feel bad... you smile, you get warm feeling inside... its just a great movie. 

i guess i am addicted to love and everything that has to do with love. i believe in everything to do with true love and i believe that we all have that perfect person. i think that only the lucky ones actually find it though. because most of the time, people are just out to marry any old person that comes along. but i won't do that. i'm a true romantic. i will find my one and only. because i believe there is one out there. there is that person that i will never get bored with. the guy who makes everyday brighter and somehow makes me love him more everyday as time goes by. i'll find him. maybe i already have. i guess i don't know right now. but i know hes out there.  

anyways that movie is really good for you ppl that are like me and think like me lol. 

well right now, i think i'm love sick. i hate it. there is nothing worse then the agony of having a crush on someone. its like torture. because when your crushing, nothing is actually going on at the presiding moment. so you have to work for it. and that makes it torture. its hard to like someone when you don't really know if they like you back or not. but i guess everything can't always go your way. sometimes someone can see love in something that someone else just doesn't see. love and liking and crushing is confusing... but it also requires patience. so we'll see what happens. 

anyways i got this idea to write down everything i would want in my perfect guy. i figure before i get a boyfriend, i can consult my list to make sure the guy i'm going for has at least half the qualities i want in my perfect guy. becuz i'm super picky when it comes to picking guys and so maybe my list will help! so yeah i made a list. i have like 35 things on there. i figure i'll prolly end up with alot more. i'll just add more as i think of them. so hopefully that list can help me in the future!

well. this is an interesting entry. its confusing. lol oh well. i'm bored. well i should go. i'll go to bed or something. tomorrow we're doing a tit fest at 3. yahoooooo. i'm excited. lol we're seeing ""napolean dynomite"" at 3 and then we're eatin out at tanners. its gonna be a blasssst!

i figured out that i have an obsession with typing alot of letters in words. geesh. i do that alot. lol i think i just realized that. hmm. lol

anyways i'm gonna go. i'm bored and tired. so i'll talk to everyone tomorrow. i have a lot of homework. oh well screw it lol i'm bored of school. k i'm leaving. i keep saying i'm leaving and i don't. but now i am.

oh and molly comes home tomorrow! woooohoooo

ok. &hearts; you. ttyl.

lOvE ashleeeeeeeeeeeeeee
(there i go with the lots of letters thing again. lol)

p.s. i love sarah and kelli because they are cool and called me at the wedding today. lol no one else did cuz they don't love me enough! so screw you guys! lol i put in my away message to call me if you love me! and those 2 are the only ones that did! how mean of all the rest of you. maybe if you love me enough, you'll be nice and call me tomorrow to cheer me up. :)"

"event","hey guys and gals. 
well i am in a bad mood. i'm tired and cranky. 
so here i am to vent my problems. here goes:

i hate boys. idk what to do anymore about any of them. they are all too confusing. i mean, gosh. idk. sometimes i really wonder what the HELL goes on inside their heads?!

nick. he gets to me. i don't even know why. i keep asking myself what this thing i have for him really is? because i can't tell if i still have feelings there or if it is just the fact that i'm not over him yet. or maybe i just don't know how to act around him. thats another thing it could be. thats what i keep thinking. i don't really know what it is. sometimes, i wonder if life would be easier if i just told him that he has a choice: i'm either in his life as a girlfriend or out of it completely. because i don't think there is an in-between for us. i don't think its possible for us to ever have a friendship without those feelings coming every once in a while. so maybe its time we just stopped all of this. 

i guess i really do wonder if he needs me. maybe i am an essential part of his life. because it seems as though everytime i try to run, SOMETHING pulls me back. i wonder where that feeling comes from. and why i have it. 

you know, i really thought i was over this stuff. honestly. i mean maybe i really am. i can't even tell anymore. because if i think about it, i generally assume that i just don't know how to act around nick anymore. i honestly think i'm over him.

then again, what if i'm lying to myself?

i can't tell if i have feelings for him or not. 
and now hes being nice to me.
thats not helping.

i wish there was a simple solution. either i'm in or i'm out. thats what i want. i can't keep living confused and i can't keep thinking things that aren't there. maybe its time i let it all go... the love, the friendship, the everything. 

i need to think more. but i think that is where this is going to have to go. because i can't live like this anymore. especially since i like another guy. alot. this whole nick thing needs to go away completely. and then i am free to do what i want to with the other guy. i like him so much. that i know for sure. 

its funny how i'm so positive i like this other guy... yet i can't even tell if i have feelings for nick?

you'd think after loving someone for 2 years, you'd learn to know what true feelings feel like.

hmmm.

anyways i'm confused. so i'm venting.

me and molly  never went tping. thats ok though; she was a tired little girl. lol i stayed up til 6 making pictures on her Adobe thing. that was fun. they are pretty too. and then we watched a movie in the morning and chilled out. so i had a blaaaast.

and molly is friends with jessica again. THANK GOD. that was getting confusing. i'm  happy i'm not involved with the confusion of that anymore! and i'm happy they got their best buddies back! :)

ok i'm gonna go. my night got all screwed up. i got invited to a bunch of places but i guess my ass didn't leave the computer chair to go to any of the places. oopsies.

"event","hey! alrighty well today was very...odd. jake and willet left without me this morning (FUCKERS lol) so jakes dad had to give me a ride. i was supposed to have a peer mediation meeting in the morning but idk, she like wasn't there and there was a staff meeting so i didn't go. first hour we went outside and my teacher is psycho. second hour was boring. third hour i sung. lunch was nothing new. fourth hour was very boring. and by that time, the day was over! lol so yeah it was a boring day. but then after school i hung out with nick. and that was just weird but ok. he came over and we were bored for a while and i made him watch degrassi with me lol and then we talked about a buncha stuff for like an hour, just like talked about stuff thats going on. and then we decided we were gonna go do something, so we went to olive garden and ate dinner! we didn't have enough money so then his dad had to bring money up there lol it was kind of embarassing. then we ran across the highway (nicks shoe fell off in the process lol) and then we went to the mall! and we saw michelle and alyssa so that was cool. then we went to hot topic and looked at band shirts and stuff. then we went to the halloween store and beat eachother up with swords. and then we went to spencers and i knocked this thing off the shelf and we laughed for like 10 minutes lol. and THEN we went to the food court (which they are remodeling) to see thanh danh who works at the chinese food place! lol so that was cool. and THEN we went to best buy. and that was fun, we played video games and played piano and looked at movies and cds and junk and played with stereos. and then we sat on the bench outside of best buy for like 20 min then we decided to go home lol. and then nick came over and played with the light switches for like 20 min and then he left. so yeah. that was my ODD day. idk the whole concept of me and nick hanging out was weird. i mean we ate at OLIVE GARDEN, the place we used to go for anniversaries and stuff. idk its so weird. but hes over me, and i'm just his friend. and i think thats hard for me to comprehend. because for some damn reason i keep thinking that hes acting like he likes me. maybe he does it every once in a while cuz hes not used to acting any other way, but idk it just seems to me like he acts like he likes me. maybe its just not right if we hang out anymore. i dont think i'll ever understand the fact that hes over me. i'm not saying i like him. i'm just saying that i don't know how to act around him. idk its so weird. i wish this could all be easier. i mean idk he kept calling me darling and he kept flirting with me and stuff. it just makes everything even worse when he does that kind of stuff. because then that leads me to believe something might happen and then i just get shot down again. he did tell me he was sorry for everything though so that was nice. i think i might hold off on me and nick's ""friendship"" but we'll see. anyways this is getting WAY long so i will go. ttyl! leave me a comment if ya feel like it!!! love you! byes

ARG! i hate being drug into things i'm not even involved in. its retarded and it leads to lies and it just BUGS ME! so i'm all cranky about that. but i'm still happy i got my buddy nick back. at least i hope. oh and i guess he never actually did talk shit about me, which is good to hear. well anyways i'm gonna go. ttyl.

"event","I have not even a week and a half left of school and my procrastination is worse than ever.  Probably because I don't see how any of the work I have left to do will really impact myself as a student before I'm done.  I won't be any smarter after doing the things I have left to do.  Anyways, it's because of that procrastination that I am updating this, and for Ashley as well.

To start off, I'll comment on my Lenten experience as well.  This year was really really though.  I just had too much going on and the things I gave up were essential parts of my daily routine.  Despite sli-ups every now and then, I still was very conscious about it and reflected on it a lot.  Biting my nails is a habbit I don't expect ever to break because I know exactly what situations trigger it and those are just unavoidable in life and there is no other competing behavior I could replace it with that is just as reinforcing and I think punishment would have to be too severe.  However, this weekend I did buy some nail bite stuff because I have important events in the next few months I'd like them to look nice for.  Events which also will trigger nail biting, hence the no nite polish.  We'll see how well it works.

Coffee after 12 was one of the hardest.  I had become accustomed to having it before afternoon work and class.  I think in the 6 weeks I only slipped once or twice and it was under occasions where I had gotten very minimal sleep and had class in the evening.  It was good for me though cause it cut down my caffiene in-take a lot.  When I did have coffee one night this last week at around 6pm, it was amazing how affective it was and how late I was able to stay up doing things like reading articles which would have put me to sleep by 9:30 otherwise.  So the new goal is to keep the after 12pm coffee really limited to hold it's effectiveness.  

Giving up sleep was variable.  I am sleeping now more than I was during Lent.  The difficulty was due to only having tea as a source of caffiene after 12pm to keep me awake so I was falling alseep rather easliy, but then I would just wake myself up early to work on stuff.

I'd have to say the best part of Easter was driving to MN to surprise my parents.  I made my parents cry twice in the same day.  Mission was accomplished.  It was a break I really needed to right before the end.  I figured it is one of the last opportunities to drive home and do that since I'll be in San Francisco for my new job in about 5 months.   

And speaking of last opportunities, I only have 5 more months of being able to drink Caribou on a daily basis.  Yes, I do drink it daily and I don't even feel bad about it anymore knowing I won't be able to have it anymore in 5 months.  Brenda, I might have to ask you to mail me some every once in a while, like monthly probably so I can keep making my own.  I will no longer be able to have Caribou dates with anyone.  I was discussing that with my little sis on the phone today b/c she will be in South Carolina where there aren't any bou's either.  But we decided we'd chance our caribou phone dates to beach dates where we both drive to the ocean and and chat there.  We'll both be about 2 hrs away so it may not be able to happen that often, but I guess it'll have to do =)  

I don't even want to think or talk about moving cause it jsut stresses me out.  I just don't have time to do it and am not sure how it's going to get done.  I wish I could just go to sleep and then wake up and be there.  If anyone has time and is willing to travel out to San Fran and check out places for me, I'd greatly appreciate it!  I'll thank you some how, just not sure how yet.  

Those are the major highlights of my life right now I guess.  I'm so ready to move in general though.  I miss my old apartment and living on my own again, despite this being the best roommate situation I've ever been in.  I guess that goes to show I jsut don't live well with other people.  

Okay, timer for my dinner went off.  Must go.  I think I'm going to go back and read my past entiries from when I first moved here.  And to think in 5 months I'll have to ones from Califonia.  Crazy!  I'll definitely be posting before then with updates of the moving process though."

"event","So my semester is over and that is all I'm going to say about that.  I am so excited though because in less than two weeks I get to roadtrip with Grant to see my friends in Wisconsin from undergrad and then we head to Minnesota where I will be able to see all my friends and family from Minnesota!  Plus, my car that I now am the owner of will be waiting there! I'm very excited! Unfortunately I will have practicum, thesis and work until I leave, but oh whatever.  And that pretty much sums up everything.  I'd add more, but I'd rather just talk to people in person... soon enough! :)

On a side note... I am pissed at my roommate.  So I have a 10 gallon tank with 6 gold fish.  Twice now my roommate scott has just gone and added water to the tank.  You can't do that!!! He didn't even ask me if he could.  I don't think he treated the water either which is really bad for them!  He also feeds them.  He never asked if he could or even how much to feed them.  Nissa would feed my fish, but she at least asked me the first time how much to feed them and then told me she does.  I didn't even know Scott was feeding them till I was cleaning the tank like a month or something after we moved in.  Grr.  So sometimes they get fed three times in the morning.  I never asked for help taking care of them.  If he wants to help out around here he could clean our bathroom once in a while...."

"event","So last night Me, Nissa, Steve, Steve's coworker Scott, Keri, and Keri's Friend Kate were all sitting around what they called a ""hole-on-the-wall"" bar.  I didn't think it was that bad of a bar.  They had 2 dollar Bud lights.  Pretty crappy stuff...lol... but cheap.  It's been forever since I've had Bud Light.  Anyways... someone brought up sailing cause Scott works part time for the Bellmont Yaht Club and teaches sailing lessons.  He asked if we'd all want to go and we all said we would. So a couple drinks later all of us, cept Keri cause she had to work at 6:30am, are walking over to the lake to go sailing.  Scott didn't think we were serious.  We get on the boat about 2am and sail till about 4.  Okay, it was my first time on Lake Michigan and my first time sailing...It was awesome!!  I have to say one of the best views of the city is from the lake on a boat in the middle of the night when it is all lit up.  We sailed all the way past downtown to go see if we could see some pirates on the south side, and then back up.  The best part was that I was steering the entire ride!  Scott didn't believe that I hadn't even been on a sail boat before, but I told him the conceptisn't that hard and I've spent every summer growing up on the lake; I have a general idea of how boats react to wind and water on a lake.  Anyways, it was pretty cool!  And the fact that it was so spontaneous and at 2am in the morning when no one else was on the lake really.  We were going to go to Michigan, but I said I had to work today.."

"event","So yesterday was a great day!  Morning class was cancled, it thunderstormed and poured while I was downtown at a new caribou I had not been to before.  I got paid to sit with a sick little boy for 2 hrs while watching the Disney channel.  

Today was a bit of a different story.  My issues involve practicum.  So, I had today off. I am normally out in Cary, IL working with the little girl, but the fam is out of town this week. Well, I ended up having to go out to Oak Park to meet with the consultant about the program for the little boy I work with out there.  So as a team, meaning everyone who does therapy with this little boy has to get together every other week for a ""team meeting.""  Well, so everyone except me decided that Wednesdays at 4:15 would work.  It does for me for the first week we meet.  Then it doesn't.  Other times that I have available as well as other people, don't work for my consultant/supervisor because she does not want to drive in traffic.  So she basically asked me to see if I could take off work, all so she does not have to drive in traffic.  I'm sorry, but does anyone else see anything wrong with that?!  It basically means the other little girl's therapy hours have to be cut that week so my consultant does not have to sit in traffic.  This is also unethical from what I've been learning in class this summer.  I was not upset about what she was asking at the time, but now I can't even think about it.  What's even worse is that it means now three days a week I have to been in oak park and cary IL on the same day.  When I thought about having to do that a third day of the week, I pretty much wanted to cry, cause it is not fun.  I lost my one evening of the week I am home before 6, my second evening of the week I'm home before 7.  It seriously would not bother me so much if it would be the only time we could meet because everyone else works, but no.  That's not the case.  I'm sitting there saying I have to work and she is basically saying to my face ""too bad for you, I don't want to come at Monday at 5 because it's rush-hour so you should come on wed instead.""  Then she had the nerve to tell me that the mom in Cary should be happy having me come to these meetings because I could take what I learn from these meetings and apply it there, like that mom should be greatful I'm in these meetings instead of providing therapy to her daughter.  In my opinion, the consultants for the fam in Cary are much better.  Grr...

Okay, I'm done now.  I biked home from Nissa tonight after this meeting and it actually helped me calm down a lot.  I wish I could go for another bike ride, but I have homework.  I may have to up the amount of biking I do now, just to stay calm and sane.  Oh, and then I stopped for a cold press at caribou down town and they were out of half and half.  Lol.  I was a little not happy about that either.  Now I'm cooking a REAL dinner; I think it's going to be amazing!  And tomorrow is a new day(even though I have to see this consultant for class =/) so it will all be okay."

Don't put too much pressure on yourself right now. Sure you have goals and aspirations, but every day that you don't reach them isn't a failed effort. You're a work in progress, and you are entitled to take a few days off or downgrade a lofty goal. Keep things realistic, or else you may end up disappointing yourself. When push comes to shove, you should always be treating yourself with care and support. Being your own drill sergeant is not going to work anymore.

I'm not sure what I think about that.  I kinda don't have a choice about the way things are going or how fast they are moving."

So yesterday I biked to school.  7.5 miles.  Most of it was along the lake front trail.  It was awesome!  That part only took about 31 mins.  It took about 15 mins to get one mile west through downtown...go figure.  Then on the way home it was more dangerous biking past North beach with the 80 volleyball courts than through downtown in rush hour.  Seriously people need to know not to stand in the middle of a trail.  It woudln't be worth it if I couldn't take the trail.  I leave about the same time I would to catch the train to school and get there about the same time(but I figure it will probably go faster when I get to know the route better).  I was debating how often I'd do it cause it's not any quicker and I was slightly bummed I'd miss all the nicely dressed men on their way to work UNTIL I saw all the nice looking shirtless men biking or running on the trail. =)"

Today I happened to take 394, 494, 169, HW 7 and a bunch of roads in between Ridgedale, Edina and Minnetonka.  While driving I realized I was driving with a small sense of fear knowing that driving is the most dangerous thing I was doing today.  It made me very alert but a little nervous at the same time.  I'm hoping that once I own a car and drive over 25 miles an hour on a regular basis that my fear will go away.  I was just not able to enjoy myself as much as I have in the past driving around the burbs."

"event","Yesterday while babysitting, the kids' old nanny Megan called.  She said she was in the area for a Dr. appt and wanted to know if she could stop by and see the kids.  I said it was fine, I didn't care and kinda wanted to meet her cause the kids talk about her all the time.  They love her, which is cool, she was their sitter for three years so it's totally understandable.  Well, while driving over we were talking about the kids on the phone and stories about Evan came up.  Evan is 4 years old.  When I interviewed for this position the mother informed me that Evan has control issues.  He like to be in control and will agruge and fight with you so he can be.  Well, Megan was asking me if he threw fits for me and I said no, not really. He has a couple times but that was a long time ago.  She said he throws fits for his mom all the time (which I was well aware of cause i've seen it a number of times) and that he had been since he was 18 months old.  She said it's a big surprise for people who knew him as a baby cause he was so calm and sweet.  Anyways, she said he used to throw fits for her too.  She then told me she had a chance to talk to Evan recently and she asked him if he threw fits for me?  He said no and when she asked why not, he said cause it doesn't work.  She then asked if he still threw fits for his mom, and he said yeah.  When she asked why, he said, cause it works.  Wow.  A four year old knows this and knows how manipulative he can be.  I thought that was awesome.  The couple times Evan his thrown fits for me I have completely ignored them and did not give in and that's why he doens't bother with them anymore cause they don't work on me.  I thought that was awesome.  Seriously, what mother lets their 4 yr old son walk outside it below zero degree windchill in a short sleeved T, even if it is only 1/2 a block?  That's not the issue.  The issue is about who is in control and who knows what's best for the kid.  My jaw almost dropped when I saw Evan walking like that one morning with him mom in toe carrying is coat.  Evan basically runs the show at his house.  It's pretty funny to watch.  I'd be exhausted if I were his mother.  He basically throws a fit ever time she says no about something or places a demand on him which happens daily when they have to go home. His control issues are not jsut part of his personality, or something he was just born with.  He has issues with it because she has allowed him too.  It's going to be a long 14 more years for her."

"event","So Friday was my last day of class for the semester.  I had one class from 2-5.  Upon arriving to class, our TA informs us that we aren't really having class, we are going to a bar to drink instead; our professor is taking us.  Awesome!  So, on Friday at about 3pm in the afternoon I was sitting on the rooftop of Rockbottom in the middle of downtown drinking what I'd have to say was some excellent Chicago beer with my professor, TA, and classmates, which happened to be the majority of the people I regularly hang out with anyways.  It was about 70 and sunny as well-the prefect weather.  I have had some issues with this professor, but overall she is really cool.  At about 5:15 they started taking down some tables on the rooftop to prepare for the night crowd so we took our pitchers downstairs to the restaurant.  That was cool though.  While there, my professor returned a missed call from our program director who at that time offered my professor a full-time position at our school with the salery she has asked for.  She was only a part time prof, working at U Chicago as well.  We were all very ecxcited for her cause we like her a lot.  Then Merbitz, our program director who jsut turned 60 a couple weeks ago said he'd meet us for drinks.  It was pretty cool.  He even picked up the bill we had aquired while there, writing it off as a research methods class debriefing.  Around 6:30 most of us headed back to Jen's house to grill out and watch the Cubs game.  The Cubs last pretty bad, and so did the Twins.  Around 10:30 I was pretty beat and headed home knowing I had to get up and do a lot of school work for my TA session today, but it was probably the best class ever.  Nothing liking drinking with your professor and classmates on a sunny Friday afternoon in downtown Chicago for free.

On the not so cool side of being in Chicago in the spring I do have to say that it is already getting more touristy out and tourists really bug me.  Also, the trains were just horrible today.  It took me an hour and a half to get to school. I left an hour so I'd get there about 15 mins early (I wanted to stop for coffee) and I was almost half an hour late.  I really need to get that bike so I can just bike to school.  I guess it's a give and take situation.  

My semester is basically over!!! I just have to write my research proposal by Friday =/"

"event","I realize my last entry from almost a month and a half ago was also a conversation that I had with Dylan, but that boy is just too cute.  This was our conversation yesterday:

Dylan just randomly asked me while we were playing, ""Do you have a kid at your home?""
Me: ""No, I don't have a kid at my home.""
Dyl: ""Well, you should get one.""  ""But you can't have me.""  ""But you can't get one at the grocery store beacause kids don't live there.""
Me: ""Oh, well where should I get one then?""
Dly: ""A restaurant.""  ""No, kids don't live at restaurants.""
And then I think he started talking about something else or something, but it was just too funny.  I love the way little kids think.  

Other then that, I just spent a wonderful 6 days in Minnesota.  It was great to see Brenda and all my family.  I went to caribou a lot.  I love how much cheaper it is there.  I also went to the U of M to get articles from the library.  It seemed so much bigger then I rememberd.  It was slightly wierd being there, but I loved it at the same time.  I also loved driving there and back.  I miss driving in Minnesota.  I got to play the handbells for church on Thur, Fri and Saturday.  I really miss playing those as well.  I really need to work on finding a church where I can do that down here.  When I was got back to Chicago and was riding the El home I noticed how jerky it was to ride and wondered if it is actually possible to bruise your internal organs?  Or, does riding the El on a regular basis wear on your body more then riding in a car that has a MUCH smoother ride?  I was looking at my calander for May and I there are only 4 days where I'm actually in Chicago where something isn't going on that takes up the whole day.  I'm out of town for 17 days of that month, and the other days I'm basically working.  I have a feeling it might actually be a stressful month rather than a summer vacation before classes start again in June.  My semester ends after my TA session this Saturday.  I'm way excited! Though I still need to do my research proposal for the 28th, so I guess that is really when my semester will officially be over.  I just gotta get it done, the sooner the better.  Lots of other things have been going on keeping me constantly busy as I'm sure is the case with most people. I'm way excited about spring and summer weather.  It makes the traveling so much easier and now when I go to work I just spend all day with the kids outside or at the park.  It helps keep me from falling asleep which I think is probably a good thing."

So today I might have almost regretting picking up the extra days at work this week, but then you hear kids say things like this, and it's totally worth it.  Or, you sit with a 4 year old laying in your lap while stroking his newly buzzed hair cut for half an hour while talking about the fact that you live in Chicago and he lives in Oak Park, which ""are right next to each other!"" according to Evan, but ""we both live on the same planet! Even grandma and grandpa!""  Oh, and btw, according to Evan we don't live on the planet, we live in it, and not on the edge cause the house wouldn't fit, but right in the middle."

"event","Wow, today was an interesting day.  Let me try and recap...keep in mind I had a few cocktails this afternoon...

So the day started with me all of a sudden waking up at 9:45 slightly hung over.  Not real bad, but it was one of those lazy mornings where I didn't want to do anything.  Friday I had Research Methods from 2-5 and then we worked on homework for one of my classes from 5 till about 9:15 so we pretty much needed to go out for our own sanity.  So anyways...
This morning I basically made some breakfast and continued to work on school work till I showered and left to meet Nissa at her place so we could go to school together for a CABA meeting at 3.  We were required to go for one of our classes.  So after my shower I luckily felt slightly better.  I headed out and got to Nissa's just after 2.  She was still in her pj's on the couch watching a movie with Steve.  She wanted to finish the movie and show up late.  I basically made a really big deal about how it would be bad to show up late and if she really wanted to do taht, I would jsut go and see her at school.  Well, she decided she'd get ready real quick and we'd go.  So we are leaving with about half an hour to get to school.  We can't decide if we should take the bus or walk to the El.  Nissa mentions getting Caribou on the way and I automatically zone out of everything else going on and agree getting coffee would be a great idea! even if we are ten minutes late Lol.  So we go to Caribou where I run into an old classmate from HS and chat for a bit.  We tell her how we stopped to get coffe despite being late and what not.  So we are leaving and there is the bus right outside! So we hop on.  Nissa thinks the bus will take too long to get downtown and that we could get off and take the El.  She calls Jen to see where she is at.  Jen says Jeff her bf is going to drive her to school and they can pick us up on the way.  So we hop off the bus and start heading to Clark and Belmont where we are to be picked up.  Turns out it's better to meet Jen at her house so we head there.  Keep in mind it is about 30 below wind chill and we are walking pretty much all over Lakeview at this point.  So it's about 3pm when we get to Jen and Jeff's (the CABA meeting was supposed to start at 3).  So now we are in the car passing Caribou where we were jsut at.  We pretty much walked in a huge circle.  Then we are on Lakeshore Drive on our way to school.  Jen mentions that she does not want to go to this meeting.  Nissa and I agree, at which point Jen turns around to us with that little gleam in her eye.  Jeff asks if he needs to turn the ship around and we all pretty much say yes.  Our alternative is to go back to Jen's place and start drinking, so we do.  We head back, get some gas on the way and chill at Jen's place drinking at 4pm while all our other classmates are at this meeing.  A couple of them come over after the meeting.  We order food for dinner and what not.  Jen pretty much passes out at 7, but she has to get up for work at 4am, which she had done today as well.  Alber, Nissa, Steve, Nick and I all leave around 7:30 and here I am.  As for the rest of the night?? Not sure yet.  I'd go out but I don't think I can afford to after going to the transvestite bar last night-that was an experience.  I was waiting for the lady-man's boob to pop out of his/her ""shirt"".  I think they were taped in.   And that has pretty much been my weekend so far.  I also saw another rat in my alley last night.  That makes two this week, also being the first times I've ever seen them here.  I'm not liking it so much.  Two in a week is kinda a lot in my mind."

We were suposed to bring in 5 examples of hard to discriminate stimuli.  She said that my examples were so good that if she could give extra credit, she would.  I thought that was pretty cool.  I wanted to ask my professor in class today if I could get extra credit for that.  It's crazy how I hate this class and love it at the same time.  We only have actual lecture once a month, but it's for 4 hrs with only one 10 minute break.  The amazing thing is that the professor is so good that I actually stay engaged that entire time. How many college/grad professors can you think of that could do that?  And it's pretty much straight lecture.  The way the class is set up, meeting only once a week and then meeting with the TA on our own time, really sucks, but then the class itself is amazing.  I get really excited cause we are learning exactly the stuff I will be using when working with my kids with autism.  It brings warm fuzzies just thinking about it, I get so excited.  On the other hand, I sit there and think, wow, this guy is amazing.  There is so much more detail to everything then I thought.  Behavior is actually really complex when you try and break it down in a way so it is teachable to someone who can't learn it on his or her own.  I only hope I can be as good as my professor some day.  But that kinda gives me inspiration to work that much harder to be really good.  I'm trying to cure kids with autism, I don't think I could live with myself knowing I didn't try my hardest."

I just got mine working tonight and jsut being able to check the weather for tomorrow is amazing.  I feel a lot more connected to people too.  What's also cool is that I have wireless internet as well.  It doesn't work for me cause i only have one computer and the modem has to hook up to somewhere, but if someone brings over a laptop with wireless capabilities, I can hook them up to my internet.  It will make it very convenient for study groups and what not.  

On a completely different note....  Lets just say class is really interesting when the professor is trying to get her behavior analyst students to role play a therapy session with phrases like ""So you feel ___ because____.""  Yeah, totally unrelated to what the majority of us will actually be doing when we are graduated.  Most likely, the community of people we work with will be nonverbal, or if they are, they won't be at the stage where they can talk about their feelings.  It's bad, but knowing that makes it really hard to take the class seriously."

"event","At first I was excited to start the semester.  I needed to get back into a routine.  After a week and a half, I have been having a difficult time getting into the whole studying routine.  At first I thought I hadn't really recovered from last semester, but then after thinking about it, it is more anxiety about how this semester is going to go.  On top of taking more credits and still working my two jobs, I have to work on an e-portfolio.  What I'm going to put in it, I have no idea.  I also have to create a research proposal to present before the IRB which ultimately should relate to my thesis.  What that's going to be I have no idea.  Then I also have to decided on where I want to do practicum next year and which of my jobs I want to try and keep, if either of them.  They each have its own pros and cons.  I'm not really sure how I'm going to get through this semester.  I figure I'll pretty much start living at school where I'll be forced to get work done, and can get help if I need it.  I was hoping I wouldn't have to start doing that this early in the semester, but it doens't look like I have a choice.  I imagine highlights my social life will once again consist of the Sunday evening study groups I will might attending merely because it is an off-campus activity I'll be attending with friends.  Or, the hour dinner I have on Thursday nights between class where we step across the street to the food court, again because I won't be at school.  Yes, the excitement of the semester is oozing from my skin.  It wouldn't be as bad but most of the classes this semester are more clinical psych related and less ABA related.  Really, they are two almsot comletely seperate fields.  One, a school of psychology, and the other, more of a natural science then a school of psych(my prof even said so), and I'm just not as interested in the clinical aspect of it, not as much as ABA anyways.  Today's my last day I think where I get to lounge around my apartment and attempt to get work done and I'm going to take advantage of it.  With a 47 degree temp I think I'll get outside on the lake-front path cause tomorrow bright and early I'll be at school studying my life away."

It's a Friday night.  I don't work tomorrow or Sunday and it will probably be the only weekend I won't work this semester.  Instead of taking the only chance I'll have to go out and not worry about when I get home so I can actually function the next day, I decided to stay home and start working on some of my school work.


I guess one of the second year students left the first day of one of the classes I had today to go cry in another classroom, when she had this class last summer. This would also be the three credit class the prof said should really be a 6 credit class spread over a year, and I already don't really care for the TA who will be teaching half the 4 hr long classes."

Part of my duties while at the Cunningham's to ""watch Ryan"" included frosting Christmas cookies, running errands at the mall, and wrapping Christmas gifts while Ryan was asleep or occupied.  I also had hand bell practice for Christmas mass and will again tomorrow.  I love playing the bells.  I attempted to sleep in this morning w/o setting an alarm for the first time in like forever, and of course my little sister happened to call my mom at 7:15, which woke me up.  Before getting into Minnesota on Monday, I spent Saturday night through Monday in Eau Claire.  It was so much fun to see everyone again!

I have been stressed out a lot lately over my schedule for when I'm going home for break, when I'm coming back and when I'll be working next semester, so looking at the list did not help one bit.  I still had to write my reaction paper by noon for that night's class, but was too distracted.  I finally got it done though.  I then went shopping downtown with Nissa and Jen.  I found some really good deals and I hadn't been shopping in forever so it was really fun.  We even skipped our first ""class"" from 6:00-6:50 to keeping shopping--bad I know, but that class isn't really really class as much as it is an orgranized advisory group that meets once a week to talk about our program, so missing it wasn't a big deal.  We then went to class straight from shopping where we were lead by two second year students because our prof was gone.  After class I went back to Nissa's where she quickly changed, and then a big group of us went out bowling!  It was so much fun!  I hand't gone since July.  I even won the first game out of like 12 players; I was doing really well.  Jen and I think we should form a bowling league for next semester, cept it is slightly expensive to bowl here, so we'll see.  I didn't get home will 3am though and I had to get up at 5 to go to work on Friday.  That was definitely not fun, but totally worth it.  Once I left my house at noon on Thursday, I didn't think about my schedule or anything on the long list of things I need to take care of, or anything else, and it was great!  I needed that little break.  I don't have one free day from now until the end of the semester, which will be quite interesting.  I think things are going to be pretty intense, but that's okay.  Only 11 days till I go back to Minnesota!  I'm so excited!  My parents are going to be so surprised, it's going to be great!"

I went to some workshops and what not, but none of them really related to what I'd be doing with my degree or they were on stuff I had already learned in class.  Oh well, I can now say I have been to Pittsburgh, and even though I didn't learn much there are definitely some memories...
The first night we went three different bars.  All kinda dive bars basically, but it's been a while since I've been able to get a long island for 3 bucks so that was cool.  At the next bar, we got to see Nick get totally hit on by a gay guy, which followed the show of two girls making out. The next day we walked down The Strip"" I think it is called. It's suposed to be some major street; yeah...not really.  We passed a rubber convention and tried to get in, but couldn't.  Then we went to the Andy Warhol Museum, which was pretty cool.  The next night, a huge group of us ate at Bucca's for dinner and then wen't to this bar called the Matrix that was right by.  We got in for free and then they had 50 cent drinks till 12.  It was a pretty cool place cause it was like four bars in one.  There were different rooms to the place, each playing different music.  We did a little bar dancing to the song Get Low.  We saw a man around the age of 65 completely rocking out on the dance floor, it was the funniest thing ever.  Jen and Al got some great pictures of wierd people.  The next night we did our project share for extra credit, which really was not bad; glad it's over.  Then they opened the bar where we all had 4 tickets for free drinks.  They had a chocolate fountain and other food as well.  After that, we hit up the Matrix again.  No 50 cent drinks that night,  but oh well, still cheaper then Chicago.  We did most of our dancing in the 80's room where we danced around a few interesting characters.  It was a great bonding experience being at the bars with a bunch of program people.  I never really see many of them outside of class.  I even got to meet some people I never see cause we have different programs.  Good times!  Then after we all got home, 8 of us went to go see the movie Saw II.  It was interesting, that's for sure.  Never saw the first one.  But I hadn't seen a movie in the theaters since July so it was nice to do that.  Hope yinz had a great weekend!"

What makes the situation even more sad is that the dad grew up in that house and they had just finished a lot of remodeling on it that year.  Now they will have to live with Grandpa probably till the end of the school year before they can move back.  But, at least they are lucky enough that they can do that.  I was thinking about the situation today on the way home from work and was realizing how interesting it is that the family means so much to me, when really, I was only the babysitter.  However, I was their very first babysitter.  I was also the first person other then the parents who Will actaully let put him to bed, including other relatives.  That was a pretty big deal according to his parents.  There were also many nights that the mom would drop me off and we'd end up sitting in the car chatting for sometimes up to 1.5 hrs.  I always used to wonder what the dad thought when the mom was gone for so long, cause I only lived 5 mins away.  But, and I really hate to generalize like this, most men do understand that women like to chat.  It's still hard for me to comprehend the situation; I was planning on going to babysit for them over winter break, but I'm not sure that is going to happen now.  Living with grandpa kinda includes a full time sitter, but we'll see.  Or, to think that house that I really did like a lot architacturally won't be there anymore.  Because it was a 3 alarm fire, there is a lot of water damage beyond what was actually burnt down.  Things really can change like that over night.  I'm sure none of this is really important to anyone, but I just felt like reminiscing about it since it was on my mind today."

"event","A general update:
Work with Ryan is getting better.  He is definitely responding to me and my presence a lot more now.  He just steals my heart if I can get him to laugh.  Although right now he is sick with a cold and ended up throwing up on me today; that was lovely.  But then I bathed him and he spent a good amount of time sitting in my lap while I sang songs to him.  It was adorable!  Normally it wouldn't be that big a deal, but when a kid has autism, getting him to be socially engaged with you like that is big.  I've gotten so used to singing songs to him while I pull him in the wagon that I do it now automatically, even if he isn't listening.  It's kinda funny actually.  I'm not even bothered by the looks I get from others on the street while I sing.  I start instructional control with him on Friday.  I'm probably just as nervous to start that as his mom is to have me start.  Not having done this before can be kinda scary but I gotta start somewhere.  Yesterday I took the two little boys I babysit to the park in the morning. It was gorgeous outside.  I could have stayed there all day.  The boys were adorable as usual.  I'm only supposed to babysit them on Friday's but it looks like I'll babysit most Wednesday's too if I can fit it in.  I have a really hard time saying no to babysitting, esp when the money is totally worth it; I can always squeeze school in there somehwere.  Yesterday, I experienced train issues both to work and on the way home which made the really long commute even longer.  But, I did stop for caribou half way home and that was really nice.  I also stopped at Old Navy to get new flip flips cause Guinness ate my other pair, and they don't have them anymore!  Seriously, what's up with that?  Lots of people are still wearing them. So then, I was on the redline home after stopping for coffee and this guy is sitting next to me talking on his call phone.  He proceeds to tell the person on the phone he thinks he is sick and was throwing up everything yesterday.  Okay, don't share that info out loud in tight public spaces!  I totally would have moved but I was sitting in the inside seat.  I was debating getting a flu shot before, but I think the debate might be over. To get to work on Sat and Sun, I have to take a half hour bus ride to the train station.  I usually use this time to call my parents and catch up cause it doesn't use my minute and I can garuntee they are up at 8 on a Saturday morning.  Well, this morning, this lady on the bus yelled at me for talking too loud.  I kindly told my mom I'd call her back when I got to the train stop so I wouldn't bother this lady anymore, but I was pissed.  Seriously, I was sitting like 4 seats away and if I was that loud she would have known I was talking about medical insruance stuff so obviously the phone call was important.  It kinda pissed me off more then it probably should have.  She wasn't very kind about it though, and I'm not very cheery when I have to get up early every Saturday morning.  Does she tell everyone who talks on their cell phone on public transportation to be quiet?  Or every person talking outloud on public transportation to be quiet? As far as school goes, we've figured out forming study groups and dividing the readings up is very helpful so things have been going well there.  I responded to an email from my prof that I wanted to pass my unit 3 SAFMEDS in class last Tue.  He replied saying you can go ahead and give it a try.  This was only a week after passing Until 2 and we still had 2 more weeks to get it done, but I was thinking, no, I'm telling you I'm ready, and I was; I did, so those are out of the way at least.  One Unit left to pass.  I wish I could do that already, but we don't have the cards for it yet.  My Thur night prof said she'd let us out early from class this coming week since it is my birthday and she let us out early last week for Nissa and Al's B'days.  She said she can't discriminate, which would be bad since it is a diversity class.  Speaking of which, we have been talking about disabled people lately in that class, mainly about a book written by someone disabled by polio.  She is a very bitter person and makes me feel bad for being and AB--able bodied.  Anyways, the next day I happened to hear about the kids in MN with polio cause they weren't vaccinated.  Get your kids vaccinated!  Polio isn't gone, we just havne't seen any cases cause everyone gets vaccinateed!"

"event","My horoscope for the week from the REDEYE(a free addition of the Chicago Times, much like a campus newspaper, only for the city of Chicago)said that it is ""Be-a-Sloppy-Drunk"" week...yay!  And that it is time to vent all my frustrations.  Well, I didn't have any really this week until today.  I walked all the way to the public library with my computer where I was going to type up my paper and use the internet.  Well, when I got here, I realized I forgot my notes I had written out for my paper.   Now I have to go back home for what was mostly a useless trip, or rather a much less productive trip then I was hoping.  That's my frustration for the week.  Now I just need to fulfill the sloppy-drunkeness part.  On a happy note though, it is 70 and sunny today and tomorrow is going to be 73 and sunny and it's the middle of October!  I took a more residential walk to the library today and it was beautiful with all the changing leaves...I love October!"

My mom even said she wouldn't mind if I went out to the bars with my friends that night even though she comes in to town that afternoon to visit me for a few days.

As long as I am mentionind exciting news, my bank hassles have hopefully finally been worked out as well.  Five customer service calls, four weeks, four diffent banks, three pin numbers, and two new visa cards later, and I might actaully be able to use an ATM to get some cash!"

"event","Getting to school was kinda a bitch this morning.  From what I heard, one of the El trains derailed so they had some tracks shut down and one whole line not running. This made the red line that I take to school very packed.  And then we had to wait 10 mins for other trains on the track before we could move at one point.  Then when I transfered to the brown line, that was packed as well cause of the back up.  Good thing no one that I was standing next to smelled cause we were packed in there like sardines and it was hot.  Getting stuck next to people for a long period of time on public transportation who smell, either like smoke, too much perfume, or cause they have not showered, etc. has happened in the past.  The best moment though was when we were just stopped on the tracks for 10 mins and I could hear this middle aged guy sitting near me playing Brain Adams really loud on his iPod, whatever his ""I'll be there"" song is.  I could hear it over my own music, it was that loud.  It made me smile.  It was just as great as the day I was waiting for a bus and this younger guy in his mid 20s was blasting Norah Jones really loud in his car with his windows down."

""Move Along"" --All American Rejects

Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold

Speak to me, when all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along

So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold

Speak to me, when all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)

When everything is wrong we move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
Along, along, along

When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through"

"event","I am now finally employed to the extent that I wanted to be!  I just got hired for a 9.25 hr babysitting job every Friday.  The commute is an hour and fifteen minutes each way, meaning I'll have to get up at like 5am, but for what they pay me, it's totally worth it.  Plus, if I limited my job selection based on location, I'd never find anything.  This means that I now work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, but oh well.  I do what I have to.  The kids are adorable too.  A 2.5 year old boy, a 4 year old boy, and two first grade girls.  I really missed babysitting so I'm excited to start it up again.  I was totally stressing today cause I've never interviewed for babysitting before coming here, and after my interview yesterday I was pretty sure they weren't going to hire me just cause I've never had to compete for babysitting postitions before.  Then I'd have to start the whole process over again.  It's nice to know I don't have to obsess over craigslist.com for employment anymore.  And, sure enough the YMCA contacted me this afternoon (though I didn't get the email till jsut now) saying they had postions open in all ages for their child care center if I wanted to come in for an interview, after I emailed them my resume over three weeks ago for sure."

"event","I haven't really talked about classes lately so here is an update all based on how this week is going...

Today I emailed my professor asking to meet with her to discuss some comments that I did not understand that were made on a paper I wrote for class.  I received a good grade, but didn't understand the comments so I wanted to clear them up. In the email I specifically said I was available up until 6pm on Thursday.  She writes back asking if we can meet at 6:30-6:45 before class.  Hmmm, now does that seem like a possibility to you? This is graduate school right? 

Monday night we were emailed study guides for a quiz for my Tue night class.  There were 5 study guides (one for each reading) totally 88 questions, just for this 10 quesiton quiz.  Fun times!!

My Tuesday afternoon class is quite interesting.  Yesterday the professor was trying to answer a student's question.  I had understood the problem and knew how to explain the answer to her question, however if I would have tried to listen to how the professor answered the question, I would have been highly confused myself, even with knowing the information.  It got to the point where I wanted to get up in front of the class and answer the question for her myself.  I felt kind of bad for her cause the professor made no sense which is usually the case.  This class is a three hour class and the whole period is taken up by just answering students' questions about the material for class.  Three hours of questions from a class of only about 20 students!  I think that definitely says something about the material we are learning.  It can't really be the way the prof teaches cause so far he really hasn't taught us anything, more just clarified material we've read for class.

On a side note, I might have previously mentioned that out of the 37 kids in my program, 6 of us have birthday's in October, well the count is now up to 7 and I don't think everyone has been asked yet.  I just think that is kinda funny.  But it still makes me not happy I won't be able to celebrate any of those 7 birthday's."

"event","Losing my license on Friday has not been fun really now that I have realized all the things I won't be able to do.  I think God realized I didn't have the self control I should have with not going to the bars as much as I was cause I don't really have the money to and he decided to fix that issue.  Or maybe it is a Carma thing for Friday night if you believe in that kind of thing.  That's cool with me, not having a license makes for a better excuse not to go out then just saying I'm too poor.  However, I have realized that means I won't be going out to celebrate my birthday in 4 weeks or any of the 5 other birthdays in Ocotober that kids in my program have.  No one can come visit me before I get my new one unless they don't want to go out...yeah right. Not only that, but I have to go to Pittsburgh in 6 weeks and I don't have any identification to boad the plane with. I'm not sure I'll have my new license by then.  Oh...the advantures of Chicago...  

Other exciting news...my transactions finally came through of what my debit card was used for after I lost that too and it turns out it was used to buy an escort at thegoldenapple.com I'm pretty sure.  They only spent about 60 bucks though.  What's up with that?  The possibilities were endless.  I did have my U of M ID in there as well so maybe they assumed I didn't have much money.  Someone is investigating what 60 bucks gets there, for me.  Still, it totally beats Nick's story of someone using his debit card to spend 400 dollars at Walgreens when he lost his."

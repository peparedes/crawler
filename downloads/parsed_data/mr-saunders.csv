"event","I had an unexpected guest stay with me for the past five days, and all I can say is I am most tired. We had numerous conversations at which I learned a bit from him, we had Chinese one night which.. I didn't really find to my liking, Korin may know how I like my shop run, but shes oblivious to my taste in foods, along with everything else about me, and damn it thats how it should be. I'm pretty sure we learned a bit about each other, and shared some memorable moments, which reflecting back were very amusing. Hmph, the shelves are getting dusty again, Korin must be slacking.."

"event","Hm, I did some research from one of my books, and was rather fascinated by this chapter on Feral Children. It appears they grow wild, primal, down the very essence of what Humans really are. From my research, it would seem that the most intriguing of these cases would be of Wild Peter. A wild boy, who was captured in the woods near the German town of Hameln, in Hanover, on July 27, 1724. There were rumors that he had been born dumb or retarded and abandoned in the local woods by his father. These cases fascinate me.. I do love my occult library, it eases me durring these hard days."

"event","Taavi, everywhere I go there he is. Damn him, damn his annoying grin. No sooner do I leave to get some coffee to hold me over for the night there he is! Him and his little group, the green woman oh yes she was there to, the most obnoxious being I have ever come to meet. Drunken to the point where blinking and talking becomes a chore, hmph. To my discovery Taavi had made the biggest regret of his life, by marrying one of those..bleh things! I pray it won't last long, consider their horrid spawn clawing at my doors coming to annoy me with their high pitched voices! And to think at one point I actually came to respect him. I was almost embarrassed for them when the green woman fell off the table, don't ask me what she was doing on it in the first place perhaps some furry instinct? I will never understand them. Perhaps theres a book I can acquire to research them. Taavi you annoying bastard, I pray for the worst in your future.."

"event","Why do I feel this way? The business is efficient, my employees do not get in my way as much as they usually are prone to do. And I havent heard the word.. ugh 'FURRY' in four days, why do I feel this empty hole inside me. Perhaps I am longing for somthing, hm I shall ponder on this a bit more for a while after a few chapters on Wilhelm Reich, lord I am tired."

"event","I have arrived recently, I have been away at work, I cannot truly say that I am happy to be back, but its home. Most of my time was spent at the docks district of this town doing 'business' with the local scoundrels. I wont get into details about such matters, but all I will say is that this months rent will be paid."

"event","Christmas, the only holiday in the year which I appreciate. Everything else is a waste of time, and speaking of which I can hear my employee upstairs arguing with another stubborn customer, honesty.. the people in this town have no intellect. if they are not too busy staring at each other then they are doing it in my shop, humbug.."

"event","Yes. I have just earned enough money to purchase my own home computer. Aside from me, this is the only other form of intellegence in this garbage town we refer to as 'Chada'. I cannot believe that 'Sanders' was already taken as a screen name, nevertheless I have this new journal thing.. so at least I have somone to talk with that can listen to me and not drool out of idiocy."

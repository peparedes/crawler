"event","Reunions weekend was indeed a bit like a mini-version of Cornell.

<lj-cut>  I was disappointed by how few of my Cornell friends had come back.  I was there primarily for Chorus and Glee Club, to sing with them again under Scott Tucker's baton.  That indeed would have made the weekend worth it, by itself.  I had studied the music beforehand, but had not fathomed the magnificent directions in which Scott would take it.  After not singing in a year...what a way to sing again.  I was constantly challenged: as soon as I got comfortable with one aspect of the piece, Professor Tucker would add something else for us to concentrate on to make the piece even more brilliant.  And we would concentrate, and you could hear the difference, and the sound would melt you inside.  There I was, rehearsing in Sage Chapel with the Chorus, and, like so many times in college, unable to imagine anywhere else in the world that I'd rather be.  And when the Glee Club sang the Biebel in Goldwin Smith on Saturday night, that alone would have made the trip to Ithaca worth it.

Outside of the Chorus and Glee Club, though, I knew very few people.  So at breakfast, for example, I would randomly join people and try to have conversations.  And randomly meeting Cornellians my year whom I had never met before, I didn't feel like I had much in common with them.

Then I started hanging out with the bandies along with my friends Heather and Steve.  My good friend Carolyn had been in band and couldn't make it to reunions, so I did my best to help fill the Carolyn void (which of course is impossible without her).  And they were fun and my kind of people.

Then there was this one guy who I kept randomly running into.  After the Goldwin Smith arch sing, someone said something about a tent with swing dancing, which of course I had to check out.  And he was there, and I got to dance with him, and have a real conversation with him and his friend from freshman year.  Awesome people.  The kind that don't get scared away nor glaze over when you admit that you have a Ph.D. in cosmology :)  He had been a CS major with strong interests in the humanities, and his friend was an astro major.  The astro alum (Chris) was disappointed that Tamma wasn't there, but I think moving is a good excuse.  However, Tamma, I was told to tell you that Reunions is very much like slope day except it takes place all over campus and lasts all weekend, and you and Jerry should come next time :)  (There are ways to come without spending the $ for the whole weekend.  One of my friends from Chorus had fun figuring out how to take part in most of the activities whilst giving them as little money as possible.)

I also had an amazing conversation on the way up to Cornell with an engineer-turned-actor from the class of '96.

So, in the end, I met awesome people much faster and more easily than I meet awesome people in life outside of Cornell, and left Ithaca feeling that Cornellians include an incredibly high concentration of amazing people.  Of course, there are plenty of Cornellians to whom I would have nothing to say.  But the people I'd click with are there, and with a bit of effort, they can be found.  (I still miss very much the awesome Cornellians I know who weren't there, and hope I get to see them sometime soon!)

I still hate the ""rah rah give Cornell money"" aspect of reunions, but there's not much to be done about that, other than ignore it.  I am, unavoidably, a willing participant in the ""rah rah sing songs about Cornell"" aspect of reunions."

I must remember that in the long run, no one thing is a big deal, no single decision is critical to the rest of my life.  The key to happiness is adaptability and resourcefulness, more that striving to find the ideal.  It's good to search for happiness, but in what I have as well as what I might be able to achieve.  _Any_ situation can be seen as happy; Polyanna, you realized that long ago.  Whatever fate brings me, if I can take that and work with it and make it into my dream life--that is the key to happiness."

AIMS (African Institute for Mathematical Sciences) is a marvelous place.  Located a half-block from the beach and maybe three blocks from the mountain, in a neighborhood called Muizenberg, a select group of masters-level students from all over Africa take intense courses in subjects across the mathematical sciences.

The scenery around Cape Town is exquisite.  Have I ever seen ocean that blue next to beaches that open?  Some of the areas are built up, like the Waterfront, and it could be any waterfront in America except for the African souveniers filling the tourist shops.  But other areas, like around Muizenberg, it is quiet and beautiful...although it is starting to get built up.  Visit Cape Town now!

The class and race divisions are still extremely strong.  It is the whites along the mountain, basically.  You can drive all along the mountain and everything is luxurious and life is easy.  Some people never see any other part of Cape Town.  You have to go away from the mountain to reach the low-cost housing--shacks with lines of outhouses, or rows  of tiny cement apartment buildings.  Physicists here seem to get involved in outreach more than in the U.S.  It's hard to be human and not think about it.  There's a difference, too, in that here the big problem is that there are so many eager bright kids dying to learn, without any means to pursue their curiosity.  In the States, the challenge is more to motivate kids to want to learn.  A motivated kid in West Philadelphia can find opportunities if he or she actively seeks them out.

So a week ago, I got to see my first zebra and giraffes and hyenas and elephant and such in their natural habitat.

David is awesome.  And I mean David is awesome like Persis is awesome.  An amazing, well-rounded person as well an established great physicist.

I need to get back to current events and such.

And then I was back to sitting in an office by myself with a project that was suggested to me.  Except I have view of the Durban harbor as well as lots of sky, and the internet is slower.

I asked Kavi, will there be interaction with the other students?  Perhaps a reading group?  So now we have coffee at 11am every morning, and I will be presenting two of the ACT papers at a journal-club-like discussion on Tuesday.  It's a start.

I need to get a bike, but even so, I don't know how much freedom it will buy me.  It's hard to get anywhere without a car, and it's not safe at night.  I feel confined like in Chicago.

Norene (sp?) and I went to the beach yesterday.  We took the crowded minibuses to the Workshop and back, and walked btwn there and the beach.  The Workshop is a big shopping center.  We wandered around after the beach, and did a bit of grocery shopping.  You get street-smart very fast.  The color of our skin made us prime pickpocketing targets.  Keep moving, be sensitive to anyone touching or brushing your bag.  Norene put her cell phone, worth less than $5, in one of the netted outer pockets of her bookbag (usually for waterbottles), and it is now gone--more of a nuisance than anything else, since she had all her phone numbers on there, and was planning to go climbing today with someone she just met but now they have no way to reach each other.  I was fortunate not to lose anything (my important stuff was tucked safely in my waistbelt, anyway), but an outer pocket of my bookbag was unzipped twice.  It's a feeling I don't like.

Other than that, the Workshop was a delightful place, full of bustling life and bright colors and surrounded by outdoor market stands.  A refreshing change from drab American malls.  It was a tiny bit like like Reading Terminal Market surrounded by department stores, perhaps...

Oh, btw, Bro, if you have any questions about SA climbing, my roommate for the next week is the person to ask.  And I got a shot of the motorcycles parked by the beach, but it's on my disposable camera (I made the wise decision not to bring my real camera on this particular outing).  They were mostly Harleys anyway.

Friday night, Kavi said I should come here for a postdoc.  They'll have the funding, he said.  Later, when Norene probed for more of my thoughts on the issue, I said I'd have to think about it--my life is in the States, a day's flight away...although there's nothing locking me to Philadelphia or anything.  Kavi replied, your life is there, but life is out there (or something like that).  If I do come here, would you all come visit???  A year isn't terribly long, and I'd have my physics, if they follow through on having more interaction.  Need to look into the music and theater.  The outreach opportunities would be outstanding.  SA is really up and coming, a lot of effort being put into fixing the inequities of the past.  West Philadelphia won't change very much in the next few years, I think--the resources *are* there for those who realize they want them, and convincing people they want to learn is a slow process.  Lastly, of course, there's the safety issue--like Chicago, it's not that I would fear for my safety or anything, but rather that the precautions needed to be safe infringe on my freedom of movement, and I happen to have a fiercely independent personality.  So the question is, how much would having a car and/or a motorcycle fix this issue, and could I get used to working around it...   The maths dept (where cosmology is) is moving to another campus, and rumor has it that the new campus is dodgier (in South African lingo).

Wednesday through Sunday I will be visiting Cape Town.

Last night we finally got a clear night!  A bunch of us walked up the road to where it was dark.  The galactic plane was exquisite, and you could see both the large and the small Magellanic Clouds, and I can now identify the Southern Cross.  There was also a magnificent shooting star, long enough for everyone to turn around to see.  And I provided food for the ""mozzies"" as they call mosquitos down here...

I am sunburned.  We took a long hike today thru a park, about 80km away.  The mountains were unique to me, I have photos.  They were not as impressive as the huge mountains I am used to in the US and Europe, but very pretty.  And of course, new wildlife and plants.  I had the option of going to the highest point in South Africa, but my body vetoed my mind's decision to go.  Those who did go said we didn't miss much--where we were was a better view.

Bro, the following anecdote is for you: Towards the beginning of the hike, as we were zigzagging up the mt, a few of us made a wrong turn, and I decided to just climb straight up the hill to where the others were rather than backtrack and zigzag up (as the others did).  It was fairly easy scrambling--you know I don't attempt things that seem dangerous for me--but I guess it looked hard or something, because the others were impressed.  Hmm...how did I get my scrabling and climbing experience?

To get to the hike, we drove through some impoverished villages.  Lots of little shacks (""low cost housing"" I think they call it), with the roofs held down by rocks.  Friendly people who would wave to us as we passed.  There were quite a few funeral parlors, I noticed.  Why are there so many funeral parlors, I wondered?  AIDS.

And I am exhausted.  Last night, I had my first real phone interview for a tenure-track faculty position, at the University of Southern Maine.  It went ok, I thought.  It made me late for Karaoke.  They didn't have much of a showtune selection (surprise, surprise) but they had ""You'll Never Walk Alone"", so I went with that.  It was in a low key and a painfully slow tempo, so I went melodramatic with it, acting out the wind and the rain etc.  It was very fun to sing again.  And I stayed late, dancing and singing along w/ the other Karaoke songs.  (One prof did American Pie...CTY flashbacks, the beginning of all this insanity.)  It is a fun group here, more fun than most groups of physicists.  Part of this might be due to the healthy gender ratio and diversity.  The professors are also cool and were right there partying with us.

Still working on realising people better.  My thesis isolation didn't help.  I need to make more of an effort to tune in more.

My mind and soul would like to go horseback riding tomorrow at 9am.  Haven't riden in almost two decades.   My body is still deciding on this issue.

"event","First day of lectures went well.  They're putting us in groups to work on problems after each lecture!!!  They're having us interact and communicate and discuss!!!  They don't have the best arrangement yet--we have too little time to discuss most of the problems, and a range of backgrounds in each group, so we don't have time to both solve the problem and explain it to less experienced students who got very lost during the lecture, and we feel under pressure to find an answer quickly.  Basically the couple of us who are famaliar with the material end up working through the solution as best we can in little time, and the other students just sit around and watch us.  The lectures seem just about perfect for me--I've seen almost all of the material at some point before, but don't really understand it clearly yet.  So it's very useful to see it again and get another shot at putting the pieces together.  I also feel, once again, there is too much lecture.  I'd much rather have more time to discuss problems and concepts with other students and less time to be lectured at.  I'm also wondering how much ""clickers"" could enhance a summer school such as this.  Well, it was still only the first real day of lectures, so we shall see how it all turns out.  But I'm quite certain this is not the most effecient way to learn, and slightly wastes the time of both the lecturers and the students.  And I'm curious how much could be learned if we really optimized the learning experience.

They do have bike rentals!  No helmets tho, unsurprisingly but dissapointingly.  I will have to take a careful b'ride around the mountains at some point."

The landscape was pretty wild on the drive to the school.  Nine of us packed for over 4 hours in a 9 person van...was fine though.  Saw a few cyclists, and one dirt bike passed us, but I didn't get my camera out in time.  AFter we got beyond Jo'burg, the landscape was flat.  Then random mountains cropped up.  Sticking out of the endless fields, with almost perfectly flat tops, they looked man-made.  THen they became more and more numerous and now we are in (small) mountains, very green, with erroded clif faces.  I have photos.  I was quite fascinated by the mountains.  We passed cows of various colors, a field of sunflowers, corn, several tiny windmills (I don't know what purpose they serve).

Met Kavi, but haven't gotten a chance to really talk to him yet.  Students say he's very nice, but a slave driver--very ambitious expectations.  So I think this might be part of what R and L were trying to prepare me for?

Met someone from UKZN but not the Durban campus, had been at Columbia under Marc Kamionkowski, came back to SA to help develop science and science education here.  Her husband is in the education dept, and she said she'll hook me up with some 4th graders during my stay...or maybe the students who will teach the 4th graders...

Food is excellent, temperature is hot, accomodations are nice but no A/C, but I think it gets much cooler now than during the day.  People are friendly, networking is easy (but then I usually have a relatively easy time being social among physicists.)  The 8 of us Americans--6 from Penn and 2 from Princeton--are the only students from universities outside of Africa, and my accent instantly gives me away.  Many of the SA students have never left SA, it seems.  Oh, and I asked a couple of them to pronounce ""transition"" for me, and they pronounced it like we do.  They said there are different accents in different parts of SA, though.  But at least not all SA electrons need to make trancisions."

Of course, I was not in it.  And how I wish I could have been.  The director was Lance Moore, who is brilliant.

And the music recalls many forgotten emotional strings from the past.

It was the second show I saw on Broadway.  I must have been 10 or 11.  I loved the book and didn't care much for all the ghosts standing around singing for so much of the piece--I wanted to see more of Mary and Colin.
But the music grew on me.

<lj-cut>I remember making a tape from the CD for Anne, my CTY roommate summer after 8th grade.  We both loved Dickon's voice.

""Winter's on the Wing"" was my song for the beginning of 9th grade.  It was September, not spring, but things were changing for the better, and I was there to see it, feel it, breathe it.  I was back on top of the world, filled with energy.  It's my favorite song in the show.  (When will I get back to that feeling again?)

I remember recording ""Hold On"" for Christa.  I don't remember what was the rough time that was the reason why.  Sometimes, it's a good song for these days, now.

And of course I remember first breathing my own air into bringing Lily to life in front of an audience.  It was the ""Tribute to Broadway"" in 11th grade.  I sang the ""Clusters of Crocus/Come to My Garden"" duet with Jon and we added our own blocking, and it was so much fun.
That Tribute could also be considered the start of what became known as the ""polygon"" or ""web"", a tangled mess of high-school crushes and friendships, as it was when the first sparks between Christa and Jon became apparent.  It was still a month before my triangle came into existence.
And the show was the reason I was tired when I took the SAT the next morning, and didn't do as well as I could.  I had my priorities straight, theater before stupid tests, and I'm still proud of that decision.

I worked on ""How Could I Ever Know"" with my voice teacher at Cornell, and sang it in the Math Department Concert.  It must have been junior or senior year.  I still often use it as a warm-up.

""Race You to the Top of the Morning"" reminds me of my dad keeping up with my brother.

And I should bike home before I fall asleep...but I've listened to the sound track enough that all the songs are a part of me by now. </lj-cut>
Very painful not to be a part of the show on my theater's gorgeous stage.
But it was very beautiful to watch.  And they'll only get better next weekend..."

""What am I after...?  What do I want to do with my life--do I want to spend a <i>lifetime</i> on physics?  ...I feel so inexperienced at life.
Is a physics career worth a lifetime?  If it isn't, what is?  I love knowledge.  Everyone needs to devote themselves to something.  As Pippin says, 'If I'm never tied to anything, I'll never be free.'  It doesn't make a difference whether it's acting, or science, or whatever, as long as I love it and am happy.
Last year...it was all endless joy and opportunity.  I was happy, and I didn't mind giving up whatever I had sacraficed.  I didn't miss Middletown, The Lane, Tuxedo Park School.  I didn't miss my childhood.
I was happy, I knew it was worth it...
What do I live for now?  I can't go backwards, I can't turn back the arrow of time.  Must I launch myself into a new adventure?  Shall I continue to passionately pursue whatever endevors I can latch on to?  How do I know it will be worth it?  How can I guarantee I will come out on top again?
I'm no longer a child.  I can't play around in subject areas, carefree, dropping one here, exploring one there, ignoring this one, pursuing that--not thinking about where anything would lead me or where I was going.  Now I have to start making decisions.

December 4, 1995:
""There are many different ways that one can make a lifetime matter.  For me, I find meaning in thinking, reasoning, discovering knowledge and truth, pursuing areas I love searching and striving towards quality and perfection.  I will add meaning to my life by pursuing these ideals.
Is this the best way of living my life?  To that question I believe there is no answer.  All I know is that it is a way of bringing meaning into my life that will work for <i>me</i>, that has worked for me in the past...
Thinking most likely does not provide all answers, but it provides answers to questions that are most important to <i>me</i>.""

Notice I didn't mention computer programming :)
Problem is, all of the above are more meaningful when shared with others.  I need people, I need teamwork.
I also enjoy giving back to the community.  Profound insight that I can't share just doesn't seem worth it anymore.
But I still need the ideals I listed then."

"event","I must remember: if growing up were easy, it would be boring.

I was never good at brute-force discipline.  Perhaps discipline got me through some dumb high-school assignments many years ago, I don't remember.  But typically I get by, I think, by loving what I do so much, that if I get halfway to my ambition, I've managed to accomplish more than average.

So what happens when the ambition freezes up?

I learn new things...I just wish I knew what they are already.

I was never very good at patience, either :)"

Naturally, it makes me want to learn more about cognitive science and linguistics.  Reframing might be helpful in teaching and outreach--in overcoming people's misconceptions about science--as well in politics."

"event","This from a reply I wrote to Hy, who emailed me out of the blue to say hi.
Since I'm obviously still pretty bad about keeping in touch and posting updates on what's happening in my life, I thought I would post it here.

>So what is happening in my life...  I have two awesome advisors in
>theoretical cosmology.  Right now I'm working on a reply to a referee
>report from a little paper we wrote, on using large-scale structure data
>to test the law of gravity on megaparsec scales.  That was a fun
>project.  Next they're gonna make me work on a project that involves
>computer programming, which I hate, but I know it's an invaluable tool to have.
>
>On the extra-curricular front, I've gotten involved with a beautiful old
>theater downtown (from 1911).  They do mostly children's/family shows, and
>they're a great group of people.  They take the quality of their
>productions seriously, but as a community theater group, they're pretty
>laid back and flexible about time commitments, which is the perfect
>balance for me.  I've also been playing ultimate frisbee once or twice a 
>week--there are pick-up games conveniently on campus.  I'm still not very 
>good, but it's so much fun.  I've also become addicted to swing dancing.  
>And I'm still doing science outreach, of course--I'll be doing some teacher 
>training through Penn Access Science the first week in September.
>
>My summer's emotional landscape seems to be that of falling in and out of
>love, now in the ""out"" phase not by my own wish, which is painful, but the
>friendship is in tact.  (In fact I'm working with him on the
>above-mentioned teacher training.)  I've had a couple good travel
>adventures away from Philadelphia: I went to Germany for a meeting of
>Nobel Laureates and students, and while the Nobel part was over-rated, I
>thought, meeting physics students from all over and (of course) visiting
>Germany was a lot of fun.  And I just came back from a two-week Summer
>Institute at SLAC, on ""Nature's Greatest Mysteries"" (with a strong
>particle-physics and cosmology bias), which was very inspiring and also a
>great time to meet fellow students from all over."

"event","It's still April, and I can see the end of August already, coming towards me at full speed.  Must plan, organize, schedule.  Must remember stress is stupid and pointless.  So much to do, and it's all so exciting, but will I be able to do everything to my expectations?  Will I let important things or moments zoom past me without realizing?

Carl Samuelson, the owner of Stagedoor Manor, passed away last week.  Our Time Cabaret songs running through my head.  My dad ICQs me this morning, ""George Barone has something called Picks disease, like alzheimers only worse and faster.  He's not only lost his medical, he just lost  his driver's license, so the thing is getting worser by the day.""  George owns Wurtsboro Airport...beautiful cute little airport in Sullivan County, NY...he is...or was...a really great pilot and flight instructor.  He recertified my dad's CFI license just a year ago maybe?  I got to take a lesson with him once.

And life is a Cabaret, my friends, only a Cabaret.  Atoms dance an amazing, intricate dance, then move on.  Our time: Feel the flow, hear what's happening-- We're what's happening!"

"event","I went to theater camp (http://www.stagedoormanor.com/) for at least three weeks every summer from 1990 through 1996.  3rd session 1994, two friends on my floor started an ""Authentic Weirdos"" club.  Of course I was immediately invited to join.  They had come up with long, rhyming ""Authentic Weirdo"" names for themselves.  I must have corresponded with them a lot after camp, because I still remember their ""weirdo"" names...so for amusement's sake...Erika was Eponine the Teen Queen Who's High on Caffeine Makes a Scene Being the Mean, Lean, Keen, Clean (Not!) Sex Machine.  And Rachel went by something like April With Skill, With Looks That Can Kill, Sending Guys' Dicks Uphill By Their Own Free Will.  And then there was me: Quiffity an Entity Full of Curiosity About the Duality of What's Called Reality.  I'll leave it to you to ponder who was the biggest dork of the three of us.

What's interesting, perhaps, is that my basic philosophy/approach to life hasn't changed all that much since then."

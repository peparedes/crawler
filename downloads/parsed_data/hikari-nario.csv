"event","Wow it has been a long time since I have even had the thought of Live Journal. And it's been a crazy period of time in my life to boot. It's been full of travels, schooling, women, sickness, and health without any sort of cohesion or consistency, just a big mess of random events that I have struggled to deal with. I fully expect a grand total of 0 people to read this as all my friends from high school haven't posted anything in the recent past and seemed to have graduated from Live-journal. Maybe this will just be an exercise of self expression or maybe people will actually see these next few entries and continue to read. As far as I am concerned this is for me, and I love it."

"event","<lj-cut text=""To help the situation between eve and myself and all you"">[17:52] DragonTeenager: Hey Cole.
[18:02] teh Irish mUt: so y is there all this comotion online?
[18:02] DragonTeenager: ::sigh:: Ah yes... I actually was wanting to ask you about it.
[18:02] DragonTeenager: Have you spoken to Eve lately?
[18:03] teh Irish mUt: yeah, everyday
[18:03] DragonTeenager: Has she spoken much to you about anything?
[18:03] teh Irish mUt: just got off the phone with her
[18:03] DragonTeenager: Ooh! ^^
[18:03] DragonTeenager: Anything relating to online, I mean.
[18:03] teh Irish mUt: no just tells me to look at the comments
[18:04] DragonTeenager: Ah.. I'm curious how she feels about our friendship.
[18:04] DragonTeenager: Or what she thinks it is now.
[18:04] teh Irish mUt: i can't say that i don't have pretty much the same view as her
[18:04] teh Irish mUt: not to attack you 
[18:04] DragonTeenager: Oh, I know.
[18:04] DragonTeenager: No, you're fine.
[18:05] teh Irish mUt: she feels that she has been handed a bunch of bad hands for making righteous choices
[18:05] teh Irish mUt: she feels that she has no connection to the group
[18:05] DragonTeenager: The group being who?
[18:05] DragonTeenager: She has connection with Lisa and Allen still, right?
[18:05] teh Irish mUt: she feels that she is continually trying to keep the group informed about her and no one really cares
[18:06] teh Irish mUt: the group: jess, you, allen, me, vic, lisa, and justine
[18:06] teh Irish mUt: and yes she talks to allen and lisa quite frequently
[18:10] teh Irish mUt: i think if kind words were exchanged often friendships might be able to be saved
[18:11] teh Irish mUt: all we (eve and i) seem to hear out of you, vic, justine, and jess seem to be constantly negative, no words of encouragement, just judgements (that more often than not are pretty hypocritcal)
[18:12] teh Irish mUt: (i still don't want to be hurting you with this, i really want this to be a calm discussion)
[18:12] DragonTeenager: No, it's fine. I totally agree.
[18:12] DragonTeenager: (I'm not assuming your tone is angry)
[18:14] teh Irish mUt: eve is really hurt that when she talked about the church, getting baptized, being engaged, and just being happy is never responded to positively or in large part at all
[18:14] teh Irish mUt: and she is pretty negative too
[18:14] DragonTeenager: Yeah, I noticed that. ^o^
[18:14] teh Irish mUt: so as much drama is in this, she does not mean most of the things said
[18:15] DragonTeenager: What do you mean by that?
[18:15] teh Irish mUt: she takes alot of the things personally and responds emotionally instead of socially
[18:15] DragonTeenager: Yeah, well.. I'm not much better..
[18:15] teh Irish mUt: in other words she reacts to your comments, and does not act rationally
[18:16] DragonTeenager: So should I just leave her alone you think?
[18:16] teh Irish mUt: so she blames and points the fingure, and the reverse happens you become angry and retaliate
[18:17] teh Irish mUt: i think the best thing to do would be to send her an email, appologizing for whatever you think you did wrong to her, and congradulate us on our engagement, her baptism and anything else
[18:18] DragonTeenager: Well...
[18:18] DragonTeenager: I won't be fake.
[18:18] teh Irish mUt: most of all she has a lot on her plate and just needs some words of encourgament from her true friends, and lynda i hope you know she counts you as one of those (one of the reasons she has exploded this way of proportions)
[18:18] DragonTeenager: I'm sorry I'm not totally for the engagement and the baptism, but I support Eve and you all the same because you're both my friends.
[18:18] DragonTeenager: You would't want me to give you something I didn't have, right?
[18:19] DragonTeenager: Yeah, I know... it's just that Eve and I don't talk much anymore..
[18:19] DragonTeenager: Not saying that's an excuse.
[18:19] teh Irish mUt: i was also hoping that i could get if not your support at least your respect and some caring words 
[18:20] DragonTeenager: Most definitely.
[18:21] teh Irish mUt: the egagement happened very quickly, it was a way for me to comfort her, i meant everyword i said to her, i love her, i wanted her to know that, and i wanted her to have some solid commitment to lean on when she is weak
[18:22] teh Irish mUt: the actual marriage is many years away and is very important to us, that is why she wanted some kind of support and admiration from her truest friends
[18:22] DragonTeenager: But she seems to be assuming that true friendships is something else...
[18:23] DragonTeenager: I won't lie to someone about how I really feel about their actions.. but I won't abandon them for it, either.
[18:23] DragonTeenager: Unless I'm pushed away.
[18:24] teh Irish mUt: as for the baptism, if i told you the reason was for me i would be so far off, she believes it, she lives it, and she is happy because of it. i am like an added bonus and the thoughts of a temple marriage are very appealing to her. but she knows the spirit on a personal level and she has a knowledge of the truthfulness of the gosple
[18:26] teh Irish mUt: you two have different views on that meaning of friendship, she just wants what any other person wants, for herself to be supported by those she cares about, for herself to be loved, and maybe even for her friends to be a little jealous ;)
[18:27] teh Irish mUt: and may i inturn say that she wants to be able to do the same for her friends
[18:27] DragonTeenager: Bleh.
[18:27] DragonTeenager: That's not what true friends do to each other..
[18:28] DragonTeenager: I need to talk to her, of course.
[18:29] teh Irish mUt: and i would say thats what people want, anybody, we want to be accepted for who we are and who we are becoming and we want that person to be supported and loved by those we are closest to
[18:31] teh Irish mUt: of course
[18:31] DragonTeenager: Yeah. I agree.
[18:32] teh Irish mUt: do you see what i am saying here
[18:33] DragonTeenager: Yeah, I do.
[18:33] DragonTeenager: I tink Eve and I just don't understand each other all the time. Misunderstandings.
[18:33] DragonTeenager: Happens to Brandon and I all the time. lol
[18:33] DragonTeenager: *me
[18:34] teh Irish mUt: happens all the time to i too
[18:34] teh Irish mUt: :P
[18:34] teh Irish mUt: lol just teasing
[18:35] DragonTeenager: Aw man... -_- Everyone makes fun of my grammar.

[18:36] DragonTeenager: Well, I will say, the one comment you made about ""comforting Eve"" with the engagement, I don't quite think that's a good idea, but..
[18:37] teh Irish mUt: and many people agree with you
[18:37] teh Irish mUt: thank you for your honesty
[18:37] teh Irish mUt: but i meant every word 100% sincere, i love her, and i want to spend the rest of my life with her
[18:37] DragonTeenager: Well, I know that, Cole.. I don't doubt your feelings.
[18:38] DragonTeenager: The main reason it's not ""healthy"" is because it's implying that you feel it's your responsibility to make her happy.
[18:38] DragonTeenager: I mean.. yeah, this is all too familiar because I treat Brandon this way..
[18:40] teh Irish mUt: it's not that i am responsible for her happiness, it's just that when she thinks she is crap, when she doesn't believe she is strong enough to resist the temptations of her old life, i want her to know of the commitment we have and that because i love her she must have something very special about her
[18:41] DragonTeenager: Well, I have to admit that it feels like Eve is flaunting everything to do with this engagement.
[18:42] DragonTeenager: I think that's why everyone responds negatively because it *almost* feels like Eve is looking down on us.
[18:42] DragonTeenager: (I can't speak for everyone)
[18:42] teh Irish mUt: and she feels that everyone is looking down at her
[18:43] DragonTeenager: Yeah, so it's kind of screwed up. All dangled up and stuff.
[18:43] teh Irish mUt: yup</lj-cut>"

we'' since i've been home, my dad's left for iraq, i have been spending most of my time (afternoon ;p)with eve and (before noon)being a good older brother and son plus some working out. I need to find some one to go with, the only problem is not one of my friends who believes in working out also believes that there is life before noon, which really stinks because I'm not willing to sacrifice that times they believe in, nope not even for the body. I just need a partner to spot, motivate, and help me get off my lazy butt on days like today (example: my pectoral muscle is extremely sore but i want to work legs...). Blarg!!!

I am really glad i've started getting better at the older brother business, it's taken me long enough to get down. Yesterday i took emily around with me and eve, we went to old town poulsbo for some window shopping and Central Market for some food. we all had a good time, and i got to spend the day with two great blondes instead of just one. *static-y radio laugh*

Last but certianly not least, how could i not enjoy spending about 12hrs a day with my great girlfriend. I just wish i could save her from her mom all the time."

"event","howdy howdy. wow two weeks at the farm, man it's gone by fast. so what we've pretty much been doing the whole time is fixing problems, well really we've been trying to irragate the string beans but problem after problem have arisen and we've spent most of the time fixing them. this week we're going to start harvesting, thursday we started doing a about a 60 acer lot of string beans and filled about three semi's full of beans. yeah thats a lot of beans. we have a 75 and 40ish acer lots of string beans left. the rest is wheat(taking up the majority of the land we're farming, and is probly being harvested while i am typing this... well probly not since it's raining but if it wasn't today would have been the day...), corn (which still will be growing for the duration of my stay here), a couple of acers of soy beans(we'll be planting more where the wheat is now), and a few feilds of sun flowers(which will be ready for harvest by the fall).

other than that, the work is long, hard, dirty, sweaty, muggy, and exhausting, but i love it. at the end of the day i feel like i have accomplished something of significance. it's good! i end just about everyday talking to eve, occassionally the parents, tried cullen's once and have to get a hold of brenda. hey the rest of you if you want a call from me sometime, tell eve, my mom is sending me a new cell so i need your numbers, tell eve/ give her your number and i'll call you some time! that's be way cool.

well like i said it's rainning here, this is the first time since i have been here. it's usually hot and full of humidity. averaging in the high 80's and humidity in the high 90's. teh suck. the thing i hate most is getting mud, muck, and messes all over my hands, i can't stand to be very dirty for very long so that is taking a lot of getting used to. my clothes are also taking a beating, but lucky for me i get to do my own laundry. horray... i hate clothes, let's go around naked... ohh wait i'm already sunburnt enough... never mind clothes can stay on, i dont want any kind of burn down... yeah just never mind.

thus far i have earned 700 bucks and have spent a tenth of it. i live on a 35 dollar weekly living allowance(5 for food and snacks daily) so i guess right now i am hitting it right on. it's hard especially since i don't have the money or time to get vegan or vegetairian food and no time to prepare it, so i am eating meat sparringly, it's funny how i have become sick of eating something that has suffered so long under mass corporation's demands. i hate what society has done to those animals, for what, money. i said it earlier this week, big business has gone too far, because of their greed they care only about getting money, or tricking people out of theirs. industry these days is focused on giving greatly to the few at the expense of the many, the needy, and the un-educated. it makes me sick.

appart from that realization not much has put a damper on my experience out east. much of my time is spent quietly performing the tasks i have been asked to perform while meditating on my future hopes and dreams, as well as religion, love, politics, and the more important things in life. life is too short to run by in it with out thinking, but on the flipside, life is to short to just think about everything and not do anything. so i guess there will be a balance between spontaneity and pondering.

thanks for reading this, i'll be checking my email about every three days, or whenever i have the chance. keep in touch all. and leave some comments!!!!

you are all my friends and i hope to hear from you soon, and remember my helping hand is always extended to those whom i consider my friends; will if you are reading this, that includes you. 

have fun all."

this last week has been visions overdrive... on steriods... times ten... yeah thats it. all alone, i can see why it took eve a while to do it on her own, i am doing the same thing and want to rip out all of my hair. so i have the final version done, checked and rechecked for errors, can't find any. the format is down and out. this week i have to get it into printing, and then to blue sky. we're going to do it in colour this year! a visions first. the reason for doing this is that we have about 6 pics that are just absolutely beautiful in colour and just drab in b/w so they are going to have to be in colour. the edition is slightly smaller than last year's, and we have 200 bucks to make it work. here's hopping.

so thursday and again saturday, i got to go to seattle to go dancing, but more importantly see my gurl. she came down for my eagle scout court of honour, to help with visions, to help with sr project, and to comfort those who stand in need of comfort. she's soo good. well so wednesday we went shopping, bought some furniture, and played half a game with allen and lisa. thursday went ""dancing"" in seattle. that was really good. Saturday came and i found myself on the 2:05 ferry after missing the 1:10 out of bainbridge. i figured out the seattle bus system, something i have never been able to do, with the help of some great directions. watched a rag doll lesson, learned rag doll just by watching, found someone, someone found me, then ran over to a jazz/lindy hop (aka just lindy hop) class and watched some great dancing, and a beautiful girl. we then proceeded to walk to a catholic church and play in the grass, talked a bit, and got a lot of stares. lol. we walked all over seattle and talked, both of our feet hurt like mad, then made it back to where we thought we should be only to find out we were supposed to be somewhere else. backtracked and made it to the dance. eve snuck me in and we watched the jack and jill 2nd heat and then spotlights. pretty amazing dancing, makes me want to take the workshops and get really good, i just am really afraid/ uncomfortable with the fact that i could mess up. then again i could not.. ah well it's something i need to work on. so we danced a bit, her in flip flops and me in shorts, on a corner waiting for my bus. i showed her the rag doll and we still go a lot of looks. i got on the bus not wanting to leave, or to have her come with me and the rest of the night just passed by, mostly because i passed out.

thursdays coming!

corner dancing, suprise kisses, long talks, and long hugs. feel better, okay?"

Does she know i see her image in the moon?
Does she know how far that light has traveled to shine on her?
92,300,000 miles... give or takea few.
Does she know she is worth the trip.

"event","so pictures are up look under the Friends->Prom and Trips albums, photobucket<a href=""http://photobucket.com/albums/v260/hikari_nario/Friends/Prom/""> prom</a> and <a href=""http://photobucket.com/albums/v260/hikari_nario/Trips/"">trip</a>!
alright there's a bit more but we'll leave those for later, mostly stuff that would go under the photograph section.

so prom. it was awesome! i had a wonderful date, she was beautiful, elegant, charming, pleasant, and most of all fun. I picked her up at 5:30 after stalling for 30min because she wasn't ready. we took pictures with her mom and left prolly around 6. On the way to Poulsbo we listened to my favorite classy classical music Dvorak's <i>Tempo di valse</i> along with the rest of his <u>8 Slavonic Dances</u> and some of his <u>Serenade for string Orchestra</u>. <i>Tempo di valse</i> is contained in the latter of the two. Ah i love that music. anywho my date and i did some shopping, decked out in prom attire of course, at Central Market, buying lots of candy, soda, cereal, and some other non essentials. We returned to my car, parked in the ""Reserved for New Mothers"" spot on the night of prom, yeah we definitely got a few funny looks. i love shopping with her, we goof off way more than shop. ah and the flirting continued. 

We ate at the Vege Restaurant in Poulsbo. Had delicious Spring Rolls, Phad Tai, Rice, and the Rama Garden plate. it was very tasty. on the way back we took the scenic route through Old Town Poulsbo, i still have to kidnap her and take her shopping there.. but that's for later. she expressed some concerns for the night, we talked about it on the way back to Mary's house, where i ran in and dropped off what we bought at the market. then off to the dance, we met allen and lisa right as we got there, talked for a little bit and then hit the dance floor. i must say that i was pretty impressive with my white guy style, and relish in the fact that i was able to make some friends laugh at my unmistakable moves. lol. slow danced a few songs, went outside and spoke with some friends, introduced Eve and then went back into the dance. well we had enough of the dance after getting pictures, about 11:30, or 2130 if that's your flavor, lol joel. anyways i had asked Brenda to dance and thus we did, i had a good time over all at the dance and after that slow dance we(Allen, Lisa, Eve and myself) took off mostly because we didn't want to stay any longer, but another small reason was that the dance was done, you know who leaves when the dance is over. We took off to Sherries to grab some lemonade and chat.

we sat and talked about some stuff for a while, had some good laughs. i can't really remember what went on for two reasons: 1)i was tired, focusing on my hurting knees and date leaning on me, 2) i had a blast the rest of the night and it kinda glazed over my memories of the two hours between Aerosmith and getting to Mary's house. We arrived, we dressed down, and put in a movie. We were exhausted so the movie was interrupted by short one snore naps, and the occasional passing out on my part. that lasted for a few hours and then we turned off movies. we talked a bit,in and out of sleep. she was so beautiful, in spirit and body, just lying there next to me, her body pressed up to mine, innocent and hopeful; keeping each other warm and talking way into the night. 6 o'clock came around and i decided it was time to leave, even though i really wasn't done and wanted to hang more. We ate toasted waffles with oreo cookie soy ice cream. very tasty but neither her nor i were very hungry. my mom called and then drove over to get me out that was funny. i got home by 6:45 and talked with my parentals a bit and then took off to bed.

the memories will last my life time, i hope the next 3 years will come and go quickly and i never want to forget. 
some memories:
listening to classical, dance, techno, and emo.
dancing to Aerosmith, both singing and both <i>listening</i> to it.
pictures with allen and lisa. 
Dancing in the road, to two of our songs and one i wanted her to hear.
eating snacks and watching black and white movies.
being alone, warm, and comfortable with one that means so much.

eh too mushy time to end, but i hope it never will. wow i am a hopeless romantic."

"event","""Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket--safe, dark, motionless, airless--it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.""

"event","Well again its been awhile but here we go. I just got home from my big long spring break experience; good stuff. I had lots of fun, lots of time to think, lots of pictures taken, and lots of discovering. 

the Friday before last, i believe it was, was the school yard heros show, really good, but it was different in a lot of ways. I felt a lot more alone, missing the past shows and the past show's company. (throwing this concert in because it seems so recent) will was there, i almost wanted him to get in the pit/ pick a fight. i was just in a mood where i didn't want to take any crap.

well now this friday we left the house at 3:30am to catch our plane leaving at 6. I didn't sleep all that night; i packed, cleaned my room, thought about prom, Eve, and life (what i want to do & where i am going in it), and ate lots of CANDY. ;0
the plane ride was good, and the rest of friday was spent driving down to Utah which i slept through. Got dropped off at In The Venue for the Fallout Boy show, watched three sets and got in the pit for two of them (Fallout Boy, and MidTown). The actor who played Napoleon Dynamite introduced MidTown, Travis from Linkn Park got up and rapped for a few, and the lead singer from the Foo Fighters was the lead guitarist for MidTown, so i saw some famous peeps. it was pretty good, and i grabbed the Fallout Boy's two cds. After that i got dropped off at my uncle's place.

Saturday morning i ran 4.5 miles with my aunt and felt really good about it. I turn into a dog when working out, get all drooly. ewhh, lol. then we, my uncle and his family and me, went over to the house he just bought to do some remodleing stuff. i ripped up carpet, installed a ceiling fan, painted a ceiling, took boards out of the floor, ripped up linollium, and move some appliances. it was a full days work but i never mind working hard for people i love. I admire them and am indebted to them for all the things they've done. so after that my uncle and i went to preisthood conference, it was really good i enjoyed everything said. then back home and out to a movie, that i consequently couldn't watch because of really bad pains in my knees and neck, gee wonder where that came from. lol, i got a call from Holly (Wolfe) and set up some plans for hanging out when i got back. the movie ended and i went to my uncle's, tried to call Eve, got here playing cards... went to sleep.

Sunday was general confrence, this was the first time i listened to all 4 general sessions and the priesthood session, we watched the morning session and then ate lunch. Was waiting for Eve to call back but i guess she forgot about it... any way we then went to The Conference Center to attend the actual conference instead of watching it. i was stoked. all the talks were really good, except for a italian member of the 70 who's accent was too think for me to understand. Then the prophet spoke and everything was good, the atmosphere of the room changed and all were richly fed by the spirit. in all aspects it was a great 2 hrs. i then went to my aunt's house and played with her daughters (5, 7 and 7) then went for a bit of a hike (mile) up to a ridge to think and get some pictures. the mountains of the salt lake valley are great. went back down, and sent a txt message to Eve, she tried to call i didn't pick up the first time, and the second time i got cut off.

The next morning we left by 8:30 to go pick up some friends and drive to Rexberge Idaho, home of the BYU-I campus. 6 hrs in the car got us there by 3ish pm and we went on a tour of the campus and then house hunting. the first place we looked at was like the cadillac of appartments and it was tempting, i wanted a different kind of college exp, so we said we'd look around at some more (even though that is were i'll probly live). we looked at some town houses and found one that i really liked but my mom was uncomfortable with me living there. We did that from 4 until 8, by then every one wanted to stop, so we headed over to the hotel. After getting there Leslie and I went to go soak in the hot tube, too bad it was broken and really cold, so we decided to jump in the pool, which was consequently very warm more so than the spa. stupid spa i dropped my cell phone in it, but all is good it works i just had to let it dry out a bit. :) we got kicked out of the pool at 10 and then went to sleep, after ordering a pizza and watching a bit of the teli. All night i was sick, it was post nasal drip stuff, pretty gross. At 3:30 i said i'd had enough, went outside and hawked so much flem, it was bad, that i wanted to puke and my throat was screaming. went back to the room drank some ice cold water and went back to bed, running into leslie on the way. lol. 

Tuesday we got out of the hotel by 9 and drove to Boise, and got there by 2 and only had a few dollars left in our budget, so we spent that on icecream at costco. lol. the plane ride home was good, leslie and i sat next to each other, looking at magazines, laughing at each other, and having a good time. i took some pictures of the view and then we slept a bit. we left the airport in Boise at 5, and landed in Washington at 5, instantenous travel, i'd like to think. that was cool, the dive home was a bit odd and i ended up listening to an ipod most of it.

well last night was an adventure but more on that later."

"event","so knowledge bowl was a lot different. the questioning was in a different format, the questions were vague and twisting, and our team was kinda out of it. oh well, the last we saw we got 12/16 in our division. but it doesn't matter we had a good time. driving down we watched chicago, good music, good filming, risque scenes, dirty dancing, and a bad moral, overall i gave it a 6.5/10, or 13/20. we got to the hotel walked around played some games in the hall, ran around, brenda and i went to the pool got in the hot tub and talked. right after that she hopped in the pool and i walked outside to the sunning deck: it's night, cold, i am steaming, the moon is bright slightly covered by passing clouds, looking at it i feel connected with the best part of my town. after spending about five min out there i go back inside get in the pool and stand around for a bit. brenda and i go back upstairs, shower, and then i go to brendas room, hang with the rest of the team, i fall asleep on someone's bed listening to my ipod. after a bit they wake me up and i go back to my room.

this morning i woke up at five, read some poe, went down to breakfast and then get back up to make sure everyone is up and running, they are, i wait around somemore and we are off. written round followed by 4 oral rounds of a lot of interruptions, breaks, and frustrations didn't help our losing status. we all piled into the car at 1:30ish and started watching the incredibles, battery died in the dvd player and so we all break out the books. i fall asleep using brenda as a pillow, didn't work too well shes a bit too short, lol. switched places with brenda because of heat reasons and fall asleep again. when i wake up next i have brenda leaning on me and my arm is over her... hello. that was nice i went back to sleep, we shared an ipod and i slept until getting home. unpacked w/o shoes and got wet feet. i hoped on the computer and talked to eve for a second just before she got off the ferry; i'll probly call her in a bit. well i am done, wasn't expecting to get home so early.. jacqui has a party i could go to, theres a pretty awesome show at the coffee'o... hrm no car and will'll be there, oh well mosh pit... 'x'

gotta go now and eat.

oh and i am now proficient at cascade juggling with three and four balls. wooo in three days, about 3 hours total start to mastered."

yoga's really great, and i am still at it, though i haven't rode my bike to a single one... and the weather is so good for it.

well i finished that bridge 2 weeks ago, now current projects, fixing eve's deck that i fell through (made me feel really fat. lol), building/repairing a fence, building a retaining wall, doing visions almost single handedly, and fixing up some flower gardens. oh hey i am volunteering at the blood bank now, as well as coaching T-ball for five year old kids.

oh and just a side note, doing my eagle scout board of review next tuesday, it got pushed back a week... makes me frustrated that i have to wait even longer than before. any ways this post has been casually aimless, need to write a more thorough one."

"event","Strange but all I want to do is sleep. All I want to do is fade into my dreams, into sleep, to just escape. I can't though, because that's the easy way out, that is what I have criticized people who drink, do drugs, and sit around for doing. I can't be a hypocrite, if I am what good am I, what value does anything hold to me. I won't just fade away. I'll adapt, growing past this and become stronger getting what I want from life. 

Life escapes from those that escape. I have been there, I have seen lives wasted, I have lived with those people at the beginning, middle, and end and one thing I have learned from them is they never really lived. Another thing that was taught is their lives were miserable, every aspect of their lives were in shambles. I won't grow to live that life, that experience is one thing I don't need to experience anymore and I won't go on to live it in the future. 

One must live life for himself. One must stand on their own feet. One must make the choice to live and after that is done one can live a life worth living."

"event","woke up this morning, checked lj and email... nothing. so instead of just moping around i took a shower, but this is now ordinary shower, you can probably guess how it is not ordinary but thats besides the point, it was in the dark. for some reason the light bulb just went out on me, same with the laundry room's light, so instead of finding out the problem i just showered in the dark; i received a veiw of life differently, stumbling around knocking things over, getting shampoo in my eye and other such nonsense. it made me feel blind, made me feel awkward, it made me thankful for my eyes and the good home i have to live in... and other such nonsense.

<lj-cut text=""weekend"">
so i went to a few parties this weekend, nothing that my friends would be impressed with, but i had fun. friday night, as was stated in a previous entry, was the talent show and after party. It was, at first, a keriokii party (heheh japanese spelling), at which i sang the i'm too sexy song. Slowly this party turned into a twister party. won; lost; lost. then pretty abruptly it turned into a beat the crap out of cole party, Eve Red you know what i am talking about. yeah so i pretty much got raped all night after that, until about 1. went home and slept my usual 6 hour shift.

saturday, i did swing at the mall, and hung around with the swinger/ mall rats/ swing-rats. lol until about 1 then i left and came home to drop off my car. i ended up going shot-gun shooting with my dad and the young men, and doing fairly decent, (31/50) still lost the high score bye two points, whats worse is the guy had never picked up a gun before and just belted out a 33/50. watched my dad shoot a bit, he's a dead eye, missed 5 out of 25, or in other words a 20/25. he's that good from all those years of dove hunting; i'll miss it, i really will. after that i went to take car of the dogs, had fun with benny and beag just kinda sat there while we wrestled a bit. went to party number one, olivia's, at 6 all the way to east bremerton. watched starwars, played some contested starwars trivia, had a rave garage, lol roasted mallows to make some schmores. at about 8 half the party left without olivia knowing, she found out was crushed so the seven other people there all kissed her on the cheek, cerina and i snuggled with her a bit, and oblivious to me her boyfriend was right there. oops i didn't know she was dating anyone. lol. watched a bit of night at the roxberry and then left to party number two, oh by the way half the party returned about twenty min before i left.

ended up losing the directions to the second party, so i went back home and grabbed an extra set i had, and dashed back out to get to west bremerton.

party number two, holly's, we danced abit, salsa and they tried some kind of ballet, ate food, built a fire on the beach, roasted marshmallows for some more schmores (the second time i didn't eat them that night), and then we just sat around it and just talked. i had a great time getting to know some people, Pam, Curtis, Josh, Jennica, and Holly all really great people.well i still kinda don't like Josh, but that's be sides the point. ended up scratching my leg so much in a spot it went raw, and actually started bleeding before i noticed i was doing it and it was hurting.  left at 11:30 so i could get back to silverdale by 11:50-ish. it was great, kind of a sit down party i always like those better than an up and around thing. i grabbed my mom and we went to the children of the nations food packing service project. i ended up sealing probly about 300 bags of rice, lentils, spice, and chicken powder stuff. woo 2 hours of that and i was not ready to go home. i wanted to stay but my mom was dying and my legs were killing me so we left at 20 after 2 am. i came home showered and got online to do my own rendition of T-or-T conversation with Eve. that took all of ten minutes, i was tired and hungry so i just went to bed.

well now i have to get on my homework, and go to a welcome home talk for a missionary friend.

"event","been up since 1, with a short nap from 3-4:30, woke up to an im message, ""im sorry."" as was i. but as i got up to take my shower, i realized i need to be a little more realistic about this. I still have hope, but now i need to be realistic as well. some things have transpired over the last 6 months, many good and many bad, it just depends on who you ask. i have lost trust, i have pleased, i have comforted, i have always been there when asked, and i have never let her down since. I cant ask anymore of her, i wont support some things she does, and i cant accept two of them, as well she knows. I cant help but want in, past all the blockades, facades, obstructions, and illusions, to know her. i cant ask this of her, it's too soon, the last guy let her down, broke her heart and his promises. I will always be there for her and i will always protect her if i can and if it is wanted. I have invested so much into this, but it's not time, the account hasn't matured yet. only time can tell, but no matter what transpires from this point on i will continue to help, inspire, comfort, and just be there. If time removes the romance from our relationship, i will be there still. If it doesn't i can offer what i now offer. we are different spirits and have different views, but we are so right when together. 

Eve don't read into my being sad, it is more of a nostalgia if anything, i am also sorry that things aren't working out between us. keep smiling that smile, and i'll sing you to sleep when i can."

starting a new routine today, seminary, school, homework at school, ride my bike to the base gym, and then yoga for an hour, coming home finishing up work, and then talking to those who i call my family. i hope it works out the way i envision, but i don't know if thats what i really want, since everything i try to do i end up ruining it. we'll see.

i am gonna try to go up to bellingham on friday, stay the night and then come back on saturday afternoon. that'd be really cool, i still don't see the problem or rather the reasoning for the problem of going. i wouldn't spend the night with Eve, i wouldn't want to chance it like that. i've been doing a lot of thinking lately, coming full circle, i am starting to re-appreciate my religion and its views. i have a personal desire to do what is right, because it feels right, and because i know its true. experience and emotions have taught me well, i have a testimony, and testify to all that ask of its truth. someday somewhere i'll be on a mission, and that will be my job. yes me in a missionary suit, with a name tag, and parted hair, think of me whenever you guys see a missionary, okay? well i am going to take off, continue to do my studies, while trying to get distracted. agh i hate IM.

"event","well it's time again for a little update. 

so saturday last week spent the afternoon with Eve, then the group at jess' place. played a little bit of yellow game, didn't feel to great about that, oh well. it made me feel like i am losing that ""special guy"" in me that everyone else sees. so i am going to get a little more conservative.

sunday <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/skyewolf26/2005/02/20/"">i asked eve to prom</a>, spent the morning with her, and then went to church. i had a good time there, learned a lot, unfortunately after only sleeping for 2 and 1/2 hours the night before (getting ready to ask eve), i slept a lot two. i was nourished and it felt good. later eve was feeling crappy so we hung and talked a little. i am glad i can be a comfort to her, i am glad she came to me, any time i am open to help anyone at anytime but eve does have a greater place than most. we had a good time and got me home 30 min past my curfew.

woke up monday, ran over to eve's, and with a tap tap tap on her window, i woke her up and surprised her. i love doing things like that, just little surprises for her. spent some time standing in the kitchen and then to work. i moved about 50-70 potted plants from silverdale to poulsbo and then helped move an office w/ all its furniture. stopped by eve's again, to get my back worked on and then went to practice swing. 

yesterday i found out that i got accepted to BYU Idaho, now i need to find out if i want to go there; spring break should take care of that, i am taking a trip there. Got a physics test back from friday and found out i had the high score 58/50, missing only two points on the whole test. Got a test back from calc and got a solid B on it. woo. so tuesday was okay. i practiced the swing routine and got a little frustrated at my 1st half partner, she cant keep beat and she fumbles over her feet a lot. i can't say i help though i give wrong q's and stop when i make a mistake. never stop when you make a mistake, because chances are no one noticed and even if they did they probly can't tell what happened. well i talked to eve for a bit. really miss her and it's been a day. lol, the chain is short, ahahaha. 

today practiced swing a bit more, got into the talent show with our routine, but to do it i had to cancel a visions meeting, well i guess i'll just get on it. listening to music and soon have to get off for homework. eve, i am copying your composition book thing, it works and they are cheap. i ran a few errands, scout shack, staples, costco, and cycle-ry and then went swimming with cullen. eve you need to learn how to swim, lol. 

BTW i had a way great time this week end, miss you all. Sorry about the shoulder allen, apparently it's gotten around the school and i have no idea how, or why anyone cares. we need to get together more often, sucks that those occurrences where everyone is home don't happen too much"

well yesterday was pretty good, got my physics done, organized about 190 songs in iTunes something i'd been meaning to do for a long time, ate a lot, picked up jennie from the airport, talked to Eve for just a min, slept a lot, and finaly i was able to donate blood (though consequently i am alegic to iodine). haha big itchy rash.

Friday was school, and a lot of me not doing my homework and getting in somewhat of a jam(i plan on making it up today!) Swing after school, muchly improved my timing skill in the flip-ege, then taking care of dogs, hanging out with Lynda and Justine and Jeremy. that was a lot of fun we roamed the mall and i made fun of Jeremy as he did me, showed off my muscles a little, and got a strawberry banana julius. we then went to Jeremy's house and watched some animations and a couple of video's on milk&cookies.com of some rubber men. lol if you've seen them you know what i am talking about. Then i took lynda home and went home to watch sisters for an hour so my mom could go pick up olivia from somewhere, i never know what that girl is doing. eh.. Went to Cullen's, made fun of <u>Monk</u>, we then went and messed around in the woods with some other friends (Sam, Kevin, & Peter.)headed over to silverdale elementary and messed around, they talked nostalgically of better days, and i listened admiring the life style i never had always being moved from here to there. i went to 4 different elementary school's, don't remember the names of the kids i played with when i was little, will probly never see them again, and it makes my past feel like a blank. i have a few memories from elementary school, but the majority of them take place right after moving to washington, 7th grade. maybe thats how i subconsciously got through it all, erasing the memories of the previous home and school, so i could feel like i fit into my new one... hrm makes you think, eh?

Thursday was Knowledge bowl, meaning i missed a day of school. we had a good time, scored a total of 104 points, 3rd in division and did fairly well. funny thing happened though, our sophomore team did better than my team (senior/2junior) up until the very end. aw well we still beat them, but i was hoping to do better. i went to sleep at 4 right after getting home and slept until 1, couldn't sleep any more so i called Eve, we talked for a bit, decided it was time to stop so she could get to work, got off the phone and went back to sleep until five. 

wednesday was wednesday.

and i can't remember or could care less what happened on tuesday and monday, so i am not going to put in the effort to remembering what i did on it, except for saying that i missed someone. 

so favorite things i did, phone calls in the night, hang out with friends, and think a lot."

"event","Well today was exceptually good, but I don't want to talk about today, because it was well just the same old stuff. What I want to blog is what happened after school. Right after school ended, I went to the computer lab and tried to help Brenda with a problem, key word is try, it was a tough problem, but I just couldn't see where the flaw in the code. I realized all that I that I have changed in all aspects of life since last year, but mostly in my mental state. I see things differently, though not nessicarily better in my view. I am working on a lot of things right now. Well, I went to Swing Club and committed myself to yet another thing that will take up too much of my time, I am a sucker. Ordered a wristlet for Jacqui. Stopped at chungs, and ordered a 1/2 order of tofu; um tastey. So when I came home my family was going to go catch a movie, <A href=""http://www.workandtheglory.com/"">The Work and Glory</A>. Okay here's the next part I want to talk about; I went with, and must say that it is one of the best and accurate movies that I have seen about my church, excluding the <u>Testament</u>(about <U>The Book of Mormon</U>) and the new Joseph Smith one, both put out by the church. If you want to know some of what went on in my churches foundation go watch this movie (I suggest the other two also, but the testament can only be seen in Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah; the other give me an address and I can send you a copy. So much of that movie is good, it is worth watching if all you get out of it is the information it contains. Anyways thats my two cents, and now I have to go talk to my parents about a week from now. Youth Temple trip tomorrow, can't wait. I'll tell you about it and Tolo tomorrow night later."

"event","So I just think that I have made the biggest mistake I could have made in my cercumstance, and it should be made known that I full well going to accept the consequences as they come. I was given information that was shared with me, for me, and not many others. I betrayed the level of trust that I had and now I am getting the shaft. Well I hate to sound so vulgar, so the repercussions are coming and they are going to be pretty bad. I realize that I am doing exactly what drove me insane with my last relationship, becoming to buddy buddy with a parent. I feel so bad about what I did, and even when sharing the information I felt terrible, should of been some kind of foreshadowing. To me whats worse is I tried to avoid the questions, with some bull crap and then end up giving myself away and telling the truth of the situation, making everything seem worse. I know what I did was wrong, and I know that I look pathetic, and I am sorry. Its been done, it's out of my hands, and the truth is off my chest.

Honestly I was only trying to protect that which is most important to me. I was only trying to get an outside opinion of what I should do, I thought wrong and now I am going to have to take responsibility for my action. I admit I screwed up big, but I am willing to do what ever it takes to right this wrong. Now I just have to figure out what it is."

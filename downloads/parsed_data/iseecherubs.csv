"event","the new job is going well.

I teach in point pleasant but it might as well be pleasantville.

all is well, but I hate the commute.  it isn't super long, but it's too many stoplights for my tastes.

shit I don't know.  I miss three things

1. skateboarding

2. poetry

3. junk-food


women come in a close fourth, but for a moment at least, I feel like a new wave feminist asexual business woman.  I'm ""focused on my career"".

wow. scary.



goodnight, I have to teach history  tomorrow.

but shit, I'm off weekends.  and I am still writing here and there.  hell it's not a bad gig.  with that big new paycheck I can buy some wine and a new bukowski book.  fan fucking tastic.

oh speaking of good reads, rainer maria rilke is fucking serious.  I love the german right next to the english translation.  I have a moderate background in german.  there's something simplistic about it.  in a hemingway bukowski way.  cuts to the quick.

also bought a dylan thomas book.  that guy could put it down man."

"event","last night: went to a comedy club in new york.  lots of laughs with the friends.

I think I want to get into the game.

I can make you bitches laugh.



new york is like.. I mean I always tell people I dislike new york.. and compared to philly I do.. but new york isn't so bad.  except for that whole ""city that never sleeps"" thing.  so many fuckin places were closed.  and that's the bottom line.  but yeah, I had a good time.


oh yeah, so about the job.  it's in point pleasant.  for those of you not from new jeru, think small beach town with small classes of white surfers.  brand new classroom in the new wing of the school.  only thing is, it's only a temp. job for three months.  I'm covering for a woman who is out on maternity leave.  it is at full pay with full benefits, but short term.

it's not really so bad.  I get my foot in the door, I'd be first in line if another job opened up there, and of course there is always the possibility that the woman 
i am covering for will decide not to come back.  women can't really tell until that baby is in their arms.  plus the woman is married and her husband has a good job from what I've heard.  here's hoping she gives birth to the cutest child in the history of children.


and piss dude, I have like a week to get ready, and no one has told me jack shit about what to do or how to do it.  apparently I am teaching american history 1 to all of my classes except one, which is american history 2.  I do have several honors classes.  which is good in that the kids are good, bad in that I have to know my shit.  I haven't been told anything yet about lesson plans or curriculum or course overview or anything.  I go to new teacher orientation tomorrow.  I hope they explain some of this shit to me, but  I'll probably just get thrown to the wolves.  oh well it's cool.  I bullshit well.

time to go to shit job. a few days left before real job starts."

"event","So at NPS, I wasn't in with the ""SPRING BREAK!"" crowd, and admittedly I wasn't completely getting it.  I went up to Shappy one night and asked him why he and others kept saying it.  He looked at me like I was from another planet and said very matter of factly:  ""Because it's funny.""  He then proceeded to take ice that was offered to him from Matty and myself and throw it five stories down onto people's heads... I didn't bring it up to him or anyone else again.

So after NPS, I start thinking about it more and more, and it starts to get funny... I mean firstly, It's nowhere near spring break, secondly, the poets at NPS are about as far from the meathead man / sorority slut girls gone wild constituency as one can get... that's irony.  Thirdly..  In a way, NPS sort of is a ""spring break"" for poets.  Fourth, it's just fun to yell a random drunken battle cry.

So, here's what I do out with my friends:  I drop it.  And it goes over...  and I get laughs, and it catches on.  And it's getting drunkenly yelled all over by everyone.  By the end of the night it's the battle cry.  And damned if I didn't just totally steal it from NPS but not a damn one of my friends will ever know... tehehehe.

I mean you lose irony points yeah... my friends are the type who would actually go to spring break and be in those asshole videos... but it's still not spring.  And yelling out spring break is still pretty funny when you're drunk.

We're going out again tonight.  If I can still get everyone to join me, or perhaps even if it gets uttered independent of me, then I'll know I've really gone and hacked a winner."

"event","I know I'm one of the last to wrap up my thoughts on NPS, but I wanted to speak my mind:

1- My team is a family.  E, Liam, Fran, Matty, I love y'all so much.  I have come to be a huge fan of all of  your work, and an even bigger fan of your friendship and company.  I couldn't be prouder to be affiliated with all of you.  E took her written poetry and turned it into something powerful, an experience, and movement. She is great for a rock and roll convo at any time.  Liam is talented for days and I respect him very much.  I look up to him in many ways.  Fran is one of my favorite people to have a conversation with.  He's pure, he has no ego, and he's got guts, ideas, and he is a true student of the game.  He takes things in and learns, he's the guy I love to listen to.  We could write some amazing group pieces. Matty is one of the most talented people I have  ever gotten to know.  I am a huge fan of his poetry, his performance, his mind, his energy.  He's my idol in a lot of ways.  Matt made me feel like a close friend, like my opinion, my poetry, my thoughts mattered.  And finally, Beverly, I couldn't ask for a better coach or friend.  You were full of love and excitement and positivity and energy.  ""God Bless""

2- Our entourage is top-notch. Hannah, Meg, Morg, Chrissy, Kristen, thanks for making us feel like we were worth it.  All love.

3- Delrica - can you get any fucking cooler?  Hanging with you was one of the best things about nps.  Much love.

4- DC/Baltimore - I love you all so much.  Pure talent and love and friendship.  Sonya controls crowds, Kim made me cry, John is as humble and modest as can be when he's good enough to not be at all, Chris is a man who's work I have loved and remembered since the first time I ever heard it, plus he's a sweetheart who has never failed to hug me and let me know that he appreciates whatever positivity I am sending his way, and Christian, well Christian changed the way I looked at a lot of things, his poetry is hugely inspiring, and I am a huge fan who still can't quite act normal around him.  He's the man.  Thanks guys for taking team Delaware under your wing and letting us be in your entourage.  Catch the thunder!  

5- Meeting Twain Dooley was an amazing experience.  He is the definition of cool.

6- Meeting Tony Brown was special, and one can tell why he is so well-loved.  his personality is infectious.  One can't helpbut like being in his company.

7- I met Roger Bonair-Agard in the tattoo shop.  I was so star-struck.  He was such a friendly,cool guy.  I'll never forget how nice he was.

8- Team Minneapolis was so fucking cool.  Shane is a funny dude, and they were all forever gracious and friendly.

9- Buddy Wakefield kicks much ass.

10- That guy who did the ""cover poem"" of Bon Jovi's ""Livin' on a prayer"" was fucking hilarious.  He had the whole place wailing it at the top of their lungs.  Now that shit was fun.

11- Da Minista's ""Crack"" poem is fucking hilarious.  He's such a cool dude to hang out with too.  Much love for that guy.

12- shit, I forget her name, but that slam-master from Seattle who read the ""Oh Canada"" poem in the slam-masters' slam and alsso hosted finals, is pure sexiness and talent.  Her glasses were gorgeous, her hair, her perfect voice, her dry sense of humor... god was she ever great.  huge poet crush.  One of my favorite people to listen too.

13- my other crush was on a volunteer who had that guiness toucan tattoo.  She was sexy.  She was also a judge for our second bout and didn't score us too well. so it goes.  I wish I would have at least tried to talk to her more, but I was too scared.

14- Ragan Fox is fucking funny.

15- The Hotel Blue was unequivocally (sp?) cool.

16- Poetry Tag on the first night outside our hotel was hot, especiaally doing our group shit with the guys.

17- Albuquerque.  What a beautiful, cool fucking place.

18- Shebagate: what a shame, but it can't wreck the experience for me.  See Christian or Chris August's journal for more details.. I tend to agree with them.

19- I got a tattoo.  XO.

20- Anis Mogjani (sp?) is so fucking cool.  I loved having fun hearing him.  YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN A DIRECT ORDER TO ROCK THE FUCK OUT!

21- Some ofthe poetry annoyed me, some moved me, some made me cry, some made me lauggh, some was cleche, some was truly original.  Verdict?  I'll be back.  I'll write more, I'll perform more.  I've caught the bug.  This is a part of my life now."

"event","too much shit is going on to even tell you all how cool it is.... this is poetic paradise.  We placed last in our second bout.. again.   but whatever, very very strong readings of Eat and Die by Matty and Perpetrator by E.  The group piece ""Cleche Good"" as we sometimes call it also went well.  we went against almost all black urban teams, and while their poetry and ours were very different at times, they were very very talented and it was an honor to share the stage with them, even though we were coming from such different places.  Everyone gave each other respect.  Anyway, overall we came in third to last I think, beating another rookie team and one wwho had been here before.  I'm extremely proud we were even able to get here and represent.

Beverly rocked out running with scissors in the slammasters bout, it was lovely to see her finally get some of the spotlight she has so graciously made possible for us to enjoy.

Hannah also rocked out pregnant pause as a sacrifice poet in one of the early bouts tonight.  Awesome to see her on a national stage. she deserves it.

fuck man, too much shit, too much great shit.  Hanging out with Tony Brown, Twain Dooley, Delrica, Nick Fox, Da Minista and many other kickass poets and supporters from kickass teams.... everyone is here!  

The main focus now is DC/Baltimore.  We love them, they are our friends, AND THEY MADE THE SEMIFINALS!!!!!!!!!   We will completely support them in every way we can.  This could be their year.  They are ever friendly, supportive, gracious, and talented, and we all wish them the best.  Can a bitch win?  Yes.

I feel like I am leaving all this shit out, and I am...   I don't know what else to say.  I stayed up all night and here I am this morning on no sleep.  Tonight shit should get really wild.  God, I'm out of my mind right now. lots  of booze and sleep deprivation and I'm having the time of my life.




ps - well, sort of... there are a couple of problems, but they most likely won't fully explode until this whole shebang is over.  I'd tell you more if I knew you.  or me.  or anything.  maybe this is the calm before the storm.  maybe not... poetry is madness and so is this event, so in a way it'll be good to go home and settle a few things. like my relationship that ended but didn't really end... and... yeah me.  my life, whatever.  I also have some friends to talk to.

pps - I think I can do this slam thing... seeing the best of the best has inspired me and showed me what it takes.  I think I will have it one day.  I will work toward this.

ppps - delrica accidentaly posted her post under beverly's lj name... so in case some of you Del heads thought we made semis, we didn't, it was dc/baltimore.   rejoice for them.  also pray that delrica recovers today because she almost fell asleep into her waffles this morning.

pppps - praise jebediah"

"event","Well, here I am at NPS.  The flights were cool, we were all sitting together for the most part, and there were some fun people sitting around us.  Liam eensy weensy spidered his contortionist self into an overhead compartment as we were getting off the flight to Houston.  Liam also bought a cowboy hat for the 10 minutes we were actually in Texas.  Only Liam.

The weather here is nice, last night it was cool dry and breezy outside, it was actually cooler outside than in the rooms.

The only problem about this place is thaat it appears to completely shut down after midnight food-wise... We were all starving last night callling every pizza place in the phonebook, Matt and I went on a skateboard/scooter food hunting mission to no avail, and for fuck's sake, no wawa/7-11?  Come the fuck on.  The funny thing is, I think that Dominoes may have been shut down just by the poets at the hotel blue ordering so much of it, because they were still open but just stopped answering their phone or being very rude if they did and telling us to call another dominoes.  basically I think they ran out of pizza.  Yeah literally.

The place is gorgeous though, the downtown area has some cool-looking bars and clubs and resteraunts (which I'm sure are wonderful when they're open).

Hotel Blue is just an amazing place... They definitely got the memo on the crowd they'd be getting.  6-7 people skinnny dipping, beer and whiskey bottles all over the place, loud hoots and hollers at all hours of the night, and no one seems to care.  The staff here hasn't stopped smiling.  The only people here are poets, and I guess they figure just let us do our thing since there are no vacationing families with 5 year olds here to complain.

I'm still very starstruck.. I can't help it.  Oh look, Buddy Wakefield, Oh look, Zork,  Oh look, Chris August, Oh Look, Taylor Mali, Oh look, Rachel Kann, Oh look, Corrina Bain, Oh look, etc etc etc.  They're all here and it's so surreal to be among them like it ain't no thang.  

Opening Ceremonies will commence soon.  We have something sexy planned which we'll start practicing in a little bit.

And finally, things are being said here that have never been said before... so I shall now start the 

""SHIT YOU NEVER HEAR"" list.  Two entries so far:

1- ""Please get out of the overhead compartment.""

2- ""There's a Jackson Pollock painting in my cup.""

"event","I had a shitload of fun at practice last night.  we pretty much ran every poem, ran distraction drills, and worked on blocking.  The distraction drills were all fun and games until I got up on a table and was about to do a striptease during Fran's poem and the table collapsed beneath me, sending soda, poems, papers, pens and me all over the floor.  Amazingly, Fran kept going.  Awesome.

Two minor problems:

1) I'm down to like ten chapbooks and I need a bunch more for NPS to trade and such.  I've totally slacked.  Amy, if you're reading this, do you think it's possible for Brian to make a chapbook not from disk but just by copying an existing chapbook?  I forget if you guys have one, but a bunch of people down there have my book, so I figure this is doable way to get like 50 or so more printed up before tuesday.  I'm good for the money.

2) I forgot  to get those business cards made up.  Well, not forgot, totally slacked again.  I'm gonna sort that one out on my own, maybe I'll get creative wwith some homemade ones, or maybe I'll just go get some done around here.


Aside from that, things are dandy.  The team is rockin' and it's gonna be a great trip.  

Oh yeah, I'm typing this from my new iBook.  It's sexy as hell.  Can I get any more hip?

Hmm what else..

I had a pretty cool time with Kelly and her family on the boat, good dinner, good times.  She just moved to jersey city... so I won't be seeing quite so much of her.. just weekends.  But that's cool.  Anyway, she's been really busy with moving in and everything, so we haven't really talked this week. I left her a message and then she left me a message last night.  I don't know what's going to happen with us but I like the sound of her voice.  Part of me says don't panic and part of me says I'm due for a heartbreak.  Again.

My dad just had gallbladder removal surgery.  He's out of it in the living room right now, but I think he'll be good as new pretty soon.  I was glad I decided to drive home last night (early this morning) and was able to talk to him before he went in for surgery.  I told him not to be scared.  He's usually the one who takes care of the rest of us with all our surgeries, but this is the first he's had since he was my age.  I could tell he was nervous.  Hopefully he'll feel a lot better now.

Anyway, my mission for today is to get my allergy shot (since I can't do my usual Friday morning shot tomorrow because of my golfing excursion), and then later to go over to Dave's house and transfer my massive music library from my pc to my mac using my iPod as a portable storage device.  It's gonna take two trips because I have more music than the pod holds.

Anyway, sorry this is long. Peace and love."

On Friday I am playing golf with some fellas from work.  I can't remember ever truly sucking at golf, but I've never played on an actual course more than once.  My experience is limited to mostly driving ranges and miniature golf, but I am looking forward to this challenge.  Of the guys I am going with, roughly half are beginners, so there's no pressure.  We're playing 18 holes, ass-crack of dawn, the back nine are the hilly nine.  My job is to find clubs to use, smuggle some beer in the golf bag, and have a good time. 

Then some more work..  then

I took off the seventh.. just because.

I took off the eighth, a guy from work is having a party, should be rad.

and the ninth, we leave for albequerqe. can't wait. 

additionally, later in the month of august, a big bunch of us from work all took off to go to the poconos (sp?)

Rows of condos and birds as helicopters

 like guns and flies
 
 Take her down to the river

 take him down to that goddamn river
 
 Full of visuals and half wit harlequins
 it's full of smiles and laughter
 we'll weed them out like dandelions
 and your arms like batteries and you arms
 are chandeliers bought a ticket to 
 the picture show to rip down feelings
 move these walls inside myself 
 i lost my car keys underneath
 the palm tress and city lights
 avert my eyes to move northwest
 This is a poem, a combination
 of a sentence broken up to form
 a rhythm. you are a poem little pieces
 of my senses broken up to form an image

<lj-cut text=""on poetry"">

things are going well with the team.  yesterday we did a poetry workshop/presentation for 10-13 year old kids at camp imagine.  good times. we even had elizabeth and matt compete in a mock slam which they got to judge.  they were surprisingly into poetry and many of them read their own pieces. it really struck me that these kids didn't think poetry was stupid... I mean I know it isn't, but when you speak of poetry to non-poetry people, teens/adults, I think the feeling is sometimes that poetry is girly/stupid/pointless/etc.  But these kids were at an age where they were fascinated by it and they (boys and girls alike) asked some great questions about what it is and how to write it and we got to give them advice and it was all very rewarding I thought.

team unity is in effect.  drinks at the deer park before the reading last night = good times.  team delaware is made up of a fascinating group of people.  we even all drove over to deer park together in a van with no seats in the back.  emo band tour-esque for a moment to say the least.

rolled out some new shit at the slam.  not really super psyched on either of the pieces.  the since I've been home one wasn't even a readable piece I thought, but I guess it went alright.  I've been wanting to mention wawa at the mic for a long time so at least I got to do that.  the SES one was an ok idea that could have been better executed, but at least I finally finished it.  probably best to not use it at NPS though, which sucks cause I had hopes of doing that.  I guess it's just silly.  Leave the racism poems to those who live it.  I was just trying to make an observation on how it's degrading to change the way you act to fit in with another group, but that poem will be horribly recieved.

anyway the bottom line is I need a new piece before new mexico and both of those failed.  back to the drawing board.

<lj-cut text=""on girl"">

things are going beautifully.  we've hung out several times and we always have fun.  usually the conversations go late into the night.  on friday we are going for sushi with friends, and on sunday I am going out with her and her family on their boat.  it should be a good weekend.  I am majorly digging this girl, and it's a very high-school thing to say, but I'm wondering when she becomes my ""girlfriend"".  we aren't kids anymore.  do you even discuss it at this age?  or is it just assumed? hmmm. 

</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""on the job hunt"">

I have an interview for point pleasant tomorrow.  I already interviewed there once for a temporary job, but they just recently had to fire a 23 year old history teacher for sleeping with his 15 year old student... so lets just say there's an opening and they want to talk again.  good luck to me.

</lj-cut>

and today?  well right now I am playing midnight club on xbox because I remember rich mentioning it.  I have to get up and drive downtown soon to try to get an official transcript from udel.  then practice tonight.  fun times.  I am considering driving back tonight, but it depends on how I am feeling later tonight.  I just got off the phone with Kelly too, my weekend can't get here fast enough."

Delaware was in the house, bitches! Jebediah was praised and Baltimore was confused about it. Perfect.

Some interesting judging last night. As everyoe has been discussing, it seemed that these judges didn't want to laugh, they wanted the heavy stuff, and that's cool. I felt for our team, it was a positive thing to go through to help with strategy. For instance.. do you keep up with the heavy stuff in hopes of getting those high scores that heavy stuff is getting? or do you figure that they are gonna want to laugh sooner or later and break them open? It's interesting stuff to think about.  I do think the judges were relatively consistent last night, and that was good. It's about all you can ask for.

I am a big fan of a couple of people on the DC/Baltimore team, and I have the utmost respect for them, so it was cool to be on the same stage with them and put on a great show. I felt that Matt and Elizabeth's poems were performed the best I have ever seen them, and it was satisfying to know that even though we didn't win, our team brought it. Beverly has us rockin'.

One more thing: Slamicide has beautiful girls in the audience. And lots of them. From my position seated directly next to/behind the mic, I had a superb view of this. In a related story, I think I may have been flirted with after the show, but I could just be imagining things. Beverly said I may have had my first semi-groupie experience and more may be to come in New Mexico. This shit is sirvious. I knew the points weren't the point."

"event","The date went extremely well. The club was easy to get to, the comedian was funny, and the food was good.  The drive home was interesting... I won't say exactly how we got to this point but let's just say I recited ""Lady Indians"" for the former cheerleader on the ride home upon her demand. Many of you should get a kick out of that. The conversation was really great on the way home and I felt myself opening up more, just as she was.

It was still rather early as we approached home, so, despite the fact that I felt like a skeeveball from Elimidate for a brief moment, I asked her if she wanted to go in my hot tub. (Honestly, I didn't want to just go somewhere and get coffee, I wanted to be in a quiet place and just keep talking to her) She agreed. She's cute as a button.

It was a very good night. there was the hot tub, pool, grass, walks, poetry, conversation, trees, hugs, and...

well it was a good night.

Now, all this being said, there are still several things that might pose minor problems for her and I. However, for now, I prefer to bask in all this niceness.

-B

ps- Beverly if you're reading this I didn't fuck up the poem once. And believe me, reading it for her was  more than a minor ""distraction drill"" excercise. I'm focused, baby."

I had a friend with me and she was very impressed by the warm, friendly nature of our reading and by the high-calibur, eclectic group of poets who read. Probably the only thing that could have made the night any more well-rounded would have been if Bob had read something. Which reminds me, the ""Dirty Little Children"" feature is going to be off the chain, the heezy, and the meatrack for sheezy. Need to take off work and come down for that one. Will we see a multiple voice piece from the trio?? I'm putting my request in.

Beverly has been running some great practices and the team is starting to rip it up hard.  DC/Baltimore should be a fun one on Monday. Still trying to overcome my almost unnatural admiration of Christian Drake in order to be able to focus on what I need to do for my team...

Speaking of my team, I really am falling in love with everyone's personalities. I couldn't be prouder to be able to say I teammates with these people.

"event","It's funny.  I was thinking for the past few weeks about how perfect it would be to get my tattoo done in new mexico at NPS.  After all, I'd have free time, a supportive group of friends to go with, and a good story to tell. 

Today I read Christian Drake's journal and apparently he's getting a tattoo done in albequerqe as well... ALONG WITH A RUMORED 60 OTHER POETS or so.  I mean let's face it, everyone has a tattoo these days, and sure, you had to figure that a week of drunken debauchery at NPS would spawn a few new tattoos, but goddamn.  They were talking about which parlour to go to, getting a group rate, etc.

So much for my ""original"" idea. 

what the hell, I want one. I'm getting it anyway... 



(if there's any available time slots ::sheesh::)


oh also, on the subject of Christian Drake. I think he's fucking awesome. I read his chapbook and livejournal regularly, and he's one of the few poets that makes me feel starstruck. after he featured at word dancing a while back I tried to friend him on LJ to no avail. guess he didn't remember me. so my new goal is to meet him again at the scrimmage with dc/baltimore and get that man friended.

on the subject of that scrimmage, how terrifying. what if christian drake thinks I suck? wow. those people are so good, the dc/baltimore poets. I want an eighth of their talent. but what am I saying? our team will hold their own.  after all, we have matt mcdonald, my other poetic hero."

"event","So my blind date was last night, and wonder of wonders, it actually went well. She's well-spoken, friendly, funny, and honest. She works in finance for a company in north jersey, and she's much smarter than I am when it comes to money and business. That being said, she actually admires the whole teaching thing and wonders if she should have gone that way herself. We talked about everything from music to movies to donald trump to our parents to overly-skinny actresses to snowboarding to poetry to world war two. I feel like I did well and the conversation was easy and flowing. She's slightly more ambitious than me but I admire that. I want to travel more: she travels a lot, I want a tattoo: she just got one, etc.  She sort of inspired me to maybe get my shit together and be more of an adult.  At the same time, her parents are almost identical to mine in a lot of ways, and family is very important to her.  So it's like independence with a strong home base. We had a good time. We both agreed to go to a comedy club next. I mentioned I'd like to go and she was like ""well let's go then!"" bam. done. wow. that was easy. eh?

Since this was all set up by a bunch of middle aged mothers, I'm sure the phones will soon be ringing and the grapevine will soon be rippling with what she thought of me and the date, so at least I have the advantage of probably getting some information from her camp soon. I'm hoping for good news. I'm usually very hard on myself, but dare I say I think I came off well this time?!? dare I say I kind of like this girl?!? ack!

"event","- This week - getting set up on a blind date by my mom's friend.  I think you hit a certain age and everyone panics that you're single.. people other than you.  anyway, this girl is beautiful, because I used to live in her neighborhood when I was younger and I remember her, though I've never really talked to her. so of course, I'm immediately put off because she's pretty and that's scary.  also the idea of being ""set up"" with someone is ridiculous because you start off the relationship in a context of ""dating"" before you have even met the person or become friends.  plus I think if you were to grade me on first impressions I wouldn't do so hot. I get better with time. but basically she's looking for a ""nice guy"" or some such thing and my mom's friends all think I'm the bees knees so one of them recommended me to her like a topical acne cream that four out of five doctors recommend. 

so the way it works, my mom's friend told the girl about me and the girl wants to meet me so I have been given her phone number.  so now I have to call her, set something up, figure out what the hell to set up, where to go, and how to be a ""catch"" and all that sort of thing. and its pure pressure.  

I mentioned the girl's name to one of my friends and she was like ""oh.. she was a cheerleader in high school. I remember she was always happy."" oh boy.

so that's what I have to go on.  but I have to do the damn thing as a courtesy to my mom's friend whom I really like and wouldn't want to hurt. has anyone ever gone through something like this before?

Cruised the markets, encountered a music and food-laden street festival, and took a bunch of photos for the album art.  The album is that much closer to being completed. All fifty copies are burned, and now the final hurdle is to have Gavin complete the album art/cover/booklet and send it to Dave and I, who will go to Kinkos or somewhere and try to get the album inserts printed up for less than an arm and a leg. The cover is a supposed to be a gorgeous shot in color, but if color turns out to be too expensive, we may use an alternate photo and black and white the whole thing.

Also many props to Hannah for holding it down for the ladies and reading an awesome ""part two"" to a poem I really liked. Ah man the storybook love one was great too. Nigel was fucking on point. Phillip really kicks out the jams too. Anyone I didn't mention; you rock too. great fun.

Really happy about qualifying for the team. If anyone noticed, I was sort of somewhat half-memorized.. I am working hard on it. I brought up the paper but strived to not look at it. still looked. oh well. it'll get better.

It was really neat to bring my sister to the reading. I had mixed feelings. but I ended up glad I did. She was picturing some dry droning sort of stage show and she told me she was surprised at how intimate and funny and warm and lively it was. I was happy she got to see a great night.

at the same time it wouldn't be good every night. I like being alone there so I can drift and wander and smoke cigarettes (which if you noticed I abstained from in the interest of setting a good example for Jenni).  Plus, there are some things you wouldn't want family members there for all the time. maybe when she's older she'll get into poetry herself though. the seed has been planted anyway. thanks to you all for being so kind to her.

I promise I won't do Lady Indians at the next slam.. going to try some new things which have yet to be written. It'll probably still be perverted or something though. I'm a scumbag. I won't say ""dame"" anymore though.

The new one about my brother went over pretty well I thought. sort of emotional to read it aloud in public for the first time... not to mention that my sister was there to see it.

Apparently there is some sort of drama, although I am not sure of precisely why. But I've been perusing some journals, and I have been reading things. I hope everyone can get over it. it's too good a thing we have going on tuesday nights to have it get like this.

I thought Beverly did a good job with her strict adherance to IWPS rules. It's not popular all the time, but it will benefit all of us in the long run by allowing us to be more cognicent of the rules and allowing us to step up our games to the next level. Beverley is making us legit. I can dig it.

sometimes we need it.

this evening no music or tv has been on in the apartment, which is a rarity.  dave and I are sitting around reading short stories by hemingway and raymond carver. sort of switching off between the two. we all know hemigway, but have you heard of this carver fella? he's nice with it. 

but anyway, the quiet is a little strange. I feel very mellow.... it's nice. usually I need the noise, but not tonight for some reason.

tomorrow I take the praxis 2. basically its like the bar exam for teachers. if I don't pass it, I can't get a job in new jersey. I'm an excellent guesser and I probably know a little something of history so I am hoping I can pass it. if not I will be dissapointed in myself, but not too much. I'll just curse out the test makers and study for the next one. I am not studying for this one. I think you either know it or you don't in a certain ways.

this is also the first time this week I haven't drunk myself to sleep. I seriously have gotten drunk and passed out every night this week. it isn't healthy, but (and try to follow me here) I think it's been good for me this week. I have realized that if I start drinking when I get home from school, it's possible to actually pass out by 9 pm and sleep soundly until the alarm goes off at 5:30 am the next morning. this has worked brilliantly. When I don't drink, I stay up way too late. I don't get tired and I can't just lie in bed and try to make myself sleep. it doesn't work for me.

I drink too much. most of my friends know this. but damned if it hasn't helped me settle into a workable routine. As I once heard someone say: ""everyone always says 'oh, he's an alcoholic, he doesn't do shit' but what if you were an alcoholic... that got shit done?"" and I think there's a little truth to that. I have gotten to work on time all week, done what I had to do, and even recorded a new song with dave (mid-drinking evening), and made two new friends. alcohol is your friend, kids."

2- Been to see a band in concert and loudly yelling out a song name and mispronouncing it repeatedly and having the band members repeat it the way I said it and mock my mispronounciation onstage.

3- Seen an opera in the Sydney Opera House

4- Had a girl describe me in this manner: ""He looks like Dawson from Dawson's Creek, only, like, ten times uglier!""

5- Sung a chorus concert solo in Hebrew

6- Have someone who was actually cast as my lover in two different musicals and then end up actually sleeping with them.

7- Thrown a goldfish cracker down a girls shirt, gotten the cracker back from her, put it in a plastic baggie. seeing this as a sign from god. end up dating the girl a few days after the goldfish incident. saving the cracker for the duration of the relationship.

8- Gone to a halloween party and bedded Little Red Riding Hood at the end of the night.

9- Played golf in the rain with a lover.

10- Been in a rap group in high school.

Rest In Peace Hunter S. Thompson. Its strange, I am currently halfway through Hell's Angels.. now I have to finish it knowing he's dead. I know it doesn't matter, but... it still does somehow it seems.

In other news, I have been working on the chapbook I plan on putting out just for myself. I have the poems chosen and the order about right, as well as a neat idea for the title. I may try to do some copy machine hijinx with the copier at school and create my own... but it that doesn't quite work out I'll probably be going to see azureoceanlight about it.

"event","Yesterday was a good day.

Dave and I saw a trip that our dorm advertised as a trip to Washington, DC for the day. 5 Bucks. Decided to do it. As we were getting on the busses, a guy had his girlfriend with him and she didn't go to udel. she was pretty. We got on the bus and away we zipped. The neat thing about reading collections of short stories on a trip such as this is that you can point out cool parts and swap stories and read and discuss them. Dave was Reading Dubliners by James Joyce and I was reading In Our Times by Hemingway. Good stuff all around.

Funny thing: Dave and I must have looked pretty funny sitting next to each other: Both with beards, both with beanies, both with ipods, both reading books. Was it Twin Day?

There was a beautiful girl. more on her later.

In Washington, we were free to do what we wanted, but we had to start at The Holocaust Museum and then we were free from there. Beautiful girl and her boyfriend were on line in front of us. At first, Dave and I wanted to just sort of zip through it because we had both seen it beofre, and perhaps see some new things. However, the Holocaust Museum is so well-done and solemn and haunting and sobering.... we just had to take our time and go through it slowly again. We didn't speak but a word to each other the whole time. Seeing things like that really rips you up.

At the end of the museum there was a tour guide ending his tour with a group of people who... I dunno apparently they need people to read the displays for them? as the guide ""signed off"", the entire group (at what is supposed to be the most solemn and moving part - the ""and then they came for me and there was noone left to speak out for me"" quote on the wall) started applauding wildly and I even heard a few giggles. This fucking pissed me off to no end. To me, nothing above a whisper is even close to appropriate in such a place. EVER. 

Anyway, after the museum, we went to the new World War Two Memorial. It's very large and wonderful. I always get very emotional around these sorts of places. I noticed some older veterans with their baseball caps on that noted where and in what unit they served. Very Emotional. I want to go back and see this place when the fountain is filled and the water is on.

Then, we took a forty-five minute walk over to Union Station, where there is a good selection of eats. Ate some killer burritos. then had some Chai upstairs at the coffee place. Um.. we have to be back at the Holocaust Museum to get picked up at 3:30?? better get going. We were running late, so we booked. We made a 45-minute walk in about 25. Jaywalking, speedwalking, hustling about. We get back like a minute after 3:30 and guess what? the buses aren't quite leaving yet because one is broken down. ""but don't worry, we called to delaware and another is being sent down, should be here in a half hour or so."" ok. As it turns out the bus didn't come until about 5:30. In the downtime, I watched beautiful girl and her boyfriend.

OK, now I'll tell you about her. She was so pretty! blueish-green eyes, dark hair, petite facial features, beautiful smile. straight teeth, but you can tell they might be crooked when she gets older. I loved it. She had a turquoise hair band, grey wool peacoat, green scarf. tall but not too tall. then but not waif-like. I was really digging her smile. Her and her boyfriend sat in front of us on the drive down. looking at each other and kissing occaisionally.. then the same thing in front of us online for the museum. but for some reason, whereas in 98% of the time I'd be like ""I don't wanna see this shit"" these two fascinated me. The boyfriend seemed like a nice guy. he wasn't particularly thin or good looking or clean shaven, his clothes weren't super nice nor super bad, you could tell from looking that he was attentive to his girlfriend and that he was funny and that the two of them loved each other. he was just like... I dunno he could have been me? exactly. but they were in front of me all day in some way, and they never seemed to notice me looking. they were too in love. Rather than bumming me out or making me hate the guy and make up stories about how he's a prick or make up stories about how the girl is a bitch, I just watched. I liked it. They gave me hope in some sort of way. Love existed, it was around, and it doesn't neccessarily have to irritate the world. When we switched buses onto the one that worked, they were sitting on the side seat as opposed to the two seaters. I watched the girl get up and politely ask a girl sitting alone in a two-seater if she would switch. she did. couple wass now in a two seater. I still wasn't mad! Good for them! Damn, I must be going soft in my old age.

Anyway, what I noticed on the ride home was.... damn EVERYONE was a couple! Back row, a thin scottish looking kid with a crew-cut reddish hair, thin and white and a large african american girl. night and day. in love. next seat, a pretty girl with beautiful pouty lips and a short bob haircut. her boyfriend also had a crewcut.. surpirse: he actually seemed like a nice guy too! amazing! Asian couple #1. happy. next seat, Asian couple #2. happy too. African American couple. happy. dreaming. next couple... ahh yes, my afformentioned pretty girl and her boyfriend. how snow white probably looked. that smile. sun setting glinting off her eyes and smile. should I be watching this? the sun set, all couples tucked into each other. Dave and I discussed authors, bands, english, life, philosphy, graduating, parents, families, our idea of a good day, food, drink, life, funny things, fraggle rock, joyce, hemingway...

we got home and I bought some gin. dave and I ate fish and chips. he had wine I had my gin. it was a long day and our legs hurt. Chris Rock was on Television. We went to bed early. nothing to do sunday but write this right now. sorry it's so long. thought you might like to hear about my day."

"event","I'm really angry that I took a philosophy in film class in order to see some great movies and have a good time and all the movies so far have been ass.  here's what we've watched so far: the matrix, total recall, all of me, dark city, blade runner.  I'm sorry that most people seem to like these movies, but I certainly do not.  Let me do a quick rundown.

1- the matrix is well made.  there's good effects and its a somewhat interesting comcept.  but it isn't great, the acting is bad and overdone, and frankly, it's to far-fetched for me to give a shit. keanu sucks. this is well documented.

2- total recall has ridiculously eighties effects and ideas.  however, is followable and somewhat interesting.  arnold is so bad he becomes brilliant.  the more serious he gets, the more I crack up.  every line he delivers is like a gift that keeps on giving.  arnold has such a twisted grip upon the english language that it fills me with glee.  The funny thing about this movie is I sometimes think they stuk curse words in there just for the sake of sticking them in there. I actually liked this movie the best out of all of them. it entertained, although not for the reasons the director had in mind.

3- all of me is a steve martin movie.  I assumed I would love it. steve martin is a funny guy.  there is some decent physical comedy in this as his body is possesed by both his and a dead woman's soul.  thus he must make both halves of himself function, and there's some moderately funny things.  overall its a cheeseball unbelievable movie.  did I mention I fucking hate movies that have conflicts like this?  I know you need something to go terribly wrong in order to keep a plot moving, but I hate stupid frustrating ones like this.

4- dark city. people told me it would be good. the plot was followable.  apparently the guy who did the crow did this movie. fuck the crow. I know everyone else but me likes it.  I don't like stupid dark movies. The guy who stars in this movie has ridiculously ugly eyes and one of them was a lazy eye or a different color or size or something.  I dont think this was a special effect. it annoyed me to no end. on the upside, the leading lady in this movie was gorgeous and her lounge-singing scenes aroused me. that was good.  also, the alien-white bald guy people in trenchcoats and hats were pretty freaky and I dug them. but overall, way too dark and strange. I hate science fiction.

5- blade runner. people told me this was good. people are stupid. did I mention I hate science fiction? I figured this was a harrison ford movie. I like harrison ford. this was the one we watched today. first off, I was so tired and turned off by it that maybe I wasn't paying attention properly, but I had no fucking idea what was going on. apparently some people are clones and some are real and theres this test that tells the difference or something? some lady with a fake real snake was naked or something? I don't fucking know. I left an hour into it and now here I sit, I couldn't stand the awful sets and bad plot and bad acting and bad everything. fuck this movie I don't care how it ends. a movie should make you give a shit, frankly, I didn't.

please, I invite you all to tell me why I am so wrong. but why couldnt we watch some good films that illustrate the same concepts? The only thing worse than science fiction in general is eighties science fiction.

I'll go a step further: the only science fiction movies I have ever enjoyed were the original three star wars movies and even they werent that great, its just that lightsabers and wookies and harrison ford are all pretty bad ass and going to lightspeed looked pretty cool.


I saw one of the funniest movies ever a few days ago (The Life Aquatic) and I am angry that all movies cannot be good. The life aquatic spoiled me. I feel like I need to go watch one of my dvds now to wash all these crap scifi movies out. maybe I'll just go see life aquatic again tonight. I've gotta do something."

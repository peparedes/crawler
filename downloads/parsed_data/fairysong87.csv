So a couple of weeks ago I had this really cool dream. I was on a cruise ship that was a lot like the Titanic, with this guy who wanted to marry me. Sometime later I realized that there was no way in hell I wanted to marry this guy, so I went over to tell him that. His response was, ""To bad, we're getting married anyway, now go help set up our wedding pavilion."" WELL! I did help set it up, but there was no way I was getting married under it, so all at once I dropped my leg of the pavillion, causing some havoc on the deck, and ran like hell. Unfortunately, I was soon pursued by abotu twenty guys chasing after me, trying to force me to marry the other guy. So I ran down into the steerage quarters where I thought I was safe, untill some idiot rich girl sold me out. So I'm waiting in line to get married, and all these poor people want to thank me for my efforts to stick it to the man, and I'm so upset I just grab the first one of them and hug them, and suddenly everyone wants hugs. So there I am, in a weird hugfest of desperate soulds, when the lady who sold me out walks up. And I open my arms to her to let her know I forgive her too, but then I start to think, ""Good grief, I'm starting to feel like Jesus!""

so more happened, and we eventually escaped-without our really cool shoes- altho we had to deal with some pretty wierd talking wildlife, but fortunately the antelope at least was friendly so we made it into the woods okay, but after that....

The point is, that...and the whole CHRISTmas thing, has got me thinking about Jesus. Now, I figure Jesus probably lived, whether or not he was actually the son of God. Keep in mind, these are just fanciful ideas of mine, not solid beliefs at all. I like to what if about religion, so if you would be so kind, indulge me here.....

What if Jesus was just like you or me, and didn't really have any special powers at all? what if he had what we now affectionately refer to as ""stage moms"" or ""soccer moms?"" I guess we'd call this one a ""God mom"" and she, like Alexander the Great's mother, decided that her son was God's son. And then all these people decided it and poor Jesus just had to play along. I mean, isn't that what happens with a lot of people in history. I guess so, otherwise where would we get that silly quote, ""born great, become great, have greatness thrust upon them."" hmmmmmm. I wonder if it works the other way too....""some are born stupid, some become stupid, and some have stupidity thrust upon them."" which do you think G.W. Bush is? I'd say all three from the looks of it.

And while we are on the subject of Christmas, lets talk about love. Love is supposed to be chrismassy right? So why do people tend to break up relationships in the holiday season more than any other part of the year? I'll tell you why: the media! lol. I mean, think about it. You're bludgeoned with all this Christmas propaganda, if you will, telling you what a perfect christmas should be like; snow, yule logs, bunch of noisy kids running around opening presents like a bunch of carnivorous dinosaurs at a meat wherehouse, everyone in stupid festive clothing. So.....dun dun dunnnnnnn. what if your boyfriend is some lazy-ass skater, who used the f-word in every sentance, and hates kids, cats, and cranberry sauce? Seemed sexy in May, but he's not right for Christmas. Wouldn't suit the atmosphere the same way granny's hand made table doilies do. so you chuck him. Then you whine about being alone at Christmas. 

And whats all this crap about having to bring a date everywhere? What, are we so pitiful that we can't stand to talk to people unless they came out of the same car we did? Jesus probably didn't bring dates everywhere he went. I mean, can you imagine? ""Er...Catherine, I've gotta go to this church get together later tonight, so I can heal some lepers and make some blind men see, you wanna come? Then maybe later we can stop by my place and..."" NO! Jesus went by himself, or with his legion of half naked lackies. No dates. If we're going to idealise Jesus, lets give him two thumbs up for not being codependant...at least not that I know of. Keep in mind, my knowledge of Jesus is about as limited as vegetarian options at Kentucky fried chicken.

well, thats it. I'm bored. And I'm guessing you are too. See u later....kind of. I doubt I'll actually SEE you very much later. Especially if I go blind. hmmmmmm....to bad Jesus doesn't keep some sort of ""crap I just went blind and I need help"" hotline. He coudl have one for lepers too. Of course I'd probably catch cold if they tried to baptize me, so maybe its just as well. At least modern doctors don't dunk you under water before they'll help you....well, not much.

Any of The Arts-music, dance, pure<br>art, drama, creative writing-are your passion.<br>You love the way you can control what happens<br>to you and your life while you participate in<br>any of The Arts, and you can push your emotions<br>aside when you do so. You at times can feel<br>very depressed and alone, and yet it only<br>further fuels your love for your art. Life to<br>you can often seem bitter and cruel, a world of<br>darkness with only a few tiny flares of light,<br>stretched out far in between one another. In a<br>way youre confused with what you want in your<br>life, and find it hard to trust people. Because<br>of this people of the outside world see you as<br>cold and uncaring, yet those who befriend you<br>love you a lot, and know you are only very<br>lonely and hurting. Boys are intrigued by your<br>mysterious mask, and one day, one of them will<br>reach passed your barriers and care for you the<br>way you so desperately want to be cared for.<br>Dont let the popular people get you down; you<br>are a wonderful person, and without the<br>creativity you bring the world, it would be a<br>very boring place. Love yourself for who you<br>are, for you are very special.
<b> Boy/Girl who will sweep you off your feet: </b><br>A sweet, sensitive man/woman. The guy/girl who<br>understands your need for being alone<br>sometimes. Yet also someone who would do<br>anything to protect you for being hurt, even if<br>it means giving up their life.
<b> Your stone: </b>  Jade
<b> Your power: </b>  Dreaming/Imagination
<b> Your element: </b>  Dream

<P>I do, however, seem to enjoy tennis, if todays tennis lesson can be any judge. There is something in me that gets a huge sense of pleasure from mercilessly smacking the fuck out of fuzzy little balls.... That said, so far I suck at tennis. Those who know me should not be surprised. Nor should it surprise you that in spite of my suckitude, I am raising tennis to a new level: the level of interpretive dance.</P>
<P>Oh! I'm getting a tatoo! anyone know how expensive those things are? I haven't had time to shop around, besides, Daddy hasn't decided what its going to be yet, and I wanna get the right man/woman for the job. You heard me correctly: my Daddy is choosing my tattoo. Mom gets to choose where I put it. I didn't want her to feel left out. I'll admit that, as Daddy pointed out, it is rather odd to have your daddy choose your tattoo. But then, as I pointed out, I am rather odd too. But I think it'll be cool to have something burned into my skin to remind me of my daddy. After all he's sixty and diabetic so.....basically, I feel like everyone I know is either going to die or leaving for college. I want a puppy......</P>
<P>And I ALMOST got one. I have been campaigning for half a year now. It hasn't worked. However, I have made minor progress by the only means proven to get you what you want in my house: bawling your pathetic little eyes out. No, I didn't mean to. (I&nbsp;HATE to cry. Esp. in front of pple.) I was just bummed, cuz me Dad had been in the hospital, me wee cousin lads just left, and I said goodbye to me lovely Panda Bear for the last time b4 she went away. After crying in the kitchen (woah, the last two times I've cried have been in the kitchen....) Mum said to throw an i-ching. We did, and the i-ching basically gave me two thumbs up.....I still don't have a puppy. As far as my mom is concerned, two dogs are for rich people. Count on Mom to choose this one issue to be practical, when in all other things she is as practical as a tapdancing moose. I love my Mom. Really....I do.....seriously....I know you think I'm joking but.....yeah.....</P>

"event","<P>As the school year draws closer to its end, I do not find myself getting nostalgic, like many of my fellow students. I find myself getting increasingly demanding urges to do something other than what I should be doing. It doesn't matter if its schoolwork, chores, whatever. I don't want to do it NOW, I want to do it LATER. Basically, I'm procrastinating, and I'm loving it. I can get stuff done if I have the fear of a deadline right before me, but for now I'm taking it easy and finding fun and useless things to do. For example, my latest work of ambiguously comicishness:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/fairysong/touchthroughglasssmall.jpg""></P>
<P>I know, its a bit LARGE, but I'm too lazy to adjust the size on Adobe, and if I do it on here it gets all smushed, so I hope you can endure it. Ok, I have to finish making an army of latex aliens for my mother, after which I must not only create an entire solar system, but work on two different yearbooks that I'm making. . . procrastination sadly fading into the distance. *sigh* oh well, on with the show!....maybe in five minutes. ;-)</P>"

But, as I trust you all not to laugh TOO loudly at my attempts, I will present it to you shortly. Let me just preface it by saying that I was not meant to draw manga, and wouldn't have tried were it not necessary to do it in manga style, and even so it didn't come up looking at all Japenese comic-bookish. But I tried. I'm really more of a Marvel/Disney hand. Not so much in what I read, as what I am almost somewhat capable of drawing.

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>Have been ridiculously succesfull, through aid of perscription drugs, with life in general lately. Of course, that still leaves me swallowing exactly seven pills a day, if I take my vitamins, not counting my anti-panic pill or my lactose whatever for my lactose-intolernance. (stupid lactose) How </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>medicated am I? Very. But its cool. I've crawled out of borderline-suicidalness for the time being and have had ridiculously good time playing ponies and pirates for eight hours with ADORABLE younger sister of Bear's friend.

Also, have begun first stages of campaign to be the next Dear Abby. Wish me luck! Sorry this was such a </FONT><FONT color=#33cc00>boring entry, but I felt like doing something moderately amuzing before going to bed, and this is what ended up happening. But here's a quote from the all-time best teen movie ever, which I've only </FONT><FONT color=#3333ff>just watched for the first time tonight, ""If you start out depressed, everything is such a pleasant surprise.""-(""Say Anything"" I'm serious, its fabulous, the best, watch it....NOW!...no, no, changed my mind.

"event","<P><FONT color=#009900>So, Mum was off with the brownies today on a gs trip, which meant that Dadykins and I had the house to ourselves. I slept in till 12:00, and was rewarded for my efforts by having my first non-anxiety-related dream in months. V. happy. was an awesome dream. Although there was the angry mob chasing after me...but I sorted them out by daybreak and sent them chasing after some other scarlet criminal. ANYWAY, life was good, relaxing, and yet also exciting, because Myst IV is the most awesome computer game ever, if a little manic...except for the other most awesome computer games ever. Then Mum came home, and I GOT NEW SHOES! If you will pardon my icky and sadly un-feminine feet, and I will show them to you... </FONT></P>

The carpet colors didn't go, and I really do have icky feet, so I just airbrushed them a the weeist bit...nm</P>
<P>Next of all, in a mood of shoe-gratefulness, I did my mothers hair. Now, for those of you who do not know, I happen to be the greatest hair stylist/cutter of all time, (compared to myself.) So, I here present to you, for your cultural and aesthetic enjoyment, the culmination of over seventeen years of hair styling prep, and five minutes actual work.....</P>

<P><FONT color=#333399>I would like to mention that I also ran into some very cute chicks today, meaning the actual wee-chicken kind of chicks. Now, I was heretofore convinced that chickens were horrid brutes of creatures but now I think I may have been wrong. I think that some chickens are particularly intelligent and affable creatures. Such was Davy Crocket Silver Arrow, my favorite chick of the bunch. He was a chicken of unusual callibur. Here's to you, Davy Crocket Silver Arrow! I wish you good luck for all your chickeny days!</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#3333ff>First off, yes, I spent most of the day dancing in my underwear. The odd part is, I actually had a perfectly good reason for doing so. See, I was choreographing a bellydance routine for International Night Opening, and I was hot, so off went most of the clothes. It was a lot of fun, actually, the routine should be really cool. Mims and I both have prop solos, Mims with this awesomely huge silk veil, and me with skirt and fan work. Anyway, I hope it looks cool. You never know, since I'll be on my panic pill so I don't tweak out, and it makes me a littly dopey. But if I focus I'll probaly avoid tripping on my own feet. I luuuurve bellydance tho. Its so......FUN!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>IMPORTANT NEWS! Cirque JUST came out with a new show! It is called <IMG src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/fairysong/corteo.gif"">&nbsp;and it looks totally awesome! I saw a clip online, and there are these girls who do an aerial act on chandeliers! How cool is that? Also, they should be coming to our area around my birthday! How perfect! Assuming I'm saneish by then...but anyway, hope is restored. Varekai should be coming back soon too I think...no I lied its Cirque 2005! Yes, finally Cirque will be back! Here's a pick from Corteo!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#6600cc>Will somebody PLEASE remind me to badger my Mum more about the swimsuit I want to buy? I keep forgetting, and it might not be on sale that much longer. I know I'll prolly look like crap in it, but I must see for myself before I am satisfied. It looks so awesome. Here, I'll show you:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#993399>Also, I am toying with the idea of making my own magazine. I don't know why....I just want to. Also I have no idea what I'd do with it, subject matter, etc, but it sounds appealing. If u have an inspiration or want a column or anything just let me know. ;-) </FONT></P>"

"event","Today my house was more than usually invaded with a diverse range of pests. There were first the brownie girl scouts. Now, usually we only meet once a week, and thats plenty for me. But as international night is coming up- a muck-a-muckish girl scout event, Mum got the bright idea to meet every week this month. Now, mind you, I technically quit helping out with this troop when they drove me crazy at the beginning of the school year. That said, there is not a single meeting they've had after I quit that Mom hasn't cajoled me into helping out with. Months later, I am the hardest working ex-program aid the world may ever know. Now, this might have been okay if it weren't for the second and third pests in my life. The second is retainers. I haven't worn mine for about half a year, and then got the bright idea that maybe thats why my lower teeth no longer look perfectly in line. Suffice it to say: OW! So I didn't eat anything until 5:30 pm when I mushed a banana down with my molars. TMI? too bad. Now, thirdly, where the fruit flies. Untill now, I have largely regarded myself as a pacifist, live and let live type. As much as I would love to remain in this state, I think I must take a brief break for a small round of genicode where the fruit flies are concerned. They are everywhere in the kitchen and grossing me out beyond measure. Dad has been taking on the lofty task of genicode up untill now, but hasn't had much luck. I mean, they're basically specks with wings. So for about five minutes I stalked around the kitchen armed with a rolled up old newspaper, appologizing to the specks as I attempted to smash them off the face of the earth. I don't know if you know this, but squished fruitflies in your wall does not improve the decor, and to add to that, I've got the essence of killing on my hands, so to speak. I never touched 'em, but I still feel dirty. I think if genocode doesn't work tonight, I'll try explaining to the fruit flies why they should leave, which may drag on to scolding and guilt by Wednesday, desperate negotiation on Thursday, and having my parents buy some sort of horrid fruit fly death trap on Friday. TGIF!"

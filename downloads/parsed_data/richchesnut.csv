"event","Let's talk about babies.  Specifically babies on the telly.  They've been chewing up a lot of screen time lately... well maybe not chewing it so much as they are smoking it.  The first big offender in recent memory was the cigarette smoking baby.  He can be seen here:

http://abcnews.go.com/Health/video/smoking-baby-causes-web-controversy-10757122

But, not to be outdone, a Middletown family decided to escalate things by giving their baby a health dose of the Marijuana.  I'm not making this up, check the link:

http://www.whiotv.com/video/22963378/index.html

And the ante was upped, until some parents at a ballgame with their baby decided to claim their 30 seconds of fame with the beer drinking infant, seen below:

http://www.clipsyndicate.com/video/play/1505494/baby_drinking_beer_during_basball_game?cpt=8&wpid=1277

And thus the bar has been raised.  I'm more than a little concerned about how the bar will get raised next, but I'm sure it will.  Maybe we'll get babies on harder substances, maybe baby biker gangs raising hell, or maybe we'll get bored with babies and move on to beer drinking, cigarette smoking, cane swinging... er... pot smoking fetuses (feti?) to occupy my TV set.  All in all, it's enough to make one stand up, throw their remote through the TV set, and scream, ""What is wrong with these people? Is there something in the water?"""

"event","I entered the break room during my lunch today to find Angie, my boss, watching Judge Joe Brown.  The case involved two sisters, one suing the other for getting them both arrested on drug charges or something like it and Joe Brown being Joe Brown.  For those of you who don't know, I HATE COURT TV!!!!! So, I asked Angie if she would mind much if I changed the channel.  She said she didn't mind, so I switched it over to PBS 16-3 where a large choir and full orchestra were doing a rendition of George Fredrick Handel's Messiah.  I left the channel there and began to relax and eat my microwaved meal.

""You would rather watch opera over Judge Joe Brown?"" she exclaimed.

""I would rather watch ANYTHING over Judge Joe Brown.  Besides, this is really good."" I replied.

She spent the rest of my break expressing her hatred for opera music.  I don't get it.  I mean, I understand that opera isn't for everyone, but I never thought I'd meet someone who would prefer to watch two white trash druggies expose their dirty laundry on national television while a referee who enjoys taking cheap verbal shots at people over something is actually really good art.  Please note, if you comment and say that you also prefer court tv over opera, I may have to unfriend you.

Actually, there is one instance where I like court tv, and it's when you get that episode where one dependable sibling is suing the other for not paying their bills because they're trying to pursue their acting career.  The acting sibling has an emotional breakdown on television talking about how they just haven't received their big break yet.  I could be wrong, but the sheer quantity of this style of episode leads me to believe that the aspiring actress encouraged the dependable sibling to take them onto court tv to get some exposure, and maybe eventually a job."

"event","So, for those of you who haven't heard yet, I was told in late August that I was hired by a local news station in Dayton as a part time videographer/editor.  They didn't have a start date for me yet, but I was told that I was hired.  So, my friends and I searched for and found a very nice apartment that I'm now living in and I transfered to the Meijer in Kettering to supplement my part time status at the station.

Then, my would-be boss told me (when I called HIM to find out my start date, I don't know when he was planning to call me to let me know this) that when he went to turn in my paperwork to hire me that his boss said that the station decided not to hire for that position.  No TV station job for Tim, at least not yet.  Worse, I'm locked into the Dayton market for the duration of my lease, meaning I can't even take a job outside this area even I was offered one.

This wouldn't be as big of a crisis if it wasn't for the fact that my student loans come due at the beginning of October, and Meijer doesn't pay enough to cover rent, living expenses, and those bills, saying nothing of saving for the inevitable car repairs and other unexpected expenses.  So, if you know of anyplace, and I mean ANY PLACE that's hiring in the range of Middletown to Fairborn, let me know.  I'm currently applying at every bank, dine in restraunt, coffe shop, and pizza joint I can find.  I'm also working on getting certified to be a long term substitute teacher (I knew all those English classes would count for something) so hopefully I'll find something soon.  Also, I'm sending resumes to the remaining TV stations in the area, despite the fact that they don't have anything listed on TVjobs.com at this time.

Hopefully this will work out.  I've been wanting to move out of my parents' house for a while now anyway and maybe Rob and I can start cranking out short movies, a web series, or coordinate a feature of some sort in our massive spare time.  Anyhow, on a lighter note, I'm hoping to have a housewarming party within the next week or so I'll keep you guys posted on that."

Anyhow, just to give you an idea how tiring this is, let me give you an example.  After being in class almost continuously from 10-4 today, I went to work from 5-11.  Around my last break I was a little tired and grabbed a cup of coffee.  When I sat down to drink it, I guess I dosed off or something.  Anyhow, I woke up when I spilled my coffee all over myself.  I wore brand new pants today too!"

Well, I'm sad to say that from now thru November 7th (at 5 PM) I'm going to be that guy.  I will get on your nerves, I'm sorry.  But I need your help for a contest.

AMC (the channel American Movie Classics on cable/satellite) is currently hosting the ""Your Greatest Fear Contest,"" inwhich contestants enter in movies that are less than 60 seconds in length and represent our greatest fear.  I've shot my video and turned it in to them.  It should be viewable on their site by tomorrow.

The way the contest works is this:  You (the viewers) have the ability to vote once per day, per IP address for you favorite videos.  No registration required unless you wish to comment on the video.  The top ten videos in terms of quantity of votes will then be judged by a panel which includes Rob Zombie.  The winner gets four thousand dollars and their video exhibited on television.

So, starting tomorrow when my video is viewable I'm going to begin a bi-daily, beg-a-thon.  I'm going to try to post two bulletins daily encouraging you to vote for my video.  I don't need to come in first place in terms of votes.  I just need to be in the top 10 to be judged.

Also, you're allowed to vote for more than one video, which brings me to my pal Brandon Delph's video.  We both entered the contest, I would also like to encourage you to vote for his video in addition to my own, but if only feel like voting for one, I'm a selfish bastard and must request that you vote for mine.  Besides, he's been up there longer and has a 20 vote head start on me.  If you'd like to vote for Brandon's video you may find it here:

"event","Okay, I usually agree with the things that are said by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, and I kinda use them as my source for news instead of real news, but I kinda have to argue with a point they were both advocating during their most recent episode.  The idea in question is the issue of ""electability.""

Basically, both Stewart and Colbert attacked the idea of electability as being meaningless.  They advocated that the Democrats are making things too complicated by using super-delegates instead of the popular vote, arguing that the candidate that gets the most vote is, by definition, the most electable candidate.

The problem with the popular vote in the case of primaries and why the issue of electability comes into play has to do with with who actually votes in primaries.  Usually, only the most conservative republicans and the most liberal democrats vote in primaries, as the people in the middle don't want to declare party loyalty, are the ones who vote in the primaries.  These are the same guys who keep saying, ""Oh, I'm independent,"" as compared to the loud people who make their loyalties known to everyone.

So, when it comes to electability, what the democrats are really saying is, ""who will the middle of the road voters be willing to vote for?"""

"event","So, I made the Dean's List for the Winter Quarter here at WSU.  Nice, especially when you consider that not long ago I was on academic probation for having less than a 2.0.  The difference:  Beer is my friend.  My increase in GPA is directly proportional to the amount of drinking I've been consuming.  Remember, beer is the key to success!

I'm taking a class on short story writing this quarter, and it's definately the highlight of my week.  It's funny, I've been writing almost exclusively scripts for so long now that I almost forgot how much fun prose can be.  The number 1 advantage:  No budget constraints! If I can imagine it, I can do it.  When writing scripts, I'm constantly asking myself, ""How much would that cost? When will I find the time to shoot this? What if my actors can't reach the level I want? Who will work crew? Should I keep these characters gender neutral just in case I can't find someone of the right gender to play them?"" all these questions that get utterly and totally dropped while writing in prose.

But, I've got another sketch comedy on the way.  Most of it is shot and I've got a rough cut together, now I'm trying to decide what I want to reshoot.  It'll probably be hitting youtube soon enough."

"event","Hey, I have a new reason as to why I'm not voting for John McCain for President:  He's the reason why the rematch UFC between Ken Shamrock and Dan Severn was so shitty!

Don't believe me? Look it up:  The year was 1996.  It was UFC 9, and the Ultimate Fighting Championship was broadcasting from Michigan.  At the time, I was a martial arts enthusiast well into my Tae Kwon Do training, and couldn't get enough of the UFC.  I was also a big Ken Shamrock mark at the time, and couldn't have been happier when Shamrock choked out Dan Severn at UFC 6.  To prove that the win wasn't a fluke, they scheduled a rematch at UFC 9!

Then along came Senator John McCain, who fought hard to get the UFC banned.  The day of the show arrived and it was only allowed to continue with modified rules.  The most ridiculous of which was that the fighters were not allowed to hit each other with closed fists under penalty of jail time.  This resulted in the lamest dancing slapfest ever witnessed in UFC history.  Youtube it if you don't believe me, the two fighters just circled each other and slapped at each other for 20 minutes solid.

So, John McCain, you messed with my source of entertainment years ago.  Now you shall pay the price by knowing that I will vote for the Democratic candidate... unless it's Hillary... then I'll grudgingly vote for you... but if it's Barack Obama then you will rue the day you crossed the UFC!"

"event","Here, Keith Olbermann takes an editorial approach to something that has been pissing me off ever since I found out it existed.  I'm referring to the FISA extension that would grant immunity to any Telcom Company that assisted in SPYING on US in the name of catching terrorists.

<lj-embed id=""22"" />

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F1cP8oDuyo&feature=related

When the ACLU challenged the extension, calling it unconstitutional, the courts threw it out on the grounds that the ACLU couldn't prove that anyone had actually been spied on.  The ACLU appealed this all the way to the supreme court who... refused to look at the case and refused to comment on it.

All right.  Bush, you don't have to spy on me to hear me say this:  Fuck you, you manipulative, lying, fascist, piece of shit! You have no respect for us, you have no respect for our rights, and you have no respect for the sovereign rights of other countries.  You campaigned as man who was for protecting the rights of your citizens and keeping the government out of our lives.  You have expanded the government to an unprecedented size and beat the living shit out of the constitution to the point where posterity may never recover from it!

Spying on us? To me, that's grounds for impeachment or possibly even jail time for you.  Course, since you're at the end of your term and this is just another infraction in a long line of you over stepping your bounds as President, it will most likely go unpunished.  And, since so much of the way we interpret laws is based on precedent, any future President can stand on your shoulders and justify his or her actions of violating the American people in your name.

John McCain, the Ohio primary is around the corner.  If you want me to vote Republican, you'd better do something to make me believe that you would rectify this, otherwise I'm definately going with Obama!"

I found this out at Meijer helping someone who received a Western Union from someone in Canada, and I learned that one Canadian dollar is worth about 1.03 US dollars.

You know, Michael Moore's movie SICKO almost convinced me to move to Canada, due to the nationalized health care system, and this isn't helping matters any.  All I can say is:  Thanks, Bush!

(course the Canadian oil helped too)"

Tomorrow I got nothing.  No work, no class, no filming, no thinking... well I am way behind in my studies, my laundry, and WWE is having a PPV tomorrow night that I'll probably catch over at Cadillac Jack's, so I won't be completely bored.  But, I'm glad to finally have a day off.  I'll probably sleep till 3 PM!"

"event","I have an odd problem at work... it looks like I might getting forced into a promotion that I really don't want.

Basically, the next step above working the service desk is to be service coordinator, a job which basically entails ordering the cashiers and baggers around, counting tills, and getting verbally abused by upper management for the check lanes being backed up or the parking lot overflowing with carts (despite the fact that this is a budgeting problem instead of a leadership problem).

Truthfully, I have no problem with doing the extra work.  I even think I'd be good at it.  The problem is that there is NO RAISE IN PAY for doing the extra work.  Because of this, I've made it fairly obvious that I have no interest in the job.

Well, I was basically told today that I am going to have to cover the service coordinator's break tomorrow, and I don't have a choice in the matter.  Now, I know what you're thinking:  Covering one little break isn't going to be so bad, is it?

The problem is that I don't believe for one second that this is going to be a one time only thing.  If I show that I'm willing to bend on this once, then they'll know that I have breaking point and will schedule me frequently on a ""one time only"" basis until I'm a service coordinating regular.

Then they tried to sell me some shit about how it's the service desk worker's responsibility to cover the service coordinator's breaks.  Please, I've worked Meijer since 2004, been on the service desk since 2005, and I have never even been asked to cover the SC's break before.

The only positive I see with the service coordination position is that it is just one step away from management.  I really don't want to be a manager either, but there's always the possibility this whole making movies and writing books thing won't work out for me and I'll need to make enough money to support myself."

"event","Another update on Benoit murder/suicide

by Dave Meltzer

Sources in the Fayette County Police Department are now working under the theory that Chris Benoit killed Nancy on Saturday, son Daniel on Sunday, and then killed himself earlier today.

Benoit was found dead in his weight room. Nancy was found dead in the living room. Daniel was found dead in his bedroom, accordig to an unnamed source in the department.
_______________________________________________________

I can't fucking believe this! If it's true, then every last ounce of respect I had for Benoit just went up in smoke!

I'm not saying I condone killing your spouse and then yourself, but what kind of sick fucker kills his own seven year old kid?!!

It just doesn't seem right.  Benoit was a very level headed guy, almost to a fault! I can't believe he would be capable of doing this!"

"event","I secretly hope that Chris Dodd will win the presidency in 2008.  However, that's not going to happen and I know it.  So, I'm slowly trying to come to terms with the candidates with chances (Clinton, Edwards, McCain, Juliani, and Obama) and I can't I'm truly happy with any of them.  I guess I'm most for Edwards since I shook hands with his daughter back in 2004 when she visited WSU.

However, a very conservative buddy of mine posted the following about Barack Obama.

""Probable U. S. presidential candidate, Barack Hussein Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Barack Hussein Obama, Sr., a black MUSLIM from
Nyangoma-Kogel, Kenya and Ann Dunham, a white ATHIEST from Wichita, Kansas.
Obama's parents met at the University of Hawaii. When Obama was two
Years old, his parents divorced. His father returned to Kenya. His mother then
married Lolo Soetoro, a RADICAL Muslim from Indonesia. When Obama was 6 years old, the family relocated to Indonesia. Obama attended a MUSLIM school in Jakarta.
He also spent two years in a Catholic school. Obama takes great care to conceal the fact that he is a Muslim.
He is quick to point out that, ""He was once a Muslim, but that he also Attended Catholic school.""
Obama's political handlers are attempting to make it appear that Obama's introduction to Islam came via his father, and that this influence was
temporary at best. In reality, the senior Obama returned to Kenya soon after the divorce, and never again had any direct influence over his son's education.
Lolo Soetoro, the second husband of Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, Introduced his stepson to Islam. Obama was enrolled in a Wahabi school in Jakarta.
Wahabism is the RADICAL teaching that is followed by the Muslim Terrorists who are now waging Jihad against the western world.
Since it is politically expedient to be a CHRISTIAN when seeking Major
Public office in the United States, Barack Hussein Obama has joined the United Church of Christ in an attempt to downplay his Muslim background.
Let us all remain alert concerning Obama's expected presidential
candidacy.
The Muslims have said they plan on destroying the US from the inside
out, what better way to start than at the highest level - through the President of the United States, one of their own!!!!
ALSO, keep in mind that when he was sworn into office - he DID NOT use the Holy Bible, but instead the Kuran (Their equevelancy to our Bible, but very different beliefs)""

I was suprised that my buddy didn't go one step further and accuse Obama of being the anti-christ too! The idea that someone could even think this burns me up inside! I mean, this is a perfect circle of paranoia, because nothing Barack can ever do will convince this person that Barack isn't evil incarnate.

On one hand, this makes me want to vote for Obama just to spite this person, but it also further convinces me that Americans are far too racist/paranoid to elect Obama.  All I can say is this depresses me off to no end."

"event","It seems that everytime I read the Guardian, WSU's student newspaper, it's always overflowing with letters from pissed off people saying, ""You completely misquoted me!!""

So, a few Guardian reporters asked me my opinion of the Quad God.  For those of you who don't know, Quad God is a guy who hangs out on WSU's campus and screams that everyone on campus is going to Hell.  The reasons range from listening to rock and roll, to having a gay cousin, to having actually held a conversation with someone of the opposite gender.

So, the Guardian reporters asked me, ""What are your thoughts on Quad God?""

I'm quoted as saying, ""It's satire.  I'd jump next to him and yell at him.  You can't argue with people like that.""

I don't know about you, but that quote doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Did I just say I wanted to yell at the guy while saying that arguing with the guy was futile? Did I say that Quad God was really doing some witty satire or something?

The answers are:  Kinda and no.

What I said was, ""I've always wanted to jump up next to him and parody him, saying even more ridiculous things.  Then, he'd start yelling at me and we'd have a 'You're going to Hell'athon with each oher.  It'd be satire because you can't argue with people like that.""

So, I suppose I could write to the Guardian and tell them of their error. . . nah! I think I'll just have a Coke and Jack instead."

Clicking on a link that scrolls you further down the page doesn't count as a click, as a click has to take you to another page."

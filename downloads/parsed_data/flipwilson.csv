"event","man, this song is stuck in my head, that ""are you happy now?"" song by michelle branch. it's great, i really dont care if it's stuck in my head. it reminds me of me, alex and krista at her apartment. you see, when we were there, we were playin that song alot becuse its so tight. well, krista brought us up to her sunroof on the top of the building, outside. we got up to the railing and looked out into the city, and with that song playin and the wind blowin in your face, it so felt like we were in a music video or something haha. for real though, it was the coolest feeling ever. i love the city so much. im gonna live there sometime (i know i say that all the time but its gonna happen). im going down there on saturday with a bunch of people for the taste. its gonna rock my socks off. 2 more days and a final left in the summer school life. urgh! i cant wait till im free again! im prolly gonna start drivers ed and get a job. w00t, rock, owwwww, mercy! sooooooo bored.....ok, time to read. im out for now."

"event","whoa......last nite was crazy. so me and alex went with krista up to her new apartment in chicago yesterday. we missed the 4:52 train so we took the 5:45. urgh! oh well we got there and had to walk awhile cause that one station thing burned down. oh my god. krista's place is amazing! its on michigan ave. and it is so awesome. the view is so great and the sundeck on top off the building.....just unbelievable. i love chicago. im so gonna live there someday. no lie. so here was the conflict: my parents wanted me to take the 8:45 so id be back at 9:30 (for some reason) but that was too early i wanted to take the 9:35. so my dad wouldnt let me but my mom said ok. we went to starbucks (she has one rite across the street! damn you krista!) we walked around and went back to her place. we hung out, played guitar, listened to music and all that shit. then we had to catch the train. krista said she was gonna come back with us and go to some party at her house, and she   had   to put her make-up on! we had 10 min to catch the train. if we missed it, i was dead. i was already gettin home at 10:45. oh yea, i needed to get home so early because i had summer school next morning. (there now it all makes sense to you guys haha). we ran out the apartment and flagged a cab down. we were cursing at this chinease guy to go faster   it was so fun haha. anyways we made it just in time. and got back right on time. (did i mention i was studying for a test on the train? haha) ok here comes the fun part. i had 10 min to get home and we were in oak forest. about 25 min. later we found out we took a wrong turn and have been going the wrong way the whole time. we were all the way in the back of orland for all of you who live around here. yea, thats hella far. i called my mom and she was pissed. i got home at like 11:45. urgh! when i walked in i didnt say a fucking word. my mom was like go right to bed and i just walked upstairs. today she didnt seem mad until i asked her about it. she was blaming it on me like it was my fault. now, i didnt want to point fingers but krista told me over and over it was her fault but ya know it was an accident im not mad at them at all or blaming anyone. accidents happen. all i can say is ""im sorry"" to my parents and if they want to be unfair and come up with some bullshit excuse to punish me....well than fuck it. ill take it. my moms being all ""anti-nick"" and not even talkin to me at all today. and she said my dads gonna prolly talk to me too. that will be tons o' fun. this is all blown way out of proportion. i dunno. things are just messed up right now and im confused because i had such a great time.....but then that happened. ok thats way too much typing but thats pretty much it. ill update this when things are back to normal. im out"

"event","i used to have a crush on you, and i kept telling myself i didnt anymore. but then i heard your voice...and that old feeling came back. i keep telling myself i cant have you...but i cant stop thinking about you. i keep saying ""nick, it would never work out""...and it hurts me everytime i think about it. i love your smile, your personality, your sense of humor, just you in general. i find myself falling for you more and more everytime i talk to you. im going to ted's lake house this weekend and he's assured me that ill meet a couple girls up there. maybe that'll get my mind off of you. i really want to get over you...but i cant. dammit, teenage romance is a bitch. i hate it. i just want that feeling like somebody cares for me in a way that i care for them. ive never met anyone like you.....and it kills me. dont get me wrong. theres a part of me that wants you to know how i feel. but im still not sure. i hope when you read this you know who you are."

"event","hey hey. whats crackalackin? nuthin much hurre. i had experimentals on friday and camp training this weekend in chicago. experimentals were awesome. i was told i did really really good (and not just by my parents haha) so that was fun. training was semi-boring, semi-fun. i saw all my friends so that was cool. lots of fun stories from our fun time with polariod pictures to bekki calling me and aaron ""shady characters,"" haha. but in a way im still upset by that. it was fun but by the end everyone ended up getting mad at me and aaron for stupid reasons (except that one where we were an hour late to breakfast, whoops) yea so i got back today and went up to my moms school with her and talked with momma. krista moved in to her apartment on friday and me and alex are going up to baker's square with her tomorrow (that's the chill-axing tight buisness eating spot for us three owww!) im planning on sleeping in for a mighty long time tomorrow itll be my first of the summer. then going out to eat with alex and krista and then im getting my guitar! woot! (haha aaron) man although i may seem in a good perky jumpy mood i got really quite mad and depressed about an hour ago. i was on anti-flag.com and read something about some anti-gay church that has a website called godhatesfags.com and so much shit ran through my head and honestly i almost started crying. just like, the ignorance and hatred somebody can have against somebody else, for example gays, is unbelievable and the fact that they bring the church and organized religion into the picture and that this man (the reverend) is a respected man in the community is disgusting. kids are being brought up on hatred and are being tought to hate homosexuals. i think thats bullshit and for me, it's hitting uncomfortably close to home. im sorry i just needed to say that. thanx for listening to my bitchy rant. im listening to the smiths and thats making me more depressed now so im gonna go bed. goodnite"

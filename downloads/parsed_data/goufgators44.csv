"event","sorry for the no entry in the last however long, i've been... busy?? nothing really happened in the last week. basketball is going well. we're 3-0, playing against incredibly nice teams. ha. i dont even try to shoot. it's just not even fun. we get two high school jv's next week then the furies. what a stupid name. has anybody ever thought about that? you're the forsyth angries. and your mascot is a horse. 

ate dinner tonight with luli and jim sanderford. can't really figure out what the technical name for me being related to them is. luli is dad's cousin, making her my ???. anyways there the biggest left wing nut jobs anywhere, and it rekindled my hate for georgie. ok, not george himself, just what he stands for and that it got him elected. think it doesnt really matter? all you teenage right wing nut jobs beware, cause troops arent out until at least 2009. why not do this. if you voted for bush, you or your kids should get to go to war. isn't it fair?

anyyyyyways. deacs won and are looking pretty good. hopefully we won't implode and go on one of those 4 or 5 game losing streaks like last year. can't see that happening though. 

no real news in the life of bfm.. katie is fly as a 727... basketball is still cool. till next time, remember that if it comes from a fish, it's probably not milk"

"event","wow.. we are bleeding from where we got it stuck in us.. over, and over, and over. talking about wake btw, for those of you who may be females. i mean i know everyone's going to be like OHHH WAKE LOST HAHAHAHA OHHH WAKE LOST. cause our school is full of 8th grade douches that like to think they are cool when wake loses. but really, its kind of a helpless situation for me. i wasn't there. I didn't play. I didn't miss wide open three's and play no defense the entire time. so robert, feel good cause your team won. but everyone else.. you didn't do anything, neither did I, and if you go to our school and are an 8th grade male, who cheers for carolina, you probably suck at life. 
ok, ok, not probably. but anyways.
basketball is ok. the short people still think they have to shoot all the time, which is all fun and good, but robert and i are gonna be the ones putting the points up this year, so they may as well get used to it in practice. but seriously, practice is the biggest waste of an excuse for physical activity. i ran 2 or so miles afterwards today, and shot for a half hour or so. wow. come on pwood. ok, its over now. 18. not nearly as bad as it could have been, but still, we took it up the shady. too bad. 
ok so im helping this kid in 5th grade out with his organization and staying on top of everything, and its somewhat rewarding but so frustrating. he just doesnt want any help. ""man, i dont need any help."" i think it's because everyone else in his class is there when im helping him out, before school. but he doesnt get there early so i cant go down there at like 7:45.. oh well. im to bed soon, long day. party hard but remember, you don't gotta be hard to party"

"event","first basketball practice was today- thats always interesting. it went well for the most part, except im not tired. not even close. we just dont do any conditioning. its kind of sad. no real playing suprises. robert and alex and eli are good. evan is bad. i was feeling it, which is always nice. sorry that i don't ever write in this thing, i just don't get around to it. hung out with friends for the most part this weekend.. fun, also for the most part. stephen and I were going to walk home from Lily's, but my mom freaked out, so we drove. we probly would've gotten raped by hot women, a couple of sexy guys like us.
mrs. lezzine is freaking crazy. so i havent finished my spider-man collage, and she's about to hunt me down and kill me. she wants me in there with all the girls during dance committee meetings, slaving away. study hall hellloo?
tabor vs. reynolds tuesday.. wow.. future school vs. bryan's current. and their gonna bang the hell out of tabor too. sad. maybe bry will prob get to play some too. reppin the white crew. 
wake at illinois on wednesday.. gonna be off the chain. hopefully wake will win, so that they'll win and so that robert cant yell at me.

"event","long time, no entry. i kind of suck at keeping this thing updated, i'm sorry. i made the basketball team!!!! haha for those of you reading this who don't know, it's an 8t and ninth grade team, and ninth graders are like guaranteed on there, plus I was last year. so yay. some questionable calls on who made it and who didn't. carter? evan? cough$cough. 
Thanksgiving went well, hung out with the family, pretty good time, ripped up on dad and bry in some poker, it's all good. 
got march madness 2005.. somewhat addicting. ok ok, very addicting. the sad part is the game's not very realistic or all that cool, it's just so fun to drop 31 14 and 10 with chris paul. speaking of chirs paul, we got 'zona tonight, hopefully he'll actually shoot. it's kind of frustrating when we get past half court and he passes if off and we waste 32 seconds before putting up some crap shot. if your name isnt justin gray or chris paul, don't randomly shoot. chris has gotta be the 3d man, drive, draw, dish. wow, i can't believe i just said that. january 15.. carolina looked crazy this week, we need to step it up before then. big ups to mccants to actually putting  up 25 without saying he was in jail or something else stupid. but really though, they do look good. before i ramble some more, im gonna go. so peace. and remember. if you see any pink bears playing cricket, you're probably drunk."

Anybody besides me ever wished they had a twin? That'd be so tight tho.. someone to fight with and rag on and play basketball with. I was talking to Julia about that the other day, and she was like, ""Yeah, but what if they were prettier??"" Sad. Romeo prologue is the coolest thing ever... not.
Florida beat Florida State 20-13.. shove that up your rectums. School monday and tuesday, then im out (suck on that, public school kids). To bed with me, sorry for the stupid entry"

Checked out Florida this weekend with Bry, hung out with UT and AL, coolest uncle and aunt tandem out there. caught the gators winning 48-14, C-Leak through an NCAA 2005-like 6 touchdown passes. He's the man. Chris Paul ripped up GW on Monday, can't wait to see him give it to baby blue number two (rhyme, btw). tom was like ""oh, he got crossed up."" but then again, he dropped 25 and 6, so, deal with it. End of the sports report. Saw the ""comedy"" today. Felt real sorry for Ross. And Mr. Lovett's daughter. Wow. I'm about to go to bed, sorry this entry sucked"

"event","Going to Florida tommorow afternoon to hang out with Uncle Tom, the best Uncle in the world, and Aunt Lindsay, also cool, and to watch Florida play South Carolina (gulp). Who knows how they'll manage to let me down this time. 
If I had a quarter for every time Patrick Caldwell shot today, I would have a lot of money. He scored, but it's not hard to score in open gym, which for now, just consists of casual scrimmages. Its abotu getting everyone envolved, especially from a point guard's standpoint. According to halko-Mihalko, I'm a 4. But then again, the man's biceps are bigger than his brain, which would still allow him to have a pretty big ass brain. Sad. Anyways, I still have to write my OP, which is kind of contradictory. Having to write an ocassional paper. Seems useless. There goes my chronic complaining again, but forreal, I'm livin lovin', lovin' livin, it's all good.



That is a Will Smith lyric, for those of you keeping score at home."

"event","Sad song.. that guy shouldn't let his girl bitch him around all the time. Break up with her all ready. 
   So there is this seventeen or eighteen year old senior kid at Reynolds high school. I dont know if he has a name, I'd assume he does, but I don't know it, and it's not important to the story. Anyways, as many of you know, one of the reasons I'm going to Tabor is so I can play basketball and still have time to act, something I couldn't do at Reynolds due to the exclusivity of the basketball program. They basically have practice every single day of the year. Back to the nameless wonder. Like any other highschool kid, he's got hopes goals and dreams that he wants to accomplish. In what's his name's case, his goal is to play highschool basketball for Reynolds. In his four years, he's never missed a work out, never missed a sprint session, weight lifting session, anything. His dedication is paralleled only by a select few. 
But he gets cut.
Over
and over
and over. 
He was cut from the ninth grade team.
Determined to work harder, he got cut from the JV team his sophomore year.
You guessed it, cut off the Varsity his Junior year.
So maybe this was his year. Who knows how many miles the unmonicered man has logged, giving up his body for the love of the game. 
Tuesday, final cuts happened at Reynolds High school. The kid wasn't on the roster. Bry said he shrugged it off, but was somewhat disappointed, maybe even mad. But in truth, we all know that when we don't get something we want that badly, anger is  not present, but sadness. Think of how the poor kid must feel. 
There are a few problems with this situation. Something like fourteen people tried out, not including football players. How hard would it be to just take the kid and stick him on the end of the bench? You're ranked 18th in the nation in the preseason ap poll, but one guy would definitely bring you down out of the top 25. Right. Mmm hmm. Sure. 
Another thing, this makes me think. Whenever I've tried something, in general, I've been able to do it, and mostly, do it well. I can't imagine giving myself up for that long with no reward. I feel sorry for the kid and grateful for things I'm lucky to be able to do. So should you. Peace"

"event","Really, it's 6:39, who wants to do homework? This is almost the worst kind of homework. Because all it is is to study and ""learn and know."" Don't do that to me. I got people to talk to and basketball to watch, don't tempt me to procrastinate. Summit summit summit.. summit has this whole college thing, where they think our ninth grade isn't good enough, that's why everyone leaves, so we've toured wake (that's to-er, not toor, as julia thinks), then today we had this college essay thing. i complained about the relevancy, and got called a bitch. but really, i see how it could help some kids going to boarding school, and i'll probably take something from it eventually. but the people i'd complain to are brains anyways. so it's all good, but if you have to do it, why not complain about it? i'm rambling 'in a mug.. voice today, rocked the party, found my audition song, which is nice. saw miriam, good lady. can't wait till wake whips on those orange dudes from illinois december first. go fighting indians.. anyways, I wonder what Janet would say if she read this??

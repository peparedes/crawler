Either way, yesterday and today my back is reminding me WHY I was going to the gym, and G and I have worked out that in addition to Monday mornings (since I have Mondays off), I will also hit the gym Wednesday and Fridays AFTER work. I need this. I like being able to move.

I have begun my first toddling steps into gilding. I missed a couple of steps, but what worked, looked sort of ok. It was more Frankenstien-y....but hey. I tried. And then Googled and also chatted with my Laurel. I shall try again. With smaller target. 

G and I are doing ok for what we are dealing with, the family budget is in serious straights, but hopefully soon things will be back under some control with me working. He even wants to plan a vacation for the summer. But that remains to be seen if it can happen. Worst case? We wait until next summer."

"event","So I TRY to hit the gym M-F, but the last couple of weeks has been tough with a sinus/ear infection, babysitting the youngest granddaughter, and tomorrow a 9 am doctor's appt with the podiatrist. Most all of the weights are up to either 2 reps x 12, but my triceps are having none of this crap and holding me to 1 set on the arm extension, overhead lift and arm curls. Although I managed to talk them into a 15 set for the curls on Friday (hehehehe).

Have also discovered that the elliptical machine is VERY good at getting my hr up over 120 in less than 20 minutes. Does it in 5. And I can do half an hour at a 4-4.5 mph pace. Happiness will be when the scale moves a little bit (even though the tape measure is already moving). Need the weight down a bit more to keep the knee happy. The SO's mom keeps telling me I look fine and don't need to lose any more weight (oh you should hear her...it's soooo funny). Glad I look fine, makes me happy, but the weight hurts a little still.

Gonna keep on plugging. *chuggchuggchugg*

Life continues on, healing well from all the crap over the last few years, getting a handle on the PTSD again (thank gods!) although there are still moments of unreasonable anger. But I get it now. And that is half the battle. Not gonna count the halves, because then I end up with too many halves and I start getting more confused than I already can be. Things are going well with the SO and myself despite all the crap from his mother (although there are days). Apparently he's been considering things that when he related a conversation between his mother and himself floored me (and then sent me into a bit of a headspinning panic). 

I must say, I love the friends I have. Such pita's. What had me terrified that I couldn't figure out (that whole ""too close to the situation"" again) has been identified, and dealt with. And I'm good with that. And content. 

And safe.

Mostly sane. Ok, ok, I can hear some of you laughing. Pbbbbt. And one of you, I Will See You Saturday. Hopefully, I'll see more than one...but the one I have in mind, He Knows Who He Is. The gate will not save you. *laugh* Or the kitchen.

"event","So I'm now two weeks into my gym membership, and doing the weight machines is pretty cool stuff, two machines are only at 25 pounds (triceps because of some damage and torso rotation because of sciatic nerves), but all of them so far this week have been two sets of 12!! Go me!! No weight loss yet, but I don't expect any for another 2-3 weeks as my strength and ability to lift weight gets better. I can, however, see a visible difference in some areas, and a pair of pants that I bought as a 36 waist I could button and sit in. Not for long, but I got 'em buttoned *laughs* 

Life moves on at a snail's pace, the SO's mother continues to wander deeper into her own self-made depression that neither I nor G can help shake her of. She simply refuses to see the brighter side of the coin, and she's mad at the world for what she snarlingly refers to ""have to put up with"". *le sigh* I can only hope I don't get that bad when my time comes, if I wander into dementia, or some other ailment that comes with old age (arthritis doesn't count, I've already got it).

Projects are slow to get done, but getting done they are. Sewing is still a struggle to do since I have to sit in the bedroom of no room to do it, I've dumped the pins I don't even KNOW how many times, gaaaaah. Spinning doesn't get done, again, not a lot of room and when I bring it to the living room she doesn't get the idea that I find it relaxing and fulfilling that I can make my own yarn. Or embroidery. 

And I can't seem to spend time in the room without her asking where I am every 20 minutes. And why am I there. What am I doing. *headdesk*"

"event","Fitness and diet have rendered me under 200!! *happypagandance* Clothes are definitely looser, so went out and bought 36 waist in men's jeans. One pair is snug, but I can sit in them so they are probably more like a 36 3/4. The other two are closer to 36 and while I can get them buttoned, don't ask me to do much of anything else. Also realized that my knee hasn't hurt in 3 weeks. At. All.

I can deal with that. However, my osteo decided it needed to visit this past week and remind me that the dancing is ONE of the reasons for the working out. No anything for the last 4 days, kept as close as possible to the calorie count (went over a bit on tuesday, but not by much). Discovered frozen greek yogurt is a woooonderful sweet snack that doesn't ""break the bank"" and satisfies my craving for the sweet. Those were suggested by the honey, and he thought I might like them. Oh yeah. 

Calligraphy has given me two challenges: a new hand and a tiny script (not the same scroll). Insular majuscule and early gothic done with a #2 and #5 nibs respectively. Both have their wobbles but not horrible wobbles. Gothic capital S is a major pain on the small nib, and it doesn't help that I can't seem to get the balance right on that one. grrr. More practice.

Seems the post traumatic stress buttons have gotten majorly pushed, but thankfully I've gotten in somewhere to get hooked up with a counselor to help get those things back under control. Only to discover that there are some other issues that I didn't quite realize are being hampered by all this...*sigh* But knowing about them is half the battle. Being ready to work on them is the other half, so I am ready to go and get moving. 

I am so ready to move on now, and it's been a year since the finalization of the divorce. Time to let it go, put it in the emotional surgical suite and cut the wound and let it scab."

In fact, I've done a lot of thinking and reflecting over the last couple of days, and there are a lot of things I'll be doing again.

And finding out a few more facts about some things made me realize that the decision I made last year was the right one and I need to stop feeling guilty for it. I found out through a number of people that I had been being taken advantage of for a few years. Was I perfect? no. But I tried. And now, I am moving on. Baby steps, but I'm getting better.

So, I start working on the houppe again, only to find that when I sewed the right front panel on, I put it on upside down. *facepalm* See, the material is only so wide, and I didn't do the wedge part yet because I want to see if I need to go buy more for the sleeves (probably will anyway). 

Then there will be putting together the other gown for a friend. If it comes together the way I have it in mind, it will be nice.

"event","Damn, half a cup of coffee and I still can't spell dancing without backing up. Sheesh.

For the last year I've been doing a set of dances of the ballroom variety set up to get one moving. It's called LaBlast, it's been designed by Louise Van Amstel (if you watch DWTS in the past, that's him, the short Dutch blonde who made a woman out of Kelly Osborne). I love it! Even with the osteo in my lower back and my knee, nothing in the routines puts a lot of twisting stress on either part. Well, not the first two dvd's. #3? Oh yeah. Samba. LOTS of bouncing which my knee doesn't like right now. So I backed down to #1 for the summer, and added a 30-day plank challenge to the routine.

I'm gonna die. Or get a whole lot stronger. I don't which yet. I CAN hold the plank for 30 seconds, but it HURTS. So I'll do day #1 till Monday, then see what happens. I never, ever, had anything like core strength in my entire life, so this should prove to be rather interesting.

On the good side, my larger garb was handed off to another who can fit it. Still need to make her some decent winter garb. Need my good sewing machine. That will come here as soon as we settle on a place in the bedroom to put it. Thank gods it doesn't need electricity.

Diet is working, and just sticking to that is helping lose the pounds (even with a few days of falling off the diet). 

Gonna finish the coffee, then off for a 3 mile walk. No mountains like a friend of mine has, but I do have a few ""molehills"". *grin*"

The back fence and most of the back yard are covered in shade once the leaves come out on the trees, and finding shade loving plants & herbs has been, shall we say, fun.

My eldest granddaughter turned 3 on Tuesday. That day 3 years ago are remembered with fond memories, and yesterday we spent the day with her as Mim (dot) was unable to go with us Tuesday night. We went to Barnes and Noble where she came back with 7 books and a little dollhouse (but with a rabbit) and sat on Dot's lap for an entire HOUR playing with it. She spotted it, fell in love with it and really seemed to want it, so we bought it. Turns out she really did like it. Only rule is she cannot play with it if her sissy is there as sissy is TOO LITTLE to play with it (small parts easily swallowed).

She was ok with leaving it here, so it is hers to play with on other visits.

I'm rather liking this gramma gig. Then we took her to Friendly's (again, Dot's idea), where she was treated to lunch and dessert. Mommy came and picked her up and promised the park, but with no nap I was pretty sure she wouldn't make the park. She didn't. *laugh* zonked out halfway there.

Also, the flowers are coming up in the ""greenhouse"" we have set up on the porch. We bought one of those portable greenhouse things with the plastic covering, and the impatients are now coming up! Not as many as I had hoped, will give the ones not germinating another week and then I will try restarting more. hmmm....looking at greenhouse and thinking of thoughts earlier. What if I made a NON-seethrough cover and used that for storage when not using it for plants??? I think that might work.

She went right to sleep. Yay! Gramma hit the hay about 11:30 after my nightly soak in the tub for the arthritis and circulation issues. 

Guess who woke up at 3:30 am? Tried to get her to lay down and go back to sleep by putting her in our bed..no go. Changed diaper (barely wet)..no go. FINE. At 4:30 we get up, and I head for the front porch where any playing would be at least mostly filtered. Open the slider and think ""wow, it's really warm out here, did I forget to turn down the heater?"" Checked the top dial (which is the only one I use), nope. It was set low for overnight. Then I realize it STINKS like melted plastic. Oh no....did the electrical cord get twisted under the heater? Nope. Funny, doesn't stink  over the heater. Next thought: plug. SHIT. grab cord a foot from the plug, cool...run hand slowly toward the plug, it gets warmer. SOAB. The extension cord plug and heater plug are HOT.

Immediately I pull the two apart then happened to look at the dials on the heater. The top one is fine, the bottom one? It's on 3!! I put it on 1, because it is plugged into an extension cord, and a light, indoor one to boot so the load CANNOT be higher than where I had it. So SOMEONE (whom should remain nameless the little pita) played with the dial. *sigh* Today I will check the heater out by plugging it straight into the wall jack, and throwing the extension cord out.

But, had to with the charge, so got her awake, we started yakking about shit and life in general, somehow it got around to addictions and then me and my ex.

So had breakfast, her Lucky Charms with a few Golden Grahams thrown in for different taste, me Golden Grahams. Half an hour later, and still going on about G, realized I was not seeing right and head felt funny. Before taking any tylenol or aspirin I grabbed the extra glucose tester and shoved a test strip in, took a sample. 

Oh look at that. I have a sugar reading of 157. Joy. Took the allergy meds (which I needed to anyway) and then the tylenol and aspirin and went to bed. 20 minutes later was hungry but ignored it. Tested again around 2 pm and sugar was 127. slept a bit then woke up hungry, tested at 5:00 and was at 174. Ate a bit, waited for dinner, and before dinner was finally down to 127.

Dot fell a week ago and broke her wrist, so we called the ambulance, and the ER doc decided to admit her because of some kind of renal function problem that wasn't explained to us. STILL don't know what it was they were looking for/watching. They gave her morphine. This did not work well as it left her dopey, not eating (eats like a bird on NORMAL days), incoherent, and unable to move herself at all. By Sunday she began to exhibit signs that she might have had a stroke, but it turns out that after 3 days of being OFF all the morphine, everything began to come back. All the x-rays came back negative for any other damage, the CAT scans and MRI are also negative. 

After psy eval, pt eval and ot eval, all agree that depression meds need to be changed and monitored for a few days, and that rehab to get stronger is needed. She refuses to eat hospital food, they keep giving her stuff she can't have (diet soda/sugar free stuff with aspartame in it), so they still won't transfer her. I bring her stuff she will eat, got her to drink, she WANTS to eat and come home but now as of last night is having trouble swallowing stuff. Greeeaaat.

My class had not one adult in it, but 5 young ladies ranging in age from (I believe) 6 to 13ish (maybe 12...can't remember), and it rather apparent that I needed to change my agenda REALLY FAST. So. I look at five girls, two of which eyes were glazing over and counted my pens. Oh look! I have 6 pen holders, lots of nibs, 6 jars of colored ink....HANDS ON!!! Oh my. While not much got done in the way of actual writing, it was fun watching the girls learn to hold the pens, fill them (overflowing in some cases) and draw. There were hot pink kitties, purple pigs, blue pigs, houses....oh my. There were lots of cursive handwriting attempts with wide nibs. I did manage to get a couple of them drawing straight lined ""mountains"" and Zadia (did I spell that right?) was beginning to see that LESS ink in the nib meant she could get the thin lines. Some very good ""a""'s happened, and happy, ink-covered kids were finally sent to the girls room to get cleaned up. ""whew"" Forgot how much it took to keep 5 kids interested. I think I did it....

After cleaning up the tables (accidental ink spillage), and putting the stuff away, went to the gym to find friends. And watched throughout the day Henna warping a small floor loom with a huge thing that she called a warping wheel. Ran into too many friends to list, laughed with and at friends of the peerage level, talked, spun, got a scroll that has been trying to get signed for two years signed! And only spent two dollars at the vendors. Not because I didn't have the money to spend, but the other purchase needs to wait until I have the gown that is hiding in storage found and with me.

Dayboard (lunch) was yummy as usual! Attended one class and finally put my fingers on a harp. Love the sound produced, but alas, it did not strike my heartstrings as an instrument I want to add to my playing skills. Thought it might, but not. At least I can honestly say I tried it. Think I will stay with my violin (which I don't have) and wind instruments.

And then there was court. Oh. My.

I did not play herald as I wasn't sure what was happening with the day before the event happened, so declined. Our new baron and baroness were processed in to court, and the tone for court was forever set when the baron proceeded to: ""Sit, and take what pleasure you may."" Catcalls and hysterical laughter followed, and not a few attempts at ""pleasure"" were attempted. So after the laughter died down somewhat (giggles and snorts were still heard), things proceeded. And while I wasn't up front, one of the baronial orders I belong to was called up. The backlog baronial scroll? Both the heralds (<lj user=""Baronernst"" /> and someone I don't know) were having trouble reading the scroll. Now, I KNOW Baron Ernst can read many, many hands....and when he discovered that it was MY handwriting...well...I got tossed up there to ""help"" read the scroll. And if you think I didn't get politely razzed because they were having ""trouble""....riiiiight. All fun, much laughter.

And then my lovely laurel <lj user=""helwen"" />was called into court. She was the second person to be given a new award, newly created last fall, called the Polaris. The scroll itself is not finished, as many people are working on it. I watched her receive her Pelican award, and she was calm, cool and very collected. Not so this time. I think she started to lose it when she heard the rather looooong list of names who had SO FAR contributed to the illumination. There were tears in her eyes.

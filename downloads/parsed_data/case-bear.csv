"event","A Big Thanks to everyone that I dont know that was at my apartment on friday night, I dont know who invited all of you but you all suck at life and need to quit. I am being incredibly bitter right now and i think i have ever right to be bitter. At least the keg didnt go to waste, and one of us was wasted. Oh well shit happens. This saturday better make up for last friday........"

"event","So i was introduced to the world of Crotch Rockets last night thanks to jay. It was the most fun I have had driving around in a long ass time. It was kinda scary though when he was going 125 mph and my helmet was about to go flying off -not cool- but fun nontheless.... tonight I think its going to have to be a club night I havent been since Justin Jacobsons B-day (long time ago) and I am very excited for it. I have never been to JD's so I think thats where we are going. Its shaping up to be a good night, well it will be after I get out of school damn summer classes. its cool though the faster i get done the faster i can get out of Michigan. I saw the old friends last weekend weird to say the least. So much has changed but then you see all these girls and its like your life rewound to a year ago. Its kinda weird how that works out. I am just glad all the high school i hate you bc she hates you and she hates you bc she hates you dramatized bullshit is over,or at least i am over it, but i have been over it since the second it happened. I dont even know. Its a beautiful day in the neighborhood and i must depart school is calling my name."

"event","<P>Maybe its all not real,&nbsp; maybe its just all a game, once you learn how to play its over. so you grin and bear it, let yourself slip into the unconsciousness that is your daily routine, let the averageness of it all come into play and just be content. Content, what the fuck is content ? who wants to be content ---- Get me out of this place, i want to go so far that its all just a distant memory. memories of friends forgotten and good times lost, they are all already gone so what are we holding on for? </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Its coming soon.................</P>"

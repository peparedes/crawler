"event","hheeyy, Lets see Sunday Mary Clare came over and we just hung out just us two and watched TV. Of course i fell asleep at 10:30 haha.  i was tired.  Then Monday we just hung around the house and watched some more TV. There were some good shows on Sunday and Monday.  hehe  Then Monday night Maria Megan and Me went sledding!! It was so much fun! We sat at the bottom of hill just talking for like 20 minutes.  And Maria of course had to lay across me and Megan.  It was fun.  I wish i had had my camara with me.  After that Megan stayed the night.  Maria couldn't :( Again i fell asleep at 10:30.  hehe.  All that sledding made me tired though!!! Tuesday my mom called at 8:30 and asked if we wanted to go to 12 Oaks so we were like sure why not.  It was fun fun.  hehe.  Then Kristin, Mary Clare, and Megan came over my mom's house.  Kristin had leave at 7 that night though.  :( and Megan got home sick at 10:30 so she went home then, so it ended up being me and MC the rest of the night.  Maddie was a funny girl then i love her so much.  Then today MC and i went to westland mall with my mom and i got a new outfit from AE. And im sitting here doing nothing.  So That was my eventful  week so far! :P  love you! <3abbee"

"event","wow, within one day my life goes from being good to being the worst!  It feels like i have no one! No one to talk to about stuff.  Even stupid stuff like who im crushing on, i don't even have someone to tell that too.  Life sucks, then you die, so what's the point in living?  i love kristin to death, but i never get to see her anymore and she never can/wants to come over. So the one person i thought i could always talk to, and the one person i thought would never leave me pretty much has.

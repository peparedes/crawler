"event","Poor irrelevant hole.  Started it's revolution and found itself in a sea of infamous peril.  Such a violent little passage, such a chaotic serenity...this opening to everything that is and wills itself to be.  Twisting  restless and precise, as though to release, from side to glorious side, and never actually to withdrawl...It turns, and ultimately cracks inside the premise of angelic comfort and crawls away wrapped in a cloak of shame. It turns your truths from lack of will...and reaches inside to  break you like fucking glass.
Poor irrelevant hole."

"event","I like to look at shadows sweating on the wall
                                          I get excited when I hear footsteps in the hall
                                          Outside your balcony I have a room with a view
                                          And I'm watching you

                                          I dial your telephone each and every afternoon
                                          I wait by your door till you're asleep at night
                                          And when you're alone I know when you
                                          Turn out the light

                                          You fumble for your keys
                                          I'm six or seven steps behind you
                                          I'm so close to you
                                          Are you terrified of me? What do I know about you
                                          How did I find out?
                                          You think I'm a fool or maybe some kind of lunatic
                                          Say I'm wasting my time but I know what to do with it
                                          It's as plain as black and white

                                          If you knew my infinite charm
                                          There'd be no reason to be so alarmed
                                          Maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm right
                                          Maybe I'm some kind of lunatic
                                          You say I'm wasting all of my time

                                          I'm gonna get close to you
                                          I'm like a hungry Criminal
                                          and your protection is minimal
                                          So minimal"

"event","The Evil continues...
I would never think that hair could become such a dramatic episode.
All I wanted to do was rest.  Not get caught up in some tirade of completely rediculous proportions.  If I want to be groomed...I will make sure it is on my list of priorities...If I want to sleep...I'm going to sleep!
Now...Wednesday nights....Shancam?  Bean's Company? Or Margarita's with my friends?
We'll see...
(Can you believe they actually want me to go to some disco band on Friday!!!? I think not...the saga, continues)"

The grey skies swept over my small village like ghosts in a funeral home.  
All was well.  And there was much rejoicing."

"event","What sort of thing is one supposed to write about here, anyway?&nbsp;I feel like there's some kind of guide I missed out on, despite having scribbled scores of self-congratulating entries prior to&nbsp; this.

I'm in a long-term, committed relationship. Four years, many fights, a bout of infidelity which&nbsp;I'm not proud of, and so much gladness it's a shame I manage to forget it during our more heated arguments. That's the trick of it, isn't it? A grudge is held in a closed fist, while joyful memories must be gently cupped in an open palm. Mutually exclusive.

My mother is ill, which causes me distress. I'm still trying to determine how I feel, exactly, about mortality and my place in it. Typical human struggle, and perfect fodder for an online journal, I expect, but relevant all the same. I feel like deaths belong to certain people, I think. Perhaps I'll have two funerals when I die: one for the general public who wish to celebrate life, and another for those closest to me who feel strife and uncertainty at the loss of life. It bears considering.

I'm attempting to better myself as a human, and have run into several roadblocks. Chiefly, whose standards do I seek to uphold? My own? Can't be right; I've already lived according to what has felt natural to me, and it's only caused pain. I don't yet accept that pain is necessary for anything other than growing past it. Let me clarify.

What I mean is that, in my life, I've done as I wished and, at times, it's dramatically hurt the people I care about. Something is wrong with that, so I have to determine that a state of mind is to be striven for, rather than assumed naturally. If it feels right to pursue a romantic venture outside of my committed relationship, but it is known that the person I'm in said committed relationship with would be hurt by it, I need to avoid behaving &quot;naturally&quot;. Barbarism, it seems, is our natural state. At least, mine, anyway.

That's enough for now.

"event","Hi.
...
I'm Tyrel.
...
If you're reading this, chances are you never bothered to remove alerts or something from LJ to your e-mail.
I suppose you could be a creeper.
Anyway.

So, because I'm waxing nostalgic, I decided to dust off the ol' LJ. Of course, this probably won't last much past this post, but the gesture satisfies, for now.

I was rereading a smattering of my old posts earlier... It's a beautiful thing to regard yourself with half a decade or more of hindsight. Looking back on confusions, decisions made, and all the other tawdry events surrounding a charmed life thought terrible. Ah well, who's to say I won't be doing the same thing to this very post in a decade's time, neh?

If that's the case, though, I do have a message for future me:

You are going to look back on the preceding years with rancor at the lazy sloth writing you this message. You're going to lament all the things you'd now know if you'd only started learning them on the sixth of June, two-thousand-eleven. You're going to do this, because I'm doing the same thing as I read the petty musings of a December twelfth, two-thousand-one version of myself.

I suppose the message is: Stop being such a lazy jerkoff, or accept that such a state is yours naturally. Move up, or move on.

I guess I'm going to try that. You'll know if I&nbsp;succeed, what with your many years of hindsight. If you manage to build a time-machine, by the way, avoid me. That whole Postie-Premie thing? Yeah, you know what side I'll be on.

I've decided, as many before me have, that Livejournal is in fact a rather parasitic medium through which to communicate. Useful at first, it grows to become the only outlet for your building rage and disontentment. You can hide behind pretty, petty words, and allow your vacant thoughts to find a following more vacant still.
And that is why, in my finite wisdom, I am choosing to take this beast out back, and give 'er the ol' heave-ho.
I may well start up a new one, and I certainly will continue with the six other ones I've got spread throughout the various blogospheres, but this one. The original. The forum through which I have communicated for several years... *shakes head* I think I'll take a page from Kain's book at this point...

I wish I could sleep these days, y'know? I mean, an hour here, and I'm awake. An hour there, I'm awake. I find I sleep better on the couch, y'know, where it isn't stifelingly hot. I woke up out of breath last night because of the heat. I had no blanket on, or anything like that, but even still, the crematorium in which I sleep is already hot without adding the extra calidity of two human bodies. Some days I just want to get up and plop down on the couch... hope sleep can take me there.

I have a challenge for anyone and everyone reading this journal, however. I've recently been going through a few of the old Tremain mixes I've had kickin' around, and I realized that there are some fuckin' awesome songs out there from back in the day. So, my challenge to you is thus: Discover for me all of the good music from the late '80's to the late '90's, and post the artist and song name in my comments here. Tell me why you think it's gold, and deserving of revivification, and I will go forth compiling a list of the most worthy of these songs to put on a mix. *nods* Everyone wins.

Anyway, cheers.

"event","You sleep so soundly, you know that? Gently curled up on my lap, your breath whistling out of your tiny mouth and nose in a steady rhythm. I stroke your baby-soft hair as you nuzzle closer, a slight smile on your perfect little lips. You had a rough day, playing and dancing, cavorting with the imaginary and the mundane. I can't help but smile in thinking of your innocent frolicking... but it is a sad smile, for I know the truth. Though you've only seen six summers, soon your winter will come, child. Were that I could, I would spare you this harsh truth, this deified preordination. But I am only a parent, and what can a parent do but wish for the best?
You play with your friends at swordfighting and childish combat games... but as you do, I see all too often flashes of your future, where that parry, that well-timed leap, that thrust will be all that stands between you and the yawning chasm of death. Oh god, it hurts to know that, one day, you will be taken from me to fight the battles this world will never know about. Always keeping them from tumbling into total oblivion, you will work... this sleep may never again fall upon your eyes. For if there is no rest for the wicked, then there can be less even for those who fight them. I would guard your door as you slept, if I could, keeping them at bay. But I am only a parent, and what can a parent do but offer words of caution and of comfort?
Your mind will be subject to the depridations of ravenous, hate-filled creatures who will desire only your painful death. You will have to contend with the legions of the Adversary, always fighting, always killing. Your mind might grow dull with the apparantly senseless slaughter, the unending waves of the Damned rushing onto your blade... and there will be no one to stand beside you. My sweet, sweet demon slayer, you are bound for a lonley path. Your friends cannot join you on the journey you are set for, for they are not strong enough. It was not they of whom the prophecies speak, but you. I would stand beside you in that fight, blade held high in defiance of their demonic tyranny, but I am only a parent. And what can a parent do but gently rub your back after you are numb with slaughter and lonliness?
They will come, and they will fight, and they will die. And you will fight them... and the worst thing I can possibly fathom will happen. You will die one day, to. They will be too many in number, to great in ferocity... and their poison claws will pierce your flesh, their frothing mouths will close over your neck, and their wicked barbed tails will push through you... and you'll.. die. Because that is what the prophecy demands... For there to be a  divine intervention, the greatest of us must be sacrificed to prove our sincerity... and believe me, my sweet, when I say that there is no greater, more perfect a person than you. Were that I could, I would sacrifice my own life that you might have one of your own, your very own, one day. But I am only a parent, and what can a parent do but... oh god, this is too much.
I'm trying not to quiver with my sobs, now. My tears gently dropping to your face. You bury your head into the crook of my arm to get away from them. I take your face gently in my hands, stroking your cheeks with the tender care only a mother can offer. And as your feathery eyelashes flutter open, I cannot hold back a sob, and a smile of joy. You are my child, my baby. You aren't some demon slayer, not some ordained warrior of light. You're a six year old boy, looking with full love and trust into the face of your mother. And it is those beautiful blue eyes that hold me in arrest... the goodness of the world wrapped up in one perfect package.
""Mommy""... your soft little voice says the word, the truest word any child can know. The word that means safety, calm... love. I lean down to offer you a kiss on the forehead, feel again the softness of your hair, the touch of your little hand in mine. And as you lay your head back down to sleep, I let my fingers slowly encircle your neck, and begin squeezing.
Were that I could, I would give you a life worth living. Time to grow and become your own man. But I cannot. I can, however, choose to spare you the hell they've chosen for you. Play now, my son, in the fields of heaven... safe... forever."

When I last left Seven Helleven, I did so under the impression that ANY job is better than that one. But it was not to be so. You see, working in general licks teh ballzorx. Occasionally, however, we will come across a job that we like. Somewhere we don't mind working, or even look forward to.
Well, the trouble with this is, we all believe, more or less, that such a place exists only for those who already work there. But I have reflected, and I say Nay!
I've decided, then, to take up a job somewhere else... the money doesn't matter... and enjoy it. I want to have a job I don't hate, and one that isn't open twenty-four hours a day for fuck sake. So... if I have less money than usual in the next few months, don't be too shocked.

1. Who did you last get angry with? Councilor Weebo.
2. What is your weapon of choice? My sword. Because it kills.
3. Would you hit a member of the opposite sex? Certainly. You must understand that, when equality became the watchword of the world, many of us chose to stand by that. I would hit a man, if he intended on hitting me... so it would be the same for a woman...
4. How about of the same sex? *nods* Absolutely.
5. Who was the last person who got really angry at you? Honestly? I don't quite know. You'd think I'd keep better track of those who are angry with me... but not so much... I should work on that.
6. What is your pet peeve? People who seem to lack the ability to be ON FUCKING TIME!!! ((I think I'll keep this one from the original))
7. Do you keep grudges, or can you let them go easily? I used to hold grudges... but they made me a weaker person. I now act on my rage, or not at all. If it isn't offensive enough for me to deal with now, then ther isn't any point in saving it for later...

SLOTH

4. What is the last lame excuse you made? All of my excuses are believable, because they are the truth. If I just don't want to do something, I won't make an excuse... I'll just say I don't want to do it.
5. Have you ever watched an infomercial all the way through? Well, let me put it to you this way... I almost bought a Miracle Blade Perfection Series knife set.
6. When was the last time you got a good workout in? A good one? A few weeks ago...
7. How many times did you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock today? *shakes head* I didn't. I just... woke up.

GLUTTONY
1. What is your overpriced yuppie beverage of choice? Martini.
2. Meat eaters: *smirks* I liked my previous answer. I not only eat meat, but I eat others who eat meat.
3. What is the greatest amount of alcohol you've had in one sitting/outing/event? *shrugs* A bottle or so of wine. I don't drink much.
4. Have you ever used a professional diet company? *shakes head* No... but my diet will be changing, if that counts at all...
5. Do you have an issue with your weight? Not my weight in as much as what it's made of. Until I can change what I've got into a more muscular format, I'll not be satisfied.
6. Do you prefer sweets, salty foods, or spicy foods? Salty, definately.
7. Have you ever looked at a small housepet or child and thought, ""LUNCH!""? *smirks* You should be there for one of our Bus Baby Buffet conversations...
((Indeed... I remember those fondly...))

LUST
1. How many people have you seen naked (not counting movies/family)? More than my fair share, I'd bet.
2. How many people have seen YOU naked (not counting physicians/family)? ... Several. That is all.
3. Have you ever caught yourself staring at the chest/crotch of a member of your gender of choice during a normal conversation? Well, naturally, I enjoy the view if my co-conversationalist is female AND attractive. But I tend to wait until we're finished talking before I start oggling. Though I must say, I've never offhand stared at a crotch... unless it was to get a point across.
4. Have you ""done it""? *nods* Yes. Often.
5. What is your favorite body part on a person of your gender of choice? *smirks* I'm going to go offensively off the wall on this one... I love tits... and I totally dig the cunt. Oh yeah. *smirk*
6. Have you ever been propositioned by a prostitute? Not knowingly... but still, Dave's story was fucking hilarious.
7. Have you ever tested yourself for an STD or pregnancy? I didn't do it myself, but I HAVE been tested. How's that?

GREED
1. How many credit cards do you own? None.
2. What's your guilty pleasure store? None of my pleasure's are guilty... *sly grin* ((I still appreciate that one.))
3. If you had $1 million, what would you do with it? Buy a house far, far away. Leave everything here, and start over.
4. Would you rather be rich, or famous? I once wanted fame... but that dream has passed... Wealth would be more appropriate, I think.
5. Would you accept a boring job if it meant you would make megabucks? Well, I wish I could say no... But I've accepted a boring job for piddly-bucks... so why not...
7. How many MP3s are on your hard drive? None.

PRIDE
1. What one thing have you done that you're most proud of? *shrugs* Not proud of a great deal these days. I've put together some rather impressive stories.
2. What one thing have you done that your parents are most proud of? I'd be impressed if I'd done ANYTHING to impress my father...
3. What thing would you like to accomplish in your life? I'm not sure yet... but I know it isn't going to happen here...
4. Do you get annoyed by coming in second place? I don't often compete, so it's rarely an issue.
5. Have you ever entered a contest of skill, knowing you were of much higher skill than all the other competitors? *nods* I enjoy the cheap thrill and ego-boost now and again.
6. Have you ever cheated on something to get a higher score? Yes. Often.
7. What did you do today that you're proud of? You know, nothing. But shouldn't we all strive to accomplish at least one thing of worth every day?

ENVY
1. What item (or person) of your friends would you most want to have for your own? *shakes head* I have everything I need to have... and as for that which I just want? I'd like a car, but that's about it.
2. Who would you want to go on ""Trading Spaces"" with? *smirks* Jason... so I could infiltrate the Holy Land.
3. If you could be anyone else in the world who would you be? The new and improved me.
where's 4? <------ Jackass.
5. Have you ever wished you had a physical feature different from your own? *nods* Indeed. I'm wishing it right now..."

But physical relocation simply cannot be enough to accomplish what we need. Some of us are taking it a half a step farther, and are going to school. Certainly, one foot forward in the right direction... But without a plan for what is to happen after that? Really, you're only taking two steps back.
But then, what are we good at? What can our generation do that the others before us couldn't do better? I'd imagine as we've gotten better at two things... fucking, and law evasion. And while most of us are satisfied with being amazing lovers, every so often, when you're basking in the afterglow of the moment... don't you wish you could feel as good about other aspects of your life? Maybe I'm the only one who thinks that much after sex, but I'd hope not.
Some of us are getting out, you know. Tough to believe, because we never really see it.. But I know a guy who wants to be in a band, and he is! That's what his lifes work is, and while he isn't making enough to pay rent, he is playing... I know another guy who wants to be a great father... and he's going to be. Young? Very. Responsible? He's learning to be. But he's set his sights on this goal just as surely as anyone, and he's going to be great at it.
But you and I? What are we doing? We're working at Seven Eleven, Canadian Tire, Security, HMV, or not at all. Our problem? We identify our personal success by a career. A job is a job. We're no longer the numbers that our predecessors feared we would turn into... No, now we're job titles. The plaque on your office door, or the ""Sales Assistant"" logo beneath your name on your tag... these are the only things that people look for in one another. And that is the legacy left to us.
And the worst part? It is our generation that has all but abolished inequality. Oh, sure, there are still racists, sexists, and the like... but no longer are they the majority. Now, we the equal, we the free... We are the majority, and ours is the way. And while murder may be on the rise, brotherhood is as well. We've developed a global fraternity through ions and electronic impulses. Whole networks of friends crop up from across the globe, connecting online, and finding happiness and solace in one anothers text and video-streamed images.
Boundaries are broken, but chains are forged. Have we nothing to contribute to our world but another body in a cubicle?
Transform.

"event","I am a monster. I am a musician. I am a lover, and I am a killer. I've been the lord of millions, and a pauper on the streets. There is little to nothing that I've been found wanting for, yet I hunger for so much more. I've met some of the most noble people ever to go without a title, and some of the most dispicable ones to claim ties to nobility. I've been through moments of agony more intense than any felt before, and moments later felt a tenderness so profound as to melt the heart of the Black Tower's jailers.
I am Cyric, and this is my story.

Footsteps echo down the hallway leading to my study, making a decidedly cacophonous noise I would prefer not to be subject to. Truly, my sanctum is my refuge from the rigors of life, intended to be uninterupted. Of course, intention and reality are often mutually exclusive. I take my eyes from the book in my lap, an original print of Edger Allen Poe's ""The Cask of Amontillado"", a favorite of mine. As I let my gaze pass to the doorway, she enters, the picture of beauty in these modern times. Her damp crimson tresses hang down about a deliciously curved frame, the gown covering her pale ivory complexion not quite the picture of modesty. But I am in no mood for company, however lovely. She looks upon me, those emerald eyes sparkling with bejewelled adoration as she takes in the view.
I've never ceased to be amazed at how easily the human mind is willing to cast aside the flaws of those around it when infected with the notion of love. Let it be said for the record, by the way, that I am certainly no loveless buffoon, I just believe the original notions are not being held up to the proper regard in these times. But I digress.
She finds me a vision of perfection, though I've done little enough to provide an enticing image. I lounge in one of my more comfortable chairs, garbed in my sleaveless satin evening robe, sporting a spider-web pattern from the shoulder to the floor. My shoulder length hair I've allowed to spill down around my face, providing a sort of blonde frame for my features. My countenance, however, should be one enough to put her off. My normally warm eyes have gone dark for the interruption, and the corners of my lips have turned down ever so slightly in a frown of discontentment. She hesitates at the door, noting easily the displeasure prevelant in my posture, but moves into the study anyway... a brash move that both earns my curiousity, and aggravation.
""M'lord Cyric, forgive my intrusion... There is something I thought you should know..."" Her flawless face cannot seem to raise itself to bear the brunt of my scrutiny, as she moves to kneel next to me, gazing down to the book instead of at my face. The silence remains unbroken after her statement, and I can feel her growing more nervous with every passing moment. Eventually, she takes my muted disregard as in indicator to continue, though if the truth were to be known, I had already returned my attention to my book.
""A body has been found, m'lord... in the courtyard. He appears to be a suicide."" I can hear the quiver in her voice... a clear indication that she is probably the one who found the body. She is shaken to the core, though she retains her composure for this meeting, not wanting to lose face in front of me. This warms my heart a bit, I'll admit, and I am forced to reconsider my previous cold silence. I reach up slowly, my delicately long fingers brushing aside a few stray strands of hair from her face. She raises her face to look upon me now, finding a warm smile greeting her. A few tears escape the corners of her eyes and make their swift way down her creamy, supple skin as her own lips part in a smile of pure reverence. My reply is short, though my voice remains soft, I daresay even kind.
""Come, love... take me to the body."" And with that, I stand and make my way for the door. With one final afterthought, I hold my hand out to my side and mutter a single arcane word, the result of which sends my rapier flying across the room and into my hand. One does not live as long as I have without taking a precaution here or there.
------------------------------------
Minutes later, I'm standing in the courtyard of my manor, looking down at the decidedly large body of what appears to be my steward. The cobblestones about us are rain-slicked, though the storm has abated. I cross my arms over my chest, looking from the body, to the tower above, and back to the body. My brow creases in consternation as I jab his side with my toe.
Returning my gaze to the tower, I note the shattered window... his apparant point of egress. The lady at my side shivers, though I can't tell if it's because of the chill night air, or the ghastly sight before us. Truly, Morgan would have made quite the mess in his exit from this mortal coil, were it not for the recent rain. His emmense form smashed to the cobblestones with enough force to all but shatter his skull, turning his face into a thick red pulp, resembling my dinner from earlier this night more than the man who prepared it, though the blood has since run off toward one of the drains in the courtyard. But all told, something doesn't fit.
With one more gentle touch on her shoulder, I offer my guest another smile before ascending to the tower above. My levitation is slow and graceful... truly, I see no need to hurry. Morgan isn't in any particular rush, after all. I alight myself onto the plush carpeting of the topmost room in the tower, and let my gaze pass over the scene here. Crunching along the broken glass, I move from the window to the bed, shaking my head in irritation. Standing over it, I note the dishevelled sheets, the douvet tossed haphazzardly to the floor. I lean a little closer, taking one of the satin-covered pillows in my hand. I bring it closer to my face, taking in a deep breath, turning several things over in my mind. A moment later, I allow myself a loud, convivial laugh and begin making my way back to the window. Tossing the pillow to the carpet beside me, I dash forward, and dive through the window. The few people gathered below gasp in shock as I smash through the few remaining pieces of the window, and plummet earthward.
A moment later, I land gently on the ground, much to the relief of both my people and my paramour. I stand, glancing about, smelling the air a bit. I can estimate the the storm has been over for roughly one half hour by now, the lady having collected me a few minutes after it ended. I pace around the place, affecting a look of confusion, letting the tension grow all but physical in the long moments, silence only broken by my footsteps.
Finally, she turns to me, placing her face on my chest and weeping openly.
""Why did he do it? Dear, sweet Morgan..."" Her words trail off in a sob. I wrap my arms around her, holding her close in a comforting gesture. I wave to he gathered crowd, a dismissive gesture to which the swiftly respond, leaving th elady and I in the company only of each other and the recently deceased.
""The question is not why he did it, dear lady, but why he did it so poorly."" My callous words are spoken in a casual tone, almost as though I were chastising my former employee. She looks up at me swiftly, confusion swimming in those verdant green eyes.
""M'lord?""
I smile now, stepping around the body, and begin my analysis of the situation.
""My curiosity was first piqued when I noted a distinct lack of blood around my erstwhile companion. This, naturally, got my suspicions raised. My skepticism was further proven in dear Morgan's bedroom. My steward and bodyguard was not the subject of a tragic suicide, but of a poorly carried-off murder.""
She gasps at this, clutching her nightgown to her chest, a look of shock on her face.
""Who would do such a thing?""
My smile turns devious now as I draw Dorian from his sheath, pointing to the body.
""The killer did well to sprinkle some broken glass around the corpse, allowing for the possibility of self-imposed defenestration, though there isn't nearly enough to make up a full window. The rest, however, remains on the carpet in Morgan's bedroom. What does that indicate, treasure?""
Her silence indicates a distinct lack of cognition to these events, so I opt to fill her in.
""Someone broke in first, through that same window. The killer, presumably. However, Morgan was my bodyguard as much as he was my chef, and so such actions should not have caught him off guard... that is, unless he was predisposed with some other committment, yes?"" I swing the blade back up to the tower, though my gaze remains on the maiden before me. I take her silence as an indicator to continue. ""You see, Morgan was with a woman tonight. That in and of itself is barely short of a miracle. You see, Morgan was once of the monastic orders of Tibet, though gave that up at the behest of whatever spirits or notions guide his august tradition, to serve and protect me. Thus has he been strongly protected against the lures of the flesh. Of course, he was only a man, and certain wiles that can come only from the most beautiful of women will overcome the staunchest of Zen masters."" The blade slowly makes its way to point at the damsel in my midst. The jig, as they say, is up.
""No, you cannot be suggesting..."" I cut her off with a look almost as sharp as my sword, my expression turning from one of humor to one of disapprobation.
""Your scent on his pillow has betrayed you. Let's see if I get this right... you'll stop me, of course, if I stray. You slipped into his room much earlier this evening, I would bet clothed in little more than a coy smile... How long did he last against your charms, I wonder? But no, he couldn't have lasted too long, for soon you had him bedded, and I would bet considerably exhausted. Did he confess his love to you? I would bet he did, poor naive fool. Probably just before your partner smashed in through the window and charged the bed. He pulled Morgan from beside you..."" I turn the body over with one swift kick now, to reveal a rather long piece of glass stuck conveniently between his ribs. ""And would you look at this? The murder weapon which could easily have been written off as a part of the fall! One swift stab and the light from my vassal's eyes faded. Did you watch, m'lady? Did you feel satisfaction in knowing that you provided him with the night of his life on the last night of his life?"" Her face grows cold at that.
""Add to that the fact that you and your accomplice had to spend several minutes doctoring the crime scene and bedroom to cover your tracks, though I have to say you did a poor job at best. A blind scullery boy could have deduced your involvement. I know you took the time, however, as the storm was not yet over when you killed him, hence why his blood has been washed away. Had you found the body as early as it seemed you would have after hearing the window smash not two doors from your bedroom, you would have rushed to me immediately. That would have been after the storm had abated, if your story were to be believed. And your hair wouldn't be damp from the rain as you..."" I take the loop of his money pouch from his belt with the tip of my blade, holding the empty sack in the air. ""... filched what few farthings the man carried on hand.""
She is quiet now, knowing that, yes, she has been caught. She lets the seconds roll into minutes, considering her predicament. I can all but see her picking her way through the murder, noting the same flaws that should have been obvious to her throughout. It is then that the last piece falls into place.
""It wasn't my..."" She starts, but I cut her off again.
""... idea, I know. You're realizing how many flaws there are in this plan. How it easily points every finger at you, and none at your partner. You were set up, my lovely little temptress. Whoever your partner is, you played right into his hands, and now you were to take the fall for the crime as well. Clearly, he cares little for your situation, but you can rest assured that I will find him, to."" I hold Dorian up to her again, and I can all but feel the blade shudder in anticipation of the kill. Sometimes, truly, I worry for my dear friend.
""You cannot kill me, Cyric! Please!"" She begins pleading. It's amazing how swiftly we'll trade our dignity for life. ""I.. I can tell you who he was! Why we did it! There are so many more questions you need the answers to!"" Her desperate smile grows, as though she believes she's found an inescapable loophole in the Devil's contract. It is with that same smile she dies, her head cleft from her graceful neck in one swift motion.
""Poor dear... such answers I do not need from your living body... only from your entrapped soul..."" With that, I gesture, leaving the language of magic to cause her still-warm corpse to rise, gather it's head, and begin making it's way to my study. Perhaps I'll be able to finish my book before returning to the business at hand."

"event","Customer Disservice


""Hello and how may I provide you with excellent customer service?""  Do these
words strike fear in your heart, too?   There's nothing worse than trying to
get something done over the phone these day.  And nothing sets my tits on
fire faster than when some oily stammering goat herder in New Delhi wants to
start off our conversation with something we both know is complete bullshit.
If they just had the courtesy to begin by saying, ""how may I provide you
with barely acceptable customer service"" at least we wouldn't have to start
off on the wrong foot.  If you need to handle something over the phone, you
better pop in a porno and pack a lunch because it will take all fucking day.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.   At this point you're nowhere near talking
to a person, yet.  One time I went so long without getting a person on the
phone I ended up talking to a bloody volleyball.  Unless that was Tom Hanks.
Yes, I ended up talking to Tom Hanks.  Bor-ing.  Anyway, before you get
any help you have to navigate through 35 levels of voicemail.

They always start with the same question.  ""For English, press 1:  nachos
Espanol, sombrero numero dos.""  How the fuck did this happen? Last time I
checked this was America.  And in America, no one speaks English, but
they're certainly not all jabbering in Spanish.  And besides, how many
people in America actually have a Spanish phone with a numero dos on it?

Nice job setting up the voice mail by the way.  God forbid you should press
'1' to get customer service.  '1' is always some department that no one
could possibly want to speak to like, 'Resource Market Development'.  How
do they get to be first?  I blame the Spanish.

If you do manage to get the right department, then you have to punch in
every number associated with your life.  Your 48 digit account number, your
social security number, your birthday, how many inches is your father's
cock, how many inches can your father take in the ass?

When you're finally through this maze; you used to get a human being.  But
now you get a robot.  Like I'm supposed to believe this robot wants to help
me?  That sweet sounding robot just wants to find out where I live so it can
tear out my heart and stop me from fulfilling my destiny of leading the rag
tag army of human resistance fighters.

Never talk to the robot.  Never do what the robot tells you to do.  They
will eventually let you speak to one of the last humans tucked away in the
back: the ones they're saving for their robot zoo.

Although the human is generally no more help.  Apparently, the robots have
lobotomized the humans so they can only read from a script.  They're
waiting; slowly eating their steaming bowls of curry.  They're waiting for
you to mention one or two key words so that they can give you directions on
something completely unrelated to what you asked them.

This is him:  ""Hi this is Steve (or some other phony American name).   How
may I provide you with excellent customer service?""

This is me:  ""Hi Saptajit, thanks for helping me out.""

Him:  ""Out?  If your cable is out, please turn off your cable box.""

Me:  ""Wait a second.""

Him:  ""Second?  If you'd like to add a second cable box you need the Sales
department.  Please hold while I connect you.

Me:  Damn you Saptajit!  Don't make me kill your cow!

When they put you on hold they do one of two things.  They play some
horrible easy listening music.  This is a complete misnomer.  This music is
anything but easy to listen to.  They should call it ""stab yourself in the
ears with an icepick to make it stop"" music.  Or, they play some
advertisement for the company (over the same crappy easy listening music)
telling you how happy they are to have some of your money and why you should
give them the rest of it.

When they transfer you., they always give you the phone number of the person
they're connecting you to, in case you're disconnected.  It's 2005.  How are
we still getting disconnected?  There is no giant switchboard where they're
plugging and unplugging the lines into little holes?  The telephone was
invented in 1876.  I think transferring calls should be ready by now.

I eventually manage to get back to the Billing department.  It's the same
guy.  He now has no idea who I am.  He needs to ask me all of my information
again.  And then the dreaded question: what is your password?

That's right:  five years ago when you signed up for this service, you
created a password.  Now, I'm just trying to pay my bill.  I know they have
to be careful in this age of identity theft and other nefarious schemes; but
are there really a lot of people impersonating me trying to settle up my
unpaid balance?  Just wait until the West Africans get their hands on this
sweet scam.  They'll use their unclaimed millions to pay for everything!

I never know what I used for my password and they won't give you a hint.  So
now I'm giving Saptajit the passwords to every account I have.  Now he can
read my email, access my bank account, and rent movies online.  I find that
if I start insulting them at this point, instead of guessing passwords, they
eventually give in.

Me:  ""Hmmm?  Is it, 'you suck?'  Is that my password""

Him: ""No.""

Me: ""Shitbrain? You're brain dead?  Your head is full of sand and fleas?""

Him:  ""No, none of those.""

Me:  ""You sister is the dirtiest slut in Calcutta whose cunt is filled with
the broken off penises of all of the lepers who've fucked her?""

Him:  ""(Sigh)  It might be your mother's maiden name.""

Me:  ""See?  Was that so bad?""

Him:  ""Bad?""  If your reception is bad you need Technical Services.  Please
wait while I transfer your call.""

I was going to go to India and kill Saptajit and his cow.  I would tie him
to four different rickshaws and tear him to pieces.  But there was a
problem with my ticket and I'm not going to call the airline.  Soon
Saptajit, soon."

"event","I am a monster. I am a musician. I am a lover, and I am a killer. I've been the lord of millions, and a pauper on the streets. There is little to nothing that I've been found wanting for, yet I hunger for so much more. I've met some of the most noble people ever to go without a title, and some of the most dispicable ones to claim ties to nobility. I've been through moments of agony more intense than any felt before, and moments later felt a tenderness so profound as to melt the heart of the Black Tower's jailers.
I am Cyric, and this is my story.

Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, hold. The string is pulled taught, eye on the target, arms solid and fixed in place. One shot, no distractions. Release, and relax. My arm comes back down to my side, yet my eye remains on the prize as I watch my arrow fly unerringly through the warm spring air. It finds its mark, just as I knew it would. But my smirk of satisfaction doesn't come until I hear the scream of protest from my target.
""Wha' the? Who th'blas' did tha'?"" The poacher screams, scaring his quarry worse than I ever could have. He's referring, of course, to the now-unstrung bow he carries in his hands, the line clearly severed by my expert shot. A slight grin creases my features for a moment, raising the corner of my thinly sculpted moustache before I take on the countenance of business. Mirth fades, to be replaced by a sternness borne of rulership, and I stand up, divesting myself of the blind I've been perched behind to sneak up on the unwary hunter. No need for stealth now, though... time to play.
His hearing is quite acute, I must give him that much. That explains why no one has yet been able to sneak up on him... Except for me. He turns to look upon me, his face a mottled, ugly red, suffused with the blood of fury, and he stands in kind. Broken bow in hand, he stalks through the brush of the lightly wooded forest, obviously intent upon committing a certain degree of violence unto me.
""Wha' gives y'bloody tossa'?"" He virtually screams at me from about twenty feet distant. I offer no reply, nor do I move from my rooted spot. My silence, of course, only serves to infuriate him that much more, and that's when he makes the second mistake of the afternoon. He charges forward, raising the bow above his head as though it were some kind of cudgel. Tsk tsk, that's no way to treat so fine a weapon, I have to bite my tongue from saying. No, better to egg him on that much more, for now. There will be plenty of time for talking, soon.
Ten feet, seven, five feet now. And that's when I spring into action. I abandon my own bow to the forest floor, and in an instance, my rapier leaps into my hand, shooting out to rest gently on the churl's chin. Of course, his momentum nearly has him skewered, and I must once again credit him for a degree of prowess in stopping his mad dash before it ends in his death. Eyes as wide as saucers, he regards the razor-sharp tip drawing a single bead of blood down his neck. Brevity gone, he shakes a little, though he's much to frightened to move much more than that.
""Step toward that fox-trap you set up earlier."" My normally smooth, chocolate gentle voice drops a few notes, taking on a tone of menace, a promise of slow death if my demands are not met. He hesitates only long enough for me to add another two or three droplets of blood to their crimson predecessor before deciding to follow my instructions.
He moves slowly, eyes still focussed on the blade following his every move, and I can see the gears in his head begin to turn again. Survival instinct is the only force greater than fear, you see. But instinct is nothing compared to the sheer brilliance of the human mind unfettered. We're only a few feet from the cruel trap, though the bait has already been set for this ploy.
The tensing in his shoulders betrays him, and a few words in the sinuous language of magic dance across my lips a moment later. As he spins down my blade, in a rather deft maneuver, I might add, he brings one of his meaty fists up into the face of the wielder of the rapier... only to find himself swinging at air. The blade, still suspended, turns on him then, slashing a mean cut across his face, the dancing to his other side to offer the same cosmetic wound. His shock at not finding me standing there is abruptly replaced by fear of the animate blade, hungry for his vital fluids. The blade moves through several different feints and routines, though he is more cautious than I initially gave him credit for. While he is rather concerned with the poor disposition of this weapon, he is not so foolish as to allow it to herd him into stumbling upon the fox-trap. Truly, I am beginning to admire this poor sot.
I allow this game to go on for several minutes, observing from my perch on a branch above the scene, allowing the mirth of the situation to tug at both corners of my mouth. Of course, all good things must come to an end, not excluded from this the enchantment upon Dorian, my sword. In one moment, the poacher is dodging around a tree, trying to avoid the vengeful strikes of the possessed weapon, and in the next, he finds the rapier thudding to the soil of the forest floor, unmoving.
Normally, people investigate the blade, trying to figure it out, cautiously prodding it with the tip of their boots. But this man, I have figured out by now, is not of average intelligence. He does not count his blessings, opting instead to practice the better part of valor... discretion. He turns on his heel, and bolts for his original hideaway, to gather his things and make his way back to town. A victory, of sorts, this day, as he will not hunt in this part of the woods. But he will still hunt, and that I cannot allow.
I am unconcerned with the lives of those animals he kills, but am apalled by his audacity, his disrespect toward the noble tradition of hunter versus prey. And so he will learn a healthier respect for such a notion.
I drop to the ground, soundlessly, my long strides mystically keeping pace with his lumbering dash. Truly, he doesn't notice me until he's halfway packed, and then he freezes again, those beady pig eyes rounding like saucers once more.
""Warlock! Yer a warlock! I'll tell 'em, tell 'em at th'village! You'll not be away wi'this!"" His words reak of cowardice, clutching to any sort of salvation he might find. Of course, at this point, my visage changes. Whereas before, he could have learned a great deal of my character through my features, now he will find such a physiognamous endeavour quite worthless. Truly, can one gain the measure of a man as black fur ripples down his face and body, his face protrudes, lips pull back to reveal a row of acuminately sharp teeth. I offer no explanation as I drop to all fours, muscles rippling beneath the black fur, claws protruding from my now meaty paws. In the span of moments, I take on the mein of a bear, a sight that has the poacher soiling himself audibly. I wrinkle my nose in disgust as I watch his dignity run down his leg, though a lesson still must be made. I charge.
Now, one must understand that a bear, while not the most graceful of natures children, is still a force of speed unerring. I barrel down upon him, tackling him to the ground as he turns to flee. His possessions fly from his hand, spreading across the ground in a cascade, forgotten momentarily for this decidedly unpleasent turn of events.
I rake my claws across his body, though never enough to even pierce flesh. Snap my jaws so close to his face that he can all but taste my still-perfumed breath... truly, there are some things I'm even unwilling to let change, even with such transmogrification.
This goes on for several moments until he has emptied his grace and pride onto the leaves and loam beneath us, at which point I deign to speak. Not the voice of a bear, for surely that might be more comforting than that gentle, silk-smooth sound carressing his ears from the horrid visage of his ursine oppressor.
""You have killed, taken the lives of nature. Such is your due, and you are not punished for their deaths. You are instead found guilty of irreverence. These woods are your livelyhood, yet you treat them with contempt. You have found that the Earth Mother has her guardians, ready to deliver terrible swift justice upon you should you continue this disrespect. But I want you to remember one thing..."" I pause as I draw myself up to a standing position, letting the glamour of magic dissipate my bulky form, to reveal once more the gentleman archer this pitiable yokel first came upon. My blade flies to my hand at this point, and in an instant, retakes it's position beneath his chin.
""Mother nature is willing only to kill you... it is the human that can torture you. I have spared you this day, not the woodlands... Your life is forfeit if I see fit. You will live, for now, practicing your trade with my approbation, though you will see to the reverence and perseverence of dignity for your quarry. But know that when death comes calling, rapping at your window in the midnight hours, it shant be the death's head or scythe that you should fear. No, fear death in a more human guise, for it shall be my form that greets you at the door and demands your life's blood. Go now, and count every day as your last, for it is a fickle god you have chosen this day. Live, at my grace, for that is how you shall die.""
And with that, he needs no further invitation. Shaken clearly to the core of his repulsive soul, he gathers himself and scrambles back to town, leaving behind the treasure and trophies he brought with him.
I watch him flee, and allow myself a hearty chuckle at his expense, the sound of which only spurs him along that much faster, until all that is left of him is the occasional dun-colored evidence lost in his escape. Upon his banishment, I begin gathering his things, from the remaining arrows in his quiver to the pretty ivory good luck charm he toted. Examining this last in the sunlight, I cannot supress a smile. Indeed, some days it is good to be me."

"event","It's a gentle moon, a warm moon, the sort of moon poets write about. The moon beneath which a virgin pictures her beautiful first time. It is beneath this same moon I find myself, bathed wholly in it's luminous glow, like a soul layed bare for the world to see. And verily, this night I am... but the world is alseep, as it always is when I am about.
I make my way soundlessly across the grass, an echo of silence in the warm night air. Hair trailing behind me like silk gauze from a restless spirit, I gently float to the balcony two floors up, and light myself upon the stones with a grace practiced of centuries. If I had a heartbeat, I would measure my next few steps by it, but such functions ceased long, long ago. So instead, I rely on the cadence of her heart, too muffled beneath flesh and cloth for the rest of the world to heart, but a veritable symphony to my ears. Step... step... step...
I stand before the balcony doors, open just a crack to let the aroma of the spring evening into her room. So trusting, she is, so naive. Even without the blood empowerment, a common footpad could have made his swift way to this same balcony. I have seen to the prevention of this, of course... but she doesn't know that.
I slip into the room, clothes rustling in the light breeze along with the curtains. Certainly, I would seem only scenery to any passer-by... yet another talent, and habit, brought on by a millenia of paranoia. A few more gentle beats of her heart and I'm standing over the bed, my shadow falling across her unconscious form, eclipsing the moonlight outside. 
Her breathing is deep, steady, almost comforting enough that I might be lulled into a slumber alongside her. But such a sleep would be one I could never awaken from. For as the sun would rise, I would fall... and while I am not exactly enamored by this existance, I can think of a great many other ways I'd prefer it end.
I reach a hand out then, so slowly as to seem immobile, until my fingertips brush ever-so-gently the soft skin of her cheek. She stirs at the touch, sending a shiver through my cold limbs... a shiver of what? Exultation? Anticipation? ... fear?
Her eyes flutter open, the long lashes slowly parting to reveal eyes greener than emeralds. Her naturally ruby lips turn up in a smile that could make the gods themselves cry... And surely, a darker god is in her presence, but a god all the same.
As her eyes focus, the sound of rain dripping off of sunshine escapes those crimson lips... and breaks my heart.
""Love? Jonathan? Is that you?""
And as swiftly as I entered her life, I leave it... little more than a half-remembered dream to her... though she remains much, much more to me... Until tomorrow night, my love..."

Bitching about it on LJ hasn't gotten me anywhere, mind you. But I have found that, once one has dealt with enough shit, one's tolerance reaches critical mass, and one can no longer keep a subjective, rational POV on the whole thing. And that's when they say stupid shit that leaves them regretting ever having spoken.
Which is why, of late, I've endeavoured to keep those thought-processes and strange little blargets to myself, lest the rest of the world turn out to be the flaming shit-factories they are by nature...



I guess what I'm getting at is this... If I haven't told you my problems or cares, bets are good I don't want you knowing them. This isn't spoken out of eliti... never mind, it is. I feel as though most of the people reading this are untrustworthy with any sort of secret or deception, mostly because of their vaunted morales, and their idea that the truth is somehow this all-cleansing anisthetic, which it has been proven not to be. Don't take this as a shot, or a personal attack... it's just the truth. I can think of, maybe, two people in this world who share my morality, or can at least understand it. That leaves very few people to trust.



Fuck it, I'm out.

"event","And I get the distinct impression that the battle has just begun.
We met, the rat of a man and I, today at four. Our discussion was brief, though throughout, I noted his right hand remained in his pocket. Here's a synopsis, such as it is, of what took place.
Me- ""Alastaire.""
Him- ""Tyrel.""
*brief handshake ((A weak one at that))*
Me- ""We have a problem. Your conduct on Friday was less than gentlemanly. One might even go so far as to say that it was despicable, bordering on rape.""
Him- *no reply, but for a slight shrug*
Me- ""I'm going to make this simple for you. She doesn't want to speak to you again. Don't phone her, don't even think her name. You are nothing to her, a foot-note in her history, perhaps. Just walk away.
Him- ""You woke me up for this?""
Me- *noncomittal shrug*
Him- ""I need my beauty sleep you know.""
Me- ""You certainly do. *pause* So, we are agreed then?""
Him- ""No.""
Me- *sigh* And why not? She wants no part of your life. What do you intend on doing?""
Him- ""Maybe I'll send her flowers.""
Me- ""You'd be waisting your money, and your time.""
Him- ""I have a great deal of both. The fact is, I don't trust you, and so you could just as likely be lying to me.""
Me- ""And the fact that she hasn't returned your how many calls isn't proof enough for you?""
Him- ""Two.""
Me- ""Regardless, she's entrusted this matter to me, because she no longer considers you. You are nothing. You're only making yourself look worse... to me, and to her.""
Him- ""Well, since she's never going to be speaking to me again, that doesn't really matter. And you don't mean shit to me.""
Me- ""I honestly don't care to hear my standing in your mind, as it doesn't matter. Give up, walk away...""
Him- ""Where did you grow up?""
Me- ""Pardon?""
Him- ""Where did you grow up?""
Me- ""In this very city.""
Him- ""So using words like 'Entrusted', and that fake british accent are all bullshit then, right?""
Me- *shaking my head* ""I don't think this discussion is based on my flaws or faults, but rather on yours.""
Him- ""Fine, we'll talk about my fake ass british accent.""
Me- ""I'm not going to discuss the ridiculous somantics of this with you, boy. The fact is, you are no longer a part of her life. Deal with it.""
Him- ""I have to say I must commend you on how you dealt with Jen.""
Me- *another sigh* ""Dealt with Jen?""
Him- ""She made advances on you, and you rejected them. I have to commend you... you played her well.""
Me- ""I'm sorry, but you seem to be misinformed. Jen never made any moves one me. She was my friend, to be sure, but she never made moves on me.""
Him- ""That's not how I hear it.""
Me- *shaking head* Alastaire, I'd like to think we were both gentlemen, despite obvious proof on your part to the contrary.""
Him- *laughing* ""No, we're not.""
Me- ""Speak for yourself. I'm trying to deal with this in as civil and cordial a manner as possible. It comes down to this. You're done. Go find some other woman who's willing to fall for.. whatever it is that you have.""
Him- ""Whatever it is WE had. You have to remember, I had her first.""
Me- *slight chuckle* ""Indeed, you did. And now, she is with me.""
Him- ""Sad but true.""
Me- ""You should focus on the truth of it. That should tell you something.""
Him- ""It certainly should.""
Me- ""Like, perhaps, that I am better than you. She's chosen to be with me... she loves me. I am the better man.""
*mutual pause*
Me- ""Dissapear, boy.""
Him- ""There goes that pretentious accent again...""
*we walk our seperate ways*

So, given that... I'd say this is far from over... However, I also have no intention of speaking to or meeting up with this contemptable filth again. Perhaps if both Holly and I ignore him from here on, he'll realize the absolute truth of the message I was sending. He is barely the shadow in her life... intangible, and irresolute under the glaring light of truth. My he find his home in the shadows of his solitude.

If he doesn't, however... Then cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war...

"event","""The game is only fun until you get caught, isn't it Sin? Yeah, I know how your mind works. I've been chasin' scum like you for fifteen years... After that long, you really learn what it's like to be inside the head o' some o' the worlds sickest fucks. An' believe me, 'Simon Sinclair', there ain't no one sicker'n you. 'Cept maybe me."" His voice echoes hollowly through the warehouse's main hold. Stealth is not this man's modus operandi, I can tell you that much right now. Niether is rational thought.
I hear him closing in on me, about twenty feet away. Ten... Seven... And there it is, a rookie mistake. The barrel of his gun comes around the corner before he does, the maw of the beast ready to bite what it cannot see. It's only a moment, the briefest second, but our lives are measured in the slow, steady beats of our hearts... second by second.
I flash forward, garrote wire stretched between my hands like some kind of sadistic cat's cradle, wrapping it about his wrist with lightning speed. The gun goes off once before his hand his severed from his wrist, all before I've even seen his face. Losing one's hand is usually something to give you pause for thought, for reflection... a pause that may well last long enough to get you killed. But I have to give credit to this guy, he's a pro. Without hesitation, an axe comes around the corner next, bound for my neck. I smash my watch against the side of the crate I'm pressed up against, and try to keep from tossing my cookies as a moments temporal and entropic dissassociation hits me. As luck would have it, the head of the axe comes flying off, inches from my neck. Sure, it still cuts me a good one, but at least I get to keep my noggin. Gotta run, can't take him on open ground.
The next few moments are the run across the knife's edge. Fall too far to either side, and you're kissing the fleshless lips of death. Spend too long on the blade, though, and it'll cut right through you. I jump straight up, manipulating the gravity around me for a brief moment, with but a thought, taking me to the top of the box. A few shots ring out beneath me, but those are in vain. That's right, you fucker, keep waisting your ammo.
I race across the shipping crates and old boxes littered throughout this room, my hand reflexively going to my side, where the black 9mm beretta rests. This is going to be a long night, and one I'm not particularily certain I'll live to see the end of.

"event","So, I'm at Holly's place last night, relaxing and watching movies. A good time is being had by all. We then hear, from the other room, a message being left on her cell-phone's voice-mail. Instantly, we both know it's her ex, Alastair. Up for a bit of a laugh, we opt to listen to the message... Suffice it to say, the dear boy did not dissapoint. A slight bit of poetry, an epic trifle of a poem if you will, was left on the voice-mail. I'll spare you the details thereof, but it was definately good for a laugh. It's then that we decide to have me phone him back, not Holly... *evil chuckle*
Him- Hello...
Me- Hey, is this Alastair?
Him- ... yes...
Me- Hi, this is Tyrel. Holly's boyfriend.
Him- Oh hey, how's it going?
Me- Not too bad, I guess. Actually, I've got Holly's phone, you see, not her.
Him- ... really...
Me- Yeah... And I was just curious as to why you were leaving random bits of love poetry on her voice-mail...
Him- Well, see, I called and all I got was the machine, right? So I'm thinkin', ""I have to say something clever..."" And so I just spouted off a verse I had memorized...
Me- Riiight. You'll understand, of course, my reticence in this matter.
Him- Oh, absolutely, I completely understand.
Me- Well, I just wanted to make certain there was nothing I should be concerned abou... ((interupted))
Him- Do you think I'm going to try to steal your girlfriend?
Me- It's a distinct possibility that you'll try, yes.
Him- Well, to be honest with you, I am.
Me- Come now, Alastair, do you really think now is the best time to be honest with me? You'll have to understand if I'm cautious in this matter...
Him- I would think less of you if you weren't.
Me- Well, I suppose this leaves us at an impass.
Him- Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call it an impass...
Me- And what would you go so far as to call it?
Him- It's simply the nature of our interaction from hereon.
Me- Hm. Agreed. I'll discourage you from trying, as I do truly hope you're used to losing.
Him- I am.
Me- *smirk* Well, I suppose that concludes our business. I'll let Holly know you called.
Him- Yeah... thanks.
Me- Good evening.
Him- Cheerio. *click*
Holly/Me- *GUFFAW*

Really, it was quite entertaining."

"event","Look, ladies and gentlemen... Here, I have words. Words for you. Words to which a healthy dose of heed should and shall be paid.
There are a great many things in my life that I find unsatisfactory. There are things occouring in my temporal/space bubble that I could honestly do without. There are also things that drive me to the hights of joy and happiness, without taint or question.
And I'll thank you not to explore them unless invited.
Too many people take undue care and attention upon their list of responsibilities toward me... I'll explain in simple words why this needs to stop. 
When another person has a problem, they tell me. They tell me so they can get the weight off of their chest, and to acqurie some advice, ((which they have no intention of following anyway, I might add.)) Often, I can solve whatever problems are running rampant in their lives, as I'm remarkably good at that. I have few enough talents, but I fix people well.
Now, because of this, these same people choose to take it upon themselves to fix me.
Poor idea.
I don't tell other people my problems because, really, it would be an exercise in futility. I know what's wrong in my life, and nine times out of ten, I know precisely what I'd have to do to change that... I don't need others telling me that which I already know. Added to that, I won't speak freely of my problems because, simply, they cannot be solved by any other than I.
It's always the same, you know?
""Look, Ty, we have to talk. You're obviously messed up in the head. C'mon, what's buggin' ya?""
At this point, if pressed, I word-vomit everything that's bothering me. The response?
""Hmm... Yeah... That's.. that's somethin' else. What, uh, what're you gonna do about it?""
Thanks for that.
I don't want those of you who have tried and failed to feel shunted or put off by this post, but I can't put it any plainer than this. I trust three people in my life. Three. The odds are surprisingly good that you aren't one of them. Because of this, I feel absolutely no need to voice my problems. Yes, I have shit going on in my head, and I'm sorry if that comes through in my persona while we associate... But you can't change it, you can't fix me. If it bothers you to see me like this, don't see me. I'm sorry, but that's the way things are to be.
I trust that those of you who read this will be so kind as to pass it to those who don't. This was the most public venue available for so verbose an excursion... Thank you...

Dead Boy's Poem- Nightwish

Born from silence, silence full of it
A perfect concert my best friend
So much to live for, so much to die for
If only my heart had a home
Sing what you can't say
Forget what you can't play
Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes
Walk within my poetry, this dying music
- My loveletter to nobody
Never sigh for better world
It's already composed, played and told
Every thought the music I write
Everything a wish for the night
Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin
Died for the beauty the one in the garden
Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom
Failed in becoming a god
Never sigh...
""If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it
Remember only the verse, songmaker's cry the one without tears
For I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.
Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality
where being wanted became a thrill I never knew
The sweet piano writing down my life""
""Teach me passion for I fear it's gone
Show me love, hold the lorn
So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me
I'm sorry
Time will tell (this bitter farewell)
I live no more to shame nor me nor you
And you... I wish I didn't feel for you anymore...""
A lonely soul
An ocean soul"

"event","Do you know what I hate most about working nightshift?
It's not the fact that I have to sleep in the morning.
It's not that I'm working when most sane people are soundly asleep.
It's that I don't get to see anyone I want to. I mean... while I sleep, the woman I love is free. While I'm awake, she's asleep, or at school. HELL.
Further, the friends that I've got, save maybe two... are all busy/working/sleeping when I'm available. This leaves me with A LOT of time to myself.
I hate that.
Fuck this.

I was bitching, and moaning, and pissing, and whining.
To no avail.
What good was it doing me? What good could it do me?
For too long I've let myself be mired in self-doubt and pity. No more.
There's no one left to trust.
Nowhere left to go.
The war is raging on my doorstep alone... and only me left to fight it.
I will win.

"event","I had been thinking about a few things recently... things fantastical, things mundane, but thinking of things none-the-less. A thought found occassion to escape from the morass of it's fellows and entreatise upon my attention. It spoke to me in hushed tones, not wanting to grab the notice of those it left behind, fearing that they might find it's hiding spot, near my ear, and take it from her. She spoke to me, saying the most wonderful things, telling me of that which I may one day accomplish. I smiled inwardly, knowing not where these lovely words came from, travelling on perfumed breath, yet I listened contentedly, soaking it all in, for I must say, this does not happen often to me. Too often my thoughts are a chaotic mass the likes of which I have no intention of wading through, let alone sorting. And so, this midnight sylph spoke to me, telling me stories of triumph, of failure, and of everything in between, until finally the sun crested the line of houses outside my window, and poured it's light in. Alas, my messenger of sweet and sorrow was caught directly in the path of one of the sun's lances, and it pinned her to her place. Illuminated thus, her fellows noted her absence, and her presence, all at once, and swiftly flew to gather about her.. The mass of them coalsced about my attentions, dimming them, dulling that fine edge my dear muse had so carefully honed to such a razor point over the past hours. Just like that, she was lost to me, swept up to whatever fait awaits those attentive thoughts that get pulled aside. With their multitude of voices clamoring in my brain, I wept a dirge for my fallen lady. Truly, a night to remember."

"event","And it sets in again... That hollow, inadequate, loathesome gray that fills the soul to overflowing with nothing... It's difficult to describe being filled entirely by emotional nothing, and more difficult still to contend with it. I'll be in my trailer.

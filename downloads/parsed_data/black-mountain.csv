"event","as i was reading some elses post i started thinking about life and i asked my self questions. why are we alive? why do we exist? and after about an hour of thinking i came up with the answers to life in my opinon. First there is no purpose to our life. we are nothing but intelegent animals. there is no god, heaven and hell, purpose to life. they are all factors of evolution. because if u think about it everything about god and stuff it dosent make sense. why would he just all of a sudden decide to put us humans on earth and make us wait thousands of years to develop a language. and why were dinosaurs on the earth before us? so if adam and eve were the first people on the earth dose that mean were all brothers and sisters. and if we are y do we have different skin colors. and y do azns have skinny eyes and black people extremely curly hair. basically its all because of evolution. i hate it when littel kids say if evolution is true then y arent monkeys evolving today. first its because we arent monkeys. monkey are a totally different species. we developed from primates and so did monkeys. and the truth is we still are evolving today. 100 years ago people did grow over 6 feet anf live past 60 years of age. now a days we have 13 year olds over 6 ft and people living to be 120 years old. humans still are evolving, people just dont notice it as it happens. and y do u think people that live in africa are black, its because they need darker skin to protect them from the heat. and people that live in the cold regions of the world are white because the sun was never a threat to them. you see life dosent really have meaning and i could ramble on and on about it, were all just going to die some day and when we do die...thats it, thats the end of our life, nothing matters anymore and no one can prove me wrong untill they die themselves. and im not even high. this kinda stuff rolls through my head all the time."

"event","So today i woke up. not unusual in my daily routine. i was watching tv when it hit me i havent eaten in over 12 hours so i decided to go get some waffles, blueberry to be exact. i popped em in the toaster and waited. after about a minute and a half the came up looking tasty so i buttered them and put maple syrup on them. walkin to the couch to watch my morning tv i forgot to get my glass of milk. so i went back to the kitchen and poured nice cold glass. after the morining came i went shopping with my sister and as usual she got pissed at me for complaing the whole time but i got some creamsicles so it wasnt that bad. then i came home changed into gym shorts got my mp3 took my skate board and headed down the long winding street to sycamore only to make a left to the gym. i ran some, lifted some, drank some then bailed outta there home. walking up the big ass hill on which my house lays was a short cut which was there all my life but then ruined by construction of houses which really irretates me. but it all started when i wanted to see if my dad was home walking past his house not seeing his car made me sad i havent seen or hung out with him in a long time and i really want to soon. but anyway the once nice area where the short cut was, now deystroyed by houses was to the right of me i noticed how they built theyre fence a little to the left leaveing a walk way on the right where i could sneek under the fence cause there was a little revine down the side which left a hole under it. after walking up the slope i saw that they put bars to close off the hole but stupidly leaving a high one for me to grab onto and hop it so i did and i felt sneaky for finally re-newing the short cut of our neigborhood. after getting home i took a shower and set up my journal with the help of lovely heidi(shes great). so thanks again but now im tired and want to lay down for little.

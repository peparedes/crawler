I'm going to the out patient surgeon tomorrow morning so i'll know more then. But i would guess that I'll strictly be cheering in the special olympics til, well, for 6-8 weeks. Gymnastics is obviously also out, as is most other exercise. Mostly cos from what i hear, the sweat just isn't worth the trouble of a one-handed shower or the itchiness of the plaster that i have practically up to my elbow.</div>

"event","Okay, so all the grief with the 360 groups is over. There are still two groups doing it, but the other two, including mine, aren't. Instead, I'm flying.&nbsp; 

I've been sick again this week with a stomach thing, so I haven't been at cheer and haven't had a chance to try the stunt, and so when I got to cheer tonight I asked beck if we're flying, and was very excited to hear that we were. And then we did it. 

Why did I agree to this..... Okay, the flying I can sort of deal with. It is just at prep level. But they're dropping me! I mean, not accidentally! I don't like being dropped. I don't really like being cradled, either. In fact, I prefer to fall out of stunts. Anyway, apparently the effect will be really good, but its fricking scary.&nbsp; 

I was up there and they're like, ""okay, we're gonna drop, ready..."" Um, no. I'm not. But I don't get a say in the matter!&nbsp;

Then at cheer tonight Becky, Lesh and I <b>got the 360!!!!! </b>YAYAYAYAYAY!!!!!!!!!!! This is the thing that has been weighing on our hearts and minds for the last 3 weeks. We were football-yelling when we got it! And we got it a few times, too. The last one was the best. Its super exciting. Trust me.

We were messing around with some tumbling, too. The funny thing is that I'm not just doing a main tumbling line <i>between </i>the rest of the team who'll be crouched down (when usually I have to be the <i>only</i> one on the floor), but a backflip - no, sorry, a <i>standing</i> backflip (snort), <i>and </i>a backward walkover (double snort). The only backward walkovers I can do are when Kip picks me up and turns me over. Although the first few he tried, and most of the later ones, I just ended up lying sprawled on the floor. I really don't think I have the flexibility in my shoulders and back. But apparently I will, in two months (which is when the first comp is.) Mmmmm...

And we attempted a few backsaults into the pit. Which mostly consisted of me chickening out a few times, and then me doing a really little jump, forgetting to tuck, and Kip and Josh throwing me into the pit.

The point is that you don't acheive anything new if you always do the same thing.

Now. Lets apply that theory to gymnastics, shall we? Mmm hmm?

The problem is that people are afraid of failing... And maybe not even failing to lift the weight or eat breakfast, but afraid that if they do everything right they still won't get the results and then they really will have failed...  

I guess the difference is that if I fail at backsaults, I could end up breaking my neck........"

And then when we were done the room was completely tense and all the cheer-smiles were gone. And we learnt a bit more and i'm in the crappest spot with the crappest part. And all these people who can't dance have good spots. Which is a constant throughout the whole dance. And I understand if they're shorter, or have been there way longer than me, but scotty got the best spot and the best bit, and as far as I can tell she couldn't get the part and she's been there a shorter amount of time. And beck, who hates dancing got a better spot than me. I'm on my knees, for crying out loud.

And then I was sitting there feeling pretty sullen and probably looking the same, and jen turned around, pointed at herself, drew a heart in the air, pointed at me and turned around again.

And it was my mums actual birthday today, and last year my sister and I took her out for lunch and this year she was at home by herself except for when I went to give felicity krispy kremes and mum had gone to the zoo to see the tigers. She went to the zoo by herself on her birthday. I don't want to teach combat and go to cheer next week, I want to train my group and go to gymnastics and see all the people that i haven't seen in weeks cos of all the reasons.

The worst thing is that hes <font size=""3"">not</font> <font size=""4"">answering his phone</font><font size=""5"">!!!!!!<br /><font size=""2""><br />Anyway, I've had enough. I'm switching teams. Again. Possibly for good, although Rob tried very hard to stop me saying for good, for good. I'm not sure he understands how much to not believe the words of the broken hearted.<br /><br />OOH! And lots of you will be very happy to hear that my hair has gone back to (almost) black. My sister was so relieved. But its funny working with people who have never seen it dark before. ""ooh, you changed your hair! Do you like it?"" Um, yes. Thats why its been black, on and off, since I was 17...<br /><br />Anyway, I've been told that I have to see this movie, napoleon dynamite. Only the video store (the one near my parents house cos I still have no proof of residence) NEVER has it. So I bought it. On the internet. I miss buying dvds on the internet.

"event","I've been sick the last few days. I got the flu that's been going around... Only I got the added nausea and dizzyness. Weird dizzyness, like I couldn't focus on anything. And not in a blurry-where-are-my-glasses way, but more like I'd taken too many drugs and when I tried to focus on something my head started spinning. Driving to work yesterday morning was certainly... interesting.

I was so sick that I got someone to fill combat yesterday. And then I didn't go to either gymnastics or cheerleading. I slept for about 18 hours... Except for when I woke up and decided I wanted tomato soup (all time second-favourite sick food). But when I went to 'make' soup, I remembered that I'd broken the magnetic bit off the can opener trying to open a jar a couple of weeks ago, and Pauline had thrown it out. Plus I'd been craving lollies, so having to buy a new can opener was the perfect excuse to go to woolies and get lollies. As soon as I'd had soup I went back to sleep.

And then this morning I woke up feeling slightly less sick and very very refreshed. Until I got to work and actually tried speaking to people. My sentences did not resemble everyone elses normal earth-sentences. And mine were not much more advanced. Mine were not sentences. They were just words, with long long breaks in between other words.

Oh and Pauline is away for the weekend. And it would be Party at My House, except I'm sick and way busy tomorrow and I'm going to Sydney on Sunday....

Okay, I'm done. I'm going back to bed."

"event","You know, I had a pretty good week at work this week. I mean, I cried a couple of times on Thursday....

But a few people I've written programs for in the past have had some really good results. One really big guy went to his doctor last week, and he's lost a few kilos, but his blood pressure is down. The doctor was really happy, and said that he sees a point where some people go where they can't turn back. And he'd been worried that this guy had already gone to that point. And now he's turned back. He told the doctor everything that he'd been doing (ie, everything I told him to do), and the doctor seemed very happy and encouraged him to keep at it!

And one lady (who doesn't speak much english and put my patience to the test) only lost about 0.8 of a kilo, but when I took her measurements they were all pretty much the same except for one. Her waist. I had to redo it to check, cos she lost over 10 cm from it!

And then my scared lady. One of the first programs I did. Ruben did her third last weekend, and I had a chat to her, and she's lost about 15 kilos, and dropped a dress size. Her family gave her lots of gift vouchers for her birthday so she can buy new clothes. She was <i>petrified </i>when she came in the first time, and now shes in there twice a day sometimes. Usually when her family refuses to go for a walk cos its too cold outside. They stay in front of the telly, and she comes and walks on a treadmill. And then the next morning shes out the front waiting for me at 5:50.....

And one lady who was in a car accident and has no vision on the right side of either eye, and whose right arm is much weaker.... She had gone through like 4 or 5 programs... I gave her unilateral arm exercises, so she only works one side at a time, and tries not to do more on the good side than the weak side... Anyway, she came and told me she wants to stick with her current program for a bit longer, and its made such a difference. Her balance has improved so much that she was able to run on a treadmill without holding on for the first time since the accident! Which for some people might not seem like something to get excited about, but its had similar impacts on the rest of her life as well. Very cool.

So anyway... Despite the tears, I had a good week..."

The best thing is that I totally missed my computer. It became my best friend during my thesis days. I missed my keyboard (I love my keyboard) and I missed my screen (which is bigger than my TV... and yes, my TV is rather small but I digress).

Remind me the next time I move to get a place with the laundry <i>inside</i> the house. Its cold out and my bed is so warm....."

Me: <i> (pointing to the soap squeezer)</i> Is this soap?
Pauline: Yep.
Me: <i>(squeezes some and out and starts to lather)</i> Is it soap or dishwashing detergent?
Pauline: Well, yeah... But yes.

Me: No, thats the rubbish.
P: Yeah, you can't recycle paper.
M: What do you mean you can't recycle paper?
P: I thought it was just plastic and cans.
M: <i>(Tying recycling up <u>in a plastic bag</u>)</i> Of <i>course</i> you can recycle paper! I'm not actually sure you can recycle plastic bags.....

She puts the recycling in <i>bags</i> and then in the bin! Weird."

"event","Last week on, like, Tuesday, my right headlight stopped working. When I got in my car on Friday after work, it was working. So I rang my parents and asked them if my dad had come and fixed it while I was at work. Apparently he hadn't. And then, when I turned the car back on, it wasn't working again. So I got out and tapped (kicked) it, and it went back on. Halfway home, it went out again. 

Then, and this is related cos its the second weird thing that happened, I was watching all the stuff I'd taped that week, starting with the biggest loser. After the biggest loser, I pressed stop to fast forward to desperate housewives* and desperate housewives came on! And it was an episode I hadn't seen, so I thought it was the one I missed a while ago, and it took me til right at the end to realise it was the one from 4 days ago. So then I watched the beginning of the episode that I had on tape.

<i> Then </i> on Sunday, on my way to combat, my brakes failed. But not as badly as last time, where I'd had my license for less than a year, and I had to turn the car off and use the handbrake. The brake fluid line had a hole in it, and the brake fluid had leaked out. My dad brought enough brake fluid to get it to the mechanic, where it stayed last night.

Which gave me a very good reason to sleep at my parents last night, and drink way too much champagne, and have two serves of birthday cake (hee hee hee) and eat blue cheese. Oh, and it was Felicity's birthday. We don't have champagne and birthday cake on a regular basis. Although we do have blue cheese, but usually its blue brie, and the cheese from last night was <i> really powerful</i>. And when I say powerful, I mean smelly. Yum.

"event","One of our neighbours left us a note saying that in case we were wondering why her car was sitting the carport, her number plates were stolen while she was doing a quick 20 minute shop at Mawson.

I don't think she realises that neither Pauline nor myself are at home long enough or awake enough or <i> care </i> enough to notice what her car is doing on a daily basis. I guess she just wants to tell people. And, well, now you all know as well. 

Anyway, I'm at my parents house while ours is being fumigated. I thought I was going to be here for a few days, but it turns out we can go back after 2 hours, which means I brought WAY too much stuff. 

OOH! And I gmail-chatted with Hayley! So cool! Gmail rocks!

Of course, then I had to have a conversation with my mum about gmail, which means she asks a question, I answer it, she asks the same question, I answer it, and eventually my dad intervenes with something like ""I think thats a yes!""
And then mum asks a question that makes even less sense, and eventually I put my head on the table and moan that shes killing me. Something about whether you have to get a new email address to use gmail. Well, yes. Its gmail. But can I use the chat feature with a current email. Well, no... Its gmail... Oh. Okay. So if I got that, would I be able to talk to people overseas... Yes... Would they have to have gmail? Okay! I'm done!

Felicity's not here. Shes feeding the poor people.

And I'm not telling you about my weekend. Lets just say it was bad, and the high point was watching The Body.

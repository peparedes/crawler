"event","I have figured out my problem with relationships.  I get bored.  I somehow see myself as a single, moderatly well off man.  Who lives in either a small, cozy house, or a nice apartment (likely the latter), and is not tied down by a woman.  I mean no offense by this, but I personally have been thinking about why I screw things up in every relationship that I am in, and the conclusion that I have come to is:  I lose interest after a while.  Not even interest in the girl, but interest in being tied to one.  Maybe this will pass, but as I see it now, I like it, and I do not want it to pass.  Of course the problem then is that I have gotten myself in another situation.  The thing is, I must figure out how to let this one down easy, or at least delay it until she gets bored too.  Or until I learn to... focus... I guess.

Anyway... I just wanted to post this so that I can come back here and read it later, when I change again.  The song in my head now is... Damnit I changed again: The Offspring.  That and Everything to Everyone: Everclear.  They relate to me, anyone who knows me can tell, especially the Everclear one.

Also, Cake kicks ass.  And church mission trips... and church as well, blow ass.

There, I am done being fake.  Fuck this."

"event","Well, many things happened in Europe, many good things.  Some with lasting effects.  *smile*  I will not post stories and such, if you want to hear about it, you should probably come find me, or tell me to find you, I am happy to tell anyone, but I refuse to type them out.  I will however post a picture of my new puppy.  Her name is Tinta (Spanish for ink) and she is a pure-bred black lab.  Buster's brother none the less.

"event","Okay, I wish my trip would be that cool, but I am going to Europe.  Today.  It should be really fun, and will have some great memories afterwards, no doubt.  I will of course, miss talking to everyone while I am gone, but I suppose I will just have to suck that up and deal with it.  Have a great time here in good old Wooldinville.  Party City, USA.

P.S. - I'll be back on the 12 of July I think."

"event","So, I was watching tv last night, and I happened on American Dad.  Greatest show ever, along with Family Guy.  Wow, I was laughing so hard... I almost peed my pants.  Then the stupid return of the mummy went on till like 3 am, and my dad woke me up a wee bit before 8 am.  Needless to say, I was tired, grumpy, and not so surprisingly, horny.  But anyway, I went to Safeway, bought like 28 doughnuts, 14 bagels and a loaf of bread.  Came home and started to tear apart this house that my dad was making me work on.  James was there, and we ate doughnuts.  They were good.  Then, I had to drive this giant truck to the dump, because we were running out of space to put the random stuff we were pulling out.  In the end, I hauled away about 1750 pounds of garbage.  Which I had to move twice.  Great.  So, of course, I'm super tired, used to driving the truck (which has crazy steering, you have to turn the wheel around like 5 times before you can get any turn out of the wheels) and then I have to give Elaine back her shoe, but she is not home, and so I'm going to give it to Allison because then she will give it to Elaine and I can go out to dinner with my parents and not worry about how Elaine has only one shoe.  Which is quite funny actually, but, since I know Elaine will read this, I didn't actually say or think that, I think it is horrible that you had to go a whole day without a shoe.  Anywho, I hit the side of the garage on the way out, and that sucked penis and balls.  It dented the car, broke the garage door and broke the side of the garage.  I fixed the garage and the garage door, and cleaned up the car somewhat, so it doesn't look that bad.  My parents aren't even that pissed, which is really freaking sweet.  And, life is good.  Except if you are Elaine, and didn't tell me what house you were in, and your left shoe is now sitting outside, cold, with only an unopened package to talk to.  It is however clean, and you could still smell the soap when I left it there.

P.S. - Draw your own conclusions."

"event","When I say ""black people"" I really mean black men.  Nobody ever hears about badass black women.  Ever.  It is almost like they do not exist, they are not dragging down the race.  Black men are so awesome because they are single.  Single means being a pimp of course.  When a black man grows up, he aspires to be a pimp.  White men want to be bankers, or office managers, or other tedious jobs that pay unholy amounts but slowly kill you.  To what avail?  The money flows like a river back to the black men.  They sit there, enjoying the fruits of their work for free, all the time charging by the minute for white men to catch a glimpse of it.  What a scam.  What a fucking scam.  God damn it I hate black people.  Unless I could be one, in which case, I would love them.  The thing that is ironic about this, is that us saltines opressed the black men for hundreds of years, and we treated them like shit.  Now, they are getting back at us, they are funny, we are not.  They have a monopoly on women, we do not.  They can invent words and phrases, and do whatever the hell they want and still be cool.  We obviously cannot.  White men attempt to be like black men, and then they write books about it.  They write about how much black people suck, how dumb they are, and how much better they are at jumping.  Basically black people should probably rule the earth, and us white people should follow their lead.  The world would be so much more fun.  Plus, there would be no virgins above the age of 12.  Booze and drugs would replace milk and flour, and a standard equipped car would include hydraulic lifters, a stereo capable of killing a small child, and a really cool set of fuzzy dice.  Damn I would give anything to be black.  Bitches and Hoes."

Sporadic adventures are some of my fondest memories slash most fun times.  Speaking of that, I am attempting to have a burning party slash end of school party in the afternoon of the last day of school.  There will be much fire, if everyone brings assignments and papers from school.  There will also be food, but I think I may have to make it be a potluck, cause I do not have the funds or the energy to make a bunch of food.

I have a field trip tomorrow, so suck it.  Totally do not have any classes tomorrow, gone from 7:30-5.  And to think... I almost did my english homework.  It should be pretty sweet since Microsoft has like free drinks, and really cheap, high quality food.  I actually want to work there a lot.  Hopefully our game will compete against the other schools.  The graphics are so hardcore... and the sounds are sweet.  The content is solid, everything is pointing to a good day tomorrow.  And I will not forget that I can park in the senior lot tomorrow.

"event","So, for anyone who is in Accelerated Chemistry, here are the answers to the questions assigned for tonight.  I think they are actually right, and I will try to include steps that lead to the answer along with the answer its self.

Notation - (number) is the charge.  A number after an element is the number of them (subscript).  And of course the number before a compound or element is the coefficient for that item.

38.  a)  MnO4 + ClO2 --> MnO2 + ClO4
Mn(+7)O4(-2 ea) + Cl(+3)O2(-2 ea) --> Mn(+4)O2(-2 ea) + Cl(+7)O4(-2 ea)

Oxidation:
4e(-) + ClO2 --> ClO4
4e(-) + 4OH + ClO2 --> ClO4 + 2H2O

Reduction:
MnO4 --> MnO2 + 3e(-)
MnO4 + 2H2O --> MnO2 + 4OH + 3e(-)

The common multiplier for each is the other.  i.e. - Multiply the 4e(-) in the Oxidation by 3, and the 3e(-) in the Reduction by 4 so that both are 12, and can then cancel.

(4e(-) + 4OH + ClO2 --> ClO4 + 2H2O) * 3
12OH + 3ClO2 --> 3ClO4 + 6H2O

(MnO4 + 2H2O --> MnO2 + 4OH + 3e(-)) * 4
4MnO4 + 8H2O --> 4MnO2 + 16OH

The final answer then, after subtracting like compounds from both sides is:
4MnO4 + 3ClO2 + 2H2O --> 4MnO2 + 3ClO4 + 4OH

Okay, that took forever to type, so I'm just going to type out the answers that I got for the rest of them, if you need any help on a specific one, just ask me, I'm happy to help.

b)  10OH + 2Cr(3+) + 3ClO(-) --> 5H2O + 2CrO4(2+) + 3Cl(-)
c)  6OH + I(-) + 6Mn(3+) --> 6Mn(2+) + IO3(-) + 3H2O

39.  Okay, I am going to try and make a chart for this, if it doesn't work then tough.  The pattern is Ox then Red for each question.

                Element | Agent | Question |
Oxidation     Cl          Mn          (a)     
Reduction     Mn        Cl            (a)     
Ox                N          Cu           (b)

Ox                P          N              (c)
Red              N          P               (c)
Ox               Sn         Bi              (d)
Red              Bi         Sn              (d)
Ox               Cr         Cl              (e)
Red             Cl          Cr             (e)
Ox               I            V              (f)

Best thing ever, free access to the pit.  Holy shit, endfest was so kickass it is not even fathomable - I don't even think that is a word, but you get the idea.  Definitly going next year, and USE was fucking incredible.  Between them and the Kaiser Chiefs, I would have to give the best performance award, USE being ahead of course.  Everyone else just stood there, the Kaiser Chiefs guy was intense, and threw the mic into the crowd and stuff, and they are a good band.  USE of course rules, in the pit, dancing, partying, shit, this is what life is about.  My ears are still ringing and my sweatshirt smells a bit like pot.  I was kinda worried that I would get pulled over for some stupid thing, and then the cop would smell pot on me... but that didn't happen.  Even though I noticed I was doing 80 and saw this cop ahead of me, but I got it under control just in time.

I have actually run out of things to think about, and so I sit and think about things to think about.  There is something wrong with this.  I went to the park today and read my chemistry book, where I learned that there is no way that I can get the grade I need on this test.  I was looking for someone (plural too) to study with because then I think I would have understood more of what I read, but such is life.  The worksheet was not that bad, but it never is, and then the test is this random other stuff that no one knows.  Oh well, bring it on.  Oh, and a math quiz and effing 2 hours of Mr. Lucas to get me ready.  It is a fucking conspiracy.

I have a very large quantity of popcorn still, and it actually still takes pretty good.  Which brings me to this crazy idea:  We should go to the lake tomorrow.  The lake is Cottage Lake, just in case anyone doesn't realize this, right, anyway, so ya, we (being anyone who wants to come) should go to the lake for a few hours, play some ultimate frisbee or something, and have a pre-Lost party.  Since, I will never be able to go to a Lost party since my parents get mad when I am not home by 8 pm on weekdays.  Otherwise, I would suggest that the partay be here.

I want to have soccer practice, just like 6 people, and play some 3 on 3, at like WHS some time.  I saw some FCA people practicing today, and it made me nostalgic for school soccer, I miss the rythm, the excersise and the fun.  Talk to me if this sounds good to you, cause I am totally up for it.

I would say something crazy like, with love... but that is just odd.  So I wont.

Mostly because I know from experience that I have no idea how to study, and even if I did, it would never happen on its own.  So if anyone is up for that like say... tomorrow...

My oboe is all better now, and I love it.  I might even start practicing, since I have to perform an entire concerto with an orchestra.  Which, everyone should come to, it will be in December, so there is lots of time to not be busy.  I really do not know specific dates yet, since it is a long ways off.  None the less, I must practice.  Effing Mr. Lucas was gone today, WOOOOOOOOOOO.  I played catch with this kid from band, and with myself, it was fun.

I also experience hydrochloric acid, first hand.  Literally.  It actually does burn, no joke.

I patched it with some hot glue and a piece of a reed.  Although, nobody tell Mr. Lucas that, he still thinks that it is broken past the point of playability.  Once I helped my oboe, I went to orchestra, which was okay... until it was time to come home.  I was minding my own buisness, driving down 405.  The guy in front of me however, had drunk a few too many, or something.  First I thought it was my eyes, and I was like... oh shit, this is not good.  But then, after several people went to pass and then dropped back, I realized that the guy in front of me was really weaving across all 3 lanes.  The life-threatening part of this, I tried to pass him early on, before I noticed how bad it was, and he nearly drove into me.  It was almost as scary as the guy who ran the red light.  Oh well, I got home none the less.

Indoor soccer has become increasingly gay schedule wise, as we keep having to play the one team that we cannot seem to beat.  I wish we played the mexican team like, a lot more.  Or Prego's team for that matter, since I never got to actually play them.  Star Wars is going to kick major ass.  So is convo.  So is Endfest.  The next month is basically going to kick major ass.  And school will end.  SWEET.

"event","Well, today was quite interesting.  Redefining my opinion of an up-and-down day.  The morning was not that bad, school was as usual.  As the day progressed, it was looking to be a good day.  I got to miss Mr. Huybers for goodness sake, what can be better than that.  So, my teeth are clean apparently, and I got free gum from the dentist too.  Then, I was trying to install World of Warcraft, which was so nicely furnished to me by Carl.  It turns out that having fricken paranoid parents, who will not put a credit card online sucks balls.  In order to play, you have to either set up an account with a credit card, or buy a time card.  I thought getting the time card would be easy, just pop on down to Redmond, and buy one.  WRONG!  Just like the traffic on Friday, I was so wrong it is like, not even funny.  Well, on second thought, it is probably quite funny to those of you reading this, oh well.  EB Games is being bought out by GameStop, so they do not have it in stock.  The nearest place that they told me was in Sammamish, but the only cards they had were on hold for someone.  Then I moseyd (sp?) on over to Fred Meyer, sold out, Target, sold out.  I went dejectedly home and then I realized it was time to go to orchestra.  In lynnwood of course... from 7-9:30.  Now some of you quicker people will have realized that this post is within those time constraints.  Why am I not at orchestra you could wonder, well it turns out that it was moved to tomorrow.  Sweet, now I drove to Lynnwood for no reason.  So, on my way back, I stopped at Orange Julius, and Cinnabon in an attempt to cheer myself up.  Then... as I was walking back to the parking lot to drive home, I saw in front of me, that which I seek, a time card.  In fact, there were lots of them, so I bought one.  Sweet, now the day went from like, the worst ever, to much better.  Then I drove home, singing along to some Incubus, and life was good again.

Which turns out that I now officially hate cottonwood.  It gets in the eyes... mouth... lungs.  Shit, I have much more respect for the track kids who fight it out.

I got the new Weezer, and it is pretty good, despite what Candice will tell you.  I can't wait till Audioslave's newest, and then of course EndFest.  If anyone else wants to go with us, you have to get your own tickets.

Yestreday was probably the best day of my life.  School wasn't bad, we watched a movie in math, did nothing in english.  Huybers is fucking me over in science, and it didn't phase me a bit.  My mind was already on the road.  On the road to Sultan.  First we went to various banks, got various monies, went to top foods, went to party city and target.  We first went to elaine's house, where we met the infamous Eric.  There is something wrong with that guy, like seriously, his teeth or something.  He is really tense also.  Or else he is terrible at showing that he undertstands a joke.  Cause he was like, are you a good driver?  And I said, well, I haven't hit anything yet, even elaine's mom chuckled, and he was like, what?!  Ya, whatever.  We got 2 lightsabers (elaine) and a lightsaber for me, silly string, bling bling for james and an air horn.  Then zack decided to be a bitch and break his car, so we had to go pick him up.  We decided to surprise him with silly string + air horn.  Somehow he expected it, and was ready with a super soaker.  The battle that followed was intense.  Ending with me getting zack in the face with the silly string, and then it looking like I peed my pants.  Then off to candice's house where we regrouped and set off to Sultan.  So, it turns out that I was dead wrong about there being no traffic.  We should have taken 9 out of woodinville instead of 522, but oh well.  We set off the airhorn in my car, and then noticed that there was a cop like 4 cars ahead, and since I have like 2 months on my license, and elaine was in the car, we had to keep a lower profile.  Once kelsey stopped calling to tell me that I was wrong, and we got out of the traffic, we arrived in sultan to find that the other car, wo left after us got there before us, because they took the other way, and didn't have traffic.  Once in Sultan, we of course went to the bakery, and between us, we bought more than half of their chocolate cheescake.  It was really good.  Next, we went to... Dan's?... pizza and pasta place.  The pizza that elaine, james, and I split was good.  It gave me horrible indigestion from the garlic, but whatever.  Such is life.  We then were playing hackysack and frisbee in the parking lot, which was shared by this grocery store.  Some of the people in our group bought stuff in there, and then this lady kicked us out of the parking lot.  So, we went back home to woodinville.  Which really meant elaine's house.  But before we got there, we had to stop at a wayside chapel, took a picture there, and then as if that wasn't exciting enough, I got to pass this guy at like 95 as I split in between a toe truck and this other car.  Which, as it turned out, I did right before the turn onto Paradise Lake Road, so the guy that we passed got really pissed and honked his horn.  It was pretty sweet.  We only took Paradise Lake at like 60-70, which is slow in comparison to Candice, but what can I say, im a wus.  We cut through Rain Tree, where my beloved car broke 50,000 miles.  Of course that warranted another picture.  And we were off again, arriving at elaines.  Only to find that we were again beat by Brian Rakestraw.  Candice and the people in her car, except james, then left, for some reason or another.  Elaine's brother is vicious, he has like a collection of beating sticks.  Which leave horrible welts and cuts.  He also annihilated the broom handle.  I had no part in that.  All I did was try not to get killed.  Lightsaber battles, in the dark, was pretty freakin sweet, and then we played twisted system.  Which is okay I guess.  I got to like 91 once, but basically unless you are perfect, it gets to be impossible.  Then we just hung out for a little while, and I had to come home.  I took Allison and James home.  It was a hellja good day."

Soul Song

A master of beautiful tone
The boy enters a trance
Among the multitude he is alone
Beginning without a glance
His concentration is unbroken
As a songbird on a spring morning
The melody is a heavenly token
Springing from the soul without warning
The harmonics erupt like a volcano
Billowing in unearthly beauty

The boy lives for the thrill
The thrill of winning the game
A simple game played by simple people
The boy runs like the wind
Never tiring
He is there because his heart is there
Nothing can take this away
Being the best is of no importance
All that matters is that the game goes on

The diamond in the rough
A jewel for all eyes to behold
Passion like an inferno
In all things a competitor
Eyes sparkling like the stars above
Features in wonderful compliment
The fruits of the spirit abound
Completing the inner perfection
The boy has met his match"

I had a chance in the first half to score, and I was milliseconds to slow.  I really need better reaction time, and I need to expect things better.  I did however nearly break the foot of the kid who blocked the shot, so that is what he gets.

On other notes, school fricken blows.  Um, I really enjoy late night aim talks when very deep things are brought up.  I also enjoy having a god damn open conversation with someone.  I am so sick of all the convolusions of people's emotions and the meanings of a hug, or the meaning of a smile.  Probably be cause I am insecure (ask Kelsey) and I can't figure them out but whatever.  It's my livejournal, and I'm whining, it's no different than real life.  Not that it is a good thing, but it is my nature.

I got this hecka sexy MP3 player tape deck adapter that I am going to try out when we go to Sultan.  That way I can pick what I'm listening to, sweet.  Like Journey for instance.  That band fricking kicks ass.  I don't care what anyone says about my choice of music.  Me and Will know what's up (Grammar is for bitches).

I also got my Star Wars Episode III tickets today, and yes Kelsey I even got one for you.  This should be really tight, and my mom was like all, nice abotu everything, I suspect that something is going down behind the scenes.  Oh well, I now have a grand total of 40 cents.  SWEET!

Being broke rules, I had like 3 dollars in dimes and nickels, and I gave them to this Radio Shack guy when I bought the adapter.  He was like, whatever works man, and I was like... right on.

The one thing that I just thought about right now, which would pretty much solve all the problems of the world would be some kind of thing that allowed someone to focus perfectly on something.  If that was possible, then everything would be much better, and the side effect could be that it cures lazyness.  Those two problems are a few that I have.  If I was half as lazy as I am now, I totally would have 'A's on all my classes, and I would not have missed that stupid test qualification by 2 points.  There are a few things that suck worse than everything, take for intance the fact that I am a nerd.

This all started a long time ago, when I was better at math than most of the people my age.  Then it was rekindled today when Allsion was like, I am going to fail math.  So then I said, ""Hey, I could teach you.""  And just like that, I have become a teacher.  Ya, so if anyone else needs mathematical support and are not taking core... Give me a shout.  I hate and despise the Core + program, mostly because I don't understand it.  Anything that I don't understand does not deserve to be in existence.  Well, okay, tahts a lie, but everyone agrees with me that Core sucks.  Anyone you ask will agree with this opinion, even the teachers teaching it.

Anywho, Stevens Pass was fricken cold on Saturday, and the zipper on my coat stuck to my face once.  It was that cold.  But, the backside was open, and it was amazing.  I have learned that leaning back when in the air on a snowboard is the last thing that you want to do.  Since I ended up doing a sideways face plant.  It was pretty hardcore, just like the Quarterbacking song that Zack needs to let me listen to.

The crazy other team's coach who was like blind to his players doing anything, and getting all mad at us for barely touching them.

I have a hunch why that might be, and I know that it is because of the people that surround me.  My pre-holiday activities were a blast.  I have been ordered to have a party in July celbrating Christmas (ask Will...) so look forward to something like that but only if someone reminds me because there is no way that I will remember.

So, I watched Spiderman 2 today.  Ya, it's an okay movie, but it made me realize something very important about my life.  I realize this is totally cliche, and that everyone probably realizes this, but I am going to point it out anyway.  Candice, I know you are going to say something like, ""Well I'm glad your happy.""  Or something gloomy like that.  Cheer up everyone!  There is far too much sadness here.  Okay, so to my stupid little thing.  Movies are based upon a person who has conflicting interests, and there is great strife, and then somehow, miraculusly, the interests become aligned, the badguys are defeated, and everyone is happy.  The only reason that we watch movies is so that we can see how our lives could be in a perfect world.  The problem is, the movies are not perfects worlds, there are still ""bad"" people.  Those people do not go away, becuase there are always sequals to movies.  The thing taht is different in life, is that we do not have to save the whole world by ourselves, we only have to save our smaller worlds, the larger the ""world"" that you save, the better you are.  If everyone were to work toegether, again, a movie setting, the entire world would be incorperated into the saving, and everyone would truly be better off.  This does not have to be wishful thinking, yet it is.  Again, all the cynical comments will be flowwing, but you know what, if we were to try to do this, even a little, again we would be better.  I feel like my ""seperate"" interests have become alive as one.  I feel like I'm living a movie.  I am loving every moment of it, I believe that this is truly what the holiday spirit is about.  I wish the past weeks would forever be repeated.

I am hoping to avenge my soccer pride by playing in the upcoming game that my parents will be playing in today, if I am lucky, I will be able to play as well.  That would be amazing, and even if I don't get to, mabey there will be an open field, and me and James will just mess around and it will be fun either way.

I am thinking of having a party on Wednesday, this will be a christmas oriented party, and I am planning on inviting like, everyone I know.  When I get around to telling people formally about this party, if I forgot you, I really did not mean to.  Just RSVP to me, I will post the details here as soon as I decide them.

As for the past week, it has been one of the happiest weeks of my life, and things are looking like they will only get better, which was the only thing that got me through the past week.  Break is an awesome time, and I hope to do stuff almost everyday.  Today was a fluke, I had to clean my house and that tired me out so I didn't really try to plan anything, I will do better.

Peace out

"event","Well, my long awaited and long anticipated Florida vacation has been resheduled due to my dad not being able to go.  He was offereing to stay home, but we decided to be together for the holidays, and that we will go to Florida during Spring Break.  This comes as a surprise, somewhat of a nice one, but also as a sadness.  Mostly I'm sad because now I won't have any tans to rub in peoples faces...  But also I now have a lot of free time that I do not know what to do with.  So... If you want to go hangout or do something, give me a shout, I am home for the holdays.

March and like the second half of November into the first half of December are like the most populated times for birthdays.  I do not know what that says about sex patterns... I will leave that to you, the reader, to figure out.  I think that it would suck to be born really close to christmas, cause then people who are really bad at getting one gift, like me, have to get two, and ya, it will make them all sad and thats not good.

Hey!  Two more days of school left, and today is going to ROCK!  Pe first, ya whatever, then we do something in english for like 5 minutes, and then start watching National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.  Then its off to Computer Science where we always do nothing, and hopefully I will get my stupid snake game to work.

Hey - I have to run now, to catch my bus, I may update again when I get home, depends on mood/how the day was.  Toots.

Oh well, my poetry days were finisheore they started, thats okay I wasn't planning on them.  Today was fun, my perpetual state of happiness cannot be quenched.  Heightened by my sugar, by my emotions, by my company, this week cannot get better.  How is that for a Monday?  If I got another day like this, I could die then.  Okay, I'm running out of fun discriptive things to say, so I will go back to the mundane.

School, boring as usual, and as usual punctuated with moments of hilarity, always a good time over all.

Chilling at home, always fun.  Cashing checks is even more fun though.  I have all of my Florida money ready, and I have decided that I will give presents to people when i get back, it will give me something to do.

Orchestra - Highlight of my day, (see top), and also I got my interview for my Europe trip, and I think that went well.  Got to see my rchestra peeps for the last time this year, with the exception of one.

"event","Well, friday was one of the better days of my life.  We went to Oceans 12, on what turned out to be opening day (lol).  It was pretty good, although I thought the ending was kinda lame, and I didn't really follow it that well.  Then afterwards, we went to Starbucks, where my famous nickname, Shankypants, refused to release its iron grasp.  Being recognized places is not bad in its self.  The bad part is the people that yell across stores, rooms, or just outside, ""SHANKYPANTS!""  This makes me want to go curl up in a corner somewhere, and not be there.

I love peppermint mochas.  They are the best, and if I knew how to use our espresso machine, I would make them everyday.  But I don't, so I don't.  Which, for those of you who know how gay and stupid I am when on caffeine, is probably a good thing.

Parents - Oblivious to their childrens real lives, they attempt and fail to realize what is actually going on in the mind of their kids.  When their kids want to make them think something, and they do think it, then they fail even worse, not only because now the kid has the power, but because they are still dead wrong.  Also, parents with anger problems suck.  The display to my CD-Player is broken because my dad threw it against the wall, and one of the keys on my oboe was bent.  Foruntatly it wasn't bent very far, so I was able to make it better, but things like this should not happen.  I mean, my room was ransacked when I got home Friday, my closet was emptied on my bed, everything that was on my floor was thrown on my bed, I felt like a thief had come into our house and gone through my things, yet it was just my dad, raging along.  I am really glad now that I did not stay home.  The movie not only was fun, but it allowed me to miss my dad's tirade.

Thanks everyone for uh, going to the movie?  And Allison, your ghetto friends are awesome,

One of them, who does not attend my school is much harder to talk to, and I cry when she does not sign in on aim.  It is oh so much fun to chat, and I don't know, its just something I look forward to.  There are people now, my clsoest friends, who I talk to on a regular basis, they are always there for me, and I appreciate that more than anything else, but the things that I want most, to just experience certain people's personalities, it must happen.  I will cry myself to sleep if I don not talk to some people.  It is really sad actually.  I do not know what I am going to do in Florida.  It will be very interesting to see how I manage.

On to other things, I did a bit of running today, and it was really sad.  I like, am not healing or something, and now my mom will not let me run till winter break.  I'm like, ""But thats 3 WEEKS!""

Psycho Analyziation - If I fail at being a computer game programmer, which is highly likely, I really do not have the smarts for that, I think I am going to be a psychiatrist.  Look at things from ther perspecitve, whether they help or not, they make shit loads of money talking to people convincing them of things that could not even be true.  They say random things, little nagging things that keep people coming back for more.  I have had a couple instances where I have messed with people's emotions and minds, and I almost killed myself for doing it, but it showed me that I have a talent for it.  I now need to work on putting that to a good outlet, and I believe that I can help people.  I definitly am going to read up on that, although I will still pursue the computer industry.  Think about that double major, psychiatry and computer sciece, that would be a wierd combo.  Berkeley is still my best bet though, god I love that school, they have everything, the only thing is getting in, damn being a white american with no distinguishing features.  I need to be some rare ethnic class, then I would be accepted anywhere.

Ya, and I have a fun eat down to look forward to tomorrow, if Carl remembers, which is highly unlikely, or I could buy him off with some white chocolate fudge.

Cold - It has come to my attention that people have different reactions to cold.  The ""normal"" people like myself, Zack, Adrian, Chris F, Scott, Whitney, Kyle, Kelsey, Candice, all the normal people, just wear long clothes to stay warm, and when it is like, 12 degrees outside we are freezing.  The crazy reptilian people, like James, Will, and Carl who decide that the way to become warmer is to wear less clothes.  There is also a special category of people, like Kelsey AND CANDICE, who make ""interesting"" noises to cure their coldness.  If anyone else has interesting things about being cold, go ahead and reply them (?) cause i find it amusing.

"event","Ya, so here we are again.  I dislike writing essays.  I also dislike tests involving paragraphs.  Kyle: The Dilling test was hella easy.  I don't know what your talking about, but I finished in like, 30 minutes.  I am really looking forward to not only this weekend, but the chance of snow, and also the holidays in general.  I really hope it does NOT snow during christmas, because I am going to be in Florida.  I think were going to Universal Studios, but mabey not.  The important part is, I am going to basking in the sun, and playing in the warm surf, while you suckers who stay home are going to be stuck in the dreary Seattle weather.  Ya, I actually am not going to be gone that long (try to contain your dissapointment) but, it will be an awesome vacation.

I am actually getting to go places and do things this year, first, beginning with the aforementioned vacation, then at Spring Break, the band is going to Disneyland.  This is one of the driving forces behind me being in band.  Then in the summer, I get to tour Eastern Europe for 15 days as part of my orchestra's European Tour.  We are performing in Berlin, and all these awesome, uber good places.  I think that next year, and the end of this year are going to be a blast.

Now, to the not so good, ya, well at the moment there isn't much that I can think of.  So, thats amazing, I am in a permenant good mood as of now, and I am loving every moment of it.  I think I am going to make some peppermint fudge, and for all of you that think its going to be bad, sucks for you, more for me.  Ya, and I am going to be making a bunch of it for my orchestra because I am a nice person, and ya, there should be a bunch left over.

I need to do some christmas shopping, I don't really know why I am putting this in here, but thats okay.  I have no secrets.  Seriously, if you took all the people that I confide in, and put their knowledge together, you could create a database that would know me better than I know myself.  That is really scary.  Anywho, I think that I am going to go shopping like, soon.  So, I need some ideas for what some people want, I obviously cannot buy for everyone, so if you actually read this, then speak up, you may be lucky.

I have now pretty much run out of ideas for what to talk about, so I may just ramble on about nothing for a while, I do that a lot.  I need to fix that actually, but its a really bad habit.  I can talk to you forever about nothing, but it will sound like something, until you actually think about it.  What is interesting is that since I do that, I can tell sometimes when other people are doing it.  Take the presidential debates for example, GeeDubya said a lot of nothing a lot of times.  It was really sad, because he would say variations of the same but of nothing to like, 5 questions in a row.  I was laughing on the inside, yet, crying also, because I knew that teh chances of him being elected were high.

Ya, so it would suck to live in Russia.  We are complaining, with good reason about our current elected official, but we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.  Russia for example is slipping, not very slowly back into a Czar-ship.  Their elected ""president"" has taken much power away from them, and has destroyed the checks and balances system that was put in place when the democracy was put into place.  I am actually concerned about the people there, and what this could mean for the world's stage.  I doubt that the White House knows anything about it, nor cares about the rest of the world, but we the educated, soon to be voting person's of America should know.  If any of you come across major world events, such as this, please tell me about them, I like to know what is happening in our world.  It makes my arguing contests so much easier (sarcasm).  Also, I think its really sad when people do not catch other people's sarcasm, especially when the people in question are good friends.

Well, you will have to wait till I eventually get around to writing here again to see about what I have experienced in my life.  Expect another installment at least by the end of Friday, cause I have a soccer game, and I will likely post the results of that, I do not know if I will post anymore before then though.

"event","Ya, Will Yost is my favorite person for today.  I made some fudge with my Ghiradelli's dark chocolate chips, which are on sale at Safeway by the way. Holy hell that stuff is good.  It's so rich that... ya, it's good.  It is also really easy to make.  Yum, Yum, YUM!.

So... today... the parade.  I have decided that doughnut stealing people should be shot, and I swear to god if anyone else takes a box of doughnuts from me, I will kill them.  Allow me to explain, we were marching along the parade rout, which was long, and I was sweating more than I have ever before in my life.  I was about to my limit, because there was no reward that I could see.  Then, this nice parade person, who was in the parade, who was also giving away free boxes of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.  You know, where there is like 10 boxes, and you are always the next person after they run out, well not today, I got a box of doughnuts.  I was overjoyed, I was dancing to the music, there was a spring in my step, and everything was going to be okay.  I had something to look forward to.  Then, horror of all horrors, the Sonics mascot goes over to me, takes the box of scrumptious doughnuts, from between me and my drum, and throws my hopes, my motivation, my reward, into the crowd.  I see it dissapear into the mob of spectators.  You should have seen my face, and you probably did not want to know what I said.  Fortunatley for him, I was marching, and the tv crews were moving the cameras onto my section at that time, otherwise, I would have rained down hellfire and death in the form of drumsticks and a 75 pound bass drum.  What I want to know is if they got that on tv, because if they did not pick up my vocal, I think that they would replay it a buch, and that would be totally worth it.  I would be famous!

So, afterward, we went to the best noodle place in the world, ZAO.  I had something called ""simply chicken"" which is like a Thai version of chicken noodle soup.  Let me tell you, it was amazing.  I ate till I was full, and was still absorbed in the goodness of the taste, and kept eating.  I left with the content over-fullness that you have after an excellent meal.  We then walked around in the brisk morning air, and it was cool.  I was all tired by then, and we went home.  Then I made fudge.

Now I am here, thinking about a certain someone who is hopefully having fun in Tacoma now, doing what I believe is called PRC.  I don't really know what that is, but she enjoys it, so it must be cool.  Ya, and I saw The Day After Tomorrow today, and it's a pretty good movie, its nice and cute with a happy, cliche ending.  But the pretense is frightenly possible.  Stuff that makes you think.  Yup, and if any of you have seen National Treasure, I want to know if it's a good movie, I have heard good things about it, and I think I'm gonna see it next weekend.  So, if you ruin the movie, you get no fudge.

"event","Ya, so as I'm writing this I have a migraine, and I almost threw up a few minutes ago.  Trust me, its not fun spending like, 5 minutes on your knees in front of the toilet, because I might throw up.  God I hate being sick.  Ya, I think I know why I got the migraine, and the reason is not public enough to put here, but I will say that some very stressful things happened last night, and I got through them, but I think I beat myself up at night or something because I woke up with a bruise in my wenis, and on my arm.  Ya, if anyone knows how to get rid of a sickness, please enlighten me.  My vision goes blurry every once in a while, and I can't see out of one side of my eye, I also have an ensanely bad headache.  I'm on the usual drugs, so dont suggest that.

We had a soccer game on Tuesday, we scored first, something that has never been done to the team we played.  We lost by a healthy margin, but that was not the point, not only did we score, but we held them to the smallest amount of points yet.  We nearly had about 4 other goals, but alas, Fabian is an amazing goal keeper.  We played the team sponsored by Sports World, and when I went into the store yesterday, the owner of the store, who watched our game, and who is like almost a family friend, told me that I should be playing on a select team.  I guess thats good, I dont really know what I'm gonna do come next soccer season.  I really need to get out and do some conditioning though.

Chelsea - I think we have made it through the worst, and the road to recovery is clear, can we please not let things go so long next time?  I think that what took place last night, talking to you, was why I got a migrain.  I really did not want to do what I did, but now, after doing it and getting some sleep, besides the migrain, I feel better.  We reached a new level of open-ness, and lets please try to keep it that way.

Turkey day - Well, I woke up, and went and played some soccer at Bear Creek Elementary School.  The field there sucks, but thats okay because this was just a fun time to mess around.  We had a bunch of people there, around 48.  It was awesome, beating what seems like hundreds of smaller children at soccer will never get boring.  Especially going around, through, but NOT over my brothers teacm mates, and then the adults, and scoring, there is something sweet about that accomplishment.  The feeling of scoring by yourself, and knowing that you have just instilled fear into the other team is greatly diminished by kicking the ground so hard that you can hardly walk.  I did this, so both feet, that is why I have practically vowed to never play on wet sand fields again.  I felt almost like I fractured my foot or something, but I think its okay now.  After two hours of soccer, we came home, via Safeway, and I got the ingredients for some delectible fudge.  If you saw our orange volkswagon bus driving around, you can take pride in knowing its driver (me).  Then we had an amazing dinner, turkey, mashed potatoes, the works.  Followed up with some fresh pumpkin pie, some blackberry pie, and there was mince pie, but I dont like that.  After that, we just sort of hung around our house and talked.  My migrain set in, and I because a recluse.

NOW - Interspursed with nausia, and times when I cannot see at all, I am doing pretty good, my nagging headache is really annoying, and the drugs I took for it are not working at all.  So, I am going to stop for now, I need to be better about updating here, because it makes me reflect on the days events, and thats a good thing.

Peace out

The mouse sort of has problems, but it is so comfortable, there is nothing better.  I was playing PSO for those of you that care, that game is interesting for a while, then gets boring, then interesting again.  Im on the second phase of interesting.

Past - I think that everything in my life is going better, communication is the key to succes.  I am really excited for the play to be over, it ends Saturday.  Which means that a certain someone will be able to have at least some free time Sunday, and Saturday in the daytime.  I got cool new orchestra music, and our next performance is in February, I'll get more details out when I get them.  Our indoor team lost our first game on Tuesday, it was really sad, I personally could have played better, I needed to get my shots on goal, there were 2 or 3 that should have been goals that I missed, barely missed, but still missed.  Next week in soccer, we are going to get destroyed, if we can hold the other team to less than a goal a minute, we will be doing good.

Today - School was its usual boring self, running in PE was interesting, trying to keep Whitney from running, by any means neccisary.  Also, in badminton, I had a pretty bad day, I was missing many easy shots, it was really sad.  I could have beat Stephan, but I missed many shots that were easy points.  Me and Carl really should have been better, but its okay... just PE.  Pickleball starts Monday, I'm pumped for a change, cause I have played Pickleball before, and I like it.

Soccer Practice - We spent the practice just scrimmaging till it got dark, it was fun.  Until I apparently cliped zack in the balls with my foot, during a tackle.  So, instead of just being a man and shrugging it off, he goes and punches me in the forehead.  I now (4 hours after) still have 2 swollen spots, and there is a cut on one of them.  Then, since mabey that was not enough pain, I went to block a goal kick, and I read it perfectly, except that it was dark, and I did not exactly know where it was going, so when i put my leg up to trap it, I miscalculated, and ended up with the ball squishing my right testical against my leg.  The pain was horrendous.  This is probably the 5th time that I have been hit in the crotch area in soccer practice.  This time it was accompanied with yells of, ""NO!  My babies!""  But, we won the scrimmage, so everything is going to be okay.

This post is a reminder that soccer practice will no longer be offically existing.  But, if anyone wants to continue, tell me, and I will see what I can find, mabey we can like, go to North Creek after school or something.

LAST SOCCER GAME OF THE YEAR - Opponent is the Knights, for those of you that don't know or don't remember, that is the team that tried to trip me after the game, and the coach accused my dad of teaching us to trip.  We are going to be amazing, come see us.  Pop Keeney Turf at 12:15 pm.  Kevin, Scott, and Tommy will not be playing, but we will play in your memory.

Well, after further thought, alliterations are stupid, so, I have decided to discontinue that idea.  If anyone knows any fun little things that I should put here, tell me.

Like, I had 3 friends, and so there were obviously many doubles, and thats not fun at all.  I wish I had friends... here is the latest one, and probably the last one that I am going to post

"event","Well I had this really poetic, flowing entry that pointed out how much better my nickname was than everyone else, then went on to talk about individuality and creativity and personal identity with respect to names.  It even had some cool rhyming senteces and stuff, it was cool.  But my god-forsaken computer decided that I shouldn't post it, so when I clicked on the post button, instead of posting, it crashed.

Apparently our soccer team won after I left, and Kyle got a bicycle kick goal.  That was my dream, and I missed my oportunity because of orchestra.  I have now decided that I suck and that our team doesnt need me, because we somehow win when im not there.  It makes me feel sad.  I think I'm going to go cry.

Orchestra was good, my solo was pretty good I think, the room was pretty good because I echoed, and it sounded a lot louder than it actually was, this is a good thing.  Some people like James who are my friends were there, and some people who arent my friends, like Candice, were to busy doing things than come see me be good at something.

I have now decided to make a little fun thing at the end of my posts, called the Alliteration of the Post (inventive aint it?).  Heres the first one, Wandering Wallabies Whacked Wild Windmills.  I may include names next time, so if your nice.. or mean... don't be surprised."

"event","This is the bestest song, and I think it applies to life as well... the lyrics are as follows...

Don't
Tell me what's in
Tell me how to write
Don't tell me how to win
This fight
Isn't your life
It isn't your right
To take the only thing that's
Mine

Proven over time
It's over your head
Don't try to read between the
Lines
Are clearly defined
Never lose sight of
Something you believe in

Takin' in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog

I've been trying to justify you
In the end I will just defy you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your man, Take me as I am

As I am

Still
Running uphill
Swimming against the current
I wish I weren't so
Fucked
Feels like I'm stuck
Lost in a sea of mediocrity

''Slow down,
You're thinking too much
Where is your soul?''
You cannot touch
The way I
Play
Or tell me what to say
You're in the way
Of all that I believe in

Takin' in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog
I've been wasting my breath on you
Open minds will descend upon you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am

I agree with everything here, and the song is amazing.  Like I said before, if anyone reading this has anymore Dream Theater albums, burn me a copy of them.  If you are Candice, then I'm already getting it, so ya, I'll try and get the cds sometime soon."

"event","Natalie - I took drivers ed like 8 months ago.  I am talking about the testing to get my liscense.

Irony of last night - I made fun of Candice's score on her drive test when I passed drivers ed with a final test score of 82, 1 point higher than hers.  Course, if anyone pointed that out to me, I wouldn't start wailing on them and attempting to beat them to a bloody pulp.  But, hey, we all have our own styles of handling people's comments.

I have found that everything is better when you talk about it in the morning.  People tend to think more clearly in the morning, and they are too tired to get really mad.  Also, I am addicted to breakfast foods.  I very often make myself omletes for like, lunch, dinner, and of course breakfast.  Ya, tat and toast, or many other breakfast foods, like waffles.  Today I made like, the best omlete I have ever had.  I had the perfect proportions of pepper, seasoning, and cheese.  And I even managed to flip it correctly.  Man, today is going to be a good day.

I have a dress rehearsal for my orchestra concert, which is on Sunday at 4, for all those of you that want to go, you know you do.  Then comes Carl's birthday party, some awesome Halo 2 action.  I still need to get him a present though.  Which will require me riding my damn bike to Woodinville (woo-town for all the gangstas reading) and its cold, and foggy, and I dont really want to do that.

Candice - Sally is awesome, the leather, its clean, beautiful.  One small thing though, how did you manage to get a mustang with such a small engine?  It went up the hill to my house like, slower than i can crawl up it.  (Please do not remove my balls) Just curious, not an insult, or having any negative connotation whatsoever.  And I dont want to know what you and James did in the car after I left...

If I was a cool person, and creative, and not stupid, then I would have some little ditty to put here, and I would think of a new one everyday, but I'm not so I wont, so therefore, tough it out."

"event","Well, it seems that a lot of things happened last night.  The problem is, I think most of them were blown far out of proportion, and after getting some sleep, and not thinking about it, I believe that things aren't really as bad as they seemed last night.  I cannot thank the people who were supporting me last night enough though, you know who you are.  But, I dont think that any cataclysmic things are going to happen, the world will not end, well, mabey it will, but it won't be because of anything I do.  And, ya, well, we had an amazing indoor game yesterday, we won like 17 (or so) to 3.  I say ""or so"" because they turned off the score board, I personally scored at least 4 goals, and got a few assists.  We just destroyed the other team, the score at half was 9-1.  They were playing like they still had a chance though, so we kept at it, just pounding them, over and over and over.  I think we probably should have stopped running up the score, but, hey what can I say?  It was fun, and in the words or Zack's sister, ""We kicked their ass.""

In other news today, I found a new band that I have become infatuated with, Dream Theater.  If you have any Dream Theater albums, beside ""Train of Thought"" I would like them.  I have listened to them like, non-stop for the last 3 or 4 days.  School yesterday was boring, and kind of depressing, just like all Wednesdays are.  That is until I actually realized that it was more like a Friday, that got me so excited, and it was a new day.  Unfortunatly, me and my friends weren't able to do anything yesterday, although I almost got to go over to Carl's house.  Cause his parents love me, but my parents hate me and I can't drive myself yet, so that made me mad.

Driving - I really wish I could drive myself places, there have been so many times that if only I could have done that, I would have been so much happier.  Speaking of cars, while walking to the Indoor Center, we saw two people in a car, and we were like, wonder what their ""doing.""  Then, wonder of all wonders, it just happened to be Scott and Whitney, apparently doing ""homework."" <-- draw your ownconclusions.  I think I'm going to take my drivers test for my liscense pretty soon, so that I can get my liscense as soon as I turn 16.  Which is March 28, for all people that care, and for those who don't.  Well, I am getting kinda bored now, and I don't really know what to do, tell me something to do, cause I really am bored.  And I can think of nothing to do."

Okay, so it's a couple wednesdays ago and after practice Mr. Pimlott says ""I know we aren't scheduled to have practice on friday but we should have one 6-8 on friday. I'm thinking, well okay that works, I have work that day, but I can get somebody to take my shift. So I go over to Pizza Hut afterwards and look to see who isn't working - Bethany Jacobson. Okay I think, I have to call her to ask her to take my Saturday shift too anyways. So I call her about five times. Terra - our manager - kicks me out because I'm tie-ing up their phone, so I copy the phone number and go home. The next day I call her 11 times, I'm a little more frantic now. I have nobody to work for me on Friday or Saturday, and she's the only person that can take my shift. On friday we're in our 3-5 rehersal and I'm calling her like 20times. Finally I have to go up to Mr. Pimlott, MR PIMLOTT and tell him THAAT I CANT COME TO REHERSAL AHHHH WE HAVE FOUR DAYS LEFT UNTIL PREVIEWS AND I'M SKIPPING A REHERSAL??? He takes it very well and tells me that it was short notice, his fault, and told me not to worry about it....... I still feel horrible. So I'm pissed. Royaly pissed. And I still am working Saturday, and I have to till close tonight, so I won't be able to shopping for tomorrow's Hallooween party. So I find some time inbetween 9-2pm rehersal and 4-8 work and 8- whenever party to make pickle wraps, buy a constume on the day of hallooween, and everything else I need for the party AHHHHHH!!!             Yeah so I felt like quitting my job that day.

I feel like quitting choir because Miller is now Zemlin and Zemlin has always been Zemlin AND I CAN'T STAND TWO PEOPLE SAYING ""Side comments are the devil!"" and ""Fun is not goofing in choir and laughing, it's about making good music, not haveing fun. fun is making good music."" Yes making good music is fun, but all work and no play make concert choir go crazy or anybody else. Miller is an insesitve prick, who I want to tell off more that anything, watch him squirm, give him a good reason why he should not have messed with me.

Does this make me a quiter? I honestly don't know. I can't tell if it's just me being a bitch or the rest of the world.... I'm confused"

"event","While wiping up blood (bloody nose) and tears from the basement bathroom floor, I think on my father's words: ""You are this close to getting kicked out of the house."" I can't control my thoughts, my tears, or my blood. What did i do? I recall the last ten minutes looking for an answer. 
I walked in the door. My father comments on how i got the job at pizza hut, and then he goes on to basically tell me that the only reason why i got the job was becuase i knew everyone there. I said thanks for the compliment. He told me ""It wasn't an insult you...."" I went downstairs to play Daiblo. Sweet loving diablo. Where i can kill as many creatures as i want. Take out my anger. My dad comes downstairs and starts yelling at me about something. family and talking or something. He asks me if I want two people in the house (mp parents) or three (my parents and i). I wanted to scream 2. scream 2 until i was blue in the face and he was red. but i reluctantly said 3. I wanted to scream 2, and my thoughts about him. Everything he thought he is is nothing to me as i am to him. 
I stay in this prison of a bathroom. I go my upstairs bathroom. On the way i dribble blood on the hard wood floors. I'll clean it up later. I head to my bathroom, my mother doesn't accknowlegde my existence, meaning she's in on this too. I throw her a dirty look. I head to me bathroom. The only place that doesn't gave the stench of my father. 
So he wants to talk things out? Fine. But not to his face. In this journal. No, not  to his face for fear of abuse. 
I sit in the bathtub that soon starts to fill with the same bloody tears. I look around me and i see my razor. Ha, I laugh, I sound like Juliet ""oh happy dagger"". Yes i am juliet, but with a different source of emotions. Her's stems from undying love, mine stems from pure hatrid. Black sticky hatred. 
I recall time after time when of faults on his part. And now he wants ME to be ""part of the family"". Fuck him. What kind of father tells his duaghter to call someone else when she is sitting at school with a broken arm. I reasoned that he should come because he's two mins away while my mother is 15. He tells me call my mother anyhow. Call someone else because i am too busy at work. Call someone esle becuase i might get queasy. What kind of FUCKING father is that? 
I look at myself in the mirror and a red-eyed, blood-stained me. I see my weakness. I see the weak woman i have become. I i see the unaccomplished, ugly me that has no business having such good friends. And I see my faithful razor. Oh to end my life now would be a sweet rose. To not have to endure people that hurt me, like my father. To be free, free to be silent. How many times I've thought of it. jump off the boat..drive off the road...take too many pills. Yes, I've thought of it. Too much to confess to any psychaitrist.

I AM DEAF TO YOUR'S OR ANY OTHER PERSON'S LOVE."

Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl<br>(Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum<br>(Egyptian).
The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life,<br>the number 0, and the element of fire.
His sign is the eclipsed sun.

So, I was talking with Tyler Peterson, John Coe, and Vink during second hour. Wow. Remind me to NEVER do that again. 

We talked about all sorts of things. Like them doing pot (not Vink) and how it wasn't bad for your health and that they were going to make me and Vink get high with them. 

Then we talked about how I'm going to grow up to be a dominatrix and that I have a lot of pent up sexual anxiety because I'm ""smart"". Also, did you know that Vink likes lesbian porn, but Tyler and John don't? Well now you do, ha ha ha! 

We also talked about how some men liked to get kicked in the balls right before their sexual peak. Especially if it was an asian in high heals... 

We also talked about Tyler going to a sleep over and his ""friends"" hog-tying him (leaving him in a provacative position) and (if I got the motion right) grabbing Tyler's balls and twisting. Ow. 

Then the most frightening part of this conversation came, when Tyler and John ganged up on me, and kept telling people (LIKE MILLER!!) that me and Vink should go out!!!! AHHHHHH!!!! ..... I diverted this, coolly by telling them about Nicole (I'm sorry Nicole), then they started to ask about who Nicole was and they found out that the two of them talk a lot (I'm sorry Nicole). So they left me alone for 5 mins.

Talkative, which seemed impossible. When we got oon the plane we all slept most of the way, very uncomftorably so. Liz say an alligator because the plane was really close to the ground (we were about to touch down). She started freaking out she was so excited.

After that it was a 3hr drive home. blech. there was six of us in a car. We stopped at a hick-ish restaurant on the way home, and it made me laugh, 5 out of the 6 of us had chilli, the other had stew. 

When we got home, Liz and I slept for a couple hrs and woke up to a nice dinner. 

Well good night all.

Dear Erica,
  As you know by now, we haven't talked for a while, and frankly I blame myself (bs). It's true, it's my fault, I truely feel bad for what I have done (what you've done?). I think it is time to move. Hopefully you've done so already (???). What can you do? People change (like me?) - it wasn't meant to be (THIS IS THE SOUND OF MY HEART BREAKING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OUCH!!!!!). I know we don't talk as much as much so I'm guessing you don't feel the same as you used to (FUCK FUCK FUCK MY HEART TO LITTLE PIECES!!!!!) I always had fun with you, this much is true. (ryhming now are we?) I just feel that there's nothing left to do (.........wahhhhh......bastard....). Please don't hate me for this choice (of course not your only the LOVE OF MY LIFE.........) I just think we would be better without having to worry about one another. (cryyyyyyyyyyy!! what??..... bastard....) I'm really sorry for this choice that I have come to.  I hope you will still give me a chance to be your friend and still be able to talk. (HA HA HA, if you stop running away, every time I enter the room......... bastard....)

Your friend,
Mikey"

Finally today Anna Brovold comes up to me with a note. Looked like girls handwriting, so I figured it was one of the pissed off girls who hate me cause I'm dating Mikey. Westgard is doing his make-up next to me and he nods his head, then I realize it's not from a girl, but from Mikey. We talk about what might be in the letter, he knew, I knew, so I opened it. And the first thing I see is ""your friend, Mikey"". I close the letter, because ya know, it's kinda private. I nod my head and go off to read it.

"event","Okay, I went to my Uncle's second wedding. He married Laura, a wicka practicer, and government spy, who just happens to be a nyphomaniac. yeah. I get there and I meet Laura and her family, not too bad, actually, pretty nice people. So I go swimming all day. Then at night, we have the rehersal dinner. We get on a shuttle bus (oh by the way this is in South Carolina) and head for oldfield. This done-up place that looks like it was built 200 years ago. And it's a golf course and such. So we go to the dinner place, where everything that we eat is basically seafood. I don't like seafood, but whatever. Then we go walking about, where we spot the ever present tree-climbing-frogs. Then we go on a pontoon boat ride where we meet up with a dolphin!!! Cool, eh?!!? He was eating the oysters. 
<br />
Wedding day:
<br />
I wake up and I get ready for the wedding. Me and my mom go down to the wedding together and we open it up. There, the first thing that I see is a whole bunch of selections of Handel. I think to myself, classy woman. Then I look down, and I see that they are saying Cherokee prayers and Apache blessings. Interesting.......
<br />
Reception: (this is where it gets fuuun.....)
<br />
So following the wedding we went to the ""grassy knoll"". Let the drinking begin!! Well not for us kidlets of course but yes. So for the bride and grooms, the song is 'bailamos' by Enrique Eglasious. Me and my baby (9th grader, but he's still my baby cousin) cousin couldn't help but laugh. The music just got worse. So, the dancing, drinking, and seafood went on for quite a bit, untill i met Meeca (39 years old i believe), a man I wish not to meet again. He has big hands. And guys with big hands, when they put their arm around your waist, well lets just say that his hand reaches up preeeetty far. He was like hitting on me all night, and then I got to meet his wife!! He was determined to dance with me, until his wife had to haul him up to his hotel room. Wait... before he left, he told my baby cousin how to Cha-Cha, and how to get laid, and then my cousin's response was something along the lines of, i already know how to. AHHHHH!!!!!!! Then there was the wedding photographer who told me every five seconds that I would be ""drop dead gorgeous"" in 4-6 years. HA HA HA HA HA!!!! MIKEY WHERE ARE YOU WHEN I NEED YOU!?!?!??!?!?!

"event","Today I got up at 1:00 pm. Mmmm. That felt good. Then I went to work with Michelle, decided that we didn't need to be there, and then went to Dan's house. After we supped. He got a harp. YAY!!! Of course we played Mario Kart and Magic.

Along the course of the day we went to my house. I saw that Poopmaster5000 was on and was about to yell at him when I had a revelation. Maybe it's his brother. I asked if it was and it was. ( It could be that it was stealthily Aaron). But anyway, I talked to him and Mindy you're right, he is adorable! Mindy I want you to date him now! NOW!

Then we went to LXG. Great movie. Sucky ending. But GREAT MOVIE! Yay, two thumbs up! It was a fun movie!

And now I am at Michelle's house (surprise, surprise) and I'm writing this, so I guess I don't have anything else to write except for ""Go to bed, you need your rest!""

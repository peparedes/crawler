"event","Yesturday at Premios Juventud I was able to only work as ""Talent Escort"" (guiding lost celebrities), but as press ( i got ask alot of questions!!!) allowing me to see pretty much everyone at the awards....
My first celebrity was cute Shelbie Bruce from Spanglish with Adam Sandler<img src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y263/brenda_style/pa_show_fonsi_2.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com""> I also saw, yes yet again, Luis Fonsi. I walked him to the stage. He was super nice as usual.
I also escorted Carlos Arroyo (Basketball, NBA, Puerto Rican), he was super nice, he even put his arm around me:)
Also, Christian De LA Fuente (Hot soap opera star)
Out of all the people saw the ones that impacted me and therefore remember are:
RBD!!!!! I have a brilliant anecdote which I'll tell you at the end
<img src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y263/brenda_style/pa_show_rbd_2.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
Chayanne- gorgeous
DADDY YANKEE- super ""humilde""- del barrio de PR
Enrique Iglesias- not bad in person, super nice
Laura Pausini
Olga Tanon
Frankie J
Barbara Bermudos - Primer Impacto
Jaguares- mexican rolling stones
Wisin y Yandel -reggeaton
Lunny Tunes- reggeaton
Las Senadoras- i actually escorted them to the bathroom and then to the stage <img src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y263/brenda_style/pa_senadoras.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
Ivy Queen- reggeaton
Anais- Spanish American Idol- ""the latin Beyonce""
Obie Bermudez- linda stuck up although Puerto Rican
Sissy - from Sabado Gigante I actually helped her with her cellphone
Christian Castro- stuck up, ugly, gay, but has a good voice
Miss PR- super pretty well-deserved 2nd runner up position at Miss Universe
La 5ta Estacion- GREAT GROUP, I LOVE THEIR CD!!
And I'm pretty sure I forgot a few artists that I also liked...


Ok now for the highlight of my evening.... As press Sylvi and I sat in the first row with Gigi in the back (next to the Univision camera).. Alot of artists were nice enough to give a shout out to the University of Miami at our resquest like Jaguares, Barbara Bermudo, ANNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

RBD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OK Sylvi asks them to give a shout out to the University of Miami and as Christopher was about to do it I shout to them that it was towards the only woman camera person, Chris gives his shout out and then PONCHO (yes my Poncho) gives a special shout to Gigi in the back!!!! It was super cool he heard him.
NOW, when I was walking back stage to get my stuff and go home I run into PONCHO and I thank him for his comment on Gigi and he was super nice and started talking to me, showing me his award (which he had in his hand), he asked of what were the cool places to party in Miami ( i said Mansion b/c i know that's were the famous people go), and then out of NOWHERE he leans in and gives a KISSSSSSSSSS HUGGGGGGGGGG. I almost died!!! He was soo great!!! Seriously this is my new ""Luis Fonsi""....

I can understand that he desperately wants children and that he may have fallen for angelina, but couldn't have at least waited til the divorce was final with Jen?? I find it very hard to believe on how someone can move on so rapidly like the previous relationship ment nothing to him. I mean seriously poor Jen. And I don't think its Angelina's fault either, its all on Brad. 

I'm probably overreacting, but the situation looks very disturbing to me.  I wouldn't do that."

All the people that know me know that I could be anywhere in the world and Luis Fonsi will form part of my life. I have heard him on the radio like 3 times already since I've been here in Ecuador and he's not even popular here. Really. And I not only hear is music everywhere, I see him everywhere too. He must think I'm some sort of stalker but I'm not...  But don't we make the cutuest couple :) You be the judge...

I would watch it everyday on TNT syndication. Many of you may think why in the hell I would like this show so much, but I did, I thought it was greatness.  And I was in love with Dean Cain. I even got to meet him when he came to film a movie in PR called ""Flight of Fancy"". He was so nice and HOT!! Well, anyway, naturally I got super excited when they released the first season on DVD.  I bought it as soon as I could and now I can't stop watching it.

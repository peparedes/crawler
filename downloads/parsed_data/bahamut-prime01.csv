"event","Been a while since I last updated my Livejournal account. After six glorious years, it was time for a change. And that change involved upgrading to a new computer, since our old one was having issues. So with the help of my cousin, he was able to get a computer specialist (names Matt) to build a custom LG computer, with more space, running speed, and pre-installed programs like GIMP 2 (a Photoshop-eske program), Itunes, the game Portal 2 (which I should get round to playing, and the usual Firefox and Internet Explorer. Good thing I kept a back up of important files, and still had some programs like Microsoft Windows. So goodbye to old rubbishy junk programs that have been slowing me down, and hello to a new life (hopefully without encountering any new crap online)! I managed to get rid of my old computer along with our old accounts with Matt's help.

A month ago, I had to have a dental operation to remove four of my wisdom teeth while under anaesthesia, so I was off work, in which I've recovered. Besides another month of rinsing my mouth with salt water (now that my teeth don't seem to hurt as much) and that I've recently returned to work, it turns out it's my mother's turn for an operation - this time involving women's problem (something called hysterectomy). All I know is that afterwards, she's off work for about six weeks, so my sister and I have to look after her while she recovers afterwards. It may not be easy, but nevertheless, hope the operation goes smoothly, and godspeed to a full recovery too. For looking after us, it's our turn to look after you! :salute:

I also recently saw a couple of films, many good (even though the first one I saw after The Muppets regrettably made me fall asleep in one part of it). For a bit of mystery, there's the sequel to Robert Downey Jr.'s hit, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. It was so good to hear the inner detective dialogue again, especially since he's facing Professor Moriarty this time! But one of the moments I enjoyed was that Stephen Fry was in it too! :D The second film I watched was more of an eye-opener for me. If you like Liam Neeson and survival films, then I think The Grey would be your choice! Quite the thriller, with Neeson playing a hired guard to a group of oil diggers when stranded after a plane crash in the icy wilderness will also having to deal with a ravenous pack of wolves! Quite the thrilling story, sad in some moments, but nevertheless, I quite enjoyed it more! :)

Finally, over a week until next Wednesday until my 25th birthday! My how time flies - I just wonder how it'll turn out. All I know is that my sister and my mother are in the process of ordering tickets to Cirque du Soleil - Ovo, which will be showing in mid-July! It may take a while, but better that our family is well - no good going out when Mum's in the midst of recovery. But I'm sure it'll be worth it, and I'd best make a origami special on Deviantart as well! :)

Well, I'd better get to bed so I can provide transport for mother tomorrow to the hospital (already done, original journal at Deviantart was updated a few days ago). But before that, I'd just had my spirits lifted greatly due to the The Umbilical Brothers: Don't Explain on TV before! Who woulda though mimicry and sound effects by an Australian comedy duo would be worth such great laughs - especially seeing them on the Comedy Festival on TV! I highly recommend watching them!"

"event","Obviously, due to the time of the Queensland floods, it didn't seem like quite a good idea to update what happened, even my New Year's Resolutions. With the recovery in process, now would probably be a good time to update on what I have been doing recently (even though we seem to be facing a lot of disasters lately, Cyclone Yasi, Earthquake in Churchhill, New Zealand. Not what the world needs at this very moment.) :boo:

Firstly, I saw my first movie for this year - The Green Hornet! While not the best adaption, it's still a decent film - especially the Black Beauty vehicle, the weapons, and also Taiwanese singer Jay Chou in action! Of course, just because it's adapted from the radio program, TV series, etc, you can't always have everything in it! :nod:

Other than a Nerf War in a park some weeks before and weekly gym/yoga attendance, one of my Aunts took my family to the towns of Maleny and Montville, where we had delicious ice-cream and cheeses in the former, and chocolates and a picnic at the latter! In the same day, in the afternoon, she also took us to see the AusSounds Australia Day Concert at South Bank for free, which is aimed to give musical relief to those affected by the floods! Performing at the concert were the likes of Charlie Mayfair, Ball Park Music, and best of all, Guy Sebastian! It was really quite the performance - especially since music is one of many things that's needed in the grim times! :)

Another spectacular show I'd recommend you see is also WICKED! Remember the Origami tribute I made on January 31st? http://blackvegetable.deviantart.com/art/Defying-Gravity-195611125 Well this is the glorious Broadway musical I saw, which I folded a tribute to, and ONE OF THE VERY BEST I HAVE SEEN! :boogie: It has become one of my favourites since The Phantom of the Opera and Avenue Q! All I can tell you is this, quoting by tagline, <i>The Untold Story of The Witches of Oz!</i> I won't spoil it for you, you may have to see it for yourself! <b>I highly recommend it!</b>

Now for something I should have submitted a while ago: My New Year's Resolutions! 

1. Finding a proper job for myself (and succeeding!). 

2. Save enough cash for whatever's neccessary (car servicing) and at times some recreational events (eg. first time at cosplay)

3. Try and be nicer to the people around me, especially family (even though at times they can be an annoyance).

4. Get things done on time. 

5. Eat proper foods more often (i.e, more fruit and veg.)

6. Exercise! 

7. Properly search for information and images for anything neccessary, without unwittingly encountering any explicit stuff (What the hell is with Hentai/porn!? Stupid images trapped in the corners of my mind) :puke:

Once more thing to announce - it's hard to believe that it feels like yesterday since 2011 started. Not only that... it's only seven more days UNTIL MY 24TH BIRTHDAY! And since this year is the Chinese Year of the Rabbit, this calls for a special on Deviantart! I wonder what will happen on my Birthday once again? I hope it'll be worth the enjoyment! 

Well, I better get back to watching Good News Week, and later on, prepare for bedtime! Enjoy yourselves - I hope 2011 gets better! :D"

"event","2010... for me it's been quite a hectic year. Mainly considering of many misfortunes like crashing my car for the first time (plus servicing), my computer graphics card having to be replaced as a result of the tower not being cleaned or serviced during the four years of my family's ownership - with the result of having to work without certain programs (eg, relying on a trail version of Microsoft Word for work and fanfiction related matters, utilising Photoshop online with limited option, what a plaver) . Plus the fact I have yet to get a proper job even with my newly acquired Certificate III of Hospitality (what a tough market). YEASH!

But on the plus side - this year I've completed the said Certificate, tried some cool recipes from excellent TV Chefs, and seen some good movies like Despicable Me for example. Still, I'm hoping 2011 would less expensive and merciless so would be less inclined to causing me and my family stress. Especially when Mum get... rather agro when it comes to some expenses.

Now for the main topic: since it's about a week until Christmas (original journal entry was about Dec 11th), I might as well get my Christmas wishlist up. Let's see what I shall type (first three would be PC/net-related)...

1. Reviews on the following fanfics: Heroes of Cybertron and Planet Earth (Transformers Armada) [link] , and White Reflection (Digimon Adventure 02) [link] - Yes, I know it's been a while since I last updated the former since it was a two-year hiatus. If appreciated (since I recently updated in November) please read and review since I haven't received any new reviews lately. Right now I'm working on my latest Digimon chapter.

2. (On Deviantart) Perhaps some clean artwork of my choice, eg: based from my fanfics, or any favourite media I enjoy.

3. A new Adobe Photoshop... while I appreciate the Photoshop Online, I'm limited in some options after the full clean-up to the PC tower. :(

4. Perhaps some books, and some PS3/DS games - e.g., BlazBlue: Continuum Shift, Another Century's Episode: R, Transformers War for Cybertron: Autobots/Decepticons, any Sonic games (gotten into them recently), and a PS Move Starter set. :hmm:

5. Maybe some Zoid model kits (it's rather rare finding them in Australia these days).

6. Gift vouchers that I can put to good use, just in case.

7. Any Nerf N-Strike Weapons. :D

Well, I better be off. I still got some items to upload, and especially seeing how I go at a Nigella Lawson Christmas ham recipe this year! I hope everybody enjoy Christmas 2010 grandly! :D"

"event","March 23rd. The day Kurosawa Akira was born. The day I had my very first car accident today.

Yes. You heard me. My very first car accident. 

How did it happen, you might ask? It all started when I was on my way to the Chermside library to drop off some books. On the way, I attempted to try to overtake a semi-trailer truck along the three-laned Gympie Road in an attempt to try to turn right at an intersection. While I indicated alright, I wound up overtaking too early and as a result, the right rear side of my Suzuki Swift got clipped by the truck and wound up in a spin. Facing backwards on a pedestrian traffic island. Thankfully, no-one was hurt, including me and the truck driver. 

But still, as the title says, this is one of the my humilliating and stupid things I've ever done! Though I stayed calm during the ordeal and behaved well when the police interviewed me and that the truck wasn't damaged, I was lucky enough not to hit someone lest I wound up with a court case on my hands! I had no other choice but to pay $300 bucks to the Transport Department, received three demerit points, and plus because of my age and the fact haven't held my license for two years my family had to pay quite a hefty amount for insurance!  Though hopefully the insurance should cover up some repairs, but looks like Friday's servicing would be cancelled and I have to take the bus and train to TAFE as a result! And so poor Newsagency (that was the name of the Suzuki the original owner called it) is now at the body shop for repairs, but other than that, no major damage. 

But on the plus side - the truckie was a nice enough guy, so he provided me with the name of the boss he works and the truck belongs to and the number, while exchanging details. A witness was also kind enough to assist me and to take me home as well - just now I wrote a thank you message to him and with the help from my family added a Coles/Myer gift voucher card. And so now, I've made a new friend! 

But nevertheless, that left a new experience for me. And it's safe to say, that even though I passed my driving test last year, I'm still capable of mistakes. I'm not the only one though - last year because of a stupid yapping dog from next door my sister accidentally crashed her car through the wall! All I have to do, is to be a much more careful driver from now on - and hopefully I wouldn't have another accident before obtaining my Green P plate licence. 

I shall end this journal with this (though I think I might have gotten the last part from somewhere); a man can fight for love, honour, possessions, peace, justice, and riches - but I think a man's greatest battle would have to be to keep on living."

"event","Over a week has passed since my birthday, and already there's still more events to do until April starts! Of course, there are some things I would like to mention. 

After stuffing ourselves full with a steak lunch at the Breakfast Creek Hotel and seeing a fabulous Tim Burton adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, there's still some fun events planned to go, along with some I've done so far. So far, I was able to obtain the Collector's Edition of Final Fantasy XIII, and it looks to be promising so far!  Only to face the sucky fact I had to hunt through nearly every store to find the Collector's Game Guide!  Call me paranoid, but there are moments I find certain stuff to match well with each other. But luckily for me, I'm picking up the guide tomorrow as one was secured for me!  

For this year's birthday I have received many presents, not vast, but satisfiable. I received $60 from my aunt, a keychain light from a friend of my sister's (who interestingly enough has the same birthday as myself, see last entry), a $50 JB-Hifi Gift Voucher from one of my uncles, and three tickets to see Irish comedian David O'Doherty on this Wednesday!  And so, my sister and my mother will be accompanying me on that night! 

Speaking of tickets, I managed to also obtain tickets for myself. One, of a 28th March 5:00pm session to the comedy hit Avenue Q (which my sister's already seen), and a weekend pass for the Supernova Pop Culture Festival on 10-11 April! Considering I haven't had much luck in finding a good cosplay book or a beginner's guide to costume or sewing, I figured this would be an effort to try to learn something so I can one day have a go as a cosplayer. If I do manage to obtain information or tips (maybe some lessons would help) that would help me, I hope to cosplay as any character that suits my build well. 

And considering that April (which includes Easter) is coming, I better have a special planned indeed on Deviantart! There's still some Gundam model kits I have yet to complete so better get cracking, along with my Transformers fanfic (on Fanfiction dot net) before the end of May! 

Well, I better prepare for bed. Nighty night all, and see you next time with a new entry or anything of the related!"

"event","Okie day, where to start, considering it's been a long time since I last updated? I guess I better go with the current details. We had a fabulous Chinese New Year as usual, cash is given out to many of us, and we had a splendid party and Grandfather's place! Of course, as with most parties, there was quite an abundance of food, but at least there were some relatives worth talking to at times as well! But just in case, here's some of the details I have to mention.

First off, I was spared from the low pay at Endeavour Foundation - by receiving a call that a class for Certificate III Hospitality had arrived! And so, starting from Feb 8th, I have returned to recommence my education, considering in the last few months I had yet to regain a proper job. Other than that, it was good to be back to recommencing my studies again, even though so far in the early weeks it's a revision of Cert II at first, but the Cert III subjects are coming later on.

I also forgot to mention that now I've got my very own car! A silver 2007 (or is it 2008) Suzuki Swift, which used to belong to a friend of my sister's until she returned to America because her Visa expired, in which she kindly sold me the car. Though mother helped me buy it, I have full access so now I'm able to travel nearly anywhere and working night shift!

Finally, all I can say is this - in a night's time I'm no longer 22, I'm turning 23 on Sunday! Time really does fly, though there are moments I wonder - as one grows older, you wind up receiving less presents. But nevertheless, today's going to be interesting since Mum's not working (as it's her day off), as we just came back from Breakfast Creek Hotel after a big lunch. Of course I might have to lessen on the alcohol from now on as must have drank a glass of Bailey's on the Rocks a little bit too fast, hence I feel asleep on the way home and my current mood. Later on tonight, another friend is taking sis and I to see the 2010 film adaption Alice in Wonderland! An interesting note by the way, she's also got the same birthday as myself though we're of different ages - astounding, isn't it? Nevertheless, what presents would I want for this year? Would it be vouchers, music, DVDs, model kits, artwork of my request, and/or perhaps an extension on my Deviantart Subscription, etc? All of these wound sound just about good right now or on the day, which is 7th of March.

As for gifts so far, I received $60 Aussie dollars from my aunt, and three tickets to see Irish comedian David O'Doherty on next Wednesday! :D

I have a feeling the rest of today is going to be good! So see you laters! :)"

"event","God I need to keep up with time management. Over a year it's been since I updated my fics, and I couldn't help but wonder if I could get off my arse. Anyways, I have tons to talk about. 

Firstly, like I mentioned in the previous journal, I went with my mother to Hong Kong for a bit of relative visiting and shopping, after an eight hour flight. It was also Mum's first time back since thirty long years. Of course, I couldn't help but be excited on embarking on the model kit hunt of mine, though I was only allowed one. With the help of fellow aunt Katherine (one of the few who can speak English since she lives in Australia as well) I was able to obtain my very first Master Grade Gundam kit, known as the ZGMF-X42S DESTINY GUNDAM EXTREME BLAST MODE! There was also another store, Bandai focused, on the top floor which is filled with lots of Gundam merchandise, and to my surprise, Mum even allowed me to get another model kit, which this time I picked the 1/100 AKATSUKI GUNDAM OOWASHI PACK/SHIRANUI PACK FULL SET! :w00t:

Later on, the reason why we went over to South Korea was the fact that one of our aunts found a discount special on some cosmetics, and some she intended to get some for herself and the relatives. So we travelled four hours from midnight to South Korea, where it's flippin' cold (not snowy cold), to a point where one constantly has to go to the toilet! ^^; It was a guided tour, which is good, 'cept the sucky thing was that since the communication was in Cantonese, it wasn't easy to understand. Nevertheless, we had fun, like going to a Disneyland-esqe funpark called Everland, explored ancient temples, shopping and more! Plus eating those cute little custard cakes that were cooked in a special vendor (whatever they were, I forgot the name)! I was even interested in some video clips shown in Korea with K-pop bands like Big Bang and Girls' Generation! The currency is slightly cheaper there! 

After coming back and travelling to see more relatives in Macau, Canton, Macau and back to Hong Kong for a final night, I was disappointed that there wasn't much Zoids merchandise in those places, so I assume the popularity must have declined over there. :doh: But on the plus side, it was also good to enjoy various foods like seafood, fried frogs' legs and fried spiced sea snake in Canton, and the signature Egg Tarts from Lord Stow's Bakery in Macau! :omfg:

Sadly, all good things must come to an end, and so we headed on another eight hour flight home. But all I could say is this - the trip was worthwhile. :meditation: 

Besides my sister's 24th Birthday, my additional twelve months' Deviantart Subscription, watching TFA (last season seemed end too soon) along with my entrance to a Cert. II Hospitality course via Help Enterprises, I am extremely proud to say that I finally got my L1 DRIVER'S LICENCE! BOOYA! And so we ate at a Mexican restaurant to celebrate (even though the food was decent, eg. Mum's watery cappacino and I couldn't see the beef Enchilada under the pile of tomato and cheese, though the Ice Cream with Kahlua was good). 

Finally, there's two robot movies I intend on seeing - one is Terminator Salvation, and two, which I am excited to go see is TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN! And also since it's twenty-five years since Transformers came to our lives, expect a special up soon (though I better update my fanfics too)! 

Well, I better get off to bed. Enjoy yourselves out there! :D"

"event","Let's see if I can save some exciting bits of news for last...

Firstly - directly a day or so after my last entry, I went with two of my high school buddies, William and Matthew to see the movie 'Journey to the Center of the Earth in 3-D'. Not the best movie, but good that not only there's prehistoric creatures and all, but also a rare film that utilises 3-D glasses to watch for the entire duration of the film! It's still enjoyable at least, though I was hoping for more prehistoric animals in it.

Besides that, about three Sundays back, one of the biggest storms hit Queensland, my house included! So from about 5pm to 2am the next day, my suburb got a blackout, and that parts of the roof leaked unfortunately! All I can do is pray that insurance and some good repairs would help. Unfortunately, suburbs like The Gap were the worst hit! Here's hoping they get the good help they need too.

As I was still doing some drawings, expect a bump for the process, as somehow, my printer/scanner combo decided to break down! Until a new printer/scanner can be obtained, I might have to use the digital camera for my drawings... much to annoyance.

But nothing can be more exciting than what I experienced last night! Last night, I went with my mother, two aunts, two cousins, and two of her friends to see CIRQUE DU SOLEIL: DRALION! An awesome and spectacular fusion of circus performers (without the animals though), gymnastics, exotic eastern and western majesty, dance, death-defying acts, and comical slapstick interludes, IT WAS TRULY ONE GRAND SHOW NOT TO MISS! After seeing some Cirque du Soleil shows on TV, for the first time, it was quite a magnificent work of worthiness seeing it live! How amazing was that? 10 out of 10 from myself! That reminds me, I better finish watching Kaleido Star myself, since Cirque du Soleil was the reason why I obtained it!

Finally, since it's Christmas coming again, I better make up my wishlist!

1. The Way of the Warrior: Martial Arts and Fighting Styles from Around the World by Chris Crudelli.

2. Age of Mythology Collector's or Gold Edition.

3. Iron Man Blu-Ray 2 Disc Edition DVD.

4. Any good anime/manga How to Draw Books, and perhaps some origami as well.

5. A PS3, with some games like Soul Calibur IV, Dynasty Warriors: Gundam, Guitar Hero, etc.

6. DS Games - Transformers Animated: The Game, Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship 2008, What's Cooking with Jamie Oliver, etc.

7. A Deviantart subscription.

I think for now, that'll be it. In the meantime once again, hope Christmas is without too much stress, and is worth enjoying for all!"

"event","What is there to talk about? That, I better write down.

Firstly, once again, I attended another wedding, this time involving one of my cousins, Carmen, who was married to her groom, Jimmy. Normally, I like weddings, except for a few things that irked me a bit, especially at the reception at the Landmark restaurant at Sunnybank.

One of the few examples involved the food. We were waiting for nearly an hour and the food finally arrived! It wasn't prepared until it arrived the tables, and most of the menu consisted of seafood, and I was worried since Aunt Suelyn's allergic to it. The families could have at least organised it better along with considering of the guests' well being. Another few negative factors came in form of the spelling mistakes, music choice, and whoever was speaking on stage chose the wrong words. But at least my mother, my sister, and myself didn't stay for too long for they had to attend for work the following day.

Considering of the Street's Magnum ice-cream promotion at the moment, I treated Mum to Gold Class to see the movie, WALL-E for the first time! As Mum had scones, and I had the Gold Class signature dessert, this is cetainly one of the cutest robot movies I have ever seen! Don't you just love seeing WALL-E and EVE together? They look so cute!

If one wants a bit of a thrill however, watch Eagle Eye. Starring Transformers' Shia LaBeouf and The Bourne Supremacy's Michelle Monaghan, they play as a young man and a single mother who are brought together and coerced by an anonymous caller into carrying out a dangerous plot, since the caller was using technology of everyday life to track and control their every move! It may not have been the most popular movie, but at least it brings out some excitement!

Because our current PS2 had gone kaput, and that one couldn't get a 60GB PS3 nowadays, I emailed sis about trying to get a 60GB PS3 from Ebay, since it plays both PS1 and PS2 games. Hence Plan B. However, she wasn't too keen on buying one considering the chances of usage, so we're going with Plan C - getting both a PS2 (got a slim one last week) while getting a PS3 when Christmas comes.

And me thinks that'll be all for now! This would probably be the longest journal I ever typed up!"

"event","Must write... before I forget...

Once again, I better explain in writing what happened so far. Firstly, something tells me that if I wanted to make my recently acquired Gundam models accurate to the show, I had to start taking lessons in painting. Therefore, I went off to Games Workshop in the city to help me with the painting courses. So far, there's still much for me to learn, but other than that, I wonder if there are some good Gundam painting tutorials out there?

Speaking of learning, it's been a year since I started working at Hungry Jacks, and I wonder if there are anymore skills worth learning. Other than that, my family thought it's time I try to obtain some new skills and better pay in another job. For now, I'm searching, via an employment company.

Also, besides watching the new Strike Witches anime series and the awesome 2008 Beijing Olympic Games in action, I finally saw the new Batman movie, 'The Dark Knight'! An awesome movie, with once again Christian Bale standing out in his title role plus the late Heath Ledger as the nutty but cool villian the Joker! Unofficially, I saw it 'twice' because the first time, the fire alarm went off and we had to be evacuated from the cinema. It turns out to my annoyance that the restaurant (at the same level as the cinema) caught fire and hence it wasn't a drill. Fortunately I got a voucher allowing me to see the movie again, THIS TIME... no disturbances!

And that'll be all for now! And hope Spring is worth enjoying once again!"

"event","So far, nothing much has happened so far since I last updated. But some events say the otherwise, and I best leave the good news for last.

First up, I'm not sure what exactly happened, but it seemed our silver PS2 decided to bite the bullet. In short, something must have happened, as my two younger cousins wanted to play Final Fantasy VIII. A minute later, something goes blooming wrong - which came in form of the disc drive refusing to close properly. I don't know how it happened or that the kiddies did something to it... but it's a sure sign to get a new PS3. Nevertheless, my sister wasn't pleased and had to hold back her anger because of their recent loss of their mother a few years back. Also, she paid a good cost for the PS2, and so we best to divide our payments for a new PS3 later on.

But enough of the bad news. In most recent events, I quite enjoyed watching Mobile Suit Gundam Wing - a truly awesome mecha series worth watching from the beginning to the very end! Now, I anticipate the wait of watching the OVA Endless Waltz when it arrives! Apart from that, my Gundam Model Collection has grown to a new level (considering I got the First Grade Stike and the High Grade 1/144 Gundams from Gundam 00, total of seven, not including my FG model and including my Gundam Thrones) my order finally arrived last week! The new level scale of 1/100, in form of what is to be one of my favourites to come, the Gundam Astray Gold Frame Amatsu! Quite a spectacular Gundam, with a very cool black, gold, red and a sort of lightish purple scheme, with very cool kickass weaponry to boot, including the Trikeros armed shield! I better save up for the Red Frame and the Blue Frame Second L too!

Well I better be off now, considering this journal is done for the month. Take care, all of you!

PS: Got a new pair of Simpsons slippers - in form of Homer Simpson saying his famed catchphrase, 'D'oh!' with the soundbyte in the right slipper to boot! :)"

"event","How should I begin? Starting off with the trip to Melbourne with my mother (if you recall, a trip since Mum had sick leave from work), it quite interesting, in a matter of speaking. Considering there was a number of events that transpired over the three nights spent there at Novotel Melbourne on Collins St. With not only shopping around the city along with Chinatown at Little Bourke St, there was also two guided tours we went on, and it was worthwhile! Not to mention the scary fact that during our second night there when we were coming back from our first tour, we found out that the cabbie protest outside Flinders St. Station was a few blocks away from where we're staying! <b>Epp.</b>

But appart from that, the tours. Mum and I had a lot of fun on them, and for the first whole day in Melbourne, went on the Gray Line Day Tours to the Great Iceab Road Adventure, which involved seeing quite an impressive coastline of Port Campbell's National Park's Shipwreck Coast! This was also home to the famed Twelve Apostles stone monoliths (now eight due to weather conditions) and also Loch Ard Gorge, site of the tragic shipwreck of the 'Loch Ard'. After that lengthy tour, Mum and I also went out to dinner at Universal Pizza Italian Restaurant, located Lygon St. And I must say, quite a dinner worth enjoying too! Mmm... pizza. 

After our second night, we had a bit of shopping in the morning, of course, pity we couldn't go to any Chinatown restaurants for breakfast since they don't open until 11am. The afternoon tour we went on consisted of going to Phillip Island, and also seeing the cute wittle Fairy (Little) Penguins in the Penguin Parade! Awww... It was certainly quite fun watching the little guys come home to rest at their burrows after coming home from sea, especially at nightime! 

Sad to say, it was time to go, but despite the cold weather, there was a lot of enjoyment around Melbourne. Another place worth going to... I wish I could see more of it... 

As my sister's birthday was approaching, I thought I'd go along with a present. And the present I obtained for her was none other than Wolf's Rain! An intriguing anime... I can't wait to watch for what happens next! 

Finally, there were three movies I watched this month. The first movie was Nim's Island - probably not my favourite movie but one best recommended for family entertainment. The second would be one of my favourites in years to come - Iron Man! An awesome live-action film adaption based on one armoured superhero, this film took my breath away with some awesome action scenes! Finally, another favourite of mine was the new Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull! I took Mum along for the enjoyment - this time another cool round of actions scenes, in the adventurer's way! It's good to see Indy making his return to the big screen - even though Harrison Ford's 64 years old, hence his joke, ""I'm old enough to play my own father in this one."" 

Well, that's about it for me. I better get to bed before Mum's voice goes hoarse."

"event","Thought I better make this quick, as I'm departing to Melbourne with my mother this morning. We're going to Melbourne because ever since Mum had to take a sick leave for an operation on her swollen fingers last week it would be a good opportunity to have some fun in order for her to recover. Originally she was thinking Hong Kong but the lack of time for immunisation and my notification of work abscene hindered the plans. 

Other than my package which contained the Gundam Wing Complete Operations DVD has finally arrived, enjoyment of my newest DS game Custom Robo Arena, and the usual fun at Supernova, here's hoping I can catch up to things once I get back. Until then, see you all later when I come back on Thursday!"

"event","It's times like these when you feel like you don't want to update... now would be a good time! Again, I apologize. Which comes to show I better update on Fanfiction.net too! This time, I have some interesting news to share with you all.

Once again, Christmas was enjoyable, especially one example when I baked a honey-glazed ham once again! It certainly was different to the one I used in 2006, but I, along with my family, friends and relatives quite enjoyed it just the same, with the savouriness of the meat along with sweet taste of the honey glaze, which had some additional sweetness of some marmalade in it.

Other than that I received some interesting presents. A co-worker of my mother's gave me a Calvin Klein Deodorant, my cousin Richard gave me his game, Okami (haven't got around to playing so far, but my sister quite enjoyed it!), my little cousins 'Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties' (store bought), my sister 'Transformers: Decepticons', etc. All in all it was quite a nice Christmas as always - lots of food, drink and fun! Now to think of what to do for this year...

Then there was the movie 'I Am Legend', possibly not one of my favourite movies but I always could do with a bit of a thrill. Another entertaining moment involved going to the stage production of 'The Phantom of the Opera', which was worth it! The pieces of music, the acting, sensational! Especially the moments with the Phantom himself, played by Anthony Warlow!

Other than that, I seem to have developed a liking to Gundam as I already obtained the models from the new Mobile Suit Gundam 00, the 1/144 scale HG (High Grade). So far I got Gundam Exia and Dynames, and just started building Kyrios. And to get into the Gundam line, I borrowed out the Operations 1 DVD of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing just to have a watch. Already, I like it!

Finally, I have to save the good news for last, as I'm turning 21 next Friday, which is the 7th of March! However, since it's a day I'm working, I'm intending on having a party in the VIP room of the Hanaichi Sushi Bar and Dining on the evening of Sunday the 9th! Hopefully, when the arrangements are made it'll be a celebration worth remembering! Another round of food and drink, and hopefully some pressies too! And for me to think of a good 21st birthday special too...

Well, time for me to bugger off. Once again, enjoy the evening!"

"event","Sorry I've been quite lazy in my update again. It's hard for me to keep track what's been happening, especially with some setbacks lately. But here are some things I have to type up.

Firstly, it may have been a late celebration, but at last as a way to congratulate myself for getting my job at Hungry Jacks, we didn't go to Cha Cha Cha, but instead had lunch at one Liquorish Bistro & Bar Restaurant. It wasn't as what I expected, but it was worthwhile!

Then, somewhare on the 11th of last month, my family and myself were invited to a distant cousin's wedding at the Q1 Observation Deck, Gold Coast. For the people who don't know, it's known as the world's tallest residential tower, nearly about 80 levels and 322.5 metres high! It certainly was enjoyable celebrating a wedding in the Skylight room, where you could see almost everything around the Gold Coast! Not so sure if that's relevant, but their signature cake (in the shape of the building itself) was really good!

"event","So sorry I haven't written in over a month - there were some things that were pretty unexpected things that happened. Interesting enough, I began a work trial for a few weeks at Hungry Jacks in hopes to being hired. But what the heck, I'm explain now...

First piece of news I received what that one, I saw two movies, one The Simpsons Movie, which I found it okay, but the other, in which I was more of a fanboy of, was none other than the live-action movie, TRANSFORMERS! Truly a 2007 movie worth watching - it so kicks ass indeed! It was so good I even saw it twice with my younger cousins in cinemas - something I haven't done in a while since Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie!

After seeing the movie, it inspired me to do a little deviation special - only to run into an unexpected mishap. To my total annoyance I found that I didn't have a fold for that particular project, and that I had to order a book that has it! Now, I expect it's either one, or two weeks to go til it comes in, and I apologise for the wait. Hence the reason why I submitted an Ancrocanthosaurus fold instead.

Next, on Saturday, my relatives from Hong Kong have arrived for a visit, five of them to be exact. Apparently, they're staying for a week, which seems rather short considering they were going to Sydney from Thursday to Friday. However, yesterday we travelled to Tangalooma Wild Dolphin Resort. It was certainly a place I haven't been to for a while - especially since I participated in a 4x4 quad bike ride up the dunes and later went with my family for a safari tour to a desert part of the resort. Though I went sand tobogganing down a rather large slope, I think once is only enough as I never enjoyed the feeling of sand in unmentionable places!

And so, expect a few days of trips, feasts and fun! And no only that, if my book comes on time, I'm intending on dedicating my Transformers special to my 2000th visitor because currently I have 1,972 Pageviews! Well, once again, I have to be off now. (which has come to pass)"

"event","Another short entry, nothing exactly specially happening today. But I have a feeling I have some things to do... but here's what happened in the past few weeks.

Firstly besides having to celebrate my 1st year at Deviantart with my newest vessel, I went along with my aunt and cousin Daniel to see the movie Ocean's Thirteen, quite an amusing movie (Though I wish I would have seen Twelve considering I heard that the reviews weren't too good for it). Then afterwards last weekend, we celebrated my other cousin Matthew's birthday by having lunch at Sizzlers, and as usual, it was good once again!

But the best thing I enjoyed now was that I recently acquired Pokemon Pearl now! Now that sis not only has Diamond and her own DS (which she got the same time as myself a few years ago) we can finally trade some Pokemon for evolved forms, booya!

Well, now that's done, I more important things to do at hand. Like awaiting arrival for our new water tank (thanks a lot to bloody water restrictions, installation's gonna happen some days later), my Digimon fanfic, the new TRANSFORMERS movie (yeah baby!) and work on a little special to celebrate the release.... But you'll find out soon when I submit it!"

"event","Where should I start? Oh yes - things happen to go okay on the holidays - like Supernova for example. There was spending involved as usual, and though I got some good items, the bad news was that I didn't get rid of my frickking doubles of my Yu-Gi-Oh! cards! Although to make up for it I was able to complete my Three Phantom Demons/Sacred Beasts set when I obtained Uria and Raviel - after finding Hamon long ago of course! Now for the trouble to sell my doubles on Ebay since someone's using my email address, and I'm not a member of Ebay yet! 

Besides that, there was also one partular night when my sis, her boyfriend and myself went to see the amazing Irish comedian Dylan Moran live! For those who don't know him, he's famous for playing the drunken, sour, and eccentric bookshop owner Bernard Black from the comedy hit, Black Books! I think his style of comedy happened to be the grumpy kind, since he was talking about Brisbane, kids, his home, etc. Other than that, I couldn't exactly remembered what else he talked about, but he was humourous nevertheless! 

Besides going to Wet n' Wild on Labour Day, on Tuesday after seeing the first two movies of 'it' I was able to see Spider-Man 3! Though it was good in terms of special effects, I probably didn't like it as much as the other two movies, particularly one example that Venom didn't have much screen time, and that he didn't speak like in the comics ('I am' instead of 'We are' in the comics). Pity... but he was pretty cool lookin' villian nevertheless!

Finally, since sis is working on her birthday - which was May the 13th, we decided to go on a modernised High Tea lunch - and it was worth it! Our cousins Yena and Jackie came, so did her friends and even her boss from work! Other then that, she not only received some high class tea, hot chocolate and books from us, I also gave her a Serial Experiments Lain DVD collection too! 

Other than that, that's all for today! Now for me to work on what to make for my first anniversary being here on Deviantart..."

"event","I still wonder... as you get older, you often wonder what to do in life. To celebrate my 20th birthday, we went off to Blackjacks at the Treasury Casino for a good old smorgasbord... and like any other usual lunch at places like this, there's over indulgence. But we had to do that on Sunday the 4th since on my actually birthday not many of my relatives would be together on that day with work and all so that day was good.

Still, besides that event, there was the test for obtaining my learner's. After two failures I was able to obtain my learner's on my third try! Huzzah! I guess there are moments 'Third time's the charm' works! So far now, I'm had three driving lessons... they'll resume after Harold, my driving instructor (who was also my sister's instructor) comes back from his Easter holiday on Fraser Island.

And finally, there were two excellent movies I have seen! Both having there way of humour, for one of them, is you love police action with a touch of amusement, there's Hot Fuzz! Sure, it has it's violent moments, but besides the shootouts check out the running gags like the swan for example! However, if you like a bit of slapstick action for your funnybones, there's Mr. Bean's Holiday, which I saw yesterday! It's so good to see Mr. Rowan Atkinson in action once again - especially when a simple holiday to the Cannes turns to disaster!

Still, I can't wait to see how the next lot of movies goes - I'm especially estatic on seeing Transformers and Rush Hour 3! I better be off - I might as well anticipate the coming of Supernova Anime/comics/sci-fi expo! See ya laters!

"event","It's been so long since I last updated. *Sigh* At last, my exams are over and done with! Though I wanted to continue on Japanese, the bad thing is, since I didn't succeed in the previous two subjects in the past semester, I only took Japanese as my only subject. Therefore, I officially resigned from Uni. But at least I have my private tutor for the continuation of my Japanese studies.

Now all I need to do now is to find an apprenticeship. And though it may take a while I'm hoping to get into the money making business soon. But for now, I might as well enjoy the holidays. And one fine example last Monday that while I was at Dymocks it seems I met for the first time, the 'King of Pop Science', Dr Karl 'Dr K' Kruszelnicki! I didn't know why I decided to buy his latest book though I didn't know him much, but he was signing copies of his book. Maybe the reason why I bought the book, 'It Ain't Necessarily So... bro' was because there were some mythconceptions that reminded me of the Mythbusters' urban myth thoeries. Still, it was an honour to meet him.

For now, I shall focus on my deviations, my fanfictions, and job searching. In the meantime, I better get prepared for today!"

The good news is, it is a few days closer to my sister's birthday, and it would be going great. Other than that I was able to submit my assignments on time. But here comes the bad news... 

First of all, my wallet was fucking stolen on April 24th, complete with the cash and various IDs! The good thing was that one of my uncles was kind enough to give me one of his spare ones to me. But even worse is the current condition of our dog, Xing Xing. She wasn't sneezing blood as before, but somehow, we have a bad feeling. Most of the time, she usually runs about in the yard in her energetic self. Now, it seems she hasn't moved much except on a few occassions and the fact she lost her appetite. In other words, we were only able to feed small portions of food like cheese, dog roll loaf, steak and some chicken by hand. I think since of her past sickness the immune system must have gone out of whack, along with the depletion of her platlets in her system. Damn... she's only four years or so old... she can't pass away yet! She's too young for that... being part of our lives for the past few years... god it's more than irritating. 

Somewhat, somehow, we might have to get through this... how depressing. Hopefully, the next entry wouldn't be as bad..."

Other than that, there are good news. I'm now nineteen! Now that my birthday has passed, I also intend on having some fun on the last day of holidays - by going to the Supernova convention too! That is, if I get my work done. Besides, since there Yu-Gi-Oh going on, I don't intend on dueling, by maybe some trading on a few rare doubles and various cards I've collected over the past. Now all I have to do is get back to work. 

Then there's the bad news. About a month ago, the cover of the foot pedal for our new rubbish bin was broken and the cover had to be removed. Then I nearly ripped my toenail (second from left) off that SLAGGIN' PIECE OF CRAP!! Not a grand experience I'd tell you. 

Depending on how life goes, it can either go good or bad. Pity with Uni life, I don't have much time for Fanfiction much as Final Genesis! Life goes on, as usual, with the good and the bad."

Recently, I was able to get an OP score of 15, which is not bad if I do say so myself. I have recently applied to Griffith University on the Nathan Campus, for the Bachelor of Arts, Asian Studies. Three subject have been chosen so far, though hopefully, I would be able to broaden my knowledge of Japanese. Still, I couldn't help but wonder what would happen next for me, other than Orientation Week, starting next week. 

With the last of the packages from China that have arrived, I was pleased! Although there was the clothing for our family (mostly for me), what I was please was that I recieved four new additions to my Zoid collection, making it a total of thirteen Zoids (counting the unfuzed Zoids)! I received Fuzors Liger Zero Pheonix, Blade Liger Black Impact, a Dispellow, and my first Genesis Zoid, a Bio-Tyranno!

Basically, after we first arrived in Hong Kong, we mainly stayed at our Aunt's place... unless you counted the fact we didn't have dinner until 1:00 Aussie time... what pain. There are times the family means well but there are other times it drive me nuts. My Aunt and Uncle at times annoy me... but not as much as the little nine-year-old brat of a cousin (Her real name, unknown, just called her Mou Mou or 'Little Girl' in Chinese). Apart from that, Jin Hung (who was about my age) was okay, he spoke some English, and Jo and I got along with him fine, since he was also understanding. His sister (I presume who was a little older or younger than Jin Hung) Addy, she was a bit shy at times unless when it comes to the phone. How I wished I would have spoken Chinese well... But nevertheless, things were better as there was shopping involved! Most of the items obtained involved CDs, DVDs, and even a Zoids Fuzors Liger Zero Phoenix, and with help from my sister, there were a lot of clothes bought! Talk about a way of style! 

But of course, the shopping wasn't over yet! We later went off to Macau, where we stayed at our father's oldest brother's place. If only I could speak Chinese more because apparently, he was a nice bloke. He was very understanding, and he mentioned that he didn't like going to places with my Aunt because of her fussing. According to Jo, he also enjoys cooking, as he travels to expand his skills! How I wish I could have talked to him more.. but anyways, there was more shopping to be done, and I even obtained more Zoids too! Skin care, letter paper and clothes were also obtained as well, along with going to the 5th Macau food festival! Food from all various eateries in Macau, and some games... Macau isn't a bad place as far as I'm concerned. There was also a place called Lu Wan which was basically a pleasant drive for along the way, you can see the 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac. There also a famous beach called Black Sand, also ate a famous egg tart... too much to explain. Oh yes - people wind up double parking in Macau too. 

The third and final place we went to before we returned to Hong Kong was Canton, the place my parents grew up. I never exactly liked the atmosphere at first, a very rural area with a lot of dust, and the roads were filled with holes, litter, spit and doggy-doo. Overtime however, we became used to this place. Of course, one of the reasons why I liked the place now was it's famous specialty - Spiced Water Snake! It was so hot it could probably give Mongolian Lamb a run of it's money! Other than that, we received some well-taliored clothes, for me, some fantastic workpants while my sister obtained a beatiful red Cheongsam with silver flowers on it. Apparently, she's also gaining a black one with red characters and dragons on it. We also obtained a lot of art as well. 

However, I did mention about my Grandma in my last entry right? During the death ceremony, there are times we could have been able to see her before she passed away. She was a great relative, and will never be forgotten. 

Afterwards, there was a series of events, including Hong Kong Disneyland, shopping in Mong Kok and all, in addition to some unmentionable events (involving my stupid aunt and the brat, eergghh!), and we arrived home! And now I'm out of words! Well, that's about it for now. I hope your holidays are going well too!"

Anyways, when that was done, China here I come! However, though it sounds like a holiday, it doesn't seem like it at the moment. On my last journal entry, I did mention my Grandmother being sick. Now, she passed away last month... and I wanted to see her again... 

Another piece of news also involved my dog being ill too. Xing Xing somehow has wound up with slightly swollen glands and her platelets destroying themselves. But after a blood transfusion, her platelets are slowly being restored and she was discharged out of hospital, along with some medication. Talk about a eventful week.

At least I'm not going to an event like Schoolies at Surfer's Paradise, because in a few days time, I'll be off to China! CDs, games, fashion, and even more Zoids would be of great use to me. It would be truly a good way to relax after the last day of school, especially since of the crazy events. But after the formal and the Dreamworld trip, China beats Schoolies any old day! 

But that wasn't the main reason why I'm going to China. You see, since of old age, my Grandmother is currently ill. She may not the best relative I met, I'd have to admit. But she did raise us when my sister and I were kids, and I'm glad she did at times. By the time we see her... I hope we won't be too late... 

And did I mention more Zoids? Not that it's utterly bad news, but you know about the Gairyuki I received? I knew there was something wrong with the motor, but I never knew until now that one of the gears have finally snapped under pressure... what a drag. A dream Zoid you finally receive, and yet... but at least I could move it manually, and the play value hasn't decreased much. Still, I could do with adding a few more things to my collection. And the Japanese Digimon mp3s are getting harder to find nowadays, which is why I'm intending on getting some CDs too.

There was nothing much to do other than to listen to music, while at other times, I helped with the canteen work.

Other than that, there wasn't much that excited me. However, when it came to one fateful Thursday last week, a package arrived.

I FINALLY RECEIVED MY NEWEST DREAM ZOID, THE GAIRYUKI TYRANNOSAURUS TYPE AT LONG LAST! Interestingly enough, with the name being in Japanese and all, I was thinking of receiving one when I went to Japan, though I missed out on the opportunity because of packaging room.

Unfortunately, my usual taxi service at Black & White Cabs seemed to decide to go and arrive at the last minute, and yesterday I only wound up with fifteen minutes of my first period of Multi-Strand Science to go until 9:30. Today, I was able to arrive in the nick of time, but not without consulting to my teacher who organises the documents for the trips. Seems that there was a new boss in the company or something, I heard. At least when Mum took to to school a few weeks ago, I wasn't as late as the arrival time I could have arrived at, because the TAXI THAT WAS MEANT TO PICK ME UP ARRIVED AS FAR AS 9:30! And in Year 12, on Mondays and Tuesdays, we were meant to start lessons at 8:15. Doesn't anybody know, we have public transport, and we expect efficiently! 

A bad start to my month, because it was my birthday next Monday! And I'm turning 18 this year! How time flies by quickly. Oh well. I just hope next week will turn out decent for schoolwork and all.

Wednesday 29th - Set off on the local Kurashiki-Okayama to the Himeji Castle - with the exception of finding one of the Year 9 students missing. But don't worry, he was reunited with us! By bullet train, we then went off to Kyoto, where we vistited the Ryoanki Garden and the Kinkakuji Temple (Golden Temple), and stayed overnight at K's Guest House Kyoto. 

Thursday 30th - Went to Kiyomizudera and Sanjuusan Gendou. 

Friday 1st Oct. - Went to Nijou Castle, and then into Nara - the place where there was the famous Deer Part and the Todaiji Temple. Glad I didn't decide to by a deer cracker, because to the girls, the deer were alright - until they started biting them, he, he, he, he! At the temple though, I brought an odd item - a miniture hidden katana sword that is actually an earwax remover! There wasn't much to buy at the roadside stalls but I did buy a Pokemon Manga! 

Saturday 2nd - Final day, went off to the Tempozan Aquarium via Shin Osaka - Usual amount of fish, including seeing a Whale Shark for the first time, which was worthwhile! Then after lunch, shopping and all, we then left with our luggage to the Kansai International Airport, and departed for home, arriving back on Sunday morning!

Then after that on Monday, we traveled on the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) to Iwakuni - a place where the famous arched bridge was, along with a White Snake Park. An interesting fact was when we went past some ruined structure, it was badly damaged by a typhoon two weeks ago, which I'm glad we weren't in it! But the good news was there was a lovely ice-cream shop where I had a dual flavoured ice-cream - how I enjoyed Vanilla and Green Tea! After that, it was only a matter of returning to Hiroshima, where we stayed overnight at the Aster Plaza Guest House, Hiroshima. 

Tuesday 28th - we went off to the Hiroshima Peace Park and the Peace Memorial Museum - I was still triggerhappy with the film - I need more experiece when it comes to using shots wisely. Later, we went on to the Honshu and Shikoku Islands by going across the Seto Ohashi Bridge on the the Shinkanshen, and arriving at Takamatsu - where we toured the Ritsurin Japanese Garden. Finally, via Okayama, we stayed overnight at the Kurashiki Youth Hostel.

To tell you the truth, talk about formal! When we were announced on stage, the school was so formal they had a TV crew to film us, and even had a news report of us on stage while we each did our speeches! Know what I mean by that? 

Anyways, the family I stayed at was with the Shirakura family, with the son Yuuya (17 years old), mother and father Fumika and Masazumi (52 and 55 years old), and grandmother Tokiko (77 years old). However, Yuuya also has 24 year old sister, Chieko, who works at a hospital as a nurse, but I don't see her very often at home. But I visted her at the hospital once. All of the family were quite helpful, and nice to me. 

For the next three days, I had a bit of fun with the family, and at school. The first day after my first night, I went with Yuuya, his friend Seisuke, and a fellow Year 9 classmate of mine, Mark, to the Fujikyuu Highland, a rollercoaster-based theme park! Although I went on some of the rides there, I don't think I want to throw up on the tallest rollercoaster ride in the Highland. 

On the second day here, I meet up with the other Albany Creek Students (School I go to in Brisbane). Most of the day, we went off to Mt Fuji for a bit of a sightseeing tour. An amazing thing I found was that one particular candy that was sold was made to look like the rock from Fuji itself! We also went off to one of the vineyards of Isawa to try some of the grapes. It is also the night where Yuuya and his mother invited me to a Smorgasbord-styled dinner, along with Mark and Seisuke's family and two friends at the Sutami Taro restaurant! Best of all, you can grill the meat on a griller in the middle of each individual table in this place, which was quite fun, along with the food variety including takoyaki (fried octopus balls), yakitori (chicken skewers), and green tea ice cream! 

Finally, we went to a mountain called the Shosenkyo, and next, we also went to a Toys ru'us, which is where I did my final Zoids shopping, and with the help of my host family, we sent the package to Australia! I hope it would come soon! Not only that, we went to a traditional Japanese stage theatre at night, which was also good! 

On Sunday, that's where we all packed up, and said goodbye to our families, thanking them for looking after us. I have to admit, I miss the Shirakuras very much, after what they did for me. But nevertheless, it was fun! Part 3 of my trip shall come soon!"

How I disliked that, especially when she would have talked to my teacher to cancelling my trip. There are times I respected her for looking after me, and other times I could be in an annoyed mood. But then again, I couldn't wait until I go to Japan for my trip! 

Short, but at least I wrote something after a week or so. That shall be it for today."

"event","Ekka Wednesday... a time where people decide to go to RNA Showgrounds for entertaining the kids, for fun, for spending cash on food, showbags... not. With the expenses along with the diseases, I'd rather spend cash on this year's Supernova comics, anime and manga convention. But then again, the fun really happens on the day after on Sunday 19th, with the trip to Japan with the attending Jap class students! Until then, I have to practise some Japanese before then. And at least that's the kind of place I want to spend! 

Now, for today... homework, and maybe some work and play, cause sis is off to work at about 4 o'clock and so is Mum, which leaves me to guard the house. There's still some homework to do, and nothing more, as long as there's music to listen to. Pity that my order for Noir Vol.5 hasn't come yet. Go figure... 

Well, that's all for now. Then again, only about a month to go til my Japan trip. I could hardly wait! Zoid Models, here I come! And some Jap CD whether neccessary."

"event","Another week, another time. With more homework and more. Once again, the Ekka is arriving soon, but I'm not bothered since of the upcoming arrival of Supernova and my trip to Japan. Oh yes, and speaking of Japan, from my good friend Seth, I happened to borrow a Vol. manga that could prove quite interesting, if there would have been more of these sites displayed on Anime Web Turnpike. 

According to the plot, it follows a story of a Vampire King name Duzell, who was defeated by King Phelios a century ago, about in the medieval ages. As both lay dying on the battlefield, the Vampire swore that his reincarnated soul will find his rival's soul and exact his revenge. Trouble is, a century later... he was reincarnated as a harmless house cat, and he couldn't find his rival's reincarnation. But luckily, since he was adapted by Phelios' great-grandaughter Ishtar, he might have a higher change at finding his rival after all. 

I wonder how popular was that series anyways? Maybe I would find out more later on, and Seth reckoned if I liked Fruits Basket, maybe that helps. Oh well, and back to work. And not only that, tonight's episode of Queer Eye should be on soon."

"event","At last, I managed to finish my English Assignment! But unfortunately, just as I handed it in, a new Maths assignment comes in. How annoying. But then again, life is never easy in Senior years once again. 

Even though this morning was an annoying pain since of the late arrival at school (because of the taxi company), at least yesterday was going well. The fun thing was, after meeting up with Will's friend Seth, along with Matt and a younger kid Brandon, we had a good chat about one of our best-loved anime series, Evangelion, at the library. Consider that one of the best methods of having a good time socialising, and I enjoy talking to people with a common interest in Japanese anime. 

Then again, there's the Athletics Carnival on Friday coming up, in which I could either compete, or just sit back and listen to music and a couple of books too. Another good method of having fun, although I could do with helping to gain house points. And just yesterday, thanks to sis, we now have the new PS2 game, Dancing Stage Megamix, along with a new dance mat! Though I'm dissatisfied of the cushiony kind. But hey, it was quite fun, isn't it?

Speaking of fun, there were times where I could do with another trip to the city, that is if I could gain Noir Vol.5 from J-B Hi-Fi, in which they haven't rang up yet for that order. It has only been four weeks now. Oh well. Wish I could do with chucking a smoke grenade down the entrance of the Showgirls livepeep, these adult, porno-addicting shows have angered me so, yeessss. Wonder if it was connected to the porno magazines, which would have been useful for incinerating inside a fireplace. 

Well, that's my rant for tonight. Better be off to bed since of school tomorrow, and another typical day has arrived. But no matter the odds, I have one thing to say to you all.

Though it can be harsh at times, life is fun! And don't you dare let it bring your spirits down!"

"event","Still at work, nothing new. But I'm glad I could manage to finish my English assignment on time. Though I wish I could fix up my lazy nature, which I'm guilty about sometimes. But here's a new quiz, and I hope problems wouldn't bring you down for the rest of you all! 

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/A/Aeon65/1075764444_thsUnicorn.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""HASH(0x8b1e250)""><br><B>Ki-lin

A mythical being of Chinese mythology, comparable<br>with the western unicorn. Ki-lin personifies<br>all that is good, pure, and peaceful. It lives<br>in paradise and only visits the world at the<br>birth of a wise philosopher.  The Ki-Lin is<br>said to walk on earth and on water. It never<br>drinks or eats dirty food or water. The Chinese<br>unicorn never treads on smaller animals below<br>its feet nor does it ever harm another living<br>creature. The Ki-Lin is the emblem for<br>exquisite goodness, longevity, grandeur,<br>endless compassion and great wisdom. According<br>to Chinese mythology, at the birth of Confucius<br>a Ki-Lin appeared and Confucius died soon after<br>a Ki-Lin was killed, he believed that his<br>writings would not proceed from the omen of the<br>death of the Unicorn.

"event","The third term for Year eleven has begun, with nothing new in mind. Except for an English assignment and homework from school. I wish some excitement could happen. Other than that, I saw Zoids Fuzors for the first time, but I wonder if the series will go well, or not, since of rumors and that there was less excitement than the previous series. But nevertheless, here's a Zoids quiz, from a very few I found so far:

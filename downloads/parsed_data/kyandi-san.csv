"event","Office 2007 is enough to make me want to take a gun to my head and shoot my own brains out.
<lj-cut text=""More Spazzing..."">
I'm a geek.  The PC is my tool of choice.  If Microsoft were Xerxes, then Mac would be Spartan.
For as far as the technological world could remember, Microsoft has dominated with an Iron Fist.

They have now taken that Iron Fist and shoved it down the Corporate throat.  No joke.

Those of you who work in an office environment are probably familiar with the program called OpenOffice.  Due to the fact it is free for download, and serves just as well as MS Office for a ""office suite"", many companies use it.  

We have several departments at my work that use OpenOffice, and since I'm a workaholic and I work even when I'm at home, this means a lot of the work I do is from my laptop.  Windows Vista doesn't like Microsoft Office 2003 (which is my office suite of choice, mostly due to familiarity with the program and plain lethargy on my part), and in order to avoid all the troubles I knew would eventually rear its ugly head in the form of incompatibility and bugs, I caved and grabbed a copy of Microsoft Office 2007.

MS Office 2007 saves document files in the .docx format.  Previously, I was able to take documents I had created at home and just email them to various recipients at work.  To my dismay, I was informed the next day that the files could not be opened.  Bugger it.  I did a little investigating and realized not only is OpenOffice not compatible with the new .docx format, but my method of converting the file format so that it could be opened actually removes all the formating from the document.  This was not my doing, but something implanted by Microsoft in the way they save the files.  They strip the document of formating THEN save, rather then doing both at the same time.

In other words, Corporations will now have to purchase Microsoft Office 2007 for every single computer that needs access to Office 2007 files.  OpenOffice users will no longer be able to open Office 2007 documents.  Either no one upgrades to MS Office 2007, or EVERYONE upgrades.

Why has Microsoft done this?  The first reasoning is plain and simple: $$$
The second reason?  Cuz Microsoft is a PAIN IN THE ASS and I swear to god their programmers do this just to mess with the geeks of the world.  It's their way of flipping us the middle finger and saying ""try muddling through this one n00bs!  you've been pwned!""

Like I said before... FUCK MICROSOFT.</lj-cut>"

<lj-cut text=""More boring bullshit..."">

Another year of the cheerful cherub darting from household to household causing death by heartbreak, suicidal tendencies and extreme, extreme fatigue from hours of endless self-hatred for the fabricated holiday.

To me, Valentine's day is the night Al Capone celebrated the loving season by killing 8 people on the streets of Chicago.  What better way to celebrate love then to take their ticker right out of their body?  Okay, I'm not sure he did that, but if I was Capone I would have.

My otherside doesn't like celebrating valentines either.  He says if you don't get time off for the damned holiday, then its not worth celebrating.  Well said, well said.  Luckily he's a smart man too, because despite the fact this holiday irks me to no end, I happily accepted his Valentine's Day Gift - a spa package complete with aromatherapy.

I am a self-declared <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/01/10"">""hypocritic""</a> so leave me alone.  I'm allowed to hate the holiday and then readily accept a gift from the boyfriend for honoring the day.

<b>More News...</b>
The PC's finally came in at work so I'm off the Mac's.  I miss the Mac.  PC's suck.  Ya you heard me!  This long time supporter of the PC has finally thrown in the towel and now wants to buy a Mac.  

Have you seen the new Mac commercial featuring the new Vista security system?  Yeah.  I thought so.  You wanna know something?  It's only funny, because it is <b>true</b>.  That's right!  So my next investment will be a Mac.

But, being the hypocritic that I am, I shall purchase a new PC, most likely a laptop not soon after, for the sole purpose that 3DS 8 and Flash just works better on a PC.  

I refuse to get Vista though.  Because you know what Vista stands for?  VIRUS INFECTIONS!  SPYWARE!  TROJANS!  ADWARE!  Damn straight.

Besides, why in the world would you want to go through <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/02/02"">this?</a>

"event","It is now 2007 and what better way to break in the New Year then to spend every last penny I own?

On this of course:

<img src=""http://www.jp.playstation.com/info/release/img/060509_ps3_04.jpg"" />

<lj-cut text=""Read more..."">


Now, in all fairness, when I went shopping yesterday I was looking for the Nintendo Wii.  I had played Super Monkey Ball at a New Years Eve party and thought to myself, ""Well now lookee at Nintendo's newest creation.  It ain't half bad.  Why, I might just meander on down to Futureshop tomorrow to buy the darned thing.""

However, Nintendo had other plans.  I searched 2 Walmart's, 3 Futureshops and even a Bestbuy but could not find the damned thing in stock.  Driving by 32nd Ave, I came across the Toys'R'Us and though oh hell, may as well ask here too.  Walked in to inquire about the Wii and was given the same response: ""Well, we had 10 this morning but they're all sold out now.""  Typical.

As I was about to leave, I noticed out of the corner of my eye a nice big Toys'R'Us price tag advertising for something that was $650.00.  What might this be?  Why, it's the Playstation 3 in all its 60GB glory.

I was conflicted.  My wallet was screaming its protest while my heart was dancing with joy.  To spend or not to spend?  That was the question.  When conflicted, I always turn to my better half, who in this case is possibly my worse half.  It only took one look at Ken's longing face to tell me that there was no way we would be able walk away from Toys'R'Us with our money and wallets intact.

The next is well, a blur.  There was the extra controller to purchase, the USB cable to charge said extra controller and 2 new games (Marvel Ultimate Alliance & Gundam).  Toys'R'Us happily took $1089.00 from me last night and I didn't even get the HDTV cables yet (I forgot the PS3 doesn't come with HDTV cables...fucking Sony and their ability to leech every last penny out of my bank account!!!)

The final verdict of the PS3?

- Without HDTV cables, it performs like an Xbox 360.  Take that Microsoft fans and shove it up your Bill Gates loving ass.

- With HDTV cables, it's like watching the future unfold before your eyes.  Once game developers actually figure out how to utilize the full potential of the system, games are going to look fanfuckingtastic.

- The controllers are lightweight, but that's because they took out the vibrate function.  No biggie for me.  Those who complain about it are the ones who used the vibe function for *ahem* ""other purposes"".

- The wireless charges through the PS3, no batteries required.  PS3 controllers also utilize BLUETOOTH technology, whereas the Wii only uses infrared.  May I also remind the owners of the Wii how obsolete infrared is these days?  Fuck, you have to stand DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE FUCKING WII before the controller registers.  Not so with the PS3 Sixaxis Controller.  Downside: They tend to run out of juice pretty quickly.  Ie: Not compatible with my 8 hour long FF sessions.

- Motion sensing system.  FUCK THE WII.  The PS3 has motion sensing too.  Take that Nintendo and shove it up your ""oh let's only release limited copies of the Wii"" ass.  

- The thing is heavy.  Fucking heavy.  Of course, it's home to the Cell Broadband Engine, so I expected weight.  Bonus: The PS3 is heavy enough to replace my weights.  All I have to do is lift it from the shelf to the floor, then floor to the shelf again for my daily exercise.


So all in all, I am very VERY happy I got the PS3 instead of the Wii.  Eventually, Wii games will find their way to the PS3 with its motion sensing controller using BLUETOOTH (fuck infrared and Nintendo Wii!).  

I've played the Xbox 360, I've played the Nintendo Wii.  In the end, I bow down to Sony and happily give them my life savings in exchange for their newest cash cow: Playstation 3.

This year, instead of doing my usual witch/vampire/something pasty with a cape sorta costume, I'm going full out.  My company is having an after hours halloween party.  We're planning on watching scary movies and maybe even a murder mystery or two.

So what exactly am I going as this year?  

Shinigami!

<lj-cut text=""Read more!"">

Yup, I've watched so much freaking Bleach this year that I'm just going to give up and show up in full Shinigami wear.  It gives me an excuse to carry around my katana not to mention it's one of the few costumes that might just prove to be warm enough for Halloween night - in case any drunk coworkers decide they do want to come trick or treating with me after all. :)

No I'm not going as Rukia.  It's way too overdone.  Everyone's done a Rukia costume before and I refuse to.
So I'm going as Ise Nanao instead (this may change to Yachiru Kusajishi if I can get my hair cut in time and my hair dyed cotton candy pink).

I'm so excited!  I ordered tabi socks off of Ebay, some woven sandals from HK as well as the material that I'm using to make my outfit.
Oh, and for those of you wondering why I'm not going as a Captain but Vice Captain...it's because I'm not sure I'll have enough time to make the white overcoat the Captains wear.  That and I have no idea where I'm going to get a hold of a silk screen machine to print the big black numbers on the back of the coat.  

Anyway!  Bleach cosplay this halloween!  Stay tuned for pictures!!!!

Lately that's all my life has been...school and work.  I've actually forgotten what it feels like to have the sun beat down the top of my head...because all my free time is dedicated to either studying or trying to unwind by beating a bunch of faceless n00bs on the net at whatever online game attracted my fancy that evening.

It's such a sad life, I know.  However, working so much does leave me rolling in the bling bling.  With any luck next year I'll be off to the caribbean again for more Scuba Diving in the great turquoise blue.  Hopefully this time I will be able to drag along a few close friends to come with me.  Nothing like some fun in the sun with people you actually want to spend time with.

Speaking of people I want to spend time with...I get to see Dionne and Connie this weekend.  If I can get a hold of Benz, her too!  I haven't seen my girls in forever and nothing like a Mariah Carey concert to bring together some old friends.  I'll swing by the night market as well while up in Richmond before hauling my ass back to Kelowna on Sunday to return to my ho hum life.

Well, it's not as ho hum as one may think.  I have a flash game in development.  With any luck I'll be able to add it to my portfolio.  By the time I leave this company I'm hoping to apply at EA Games (Firaxis is too far away :( ).  I've given up on politics, the state of the world disgusts me.  I'm going to spend time creating something that'll one day bring a temporary smile to some kid's face and maybe give another the satisfaction of pwning n00bs all night long.

To be able to take your foot to the pedal and drive freely in disregard for speed limits through the beautiful Rocky Mountains during the summertime is breath-taking.<br><br>It was me, Ken and Vinh in my crappy Honda Civic as we drove the 4 hours over to Vancouver.  The winding roads after the Coquihalla before you hit Chilliwack is my favorite stretch of road.  The rolling foothills of the Rocky Mountains blanketed in a thick layer of summer green interrupted only by the occasional farm building is strangely relaxing.  In areas like this the people grow around the land and the keen eye can still pick out the rolling lines of the earth, sculpted eons before any human existence could be found.  <br><br><img src=""http://www.shortcuteasian.com/vanpic3.jpg""><br>""Every happy ending requires a hero.""<lj-cut text=""PARTY HARD!!!""><br><br>Lady Luck smiled me that day, not a single highway patrol in sight as I sped along happily at 150km/h.

We arrived in good time and I met up with my best girl Dee at No.9 Restaurant. <br><br><img src=""http://www.shortcuteasian.com/vanpic6.jpg""><br>""Smile.  With love.""<br><br>Beautiful isn't she?

One would think it odd that a Chinese person would be so obsessed with Chinese food, but that's because you've never eaten at No.9.  Every bite reminds me of the fantastic food I left behind in Hong Kong.  Their coffee/tea drink is by far the best I have found in North America.  Liquid heaven passes through these lips anytime I take a sip.

Oakenfold is my hero.  He has single handedly proven to me that image means nothing.  He is perhaps the most famous DJ to ever spin who looks butt ugly.  Yet the minute I stepped into the club I could already see the whores all lined up to get a piece of Oakie.  <br><br><img src=""http://www.shortcuteasian.com/vanpic5.jpg""><br>""Isn't she adorable?  I love her to pieces.""<br><br>For as long as I can remember I have partied with Mercedes.  From her first party at Narnia to attending every Connected and Canada Day party, she has been there along side me.  *sniffles*  I really miss her.  She's getting married soon too *cries* I don't know what I'm going to do without her.  We had so much fun.  Atlantis was completely packed.  To the point where dancing was impossible and even bopping to the music caused you to bump into someone.  A very sweaty someone more often then not.  I was fairly disgusted by the amount of times I was accidentally ""bumped"" into and a guy coped a feel, but hey, it's a club and it's almost expected.  Paul Oakenfold played for about an hour and a half before the cops showed up and shut down the entire operation.  Something about residential noise control but with the amount of police cars parked outside the club as I left, I suspected a few of the drug dealers running around inside the club were about to get busted. <br><br><img src=""http://www.shortcuteasian.com/vanpic7.jpg""><br>""Gimme some luvin!""<br><br>We had dinner at Guu With Garlic that night.

My bestest friend in the whole wide world showed up for Warped Tour.  What had happened was I had found out he had 4 days off before his new job and he was sitting at home playing Warcraft of all things, wasting his vacation.  I promptly called him up and with a little persuasion convinced him to book a flight and fly down to Vancouver the next day.  He arrived just in time for Warped Tour and we spent the whoooooole day catching up and chatting.  I love this man to pieces and I was very happy to see him.<br><br>I parked my arse on a nice piece of grass and enjoyed the bands as they played.  Heard Moneen, Silverstein, Underoath, AFI but missed Alexisonfire.  Bought a crap load of AFI merchandise because they are the shiznit.  Counted around 200 people that wore the exact same shoes as I did.  Yay for Chuck Taylor's!  Now I would have been able to catch Alexisonfire if it weren't for the fact my friend Vinh, the mad partier he is, caught an asthema attack right before Alexisonfire hit the stage.  I entered panic zone for a good 15 mins as I rushed him off to the first aid tent.  The panic mode ensued as the first aid technicians didn't have a clue what to do with him.  They stood around for a bit looking stupid before the paramedics arrived.  He was rushed off in a stretcher and we left Warped Tour in the glory of an ambulance.  That's right bitches!  We partied so hard we had to get carted out on a stretcher!  *giggles*<br><br><img src=""http://www.shortcuteasian.com/vanpic12.jpg""><br>""Sup fools?""<br><br>He had recovered immensely by the time they got him into emergency.  Okay enough to even pose as I snapped his pic.  Thank god he was alright, I nearly had a fright attack.  Spent the next day shopping, bought a crapload of stuff from FCUK and Morgan De Toi.  I have expensive tastes and my wallet most definately suffered this time around.<br><br>We drove back to Kelowna in the heart of darkness.  The towering monstrosities of the Rocky Mountains even more foreboding in the darkness.  I found myself strangely calm as I drove, the road appearing only moments before me from the dim light my headlights offered.  The twist and turns of the road in the dark seemed almost a challenge.  In the silence of the vehicle and the peacefulness of a mountain night, I felt myself refreshed despite the fact I had been on my feet the entire day.  This trip had allowed me to reconnect with many friends, secure bonds that I felt had drifted a bit.  Being able to see Wilson on such short notice completely made the trip for me.  He's family and I have been away from home for a very very long time.  We officially ended ""Vancouver"" in Vancouver with a trip to Mondo Gelato, but as we pulled into Kelowna I realized Vancouver never really ends.  It just waits patiently for you to return and pick up where you left off.<br><br><img src=""http://www.shortcuteasian.com/smaller.jpg""><br>""Fini""</lj-cut>"

<lj-cut text=""Read more!"">
The one reason why I've played World of Warcraft for so long is because I've developed a strange group of online friends whom I actually enjoy playing the game with.  My guild is a very big reason of why Blizzard bleeds me dry every month to play their stupid game.

Strangely enough, all it takes is one person to ruin it all.

Working in any support job means you have to deal with all types of people, even the ridiculously arrogant and rude ones.  That however, is not something I feel I should have to deal with online.

I can hardly compete with a bored kid on summer vacation who can spend all his life in the game.  

*sigh* I think it's finally time to say goodbye to the World of Warcraft.  The community lacks something these days and the respect a human being gives another human being is no longer there.  I put up with enough BS at work, I hardly need to do it at home.

So...with that said...anyone got any new MMORPG's worth checking out?  Currently playing Guild Wars: Factions.

If you play that game too send me a hollar with your player name.  It's time to explore a new world and expand horizens!!

Say what?  Uh...no.  But rather then frown on the stupidity of bowing to an empty room, I follow tradition and wonder what else I forgot.

It's so strange, I grew up in such a traditional Chinese household but I find it hard sometimes to remember the traditional movements I used to go through every year at the insistence of my grandmother.  I've never bothered to remember, someone always knew the dates, when to worship which buddhist god and what not.  Now that I'm alone if I want to remain in touch with that side of my ethnicity I'll have to actually make an effort to remember the small things.

Or the fact there are so many natural parks just minutes away good for hikes, bikes and well, anything else you might fancy.  Then there's the mountain view, no matter where you are you're near the mountains.  And the beautiful vineyards all ripe and brimming with fruit, waiting to be picked.

Summer truly is beautiful in Kelowna...let's just hope Winter doesn't settle in too soon.

And now I'm thinking about starting my third one.  Even my guild admits that I'm just a bit crazy.  I blame it on the Chinese farmer inside me.  We're born to farm.  We're meant to farm.  It's all we know how to do, I swear!

The expansion pack better come out soon, I have 5 60's under my account now that I don't know what to do with because, well hell after you reach rank 14 in PvP there -IS- nothing to do.  So my chars just sat there and degraded back to Private.

Meanwhile, it's getting warm out and I hate being stuck in a classroom all day then off to work until 9.  By the time I leave the sun is gone and the weather's grown cold again.  Crappy.

Heck, I get to play video games at work!  This is the best job I've ever found to date and if I'm smart I'll do everything in my power to keep it!  With that said, new apartment found, new job found.  Brilliant...life is absolutely brilliant!

"event","Moving isn't nearly as fun as they make it sound like on HDTV.  While you can browse the glamour lots, a student like me just simply can't afford $1000/month for rent.  So I've been trying to find something small, something cheap that has fix-up potential.

My key is to spend the minimal amount of money this move.  The last time I moved to Toronto I spent over $2000 on new furniture, household items and internet related paraphinalia.  Then my move to Kelowna cost me just over $1000.  Since I'm moving within the city, and only to a new place, I want my expenses to top out at $500.  

I'm not sure it can be done, since everytime I go visit Ikea or Daiso all I think about is buying new furniture.  But I'm going to try something new (after watching a particular episode of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy that completely inspired me).  Modern Grunge is the name of the game and I want my new place to be small, quaint and just a side of nitty gritty.  Which I will completely revamp (yes even with the ugly puke yellow wallpaper most of the older apartments are famous for) into something I can live with.

Keep things basic and close to home, use things like old textbooks stacked on top of each other for an impromptu end table.  Arrange various decorations into ""art corners"" instead of placing them all over the place.  Use only specific coloring within the house to bring out the old shine and use lots and lots of mirrors, but use with caution.

There's a few new places on my list, one of them even has a questionable pool.  What I'm aimming for is convenience and pricing.  This will just be one move of many.  After this will be the ultimate move out to Vancouver with Ken, but that will come in time.

So busy busy busy.

At least the interior designer within me is having fun. :)"

"event","Another birthday has come and gone and while I'm one year older I certainly don't feel one year wiser.  The thing about birthdays is that as a kid you were extremely excited about them.  They meant parties, balloons, cake and soda pop - tons of soda pop.  There were presents galore, friends running amock through your house as your parents wear those silly party hats and bring out your cake, big enough to feed half of Texas.

I admit freely to anyone that wants to accuse of me such that I am completely spoiled.  As a child I brought the definition into the word ""brat"".  There were always presents, always a party, always cake - usually ice cream.  There were sleepovers and movie outtings and there was even Chucky Cheese - before those bastards closed the place down.

Now that one is older and presumably wiser (although the latter is debatable), birthdays just don't mean as much.  Or rather, they mean something else altogether.  

I woke up that morning with only one thought in my head - another year gone by and I feel like I haven't moved at all.  Life is stagnant, but it's not due to a lack of events.  I had gone through the equivalent of an emotional rollercoaster ride and just barely made it off alive and with my sanity in tact.  I had relearned what it means to ""love thy self"" and that being entirely selfish in regards to your own welfare is the only way to ensure survival in the known world.

My teenage birthday years were celebrated in a flurry of bars and raves and drunken house parties where I just wasn't sober enough to remember half the details.  And as I sat down to a quiet dinner prepared lovingly for me by my significant other, I realized this type of quiet celebration with the someone that loves you beats all that.  There'll never be party balloons and silly games of marco polo in the back yard, but then a few years down the road I hope to be planning that for my children.  From the streamers to the cake to the inbetween cake/presents games.  I want them to have exactly what I had, to be exactly as spoiled as I was.

Then a few select words of celebration from my wonderful friends, and the text messages and phone calls I got from people who I know are normally incredibly busy brings a great warmth to my heart.  I'm not forgotten and something as simple as an acknowledgement of my birthing day from people who mean so much to me is more wonderful then any gift I have recieved.

Strange how things chance as you grow older, and how I can change from being a spoiled brat to someone with ideals as simple as mine.  As the 2nd of March rolled to an end, I realized it is possible to be many things.  I could take my life in any amount of direction I choose but as I closed my eyes for bed that night I realized I want nothing of what I wished for as a teenager.

I want a moderate home, a moderate car and even a moderate dog.  Because my happiness lies in the love I share with my beau, and my dedication and love for my friends.  As long as those two staples are within my grasp, then I am satisfied.

It's impossible to clean a keyboard, so I don't bother trying.  I'm sure if you took my keys out you'd find ash, some nail clippings, a dried fried noodle or two and some questionable brown glob that could have been anything from mucus to booger.

No one ever leaves you alone when you need it and I'm too much of a fucking bleeding heart to turn them away.  It's sad when other people's issues seem trivial because you've already been through it once, twice or three times.

"event","So.  The New Year.  Let me begin with a ""Happy New Year"" although we all know the 'happy' part is always debatable.

Back in Kelowna... *stares at the ugly peeling grungy pink wallpaper*  yeah...so back in the dungeon but at least modern science makes it more bearable in the form of a pill.

Where was I...

Right.

New Years Resolutions.
They're a perfectly silly thing.  Who actually manages to keep theirs?  I know I don't.  But that doesn't stop us from actually trying to commit to them, or at least claiming to commit to them.  We all have little faults and habits we'd like to change.  The most common ones are lose weight, get out of debt, stop smoking, etc.  But does a ""new year"" really change all that much?  Not really.

If you were overweight before new years, you're probably still overweight now.  You can vow to exercise more or eat healthier but if you really think about it...did you do it last year?  Wasn't this the resolution last year, and the year before that?  So instead, my resolution is to get more nookie time in with the beau.  Sex is great exercise, burns tons of calories and boosts happiness levels.  Win-win.

Getting out of debt...now see I'm not exactly in debt...not yet.  But when the Playstation 3 makes it debut, my bank account will be cleared and then some more.  Then there's the WoW expansion pack, all those games on my 'to buy' list, the RAM upgrade my lifebook sorely needs and the cost of my excessive habits.  So...if I'm not in debt now, I will be.  The goal?  Not to over extend myself and spend to the last penny.  How will I do this?  I'm locking away my credit cards, that's how!  Cash only and once you're out, no more spending!  Will this work?  *snickers* Probably not, it -is- me we're talking about.  Unlike most girl's, I do not waste my money on shopping for new clothes or new shoes.  Instead, I waste my money on new console systems, new video games, new computer part upgrades and of course, my habits.  So...I suppose the resolution really is - play less video games.  With a serious reduction of gaming playtime, I will reduce the ""need"" to upgrade the systems and/or buy new games.  Sounds good?  Let's hope so...


Stop smoking...
  
*pauses and looks back at what was just typed*

Fuck this shit.

Just have fun this year and try not to fuck things up.

Cheers."

I have never been more relieved in my life to be returning to my sanctuary.

There are times in life when one has to admit defeat.  Not everything can be fought with iron will and brute strength alone.  Not everything can be won singularily by one determined mind.  Sometimes that mind collapses and you are left with nothing.  You end up less then nothing.  You lose everything.

I was never one to admit defeat.  No challenges in life could not be overcome by simple sheer determination.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  Whoever believes in that bullcrap is just kidding themselves.  Sometimes there is no way but to retreat and rebuild your defenses.  I am retreating.  I am rebuilding my walls and learning how to be selfish.

I need to discover a reason to exist that isn't related to someone else.  I am not alive because I owe a debt to someone and for the longest time it has been the only reason pushing me forward.  It is high time I learned to live for myself, to grow for myself.

With that said this journal is going on haitus (again).  I'm dropping everything - yes even school - to get my life together.  This has been ignored for far too long and a solution must be found if my life is to progress any further.  

To all my friends...I love you guys and I miss you guys and everything will be okay, I promise."

"event","Thanksgiving weekend turned out to be a blast.
Wil drove down all the way from Calgary and Jay bussed it up from Vancity.
Then Ken surprised me with an impromptu visit, arriving at nearly 3am saturday morning.

The rest of the weekend was a daze of drunken goodness.  We drank, we smoked pot, we drove all over the bloody place.  It was fun.  Good food, great company, wonderful friends.  It actually made staying at the dorm pleasant and its been so long since I've seen those two and had a chance to just hang out with them together.

Jay hauled down Bleach for me, and I've been watching it non-stop.  Stupid anime!

We had originally planned to drive down to Vancouver for Guu on sunday (and Dee if you're reading this I'm sorry I couldn't return your call!  I think I was too drunk to remember it and when I did it was already monday!).  But we vetoed the idea and stayed in Kelowna instead, where we cooked thanksgiving dinner - which failed horribly hahaha.  But everyone ate hearty and drank lots of wine and got really drunk and there was lot of de-stressing going on I hope.

I won't see them all until Christmas.  *sigh* I'm going to miss them.

*Geek Corner* Oh and Patch 1.8 was disappointing!  Sure moonkin form is a kick but after a while it's just boring.  And the armor bonus really doesn't help since dire bear is still better and you can only cast balance spells in moonkin form.  It's not enough to make me want to play my very first char, my druid Zaryne.  On the other hand she -did- fine a Staff of Jordan 5 mins into the new patch so that was very nice.  My first epic ever!

"event","As the mountains give way to rolling hills, the city emerges nestled in a bosom of golden brilliance.  Recognition floods my mind with memories and fleeting emotions tied to these fluttering images in my head.
I rub my temples, shaking the medicated fog out of my vision as flickering street lamps rush by me, one after another.  The sky has darkened just enough to leave a thin trail of hazy blue streaking across the clouds.  

Red.  Yellow.  Green.

Fast forward.  The familiar scent of freshly cut grass mixed with the sound of heavy Downtown traffic.  The bricks are still a pale beige and peeling, the metal railing is still rusted.  Nothing ever changes.
The cables creak as the elevator rises up, it sways, straining with every floor and stops with a sudden jolt.  The wise step quickly out of this death trap.  The hallway smells like smoke, as it always does.  The walls are the same dull yellow, the carpet the same sickly gray.  The door opens before me and a familiar voice drifts out.

His smiles are for his friends who fall silent as they see my approach.  He turns and even as my eyes rest upon his, I can already sense his thankfulness.  I am in his arms before I have even opened my mouth in greeting.  We collide against the far wall, I am lost in his scent.  Amongst the sounds of laughter and the television blaring loudly, I hear him whisper: thank you.

It's a whirlwind from there on in.  Everything I love about Calgary rushes back to me in a weekend flurry of events.  In the autumn, the days before winter pours its heart out to the city, autumn still sparkles in golden beauty.  It is the small things I miss most.  Early morning dim sum, $3 farmer's sausages at the Crossroads Flea Market, the smell of used books, dusty and dank, a treasure trove of fiction, the fresh smell of peaches and strawberries, just steps away from a bookworm's haven.  Crisp nippy breezes that catch the unwary, shoppers bustling down 17th Ave already buried in thick winter jackets, the smell of coffee wandering through Kensington, the peaceful silence of Princes Island Park, good company over tantilizing drinks, spending an evening with a close friend, laughing in the comfort and safety of friendship.

All these things I miss, and more.  As I leave, the leaves are sagging in the weight of dried leaves.  The wind sends a swirl of earthen pride twirling up from the ground.  The golden hills give way to dense unforgiving rock and stone.  The mountains stand in pride, ragged as they are, dying as they are.  

A brief respite from the norm that spoke volumes more then I had thought possible."

"event","Weird how some conversations just dig out things from the past.
There are some things I thought I got over, I mean I had to, to survive my teenage angst years.  But I guess I wasn't over them as much as I thought I was.

The conversation wasn't even about me, it was about me trying to help a friend, to advise what I believed was the best course of action.  It wasn't anything new, but sometimes people need reminding.

But because of how long we've known each other, some things can't be avoided.  Such as those little petty jealousies I thought I'd gotten rid of, or at least tucked very very far away.  But there they were again, and my bitterness got the better of me and I rambled a bunch of things I probably shouldn't have said at all.

I said a lot of things I shouldn't have said at all.

Lots of feelings I've been hiding paraded out in full force.  

Anyone else would have made me feel the fool.

But he gently reminded me of several things and said words that made me indeed feel the fool, but a happy, relieved fool.  A fool crying tears for something I should have known all along.

And so I thank him, for his gentleness, for his kindness, for knowing me so damned well, even better then I know myself.  For reassuring me that no matter what happens, I will always be a friend to him and that will never change.

I was a foolish girl in the past, and you never once made me feel uncomfortable for the confusion I was experiencing.  It is for that, I thank you most deeply, from the bottom of my heart.

Thank you."

"event","So the doubt that lingered in my mind about where UBC-O stands in comparision to other universities?  Well that's completely disappeared.  After meeting a few new friends, we all decided that, having nothing better to do really, to attend the opening ceremonies of UBC-Okanagan.

Apparently only a handful of other students thought that was a good idea, as the majority were mass media, VIP guests from other universities and lots and lots of politicians.

The premier of British Columbia, Gorden Campbell began the ceremony with a very long talk about the direction UBC-O is heading.  The freaking premier.  I've never even seen Ralph Klein, but I meet Gorden Campbell and freaking <i>shook his hand!</i>  He is such a cheerful fellow, very approachable.

Martha Piper, President and Vice Chancellor of UBC was there as well, naturally as this was the opening ceremony.  The Mayor of Kelowna attended, Walter Gray and he introduced several guests, including Irving Baker, who apparently funded the new floor to the science building.

Prestigious VIPs included President Euh Yoon Dae of the Korea University, President Monte Cassim of the Asia Pacific University Japan, President Shih Choon Fong of the National University of Singapore and President Rafael Rangel Sostmann of Tec de Monterrey, Mexico.

Let's just say, before I thought UBC-O would just be a place for UBC to cast off students with less then perfect grades.  But today they informed everyone of the funding going into the UBC-O development programs, and how they intend to bring glory to the UBC-O name by providing the BEST undergraduate study available in Western Canada.  Even better then UBC-Vancouver.  Because UBC Vancouver will now concentrate fully on graduate studies and research.

Well that's just fine by me.  It's the beginning of a legacy, and I'm damn proud to have been there when they unvealed that new school plaque.  How many students can walk into a University and leave, saying they took part in <i>creating it<i>.  

This year is going to be freaking AWESOME!!!"

She's kept me up all night with a page turner that I haven't put down ever since it arrived in the mail that fateful day.

HARRY POTTER FANS BEWARE!  SPOILERS AHEAD!

<lj-cut>

So...Dumbledore DIED.  I can't fucking believe it.  The most powerful wizard of all time, the only one that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is afraid of was killed.  By SEVERUS SNAPE. 

That good for nothing slimey SNAPE needs to die.  A very very horrible death.  I want him killed slowly, while evil men tear out pieces of his flesh and eat them for breakfast while he screams painfully and slowly.  Yes I have a lot of hatred towards a fictional character.

The end of the book just has me plain confused.  Is this the last Harry Potter book?
Because at this stage now, if Rowling were to continue the book, it would have a very adult feel to it.  With Dumbledore's death, there is no more Hogwarts.  With no more Hogwarts there is no more Harry Potter story.

The ending claims that Harry will now go off in search of Snape - who killed Dumbledore and Voldemort - who killed his parents.  

The entire story had me pulling my hair out and the ending was so unsatisfying it better not be her last novel.  I don't care if she starts a brand new series for adults only - I need to know if Harry kills Voldemort.

She just can't do this to her fans and leave it off there!  She can't!

"event","Well with anyone who's been recently reading my blog, they should be aware by now that the basement of my parent's new home in Calgary has been undergoing some major construction to accomidate my rather obnoxious demands to have the largest room in the house with my own private toilet and living room area.

I'm a spoiled brat, I know.  You don't have to tell me, my parents spoil me rotten.

Moving on, the renovators hired for this particular project, chosen by my beloved father did a mediocre job at best.  I probably deserve it, being such a brat and all.  But having paid good money I expected in the least a half ass job.  They put in a half ass job effort, that's for sure.  And then maybe some more, due to my insistent bitching and complaining at top volume everytime I found something to fault.

In the end I accepted their job, even congratulated them on some of the things I was particularily pleased with - like the lighting and super strength ventilation duct in the washroom (for those late night smokes I sneak in without anyone the wiser).  

Then today was the fateful day for the cable guy to come install my internet in the basement.
He arrives, just on time, precisely 1pm.  I love people who are punctual, as I hate waiting, especially for repairmen.  (Yes yes, I'm a bitch.  I already know that.  Moving on.)

After several minutes of scampering around furniture and testing every cable outlet in the basement, he declared to me that no cable would work down here, much less the internet.  There was no cable signal in the wall jacks.  Curious, we took one off the wall to see what was the problem.  Behind the cable jack, none of the lines were plugged in.  Oh they were there, dangling passively inside the wall, looking as forlorn as Christmas Cake after New Years.  The guy who threaded the cable wire hadn't bothered to hook it up to the wall jack - same applies with all the phone jacks as well.  

Incredulously, the cable guy pulled at the cable and shook his head, immediately reconnecting the wire to the jack for me, muttering to himself about half ass jobs to which I giggled profusely.  He had used precisely the same term I had to describe the workmanship of the renovators.  We tried the signal again - to no avail.

In search of the solution, we followed the wiring all the way back to the  the hot water boiler and heating system where the electrical box was also conveniently located.  We found eight cable wires, dangling haphazardly from the ceiling, all unplugged with little to no room left on the actual cable itself to plug into anything. 

In otherwords, there were six absolutely useless cable jacks in the walls and nothing we could do about it.

The rest of the day is sort of a blur.  I yelled a lot.  I screamed a lot.  I demanded to talk to at least two managers.  I got one garantee to fix the problem, and another promise to come take a look at the outlets.  This was only after I threatened to take the whole business to the BBB - Better Business Bureau of Canada.  (Note: I never would have actually taken the trouble, but it's such a wonderful threat it'd be a waste not to use it.)

After much screaming and my very firm insistence that the issue be fixed, both the company that wired my cable and the renovators have promised to come take a look and resolve these issues.

I have decided my being a bitch isn't such a bad thing after all.  If I had been my usual nice, shrug whatever compliant self, none of this would have been solved.  Instead, I took a deep breath and released all my anger in one very sharp directed complaint and voila!  Results!

Which goes to show: being nice doesn't always work.

Went to the B.E.P concert last night.  It kicked major ass.  I don't think I've been that excited in a while, or have I screamed that loud.  My voice is hoarse, I think I sang along with every single song.

Talib Kwali was awesome too.  It was a shame that half the dome didn't care to see him perform.  Only half-hearted applause for one of my new favorite hip hop acts.  Boooo!

Julie Black also opened for them, but her I didn't care for.  Couldn't understand a damned thing she was singing, and her so called ""soulful voice"" was nothing more then a squeak compared to Fergie's soul wrenching vocals.  That woman has got a voice and she's not afraid to use it!

So still stuck here, with no answer and wishing oh-so-desperately that they'll accept at the last min so I can move to Vancouver.  Kelowna sucks ass.

#2:  There's a leak in the roof.  It's a year old house, still in rather mint condition.  The rainstorms Calgary's been having has been a real test to the water drainage system on the roof.  Apparently it's not good enough, because everything is leaking back down the chimney to soak the house in water.  Ewwww.

#3:  Renovations in the basement and my room are going not so well.  Aside from all the measurements being off and the color of my room being wrong - which I bitched at them for a full day before they hastily went out and bought the RIGHT color to repaint the room.  Don't mess with the angry bitch and her room.  Ever.

#4:  I almost fucked up my laptop.  A system restore brought it back into an endurable condition but I was < -- this close -- > to losing everything.  Yes I should stop fucking around with programming I can't understand.  But I can't help it, messing around with computers is fun!

#5:  Canada Day party - nice but I am waaaaaaaaaay too old for this shit.  I'm pretty sure I've said it a million times before.  But running into old friends brought back bad memories.  A pleasant night turned rather sour and now I'm seriously considering taking an excursion outside the city.  For self discovery, for self reconciliation, for looking deep down the self and finding answers that have been ignored for so very very long.

Originally I had no anticipation for tomorrow night whatsoever, but now my inner demon awakens and I feel myself itching to move to the beat that will inevitabily draw me to the party.

I thought I'd left it all behind, I thought I'd shed the skin and manifested a ""good girl"" within my heart that pleased the parents and loved the elders.  But behind the teasing smile, the laughing brown eyes and the sing song voice, something darker brews beneath.

It began with the wisp of a song, pounding into my ears from two houses down.  Then a timely package arrived from across the Pacific, wrapped in gentle tissue paper a leatherbound edition of Ministry of Sound's Annual 2005.  Trembling fingers placed the CD into the stereo...

The rest, as they say, is moot.  The demon awoke and hasn't been placated and pulls mockingly at my consciousness, sending electrical shocks through my body as my senses heighten to a degree of almost eagerness.  My feet itched to explore.

When the living sleep, and the dead rest, the city sleeps and opens up a world of oppertunities.  Then as the sky gives way to early light, my probing begins.  A little breakfast here, a little lunch there, a bit of window shopping here, a quick stop in the new Vespa dealership there.  This city is full of things to do, to see, to explore.  Yet strangely, only a mere three years before, I would not have moved as such.

Now, the demon calmed by a night of ingesting self diagnosed alcoholic cures for ennui, it awaits tomorrow night.  It knows tomorrow night will be its release.  The music, the lights, the pushing and shoving of the crowds.  Even now as I close my eyes I can envision the rebirth of the night...

The red pill or the blue pill?

I guess there still is love, since the idea of living without him makes me tear up all girly like.  But at the same time, the idea of living with him - for the rest of my mortal life - makes me want to lift skirts and run...all the way to Mexico.

Not saying he's pushed us to the next level, just that things inevitably do not stay the same.  So somewhere along the line we have to either go up, or go down.  I don't want to go down, and I don't want to go up.  So that leaves us in limbo, a place I'm not so sure I can keep my wraps about him.

I declined an invitation to go clubbing last night, prefering Outlaw Golf sessions over long lineups in front of some dinky night club.  But he went, with 2 girls.  Hmm.  If I was even a little bit insecure (which I am) I'd be freaking out.  Except I'm not freaking out.  

More, it's pondering whether or not it occured to him to cheat on me, or whether or not he's satisfied with this relationship.  I mean, I strive to be a good girlfriend but everyone knows I've got issue's of my own to deal with that often interfer with my life.  And him being a very large part of my life...well...let's just say I've been neglecting in bed.

So...nothing's really solved.  But he has a house party tonight.  I'll do some observations and see where things go from there.  If I were to lose him, I don't know what I'd do.  Yet at the same time, I'm not sure I have what it takes to keep him either."

"event","When I was out this morning it was only raining.  Now, it's freaking snowing.  And I don't mean those brief, sudden snowfalls.  I mean the roofs around my neighborhood are WHITE.  Blanketed in snow white like it was freaking February or something.  Bah.

So the whole thing with Ken has blown over.  Once I calmed down I realized it really was good of him to show up, despite the whole ignoring the family thing.  I mean, I'm still not comfortable being with his family, much like how he is with mine.  So it's understandable why he was so edgy.  

To make up for my hissy fit, and since it's May, the month of our anniversary (we've been together for...hmm...2 years now) I gave him my anni-gift early.  I brought it up to him yesterday night and he was estatic.  Considering the gift, any sane person would be too.

I got Ken a PSP for our anniversary.  That's right, a Playstation Portable, along with the game Tony Hawk 2 Remixed.  I love watching him open presents.  It brings me such delight to see him happy, like a little boy on Christmas morning.  I spoil him, I know.

But everything is well, and I give Ken one month before I ""borrow"" the PSP from him for my own use.  Muaaaa.  See, I'm a girlfriend with LOTS of ulterior motives.  *evil grin*"

"event","It's Mother's Day and as usual the family gather's under one roof.  There's good food, great company and everyone's having a jolly good time.

Almost everyone.  This year my family decided it would be nice if I would invite the boyfriend around for dinner.  So I asked.  First time, he rejected the invitation.  Second time, he rejected the invitation.  Third time, he grudgingly agreed, after my Mom pestered me to bring him.

Now, he's here, sulking, and quite unhappy.  And I'm three seconds away from pummeling him into the ground, that's how mad I am.

All he's done is complain since his arrival, hasn't even bothered to try and say hi to my various family members, and is being rude - even for him.  If he didn't want to come I don't understand why he agreed to in the first place.  He could have stood firm and refused to come, as he didn't want to to begin with.

But now that he's here, the least he could do is show a little politeness.  Instead he's hiding in my room, passed out on the bed, insistent that he's ""too tired to be here"" and has ""other things to take care of"".  Mainly he's using 'unpacking his luggage' as an excuse for absence, but he's been moved in for a week and could have unpacked any time during then.  

I don't see how one more night could affect him so greatly.  

And I just can't wrap my mind around him being an arrogant little jackass right now, all high up on his pedestal thinking ""i'm here, are you happy?  I came even when I didn't want to, but I'm going to make your life a living hell since I'm here on protest.""  

I won't even begin on how many times I've put up with HIS parents just for the sake of appearance.

I never realized one little dinner could be asking for so much.  So now I'm the unreasonable one.  I'm the one who's ""forcing"" him into things.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Jackass."

"event","I haven't really slept since I came back on Thursday.  Been uber busy every day, up at the crack of dawn and I collapse into bed near 3 am.  Hell I wasn't even this dedicated during the entire freaking school year.  Family obligations keep me busy.

Ken's new apartmen kicks major ass.  It's on 23rd Ave SW, and he's on the penthouse floor so he get this awesome view, clear of any obstructions, of downtown Calgary.  At night it's absolutely gorgeous.  His roommates, Mike and Dave, are also moved in.  Dave bought a massive sectional sofa for $600.  That's quite the deal, but moving it upstairs was hell.  The sofa itself is in two sections, each 8ft long.  At first it wouldn't fit in the elevator, so we tried the back stairs.  That didn't work and Ken ended up getting stuck up against a railing.  Finally Lisa's boytoy Christian showed up and helped Ken take apart the elevator lights so we could shove the massive thing in the elevator.  It would only fit slanted, and we had to get it in there perfectly or the doors wouldn't close.  But after much swearing, sweating, and scratching the hell out of the apartment's new walls, we finally got it in the house.  So now we have two recliners and a sofa bed hidden in the massive sectional.  

Now the only things left to do is to find Ken a futon and some end tables.  I hope he appreciates how much I've spoiled him this time.  I went to Walmart and bought every single thing his home could ever need, then organized it and cleaned up his apartment, and washed out his bathroom.  Hell, even Mike's Mom said Ken's a lucky bastard.

Ya hear that love?  DAMNED lucky bastard."

"event","Last night sup4h r0x0rz.  Seriously.  I haven't had that much fun in a while.  Dinner at the Living Room, which has excellent fondue.  A bit of the yuppie crowd but hey, I'll get there soon enough.  Had a bit of Riesling to go with the black truffle and chedder fondue...yummmmmm....

Hopped over to visit the buds and ended up going clubbing.  It's been so damned long since I've done any <i>clubbing</i> outtings, and I miss it.  The nightlife, the drinking, the toasts to absolutely nothing in particular so that we all could drink some more, etc.

Dave and Dave (heh, it -still- makes me giggle after so long) are heading off to Europe.  *Is Very Jealous!!!*  I hope those two have an absolute blast, which I know they will.  It's almost impossible not to have fun in Europe.  I'm stuck in Calgary, which I don't mind much.  At least I have other people stuck with me.  Both Dan and Han seemed to have changed a lot...for the better I assure you but I was a bit surprised.  The ""group"" is no longer a bunch of kids hanging out.  We've all matured in ways I never noticed before.  And yes, for the guys, it definately was a good thing.

I was just so glad to be out that it wouldn't have mattered where we went.  But everything turned out peachy keen.  Now it's back to...being a bum?  

Job search still produces 0 results and thus 0 interviews.  Must keep looking...the wallet's looking a little bare after it all.  Well, I did treat most at the Living Room and that place will cost you an arm and a leg >.<  Must stop being so generous...can't afford to be so generous.  Bah."

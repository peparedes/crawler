<P>I really do hate the way I feel right now.&nbsp; I went from seeing Chris everyday, multiple times a day.&nbsp; Now I am lucky to see him once a week, maybe for 2-4 hours.&nbsp; He works everyday 6am-5pm at his dad's deli.&nbsp; So, he comes home, eats, watches a lil tv and then goes to bed.&nbsp; I work on Sundays...We barely see eachother.&nbsp; This is devastating to me.&nbsp; He is the only person that completely understands me (outside of the twin and Nikia.)&nbsp; He is the one I go to for advice...sympathy...love.&nbsp; He doesn't even seem to miss me.&nbsp; He doesn't rush home and call me.&nbsp; He doesn't stay up past his bedtime to talk about us or how I am feeling.&nbsp; He didn't invite me to his brother's basketball team.&nbsp; He won't call me tonight after I got upset over not being able to talk to him for more than a minute tonight.&nbsp; So I will probably cry myself to sleep (literally) because I have already been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but can't afford the medication.&nbsp; So, who the fuck cares anyway.&nbsp; I am just alone</P>
<P><EM>And I know I need you, in my life</EM></P>"

Janine had this on her site...it's pretty cool

Ash and I went to her work today...I got two brand new pairs of Adidas running shoes for $30!  Normally it would have been $110..But her 30% discount works on top of discounts.  I am impressed.  My discount gets me nothing!  Well...I'll talk more later, but I wanna go right Dawson's Creek now"

Look, Nikia!  We were meant for each other! lol

I now work at Circuit City...it is a great job...$8/hr.  I worked 17/hrs last week, and 20 this week.  I am a lil tired!  But its ok.  Tomorrow night I am driving into Portand to take my roomie to the airport...she is ditching friday to go back to Alaska.  Pretty nice...Our heater died!  It was steaming horribly, leaking water, and making the worst sound.  The school's boiler had to be shut off monday night...all because our heater wouldn't turn off.  There were guys in our room constantly trying to fix it.  It looks like they forgot to put a pipe in that connected the two main pipes, at the beg. of the year...lol.  Its fixed, now...

Chris and I are great.  He bought me food last night...since I worked til ten and missed dinner.  I got the Incredibles free from work...I wonder if it is good or not.  We will see.  I can't wait for spring break...I am just going to be hangin out at home...Maybe go to treatment w/ash to visit mike...Crocheting my blankie...Seeing my dad...hanging out w/Scott...Seeing Chris...Going to the Gorge...it all sounds good.  But, I also have to write a paper for Psych of Ed.  ERR!"

I started yesterday!  I worked 10am-2pm, I worked 9am-1pm today...and tomorrow I work 7:30am-12:30pm.  I am a lil exausted...I spent Friday night in Gresham w/ashley...I went to see Mike in treatment.  All the recovering alcoholics were hitting on me!  Scary.  For some reason, I just don't feel right.  I am sad...I really don't know why.  It could be a mix of tiredness and loneliness.  I don't see Chris as much as I would like...And people are always around us.  Like at dinner...Our friends always sit by us...I know that is normal..But sometimes we even sit at a different table than normal, and they still follow us!  I really don't want to go to work tomorrow...Because I have to get up really early. I just feel like I could go to bed right now and not wake up until tomorrow night.  
   I love my new roomie...But she annoys me.  She has this guy that she LOVES...But she refuses to tell him.  She is one of those submissive...Let the guy do everything and I won't initiate anything...Type people.  But she insists on talking about him, and how much she thinks/dreams about him.  Just give him a hint!  What if he is waiting for some sort of response...or a sign from her?  She might be wasting possible time with him...But she refuses to call/write/e-mail/visit.  Whatever happens between them, she will not give him a notice or hint or sign.  It is the dumbest thing in the world!!!!  It drives me crazy.  When Chris and I were in 8th grade...I told him I liked him.  Look where we are now?!  We are engaged...On the road to marriage.  And this girl has planned her entire wedding, but won't even let the guy know how she feels.  It drives me nuts!

I just want to crawl into bed and not get up until I want too...But that is not going to happen"

It is a Valentine's thing...So we are decorating cookies for one of the guy's dorm...(chris's dorm!!!) and making cards.  FUN!!!  Except for we haven't got the cookies yet :x  We are going after dinner.  Hopefully it turns out alright.  I am so happy!  I got a few cds...The new Used cd, American Idiot, From Autumn to Ashes...The new Sum41 cd...and Dashboard.  Yay for cds!

I got to hang out with Scott Deford on Saturday night.  He just showed up at my house with Ian!!!  It was fun...I made them both dinner, and then we went to the mall to visit the twin.  Then, Scott took me to his Uncle's with him.  We had a nice long talk about relationships and everything else under the sun....He admitted that he liked me last year.  I always thought of him as a great friend...But never a boyfriend.  I have always had Chris...Now he has Candi.  It was just nice to talk to him.  We both agree that we can talk about anything with each other...Which is nice to have.  He is my best and only guy friend.  He really opens up to me, its crazy.  He's not always goofy and sarcastic.

Tomorrow I am going to interview for a new job.  It's 2 hours a day, 5 days a week...For Young Life in Silverton.  Its like an after school thing...Really cool.  It's paid on salary from next week til the middle of June...The lady said it would be around $600 a month, and $2700 for the whole time.  I hope it all goes well, I really want to work there!  

I got to go out to coffee with my friend Natalie...at our coffee shop. Its Starbuck's affiliated...So it is good.  They sell Starbucks coffee and brew with it...But they use Torani syrups.  It's not quite the same, but I am not too picky when it comes to coffee.  It was nice to sit down and talk.  This Sunday is my 5 year anniversary! I am so excited...Chris and I both work, so we are hanging out on monday...Which is Valentine's Day.  We have reservations somewhere...Chris is surprising me...He told me to dress up!  I am excited.

Life is good...Everyone seems to say that I am too young to be engaged...Then I tell them that we are getting hitched in August of 2007...and they say that is too far away. ERR!  Well, if I am too young to be engaged supposedly, you'd think that they would be happy for a 2 year engagement!!!  We have very good reasons for waiting...That probably don't matter to anyone else but us.  It is the best thing for.  Plus, I only get to be engaged once.  I have my whole life to be married.  I love this new chapter in my relationship.  It's a blessing!
      I just don't feel like I will make a beautiful bride.  I always wonder what people think about when they find out I am engaged...Do they wonder how I could get a 1/2 caret ring?  Do they wonder how I could get a fiance?  Do they think that I'm not worth it?  I dunno..I just see other girls here and I can imagine them all beautiful down the aisle.  I can't picture myself that way.  They are all so elegant and pretty...I just don't know.  Hopefully I will be able to picture myself that way soon.  Nikia!  Don't forget to be here in p-town August 2007...You are one of my bridesmaids!  lol...
      My whole thing now is trying to experience eternal life.  Eternal life is not just something that Christians possess...It's not something that you just inherit after you die.  1 John Ch.1 is very clear that from the moment we are saved, we enter into a relationship with Jesus.  He is eternal life, and therefore we are called to have a relationship with Him NOW, not after we die.  People can possess eternal life, and not experience it.  That is a tragedy.  I don't want that, so I am working on it.  It is really fascinating.  
      My anniversary is coming up on the 13th....5 years.  Wow.  Where does it go?  What do I get him?  He has way more money than I do...He just bought and InFocus projector for his room...So he can watch movies and play x-box on his wall! lol...He is the talk of his dorm.  Its nice, but it was $900!  A waste, if you ask me.  But he deserves it.  Well, if anyone has any suggestions on the present...tell me!

"event","The Proposal:  lol...

Since Chris and I have been together, we have always exchanged gifts on Christmas Eve.  It goes with his families tradition of opening one present together on Christmas Eve.  So, I went over to his house on the 24th...We went to church like we always do, and then we went back to his house.  My parents actually went to church with us (which they never do) so his parents invited them back for cheesecake.  We all gathered in the living room, so Chris and I could open each others presents...and so his family could all open their one present.  I gave Chris his..I got him a stocking, a nice leather braided belt, and Grinch socks.  We were only supposed to spend $20 on each other...But he ruined that.  So, he hands me this flowered box, and I was confused.  Inside there was this pink heart shaped pillow on it with lace and sequins.  It was beautiful, and soft...But I had no idea what it was for!  I was polite, and said thank you...But I was so confused.  He said, ""Well, this is a two-part present.""  Then, there was a pause...and he put the pillow on the ground and asked me to marry him in front of my family and his.  It turns out, that the pillow is a ring bearer pillow and his mom made it for me!  How sweet!  He put a lot of time into it, and he had the people that mattered most to use there.  It is a beautiful ring, and he is a beautiful person!

My roommie comes back from Alaska Monday...I am pickin her up from PDX and then we are going back to school that night.  I can't wait...I miss her a lot, and we have a lot to talk about.  I MISS NIKIA!  She left this morning...And it is sad.  I hope ya get some sleep, Nikey-key!  I have hard classes next semester....We officially start on the 12th.  It is exciting.  I heard from Scott...Turns out he is dating a cocktail waitress at a strip club...She's 20, lol.  I worry about him sometimes...but he is a big boy.  He seems indifferent to me now.  We used to be close, but somehow he couldn't care less now.  I must go...hopefully I will continue to write often!"

Well...Christmas was great.  I AM ENGAGED!!!!  Chris is my fiance...He proposed to me on Christmas Eve.  It feels so wonderful.  The ring is beautiful...and that is all people want to see/talk about it.  It is so much more than that.  It will be 5 years in February...and I just can't wait to be Lindsey Curtis.  He is more than my fiance...He is my best friend.  The ring could've been a piece of wire for all I care.  I am that much closer to spending my life with him...That is really all that matters to me.  (I will talk about how he proposed later if anyone shows an interest)

Now, on to the other parts of my life.  Before I left college, I got a new roommate.  She is from Alaska, and so awesome.  I moved down to her dorm, where we have our own walk-in closet and bathroom.  It is so great!  I am so much happier...I hated my other roommate.

Nikia is back!  Praise God!  I had my first real, deep, honest conversation in four months the other night when we went out to our favorite coffee house.  It was amazing...It wasn't awkward or strained.  She is even more beautiful now than before she left...and she has grown more intelligent and mature.  I thought it couldn't be done!  She always surprises me...I hope we can spend many more nights talking before she leaves.

My friend from college is from a missionary family...so she flew back to Indonesia for the Christmas break.  Please pray for her, because a massive Tsunami has devastated that part of the world.  I pray she will be ok, and her family will make it through.

Life is just so wonderful.  Family life sucks...I feel like I am losing my sister...My dad is not around...My brother is in jail...My sister is a druggie who is about to be addicted...My mom and step-dad are on the verge of divorcing...My mom spends all day and night on the internet talking to strange men...But through all of this turmoil, God has given me peace.  I finally have everything I have ever wanted, and am content with the things I've always hated.  I can breathe knowing that He will make things right.

God Bless!"

I see my RD tomorrow...It is urgent.  I need to leave this place.  I am going insane.  I would quit drinking coffee to get out of this place!  I have a job...It pays $10/hr...15-30 hrs a week.  I am taking care of a lady who has MS...Just cleaning her house, running errands, cooking...Walking her dog...Its all good.  Easy work, the lady is so nice, and I love the checks I get.  Its exactly what I needed...God is faithful.  I just finished my book...I typed up a bunch of my poems, so that I could send them to scholarship places...There are a few that ask for poetry maunscipts.  Hopefully they like it..I have over 300 poems...But I decided to narrow it down to 50.  I might add more, but who knows.

I am just so tired all the time.  I have a high school senior coming to stay w/me tomorrow...its western weekend...Tons of hs students come for the weekend to check out the campus.  It should be interesting.  Oh well...Should be interesting...since my roommate and I aren't talking.  Well...NIKIA!  I love you..ashley sent out your package this week (sorry so late!) you should get it by the middle of next week!

We were color
composed
by staggering through
raw morning silhouettes
rigid passion
cracking the balance
we are blue blossoms
suffering in the evening
wild with secrets
almost empty
dry and dead on the canvas
I cannot shimmer as I am

*

Swirling paradox's
draining in the cup
will you be my enigma
shadowed by the steam
rising in defiance
we are not the center
but the surrounding movement
driving the consumption
lest we be consumed
by the energy
free and impatient
washing away
the inherent pieces
gone astray
fall away with me
to speak this lucidness
into existence

*

Cowering
lonely in the tower
deep cement
cold burning the bone
surrounding my mortal parts
I fear my desperation
will transform me
clinging to the walls
of regression
a moment
where love was taller
and trying
meant something
without having to
silently attach myself
around the glowing planets
circumscribing
the massive fire spheres
gazed upon through 
the bars
and I 
aware of all 
the possibilities
failure
beside
loving
will stay grounded here
until you find me
worthy
of your compassion

*

Keep breathing out
in hope of finding new
ways to suffocate
the edge from my lines
so neatly drawn and colored in
I never thought I'd survive
in spite of my determination
but you
knew I could not
follow through
despite my tenacity
and sheer will 
to slump down
and fill
my empty extremities
with substance
you provided that comfort
aborting 
previous missions
to the black holes
shallowly etched within
I'm no longer waiting for him
to expand my sentimental capacities
when you have 
overflowed them today

*

Hope you found some sort of value in this :)"

"event","This is my new favorite song...Other than that...No good thing is going on!


""The Ground Folds (Acoustic)""
By SENSES FAIL 

Just throw it back, for one more night
On a starlit and moon-struck night.
The ground did fold and eat us both
But all my love, I did devote.

Beneath the rafters the angels sing
Spinning violence and playing with my heart.

(This song) I wrote, for you to see.
And my heart it now breaks
And the blood spilled down your spine

Lost inside another crash
The bones I had, turned into ash.
The world did cry, the night you died
And I am no good at suicide.

Beneath the rafters the angels sing
Spinning violence and playing with my heart.

(This song) I wrote, for you to see.
And my heart it now breaks
And the blood spilled down your spine

And I lost what was mine, and I want what was mine. [x2]

My heart now it always breaks, the blood did drip and I did take,
another wish, another kiss, no more will for me to kill.
We'd run away in our dismay, but please, come back to me."

"event","I ache inside tonight.  Chris and I talked, and I feel horrible.  I hate myself...My looks, my inability to be honest and upfront, my lack of confidence...My impetuous nature...SO I looked to Chris for comfort.  I did a bad thing.

My mom is going to set up a doctors appointment for me back in Portland, so that I can be put on Accutane for my acne.  Seriously, I feel so ugly when I look at myself.  I just keep thinking that I would be so much happier if I got rid of my acne...Shallow, but I never claimed to be an ocean.  I gave up my car to ashley, because she has a stable job and can make the payments.  I am stuck in Salem.  My mom was getting mad at me, because I couldn't find a time between classes to go home and I couldn't find a way to get there without over-burdening her.  So, I was really frustrated.  ERR.  We got off the phone, and my only hope was Chris.  He's a good problem solver, and I was hoping he would drive me back or let me borrow his car.

He called me, and I told him about my conversation with my mom.  He made me feel horrible.  He said, ""Why is acne such a big deal to you?  Who are you trying to impress?""  and I just told him I felt ugly, and wanted to have self-esteem...and that could be partly acheived by getting rid of my acne.  So, he proceeded to tell me that I was being self-centered, selfish, and shallow.  Why couldn't he just tell me something like, ""Honey, you aren't reduced to acne.  You are worth more than your looks.  I think you should focus more on the inner beauty...and the outer will come later.""  I would have responded to that.   But to tell me I am selfish!  It was all I could do not to cry on the phone.  He just made me feel so dumb.  Boys...."

"event","Well, I am now back in my room from a long weekend in Gresham.  I am sick, so I am a lil cranky.  My roommate is in love with American Dreams, and it is on right now.  I have a huge exam tomorrow in American Thought and Culture, which is my hardest class...Its a four credit class.  ERR.  I really need peace and quiet, which I cannot get.  Where do I go?  I want to lay on my bed, and study.  But I cannot.  I went to church tonight, and Chris took me to Taco Bell.  We love each other so much!  We are trying so hard to keep the romance alive, but it is so hard.  We just passed our 4 year 8 month anniversary.  We keep talking about marriage, and he says we will be engaged by Christmas.  So now I ask all the questions...When?  How?  Where?  This is so confusing.  I just cannot even think about anything else.  I just keep thinking, is today the day?  lol...I need to cool down and think about the day and enjoy this point in my life.  I will never be in this stage of my relationship again.  Everyday with Chris is a great day...I just need to remember that.  It is just so hard...I see girls my age getting engaged to guys they've been dating for eight months, or 2 years...I just get jealous.  God give me the strength of patience!

I talked to Nikia this weekend...I miss that girl.  Ashley and I got together and bought stuff for her...Ashley is going to send it out this week.  Hopefully she gets it and is surprised!  I need a new roomate...she:
*Febrezed my coffee pot
*Wakes me up an hour earlier than I need to be up so she can have an hour of snooze time.  She lets her   alarm go off for 20 minutes at a time before hitting the snooze
*Lets her friends sleep in my bed
*Takes naps everyday...For at least 3 hours.  What am I supposed to do? I can't exactly turn on the light
*Eats my food.  I hide it in Chris's room now
*Lets her friends nap in my room
*Listens to latin music
*Hates the smell of coffee
*Criticizes everything about me
*Tells me I need to dress more preppy

I could go on and on and on...But I just seem whiny.  It is so hard to live with someone you cannot stand.  I hate it...I can't get out until the end of the semester...I pray I will last that long!  As of now I have straight a's...Hopefully I can keep it.  I love you all...And I am praying for you!

"event","Huh...Not much.  

College-Still need a loan.  I have been denied twice...But my sis got a PLUS loan from WP.  So, all is good...Come to find out, my school won't accept PLUS loans from Bank of America.  Oh well...They have their own version of the PLUS loan.  I did the prelim stuff over the phone, and they said they would send me the papers if I got it next week...And call me if I didn't get it.  I need it so bad!!! Or no college for Lindsey.

Chris-After a lil fight over the weekend...We are doing great!  I really see myself marrying this guy...And that is the plan.  We are already talking like...""When we get engaged"" and ""When we are married""  Its nice...And I love him so much!

Family-My uncle and cousins were here for a few days from Chicago.  It was fun showing them around, and hanging out.  We went deep sea fishing a few days ago..And everyone was sea sick!!!  Err.  I hated it.  But, my cousins are great.  Tina is going to be a senior in hs, and Chris is a sophomore in college.  It was nice to have them around for awhile...

Work-Work...is work.  But I've been getting more hours, and it doesn't completely suck.  I like working by Ashley, and my job is only for another month.  Then I go to college, and will work at another place already determined.  That is nice...I don't have to worry about getting a job.

Friends-Nikia is great!  We had coffee last night, with Josh who has just arrived in town late Tuesday.  He is such a sweet, intelligent guy.  Nikia is lucky to have him, and of course he is lucky to have her.  It was a great time...We got our room at the Fireside...and we just talked until 1:30-2 in the morning.  Ash had to open this morning, so we left early.  But it was great to see Nikia again, and hang out with her and Josh.  

Yeah...So life is ok.  I just feel bored and tired.  I am so ready to start my life...Not just this phase supposedly depicting reality.  Reality has not set in....But I got the new Taking Back Sunday cd...awesome!"

"event","Nothing exciting is going on...Just that NIKIA is back!  Ah, I missed her so much :).  Janine-if you need a job...call me, comment or send me message on myspace...I know someone who is hiring.  lol...I'm a weirdo.  Chris and I are going to see the Notebook tomorrow...I am kind of excited.  I dunno when I should give him his present...It's a signed drumhead by all the members of Blink 182..But don't tell him!  He is going to flip...I cannot wait.  I'm just trying to find a cool way to give it to him...Instead of throwing it at him and saying, ""here!"".  I may have started WWIII at my work..But oh well.  I told my supervisor what my manager said about her...And she isn't too happy.  She asked me directly, so I told her the truth.  Oh well.  I don't understand why some people are so ""mad at the world"" all the time.  It's so annoying when a person can't find one good thing about life and they bitch about every little thing...WOE IS ME!!!  Those types of people really start to annoy me...And I wish they would just get over it.  Starbucks now has White Mocha Frappes!  I am in love...mmmm.  Big Brother 5 started today..Life is great.  I am just happy to be here...lol.  Anyone wanna bring me down?  Give me your best shot!"

"event","Went to work...Went to Chris's...We were arguing a lil bit.  He has this fascination with my eating habits...And he is disappointed in me for not eating ""real"" meals.  He says I need to eat at least 2 ""meals"" a day or he won't talk to me.  I eat when I am hungry...What is wrong with that?  He is flipping out over nothing.  I just found out my college hates facial piercings...figures.  Why can't I be a christian...and have tattoos, piercings and red hair?  What does it matter?  Does that make me love God any less....Does that mean I am incapable of witnessing to people?  Sometimes I feel my religion (or the people in it) are shallow and it makes me sick...And not all virgins are quick to judge people who aren't virgins...But it seems as if the sexually experienced are really judgemental and somewhat defensive.

"event","I had the best time last night!  I hung out with nikia and trea (a friend from ODS who supposedly has a crush on me, but I am not feeling it!)  He's really cool, and we play guitar together sometimes...We went to the fireside lodge...Which is a 24 hour coffee house.  We took the lil room...And talked about our car stories.  Trea had to leave early, because his good friend who was only in town for a few days had to go back to Arizona. It was sad!  But, he left...And that gave ash and I more time to talk with Nikia...She left at around 3 am this morning to go to SC...Tear!  I miss her already.

We played this game called ""ungame"" for a few hours.  You just go around the circle, taking turns picking a card.  The cars have questions on them...And you answer them.  There are some comment/question cards, where you can ask anyone a question of your own...Or choose to speak on a random topic.  The questions were shallow to deep...Depending on if you picked from stack 1 or 2.  We had so much fun...I didn't want it to end.  I learned so much about nikia, ashley...And even myself.  That may sound cliched...But I don't believe in cliches anymore.  If I feel something, it cannot be jaded or overused.  It's my emotion...my feelings.  It sucked to have her leave...We are so much alike.  She is one of the most beautiful people I will ever meet...I'm jealous of Josh right now!  but I am happy that she is happy right now!

I know what I am missing...Friends.  It is so hard to be a twin. She is my sister and best friend...And that is such a cool thing but so stressful all at once.  I feel like ash judges me is some aspects...From a sister point of view.  But at the same time, I could tell her anything and know that she will is someway understand.  I am so mad at that fact...Why can't I be normal?  And have friends...Not just a twin?  Nikia is my only friend, and that is awesome.  But it would be nice to have a few friends I could hang out with in a group...Sometimes I don't want to be responsible, deep, thoughtful...Intellectual.  Sometimes I want to be crazy and have fun in a big group.  Usually I am lacking self-confidence...So I do better one-on-one.  lol.  Plus nikia is just so forgiving and understanding.  I could tell her everything...And I think I have.

Chris comes home tomorrow.  I'm so excited!  I have missed him so much.  I have to drive ash to work at 9...then go see my older sis...Take her out to lunch..Then be at Chris's house by 12:15..Meet up w/his mom, and go to the airport to see him come home.  Then, I will give him his present (card, beanie baby lion, brownies) and get whatever he got me from the market (he's so cute) and then go to work @3.  Will I make it?  lol...Good question.  I am not sure!  I cannot be late to work, though.  I was already late to work yesterday...Because I just had to go to Starbucks and get a triple venti vanilla latte w/caramel sauce....My manager hates coffee, so he didn't see the significance of it.  lol.  I have so much anxiety..I want it to be tomorrow!

I was really sick today...throwing up and stuff.  I have no idea why!  It sucked, though.  No fun.  I missed my dad's last softball game...he is the assistant coach of a lil league.  Well, I hope he knows how it feels.  Out of my 4 years of track...He came to 5 meets.  I am in no mood to feel bad for not being there...Because I could think of a million ways he disappointed me...."

College is making my crazy.  Last night my adviser came over...All Freshmen at Western Baptist have a college advisor...And the person teaches a class called Freshmen Seminar...Every Freshmen is required to take it.  The class is made up of between 10-14 people that live around your area...And the class meets once a week to make sure you're adjusting to the college life, to have fun/meet people...And to answer questions.  SO, that guy...Mr. Nelson...Came to meet me and schedule my classes.  He showed me a list of people in the group...but I don't know any of them...They are from Gresham, Clackamas and Boring.  It sucks....I'm not in Chris's group because I live in Gresham. ERR.  My class schedule is full of thinking classes...I only got one elective, and that is a required ""human performance"" class which is a phrase used to describe PE.  I have circuit training.  My schedule this fall looks like this:

Intro to Education (Mon, Wed, Fri @ 8am)
Biblical Literature 1  (Mon, Wed, Fri @ 9am)
Freshman seminar (Thurs @ 10 am)
College Writing 1 (Mon, Wed, Fri @ 11am)
Bible Study Methods  (Tues, Thurs @ 2pm)
American Thought and Culture  (Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri @ 3pm)
Circuit Training  (Tues, Thurs @ 8 am)

All of these are required...Biblical Literature 1 and Bible Study Methods are apart of my Biblical Education Requirements....American Thought and Culture, Freshman seminar and College Writing 1 are apart of my Humanities and Social Sciences Requirments....Intro to Education is apart of my actual major (Language Arts Education) and finally Circuit Training is apart of my Human Performance Requirements.  My Major requires a minimum of 128 hours...Which is roughly 16 hours per semester.  We can only take 17 without paying extra...I'm taking 17 this upcoming fall.  I'm overwhelmed.

I saw Say Anything today...Its such an awesome movie...My new favorite.  It made me think of Chris...All the way in Mexico.  He left last sunday, and will get back this tuesday.  A whole 10 days away from me...It hurts to be so far away.  He called me 3 times...2 of which I missed.  But I did get to talk to him.  I am going to see ashley at work..then go to work...Since we both work in mall 205....I need to be there at 3...But I need to deposit my checks. ERR!!!"

So, they asked her back this year...As a counselor person.  She is gone until Saturday :(  I'm upset.  Chris is leaving me this Saturday....He's going on a mission trip to Mexico...He will be gone for 10 days.  What will I do without him?  Worked was tiring and boring.  I was told that I cannot wear my septum down...Even though I had permission by my owner to wear it.  My supervisor hates me, I know it.  We'll see what happens next time I work.

I really wanted to go to the Rose Festival...But today is the last day.  What am I going to do tomorrow?  Chris wants to see me...hmm.  I have no idea what to do.  Any ideas?"

"event","I went to a Marine recruiter today!  Yay!  It was actually very informative...I love everything about it except for boot camp and possible deployment to Iraq.  I want to start a family very soon...And get engaged to Chris.  (We made up).  This would not happen if I joined.  I love the idea of being elite, and having any job I want...And the sense of pride and belonging.  But I just can't see myself following orders...Such as where I would live and when I would see my family and Chris.  Those are things that I want to have complete control over.  It's sad...because it is such a great opportunity.  Tear!
  
Ash and I got cell phones today.  My mom's work has a partnership w/AT&T...We got a one-year plan...I got a samsung x426 flip phone...Really cute and only $30, with my mom's discount.  No activation fee or deposit...YAY!!!  If ash and I had done it ourselves, our deposit would've been $400!  But mom put it in her name, and we will pay the payments.  Ash got some nokia camera phone...it was $50 after all said and done.  We saved so much money!  I love my mom!  We also get 20% taken off our monthly bills per month for the discount.  I am so happy.  I got wireless internet and text messaging.  And ash and I can talk for free!  Same w/people who have at&t.  It is so small, and cute.  I love it!

Nothing else is new.  I wanted to see Chris today...Oh well.  We are reading Dr. Phil's ""Self-Matters"" now.  He finally let me buy it for him.  We've decided that we need to start being ourselves.  Since it has been 4 years...It seems as if we have lost ourselves within each other.  We have changed into to ideal..The picture we each had of what we thought the other one wanted in a bf/gf.  Crazy!  I became what I thought he wanted, because I was too insecure to just be myself.  Now, we have to change that.  He has been so much more understanding.  He doesn't say his opinion at the moment...So that I can form my own.  I usually just went with what he thought on everything.  God, I was so immature!  Hopefully this book will help us realize the true ""us"".  Its so awesome...I love that book!  I recommend it for anyone!  Bye bye...

"event","So, when I finally came home from the all-night party...I felt so sick.  It was 5am...And I had an hour and a half before I had to hit the road back to ODS.  SO, I took a shower, drank some coffee and felt sick.  It was interesting.  Then, ash and I went back to ODS.  It was breakfast when we got there...And I found out that during field that my girls won the tug-o-fun in my name!  My cabin has never won it all..Especially against the guys! I so proud!  I am upset, though..I missed it.  I worked hard the rest of the day...Packing everything and such.  It was bittersweet leaving...And then I went home, took a shower...Then went to work!  I stayed up for 45 consecutive hours...I'm proud.  But I was so cranky.

I am in such a weird mood.  Chris and I are fighting.  I wanted to read Dr. Phil's book, ""Self Matters.""  We've established that he treats me badly sometimes because he is cynical, and has no real reason to feel good.  He hates himself.  So, I know that book deals with that.  I offered to read it with him, and do the workbook together.  We always complain that we spend no quality time together, and I wanted to fix that.  I'm an eternal optimist.  Incidentally, I bought one copy, and asked him when he wanted to read it.  He complained he didn't have the book (duh) so I suggested that I he should have a copy, too.  Then, we could read the chapters separately, and talk about it together on the phone or in person.  I offered to buy it for him...Then he said I was too poor...Then I told him I have $600 in the bank...And he said, ""well thats nothing.  I have $5,800""  I was so mad.  I told him that I hate it how he always holds his money over my head.  He went on to say that I was materialistic for caring!!!! I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  He is the guy who constantly makes fun of my family for being cheap...and such.  This is the guy who turned down a car from his grandma because it wasn't up to his standards.  I couldn't believe he said that to me.  I may be a lot of things...But I know I am not materialistic.  The fact that he went there really hurts.

He was silent the rest of the time.  He wouldn't talk to me.  I made open statements to try to have him argue back...But I failed.  Why does he make me feel inferior?  Why do I let him?  ERR.  I get so mad.  Maybe its a small thing, and I am just over-reacting.  But his negativity has changed me.  I find it hard to be positive...I used to have to consciously try to be negative.  Not anymore.  I am changed, and I hate it.

So, I will read ""Self-matters.""  And I will change for myself, with or without him.  He seems to be happy with his money...What am I here for? To be a punching bag...Dumping ground...The person he tests his masculinity against.  I will always be found wanting.

If you had the chance to go back, and talk to your first real bf/gf about what went wrong...And get closure...Would you? I would, and I am tomorrow.  But what do I say?  I am scared.  This is my chance to make peace with a part of myself, and I cannot even articulate the emotions.  I feel dumb.  I wish I could think like I write.  I don't.  I write it down, leave it alone...forget about the words I passionately display. I'm just a deep phony.  And life sucks right now. I love Dashboard Confessional...They express what I feel...They write what I think

Vindicated
I am selfish
I am wrong
I am right
I swear I'm right
swear I knew it all along
And I am flawed
But I am cleaning up so well
I am seeing in me now
the things you swear you saw yourself"

"event","My life has been a lil crazy lately....Starting on Wednesday.  I went to ODS.  All of my friends from past weeks were there...And it is always awesome to be out on a week w/ash.  So, on Animals...We had to go on a hike to get ready for field study that day.  We did the normal hike, then strech (my field instructor) felt the need to try and find the hidden waterfall.  So we went on this huge uphill battle between us and nature...no trail, just forest.  We ended up above the camp...which was so cool and neat but tiring.  Then, we kept going.  We felt that there was no point going back down the way we came.  So, we ended up is a field of wheat!  We hiked through it (it was up to my hips) and finally we ended up on a road.  It led back to camp, but it was a two mile up/down road.  I was dead by the time we got back...Then, the kids came!  I got put in a cabin w/Cookie.  We never liked each other before, but we became really close within the first hour together.  My girls were great...All friendly, and respectful.  Then somehow Thursday came along...And I had two blocks of field study.  Which meant 2 more hikes.  I hurt!  One of the groups were terrible!  Oh well.  Then I left during the best part-Field day.  So, in order to go to graduation...I had to miss field day, my social hour, nightly meeting and name-tag decorating!  ERRR!  But I had to go.  

I went home, took a shower...And got ready for graduation.  It was awesome.  Ash and I drove ourselves...I cried when Ms. Yutes wanted to be the one to put my honor cord on!  I saw all of my favorite teachers...With the exception of Mr. Bailey.  It was just a nice time, I felt pretty and I had fun.  At first I was sad, because my dad wasn't there.  I wouldn't have forgiven him if he missed it...But he showed up late.  At the end of it all, I felt confused.  It went by quickly, and I missed a lot of the experience because really dumb people kept yelling and screaming...So I could not hear.  Oh well.  Afterward, Chris wanted me to come over.  I couldn't!  My dad took ash and I to Denny's...I got cheesecake.  Then the madness began..

We rushed home, changed...And I couldn't find my all night party ticket!  I about died.  But I found it, and we were late.  But they let us in...Chris's mommy was one of the ticket people!  I watched Chris play basketball...He gave me a card from his Grandma.  I love that lady!  She gave me a $200 check..I about died.  Then I went to hang out w/ash.  I rode the bull, and got kicked off it quickly.  I beat Scott in the velcro relay...And kind of fought with Chris.  He says I do not have fun with him, and that I only have fun around my friends.  Not true!  He was just being cynical that night, and didn't want to do anything..He would only watch.  Its way more fun to do things w/others then alone.  He doesn't get that.  We made up for bingo.  I won salami/cheese, and a workout suit I will never wear.  I also won the first season of In Living Color...Which I have no idea what it is.  Some comedy.  At the end, there was a raffle...And I won a cd player.  Well, this guy by me won a printer...And I asked him if he wanted to trade,  he said YES!   So I took it and ran, afraid he would change his mind!  It was surreal...To say goodbye to some of those people.  Especially Moser, we go way back.  Hopefully we will really hang out like we say we will.  I had to get Billy's number...he is one of the most respectable guys I have ever met.  And his girlfriend is so sweet.  All in all it was great...I will continue the NO SLEEP saga later...There is more..But I will give you all a chance to read this first."

"event","I just got back from hanging out with my granny...She was convinced that ash and I needed a graduation present..Since we will be the first to in my family.  SO, I did not fight it.  She bought me a cute bathing suit (for the all-night party) and Care bear bedding...It's so cute!  I can't wait to take it to college.  It's nice to have a grandma who takes me out and buys me stuff...I am not used to it at all!  I don't work today...I did yesterday.  I am so happy to have the day off.  I don't work tomorrow, either.  But the rest of this week is so crazy!  On Wednesday ash and I leave for Field Science Experience...A short version of ODS.  Then, we come back after field study on Thursday...so we can go to graduation.  We will then go to the all-night party...And then Friday morning we go back to ODS for the last day.  We get back at around 4 that evening...And I work from 6-close.  YAY!  I am going to be so tired by the time I'm done...Because I have to stay til 4:30 am at the all-night party.  Wow.  I dunno how its going to work.  I wanted to see Chris today...But Luke took him to go skating.  ERR.  Maybe I'll see him tomorrow...But I might be busy.  I wish I had friends...Cool, deep ones that like to go with me late at night to 24/7 coffee houses with music and just talk deeply about anything.  The closest friend I have like that is Scott...And Chris hates Scott...What is a girl to do?"

 I have to study for my math test, and on wednesday is my college bio test, government test...And all of my lesson plans are due in teaching for tomorrow.  I have to write 5 lessons that blend together on character education...Each one 2 hours worth of material.  Oh well...All in itip format!  Mr. Bailey is really preparing me for college, since I am going to major in education.  yay.  I haven't seen/talked to my dad in 3 weeks!  Typical.  He lives with his new girlfriend...So I am not surprised.  I need to get a hold of him, so I can give him graduations tickets.  I will be (along w/ash) the first to graduate hs out of the fam.  Currently, I am 51/644.  Not too bad.  I have 2 b's right now...But I am trying so hard to fix that.  I'm just overwhelmed...ERR! I just want to crawl in bed and sleep...."

"event","There is no excuse for not writing for awhile...lol.  I started working at the diner on Wednesday...I had training.  It was awesome! The store does not officially open until today...So wednesday I got to play around on the registers, make milk shakes and clean.  On thursday...I had to work 4-8, as well as friday.  Thursday was awesome, but tiring.  I went to school, then to OPB (a mentoring program I do on thursday @ Lincoln Park) and then straight to work!  Man, I was so tired.  But the day went by quickly.  All we did was make food, and hang out.  My co-workers are so nice.  There is this guy named Bundy...Who is so tight!  He breakes out into song at random times.  It is so cool...Everyone is just so nice.  The food is awesome.  We have huge burgers, milk shakes, pie and onion rings.  I love it!  It also a lot easier then KFC.  Instead of doing a million things at once...All I have to do is take the orders and make the milkshakes/sundaes if someone orders them.  

Friday was also really crazy.  I went to school, went straight to work, and then went to Nikey-keys party!  Work was good...We actually opened for a lil bit.  I sliced my finger open though!  It would not stop bleeding.  It hurts, too.  Then when we went to Nikey-keys party...I had so much fun!  More then I have had in a long time.  I have a weird feeling...That I would not have had as much fun if Chris was there...That sounds so terrible.  But I do not feel I would have been as outgoing, hyper and crazy if he was there.  He does not bring out that part of my personality...So he would not understand the sudden change...Maybe I would not have even shown that side if he was there...He seems to suppress apart of me.  That makes me sad to realize.  I love him so much, but sometimes I wonder what I'm doing.  All I have to say is that it was nice to unwind.  

Scott professed his dying love for Ashley...Again!  Poor boy cannot get over her.  huh.  I am his friend...And I just do not know how to help him.  We are supposed to hang out on Sunday...We will see.  Rachel was there!  And as innocent as ever, lol.  She is so cool.  We get along really well.  Phil, OMG!  Nikey-key knows what I'm talking about.  He is so funny, and actually is a nice guy.  We left the party early, because Chris A. had to be home by 12 and we all wanted to go to Sharis.  Phil went, too.  It was great.  I got home at about 1:30...The first time I have exercised my right to stay out late because I'm 18.  It felt so nice! Freedom!  Everything has just been so crazy....I was supposed to work for my uncle this morning...Like I do every saturday.  But, I usually work 10-4, and Its in Lake Oswego.  The thing is, I work at the Diner from 3-close.  So, I called in and said I was not going in to my uncles today.  I needed some sleep...I have been running around like crazy lately!  Plus today is the official grand opening...And everyone works today at the diner.  I'm a lil excited and a lil scared.  What if it is extremely busy and I freak out? lol.  We'll see.  Uh.  I want a vacation! No more running around, no more homework, no more work of any kind, and most of all no more emotions.  It seems like I have lived all of them , and I cannot take it any more!!!"

Now I get to work close to Ashley. I got a kitty today!  Her name is espresso...Spressy for short.  lol...She is all black, and full of crazy energy.  I love her already.  Maybe I'll post some pics of her later...Chris and I were fighting so much yesterday.  Nikey-key knows this.  Well, I almost broke up with him.  We have had issues...He doesn't always treat me right.  So every few weeks we have this falling out.  He is extremely cynical, and can be really negative and cruel.  I made him a chick (with puff balls and lil eyes) in honor of spring.  Actually, it was the weekly craft at OPB (a volunteer thing I do once a week at Lincoln Park.)  Well, I thought he would just love it!  When I gave it to him, he wouldn't accept it. He said that he would just throw it away if he kept it, because he said it was ugly.  It upset me..And he said I was 'too emotional.'  That hurt my feelings.  So, at lunch I was overly cynical and rude...to prove a point.  I wanted him to feel how he makes me feel, which is completely immature.  Oh well.  He then ignored me between classes.  We were supposed to hang out last night...But he wasn't at my car after school.  A normal person would go home...I went to his house and waited until he came home! Psycho!  I know, I know.  I wasn't going to let him ruin my weekend by feeling ignored.  So, Luke dropped him off and tried to hang out with him, but I took him away to Starbucks where we could talk.  Ugh.  He said that he finally feels like he wants to change...Which is a step.  Usually I try to make him be nicer when he doesn't want to be.  Hopefully it works out now!  lol.  I'm leaving to go pick him up now..We're going out to eat.  bye!"

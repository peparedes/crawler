"event","You know I should really teach my roommates how to use this site so I'm not the only one updating it. Kinda boring to hear the house perspective from just one person. I'll try to remedy that soon!

Anyway, today is the BIG FOOTBALL GAME!!!! Its the big one because its the first of the season. HOW EXCITED AM I?!? It starts at 6 and we're going to be drinking on the front porch with PEG, Rachel's kick ass mom, and Terry, Josh's dad!!!!!! Its going to be an extremely good time. 

Last night we had a pregame party at the house. Talk about lots of alcohol! The funny part is I started the night in a bad mood, and since I was drinking it overexagerated my bad mood!! I yelled at Cooper, which to me was so fucking funny because Cooper's an ass, he knows this, and I'm like one of the only people who likes to stand up to him. It was funny though because I was banging on the door yelling fuck at him and shit like that, and then when they finally let me in I yelled at him a bit more. Then when I calmed down we wanted to pretend like we were going to get in a big fight in the living room, but we kinda forgot about it. Thats the type of people we are!

Then I was stupid and called my dumbass boyfriend and then went over to where he was. BIG MISTAKE!!! Needless to say we aren't together anymore, and I could really give a fuck less. I'm sick of being toyed with. JUST KNOW I TRIED EVERYTHING TO SAVE IT!!! But once again I am single. SO MORE FUN CAN BE HAD BY ME! Don't get me wrong because I love the guy, but he's being a real fucker right now. And I'm not going to repeat a whole Michael thing. I'm smart enough to know not to waste my life mopeing around. Its just stupid. 

Well I'm excited for game day, and I'm not going to let anything ruin it. I'm actually in a really good mood. (Side comment) God I really need to fix my pictures that are falling off my wall I'm just so freaking lazy. I said that because I happened to glance over there. 

Hopefully I'll update more often. I know I always say this but our house is interesting and you guys should hear more about it. Plus its nice to have a record to look back on and laugh our asses off. So have a good one guys and you best be cheering for the MOUNTAINEERS today! Here's the cheer LET'S GO MOUNTAINEERS!!!!

By the way I'm thinking about running up and jumping on Rachel cause she's still asleep...any thoughts about that?!?"

"event","Welp we are here in Morgantown finally. School has started, Fall Fest has past, and its hot as hell up here. The house looks really good. Its a little dirty at the moment, but other then that its nice. 

I'm having a bit of a bad start. The boyfriend, Joe, wants to break up with me. It would be appropriate for what I did, but we both still love each other so much that it seems like its impossible. Hopefully I can save the relationship because lets talk about how tore up I'll be about it. 

Besides that everyone is enjoying themselves up here. We've had a few parties. Brett's party was extremely fun! Hopefully the rest of the year will be just as kick ass. 

Well the rest of the house is around here doing something. O'Neal and Rachel are watching Kill Bill Vol. 2, and Josh and Treen are still in class. We'll I'm going to go think about what to say to Joe before he gets here. Wish me luck guys!"

"event","So, its August 1st and this is the first night that all five residents have been in the house. Thats right its: Treen, Arbaugh, Moss, O'Neal, and me Ben. Its really funny that I'm the only one who can't be called by the last name. 

We are all here, besides Rachel because she's upstairs doing homework. Of course we are all drinking. Ha ha ha. Anyway, we are playing my game ""Crack the Case."" Its a game where the MC, me because I know all the cases, where two teams have to solve a case. Its really funny beacause they are taking forever to solve the cases I am giving them. Right now they have only solved one, and its cracking me up. 

Well guys we are having a good Morgantown night. It kinda sucks that this is our first Entry. Check back for more exciting updates. Ben."

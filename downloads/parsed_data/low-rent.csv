"event","When she left it tore me apart but I think I did okay. I grieved, I drank, I cried, I passed out on my feet and face planted, but I still think I did ok. I had to fall out of love with her as she had done with me. Now I love her - she is my friend, a great friend. When she left, when she told me it was over, she asked what I wanted to do. I told her I wanted one last night of hugs, kisses and making love. And it was the right thing to do - the perfect way to say goodbye to someone who has forever influenced and changed me. The girl who held my hand through cancer for christs sake! It was the BEST USE OF LIFE and I have NO REGRETS. And I get to keep a beautiful friend.


But now Im confused. There is someone I was trying not to think about too much. So beautiful, so amazing. I didnt think I was good enough for her, didnt think I could risk hurting her. Kept her at a distance. But then it turns out she was feeling the same things I was. We both UNDERSTOOD. We could understand each other traumas, the break ups we have gone through, the illnesses that plague us both. Her rule # 1 is that she IS NOT ready for a relationship. Its a fling, I guess - but Im confused. The first time we kissed I was stunned. It was so fucken electric, the energy and emotion buzzed around me the whole time; danced past, over and through us. That look in her eyes, christ that look she gives me when I stare into her deep, dark eyes, when she knows we are going to kiss. I feel sparks whenever I'm around her. I don't know what that means. Its affection, its emotion, its lust, its unknown. So do I hold back my emotions to not be so damaged when she ends the 'fling'? NO. I didnt live through cancer just to be afraid. I will allow myself to feel for her. What we have, whether for a day or a year is special - this I know. I'm not going to damage the journey by holding back. Fuck fear, fuck low self esteem. Whenever she ends it I want to have no regrets. And I know with a cancer-gifted-clarity that just letting go and falling free is the best choice, the only choice that is honest to me and my life. I AM NOT AFRAID OF FEELING FOR HER."

"event","One day I feel strong, unstoppable. The tattoo on my arm reminds me I can survive anything.

But the next? - its hard work. Being strong makes me tired, makes me weak.

I feel so deeply alone. And even those whose company I'd like I must avoid because of the damage I'd cause. Warned off one girl because everyone can see I am trauma waiting to happen. Avoiding another girl because the likes of me could never be tolerated by her. Not calling an amazing soul I'd really like to because I just want fun and company and I fear her hurting heart and the damage I could cause it.

I don't want to be alone but it quiet clearly appears I cannot be with someone."

"event","I tried to call in sick but they're already two people down. One more would be impossible. But I dont have to be in til five now. So Ill throw these drinks down as fast as I can; to get to bed; to sleep; to wake up; to work. Life.

Having cancer, thinking there was a nice clear deadline to life gave clarity. BUT I do remember how desperately it made me want to live.

So I must want something . . . but what?  What is it that made me want to live so much. Doing a lot of paid work, getting out of debt, its a nice feeling but it has no end, no goal. The one thing I do know for a fact that I want doesn't seem like it'll last. Besides your wants cant be based around other people - it makes their leaving even more devastating. So that one I'll simply try to enjoy the time I have.

So what then do I want? The business cant be successful enough to provide it by itself. Work can never do it.

I think its time for me to write about what happened in there. I've been supressing it so much but I think its time to face it.


Im afraid."

"event","I've had to cut back on the drinking again. I dont know when it slipped away. I was working so damn hard, fixing the debt, the bills; finally getting ahead. I was drinking a bit each night for relaxation, for the stress. But then I turned around one day and realised I was back where I started. There really is nothing more to do than pick myself up, wipe off the blood and dirt, look back up at that mountain and take my first step - just climb that fucker again one step at a time. I think I need to cut back my work hours. No amount of money is worth this. 

What do I want? What am I aiming for? What the hell is it all for?

Times with her have been so special recently; my feelings of love for her threatening to burst from my mouth when I lay eyes on her. So how did I end up here again? What the fuck is wrong with me? Why do I destroy everything? Why do I think I'm on top of the world right before I crash and burn?

I don't even know what this entry is for. I don't even know why any of this exists. I just feel so lonely - the worlds blackness is closing in from everywhere."

"event","I cried on the phone to a mate today. He had an offer to good to refuse, a party event of a type I'm yet to experience. And I wanted to, wanted it bad. Don't know when or even if I'll get another chance to experience what it does. But no is still what I said. I cried and I apologised. He understood. He believed me when I told him my head chemistry could not take the chance right now, that I felt this part of my life was essential, that I had to win RIGHT NOW. There's no option to lose here. I have to win this fight. He said he understood and that he'd be there for me if I ever needed his help. I thanked him and cried again."

"event","Its over 40 degrees. I can feel the heat through the floorboards. I can feel the heat in my hungover skull but still the air conditioner sits dormant on the wall. The way electricity prices keep rising it'll be some time until I can afford to run it again. So the sweat rolls lazily down my body, detouring sometimes at scar tissue but soon finding its way to soak into the waist-band of my shorts. The world is on fire. There are literally fires right now in the hills and back home on the coast. But the real fires are out there - in the world. There is no-one to stop the wars. Its tragic days. Its a time in history to hold your loved ones close, to huddle down and be prepared. Its a time to be scared. Last year was bad, I mean real bad, the worst yet. Death, disease, desperation. Even now I glance sideways at the boxing bag and gloves. Even in an inferno of an Australian summer like this and I'm thinking of the anger I could spill. The list of dead friends gets longer. The feeling of alone is constant. Every one of my mates was there for me during the last 'incident'. But still I feel alone. I need to get the poison out of my head. The hate, the loathing, the fear, the paranoia. I want to live."

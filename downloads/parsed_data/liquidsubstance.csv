I sorta forgot about this thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Life has been really random and good and sort of not good for this past while.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who don't know, I'll list some key events&nbsp; which could describe how things are going around here in a nutshell.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Moved out of dads house.&nbsp; Moved in with mom.&nbsp;Had an extended run in with ""a bad crowd""&nbsp; Moved out of moms house.&nbsp; Dropped out of school.&nbsp; &nbsp;Moved in with Michelle. Ceased to run with ""bad crowd"".&nbsp; Had boyfriend for a while.&nbsp; No longer have boyfriend.&nbsp; Currently have job at Wendys.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aunt&nbsp; Mary Lou died of ALS(Lou Gerihgs(sp?) disease).&nbsp; Don't want anything to do with mother.&nbsp; Worried about the&nbsp;declining health of grandma.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incredibly unsatisfied with how life is going for me in general at the moment...... etc.<br /><br /><br />Don't get me wrong though, I am a lot happier right now in general than probably ever before.&nbsp; Yet, a lot of new and signifigantly more serious worries and problems have come up.&nbsp; It really actually sucks not having parents to rely on...&nbsp; its a kick in the ass when you realize, fuck, they really did a lot of shit for me... I have to do all that crap for myself now.&nbsp; But damn if I'm going to give up and go running for help.&nbsp; It's time to show everyone who ever said I couldn't do something or wouldn't amount to anything.&nbsp; The big girl pants are gonna get put on, and all those motherfuckers are going to see that I don't need them.&nbsp; I Will achieve everyhthing I planned for myself, by myself.&nbsp; It might not happen right now, or even next week.&nbsp; It might not even happen in a month.&nbsp; Even so, I will work my ass off to make it happen, because I want it so bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will feel so good, and I'll be like, damn right biatches!</font>&nbsp; </font>"

Well I more or less figured he wouldn't be able to manage that much, which is why B and I were going to the mall tommorow. Except the whole part when K called me and asked me to babysit at five. So that leaves me with a very small margin of time to get outfits.  But oh well.  I am over it, starting now.  

On another note, I really couldn't be anymore mad at my dad. Not so much mad, as... I don't know.  But he is making me want to cry and not stop.  Then I want to throw hard things at someones face. Nobody in particular.  I won't go into all that though.  Alright well I am going to go eat rice with water.

The bible is really interesting. Have been reading it a lot lately and hm. Don't know.&nbsp; I think I might change my mind about something, but can I think about changing my mind about something I'm thinking about changing my mind about?&nbsp; Thats the question of the moment here. </FONT></P>

"event","Well, I dropped the bomb on my dad tonight. Considering, he took it relatively well. But just the same, he didn't take it well at all. I don't sleep at night anymore because I'm so stressed. Sara and I talk about it, and that helps me get through a little. Without her I don't know what I would do. This is hard for me, but it was my decision... maybe this <EM>Is </EM>ruining my life..?"

Wanting love really isn't so much to ask I don't think. Some people don't know how lucky they are to really and truly have people who care for them. Its just one of those things that hurt. 


Something... I don't know what. Just many feelings. Hmm. Blah. Sigh. Its nothing that a book and a hot bubble bath won't solve. For the moment anyway. Avoiding things and ignoring them is easier than facing it head on."

<P>Okay so I cannot get the lid off my bird feeder thing.&nbsp; That is sad, cause the birds are probably hungry and I have this huge bag off bird food waiting for them, but I cannot get the freaking lid off.&nbsp; Uh oh well.&nbsp; So Sara and I have been hanging out a lot.

I don't know, but somehow I don't think I should be doing things like this. Chris, I want to talk to you about things, I think I need a guys perspective Blahoasdflkjsajflksd. Oh well I have fun things I have to do today, and I won't let this bother me. Molly and I rode bikes BRIEFLY today which was so fun. I love bike riding. Okay I have to go take a shower because yeah I just do. Time's a wasting. Love, Jennifer <3"

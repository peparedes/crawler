Bakura's POV:

     My head hit the tub hard and I felt a warm liquid against my skin. My aibou's feeble attempt to get up was the last thing I remembered before darkness overtook me.

     I was back in my soul room; but this situation never occurred before, so I had no idea if it was normal or not. The strange thing was that I was only there in thought. My manifestation of a body was still out there, vulnerable to anything and everything. Then I got an idea.

     Why not possess Ryou's body, make sure my own 'body' is okay, then....no, wait. Where would Ryou go? Back to his soul room? And was it even possible for me to be there when I was already out there? I shook my head in confusion.

     'Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to try.' I went to the door and pulled on the handle, but it didn't budge. I pulled harder and still no luck. Was I locked in my own soul room?! For the first time in several millennia, I felt my heart pounding.

     'Why the hell won't this stupid thing open?! Open, damnit!' I pushed with my feet on the wall to help me pull the door open. I only succeeded in pulling the handle off, which left me sprawled on the ground. I got up and began banging on the door.

     ""Let me outta here, you stupid piece of --!""

     ""Tsk, tsk, Bakura. You of all people should know that violence is not always the answer.""

     It was that voice from before, but instead of talking inside my head, it was coming from the darkest corner in the room. 

     ""Who are you?! Why are you here?! You're not supposed to be here!"" I screamed, partly in fright and mostly in anger.

     A figure stepped out into the light. Sure enough, it was a woman, but her face was left shrouded in the shadows. She was wearing a flowing white gown. Matching it was snowy white hair that festooned down her shoulders and a pair of pure white wings that were kept tucked close to her body. To simply put it, she looked like an angel in one of Ryou's old picture books, minus the glowing halo and harp.

     My eyes widened at the sight. Then realization struck. She couldn't possibly be here for me, could she? I mean, it was just a small hit on the head, nothing serious. Ryou's been through much worse and survived! And if I were dead, shouldn't a demon or something of the sort be here to greet me? Not an angel! Or maybe it's just in angel guise!

     'This is great...just great.' To my surprise, the angel giggled.

     ""Don't be so pessimistic, Bakura! I'm not here to collect your soul! That's the Grim Reaper's job!""

     I paled some more. Oddly enough, though, her voice seemed very...familiar, now that I thought about it.

     ""Then what are you here for? To warn me that I'm going to hell if I don't change my ways?"" I said sarcastically.

     ""Well, I guess you could put it in that category..."" she replied slowly.

     ""That's bullshit! I've been alive for longer than you've been dead! I can't die! I'm immortal!"" My outburst didn't even faze her.

     ""Have you ever thought as to why Ryou hasn't even tried to destroy the ring once?"" The angel asked calmly.

     ""That's easy. Because he's aware what I'll do to him if he so much as thinks about doing that."" I replied smugly.

     ""Are you sure that's why?"" she inquired further.

     ""Jeez, it's not like I can read his mind!"" I wanted to change the subject. It was making me feel uneasy.

     ""Actually..."" she started.

     ""Alright! Fine! I can read the weakling's mind! Well, sort of. I can read his emotions, but that's all!What does this have to do with anything?!"" I admitted.

     ""So then, why do you think Ryou hasn't already destroyed it?"" she asked placidly.

     ""That's because, uh..."" She was right. This would have to be the perfect chance for Ryou to get rid of the ring. I couldn't even get out of my soul room!

     ""Exactly. Is that what a weakling would do?"" It was her turn to be smug.

     ""Maybe, otherwise he's just really dumb..."" I said.

     ""Bakura! That's not very nice!"" she scolded.

     ""Tough, because I'm not nice."" I was really getting annoyed. Who was she to trespass into my soul room and tell me what to do?

     ""Alright, I have to agree with you on that, but lately, I think your mask is slipping."" came her glib reply.

     ""What do you mean, 'my mask is slipping'?"" I asked suspiciously.

     ""For instance, just today, you refrained from beating Ryou when he pulled one up on you with the hidden ramen, and then you didn't hit him for showing fear--"" she began.

     ""It was because of the bump on my head!"" I interjected. ""Hey! How do I know you're not just a figment to my imagination? A result of the bump? I never heard you until today!""

     ""If I'm just a figment, then why are you arguing with me? And also, remember that time from last week? In the morning, when he refused to get you that glass of water because he was in a hurry to get to school? You let that one slide, too."" She continued.

     ""That was early in the morning! I was still half asleep!"" I replied haughtily. ""And how the hell do you know all this anyways?!"" I asked, furious that she had this information.

     ""I have my ways. In fact, I know everything about you, right down to your hidden feelings."" she answered with a smile.

     Hidden feelings? What was she talking about? Then I remembered incident in the bathroom.

     ""You can't mean that! That was just some fluke! Because of the bump!"" I said, appalled at myself for even thinking that she meant that. Now she'd insist it meant something.

     ""Stop trying to deny everything, Bakura. Deep down, you know you want to give up your tough guy act."" she said quietly.

     ""This is not an act! I happen to like my personality, thank you very much!"" I tried to sound offended.

     ""Just because you were given this treatment, doesn't mean that Ryou should receive the same. Times have changed."" the angel reasoned.

     ""Shut up! SHUT UP! You know nothing! How dare you even speak to me with false understanding!"" I screamed at her. She had struck a very sensitive nerve.

     ""Please, Bakura, I'm only trying to help before things get even worse than they are now. Do you actually want Ryou to become like you? To feel like life's not worth living? To become cold to the world? Is that what you really want?"" Her voice became no louder than a whisper.

     ""Because it has already started. If you continue, there will be no turning back. Did you know that Ryou has already considered suicide?"" She waited for my acknowledgement. ""It's true, but do you know why he hasn't, even during such an opportune time? He's taking care of you as we speak. That's how strong hearted and kind my Ryou is. He's helping someone who doesn't appreciate anything."" Her voice was racked with emotion.  

     ""Bakura, do not think that he's weak because his frame is not suited for fighting, or that he shows fear and pain. How many people do you know who take your beatings day after day, and don't even complain? Of course his friends know, but did you know that he tells them not to worry? Yami-Yugi is strong enough to defeat you, and I'm sure Ryou knows that, too."" she finished.

     My head was spinning. I'd already suspected that Ryou was somewhat depressed most of the time, but suicide? And he was helping me even with all his injuries? Wait, wait....Did she just say 'my Ryou'?

     /Bakura, you alright? Yo, Bakura! It's me, Ryou! Can you hear me?/ I jerked my head in surprise. Was that worry I heard in his voice?

     //Yeah, yeah, I hear you.// I spoke back.

     /Are you mad at me or something? Is that why you won't talk?/ 

     //Are you deaf or what?!// I said louder.

     /Bakura! You're seriously scaring me here! Say something! I know you can hear me!/

     Then our link was severed. Again, I was very confused, but then I realized that the angel was probably behind everything.

     ""Is what you said before true?"" I asked her.

     ""Angels never lie."" Was her reply.

     ""Then what do you want me to do? Throw away all my principles and become Ryou's bestfriend?"" I was really getting peeved. Did she honestly think I'd listen to her cheesey speech and turn a new leaf?

     ""That would be nice, but knowing you, highly unlikely. So I would like to make a proposition."" she compromised.

     ""Like what?"" I said impatiently.

     ""If, in two weeks of time, you are still indifferent towards the well being of your hikari, then your greatest wish shall be granted. If you do begin to care, however, then you will have to change your ways or suffer a terrible consequence. Everything that happens is irreversible."" she said gracefully.

     ""Ha, and I accept your challenge!"" How dumb could she get? Like my aibou could ever sway me away from being all powerful! She had a deal!

     ""There are a few rules that you must abide by and you will be given a fair conscience."" The angel snapped her fingers and two small beings appeared beside her. One had ivory smooth skin and beautiful blue eyes, the other had hideous scales and blood red eyes.

     ""This one,"" she pointed to the white creature, ""will act as your 'good' conscience for the time being. It will magnify all of your positive thoughts and feelings. And it,"" she motioned towards the dark entity, ""will be your 'bad' conscience. All negativity will be augmented by this being.""

     ""Hey! You never said this before! What if they brain wash me?!"" I felt ripped off.

     ""I wasn't finished yet. As I was saying, there are rules you have to follow. 1) You cannot do anything to intentionally harm Ryou, physically or mentally, during the two weeks. 2) You must stay with Ryou at all times, even if it means you have to remain in the ring for the whole period. 3) You must speak the truth, but not the entire truth, to whatever questions asked, even your own questions. And 4) You cannot tell anyone about this. Any problems? Do you still want to do it?"" she inquired.

     ""So, I just have to be nice and honest? For two weeks? Hell, I could do that for two months and not break a sweat!"" I boasted.

     ""Is that another wager you want to make?"" she asked.

     ""Uh, no, no, but tell me, this smells really fishy. There has to be another catch, right?"" It couldn't be that easy. Of course there was a catch.

     ""No catch, it's just that you will only think of this meeting as a dream, and nothing more. You will not remember the basis of the 'bet', or the standards I have set. These creatures will stay with you, but their voices will only seem like your own thoughts. I will monitor you and come back in two weeks. If you succeed, then you will be rewarded. If not, you may find it to be even more rewarding than if you had. Now make up your mind, do you want in or out?"" 

     I hesitated for a split second before answering, ""In.""

     I woke up. Where was I? Oh yeah, I was in the living room, on the couch. What was I doing there? I fell and hit my head. Who am I? Oh shit.

     ""Oooooooooooohh...."" I clutched my head in pain.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ryou's POV:

     'He's awake!' I thought as I rushed to the living room. Well, as fast as my knee would let me. There laid a semi-conscious Bakura holding his head.

     ""Bakura! Are you alright?"" I asked.

     ""Ugghhhhh, what? Who're you?"" he asked with his eyes closed, slurring the words together.

     ""Bakura, it's me, Ryou!"" I yelled, panicking. I was tempted to shake him a bit, but thought better of it.

     ""C-could you please stop yelling? It's giving me a headache."" he said.

     'He said please!' I thought, astonished. 

     ""Sorry."" I replied quietly.

     ""Is my name Bakura? And your name is Ryou?"" he asked, rolling the names off his tongue as if they were foreign.

     ""Bakura. It's not a good time to be playing pranks."" I was getting more and more worried by the second.

     ""B-but I'm not joking. I remember hitting my head, and I know that I'm in the living room, but I can't remember you or me, or anything else for that matter."" he said. 

     'Strange.' I thought, because he was so jittery, but it was probably another one of his tricks so I decided to play along.

     ""Alright, I believe you, but right now, we have to check if your wound is healing okay."" I said.

     ""Okay."" he said feebly.

     'He must be trying his best to fool me if he's acting weak, too.' I thought with a slight smile.

     ""Can you sit?"" I asked softly.

     He shrugged. His futile attempt to get up caused me to worry more, if possible. Even if he was pretending to have amnesia, the hit was real and serious.

     ""Here, let me help you."" I said and bent over to help ease him up. He grimaced when I touched his shoulders.

     ""My head hurts."" he said.

     My brows furrowed. Did he just admit to pain? There was still the chance that he was just a really good actor, but somehow, I was beginning to doubt it. Did he actually have amnesia?

     ""Here, let me see."" I said as I gently peeled off the blood stained bandages. I examined the split to find that it was healing fairly well. The skin around it was a reddish hue, and it seemed tender, but wound itself was scabbing up. There was no sign of infection, so I was greatly relieved.

     I started for the bathroom when his voice suddenly stopped me.

     ""Wh-where are you going?""

     ""Just stay here, okay? I have to go get more bandages. I'll be right back."" I replied. 

     ""How come you're walking funny?"" he asked.

     'Let's see if he's faking it. No matter what, I know he'd never take an insult without some sort of retaliation.' I thought.

     ""Oh, some stupid bastard did this to me."" I answered thoughtfully.

     ""...Why?"" he asked naively.

     'Have to admit I didn't see that one coming.' I confessed to myself. 'He must be telling the truth about not remembering, so I can't just tell him he did this to me. Damn it, 'cause then he'd ask why, and I doubt he'd believe me if I told him the truth. I've gotta make something up.'

     ""Heheh, why, you ask? Uh, probably 'cause I was better looking than him or something. Of course, bullies usually don't need a reason."" I tried to cover up my hesitation with a laugh, but it came out sounding nervous. I prayed that he didn't notice.
     ""...did he give you that black-eye, too?"" Came timidly.

     ""Yeah."" I wanted to change the subject. ""But I'm good now, so I'm gonna go get the bandages, 'kay? Don't touch your head."" I headed for the bathroom and took out the kit. I was on my way when I decided to go back for a roll of toilet paper in case his wound started bleeding again. 

     ""Back!"" I announced as I stepped in the room. Bakura almost fell off the couch by surprise. He turned his head to me and my heart wrenched at the sight of his face.

     His eyes, usually filled with wicked mirth, were instead looking vulnerable and scared. Tears threatened to spill down his flushed cheeks. Being the softy that I am, I had to go comfort him.

     ""There, there."" I said as I slowly bent down and smiled at him. I refrained from patting him because it would probably cause some pain.

     Suddenly, his hands shot out and pulled me to him. He was still stronger than me, even without trying. Next thing I knew, his face was buried in my shirt as he began to sob.

     ""Shhhh, shhhhh. It's okay, I'm here. Everything's okay."" I instinctively wrapped my arms around the shaking boy as a calming gesture, careful not to touch his injury. He, on the other hand, was obviously oblivious to the bruise on his forehead, because he practically crushed his face into my chest.

     He started to calm down, quieting down to only a few sniffles and hiccups every so often. We stayed in this position for a little while and I felt guilty that I was enjoying it (even though my knee was screaming at me to get up) while my other was terrified beyond recognition. I reluctantly pulled away from him.

     ""You have to take it easy Bakura. You're in no shape to be doing this sort of thing. Relax. I'll take care of you and I'm sure you'll remember everything soon enough. Now, let me fix up your wound."" I said soothingly.

     ""Okay."" His hands let go of my shirt and I was free to maneuver. I got another roll of bandages from the box and began wrapping his head.

     ""C-could I take a shower, please? Th-there's blood."" he asked.

     ""I'm sorry, but you can't wash your hair yet. You have to let the wound heal otherwise it might start bleeding again."" I told him. ""Is that okay with you?""

     ""Yes."" he said dejectedly. So I tried to cheer him up.

     ""But hey, I can clean up some of the blood and I'll get you some clothes to change into. How's that?"" I asked with my usual warm smile.

     ""Yes, please. And thank you."" he said with a smile of his own, which was a rare sight indeed. It looked odd, and at the same time, like it belonged there all along. I found myself blushing.

     ""Um, lemme get the stuff. I'm gonna be gone for a bit, are you going to be okay?"" I made sure this time.

     ""Yes, I think I'll be okay."" he said, still smiling. I quickly turned away before he saw my reddened face.

     ""Oh, and call me if you need anything else, okay? And I'll wrap your head when I get back.""

     I went upstairs and looked through my clothes, since his were mostly tight and uncomfortable (in my opinion). I found a white T-shirt and some shorts, then I also decided to bring down a blanket because the weather was getting chillier. I made a pit stop at the bathroom to get a damp towel.

     I came back with the items, only to find Bakura gone from his spot. Dropping everything, I went to search for him.

     ""Bakura!"" I hobbled quickly to the stairs. ""Bakura!"" He wasn't in the bathroom. ""Bakura!"" There he was, collapsed on the kitchen floor. I ran to his side and helped him up.

     ""I told you to call me if you needed anything else! Why'd you try and walk?! You could've hurt yourself!"" I admonished.

     He cringed at my harsh tone and my face softened. I sighed.

     ""What's done is done, we can't change that. I'm just happy that you didn't injury yourself. Come on, I have your new clothes and I can wipe some of that blood off of you."" I lead him back to the living room.

     Once there, I picked up the towel from the floor.

     ""Here, I can clean the blood from your neck and back, but we'll have to leave your hair for later."" I lifted his long hair away and began the tedious job of removing the caked on blood from his neck without putting him through more pain than necessary.

     ""Okay, we're done there, now for your back. Ahhhh, could you, you know..."" I gestured.

     ""Sure."" He slowly took it off and I scrubbed lightly at his back. I finished and began to wrap his head.

     ""Hey, are you hungry? Can I get you anything to eat? Or drink?"" I asked after securing the bandages with some medical tape.

     ""Now that you mention it, I am a little thirsty."" he said.

     ""Um, so what would you like? Orange juice, soya bean milk --."" I stopped abruptly when I remembered that he got rid of those, too.

     ""Could I get some orange juice, please?"" he requested.

     ""Eheheh, I forgot that we needed to go grocery shopping. You know me, I'm such a pig. Before I knew it, all the food and stuff disappeared. I'm sorry, but is water okay?"" It wasn't that far from the truth.

     ""Yes, water is fine."" he compromised.

     ""Okay, I'll go get some. You can change if you like and there's a blanket if you get cold."" I motioned to the pile of fabric.

     He nodded his head and I went to get him some water.

     'Should I tell Yugi about this? I mean, he and the others could help out, but they might ask how it happened. Yugi's yami would just laugh at him. I don't think he can handle it now. I'll call Yugi later.' Happy that I resolved the matter, I got a glass from the cupboard and turned on the tap.

     The phone rang once.

     ""I'll get it!"" I said to no one in particular. I forgot that Yugi said he'd call for homework help.

     The second annoying ring came.

     ""I'm coming!"" I filled the glass and tried to walk quickly, but the water spilled over the side. ""Damn it!""

     A third ring was interrupted by a voice.

     ""Hello?""

     'So much for telling him later.' Another sigh escaped my lips as I walked into the living room.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bakura's POV:

     'Why don't I remember anything?' I thought before someone came limping into the room. 

     ""Bakura! Are you alright?"" he asked. He was talking too loud. My head hurt so I closed my eyes.

     ""Ugghhhhh, what? Who're you?"" I asked confused.

     ""Bakura, it's me, Ryou!"" he started yelling. It was making my head throb.

     ""C-could you please stop yelling? It's giving me a headache."" I politely ask. Even if I lost my memory, I could still at least remember my manners.

     ""Sorry."" he appologized sincerely. I immediately felt like forgiving him.

     ""Is my name Bakura? And your name is Ryou?"" I asked uncertainly. For some odd reason, I knew that I could trust this 'Ryou'.

     ""Bakura. It's not a good time to be playing pranks."" the boy said. What did he mean? I honestly didn't know who I was.

     ""B-but I'm not joking. I remember hitting my head, and I know that I'm in the living room, but I can't remember you or me, or anything else for that matter."" I said to him. 

     ""Alright, I believe you, but right now, we have to check if your wound is healing okay."" he said. 

     'Just a second ago he was accusing me of lying and now he's acting all fine and dandy, but I can see right through him. When was I able to do this? I was probably really good at reading people...' His brown eyes broke me off my train of thought.

     ""Okay."" I managed to say. He smiled and I felt a little light headed. What was I feeling?

     'I can't jump to conclusions now. 'Ryou' is just the first person I met and he's affecting my thinking. Yeah, that's it...or was I, am I...? Amnesia really sucks.' I concluded.

     ""Can you sit?"" he asked.

     I couldn't talk to him then, so I just shrugged and tried to get up, but I failed miserably.

     ""Here, let me help you."" he said. I flinched slightly when he touched me. You know that feeling when you sit up to fast? Well, it's not fun when you've just had a concussion.

     ""My head hurts."" I said. My skull felt like it was on fire. 'Ryou' looked confused at my statement.

     ""Here, let me see."" he said before he unwound the bandages from my head. Some of my hair stuck to the bandage making it very painful. He gently prodded a bit and I bit my lip to prevent from crying out. Suddenly he stopped and started walking away. At that moment I felt fear grip my heart. Where was he going? Is he leaving me all alone?

     ""Wh-where are you going?"" I asked, scared of the answer.

     ""Just stay here, okay? I have to go get more bandages. I'll be right back."" he said.

     'Well I feel really dumb. But wait. Why is he limping?' I wondered. 'Might as well ask.'

     ""How come you're walking funny?"" I blurted out.

     'Ryou' seemed to comtemplate a little before saying, ""Oh, some stupid bastard did this to me.""

     'I don't get it. Why would anyone do that to him? He's really nice...'

     ""...Why?"" I sounded like a toddler. He didn't say anything for a while. I wanted to smack myself.

     ""Heheh, why, you ask? Uh, probably 'cause I was better looking than him or something. Of course, bullies usually don't need a reason."" he said nervously. I was getting suspicous. Was he trying to hide something?

     ""...did he give you that black-eye, too?"" I continued.

     ""Yeah."" I could tell he didn't want to talk about it. Fair enough. ""But I'm good now, so I'm gonna go get the bandages, 'kay? Don't touch your head."" he said brusquely and left without another word. 

     'I can't damn do whatever the hell I want. I don't take orders from wusses like you.' a voice inside my head said. My eyes widened. Where did that come from?

     'Did I just think that?! Wait. What if he's not coming back? He looked kinda pissed off. What if he's not coming back? Am I gonna be all alone? Huh? What was that sound? What if he's not coming back?!' I felt tears forming at the corner of my eyes. Before all hope of him ever returning was lost, I heard someone enter the room.

     ""Back!"" someone said.

     I tried to whip my head to see who it was and almost fell off the couch. Relief washed over me when I saw it was just 'Ryou'. But he was just standing there. What was he doing? Before I could do anything, he came up to me and smiled.

     ""There, there."" he said gently.

     'He's so sweet and caring...' I don't know why, but I suddenly felt very desperate.

     I latched myself to his chest and began crying. My forehead hurt like hell, but I ignored it. His arms came up and wrapped around me, and I relaxed. It was so good like this, that I felt guilty. He was probably freaked out that some amnesic guy was hugging him in a death grip. I was kinda sad when he broke the embrace.

     ""You have to take it easy Bakura. You're in no shape to be doing this sort of thing. Relax. I'll take care of you and I'm sure you'll remember everything soon enough. Now, let me fix up your wound."" 'Ryou' reassured me.

     ""Okay."" I said as I released his shirt. He started putting new bandages around my head and that's when I noticed something.

     ""C-could I take a shower, please? Th-there's blood."" I asked timidly.

     ""I'm sorry, but you can't wash your hair yet. you have to let the wound heal otherwise it might start bleeding again. Is that okay with you?"" he said.

     ""Yes."" I said, not trying to hide my disappointment.

     ""But hey,"" he quickly said, ""I can clean up some of the blood and I'll get you some clothes to change into. How's that?"" He smiled again and I had to fight to keep my blush down.

     ""Yes, please. And thank you."" I also smiled. I couldn't help but notice a tinge of pink on his cheeks.

     ""Um, lemme get the stuff. I'm gonna be gone for a bit, are you going to be okay?"" he asked. I didn't want him to go, some things you just can't control.

     ""Yes, I think I'll be okay."" I said and broadened my smile. I almost laughed out loud when I saw him turn around in embarrassment.

     ""Oh, and call me if you need anything else, okay? And I'll wrap your head when I get back."" he added. With that, he left the room.

     'Hmph, he wanted to get away from me so quickly. Che, I hope he falls down the stairs and breaks his neck.' I was shocked again. How come I suddenly became so bitter? My ears were pounding and I began to pull at my hair. Were mood swings a regular after effect of a concusion?

     'He didn't _want_ to leave. I saw it in his eyes!' Huh? I stopped my hysterical antics and decided, on the spur of the moment, to get up and attempt to walk to the kitchen. Funny how it was that I remembered where I was but not anything else.

     I slowly pushed myself off the couch and stood up. I swayed a bit but regained my posture and dragged myself to the kitchen, leaning on the walls several times to stop the dizziness.

     I rested against the kitchen counter when suddenly I heard, ""Bakura! Bakura! Bakura!""

     'Ryou' appeared at my side and helped me up.

     ""I told you to call if you needed anything else! Why'd you try and walk?! You could've hurt yourself!"" he scolded me.

     I grimaced at his reprimand. I didn't do anything wrong, so why was he yelling at me?

     'I'm not a weakling, idiot! Can't you see that I'm perfectly fine?!'

     'He's only trying to help! Look, even when he's injured he ran around looking for you!'

     ""What's done is done, we can't change that. I'm just happy that you didn't injury yourself. Come on, I have your new clothes and I can wipe some of that blood off of you."" I dumbly followed him to the couch. Too much was on my mind to think of anything else.

     ""Here, I can clean the blood from your neck and back, but we'll have to leave your hair for later."" With a towel in hand, he began to clean. It stung whenever he neared my wound.

     'Look at him. He's just trying to get me to trust him. Later, he'll use me and throw me away like garbage. How would I know if he's telling me the truth? It's not like I have anything to go on.'

     'But then again, he's so kind and gentle. If he was really a bad guy, why do all this for me? He could easily say that he needed to be somewhere and leave.'

     'What is going on?! I'm not really thinking this, am I?!' I was arguing with myself when his voice interrupted.

     ""Okay, we're done there, now for your back. Ahhhh, could you, you know..."" 

     ""Sure."" I understood what he meant and took off my shirt.

     'He's already getting ready to do something weird to me. He's got some nerve.'

     'But he's only washing my back.'

     'Ryou' then began to bandage my head after finishing with my back.

     ""Hey, are you hungry? Can I get you something to eat? Or drink?"" he asked. My mouth felt strangely parched.

     ""Now that you mention it, I am a little thirsty."" I said. 

     ""Um, so what would you like? Orange juice, soya bean milk --."" He didn't finish his sentence.

     ""Could I get some orange juice, please?"" I asked.

     ""Eheheh, I forgot that we needed to go grocery shopping. You know me, I'm such a pig. Before I knew it, all the food and stuff disappeared. I'm sorry, but is water okay?"" he said, embarrassed.

     'Pig my ass! I can see right through you, liar!'

     'Water is always good.'

     ""Yes, water is fine."" I had gotten used to the mood swings by now, somewhat.

     ""Okay, I'll go get some. You can change if you like and there's a blanket if you get cold."" He pointed to some stuff on the ground.

     I nodded and he left.

     'How dare he leave my clothes on the dirty ground.'

     'I don't think these are my clothes...'

     I picked up a white shirt with a faded check mark on the top left corner. I pulled it over my head and also changed into some shorts. A strange ringing sound came from a rectangular box with an antenna.

     ""I'll get it!"" I heard 'Ryou' yell. Then it came to me. It was the telephone! Happy I was making progress, I walked towards the phone.

     'No, I'll get it, prick.'

     'It wouldn't hurt...'

     'This is the first time my thoughts didn't contradict...'

     It rang again.

     ""I'm coming! Damnit!""

     Through no will of my own, I reached for the phone. I picked it up on the third ring.

     ""Hello?"" I said.

     ""Who is this?"" Came from the other line.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ryou's POV:

     I came into the room and saw Bakura holding the cordless phone to his ear. My dad liked to have it on max volume because it had horrible reception. If it was just on regular, you could barely hear the other line sometimes.

     ""This is Bakura...I think."" he said. Then I heard the person on the other line.

     ""Tomb Robber?! What are *static* Ryou's your *static* Could you?! *static* Kill you *static* hurt him!"" No doubt that was Yugi's Yami, and it didn't take a genious to figure out what he said, but damn, I hated that phone.

     ""I-I'm sorry, b-but I don't know what you're talking about!"" Was Bakura's frantic reply.

     ""Don't *static* me! I'm coming over right now! *static* No, aibou! *static* Dangerous, you *static* Fine, *static* later, Thief. *click*"" The other line hung up.

     ""B-b-but..."" Bakura said before dropping the phone. It was an old, clunky model, so the antenna broke off and the batteries popped out. I grinned a little, but a small whimper reminded me of the seriousness of the situation. Bakura was having another nervous break down, falling to the ground and trying to gather the pieces of the phone. To top it off,Yugi and his Yami were coming for a hostile visit.

     ""Bakura."" I put the cup of water down before bending over and putting a hand on his shaking shoulders. ""Bakura, look. The phone was a piece of junk. We'll get a new one later. More importantly, are you alright? What did he say to you?""

     ""H-he said that I hurt you and that you were my hikari, or, or something, and, and, and, that he was going to, g-going to --!"" He didn't finish. Instead, he tackled me into a fierce hug.

     I winced as the air swiftly left my lungs from landing on my back. His arms were wrapped around my neck and his legs pinned mine to the ground. I almost cried out when his knee came in contact with my injured one. His other thigh was between my legs and applying slight pressure to a certain part of my anatomy. I blushed and tried to control my myself from ripping his clothes off and just --

     'Where did that come from?! I mean, _he_' I was stressing the 'he', 'is, is...He's Bakura! My yami! Who is sadistically cruel to me! Who wants total world domination! Who's pure evil!' One look in his eyes told me that I was wrong. Maybe he was those things before, but now, he was like an innocent child.

     I brought my arms up and held him closer to me. He whimpered and crushed his face into the curve of my neck, his hair falling lightly to my cheeks.

     ""Don't worry, Bakura. Nobody's gonna hurt you. I promise."" I quietly whispered into his ear. His reply was to loosen his grip on my neck. I stroked his back as a calming gesture.

     I felt his hot breath and tears. He shifted slightly and his thigh rubbed against mine. My body was getting over excited and I prayed to all the gods I could think of to calm my hormones. Bakura certainly didn't help at all because he began placing wet kisses along my jaw line.

     'What is he doing?!' My heart was pounding in my chest. It took all my will power to remain unmoving. I mean, I didn't want to take advantage of him when he was in this condition. Some would probably laugh when they hear this: Ryou taking advantage of Bakura. I would probably look back on this and laugh later on, but right now, it was not funny at all.

     His head moved until he was looking at me straight in the eye. Of course, I was completely disoriented and extremely surprised when he captured my lips with his own.

     The feeling was extraordinary. It was something I'd never experienced before. Sure I'd kissed some girls before, but this was entirely different. I couldn't help but respond. 

     Slowly at first. It was sweet and light, but I gradually deepened the kiss. Soon, we ran out of air and had to pull away from eachother. After a few quick breaths, we were back at it again. I ran my tongue on his lips and he opened to let me enter. It was intoxicating. Our tongues danced together and my hands went from on top of his back to underneath his shirt. His skin was warm and I felt him tremble at my touch.

     Suddenly, his hands roamed down until they were on my waistband. My eyes widened.

     'What are we doing?! This is wrong! All wrong!' I reached down to intercept his hands when I realized that we were both hard. 'Shit! I have to stop this!'

     But I couldn't stop. Not now. It felt too good. Too right. I grabbed his erection and he moaned into my lips. I smiled a little, knowing that I could make Bakura sound like that.

     'Why can't I stop this?! He's ill! I'm a horrible person if I do this to him now!' With that, I released my hold on him and pushed on his chest. He reluctantly ended his kissing, and I was disappointed and relieved at the same time.

     Then the doorbell rang and there was some angry pounding on the front door.

     'I guess Yugi and his yami are here.'

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bakura's POV:

     ""This is Bakura...I think."" I said uncertainly into the receiver. For some strange reason, the volume was up all the way, and when someone from the other line was talking, it was extremely loud. I was thoroughly surprised when the person replied.

      ""Tomb Robber?! What are you doing?! What did you do?! Ryou's your hikari! How could you?! I swear in the Holy name of Ra that I will kill you if you hurt him!"" he snarled.

     ""I-I'm sorry, b-but I don't know what you're talking about!"" I said truthfully. With my amnesia, for all I know this was a daily routine for me and this other guy.

     ""Don't try to fool me! I'm coming over right now!"" Then another voice in the background asked:

     ""Yami! I want to come, too!""

     ""No, aibou! It may become dangerous, you might get hurt.""

     ""But Ya-a-ami! I'm not a child! I can take care of myself! Ryou's my friend!"" A few moments later, the original voice said:

     ""Alright, fine, you can come. We'll be seeing you  later, Thief."" The line went dead.

     'Sheesh, what a jackass! Doesn't even wait for me to say bye.'

     'Oh no! What if I did something wrong?!'

     I dropped the phone while muttering something, and then realized that Ryou was in the room as well. Embarrassed, I hurridly scrambled to pick up the pieces of the broken phone. My head was spinning. What did that person mean when he called me a thief? And a tomb robber? Did I do something before I lost my memory? Was I the one who hurt Ryou?

     The questions stopped coming when I felt a hand on my shoulder.

     ""Bakura, look. The phone was a piece of junk. We'll get a new one later. More importantly, are you alright? What did he say to you?"" Ryou asked, voice full of concern.

     ""H-he said that I hurt you and that you were my hikari, or, or something, and, and, and, that he was going to, g-going to --!"" I couldn't think properly anymore. Strange images appeared in my head and I thought that I was going to pass out. There was a golden ring with an eye in the middle, and one of Ryou lying broken on the floor. Another with a lady in white clothes. Scared, I latched myself onto the nearest person, that being Ryou.

     I crushed him in a hug around the neck and we both fell to the floor. I laid on top of him and noticed that he stiffened considerably. I was about to get off and apologize when he hugged me back.

     'He wants me. What a guy.'

     'Nah, he's probably just trying to comfort me, like anyone else would.'

     ""Don't worry, Bakura. Nobody's gonna hurt you. I promise."" His whisper sent chills down my spine and I relaxed a little. Suddenly, he began to move his hands up and down my back.

     'Like I was thinking earlier, he's just trying to take advantage of me now.'

     'Oh come on! I'm the one who hugged him first! Besides, this is kinda nice...'

     'I think I can kick it up a notch'

     'That idea sounds good...'

     Again, my thoughts agreed with eachother. Following them, I moved a bit so that I was rubbing his thigh. He became rigid, and I could feel growing pressure against my leg. I smirked mentally, somewhat surprised at the action, and began to kiss Ryou's jaw bone. He stiffened again, but that did not deter my intentions.

     I propped myself directly on top of him, so that I could look him face to face. Then I lowered my head and pressed our lips together.

     'Ooohh, I knew he wanted me. He's responding like there's no tomorrow!'

     'Too true, too true...'

     And it was true. Ryou turned the light kiss into a passionate one, and after a while, I had to pull away to get some air. My irregular breathing was halted when he began the process again. This time, he opened his mouth and beckoned for me to do the same by licking my lips. Happy to oblige, I also opened and his tongue explored the inside of my mouth. Finally, I was able to push him out with my own tongue, and we began a war, both sides trying to gain entry.

     His hands snaked under my shirt and damn, were they cold! 

     'Two can play it that way...'

     I made my way to his pants and began tugging on the waistband. He flinched slightly and it seemed like he was trying to stop me, when suddenly he grabbed me instead. I was surprised, but it didn't feel uncomfortable. He squeezed a bit and I let out a groan of pleasure. Then he let go and started pushing me off. Confused, I slowly stopped.

     Ringing and pounding were evident to my ears, and I thought I heard Ryou saying:

     ""I guess Yugi and his yami are here.""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ryou's POV:

     I sighed inwardly and shifted myself out from underneath Bakura. The pounding was so loud that I was afraid the door was going to splinter. My erection was obvious to anyone with sight, so I decided to wait a little before answering the door. It would be very awkward.

     ""Just a minute!"" I called out, which, suprisingly, caused the noise to lessen. I didn't think I could yell that loud.

     I slowly sat up and straightened out my clothes a bit. Bakura was next to me, and he was kind of out of it still. I waved my hand in front of his face to get his attention. His eyes remained glazed over so I snapped my fingers. Still no response. I knew I had to wake him up, since there would be questions concerning his state.

     /YAMI!/ I said mentally. That seemed to do the trick.

     ""Huh? What?!"" he asked, bewildered. His eyes darted all over the place, and he began freaking out like before. Maybe talking through our connection was a bad idea.

     ""Bakura."" I said calmly. No reply, but he gripped at his head.

     'This can't be good...' I thought.

     ""Bakura. It's okay. You're okay. Now, snap out of it. Bakura?"" I tried, apprehension building by the second. I could hear Yugi and his yami arguing outside the door

     ""WHAT THE FUCKIN' HELL?!"" he screamed, then he passed out and fell back to the floor with a thump. I winced a little, considering he landed on his injury.

     ""Damnit, open the door!""

     ""Yami! Stop!""

     ""Wait--!"" I began, but was too late. The door flew off it's hinges and there stood a thoroughly pissed yami and his concerned hikari in the doorway. Luckily, I was no longer hard, and neither was Bakura.

     ""Where is the bastard?!"" Yami Yugi demanded. Yugi cleared his throat and pointed to the unconscious Bakura on the ground.

     ""What happened here?!"" I couldn't find my voice. I'd never seen Yami Yugi so angry. It was quite frightening, actually, because he was glowing.

     ""Yami, calm down!"" Yugi said, and touched his yami's arm. The said akutenshi simmered down, but continued to glare. At what, I'm not too sure.

     ""Sorry, aibou.""

     ""'S okay, Yami. Hey Ryou, what happened?"" Yugi said as he ran over to me.

     ""Well..."" I was hesitant to answer. What would they say if I told them?

     ""He did that to you."" Yami Yugi stated.

     ""What, this?"" I pointed to my black eye, ""It's nothing.""

     ""No, not that. I'm talking about your knee."" he said in his as-a-matter-of-fact tone.

     ""Huh? What are you talking about, Yami?"" Yugi interjected with a perplexed look on his face. I was dumbfounded. How could Yami Yugi tell my knee was hurt?

     ""Ryou. Don't try to protect the poor fool."" he said.

     I sighed. ""Yes, alright. He did it."" I hung my head.

     ""No need to feel shame; it's not your fault. By the way, what did happen to the Thief? What is he doing on the floor?"" Yami Yugi asked, somewhat puzzled.

     ""Well, it's a long story..."" I hesitantly began. The yami looked at me with expectant eyes and Yugi just stood there. I sighed once again and told them about what happened earlier, leaving out some choice scenes.

     ""So now Bakura has amnesia?!"" Yugi exclaimed loudly once I finished. By now, we had already moved Bakura onto the couch and leaned the door back up.

     ""I'm pretty sure he does. Either that or he's a really good actor."" I shrugged.

     ""Strange. Very strange indeed."" Yami Yugi said to himself.

     ""What is it, Yami?"" Yugi asked his other.

     ""To tell the truth, I'm not sure if it's even possible for a dark spirit such as myself to forget everything like that. It should be fairly easy to transfer the memories back to him through your link. Have you tried it yet?"" the yami decided to enlighten us.

     ""Actually, yes, I just did before you came. He was dazed so I tried to talk to him telepathically. I guess it was too much for him and he passed out after he screamed."" I told them.

     ""I've never thought carefully about this subject before, so I don't know if this is what is supposed to be going on. Maybe the reason why this is happening is because of the other two spirits I sense residing in him.""

     ""What?!"" Yugi and I said at the same time.

     ""When I focus, I can feel three minds from the Tomb Robber."" 

     ""Are you trying to say that the blow to the head caused his mind to split three ways?!"" I asked, trying to get a more clear answer.

     ""Possibly. Or possibly he is being inhabited by parasitic spirits that entered him while he was weak. Both sound reasonable to me.""

     ""No! It can't be!"" I yelled.

     ""Take it easy, Ryou. Yami says that those are only possibilities. For all we know he may just have temporary amnesia and will remember everything in a few days."" Yugi tried to calm me down.

     ""Have you went into his soul room yet?"" Yami Yugi spoke up.

     ""Pardon?"" I asked, confused.

     ""Have you been inside his soul room since the incident? It may just be the only way we can figure this out."" he elaborated.

     ""No, I never thought about it."" I replied truthfully. Before, I was strictly forbidden to enter my yami's soul room. Whenever he was in control of my body, I was locked in my own soul room.

     ""We should try it.""

     ""Yami! You should ask if he wants to first!"" Yugi scolded. I chuckled when the yami appeared to cringe at his light's raised voice.

     ""I think it'll be a good idea."" I said.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bakura's POV:

     Suddenly, I was inside a dark room. I freaked out. Where was Ryou? One moment, I was getting up off of Ryou, the next, I was here. Where was here, exactly?

     ""H-hello?"" I said uncertainly. As I said before, the room was dark and I couldn't see into the corners, but I could tell there was someone, or something, in here with me.

     ""Master Bakura."" Two voices echoed from the shadows.

     ""Huh?"" I said, and scanned the room for the source of the voices.

     ""Master Bakura."" This time it was only one voice and the one who spoke walked into the light. ""Please, calm down."" The small creature was pure white with big, sky blue eyes. It stood on two legs and had a long, slender tail that ended at a point. As it moved closer, I could see small, undeveloped wings on its back. I guess it could describe it as a dragon of some sort.

     ""Calm down?! I don't know where I am, how I got here, or why I'm here. Who are you anyways?!"" I said, irritated. I was shocked at how short fused I was with the creature.

     ""Yes, Master. You should not fear. This is just your soul room."" Another creature came out of the darkness, but this one was ebony black, covered in scales. Its tongue flicked at the air and its long tail dragged back and forth on the ground. Again, it was like a dragon. Its eyes glowed a blood red hue and I shuddered at how it hissed as it spoke. 

     ""What the hell is a soul room?! And why do you keep calling me 'Master'?!"" I screamed and held my hands in front of my face for emphasis. The dragon-like beings didn't flinch. They just advanced on me, eyes unblinking.

     ""Huh? What are you doing? Someone get me out of here! Aack!"" I backpedalled to the furthest wall. ""Help!"" Strangely, I heard Ryou's voice:

     /YAMI!/

     ""Huh? What?!"" I found myself sitting on the floor with Ryou hovering over me like an overprotective mother cat. For some reason, I couldn't focus on anything.

     'Ha. He thinks I've gone crazy. Well, have I got news for him. Mwahahahahaha...'

     <Where did that come from?!>

     'He's so sweet, being worried for me and all.'

     <I did NOT just think that!>

     It was different from before. Usually, my thoughts would just contradict, but now, I could hear two distinct voices in my head. Someone calling my name barely registered and I squeezed my temples to stop the coming headache.

     <It's those...those things!> I finally realized. There was a pause before something sighed.

     'I see we have been found. Our lady will not be pleased.'

     'We cannot do anything about it now. Let us just take him in and explain before he puts the boy in danger.'

     Then it was like I was being torn in two. I remember screaming some foul language before I was back in my 'soul room'. The dragon things were still there, but now the ceiling was glowing. I wouldn't've believed it if I didn't see it with my own eyes. Now that I think about it, I was pretty out of it, so I don't even think I can believe my eyes. Anyways, I stood there for a while until there was a beam of light and down floated a beautiful angel.

     ""Tsk tsk tsk, Bakura. I didn't think things would get as muddled up as this. I swear, I leave you alone for a while and this is what happens."" the angel said while rolling her eyes. She flashed me a brilliant smile and cocked her head a bit to the side with her hands to her hips. I could tell she wasn't angry with me by the playful gleam in her eyes.

     ""Um, excuse me, but who are you?"" I asked. I could tell she was very familiar, though I couldn't pinpoint exactly how I knew her. However, her facial shape reminded me slightly of Ryou...and she had the same albino look: pale skin and white hair.

     ""I guess it's even worse than I thought. Iliya, can you explain the situation to me?"" She turned to the white creature and gestured.
     ""Yes, my Lady. The young master has lost his memory."" The one called Iliya said.

     ""Continue."" A somber expression replacing her happy one.

     ""Well, he is also regaining it slowly, but he is getting confused. We, Moins and I, have been carrying out our duty, but the master figured it out and so we called you back.""

     ""I see. Alright then, Bakura. Before I restore your memory, I'd like an honest opinion of Ryou. What do you think of him?"" She pleaded with her eyes.

     <Huh? She can restore my memory?>

     ""Yes, I can. Now, please, answer my question."" She replied to my thought. To my thought?

     <She can read minds?!>

     ""Yes, I can do that also. Ahem."" She cleared her throat.

     ""But then why don't you just read my mind to find out what I think of Ryou?"" I finally asked.

     ""Only angels of higher order can do that. I can only read your thoughts as you're thinking them to yourself."" I could hear a hint of irritation in her voice. 

     ""Okay. What I think of Ryou? Hmmm...he's really kind and caring...very sweet...selfless...a really bad liar...umm...that's pretty much it."" I nodded at her. She seemed happy to hear.

     ""So you don't think he's a weakling? You don't think he's a, quote unquote, sissy boy?""

     ""Uhhh, he does seem a little over-sensitive for a guy, but there's nothing wrong with that.""

     ""Are you sure about that?""

     ""Why shouldn't I be?""

     ""Will you remember this discussion later on?""

     ""I don't understand.""

     ""All I'm asking is if you'll remember what you told me right now.""

     ""Oh...I think so, yes.""

     ""That's good. We can begin your reawakening now.""

     ""Ummm, sure...""

     The room glowed a bright red, and when it died down, I remembered everything.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ryou's POV:
 
     ""Okay, well, I'm going to see if I can access his soul room. If you want, you can help yourselves to --."" I stopped, again remembering that we had no food. ""Ummm, there's water. You can, uh, watch TV if you like. Or if you'd prefer, you can go home...""

     ""No, that's okay, Ryou! I'm sure you still need help with the math, so I'll just stay and wait. That way we don't have to tie up the phone line later. Yami doesn't mind, right, Yami?"" Yugi turned to his darker half and grinned.

     ""Besides,"" Yami added, visibly melting under his hikari's smile, ""We should be here to make sure that the Tomb Robber doesn't do anything stupid once he awakens. Don't worry about us. We'll be fine.""

     ""Thanks."" I said and smiled graciously. To tell the truth, I didn't know what trouble I'd be in if my yami suddenly regained his memory only to see me in his soul room. 

     I sat next to my yami's still body. I concentrated, then found myself in my own soul room. It was plain and dark, the only style my yami would let me keep. It was cold, unusually cold. I could see my breath form as I sighed. I should go check to see if I had some kind of disorder. Not everyone sighs five times a minute.

     I walked over to the door and opened it. In the doorway, I looked over and saw my yami's door. It was locked, bolted, etc. to prevent entry by me. Only he had the keys, which could only be conjured by himself. I shook my head. What kind of things were he trying to hide from me?

     Sighing for what seemed to be the hundredth time, I made my way to my yami's side of the corridor and knocked softly. The sound echoed and died away into nothingness. I shuddered unwillingly, partially from the cold and partly from having the knowledge that the recesses of my mind were very...big.

     I knocked again, but this time, there was no sound.

     ""How very...odd..."" I said and watched as my breath made a frozen layer of moisture on the door. The locks one by one seemed to disappear, until there was only the dead bolt left. I couldn't believe it. Then, bright red light filtered through the cracks and it was dim again. 

     ""Excuse me? Yami?"" I whispered while leaning up against his door. Warmth was now radiating from his room. For some strange reason, I was relieved.

     Finally, the dead bolt vanished altogether and I reached for the latch.

     'This is it, Ryou. The moment of truth...man, I really need to stop sounding so lame...'

     I rolled my eyes and shook my head. Even if the old Bakura was back, he wouldn't be _that_ upset if I peeked into his soul room, would he? Yes, I would just peek to see if anything was wrong. Excellent idea indeed.

     'I need to get out more...'

     I opened the door so that just a small sliver of light came through. Then I peered inside. What I saw froze me to the spot.

     Bakura was hunched on the ground, surrounded by two weird lizard creatures, and next to them was...was...an angel?!

     ""Do you remember now, Bakura?"" the lady  asked. A reddish light glowed from her extended hand while Bakura's heavy breathing could be heard. I took notice that her wings were like fresh snow in the morning, with silky feathers that shone like the moon. The gown she wore was pure white, her skin was ivory, her...voice...everything finally clicked.

     ""M-Mother?!"" I gasped. I leaned too much on the door and pushed it open, falling in face first. I felt all eyes on me as I hastily got to my feet. ""Sorry."" I mumbled and hung my head. I shut my eyes and awaited the punch from Bakura for daring to spy on him in his soul room, but instead, warm hands cupped my face and lifted my head up.

     ""Oh dear, are you alright?"" the angel asked, checking me over. I cracked open an eye and disappointment washed through me when I saw that she had black hair and green eyes. She didn't even look remotely like my mother, but I could've sworn that I saw white hair...   

     ""Y-yes, I'm ok-kay!"" I stammered out. Her gaze remained fixated on my face and it was so intense that I began to blush. She smiled and hugged me. My reaction, of course, was to stiffen. I didn't even know who she was!

     ""You are SO cute!"" she cried, giving me an extra squeeze before letting go. My face was probably bright pink, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it was all familiar. I looked over behind her and saw a pissed off Bakura. I thought he was going to come over and hit me, but he just glared, 'hmphed', then turned around. I was suprised when the angel kissed me on the forehead and told me to take care of Bakura.

     She glided to Bakura and began talking to him. Their voices were hushed, so I couldn't make out any of the words. I shut my eyes and concentrated, but a tap on my arm caused me to unfocus. Standing on both sides of me were the two lizards that were originally by Bakura.

     ""We are not lizards."" the black one said, looking a little miffed.

     ""I'm sorry, I didn't -- Hey! How did you know I was thinking that?"" I asked. There was a long pause with whispers in the background.

     ""Apologies, Young Master. We are not authorized to say."" the white one finally replied.

     ""I guess I get it...I think. Am I not allowed to know anything then?""

     ""Curiousity kills."" the black one now said.

     ""Right...well, can you at least tell me if my yami has parasitic spirits living with him in here? Is everything alright?""

     ""Parasitic?!"" The white one silenced the other's outburst with a look. Something very weird was going on, but before I could say anything, another flash of red filled the room.

     I blinked, trying to adjust to normal light. I was laying on something warm. Correction: some_body_ warm.""

     ""Hello, Ryou.""

     ""Huh?!""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bakura's POV:
 

     ""Can you remember now, Bakura?"" asked the angel.
 


     I could remember. Oh dear Ra, I could remember. The memories came back at an overwhelming rate. I fell to my knees and gasped for air. Flashes of my past resurfaced, but I quickly quelled them down. I wouldn't have been able to understand them, anyway. I was too wrapped up in my most recent conversation.
 


Flashback:


 
     ""Okay. What I think of Ryou? Hmmm...he's really kind and caring...very sweet...selfless...a really bad liar...umm...that's pretty much it."" I nodded at her. She seemed happy to hear.



     ""So you don't think he's a weakling? You don't think he's a, quote unquote, sissy boy?""



     ""Uhhh, he does seem a little over-sensitive for a guy, but there's nothing wrong with that.""



     ""Are you sure about that?""



     ""Why shouldn't I be?""



     ""Will you remember this discussion later on?""



     ""I don't understand.""



     ""All I'm asking is if you'll remember what you told me right now.""



 
     ""Oh...I think so, yes.""
 


End Flashback


 
     I held down the contents of my stomach. I was true to my word, and I remembered what I had said. Oh gods, did I actually say that? Did I mean what I said? It couldn't have been me! It couldn't have! I grew furious. How dare she take advantage of me while I was still ignorant?


     I was ready to launch myself at her in a fit of rage, but my assault was halted when I heard quiet breathing. It wasn't myself, I was breathing raggedly, and it wasn't the angel, she wasn't even breathing. I listened carefully, concentrating on that slight breathing, and stopped at the door. Someone was there. Someone was eavesdropping.


     My sensitive ears picked up a quiet, ""Mother!"", before the door swung open and in dropped a body. It took me a few seconds to realize who it was, but when I did, I felt a sudden pang of regret in my heart. I had no idea where it was from, but it hurt. It hurt like someone was trying to rip my heart out of my chest. I grimaced inwardly, not wanting to show my weaknesses in front of my hikari. Another thing dawned on me.


     All in the time span of a few hours, I had asked for help from my hikari, admitted to a weakness, CRIED in front of my hikari, and ended up making out with him on the floor. What was this world coming to? I could vaguely hear some voices behind me, but the words were unclear. I slowly got up to my feet, not wanting to stagger or do something equally degrading. I looked over in time to see a black haired woman hugging my hikari.


     An emotion flared through my veins. It was one that always circulated dilute, but I was familiar with its presence. Whenever the Pharaoh was about, it would become concentrated, blinding me, leaving me seeing nothing but green. I knew what it was and I was appalled that I was feeling it now.


     Unable to look at the scene any longer, I gave a final piercing glare and turned away. I was tempted to go over there and pry the two apart, but I went with my better judgment and seethed silently.


     'Stupid hikari. Damn him. Damn his idiotic mind, damn his girly-ness, damn his niceness...Damn him...' I continued my rant for a few more seconds until a hand on my shoulder revived me.


     ""Bakura, you shouldn't think such things of Ryou. You even said so your --.""


     ""Stay out of my head!"" I hissed. My eyes widened. There was the original angel standing before me. Not a single trace of the black haired beauty was in sight. I looked at her with confusion and she only smiled.


     ""Don't worry, Ryou still sees me as the strange girl living in your soul room that has taken a liking to him! Aahhh, to be young and naive again...""


     I narrowed my eyes at her and growled a single word, ""Why?""


     ""Isn't it obvious, Bakura?"" Sadness flashed through her eyes, but quickly disappeared, only to be replaced with love and tenderness as she watched Ryou from the corner of her eye. ""Ryou has accepted my departure, but it took him many years to reach his peace of mind now. What would he say if he finally saw me inside his yami's soul room, conspiring with the 'evil' spirit nonetheless? What would he do? But most importantly, what would he think?""


     ""Then what's going to happen now? He's already seen Iliya and Moins. You can't do anything about it now."" I jerked my head over to where they were engaged in a conversation.


     ""Oh, but I can. I'm willing to reset this little 'bet'. I have to admit that the conditions to start with weren't exactly prime, but it's not like I could see into the future. It'll be like this: Iliya and Moins will be here just like in the original deal, but a few revisions need to be made. First, you will be unable to access your soul room. That way, the risk of seeing either of them is non-existent and the bet will not be revealed to you. The original wage on my part is still there, but you are also required to put something on the line for if you win, too. Something that is equivalent or greater in value to the wish you will make. That way, it's always a win-lose double scenario. I'm assuming you remember the details from our previous encounter?""


     ""Yes, but wait a minute here. What if I don't want to agree to these new terms?"" My confidence was returning to me. ""And what do you mean by, 'always a win-lose double scenario'? That's absurd. How the hell am I supposed to make a tribute that's equal to or greater than total world domination?""


     ""Then you fold and I go away, never to bother you again. For your next question, you will just have to wait and see. And finally, you will be surprised to find out what things are more precious than the world itself.""


     ""When you say 'reset', does that  mean that both Ryou and I will not remember any of this? Then what about in the real world? I know I'm pretty beat up. How will we explain that?""


     ""Just trust me on that. You won't be disappointed with what I have in store for you.""


     ""Like before, then, I agree to your terms. Let the challenge commence.""


     I caught a glimpse of Ryou arguing with Moins before red light blinded me.


     I awoke to someone laying on top of me. Looking down, I saw a head of white hair. What was going on? Someone was going to pay for this sick joke. It might as well start with my girly aibou.


     ""Hello, Ryou.""


     He gasped and I mentally smirked. I needed some fun in my day, and mind games were so fun to play, especially when the victim had no idea what was in store...

Ryou thoughts to Bakura: /............../
Bakura thoughts to Ryou: //.............//

     Ryou's POV:

     I laid on the floor, gasping for air. I suspected a few cracked ribs and a bruised right knee, and my nose was bleeding profusely. I choked on my own saliva and began coughing, which only worsened the pain from my sides. Today's beating had been much more relentless than usual, and I doubted that I would be goin to school tomorrow. I shuddered to the prospect, because it meant that I would be alone in the house with him for longer than necessary. My father was away on business and wouldn't return for another two weeks. I deeply regretted refusing to stay at a friend's house.

     I didn't understand my yami. I truly believed I was making progress in trying to befriend him; that Yugi and the others were really getting through to him on the whole yamis-don't-beat-their-hikaris idea. I guess I was proven completely wrong. 

     I had just walked through the door, returning from a hectic day at school, when suddenly he seized my throat and threw me to the ground. Before I understood what was happening, there was a sharp pain in my back. I winced and went into a fetal position. I covered my head with my arms and bit my lip to prevent my cries from escaping. My tears were on the verge of leaking down my face. I had wanted desperately for the hurt to stop, but had known better. Whenever my yami decided another lesson was in order, he would teach until it sunk in; though I had no idea why I had needed one today.

     I sighed, and noticed that I sighed more frequently nowadays. I clutched at my nose, halting the flow of warm blood. Staggering up, I headed to the bathroom, almost falling when I put weight on my bad knee. 

     After a trying time getting to the bathroom with my left hand clamped onto my nose and using my right hand for support against the wall, my nosebleed stopped. I examined my face while putting all my weight on my left leg. My left eye was beginning to swell and there was dried blood all over my face and in my hair.

     I took off my Millennium ring, then my sweater and shirt, which I folded neatly. I gently prodded the developing bruise at my side and almost screamed out, but restrained myself because that would probably credit to another beating. Carefully, I took off my pants and saw that my knee was an ugly mix of black and blue. I discarded my boxers and slowly climbed into the shower.

     Cold water blasted from the shower head. I flinched, but stayed there. I sighed at Bakura's little prank. He must have turned off the hot water heater. Nonetheless, I began to wash my hair, careful not to agitate my left eye with shampoo.

     I finished and reached out for a towel, but much to my dismay, there were none on the shelf. I wanted so badly to scream at him.

     Instead, I wrung out my hair and began to apply ointment to my injuries. I had discovered this brand a few weeks back and found that it really lessened the swelling and pain. I hid it at the back of the medicine cabinet so that my yami wouldn't find it and throw it away.

     Then I placed all my clothes in the hamper and picked up the ring. I figured since I was the only one home, other than my yami, it didn't matter if I was in the nude or not, so I walked out.

     The air was cool against my skin, giving me goosebumps. I quietly made my way to my room upstairs and shut the door. I opened my dresser and pulled out a T-shirt and some loose sweat pants; I didn't want to put any more pressure on my knee than required. I eyed the ring.

     Ahhhhh, the Millennium ring, the bane of my existance. Ever since that fateful day my father unwittingly unleashed my yami on me.

     A little Ryou had just entered into the privacy of his room. He held onto the new treasure his father just gave him. He was ecstatic! It was so big and shiny, and there was a rope so he could wear it as a necklace. He smiled and put it on. Suddenly, from out of nowhere appeared a boy who looked exactly like him. Little did he know that this boy would put him through hell.

     ""Wh-who are y-you?"" Ryou asked timidly. Then he perked up. ""W-wanna be friends?"" He smiled at the other boy.

     A fist came flying at his face and knocked him to the ground. Tears flowed freely from his eyes.

     ""Why did you do that?!"" he asked fiercely and began crying.

     ""Shut up!"" said the violent boy. He looked down and saw the ring hanging from the girly-boy's neck. He smirked and said, ""You must be my hikari.""

     I shuddered at the 7 year old memory. Bakura, my last name and the name my yami preferred to be called, had threatened to kill me if I ever told anyone about him. I had researched into the matter and knew that he could never carry out his threat without destroying himself, but I didn't want him to go after the people I cared about.

     I placed the ring back around my neck and ventured down to the kitchen, taking my time on the stairs to prevent any accidental falling. I was famished because I had skipped out on lunch to finish a project for tomorrow. I sighed, remembering that I wasn't planning on going to school tomorrow. That would mean a 10% deduction.

     Being one of the top students in my class, I couldn't afford to lose 10%. I weighed out the options and decided that I would go to school and hand in my assignment, then feign illness and go home. Satisfied with my system, I opened the fridge and looked inside. It was empty. I checked the cupboards and found them devoid of edible substances. Luckily, I'd looked to the future and predicted this day would come. 

     I went to the utensils' drawer and reached to the very back. I pulled out a cup of instant ramen from my secret stash and closed the drawer. How, you ask, can I keep it a secret from my yami? Actually, I have no idea why he hasn't figured it out yet. Same with the ointment in the medicine cabinet. Maybe he does but doesn't do anything about it. Who knows? You can never tell with all the mood swings he has.

     The water bubbled in the kettle and began to steam, so I poured it into the cup. I let it cool for a couple minutes, then dug in with my chopsticks. I ate hurridly and drank all the soup at the end. Usually, I was a moderate eater, but in this situation, I decided the wise choice of action would be to finish before Bakura had the chance to intervene.

     //Had enough of a break, weakling?""// 

     Speak of the devil. Of course I was scared, but I kept my face neutral. That was one of the many lessons that was beat into my memory: Never show fear. 

     /............./ I didn't reply. I got up in a confident manner, even though on the inside, I was shaking like Jell-o. I put my chopsticks in the sink and threw away the empty cup. Then I staggered to the living room and plopped myself on the couch. 

     Pointing the remote control at the T.V set, I saw that my hand was trembling slightly. Hopefully, my yami didn't notice. I turned it on and quickly retracted my hand to my stomach. My heart was pounding so hard I couldn't even hear the T.V. 

     All of a sudden, Bakura appeared in front of me. I knew I should have gotten used to that by now, but I let out a small gasp. He narrowed his eyes at me and smirked.

     //Give me the remote and get off the couch.//

     /............/ I don't know why, but I didn't move.

     //You wanna play it that way? So be it.// He grabbed me by the hair and threw me off the couch. I hadn't expected it to hurt that much, but it had and I found myself crying out in pain when my knees hit the ground. I just laid there, unmoving. The inevitable hit for showing weakness never came and I was shocked. Had my yami just shown some mercy?

     //Don't get your hopes up. I'm too tired to deal with you now, so maybe later.// I heard him sit down on the couch and switch a few channels until he got to a DBZ episode. I turned my head to the screen. It was the one where Goku and Vegeta become Vegetto by putting on the Potara Earings. I knew that he idolized Vegeta, but I was more of a Goku fan. He had beaten me for that.

      I hesitantly removed myself from the floor and went back to my room carrying my backpack I'd left at the front door. I zipped it open and fished out my homework. It was all due next week, but since I had the time now, I decided to complete it early. 

     I sighed. It was going to be another long evening. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bakura's POV:

     It had been a lousy day. First, I found that I'd overslept and missed my morning line-up of programs. Then, I slipped on some clothes by the stairs and fell all the way down. I had yelled some choice Egyptian words directed towards my neat-freak aibou, though the articles of clothing were mine My forehead had slammed into the ground, hard, and I developed a huge bruise. It was a good thing my bangs were long and served to hide it well. I didn't want anyone to figure out what a huge klutz I am. 

     Next, some drunkie had come up to the door and started ringing the bell like crazy. Out of all the houses on the block, why'd he choose this one to come and harass? 

     I opened the door, ready to kick some ass, when the guy fell on me and kissed me right on the lips. You can guess what happened next. Yup. I beat the crap out of the bastard and chucked him onto the road. I really couldn't care less what happened to him. I had felt so violated, and I still do. He'd stolen my first kiss after 5 millennia of isolation.

     'Damn! And I was saving it for -- What the hell am I thinking?!' My brain pushed the thought aside. I was too pissed off to think straight. The usual victim of my frustration wasn't present, so I had to think of more conventional ways to vent my anger.

     It was passed noon, so I decided to check up on what my weakling-aibou was up to. I reached through to him with our soul link and sensed hunger.

     'Excellent. My stupid aibou must've skipped lunch to finish that project he's been whining about, and this gives me the perfect idea.' I laughed evilly to no one in particular. Then I went to the kitchen and got rid of all traces of food. My plan was brilliant and I found that it was giving me more satisfaction than just beating the kid.

     I knew my girly-aibou well, and knew that he was a real pig when it came down to food. 'You've got to hit him where it hurts most.' I went to the living room and waited him to come home, all the while planning his evening of horrors.

     A few hours later, and I heard the clinking of keys. I got up and walked to the door. No sooner had my moronic aibou stuck his head through then I threw him to the ground by the throat. I kicked him in the back and watched as he curled inward. I shook my head at his futile attempt to protect his head, making sure to hit him in the face a couple times.

     It was a pretty severe beating. That drunk dude ticked me off more than I'd thought. I stood over my idiotic aibou's prostrate body, listening to his ragged breaths. My face softened when I saw the blood, but I quickly snapped out of it. I gave him one final blow to his ribs, spun around, and went to prepare for faze two of my ingenious plan.

     Already turning off all the hot water, I went back into the ring and waited for my lazy aibou to get up. I kind of felt sorry for him. It had been a rough week for him at school, what with all the tests and due dates scheduled; but then again, my day sucked.

     He'd just gotten in the shower and now my other prank was called into action. I came out of the ring and swiped all the towels from the shelf. Then I quietly slipped out of the bathroom with the goods while my feminine aibou was preoccupied with his hair. All those years of being a thief were continuing to pay off.

     I stashed the towels under the couch and sat down to wait for part three. In a bit, I heard several opening and closing of doors, then slow thumping down the stairs. I peeked around the corner and watched as he opened the refrigerator door and all the cupboards. His expression was priceless, but then he did something unexpected. He opened a drawer and pulled out some instant ramen.

     I was furious! Did he think that he out-smarted me? I wanted to go in there and break his legs, but then I got a strange idea. Why not let him eat?

     'WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME TODAY?!' I clutched my head in my hands. Too confused to judge clearly, I returned to the ring.

     After organizing my thoughts, I reached out through our soul link.

     //Had enough of a break, weakling?// I jeered.

     /............/ There was no reply.

     I was a little surprised, but slowly gathered my wits and appeared in front of the boy, who suddenly let out a small noise. Dismissing the action, I noticed that we were not in the kitchen, but in the living room and he was watching T.V. I gave him one of my more menacing smirks.

     //Give me the remote and get off the couch.// I mentally commanded.

     /.........../ Silence, save the voices from the T.V. I was getting annoyed at his sudden defiance.

     //You wanna play it that way? So be it.// I picked him up by the hair and slammed him to the ground. A cry of pain filled the room and was immediately stifled. I moved to strike him but stopped abruptly when I realized that he didn't curl up like he usually did. Mixed messages swarmed to my brain. I frowned and shook my head.  

     I probed his mind and felt surprise, relief, and curiosity. Instantly, I knew what he was thinking. Not wanting to do anything about, but it at the cost of my reputation, I made up an excuse.

     //Don't get your hopes up. I'm too tired to deal with you now, so maybe later.// Then I sat on the couch and began to watch my daily DBZ episode. I'd already seen the entire series twice, and recognized this to be the one where Vegetto shows up and fights Majin Buu.

     My scrawny aibou picked himself off the floor and walked out of the room. I returned my attention to the T.V. set.

     Vegeta. He was my favourite character. Why? I could relate with him. He had been on a quest to find the Dragon Balls to become immortal. Me? I'm already immortal, but I'd been searching for the Millennium items for more power. He was a ruthless fighter, not caring about anyone weaker than him. I beat my frail aibou for being weak. He fell for a stupid woman. I'm falling for my stupid --!

     'WHAT?! NO! No, no, no, no, no! What am I thinking?!' I shut off the T.V. and threw the remote at it, which missed completely. My liking of Vegeta completely disintegrated and I cursed his name. Then something came to me. 

     'It must be because of this bump on my head!' I touched it lightly and pain seared through my skull. 'I should go see if there's anything I can put on it to lessen the swelling.' 

      But I was at a complete loss. I'd never required any special treatment for my injuries before, so I had no idea what to do. Then there was my aibou. His bruises always seemed to disappear, or at least appear not as painful, after he came out of the bathroom. I could go ask him for help, but as a result he'd know about my clumsy accident this morning. Still, this bump could be damaging to my health. 

     I pressed it one more time and almost collapsed off the couch. Swiftly making up my mind, I got up and headed for my hikari's room. 

     Standing outside the closed door, I wanted to back out of it then and there, but swallowed my enormous pride and knocked.  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ryou's POV:

     Knocking? That's really weird, because no one that would knock is home. If Bakura wanted to come in, he'd just walk in. I shrugged it off and called out,

     ""The door's open!""

     To my huge surprise, Bakura opened the door and nervously looked in. Wait. Nervously? I looked at his face one more time to see it neutral. Must've been my mistake.

     ""Umm, so, what do you want, yami?"" I asked slowly.

     ""Look, I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna say it outright."" Bakura said.

     ""Okay."" I said. Was it just me or did Bakura seem a little figety?

     ""This morning, I tripped on some clothes and fell down the stairs. I hit my head pretty hard and now there's a huge bruise. And I was wondering, since you know about this stuff, if you could tell me what to put on it."" he said very quickly.

     I really didn't expect that. I was confused and somewhat annoyed. Hadn't he been the one that beat me up for no good reason at all? And now, he wanted my help? It made no sense, but when I saw him all flustered like that, I really couldn't say no. I sighed exasperatedly.

     ""Fine, alright. I think I have something that will work."" I got up and limped out of the room. He followed a few paces behind. It was a risky idea. He could get mad with the fact that I hid the ointment from him and beat me again, or he would be grateful that I had the stuff with me.

     'He better be grateful... Oh well, too late to turn back now.' I thought as I reached the bathroom and hesitantly opened the medicine cabinet.

     ""What are we doing here, aibou? Getting some painkillers? I told you, I just need the swelling to go down! Can't you get that through your head? I don't need medication! Do I need to beat this fact into your useless brain as well?!"" Bakura said impatiently. His jittery demeanor sure left him fast and was replaced by his regular cockiness. It caused my irritation level to go over the top.

     ""Let me get this straight,"" I turned around and pointed my finger to his chest. ""You tripped on your own clothes, didn't you?""

     ""What does that have to do with this?"" Bakura growled.

     ""Typical answer, but I'm right, aren't it? Well, assuming that I am, the accident wasn't caused by me, and so I have no obligation to tend to your injuries, correct?"" My voice was rising by the second. ""So why should I even bother trying to help you?! You beat me because of personal problems! You're nothing but a pathetic ingrate who doesn't even know how to be polite once in a while!"" I was practically screaming at him.

     He flinched slightly at my sharp tone and harsh words, I noticed, and it looked like he was going to retaliate; but instead, he closed his eyes and deflated slightly.

     ""......"" he muttered something inaudible.

     I realized I might have said too much. ""Pardon?"" I asked quietly.

     ""I said, I'm _sorry_! So can you _please_ help me out here?!"" he said much louder, emphasizing the words 'sorry' and 'please'. I also thought I heard some desperation in his voice, but thought of it as my mind playing tricks on me. Still, there was hope for him yet!

     I sighed yet again. ""No, no, I'm the one who should be sorry. I shouldn't have said what I said, even though most of it was true. Forgive me, please?"" I was feeling very guilty about my little outburst, not that he didn't deserve it. Proof that I returned to my usual understanding and caring self.

     Bakura just stared at me dumbly and my anger was rising again. I counted to ten in my head and exhaled. Who would've thought that I needed to see a psychiatrist about anger management before my yami showed up? I used to be a bully, beating up on kids younger than me, but when mom died, I lost most of the rage that kept me going. Instead, I just started concentrating on my school work more. I always thought of it as a change for the better, even though it brought me a hell of a lot more pain.  

     His small nod brought me back to reality and I smiled at him.

     ""Okay, promise you won't get mad until after I treat you?"" I didn't wait for an answer. I took out the ointment and told him to lift his bangs up. He gave me a dangerous look that meant, 'if you try anything, I will get you later"" but complied anyways.

     The bump was more serious than I'd thought. I was surprised he didn't get a concussion. It looked like how my knee did, only worse, because it was on his head.

     ""Could you sit down over there?"" I motioned to the edge of the bath tub. I decided to do it myself because I didn't want him to hurt himself even more if I left alone. After all, I was an authority in this matter, since I had to do it every other day. Again, he gave me a warning look and moved silently to sit.

     Because of my knee, I couldn't kneel or else it would be extremely painful, so I leaned forward. I put a generous amount of the medicinal oil on my right index and middle finger, brushed his bangs out of his face, then began to gently rub it onto his bruise. Unconsciously, I moved my left hand to hold his cheek to prevent his head from moving. His eyes widened.

     I finished applying the ointment and looked down to see his reddish purple eyes staring at mine. To my complete horror, I saw my hand on his cheek. My heart was thumping now when I discovered how close our faces were. His lips were mere inches away. Then I saw tears at the corner of his eyes.

     'What the--?!' I had no time to finish my thought because my knees suddenly buckled. I fell forward, causing both of us to topple over into the bath tub.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bakura's POV:

     I waited outside the door for an answer, which was very unlike me. I tapped my foot impatiently.

     ""The door's open!"" I heard coming from in the room. Taking a deep breath, I opened the door and looked in. As usual, aibou was doing his work at his desk, so I relaxed a little. I looked around a bit before his voice reminded me why I was here in the first place.

     ""Umm, so, what do you want, Bakura?""

     I doubted whether I should've come. My aibou could always tell the Pharaoh about this and then he'd come up with a stupid nickname, like Twinkle Toes, or something. Then again, I could always threaten aibou not to breathe a word of this to anyone. Liking my plan, I began to tell him what happened, leaving out the part about who the clothes belonged to and the incident with the drunk guy.

     ""...since you know about this stuff, if you could tell me what to put on it."" I said rather hastily. I felt blood rush up to my face so I turned and pretended to look at a few of his  posters. Aibou was a big Gundam Wing fan, and so he had a number model suits displayed on his book shelf. There was a Wing Zero, Sandrock, Tallgeese...I could go on, but was growing intolerant to aibou's lack of answer. Suddenly I heard a big sigh.

     ""Fine, alright. I think I have something that will work."" He got up and hobbled out to the hallway. I walked out, a few steps behind him, and studied his technique for walking with his right knee remaining straight.

     I was disgusted with how low I stooped. Asking an such ungainly person like my aibou for help? Ha! Life has its little quirks now and then.

     Huh? How come we were at the bathroom? Then I saw him reaching for the medicine cabinet.

     'Didn't I empty that out a while ago?' I thought to myself. Last month, I went and threw away all of his disinfectant creams, pain relievers, etc, but left only some Tylenol and a first aid kit so that his dad didn't suspect anything too much. I told him to take his pain like a man.

     Then a thought came to me. What if aibou hid something from me again, like that ramen in the kitchen? Or what if I forgot to get rid of something and now aibou thought I needed it for the pain? I got angry and exploded on him.

      ""...I don't need medication! Do I need to beat this fact into your useless brain as well?!"" I said, irritated. Aibou whirled on me abruptly. 

     ""Let me get this straight,"" he pointed his finger at me, ""You tripped on your own clothes, didn't you?""

     That took him long enough to understand. I mean, he's a neat freak; and which one of us would wear tight leather pants? Still, it all added to the irony of my situation so I growled and said:

     ""What does that have to do with this?""

     ""Typical answer, but I'm right, aren't I? Well, assuming that I am, the accident wasn't caused by me, and so I have no obligation to tend to your injuries, correct?"" He was going hysterical! ""So why should I even bother trying to help you?! You beat me because of personal problems! You're nothing but a pathetic ingrate who doesn't even know how to be polite once in a while!"" The last accusing sentence was screamed.

     I stared at him in disbelief. I'd never heard him this full of conviction for all the time I'd known him. Then I cringed inward when I realized that what he said was completely true. I was about to say something back to him, to defend myself, but a tiny voice inside my head spoke up.

     <This is probably what he feels like whenever you're yelling at him.>

     I stopped and closed my eyes. The voice, or whatever it was, was right.

     <Appologize. He's waiting.>

     'I'm going crazy. The things I do...' My shoulders slumped a bit and I exhaled slowly.

     ""Sorry."" I don't think my aibou heard me.

     ""Pardon?"" Bingo.

     ""I said I'm _sorry_! So can you _please_ help me out here?!"" I meant for it to be a sarcastic response, but it came out sounding like I was a beggar on the streets. Damn.

     He sighed. Why does he do that all the time? It's so annoying.

     ""No, no, I'm the one who should be sorry. I shouldn't have said what I said, even though most of it was true."" he added as a side note, ""Forgive me, please?"" 

     I stared at him again. Was this guy for real? Why was he apologizing?! Was he trying to make me look like an idiot when I finally admitted I was wrong? What was --?!

     <He's waiting for your answer.> The voice interrupted my train of thought. 

     I rolled my eyes and nodded once. He gave me a smile that I rarely saw.

     <That's probably because you don't give him any reason to.> Shut up, stupid voice.

     ""Okay, promise you won't get mad until after I treat you?"" He confirmed my suspicion when he pulled out a bottle. ""Can I get a look at your forehead? Move your bangs.""

     I glared at him. I wanted to tell him not tell me what to do. Then there was that annoying voice again.

     <He knows what he's doing. Just trust him. Do what he says.>

     Defeated, I lifted my bangs out of the way. My aibou looked surprised to see the bump.

     'Knows what he's doing my ass.' 

     ""Could you sit down over there?"" he asked and pointed to the bath tub. I narrowed my eyes but still did as he asked.

     He put some of the stuff on his fingers and leaned forward. Brushing my hair away, he began to gently apply the ointment to my skin. It hurt immensely, but I wouldn't let him have the satisfaction of seeing me in pain during his tender ministrations. 

     Suddenly, he put his hand on my cheek. I stared at him. What was thinking? Then I noticed that he was still busy doing his thing, so I eased up a little. I watched him as he continued working, and couldn't help but think he was kind of cute.

     'Cute?!' I was appalled. I wasn't actually falling for my aibou, was I?!

     An eyelash or some dust fell into my right eye and it was getting aggravated. I tried to blink it out but my eyes were watering like crazy. Just then, my aibou finished and I looked up. Chocolate brown orbs met crimson.

     His hand stayed where it was. My heart was pounding furiously, thought I didn't know why. I felt heat rise to my cheeks when he moved his face even closer.

     Then he lurched forward, pushing me into the bath tub with him on top of me.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ryou's POV:

     Ouch. That really hurt. My knee hit the side of the tub pretty hard and I grimaced in pain. I had to look at the bright side, though. Bakura _did_ take most of the fall. Come to think of it, I was still laying on top of him.

     I quickly tried to get up, but with the shape my knee was in, it was a lost cause. I fell back down and stayed still in fear of what my yami was going to do to me. I could see it now...

(Ryou's prediction)

     ""Get offa me, damnit!"" Bakura shouts and pushes Ryou off. He stands up over his hikari's fallen form. ""What the hell was that all about?!""

     ""I'm sorry! Please! It wasn't my fault! I have weak knees!"" Ryou cowers in a corner.

     ""Weak knees, huh?"" Kicks the back of Ryou's right knee. ""Let's see if you can walk after this!"" He laughs insanely.

(end thought)

     My head was on his chest and I was listening to his heart beat. Actually, it wasn't such a bad position. It kind of reminded me of one of my dreams...'Enough of that!' I mentally kicked myself. How would Bakura react if he found out I have dreams about him? I erased the thoughts from my mind.

     One question plagued my mind. How come Bakura wasn't trying to kill me? In fact, he hasn't even tried to move once ever since we landed. I looked up at his face and saw that his eyes were closed. Then I noticed the blood.

     Blood was soaking through his hair and slowly making its way to the drain. He was out cold.

     'Shit.' My adrenaline was pumping now. I got up, ignoring the pain, and pulled him up. His head hung limp as I inspected the split. It wasn't very deep, but it was long. The blood was now dripping down his neck. 'How could this happen?! He does to me far worse and I've never blacked out just like that! Crap! Where's the first-aid kit?!'

     I placed Bakura on the ground face up and ran to get the kit. I opened it and pulled out some bandages, gauze, and antiseptic, the only things inside. Quickly, I wiped up the blood with toilet paper and began wrapping his head.

     'Good thing he doesn't need stitches.' I tried to look at the bright side.

     Still on my adrenaline rush, I managed to half lift, half drag Bakura to the living room and onto the couch. I made sure he was in a fairly comfortable position, laying down, then went to clean up in the bathroom.

     It probably looked like cruelty when I didn't call an ambulance, but I had my reasons. For one, there were no medical records of him -- scratch that --  no records of him period. If the doctors started asking questions, I'd be at a loss and most likely suspicion would arouse.

     I sighed deeply. I was done cleaning, but now that everything was calmed down, my knee hurt more than ever from me pushing it too hard during the crisis. I retrieved my homework from my room, almost falling while coming down the stairs. Then I sat down at the kitchen table, always keeping an eye on Bakura's unconscious form as I did my work.

     My stomach growled loudly. I still had some food at the back of the drawer, but decided to leave it for Bakura when he wakes up. Sure, he didn't _need_ to eat or drink, but he developed the habit just to spite me. Days when I'd come home and look for a snack, I'd find that Bakura had already eaten all of it.

     There was something that really bothered me. Usually, whenever Bakura wanted to sleep or rest, he'd just return to the ring. Shouldn't that also account for when he lost consciousness? I'd just have to ask him about it after he woke up, in a subtle way of course, so as to not provoke him to try and hit me.

     Wait, why didn't I try this before? I reached out to Bakura through my link.

     /Bakura, you alright? Yo, Bakura! It's me, Ryou! Can you hear me?/ I mentally spoke.

     //....................// There was silence.

     /Are you mad at me or something? Is that why you won't talk?/

     //....................// Still silence.

     /Bakura! You're seriously scaring me here! Say something! I know you can hear me!/ I don't know why I kept on talking even though I got no reply. I was really getting worried.

     ""Ha! I'm worried?! This should be the first time lady luck looked my way! I shouldn't care if he never wakes up!"" I said these things to help me keep calm, but deep down inside, I knew something was wrong. 

     I looked at the clock and it read 8:17. I continued to work until I heard a groan coming from the living room.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bakura: *reading from book* 'Chapter One: Basic Spells' Feh, bo-ring! Lessee... 'Chapter 23: How to make your enemy grovel like the dog he is' Ooohhhh, I like this book already.

Ryou: I wish you would read more educational things, like biographies or history books...

Bakura: You better shut your trap if you know what's good for you.

Ryou: *sighs* Anything you say, _master_.

Bakura: Hmmmm, I like the sound of that...I know! *flips through the book till he gets to the section: Your Aibou and You* Perfect!

Ryou: This is going to be a long day...

Bakura: Ahem *clears throat*


             To you I will be the sun and the moon;
             You'll take me away as the dish did the spoon.
             You'll look to no other but me and my eyes;
             Not even to your favourite apple spice pies.
             I know I've done nothing to gain your trust,
             But now you will find there is only lust.
             Lust for my body, lust for my soul,
             Lust 'cause it's the only way that you'll feel whole.


Alright, who the hell wrote this crap?! *looks at spine on book and reads: firedraygon97* Figures...

Ryou: *gives a sultry look* Bakura-sama...

Bakura: Huh? What the fu--*is stopped by a kiss* Mmphnifigimmmhhhhhpphhhh!!!

Ryou: *breaks kiss* Let's go get a room...*drapes arms over Bakura's shoulders and moves to grind their hips together*

Bakura: Gyahh! *pushes Ryou away* Stay away from me! What has gotten into you, aibou?!

Ryou: When you call me that, it just makes me want you even more...*is latched back onto Bakura and rubbing his thighs against him*

Bakura: Ra, what the heck is going on?! *grabs book and flips to the page the spell was on. He reads the description: 'Finding your sex life pitiful? Haven't done it in more than a week? Well look no further 'cause we have the perfect spell for you! Whether it's because of PMS, or because your partner is feeling bored, this spell is guarunteed to work. Make your partner sex-crazed in no time!'* Aarrggghhhhhh! No wonder! Aibou is a direct translation! Nooooo!

Ryou: I know you want me, _master_. *begins to undo Bakura's zipper*

Bakura: Where's the counterspell? Where?! *begins frantically searching through the book. He reaches the back where in big, bold letters, it says:* 'All spells wear off in a little while, ranging from 24 hours to a week'?!

Ryou: That's lots of time for me to work...

Bakura: Uh, umm...Later!

Ryou: What?

Bakura: I promise, we'll have lots and lots of sex later! Just calm your hormones for now!

Ryou: Really?

Bakura: YES! NOW GET OFF OF ME!

Ryou: Just to be on the safe side, I tape recorded this. *plays back recording - Bakura: ...and lots of sex later! Just --*

Bakura: What did I get myself into?

Chapter Two: The Perfect Plan

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bakura: Damnit, aibou! Let go of my arm!
 
Ryou: If I don't feel you on me, I might go a little crazy...
 
Bakura: Fine, fine! Just keep your hands in my sight!
 
Ryou: That wasn't part of the deal, Bakura-sama. *puts a hand on Bakura's thigh*
 
Bakura: I see I've been too much of an influence on you these days...
 
Ryou: You know it, baby. *rub's Bakura's thigh*
 
Bakura: For crying out loud, cut it out!
 
Ryou: Make me.
 
Bakura: If you don't, I go into the ring and I won't come out until you're back to normal!
 
Ryou: *retracts hand* You wouldn't, Bakura-sama! No!
 
Bakura: I see I have some power over you now...
 
Ryou: Your manipulative ways turn me on.
 
Bakura: AAAHHHHHHHH!!! *pulls at hair* Fine, whatever, I don't care anymore! Do whatever you want! I'm gonna go hang out with Malik! *walks away*
 
Ryou: Don't forget me...*glids alongside Bakura*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At Malik's house

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bakura: Yo, Malik! You home?! *bangs on door*
 
Malik: *from behind door* Bakura? Is that you? Come in, the door's open!
 
Bakura: Alright! *opens door and walks in* Hey, is it okay if Ryou's with me?
 
Malik: Huh? What? *peeks head around corner and sees Ryou with his head resting on Bakura's chest* Whoa! What's going on here?
 
Bakura: Check this. *tosses book to Malik*
 
Malik: 'Love Spells for the Criminally Insane'. I swear, Bakura, you're stupid if you think I'm gonna believe this.
 
Bakura: I'm not kidding! It actually works! Honest!
 
Malik: This must be another sick joke you and Ryou are trying to pull on me.
 
Bakura: Why is the whole world against me today?!
 
Malik: Well, after that last one where you got my yami to hit on me...
 
Bakura: Okay, so you have a reason to be cautious.
 
Malik: I may not believe your story, but maybe the others will. *gives book back*
 
Bakura: Who else is here?
 
Malik: Yuugi and his Yami, Jounouchi, and Kaiba. My yami's upstairs washing his hair.
 
Bakura: Hmmmm, Ryou seems to be content about everything now...Let's make this a little interesting...
 
Malik: Whatever. I was just on my way to get my yami. *walks away*
 
Bakura: Come, aibou. Let's go have some fun.
 
Ryou: I was waiting for you to say those words...
 
Bakura: Not that way! Let's look in the book...*flips to Chapter 23: How to make your enemy grovel like the dog he is* Ooohhhh, this one's good! *points to the spell category marked, 'Have the Bastard Begging for More Later'*
 
Ryou: Hmmmm...not bad, but what about this, Bakura-sama? *points to category: 'Indirect Ways to Make Your Enemy Suffer While you Watch'*
 
Bakura: You know, I like you better like this. 
 
Ryou: You'll like me much better later. *licks Bakura's jawline*
 
Bakura: *blushes and sweatdrops* Right. Stop it.
 
Ryou: *in a sexy tone* Come on, fuck me. Right here, right now. I'm sure you wanna, and I don't mind if we have an audience...*wraps a leg around Bakura*
 
Bakura: *eyes widen and he pushes Ryou away* Stop it!
 
Ryou: Don't deny it.
 
Bakura: *turns away* I'm gonna do a spell now. You can stay if you want, but keep your hands to yourself.
 
Ryou: Like this? *puts arms around Bakura's waist*
 
Bakura: Fine. At least you're not in my way. *begins reading from book* 'Name of Person'...Hmmmm, how about Yami? Yeah, that'll work. Okay. *clears throat*

 
You piece of shit, 
I want to kill you,
But better yet,
I'll break and bill you.
 

*raises an eyebrow at the what great lengths firedraygon went to make the spell rhyme*
 

Fall to the ground
And weep before me.
Your aibou will love
The first person I see.
 

Oh shit! *closes eyes* Ryou! Where's Kaiba?!
 
Ryou: *takes advantage of situation* Bakura-sama...
 
Bakura: Not now! Hurry and lead me to Kaiba!
 
Ryou: Alright. *holds Bakura's hand and leads him up the stairs towards Malik's room*
 
Bakura: Where are we going?
 
Ryou: You'll see...
 
Bakura: Some how I get a bad feeling from this...
 
Ryou: *opens the door to the bedroom* Come over here, Bakura-sama.
 
Bakura: Okay...*walks, but trips and falls over threshhold, which causes eyes to open wide. The first person he sees is Malik, who is in the process of changing his shirt (AN: *drools*)* Omfph!
 
Malik: Excuse me, but I believe you should knock before you enter.
 
Bakura: This is bad. This is so bad. I'm SO sorry, Malik!
 
Malik: Ra, is Bakura apologizing?! What did you do?!
 
Yuugi: *from downstairs* Malik-chaaaaaaaaan!
 
Bakura: Uh oh...
 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Chapter Three: Lost and Found

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Malik: Huh? *finishes putting on his shirt and turns to Bakura* Did Yuugi just add -chan to my name?
 
Yuugi: *appears at doorway, breathless from running up the stairs* Malik-chan.
 
Bakura: Ho boy, am I in for it now...*fiddles with book and looks for an exit*
 
Ryou: *glares at Malik* Don't worry, Bakura-sama. I won't let them hurt you.

Malik: Hey, Yuugi, what's up?
 
Yuugi: *now that he sees Malik, he's nervous and blushing* Umm, well, I...
 
Yami: *appearing behind Yuugi* What is it, aibou?
 
Yuugi: Gyah! Y-Yami! You nearly gave me a heart attack!
 
Yami: Forgive me, aibou, it was not my intent.
 
Yuugi: Uh, yes, well, you're forgiven then...
 
Yami: Is there something you should tell me about, aibou?
 
Malik: Guys, why is everyone gathering in my room?
 
Yuugi: Well, I'm here because I wanted to see you, Malik-chan.
 
Malik: Yes, about what?
 
Yuugi: Ummmm, I, uhhhh...
 
Ryou: Spit it out already! You're wasting all of our time! Just tell him you love him and get on with it! Right, Bakura-sama?
 
Bakura: *panicking* Aibou! Shut up!
 
Ryou: Well, it _is_ what you're going to say, Yuugi. It's because _my_ yami casted a spell on you. He mrphfphhhhb--! *mouth is covered by Bakura's hand*
 
Bakura: Well, we best be going now. *tries to drag Ryou away with him*
 
Malik: Stop right there. Bakura, we've been friends for a long time. Are you honestly telling me that the book you're holding actually works?
 
Bakura: Umm, nooooo...
 
Yuugi: Ai-ai-ai...
 
Malik: What now, Yuugi?
 
Yuugi: Aishteru, Malik-chan! *covers face and turns away*
 
*Malik and Yami stare wide-eyed*
 
Malik: Oh man...
 
Yami: This can't be...
 
Bakura: *whispering to Ryou* On the count of three, we run, got it?
 
Ryou: *nods* I'll follow you anywhere.
 
Bakura: *gives Ryou a funny look and shakes his head* Okay. One...Two...THREE!!! *runs past an embarrassed Yuugi and stunned Yami with Ryou right behind him*
 
Yuugi: *shyly* Malik-chan?

 
Malik: I am SO going to kill that white-haired bastard.
 
Yami: *growling* Tomb Robber! How dare you fool around with my aibou's emotions! Come back here! *chases after Bakura*
 
Yami Malik: *in a towel and drying his hair* Hmm? Hikari, what did I miss?
 
Yuugi: Malik-chan. I understand this is just a spell, but I can't help the way I feel towards you right now. Gomen.
 
Malik: No need to worry, Yuugi. Well just go find Bakura, kick his ass, and get him to reverse the spell. Come on. *grabs Yuugi's hand and drags him off to find Bakura*
 
Yuugi: *face is bright red* Malik-chan...
 
Malik: *stops* Oh, right, sorry. *lets go of Yuugi's hand*
 
Yuugi: *looks down at his feet sadly* Oh... *tears in eyes*
 
Malik: For crying out loud! *goes and hugs Yuugi* I don't know why I bother...
 
Yuugi: *suddenly happy again* You're the greatest, Malik-chan! This is one of the reasons why I love you more than anything! Even Duel Monsters!
 
Malik: Nonsense. You love Duel Monsters more than anything!
 
Yuugi: *shakes head* Not anymore! *hugs Malik in a death grip*
 
Malik: Can't...breathe...a little help here, yami?
 
Yami Malik: Of course, hikari. *touches a spot on Yuugi's neck and Yuugi falls unconscious*
 
Malik: YAMI! DID YOU KILL HIM?!
 
Yami Malik: Don't be silly. I just hit a pressure point. He'll wake up in a few hours.
 
Malik: Good. I wouldn't want Yami-Yuugi after me...*shudders* Now, time to find Bakura. *picks up Yuugi and goes down the stairs*
 
Yami Malik: *still drying his hair* I better go with them...*looks down and notices he's only in a towel* But first, a change of clothes...
 
~~~~~~~*Meanwhile*~~~~~~~~~

Bakura: *downstairs in Malik's house, trying to hide in a cupboard* Damnit, Ryou! You don't have to come in here with me! Why don't you be a good little boy and go throw my pursuers off-course? If someone asks for me, tell him that I ran outside. Understand?
 
Ryou: Yup yup, Bakura-sama! I'll make you proud!
 
Bakura: Let's hope so! *closes cupboard door*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jounouchi: Hey, what's this? *picks up book titled 'Love Spells for the Criminally Insane'* This looks, different...*begins reading*
 
Seto: What do you have there, puppy?
 
Jounouchi: *flashes cover of book so Seto can see the title* ...and don't call me puppy...
 
Seto: ...in public, yes, I'm sorry. By the way, where have Yuugi and his yami gone?
 
Jounouchi: How should I know?
 
Seto: Well, where did you get that book?
 
Jounouchi: *shrugs* I found it on the ground...
 
Seto: Here, lemme see it.
 
Jounouchi: Fine, fine. *tosses Seto the book*
 
Seto: 'Love Spells for the Criminally Insane'? Whoever wrote this must be extemely disturbed. *reads spine* Yup, I was write. Extremely disturbed. *opens book and flips to a random page, titled 'Pranks at the Swimming Pool* Hehehehe, listen to this, Jou:
 

From the first dive you made,
I knew I had to have you.
Your smile, how you waded,
your well-toned calves, too.
 

(AN: Sorry, but -- *breaks out laughing* That was soooo corny! Hahahahaha, but it rhymed, didn't it? Somewhat, at least...)
 

Your lean, tanned body,
That gorgeous face,
You're such a hotty,
You put Leonardo DiCaprio in disgrace.
 

Your eyes took my breath away;
With each step you took,
The way your wet hair swayed.
I am caught on your hook.
 

This is hilarious! Who the hell is Leonardo DiCaprio? 
 
Jounouchi: No idea. Fire-san comes up with the strangest things...
 
*Yami Malik walks down the stairs, _still_ drying his hair and in a pair of boxers.*
 
Yami Malik: Why hello there, Jounouchi, Seto. Have you by any chance seen what direction my hikari went? *stops drying and runs fingers through hair, then shakes head (AN: Like in those shampoo comercials? Except not as 'hair flingy'. Well, maybe...)
 
Seto: No, why do you ask? We haven't seen him since he went upstairs...Right, Jou? Jou? Are you alright? *waves hand in front of Jounouchi's face*
 
Jounouchi: *eyes glazed over* Caught...on...hook...
 
Seto: Jou?
 
Yami Malik: Well, excuse me, then. I must go find my hikari. *walks away*
 
Jounouchi: Yami...Malik...*gets up and follows Yami Malik*
 
Seto: O...kay. *follows Jounouchi*
 
~~~~~~~~*Cupboard Scene*~~~~~~~~~
 
Bakura: Hey, where's the book? *searches the cupboard frantically* It's not here!
 
Malik: *from outside the cupboard* Hey, yami. Why's Jounouchi hanging off of you like that?
 
Yami Malik: I am not sure, hikari. He is making me feel...quite awkward. Could you please get him away?
 
Yuugi: *making sounds like he's waking up* Ohhh, I just had the most wonderful dream, Malik-chan!
 
Seto: *something drops and makes a thud noise* JOU?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
 
Malik: AAAHHHHH!!! YAMI!!! HELP!!!
 
Bakura: Oh...shit.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chapter 4: Back into the Frying Pan

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yuugi: *blushes* Sorry, Malik-chan! I kinda slipped and, well, you know...

Malik: Well, you didn't have to go THERE!

Yuugi: *still blushing* ...................

Malik: You're not as innocent as you look...

Mariku: *Jounouchi is clinging from him neck* Hikari. I am in need of your assistance.

Malik: Oh come on, yami! You can take care of yourself!

Jounouchi: Mmmmmm, you smell nice...*inhales deeply and snuggles face into Mariku's chest* (AN: Remember, he was dangling from Mariku's neck.)

Mariku: *panicking* But...but...!

Seto: *furious* Jou! How could you?!

Jounouchi: *eyes unglaze* S-Seto?! I can't help myself! I have a compelling urge to hug Malik's yami! Something's happening to -- *eyes glaze over again* What rippling muscles you have, Mariku...you look delicious. *begins sucking hard on Mariku's nipple*

Mariku: *moans at the sensation but quickly recovers* Wha-what are you doing? *tries to push Jounouchi away, but he has a tight grip*

Seto: I can't take this anymore! *grabs Jounouchi off of Mariku* What has gotten into you? You were perfectly fine until we found that...THAT BOOK! *lets go of Jounouchi and dives for the book he dropped*

Malik: *gasps* It's Bakura's book!!!

~~~~~~*Inside Cupboard*~~~~~~~

Bakura: *mumbling* Sure, say it's _my_ book...some friend you are.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Seto: Bakura?! Argh, no wonder! Only he would ever own a book as twisted as this! *flips through pages until he gets to the one he was reading earlier* A-ha! Right here!

The way your wet hair swayed,

I am caught on your hook.

Mariku's hair was still damp! And I heard Jou say, ""I'm caught on your hook"" before he got up and chased after him! *pauses* This is some sick joke, isn't it?

Malik: I'm afraid not. Bakura has already put a spell on Yuugi so that he thinks he's in love with -

Yuugi: I don't think! I _am_ in love with you, Malik-chan! *purrs as he rubs his face on Malik's chest*

Malik: See?

Seto: And how do we reverse the effects? I want my Jou back! (AN: Awwwww...) *turns head* Not again! *pries Jounouchi away from Mariku*

Mariku: *runs to Malik* Do something! Please, hikari!
Yuugi: *jumps out of Malik's arms and faces Mariku, growling* Don't come any closer to _MY_ Malik-chan!

Mariku: *stops, confused* _Your_ Malik-chan?

Yuugi: That's what I said! 

Malik: We have no time for this, Yuugi! Just let him pass!

Jounouchi: *trying to break free from Seto's sleeper hold* Lemme go! KAIBA!!!

Seto: Not until you learn who your master is, puppy!

Jounouchi: ARGH! You bastard! *stomps on Seto's foot and causes him to let go in pain. Jou lunges towards Mariku*

Mariku: Aack!!!

Malik: *runs past Yuugi and grabs Mariku* Yami, quick! Hide in the cupboard and we won't let Jounouchi in! Hurry! *flings open cupboard, not noticing Bakura inside, then shoving his yami in* (AN: I guess the thing was very capacious...*snickers* New vocabulary word...)

Jounouchi: MARIKU!!! *runs right into the closed cupboard*

Seto: *clutching foot* Oohhhh, he's gonna feel that in the morning...

~~~~~~~~*Inside Cupboard*~~~~~~~~~~

*There is a loud 'BANG' noise, then a thump that indicates that someone has fallen to the ground*

Mariku: *talking to himself* I feel cramped...Claustrophobia?!


Bakura: Cupboards aren't supposed to fit two people at a time, you know.

Mariku: *gasps* By Ra! Baku --!!! *is cut off by a hand to the mouth*

Bakura: *whispering* Shut up! Do you want to blow my cover?!

Mariku: *breaks free from Bakura's grip, also whispering* When did you arrive here?

Bakura: When you were taking a shower! Why does it matter?

Mariku: I see your point. Let me rephrase my question: What are you doing here?

Bakura: You're very slow, aren't you?

Mariku: *grabs Bakura's shirt collar (AN: Assume that some light got in through the cracks)* Just answer the damn question. You know I can't stand to talk all grammatically correct and shit! It's just that my hikari thinks I'm becoming more mature when I use formal speech and then he lets me out of that Ra-forsaken rod! 

Bakura: Whoa, chill, my friend. To answer your question, I came here to show you guys this book I found. It's about this big *makes shape with hands* and it has fancy writing on the front, and there's --

Mariku: Yes, I know what you're talking about! Where did you find it?

Bakura: Around.

Mariku: Around?

Bakura: Yeah, it was lying on the ground.

Mariku: Weird.

Bakura: Oh, and get this. The author of the book is firedraygon97. That oughta tell you something.

Mariku: *eyes widening* It's all making sense to me now.

*pounding on the door and ""MARIKU"" being called over and over again*

Bakura: What. Was. That. ?

Mariku: Sssshhhhh, if we're quiet long enough, maybe he'll go away.

Bakura: If you say so. I'm not going out there anyways. They'd tear me limb from limb. Uhhh, how long have we known each other, Mariku?

Mariku: I lost count at 3000 years.

Bakura: Then you wouldn't turn on me, would you?

Mariku: *stares off with a contemplating look on face* It all depends on the situation, my dear friend.

Bakura: *glare* I knew I couldn't count on you.

Mariku: Never could. Do you think I've ever trusted _you_?

Bakura: Alright, I get it, I get it. Sheesh.

*More banging followed by more ""MARIKU""'s on the other side of the door*

Bakura: It seems like we're going to be stuck in here for a long time. Care for a card game? *pulls out rigged deck of regular cards*

Mariku: Only if I'm the dealer. *takes cards, then looks around* Man, I should really get Malik to clean this cupboard up.

~~~~~~~*Outside of Cupboard*~~~~~~~~

Jounouchi: *still pounding on door* MARIKU!!!

Seto: *trying to mess with Jounouchi's head* It's no use, Jou! He's not in there!

Jounouchi: *stops pounding* He's not? 

Malik: I think that crash may have killed what was left of his few brains cells.

Seto: Hey! Even if he _is_ under a spell, he's still _mine_! What would _you_ do if your yami was possessed and went after...ANZU?!

Malik: I think you just went a bit too far there, Kaiba.

Seto: I guess so...but that's beside the point! Don't diss Jou!

Malik: Alright, alright! Don't freak out!

Jounouchi: If Mariku's not in the cupboard...then...*looks at Malik* IT'S YOU, MARIKU! *pushes Yuugi out of the way and glomps Malik*

Malik: GYYAAAAHHHHH!!! What do you think you're doing?!

Yuugi: MALIK-CHAN!!!! *kicks Jounouchi in the back of the knee and causes him to lose balance, pulling Malik down with him*

Jounouchi: Mariku...*suggestive tone*

Yuugi: How dare you! *jumps on top of Malik and Jounouchi* MY MALIK-CHAN! *punches Jounouchi in the face*

Jounouchi: No, it's Mariku!

Yuugi: Malik-chan!

Jounouchi: It's Mariku! See? Would Malik do this? *kisses Malik*

Seto: *horrified* What do you think you're doing, Malik?! *tries to get Jounouchi away, but is caught off guard by a knee to the stomach by Jounouchi. Topples over onto knees*

Malik: *pulls away* It's not me, it's them! *struggles but can't get away*

Yuugi: Oh yeah? Would Mariku do _this_?! *rips off Malik's shirt and presses bodies together, closing in for a kiss*

Jounouchi: It's Mariku! I'll prove it! *pulls Malik away and strips him of his pants. Then begins rubbing up against him* Mmmmm, that's nice...

Yuugi: NO! *tackles Malik away from Jounouchi and begins to forcibly make out with him*

Jounouchi: Why you...! *kicks Yuugi off of Malik and straddles Malik's hips, pinning his arms by his head* We're going to have some fun, Mariku.

Malik: No, not again. Yami. YAMI?! *can't get out from under Jounouchi, begins to thrash around wildly* YAAAAAAMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!

*cupboard door bursts open*

Mariku: *so angry that he's glowing* GET THE FUCK OFF MY HIKARI!!!

Chapter 5: Wishing Hour

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

Jounouchi: *looks up and recognizes the REAL Mariku* MARIKU!!! *jumps up and hugs the aforementioned*
 

Mariku: *pushes Jounouchi off and punches him in the face, knocking him out* Stupid sonuva...*goes to comfort his hikari*
 

Seto: Jou! *gets up off of floor* Oh my goodness, are you alright?! *crushes Jounouchi's face into his chest*
 

Malik: *sobbing and clinging onto Mariku for dear life* Not again...no...
 

Mariku: *caressing Malik's hair* Shhh...it's okay now. I'm here. Everything's okay...
 

Malik: *sniffles* Yami, I was so--
 

Yuugi: Get away from Malik! You...you...you man-whore!
 

Mariku: *turns and glares* Me?! A man-whore?! _I'M_ not the one throwing myself at someone else! Don't you DARE touch MY hikari! *pulls Malik into a protective hold*
 

Yuugi: *pouts but knows when he's beat* He's mine...
 

Seto: Puppy, open your eyes...*slaps Jounouchi on the face a couple times*
 

Mariku: You'd better get him out of my site before I kill his ass.
 

Seto: HEY! You know it was the spell! It wasn't his fault! Which reminds me...*looks over to where the book was originally, only to find it gone* Holy shit! Where did it go?!
 

Mariku: BAKURA! *looks over to the cupboard and sees that it's empty* That fuckin' bastard! *stats to get up to find Bakura*
 

Malik: *whimpers* Don't leave me, yami...
 

Mariku: *softens* I'll never leave you. Where did you get that silly notion? *pulls Malik even closer, if that was possible*
 

Seto: A man can only stomach so much fluff a day.
 

Mariku: *glares daggers at Seto, but continues to 'cuddle' Malik*


Yami: *appears back on the scene* Damnit, I lost him! And just when I was gaining on him. Stupid old lady...
 

Seto: Gyah! Don't sneak up on me like that!
 

Yami: What the hell are you talking about?! I just walked in!
 

Seto: My point exactly!
 

Yami: *sighs and notices Yuugi glaring at Mariku* Hmm, hikari, what's the problem?
 

Yuugi: That. *points* Damn that Mariku. He must be forcing himself onto Malik!
 

Yami: Is that so? *quirks eyebrow*
 

Seto: Insane jealousy and denial...symptoms of an unhealthy relationship. *shakes head*
 

Yuugi: Shut up! Keep your stupid psycho comments to yourself, pansy!
 

Seto: PANSY?! Why I oughta...*about to attack Yuugi when Jounouchi begins to wake up*
 

Jounouchi: *rubbing face* Urgh, my head...
 

Seto: Jou? Jou? Puppy, listen to me. Do you have the urge to make-out with Malik's yami?
 

Jounouchi: Seto, is this some kind of joke? Because it ain't funny. Man, I need some Tylenol...
 

Seto: So you don't want to fling yourself at his gorgeous body? You don't want to go running along the _beach_ together?!

 
Jounouchi: NO! But the way you're saying it, it seems like _you_ do.

 
Seto: Thank you so much! *hugs Jounouchi*

 
Jounouchi: *blushes* Awww, Seto, you know you're the only guy for me. *hugs back*

 
Seto: Eureka! *lets go of Jounouchi and jumps up* I've got it!

 
Yami: Got _what_? A hernia?

 
Seto: Stupid Pharaoh...

 
Yami: Hey, you're stealing the Tomb Robber's lines...

 
Seto: I know you are, but what am I?

 
Yami: *massages temples* Must not kill, must not kill...

 
Seto: As I was say, before I was so RUDELY interrup --

 
Yami: I do not interrupt anybo -- No wait, never mind.

 
Seto: *glares* As I was SAYING: Jounouchi isn't lusting after Mariku anymore!

 
Yuugi: No shit, Sherlock.

 
Seto: I'm ignoring you because this is the spell talking, not you.

 
Yuugi: Go to hell, bastard.

 
Seto: Not listening, not listening...

 
Yami: Hurry up! We don't have all day!

 
Seto: FINE! Now, _why_ would Jou be cured of his...condition?

 
Jounouchi: WHAT condition?!

 
Mariku: Well, he ran into a cupboard door, tried to rape my hikari, and then I knocked him out. Is that about right, hikari? 

 
Malik: Uh huh. *sighs contentedly into Mariku's chest*

 
Jounouchi: I did WHAT?! *faints*

 
Seto: JOU! Oh no, what happened?!

 
Yami: *about to attack* Get on with the freakin' explanation already!

 
Seto: *nervous laugh* Yeah, so Mariku knocked him out, and when he woke up, he was back to normal!

 
Malik: So you're saying that if we knock out _Yuugi_, then he'd be cured?!

 
Seto: Precisely so.

 
Malik: Let's get to --

 
Yami: HOLD ON!

 
Everyone: What?!

 
Yami: You are NOT going to harm Yuugi. As his yami and protector, I would sooner send your souls to the Shadow Realm than let you knock Yuugi out, whether it be for his own good or not! *glares at everyone*

 
Everyone: Eep!

 
Malik: Alright, fine! But if you can't control your hikari, then I have no choice but to use self defense!

 
Mariku: And as _Malik's_ yami and protector, I shall make sure he is not longer 'harassed' by your hikari, even if it requires more violent approaches. *glares back*

 
Yami: Deal. *shakes Mariku's hand*
 

Yuugi: The fuck? You can't make a deal about ME! It's MY life, and I can live it the way _I_ want to! Screw off!

 
Mariku: Remember, Yami, violent approaches.

 
Yami: Hikari! You never used that language before! Why start now?!

 
Yuugi: I thought I told you to SCREW OFF!

 
Seto: Now he's moved onto sudden outbursts and next, violence.

 
Yuugi: *kicks wall* You dumbass wall! Watch where the fuck you're going! I'm gonna kill you! *takes a vase off a table and throws it at the wall, then begins to kick it again*

 
Malik: *sweatdrops* Isis is gonna be soooooo mad...that was her favourite vase...

 
Mariku: Hey! We demand full compensation! Spell or no!

 
Yami: Aibou! Stop it! *grabs Yuugi from behind and pins his arms to his side. Yuugi thrashes around and slams both himself and Yami into the wall*

 
Seto: And I thought _I_ had troubles when Jou was acting up...

 
Yami: Shove it and help!

 
Seto: *sighs* The things I do for Jou's friend's yamis...*gets up and helps Yami subdue Yuugi*

 
Malik: *finally realizes something* Hey, Yami, what did you mean when you said, ""Damnit, I lost him!""? Who did you lose?

 
Yami: *lying on top of Yuugi while Yuugi is kicking wildly with his legs* Hmm? Oh yes, I --Oomph! AIBOU! STOP IT NOW! -- Ahem, I lost Bakura while he was running across the street....

 
*start of flashback*

 
Yami: *running after Ryou* GET BACK HERE, TOMB ROBBER, AND TAKE YOUR BEATING LIKE A MAN!

 
Ryou: *in a perfect imitation of Bakura* Fuck off, idiot-Pharaoh! *evil cackle*

 
Yami: What did you do to my hikari! Answer me!

 
Ryou: Weren't you paying attention earlier?!

 
Yami: Answer the damn question!

 
Ryou: *turns around with tongue sticking out* No. *runs across the street*

 
Yami: Ooohh, I am SO going to get you for that, Tomb Ro --

 
Old Lady: Sonny?

 
Yami: WHAT?!

 
Old Lady: *thwaps Yami with her cane* How rude!

 
Yami: *seething and rubbing side of head* What is it that you'd like, madam?

 
Old Lady: *in a cracked voice* Would a young hoodlum like yourself help a frail old lady across this busy intersection?

 
Yami: *looks to street and sees newspaper blow by like tumbleweed* What are you talking about? The road's not even --

 
Old Lady: *thwaps Yami again* Ahem!

 
Yami: *through clenched teeth* I would _love_ to...*proceeds to help the old lady across the street. By the time they cross, Ryou is long gone*

 
Old Lady: For your services, here. *flicks Yami something*

 
Yami: *catches it* What?! One yen?! I've --

 
Old Lady: *thwaps Yami for a third time* You appreciate it, don't you? *freaky glare*

 
Yami: Eep! Yessum.

 
Old Lady: That's a good lad. *pinches Yami's cheek before walking away*

 
Yami: *scowling* Stupid old lady...Now, where's Bakura?

 
*end flashback*

 
Seto: Hmmm, Bakura...Bakura?! Wait a second! Did you just say that he was here, Mariku?!

 
Mariku: Oh _YEAH_! The coward! He was inside the cupboard!

 
Seto: Alright, we split up and find the bastard! Malik, you and your yami go search downtown! Me and Jou'll go to the park! Yuugi, you --

 
Yuugi: *still thrashing like crazy* Who the hell died and made you the big boss man?!

 
Seto: That would be my adoptive-father...but that's beside the point. You and Yami go to the mall.

 
Yami: I believe you don't see the problem here -- OUCH! STOP! THAT HURTS!

 
Yuugi: Then get offa me!

 
Seto: Alright, fine, YOU TWO go to the park...I'll go to the mall. Come, puppy.

 
Jounouchi: *clutching head* Advil? Tylenol? Morphine? JUST GIVE ME ANYTHING TO MAKE THIS HEADACHE GO AWAY!

 
Seto: *pulls out a bottle of children's cough syrup* Here. This is the stuff Mokuba always takes. Drink until you feel better. *tosses bottle to Jounouchi* (AN: Apparently Seto would fail if he ever went into medicine...)

 
Jounouchi: Ahhh, what the hell. *shrugs and begins to guzzle it down* Mmmmm, grapey. Let's go! *drags Seto off to go to the mall*

 
Malik: *sweatdrops and sighs with the little mushroom breathy thingy* At least the spell's not on him...

 
Mariku: Are you feeling better now?

 
Malik: Hmm?

 
Mariku: Do you still need to hug?

 
Malik: *notices their position, blushes, then pulls away* Heheh, nope. Yeah...let's go downtown, yami! *leaves Yami and Yuugi to their own devices, dragging Mariku along, of course*

 
Yuugi: Hey! HEY! Yeah, I'm talking to you!

 
Mariku: *stops* Who, me?

 
Yuugi: Yes, YOU! DON'T TOUCH MALIK! HE'S MINE! MINE MINEMINEMINEMINE!!!!

 
Mariku: *sweatdrops* Riiiight...*leaves*

 
Yami: Aibou, _why_ can't you just accept the fact that Malik doesn't have the same feelings for you? It's not like it's the end of the --

 
Yuugi: You don't know that! NOBODY KNOWS THAT! Ahahahahhahahaaaaaaaa!!!!!

 
Yami: *sweatdrops* Now, to make sure you don't do anything rash...*takes over Yuugi's body and forces Yuugi into his soul room*

 
Yuugi: /WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?! LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT! LETMEOUTLETMEOUTLETMEOUTLETME--!/ *click*

 
Yami: Ahhhh, much better. Thank Ra for sound proof soul rooms...*gets up and leaves*

 
(Scene change: We see Bakura lurking around in a shadowed alley way. He's holding something in a brown paper bag.)

 
Bakura: *muttering* Stupid firedraygon...I swear I'll kill her...very soon...yes...but first --

 
Ryou: Baku-chan! I found you! *happy squeals* Long time no see! You're lookin' fiiiiiiine! *glomps Bakura* (AN: This is reminding me a lot of Shampoo...)

 
Bakura: *stifles a scream* Ryou! Get off!

 
Ryou: No! *holds onto Bakura even tighter*

 
Bakura: I SAID GET OFF! *grabs Ryou by the hair and jerks him off, throwing him into a wall*

 
Ryou: ...'Kura...? *passes out*

 
Bakura: *looks at Ryou's body for a moment* Awww, fuck it all! Damn pieca...*goes to see if Ryou's alright* Ryou? Wake up, idiot! That didn't even hurt and you know it! Get up!

 
Ryou: *no movement*

 
Bakura: *sighs* What a horrible, horrible day. *picks up Ryou and heads to the nearest medi-clinic, which just happens to be downtown...*

When Lead Female Characters Get Overly Annoying...

Part Twelve: The After-Effects of the Shadow Realm and Other Insanity

Scene: Joey is laughing for no apparent reason as Malik and his yami discuss Yami Bakura's behaviour.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Malik: So, you say that he's been acting like this ever since the incident with the kitten?

Yami Malik: Yes, for about 1600 years now...he used to have such a stable mind...

Yami Bakura: Hey! What are you telling him?!

Yami Malik: Nothing, my friend, nothing at all.

Yami Bakura: If you say so...*starts chewing on arm*

Malik: Uhhh...

Yami Malik: Ignore him, please. *shoo's Malik away from Yami Bakura and towards Joey*

Joey: Hahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahah!!!

Yami Malik: *eyes widen* Oh my...*steers Malik away from the laughing boy*

Kaiba: Argh, you stupid puppy! What the hell is wrong with you?! *slaps Joey a couple times*

Yami Malik: Sometimes the Shadow Realm has that effect on people. Don't worry, he'll calm down in a few minutes.

Kaiba: *looks up to Yami Malik* Who said I was worried?! *more slapping*

Yami Malik: *sweatdrops* No one...*leads his hikari far away from the mentally unstable people*

Pegasus: *takes a swig from a mysterious bottle* An' sos I says, ""Who's ya Momma, boy?"" and he says, ""Nots yous's mista!"" Hee hee hee!

Yami Malik: My light, I suggest we make haste away from these people...Um, Malik? *looks to see that Malik is no longer in his arms* Malik?!

Pegasus: Oohhhh, such a pretty girl...silky softy hair...nice smellings...mmmmmm...*draped over Malik, who is desperately trying to claw his way away* Pretty girlie...

Malik: Help?

Yami Malik: *seeing red* Don't. You. EVER. Call. MY. Light. A. Girl. *grabs Pegasus by the collar and throws him at Tristan, who is busy making a sand castle*

Tristan: *falls onto his sand castle* HEY!

Pegasus: Oohhh, Spike-head is angered...*plays with Tristan's hair*

Tristan: Get away from me!!!! *runs with Pegasus chasing him*


Yami Malik: Hmph. *grabs Malik* Mine.

Malik: *blushes*


*back to where Joey and Kaiba are*


Kaiba: Why *slap* won't *slap* you *slap* stop *slap* LAUGHING?! *slap*

Joey: Haha *slap* ha *slap* ha -- *slap* Hey, quit it -- *slap* AHHH --! *slap*

Kaiba: *slaps Joey a few more times, then stops when realization hits him* You stopped your obnoxious giggling! FINALLY! *hugs the nearest thing to him, which just happens to be Joey*

Joey: *shrill shriek* KAIBA!!! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!

Kaiba: *stiffens* Oh...my...GOODNESS! WHAT AM I DOING?! *pushes himself off Joey and runs into the ocean to 'cleanse' himself*

Joey: ...and don't come back! Ugh. *brushes invisible dirt off his clothes*


*on the boat*


Bakura: So, tell me about your -- *leans over rail and vomits* urrgghhhh...day.

Yami: What's there to say?

Bakura: Ummm, okay...what do you think of Tea?

Yami: *sees image of Tea* Do you WANT me to go on a raging killing spree?

Bakura: Considering I'm the only other person present...no.

Yami: *image starts to waver* Good.

Bakura: *uncomfortable shifting*

Yami: *glaring at his mental projection of Tea* Rot in hell, bitch...

Bakura: *more fidgeting* I better go see if the oven is on...

Yami: You do that. *goes back to projection* Oh yes, and I won't forget to set your hair on fire...fiiiiiiiiiiire...hair...fire...Oh, Ryyyyyo~ou!

Bakura: *runs away* //YAMI!!!//


*on island*


Yami Bakura: Mmmmm, needs salt -- Huh? Aibou? /Is that you?/

Bakura's Voice: //Help me! Yami Yugi's going CRAZY!!!//

Yami Bakura: /How?/

Bakura's Voice: //Just get over here!//

Yami Bakura: /Alright, I'm coming./ *flash of light. Suddenly Yami Bakura is on the boat beside Bakura* Why, hello there!

Yami: Fiiiiiiiiire...*looks at Ryou like he's a slab of meat*


Yami Bakura: Hey, that's MY line! And that's MY aibou! *pushes Bakura behind him and growls at Yami*

Yami: Well, I wouldn't be going crazy right now if HE *points at Bakura* didn't let that stupid BITCH take MY *jerks thumb towards himself* aibou!

Yami Bakura: It's not his -- Waitasecond here...*turns to Bakura* You let Friendship Lady take the Pharaoh over there's brat?

Bakura: Ummm...

Yami Bakura: Just answer the question! It's a simple yes or no!

Bakura: Uhhh, yes?

Yami: I TOLD you! I TOLD YOU!

Yami Bakura: My, my, my...you've made me proud, aibou.

Bakura and Yami: *turn to Yami Bakura* WHAT?!

Yami Bakura: Well...it's probably because you were too chicken to do anything about it, but that's the way I like you!

Bakura: *blushes* I don't know what you're talking about...


Yami: SO YOU'RE SUPPORTING HIM?! THAT'S IT! YOU ALL DIE! *lunges at Yami Bakura*

Bakura: Not so fast!

Yami: *halts in mid-air* Huh?

Bakura: Uh...if you kill us, then how will...um...you know where...you know where...where Yugi, uh, left his note to you?

Yami: Yugi left me a note?! Where is it, damn you! *pushes Yami Bakura aside and hold Bakura up by the collar*

Bakura: Can't...breathe...//Distraction, yami!//

Yami: Tell me where it is! *shakes Bakura*

Yami Bakura: That's it. Now it's personal. *jumps on top of Yami and begins strangling him*

Yami: It's a conspiracy I tell you! A conspiracy! *gag* Get offa me!!!

Yami Bakura: Not until you're dead!

Yami: Well, I'm already dead! So get off!

Yami Bakura: You win, alri --! Hey! You gotta let me rephrase that!

Yami: Screw you! *kicks Yami Bakura off*

Yami Bakura: DAMN YOU, PHARAOH! THOSE WERE DESIGNER PANTS! *starts a dust war*

Bakura: //Thanks.//

Yami Bakura: /No Prob. TAKE THAT, COCKY BASTARD!/

Bakura: *winces* Now to get to work. *pulls out a piece of paper and pencil and starts writing*


Dear Yami,

As you already know, the evil bitch, Tea, has me in her oily grasp. You can only save me if:

            a)	You don't set Bakura's hair on fire.

            b) You stop fighting with Yami Bakura.

            c) You *lead breaks because of Yami's Bakura's mental screams*

Yami Bakura: /OH MY RA! HE BIT ME! HE BIT MY ARM! AHHHHHHH!!!/

            c)	You CALM DOWN.

Yami Bakura: /WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?! EAT ME?!/

Yami: Mmmm, salty...

Bakura: *glares and takes out yet another pencil, but this one doesn't even get a chance to write before it is crushed into fine powder*

Yami Bakura: /DON'T EVEN GO THERE, PHARAOH!!!/

Bakura: THAT'S IT! *takes out a pen and writes*

            d)	You do WHATEVER Bakura tells you to do. NO BUTS!

Love, your ever so cute aibou,

Yugi *with little hearts all around*


Yami Bakura: /Aibou! He's EATING me!/

Bakura: *growls* STOP IT!

*dust fight stops*

Yami: *is shown chewing on Bakura's arm* What?! *realizes his position and stiffens*

Bakura: Here's your damn note! Now get off MY yami! *kicks Yami off of Yami Bakura*

Yami Bakura: *holding up his slobbery arm* Eewwww...

Yami: *gets up quickly* The note! Where's the note?!

Bakura: Here. *hands Yami the note, then goes to take care of his yami's injuries*

Yami: *eyes move back and forth across the page* Argh, damnit! Bakura, get over here! 

Bakura: NOW WHAT?!

Yami: I can't read this.

Yami Bakura: Hahahaha! Don't tell me the Pharaoh's illiterate! This is rich!

Yami: Oh yeah? Well then, let's see YOU read this! *shoves note into Yami Bakura's face*

Yami Bakura: Ahaha, erm, now listen closely! *clears throat. All the spellings are how Yami Bakura pronounces it*

When Lead Female Characters Get Overly Annoying...

Part Six: Sometimes 8 Just Isn't Enough

Scene: Tea (AN: that bitch) has just jumped out of the plane with Yugi. Yami is having a nervous breakdown.


Yami: M-m-my aibou... (AN: Yami not jumping out after them is all part of my twisted plot, just so you know.)

Kaiba: Snap out of it, Yami! Yugi knew that his plan was risky! 

Yami: Yu....gi..... 

Kaiba: Sheesh! Get a hold of yourself! Like I always say, sacrifices must be made!

Yami: What. Did. You. Just. Say?!

Kaiba: I said, Sheesh! Get a hold of yourself! Like I --

Yami: I know what you said, fool! You're just as bad as Yami Bakura!

Kaiba: Am not!

Yami: Are too!

Kaiba: Not!

Yami: Too -- Enough of this! How would you feel if it was Mokuba, instead of Yugi, that Tea grabbed?!

Kaiba: *face drains of colour* Mo...ku...ba...

Yami: Now you get it, don't you?!

Kaiba: *lifeless, not controlling the helicopter* Mo...ku...ba...

Yami: What the hell are you _doing_?! We're going crash! Get a grip! KAIBA!

Kaiba: Mo --

Yami: Damnit! *shoves Kaiba to the back and tries to fly 'Marie'. A very bad idea because the helicopter begins to nose dive.* I'm pushing up! UP! Why isn't it going UP?!

Kaiba: *snaps out of trance* Oh hey, Ya -- bloody hell! Are you crazy?!

Yami: No, and it's not my fault I never learned how to pilot a helicopter!

Kaiba: Push the joystick down! DOWN!

Yami: Now you tell me! *pushes down a bit too hard and snaps the stick* Uh oh...

Kaiba: *sweatdrops* Don't worry, I installed an emergency system --

*A blinking noise is heard, signalling that the fuel tank was almost empty.*

Yami: Why didn't you fill the stupid tank before we left?!

Kaiba: I forgot my coupon at home!

Yami: You're the CEO of Kaiba Corp! How stingy can you be?!

Kaiba: Very. But that doesn't matter now, 'cause we're all gonna die...

*The helicopter is plunging downwards to Yami and Kaiba's 'certain' deaths. Meanwhile...*

Pegasus: I told you to keep an eye on the helicopter! What got you so distracted?!

Joey: Mmmmm, sandwiches in your cooler...

Pegasus: Stay away from those! They're mine! *tries to take sandwiches from Joey and steer the boat at the same time*

Joey: Keep your eye on the road!

Pegasus: There isn't a road and give me the sandwiches!

Bakura: Hey! I think I see the helicopter! Over there! *points towards a shape in the sky*

Yami Bakura: That _can't_ be them! That thing's falling!

Tristan: *with binoculars* Yeah, that's them alright! But I don't see Tea or Yugi!

Yami Bakura: Gimme those! *grabs binoculars from Tristan* By Ra, he's right! What is going on?!

Pegasus: Tea's gone, you say? Well, my job here is done. *turns the boat around*

Tristan: You're just going to leave them stranded?!

Pegasus: Yes.

Tristan: *takes sandwiches from Joey* What if I did...this? *takes a bite out of one*

Joey: Hey!

Pegasus: *gives Tristan a glare* You bastard... *turns boat around again and heads in the direction of the falling aircraft*

Tristan: Oh yeah, who the man?

Yami Bakura: Definately not you. *is eating a sandwich* Hmmm, not bad, but the bread is kinda stale...

Bakura: *also eating a sandwich* And the bologna _could_ be better...

Pegasus: *defeated* At least save me one, please?

*Change scene to a large fishing boat. The net is hoisted up, and in it is Yugi.*

Fisherman 1: Yo, get over here!

Fisherman 2: What kind of fish is that?!

Fisherman 1: *backhands fisherman 2* Are you stupid?! That's a kid!

Fisherman 2: How much do you think he'll be worth?

Fisherman 1: *another backhand* Just shut up!

*The two fishermen get Yugi out of the net and onto the deck, where they prod at him to check if he's alive*

Fisherman 2: Doubt he's dead on account of the way his chest is rising and falling.

Fisherman 1: *backhand* I can see that! Now do something useful and get the Captain!

Captain: *just walked out of captain's quarters (AN: The boat's big, but not that big.)* Get me for what? 

Both Fishermen: Captain Malik! (AN: I know, I know, they don't meet Malik until way later, but just pretend they did, for the sake of this fic.)

Malik: What's going on here? What -- *sees Yugi* Yugi! *runs to him*

Fisherman 1: We found him in one of our nets.

Malik: *checking for pulse* Good, he's alive. Let's bring him to my room so he can rest.

*The fishermen carry Yugi and follow Malik to his room. Yugi begins to regain consciousness. They put Yugi on Malik's bed.* (AN: Eeeeeewwww, fishy...)

Malik: Hey, Yugi, are you alright? Speak to me, dude.

Yugi: *groggily* Owwww, my head....wait. I'm still alive?

Malik: How do you feel? And how did you get here anyways?

Yugi: *finally realizes who's talking to him* Malik! Great to see you again! Ummm, where am I?

Malik: You're on my fishing boat!

Yugi: Fishing boat?! What the?! When did this happen?! Am I hallucinating?

Malik: Yes, a fishing boat, about 3 months ago, and no, you're not hallucinating.

Yugi: But...why?

Malik: I always wanted to be a fisherman. To sail the seas, looking for only the best fish available. Now, I'm the owner of this fine ship, Captain, and my yami is First Mate. Ahhhh, life couldn't be better... *smiles and stares into the distance*

Yugi: *sits up and slowly edges away* That's, um, great! I'm really happy for you!

Malik: Stop, Yugi! Don't try and move yet! We don't know if anything is broken or dislocated!

Yugi: The only part of me that hurts is my head. I think the fish broke my fall.

Malik: You're head? That may be serious! Lay back down! Huh? You fell into the net?!

Yugi: *lays down* Oh yeah, I better explain what's been going on...

*Yugi goes into a detailed explanation of how they turned on Tea, right to when she jumped with him out of the helicopter.*

Yugi: ...and that's what happened.

Malik: Wow! I always knew this day would come! Too bad I wasn't around for when Tea fell off the roof!

Yami Malik: *pops head in door and is wearing a cute little sailor get-up* Tea fell off the roof?! Hahahaha! *clears throat* By the way, we've spotted a small island up ahead. Most of the crew votes that we stop there for a break. How bout it?

Malik: Sure, sure, I guess I _am_feeling a little land-sick.

Yugi: *excited* Maybe it's the Duelist Kingdom!

Malik: Doubt it. I think we passed that a while ago.

Yugi: Darn it. Oh well, I just hope Tea wasn't lucky enough as me to survive the fall.

Malik: You and me both.

*Malik's 'fishing boat' is headed towards the island. On the island...*

Kaiba: *soaking wet* We're pretty lucky that this island was nearby.

Yami: *also soaking wet* Lucky. LUCKY?! And do you call running out of gas right after the controls snap _lucky_?! Not only are we stranded on this stupid island, but now there's no way in hell we'll be able to rescue my aibou! I'm going to KILL you! *lunges at Kaiba*

Kaiba: *runs* Wait Yami! This is just your survival instinct kicking it! Resist it! Resist!

Yami: I'll show you survival instinct! *chases after Kaiba*

Kaiba: *runs for dear life* HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLP!

*Scene changes to the Pegasus's speed boat.*

Yami Bakura: Whoa! Did you _see_ that?! The helicopter just exploded in the water!

Bakura: If I didn't know better, I'd say it was a scene from a movie they were filming from that island!

Joey: *scans horizon* Island? Where?

Tristan: Over there, idiot! *points to island directly in front of the boat*

Joey: Oh, heh, heh...

Pegasus: We're going to stop there for a break. I'm getting hungry and I want my sandwich!

Tristan: I don't think that's possible.

Pegasus: Why not?!

Tristan: Yami Bakura ate the last one.

Pegasus: He. Ate. My. LAST. Sandwich?! DIE! *forgets about steering and turns to strangle Yami Bakura*

Yami Bakura: *face turning blue* Aack! Tristan! I'll get you for this!

Tristan: Crap! Pegasus! Leave him alone and steer this thing! Oh no! We're gonna crash into the beach!

Everyone on board: *looks straight ahead* AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!

*The speed boat hits the sand and stops when it comes in contact with a palm tree. All the passengers are sent flying into the air.*

Bakura: *lands on his back* Ooooofph!

Yami Bakura: *does a flip and lands on his feet* My aibou is so ungraceful...

Pegasus: *smashed into the tree trunk and talking dazedly to it* Cheerio! Old chap, how has it been? Afternoon tea? I'd be delighted to!

Tristan and Joey: *sprawled on the ground* Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

Yami Bakura: Scratch that, all of you are ungraceful...

Bakura: *throws a coconut at Yami Bakura* Just shut up...

Yami Bakura: *fake tears in his eyes* My hikari just threw a coconut at me and told me to shut up...

Bakura: *gets up* Awww, you know I didn't mean it. *goes and gives Yami Bakura a big hug*

Yami Bakura: *shocked* What are you --? Ahhh, to hell with it...*returns hug* Hmmm, not bad...

Joey: Hey! What're you two doing?!

Yami Bakura: None of your business! *kicks sand into Joey's face*

Joey: My eyes!

Yami Bakura: Mwahaha!

Bakura: Seriously, yami, you can be _so_ mean sometimes...

Yami Bakura: *suggestively* Oh come on, you know you like it.

Bakura: *blushes* W-what are you saying?!

Yami Bakura: Bakura...I guess I'm trying to say that I --

Pegasus: *now fully recovered from hitting the tree* Prepare to die! *dives at Yami Bakura* I will never forgive you for eating my food!

Yami Bakura: SHIT! *turns to run when...*

Bakura: *steps in the way and acts entirely un-Bakura-like* Arrrrggghhhhhhhh! You just ruined our hard earned fluff moment! Who knows when our next one will be! *flames erupt  behind him* (AN: Yes, yes, who knows...)

Pegasus: Eeeep! Mommy! *runs...straight into Kaiba*

Pegasus: *holds head* That hurt...

Kaiba: *holding his head also* Don't be such a baby -- Aaaaack! *is getting beat to a bloody pulp by Yami*

Joey: *has just washed sand out of eyes* Huh? What just happened? When did Kaiba and Yami get here?

Yami: *beating the crap out of a semi-conscious Kaiba when he realizes everybody's watching* Uhhh, hi.

Tristan: *finally up* Hey, so how'd the plan go? Where's Yugi?

Yami: *starts bawling* My poor, sweet, little, gentle, *sob* kind, innocent, aibou...

Tristan: *sweatdrops* Uh, care to explain, Kaiba?

Kaiba: *painfully* Only if you keep this pint-sized sissy of a former pharaoh away from me.

Joey: *snickering* For being so pint-sized and a sissy, he sure whooped your ass good!

Kaiba: Shut up, chihuahua.

*Kaiba tells them what happened while Yami Bakura restrains the hysterical Yami*

Bakura: So you're telling us that Yugi is probably floating lifelessly somewhere waiting for a shark to come and eat him?!

Kaiba: Pretty much it, yeah.

Pegasus: *recovered* That's absurd! I see him right over there on that battleship! *points to Malik's ship on the other side of the beach*

Tristan: That blow must've rattled your brains! That's not a battleship! That's a fishing ship!

Yami Bakura: *looking through binoculars* Yeah, that's just a fishing ship!

Yami: Let me see! *rips binoculars out of Yami Bakura's hands and looks through. He sees Yugi hanging onto the railing, looking sick.* 
I'm coming, aibou! *begins running to the ship*

Yami Bakura: I'm afraid the poor boy has lost it.

Bakura: Oh well, wouldn't hurt to see if the people on there can help us out! *begins running after Yami*

Yami Bakura: Stupid aibou... *follows Bakura*

*Everyone else follows too.*

Yami: *only a little ways away from the ship*Aaaaaaaaaaaaaiboooooooooooooooooooooooooooooou!

Yugi: *jerks head up and brightens* Yami! You're here!

Yami: *now up by the ship. The 'fishermen' have lowered the ramp and Yami runs up it* Aibou! You're okay! *hugs Yugi in a death grip*

Yugi: I won't be if you don't let go...

Yami: *blushes* Sorry...

Bakura: *from on the beach* Yugi! So good to see you alive!

Yugi: Same here!

Yami Bakura: *menacingly* If it isn't my good friend, Yami Malik...

*Sure enough, Yami Malik and Malik both walk out to where Yami and Yugi are.*

Yami Malik: *gives an if-looks-could-kill glare* Yami Bakura... 

*Everyone backs away from the two as the tension rises*

Yami Bakura: *smirks* Long time no see!

Yami Malik: *grins* Ditto!

*Everyone sweatdrops.*

Yami: So aibou, what happened?

Yugi: About 3 seconds after Tea jumped, she fell asleep and I managed to push away from her. I landed in the water, but miraculously, I didn't die on impact, and Malik's fishing net picked me up. 

Yami: *once again, the green-eyed monster rears it's ugly head. He looks over Malik.* Oh, so you were with _him_ the entire time.

Yugi: *still quite oblivious* Don't worry, Yami! Malik's really nice! He even let me rest in his bed!

Yami: *left eye twitching furiously* You were in his bed?

Yugi: Yeah, I was kinda sore and groggy when I woke up after, but when I saw him and realized I was in his bed, I remembered exactly what happened!

Yami: What?!

Yugi: He took care of me really good!

Yami: *appalled* I don't believe it. *visciously at Malik* How dare you? How _DARE_ you?! To take advantage of an innocent after he's been through such a horrible ordeal! I swear, by Ra's holy name, that I shall kill you with my bear hands! *lunges at Malik*

Yugi: No, Yami!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part Seven: The End for Tea?

Scene: Yami is trying to strangle Malik to death while everyone is watching.


Yami: You unshameful bastard! *choke-slams Malik into the deck boards*

Malik: *pained voice* H-help me! 

Yugi: *gets between Yami and Malik* What're you doing, Yami?!

Yami: Get out of my way! Why are you trying to protect him?!

Yugi: Because he helped me! Now, calm down, Yami! *Yami seems to calm down slightly*

Joey: *with some popcorn* Awwww, and this was just about to get good, too...

Tristan: *holding a cup of pop* Yugi! We're bored! We want to see a fight!

Yugi: You guys! If you wanna see fighting, order wrestling from Pay Per View!

Joey: Come on, Yug! You know that stuff is all fake! *grabs Tristan's pop and takes a sip. Then sprays it out all over the place.* You know who this is, don'tcha Tristan? (AN: If you haven't ever watched WWE, this is what Triple H usually does when he comes into the ring to wrestle. It's implied that he's Tristan's favourite wrestler.)

Tristan: *embarrassed but mad* Oh yeah?! At least I don't like *bends down and picks up a handful of sand, then slowly stands up while movings hands up body and breathing in deeply* Gold Dust! *opens hand and blows it at everybody*

Joey: *also embarrassed* Lies! I _do not_ like Gold Dust!

Tristan: And you owe me some more pop!

Joey: Hey! I bought it for you in the first place!

Tristan: No! I did!

Joey: That's it! *punches Tristan*

Tristan: *holds jaw* Why you--! *dust fight breaks out*

Bakura: At least they got their fight.

Yugi: *turns and looks at a seething Yami in the eyes* (AN: Well, you know what I mean...maybe he was on tippy toes.) Now Yami, how come you started attacking Malik?

Yami: *blushes under close scrutiny and stammers* I, uh, it's just that...

Malik: *finally understands situation* You thought that I....hahahaha, that's a good one, Yami!

Yami Malik: I don't get it.

Malik: *whispers in Yami Malik's ear* when he said....then he said....get it?

Yami Malik: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh...Nope.

Malik: You're as hopeless as Yugi.

Yugi: Someone say my name?

*Everyone else except Joey and Tristan sweatdrops.*

Malik: It's okay Yami! I didn't, you know, with him, don't worry!

Yami: How can I be so sure?

Malik: Care you ask Yugi?

Yugi: *completely oblivious* (AN: That guy's like that most of the time anyways.) Ask me what? What do you want, Yami?

Yami: *eyes widen* Eeeerrrrr, heheh, let's just forget about this one, okay aibou? And sorry about earlier, Malik. No hard feelings? *extends hand*

Malik: *shakes Yami's hand* No hard feelings.

Pegasus: I still say it's a battleship.

Kaiba: Shut up already! It's a fishing boat!

Malik: *gasps* You can tell?!

Yami Malik: But I disguised it perfectly! Even down to the costumes and scripts!

Pegasus: Well, you _do_ have the name ""Destroyer 615"" written in red on the side.

Malik: Damn. I didn't think it'd be that obvious.

Yami Malik: We've failed the mission.

Joey: *stops fighting with Tristan* What the hell're you talking about?!

Tristan: *gets in a cheap punch* Yeah! Are you trying to tell us that your boat isn't a fishing boat but actually a battleship?!

Yami Malik: *suddenly appears by in front of Tristan and pulls him up by the collar* _Who_ told you?!

Tristan: *sweatdrops* Uh, you guys were talking out loud...

Yami Malik: Malik! I told you we should've went to see a professional about this!

Yami Bakura: *looking through binoculars* Quiet, everyone! I *Everyone looks to where Yami Bakura is pointing the binoculars.* I don't believe this...

Everyone: What?!

Yami Bakura: It's, it's, it's...

Yami: *freaking out* It can't be! She dead! She's DEAD!

Yugi: My plan was almost flawless! She can't be alive!

Yami Bakura: Well, I was going to say that I saw a Good Year blimp, but now that you mentioned it, I think I see Tea swimming this way...

Yami: By Ra, why won't she DIE?!

Kaiba: I've had enough of this. Hey, Malik!

Malik: Yeah, what?

Kaiba: You say this is a battleship, right? So you must have some kind of fire power, like torpedos or cannons.

Malik: Yeah, but what are you trying to say?

Yami Malik: *appears in front of Malik and backhands him* Jeez, you ninny! He's saying we should blast her out of the water!

Malik: Hey! I'm the Captain! You're not allowed to backhand me!

Yami Malik: You needed it!

Malik: Fine, whatever. But we can't go against the Motherland's orders. We're not allowed to open fire until we pass into the Indian Ocean.

Kaiba: Forget the Motherland! We have to kill her for the sake of every living thing! Do you understand?!

Malik: How could you say that?! The Motherland is --!

Kaiba: How much are they paying you?

Malik: $9.50 an hour. But what does--!

Kaiba: If you and your crew fire at Tea, I'll give you all jobs at Kaiba Corp. at $9.75 an hour, plus benefits!

Malik: *flings off cheesy fisherman get up, underneath is his usual garb* Up anchor, men!

Yami Malik: *also changes into usual attire* You heard him! Let's go! *presses hidden button and fishing boat suddenly 'transforms' into a deadly battleship, equip with gleaming missile heads and heavy machine guns*

Yugi: Awesome! A BF-134! It's a new model! (AN: I just made up that...)

Malik: Wow, you can tell?

Yugi: Didn't you know? I'm an expert at war machines!

*Everyone sweatdrops*

Malik: Hey! 'Destroyer 615' isn't _just_ a war machine!

Kaiba: That reminds me...poor, poor Marie...

*Bigger sweatdrops*

Yami Malik: Alright! We're all set! Who wants to come along?

Yugi: Ooohhh! Me! Me!

Yami Malik: Anyone else?

*Joey and Tristan are at it again while Bakura and Yami Bakura watch. Pegasus is reffing the fight and Kaiba is mourning over his dearly departed helicopter.*

Yami: I'll go to protect my aibou.

Yami Malik: That's it? Okay! We're off!

*Ship turns around and sails a bit from shore, then stops and gets ready to aim guns.*

Deck Hand 1 (originally Fisherman 1): Locked on target.

Deck Hand 2 (originally Fisherman 2): Ready to fire on order, Captain.

Yugi: Oooooooooooohhhh! Can I say it? Can I? Can I please?

Malik: But saying it is my favourite part!

Yugi: *to Yami with huge puppy eyes* Awwww, come on Yami! Can I paweeese?

Malik: But _I'm_ the Captain!

Yami: *glares at Malik* Let him say it!

Malik: Eeep! Fine!

Yugi: *hugs Yami* Thanks!

Yami: *blushes* N-nothing to it! Heheheh...

Malik: You should be thanking me!

Yugi: You're right. *lets go of Yami and hugs Malik instead* You're the best!

Yami: *left eye twitching* 10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...

Yugi: *lets go before Yami blows a gasket* FIRE! 

Deck Hand 1: Target annihilated.

Deck Hand 2: Confirmed.

Malik: Alright! We did it!

Yami: Yes! Finally!

Yugi: Yay! Let's head back!

Yami Malik: Affirmative!

Malik: _I'm_ the Captain!

Yami: *glares* What was that?

Malik: Eeep! Nothing!

*Ship goes back to the others. On shore...*

Joey: *beat up* Did they do it?!

Tristan: *also beat up* Please say yes.

Pegasus: Whoohoo! She's gone!

Kaiba: How the hell would you know? *sniff* Marie...

Pegasus: I can read minds.

Kaiba: *forgets about Marie* Ah ha! So _that's_ how you were winning!

Pegasus: Whoops. Oh well, your brother will get his soul back, because she's dead!

Kaiba: True, true.

Yami Bakura: *again with binoculars* I think I see her still...

Bakura: What?! Impossible!

Yami Bakura: No, she's still swimming towards us, and I think I see a fin floating in the water...Yup, it's definately her.

Bakura: Well, we've got to signal to them to turn around and try again!

Joey: I'm with ya!

Tristan: Yeah!

*Bakura, Joey, and Tristan start dancing around, waving their arms, screaming and trying to gesture for the crew to look behind them. On the ship...*

Yugi: Hey, look! I think they're congradulating us!

Yami: Well, of course they are! We just killed Tea!

Malik: Umm...I don't think they're celebrating...

Yami Malik: It looks more like they're trying to tell us something...

*Finally get close enough to hear the others*

Joey: ...behind you!

Tristan: ...turn around!

Bakura: ...not dead yet!!!!

Joey: *blinks* Wow, you're pretty loud when you want to be.

Bakura: *sweatdrops* Eheheheheh...yeah...

Yugi: Pardon?! Are you trying to tell us something?!

Bakura: YES!!! LOOK OVER THERE!!! *points*

*Everyone on board looks to where Bakura is pointing and are shocked to see...*

Tea: *sputtering out water and soaking wet, trying to stand up in the shallow water* Hey guys! *cough* You're all here! I knew I could count on you, _my friends_! (AN: Hmmmm, Tea can swim faster than a boat...)

Kaiba: I guess she wasn't kidding when she said she was an expert swimmer...

Pegasus: Gadzooks! She survived the impact, the swim, and the gunshots! She can't be human!

Kaiba: Yes, yes, we've already concluded that a few chapters back...

Pegasus: Will you stop being so calm?!

Tea: *already next to the gang* Thanks guys!

Bakura: Huh? For what?

Tea: For shooting the shark away, silly!

Everybody, including the one's on the ship: WHAT?!

Bakura: We try to kill her but end up saving her...how ironic.

Yami Bakura: *smacks Bakura* Stop trying to sound all philosophical!

Bakura: It's not my fault! I can't help it!

Tea: And Yugi! *Yugi's back on land and she goes and hugs him* Thanks for pushing me away from the rocks! When I woke up, I was still falling and I noticed that you and I were on opposite sides of a coral reef! (AN: Okay, okay, I know I didn't say anything about a coral reef before, but whatever.)

Yugi: *drops to his knees after Tea lets go* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! *somehow birds fly into the air from trees that magically appeared*

Tea: And because of that, I don't love Yami anymore! I love you, Yugi! *huggles Yugi while he is still in shock*

Yami: Get away from him! He's _my_ aibou!

Tea: *ignoring Yami's remarks* Why didn't I see it before? Of course Yugi is the one for me! He's just so cute and kind and smart...*continues to squeeze Yugi in her hug*

Yami: AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Stop it! The humanity! Someone! Do something!! (AN: I couldn't make Yami hit a girl...)

Tea: You love me, don't you, Yugi? 'Cause I love you lots!

Yugi: *still in shock* Yeah, sure, whatever...

Tea: Hooray! *kisses Yugi on the lips*

Yami: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

*Bakura passes out and Yami Bakura catches him. Everyone else sweatdrops.*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part Eight: Kidnapped

Scene: Tea has just kissed Yugi (on the lips!) and Yami is trying to fight against the 'Never Hit Girls' instinct. Bakura passed out but Yami Bakura caught him.


*Tea breaks the kiss and we see Yugi's petrified face.*

Tea: Awwww, don't you look cute my little, itty, bitty snuggle-muffin? *huggles Yugi*

Yugi: *finally out of state of shock* Get away from me! *struggles to get out of hug but to no avail* Yami! Help me! She's suffocating me!

Yami: Born-instinct or not, I can't ignore a distress call from my aibou! Die, bitch!

Kaiba: *grabs Yami's arm* No! She's mine!

Yami: *eyes widen* What are you saying?!

Kaiba: *realizes what he's just said* I didn't mean it that way! Get you mind out of the gutter!

Yami: *lets out a breath* Well, that's a relief...

Yugi: *turning purple* Guys!!!!

Yami: Get out of my way, Kaiba!

Kaiba: As I was trying to say before, I get to do the honours! *hurls Yami behind and rushes to Tea, but gets tripped by Pegasus*

Pegasus: Foolish boy, the wench is mine! *runs towards Tea but is tackled by Tristan*

Tristan: Over my dead body!

Joey: *punches Tristan* Sorry bud, but I've known her longest second to Yugi, and I don't think he's in any position to do anything, so in all fairness I believe I should get to kill her.

Yami Bakura: *has put Bakura's unconscious form down and is getting into the brawl* Fairness, shmairness! I should get to kill her because it might be the last evil act I do!

Yami: Why I oughtta...

*huge dust fight starts, arms and legs thrash around everywhere*

Malik: *looks at his yami* Well?

Yami Malik: *shrugs* Why not?

*the Egyptians join the fight. Meanwhile...*

Tea: *loosens grip on Yugi so that he can breathe* Aren't they so sweet? They're fighting over who gets to come congratulate us first!

Yugi: *looking for a way of escape* I don't think that's the case, Tea... *sees Bakura waking up* Bakura! Yo, Bakura! Over here! Help me!

Tea: So I was thinking, when should our wedding be? Sometime this month? Naaaahhhh, that's too early. I want it to be a shining occasion! Something that would empty most people's life savings and leave them to die in the streets! Oh, and who do you think we should invite to the wedding? Of course our families and friends! And who do you want your best man to be?

Yugi: *panics* BAKURA! HELP!

Tea: Hmmm, I thought you'd choose Yami...but Bakura's nice! Good choice! Hey, I see him over there, so why don't all three of us go onto the ship and we can talk about our plans! *drags Yugi over to Bakura*

Bakura: Crap, this is going to take forever to wash all this sand out of my hair...

Tea: *puts a hand on Bakura's shoulder* Bakura!

Bakura: Aaack! Oh, you shouldn't sneak up on me like -- Aack! Tea! Eheheh, what a pleasant surprise! What brings you here?

Tea: Yugi and I are getting married! *squeezes Yugi, who is desperately trying to claw his way away*

Yami: *sticks his head out of dust* WHAT?!

Bakura: *eyes bulge out of sockets* You're _what_?!

Tea: Yeah, and we need your help on the preparations! Come on! *grabs Bakura's arm and drags him and Yugi to the ship*

Yami Bakura: *also sticks head out of dust* Hey! Where are you taking them?!

Tea: *dancing her way there* We're off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz! Lala, lala, la lala...Follow the yellow brick road, heehee!

Yami: Oh no! This 'Wizard of Oz' seems very powerful! He must be the one who supplies Tea with all her evil! We have to stop them!

Yami Bakura: Well, if the wizard fellow even lays on finger on my Bakura...

Yami: Pardon? Did you just say _your_ Bakura?

Yami Bakura: Shut up, that is none of your business! *both get pulled back into dust fight*

*Tea, with her captives, has made her way on board and frightened the deck hands to abandon ship with her horrid singing and dancing skills*

Tea: ...Falalalala lala la la! T'is the -- Hey, where did everyone else go?

Bakura: Noooo! They were trained boatmen! How could they flee like that?! Cowards!

Yugi: You have to admit, this beats listening to her friendship speeches...

Tea: What was that, sweety? You want to hear my friendship speech, number 253.1c?

Yugi: *sweatdrops* No, no, that's quite alright, _dear_. Uh, weren't we supposed to talk about wedding plans?

Tea: Oh, that's right! But...

Bakura: *irritated* What?!

Tea: Yugi hasn't proposed properly yet! 

Bakura: Is that all?

Tea: You don't understand! The proposal is supposed to be just as important as the wedding! I need a beautiful sunset! A beach! Some doves! Yugi's supposed to get down on one knee and recite a ballad before he tells me how much he loves me and then --

Bakura: Seems like you've thought this through quite thoroughly --

Tea: ...He'll take a box out of this pocket and open it and inside will be an engagement ring with a diamond the size of my fist and then he'll say, ""Tea, my love, will you make me the happiest man ever to exist and marry me? Be mine, forever?"" and I'll say, ""Yes, yes, I will marry you, Yugi!"" and then he'll put the ring on my finger and he'll get up and kiss me passionately and then he'll carry me off to our specially rented hotel suite where we'll --

Bakura: Too much information! Too much information! My ears!

Tea: But I'm not finished yet --

Bakura: Yes! Yes, you are! If you never speak again it will be too soon!

Tea: Pardon?

Bakura: *grabs Yugi and drags him from Tea* I need to talk to the future groom!

Tea: Alright! But don't take too long!

Bakura: *already walking away* I won't, bitch!

Tea: Isn't that sweet! I just love doggies!

Bakura: *slaps his forehead* Nevermind...Anywho, Yugi!

Yugi: *eyes still popping out of his head from Tea's explicit ramblings* I think I'm gonna be scarred for life...

Bakura: Snap out of it! We don't have any time! *slaps Yugi* It's all in your head! It's all in your head!

Yugi: *rubbing pinkish cheek* Ooowwww...Thanks, Bakura. I needed that.

Bakura: Now, do you think you can do all of what she just said?

Yugi: Are you mad?! Look at her! *points to where Tea used to be, except now she's gone* Oh my gosh! Where'd she go?!

*Suddenly, the ships starts to move away from the shore*

Bakura: She's steering the boat!

Yugi: We're being kidnapped! *runs to railing* YAAAAAAMI! HEEEEEEEEEEEEELP!

*Ship is starting to move must faster. The dust fight ends and everyone one is staring at ripples in the water.*

Yami and Yami Bakura: AAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIBOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUU!!!

Malik and Yami Malik: DESTROYER 615!!!

Joey: Uhhh, why don't you even try to swim and catch up to them?

Yami: Pshe, I just dried off from going in the water before. Do you know how much new leather shrinks after the first couple washes?

Yami Bakura: I can't! Salt water does horrors to my silky white hair!

Malik: And look at us! With all the jewelry we wear, we'd sink right to the bottom! Besides, Destroyer 615 is the fastest ship in the fleet. We'd never catch up just by swimming...*cries and is embraced by Yami Malik* She was just one day away from retirement, too...oh, yami...

Yami Malik: *still hugging Malik* I'm sure she'll be just fine, Malik. Sshhhh, shhhh, don't cry...

Tristan: *sweatdrops* Riiiiiiight...So how do you suppose we'll get off this island now? I mean, Peggy's boat got totalled and Kaiba's helicopter's gone...

Pegasus: Hey! Only my mommy calls me Peggy!

Kaiba: And it's Marie! Marie! Get that through your think skull, pointy haired freak!

Tristan: Don't blame me! I'm just doing my job and stating the obvious, like always!

(AN: Right now, I'd like to say that this part seems like I'm bashing a lot of characters, but I'm not. Honest! Please forgive me if you found any of this offending to your favourite character! Of course, if it's Tea, it can't be helped.)

Yami: Yu...Yu...

Joey: What are you trying to say? You? You what? Yu Yu Hakusho? Ooooooh, I get ya now. Sorry, bud. I know how you must feel. To love someone, but they are completely oblivious to your feelings. Suddenly, they're torn away from you, and you never have the chance to tell them. *with firm resolve* Well, I'm not gonna let that happen! I'm gonna help you get Yugi back, because I want you to be happy! Because I, I...I...I lo-l-l...

Yami: You know, I think we've developed stuttering problems. But anyways, Joey. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. You are a true friend.

Yami Bakura: Get your mind back on track! We've got to save our hikaris! I heard her saying that they were going to have a wedding!

Yami: And were going to see the Wizard of Oz!

Yami Bakura: And I think she said for us to, ""Follow the yellow brick road.""

Yami: Hmmmm, what does this all mean?

Pegasus: Elementary, my dear Yami, elementary, for you see, I not only watch the Funny Bunny cartoons, but I also watch the classics. The Wizard of Oz so happens to be one of them where a girl and her dog are wisked away to a strange land, which, I might add, is not Kansas. There, they meet a scarecrow, a lion, a tin man, and witches, and their ultimate goal is to reach the Wizard of Oz and have their questions answered. It's really quite a marvelous film. I give it 4 stars.

Kaiba: When the hell did you become a movie critic?!

Yami: So to get to the wizard fellow, we have to follow the yellow brick road?

Yami Bakura: No, stupid! We first have to get off this stinking island, _then_ find the yellow brick road, and _then_ kill the evil wizard and his witch, thus, saving our hikaris!

Yami: And how do you think we'll be able to get off this island? Get a taxi?

Yami Bakura: Don't ask me! I just came up with the basic plan!

Kaiba: Don't worry, I'll get us out of this mess. *takes off shoe and opens the heel, revealing a compact make-up kit. *everyone sweatdrops* Ah, errrr, wrong shoe. Remember, you saw nothing. *takes off other shoe and this time pulls out a cell phone* Here we are!

Yami Bakura: *now with phone* I think I saw Bakura using one of these before... *presses the seven, which was on speed dial, and the other line starts to ring*

Voice on Other Line: Hello, you've reached Boston Pizza's. Good afternoon, Mr. Kaiba. Will it be your usual order of one large peperoni and mushroom pizza with a male stripper to serve?

Yami Bakura: *eyes widen considerably* By Ra! What is this?!

Kaiba: *snatches the phone away from Yami Bakura and hangs up* Shut up! You heard nothing!

Yami: What was that all about?

Yami Bakura: Trust me, you don't wanna know.

Kaiba: *clears throat* Now, be quiet while I call for my emergency aircraft. Just so you know, her name is Betty. *dials a number and starts talking on the phone*

Pegasus: *to Bakura* You were right. I didn't want to know...

Yami Bakura: Hey! Stay out of my head!

Kaiba: ...great, so you'll be arriving in about 30 minutes? Good work. I'll be waiting. *hangs up* Alright everyone. Now all we have to do is wait.

Joey: Yo, Kaiba. How are we all supposed to fit into one helicopter? I mean, there are *starts counting* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 of us?

Kaiba: Who says Betty's a helicopter?

Yami: *talking to self* 30 minutes...just 30 more minutes...hang in there, aibou. If anything happens, I'll make Tea wish she was dead. I promise.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Part Nine: Mutiny in Mind

Scene: The DTT group, minus Yugi and Bakura, are stuck on the island, waiting for Kaiba's plane to come pick them up.


Pegasus: Any threes?

Joey: Damnit, how are you doing this?! That's the 5th card in a row that you've taken from me! You must've rigged this deck, ya lowly piece of scum!

Pegasus: How dare you! I don't carry rigged decks! If you want, check for yourself!

Tristan: This game is getting old. Pegasus, you've already won 13 times. Let's play something else.

Pegasus: Hahaha, admit defeat, puny mortals!

Yami Bakura: Hey, who are you calling a mortal?!

Kaiba: Will you all just shut up already?! Don't you know that Pegasus cheats? I mean, 13 times! At Go Fish! How obvious is it that he's keeping cards up his pink sleeves?

Pegasus: *sweatdrops* Uh, Kaiba-boy...Hey! It's not pink! It's red!

Malik: Well, I wouldn't know 'cause I'm colour blind.

Yami Malik: You're _what_?! How come I never knew? *hugs Malik* My poor, poor hikari...

Yami: SILENCE!! If you don't shut up right now, I'll send each of you to the Shadow Realm!

Kaiba: *crosses arms and says defiantly* Make me.

Yami: You asked for it! *forehead glows with the eye*

Kaiba: I was joking! Joking! Help me!

*Kaiba is sent to the Shadow Realm*

Yami Bakura: Now you've done it, you stuck up Pharaoh! If Kaiba's gone, how are we going to get off this stupid island?!

Yami: SHUT UP! *forehead glows again and this time Yami Bakura is sent to the Shadow Realm* Anyone else want to get on my bad side today?

Everyone: No, sir.

Yami: Good.

*Scene changes to the ship. Tea is wearing Malik's captain hat and steering the boat while Yugi and Bakura are throwing up their guts*

Yugi: *sickly pale* This day can't get any worse...

Bakura: *greenish* Don't say that, Yu -- *leans over rail and procedes to empty out stomach*

Yugi: I wish Yami were here.

Bakura: Yeah, I wish my yami were here, too.

Yugi: To take over?

Bakura: You got it.

Tea: Hey guys! How's my lovey dovey Yugi and his friend Bakura?

Yugi: Can't you tell? And aren't you supposed to be steering the ship?

Bakura: I want to kill you.

Tea: That's so nice! Oh, and for your question, Yugi, I put the ship on cruise control to Hawaii!

Yugi: We're going to Hawaii?!

Tea: Yes! Don't you think it will be romantic? While you were gone, I felt so lonely and I've decided that we don't need a big ceremony. Just as long as we're husband and wife!

Bakura: If only I weren't sea sick...

Yugi: *gags* How long till we get there?

Tea: Considering this ship's going about 30 knots, according to my calculations, I'd say in about... *thinks for a bit* 5 hours.

Yugi: 5 MORE HOURS?!

Bakura: I swear, if I weren't sea sick...Wait. Did you just calculate that in your head right now?!

Tea: Don't be silly! I had to think back to what the big screen inside said!

Bakura: Thank goodness...

Yugi: I gotta hurl again *leans over and begins to puke*

Tea: YUGI!! OHMIGOSH! ARE YOU OKAY?! *rushes to his side and manages to knock him off the railings*

Yugi: AHHHHHHH! *splash*

Bakura: Yugi! *turns to Tea* What did you do that for?!

Tea: Don't worry! *strips off stupid outfit and is wearing a thong bikini underneath. Dives in after Yugi*

Bakura: *blinks a bit* I think I just went blind...

*back on the island...*

Pegasus: Royal Flush. Read 'em and weep.

Malik: Stop mocking me! You know I can't tell if it's red or black!

Yami Malik: Yeah! Stop mocking my hikari! *punches Pegasus*

Pegasus: *nursing nose* Oww...you din'a hab ta hip meh...

Yami Malik: Cry baby. 

Yami: I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!! WHERE'S THE FUCKING PLANE?!

Joey: *eyes widen* Yami! Watch your language!

Yami: What did you just say?

Joey: Uh, heheh...nothing?

Yami: I didn't hear 'nothing'... *forehead glows again and Joey and sent to the Shadow Realm*

Tristan: Hey! That was my best bud! Look, I don't care if Tea has Yugi or not, but you can't just send us to the Shadow Realm everytime you get worried!

Yami: Can't I? And did you just say that you didn't care if the bitch has Yugi? DID YOU?! *forehead glows and Tristan disappears*

Yami Bakura: Pssst. Everyone, over here. *everyone except Yami huddles, so that's Yami Bakura, Pegasus, Malik, and Yami Malik* I say Yami is abusing his shadow power privileges.

Yami Malik: I agree. What do you propose we do?

Yami Bakura: Well, it's only been 14 minutes since the phone call. I can safely bet that Yami will probably have sent all of us to the Shadow Realm by the time the plane gets here. Now see here, we have 3 Millennium items -- the ring, the rod, and the eye -- while he only has one -- the puzzle. All we have to do is triple team him before he can use his powers.

Pegasus: Excellent observation. Well then, what do we do?

Yami Bakura: You see...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Part Ten: The Setup

Scene: Yugi has just fallen out of the ship and Tea jumps in to save him.


Bakura: Yugi! Hang on! I'll throw you a life saver! *grabs one that's hanging on the side and throws it down. It hits Yugi on the head and causes him to go under* Oh crap...

Tea: Yugi-honey! *dives under and grabs Yugi, who is flailing about because he can't swim very well. They swim over to the side of the ship*

Yugi: *coughing and sputtering* What the hell was that all about?! Were you _trying_ to kill me?! *pushes Tea away from him, but begins to sink again. Tea reattaches herself to him*

Tea: Oh, no! It was an accident, sweety! You know I'd never do something like that on purpose! *hugs him, but Yugi's shorter, so he's underwater and almost drowning*

Bakura: Get away from him, hag! *manages to get another life saver and throws it hard at Tea, knocking her out*

Yugi: *reaches the surface, gasping* Thanks Bakura! *grabs onto life saver* I owe you one.

Bakura: No prob. Now where's Tea? Drowning, I hope?

Yugi: *suddenly, and high pitched* AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

Bakura: What is it?!

Yugi: Something's pulling on my leg! Hurry and lower some rope! It might be Tea!!

Bakura: Hang on! *grabs some rope from no where and throws a line to Yugi*

Yugi: *grabs the rope but is getting pulled under* Help!! *bubbles at surface of water*

Bakura: No, Yugi! *tries to pull him up but only the rope comes* Nooooooooo!

Yugi: *bobs up one last time* Remember, Hawaii!! *goes under and stays under*

Bakura: Crap, Yugi. *wipes eyes* Hmmmm, I wonder if Malik keeps any food around here...

*back on the island, Yami is getting unstable and the others are planning to 'take care of him'.*

Malik: But that's not fair! How come I have to be the sacrifice?

Yami Malik: Sorry, hikari, but you're the only one who doesn't possess a Millennium item.

Malik: What?! The rod's mine!

Yami Bakura: Shut up, you two. Don't worry, Malik. After we get rid of Yami, we'll give you as much ice cream as you want.

Malik: *pouts* Fine.

Pegasus: I say, Yami B, you have a lot of guile. I mean, trying to trick Yami with a Malik dressed up as Yugi, then killing him while he's deliriously happy...Where _do_ you come up with these ideas?

Yami Bakura: From a website, why do you ask?

Pegasus: No reason. *pulls out a notebook and hastily scribbles something down*

Yami Bakura: Queer. Anywho, let's get this show on the road.

*All of them close in on Malik and a few moments of clothes being thrown and screaming, then...*

Yami Malik: Voila! C'est manifique! Ah oui?

Yami Bakura: *smacks Yami Malik* Cut the crap, frechie. Now, I'll get you two to sign here. *pulls out a page full of small print with two big x's at the bottom and a blue pen*

Malik: *now with his hair spiked and dyed, his wardrobe switched for a school uniform, and a cheesy imitation of the Millenium puzzle around his neck. His skin is also paler with the help of lots of foundation* What's that for?

Yami Bakura: Liability purposes.

Yami Malik: Lie what?

Yami Bakura: You know. If anything happens, I do not take full responsibility.

Yami Malik: I see...*takes the pen and very neatly writes 'Yami Malik'*

Yami Bakura: You have to sign, too. *gives pen to Malik*

Malik: I better not just get vanilla...*also signs his name, 'Malik Ishtar'*

Yami Bakura: Alright! Now everyone, remember the description!

*Malik goes and  jumps into the water. Everyone pretends to be playing cards*

Pegasus: Black jack.

Yami Bakura: Damn...that's the last time I'm betting for money...

Yami Malik: *reads from script* Oh. No. Is. That. Yugi? Yes! It. Is. Yugi! Let. Us. See. If. He. Is. Okay.

*the three rush to where Malik is floating and drag him in. Yami runs over to them*

Yami: Aibou? Aibou? Aibou? Is it really you?

Malik/Yugi: *coughing out some water* Uh, yeah, Yami.

Yami: Thank Ra! I thought Tea would've killed you by now!

Malik/Yugi: *stands up* Well, I jumped ship and swam back. *makes eye movements to the others*

Yami: Wait a second...I thought you couldn't swim...

Malik/Yugi: Heheheh, about that...I found that eating raw seaweed really helps you!

Yami: Really...and does this 'seaweed' induce growth spurts as well? *eyeing Malik suspiciously*

Malik/Yugi: Maybe...I'm not too sure...Guys! Now!

*Yami Bakura and Pegasus tackle Yami and Yami Malik draws his dagger*

Yami: What is the meaning of this?!

Yami Bakura: You fell for our trap, to put it bluntly.

Yami: So you mean...Yugi isn't actually...back?

Yami Bakura: Wow, Yami. You get a star for that one!

Yami: How dare you...

Pegasus: Uh, Yami B, is he supposed to be glowing like that?

Yami Bakura: Oh shit...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Part Eleven: Rendevous Point
 
Scene: Pegasus and Yami Bakura are pinning a glowing Yami to the ground while Yami Malik gets ready to gut him with his dagger/rod thingy.


Yami Bakura: Run for your life!!!
 
Yami Malik: Hey, isn't that a song name?
 
Yami Bakura: Shut up!!! *flees from the area*
 
Pegasus: Right behind you! *follows Yami Bakura*
 
Malik: *sheds his Yugi outfit to reveal his original atire* Yami! Please! I swear! They dupped me into it! *drops to his hands and knees* I beg of you! Please don't make me watch Barbie Adventures!!!
 
Yami: *stops glowing for a bit* Huh? What are you talking about?
 
Malik: My yami told me that, that, t-that they made you w-watch...Barbie in the Shadow Realm!! Don't make me go!
 
Yami: The Barbie show?! Fine, I'll spare you, but only because you helped Yugi before. Not your yami though. He will be punished for telling such lies! *bright flash of light, and Yami Malik is gone*
 
Malik: My y-yami... *starts bawling*
 
Yami: Insolent fool! Shut up already!!! *raises a fist*
 
Malik: No, wait!! I know how you can find Yugi!
 
Yami: You can? Really???
 
Malik: I'm not gonna tell you how plainly obvious it was, but here goes. You can just go to your soul room and then reappear. That way, you'd appear right by Yugi!
 
Yami: *smacks his forehead with his palm* By Ra, that _was_ so plainly obvious! Why didn't I see it before? I have to go rescue Yugi! *disappears*
 
Malik: Ha, that was just too easy. *wipes his eyes* Now all I have to do is wait for Kaiba's 'Betty'.
 
*Back to the scene with Bakura on Destroyer 615 and he's raiding the fridge*
 
Bakura: Hmmmm, cheddar, parmesean, blue, swiss, motzerella...What the hell?! It's all cheese! What is this?! *read note on the counter: ""Don't touch my cheese! It's mine, damnit! Mine!!! I mean it, yami!""* Malik needs some therapy...
 
Yami: *calling from outside* Aibou! Where are you?!
 
Bakura: Huh? What's going on?
 
Yami: Aibou!!! *pops his head into the room* Oh, there you are, Bakura. Where's Yugi? *notices the Millenium puzzle on the ground and picks it up*
 
Bakura: Yugi? I'm really sorry, but, Tea got him.
 
Yami: What?! NOOOOOO!!!
 
Bakura: Don't worry!
 
Yami: How can you say that?! Yugi's a goner! 
 
Bakura: Nawwww, I know Yugi, and I know that he'd never succumb to Tea's treacherous ways. I think he went to Hawaii.
 
Yami: HAWAII?! Why?! And why isn't Yugi wearing his puzzle?!
 
Bakura: Honeymoon. Well, it's not technically a honey --!
 
Yami: *grabs Bakura by the collar* What did you say?!
 
Bakura: Ack!! Let me finish!
 
Yami: Very well. *lets go of Bakura*
 
Bakura: As I was saying -- this might take a while, want some cheese?
 
Yami: Give it here.
 
Bakura: Feh. *hands over the tray of cheese* So...
 
*Bakura finishes the horrific tale of how Yugi was pushed off the ship by Tea*
 
Bakura: Right now, we're set on a course to Hawaii. I have a feeling Yugi and Tea will be there.
 
Yami: How can you be so sure? And you never told me why the puzzle is here and not with Yugi yet.
 
Bakura: Tea was ranting about how she always wanted a romantic wedding in Hawaii. And the puzzle...I think Tea took it while we were barfing our brains out. You know how strange she can get.
 
Yami: I see...
 
Bakura: We have about three more hours before we reach our destination. I was think -- Hey! How did you get here?!
 
Yami: Long story...
 
*Yami finishes his explanation*
 
Yami: *sheepishly* I guess I was over-reacting just a little.
 
Bakura: A little?! You sent our friends to the Shadow Realm for annoying you! And now, who knows where my yami, Pegasus, and Malik are!
 
Yami: They're still on the island. Besides, Kaiba's aircraft is coming for them.
 
Bakura: And why should the pilots listen to those guys? It's Kaiba that they work for!
 
Yami: Alright, alright! Quit your whining. *closes eyes and forehead glows* There.
 
Bakura: What did you do?
 
Yami: Sent the people in the Shadow Realm all back to the island. That way, they'll be able to get on the aircraft and get back to the mainland.
 
Bakura: Ooohhh, smooth. Well, we can just relax and wait for the ship to take us to -- *covers mouth and runs to the side of the ship* <insert barfing noises>
 
Yami: This is going to be a long wait.
 
*back on the island, everyone is in a big pile*
 
Joey: Hey, somebody's touching my ass!!!
 
Tristan: Whoa! Don't go there, buddy!
 
Kaiba: GET OFF OF ME!!!
 
Malik: *comes running to the scene* Hey, you guys! You're back!!!
 
Yami Malik: *withdraws himself from the pile* Of course, my light. *hugs Malik*
 
Joey: The hand is _still_ there!!!
 
Kaiba: Well, if you would just _move_ your ugly butt, I could get up and -- I'M TOUCHING YOUR ASS?! *sudden burst of energy and everyone is thrown off. Kaiba gets up and wipes his hands on his pants*
 
Joey: Ha ha, very funny. *gets a thoughtful look and then breaks into a fit of hysterical giggles*
 
*Everyone sweatdrops. Yami Bakura and Pegasus come running by*
 
Pegasus: No! I don't want to be the volleyball!!! I'm the one who told you about the movie!!
 
Yami Bakura: Too bad, girly boy! I called ship-wrecked person first! I thought you didn't want to play! Hahahaha -- *stops when he notices everyone looking at him funny* What?! (AN: Remember 'Cast Away'?)
 
Malik: I didn't think you could go mad on a deserted island after an hour...
 
Yami Malik: Don't worry about him. He's always like this.
 
Malik: I'll take your word for it.

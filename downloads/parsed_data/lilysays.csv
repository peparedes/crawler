"event","Hey people gettin ready for tonite. don't forget the under classman are thr crips n the upperclassman r the bloods. If ur upper call cass and under call me if u have any questions. Don't forget tomorrow is the rakin leave competition, n it helps get the neibors on a good side. Also we have the haunted house comp tonite, n it has to go on sunday to don't forget. Also every team needs to pick out at least 6 people to take the little kids trick or treatin in the development for thier parents, also to get them to like us since were doin shit to thier houses n saturday. :/... Talkin about Saturday nite, if u need a camera to take a pic of Tee peeed houses tell me tonite n ill give u some. dont forget 5+ pts for egged cars (u need pics of these cars.) and +20 for teepeed houses with pictures on them. Also we give points pening what u have done on mischief nite and if it was appropriate, we don't need the cops on our backs like last year. Tonites party if ur not dressed up ur not let in!!!! Sunday don't eat ur candy until its been wighed and u get +3 pts for every 2 ounces of candy. The haunted house is 50 pts. The best costume is 35 pts. and each activity tonite is 30 pts. Points can be deducted because some of u r stupid asses, anyone drunk  on Sunday n takin the kids trick or treatin or doin the haunted house will have 100 pts deducted from thier team. In other words don't do anything stupid to jepordize it i like this time of year n i wanna keep this tradition. So im gonna go get ready. Party is at 7, ends whenever... pizza is gonna be there will a many array of drinks n yes everyone gets a bag, just like last year.... even better... well ill see u later

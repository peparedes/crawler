I borrowed <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> from the library. People decided that they could write on the margins, so at particular instances, once when Darcy and Elizabeth fight, there'd be a comment, like ""oooh, bitch..."" Two of them also decided to leave notes at the ending. This was delightful.

I read <i>the Great Gatsby</i> also. So when I pick up <i>Norwegian Wood</i>, my, I am surprised.

Apart from bringing back memories of Au3 vividly and not without that feeling you get when opening boxes of cake, Murukami has come to equal himself to introversion.

<lj-cut text=""Invictus""><i>
<b>Invictus</b>
by William Ernest Henley; 1849-1903

Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate;
I am the captain of my soul.
</i></lj-cut>
 
I don't think it's a good poem. I like the first two lines and the 10th. Otherwise it's very dry.

and i'm not cynical. i liked this poem (which if i remember, Charlie Veric likes too.) 

<lj-cut text=""Ithaka""><i>
<b>Ithaka</b>
By Cavafy

As you set out for Ithaka
hope the voyage is a long one,
full of adventure, full of discovery.
Laistrygonians and Cyclops,
angry Poseidon -- don't be afraid of them:
you'll never find things like that on your way
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,
as long as a rare excitement
stirs your spirit and your body.
Laistrygonians and Cyclops,
unless you bring them along inside your soul,
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.

Hope the voyage is a long one.
May there be many a summer morning when,
with what pleasure, what joy,
you come into harbors seen for the first time;
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations
to buy fine things,
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,
sensual perfume of every kind --
as many sensual perfumes as you can,
and may you visit many Egyptian cities
to gather stores of knowledge from their scholars.

Keep Ithaka always in your mind.
Arriving there is what you are destined for.
But do not hurry the journey at all.
Better if it lasts for years,
so you are old by the time you reach the island,
wealthy with all you have gained on the way,
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.

Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.
Without her, you would not have set out.
She has nothing left to give you now.

And if you find her poor, Ithaka won't have [deceived] you.
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,
you will have understood by then what these Ithakas mean. 
</i></lj-cut>

Lead my thoughts to the hypothesis that in some paradigm, there is no such a thing as an antithesis. It's all just emotive. (emotive i get from my 9-person moral philosophy class.) We talk about all the same things all the time. all the same things. all the time."

*<i>Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room. My parents pulled this exact same act for years.</i>
[consider this line's overt satire. more importantly, appreciate its role in developing the narrator's character. what does the strict absence of either Marla or Tyler mean in terms of what is revealed toward the end? what does it say about the protagonist's regard for Marla?]

*<i>I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldn't screw to save its species. I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all the French beaches I'd never see. I wanted to breathe smoke. I felt like destroying something beautiful.</i>

*<i>In the world I see - you are stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life.

the days before that were devoted to debate. the weeks after will be devoted to grades and my piano recital.

"event","I had a very long weekend. Thursday, I have my math long test. my carelessness is crap. moments before I fall asleep that night, I feel a surge of excitement and anxiousness for the next day. Friday is de la Costa finals, the math contest. I skip math with earl young because I am not in the mood. it is also paco's despedida. that night I have fun with the a-boys. good old real quadraw. I miss that. quadraw is so different with my block. feel sad for the situation. we will all miss paco.

Saturday I have to attend swimming practice. I have to train. I rush to the intact thing at nine afterwards. the GA with the deans is boring, is not even spiced up by ""bitterness"" toward the som from one of my blockmates. I travel to alabang with xyrro to attend debut practice which is tiring and annoying at one point because I know I am two hours away from home. having slept only three hours does not help improve your mood. rush to galleria to watch the terminal. thanks king and xyrro. The Terminal is a good movie. a bit fantastic. which I point out because I don't think it was the intention of the director. rich with symbolism though. why is jazz a recurring theme in my life this week? today (Sunday) I graduate. thoughts are plain about the ceremony. Val sees me in glorietta in ""corporate"" getup. I get gaiman's world's end. I love that volume. off to finish my take-home quiz and read the economist later.

I thank God for weekends like this. against post modern standards on the value of a human being, the volume of things I have done makes me pass as pretty important, at least to myself. a good movie, a good read and good friends make a perfect weekend."

david, anna, jerome and i were bashing the technician today. i'm tempted to say that filipino is one of my more worthwhile classes. or even the best. i don't know. boring pa rin sya. math is boring. i'm supposed to like math but the past two weeks i've been dreading math and doing my homework in filipino.

ang dami kong pananagutan. it stresses me out so much. kailangan ko magpakita sa coach ko. kailangan ko mag-attend ng globalization lecture. weird thing is i want to do these things. sorry, i have no point.

I realized at some point that i've changed so much as a student. currently, i check xyrro's watch every 20 minutes in his class. and it crushes my hopes everytime the watch says the class has still an hour more to go..

"event","I guess I possess a twisted form of humor because I found something funny in the fact that I learned that some economic crises can actually be traced to the decision and determination of certain groups and governing bodies. After having read an article from GLOBALIZATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS, I found in myself the urge to say ""f*ck America."" The reason for this is that I've always thought that what happens in the economies of the world is some random occurance that cannot be controlled by the general consciousness of the governments put together, or at the very least, can it be predicted by economists. Unfortunately, as technology bubbles burst, my idealism that the reason why our economies go haywire go haywire is because there is no human way to control such a tremendous thing, burst as well.

One concrete way that man f*cks up himself is by his irresponsible dropping of predictions. The article that I was reading for debate pointed out the horrendous effects of consumer confidence, and how such an important thing can be influenced by unanalyzed predictions about the state of business in countries. In fact, though such things may not have been the direct cause of such catastrophies such as the east asian crisis, these have been the direct cause of the lack of ability of such countries to get back on their feet.

But the central reason for such crisis is, as simplistic as it may seem, the inability of certain countries to think outside of their own realms (yes, selfishness would have been more succinct, but it seemed out-of-place in this part of my entry.) Really, all countries think of their own economies but what they do not realize is that they could do with the good economies of their neighbors, as pointed out by the beggar-thy-neighbor occurances. At some point even, some bodies will not even grant the world the acceptance of wrong analyses about certain regional situations, which does have certain repurcussions given that these bodies are generally accepted by the world.

Am I angry? My knowledge of the effects of these events is not vast enough to allow me to be. But in the infinitesimal cave of knowledge that I do live in, I am granted the ability to perceive that there is something wrong in what is supposedly the neutral and unbiased mechanism of economies in the world, and that it can be traced to well, man himself.

"event","we often times reminisce. we think of past experiences and of things that we did then and compare them to the things we do now. even as a human race we do such things. we think of the times when life was much simpler, more idyllic, more romantic, more chivalrous. we write incessantly about fantasy and of civilizations past and we look upon these times with sentimentality. we recall with a bitter taste of the burden we carry, the times when life was less complicated.

yet are we fooled still? they say we are seasoned to think we are doing the right thing, we are accomplishing the truth. and just as we saw once, as a human civilization, the truths of patriarchy, lordship, subduction and religion, we continue to see the truths of post-modern feminism, aetheism, globalization. we claim to have evolved, to have found truths truer than what was already true.

but we are as a blind as ever. we are as unable to verify and check what we deem as reality as this rampant, unsubdued human race has always been. we are spinning tops. perhaps reaching greater speeds, grasping unimaginable magnitudes of torque, or slowing down, moving toward the brink of a full stop. either way, we spin on our own and about our own world like the world will never end.

literature tackled solitude again. parang, in both cases of solitude and having a family and fooling yourself about being in love people find a certain amount of happiness and sadness... but the story we were reading sort of pointed out that well, solitude is worse, even at the expense of success or independence... my eng 11 grades are <b>bad</b>

so, there, she left today.

filipino, we read this poem, which i think is what tj was reading when he brought up the topic on russel's paradox. i think it's a pretty good poem. the author, tinio, was refuting the absolute... he was trying to say that well, construct nga lahat ng ideya, the way we perceive things included... salazar isn't bad...

hmmm... all this talk about communism and capitalism from the UP boys. i've been shifting between one and the other all these years, and currently, i think, that well, cliche as it may sound, both are wrong and correct at the same time... which is generally true... however, such softstandish arguments are useless, they contribute nothing so it isn't mature pala... hmmm, so the best thing to do is try to make a judgement on the philippines.. haha, will not attempt now.

"event","goodbye katz. goodbye noel.

two despedidas in one weekend is quite an emotional thing. i kept on feeling this urge to protect these people. i kept on telling them to take care of themselves and all (like a loser of sorts). but i very well know that the two WOULD survive. yung dalawa pang yun? yck, is this the caulfield syndrome?

it was a pretty eventful weekend. was cool to get to talk to raffy, erick, vince, pets, and the others during the weekend. grabe ibang-iba na tayo. people have problems already. it just feels so different. something, (AGAIN) ended for me, and started for two others.. well. actually happy. so much on my mind, so little i can reveal and get sorted out on this online thing. but it doesn't matter. i hope the next week will bring me something as memorable as this week.

hmmm, i need literature, decent literature. i need a book, a movie. sobrang tempting nung sprited away and the like...

i also think that sometimes, my own life feels like literature, or at least, some literary elements are present. definitely it's influenced by my mindset and all but themes are present at times, like this weekend was full of goodbyes. coincidence kaya that i saw Meet Joe Black as a introduction? haha. yes, my life is as always centered on me. 

again i remember the bon voyage's... and well, i feel sad. i will really miss them...

"event","today, i did something that finally and conclusively ended something that i had been doing for eight years. thing is it wasn't the ending i wanted. tipong, if it were a math exam, i got into the middle range of a-a+.. and what does an arrogant guy like me want from a math exam? an a+... tapos it didn't help when i considered the amount of time i put into this thing... so i was moping around the venue for so long... brooding and shit...

then my driver came and let me drive all the way from makati to quezon city, which is, for a pathetic driver for me, quite a long distance, the longest i've driven actually... tapos being affected by the thing i mentioned earlier, well i wasn't exactly a responsible driver.. couldn't check my mirrors right and everything

"event","hehe.. the title was just to catch your attention and make me sound smart.

literature today was different. we had a debate. and it was different. If anybody's interested in telling me what they think, the question is whether mamzelle aurelie and Kate chopin's <i>regret</i> regretted not having children...

math, we now have a seating arrangement. So we had one final chance to change our seats. sell-out ba ako? I decided to stay beside jerome in the second row, mainly because i can't see doc mara's thin writing. this being the case, i left the ateneans who sit at the back row. well, probably i'm not being a sell-out, just grade conscious.

anna was being weird today... haha.

debate training today, the motion was that this house condemns the capitalist co-option of counterculture. nevermind the debate, it sucked. but my thoughts on the subject. it's a pretty tangible one because well, a-boys have a penchant for this heterodoxy. the rebellious attitude seems to have started in the 60's with the punk revolution. people talk about this counterculture as something black (as opposed to the status quo being white). but the truth of the matter is that it isn't. this is where the notion of co-option comes in. people seem to find rebelliousness which translates into being cool and unique (euphemisms of antiestablishment) as the in thing. so much so that it is marketable. so people like bob marley and well, marijuana leaves become icons in t-shirts. this is where it becomes complicated. because capitalism can use it, and because it is novel and not trite, <b>counterculture actually becomes pop culture</b>. isnt that a contradiction of sorts?!?!?

okay, people might be thinking that i'm jumping into conclusions... fine, it doesn't become pop culture, but the blades of rebellion (the archenemy of the current status quo) are blunted and assimilated into society. what happens is called co-optation, that is, give it the element of time and just like the punk revolution, counterculture, heterodoxy, or what is considered to be COOL for us will be just as trite as anything else found it pop culture...

yuck, debate jargon..

shut up, raj...

okay, okay...

PS eli, i just happen to think of you concerning this hehe...

"event","i've never been more relieved and happy about the news  i just received. it's a pity i can't talk about it here. but i really really thank God.

Today something in me ended or to a certain extent, died. I've reached the end of something i've been doing for eight years and i don't know if i feel sad or depressed or free. actually, it's more on the negative side.

Now, i'm thinking about lit. i wonder what'll happen tomorrow. intact sucks, free cut kami tomorrow. such a useless subject. I need a book to read.

today i had only one subject. but i stayed in school to finish the filipino project which we were able to do.

"event","if there's a day i should write about in my LJ/tabulas, this is one of them.

day started with me waiting an almost an hour for johnp, david and jerome so that we could start working on the photo essay. currently, we are 90% done. meaning a lot of work was done today. i guess i'm pretty proud of what we were able to do.

watch me be a teacher's pet after literature. i talked to sir veric for like 30 minutes or so. i suggested he give us guide questions so we could actually have well-thought of answers in literature class. it ended up me telling him how i felt hilaw after we ""finished"" every story. and it ended up him telling me that the main point of taking up these stories in classes is to <b>appreciate</b> these. what he meant was that he wanted us to see ironies, contradictions, parallelisms. He wants for us to understand the truths that occur in the story. What I was looking for, (a moral lesson akin to aesop's fables) is something that we do ourselves as readers, because the story is different for each of us. surprisingly, i was able to get all that. In the end, i think i like mr veric.

hmmm.. currently hating the 478 point guidance test we had. <b>nakakapagod</b>. it's a true or false thing... they had statements like: the top of my head feels tender, sometimes i wish that i were dead, i love my father (or if your father is dead, i loved my father), i take marijuana... or what not...

umm.. i lost the camera. bull shi* that's 27000 pesos from my account down the drain. no more to say. but i love my parents for, umm, not scolding at me.

but weirdly, instead of the fact of their not scolding me making me feel better, i actually feel worse. ewan ko, mas mature yung pagtrato sa akin, so i really have to act towards not losing my things.

yes, online community, <b>watch me grow up.</b>"

"event","anna was explaining this to me. one of the first things they were told when they got into phisci this syndrome. it's all about relatively big fish from a small pond placed into another pond where other big fish are too... and you realize you aren't special or all that great..

yesterday was a small fish day. i complained, moped around. told erick, told raffy, told archie. basta nakakaasar. i'm just not happy with a sabit-A for my score in the math lt. people will find it annoying how i can complain about getting an a, pero.. basta.

on other things. got really annoyed today because my sister promised to give me the laptop because i needed to finish a groupwork with my classmates. but she didn't because she had to finish her paper. so i was annoyed and it got me down the whole day; and finally when i talked about the problem over dinner, well napagalitan siya and i wanted to take back bringing it up in the first place. labo ko no?

yes, i am a child at times..

hoping that we can finish our fil project..."

i was able to see the last 30 minutes of 6 feet under. ang guess <b>what</b>? AI na naman. tama na HB0, it isn't a movie i enjoy.

i have the debate seminar tomorrow. and well, i have so much to do next week. i'm gearing up for next week, the peak of which will be on the 31st. ?3na, if ever you read this, well i'm already very sad at this point...

well, i'm thinking of hard drinks tonight at 1am. you have depression. you have stress. you mix them all together. you drink. the result is your heart raising so fast but beating so loudly that you hear each damn pair of systole and diastole like they were a minute apart."

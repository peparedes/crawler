oh, and now i'm getting sick. joy.

but hey, i'll be 18 in 23 (almost 22) days. i really wish someone would give a damn to surprise me in some way. because everyone else seems to get surprises, big or small, for their birthdays. sorry if i live in the middle of nowhere; it's not my fault my parents decided that the buttfuck was the way to go.

no, i'm not mad, so please don't take this the wrong way. i just feel sort of...left out?"

i agree with melissa. how weird to think about this time of year last year. how different things were. how much people have changed, including myself. i find it mind-blowing that i actually moved on in 3 months. sure, they were the longest and most grueling 3 months of my entire life, during which much pain was inflicted upon my emotions, and my body in a sense; but i moved on nonetheless, and i'm more grateful than anyone can ever imagine.

oh, and just in case no one noticed, the first half of senior year is over. done. finished. complete.

FOREVER. hell yes. presenting was pretty nerve-wracking. i was in there with gideon park and chelsea palmer, though, so it wasn't all that bad. and mrs. pollerana [sp?], being that she was one of the judges in the room, actually took me aside as we were leaving the classroom and told me how much she liked my presentation. it made me feel great, because i thought i did kinda badly. not horribly, just not as well as i would've liked.

now it's time to finalize my portfolio and move on with my life for good :)

i really want a repeat of last friday night. the people, and just the atmosphere made me feel so...i don't really know the word. small things really make a huge impact on me, so yeah."

"event","i'm obviously not at school. this would be the second time in a span of a week. i really don't like missing school, but i wasn't about to go in the condition i was in this morning; i could barely go two breaths without hacking up a lung. seriously, it was bad. so i rubbed some vick's vapor rub on my chest, took two doses of nyquil and went back to bed. i woke up again at around 12:15. in the week that i've been sick, my coughing has gone from bad to horrible, but i don't have a fever anymore. i've been at school because missing tests and assignments isn't fun. i've been working, but luckily i'm not doing a lot in the front yet; i don't think you'd want to buy food from someone that's coughing every 2 seconds. yuck. i haven't been able to sing at all for awhile, and i'm not at all happy about that, especially with all-state jazz auditions just around the corner.

speaking of all-state, i'm pretty excited about it. it just seems so...i dunno...cool. no, that's not the word for it. i don't think i have a word for it. i'm just excited, i guess. something else to occupy my time, doing something i really like doing, with a lot of really talented people. if i make it, that is. we'll see :)

did i mention that i FINALLY have a cell phone again? oh, how i've missed text messaging. mmm. and this cell phone is way better than my old one.

minus the gross coughing, things are looking 1000% better. yes, a thousand :)"

HELLO?? $8.00 an hour. fuck yeah.

i don't know what's wrong with me, i really don't. i feel numb 98% of the time, and the other 2% i'm on the brink of insanity because every emotion i should feel comes rushing in at the same time. i don't know what to do, and i don't know what exactly is causing this. i feel physically weak all the time, and i rarely have enough energy to get me through each day. i've probably lost about 10 lbs in the past month, and my appetite is up and down. i don't care as much about the things i used to anymore. and i really do try to be interested, i swear. i just want to be alone, but when i achieve that i always want someone there. i'm so sick of needing something, yet not knowing what it is. and i hate it when someone asks me if i'm okay, and i'm forced to say ""yes"", when i really want to say ""no"". but then the ""what's wrong?"" comes into play, and i think i'd rather lie than to go through the effort of finding some sort of explanation, because i simply can't put this into words.

forget this, i probably sound like a complete psychopath.

<b>EDIT:</b> apparently, this is emptiness? it makes sense. and though i believe i have the proper justification, i still don't quite comprehend it fully."

"event","last night, i found a pair of scissors. and with that pair of scissors i cut relentlessly through my hair. i decided  my bangs were too fucking long, and just chopped away. luckily i stopped myself before the point of no return, or i might've gone crazy with a hackjob on my head. after i finished my bangs, i decided to try the rest of my hair. you know, just for kicks. let's just say i'm glad that at least my bangs turned out well.

i saw jackass 2 today with chelsea, taylor, and robert, and it's seriously the most hilarious/fucked up/gross spectacle i've ever seen. it was SO funny watching weeman have an insanely large woman in a thong run up to him and hump him; i haven't laughed that hard in a while. but it was really gross watching steve-o push that metal hook through the side of his mouth, or watch him throw up all over himself the 23979242 times that he did.

i've had such a low amount of energy lately. i sleep more, yet i'm still just as tired. i don't understand it. and since i'm already falling over from being so sleepy, i give up on thinking of anything else to write. goodnight."

verizon wireless is officially on my hit list. i now have to wait another week to get my new cell phone, when they told me that this weekend would be okay to upgrade. and my current cell phone is dead. so i basically have no cell phone this week -.-

i listened to coldplay's ""a message"" about 50 times today, and thought about what was said to me about that song. seriously, talk is so cheap.

"event","i have way too much time by myself to think.

i'm becoming so consumed with what i thought i was okay with. it's starting to make me very cynical and indifferent about anything i do, and anyone i associate with. i'm sure they don't appreciate it at all either, and i apologize prefusely. being given so much time to evaluate everything has hindered my attention span greatly, and i've been finding it hard to think straight for the past week.

i'm just tired of being in an ongoing bad mood. everyday i wake up and i just go through the day, without really having retained anything from it. i've sort of just been walking around like a zombie all week, and it's really frustrating. and as much as people have been there for me, it doesn't seem to be enough. don't get me wrong; i appreciate everything everyone has done to make me feel loved. i think i just need to find a way to cope by myself. i've yet to discover what it is that i need.

i feel foolish for a lot. maybe because i meant what i said when i said it, but now i'm not allowed to. maybe because i was under the wrong impression for such a long time. maybe because i'm confused as to how i even feel anymore. i'm not sure why i'm having such a tough time getting over this. i guess it always has to get worse before it gets any better. i'm just a little impatient.

the first week or so? brutal. absolutely unbearable. it was possibly the worst week of my entire young life. but i'm glad i went through that horrible time, because now i know what it's like, and i've grown. so much. i'm glad.

right now? i'm confused as to what i need, what i want. i'm fine on the matter above; i can almost say i'm completely over it, which feels great. but i've presented myself with something uncontrollable and irreversable. nothing serious of course, but it's significant enough to strike yet another knife in my heart. i don't really know what to do. it seems to be a reoccurring theme at the present time in my life.

"event","God, this hurts so much more than I can ever express through writing. I've never felt so horrible in my entire life. This is eating away at me with each passing minute. It's like you came back, knowing full well that you had these ""feelings"", no matter how small; yet you slept with me the day you came back. Conveniently, the days after that are where your huge epiphany came about in full effect. Just admit it. That girl, with her smile that ""melts your heart"", would have come between us sooner or later. I'm thinking sooner.

I've never felt so disgusted with anyone in my entire life. I never thought I could feel this way about you, of all people. You were so perfect, so amazing, so ""different"" for such a long time. I still have yet to fully comprehend this entire thing. If you had doubts weeks ago as you registered for classes, why didn't you tell me anything then? I'm so naive to think that you could be so wonderful. I was blinded. Of course you had your flaws, as everyone does, but they weren't anything that would have gotten in the way of us being together. I never thought we'd end so horribly. I always thought that if we ended, it'd be mutual and everything would be alright. It wouldn't be the complicated mess that it is right now.

I'd love to have some form of friendship with you in the future, but that can't happen without respect, and I've lost all I ever had for you. You used me. You deceived me. This break-up was a huge shock not only to me, but to anyone who has learned of it. How it happened is an even bigger shock. You've simply become someone else. You're not the boy I fell for a year ago. Everytime you went over there, you lost a part of yourself in their image. You belong over there, with them, being someone you're not. And I hope you go, and you stay. You being far away will ease everything so much.

As of this point in time, I want nothing to do with you. I don't want to communicate with you. I don't want to see you. Nothing. It's hard to say these words without wanting to take them back, because I'm still hopelessly in love with you. I love who you were before. I love looking back on how happy and amazing our relationship was. We really were perfect for each other, and for you to throw that away leads me to believe that I was never as special to you as you were to me. That hurts more than you can ever begin to imagine.

I just hope you regret it. I want you to hurt. I want you to feel the raw pain and resentment that I feel. I want you to look back and wish you would've thought it over. But, the way things are looking, that won't happen. You've already moved on, and I can't do a damn thing about it. So the only thing I can say is goodbye, for good."

"event","So it's over.
It's really over.
It actually happened.

And I'm...alive.

I'm in shock, I'm sad, livid, just a wreck of emotions. I guess THIS is what real heartbreak is. Even my body is confused. I haven't had food in over 12 hours, yet the mere thought of food is revolting.

I don't know what else to say. I'm still sort of hoping that I wake up from this random, horrible nightmare and that everything is as I thought it should be. Of course, it's just wishful thinking.

I can't see myself sleeping at all until the final stage of closure that tomorrow brings. I'm scared and nervous, but I guess I have no reason to be, since it's done for good and all.

Goodnight."

SO CUTE! omg, i couldn't get over it. i wasn't feeling all that well, but it was alrght. haha, john kept texting me throughout the time i was there. it was funny.

after we left mike's mom's work, we went to the grove. we were there a lot of the day. it was cool, but we got bored, so we sat down and ate something before heading off to the stage area to see Anna Nalick =DDD but robert and chelsea left because they don't really care for her at all. then, cara and her sisters met up with us, and we all sang along with anna. UGH she's so good live.

theeeen we went to the line for meeting her, but i didn't have anything to sign, and the people were taking people out of line if they didn't have a cd or something like that to sign. mike was gracious enough to lend me his cd case =] and cara and her sisters met us with their shit. we were stopped for awhile, and i guess i was singing, i don't remember because i do it all the time without knowing. they were like what was that, and they were all staring at me for a second, so i was like ""what?"". they were like ""THAT WAS YOU? you're so good."" and i was like ""=]]]]] thankss *blush*"". it was awesome.

then we met Anna, took pictures, and went home =] pictures to come."

"event","a year ago, today was one of the happiest days of my life. i can still visualize every moment of that day, and feel every feeling i felt the entire time i was there. nervousness, excitement, girlish daydreams finally coing true after years of waiting, and the pains of trial and error. the moment came, and can you believe that i'm STILL waiting to wake up from this dream? how is this even happening? if this were a dream, i'd prefer to sleep for eternity. i'm feeling so many emotions at this very moment. i'm proud to say that it's been a year of learning, understanding, learning to trust in not only in him, but in myself. i've never felt so vulnerable, yet so safe. so insecure, yet so comfortable in my own skin. we're 3 days shy of a year, and i can definitely see this being the first of many, many more to come. each one being even more amazing than the previous. i'm just so happy. i can never fully express how i feel, because it'll never be substantial. but i am undeniably the happiest girl to have ever walked the planet. and no one can come close to what we have and what we've made. no one can ever replace this. i firmly believe in that.

summer school is okay. i'd prefer not to go, but oh well. i also just want that coc class to end already. 2 more weeks, and my nights are freeeeee. though i'm almost 100% sure that i'll be applying at Hot Dog on a Stick at the mall sometime in the coming weeks. i don't really want to work there, but i'm in desparate need of a job. and some sexy bitches work there, so i guess it'd be good. it'd be a job, so hey.

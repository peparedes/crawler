and finally drank away his memory
life is short but this time it was bigger
than the strength she had to ger up off her knees

with a note that said ill love him till i die
as the angels sang a whiskey lulluby....

i fell in love with you so many reasons and more
i became completley breathless everytime you walked through the door
i cant explain how being with you made me feel
i cant even describe it, how my love for you was,
and still is so real
and when you left me my heart was instantly broken
i wanted to say so much to you
but not a word was spoken
well now i have to speak the truth 
i feel like i cant live, sleep or breathe without you
you are constantly, always on my mind
and in my dreams your with me too
now were only friends and its so damn hard for me
baby i love you and miss you s much
i just wish you could see
and when you kiss me
it feels like my heart stops beating
and i quickly have to catch my breath
cause for a moment its like im not even breathing
being with you, it gave me the best feeling ive ever had,
i want you back my by side
and the fact that your not
well it is what keeps me feeling sad
so theres one question i want to ask to you
and also im asking, please answer true
has any other girl truly loved you
as much as i really do
and sometimes it hurts cause it feels like you dont miss me at all
and without you  i fell like i cant stand strong and tall
so baby, take in all this  that ive said
and please keep it in your head
and also, always keep this with you,
the thought that no one
will ever love you the way that i do..
deticated to jim<3 ill love you for always ...

to cross that line

but i tried EVERYTHING
to be with YOU

"event","ya know...i had never been hurt that much before in my life...and the reason why it hurt me so much inside why my heart kept breaking was because i fell in love with him..and that was my mistake....i had fell in love before but i hurt him and so that ended for about 4 years and then one day he called me out of the blue...and weve been friends since...and then there were other guys who said how much they loved me and thats all i wanted so i gave up my life to them...and they ended up hurting me...some physical some emotional...its all the same...i had bruises on the outside and on the inside...so i put my guard up...the  this one day i met this guy...who just toally made me laugh i just thought he was so cute...so we started to chill n stuff started foolin around then i started to cling to him because yep i fell for him...and i dont care what u say..those 3 words mean the world to a girl n u said em so me getting too close the first time was partly your fault...then we stopped tlaking because of course i got hurt he just wanted  a sex buddy....so then we started talking again a couple weeks later and i said i wouldnt get attached...then i do the stupidest thing i could ever do and that ive ever done...i gave up my virginity to him....which of course attached me to him because to girls sex is more than just ""getting some"" but thats again all he wanted so after that he stopped calling...nice huh....then a couple weeks later he called...and i was so happy cuz i missed him so much....and once again...we started hagning out  and then it finally happened...what i had been wanting and wishing for those like like 4 months..he wanted to be with me....for real like a relationship...so i felt like i was on top of the world..i had him with me by my side after all guys had put me thru i felt cared for and safe and protected....it had been so long since i felt like that...since mikey 4 years before that...then it happened...what always happens with him...he got bored and didnt want to be tied down....i mean i tried to change myself just for this one guy...because like i said i was head over heels for him... i dont know what i was thinking...i have so many great friends and them and my family and everyone i meet tell me how i have such an awsome personality...and he wanted me to even change that...not to mention how i talked, dressed, wore my hair, who i hung out with....and other stuff too...but all i cared about was pleasing him and making him happy...i just wasnt good enough...or so i thought...thats how i felt...but really im too good..i deserve to be loved not lied to...everyone tells me how lucky he should have felt to have a girl like me and i was the best hes ever gonna get and hell start to miss me and realize wat a mistake he made just throwing it all away...which i hope he does because then hell feel maybe half of what i felt...changing myself and giving all i had to one guy just to have him throw u away like trash....doesnt feel good at all...i hope he finds his perfect woman because i tried so hard to be her but i guess to him i never will be....i tried so hard with all of my mind body n heart but i just cant win with him....he always ends up breaking my heart he loves me one day the next he could give two shits....o yea baby thats love...so i spent like almost a month straight being depressed not wanting to live because i missed him so much and felt so hurt n stuff....do u know how it feels to feel like ur on top so happy nothing can tear u down because u have that one person who makes u so happy and then u hit rock bottom so fast because that same person brought u down....it hurts it feels like someone ripped ur heart hes just an immature boy....who lied and played me for a fool just for sum ass...theres no other explanation....that could be good enough for me to believe nemore because he says o yea i miss you but doesnt call for weeks at a time i saw him again and he hasent called since...man its all bullshit with u u have lied to me soo0o0o0 many times uncountable....i dont deserve that and u shouldnt have taken advanatge of me knowing how much i loved u..damn..i hope u know what we coulda been what i woulda done for u and i hope u realize what u lost because baby all that time so many awsome gorgeous guys wanted to be with me but i just turned them down and especially after u broke up with me but i still didnt act on ne of it...but im growing up yea ur def. not if u dont even know how to treat a girl.. i want u to know that u are the one who threw it all away for us...i wanted you and only u....so when ur missing me and wishing u had me by your side when ur dad is pissing u off or ur upset about ur grama or sumone else and u need sumone to out their arms around u and tell u its ok....just know its your fault u dont have that nemore...i hope u find her jim....ilu and i always will....."

"event","Ugh.  Russian lesbian singing duos.  Who would've thought THOSE would be dominating my thoughts?  I hear them everywhere, I see them everywhere, and the worst part is I CAN'T HAVE THEM.  But at least I enjoy this kind of self-inflicted torture.

   Now, you know your life is boring when a big trip entails going to Wal*Mart and shopping.  I know I'll actually enjoy the challenges ahead in my future, but I really am not looking forward to it... : \

Anyways, I'm not big on long entries.  So there."

A couple Marion Barry quotes (cause the black man, he so funny!)

Bitch set me up!

I promise you a police car on every sidewalk.

The laws in this city are clearly racist. All laws are racist. The law of gravity is racist.

I am clearly more popular than Reagan. I am in my third term. Where's Reagan? Gone after two! Defeated by George Bush and Michael Dukakis no less.

If you take out the killings, Washington actually has a very very low crime rate.


AAAAAND NOW, BECAUSE HE'S SO SCREWED UP.... *drumroll*  The Dan Quayle Quote Section!


One word sums up probably the responsibility of any vice-president, and that one word is 'to be prepared.'

I love California, I practically grew up in Phoenix.

The global importance of the Middle East is that it keeps the Far East and the Near East from encroaching on each other.

I was recently on a tour of Latin America, and the only regret I have was that I didn't study Latin harder in school so I could converse with those people.

Welcome to President Bush, Mrs. Bush, and my fellow astronauts.

Quite frankly, teachers are the only profession that teach our children.

It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it.

Verbosity leads to unclear, inarticulate things.

We're going to have the best educated American people in the world."

"event","**I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch break, making them more efficient in heat-retention. I play bluegrass cello. I was scouted by the Mets. I am the subject of numerous documentaries. I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst and a ruthless bookie. I don't perspire. I once read ""Paradise Lost,"" ""Moby Dick"" and ""David Copperfield"" in one day. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. I breed prize-winning clams. 

On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. The laws of physics do not apply to me. I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet. I have performed open-heart surgery. And I have spoken to Elvis. But I have not yet dated Anna Kournikova.

"event","A song.  I wrote it.  And when I become famous, you'll all hear it on your radios and your MTV's and MuchMusic's.  Get used to it...:

Second Season

Pain, fear, loss
Thoughts become a blur
Silence, envy
What do I know for sure?
Can these walls around me
Contain me, told my fears?
Explode on second season to rain down on the world...

Chorus:
Break the ropes that bind me
Follow the signs to the lead
And remember, this wouldn't happen
If the darkness had stayed silent

Can anyone near help?
Drowning in a sea of apathy
Busted emotions, like a broken puppet
The strings worn from abuse
Can you hear me call out, 'Please!  Don't leave!'
Need help in my weakness, but to no avail
Explode on second season to rain down on the world...

**Chorus**

Interlude: Probably guitar stuff/solo/whatever

**Chorus**

It's always in the second
It's always in the second
It's always in the second
It's always in the second

Too late, must depart, gone..."

"event","Stranglehold, mean cruel world.  This is the first entry in a long line of whining and moaning.  Why me?  Why now?  No one knows.  It's all fate, destiny.  I'm not usually negative, only when the sun shines and the moon is out.
More to follow.  Must depart for the unknown.  And Jackie Chan is my hero."

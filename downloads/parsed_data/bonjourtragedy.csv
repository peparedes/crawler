high today...lol...despite my lack of energy and potentially *high*
spirits...right...last night, instead of going to marks, i received a
call from gus and headed over to dougs where gus was staying! so we
just sat around by a fire and talked and whatever....then gus and i
""fell asleep"" in the tent together and woke up the next morning and i
took him home...<br>

But so far I have discovered that it is going to be a busy semester especially in two of my classes, which ironically I have the same professor for. I really like her, but she is in love with quizzes and I have them every class period basically. And I have an incredible amount of reading to do for those quizzes. I have problem read more in the last 2 days then I dont know, but I have read a whoooooole lot. But for the most part I think I am going to like my classes. I have all park and rec classes which is nice, no silly liberal studies."

"event","Okay so camp has finally begun. Staff week just finished up on Friday. Lots of work was completed as well as lots of bruises and bug bites received. Many ""special"" things happened as well. I dont really know what more to say than that since I have limited time, but I will say that some of the staff is well not all there and wont shut up or just plain annoying. 

I got home Friday for my almost weekend off. I dont think i did anything other than washing clothes, eating and sleeping. On saturday I had to drive the station wagon, that pretty much sucked cause you can only drive it in second gear adn I had to drive on 29 and 32 so I was going slow and I felt like such an idiot. But  I had to go pick up some piece of furniture that my mom bought and the station wagon is the only place that it would fit. So i got that special job. But later my mom, brother and I went and saw cars. It was silly. At night Meredith and I hung out but no one else was around, sad times, so we basically just went to Target and then hung around my house and talked. 

I have to head back to camp in a little bit. Its raining now and I dont like it. I wont be home again until next Tuesday. So I believe this week is when I shall begin writing everyone letters, YAY!!"

"event","Sooo my freedom of summer is almost over because I have to be at camp in a week, next friday night. It's sad though cause I feel like I havent done anything with my summer, nor have I gone anywhere. Last summer I did so many things before camp started, went to Colorado and Utah, went to 6 flags, DC, and hung out with all my friends. Now it seems like all I do watch TV and sit at home. I wish I could change that but I only have a week.

And I feel really distant from my friends especially everyone back in PA, but I guess thats because there IS a lot of distance, literally, between us. Sad times. But I expect everyone to write me happy little letters while I am at camp. My address is as follows:

Taralyn Trunk- Staff
BCMSR- Camp Oest
1929 Susquehanna Hall Rd
Whiteford, Md 21160

i dont think I have everyone's addresses sooo make sure I get those if you want me to write you a letter, otherwise write me first and include it and I will write back. Yay for mail."

"event","Yesterday we had our ""Homecoming."" It was quite silly and fun. We all got dressed up and went out to dinner at That's Amore. Many a people showed up. Laura, Amy R, Brooke, Justin, Amy C, Melanie, Meredith, Michelle, Amanda, and Myself. It was quite a nice dinner. I had never been there before but my ravioli was delicious. Meredith had the same and she enjoyed it too until she found traces of Ham. There isn't really much more to say about that, we ate and chatted. It was fun and nice to see everyone and those that we hadnt seen in FOREVER.

But when we got there is was hard to find a parking space cause Jazz Fest or something was going on. And it was even WORSE leaving cause the thing let out as we were leaving so we got in HORRIBLE traffic. Atleast some of us did. A few were able to slip out before it got bad cause they parked closer, but those of us high up in the farther away parking garage were trapped. It was BAD. I was able to run up and talk to Laura in her car and I even had to walk and inspect the traffic up ahead. I am NEVER going to a Jazz festival.

Today was a much slower day, but had more things involvved. Meredith and I went and took a walk around Centennial Lake since it was such a nice day, but we couldnt come up with something to do afterwards so we walked around my neighborhood and made stops at three of the local playgrounds. We amused ourselved taking pictures until we got the call from Julie saying that we could come over and hang out. 

SOoo we ate dinner with Julie and basically sat around and read Cosmo. It was quite enjoyable. Now my day is over and almost time for bed. sooo I dont know what. I guess I should get ready for that.

Adios."

You've been deeply wounded in the past, and you're still recovering from that hurt.

You expect a lot from your lover - you want the full package. You tend to be very picky.

In fights, you speak your mind and don't hold back. You know you're right, and you can get quite angry about it.

She spent her time on the computer while Kenny rooted behind the EMPLOYEE counter. This is the place where CUSTOMERS do not belong, but rather the employee which is SARA, not KENNY. Then she tried to make him leave but he picked up a hoagie and was going to throw it like a FOOTBALL, which it isnt. But then she returned to the computer. What a hard job that Sara character has.

Stay tuned for the next exciting episode of The Sara Show."

Today Ashlei, Megan and I went geocaching. The first and last caches that we attempted to be find we basically gave up on. For the first one we couldnt find where we were supposed to park and we didnt even see a trailhead anywhere nearby. Then the last one had a lot of tree cover so the GPS wasn't getting a good signal and couldnt decided which way it wanted up to go. We did find the second one that we looked for. I got some play-doh!!! It was rather exciting especially since yesterday i was sad that i didnt bring my play-doh and wouldnt have any for play-doh day.

After geocaching we were going to go to Walmart, but I didnt feel well so I came back to the dorms and slept for a little while. I just got up a few minutes ago. I feel better now, yay.

Last night we went and watched Crash over in McKay. It was a good movie, it was about diversity. I recommend it to all. Then afterward I was going to work on teh mountains of reading that i have to do. Yeah, that didnt happen. Ashlei and I ended up listening to silly songs and doing a bit of dancing. It twas fun but the homework still awaits... grrr.

oh yeah so at brunch today at the fluh, we definatley used styrafoam plates and cups and had plastic utensils. It was weird. But we were back to the normal stuff at dinner."

Ashlei and I went to walmart today. yeah so i realized that i dont know how to get to the one in butler, but i figured it out after we got back. we ended up going to the one in new castle, oh well.

yeah did you know that you can make your turn signals so that they wont work at all? well i can. its not fun. the car hates me. But i bought it gas today for $2.55. It was exciting. Its definaletly more expensive than that in Maryland."

"event","So Jeremy and I went geocaching today and we made complete fools out of ourselves. The map for this one cache made it look like it was actually on the side of 83. Yeah it wasn't. But we didnt find that one out until after we had walked a little bit on the side of the road and passed some motorcyclists who thought that we were insane. They said something about how it wasn't a great place for a stroll and asked if we needed any help. Of course when we got close to the cache we realized that it was on the other side of the fence. Great. Well we got to the parking lot where it was hiding and we couldnt find it. Then a car drove up to us and the driver starting talking to us. Apparently it was the guy who had hidden the cache. He said that we were close cause otherwise he would have given us a hint. Well we never found it. Jeremy was disappointed cause he couldnt find the first cache that he went in search of. This from the guy who didn't know what geocaching was a few hours earlier. Boys are silly. But we didnt find some other ones later in the day so that made him happier.

yeah so thats my interesting story for the day."

Also, quite recently I have finished my Senior year scrapbook, FINALLY. Seriously, it is about time, cause a whole year and then some have passed since then.



Anyway, today Julie, Meredith and I made our traditional gross, deathly sugary cupcakes. They just kill you they are soooooo sweeeeet. But they are enjoyable never the less.

"event","The past few days well like 5, i have basically spent hanging out with amy r. Sometimes others would be there, but for the most part it has been the 2 of us. One day the Amys adn I sat at Baskin Robbins for like 2 hours. It was fun and all cause we got to talk, but we definatley needed other things to do besides sitting around eating. But then the plan for the next day was to go to Taco Bell and hang out there cause according to Amy R. that is where all the guys with hot cars hang out. 

Yeah so the 2 of us went and yeah there were no. So we left. Decided that we were going to go to the pool hall cause that was like the only thing that we knew was open besides Double T. I however didnt feel like paying for something that i could do in my basement. So them Amy suggested Annapolis, cause of the Navy guys that are there, but neither of us knew how to get there and we couldnt go home to get directions cause it was already 10:30 at night and i parents would wonder where we were going at that hour. so we ended up drivign to Baltimore instead.

We got there around 11pm and we got some food at Hard Rock. We had the craziest waiter who kept coming over and talking to us. OUr food took forever to come and all we did was order and appetizer. He ended up rambling ot us about how they had a rush on them at night cause there had been a baseball and a football game. ANd he apparently can tell the difference between football adn baseball people. Football people are rowdy and drink heavily while baseball people concentrate more.. yeah yeah whatever. Amy and i were confused cause she is a football person and i am baseball. Later he demonstrated how he had to tell the person making our food how to put it together. And he decided that we needed entertaining so he started to dance. it was quite strange. 

After we ate we felt sooo sick, but the food was good. We walked around Baltimore looking at all the decorated crabs. There were some pretty cool ones. Random guys kept yelling to us cause they were drunk. kinda scary. When we got to baltimore an old man actually told us not to stay out to late. Amy was like what a nice old man, he reminds me of my grandpa cause every old drunk man does. We eventually left the city at like 1:30 and went home. It was a good night. We actually got out of Howard County!!!"

That was probably the most important thing that i did today. I guess the next important thing is the fact that i am in the process of cleaning up my rooming and putting the massive amount of clothes and other belongings away that i took to camp. Actually its more than just what i took to camp. I still have clothes and stuff to put away from when I went out west!! so yeah i have alot cleaning and things to find places for. It is going to take me basically atleast until the end of the week to finish all of it.

That will leave me with 2 weeks left to do everything else that i must accomplish before school starts. Hopefully Anne and i will get to make our weekend trip to Deep Creek Lake which would be tons and tons of fun. And give us one last chance to hang out before i head out to PA.

Ashley, Theresa, and I went to the Clarksville picnic. It twas fun, we got some silly things from the white elephant sale, especially ashley and her crazy books. 

After that we went to the mall and basically just got food. Later we met up with Meredith adn Julie and went and saw the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. It was really good. I do have to say that we are complete dorks that actually had a group hug in the theater when it was over, but thats okay as Ashley said everyone else was probably jealous of our friendship. 

When the movie was over we went to Julies house for some pizza cause by this time we were starved. I had never really been to her house before but theresa and ashley had plenty so I assumed that they could get me there, nope! i was wrong. we were so completely lost in the middle of the woods.

Meredith made us the coolest friendship braclets. There is a color for each of us. I wish Erin had been able to be there. We all wish you had been able to see the movie with us.

On the way home the battery light on my car came on. So that completely sucked. I now can't drive the car until it is looked at. So now i am stuck driving the station wagon to camp, but i guess its better than not driving at all."

The theme this summer is Knights of the Roundtable.

In other news, my brother and I had to help my dad pack the car today for the trip to Colorado. It was a mock-packing. It was really dumb. My dad even had lists made up everything that we need to bring to Colorado. It was so stupid. My brother and i made fun of it alot. My dad was taking everything SOOOOO seriously and my brother and I were joking around about everything. My dad got mad at us and made us leave to go to my mom's then yelled at us for not saying goodbye. Grrrr. the situation get soo frustrating and annoying sometimes. But i dont' know how my dad is going to last for 6 days it the car for 12 hrs each and then 11 days in Colorado with me and my brother. It could get ugly."

"event","Well I have been home for like a week and a half so far and things are going pretty well. It didn't tak etoo long for me to get used to being back at home, mostly because I didn't get used to being at school and actually enjoying it until the end of the second semester. But I enjoy being home and seeing friends that i haven't seen in sooo long.

I went to the mall a couple of times. Once with both Amys and another with Ashley and Meredith. The first weekend after school ended I went to Disney World with my dad and brother. It was lots of fun. We went to all 4 parks in like 2.5 days. Lots of pictures were taken with my new digital camera, yay, and it has one of those printer dock thingys. Way cool, but i haven't tried that out yet.

Hmm alway went minigolfing with the Amys and then we hung out at Baskin Robins again. I think we decided that it was going to be our hang out spot because there are a couple of them open near us now. Yesterday I went to Hersheypark with the Venturing Crew. Although the only kids there were my brother and myself and then Meredith joined us. It was soo much fun. We rode practically every ride in the park. Hardly anyone was there at all. It was the best day to be there. We even went on teh water rides adn froze, but it was still fun.

There are so many things that I want to do over the summer and I dont have much time to do them. But next friday the 27th a bunch of us are going to go to 6flags. yay for coupons. I leave for Colorado on the 30th and a couple days after I get back staff week starts at Oest.

Meredith-- we gotta figure out when we are going to go to an Orioles game
Theresa-- still want to go to NYC? we'll have to find time to do that too.

So many things to do and not enough time."

"event","The school year is finally over and i can't believe it. I actually survied my first year of college out of state. Its amazing to think that almost a year ago I was soo miserable and wanted to come home. I wsas even planning out where i would transfer to and so forth. But things totally changed for me during the second semester even though I had already decided that i wasnt going ot transfer and was going to put up with being in PA because of my major. It may have taken me a long time to make friends, but i am soo glad that I did. However late i joined the group I am so gald that I did. You guys are the best. You all welcomed me with open arms and I am so grateful. My complete attitude about SRU flipped around. I went from wanting to be home so badly and crying about having to leave Maryland to crying because i was going to miss you all so much. I had so much fun with yall second semester and I can't believe that i am actually saying that I can't wait for school to start again so that I can see all of you and have many more fun times.

Jen- Thanks for always asking me to sit with yall at lunch so many times, you know I never would have on my own. I will defenitaly miss ya and all those fun times at meals, you are the best for being my gateway into the group when Megan wasn't around.

Sara- CSBF, I always enjoyed getting stuck with you at all the girl scout events.. ballons, gingerbread in an orange, making necklaces, i guess that is why you're my CSBF, and i realized that we became CSBFs on April 1 (the lock-in) so I guess MAYDAY is very appropriate (1 month!! haha)

Larissa- i shall miss ya especially since i am in Maralynadnad or whatever state it is that I visit,lol. You better hope that the cowboy bear stays at home next year. If not you better hope he doesnt find his way to your room, hehe, he won't i promise.

Ashlei- I miss ya soo much roomie. I can't wait till we actually get to share a room instead of me always visiting. Watching our shows without you just isn't the same. But remember no matter how far away we are love can build a bridge.

Megan- MAA!!!! yay no more spending 5 long hours in a car with you listening to Disney music with you. lol just kidding those were some wild times. I will always remember the easter bunny walking down the street. You will always be my PRM adn camping buddy. 

Erik- I know I blocked you from my life many a times, but you deserved those, I do not dress like my roommate. Maybe one day she will give you the mountain dew. I'll miss ya next year, but Im sure you will be around alot, like my 3rd roommate.

Bill- Billy Badness, I am glad that you respect my sarcasm, and I hope you are keeping those forest fires under control. You are a crazy kid. Im glad you enjoy geocaching.

Kellyn- I didnt get to see much of you, but the times that I did they were always crazy. I think the first time i met you was during the dance party. But next year I am sure that I will get to get to know you more since you will be upstairs from me. I am lookign forward to it!!

Alex- you weren't around much when I was, but that will definately change since you will be down the hall from me!! its rather exciting.


I will miss you all. I wish Maryland wasn't so far away. If any of you come down to the Baltimore/DC area you better give me a call. Maybe I will come up with a plan so that I can visit all of you. Much love to all."

"event","I haven't really written much lately just stupid quizzes that I found kinda amusing. So this weekend I went to Cafe with Julie, it was the cookout. It was goodtimes, but eventually it got kinda boring cause there wasn't really anything going on. Afterwards I went to visit everyone at Relay for Life. I was there a little while and then my roommate called me and that never happens. She had locked herself out of the room. How stupid. So i went and let her in. I eventually made it back to the relay. Later a huge storm came through complete  swith rain, lightening and thunder. They got everyone inside and I decided that I didnt want to walk back to Founders in that weather. I attempted to sleep on the Field House floor, yeah not too effective. Not comfortable at all, I slept all of like half and hour. I went back to founders then cause the storm had pased. After I got myself some quality sleep I basically spent the rest of the day working on a take home test.

Sunday it snowed--not cool.

Last night was the Country Concert. It was the Povertyneck Hillbillies, Chris Cagle and Trace Adkins. It was sooooo much fun. Ashlei and I actually got pretty close. Even Jen was enbracing the music of our people, I was excited for her. We will get you liking more country before you know it. You dont have to like it all, but im sure there is more that you will like. Yay for Jen!!! After the concert i went to Ashlei's room and we burned the PNH cd from Billie. And of course crazy times took place.

Here is your poem Ashlei!!!

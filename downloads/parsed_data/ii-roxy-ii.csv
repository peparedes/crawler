<P><FONT color=#ffffff><STRONG>So.. prom is in 2 weeks. Not even..just over one week. I don't have a date, which doesn't matter. And I don't have a hair appointment, OR a dress. I think that's the</STRONG> <STRONG>most important part. Altho Mister Hunt seems to think it would be pretty rad if I showed up in a t-shirt and jeans. Doubtful. A lot of people I know aren't even going. Oh well.. I know what I'm doing afterwards and that's all that matters. Right girls? ;) Anywho.. ugh I'm so full, it seems like I've been eating all day. Well I sort of have.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;what I do best tho. Wow, Senses Fail rocks my face. So lately I've been doing this really weird thing and writing down my feelings and they run through my head. It's kind of weird after a few days, I go back and read it and I'm like whoa. Things change so quickly sometimes, and other times they stay the same.. Some things get worse, others get better. But I've realized I analyze everything. Is that normal? What is normal? I guess it doesn't matter. I'm just going about my business and that's all that matters. Wow lately rumors have been flying by my face. I'm gettin really sick of hearing about everyone's dirt. So Spring Break was fun. Too short though. SB was cool, met some cool kids. But I can't wait until July.. I'm going to Chicago for the 4th and stayin for at least a week. Then Warped Tour shall arrive! Wow that's gunna be so gnarly. I'm so comfortable right now I could just fall asleep. I think I'm going to lay down soon. Hey my birthday is in a couple weeks! Uh huh, April 10th for those of you who have forgotten. (&amp; don't forget-money is a good gift *winkwink*)</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#993399>My relatives were just over last night. They're going back to Chicago tomorrow. I only got to see them once for 2 hours&nbsp;the whole week they were here though. I wish I could see my family and friends from Illinois more often. So yeah.. Ann and I have become awesome friends and I love her to death! We have so much fun together and I'm so glad I met her. I've also been hangin out with Bri more, seems like we hardly ever get the chance to spend time together anymore, since she switched to Cape and all. But a true friend is a friend forever! Stacey and I have been talking more lately too which is good. I love you woman! I love all of you. Well, with the exception of a select few. Heh.. So get this. I've been single for.. ::counts on fingers:: .. well ""technically"" I've been single for like 6 months. Wow that's odd for me. But I've had my flings here and there. I honestly feel good about myself right now though. I've been having a lot of fun lately not having to worry about all the downfalls of being in a relationship. It does get lonely but not when you're taking advantage of the&nbsp;freedom! Nah but I guess I'm just not really&nbsp;interested in anyone right now. Which is pretty damn cool, because I always have some sort of a stupid crush, one after another, and it gets old. I'm just waiting for my prince charming to fall into my lap or something. Until then I'm layin low.. Should I go to prom? I don't really wanna go alone when like everyone and their mom has a date. Oh well. Doesn't matter either way. I'm blabbering now so I'm gunna take up that nap offer.. that I kinda&nbsp;offered myself. Weird. Anywho, peace killa.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>

When the cracks in your path get wider, get a running head start. Don't let anything stand in your way or stop you from taking on the world. Don't let anyone knock you down, but build your confidence. Because one day those things won't matter anymore. But if you let them affect you now, some day it will make a difference. Some day it will change everything. And that day you'll either have regrets or you may just be thankful. But don't look back, because you might miss something in front of you that's meant for you. And don't look away, don't let yourself get sidetracked. Keep your eyes on the ball! 'Cause that ball has got your name on it and it's waiting for you to take that bat to it. And when you swing, it's gunna feel good. And when you hit a home run, it's gunna feel great. And when you win, it's gunna show you that perserverence pays off. Use the talents you were given. Live it up and let the little things go. Be everything you can be, and don't let anyone change who you are or how you think, but learn to adjust to different situations. Don't be stubborn but be strong, because only the strong survive...</FONT></EM></STRONG>"

Today I went to the beach. It was lots of fun..
ehh scratch that.
Anyways, I went jetskiing at the beach today and I had a blast.
And yesterday some guys were hitting on my girl and I at the beach so we went and sat down so they'd get the point that we weren't interested, and one guy flicked us off.. so I ran up behind him as he was about to wave to these girls and yelled ""wave with this ******!"" and depantsed him infront of the whole FMB population. What a good time it was.. indeed.
Back to school in 2 more days.
I need a tan, like whoa. >.< And Brianna needs to hurry up and call me. Tomorrow I think I may head back to the beach. It's been a while since I've gone there 3 consecutive days..wonderful isn't it?
Well it's time to go dream of men in tights.. especially Ryan in those undies, Oo baby! Gives me chills all down my spine.
lol -I like to run around in my underoos- I love you Bri.
Alright well, I donno about you but I'm gunna get some 'shuteye'..go have a chicken nugget for all I care ;]

"event","<font color=""#3399cc"" size=""3"">well it has definately been a while guys! this is what has happened in my life for the past...well decade. i have a beautiful girlfriend named Kathryn Phillips whom i love very deeply. we spend every moment that we have together and we are great for each other. i am now a member of APA, the American Poolplayers Association and i won my last match tuesday night. that is probably what i am going to do with my life, at least i hope. i am probably one of the most talented hustlers that you will ever see. i find a way to take your money and make you enjoy it. thats difficult. i can beat people that have been playing for 40 years and i have been playing for close to 6 months now. thats fucking stupid on every level. i have a lot of new friends and i am offically a bad ass according to them because i scare people when i have a pool cue in my hands. i drive a '07 ford mustang and i love it. her name is sally. a moment of silence for frank the tank........thats enough. i am going to start the kennel that i used to operate at my house in whitmire back up again, hopefully raising english bulldogs, pit bulls, and rottweilers. my life has been difficult lately, but a lot of it has been because it has been almost five years since the death of my father. i am getting better at not letting it bother me, but it still takes its toll on me from time to time. i am definately a pool hall junky, and everyone needs to see Poolhall Junkies btw. greatest movie ever hands down. i usually watch it 4-6 times a week. no joke. i have a dog named Boss who is a Rottweiler/Doberman. he is defiantely a badass. he recovered from parvo in 3 days. WHAT THE FUCK! that never happens. ever. i bought Kathryn&nbsp;a 10 week old pit bull for our three month anniversary and her name is Harley. she isnt that badass, but she is sweet considering the breed, and that she is a blue pit. i also still have Rocky, the english bulldog, he is defiantely still a badass and he has calmed down a lot. i think that everyone should know that i am finally deeply in love. thats awesome. i love waking up every morning knowing that i can act the same around my girlfriend as i can around the boys, and that is fucking awesome! never felt anything like this and i hope that it never goes away! some things happen for a reason, and i think that her falling into Lake Hartwell had a purpose! i love everyone reading this. i want you guys to know that. have a good day and leave some feedback. its been a while!</font>"

"event","A lot of things have happened since the last time that I have done this...not really. But one good thing did happen, I grew a penis. Believe me, miracle grow is not just for flowers! Football games are crappy right now, and I have been sitting here bored out of my mind looking for something to do. No Christmas has not been great this year. Actually it has pretty much sucked. It always goes by too fast and you never have time to enjoy it, you know what I mean? It is like you have been waiting for 364 days until you turn 21 so that you can LEGALLY party your heart out and it seems as if it passes you by in five minutes. Horrible. That is how every holliday is now. What is up with that? I really don't get it. Every other day just pokes along and you can remember ever single smell from that day because they all seemed as if they lasted for about 9 hours each. Sure, I try to enjoy thi season, but you know that it gets harder and harder to because of everything being so rush rush rush. Really and honestly, if it is going to go by this fast with everyone missing the true meaning of Christmas then every year the date should be random. Like a little snake is following behind you for a month or two before it bites your right in the bunkus. Oh yea, I still go out with Rebecca if anyone was wondering about that one. I want fireworks. Blow crap up. OK forget that I just said that. At least it would be more fun than sitting around doing nothing. Burn something. DO NOT BURN A PING PONG BALL!!! Honestly. Don't even attempt it. Especially when it is in your hand and you are holding it over a candle in Rebecca's house to see how long it would take it to burn and it didn't take too long and it slightly burned your hand so you threw it up against a wall and it just shot all over hardwood floors without leaving a burn mark until it was put out by Rebecca by a mixture of milk and water. OK that was rediculious. Anyway... I just want to tell all of my friends that I hope that they have a Merry Christmas and blow stuff up with Roman Candles on New Years.

Merry Christmas!

"event","I really hate the feeling of a hangover in the morning when you haven't been drinking. I think that I have some of the weirdest dreams in the world. First, I dreamed that I was a baseball player on my television screen and I couldn't get out. No matter how hard I beat my television, he would not allow me to escape. That one was a little queer because I'm a little scared of video games now. Then I dreamed that I was chasing Josh, who was in a little Saturn, with my mom's car. We were racing and when I stopped, he kept going over this hill where there was a license check. I accidentally sped through the first set of cops but I stopped through the second set of cops. When I was stopped, I was pulled over by none other than Rod Farva. He said the obvious, ""license and registration chicken fucker."" I just sped right through because Josh was beating me and I hate that. I saw the car right beside the road but I didn't see Josh. When I got out of my car and over to the Saturn and right when I went over there Raul asked if I could haul his refrigerator full of beer for him. I couldn't because I didn't have the hooks on mom's car, but Raul said that I could use his car, which I literally could squeeze one of my arms into, but not even comfortably. I naturally asked him if this was one of those Mexican 1-seater cars and he said ""dur, what do you think it is?"" So I got in, got the stick shift out of my ass and hauled the refrigerator full of beer to my house where we proceeded to have a party. Now thats a dream. I should have more like that. HILARIOUS. This sucks though because I am at my house by myself and there is no band today and what sucks even more is that there is no Becca. I am getting bored as hell now. I need to go piss on something I guess. That would probably make me happier. Guus we need to do something this week. No doubt. I Still Love Sctoch!"

I haven't gotten a good chance to talk to Becca tonight, can't get her on her cell, and now theres the big news. Steven got percussion captain over Kory. THAT IS BULLSHIT!!! What in the HELL was Kevin thinking. Steven can't lead a line, hell he can't even lead a line segment, much less a line. He sucks up, thats why he got the position. He didn't deserve it, he got it through ass-kissing. Thats what he did. Kory, if you read this man, you are the one that deserves this position, not Steven. I miss the good days when the best man gets the job, not the best suck up that is looking for an advantage. I do not respect that in anyone.Sorry Steven, but you are NOT the leader of NDL and I will not treat you with that respect until you give that to me as your equal you kniving little fag."

"event","I absolutely love the beach. It has got to be the one place on earth where you can let everything fly and have the time of your life. Thats especially great when you are with one of your best friends. Brig and I had an AWESOME time and brought back some great stories. First, Thursday, the day that we got to Cherry Grove, Brigman locked the keys in the condo and we had to wait for 3 freaking hours until his Aunt Sally got to the condo to get her to open it. Thats a start. Friday, Tony gets the piss burned out of his skin and it hurt like hell! After the day in hell, Brig and I played putt-putt where I beat him by 6 strokes, go figure. After that, we went to Hooters to eat and thats where the fun started. I order New Orleans Shrimp off of their seafood menu and it was great, but not on my stomach. After we get our orders, I spill my drink all over the place. Now I'm not wet at all, but Brigman looks like he pissed all over himself and its just too funny, but I don't laugh because I made him look that way, not him. After we get finished eating, I spot some pool tables in the back which were screaming come play me. We went down there, got our asses kicked twice so its time to leave right? WRONG!!! Tony has what I will call a ""problem"" with his stomach. I proceed to go to the bathroom to extinguish my ""problem"" when I smeel what I thought was my ""problem"" in the bathroom, and now I have a different ""problem."" I race to the stall in enough time to throw up for the first time. After the first time, I looked at my ""results"" to find that they look exactly the same as they went down. BLLAAARRRRRGGGHHH!!! Thats #2 and now I feel better. We leave and when I get back to the condo, I have to eat again, go figure! Sunday, while leaving, I buy Becca a present because I love her that much, and Brigman dents the goat on the driver's side. When we finally get to Columbia, we stop at the mall. Brigman gets a T-Shirt and I get some grub. Ready to go again. Not this time. The goat won't start. This sucks. After waiting until the mall closes, we get her started and head for home. Great vacation. The best I've ever been on. I couldn't help but think about Wednesday, July 20th though. That has to be the best day of my life. Thats the day that Becca and I got together. Thats amazing! She is the greatest person on the earth and I don't know if I deserve someone like her. Its just weird how she became so important so quickly. She is all that I need besides food. I tell her things that I can't tell anyone else. Its amazing. Funny how life changes so quickly and you have no idea that its going to happen. I have no arguments about this change though. She is mine. I know that. She is the only one that I want. I plan to make it stay that way too. Can't wait to see you Becca. I love you! :-)"

"event","I finally got to see my newphew today. Thank God that I did. My heart has been hurting to see his little ass in a long time. I have never felt so bad as the day that he left for wherever he lives. He has always been MY boy even though he isn't MY son. I have always treated him better than his father did. His first word was Tony if that gives you any kind of indication as to how much he means to me. I taught him to shoot basketball, play baseball, and run with the football so that he didn't get killed. I love Ethan. He has always benn my biggest fan and I have always been his. He is the only person that I have ever gooten too close to and have never been hurt. Sure, he can upset me at times, but who hasn't gotten upset even with there best friend. I love being with him. The three months that I have been without him have been tough. Some of the most difficult times of my life. But the thing is that difficult times make us stronger people. I appreciate that life works that way, but it would be a lot more fun if there wasn't so much heart ache. Hes my boy and I love him genuinely in my heart. I think that he may be the only person that I have truely fallen in love with. His first word Tony and from right there, it was all him in my life. Things change, but my love for him has been the same and never-changing since he was born. Thats the way that love works. At least that is the way that true love works. It is never conceided or selfish, it is always thinking about the other person rather than yourself. Thats the way the way that true love works. I really love that boy and I hope that my son is ever bit as special as he is to me and I know that he will be!"

"event","Ok, heres the thing. Everyone that I know is going to the beach. Thats not a bad thing, but the bad thing is that I'm not going anywhere. I will find something to do, as I always do. Definately going somewhere Saturday, but not sure yet. I hope that I am lucky enough to be able to be lazy today. That would be GREAT! I don't want to do anything besides go somewhere, but I doubt that that is going to happen. I do not think that mom will let me out of the house today. But I can always pull the Tony Crosby thing and she can't resist it. AAAHHH, the power of bull shit. I would love to go hang out with Raul today and get something to eat. That would actually be wonderful! Have to check in with him to see. Sounds like a good plan to me. I got ABSOLUTELY no sleep last night. Well, maybe 3 hours, but thats not sleep. Thats a summer nap. I can't live off of that. I can't do the same thing this week that I did a few weeks ago by getting 11 hours of sleep over 3 days. NAH, I think that I will not resort to that unintentional plan. I need to go and throw today, but it is so freaking hot outside. I know that if I don't do it now though then I won't be able to during band camp. Too many things that I wanted to do this summer that I haven't been able to do. Kinda crazy. But thats the way my summers usually turn out. Crappy as usual. Not going to be able to go to the Dream Theater concert because Amanda graduates the VERY next day. Haven't gone to the beach, which absolutely sucks. Whatever. One more year and I'm out of this hell hole! Thats all that I know!"

"event","Dude, someone actually stole my baseball. WHAT FAGS! It was probably Josh. We are always pulling shit like that on each other. Wanted to go outside and throw, but obviously I'm not going to be able to. This kinda blows. Now I get to be lazy though, because about an hour ago Josh and I installed a window air conditioner in or ""computer room"" so that it isn't so damn hot in there. It gets so hot in my house that the devil would say, ""look, I gotta be getting back to hell! Can't miss that brunch with Hitler."" Too hot man. I am lucky that I have an AC in my room. I always hide out in here for the simple fact that I fear that if I enter into another room of the house I will lose all of the weight that barely exists on my body to begin with. I love summer, but it is coming to an end VERY quickly. This is supposed to be MY summer. So far, no vacation or anything. That sucks. I need something to do. In a few weeks, all of my friends that were seniors will be leaving for college and that is going to hurt REALLY bad. You get too close to people too quickly and then they are gone. Its hard to cope with sometimes. When you've already lost a lot of things in your life, it becomes more and more difficult to adjust. I'm cool though. Everyone knows that I am strong with my emotions. I try not to let things bother me. The truth is that sometimes you can't help it. Life does come at you fast. The key is to read it and always have the answer to it. Still, its harder than it sounds. I've gotten too close to a few people that I never thought would leave. Now, I know that they must. I just hope that I don't have to be without a few of them. Some very good friends will be gone, and I just want them to be there with me. I know that that doesn't always happen. Some things never change. My heart has never changed. Ever since I moved to Newberry I have had my eye on one ""thing."" But that one ""thing"" has always benn occupied by someone else. I don't have a lot of time, so I know that I have to do the manly thing and act. Mr. Clutch has to do it again, and I will. Those kind of situations are the ones that I thrive on. I want to be the one that everyone relies on. If I screw a situation up, I can deal with it. But if I am never given the opportunity in that situation, I can not. Thats just not the way that I am. I've always wanted to have the ball in game 7 of the World Series because I know that no one else is more capable than I am to strive in a pressure situation. This is one of those situations that may not change history, but it could change my life. Thats something that I have to put myself on the spot for. This change that I am talking about would make me the happiest person on the earth. The jewel that I am after is in my sight now, but the hard thing is to take the action and roll through with my courage. DIFFICULT! Guys, you know that I will do ANYTHING if I am dared to do it. You have seen me shit off of a bridge. Piss off of the High School, and on the bushes while Mr. B walked out. This is one that you don't have to dare me to do. Its that important. I will do this, but I know that it is going to take my courage to do it!"

"event","Drumline practice is finally here. THANK GOD! I have waited this entire summer to get hot and sweaty in the hopes that NDL will have another perfect season! Everyone is letting their hair grow out and I hope that it pays off. Having the universal look of shagginess should give us the extra edge this year! I have just finished eating my breakfast and am now about to take my shower. I hate eating before I take a shower, but today I was extremely hungry, so to the fridge I went. HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH. Gotta love that. Should be an interesting day of practice considering that Allie has poison ivy, Kory and Lydia, I mean Steven are both gone to the beach. I have no idea of how many rookies will be there. I hope a lot so that I get to pick on them. I love initiation! Funny stuff at times. I never knew that 8th and 9th graders were so gullable. I know that I wasn't that stupid going into marching band my first year. I came in ready to kick ass. Thats my philosophy. KILL KILL KILL! lol! I just enfoy Saturdays for college football and marching band. Everytime our drumline will take home the trophy. Thats why I love it so much! Having fun is my deal. I always have fun on the field. Time to do it again for my last year. This blows. One more year. Hmmmmm.....yea this does."

"event","Why is it that every time that I am around that Glanville kid I always seem to have fun. She is amazing. Glad that she is a good friend. Today I had to go to Newberry to move things from my mom's ""storage"" building to our house here in Whitmire. Josh caught me while I was still in Whitmire running a few erands in town and said that he would help. Good!!! More company means less boredom! We got fuses for his truck and went to get somehting to eat. Leanna called and said that she could meet us somewhere and we met her in Game Stop. Josh and I wanted to get a look at what NCAA Football 2005 was going to be like. Pretty good actually. Had a lot of fun on it. Leanna called Becca and at that point my day just took off. It is good that you have your best friend already with you, but Becca just brightens up a room. We decided to go to my house to watch a movie. The movie of choice turned out to be White Noise. Great movie. The girls got the shit scared out of them which turned into loads of fun for me and Josh! At any random time when the music got loud, I would grab Becca's leg and she would just hit the wall. FUNNY!!! I really had a good time though. I was actually upset that I couldn't stay with her a little longer. Fun to be around. All I know is that she just needs to break up with Rob, I hate him. Don't care if you read this Rob. I do. With a passion man!!! I like Becca a lot and your just a homo man. Sorry can't help it. I didn't catch any of the All-Star Game except Andruw's home run. Go figure. And I called the shot too. Left Field and DDDDEEEEEEEEPPPP! Nice hit Andruw. Really enjoyed the girl's and Josh company together. Great time. Gonna Turn in. Gotta go make NDL a drumline again tomorrow! STAY BLACK!!!"

"event","If you are on of the 6 people that didn't catch the history last night, Bobby Abreu hit 41 total Home Runs in the Century 21 Home Run Derby. He set the record by 16 Home Runs. He also set the single round record of 24, breaking the previous record of 15 set by Minguel Tejada in 2004 in Houston. I figure that I will use my picture of Mickey Mantle for this entry. My favorite sport is baseball. Go Figure! I have had a pretty good day so far except for having to clean my fish tank and clean up the melted ice cream that I left in my room last night after my MOM spilled it. I hate that crap. Its queer! So far, I am going to Newberry to get some things out of my mom's old house in Newberry and hopefully meet up with dome friends on the way. I have no idea of what the future holds in store for Lucy and I. I am just going to leave my options open, just as I told Leanna last night. Thats the best thing to do. It becomes easier to find the person that you really like instead of devoting your entire existence to one person. I have to go on the record of saying that there is nothing wrong with devotion. Guys, just make sure that your girl is devoted to you before you even THINK about devoting yourself to her. That way you can't get screwed over. Believe me when I tell you this. Not all girls are, but most girls are evil, kniving little bitches that would like nothing more than to take your emotions in her hand and toy with them all day long. Thats a girl thing. I know, it may be harsh, but I don't care. Thats what I do. I speak of what I know. I know of what I have spoken. I love women, as you may have found out by my previous entries, but I can also hate them if they get on my bad side. I love playing baseball because then I am at home. It gives me more life than I ever thought that I had! Mickey Mantle is the best ball player to ever suit up. Everyone needs to remember that! THE BEST EVER! I just want to be able to play with his intensity some day. Thats a good dream to keep!"

"event","This is for all the ladies that think they know what guys like and hate. This is what I hate about women: #1- When they tell you they have better things to do #2- When they say that they can find better than you #3- When its ""That time of the month"" every day of the week #4- When women show WAY TOO MUCH clevage but they some reason hate you when you compliment them on it #5- Women that apparently ""enjoy watching sports"" #6- Women that hide themselves from the things that could be ""potentially bad"" without taking into consideration that it could be ""potentially good"" as well #7- Women that ""don't party"" but get drunk on a regular basis #8- Women that like guys for the simple fanct that they are:
A. EXTREMELY WEALTHY
B. EXTREMELY HOT
C. EXTREMELY ACTS LIKE A PRICK
D. EXTREMELY NICE CAR/TRUCK/BACK SEAT
E. ALL OF THE ABOVE
All of these are bull crap #9- Women who have the thought stuck in their minds that they are attractive to every man that has ever walked the planet, even though they weigh over 400 pounds and have a hobby for getting tattoos on their breasts #10- Women who are vegetarians #11- Women that stay away from men because of the thought that they may get hurt and never allow anyone to become close to them #12- Those women are usually the ones that are worth the time usually which makes me hate it even more #13- Women that like you ""a lot"" and eventually you commit to them only to find out that they like you a lot as their friend which is translate into manly talk as I was screwing with your emotions and I love to watch men get their hearts torn out.
Things that I like about women:
#1- Being able to act the same way around them as you act around the guys
#2- Having the mutual trust in one another that bonds you together
#3- Women that have a personality
#4- Women that know in their hearts that they are beautiful but will never admit it
#5- Not having to worry about the next day, but only about the moment because you are both committed on forever
#6- Being able to fall in love with the woman of your dreams and having the comfort that they are going to wake up and feel the same way about you
#7- The love that is shared among the couple when they are together not only by their words, but by their actions. The feeling that it is only the two of them in a room that is crowded with more than your fair share of ex-girlfriends and arch rivals.

Thats what love should be about and thats what I love and hate about the female species"

"event","I love playing pool with people that ABSOLUTELY suck. Yea, I'm talking about Brigman Kinard. Even though he doesn't suck, I think that he does compared to me. And I'm not that good either. I also hate when you make plans to do something and they get thrown back into your face. I'm talking about when I went to the Lighthouse Saturday for the specific purpose of talking to Lucy. She knew that and when I tried talking to her she completely blew me off (not in that way). She knows that it is difficult for me to walk up to her and talk to her in public. I can't help the shyness factor, which completely SUCKS! I just told her that I was going to play pool and that was the whole conversation for that night. This morning I called her and our conversation lasted 13 seconds... not minutes. I said hey. What are you doing. She said nothing, I gotta go to this party. I said Ok............She said but ummm wait. Bye. CLICK. Thats it. PISSED ME OFF! I hate that crap. She knows that I'm pissed. Thats why I am gonna call her and talk to her in a few. Talking online is an easy way to pass time. LOVE IT. Gotta go and talk to peachblush so TTYL."

"event","Today I have done nothing outside of eating, watching the Braves and sleeping. I hate it when you sometimes try too hard to do something and it eventually backfires. Not necessarily backfire, but it just hasn't happened the way that you wanted it to yet. I'm talking about the Braves in second place and Lucy. The Braves are in second place which COMPLETELY pisses me off for the simple fact that I am used to them already 10 games up on the competition by this time. Its hard to adjust to something like that so quickly. The other thing is that Lucy and I are ""friends"" today. It isn't a step down from what we were before, but it isn't the step that I wanted to take. I wanted up, not down, but not at the same level either. Its kinda crazy when you think about it. I have brought her something everytime that I have seen her. That isn't necessarily becasue I am trying to win her over, which I am, but it is because I wanted to. I never expect something in return for the things that I give her. That is like a cardinal sin for giving someone a gift. While I don't feel left out in the dark with her, I do not feel that everything is happening the way that it should by now. She is very special. Its as simple as that. I will never give up on her and I shouldn't. We don't know each other as much as we should. I think that may be the main reason that we have not progressed into a couple yet. With me, its what you see is what you get. I'm not gonna change for anyone. Thats the way I have always rolled and it will be that way as long as I live. She has the most beautiful everything that I have ever seen in my life. She is the closest thing to perfect that I have ever seen in my life. What can you say about people like that? There is nothing that you can. Its either that you can't say anything or you can't say enough. Its both with her. Weird that I of all  people have nothing to say about someone. I guess thats what it is about her. We both like to be funny, which is great! I hate people that try their best to never crack a smirk. They are assholes. I can make anyone smile and that is one of my defining qualities. I don't care who you are. I can make the President laugh while he is discussing war with the cabinet. I don't care. Everyone needs to laugh and I like that she feels the same way. I am graduating this year and I am not about to leave someone like her behind me. I want her to be with me. I want to have the comfort that she will never have to worry about anything else in her life. I know that I could give her that. She seems to be motivation and it is weird that all of my life I have tried to find someone like her and all of a sudden she just falls rigth into my lap. AMAZING. Its all Brigman's fault. If I didn't see her at the lighthouse while I was illegally driving Brigman to see his ""friend that is a girl"" named Melody, then I would have never even thought of talking to Lucy. I also have to thank my cousin Elissa for setting me up with her. The truth is that I am never shy around anyone that I DON'T like, but if its around someone that I DO like, then its different. I don't know why I'm like that. I think that it hurts me sometimes. I try my best to play it off, but even my buddies know the truth. They see stright through me. Thats what sucks about it. If they ask me about how I feel about her and I say that I don't know, they know that I am giving them a lot of crap. Thats friends for you. I have a lot of them and I love every one of them. It is going to be tough to leave them in a year and I know that my life will be gone then. But if I am the luckiest man on the Earth, then maybe I will not have to forget about Lucy when I leave. Thats my MAIN goal for my senior year. I have to win her heart."

"event","Today has sucked. Eleven hours of sleep over the past three days and I have been dying for some cuddle time with Lucy. Crazy things happen when you don't get to see a girl that you REALLY like for an extended period of time. That really busts my bubble. Worked on 5 hours of sleep today with seven hours of work. Do the math and add it up. i should be dead by now. I need Tony Time and Lucy Time and NDL Time and HAMMER TIME, of course. Had to throw in a little variety in there. Worked and made 60 dollars which is a pretty good deal.Awesome drumline with a little bit of greatness mixed into it. I like shooting bottle rockets onto the interstate and i don't know why. But its funny. Short one but I'm tired. Good Fight and Good Night."

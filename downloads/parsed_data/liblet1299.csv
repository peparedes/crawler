"event","So, it has been a long ass time since my last entry. Not sure why but other things were going on.  Anyway, I moved to Columbus, OH. I wish I could say that is was terrific, but I cant. I am also in the market for a new job.  Currently I am a bank teller, which is also terrible. I realize that when you say bank teller out loud the first image that pops into most of your heads is probably some woman with a bad haircut and shoulder pads, which is the first image that comes to my mind anyway.  However, you dont need to worry about me wearing shoulder pads.  

Some of the fam are coming up today. My baby broheim Jammin will be coming up with his girlfriend. Chirst knows when they will show up. They are driving from SWEET, and when I say sweet I mean terrible, Tiffin and Ben normally doesnt wake up till 2 in the afternoon. My dad and step-mom will also be arriving sometime soon actually.  The only plus side is I will be going to a hockey game, and since I have no outlet for my newly discovered agro side I will have to let it loose by watching other individuals beat the shit out of each other on the ice. Anyway, enjoy your weekends, maybe in three months you'll get another entry."

"event","I need more buddies, fucking add me already!  Anyway, today was amusing. Last night I got way too drunk!  I suffer from either selective memory or I blacked out because today I heard many amusing stories about myself. Needless to say I was in rare form, and I don't mind that except for the fact that I can't enjoy the memories of what I did. 
Harpo is still being a twat faced pussy lick ass.  I actually think I am just going to pretend she doesnt exist because she is irritating like a hemorrhoid, except she never goes away.  I haven't spoken to baby broheim in a while. I wonder if he is enjoying frat life-you know elephant chains and sponge cookie.  Speaking of terrible...what the fuck is Sorority Life doing back on MTV  or Fraternity Life for that matter?  Are writers really that desperate for money?  I mean that is reality TV gone wrong.  Who gives a shit about Greek Life in Buffalo New York...I dont know someone respond and amuse me please...."

"event","Ok, so maybe it's me, but I never thought Mr. Rogers was the most child friendly man.  When I heard he died today I was not very remorseful.  Call me a bitch, but my most fond memory, that had to do with him, was when my bro-heim and I-along with my God mother, drove to his house and flipped him off 1) because he sucked and 2) because my mom just told us she was getting remarried and we needed a stress reliever.  I dunno, as long as Julia Child stays alive forever I will be fine.  Did you know that she is like 6' 2. What a she-beast! I love it!"

"event","Ok, so yesterday I tried to post a message and it totally didnt work! I am really upset about that because it was BY far the funniest thing I have ever written. Needless to say the humor in me has been lost.  For all of you who care I have been having digestion problems lately.  Wednesday I have to go to a Dr. in Utica.  For all of you who dont know upstate NY very well, Utica is like the ghetto. Needless to say, I am not feeling very good about going. On the bright side, even though Utica is a ghetto, it is an interesting ghetto.  I went to Utica for a photo project once and seriosuly, it was like I was surrounded by a Zoo of Mutants.   

I was wondering today, am I seriously the only woman in the world who despises Oprah Winfrey.  Pig Vomit, my roommate, watches Oprah and I fucking hate it!  I would rather choke on a ham sandwich like Momma Cass, than watch Oprah's show. It makes me sick how much money that woman is getting a year!  Shit, maybe I shouldnt hate her, maybe I should try and be her! Nah, pbbbbbbbbb.

I am such an ass. I really have a page left of a paper and I havent finished yet!  Maybe I should get to that now.
Well that is enough from me for now.  Lates!"

"event","Ok, so here is the deal. I have never been able to keep a journal. I think it is because I had a bad experience involving my diary when I was little.  I had this terrible babysitter, basically she was Satan with a fat ass and a bad hair cut.  Needless to say, when she was in my room she read my diary and it was all about how much I hated her.  After reading it she came up to me and said, ""Don't write things down that you don't want people to read.""  Being totally embarrased, and feeling very invaded I threw away my diary-THAT HAD A LOCK AND KEY!  I do believe it is time to start over, so here is my chance to bitch and complain and not get in trouble because I think everyone has a pretty good idea of what they are getting into, being that this is a LIVE journal an audience is welcome and expected.  So enjoy my bitching and complaining, for I will enjoy your responses."

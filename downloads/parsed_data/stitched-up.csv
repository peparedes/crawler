"event","Well, I just realized I haven't written here in a long ass time.  I guess I don't really have to because I have another journal now, two actually (starting April I'll only have one), but I want to write in it.. because I don't want to leave people who read it thinking I've died or something.  Even though I would like to :o\ Hmm.

My weekend was going to be alright until yesterday.  On Friday before work, I went to see E.T.  I loved it - that has to be the best movie in the entire world.  Or maybe I'm just holding onto a piece of my childhood I'll never be willing to let go, but if a movie has a power to do that to a person, especially me, it has to be special.  So yay for Steven Spielberg :o).  I planned on seeing that movie every day in the theaters, until I realised that I don't have enough money or time.  So I guess I'll just have to see it again in a few weeks.  ::sighs:: I guess it was never possible to see it 2,669 times in the theater anyway.  Caitie - how about you calculate how many day (year/days) it would have to be in the theater now?  Hah.

Saturday was alright, even though everything depressing and painful happened.  I hate people in this place.  Litterally, I live surrounded to a bunch of Ukranians and Russians.  It's kind of funny when you think about it.  Oh, and a cemetary, and a pond, and lots of trees!  It's very hilly too (I guess mountains are to blame for that), but so was where I lived before so I'm already used to it.  Uh, but not the Ukranians and Russians, it starts to frighten me, especially when these chicks start to call them hot.

Last night my dad was going crazy.  He actually told me that he was a religious, moral man.  Um, yeah, RIGHT... and I'm the queen of England.  ::rolls my eyes:: Anyway, he's kicking my step-mom out of the house <i>even though she came back to him</i>, so I guess they're going to officially get divorced now.  Or maybe my dad doesn't want to go through with that.  Probably does though, seeing as he wants to marry his girlfriend.  I swear to god that man needs to keep his penis in his pants >_< He should just give Liz a chance, she was actually pretty nice to me, except when she wanted to kill me.

Then I had to hang out with a bunch of religious freaks, and they almost made me miss the Oscars.  But I got really depressed and wanted to cut myself, so I decided to take some zoloft and lay down for a while.  The side effects of that thing are bad, but it does really well on making me feel mentally good, so I think I'm not going to tell anyone about how shitty it makes me physically.  I also want to sleep for like <i>hours</i> when I'm on that thing, but I have trouble sleeping.  I get exhausted, then I get in bed, toss and turn, fall asleep for 15-30 minutes and wake up.  It sucks.  

About the Oscars.. this was the first night that I can remember where I didn't watch them all, or atleast try to.  Even when I was a kid, and had school the next day, I'd sneak downstairs and watch them.  It's pretty easy to sneak around a drunken bastard anyway, but that was kool.  I didn't even get to see any major awards except best supporting actor or actress.  I know who won though, I asked someone at 1 am, and I'm sure they'll have to repeat the Oscars and I'll watch that.. I still feel really shitty about missing it though, that's my most favorite night of the year.

<lj-cut text=""My critique on who won the Oscars:"">
<b>Best Picture</b> - I'm glad <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> won, I would've placed money on it.  If it wasn't that, I would have wanted it to be Moulin Rouge, but I think <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> was more Oscar-worthy, just because of the type of film it is.  It also touched my heart in a more realistic way, for some reason.  Perhaps because I can identify with it extremely well.  Anyway, this was probably one, or my favorite, film released in 2001 (I guess it was actually January 2002).

<b>Best Actor</b> - I'm a little pissed off with this category, but oh well.  So Denzel Washington (and Halle Berry) got some Oscar history, but I think that's the point - it's ""black"" night - there's even Whoopi Goldberg hosting, and the special award.  I'm very positive Denzel Washington won for this reason, not that I'm racist or doubt his talent.. he's pretty damn amazing.  It's just that his performance in <i>Training Day</i> did not live up to many other actor's in this category.  I would have loved to see Russell Crowe or Sean Penn take it.  I know I'll seem like <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> fanatic, but if it was going to win ""Best Picture"", ""Best Director"", and ""Best Supporting Actress"", it's all BECAUSE of Russell Crowe and his heartbreaking performance.  Lately I've not been a fan of him and I wish he'd cut his damn hair short, but he did a fabulous job.  ::sighs:: but you know what, good job Denzel Washington.

<b>Best Actress</b> - A little pissed off here too, but this was a hard category.  Halle Berry did a great job in <i>Monster's Ball</i>, and she's pretty, so I'm happy for her.  I think that Sissy Spacek should have won, because she did a fabulous job in <i>In the Bedroom</i>.  But the movie was a little whack (while completely heart-touching).  Even Renee Zellweger.  Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge really deserves a ""major"" award, but I guess they didn't think so).  I couldn't even choose myself, so I'm satisfied that it ended up being Halle Berry.

<b>Best Supporting Actor</b> - I'll be honest - I wanted Ian McKellen to win this.  I'm a little sad that he didn't, but I don't think that Jim Broadbent winning was bad.  It was just very shocking.

<b>Best Supporting Actress</b> - Here I go sounding like an <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> fanatic again, but I'm so glad Jennifer Connelly won.  I think she's pretty, and her speech was so sweet.  It was also great to see how nervous she was.  I love that.  Anyway, I think this was the HARDEST category in the entire show, with Best Actress/Best Actor tied for second.  I would have liked to see either of the five girls take it (a little less so for Kate Winslet, but even her).  I would have been satisfied any which way.  I'm just SOOO glad for Jennifer.  Yay.

<b>Best Director</b> - While this category is not the hardest, I think it was still difficult.  I think Ron Howard got his Oscar mostly off of the work of Russell Crowe.  Which is why I think that Russell should have won Best Actor if Ron Howard was going to win Best Director.  I still applaud him for it, because he really adapted <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> well.  I have no preference in this category, I guess I would have liked to see Peter Jackson win for <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, but I'm hoping he'll get another chance for the two sequels.  I would have liked to see Robert Altman for <i>Gosford Park</i> too.  Since one of my three choices won, I'll just shut up and be satisfied.

<b>Best Writing (Directly Written for the Screen)</b> - Yes, I'm so happy that <i>Gosford Park</i> won.  If you haven't seen that film, go see it and this statement will be justified.  I don't see too much competition in the other nominees, but <i>Gosford Park</i> really, REALLY deserved this. 

<b>Best Writing (Based on Something Previously Produced/Published)</b> - Wow, another hard category.  I'd almost like to think that <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> shouldn't have gotten this category, since it won Best Picture, and I really think <i>Lord of the Rings</i> or <i>In The Bedroom</i> should have scored with this award, but I'm still happy.  I can totally understand why <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> won, and I'm not dissatisfied.

<b>Best Animated Feature</b> - There was no doubt in my mind that <i>Shrek</i> had to win - with the exception of <i>The Lion King</i> and a few other Disney films, I haven't seen a better animated film in YEARS.  Nice new category :o\ Make Oscar go longer without that Viagra, huh?

<b>Best Art Direction</b> - Yay for Catherine Martin and Brigitte Broch for <i>Moulin Rouge</i>.  Even though <i>LoTR</i> was amazing, and stupid as it is I would have liked to see <i>Harry Potter</i> win something, <i>Moulin Rouge</i> really deserved this award.

<b>Best Costume Design</b> - Yes, once again I had my money on <i>Moulin Rouge</i> (not techincally - but I would have if I were actualy betting).  Amazing work had to be done to bring this vision to life, and Catherine Martin and Angus Strathie did their job perfectly.  Congratulations on Catherine Martin getting two Oscars in one night, wow :oX I would die.

<b>Best Sound</b> - Okay so I'm semi-satisfied that <i>Black Hawk Down</i> won.  I don't really have a preference on this category, but I would have died if <i>Pearl Harbor</i> had one - damn, that movie seemed like it came out 10 years ago, why did it ever have to get nominated.

<b>Best Editing</b> - <i>Black Hawk Down</i> was a good choice here.  Again, a lot had to be done.  It was done, and it was done well.  This movie was touching, saddening, and it really brought to life the death of each individual soldier.  I was surprised that so few (I guess it's really not few, but to my mind it was) U.S. soldiers died, :o\ the movie really emphasized that sadness and misery, to the point that I thought more soldiers had died.  Shows that I have no sense of History, and that this film brought to life emotion well.

<b>Best Sound Editing</b> - well fine, <i>Pearl Harbor</i> was destined to win something.  They had a 50/50 chance here, and I don't think that <i>Monster's Inc</i> was gonna get it.  So fine, I'll just shut up about it.

<b>Best Visual Effects</b> - Yeah, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> deserved this, but I hate seeing four people on stage.  I would have had to anyway for all 3 movies -- but still.  Blah, this category, while I love it, still annoys the fuck out of me.  Crowded stages suck, or maybe I'm just insane.  If it weren't <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, I think <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> would have won - I loved that film, I feel badly it's not as well recognized as some other films, but last year was a hard year.

<b>Best Makeup</b> - <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, again, deserved this.  I could have seen it going to <i>Moulin Rouge</i>, but honestly, I think it had to be <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.  Despite my passion (and presumed ""obsession"" with) for <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, I'm so glad that it did not win  Best Makeup, that would have pissed me off a lot.

<b>Best Song</b> - Whatever, I have no feedback on this, but I like Enya so I'm sad she didn't win.  Good job Randy Newman for ""If I Didn't Have You"".  Sounds very cute :o\ maybe I'll download it.

<b>Best Original Score</b> - ::whimpers:: I like John Williams.  I would have liked to see him win for <i>AI</I> or <i>Harry Potter</i>, two films which deserved awards.  But you know what, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> can have this too.  It's pretty much deserved.

<b>Best Animated Short Film</b> - Didn't see it.  Don't care.  Good job <i>For The Birds</i>.

<b>Best Live Action Short Film</b> - Didn't see these either, but <i>The Accountant</i> sounds interesting, kool that it won.  If I had to base it off how kool something sounded, I'd go for <i>Meska sprawa</i> or <i>Speed for Thespians</i>, though.

<b>Best Documentary Feature</b> - I can't wait to see <i>Murder on a Sunday Morning</i> on HBO.  I love stories like this.  It seems they did a great job.  I'm glad it won, I can't be dissatisfied.

<b>Best Documentary Short Subject</b> - The kids looked cute in <i>Artists and Orphans</i>, I didn't see any of these though.  So I guess it's okay that <i>Thoth</i> won.

<b>Best Foreign Language Film</b> - I wanted <i>Amelie</i> to win damnit :'o( No.

Alright, I'm done.  That only took me an hour to do :o\"

Take the <A HREF=""http://www.badsheep.net/zingy/radiohead/radiohead.html"">Which Radiohead Album are you? Quiz.</CENTER><BR></a>

Although you may sound like a horrible affliction, you're actually one of the greatest albums of all time. EVERYONE loves you. You have an uncomplicated, charming, and youthful personality, but upon close investigation, there is much to your character. You know most everything, and you're likely to have done well on the SAT's. You perceive the world around you very well, and your thoughts have only been mildly corrupted by modern-day society. Still, there's a hidden side to you that you rarely reveal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

<b><i>My analysis of this analysis:</b></i>
Mildly corrupted?  Very mildly, if it all.
Done well on the SATs? Yes.
EVERYONE loves me? Not at all.  It's the opposite.
Perceive the world around me well? Yes.
Hidden side? Definitely.. I'm all hidden.
Much to my character? Yes.
Uncomplicated? Hell no.
Charming? Hell no.
Youthful? Perhaps, at times."

So that's a little under 4 hours of sleep, and I have to go trek around all day in snowy weather.  Besides the fact snow is tiring (even though it's super pretty in the air), I am already fucking exhausted!  See my problem?  Uunnnggghhh.. I'm rather depressed, I need to smile.  A smile would feel so nice right now.

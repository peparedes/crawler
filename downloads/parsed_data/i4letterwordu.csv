You waited.

I didn't mean to wait to hang up the phone but I couldnt reach the reciever.

You waited.

I know.

You make me laugh and cry in the same conversation.

I think I might plan to come home."

"event","been a while scince I updated this. mostly because I forgot about the ""forgot your password?"" button. ironic eh?

you probably forgot this journal existed. 

Your readin this now because were back together.

and I had to prove to you I still thought about you all the time even tho you probably already know that. You always know. But still you would also know that i still HAVE to prove things to you, mostly just to prove it to myself tho.

I don't plan on showing you this if we never do tho. hehe it all depends on if you meet your ""football guy"". which I don't think you will. I know you won't really. See I still believe that someday we WILL get back together. It's cloudy. i cant say when or how or anything. where would be a nice added edition scicne im, you know..IN WASHINGTON. But life has that lovely effect of letting you smell the pie from the oven and never letting you taste it. Thats why life is so good when you eventually take the first bite.

well It's been a few months scince I moved. I think about 5. I always tell people I moved to ""check out the west coast"". Lol and they always believe me. Silly westerners.

It's nice out here tho melissa. Beautiful beaches and so much sunlight. It's so amazing here.

you know my one and only problem?

No one else is here to share that with.

I do have friends here, a few. but. It's not the same, not yet anyway. 

I am confused. I know eventually, at least i think, that we WILL be together again. But i can't wait. I HATE waiting. I KNOW you know it too. you really want me to come back to michigan. god i miss you. i dont even have to type that. It feels so good not HAVING to tell u anything but doing it anyway just to do it. your so amazing melissa. you have always been the most amazing person I will ever know. You are like that angel that you know will always be pure. you are always pure to me. you are always beautiful to me. you know my FAVORITE time to see you is? when you just wake up. I tell people now the best tiem to see someone is whne they first open there eyes. Because every time you did I always tried to watch your face. The beauty that radiates from that first smile of the day will always give me joy. You are the one. I can't say it to you right now. But I think you know it. i know you know it.

I messed up bigtime with you. I know I was an idiot. I was being so young. I Am still young but I have learned from my mistakes.

I wish I could go back home right now and just ask you out to a cup of coffe. I know it has to start again like that and we just cant jump in. I want to fall in love with you all over again. I want to. But I don't know if I should. You told me...I told me that I can't just go home. I dont even have a home ot go to. i know I could stay with my mom but I CANT melissa. I cant oh god i cant just stay with my mom. I cant even talk to her on the phone straight. I need to get my stuff together financially. I am sure I KNOW. I am SO sure right now that I have ot come back to you. 

I really hope.

you know how i hated that word?

hope.

Well that's what I've been living off of. Hope.

Not conciously but subconciously all I've been doing is for you or somehow for me to get back to you.

I live for love.

you are my love.

I live for you.

I know now you can't obsess about that or it breaks. 
It's like holding a puppy too tight because you love it so much that you kill it.

thats what happened to us.

I know now that something liek that was imminent from when we started.

i still am glad what happened happened. I learned so much.

I really hope. oh I hope I can show you this entry one day. I really want to. I love you so much.


I always have


It's not going away.

And I'm glad it isn't.


Your love,
Steve"

"event","You say that I treat you like a book on a shelf. I don't take you out that often
because I now that I completed you and that is why you are here.
That is the reason why you stay here. How awful that must feel.
You said you would be my dream. I could have you every night and if, by morning,
I had forgotten you, well, no big deal, it would be all right because
you are the reoccurring kind. You are the reoccurring kind. You never leave my mind.
Are you the love of my lifetime? Because there have been times I have had my doubts.
We were just kids when I first kissed you in the attic of my parents house,
and I wish we were there now. It took so long to figure out what this book has been about.
Now I write when I'm away letters that you never read. You said go to explore those other women,
the geography of their bodies but there is just one map you'll need. You are a boomerang.
You see. You will return to me.
<b>You will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will.
You? Will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will.</b>
Because if you don't, then this book is all lies. If you don't, then my plans would all be ruined.
If you don't, I'll start drinking like the way I drank before.
And I just wont have a future anymore."

An angel carved so exquisit as yourself should be held in the hands of only a god.
You are the one thing I cherish in this world we live in.
May we be this happy on our 22 month anniversery.

To my love, Melissa."

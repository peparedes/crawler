I've been at grandpa's for... 15 days now... im still a little stressed by it all, but over all this has been good for me, it is quieter, it is calmer.  And I don't feel so unwelcome, like my mother was sure to constantly make me feel.  Grandpa doesn't try to fuck me around and have power over me, or control me through fear of a place to live.

It is a bit annoying being so close to bob and ryan... both provide drama i dont care for.... but Ryan is not so bad as he used to be.

I am stressed about visitng still.... not so much as before i talked to you about it the first time.  But still kinda scared.....  New enviroment... people i either havent met, or seen in years.....  But I am keeping it under control....

I .... was kind of grouchy today... fucking sinus infection has me upset... last one lasted like 4 monthes... and im worried thats gonna happen again... it feels like it may have moved into my ear as well... and I didn't sleep for shit... I hate nightmares... I dont remember it... but... i know from how i felt when i woke up, and how i woke up, that it was most likely one of the dreams where... something happened to someone I care about... death, injury, illness, something along those lines.  Always upset me pretty good, but... it could have been worse though, so I am thankful for that..... But it did keep me up a few hours....

The dream i had the night prior was good though... Really havent remembered too many lately, but I am glad I did that one... just a sweet touching, and holding and kissing type dream.  Made me happy...  Need to work on getting my mind to have those kind more often =D

I am passing out now.  whee!"

"event","Well.... i got to sleep almost as soon as we got off the phone... woke up halfway a few times due to... frustration, and the actions i was unwilingly taking to relieve it.... But slept pretty soundly for about an hour and 15 minutes til my phone rang with the wrong number....

So it woke my ass up.... Which turns out to have been a good thing as I was sleeping on my right side and my shoulder was cramping up because of it, so I got up and had Jake step on it, and it managed to pop back in, so hopefully no more arm going numb (we will see by tomorrow I am sure)....

But thats just the little BS explaining why I am up at 12:30 posting this....

Anyways.... A good week mostly... odd moods, but a good week.... Lot's of thinking, but not bad thinking... just thinking about ... everything really... about going out there.. someday... hopefully sooner then later.... and how ... scared of that I am in some ways... I mean... It is what I want... more then anything at the moment, but I am quite frightened, I haven't seen you or James or the kids in years.... I've never met Doug, and god knows who else will be around... so... I am scared.  But I think I will do ok with it when the time comes.....

Hmmm what else..... Stuff I don't want to talk about here... You should ask me about it on the phone sometime....

So anyways, since that stupid movie got me all emotional, I'm now going to put in Butterfly Effect, which will have an equally emotional effect on me, and try to sleep to it out of sheer stupidity.  Go me!

Ok, rolling over to go back to sleep now, talk to you soon."

"event","Alright, i seem to do best when I ramble.... so lets get into a rambling type mode here.... 

It's been a few days since ive came on here so lets back up a few days I guess..... Although then i might not make it to today, because I am tired....  but bleh....

Well I just read my last entry, i really was half asleep...

So anyways... The last few days have been strange... I've been slowly opening myself up to you awhile now, but the last few days has .... been a lot more, it felt so good to tell you (as best I could) how much I loved you, and even better, to tell you that I never really did stop.  I am still scared.  Of lot's.  I am scared you will... get bored with me, or change your mind, or any other number of things that.... I know better....  The other one I am scared of is ... all me... I am scared that... someday when I make it out there, that I will be jealous... I dont think I will be... I am pretty sure I wont, but... it's a fear.

Despite all that nonsense though, i am doing better, I am opening up to you more, and I am very happy about that, and I am happy to be talking to you so much.

I... also got in trouble... as you well know... well... twice... I deserved both... I defied you, and... I was a shit...  It's strange... in a few ways, how i feel about it all.... I feel bad for disobeying you, and for disappointing you... I am frightened of the punishments... the painful one, obviously more then the other....... Somewhat... excited at the same time...   But either way.... I know I deserve it.

I don't know, the submissive thing still kind of trips me out sometimes.... I mean ... You know how much I enjoy you calling me pet... its... literally a shiver... it is a whimper...  its a warm feeling in my chest, a full feeling.... I cant explain it completely, just settle for... it's a very good feeling...  I like belonging to you, I like being reminded of it... I like the things you hint at doing with... or.... to me.... even if they are not things I would consent to with anyone else.... And I also like that... i feel safe about anything like that with you, that I trust you to ... not take things further then I can handle...

And as sad as it is... i sat here blushing for the whole 40 minutes i spent writing that last paragraph....

I won't say that... hmmm.... I wont say that I love you more then i did say... 2 monthes ago, but... im allowing myself to feel, and show it more, which, in some ways sucks.... it makes me miss you more, it makes missing you hurt more....  You asked.... erm.. one of these recent nights what the first thing i wanted to do was?  Hold you.... and kiss you... and hug you... for hours.

Anyways, just a bit more.... I've loved the last few days, I love how much I've gotten to talk to you, and how much I get to tell you that I love you.... But I have been typing at this for ... almost 3 hours now...  Some of it was very hard to put to words, and ... even in this I am shy somehow... so... as its 2 now, im rolling over and going to sleep... Can't wait to hear from you.... Tangent..... I love waking up to a phone call from you.... LIke i said, makes me smile to talk to you, and waking up with a smile is always a good thing.  Untangent.... now... I am going to roll over and hopefully have wonderful dreams of you...."

Me and keith played the who can get more debt game, i won of course, so then we ended up playing the ""get the fuck out of debt"" game. and then i leveled, yay me.  

Well thats why im up late... 

it took a lot not to try sleeping on the couch tonight.  Im still like... Uhh for lack of a better word, antsy .... when we went to lucnh there were 4 other people eatting, plus the employees there, so like us 4 + 6 people... and I was *extremely* uncomfortable... so I think Im still just a little panicked from the whole movie thing.... Not a good thing, a step backwards even....  Bleh sometimes it would be nice to be normal... 

Hair falling out sucks.  Uhhh....  Oh ... Clouds decided to blow in this evening here....  So on top of being blistering fucking hot, and disgustingly fucking bad air quality, its painfully fucking humid... I feel like i need some fucking gills.

"event","Stumbling through words on this one... 

I've been laying here in bed for almost 2 hours now just thinking, and feeling bad.  I had considered not telling you I had missed the appointment, but... I decided that would be dishnoest, and would most likely come to bite me in the butt as well, that is why I waited til so late in the evening to tell you.

It made me very upset when you told me I had disappointed you.  I can't exactly describe it.... but, I was (and am) angry with myself for having done it, and .. sad.. because you were.  That's what I've been thinking about.  I think that had a stronger effect then anything else you could have said... I know for certain my  expression changed almost immediately, heck... I almost cried for a second for having done it.  I just wanted to hug you and appoligize until you told me to shut up, or forgave me.  But enough on that....

Other stuff... I survived the day... For some reason it was a rough one on me to begin with.. Just very touchy about getting upset/pissed.  The movie was good, it was good to get out, but.... being touched sucked, and.... freaking out and practically running screaming out of the theatre at the end was... slightly embarassing... I really need to not go to large blockbuster sold out movies in the first few weeks.

I am very tired now, so I am going ot roll over and resume my thinking until i fall asleep."

Mike really pissed me off today... It also upset me quite a bit, although I definately was trying to deny that (even to myself)... I am just so incredibly sick and tired of that bullshit, i understand that sometimes friends and what not will call you when they need something, Bob and Alisa do it to me all the time, but they also call all the time just to annoy me... err I mean, to say hi, go hang out, whatever.  Anyways, happier topic...

Tomorrow, Social Security office, just picking up a stupid piece of paper, so I can go to another appointment the next day... and then the dr on tuesday, gonna be a busy few days..... Kinda nervous about the dr visit, with my lungs behaving so badly, im scared, but rationally i know its not the VF, as, to my knowledge, i have not been having any fevers, or night sweats, or abnormal aches and pains.  Thursday I will call the pharmacy and get the refill on my fluconazole.... Whee...

Odd that I wouldn't notice it i know, but I was having a hard time breathing, and my shoulder was hurting very bad, and it was just upsetting me.  Nothing major, I avoided using my inhaler so I could sleep tonight.

Hmm, I need to go to the social security office in the next day or two..... and on the 1st i have an appointment for my insurance shit.... and the 6th i see my dr again...

I am very much Ugh at the moment though... I am tired and... Bakersfield sucks...my throat hurts like hell (not sick) from this piss poor fucking air, had to use my inhaler like 3 times today...   No, I did not go outside, beyond walking to Stu's truck, from the truck to the gas station, back to the truck, truck to keiths, keiths to truck, truck to my front door...  just... ugh.

And I am angry at myself for breaking my digital thermometer .... with my foot... it was on my floor, and i accidently stepped on it and cracked the lcd....  My own fault for leaving it on the floor when it fell the other day, I will have to clean my room tomorrow if I feel a bit better.. 

Well, we accomplished like NO roleplaying, turned into a bullshit and magic the gathering session, sooo..... bleh....

"event","Today, was a really great day, except that I missed the hell out of you, and a few minor annoyances.  After you went to bed, a few more minor annoyances popped up, that I am sure you will get quite a good laugh out of....

I was standing near the front door.... when i felt something run across my foot......  A spider, about the size of a quarter.... I screamed, and then beat it to a pulp with my sister's shoe that happened to be sitting near by.... Gotta love a grown man screaming about a spider at 2 in the morning.....

Then, I almost became a vegitarian....  See, i like meat, I love it in fact, but when I pick up a slice of... whatever the hell cut off beef it is we had for dinner tonight, and go to take a bite, and notice a small piece of fat on it... Well... of course I'll remove the fat, that's just gross...  But when tugging on the fat, i suddenly see 2 veins running through it?  Well, at least I wasn't hungry any more.  Thinking about that stuff makes me ill.  Such a weak stomach.

Other then that..... Just trying to get to sleep, have been for almost an hour now, but have been thinking a lot about today, and how much I miss you, and how much I really do love you.  I don't know if I express it enough to you , I know that I don't feel I do it very well in my words, but I am not sure if my actions show it.

I am still smiling about the things you said yesterday... thinking about them as I go to sleep... Yes, I know, I am sappy... It really did make me feel special and loved though...

Then someone (gee wonder who) went and made me feel special and loved.  I felt kind of bad at the time, because I don't like people worrying about me... well.. I do.. but.. yah, you know what i mean. And I feel kind of bad now because a lot of what was said just kind of ... stunned me to near silence, and I really didn't know how to respond.  Something i most definately need to work on.

The rest of my day was pretty mundane, ate my kick ass bbq hamburger dinner, beat  my video game, and read some stuff on the internet.  Now it is time to turn on some background noise, think happy thoughts, and go to sleep."

"event","Well, it is much later then i would like to be up... but... the first 30minutes of darvocet didn't dull the pain enough for me to actually make it to sleep, so it finally kicked in full force and i got amped as fuck...   Today, was a hard day.... My lungs in the morning... did manage to distract me from my shoulder, so when i finally used my inhaler, then my shoulder started in.  I hope I just tweaked it a bit, and it's not a sign of things to come.....

I've put some more thought into why I am mind fucked at the moment though.... It is just a combination of things I think.... starting from one and spiraling down into more and more.  The main things, at the top of the list that I can think of.....  I am scared about my health as always, i try to play it off most the time, and fail miserably... but like, my breathing scares me, what if that shit is growing in my lungs again?  (Yah... lets put these ideas in your head so you can get mad at me for still not calling the dr.)  I will get in soon though.  I kind of tend to procrastinate when I am scared.  Fortunatly I have lots of people to chew my ass out when I do that....

Another one of the major ones is.... In 5 days now I turn 24..... Yah, i don't like that i am going to be ... ""Mid 20's"" but thats not a big deal, I am over thar.  But 24 is also the age I have been waiting for.... at 24 I no longer need my mother or fathers taxes to get financial aid for college (getting those taxes had proved to be near impossible)..... I am scared I will be turned down, that I wont be able to get into college (this one is almost for sure, admission closed indefinately at CSUB because of the budget).. I dont want to fuck off with community college, it is further away, i have no transportation.... so, I guess I can try online classes...  But even aside from those 2 things being turned down and denied from me.... I have back up plans.... All else fails, I go with student loans, and go into teaching, that waives most of the loan, so ..... yah, instead of paying 100%, i pay 10%... but... I am the real issue is, I am scared of failing.  My mind is not what it was a few years ago (prior to getting sick).. What if it is worse then I thought?  What if I can't handle it?  I already know that I am less then i was before, and it bothers me.... And I am being silly, I'll do fine.  I am going to sleep now, im talking in drugged up circles."

"event","So I went out tonight, met 2 new people, and managed to not freak out, I did very good in fact, I even spoke aloud.  Not very much, but some.  I had fun..... I slept most of the way home (about an hour and 15 minutes i napped... and i have the stiff neck to prove it...) Apparently i ended up using alisa as a pillow.....

I didn't do any shooting, we had some equipment problems, as Larry forgot to bring his extra cable releases, and the one he did bring busted, so we only had alisa's.... so, only one camera (out of the 11 we had there) was being used at a time..... But, I had a blast....

I've been home about half an hour now.... Laying in bed.... and for some reason... something is bothering me bad..  I don't know what it is... Or even if it is just one thing.  I am sad.  I am extremely sad...... 

Part of it I know is that I am lonely.... I am up to like 15 monthes without sex..... 15 monthes without a kiss....  15 monthes without holding someone... or having someone hold me.  

I am doubting myself, feeling insignifigant, doubting my worth.  In.... 7.... well 6 technically days... I turn 24.... And I do not have a fucking thing to show for it... I live it home, I have no income, I have no education beyond a ged....  I am not saying I am stupid.... But, I sure as fuck am well on my way to nowhere....   I still have not heard from social security, I am wondering if my paper work got filed under ""get fucked"".... I suppose I will just send it off again...... Such a goal to aspire to though... ""I sure hope the government will pay me to sit at home since I am to fucked to do anything else""...

Ok that's just whiney.... I am rambling to figure out what is bugging me, not to mope and bring myself further down... I don't like doubting myself, or being scared...  But I sure seem to do it often.... I am scared of being a failure... I am scared that when I am a week from turning 30, I will be no further along in my life then i am today.  I am scared that even when I do finish college.. and get to where i can... take my life somewhere.... I still won't be able to do that.  Silly fears, but at 18... did I expect to be living back home 6 years later, with no progress (in fact, only back tracking) made?  I don't like being scared of meeting new people.. or... of being touched by people I don't know.  I don't like having to be surrounded by friends at a movie....just so I can be somewhat comfortable enough to watch.  So many little quirks I have that just bug the shit out of me......

I think most of all... I hate doubting loved ones.... My phone rings, and the first thought is, who the fuck is this and what do they want?  Sadly, most the time I am right, a very few exceptions.... Whether it is ""do this for me"" or ""reassure me about my life"" or even ""by talking to you and remembering how fucked you have it, my life doesn't seem quite so shitty"".... Am i a bad friend for saying this?  Bob never asks me for anything more then ""Dude, if you get a chance, look into this for me..."" most the time it is ""Come over sometime, have dinner, let's hang out""...

Then there would be you....  You do not give me reason to doubt you, but, sometimes I still do, and that makes me very angry with myself.  I know it is nothing you have done, it is just... I get to doubting myself... then just kind of ask ""Why?""  Then of course, trust issues come into play... and the why is answered... ""Because it is not true""... and I know better, but... what is life without some insecurities i suppose....

I lied somewhat the other day... when i said I loved you very much, and that it was just all the bullshit made me realize it more and what not.... Nonsense.... I know quite well how I feel in regards to you, nothing makes me realize it or makes it clearer to me, but saying ""I love you"" is safe.  it opens you up to be vulnerable, but not... very vulnerable... to completely express ones feelings, or even to express more then a simple ""I love you"" Is taking a chance, it is opening yourself up, and that's scary.  I did better then I normally do, I managed a ""very much"" but, that doesn't fully express it... and I think you know that.  A comment was made about someone being jealous about how willing to submit I was....  I don't know that willing is the proper word.... I love and trust you completely, despite silly doubts and fears I may have.  There is no willingness or unwillingness involved... While I do not completely understand it always, I am yours as long as you will have me.

I think there is more i wanted to ramble out.... but the last bit there was particularly tough to put to words, and took me nearly a half hour alone.... I've been rambling off at this for almost an hour now, so I think it is time that I go to sleep."

So about 3, I woke up..... And felt like hell, I have some sort of a stomach bug I think... but anyways, woke up for like an hour, had some toast, went back to bed for a couple hours... then Bob wanted me to come over... Which made me realize that I am not doing to good with the whole social thing currently, I am slipping back for some reason again, but i went over, and was social, and even put up with some annoying friend of Bob's wife.....  I think ""whore"" is the word i'd use for her.... 

But I had fun... it was good to not sit at home...

I also realized, that I have an appointment on Monday.  And that my insurance crap expired .... so I can't go.... which I am sure will get me in trouble.... so Monday i need to call and set an appointment for my insurance stuff...

Until I realized I was out of salad dressing, a few minutes later, looking for a can of tuna fish, and I find...... Salad dressing in the cupboard! yay!.... bleh... im so pathetic to find enjoyment out of that.......

So.... My health.... aside from not being able to breathe, im doin great.... And aside from my annoyance with people, im doing good there..... Im still kind of withdrawing into myself at the moment, I need to figure out why that is.

Ill avoid any obvious rants, and simply gloat that I finished some code.... debugged 2 seperate problems I was having with crashes, and layed forth my plans to take over France, and eventually Canada.  *nods sagely*....   Now to get some sleep, maybe I can make it to bed before 10 today!"

Then woke up and realized i couldnt fucking breathe for shit.... so after several hours, around midnight i finally broke down and used my inhaler.... So here i am awake at 4:30, Planned on crashing by 3.... oh well.... had to hit the inhaler, finally couldnt take the shallow breaths any more

Other then that, i am good.... GOod mood and everything.

Asthma attack..... jarred my shoulder around to much... etc... so i had to hit the inhaler a few times, and take a steamy shower (loosen up the lungs, and relax the shoulder).....

So, I finally got to sleep around 5:30...... much later then i had wanted to....  Then Joaquin woke me up a few minutes ago, which I dont mind, he just got home from the surgery tuesday, and I would rather him ask for help, then try to do shit on his own...  and hurt hismelf...

Joaquin is a good guy.. we have our problems.... but over all, he is a good guy, and treats jake and danielle right... Strong ethics, ... Well.... A look i know quite well, the tight jaw, squinted eyes, and the arms in tight to the sides.... the ""Im in fucking pain"" look....  Yah he has that going good right now, and it makes me sad.... .seeing other people in pain always makes me want to cry..... I know I can handle pain, but you can never be quite sure how someone else will handle it.... Poor guy,... I hope he feels better soon.

"event","Well I had actually planned to go to bed about 2 and a half hours ago, when my mother left to drive down south to pick up Joaquin.  Joaquin had back surgery on Tuesday and was stuck in the hospital....  I needed to stay up until she left to get some money off her to put gas in the car (the one she isnt taking) and to go get a hair cut.  It got to that annoying ""I am fucking white trash"" state..... 

Well since Joaquin is recovering, and will be off work for some time, we are anticipating company.  So obviously, the house needs straighened up some, specifically, the computer room..  For 2 weeks, i have been telling my mother to run the AC and I would clean it up, but she would not do so.  Well, when it is 83 degrees in there, i just really lack the energy to mvoe and pick up a room.  It had gotten pretty bad also, between being sick, and then the heat... Bleh.....

So finally a few days ago it cooled off... but unfortunatly, my back has been screwed up, shoulder extremely bad...... Like pain killers every night, the real ones, not pussy ass codeine shit.    So it was finally cool, but I was fucking sore.....

But, he is coming home today, so its time to clean up, so even though I hurt like hell, even though I can't even raise my right arm now because of it, I cleaned that room for about 3 hours.  It isnt perfect, I need to put some more work in... I need to move around furniture and pick up some monitors and what not..   All stuff I just could NOT do then.... 

But I did put in a few hours of work...... I told her when she got up, that I did some of it, and that I was going to sleep and then finish it off... and she started screaming at me, telling me it looks like shit, saying I did nothing, and telling me she hopes Joaquin kicks me out.....

I hate this fucking bitch.... I can not fucking stand her... I am sick of her bullshit.... I am sick of her stupid fucking psychotic games.... Of course for some reason, the whole situation brought back tons of old memories, about all the shit she has pulled, which of course, has put me in a very down mood.   Which gets me to thinking about other shit, and gets me even more down, and even more unsure of myself.  I do hae to say though, it is kind of amusing when you are so unsure of yourself, that even you know you are being ridiculas, but, it doesnt change the fact that you are.  Oh well.... I suppose I will get over it.

I am pissed though, I was in a good mood, I accomplished a lot.... I got some coding done that I had been working on, I managed to pick some thigns out of some disassembly i had been meaning to look at, and I got over 75% of the shit done cleaning up that room..... 

And another minor little rant, brought on by the cunt......

""We don't have to let you live here... We didn't plan on you living here when we bought this place""

FUCK YOU!  Do you think my life goal was to be 24 days form my 24th Birthday, unemployed, uneducated, permenantly medicated, and living with my fucking mother?!  FUCK YOU!!  Guess what bitch, shit fucking happens, I hate your fucking guts, do you really think I would be living here if it was within my control?


Ok, thats enough of a rant, im drugging myself and going to sleep.. If I'm still pissed tomorrow, I am really letting the rant fly."

"event","Sorry for not doing this the last two days, I got in late friday, and by the time I was heading for bed Saturday, i was pissed off enough that it would have been nothing more then some severe bitching..... Woke up saturday, to a dead 17"" monitor....

5 am.... heading to bed..... walk into my room ,and notice my server shut it self off... try to turn it on... doesnt work, after 10 mins or so of trouble shooting, the power supply had died....I was exhausted, but had to do a 1 hour case swap...... soooooo ... All this, and I was still in a good mood, Wasnt gonna let that garbage get me down.....

Then, as i hooked up the server again.... my cable modem came crashing down on my head......

That was the final straw, i went to bed quite pissed.... And with a headache.


But anyways, thats just my excuse .... today... was good, slept in til like 2 .... played some video games.... Then went over to bobs for a few hours... Then came home, and played some more video games.... whee.... My health.... is... Im alive... not sick... but... sore, very sore... so sore that im using a heating pad right now, even though im bloody hot.  Oh well, could be worse....

Mental health?  GOod i think, i seem upbeat and in good spirits.... mostly....

Accomplishments?  I didn't throw my cable modem when it landed on me..... I made myself go to Bob's (it took some forcing).....  And...... I managed not to drive off the road!  That of course makes it sound like I DO sometimes drive off the road... but not the case..... forgot to take my glasses tonight, which is bad.... at night.. I dont need em so much during the day, but at night... my eyes dont focus together, so like... instead of seeing 2 headlights... i see 2 headlights with a double image on each.. so it totally and completely blinds me and I cant see the road.... Quite fun really.... Not to mention the severe splitting headache that the much bright light causes me... (You would htink as either way your eyes see the same thing, just whether they focus or not, that it would be no brighter..... and it isnt exactly ""brighter"" but damn it sure hurts a lot more)

Anyways, im starting to ramble. and im far to tired to do that... ....

I think i need to work on my bed time again soon.... whee!"

"event","This should actually be kind of fun, I dont know which direction my mind is going to take this for a change....  Time to ramble aimlessly!

So today was a nice fun day! i woke up at 1 on the dot!  And I managed to go a few hours before people started annoying the shit out of me.... I've started using aim 5.5 so I can hide while I am online, as every fucking idiot i know constantly bugs the holy hell out of me.  And for a change, my phone did not ring every 40 seconds because some idiot wanted to shoot the shit.  I am kind of sick of that shit actually... Yah, sometimes I like to just bullshit..... With some people, I could bullshit for hours... Mike? Not one of those people... See.... There are some people... who talking to em.. just kinda makes you happy... makes you feel alive, or whatever other cliche bullshit I am missing here.... but sadly its all true... Mike? Not one of em.  Alisa? Maybe once.... But as you are no doubt happy to know... No...

Mike probably wouldnt bug me so much except that... if I dont answer my cell he calls my land line (mistake #1... I do not use the land line, I dont answer it, i dont look for the cordless, I dont like it, I dont use it, can i say again that i dont use it? no callinhg the bloody land line... forgot the damned number, i dont use it.).... And a pause while i get my glasses......... *cue shitty music*

Did we enjoy our intermission? Where was I?!  Ok, I don'tuse it!  If I dont anwer my cell phone... I am .... asleep.... busy.... avoiding you, or I did not hear it... I dont use the land line!  I do not know where the bitch put the cordless, I dont want to find it, I dont use it!  (Ok, im sure we all get the idea)..... So, when it rings 4 times, and the answering machine picks up... ""Travis, are you there? Pick up the phone""... is not an appropriate message....... it is even less apropriate when my cell phone rings again!

Ok, so now we have established that I am an antisocial prick who is undeserving of friends =D.... 

So several hours of my day pass... then the phone starts in... easily solved.. toss the cell behind the couch, close the kitchen door (no ringer sounds from land line) and crank the stereo... My peaceful thursday (and most people like weekends! pfft!) continues.....

I get a good (crap) dinner.... Jack in the Box... tastes great, but I really need to eat healthier, to much fast food.  Play some EQ, then get an IM..... about NWN..... great game... never got into it multiplayer like though...  Track down a no cd crack, then get told i have to find my cds or be in trouble.... now... for a couple seconds this made me mad.... I mean... I didn't lose the fuckers, how can I be held responsible if I cant find em?  But only for a moment, then my eyes drifted over the words again, I saw a certain word that sends a chill down my spine, and I remembered how loved I am, and I did as I was told........

Which of course led to me fighting with the PC (quick escape the sappiness)..... And then finally Jake remembering he already had it installed on his PC... (damn putz)..... Then CD key problems, a solutions.... some more EQ.....

And then a phone call, which requires a small back track in time.....


So yesterday, i get an IM from Kayla.... an ex-gf.... who for a time I could not stand the presence of (did the druggie/alchy bit,after my tolerance for such behavior was gone)..... We broke it off in a ... less then pleasant manner..... and didnt talk for a long time... Even when I was around her on a few occassions.... (Her 2nd child's funeral because of SIDS......  When her and Craig came back to town.....)...... We didn't talk... more then ""Hello"".... so her messaging me... .was a shock, and honestly kind of worried me.... the last message I got, was to ask me to come to that funeral....   But yesterday, we ended up chatting for quite awhile, a good half hour.... she got sick of Criag being useless and not getting a job, so kicked him out of her life.... and is improving hers... she is still a worthless alchy.... (i am so judgemental)..... but has stopped with the drugs..... and is moving towards improving her life again, so I can tolerate her presence.  (Arrogant too).....  But back today... so my phone rings, with Ricardo's number, I answer it, and it is kayla.. so long story that is really short but i made it long....... Kayla and Ricardo come by.... she didnt talk much, mainly me and ricardo chatted... but .... we tossed some joking around back and forth.... It was good to see her, and to see she is improving herself.  Always makes me happy.  Plus, I don't have to dislike her for being completely worthless now.

So they took off, did some more of the EQ thing... then typed away at this thing for god knows how fucking long.....

I still didnt clean my living room.... to damned hot.... So I guess I did not accomplish anything of any value... I dunno... maybe rebuilding social ties...... I mean its not like i'd ever date her again... but It's good to see someone who should be a friend, redeem themselves.  (Way to judgemental)...... 

Tomorrow should be great also.... the bitch is going with Danielle on a field trip, so most of the early day should be rather peaceful.... The 2nd half might suck though... but... I do always have the stereo to protect me from any bitching.....

Well I have rambled long enough, and aside from the telephone rant (I dont use it!!!!)..... most of it was pretty up beat...   Thats good, means im more happy then not happy I think.... And obviously, quite tired.....

Whee!"

"event","Well, I am exhausted right now, as usual but, I am not in a horrible mood, so I can finally put up what i wanted to.

The other day you said something very sweet to me, and I didnt know how to respond at the time.  ""Me too"" is not an appropriate answer to things like that.  But, you know I have a difficult time expressing myself as far as things like that are concerned, but i wanted to say something more about it also, Unfortunatly between bad moods and what not, I knew i would just end up ranting about people I hate, and are thus, unworthy of my tiem or energy.

I miss you as well, I miss you very much, I try very hard not to think about it most times because it is easier that way, but that does not change the fact that I do fall asleep with my arms around a pillow, and thinking about you.  it really does seem to help with the nightmares.....

Anyways, my health is good.... lips are cracked and bloody as are my elbows and knees, i love this medication.. but im using vaseline for the lip;s, and I got some better lotion for the skin... seems to be helping...

Mental health, is alright i suppose... I am not happy at the moment... Hard week with the bitch.. lots of problems with jake... And I am very unhappy with myself... Prior to my sinus infection i became unhappy with my body, I was gainign weight, and getting.... larger then i would like to be....  Then I got sick and lacked the energy to continue the working out I had started.  Well.. now I have been healthy again a few weeks, and I haven't resumed what I had been doing, and am growing more and more disgusted with myself.  On the bright side, I may be disgusted enough to start working out again (not tonight though.. the couple hours at walmart exhausted me to much for any hopes of that tonight.)

Accomplishments?  I shaved... I finally posted this... I think expressing myself should count as an accomplishment, it certianly takes enough work, and I managed not to scream and cuss anyone out today.  (Although I did flash the finger to a few people on the road on the way back from walmart.)

Ok, time to crawl into bed.  I need to fix that again as well."

"event","So I went and saw a movie tonight, that was rather entertaining, but probably would have been more so had the theatre been empty, rather then the bloody idiots that always frequent them.  but, it was fun.

My health is such tricky business... one of my scars starts acting up, and I hav e to spend 3 days worrying and wondering if its just zits, or if it is the valley fever acting up , or what.  And then when I decide on the first, I have to second guess myself for the next week of course.  I hate these damned scars.  A scar should hav e a story.  A good story.... ""Oh.. this is when I fell down a small cliff paintballing"" or some such nonsense not ""Yah, these 5 disgusting large scars were from I got extremely fucking sick.""  And I do mean disgusting..... At least the 6th and 7th are places that never ever ever get seen. (bottom of my foot and above my upper lip, thanks facial hair).  Am I embarassed of them? No, only of the one on my face.  But I am so sick of looking at them.  But I think I am bitching now.  Beyond the minor scare of the last few days, and the tiredness from the heat, I am doing well....

The mental state on the other hand, well.... as we can see by the bitchfest, I must be needing to get that off my chest.  I am not any more fucked up then on a normal day.  Perhaps a little more hateful towards the world then usual.  Lonely as always.  This is not something I can really bitch about however.  I am not willing ot put out the effort of going out into the world and looking for ... company... Primarily because I don't want the hassles that come with it.

Accomplishments?  I didn't kill my mother, my sister, my aunt, my cousin, or my brother today.  That is most definately an accomplishment.  I've gotten even better at coding and disassembly, I am so proud of myself, even though this is a skill I will never use beyond having fun, as I adamantly refuse to work in the computer industry.  I meant to clean the living room today as well, but it got so hot I didnt want to do much more then just kind of.... sit.

Ok, I guess there is room for some more bitching..... I am having such a hard time dealing with Jake anymore... He is an angst ridden hard headed teenager.... (Oh my god, he is m y brother....)... He doesn't listen to me, he doesn't listen to his mother, he smarts off constantly, he doesn't do his school work, and he doesn't know when to shut the fuck up.  Can I blame him for just doing what he wants?  He is going to get screamed and yelled at whether he does what he is supposed to or not... why excert the effort?  It's just frustrating.  I am not placed in this situation by a decision I made, or a negligant action on my part.  I did not go into a relationship with a child involved and become a full time parent.  I did not neglect to use birth control and have a child.  And yet, I am having as many, if not more, problems then my friends who have done those things.  I am bitter about it.  If I made those choices, or mistakes, I would have no choice, then I toughen up and play the role I must.  But to be forced into the role without the option of whether I want to or not..... To be contradicted everytime I attempt to try and force him into doing his work, or cleaning up, or whatever the case may be.  It makes it frustrating.  How can I say ""Do your homework or you wont use the computer for 2 weeks"" and have him care, when he knows his mother will contradict me out of spite?  I don't know.  Oh well, I go to sleep now."

Longer i have been home... i am getting more pissed off, and more down a bout something, i think I am going to go lay down and think about it for the 30 seconds before i slip into unconciousness, I shall discuss it hopefully tomorow, if it remains an issue."

"event","Well, lets start with my health and what not... I am doing good... tired as always, sore as always, allergies suck, heat is a bastard, but, im not sick or anything at the moment, and that is good.

My mental state is good I think.  I am a bit grouchy, but, nothing major.

Accomplishments? Ahh am I proud of me....

I have been t rying to learn how to detour a function in a program (EQ) for about 5 days now.... Tonight, I finally did it.  What this means is, when it tries to do a check, that it always does.... I now have it say ""Yup, great, next"" and go on with its life, return the proper data, but never actually run the check.  I did it!  Beyond that.... I learned how to trace functions, and really didnt accomplish anything not doing with my computers... im such a little veggie.

Oh, and I rememberd to take my meds tongiht... Something i have forgotten the past 2 =x."

"event","Well another day is coming to a close, and it looks like im going to get to bed somewhat early.....

Health is good, mind is good (very little bugging of me today....)

And I did nothing toda, i mean nothing, accomplished not a god damned thing.  And I like it that way."

"event","Well it seems like I am just everyones emotional throw pillow and rational anchor...

Bob..... keeping him sane through Amy's insanity....

Amy... trying to get her sane to save Bob's sanity...

And Alisa... after she finds out that her step father, who she considers her real father, cheated on her mom this summer. That is what i spent the last 6 hours dealing with.  And the reason for my hasty departure (I could tell something was wrong).....

So I guess being a fucking shoulder ... is my accomplishments for the day..... 

My health? My knots hurt, my chest hurts, im wondering if my sinus infection isnt dead.  The knots could be because im tired.

My chest is most likely because of the knots.....

The sinuses? Most likely allergies.

Mental health....  Tonight this is not so good... I've heard everyones shit all day today, i've heard people upset, It has stressed me out.... which makes me stress about my own shit.... and makes me a fucking wreck... but I am holding up ok... maybe A little cilngy....


Soo... im to tired and to lazy to hook up my pc to watch movies.... so I am toing to go curl up with a pillow and do what I was told to do yesterday instead of falling asleep with a movie."

"event","Today kinda sucked i guess... as i told you, the heat, killed me.... Wasnt even any hotter then like 85, it just drains me so much now.... it wasnt quite so bad after i ate dinner, but still was kind of weak... or as my mother put it .... i looked pale.  Mental health is great, some how i am still in a great mood.  I am begining to wonder if I am taking drugs without my knowledge.

Accomplishments for the day? I slept without a movie or a nightmare!  This is most definately a rarity.   And i get to try agian tonight.. heh.... other accomplishments.. i fixed stu's linux box....  And I got Jake to finish his homework!  Three real accomplishments!

I sleep now."

"event","Amazingly today I actually accomplished something real.... I went over to Bob's for a little while... before me mike and stu went and saw Dawn of the Dead..... And helped build a storage shed.  We didnt finish, but it was certainly enough to wear me out.  I also managed to go see my grandpa, which i have most certainly been meaning to do.

Health is good, im sore, and very tired form a combination of the lack of sleep, sleeping on the couch with no pillow or blanket, work, and it being so late.  I meant to go to bed 3 hours ago, but got tied up in some disassembly and programming work.  Mental health is good, I was in an excellent mood today in fact, hapy enough to scare my self even....."

"event","Well I am up way to late... Stu and the other travis showed up at around 9:30 last night with their PCs and we ended up transfering files and playing video games all night... so this is a bit late in getting posted.... and I am very late in getting to bed.... 

My health, aside form the fact that i am falling asleep sitting up atm, is great, mental health is good as well.... i had fun tonight, and even if i will sleep til 4 now i think it was good for me...

Accomplishments today?  I got VS.net downloaded and installed, a task much more trying then you would imagine.  Uhm.... I remembered to post this, and I remembered to take my medication even though it was after 7 am when I did both.... i hope that suffices, cuz i dont wanna think and i am gonna sleep now...."

"event","Well bob's was fun, .... but guess what? It does lead to a rant!  I am sick and tired of my damned friends bitching to me about their girlfriends or wives because they didnt think through their actions before knocking them up or comitting themselves to a relationship with them... You knew the bitch had more issues then me before you fucking married her, why the fuck do I need to hear about how she is driving you fucking crazy?  You knew she was a bitch, you knew she was a slob, you fucking married her any ways out of love or some such fucking nonsense... why the fuck are you now suddenly claiming to not be in love and wanting a fucking divorce?  Did you just want to make sure you were going to lose your house, car, and 75% of your pay check first?

But i guess thats not fair.....

My health is fine.. dry friggin lips from my medicine.... no cough, no super bad headache ... so thats good....

Mental Health? Uhm... Im a grouchy bitchy pain in the ass since yesterday night, in case the top paragraph didn't give that away... im not upset about anything, or somethign stupid like that, im just grouchy... not a big deal....


I actually have a somewhat real accomplishment this time though!  I slept in my own room again last night... I moved into the living room when i was sick because I was having trouble sleeping, and wanted to see if it helped, unfortunatly it worked, sooo..... it took me a few days to get back into my room but i finally managed it last night...  Uhm.. I dont know what else.... Mainly just sat  around playing video games and studying  a couple books I have on programming.  I got a ups for my systems....  so now my servers wont crash (file loss) if my power goes out... i need to get some cables, and set up the software so that the server will shut itself down though... i need to get 1 or 2 more, so I can back up all my systems.... especially in the living room since the breaker flips because its a 15 amp breaker with.... the microwave, a tv, stereo, 2 vcrs, cable box, dvd player, 3 monitors, 3 pcs, lamp, 2 fans, and the kitchen florescent lights......... yah, it flips.... a lot.... and i get pissed... if i put a ups in here... it will flip off, pcs wont crash... i flip it, they stay on! yay me!

but I dont think that counts as accomplishments... 2 more... uhm... Slept in my room.... was in bed by 1... up by 8... so sleeping good hours has to count for something... (as i post this at 3:15.....)..... I blame bob and his bitching.... I didnt kill anyone or cuss anyone out, even in my complete PMS bitchy mood.....

And now! To sleep... Til noon."

"event","Well... im bored... I don't know anything about this shit really....Uhm... health... nasty cough and a headache all day and a bit of a fever, so probably getting sick again.... mental health?  I haven't stabbed anyone, so i must be doing ok there as well, im not overly upset or depressed about anything...

And accomplishments... well.... thats a tough one... I cooked breakfast, like i told ya.... hope that counts.... uhm... learned some more about disassembly and what the various functions are.  Learning is good.... and i guess I learned some more about c and c++ programming.  Not much.  But its something i suppose.  Go me!"

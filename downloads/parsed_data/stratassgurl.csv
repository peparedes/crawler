"event","Hey,
 Not a very eventful day today. Im just writing right now cuz its late and im bored hence my ""subject"". :P
 I didnt do much today but i had fun at doing nothing. I got up at 11(not an often occurence), went to the solarium with Kelly at 1. Cool yet hot at the same time :P god im lame lol. now im officially NATURAL COLORED as opposed to my usual WHITE skin. I prefer to call it ""porcelain"" :P 
 Then after the solarium i came home, went to buy Rays gift, got him a guitar, am broke now cuz of it but it was worth it, he's happy. Leon was teaching him how to play it today. AFter going to get Rays gift i cleaned and cooked supper. Yes i am ahousewife (not really but i should be) :P Then i went to stavanger drive to my weekly visit to Pets Unlimited. I miss my doggy :(
   anywho tonight ihad fun, went to  Crystal's, watched Pretty Woman for the first time. yesi know what you're thinking ""what gurl hasnt seen pretty woman!?"" well the answer was me until tonight. awesome movie though, hookers rule :P 
 but thats about it....oh yeah i ate lotsa junk food so ive probably gained about ten pounds but meh ....ill sweat that off the summer....hopefully lol if summer ever comes. Anyways that about all i have to say, if nething eventful ever happens in my uneventful night i shall write again.  
 BUH BYE!"

"event","Greetings All, 
 this is just a little test message to get used to this .....thing. My best friend Crystal AKA Cryssal has one of these so i figured I would be a loser and get one too. And then all of you can read my thoughts and feelings. I just have to warn those of you who are squimish, my journal may contain vulgar language and explicit (and Descriptive) content. 
  Feel free to make comments, but please leave your names. i like to know who's imsulting me :p or loving me whichever"

In fact, I think I'm going to do just that. :3

Homework's been finished since Friday, yesterday afternoon was one of those rare days when everybody was home and not doing anything except for flopping, and then I spent this morning at the gym. Despite that, though, I still have a lot of energy... therefore I want to dance. &hearts;

"event","I get so busy and before I know it, it's nearly the end of August and the beginning of the next school term. Summer vacation sure went by quickly, didn't it? Our last summer vacation and autumn term as high schoolers...~ It's actually sort of depressing when I think about it. This is the term when tennis comes to an end, too... let's do our best, everyone. :3 &hearts; Let's make this last run count.

<lj-cut text=""Private"">[ I feel almost relieved that my parents know, now. I don't need to tip-toe around them, nor do I need to particularly hide anything. I'm surprised with how smoothly dinner went with Tezuka there - my mom did ask a ridiculous amount of questions, but at least she's okay with it in the end.

I wasn't really expecting what she... did, either. I honestly can't remember the last time I've hugged my mom. I really do think that things can only get better from here. I'm not going to be in the house for that much longer, I don't think, and I've already began to think about the different possibilities once I've graduated... but for now, I'm comfortable.

On that note, though... I don't think Ayana is going to be staying around for much longer. I just have this feeling that she'll be bringing up the idea of moving out soon with my parents. It almost feels like... we're taking the next step. I don't <i>need</i> my big sister like I used to, and she doesn't need to fill the special role she's always had in the family, anymore. My parents have accepted that I'm more than old enough to make my own decisions, and they can recognize something that makes me happy, even if they don't agree. I think my parents are slowly realizing that they don't need to work as hard, anymore... it's really only a matter of time before they slow down, I think. They don't need to support us as much, anymore. Ayana's almost twenty-two, I'm almost eighteen - we're adults. :3

And while I'm thinking about it, too... I can't get over how happy 'nee-chan is. I don't remember seeing her ever this happy when she was dating her ex-boyfriend; especially not when she entered college. And Kentarou... he's so happy, too. They're both so very obvious. I know I freaked out when I first found out, but now I look at them and think to myself that maybe it was always supposed to be like that.

It's almost weird. I mean, it's strange to look at your big sister and your best friend and believe that they were meant to be together, now.

I think I've done enough thinking for the night, though. I'm gonna phone and see if Kentarou and Higashikata want to play something. >:O ]</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Tezuka"">[ I wanted to tell you that I showed my parents that journal entry I wrote when I was a kid. You were right - it was something they appreciated very much. I didn't mean to make my mom <i>cry</i> or anything, but... I guess it was really something special to them. She even asked me if she could keep it tucked away, and I told her I didn't mind.

Also, I have a question~ :3 There's a big end of the summer fireworks show and festival Friday afternoon and evening... will you come with me? &hearts; ]</lj-cut>"

Mom's not happy... she's never spoken to me that coldly before. Dad's a bit better about it, and I really do have to thank him - both he and Ayana saved my ass.

It really hurt, but I know she'll like Tezuka. She's met him before, but she's never had a chance to sit down and get to know him properly. For now, though, I'm just going to stay out of her way.

As much as I didn't want to tell them, I do feel a lot better. It's like a giant weight has been lifted off my chest, and now I don't have to worry about them just finding out on their own. ]</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Tezuka"">[ Camping was so much fun. :3 &hearts; Thank you for taking me and patiently answering my millions of questions. I'd love to go again - I really learned a lot. It's so nice to get away from the city even if only for a weekend...~

Oh, and I talked to my parents the other night. It... well, it could've gone worse, I think. They'll get used to the idea eventually. My dad has asked to have you over for dinner one day soon, though, if you don't mind. ^^; I think it'll help the issue with my mom if she has a chance to get to know you a bit, and my dad's just curious about you. ]</lj-cut>

Beach this weekend~ Nobody forget. &hearts; 

Spending the morning at the gym with a punching bag feels really good. I need to make it a regular thing, again - I've been slacking off a bit with how much I've been practicing tennis, but it's always a nice change of pace to do something else even if just for a couple of hours. Now the tennis practices have slowed down a bit, I think I'm going to go more often. :3"

Now that the tournament's over, I think Yamabuki's joined in on the flopping from the heat that other schools seem to be suffering from. It'd be nice if we could somehow get our hands on using the gym some days for practicing, but we probably won't be so lucky when other teams are also using the facilities. 

And on that note, congrats to 'Buki~ &hearts; I'm proud of my team for their performance at the tournament. <strike>Three strikes, you're out, Hyou~tei.</strike>

I haven't felt that turned on in a while. What is it about Tezuka? Is it because in past relationships I've been so focused on pleasuring the other that my wishes have been pushed a bit to the side? No one has ever been able to reduce me to <i>that</i> before. The walk and train ride home felt way longer than it should have, and I swear I took twice as long in the shower as I usually do. 

...I haven't stopped dreaming about it, though, and it's been three days. 

I'm also not going to worry so much about my parents, right now. I'll put a bit more thought into it after the camping trip, but for now, there's no point getting worked up about it. ]

- 'Nee-chan made me the best breakfast without even asking her to~

Seigaku had a good idea with the Kyoto trip, really~ 'Buki's done similar things in the past, but it's never been something like that.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Private"">[ I've adjusted to the idea. I mean... it's still very weird. My <i>best friend</i> is dating my <i>big sister</i>. I walked in to see them <i>making out</i> on the couch. It's one thing to walk in on your sister making out with someone on the couch - it's another to see your best friend making out with someone on the couch. But... together? I don't think I've ever been that surprised in my life before.

I guess I kinda did overreact. At least everything is out in the open, now. I don't know how long it's been going on, and I really do wish they had told me themselves rather than have me accidentally walking in on them, but... I guess in a way I'm kinda happy, too. These are the two most important people to me in my life and they've found happiness together. That's something to be happy about.

>:O Doesn't mean I necessarily have to love the idea...

...But it's not gonna just go away because I want it to. At least I won't ever have to worry about needing to kick either of their asses. Kentarou's a great guy and will take care of my sister - 'nee-chan is a great woman and she'll take care of my best friend. I know they're both happy for who I've found... the least I can do is feel the same toward them. &hearts;

On the subject of Tezuka... well. There's not much to really say about this. I'm in love with him - it's simple. It seemed far more confusing a month ago until I kinda realized it. 'Nee-chan and I have talked about it several times, actually. It's still... a scary feeling, and especially when it's this strong. 

Though, I'm really not looking forward to the time when I have to tell my parents - they're not going to approve of me dating a male, no matter how wonderful of a person Tezuka is. They must be wondering why I haven't brought a girl home in quite a while, so I wouldn't be surprised if they've already figured it out (...then again, I'm also not going to be surprised if they <i>haven't</i> - mom and dad haven't exactly been very... observant about some things in my life; especially when it comes to dating), but still. Not looking forward to that, whenever it should come up.

I'm so happy, though. ^^ &hearts; This is such a wonderful feeling. ]</lj-cut>

I'm sorry for my outburst the other day. &hearts; I'm doing much better for any of you who were puzzled.

I've really felt something strongly lately, and I think I can understand the feeling parents get when their children do something to make them proud. I've been just watching the team - watching the first years work hard and really look up to some of the older players, helping the second years become stronger so they can work hard for their regular spots next year, and observing the third years as they compete to try to defeat a regular in the ranking matches. Then, of course, our regulars - training diligently so we can climb higher in the ranks to secure a spot in nationals.

What makes this so special to me, though, is the fact that everyone's still having a great time. We've all really worked hard together to create a team that is competitive, but doesn't forget that the only reason why we're playing tennis at all - for the love of the game. I think that's something that is sometimes shoved to the side in favor of all the rivalries and tournaments where everyone's goal is to win... 

I'm proud of my school. I've gone to 'Buki for twelve years, and I want to continue to until I'm no longer able to. I'm proud of my team, of my club, of my friends and teammates...

I know I'm not always a good one, but... I'm proud to be fukubuchou. :3 And I'm proud of our buchou - the one who holds us all together as a team, and has played the largest part in making 'Buki the way it is today. He may not be the perfect buchou, but he's perfect for us. I wouldn't have it any other way. &hearts;

I've also realized I don't say thank you nearly enough as I should; so, to all who deserve to have this said to them, thank you - for everything. :3 &hearts; 

I think I'm going to go out and buy both my mom and sister a bouquet of their favorite flowers, and write a letter to put beside my dad's dinner on the table to read when he comes home late.

- Forgot my PE uniform, and the teacher wouldn't let me wear my tennis stuff since he thought that would be ""bragging"" - it's not like everyone doesn't already <i>know</i> that I'm fukubuchou of the tennis club. Geez. I just wanted to do PE!
- Lost a game against Touji.
- Got lost trying to find Kawamura Sushi.
- Spilled Fanta on my school uniform - that's gonna be a bitch to get out.

[ONLY those who know!]
It's...strange being back here.  In the physical realm.  So much has happened since I've been gone.  Everyone is returning...was there some kind of battle?  If so, is Harry still alive?  Great Godric...how am I to find him and protect him if I cannot come out in the open?

There are so many things floating around in my head...it's hard to just keep them all separated.

The biggest one on my mind is Oliver.  Where is he?  He's not using these journals anymore which, doesn't really surprise me...but the thing that does surprise me is that I can't seem to figure out where he is.  Meditating isn't working...I just hope he turns up somewhere soon...I <b>need</b> to talk to him.

Tomorrow I'm going to talk to Dumbledore.  I'm sure he already knows that I'm back.  Hopefully this bloody crow will stop following me around...I don't get it!  Everywhere I go, ever since I came out of the shack...the thing has been right at my back.

I remember being a young ninja partying all night long listening to the hits, flirting with girls and getting sick (from drinking.... not flirting). Being a yong silly pants was pretty fun, but it is good to be an adult that gets tired and needs to chill and pass out early.

Just the other day karate woman and I totally decided to go to sleep early... FOR FUN. We just went to sleep. It was really cool.

This Sensei totally is the biggest idiot ever... 

Ninja + Idiot = Super Idiotic Ultra Idiot

This one time, two of our kunoichi went on a mission to see if our sensei's arch-enemy really was as bad and idiotic as we've been told. He was. They ran out of the Ninja Training Centre laughing their heads off when class was over.

This other time my sensei was talking to this Super Huge Boss Ninja, and the Boss Ninja was like ""do you think that idiotic sensei is a total idiot?"" and my sensei was like ""Yep"". So the Boss Ninja was like ""Me too. You wanna join our clan?"" 

This other time, the idiotic ninja went to this huge Kickboxing Temple and was like ""Any of my Ninjas can beat up any of your Kicking Boxers!!!"" Then all the fighters were like ""Yeah right"" So they fought, and even some of the beginner Kick Boxers totally wasted the Idiotic Sensei's students... the idiot sensei was like ""Yeah, well... If we really used our REAL ninja techniques you'd all be DEAD!"" Face it idiot Ninja Sensei, if your students get their asses beat bad it will be your own stupid fault!

One last tale about stupid idiotic ninjas is this one time when the idiotic ninja was doing a Ninja demo at a high school... He asked for the hugest kid in the school to grab his wrist and he'd use special ninja techniques to break free. Well he couldn't. Then he was like ""Yeah, well... If we really used our REAL ninja techniques you'd all be DEAD!"" 

No offense to anyone that knows, or IS the idiotic ninja. I've never met them/you myself, so maybe I'm a big idiot for writing this anyway. It's pretty rough when you are famous worldwide for being an idiot.

It was so scary it was freaky.

I was riding a bike to Victoria from up island. I had to ride through this weird hall. The hall was still a road though, with arches that you could see through and view the scenery from the mountain hwy... The malahat for anyone that knows it. Then there were these stairs and doors. I went down some stairs and then into a door... Now it was like a big strange house, but still on the Malahat...

Inside was Karatewoman (my girlfriend, who wants a new name... but I need to think of one) and we sat and talked for awhile...

Then she was like ""Hey I got somthing really weird. wanna see?"" I was like ""Yeah"" So she pulled out this basket that had a bunch of odd items in it. ""I got it at the thrift store"", she said. Then she was like ""look at this""...

She handed me a little box that contained an old projector disk, but it was a tape format. On the box was this eerie picture of a creepy dolls face, and some other creepy art and strange light effects. It was called something like ""The Madeline Tapes"". I read the back and it said it was some bizarre footage a guy took of a little girl's ghost... we debated watching it, and decided to. Somehow, the odd house we were in was connected with the tapes, which made it creepier. Karatewoman told me to start without her while she went to the bathroom. 

I began the tape, and there was this creepy footage of a house... It was all dark and silent. there was some light, and it was in color. It was definitely spooky, but I sat fascinated. Suddenly without warning the film made a shriek and a girl appeared for a split second and then there was all these trippy light tracers, and as the lights faded there was a small circle of light that was at a diagonal angle and it faded out.

I was totally spooked, so I paused it and sat collecting myself. Karatewoman returned and asked me what was wrong, so I told her... Both of us were totally freaked out, and we guessed that maybe 'The Ring' might have been based on these tapes. After that I just remember how creepy I felt, and then I woke up.. Thank Christ!

"event","The weather is so nice! The birds are singing, and my black ninja suit (which is as black as night) is too hot for this nice weather. If you thought the only reason ninjas wear black at night is to ""blend in"" and ""disappear"" then you got another thing coming. If we wore black in the day, we'd be soaking with sweat and we'd leave a trail of hot ninja steam everywhere we went (which would be all kinds of suck).

In fact, ninjas ONLY wear suits under ANY circumstances... 

Examples include; missions, birthdays, church, work, prom, second-fourth comings of Christ, John Travolta marathons, D&D, novel writing, babysitting, and car washes.

I just typed a bunch of stuff, but it was far too Robert Hamburger for my likings. Not to say anything bad about Robert, I mean, he does run the OFFICIAL NINJA site on the web (that means, don't make him throw a tantrum), and I obviously got some inspiration from his wonderfully educational webpage.

Anyhow, I got my first ninja suit when I was in Tae Kwon Do and Aikido at the same time. This meant that I could look like a real ninja while jump-spin-kicking and throwing my enemies with grace and peace in my heart. It was pretty cool, except my Tae Kwon Do teacher was this funny guy from our Aikido dojo, and I had a higher rank than him in the Aikido dojo... He could still have Tae Kwon Do-ed me to death back then, plus he had a sweet mustache too. Anyhow, me and my friend got these ninja suits and read lots of books about ninjas, and we snuck around the rural area he lived in. We even spied on our friend's family, and saw odd things like a dad hanging upside down from the swing set, and moaning lots, and a brother peeing off of the deck in the middle of the night. We didn't have tabi boots back then though, so my old school skater Vans had to do the trick (some kid even made fun of us too). It was awesome, and so were we."

"event","I think it is now time for me to tell the story of how I first learned about Ninjas.

I was but a lad of 4 years or so, and I returned home with my parents from some family trip. I ran out to meet my friends that were playing in the neighborhood... When I got there, my older-cooler friends were play fighting on the big hill. 

I was like ""Can I play too?"" And this kid I didn't know, that was friends with one of my friends, was like ""Yeah..."" So I was like ""What are we playing?"" and he was like ""We are NINJAS IN THE ARCTIC."" Then I said, ""What's a INJA?"" And he got sort of bugged by my wrong pronunciation, so he asserted ""NNNNNNINJA.... They're karate guys that wear masks and have different colored suits. I'm the blue ninja.""

So I was like, ""fuck yeah"" (except I didn't really cause I was a little kid). Then I declared myself the Orange ninja, and all the other kids said what color ninja they were, and we all started fighting to the death.




Another early memory to relate was when I was at my babysitters house. She was my mom's friend, and would look after me cause she was nice. She had a bunch of daughters that were really cool 80's girls. The teen girls were into hard rock and dated boys with mullets that smoked cigaroos... They used to chase me and tickle me while listening to ""Blondie""... Anyhow...

So this one night I was watching TV with the daughter closest to my age, and this show comes on. I didn't know what it was then, but I have come to know that it was none other than ""The Master"" with Lee Van Cleef and Sho Kosugi. I knew then that Ninjas were everything they should be and more.

THen I got older, and there was some show with some turtles, and a bunch of movies, and then I thought ninjas were funny (they are), and then I bought a book by Stephen Hayes, and the I found a dojo, and then I trained for many years, and then I started a humorous online journal all about the ninja side of me. And then you read it, and maybe you laughed.

I just had an intelligence seeker that just pissed me off super bad. These two old idiots just came in and accused me of withholding vital information critical to their mission. They said that I was ""a really bad"" person and that I added two whole days to their mission, which is utter bull.

I guess they entered our Agency yesterday requesting info on the most efficient way to Seattle from Victoria. I told them the route I would take would be to take the Ferry to Tsawwassen and then to drive across the border into Seattle. Easy.

But then they were all like, ""We found out we could just take the Seattle Clipper from Victoria!"" (When she said this she sounded like a stupid idiotic granny). Then I was like ""yeah, here's the info."" Then they were continued to bust my chops about how much of an idiot I was. So I was like, ""You want the most efficient way? You can take a seaplane right into Seattle."" 

This is when I got super pumped/pissed.

In her most heinous voice she said... ""Well, you are a real SMART-ASS aren't you *Too Dark Ninja*?"" She looked at my badge on my uniform to find out my name, just to get me ready to fight to the death.

I was so mad, but I only had two choices.

1) Flip out and kill the whole building (Except my friends)
2) Use breathing techniques to prevent a violent explosion of Ninja Vengeance, and keep helping nicely.

I chose number two, cause I like to have a fairly normal life where I can go to plays and have a home with food in the fridge... If I chose number one, I'd be forced to live in a ninja temple in the jungle (I don't Like Jungles that much) and go on missions with lots of spraying blood and explosions everywhere.

So anyway... It turned out that they had a car! No wonder why I didn't tell them about the clipper! It doesn't take cars! There is a Port Angeles Ferry, but it would land them far from Seattle and they would have to take another boat after that, AND it only leaves twice a day! The Ferry I suggested left many many times a day, and they could drive on one simple highway all the way to whatever home for idiotic morons they live in. 

Moral of the story:

Assume that the person getting the info is a stupid idiot. Tell them EVERYTHING, even the dumb stuff, cause stupid idiots LOVE stupid idiotic advice. Just look at the state of the world!

Anyhow, writing in my journal and talking to my fellow ""intelligence agents"" as been very therapeutic for me. Thanks."

Well, I finally finished and went to Karate Woman's temple so we could go out and party... But she was sad because she thought we were going to have more alone time and eat ice cream. Well, we had a long talk and it turned out that there was lots of stuff bugging her. Anyhow, we got over it, and headed to the night club to rock out. We paid our cover and in we went.

"event","So I sat in my car for a good hour last night... debating... should I go over there and ease this troubled heart? All I would need would be one glance one slight touch of her magic hand to bring that bright smile back to my face. But like an addict I try to convince my self that one quick meeting by the moon light near her window would be enough when in reality there is never enough time to satisfy this drugged heart of mine when time is up I always want more and more and more and the time spent together always seems to last for seconds instead of hours. So I sat in my car and looked at he sky hoping that maybe just maybe she would be looking at the same stars that night."

Watching as you're torn apart
Your lips are bloodied
You're black and blue
And the only thing I think is

""How can I save you?""
""How can I save you?""
""How can I save you?""
""How can I save you?""

I kick and scream
I tearing at this screen
Which separates you from me
My face gets scratched
My hands are broken
Only to achieve...
A glance from you

""How can I save you?""
""How can I save you?""
""How can I save you?""
""How can I save you?""

We stand face to face
And hand on hand
When slowly I start to understand
You're not battered
You're not broken
You're on the outside staring in
And you're the one thinking...

""How can I save you?""
""How can I save you?""
""How can I save you?""
""How can I save you?""

Tonight we march to show we love.
Tonight we march to save the children.
Tonight we march.
Tonight we march.
Tonight we march
and I sing a song...

---------------------------------------------------
I have called you children, I have called you son. 
What is there to answer if I'm the only one? 
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light. 
Still I must obey, still I must invite. 
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do, 
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you. 

I was dressed embarrassment. 
I was dressed in wine. 
If you had a part of me, will you take you're time? 
Even if I come back, even if I die 
Is there some idea to replace my life? 
Like a father to impress; 
Like a mother's mourning dress, 
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you 

I have called you preacher; I have called you son. 
If you have a father or if you haven't one, 
I'll do anything for you. I did everything for you"

"event","I have had a bunch of people ask me why I have started to write G-d in replace of the name of The All Mighty. This is actually a Jewish custom and it is designed for two reasons.

<i><b><u>Reason 1)</i></b></u> The Jewish culture believes that the name of G-d is two holy to simply be on man made manuscripts of any kind the only time it appears in it's entirety is in the Holy Texts.

<i><b><u>Reason 2)</i></b></u> It reminds the writer of the manuscript just how <i>holy</i> and <i>awesome</i> G-d really is!!! When I go to write HIS name I have to stop and remember to remove the letter ""o"". This reminds me of reason #1 and lets me think about how G-d has <b>impacted</b> my life today."

"event","MAN! It feels like I just made it home from Mississippi and now I get to turn around and go to Colorado! I'm really sleepy... When I sit and think about it I am so blessed!
It's amazing that I get to do the things I do. So people will go through life and never get to do the things I do or see the places I've seen.

THANK YOU GOD!!!

It's funny how when you really think about all the things G-d has blessed you with you don't seem to have any more problems.

I'm not saying that theres not some tough things going on right now, but I am saying that all things considering I technically deserved to die and go to hell the first time I sinned which was like what when I was two!?!

I've decided that I am going to try to start responding to the question ""How are you doing?"" with either ""I'm Blessed!"" or probably more likely, ""Better than I deserve!"" It will be just a little reminder to the fact that even though something maybe really bad in my life, that thing is a billion times better than what I truly deserve.

I think everyone should let go of everything. Not like give up all your possessions... that is unless God calls you to do that. I mean like what it says in 1 John 2:15-17!

JUST LET GO!

Give it to Christ...

...And then...

He will use you in ways you never even dreamed of!

May the LORD bless you and keep you, Amen!

"event","Today I shall enlighten all of my fellow drama friends on a few new shows coming out on Broadway to keep an eye out for!

First... This has to be first because Steven Lynch is the leading male! That is right the comedian song writer who brought us such songs as Special Fred and Special Olympics is now in the Broadway Version of ""THE WEDDING SINGER!"" A romantic comedy about a wedding singer who falls in love with one of his clients!

Secondly we have the revival of Neil Simon's ""Barefoot in the Park"" Starring Patrick Wilson, Amanda Peet, Jill Clayburgh, and Jill Clayburgh! This will be a wonderfully comedic stage play!

Thirdly we have ""Ring of Fire"" Broadways version of the movie ""Walk the Line"". A Musical All about Johnny Cash.

4th, A musical adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" this musical contains some of the movie elements but the director and Managers have taken creative liberties to bring their own interpretation of the characters and scenery.

5th, A daring step for director Doug Hughes to bring a Eugene O'Neill piece to the stage. O'Neill, arguably the greatest American writer, has written many complex and layered characters which made his works undesirable to bring to stage until now when Broadway will have ""A Touch of A Poet"" live on it's stage.

6th, The music and life of the members of the music group Four Seasons has ben immortalized in the Broadway Musical ""Jersey Boys"" this vivacious musical will have you tapping your foot and singing along to some of your favorite Four Seasons music like ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" ""Walk Like A Man"" and ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You""! I Can't wait to see this one!

7th, Broadway won't NOT do anything... That's right there is going to be a new off-broadway musical all about white trash!!! Welcome to the stage... ""Great American Trailer Park Musical""

8th, ""In My Life"" Even I need to keep my eye out for this one... more info coming soon... (Good music though)EDIT: Apperently this show has closed... too bad it looked good! Sorry

9th, ""Lennon"" a musical about the music of John Lennon.

there ARE more but as of now I don't want to type any more... Keep your eye out for any good, new stuff and let me know!"

I was just thinking about how the saddest times in my life always seem to float around holidays... I don't know why or how... I guess it's just the thoughts that run through my head at those time... like the idea that all the happieness around these holidays, all the joy on peoples faces is just that only ""on their faces"" it's surface level. A skin deep expression held out for the world to see as if to say, ""Look holiday=happieness and because you are happy I will be happy!"" yet all the while inside they are consumed with their life long or day-to-day problems. I never was much for masking sorrow with a bright smiling face just so I can fit in. now don't get me wrong... there have been times when my life seemed like a personal hell and yet I still sported a smile. But this was to protect the interest of people or to make sure I didn't ruin someones event or day. But when it comes to holidays it makes my alone times even more depressing. First off my personallity type hates being alone anyway so when I am it's usually not a good thing. but when I have enough time to meditate on the masks others ware to hide their pain and also the pain I've buaried deep within me it becomes extremely cold... not only physicly cold but it feels like my very some has lost warmth. So I must make it a custom to have a constant prayer for joy. not holiday joy, but the joy that can only come from the holy ghost. I went through all that to say that I've started this prayer a few days ago and now that it is Memorial day weekend, I have kept my spirits high and have not wavered in my happieness. And there is a bonus... Laura is coming over tonight! haha sorry I just had to throw that in there somewhere... you may go gage now if you would like...
Anywho I would just like to thank all those who have been praying for me... Believe me I need it... And Joy, tell your mother thank you. For some reason I just know without a doubt that she was not just thossing up a little prayer for me every now and then but has poured her whole heart into it. Don't ask me how I know that cause I really don't know how I do either it's just a feeling I've got. Oh and thank you in advance to all those who read this and start praying for me you guys all ROCK my face off!!!

Love,
jerk face!

P.S. If for some reason you don't believe that I get extremely emo during holidays check out my post on Saturday, December 25, 2004 @ 10:42 AM... and hey even if u do believe me check it out just for the purpose of reading <B><U>JEN'S</B></U> comment. (I put ""JEN'S"" in bold and underlined it cause I know she would never read this far down into a large entry like this with out a big hook type word. hehe)"

Once again a great band has bit the bullet!
Calibretto 13's unique voice and sometime fun/serious lyrics will never record another cd again!

BUT! TO STAY LOYAL TO THERE FANS Calibretto 13... has posted !!!50!!! mp3's on there website thats right !!!50!!! free of charge just download them right to your computer.

Calibretto 13 is a christian group that usually talks about the moral decline of america because of things like MTV and Hollywood on a lighter note they also have songs about a psycho killer grandma and finding out that Santa wasn't really when he was 19 when he saw he dad putting presents under the tree... how sad... and my favorite a song about getting extremely mad at a gay man for being gay... but then remembering he's God's kid too!

WARNING~ Calibretto 13's lyrics arn't your normal ""christian"" lyrics... they use words like freakin', pubic hair, ""Bust a cap in your head"", ""go to hell"" (talking about satan), ""beat the crap out of you"", etc. BUT THEY DO NOT CURSE!

Yeah for christian lyrics that talk like there from today and not the happy wholesome idealistic 50's"

A Plain Morning 
by Dashboard Confessional 

It's yet to be determined
but the air is thick
and my hope is feeling worn
i'm missing home
and i'm glad you're not a part of this
there's parts of me that will be missed

and the phone is always dead to me
so I can't tell you
the tempurature is dropping
and it feels like

it's colder than it oughta be in march
and i've still got a day or two ahead of me
till i'll be heading home
into your arms, again
and the people here are asking after you
it doesn't make it easier
it doesn't make it easier to be away

I'd like to hire a plane
and see you in the morning
when the day is fresh,
i'm coming home again
coming home again
coming home again
when the day is fresh,
i'm coming home again

well, it's warmer where you're waiting
it feels more like july
there's pillows in their cases
and one of those is mine
and you wrote the words, ""I love you""
and sprayed it with perfume
it's better than the fire is
to heat this lonely room
it's warmer where you're waiting
it feels more like july
it feels more like july

and it's yet to be determined

I finally got out of the house so, you guessed it, I went strait to Laura's house!
I was so happy. It seems like just seeing her makes everything better no matter how much life sucks (And believe me life can reeeeeeeally SUCK!) So we watched Eternal Sunshine and I loved it + it didn't hurt my opinion of the movie by having my baby in my arms. Anyways the movie ended and I was informed that I was going to be late getting back home... AGAIN! SO after we said our goodbyes (Which gets harder everytime... one of these days I won't!) I drove home where I received my punishment of a day of groundation for every minute I was late... so see you guys in 15 days! HECK YES! SEE YOU GUYS ON 04-11-05!

I'm going through human contact withdrawal it really sucks the big one!
Well it's official I have pretty much been grounded through my spring break.. but the weird thing is, is that for some reason if my family goes out to do something I can go. So far on my groundation I have not been able to see and/or talk to my friends or the most beautiful, kind, wonderful, perfect woman in the world! BUT, because my family went, I have been to the movies Islands of Adventure, the mall, and out to dinner several times! WHAT THE HECK!?! I think this is really just an evil ploy by my father to try and spend more time with me due to the fact that every time I'm home my parents are not but when they are home they get frustrated cause I wanna be out... oh the vicious cycle! Well that is pretty much all I have to say except for the fact that I miss everyone enormously, and NO Amanda I didn't forget your B-day! I got you a gift while I was out with the fam one night... and I'll prob. get you another one, you know for interest over a delay in the gift giving deadline (AKA Your Birthday)... Well I must go now and... do... nothing... OH GOD... I'll probably go make a prison shiv now and then try to dig a hole through the floor to the out side world.

PS I love you baby don't forget it and... ""I'll see ya on the out side"""

a laundry list of problems doesn't make you interesting,
never getting help doesn't make you brave,
not listening to reason doesn't mean that you have faith,
you're just cutting off your nose to spite your face.

(+'s and -'s)
1. Waking up late after a long restless night (--)

2. Getting to school without forgetting anything (+)

3. Hanging out down town with Deangilo & Stacey and pan handling twenty
   people looking like a homeless person(++++)
     (Deangilo is a homeless screen writer and Stacey is his
      producer who has been off the street for two weeks)

4. Seeing TFA kids finally get it! (+++)

5. Drama practice (-)

6. Seeing Laura at drama (even though I didn't get to talk to her) (+++++)

7. Losing my keys and being unable to find them for an hour while having
   to walk back and fourth through the rain between my car and the school. (-----)

8. Getting home at 7 o'clock (-)

9. Getting a call from the most beautiful person on earth during her work break (+++)

10. having to fix my older brothers broken laptop power cable (-)

11. Being shocked by 120 Volts of electricity because my stupid dog barked
    scaring the crap out of me while simultaneously touching electric cables
    to a piece of metal in my hand. (-----)

13. Being told by my own dad that I'm spending too much time with Laura and
    that she will go to college and we won't see each other ever again and I
    should just get over it cause this relationship won't happen because statistics
    show that the average teen falls in and out of love five time. (------) GOD DAMN IT
    DAD I'M NOT SOME DAMN STATISTIC I'm NOT AVERAGE I WON'T LET MY SELF BE EVER!

12. getting a call from BG and talking about the major exodus of drama people
    next year and the possibility for me and him to runaway to DP and leave
    the last 8 years of my life, spent on building up this program, to wither
    and die in front of my eyes! (-----)

typing on LJ while I am utterly exhausted (-/+) I don't care anymore

Total +'s: (17)
Total -'s: (27)

Result: (TODAY STARTED OFF GREAT, BUT OVER ALL SUCKED THE BIG ONE BECAUSE LIFE
         WON'T LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE AND LET ME ENJOY THE GOOD THINGS!) 

AFTER THOUGHTS: Screw everything, forget everyone, let me start over, let me not apply my self or get involved in anything, let me not have dreams or hopes that can be smashed, let me lose it all, have nothing, just apathy, nothing else just uselessness, just emptiness, just be alone... alone... alone"

"event","I received my orders yesterday and the pool table today!  So excited!
<center>
1ST TOY: DA POOL TABLE -  My honey always wanted to get one....and voila! We finally got one for the basement.  He was so excited that he didnt even wait for anybodys help to set it up. Can you believe how he can manage to carry it by himself? I know he's pretty strong...He's got some strong muscles heheheh.  Now, all my friends and his friends can come over and play.

2ND TOY:  DA PHONE - I found this phone really cute!  My mom broke our blue neon phone hehehe so I wanted a replacement for it. Since we already have 2 cordless phones, I decided to get a corded phone this time. Tweety bird is really cute... The phone talks everytime the phone rings.  It also comes with digital clock and radio.  So cool!!!
<img src=""http://image.sears.ca/icat/16/40/572516405.fpx?cell=230&cvt=jpeg"">
3RD TOY:  DA KITCHEN RADIO/CD:  I found it so quiet in our house since it's only Dan and I that lives there.  Dan usually turns on the t.v. while I am cooking. I decided to get this radio for the kitchen so I can sing while cooking...or maybe even dance ahhahahahah.
<img src=""http://image.sears.ca/icat/20/08/572520087.fpx?cell=230&cvt=jpeg"">
4TH TOY:  DA HAIR DRYER WITH THE MOUNT: Ive always wanted this one. I hate hair dryers' cords.  I find this hair dryer useful so I can mount it on the wall.  I got the idea from the hotels.  Its pretty cool. I hate putting the damn hair dryer inside the drawers. I have no space for it.
<img src=""http://image.sears.ca/icat/84/73/112584730.fpx?cell=230&cvt=jpeg"">

I am so excited to go home. I know my honey is already playing pool. We still have to change our entertainment centre. We have to buy a new one.  We're gonna give out the other one...what a waste.  Maybe i'll just give it to my sister. I dont know."

You have nothing to be loser and a half anymore......
All my entries.....are gonna be Strictly for friends now.
This will be the last entry especially for you.....  I just thought, I needed to entertain you first before you can no longer see my entries here.

Whatever I do or say is my business.. I never intended to hurt you or anybody else. Thats why I dont understand why you are going into my business....Damn, I only had one fan before.. Now I have 2... Why dont u guys stay away of my business?  So what if I have what I have right now?  Dan and I worked hard for it.  If youre happy, then so be it.. I dont give a care.  But please dont put me into your desperation.  I have nothing to do with it.  I never said anything to offend you or whatsoever
I cant believe all these people are going against me.. It's just me!  hahahahahaha.. Dont be too carried away.  _____ x2 people against 1.  Damn!

I thought youre educated...then why don't u use it.  I thought you were something else... But i guess I was wrong...you are also one of the NO LIFE PATHETIC PITIFUL L.O.S.E.R.S.
Please do not make it so transparent.

STAY CALM.... I thought you dont want to spend your ""PRECIOUS TIME"" on me.  I guess, I am such a celebrity...well, I am so loving the attention...I LOVE IT!!!!!

If you think I have said or mentioned to deteriorate you or any of your precious people, face me..if you think your mature enough...do not be a baby.  Because I never did say anything to put you down.

Why are you always targeting my success???!?!?   I never did compare my success to any of you.  Y do you always think that I think I have more than you. I dont remember mentioning that in any of my entries.. And I cannot compare anything to something I know nothing about....

Please.....do yourself a favour, and dont deny it:  For once, think before you say something bcos whatever u say, it will always come back to you.....

HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA....who ever said you have the last laugh?


BYE L.O.S.E.R.S.

We are going crazy shopping for our furnitures and decorations in house....
Infact, we just bought a wooden set of furniture at Pier 1 Import with green accent for our living room.
Dan and I were so excited to decorate the house. We already decided what theme we are going to have in each section of the house.
Here's what we have decided:
Living room: It will have a nature theme....so we decided to buy:
Wooden furniture
We have:  Green marble centre and coffee table.  Black entertainment unit.  Black 20"" inch t.v. because the living room space is quite small.  black component system.
We still have to buy:  centre piece, gold frame to put our picture, gold painting, and a palm tree (fake one hehe)
Just imagine that...hmmm.... Very green

Our dining room.....
We already have a dining table (wooden one) with matching chairs.
I just bought wooden mats at Pier 1 import.
We still havent decided which centre piece were going to put to match our blue sapphire plates...

Kitchen..... White and blue
We have white cupboards and our phone, microwave are blue.  Our plates, cups are all blue.  

Basement..... Silver and black
We have a black leather sofa, silver t.v., silver component system,
I still have to buy a black entertainment set and silver frames....

Rooms..... Master bedroom will be Roman Style...
We have cream bedroom set.... hard to explain, i guess i'll just show u in picture
2nd room...will be flowery
3rd room..will be computer room with lots and lots of stuff animals..

I dont know if u can actually picture my explanation but I'll take pictures of each room and for sure, i'll put it here.. oki doki..

"event","My weekend was the best week-end ever in my whole entire life.  I know it was tiring but it was all worth it.  
Since I was a kid, I always dream about being successful and achieving something in life and I am glad, God helped me to make all my dreams come true.  It is slowly coming true and without the help of God, i dont think i'll be able to make it.  That's why,  what I have know and what I will have in the future, i owe it all to GOD and my parents who has been very supportive of Daniel and I.

Last Friday, June 13th 03, Dan and I met with our mommies to go look for houses.  We looked at about 4-5 houses but the first one we looked at captured our eyes, heart and our pocket.  It was small but beautiful. We got a towhnouse but the best part of that townhouse is that, it is end unit and beside it is the swimming pool.  We came back with an offer to their agent at around 8:30 am and we finally close the deal at 12:00 a.m.  Man it was so tiring. We didnt expect that we were gonna buy a house at that moment but we couldnt let go of that house. It was just too perfect for me and my honey. So we put in the downpayment and voila...we finally have a house. I am so proud of us because we cant believe we finally bought a house.  I mean, this is what couples always dream about and in our age having our own house is what I call SUCCEEDING. and NOPE, you are wrong! We are not living together yet. Daniel will be living by himself in the house first, then we are going to get married maybe in the next 2-3 years and then plan for our baby =)  It feels so good that we accomplished so much in an early age. What else can we ask for? We have love, house, education, job, loving family, few exceptional good friends, and lots and lots more.  I feel so lucky for having all these.

For the brainless people........
Its funny how people are so judgmental.  Just because I said Im in debt, it doesn't mean its true. Maybe I am just being humble. ahhahaha. I know it never stops, oh well, I believe in karma and your conscience is the only thing that will make u suffer. For your information, Dan and I have our savings and before we bought the house, we paid off our bills, Are you stupid? You think we're gonna go kill ourselves in paying all the mortgages and debts????and plus its none of your business whatever we have right now. hahahah, that proves how little of a brain you have hehe.  The house is ours, it came from our sweat and hardwork and a lil help from our parents.  Just be happy for us ok because we are not getting into your business and be happy for what you have.. JEALOUSY IS BAD!!!!!!

Saturday, we went to Royal York Hotel and watched Lion King for the second time.  It was a tiring night. Charm, June, Dan, and I were playing the drinking number game until 4:00 am and we had to wake up early the next day because we have an appointment with the agent.  So the next day, Sunday, we went to go to the house again, and inspected it.  I was so happy and teary (tears of joy).  Everything is going well as we planned.  After that, we went to the cemetery to visit my uncle and then went straight to Charm's house for the barbecue. We went singing (karaoke) at their house and we were so tired so we went home at around 10:30pm.

Yesterday, we went to the bank to get our deposit for the house, and today, I am so bored and sleepy and grumpy because I cant wait till we decorate the new house.. All the appliances are included and most of our furnitures are coming from our parents ahhahahah.  Plus, Dan and I already have lots of electronics so we dont need to worry about that. Man I am so excited!!!! Can you tell???????????

Friday:  Dan's nephew's birthday. After work, we had to go to his sister's house and celebrate Emmanuel's 2nd birthday.  We had some barbecue and lots and lots of foods!! We were so bloated.  When the kids were asleep, the 3 couples played Taboo. It was so funny!!!! It's girls vs boys hahahah.  (Dee, Mags, and I against Sam, Fern and Dan). I cant believe we ended up going home at 2:30 a.m. in the morning.
Saturday: I had to wake up early because I have to drop off my cousin at the salon to have her hair done while I was shopping for myself heheh. I got myself 3 dresses and they were all pretty. I am very picky when it come to dresses so I was surprise that I picked up three out of four that I tried on.  After that, I was gonna have my nails done but I felt so tired and decided to take a nap at home.  When I woke up it was 5:30 p.m .already. I had to rush rush rush. I had a car wash and then met up with my cousin and her hubby after.  Then we headed to my friend Kristine baby's birthday  party (Karlie).  We stayed there for a bit and got together with old friends.  Then, we went home and watch 2 fast 2 Furious at Colossus. That was a wicked movie. We had lots and lots of fun.  
Sunday, we went to church and went to the mall after. My honey got 2 shoes. I didnt get any because I have tons of shoes.  Then, after that, we went to my cousin's house to go swimming. We went swimming and I was surprise that I finally know how to swim. I cant believe it!!! It was amazing.  My honey knows how to swim too.  It was juss too good to be true. Both of us were already giving up on swimming heheh.  Thank God. Now, we know how to swim! 
Yesterday, work work work again.

QUESTION:
When you do something good to others, what do you get in return????

ANSWER:
A bunch of lies, hatredness, and jealousy.

God was betrayed by one of his disciples, Judas. He learned to forgave him inspite of all the unloyalty and betrayal that Judas did to Him.  But one thing we should all remember, I am not God... I am not who you think I am...., I could be the best friend you could ever have of all time, but once you break that trust, you can never bring the love back =)  Thats just how I am =)  I am NICE but not STUPID. There's a huge difference.

So please stop asking me stupid questions. I answered it all oki doki.... Let me live in peace forever and ever. =p

I slept early on Friday which means, I got a nice rest the whole night and woke up fresh on Saturday morning.. Whooo hoooo! Finally Dan and I got to sleep good, real good.

Saturday, 6:00 p.m. My whole family went to Daniel's house.... His mom invited our whole crew to eat dinner at their house.  It was pretty good. I didnt expect them to stay too long. Man, Charm and June were waiting for us.. But we didnt want to be rude and just leave them there.  Dan's family finally met my dad.  They met my mom long time ago a few times but my dad never seem to get in touch with them because of his work.  Oh well, atleast they finally met each other.  Dan's parents are so funny. They kept on asking us when we are going to get married hehehe.  They really want us to get married so soon ahahha.  After the party, my parents and us, went separate ways.  June and Charm were waiting for us... We went clubbing at Venue, and I am never going back there ever again... Crowd sucks, music sucks, place sucks.

Sunday, As what we usually do, we go to church first and then go out after.  We met up with June and Charm right away.  June was hungry so we decided to go to Kariya, a korean barbecue and Japanese restaurant.  We cooked our own seafood, own korean beef, got our complimentary sex on the beach, and all those korean soup and side dishes....  2 hours after, bill came, we were so shocked to see it... The bill was $150.00.  I mean, that is just some digits but it is not worth it at all. WE didnt even finish the food.  That means, Kariya is also out of our list.  We couldve went to a steakhouse instead of eating there ehhehe.  After our lunch, we decided to go golfing and it was fun, we didnt stay long, it was kinda windy so we decided to leave and watch movie at AMC. We watched The Italian Job and it was a really good movie. It was worth seeing. All of us liked it.  After the movie, we just went home, Daniel stayed for a bit at my house. and then he went home.  OUR WEEKEND COST:  TOO MUCH TO ASK, BUT THE EXPERIENCE IS PRICELESS!!!!

Today, working again...waiting for another weekend...... =("

Also this weekend Dan and I are organizing our very first own business hehehhehe. Its just a small business.. We are going to have a small gift shoppe. You can buy it online, catalogue or personally.  Customers have been asking me when we are going to start, but like what I said earlier on my entries...

Hey! I paid my organ already!! whooo hoo, Fully paid now.... Finally! I have been stressed out because of finding money to pay for that heheheh. Oh well, Problem # 1 solve.  I got my Tax refund yesterday, I am so happy. Just when I needed it, God heard my prayers and money rained down on me..... heheh

I guess it's ok to stay home tommorow since we are goin out in the weekend anyways...and plus my room needs some cleaning...It's been a mess since we moved to that townhouse Grrr...

Anyways, My weekend will be very hectic.....Because my cousin and her bf wants us to do so much things. Usually, me and my honey just stays home or go to the park on the weekend to save some $$$$, but since they want to do something, dan and I end up spending more... Grrrrr!!!!!
For instance, this Friday, my cousin wants to go to Jai Bar downtown... My plan for this Friday is to clean up my room... so I guess that has to be cancelled for now.. Oh well my honey will help me clean anyways.
Then Saturday, we are going to Dan's parents house for our family and their family get-together.. Isnt sweet? Never had that b4.  And then My cousin and Her bf want to go golfing... You know how expensive it would cost to go golfing???? Man.. dont even ask.

A Picture Of Perfection

Paint for me a picture
Let your heart take full command
Use the colors from your palette
To paint two lovers on the sand

Let us act out a love scene
Straight from Romeo & Juliet
We'll pretend to be new lovers
As if we have only just met

Paint for me a heart
Containing both of our names
As we surrender to one another
My heart is yours to claim

Paint for me a rainbow
Across a sky of sapphire blue
And write high up in the heavens
Three words saying 'I love you'

Paint for me a garden
With heavenly fragrances all around
To fill up all of my senses
With every sight and every sound

Paint for me our future
For all eternity our love will shine
I'll give to you my heart
If you promise you'll always be mine

Paint for me perfection
For I now have everything you see
And that picture of perfection
Is standing right in front of me
</center>

*This poem is dedicate to my one and only honey.  You are my picture of perfection. I love you with all my heart.  Although we have some lil downs, you will remain forever my love.  I love you so much!

WEEKEND RECAP:

FRIDAY:  Went to L'attitudes to dye my hair.. still looks the same so people wont even notice that I dyed it again hehe. After that, we went to Dan's friends house to chill and headed to Dicks Bar in Mississauga.  It was ok but not the greatest Friday =)

SATURDAY: Went to my mom's friend's baby christening at Richmond hill...Dan got so much compliments from the people hehehe. Then, we went straight to his house for Barbecue party. Dan's whole family is there.  After that, Dan and I got in a lil argument but managed to work it out after a few hours so we watched a movie.  We watched Bruce Almighty. WE thought it would be better. But I guess its ok.  Not that funny though.  Then had our late night snack at Burger king because theres nothing else open hehe.

SUNDAY:  Very nice day.We went to Church at 1:30 p.m. then went to Square One mall after,. My honey got a tank top and I got a gift for his brother @ Guess. Then, we met up with Charm and her honey and went to play pool at Captain Snooker.  It was ok, Im not really a pool lover... Hmmmm..... Charm and I were just watching the boys hehehhehe.  Then we went to Lakeshore park to get some ice cream. Man, it was a long line up but it was worth it.  We grabbed some banana split and share hehhe.  It was a nice Sunday.

THe month of June will be a hectic month for US... SO much social engagements to go to.  Hmmmm.....  Almost all our Saturdays are booked.. so my friend..if you need some appointment, call me hahahahhaha. just joking...

Were planning for our 2003 Camping already but we dont know whose coming yet. I dont want to be the organizer but I think Im gonna end up to be the organizer again. That sucks.. really sucks... WEre prolly gonna go @ Sand banks around July.. We havent been there thats why we chose that place.

Well.. I dont have anything else to say....
Im bored Im bored Im bored at work.
I wish I could win the lottery so that I dont have to work ever again.. But then I will just keep on dreaming because that is close to impossible heheheh.

Kristen or Jenn???
Good thing Andrew chose Jenn. Kristen have these evil eyes when she's upset. Freaky. I could tell that she will be the man in the relationship. Jenn looks very sweet but I cant think of any Bachelors ending up together.. Only Bachelorette Trista and Ryan ended up together... Hmmm... We'll see what happens next...

Man, its Friday again. I am so happy!  I am going to pick up my contacts today and getting my hair done at L'attitudes... Im gonna dye it blonde again as usual.  I was thinking of getting coloured contact..but i remembered having red eyes when I had them few years ago.. Any suggestions?????

LAS VEGAS RECAP?
I had an amazing trip but It wasnt really a very relaxing trip.. All we did is walk, eat, watch shows... Very expensive.  I love the steak at Circus Circus compared to the one in MGM.  I heard the steak house in Circus Circus is rated # 1.  It was yummy though cant complain.... My honey got pissed bcos I forgot my glasses in the restaurant so we had to go back and get it... What a waste of money (We took the taxi going back). The mall was nice.. Got some LV purse and my honey got a tie... it was sweet.... and also got myself and Christian Dior Dress.... I'll probably wear it at my friend's baby's party... Im so gay hehe.  Anyways, Vegas is AN AMAZING CITY!  Eveybody should experience it!!!"

Few days ago, my mom was reading a Filipino Magazine and then I found out that most of the people I worked with are very popular in the Philippines now.  Katherine ""Katya"" Santos was one of them who used to be a young star and now became a bold star...Damn! she is about my age.  Others are Roderick ""RED"", KEN and GEMMA. These are the people who became popular.

I wonder if I would become a star if I stayed there hahahha. IN MY DREAMS.. but hey who knows hahahahha

Since I started working in this Company, he has been patient enough to drop me off and pick me up at work every single day.  I just tell myself..""Damn! Where can i find a guy like him?""  So today, while driving my beetle at work, I felt like listening to some Love Songs...Man I felt so inlove. ahhahaha. Im so gay, but I am REALLY INLOVE..  Never felt like this before. I think about him constantly eventhough we see each other every single day.

We have done so much.....
From outdoor life---> to the classiest lifestyle.
We just connected in such a beautiful way.
We argue, but we also make up and compromise.
We have differences, but we try to change

THE BACHELOR.........Recap
Andrew got rid of Tina Fabolous and kept Jen and Kiersten for his Final two....
That was very surprising. Especially when he chose Jen first.  I thought He would kept Kiersten and Tina.. But Oh well, I guess He found Jen very decent but yet classy.  Tina, in my opinion, is definitely not inlove with Andrew.  She wasn't emotionally involve.  To prove that, she didn't even cry when she was in the Limo.  Most girls show their emotions right after the elimination.  OH WELPS!"

1-4:30: WORK WORK:
4:30: Pic up my honey and go to the Pet store @ Oakville. Really wanna check out some puppies. Then, go check out the flower shop.  We're prolly gonna check out the mall, I dont know.  On our way home, were gonna rent some movies!!!

SATURDAY: Were gonna go biking @ Lakeshore..Eat some Ice cream....  Just do some outdoor stuff

SUNDAY: ITS My birthday, No plans yet =)

Dan and I were just looking back at our past how everything changed dramatically.  We were talking about our high school life and our friends that we used to hang around with.  It looks like everybody we know are marrying early and having babies right away.  I agree and disagree about teen-age pregnancy. I mean, I love kids.  I would love to have kids right now, but the down-fall is that, If I have a kid, I promised myself that I would have to give my everything to him/her. WHich means..I cannot do what I can do right now..Partying, travelling, etc.  Its not a bad thing to party while having a kid, but I just prefer to take care of my kid rather than leave my kid to baby sitters and party all night long. It doesnt look good and doesnt sound right.  I guess I am not emotionally and physically ready.  Im afraid of commiting myself to a family life.  I still want to go shopping, travelling, partying. Im not sure if you agree with my plans for the future, but I am sure I would like to hear from you ...Tell me your opinion
HERES MY PLAN:
I:  Save and Buy a house
II:  Get married in the Church
III:  Enjoy married life..travel more.....do more!
IV:  Have babies in 1-2 years after marriage
V:  Enjoy family life.

I dont know if this is supposed to be a good or bad news.. My boss said, Im gonna have to come in early and do most of his paper works...... GOOD NEWS???

Last night, I had a weird dream. I dreamt that I had both a puppy and a kitten. I was playing with them and stuff. so now... I want to get a puppy again.  I am not really a cat fanatic. but kittens are cute..  I love puppies.. small breed ones.  I just called Dan, and ask if we could drop by the pet store.. but then I hung up on him before he answered....  I REALLY WANT A PUPPY BADLY..

Dont mind me, I am juss so excited.. Never been to Vegas and I heard so much good stuff about the place.  So yah.. Vegas here we come!!!!!!!!

This summer is probably going to be a biking session for me and my honey... and Charm and her honey.  Dan and I just recently bought an identical bike hahah.. Its so cute... we are riding an exact same bike. Its just that his bike is a lil bit bigger.. I dont know why because it is supposed to be the same size.. Oh well, its the manufacturers fault haha.

May 13, 2003.... Dan, Charm and I are going to learn how to swim.... Isnt that great???? hahahah.  We enrolled already and starting may 13, we are going to take the lessons for half an hour I think..

I know he understands because I never miss an anniversary without a card or a letter heheh. I was just too busy....

Being the person that I am, I went to Square One Shopping mall on Monday, grab an anniversary card..and bought him an Avril Lavigne Concert ticket.. That's right we got it.  I didnt know if he would like Avril Lavigne hahaah but I tried.  I also bought one for my sister bcos shes the number one fan of Avril Lavigne...  I wouldnt dare going to the concert without her because I am sweet like that hahahah. jokes.  But yeah..

"event","Monday morning, I was too excited to go to work since it was my first time driving by myself.  Everything was going well... Until 4:45 p.m. when I heard a very terrible news from my mom.  My Uncle died.  He is very special.  He is one of the nicest person Ive ever met.  I was very close to him since I was a kid.  Until now I can't believe he is gone.  He was pronounced dead on March 31, 2003 in the hospital.  His body will be transported from California to Toronto next week and the viewing will be on Thursday and Friday (April 10 and April 11).  He's still young to be taken away in this world. He is only 42. We had so much plans...  He was gonna meet us in Las Vegas, We were gonna go to Cali for vacation, He's gonna visit us in Canada..etc. It's just isn't fair.  But I guess his mission is done in this world and I am very proud of him. Everybody loved and will always love him.  I am so proud that the hospital unit was named after him. He used to work in that hospital and everybody agreed to name a unit after him.  He really is something.  Maybe God wanted to add another angel in heaven and he chose my uncle.  I miss him so much.  If only I knew, I would've let him know how much I love him and how much he means to me but I guess its too late now.  Please include him in your prayers and I will appreciate it. Now, I am getting better because I know my uncle wouldnt be happy to see us sad.  I know it because I never saw him mad or sad. He always has this angelic smile on his face.

On a brighter side, Daniel has been very supportive to us.  He really is a very nice person.  I drove to work yesterday because I didnt know the weather will be that bad, but late in the afternoon, ice pellets, snow, rain came out so my honey called me twice to tell me that he will go to my work so I could follow him and he could scrape my windows.  Man how sweet is that?

Tommorow is our 2 years anniversary but we cant really celebrate it.  But thats okay because everyday to us is just like our anniversary.  Ive seen how Daniel transformed and I am very happy to see that. I love him so much.

Today, I am going shopping. I am gonna buy the Dawson's creek DVD.
<center><img src=""http://www.futureshop.ca/multimedia/products/regular/dvdm204888.gif""></center>
I love watching it but I always miss an episode.  Ive been looking for that for so long so now it finally came out!!!

Well, I guess dont really have much to say... I just hope my uncle is in peace up there and he's happy.

We miss him so much!"

"event","What a wonderful weekend.. One of the biggest event of my life... hahahah!
Thursday night, I got off at work.....
It's raining.. But that didn't stop me of practicing my reverse parking hehe.

Friday morning, my honey called me.. ""Wake up u lazy butt.. it's time to go and take your driving exam!"" 
Woke up, practiced a lil bit...
1:00 p.m. My heart is pounding.. getting nervous...Man it was freaky...
half hour later, the examiner comes, blah blah blah...
10 minutes after.. Ok park reverse on your right side...  Man.....I was so nervous since I am having a hard time parking reverse. But guess what? God helped me, I made it perfectly! 
..After that, examiner says... Good parking!  But you were having lil problems with blah blah blah, but u pass anyways!
Damn.. I almost hug the examiner because of too much happiness and excitedness...
Hahahha.. I know, I waited too long to take my license. I never felt like I needed to drive.. but as I got older, I realized hey.. Wake up.. you bought a car so drive the car!
Yup thats right I could finally drive my car..! So excited.

After my exam and all that, I went to the mall to look for puppies but the pom poms are gone =(  
I went to almost 5 pet stores and I couldnt find the dog that I like. so we gave up.
After the pet hunting, I called my mom and told her I failed and she was freaking out on me hahahaha.. She got fooled but I finally told her in the end that I passed.
I treated my mom, my sis, my nephew and my honey to go eat at the mall.  =)

SATURDAY:  We ate at Red Lobsters for lunch and I drove my honey to look for weight benches and we finally found one!  At night I picked up my friend Anne and went to play bowling with my friends.. We just ended up drinking.... I didnt want my honey to drive so I drove the whole time.... It felt nice driving for my honey this time hahah.

SUNDAY:  We went to church and then, looked for CD DECK at Future shop... I ended up getting a Sony CD Deck at Best Buy.. My honey was too sweet to buy it for me... Especially knowing it cost him almost $600 bucks... He's the best honey ever!

MONDAY: I am at work and nope I didnt drive to work bcos my honey dont trust me hahah. Maybe next week.. We'll see!


So now what else is missing in my life???????
Hmm lemme see...  N.O.T.H.I.N.G."

Don't u think she's adorable???
<center><img src=""http://www.patsites.com/HeartlandPomeranians/skipperlg.gif""></center>
The one that I found in the pet store is a bit lighter than her though.  She is very cute and small. She is about 5-8 lbs. She is so little and light!!!!  I didnt want to let go of her but she cost too much.. So now I am looking for the breeder. I found one for a reasonable price.  I think I'm gonna get her next week but then I have to see her first before I decide if I should get her!!!!  I fell inlove with her. I am sure you will too!!!!  She was so calm and timid...

What happened to me and Tuesday?????
It's all stupidity and ignorance hahahah.
Remember I had a huge headache?? I thought I was sick but I wasnt.
Here's my story... And I hope you'll learn the lesson too.
During my period, I usually get the biggest cramps of all time, so I take 2 regular tylenols before i get it.  But then on that day, I couldnt find a regular tylenol.. I only found a tylenol codeine.  I didnt know that it has side effects and from what my mom told me I would get the worst headache of all time.  I got everybody worried!! hahaha. But I am ok now.

TOMMOROW is the big day!! I am finally getting my driving test!!! hahahahha. Please pray that I could pass it. I really need to drive =(  PLEASE!!

MY LOVELIFE???  We have our ups and lil downs but we managed to get through it all.  My honey is already planning for our future on how we could buy a house and stuff. I cant believe hes the one who is telling me not to spend so we could buy the house that we want. Very sweet of him to take care of me like that.  I think I got my match, the one that I could continue falling inlove for the rest of my life... Sometimes its hard to find that, you usually fall out of love.. But with him.... I HAVENT AND NEVER CHANGE THE FEELINGS EVER!! I AM SO LOVING THE BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH...

PLANS???????
Our two years anniversary is coming up in approximately 2 weeks...
I already got a gift for him and I know he is so loving it.... I got him the other MOVADO WATCH that he likes.. It was very elegant and classy..
In May, we are going to Vegas for sure!! We already got the tix!!!!!  Were only staying for 3 days though. May 16-May 19
We are staying at LUXOR HOTEL... Here it is..

Saturday, was somewhat a mess but ended up good...
the weather was bad...it snowed, it rained, it was cold.....mudd everywhere, ice everywhere.  Anyways, my story begins..  We started off at Inside Club downtown because that was our first choice.  I called in for the guestlist, we came early so we didnt have to line up. and then when we got there, my friend's boyfriend wasnt allowed because they were wearing khaki pants... Grrr.... But obviously, we have to find another club and we ended up going to The Docks, It wasnt that packed but atleast, we had to have fun with everybody!!!!  Charm and Cathy goin crazy on the floor, dragging me down hahahahha!!! But it was really fun.. I had so much fun!!!!! I got tired early so Dan and I decided to drag them home hahaha bcos nobody wants to go home. We ate some sausage after and It was very yummmy..... Now Im craving for it heheh.

Sunday, didnt do much, just watched a movie and practiced driving..... we watched the Bruce Willis new movie.. I forgot what its called..but I thought it was OK..Didnt like it that much.  After that, Dan and I ate some pansit (filipino noodle), rest and watch t.v. for a bit and then made him and my sister some bagel...

Dan and I are registering for swimming school. hahahah! We dont know how to swim.. We're goin with my cousin and my lil sister this april.. Hopefully, We'll eventually learn.  This will be very funny though... Oh well, we can make fool of ourselves after hahahah!"

Yesterday, after work, my honey and I went home and eat at my house since we had to pick up our pictures at Walmart.  We were about to drop off 2 more films but the lady said we have to wait till the next day to pick it up. So I was like...""What the....It says one hour photo...We are paying for one hour photo charge but we have to get it tommorow,  My honey and I decided to try Blacks. We didnt want to go there at the first place because we thought it is too expensive.  Walmart is really cheap thats what we assumed.. We love taking pictures so $$$ is very important to us.  When we got to Black's we found out that its only a dollar more than walmart to develop a film... but we had to buy a card that cost $20 which I think is worth it since we always develop films...  An hour later, we checked the picture and it was so much better than walmart.  Better quality, better paper.  We're like..""All those years, we were walmart's customer, we were just fooled!! All those long line ups, bad customer service..damn!  Oh well, now we know.

Today, Im goin to pay off my bills.. woo hoo!!!! All of them!!!  My mommy helped me out so I am so thankful!!!! =)

Now, I am just really bored at work! I have no job except updating the data in our system.. Grrr.. I am so damn bored!!!!!!!!"

"event","Here's a scenario....
<i>You and your boyfriend has been together for three years.... You think everything is going smooth and fine..  Your boyfriend comes to your house, and you saw him outside talking to somebody?  And then you felt something was goin on so you go up to him and confronted him.. He said.. ""it was just a friend of mine...The cell phone has bad connection inside the house so I decided to go outside....""  and then You gave him a break... You fell asleep together... suddenly, you wake up and then you played and checked his phone.  and then you found a number that says baby.  You then, checked the number and it wasnt your number.. who may that be???? hmmmm.. you started doubting him... and then you check the text messaging.. and you found some messages in the inbox saying .. ""I love you forever""... ""I am going home now"".... ""I am taking the bus home""....You got so mad, you threw the cell phone and your home phone on him.  Tears fell down you cheeks... Your heart started hurting.  He was shocked, he started crying too.. But then, he wouldnt even let you know the name of the girl...then it made you think again... but then out of love, you just believed in him, you forgave him, and then the girl sent a text message back saying... ""I didnt know you have a girlfriend"" then you felt betrayed again..... you felt like the whole world turned around dramatically. But you cannot do anything.. you still wanted him to stay.. but then he resisted.. so you took his phone to make him stay.. but still.. he resisted.. so you let him go........  and then you called him again.... you said you were sorry eventhough It wasnt your fault... and he said he needed space....but u insisted.  You wanted to be with him and to see him badly but you felt like he doesnt feel the same... So then you gave him the space he wanted....
The next day, you wanted to see the girl, so you went to her work. But instead of seeing her, you saw an old friend... and u asked him question.. and then he said.... Your bf and that girl were intimate... and then you were hurt... you confronted Chalen.. he didnt say anything.. so you said it was over.. but then he left you some text message telling you to have more space because you are bothering him at work...
You said you werent gonna call him.. but you still did.. 
and now you are thinking that an old friend is just lying to you about that... and your bf is making you look stupid.He's playing around you head making you think he wasnt cheating......and then you call your friend and ask for advice but you dont want to hear bad comments and advice.... Hmmmmm is this Love or stupidness?????
</i>
*Well this scenario is real.  I also experienced it in the past.  I wanted to give an advice based on my experience but I felt like I was just hurting her more. I wanted to hurt her so she could open her eyes and realize that he isnt worth it at all. I guess she just needed to be heard but she wasnt really asking for any advice.... It hurts me knowing that she's hurt and experiencing what I went through in the past but I guess I cannot do anything but lend my ears to her.  What do u guys think??? How can you lend a hand to a friend who needs you at this moment?????

-On the other side of my life...........
So excited to go out and celebrate my honey's birthday tonight......
Just me and him alone.......@ Hilton Hotel Niagara falls =)
Were gonna go partying and gambling.. Hopefully we'll win lots of money!!!!
and then after that, we have to go home bcos my mommy is preparing something for him at night.. My mommy loves my honey too......  Were just gonna have some get together party for him on Saturday night.

-Right now, I am just waiting to get off work. Were gonna eat lunch at 1:00 p.m...
SO yah, I'll let you know what happened on my next entry!

4:00-->He picked me up at work for my interview
4:45-->I finished my interview so my honey drove downtown Toronto to eat dinner
5:45-->We finally reached Downtown due to the heavy traffic.  We were walking towards Marche and we saw this huge line up... But we were patient enough and waited.
6:15-->We finally got a table but very unpleasurable one... We asked this Filipina waitress to find us a bigger table.  She was nice enough to put us in a nice place too. It was near the window and plus its a bigger table.
7:05-->We finished eating.
7:10-->We went outside to see what my surprise is
7:20-->We went inside Hummingbird Centre and I asked him where we are goin.. and he said we're gonna watch Swan Lake. We were so close to the stage.  Were in row D so just imagine that.  
10:30-->Show was over, we drove back to Mississauga and bought some coffee at Tim Horton's
11:15-->We got home, I opened my room door.. It was dark cus I havent turned on the lights yet.. I saw the balloon right away.. I glimpsed and I saw this wonderful roses in different colours on a red vase.  It was the nicest flower Ive ever gotten. It was just too perfect..  I hugged him so hard because he made me the happiest girl alive on that day.  He surprised me. I didnt expect that. He actually stopped by my house and leave the flowers in my room...

-Just thinking about all the efforts he did, makes me wanna love him more.  I never thought he would find time to plan and do all those stuff for me. He was amazing. Just imagine him working 5 days a week and seeing me all the rest of his time.. How did he ever find time to plan and get all those stuff for me... He truly is the best...

-Now, this Friday.. Its my turn to surprise him on his birthday.. I planned something really good for him.. I swear he will be surprised!!! He will love my gift..I'll let you guys now what happens next....

-I am so bored at work.. My eyes are hurting like hell because I am friggin staring at the computer from 8-5. Its crazy  =(  

Yesterday, Trista made the choice of choosing Ryan and I think she made the best decision. He almost have everything..... She is so lucky to have him...."

"event","ok well not much to talk about so ill go through all my classes...this shall be fun!

LA(block)- ok just to put it out there, i freakin hate LA. first of all, ms.mitchell is crazy/pshyco(spelling?) and second of all, its freakin boring! we are doing a short story unit where we read all these short stories then write journal entries about them, we also have to find a theme that ties through all of them and write about that and for our final project we have to make a poster board with out partner. its easy but its soooo time consuming! 

Study Skills- i have miss. sands for study skills and i guess its ok. its not as cool as last year where you could just sit around and do nothing. this year we have to plan our whole week then she checks it, she does binder checks and every thursday we have a short lesson and assignment. and to add to it all, every friday we have to write a 2 paragraph essay about the week. actually, study skills sucks.

Gym- gym is so much worse this year. each week we increase our jogging time by a minute. by the end of the year we will be up to 10 minutes. at this moment we are running 6 minutes. o, and instead of having fitness day like once a month, we have it once a week. it sucks so much. other than that its all the same games.

Math- math is math...not much going on there. you know the usual, taking notes then doing homework, nothing exciting.

Science- we are learning about the laws of gravity or whatever. i cant really remember. but we are making roller coaster tracks in class. its really fun. i dont really like mr.mylet though. i dont think he likes me either...or kailee as a matter of fact. maybe its because he sat us right next to each other...did he think we werent going to talk? whatever, i dont care about mr.mylet.

Publications- i dont think mr.miera likes me that much either. maybe its because gabi and i talk too loud and too much. anyway, the articles i have done so far are the students of the month, CSI, America's Next Top Model and now im doing one called the stink bomb dilemma because some crazy kids have been letting off a bunch of stink bombs like in the bathrooms and in peoples lockers and just randomly in the hall. it doesnt really bug me, but i couldnt think of anything else to write...

well that was my day. exciting right? not...anyway, got to go work on homework.

"event","YES! i am finally home! i went to ashland on wednesday. i hate road trip type things. i get car sick so easily and my mom wont let me sit in front and it sucks. its a 5 hour trip down there and we only stopped like once on the way down and up. i slept and listened to music all the down and up. it was pretty boring down there. i was hoping it would be sunny and semi warm but it wasnt. it was really cold. and most of the days i would just hang out in my brothers townhouse and watch CSI, even though i saw all of the episodes i watched. it was like some marathon thing for 5 days from noon to 9. and i would text message julia alot cause she was in arizona. so yeah. anyway, we walked around ashland once or twice. but its so small it only takes like 30 minutes to do it. that was pretty much my spring break. im so happy to be home! i missed my puppy! :-) anyway, tomorrows easter!

HAPPY EASTER EVERYONE!!

Not that high though, it was only 101. anyway, so im staying home today, i dont have a fever anymore but i keep coughing and my head still hurts so my mom made me. My brother came home yesterday. I was so excited! and his roommate (is that spelled with 2 or 1 m's?) john is going to be staying with us tonight, i think. But they are going to a basketball ball game today. well thats about, ill talk to ya later!

YOU'RE HOT AND I WANT YOUR BODY!! hahaha, and kai drinking the water on top of the pool...o and of course, ""this is connor, i love you!"" hahahahaha.

"event","Hey, so this weekend we had a half day thursday and no school friday. well on thursday i did nothing because everyone was busy or grounded, and friday i got grounded so i couldnt do anything...but my mom took me out to lunch and shopping...that was kind of weird. but yesterday (saturday) i finally did something. i went to the mall with julia and karnie. that was really fun. we sat in the apple store for like an hour and a half playing i-spy...and we beat it. haha. then karnie's dad picked us up and we went to elranchitos...IT WAS THE COW! I SWEAR! hahahahaha good times good times. and today we might hang out again and decorate curtains for the downstairs!! its gonna be funnnnn. im gonna go eat babies! yay! (dutch babies) bye"

"event","ok so this weekend was really boring. i did absolutely nothing...it was upsetting. yesterday all i did was clean my room and watch i love the 90's part deux, then today i went to church and i finshed up some homework and now im just watching tv and talking to people online. so bored...so bored...so bored....i really wanted to go to the mall this weekend but everyone was busy with finals and dance competitions and being sick and what not...so no one could do ANYTHING! 

this week is a short week, yay! we have a half day thursday no school friday because of conferences. woot. my conference is on friday at 1:30...yeah but hopefully i'll find something to do next weekend. 

i just finished doing my project for art. miss.jensen gave us a company and we had to come up with a name for it and a slogan and a logo. our company was picking up other peoples dog poop...yeah...our companies name is Your Personal Pooper Scooper and our slogan is we do da doggy doo...i know its lame but whatever. my logo is really lame also, its just a pile of poop getting picked up by a pooper scooper. i know im creative...

well im gonna go continue my day by watching more tv....

GOOD JOB DANCING CATS"

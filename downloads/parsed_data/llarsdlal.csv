"event","So today i ended up going to north jersey with matt and chrissy...it was  good time got to see some old friends and stuff like that...and wait to go hang out again....But on the way up there i was doing some serious thinking in my mind..

I feel like sometimes i have the weight on the world on my shoulders...I dunno why i feel that way..I just feel like so many people look towards me as like a ""leader"" which sucks cuz i always feel like i am letting someone down.. I feel that no matter what i do i can't really show how i feel or whats going through my mind...But maybe i feel this way cuz i take the weight of the world on my shoulders....

I guess it all stems from the fact that no matter what i am doing in my life i am letting my mom down..cuz i didn't trun out the way she wanted me to...and that really sucks....cuz the last thing she said to me was watch out for your dad and your brothers....and thats a lot of persure to put on a 9 yr old kid.....but i guess its like the Eminem song ""Toy Soldiers""....with the line about "" I am the soldier who is never supposed to lose his composure and no one is supposed to know""....


But i digress from this emotional out poor and have to say that all is good went to watch the eagles game yesturday go birds.....beat those damn pats......


But I think thats enough so i am out

Peace Out

but anyway since i have been off i have been able to do tons of writing....maybe i should have listened to my english teach when i was in high school and studied journalism...HAHA...yeah righ tme a journalist thats kind of funny....but anyway...i have actually finished some songs which for the first time in like months i am actually writing good songs..you know the ""i am glad you are in my life songs"" as opposed to the normal "" you broke my heart"" emo stuff that i am used to writing...and i am happy about that...but  i guess you can say its cuz i found my ""muse""....which is something i was lacking before...so its kind of good...

but anyway i digress from the point...man i really wish i could go outside and play in the snow.....:(

"event","So where do i beging i guess i should start with my rambling huh...So i am not one for being like wow i wish i was some body else but sometimes its good to just experience what someone else has or what you can't have or get...not really sure if that makes any sense at all but it does in my head... so in the evolution and never ending cirlce i like to call my life i am getting to that stage where i am not longer wanting to be single..but i looking but not really looking and can't really find anyone that i am intrested in enough to want to be with...But then again i am lying i have but thats a no go on that one cuz she has a man..and yes i am actually not going to try anything...and just let it go and yeah......but enough about that before i think about that way to much and yeah ......

So we moved out of the store and are hoping to be in the other store real real soon... Some times it sucks to be me cuz people are always asking me about work questions and it sucks cuz it makes me not want to hang out with some people cuz thats all they want to know...is it there way of keeping there job?...i just don't know sometimes you know...but whatever....anyway so lets move on to the next idea in my circle....umm ok so i have been thinking about this for awhile now and i can't seem to figure out the answer.....is sex really that good?....don't get me wrong i love it and since i haven't had it in forever i am just wondering lol...just kidding it wouldn't be me if i didn't say one thing sexual in here

But i digress....i really miss my sister i feel like haven't seen in her years and i really need to go visit her and mom...whenever they can make time for me :( thats my sad face for you tara......lol.....

But anyway i am out going to do something play guitar sounds like fun

"event","so where to start...well lets see the last couple of days i've been trying to talk to renee (i probably spelled her name wrong) just so i can get to know her better.. its going ok i guess she is a cool chick.  I'm glad i met her you know...work has been going ok we are getting ready for our big move to the bigger store...THANK GOD......

oh so the weird thing of the week is that last night i ran into tracy...and i know i never have written anything about her so here is a brief over-view....we met one night i was working at the bar..but she had a boy friend so nothing happen..4 months later i run into her again this time no boy friend so we go out a couple of times....but i was had also just met Ali.......so then when i went away this summer we stopped talkign but when i got back we hooked up again and what not...and then you know lies about wanting to be with me and i really liked her.......so after seeing her last night sucked cuz i was like wow i still like this girl and i really wish i didn't see her cuz i was trying to wipe her from my mind.....DAMN....but we haven't talked in like months and she didn't even realize it which was funny..so i say whatever

ok enough with that but that was random though..thursdays suck cuz that means i have no work which means i have to clean this room..

So yesturday at work i was doing something writing and i realized alot and asked tons of questions about myself..

Like when did i lost control of myself...when did i lose myself.......and why don't i just let things happen

but ok this is to serious so i am stoping

but i digress....I MISS MY SISTER AND MY CAMP FAMILY AND NEED TO SEE YOU GUYS

"event","So where do i begin ...New Years was quite interesting....there was more sexual ativity going on then drinking...and still i got none..:(   But it was all good i guess.  I ended up going over chrissy's house..had a blast meet some cool people..had my balls grabbed by a drunken Bryce.....HAHA......but ok thats pretty much it..sad isn't it


Ok so over the last what 2 days i have  been thinking what my new years resolution should be and the only think i can think of is to be happy.. there was so much of last year(like the last 5 of the last 7 months where i wasn't myself or happy at all..I mean i know reason why i wasn't happy and i am not trying to be that way any more...I mean i spent 5 months of a year living a lie to not only myself but other people as well...and it sucks..but whatever i guess ...i mean the only think i can do is fix the problem right?......

So on another note i feel like everyone is leaving me...my best friend joins the army.....and my other friend is leaving soon.....is it me....why do people leave me?

but i digress from my self pitty....so i am getting a new bed and looking for new apartments which is good cuz i need to get out of my house...maybe live bye myself so i can live in a house full of people that actually like me.....LOL

I'll explain..everyone knows my friends mean the world to me...but sometimes i think that some don't really understand or appriate that..but there are ones that do and thats awesome and thats why they are more important then anything...and then theres relationships and we all know how good i am at them....I mean i find myself dating girls that i really sit there and think that i have nothing in common with because i would rather be with them then be alone... I know thats shollow but I will admit it i hate being alone...But yet i haven't found someone that i truely care about in years that i get alone with and could honestly be with and not just stick around with for fun....

Lyric of the Day

Lovely lady, I am at your feet,
Oh, God, I want you so badly.
And I wonder this:
Could tomorrow be so wonderous
As you lay sleeping?

Let's go drive 'til morning comes,
Watch the sunrise and fill our souls up,
And drink some wine 'till we get drunk.
Yeah...

It's crazy, I'm thinking,
Just knowing that the world is round
And here I'm dancing on the ground
Am I right side up or upside down?
And is this real, or am I dreaming?

Lovely lady, let me drink you, please.
Won't spill a drop, no, I promise you
Lying under this spell you cast on me
Each moment the more I love you"

So today i hung out with my dad and we talked about me finally finding a new apartment(thank god).....


But i digress...so today i realized that sometimes thank yous can come from anywhere random....let me explain..so with everything that happen to over the last like 2 weeks or whatever...you would think that my friends would say thank you for helping them realize things right.....well some did.... I forgot to write that on saturday i hung out with katz, rob, joe and katie...and had a blast...there was no like childish behavior which was cool for a change...and people were greetfull and thanked me which i never thought would happen....BUt i am glad it did.


Lyrics of the day..going back to being me and not fake mike

Old pirates, yes, they rob I;
Sold I to the merchant ships,
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit.
But my hand was made strong
By the 'and of the Almighty.
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly.
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom? -
'Cause all I ever have:
Redemption songs;"

"event","So after missing a day of writing stuff I guess I should have alot to say right....Well I don't ....So let me start with whats new....umm so suprisingly I talked to ali the other day and there was no fighting or yelling when it came time to say what was on our minds...she finally apoligized for the way things were done after i tried to let things go....but i dunno something still seems wrong.......But maybe its because i am being extra carefull now...with whats said and how things are done...i mean in my mind i have my thoughts as to why we talked but who knows...........but who knows

So i went to the bar last night and found out that i am not allowed there when anthony is working or just hanging out...which sucks cuz now i gotta go someplace else when my friends hang out there...but its fine i guess it allows me to save my money...which is good cuz then i can get away and move.....and finish my degree....So Kristen leaves me on monday which sucks cuz now i really have no bestfriends left since she will be 3,000 miles away...and i jut don't talk to larry anymore.....but hey it will only make me strong


Maybe i should just end it all together....

But today at work one of the ladies i work with told me something that is going ot stick with me aslong as i live.....""Don't let other people's selfishness ruin...your life""

But i digress....HAHA alright i am done here

Like i hate...feeling like i was the only one that put anything into a friendship

i hate feeling like i am not completly over her or everything involved... but what can you do i guess


But i digress...so i talked to monica yesturday for a little bit it was a little weird cuz she never calls and actually did so i hope i see her this weekend... that would be awesome

Lyrics Of The Day:

Sew this up with threads of reason and regret
So I will not forget. I will not forget
How this felt one year six months ago
I know I cannot forget. I cannot forget

I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that I can share with you"

"event","So have you ever met someone you have so much in common with that its amazing?....But because of time and other circumstances you can't be with that person?

Maybe this is me getting old and looking to far in the future...But sometimes I worry that I am going to be like alone the rest of my life you know?

But I digress(do you sense a pattern forming here)...today is the second day of work so I get to go and look at a computer screen for the next couple of hours...YIPPY SKIPPY.......

Ok so I couldn't figure out what lyric I wanted to put on here from this song so I figured why not all of them.

""Cocoon""

Well based on your smile
I'm betting all of this
Might be over soon
But your bound to win
Cause if I'm betting against you
I think I'd rather lose
But this is all that I have

So please
Take what's left of this heart and use
Please use only what you really need
You know I only have so little
So please
Mend your broken heart and leave

I know it's not your style
I can tell by the way that you move
It's real, real soon
But I'm on your side
And I don't want to be your regret
I'd rather be your cocoon
But this is all that you have

So please
Let me take what's left of your heart and I will use
I swear I'll use only what I need
I know you only have so little 
So please
Let me mend my broken heart and

You said this was all you had
And it's all I need
But blah blah blah
Because it fell apart and
I guess it's all you knew
And all I have
But now we have
Only confused hearts and
I guess all we have 
Is really all we need

So please
Let's take these broken hearts and use
Let's use only what we really need
You know we only have so little
So please
Take these broken hearts and leave"

Well just got done watching the Astros- Cardinals game... GO Houston.  

So after a night where I felt totally like shit about stuff that was done to me..Today has been a complete turn around.  I honestly haven't worried about anything at all.  My friends asked me if I was ok about last night and I am cuz I realize that some people don't deserve to have my friendship.  Which sucks cuz I am going to miss some of the people I met through her.  

But I digress.....Tomorrow start the new job  alittle excited about thats cool.

But on another thing today I told Marissa that I miss her and care about her...Not enough to want to be in a relationship with her(yet) but just so that she knows I still do....which is weird cuz she hasn't said anything back to me since...But its funny cuz she can say how she still cares about me and I am supposed to be fine with it?...maybe its just me..HAHA

But enough about that.. Went out last night and saw Monica who i haven't seen since last year. It sucks that she lives in north jersey and does not go to school here anymore...if she did it would have made my life a million times easier over the last couple of months..But on the plus side we are going to start talking about making plans to hang out...which is awesome

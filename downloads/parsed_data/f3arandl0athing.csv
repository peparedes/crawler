OK, so me and Amanda are right now having a conversation about nuns, and it's rather funny.

 pyroshinobi89 [4:55 PM]:  we should work at the same places...t'would be insanity in its finest most pure form. ...Also known as Amanda.

We have the same idea. o_o

So anyways, school was alright today. Me and Jake were stupid and giggly all day. But last night he and Katie broke up and I felt way bad. Music Theory was fun, I got to be the whistler, because Hannah doesn't have whistling skills.

Well, yarr. School seems like it's going to be el fun this year. xD Me and Kelsey were trying to find out our french names and made Christopher go with Coco Griswald Beaumont LeBeouf. XD I'm going with Rayna, because that sounds like a videogame character, and then Kelsey is probably Chantal again. French rocks everyone. xD"

<P>School has started. Oh joy! Actually, it's not half bad, and i'm actually taking Nick's advice and going in with a positive attitude. I've got all good classes save for Biology, which isn't necisarilly bad, it's just got a few douchebags in it. But all is good. Then i've got S/F, and music theory with Jake-Pants, and Handark. French with Kelsey.&nbsp;Math with Erich and Lindsey. Overall, this should be a good year, and i'm actually quite happy. I'm actually going to have to do extra shit in school this year also (x_x) Mr. Carter basically assaulted me in the hall telling me to do Speech stuff, and I might do it, because it could be fun. Also, my parental units are like ""Swimming for you!!"", and I guess i'm alright with it. :|</P>
<P>Other than school and stuff, I have a few concerts coming up, which is mad awesome. Like i've mentioned sixty five times before, i'm going to see System of a Down, then Slipknot again, and then, HOPEFULLY, Children of Bodom, since they're coming to Chicago! That's the one i'm uber excited about. Amanda said she heard stuff about DeG coming to America! Very cool also.</P>
<P>So.. UM.. yarr. </P>
<P><STRONG>El-Jay update pt. 2</STRONG></P>
<P><EM>I'm warning you now, this is a rant. Please direct yourself away if you don't care. </EM></P>
<P>Alright, so my Dad is already on my case about school. Oh wow. It's Wednesday we started on fucking MONDAY! My Dad also got me a car (Honda Accord, thanks. xD), I mean, that's flipping amazing. But he's already gone off on ""You know that those keys are going away so quick if your grades are bad."" My Mom told me he was in a bad mood, and not to get in arguments with him, but I couldn't help it because he was the one who kept bugging me about it, so I just kind of went ""I KNOW, ALRIGHT!"" and he was like ""Well, if you're going to be like that.."" and I just felt like.. oh, shit. x_x I felt bad, but he shouldn't be on my case about school so soon, I signed up for all these goddamned high track classes so he wouldn't bother me. He also said something like ""I would say I trust you to get good grades, but after last year, I can't say I trust you."" What the hell. </P>
<P><U>End of rant.</U></P>
<P>Well, alright. I'm OK, now! So, anyways. Yay for LJ.</P>

It has consisted of swimming, school hating, and gravel. :D

My Mom woke me up around some time to go swimming, and I was like.. well, fine. So I went swimming and Ryan, Amanda, Sean, and Mimi were all there, we talked for about fifteen minutes, but David called Ryan and they were all going over to Guzzardo's house, EW. I don't do well with that kid. Kelsey punched him once. :) Hah. So Mimi stayed with me, because obviously, she doesn't like him either. Yay for Mimi. Then she left and then we left. Woohoo.

Then we came home, and me and my Fajah went and rented movies (Constantine, Hitch, and the new Crow movie), I drove, and it was sweet. Except for on the way home, you have to drive on this road that isn't in really good condition and there is loose gravel everywhere, and since i'm a speed-demon (xD, no.) I took the turn at 30, which is what I usually do anyways, and I spun out. It was hysterical, and my Dad was laughing at me because I was screaming ""IT WASN'T MY FAULT."" If my Mom would have been in the car, she would have died. xD

Well, i'm done.

Alright, so last night I'm sitting in my room talking to Nick, and all the sudden 6 people enter my house. :| It was weird, and then I guess my Mom went upstairs to see who was up there and there was a half naked kid.. I thought it was damn funny.. but obviously my Mom was just kind of disturbed, and weirded out. xD

So I woke up this morning, and me and Casey kinda planned to go to the south park show together, and swing and have fun and such. I had it all planned out on how I was going to get there, and how I was going to get home, I told my Mom, it was all good. But then she decides that were all going swimming, and I can't go anymore, and I had to call Casey and tell her I couldn't go. :( It was sad, and I didn't like it.

THEN, after swimming, which turned out to be not so bad, Amanda W. wanted me to go over to her house afterwards and hang out with her, Mimi, Sean, Ryan (Omg, yeah. Turns out the kid doesn't hate me. Although i'm having extreme trust issues with him anyways, because he's one of those kids who changes around his friends), Kelsea, and others. I get there, everyone hadn't even shown up, my Mom shows up FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER, and tells me I have to leave. I mean, why the FUCK would you tell me I could go hang out with my friends house for fifteen minutes?! Ugh. Lame.

Both things happened because she doesn't like to give me rides anywhere. :) So, I want a car. Lol. Oh well, gotta deal with it.

So ummmm. Yeah."

I'm extremely bored.

Yesterday was boring as well. Nick came over for dinner. I RENTED THE THIRD HARRY POTTER MOVIE, ONLY BECAUSE I ROCK.

I went to the dentist today, and got more fucking novocaine. Shots make me feel gross. But then he worked on the other side of my mouth with no novocaine, and then I almost died, because he shoved something up my tooth.

I am addicted to ANTM. Adrianne is my idol. xD"

Today was cool, I guess. Really boring. Got an A on my French project, and I was like, holy shit. I got an A, without arguing for it! O_O Mrs. Servis is being forced to resign. HA. I laugh at her plight.

My science grade needs to be up by fucking finals. Or I might die. 

School can reallllly die about now. I hate people who don't even try and get good grades. My Dad is threatening taking my car-like priveledges away when I get my license. x_x Hot damn.

Soo, eh. Sorry for the stupid, pointless update. But, el-jay controls my mind, and I needed to update."

Saturday, I went and saw a movie, and shizz.

Today, I went to the laundrymat, car wash, target, and meijer. Oh joy. 

I also dyed my hair. I'm not sure if I like it or not yet. It's dark brown, my Mom thought it was black and almost shat herself.

But last night wasn't.

It was amazing. Alot of fun stuff happened that I don't exactly want to go into detail about. Nick sang to every song, and like, put my hands in the air. Lol. I tried to sing to everything, but there were a few songs I didn't know, so I just screamed my ass off, and today I had a crap-voice.  But I will tell you that Erich got caught in a mosh pit, and found it hysterical when motherfucker was said. :D

K, so, school wasn't nearly as annoying as it usually is. Everybody was talking about the Slipknot show, either how they were jealous, how they were gonna be there, or how they hoped I would get thrown into a mosh pit. :| Douchebags.

I'm excited, damnit!

So, the busride home was so fucking funny.

Kelsey made me spew pepsi out of my mouth a few times because of her .. genius comments. The first time I spewed, she was like ""AHHH! Lauren's water broke!""

We also had an amazing conversation about what we were doing in college and such. Kelsey's like, zoology and some other kind of major, I was like ""Well, music... writing..."" so she... was like... ""Lauren, you could major in blowjobs. I CAN SEE YOU GIVING SOMEBODY A BLOWJOB WITH A SIGN THAT SAYS 10! ...But... Christi...na... says that you salivate too much."" Or something. I don't know, but it was hysterical. xD

Omfg, and since the Slipknot show is tonight, my Dad called and left a message and was like ""Um. This is ... the convention center.. and.. umm.. well, Slipknot isn't going to show up because they tied themselves up in a knot, and... they couln't.. get out.. just thought i'd tell you that.. bye."" 

WHAT A DOUCHE. xDDD <3

""Underneath your cloooothes.. there's endless mayonnaise."" <-- Twas said on the bus.

That is all. Kthx."

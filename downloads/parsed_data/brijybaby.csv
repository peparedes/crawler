"event","i wil be so karina pomaneg-ish from now on, and refer to my hopeless lovelife case as BIOMAN.


the world is governed by the law of moderation, indeed..

yesterday, our team sa p.e. won the game by a solitary point. yesterday, u.p. lost to la salle by like, what, 12 points? 

last week, i was so full of BIOMAN. this week, i kept away from BIOMAN as much as i can. i dont want the july thing to hapen ol over agen.(though at sum point, sooner or later, im afraid it would.)

paz vega's 'sex and lucia' was as bold as bold can get.. her 'carmen', shown last friday sa fc, was way way less bold, to thnk na it was tagged as 2003 most erotic film of the year sa Europe. i enjoyed sex and lucia, but carmen, nope.

last week was heaven..dis coming week, hell would be closer kasi its exam time again.

i read my past journals kgbe, un s mga notbuk ko simula second year..at i cnt help but laugh at my childishness..der was even one entry wherein i swore to write ung names ni BIOMAN at ni BIOMAN's significant other in blood pag nagtagal sila for a year..
haha..how short-sighted dat vow was! di ko sha ginawa..bka magka-anemia ako..and i was lyk second year pa non.. tpos, der was an entry wer 69/100 disapointed me..pero ngyn, id take it. hapy nko..

naka-chat ko un clasmate kong tga-UPM..comsci sha at nahi2rapan s math17..haynku, im so glad wla pa kong bagsak..di nmn sila supertaas like wat i had in high school.pro okay p nman.."

"event","as i sit here, smoking every cigarette to the last inch, sipping my vanilla frappe, waiting for you, i practise my pathetic honest-to-hell speech i'm gonna give you,about the reasons i refuse to love you any further. 

i have lived 2 perfect quiet years far away from you. now,you've come back, shattering my defenses, crushing every wall that protects me from committing the painful mistake of loving you again. you led me to believe and hope that our past can be brought back, the ghosts of it can be turned into dreams,sweet dreams. with every hug,with the few kisses we have shared, i felt the warmth of it all comforting my cold weary lonely longing-for-love soul. i cant fight the feeling anymore.my defenses are down and i felt that you loved me, too. but u didnt..all of it was a lie.i was made into some plaything.i didnt deserve dat.i did everything i cud to be gud to u.. i didnt deserve dat, but u had the nerve to do that to me..kissing me twice and afterwards telling me that everything was a big fat lie.. i cried wen u said dat.i cried real hot tears which only spring from pain. i dont cry easily, you know that.but i cried for u..for that,i refuse to love you any further.

as you sit beside me now, i find it hard to say the words  i had  been telling the cold chilly air before you came..im just looking at you, fighting back the tears. i did not curse at you or blame you for the sleepless nights you caused, the hurt that has been depressing me all this time. i just smiled at you, a sign that you are forgiven. because i know deep down inside, no matter what you do, i cannot and will never stop loving you.  



P.S.haha..nag on the spot ka nanaman brij..purely fictional though kasi i dont smoke.."

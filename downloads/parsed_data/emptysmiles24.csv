"event","This event has repeted itself but with another person and i couldnt prevent it again.I wasnt there again.....I dont know what to think right now and im so confused inside, but all i know is that i f**king hate him. Im happy that his parents are giving up on him to and that they arent going to help him this time.He needs to change his life on his own, which, so he had to hit rock bottom to do.What amazes me about the whole thing though is that he dosent see that he did soemething wrong.He thought everything would go back to normal again. NOT!I just dont understand his thinking, it confuses me.I knew this whole event was going to happen one day, I just didnt know when.Yesturday was the day, he chose to f**k up his life even more.I never want to see that a-hole again.I dont care what happens to him, after all of this, because i dont give a damn about him.He didnt give a damn about me.I just hope that its all over and Im never going through this again. I will leave and i was promised that there would be no more men living in my house, or my mom moving in with any other guys.I think she said that last time though, so i dotn really know if i believe her or not.I just know that im never going to let myself go through it, I wil leave. If he comes back tom., because they dont convict him, Im gone until he is gone, because i know that i would say something and create even more problems. I cant hold in my emotions and I will tell someone what i think of them.I've givne up on holdign stuff in, because i have been doing it for so long.I just want it to end or chose a different life.Oh well...im in a blank mood right now and really confused on what to think and feel.

I was talking to this one guy today who was telling me that he had to do canterbury tales to and it was hard but he only had to write about a couple tales...which i can understand but for us we got to write about all the stories but 4 of them. I just need sleep and i cant wait for it to be friday...isnt that sad..its only monday...oh well im done...i have homework to do..lol...fun fun...bye bye hope everything is going good for everyone..

BUt he isnt drinking at all when he come home at 1 and 2?...YEA RIGHT.Then everthing was stupid because he was so noisy and broke something?...Then decided to get into an argument with my mom over stupid shit, so i went downstairs to tell him to be quiet cause its 2 and we should all be asleep. I guess I was worng for doing that cause supposivly im a bitch who deserves nothing and I am nothing. OH and also his daughter would beat my ass cause he cant..It was so nice.. NOT...so I dont know whats going on but hopefully the bastard goes ack to his fucking house in florida but i dont even think that his parents want him own there cause he called them at like 3.

She was a sweet person that would do anything to put a smile on someones face, to get that satisfaction of helping people out whenever she could. I hope that she knows that we all care about her and she is with us all in our hearts, but i think that she knows that everyone cares, by the way so many have helped her out. Many people willingly gave up their time to help her out when she needed it cause they knew that she would do it for someone if they asked her. She kept her spirits up and Im happy that she got to pass peacefully in her sleep and didnt have to be hooked up to many machines. I love you grandma and I hope that you are in a better place doing all your favorite things.We will all miss you, because you touched so many people in their life. 7/8/04

In the past week I have noticed that I cant get irritated about the small things in life and jsut stay calm.It going to be hard but its something that i have to change cause its making people mad at me.
I  went to cleveland today and saw my grandparents today.My grandma got smaller and my grandpa is starting to walk a lot slower. I swear that my grandma weighs less than 100 pounds and she looks like she is in a lot of pain. Its not good and its so hard to see her in that much pain and not be able to change it cause there isnt a cure for what she has.
I do have good news in september im going to have my artwork up at cafe momus...lol...that is a dream that i have always wanted to do and i cant believe that its actually going to happen but its great.....HAPPY 4TH TO EVERYONE!..hope everything is going great for all of ya."

And wondering why the world has passed him by 
Hoping that he's bid for more than arguments 
And failed attempts to fly, fly

Have we lost ourselves? 
Somewhere we live inside 
Somewhere we live inside 
We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves?

And whether mice or men have second tries

Things just make me think that things will be ok but in reality it isnt. Im sick of thinking that people are going to change cause I dont see a change. Im sick of being told that everything is going to be ok and that life will be better cause we are going to move on and get out of this lifestyle, but we havent since I was in 6th grade. Im getting sick of it and if it dosent change then I might just have to leave cause this is just to much stress and I cant handle it anymore. I just want to live my life where I can come home and know that there wont be anymore fights. To know that I can go to sleep and know that the only thing that is going to wake me up is my alarm in the morning.oh well"

"event","Life is too stressful.This weekend I went to my grandpas b-day party and it was fun seeing the family and all but it was hard to see my grandma in the condition that she is in.It amazes me how much a person can change in less than 6 months, and there is nothing that can prevent it.I really wish there was cause I cant handle seeing her in the condition that she is in.I feel as though I should be doing something but there isnt anything that I can do but be there for her.I have decided that this week Im going to focus on school work and try to bring up my grades in the next week cause I need to do that. grades are closing soon...not cool...oh well that means that the school year is coming to a closer end.(which is good)I hope that everyone is doing great..:)

"event","Its kind of funny how people only realize that they have a probelm when they hit rock bottom. By this time they have lost everything and realize that they need help but why not before. You said we were the crazy ones, but now you realize that you are wrong. You were wrong about a lot of things. Now its to late, everyone that cares about are too hurt by the things that you have said. They dont want to even talk to you because you called us every name in the book. We are to hurt to take you back, but we do hope one day that you will get that help and not be the person that you were.That going ro rehab will help you see all the things that you did wrong in your life and what you are going to do in life to prevent this from ever happening again. Right now you look for what comes next but there is nothin but blakness, nothing there.You have no where to go, no one to talk to and nothing to do.This might not make sense to anyone but it does to me,. I was just trying write down these thoughts because Im tired of having then in my head and no where to put them."

I happy its over in a way but this whole situtation and basically everything starting the 6th grade is making me realize that i might need to get help. Im not happy and i havent been for awhile, i paint on a smile when im with my friends but really im sad inside.I feel as though im hallow inside with no feelings,lost of words to say. All i can do is sit there with a blank stare as though im stuck a deep thought that im uncapable of coming out of because im stuck.its all catching up to me, all the fighting, late nights, im used to it and i shouldnt be.I feel asthough i could cry, but things will get better cause thats the only place that it can go...oh well i had to get this stuff off my mind..."

I'll never act my age....
but you can tell by the lines in my smile
that i have been around for awhile. So insecurites...
are about as useful as trying
to put the pin back in the grenades

The party is old and univiting
Participants all in black and white
You enter in a pull blown technicolor 
Nothing is the same after tonight.
If the world were to fall apart
I wouldnt change a thing
Now that your here,
Love is a verb
Here in my room
Yes love is a verb
Here in my room.
You wnter and close the door behind you
Now show me the world as seen from the stars
If only the lights would dim a little,
Im wary of the eyes upon my scars

two good songs......"

The stupid things that people do, what were they thinking. Oh well it was thier choice.I just hope that tonight I get more sleep than last night, I had to much crap on my mind, so I couldnt sleep.

They didnt ice the sidewalks so everyone kept slidding on the ice, I felt bad for the people that had to walk.:(

*Just talked to my mom a little bit ago, and it turns out that my grandma isnt doing well and she might go into asssisded living.The ASL is really chnaging her and I just hope that she doesnt end up connected to tubes and millions of machines cause I know that she wouldnt want that.Plus I couldnt see her like that,Im so used to seeing this strong person but now she cant even plug in the toaster.Its sad and worries me, I just hope taht she lives to Memorial weekend cause I want her to be able to see the whole family, even if we all had to go visit her.I dont know what I would do without her, she was the one that taught me how to cook and a lot of other things in life, but I have to keep my head up as eddie would say.What happens, happens its life, but its a life that I dont want.

I have way too many, things that still are in the back of my mind that one day will just leave.I know that wont happen cause Im trying to strive for perfction when that is imposible because no one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes.Im just going to try and lessen the ones that I make.I dunno?All I do know is that things are going to change and Im going to do all the things that I want to do.Well I hope everyone is great.

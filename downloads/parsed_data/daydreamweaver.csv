"event","Just an update to let everyone know what happened with Gabriel.  

If you've seen us lately, you know he's had a bit of a cough for a while--just something he picked up in nursery.  It sounds horrible, but it doesn't really seem to affect him any.  On Thursday night, though, it was heavier than usual and broke up his sleep pretty badly.  Friday morning he was wheezing and breathing pretty rapidly.  We all went out to town, thinking the fresh air and sunshine might do him good, but no joy.  

I called the NHS Direct when we got in, and the guy I got on the phone listened to his breathing while I held my mobile carefully out of mouth range.  Gabe was still in a good mood, but obviously more tired than he should've been, and he hadn't eaten well at lunchtime.  NHS Direct Guy said to ring the out-of-hours surgery, so I did and they rang back about half an hour later giving us an appointment time.

By now it was late afternoon, and Ellen most fabulously agreed to give us a lift, thus guaranteeing that she'd have no evening.  We waited about an hour in a very warm and stuffy building (with a few other adorable kids around for Gabe to 'talk' to) until he was seen by a GP.

At this point, I finally saw some numbers.  His temperature had gone up to 39.1 (that's 102 in Fahrenheit for those who don't speak Celsius) and his breathing was very shallow, about 100 breaths per minute.  The doctor was not happy.  He said we definitely needed to go to hospital, but that we'd try a nebulizer treatment first because the doctors there would ask if we'd tried it.  A nebulizer is a nifty machine that turns liquid medicine into steam so you can inhale it through a mask.  

This was not the easiest thing to get the tired, hot, cranky-ish baby to do.  The medicine was Ventolin (name-brand of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salbutamol"">Salbutamol</a>, which is used for asthma) and smelled vaguely like strawberries.  After about 10-15 minutes of this, Gabe was less wheezy but still too hot and breathing too rapid and too shallow.  We went back to the house to change him and collect Greg, then off to UHW.

Because we'd already been seen by a GP, we skipped A&E and went straight to the Children's Admissions Unit.  It was pretty empty--us, a tiny baby with severe jaundice who was quickly sent up to the Special Care Baby Unit, a 4 year old with pneumonia, and a little girl in a private room.  The nurse had a strong Valleys accent and kept calling Gabriel 'Gabrielle.'  But she was very kind to him, and he was in surprisingly good spirits, just tired.

After a bit of poking and prodding and a second Salbutamol treatment (this one with an ordinary inhaler attached to a spacer with a soft mask on one end), he took a bottle and crashed out for a bit.  While he was asleep, some crazy people came in (ZOMG Coronation Street wannabes!), then wandered off again.  After a bit longer and a second doctor's consult, they decided to admit him for the night, so his blood oxygen levels could be monitored and he could be given more Salbutamol and a course of steroids.

So up to the Ocean Ward we went.  The Children's Hospital for Wales is on the UHW site, but a separate building, very new and very lovely.  We were put in the Octopus room with two other little boys--Archie, who was 6 weeks and had similar breathing problems, and Joshua, who was only a few days old but had very very nasty reflux.  

It was about 9, 9:30 by this point, and Gabe was wide awake and looking at all the REALLY COOL STUFF, like things sticking out of the wall and glowy lights and curtains to pull and machines that go BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP and...yeah.  After a dose of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"">Prednisolone</a> and another breathing treatment, he finally crashed at around 11.  I got to sleep on the cot-that-pulls-out-of-a-cupboard, which was narrow and hard and horrible.  

Neither of us got much rest, but Gabe's breathing was much, much easier.  I was only a couple of feet from him, but I couldn't hear a wheeze.  Many disturbances in the night from beeping or tiny babies needing food or trying to roll over in the too-narrow cot and nearly falling on the floor and dying.  

Around 5am he woke up and started wriggling.  The cot he was in was decent sized, with metal rails to keep him from escaping.  He realised at this point that there was a wire taped to his toe (the blood oxygen monitor), and that the wire trailed up from his leg to another wire plugged into a machine in the wall.  There was a nice solid plastic box where the two wires met, and the machine had a lovely glowy digital readout.

He promply started swinging the wire back and forth so the box would rattle against the <strike>bars of his cage</strike> rails on the cot.  This made the very sensitive blood ox monitor get very cross and start beeping VERY LOUD.  Which woke up the rest of the ward.  Sorry, little guys!  They turned off and disconnected the monitor, and Gabe (who was sounding a little wheezy, but not as bad) dozed off for a bit longer.  

I went down the hall and found him some breakfast.  He was wide awake again by the time I got back.  Both of us were up and dressed by 7am, when he had his next Salbutamol.

We then went to the playroom to hang out for a while so the other folks on the ward could sleep.  There we met a completely batshit crazy Christian lady who was convinced she knew me from somewhere and had been told that Africans and Muslims eat babies.  Sigh.  Escaped as soon as Gabe started getting tired, and he took a nap for about 45 minutes.

Was awake again when Greg got there with food and clothes and caffeine for me, around 9-9:30.  The doctors who had seen him last night came back to check on Gabe (poor bastards with too many bank holiday shifts, but they were lovely) and said his lungs sounded much clearer, so they discharged him with two more doses of Prednisolone for the next couple of days and his inhaler/spacer combo--he gets that around every 4 hours for the next couple days, tailing off as we hear him get better.  They pronounced the incident a viral infection, most likely, but said that several incidents like this one in a single year would probably be defined as asthma.

We didn't get to leave yet, though, because it takes ages for paperwork and drugs to appear in hospitals, so Geff and Holly had time to get ready, drive from their hotel in Bristol, and pick us up with a little bit of wait beforehand.  This afternoon we all went out to lunch, then Gabe and I had a fabulous nap.  He's back in bed now and sounds pretty good.

I feel surprisingly OK.  I need a shower desperately, but will have to wait til morning as everyone else is out watching Wrestlemania.  I didn't freak out at all, going back to my pregnancy and birth mindset of 'I will worry when something horrible happens, but not before.'  I guess some people would probably define the whole incident as 'something horrible,' but because Gabriel was well behaved and cheery throughout, just run-down, and because I could see by the blood ox monitor that he was getting enough air, it just never hit me very hard.

Thank you to all who wished us well or sent good vibes."

"event","Gabriel is 4 weeks old now, and I'm starting to feel more like a human being as well as a mommy.  Some of you have sent cards or lovely presents--thank you so much for thinking of us, especially folks like Molly who I've barely even spoken to in ages!  I will try to send out individual thank yous at some point, but I can't tell you when that will be.  I have such an adorable excuse to procrastinate, now. :-)

Today we went to the Register Office where we got married to get his birth registered and copies of his birth certificate.  They didn't know what we need to do to apply for him to have dual US/UK citizenship, though.  Pester someone US-governmental-like, I'm guessing!

<lj-cut text=""Baby babbles"">
He's still tiny, of course, a bit over 9 pounds now, but he seems so much bigger already.  He's much more alert--though he can't really focus his eyes well, he does try to, instead of just staring through you.  He still hasn't worked out that his hands belong to him, but they do not seem to be attacking him quite as often, and some of their movements are almost deliberate.

He isn't old enough for real toys yet, but he does have interesting things to look at, like <a href=""http://www.iglookids.co.uk/default.aspx?tid=2&cid=5867&size=0&colour=0"">MirrorBaby</a> and MoonBunny (a small stuffed rabbit holding a crescent moon that hangs from one side of the cot), as well as the red bouncy chair with the sea creatures hanging from it and the black-and-white picture books we use as cot bumpers.  

While I started out breast feeding, he's now mostly on formula.  I offer him a boob first thing in the morning, but generally he gets annoyed with the fact that sucking on them requires effort and starts shouting for a bottle instead.  I am a bit disappointed, but would rather not spend the first several weeks of his life arguing the point with him and worrying about whether he is gaining weight--it's just not worth that to me.  I know the statistics and various propaganda say that breastmilk is eleventymillion times better for the both of you, so kindly don't preach.  

I think part of why the change happened so quickly was that I was so very anemic (and may still be, but more on that in a minute) that I didn't have a good supply to begin with, and now that he's lost interest I'm drying up already.  I know I will continue to produce as much as he is willing to eat, though, so hopefully I can continue with breakfast feeds for a while longer.

He still doesn't like water, but seems to have gotten used to sponge baths every other night before bed, so we may try the real bath again at some point.  He is a very messy eater (when he gets lazy, which is often, he lets milk drool out the side of his mouth like a drunk, and it invariably runs past whatever barrier I put in the way to end up in his hair), so he really does need to be bathed often.

He's very good at nighttimes.  He goes to bed anywhere between 7 and 8, and we usually wake him for a feed around 10/11.  He wakes up for more at 2/3, and again at 5/6, then dozes again until the alarm goes off for Greg at 7:45.  He's still not sure what to make of daytime--he seems to be a morning person, staying awake most of the time until around 12/1, when he zonks out for several hours.  

There will be more pictures when I get them developed and scanned, promise.

<lj-cut text-""As for me...(includes potential TMI)"">
The hormones seem to have surrendered, for the most part.  I had a massive surge of 'oh, wow I am incompetent!' this afternoon, but I got over it with a hot bath and some snuggling from my boys.  I am still a bit in shock about the whole thing, and it's still odd to have my days so unstructured, but I'm getting used to it.

Physically, the stitches &c seem to have healed up nicely, and while actual sex isn't an option yet, I at least have my libido back, which makes a great change from being pregnant.  I'm now a 38E or F, depending on the bra, and everything between my torso and my knees is floppy and lumpy and more than a little terrifying.  No idea what I actually weigh, as we don't have a scale (suggestions on where to buy one? Boots only had some of the digital electronic freaky-expensive doom ones when we looked), but my pre-baby clothes don't really fit, with the exception of one pair of jeans.  I bought a new pair today, just to have something to wear other than my black stretchy maternity trousers, and they're a size 22.  I can't say I'm happy about it, but I don't think I'm allowed to diet while breast feeding even a little bit.  Blargh!  

Still, I'm out walking around most days, and walking mostly doesn't hurt.  My knees are still pissed off at me, but not as much as they were the last couple months of being pregnant, so obviously I've lost at least some weight.  I think I'd like to start using the gym at the university, as it's cheap, but first I have to get my ID card renewed. 

Spent my first 24 hours without him at the weekend, going to <lj user=lawyer_laws>' hen shindig in Bristol.  I had 9.5 drinks (thanks to <lj user=zodiacs_cat> for the calculation!) and utterly failed to get drunk.  In spite of this, it was fabulous.

"event","This is the first day I've been able to sit down (relatively) comfortably at the computer chair, so I thought I should say <b>thank you</b> once again for all the congratulations and compliments (and the occassional threat of having Gabriel for breakfast).  Even when the hormones have been miserably wonky, it puts a smile on my face to know that I am not the only person who thinks my baby is a cute baby--there are far too many of you to say so to have all been lying!

I'll put up a locked post about what the birth was actually like, because I'm sure not everyone wants to hear the gory details.  The BabyTMI filter will be in effect on that one, so if you aren't on it but are curious about said gory details, let me know and I'll add you in for this one.  In summary, things took quite a long time to get moving properly, so in the end we needed some help with forceps, and thus I've got some stitches in a rather awkward place.  A blood count afterwards showed my iron levels are dismally low, so I'm on supplements three times a day until they come back into balance.  Gabriel himself showed no ill effects whatever, and although he's been a bit jaundiced the past few days he's looking much less like a carrot now.

Things I have learned so far about being a mommy:

-the epidural is one of the world's greatest inventions.
-that whole 'gravity' thing works on internal organs, too, and it feels WEIRD.
-if you warn the nurses that you have bad veins, they will find attractive young Indian anaesthetists to draw your blood.
-the true and full meaning of the word <i>engorgement</i>, and that there is no use crying over spilt breast milk.
-8 pounds 13 ounces doesn't sound like that much, until it has been resting on your arm for over an hour.
-making other people change nappies is highly entertaining.
-when truly motivated, girls can indeed pee standing up.
-seagulls eating trash can sound exactly like a crying baby when you have not been sleeping for very long.
-when you really need her help, it takes about 3 days for MIL to become annoying even when she's trying not to be.
-even baby-phobic friends will hold the baby at least once.  photographic evidence of this = good.
-walking down the street under your own power (albeit holding yourself up slightly with the pushchair) without feeling like you are going to fall over is AWESOME.
-the universe does not end if you have to give the baby forumula in addition to breast milk, despite what some crazy people may otherwise try to tell you.  
-witch hazel is good, but extra strength ibuprofen is the best OTC medication ever."

Every girl here is named after a flower. Why is yours so plain? 
I don't want to compete with those others girls. The flowers here can hardly be called flowers. Real flowers bloom in the wilderness.

Revenge.

There comes a point when any reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he made a mistake. The truth is... I was never a reasonable man.

"event","I like watching the puddles gather rain.  So where is my rain, bitches?  It does look very promising outside, and both <lj user=ironjawa> and I are having the requisite headache, so here's hoping.

This week, like last week, has been very warm and mostly dull.  I have read many comic books (Kingdom Come and 1602 are both awesome), played much FF4 Advance, and whined a whole lot about being bored.  

Still no baby.

<lj-cut text=""Name meme"">
<b>1. Are you named after anyone? If so, explain.</b>
My middle name, Lee, is also the middle name of my father's brother and one of my mother's sisters.  My first name, once upon a time, was unique. ;-)

<b>2. Do you have your children's names picked out already? If so, is there any significance?</b>
When Newt arrives, he will most likely be <i>Gabriel John</i>--John is the name traditionally given to firstborn sons on my father's side of the family.  Since my father didn't have any sons, I'll be the third of his daughters to carry on the tradition with his grandsons.  

<b>3. If you were born a member of the opposite sex what would your name have been?</b>
John something. *laughs*  Will have to ask my mom at some point.

<b>4. If you could re-name yourself what name would you pick and why?</b>
I wouldn't.  For a while I spelled Lee as Leigh, but then I realised it was stupid and got over it.

<b>5. Are there any mispronunciations/typos that people do w/ your name constantly?</b>
The most common mispronunciation is still Katelyn, which leads to much wailing and gnashing of teeth.  I've seen bazillions of interesting spelling variations, though, and at this point I'm just impressed if someone gets it right on the first try!  Interestingly, I found out this year that there is a Welsh name, Celyn, with roughly the same pronunciation.

"event","I have been pretty bad at updating lately.  Sorry about that.

I don't even have a proper update now.  I just wanted to whinge because I am in the middle of one of those stupid hormonally-motivated flashes of hating everyone and everything for no good reason.  

In case I haven't whinged about this to you before, IT SUCKS.

I had a good day today, except that my backside hates me and I woke up too early.  Got lots of shopping done that I wanted, the weather is lovely, and I have even managed to arrange for groceries to spontaneously appear on my doorstep tomorrow afternoon.

But still, I hate.

Hate hate hate hate hate.

<lj user=keziath>, am I allowed to ask you for professional advice re: pain relief?  Last time I whinged at the doctor or the midwife, they both begged off and said a pharmacist would know better than them.  Will explain more if need be, and if you'd rather not answer questions like that in your downtime, I shall pester whomever works in the co-op pharm on City Road.  

When this goes away, I shall update properly and tell you all the nice things that have been happening the past couple of weeks.

Until then?

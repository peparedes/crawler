Still loving him, seriously doubt i'll ever stop, but oh well, i'll life. he's happy as far as i know. i can be, but right now, he's everyhting to me still, it's hard being away from him for so long, it's like a drug,  you get hooked so easily but then it's so hard to get away from

"event","So I haven't updated in a long time-for those who haven't heard, i'm officially single, but i must admit, i still love the guy-he's great, thank god i can still be friends with him though, i don't know what i'd do if i had to cut him out of my life completely-probably go insane. i'm going to make sure htat i don't lose contact with this one, mainly because it was a mutual feeling, even though i still want to give it another shot, i respect his chose if he doesn't. my friends have all been great through this, they know it isn't one of those things where they say ""oh he was a jerk, you can do so much better"" they say ""you're going to stay friends right?"" which makes me feel alot better because we all know he's a great guy. maybe he just wasn't ready for a relationship, i'm questioning if i was, i'm going to wait till i have a job and have driven more by myself before i try again, that is if/when i get over him. i know i'll never be completely over him, but maybe someday i'll be ready to give it another shot.
i still need to find a way to tell my mom, she never knew anything was wrong, or that either of us were considering breaking up, to be just friends, so there ya go, that's the major problem. i haven't cried, although i have come close i just keep reminding myself that i'm not losing him completely, we're just going to a more casual level. i did/do love him, but i could never say that to him because i wasn't 100% sure, and i dind't want to lead him on in the slightest, but now i'm sure, 110% sure, maybe i'll tell him someday, maybe i'll just let him be as he is. but one thing is for sure, i don't want to let go of a great friend, whether we amount to anything or not, he's a great person and i will never disrespect his decision for this.

thanks to all those who have listened to me, it really helped me realize that i didn't regret anything, and how great of a guy he is, and that i will never forget him."

"event","So a lot has happened, i think i'll start with the party.

So me and my mom are trying to find Katy's house, and it's somewhere where i have no idea and then katy goes and starts walking down the road with her phone. So we get there and i go inside. Nick and Amy G. are already there, Amy G. has a hamster..

So we start to play pool and i won (COOL) then I played against Nick and hit the 8-ball in and lost. Cat came within that time and then she played against me and then i hit the 8-ball in early again. Then within that time Mikey, Chance and Amy S. came, actually i think Chance came before cat came but anywho i hope im not forgetting anyone (Katy, me, Nick, Amy G, Amy S, Mikey, Cat, Chance) i HOPE im not forgetting anyone.

So then me and Mikey played pool, he let me slide by when i hit the 8-ball in twice. Then there was Bohemian Rhapsody, and an attempt to watch Series of Unfortunate Events, and a lot of crazy dance and rythym thanks to Cat and Amy S. And a chase for the cookies, there were hidings and chasings of the cookies. And a little bit of twister before we went outside.

Outside there was Vasketolleyball which lasted about 2 seconds. literally. Then everyone left me for trees and stuff so i took a volleyball and went out to the field there. Let's just say there was some soccer, some volleyball, chasing of the hat, climbed trees, gymnastics, Music playing from a distance where no one could really hear it, spinning, a big fat dog (lol, you have a cool dog katy), volleyballs hitting heads, and poor mikey going into cardia arrest (thanks to the Dr. Amy Dr. Cat Dr. Nick LOL).

then i got a little thirsty so me and katy went to her bar and i got drunk off coke. Then chance came and joined me. I started to hit on the fountain and the giraffes when the rest of the people came in. Then there was some more pool. Then Me, Mikey, Amy S. and Cat had a twister tourney. I was first out each time *sniff* i'll be ok. Though it was fun not getting blackmailed and looking at all the ""suggestive"" positions. Then there was some more pool. Amy S. and cat and mikey locked themselves in rooms and sang songs. THEY TOTALLY MISSED A VERSE IN ""YOUR SONG"" which is really my song. then when everyone left me Amy G. was the only on that CARED that i was all by myself. Then more pool.

Then the unthinkable

Katy Westbrook and I were playing pool, and she was telling me that Cat had just made Cavalettes. And then, i just HAD to say ""Eww Cavalettes are gross!"" loud enough for Cat to hear upset. I hadn't known this at first, and then, in the faint distance i hear Amy S. say ""run tom!! run away!!"" and im all like, HUH? and then i hear and see Cat STORMING AND FLYING down the stairs with death in her eyes, and i run and scream like a little girl, go hide behind Mikey, and then she went easy on me and only PRETENDED to beat me up with a pool stick. *shudders* but she gave me a hug later so its all good.

Then there was an obsession with my phone and my sister calling me, and a great escape, it was a fun(ny) party.

Other things that happened, not so major:
uh, helped with safari thing for VBS at my church? yea i guess i don't have a lot of other things so yea...

"event","so running through the day
i'd been psyced for sadie all week, and do at 3:30 this morning i got up, took a shower, and then went back to bed, making sure my hair was neatly combed and going to be pretty. Then, i woke up at 9:30 and decided i was gunna need more sleep, slept till 10:30. i went upstairs and my mom was making A TON of food, i felt really good healthwise since i'd been sick the entire week. so i cleaned, dusted, worked out things with rides and such. after all this people started coming at 5:30. it made me happy, so then we all laughed our heads off and had a grand old time, ate, etc. so then we had to leave, we got to sadie and we were stuck outside, the morons we all are we didn't wear our coats, so we're all freezing, except nick, he liked the temperature i'm guessing. so then we finally get in, we just stand inside for about 30 minutes trying to find chance and collin, then amy and tom wonder off, next we lost nate, then bethany, which leaves me and nick, so we finally find the rest of the people and steph shows up!! yay steph steph. they had christmas lights as decorations which was totally cool, but they also had other lights on, which was lame, way to bright, so me and steph get up the nerve to talk to store about it, she listed, yay store, so lighting was good. but anyway, they played crappy music, all hip-hop, rap, country, and just crap, only a few good songs, and ONLY 2 SLOW DANCES as far as i know-saide=couple type dance which means MOSTLY SLOW SONGS!! and like the stuff they did play WAS NOT DANCEABLE!! so anyway,me and nick get our pictures taken and get married for the night (can't believe i didn't crack up the entire time) but anyway, so then we get back to the dance, poeple start leaving around 10, and they turn on the lights at 10:45 DANCE ENDED AT 11! why turn on the lights?!?!? but on the upside, since nick was there, i was happy and we had a fairly good time. anyway, so then we all come back to my house, tom killed me in pool, we watched parts of movies on tv, people had to leave early though, so then nate, amy, tom, and nick left at like 1:15 am which was cool, we all wanted to sleep over though, i mean honestly, we're 16 what are we going to do? so anywho, they leave, me and my mom pick up, and it was all ""fun"". everyone said they'd rather have just stayed here instead of going to sadie since sadie was lame. so it's pretty much 2 am and i have to get up in 8 hours to go to church. then i'm going out to eat with my family cause my great aunt helen died on my mom's anniversary which sucks, and the funeral is on monday, so i need to get my homework done when we get back from the dinner, and amy wants to go to the movies, which i'll totally do if nick does and if i am not dead. so i'm gunna go pee and then go to bed, NIGHT PEOPLE! we need to hire a new dj for next year!"

When i got out of the car then my bookbag was open and my book fell out INTO A STREAM GOING DOWN THE HILL! so yeah i got that dried off. then i went and got to my group of friends. You all were awesome to me today, no clue why. But yeah, <FONT color=#009900 size=4><STRONG>i'm guessing nick read my notes</STRONG></FONT> 'caus <FONT color=#990000>he gave me a kiss today</FONT>, for no reason, but i have to admit this, <FONT color=#33cc00 size=6><EM>i got dizzy for like 2 minutes</EM></FONT>. pretty sure i got this really dorky smile on my face and everything. but yeah, went to Pe and played awesome in volleyball. then spanish was pretty good. <FONT color=#666666>Lethiot let me sleep SHE IS A SAINT!</FONT> Then i went to english and was like <FONT color=#ff6600><U><STRONG>""hey i dont' feel liek doing any of this crap and i'm already done with my book so i'm just going to be all like HEY I'M GOING TO THE LIBRARY TO WORK ON MY ENGLISH PAPER!</STRONG></U></FONT> and she let me. i got down there and i'm liek<FONT color=#ff0000> ""CRAP! ALL THE GOOD COMPUTERS ARE TAKEN!""</FONT> because you knwo there was a nice big class in there, then i notice...wait...this is third hour history, and what do you know, nick is right there. so i sit where he can't see me and it was fun. so i typed like a mad woman to get my paper a GOOD start. so then i completely forgot to save it to my disk and it was el poopy! so then i got to chem. I ALSO LOVE SITTLER! she told us she was being lazy today so she was like ""we're just gunna do a short lesson, it'll take 10 minutes tops and then you're free to do whatever"" and so i finished <FONT size=6><U><STRONG>ALL </STRONG></U></FONT>my geometry in chem.Then i have to do to geo. and guess what, she NEVER SHUT UP! gah! i swear that woman has an iron lung! so i got paired up with alex slup. for the worksheets and he kept zoning out which was COMPLETELY! FINE WITH ME because that way he wasnt' asking questions, he's come back to earth in time for me to shove the answers in front of him and he copied one while i did the other and it all worked out great. so then we go to lunch, and <FONT color=#cc33cc>TROM BAILEY!</FONT> (yes you've reclamed your old name) <FONT color=#cc33cc>STOLE MY FOODAGE! </FONT>until i told him what was wrong anyway. so i tell him and he was all like ...wow, so i'm liek yeah biznitch i have a ton of crap and he wanted to knwo so he got it! and i was working on this picture i was drawing that i'm <STRONG><U>STILL</U></STRONG> working on. so then i went into chris's french class and when nick came in <FONT color=#33cc00 size=6>HE DIDN'T IGNORE ME!!! </FONT>i swear he's doing something that's altering his brain cells, or the notes worked. so then i go to my class, we get these wonderful papers to do in the lab. so then after that wonderful class i got to go to keyboarding<FONT color=#ff0000> I CAN NOW TYPE <FONT color=#66cccc>103</FONT> WORDS PER MINUTE! </FONT>yeah my fingers were numb at the end of class, needless to say. so then i went home and was like ok <STRONG><FONT size=7>NAP TIME!</FONT></STRONG> and just zonked out. then i called amy to set up my little dealy with her, then nick called and asked what time we had to be there. and some how i knew it was him before i answered (i was on the phone with no caller id jsut so you all know!)so then mommy dearest woke me up and i ate dinner then changed and went to <FONT color=#ff6600 size=4><STRONG>ONO</STRONG></FONT>. i got there and shared a mirror with amy g. and put my contacts in. Katie Orsini was nuts and was <FONT color=#330033 size=6>NOT ON STAGE FOR HER CUE!</FONT> and we're all gunna kill her for it. so then i was running all over the place and all crazy. but yeah steph saved my life and we had an uh-oh. so we all had a great time, <FONT color=#ff0000 size=5><STRONG>i was called sexy or hott a minimum of 5 times. </STRONG></FONT>no clue why. AND MR. CHANCEY PANTS DID SUCH A FRICKING AWESOME JOB ON THE SOUND AND HE LOST HIS NOTES!!

I'm so tired that i can't fall asleep without putting up a fight with myself. it's impossible to get my temperature up to normal cause i'm so tired that i'm pretty much shutting down. still ready to hurl! I'm pretty sure some people are ashamed to know me. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN WITH ME, DONT' KEEP DODGING AWAY! TELL ME! i still need to talk since no one has had the urge to talk to me, i'm going nuts. i'm really really worried about my grades, friends, my mental state, etc. i know what i want, i knwo what i need, and i know what i have, problem is that none of it adds up! I'm in pain, it's bad when your neck is so sore it hurts to swollow because it requires muscles. Things that would probably mentally scar some people dont' phase me for more than 2 minutes.
Pretty much suicide is weak, it needs to go away forever. It's just so pathetic, ""oh the world is so hard i just can't stand it anymore, no one loves me, no one ever will"" JUST SHUT UP ALREADY there are people out there that have it worse than you! poeple need to just shut up about the ""me me me""s and start looking at what other people need! for god's sake what in hell do we need to do to make you realize what this world needs in order to become the minimum of civilized! I know i've been concerned about me lately, but my friends are tied in with everything i'm worried about! i'm not sure if i need to spend some time alone or just alone with people? i don't know i'm dead tired but no sleeping for katy! no siree! i'm just going to continue ranting or just do whatever"

"event","hey peoples.
So i have a butt load of homework to do tonight but i really dont' feel like doing it. i really feel like i SHOULD BE but i dont' WANT TO! so i'm making this cool looking thing a ma bob. So pretty much I've been so tired lately that i haven't been able to get up, i'm ready to puke at any given moment, i should be working really hard on this project, but i like reading better, and everyone hates me. I'm either annoying, obnoxious or i say stuff that is completely honest but most people dont' liek hearing about (ex. abortion, teen pregnancies, drugs, alcohol, etc.) plus i've been getting really mega peeved lately cause people are ignorant and only care about themselves. so pretty much i need to talk about alot of stuff but a ton of my friends, yeah i just dont' want to keep talking on the same subject, i hate being depressed, other people dont' want to listen, and majority of people i just plain dont' want to talk about this kinda crap with. Drama club is going to save me! seriously, i'm ready to die and drama club is going to save me! cause it's wonderful and i love it! so pretty much i need a good cry WITH my friends cause i need to blurt everything out cause  not even amy g. knows how severly i'm chewing myself up inside for everything! i'm pretty much really worried about nick and curious what's going ot happen. also i found out i don't like throwing parties when it's not warm enough to go outside and just sit there. i can't wait till this summer because then eveyrone will have their lisences! woot woot. i've also been trying to think of everything i do and how i've changed (damn i've changed alot) i hate who i am and loved who i was! why the heck did i change? is it just maturing cause i'm going the wrong way on the roadway of life then! i mean mentally i know i'm mature but then when i talking and messing around everything comes out childish! I HATE IT! i hate alot according to this! but pretty much i've been waiting for one day where i can jsut sleep the whole day, which i knwo isn't going to happen since i want to spend every waking moment with Nick, Amy, Steph, Cat, Amy S., and EVERYONE ELSE! but i dont' want to be in a group, just one on one cause i haven't talked to a ton of them one on one for sooo long it's not even fair! So i had a break down in Amy G's car becuase they started talking about grandparents and then i got to thinking and had a break down! i feel so wimpy cause it's been 9 years and i'm still not over my grandpa. Another thing-i'm perfectly fine with the way i look and EVERYTHING but just the comments some people make just make me feel like i'm worthless, and they know they're doing it! i guess i can't wait for ONO to be over since it's completely cutting into my homework time!certain people are really getting on my nerves that are there! (not naming anyone) i need one spot, not in my house, where i can go and not be disturbed and just sit and think, or cry, or sleep, whatever i need to do! I can't wait till i get my license since then i'll have more of a chance of getting that. I really want to go to the y because i'm subconsiously really really ashamed of myself but i'm still perfectly fien with the way i look. I'm really comfused as to what some people's opinions of me are. i'd rather someone be rude and tell me brutally what they think of me then to not say anythign and torture me with not knowing what they think. 

PEOPLE YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHAT YOU DONT' LIKE ABOUT ME, WHAT ANNOYS YOU, AND WHAT'S GETTING OLD! I CAN'T CHANGE IT UNLESS YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON IN  YOUR BRAINS!

so pretty much i miss the old days when we could all just sit under a blanket and look up at the stars. i've still never seen a shooting star. I really need to talk to nick and amy especially but no, they're sleeping! so pretty much i'm going to right amy a note, and try to figure out what i'm going to say to everyone else when they ask what's wrong cause i don't think i'm going to be pretending tomorrow. just cause a ton of people piss me off!"

So I woke up today at 10:30 (yay) and just layed there for about 10-20 minutes waking up fully, then I got out of bed, did my chores that only took like 20 minutes (yay free day!). Then I called ABI's house but nooo SHE WAS STILL SLEEPING! So I started watching home movies (haha only got through one). I love my family, we're all so weird. So then finally at 1 I called ABI's house again, she was still sleeping, so I persuaded her brother to wake her up for me. YAY GREG!So then she was pretty much threatening to kill me and I was really hyper so I'm pretty sure she was going to kill me! Then at 3-ish Nick came over and we had fun. He stole my phone so I remember I had it set on vibrate, so of course I went and called it, it was funny. Then ABI and some unknown person called. Nick answered ABI's call but freaked her out a bit. Then we had dinner with my mom, brother, Marita, Sarah, and Mr. Arter. After dinner Mr. Nick and I watched a TON of other home movies I've never seen before. Wish I had reviewed this one first......ANYWAY! so yeah, we saw my parents' wedding, this one Christmas where my brother almost killed me...on many accounts. I almost started crying because my grandpa was there (I miss him a lot...)Anyway, then we watched like an hour of my brother as a baby...good times matthew good times, before I was born! Then Nick had to go home so we said goodbye AND I GOT MY PHONE BACK! So he went home and I called ABI at 10:12, her mom was ready to kill me then. OH I'M JUST SO LOVED! so we talked until about midnight, yeah we're loved! And now here I am. Now I'm going to bed"

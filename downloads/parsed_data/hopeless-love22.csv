"event","i think i may have had the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">worst</span> dream of my entire life. i'm going to tell it on here so if you would like to know it continue reading, if not, i'm sure you have a million other friends who have livejournal. 

<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">INTRO</span>: i have been having this weird dream about a house that kills people. I have no clue where exactly this house is but i know that i have been there before (in my dream) and it's not a pretty place. the house is a complete disaster, papers all over the floor, furniture all scratched up, birds and flies everywhere. 

<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">DREAM</span>: well, for Mike Brand's last retreat, he decides to get a huge youth confrence going at this huge warehouse looking thing called the ""Dome of God."" well since i was the only one who knew the surroundings, i noticed the house that kills people. not only did i notice it, i saw it, i had been inside of it, i knew what it did, and i was petrified of it. well we got to the ""dome of God"" around sunset (which means it was pretty dark outside) and Mike told us not to wander off because it was cold outside and the georgia bulldogs were playing on the only tv that worked in the dome. Well, a whole bunch of youth from our church decide they want to take walks, and others decide to just walk alone, some decide to play retarded games. I felt like sleeping and just forgetting where i was and i prayed that nothing would happen to any of us while we were there. Well, Kirk comes in to the cabin to tell me that he is going to take a walk to loosen his legs up and that he will be back in a while. I threw him my huge mac flashlight and told him to be careful and for the first time i told him i loved him. well, i wake up at around 10 and notice that everyone is in the dome and waiting for a few other people from their church. i walked over to where our church was sitting and since our chairs had names on them, i rigged it to where i was sitting next to Kirk. well Kirk wasn't in his seat. i looked around the room to see if maybe he had been helping with the computer and stuff like that but he wasn't anywhere in the room. I asked Mike if he had seen him and he said not since we had gotten here and all splitten up. Naturally, i begin to worry and go out into the dark by myself looking and screaming for Kirk. I walked back to the back of the warehouse and think twice about going to that house. i figured, well if it was me, he would do the same thing, so i walked back towards the house. i got to the side of the house and noticed a light on that had never been on before. ( i had tried before in a different dream to see if it worked) i breathed a sigh of relief and thought, well good, he's okay, he's in there probably watching law and order or something. well i go in the house, and low and behold it's still the same as it was every other time i had gone in there. the inside was pitch black, there were things thrown all over the floor, birds and flies everywhere. I started screaming Kirk's name at the top of my lungs only to hear the sound of flies and birds feathers in the air. I got no response out of kirk so i ran through the house and finally found him. he was face down in one of the bedrooms with a knife in his back (sorry kirk, that's the way the dream went). i screamed and screamed and then ran out of the house. i got back  with the youth in the dome and ran right to Mike, who was talking on stage to over 300 youth, and told him about Kirk. at first he thought i was just kidding and he told me to calm down and sit down. i told him i was serious and he needed to go call the police. he refused to listen so i screamed to everyone in the dome that they needed to call the police becuase someone was just killed. everyone started flipping out and screaming and all that, and all i could do was cry and mike came up to me and asked me what in the world was wrong with me. I told him very quietly that kirk was dead, and i had lost the love of my life. needless to say, we still had the conference, and our church had decided to be the host of this conference, so boyfriend dead or not, i had to get on that stage and do what i had practiced. i was in tears crying all night long, and i seemed to be the only one who was actually upset. well we left that following morning due to everyone's knowing that someone had died. I cried for hours on the way back home, it seemed to have taken forever. all i could think about was how much i wish i had meant i love you when i said it to him the previous night. usually i say be careful, but that night i didn't. i suppose that was my fault. 

<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">POSTSCRIPT</span>: i woke up at 11 am this morning  and called Kirk to make 100% that he was okay. good news folks, he's okay. this dream is by far the scariest i have had since like the 4th grade... oh well, it's okay, Kirk's okay and some more good news. i really do love him. 

<br><br>THANKS FOR READING THIS!!<br>KIRK, I'M SORRY FOR YOU DYING IN MY DREAM!!<br>"

"event","Last night, I had the best time I think I have ever had in about 6 months. I was over at one of my good friends house and we watched a number of movies. The one that meant the most of The Exorcism of Emily Rose. It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be but it was creepy none the less. Anyways.. I have this semi-not really a pimple pimple on my tip of my nose and it was irritating the crap out of me..so I went to just rub it and my hand became held in someone elses. Since I didn't really think anything of it..I just picked up the other hand rubbed my nose again, and my hand was found in his. Our hands pretty much stayed together until we finished watching CSI..which by the way, we both love. :)

I haven't felt this special in a long time, and quite frankly, I don't want to lose that feeling.. .:shrug:. maybe this one's different. I dunno, but I'm excited..

not sure how exactly to start this change but i know i need to.
I NEED TO..
not want to not if it happens but I NEED TO!!!!

please encourage me.....if you see me upset or pissed for some little insignificant reason, please please please please please stop me and tell me. i don't want you to think that i will blow up in your face. i really need this for myself. i can't keep going on like this. i need change.. bad..

"event","so where the crap do i begin? I don't know what is going on in my life anymore. I mean all of my faith and trust and hope is in God and some things just aren't getting taken care of. Most of the things I am having trouble with are working out just fine and others not so fine. Like the whole living situation: I know that I am living with Ephriam's parents and that he is their son. That is fine, I just don't like being told that this is ""home"" and I don't have to go anywhere and then 2 months later I have to find somewhere to live. I understand the situation and it's not that bad. I have actually had a couple of offers to go stay other places and to be honest they aren't that bad. 2ndly, the whole school thing: I am scared that if I go into this year with high hopes they will be shot down like normally. Oh and 3rdly: I want the relationship that I had with my BEST FRIEND to be the way it was in 9th and 10th grade.. (you know who you are).. and last but certainly not least.. my mother: she is still in Iraq and things are stirring up a bit over there again. I don't want anything bad to happen to her, and even though I don't talk to her as much as I should, I still care about her more than anything in the world. SHE IS MY HERO

Okay well now that everyone knows my life problems...I have been going to a church in Bloomingdale for the past 2 months. This church is the most warm feeling church next to FBC of Springfield. I went there only know a few people and over the course of the 2 months I met atleast 50 more great people. I even found out that I have a secret admirer who really isn't a secret at all. I knew it was him but I played blonde! :D But I truly found God at this church and just because it's on the other side of Effingham/Chatam county I still want to go regularly..which means I need to quit foolin around and get my lisence...ASAP!! But no worries there because I know God will handle it all for me.

Well this is by far the most I have ever written on LJ and I do believe it's time for me to go now. I just wanted to give everyone a heads up on the brown girls life and how it's goin! :D So there ya go!! <3"

"event","today at school sucked big dick. Everyone was really pissing me off. I dont understand why i cant walk down the hall, or pass someone i know without them pushing me touching me. It gets really fucking old. On another note, last night at caseys was lots of fun, i discovered that i had jandus, it is sexy. Note to any of my friends that go to my school, STOP fucking touching me god dammit, for christs sakes            i AM going to start punching everyone who touches me, besides alex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           good bye all"

"event","so jennifer holwick obviously fucking hates me, seeing as how she said she would call me back and didnt, and when i called her she had someone answer her phone and say i had the wrong number, so i geuss i lost a friend, or what i thought was a friend. For what reason, I have no fucking clue. It really makes me want to die. If she doesnt like me i wish she would just tell me instead of fucing igonoring me, I mean FUCK, maybe i should just give up and stay at home all of the fucking time. That sounds like a damn good idea, at least then i wouldnt be hanging out with people i think are my friends but they obviously hate me.It is really shitty but, what do i do? i geuss from now on i will stay home and not call anyone, maybe they would all be fucking happier then! oh well i am gonna go die now, seeing as how it seems that is what everyone wants                                goodbye all"

Last night she was mad at me and it bugged me more thatn anything had ever bugged me, it was interesting. It made me realize how important she is to me. I also realized today how much i enjoy Scott Phillips, I have never enjoyed someone that much next to ashleigh and dieana, and chris. I had a very god day today it was interesting because i had the moxt fun i have ever had in a long time and it amazed me becasue it started off as a shitty day, and turned into a beautiful evenescence of glory and happiness.

After that as we were driving there was some random dumb fuck shooting off artillary shells so i ran over the tube that you shoot them off with(i think i pissed him off a slight bit).then we was driving through the hood of gardner(Pinewood)and there was a grandmother walker, so dieana gets the bright idea to get out and steal it. And i was like fuck that that is gay(so we got out and stole it) he worlds biggest trailer park(Conestoga) and fucked with people.

"event","me and dieAna were driving down the lake and we saw a car, we thought it was Anthony Douglas. 
so we followed it
 but after following them for like 10 minutes it was this guy Joey Daily
 we decided to follow randoms in TWO cars
 that shit is the coolest
 so we followed some van
 not to much fun
but then we saw a camero
 OH BUDDY
they caught on quick and were turning down all sorts of streets and shit
as it turns out it was Sheena Richarson and Carley Donavan
they got out like they were going to bitch at us so we drove off quick
 she followed joey and me and dieAna went into a drive way
 then we followed Joeyso she was in the middle of us
 then we went into another ""hood"" and joey stopped at a stop sign so she stopped next to him and bitched at Joey
 then we rolled up next to him and was talkin for a while about what she said and then she turned around and tried to hit us but she is a moron and that shit isnt happening after all that it was 11 and I had to be home 


BUT

"event","today i went to school and it sucked huge ass.  i got yelled at 3 times for stupid shit i didnt even do. it is a bunch of crap.but what the hell, it gave me a good reason to yell at all of the teachers i fucking hate. so it was totally worth it.  dieana also loves the pizza flavored pringles and the crisps, it is hellarious because she refuses to admit her passions for the products of price chopper, the only real store in gardner. after all of the drama we went to this one girls house to get pie and she lied about making that and on top of it all she lied about getting in a fight and got me and dave excited and then pussied out.what a loser. i am now talking to the cake eating monster(dieAna) and she is deinying my love for him           not bam           so i got to go kick her ass bye bye        i love u all except cory       a merry christmas to all and to all a good night."

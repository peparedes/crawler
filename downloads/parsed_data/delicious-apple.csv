"event","Fortune telling and tarot reading in HK left me with nothing, but fears and worries. 
I doubt I mentioned that wendy and I went to Temple Street in HK for fortune and tarot reading, right? 
Perhaps I will just say a little on what those readings said. 

Fortune Telling 
I will get married between 28 to 30 years old. 

Tarot Reading ( It is a 6 months reading.) 
I will be with someone but it has a 3 to 4 months unknown period which there will be no contact. It is a triangle relationship which seems there, yet not there. Everything is full of uncertainy. It will end anyway, and I will get together with an unexpected person who is my friend. Future unknown. 

I do not want to get married, like duh! It is stupid and idiotic to get married, and get hurt after years. 
Triangle relationship? How can I get into this kind of thing? I dislikes being uncertained.&nbsp; 
The worst thing is to get together with a friend. What if it ended? Does that mean the friendship ended too? 
OMG! Can I just hide at home and not go through any of it? 

I definitely think that I am so gonna lose my hair, just to think of all these."

Perhaps that is happiness to the ultimate simplicity. <br />I remember it was just three of us at MacRitchie Reservoir. <br />From the pictures we took, I was wearing a little skirt happily taking pictures with my mum. <br />I never understand till today. <br />The smile is an evidence of how secure I was feeling with my mum beside me. <br />From young, I always know that things would not be too bad as long as I have my mum with me. <br />Even when our house was hounded by loansharks because my father borrowed from them and disappeared. <br />She hugged the young shivering xiu xian. <br />She,&nbsp;a woman confronted the loansharks bravely, leaving them nothing to much to comment but a sentence. <br />""you are a brave woman daring enough to confront us, but you have got a coward as your husband."" <br /></div><br />Actually intended to talk about my feeling for the coming 21th I will be, but it just goes out of track. <br />Confusion in my mind, I do not wish to be 21 years old. <br />I know that the older I become, my mum would be older as well. <br />Dislike her saying that we will get the money once she die, and we will have the house as well. <br />Ultimately the day when&nbsp;I become 21 will still come, there is nothing I can do. <br /><br />..........."

"event","<p>A tiring day from work.<br />I had called people from China, Taipei, Toyko, KL, Singapore etc. to chase for some trade exchange confirmations.<br />With English mixed with japanese and English mixed with mandarin, I finally managed to clear some of the confirmations.<br />Now I see my satisfaction. From a whole list of so many banks which I have to call, until I highlighted and added comments to those which I have called, satisfaction is still priceless. Besides, this is learning about exchange trades and communicating with people from different countries, thou their accents are really difficult to understand.<br />Enuff about work...

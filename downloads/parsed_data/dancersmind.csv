"event","So a few weeks now i have been noticing my moods becoming extremely erratic. My life has been a challenge to say the least. I have been thinking that a way that i processed before was by writing my thoughts down. It really was a way that i could reflect and decide on changes. 

I really unhappy to say that in my short life i have experienced more then i would have liked to. Sometimes i find myself thinking about ending it all. Thinking half of these things are not worth it. What i really want is a refresh a restart. I want to be able to turn this life off and come back as something different. 

2013-

going backwards

I went to DC with jenny to visit katie. Should moved there about a year ago now. It was a lot of fun. we stayed at her parents house and then a night in the city. I like when that i friends in other states as an excuse to travel and spend time with them.

I had a lumpectomy in my left breast on Sept. 17th. I had been dreading this procedure since i was told i had fibroadenomas in 2011. it seemed like it would not have to surgery 2 years ago but i had a really bad feeling. It seemed that one continued to grow and growing quickly. I had a biopsy in 2012, October 5th to be exact. It all came back fine but from october to may it continued to grew about 2 more cm. for a total of 4.8cm by 3.5 or cm. So the fear was could it be a phyllodes tumor. Well in the end it wasn&#39;t. But preparing for it all was emotionally draining and it felt like no one could understand. I didnt want to hear it has to be done, or its for the best.

once i woke up from surgery i cried. i couldn&#39;t reverse time. i couldnt undo what happened. and the fact that it needed to happen. and the potential damage it could cause. Surgeries could damage my ducts so i wont be able to breast feed if i chose to have kids. 
During the entire process doctors where repeatedly saying &quot;oh your so young you shouldnt be going through this&quot; -_- these statements did not make me feel good about myself.  

But it is over and my scar is healing. I still feel pain occasionally. The one thing i must say the pain pills felt amazing.. and i should be embarrassed to say but sorry not sorry. 


Continuing... 

Jenny asked me to be her maid of honor this past may or june... &nbsp;( i should say first that she got engaged in march!) Very excited that i am chosen to spend this special time with her. My friends are my family and it means the world to me. 


My birthday... My 24th birthday. So many things i wish i could have done before 24. so many things i wish i could do before 25... 

I went to Disney with robert for our 3rd anniversary. We ate and drank around the world at Epcot. It is crazy to think that so much time has past. Up and downs. Sometimes i am surprised we are still together. I am not the easiest to deal with especially with all these factors in my life i am not happy with. Slipping into comfort zones and watching others act on their impulses. I have def. allowed robert to be the excuse for not acting on what i want.
But nonetheless i am happy we are together. He is in grad school. that was a big deal. we never talked about it. another day another story. 

SO far that is all i remember.

IN a few days we will be thrown into yet another year, another age, and more choices, mistakes and hopefully happiness to experience.&nbsp;"

"event","it always ends up being months before i write in this. So much happens and i dont record it. I usually remember when i am at work but that doesn't seem like an appropriate time to write down extremely personal happenings. 


So on the 10th i went to the doctor. After so about 2 months of stressing on which doctor to pick i have finally picked one. I went and i love her she seems really awesome. I found out that i have a heart murmur and that i need to go for testing to check how much it will affect my life. and the routine blood work was issued. I&nbsp;have to get an xray of my back to make sure the chronic pain is not something more severe and i have also received a prescription for birth control. 


this should b interesting. 

it would be just my luck the pharmacy would loose my prescription and i had to&nbsp; call the doctor to call the pharmacy. but she again is pretty awesom and did it. though i hope i didnt piss her off. .... :(


anyways. i am still in lovvvveee with robert. we have recently have really been looking/ talking about living together. thats kinda scary. 


oh and i finished tufting my head board so i need to get my bedroom set and etc. 


:) 


happy times. 


my work life and stuff with my mom is till not the best situation, it could always be better. but yea what can you do. life can never end up being perfect. 

laters. write in like 2 months.... ::fail::&nbsp;"

"event","so yesterday was Christmas and honestly....i&nbsp; was a sour puss. i just hate the fact that my family cant manage to get together, they basically don't exist&nbsp; i dont think its fair. all i want is for the traditions we used to have live on.... but that is not the case. its just me and mom. :( 

so i wasn't really excited for anything. if i could i would have just loved to sleep the whole day through.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

But i was pleasantly surprised with the gifts i revived. My mom gave me a night gown/robe set and money to fund my euro trip for next yr. It's nice too see that she wants me to see the world.

Robert: was a really nice surprise. He gave me a KINDLE! :) so excited.&nbsp; its so weird. it looks like paper it def doesnt look like a screen. tomorrow i have to call and set it up cause its not connecting to my home wifi.... sadly i dont know why. 

He really is the most amazing person i have ever met. i love him so dearly. i really just want to be happy with him for a very very long time. ;D 
I bought him a really fancy watch. it had Swarovski crystals in it. elegant but not overly done. I am really happy he liked it. as soon as i take a picture i am going to post it. i love that watch. i really do hope our gifts compare. I wanna make him as happy as he makes me. 


I&nbsp;gave myself a 6 quart kitchen aid mixer. FINALLY! i should have done this long time ago. cant wait to use it. ;)

co workers gave me white chocolate peanut butter, a tea pot (very pretty) and an amazing scented candle. 

I&nbsp;feel like maybe i should try harder to make an effort on Christmas. Its just so defeating and easier to run away from my feelings and shut out everyone that harms me."

Now the real question am i ready to make that happen because clearly anything i say that will happen in my life will. <br /><br />and i am not 23 yet. i said i would at least at the VERY least be in the process of opening my own bakery when i reached the age of 23.... i just turned 21 and now i need to figure out how to get there. I&nbsp;need the make sure i have the option and the knowledge how to do what i need to do. and let me choose to postpone or go in a different direction. <br /><br />I said i would decide to go to euro again in november.... its november. every goal money wise i reached. so technically this reached amount is already giving me the ok to go on this adventure with no problems.... its my choice to jump or stay cautious. <br /><br />i get no where being cautious....... <br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","so lately i must say that i have not been enjoying my life very much. Stressed trying to figure out my next move, feeling like i am too good for my job, tired of not utilizing my degree. Just everything not falling into place as it should. This driven person that i am and i couldnt get it together. 

But i have since calmed down and decided to stop fighting the system for the time being. All i can think now is how to over come it in future time. I have to arm myself correctly..... And to be honest i am kinda scared. 


I keep thinking that i will fail, i wont have support, what if what i am robert want are different. or what if i cant separate my love for him and my love for ambition..... 


Well that is all i want to say at the moment."

Its so weird letting this feeling consume me. from the moment i wake up to the moment i sleep thats all i think about. i just wanna get to know him more, and bring him into my world. but its also hard cause i cant see the future. so that empty view is annoying yet then again i see traveling and i dont see how this could end. i dono its like a fear, yet i am so excited to pay attention.

"event","I am having the feeling of the need to over achieve... i am happy that my break is going well and i am nearing the end of this break and i think i allotted the correct amount of time to take this break. I said i would relax and step back and reevaluate my life. Though i have not succeeded in figuring what i really want to do yet. But i can say that i am ready to start working and being paid and being told what to do and proving to people that i am the best of the best in everything and anything someone hands me. I think my physical and mental state is in a healthier and rather calmer state at the moment. So with the lack of stress from school and sorority life i feel like maybe i can handle the responsibility of a paying job. 

SO many things are about to happen i feel. And i really have got to stay focused and put myself into the equation. I notice that i am falling back into my old habbits. I need to get out of comfort zone and do the impossible! my impossible. 

Well my euro trip is coming up on the 13 of march. I got my passport today. And i have been slowly but surely packing my things. So excited."

"event","So hopefully thru the year i will be able to update positively about my progress trying to do new things and overall do me. 

I have noticed that i have made it through the first month pretty well... but the shininess of this goal is wearing off a little, and is becoming harder and harder to remember that i made this commitment to myself. I feel like i am starting to put other people first again.... and pretend to give a shit.

I need to actively tell myself that i am ok doing things on my own, and nothing bad will happen because i dont have company. I am mildly disappointed in myself because i didnt go do my passport pictures alone cause think about doing it alone was giving me anxiety... so its okay... i had a minor relapse. I did get them done regardless.. but i did manage to renew my passport alone....so 1 step back 2 steps forward.... i think lol

Today, i did fall into my boredom routine, and then of course that goes back to feeling lonely, then feeling abandoned and then its a bad down hill fast spiral. I think this is the first time i felt this way this year. Not doing anything and nothing worth watching on tv was just bad. I did clean... but it wasnt fulfilling. 

No just kidding... i have felt this feeling... some time last week... oh no... this is bad progress... it was a feeling of emptiness... a little different then today. but nonetheless just as destructive to my progress. 

again 1 step back.... and trying to find that thing that will give me those 2 steps forward. 

In due time. 

I am happy with my progress tho. :)"

Its so crazy. after the first night of practice i thought this pole thing was hard and i was kinda loosing hope. I completely overestimated my strength. I was kinda thinking of how my old body use to b when i danced every single day and went to the gym and did minor weight lifting there. But the good thing about is that i am competitive/ambitious and i refuse to sell my self short and not succeed at the things i want to do. SO i convinced myself that i was doing fine.... and NOW i really am doing good. I am not in any pain after practice anymore. OMG! so excited! ;)

sadly life, you dont really ever respond. I come up with this infatuation all in my head... like most of the boy infatuations i have. (lOL)you dont really comfort me and stay by myside and hug me when i am sad or when i am lonely. Life, you remind me of a boy.

"event","So i dont usually make a new years resolution. Most of the time i just wish to be happy because its to hard and tricky to want anything else. 

You ask for a new car... but at the risk of getting in a car accident, with little money to buy a ""new car"" so you get a used car, and the technicality is... the car is new to you. 

But i think this upcoming year i want to resolve to enjoy my life and stop being scared of making the first step. I talk alot, alot of things i would do or i would say if an opportunity comes up. and when the chance happens i look away. I get nervous, why? i know i will have fun. I always tell people what do you have to loose. Yet i never listen to myself. 


This new years i intend to accomplish and do the things i want, or feel i should, or stop hesitating through my life. That is my way to happiness. 

This year is going to be a good year. I feel it. This is my year. I am completing goals, expanding my potential, but now i have to do it with enthusiasm. I have always envied people that can just jump up and say ""i can"" instead of looking at all the rules and regulations attached to it. 


This my year and I intended to live it."

So i am going to europe for 8 days (london and paris) on the 13 of march in 2010! :) with my awesome sister ginelle :) 

I am sooo excited there is like 70+ days left until this amazing trip. I am figuring my packing list now, and things i need to get etc. I am so excited. I feel like since graduating I am doing things for me :) and i am determined to do the things i have earned. I dont waste my money on stupid things and i feel like i earned this trip for being financially savvy and for being an accomplished young lady.

so i havent written about graduation! So i would like to say that i survived! i survived without medical help, without killing myself or even attempting. I am very very proud of myself :) 

All i can say is that so far the last 2 yrs have been an extreme struggle. Nothing but headaches drama stomach aches, vision problems, malnutrition, and mixed up priorities but i finished school and i finished my tasks in Phi mu. And i couldnt be happier. I couldnt be happier to be free from people pulling back and forth. I am in life for me and it feels  good to do me. Be me, to think of only me. 


I am taking a break, re-evaluating life and enjoying my stress free life. 

This is the time i get to work on myself and figure out what makes me tick, and why i am the person i currently am. This is my time for soul searching. My dreams are still there and will b accomplished but it feels nice to know that nothing is standing in my way. 

AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! excitement overwhelms me :)

My obsession with actors are border lining a problem. Lol. No i dont care about their personal lives. I dont care if they smoke do drugs or anything. I dont care who they date. I dont care about the gossip. I just care about their acting, and their look, and their clothing style.  I just want to mimic what they do. and re-enact the movies.....

weird! so i had a dream that my highschool friend danny noticed all the crap that has been happening in my life and text me saying that he would drop everything shortly and be by my side and that he would take care of me. 

Until i saw his page on facebook i remembered that dream and then remembered that text did not occur. 

More stuff happened in that dream that i can not remember but that too was trippy when i realized it didnt happen. I think its odd to have full length convos with ppl in a dream and think it happened in reality. 


anyways off to finish my notes for my midterm tomorrow. :(

i bought my new net book. i am sooo excited for it! i hope it comes in soon. And i am sooo excited that my internet skills did not fail me because i got a pretty good price on it :) 

So what kinda net book did u get?


well i got the new hp mini 110 in chic pink.... in my opinion it looks kinda purple pink, and no i did not get it in honor of phi mu. I do not like the color pink but that was the cutest one they had. If it were my choice i would have gotten a teal net book but they only have that color in a normal sized lap top. And i dont need a normal sized lap top cause i got a monster of a computer in december :) 


here is a picture! :)

"event","So i am going on my 2nd or 3rd week now of my days and nights being mixed up. It seems that i have insomnia... my mom wants me to go see a doctor. I suppose i should, but i feel like i cant until this semester ends. There is just sooo much many things to complete, and it feels like my health needs to just get in line. No one accepts excuses if your health is concerned. In their eyes they see it as ""oh well, i don't get to sleep either and i have a list of things to do as well! So suck it up and deal with it!"" 

I find it funny that no one is sympathetic anymore. No one cares about problems unless they are your own. People just drive harder and harder and push the people around them to do the same. I suppose i am guilty of it too. I really could not say i am not.

Its hard to balance your life when you only run on about 4 hrs of sleep a day... its exhausting. My mood swings are irritating me. My emotions are on edge... i cry at the drop of a hat. Subconscious issues are surfacing and I just don't have the time to deal with them. I feel like until i graduate i don't have the time to break down. But honestly i am just postponing a nasty crash. 


I personally don't wanna be there but that is inevitable. 


SLEEEEEPPPP is all i want. to be left alone is wt i want. to not do anymore presentations would be nice. to not have to do papers or exams would be optimal. I know that wont happen. 

Everyone tells me to chill out, and take a break. But again i cant. I am not exactly productive with my time. I cant study all the time cause i dont sleep so my brain cant handle it, so what happens i am just stuck reading FML.com all day and watch youtube videos. So i guess that is relaxing but its not. I am anxious because i know i am not studying or not doing some job for phi mu. 

I NEEED TO GRADUATE... then i can finally fix my personal life and health."

Is it possible to find a normal non-ultra religious guy to date and them not try to touch u in inappropriate places. Yesterday i went on this awesome date. we went to boomers and played mini golf then went to the beach. Had pretty good conversation, nothing really to complain about. We have alot of things in common. We have been friends for about 2 yrs now so i thought he was a nice decent guy. But as we start to make out he immediately trys to grab my boob and i stop him by blocking his hand. Then he trys to push my hand down towards &quot;that&quot; direction but i tense up and stop him. Then he tries to touch me down there... its like COME ON! does he want me to stop kissing him and tell him &quot;lay off buddy&quot;? its like i was trying to b nice and just move his hand away so he would get the hint. AND MIND U its only the <strong><u>first date</u></strong>.... its like even if i were going to sleep with him at least respect me enough not to try it on the first date. And we are at the beach in the open... Like seriously WTF!?! is that too much to ask? like honestly i am starting to think that mayb i am asking to much? <br /><br />I wonder if i come off as a slut, or easy... i am so confused i feel violated, i feel hurt. I&nbsp;just dont understand why a guy cant just like me.... <br /><br />It hurts to go from guy to guy and all they wanna do is sleep with you. Its like DAMN i wouldnt sleep with someone until i aleast loved them, or was there girl friend at least. One date doesnt give you the right to my body. Its amazing how bad a guy can make you feel about yourself. I&nbsp;like to think i am a sweet girl, a girl that cares for others, a girl that u can bring home to mom and that is worth the respect of others. But apparently i am not... i am just someone you fuck and move on. <br /><br />well thank u boys for showing me exactly what i am, if not i would have been blind."

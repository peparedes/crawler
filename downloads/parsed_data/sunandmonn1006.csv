IM TIRED. AND BORED. I THINK ON THE 13TH OF JULY I WILL HAVE A MONTH CLEAN. I LEAVE JULY 17TH FOR CALIFORNIA. I CAN'T WAIT. THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT DOESN'T SUCK RIGHT NOW. 

RIGHT NOW I'M SORT OF SEEING THIS GUY. HIS NAME IS KEVIN WOODS, WE'RE COMPLETE OPPOSITES. IT'S REALLY WEIRD. 

I'M SITTING AT HOME INSTEAD OF BEING AT THE CARNIVAL, WHICH I REALLY WANT TO GO TO, BUT I'LL JUST END UP USING AND  I'LL GET INTO EVEN MORE TROUBLE. SO I AM AT HOME HERE AT THE COMPUTER WASTING MY LIFE AWAY. THIS SUCKS. ANOTHER THING THAT SUCKS IS I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY FINAL GRADES YET, I REALLY WANT TO GET THEM BEFORE MY MOM SEES THEM SO I KNOW WHAT TO PREPARE FOR, IF I'M GOING TO GET YELLED AT OR IF I'M GOING TO GET MONEY FOR NOT FAILING.

I SAW HIGH TENSION 2 DAYS AGO OR SOMETHING NEAR THAT. THAT MOVIE IS SO FREAKY, YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING THE MOVIE AND ANOTHER THING IS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE FRENCH. AND WHEN THEY TALK IT LOOKS LIKE THE WORDS AREN'T COMING FROM THEIR MOUTHS.STUPID FRENCH. 


MY LIP PIERCING IS KIND OF RIPPED WHICH SUCKS BECAUSE NOW IT'S SORT OF INFECTED. IT'S REALLY TENDER. BLAH."

I hung out with Ryan, Chris, Larson, Al, and a couple other people I don't know. It was fun, Chris dropped me off at about 8 but that's ok. I talked to Josh yesterday. I don't know, I guess I never got over him. You know. This weekend I might go by Phils or Tylers I don't know yet. If I go by Tys' I know I'll get mad and annoyed and if I go by Phils I'll get bored fast.

Everyone got drunk.I had sex.Go Fish is fun. I was president and I made everyone drink. Then I drank more and threw up, then I had more and threw up again.Then I stopped and passed out.I got up an hour 2 hours later and hung out with everyone. The house we were staying at was haunted.

So she called in and said I wouldn't be at school today.I slept until 12:30-1:00. I haven't selpt like that for a while. I finished a potrait for my cousin. It's a sunset made ou of red, orange, and yellow peices of paper from the transworlds I get in the mail. I like it so much I might keep it. No I wouldn't do that, I'm giving it to my cousin on Saterday. Oh, I have this gay 60th surprise party to go to for my godfather on Saterday before the dance.Yea.. oooo yay 60 who the fuck wants to be that old. I don't want to reach the age of 80 or over .If I do I want someone to kill me. Old age is gross, you walk slow, talk slow, don't have good health, you smell like old people smell.. ect... Old people smell smells really bad.If any one knows what I'm talking about you have to agree.



My mom has two different parts. Old mom and new mom. Old mom would have let me go out tonight even though I stayed home from school.New mom said No I have to stay home and be bored and listen to cds or do homework(yea right HAHAHA that's a good one)or watch my dvds which.

recently nothing has been going on except my mom is having surgery on her rotater cuff because she tore it or something. 

Last Friday I saw the BLUEMAN GROUP with Kevin. That show has to be the most awesome show ever.In the begining my aunt got them to put my name up on one of those things like it says no photographs please, but instead they had peoples names. Mine was last, it said something about a headache and me pretending there was a cow is a field and for me to pretend it was grazing. Then at the end it said in all capitals KILL IT! They used at least $1000 worth of tp to throw around.They had tons of paint. One part they had one blue man throw thesse like huge gumballs/paint balls into each bluemans mouth. One blueman kept catching the paint ones and made a canvas painting out of it and the other blueman kept catching gumballs.He made a sculpture out of al if it. Oh, and they caught them with their mouths.

It was fun !"

"event","Corey and I broke up.Another realtionship gone.... why can I never keep something I really want. Bahhh.But I'll be ok I always have my friends. (ONLY 3 MORE YEARS UNTIL I LEAVE THIS FUCKING BUBBLE OF A TOWN.) Sometimes I wish I could stop thinking completely and just be happy.No way is that ever going to happen.Today Kyle came over he told me Dave is obssesed with this cheerleader who had a dream that they were haveing sex.So now Dave is into this girl because she had a wet dream. :( I wish I had someone for a steady relationship, but no one likes me. Matt's even mad at me.No guy takes me seriously.They think I'm one of them,I don't know.Err I want to be loved by a guy really I do, but it'll never happen.I guess I'm just going to have my heart broken a lot more then I wanted it to be broken.There's this one guy I really like but no it'll never happen because he doesn't see me like that. I don't even think he ""sees"" me.



In art today the art teacher pulled me aside because she heard one of my conversations with Ricky.She said she heard me say ""I don't even remember what happenedon Saterday"" and crap like that.She was like that's how un-wanted pregnancys happen.I think I'm going to remember if I have sex or not when I'm high,I'm sorry.I told her I was just messing around ,but she said she is still worried. O well one more for the worry boat.That makes 16. I wish people would stop worrying about me. I'll be fine I can do it by myself now.I'm a big girl.:)"

Uhmmm  lets see whats been going on lately. Cory and I are going out.We have been since December 1st. Saterday I got all fucked up.It was fun.I woke up at 1:15 on Sunday.Ashley came over Friay and spent the night and left Saterday evening.She didn't want to do anything really.So we rented a movie.SUPER SIZE ME ! It was a good document, but otherwise it was gross.Also on Firday I went to satans hut with Cory and Joe.That's about it.Right now I'm in the trainers room with a couple people.There are these two girls who come here and they say their backs hurt, but I really don't believe them because I think they're faking it.They were in a car accident, but ehh it's fishy I don't believe them.Err this sucks 11:05 I have lunch. I'll type in later bye.

I went out to walk my dog and she hates snow too.So my mum shoveled a path-way for her and a patch of grass so she could pee and poo.I took her and and at first she was like mad about it and wouldn't go near the grass. Then she got a second wind or something and was pouncing in the snow.It was funny.

I came home and sat around for a while. Then Kevin stoped by with Andrew, John, Robert, and Victor. We went around and did some stuff it was fun. Today I went to Kevins. I walked there even though it was raining and a crappy day.We watched the newer version of Dawn of the Dead.It was funny. I ate at his house.It was fun.

When Tyler and I were going out I knew he was smoking. It hurt, I mean a lot.He stopped for a while I think. I was happy.I broke up with Tyler because he just made me feel like shit sometimes.But since we've broken up he smokes more, and wants to try acid.And I hate when he tells me that I mean I don't want him to end up like Mike or some of the other friends I had. He thinks he isn't destructable. And well he is.He's weak. And sometimes I wish I'd of never met him."

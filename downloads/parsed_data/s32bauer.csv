"event","Well, today has been interesting and eventful to say the least!<br /><br />Today at work was shit.&nbsp; Absolutely awful.&nbsp; I can only hope that today wasn't a sign of things to come.&nbsp; So bad in fact that I booked half a day off on Wednesday.<br />There are some real wasters in that company, and I'll be glad when they have gone.<br /><br />Been doing a lot of thinking today, about the results of some of my choices, and what might have happened if I had gone through with certain things.&nbsp; Certainly provided a lot of interesting thinking!<br /><br />Was on my way back to work after lunch and something VERY unexpected happened - I bumped in to an old friend.&nbsp; I say an old friend, he is only the same age as me, but he was my BEST friend at Junior School, and haven't seen him in quite some time.&nbsp; He got kicked out of college for doing drugs, but now has a job at a graphic design company in Saffron Walden.&nbsp; We exchanged numbers, but not sure that anything will come of it, it's been a very long time.<br /><br />Anyway, got home from work and had a very big row with Chris, as usual.&nbsp; Went shopping (on my own), and then me, Chris, Juliet and Mel went to see ""Trust the Man"" at Cambridge cinema.&nbsp; It was quite a good film, had a happy ending which I have been wanting quite badly after the last couple of films we have seen!<br /><br />Mel seems to have a fancination with the Black and White Minstrels, which I must say is mildly amusing!<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/s32bauer/pic/0000k6dy/""><img height=""240"" width=""269"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/s32bauer/pic/0000k6dy/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />Not looking forward to work tomorrow, and still have a really bad neck ache which is making me feel quite sick.&nbsp; Might go and watch telly for a little bit now, and then off to bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Night night!"

"event","Ok, well there haven't really been any spats, but there have been a few chats! 

Had the chat at work with Steph and Emily - feel a bit anxious about the whole thing, which obviously I can't discuss on here yet, until they have confirmed it to the call centre tomorrow.&nbsp; Not sure how I feel about the whole thing. 

Just sent 40 texts to everyone with my new number, so I can finally start using my new phone! 

Today has been a bit boring to be honest, not much done and not much to do! 

Saying that though, I've just been chatting to three guys online who seem ok. One of them seems really nice and down to earth.&nbsp; Another seems a little childish, even though he is 21!&nbsp; And someone else called Kevin, who Chris isn't too keen on, which is a shame!&nbsp; Not sure what to think of him, but might be meeting up with him for a drink or something at some stage.

Anyway, I'm off upstairs now to watch a wee bit of telly!

Night Night!"

I don't think I could have done another day like yesterday, not twice in a row anyway!&nbsp; Emily and Steve were on holiday, Ollie was off and Steph was off.&nbsp; So, you can imagine the fun I had!&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Oh well, it's not my problem today! 

Not sure what I have planned for today.&nbsp; Need to do the washing up and stuff, but will probably leave that until just before Chris comes home.&nbsp; Need to do a bit of jogging as well, burn of that fair burger from last night - hmmmm greasy lover!&nbsp;

Someone who I'm not really close to went through something very bad last night, and I feel very bad for her and have an idea of what she might be going through.&nbsp; I can't say who it is, or what is wrong, but my thoughts are with her.

Been looking everywhere for the P990 but can't find it anywhere, well not very cheap anyway.&nbsp; O2 have put it back even further, now the 25th September. 

Well, might update again throughout the day if anything fun happens! lol"

As soon as I get in, the phones are knackered.&nbsp; Well, basically people were answering the calls but the customers couldn't hear the call centre talking to them.&nbsp; Well - actually one persons phone worked, and that person had to answer call after call after call.&nbsp; Yep, you guessed it, it was me!&nbsp; To add to that, you couldn't check your voicemail, and even when you went on wrap up the calls still come through!

I went to tell ""someone"" who was trying to fix it, but I got virtually pushed aside.&nbsp; Fucking rude if you ask me.

"event","Well, it's been quite a while since I updated this! <br /><br />Not a lot has happened really. Think I mentioned that me, Mel and Chris all made up? Most likely I did. <br /><br />The other night Chris went out with some people from AS to Newmarket for Mindy's leaving do. Being crap with directions I decided that I would leave with 45 minutes to spare, just in case. But turns out that I was so early that I only done 45mph all the way there and even stopped in a layby for 10 minutes! (Not for that! Just because I was so early!) Juliet didn't even drop any food on the seats this time either! <br /><br />Not sure whats happening tonight. Think we are going over my Mums to drop some stuff off for a boot sale tomorrow. There were talks of going to the cinema, but not sure if thats happening or not.<br /><br />The P990 has been put back - again!&nbsp; Now been put back to 18th September.&nbsp; Lots of people are still saying it's <em>buggy, </em>like the N80, but not as bad.&nbsp; I'm thinking that I might give it a go and then I can always just send it back if it's too bad.<br /><br />Still no information on whats happening in regards to Ollie's job.&nbsp; He leaves in around 2 weeks.&nbsp; Steph is back on Monday, so hopefully something will be decided by the end of next week.<br /><br />Most of my website is up a running now, but got all my reviews pages to sort yet before it goes live.<br />"

"event","My, it's very at work today!  I barely got a minute to eat my bacon roll from Mocha!
Oh well, at least it should boost my call figures!

Everyone keeps asking me whats happening about Ollie's job, as he is leaving mid-September, but no one seems to understand that I don't know whats happening myself! Oh well!

Last night, me, Juliet and Mel went to the cinema.  As you probably guessed, we both had a chat with Mel last night, and fingers crossed things will hopefully get back to normal.  Although I expect it might take a little time.

Me and Chris aren't sure what to do tonight.  We have free tickets to go to a club in Cambridge, but to be honest it's not always that much fun when it's just us two.  And there isn't anyone else that will go.  We have been invited out in Saffron Walden, but we have been out there twice this week already and I don't think I can stand another one! lol.  I love the people we would be going with but it's just ....crap!  I love the town, but I can think of better things than sitting in a smokey pub all night!

Was thinking about going to the cinema, but we have see all of the films that are out - and the ones we haven't seen, well we haven't seen them for a reason!  Vulver?  WTF is that all about!

Oh well, I dunno, we will probably just end up sitting in on the computers or watching T.V or something.  Never mind!"

And in the fizzle that you're hard to crack,
You're way off track,

I wish words were able to describe the way I'm feeling today.  Well, crap and rough are two of them, but thats a different story.

At the moment, something much larger, much more serious is going on.  Yesterday, at home, I found something.  Just a piece of paper - but this paper, or more to the point - what was written on it - had the power to destroy quite a lot.  I'm not talking about material things, like buildings, etc.  I'm talking about something much more complex.....feelings.

Last night, I found something, and I didn't want to believe it.  I kept denying it, and hoping that ""someone"" would tell me that it meant something different.  Well, in a way, thats what I got.  But that doesn't mean I believe it.

I can't go into much detail, as it's quite depressing and really doesn't help the way I'm feeling today.  But after last night, I'm starting to wonder just how much hope there is left.  I'm starting to wonder just how many times you need to give your heart to someone, before they stop ripping it out.  I'm wondering....is there any time left at all."

Today has been a complete gobshite of a day!

This morning was shit, as chris had the day off - wouldn't expect him to work a full week anyway.

Then found out that someone was leaving at work - but not being replaced.  Although I can't go into specifics, I'm rather aggitated.

Tonight we are going to Pizza Slut and watching some shit film with an ugly little twat in it.  Still, Chris likes him, but hey, didn't think he went for anything but a twink.  

Papa Bear, Papa Bear

......he don't care.

"event","Well, so far today hasn't turned out that bad - yet!

This morning I thought that today was going to be hell.  My phone crashed and so the alarm never went off.  I then woke up at 8.58am!  I started walking to work and then remembered that I was supposed to come in smart today.  Got home, got dressed and then realised that some clever person had left the fridge open!  

Still, things have got a little better throughout the day.  Apart from one of my closest friends being very upset by something.  Hopefully I was there for her.  I feel really sorry for her and just wanted to give her a big hug - although I feel I would most likely have got a slap if I had done!

Going over Mums for a takeaway shortly, so hopefully the rest of the evening will turn out better than this morning!

After a while we decided to create one called Film Club, where we can post reviews of films we have seen recently.  Of course, anyone else can post comments and reviews about films too if they like!  The community name is the_film_club - take a look!

I was sitting with Juliet and Chris tonight and thought that it might be fun to set me up a LiveJournal!  Anyway, imagine my surprise when I see that the username I want was taken!  Only turns out I signed up to LiveJournal about a month ago and forgot about it!
 
IDIOT!!!

Was my day off today.  Went out to McDonalds as we couldn't be arsed to cook.  The days gone pretty quick today.  Found out that someone at work - who is always lecturing me - actually tried to find out more stuff about me whilst I was suspended, to try and get rid of me I imagine.  I dunno!  Bought Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 the other day - my emotions at that place are more up and down than one of those bloody coasters!

Well, this LiveJournal should keep me entertained for a while I guess."

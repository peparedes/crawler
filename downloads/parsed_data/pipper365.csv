this is how redneck i am. i tried to cut the lawn with our weedeater. i would not recommened this to anybody. weedeaters are not meant for large scale projects, (umless you are trying to steal back the edges of your yard from neew jungle growth)Its not that the weight will bother you, but the amount of yard it can cut quickly. which is not much...

"event","I like to sunbathe. I love being tan, bronze whatever. I so tired of people telling me I'll get cancer. Sigh.... please. And microwaves are bad to be around too, yet everyone has one.  I'm not ignorant. I hear all the hype.
           I don't have many ""me"" things. Or stuff I do 4 me. Sunbathing is one of them. I really enjoy it. How nice it is to feel the sun kiss ur skin. The heat relaxes my stressed out nerves. If it wasa like CRACK, I could see the prob. Yea, I'll be wrinkly later, but aren't all old people? Really?   It be ok. I done venting now."

    I always have good things to write about when not typing. It seems that it leaves my brain( most likley as wispy smoke leaving my ear) whenever I go to type. I have a theory bout that. I never have been good about writing down my thoughts. Maybe some trauma back in 4th grade, like a teachere or peere finding a note or diary, and I'm scared someone that's not supposed to c it will. Maybe I just. Have trust issues. Maybe I worry people will dislike me or think me weird 4 my opinion, or judgement on stuff. Don't want to lose any one close, or change what they think of me.... I should not care and sometimes I dont , but it lurks back there in my subconcious. Hmmm... idk . You always tell urself it doesn't matter but it doesn't feel true all the time.

    i never get bored with reading twilight. I know everyone always says that. u know whats coming but feel the charaters struggle with day to day issues. She doesn't make the right decisions all the time, and he has protective issues, but that's what makes them so likeable. They feel real. 
    i like tuck everlasting. It's a great book that helps u realize that living forever sounds cool, but all of lifes experiences should be treasured, not forsaken because of fear. Embrace the now.:) 
  The Biblia is one because it helps me through lifes daily things. It gives me strenght and hope when i need it. 
    And last but not least Rikki Tikki Tavi and Alice in Wonderland. They make me laugh and pleases the inner child in me."

The guy who has this horrible job, said it's supposed to be done every 2-3 years. We're on year 7. I'd say we were overdue. have i mentioned it was really gross???? (shudder) So we filled in the trench that we had dug in back, which was exhausting, and are up and running again. He tried to sell us this tank stuff. not really interested in the blue stuff.

Many friends weren't so lucky. It is kinda surreal seeing everything like that. Water water everywhere and not a drop to drink. 

My hubby and i went to rescue a friend who ""didn't think the water was that deep"". *sigh* his car was totaled, and when my hubby was trying to tow it to the friends house he was told by the policeman, if it wasn't his stuff to get the f%$k gone. WTF? i really didn't care if u've been up 24 hrs. It's ur job to help out the public. U know the whole serve and protect...
oh well.  stupid pig.
 
Actually saw a bolt of lighting hit a tree. Very scary and awe inspiring at the same time. it lit up like a firework. it had sparks flying everywhere, little trails of electricity reaching out like fingers of an invisible hand. Then the whole thing burst into flames just long enough for me to see before the deluge put it out. all of this happened in a quick moment. I really didn't think that my brain could process images that quickly. maybe it was the shock. It's odd the things that popped into my head. I was wondering if we would feel any surge of electricity , since we were sitting in water... ok it sounds dumb now but it sounded on the ball then.

I was trying to find her and everytime i called her she'd meow. No matter where i looked for her, she always slinked away before i got there. phobe is prego, or just acting weird( hidden catnip?). She never used to demand attention before now she's always on our laps. Crazy..."

Not really sure what to do with myself lately. i'm so used to tball and tons of other things going around that the free time is odd for me. Maybe (to my hubbys dismay)i'll do some painting.I've been planing to do the LV forever just no time. Maybe a sage or olive green...hmmmm
 
i'll try to put up some pics of the new floors l8r this week. i LOVE my floors. 
well gotta see what the cat needs. She's very needed this month. She's very good company when reading. :)"

"event","I went over my past entries and man r they few and far between. I am trying to remedy that.  Visited the in laws 2day. Mom in law has really helped my little man in the spelling area of schoolwork. He's been struggling so long  with it. i don't know what she did but he's doing so much better. It went really well. Ate fantastic chili. April always makes a good batch. Especially if my hubby ( her little bro) asks her to. He's so spoiled. He denies it though. heehee.... oh well. 
  Lexi has her last meet of the year this weekend b4 state. She's totally past the nervous part. Mostly. Our youngest is about to re-enter the gymnastic field. I think she needs more training in grace but she's hard headed like her mom, and wants to try anyway. I'll have to bring a book to read so i don't jump up every time she falls. give them wings and they want to fly.... sigh. Didn't i hear that in a song somewhere. 
   Prob write later this week. mommy hood is calling.."

"event","Lots of stuff on my mind. 
   Trying to get everything on the ""LIST"" done but I never seem to find the time. It prob doesn't help that I've gotten on a bad schedule. I read until late (it's my weakness) and then sleep in way to late. It's starting to effect my kids schooling, and that is unacceptable. Gotta fix that. Maybe i'll start taking Lunesta. *sigh*  Always running here or there (my own fault 4 signing up my kids 4 so much stuff) or when i go to try to complete a task something else needs done first. Ugh, will I ever catch up? 
       Also been trying to lose some weight. Doesn't seem to b working. It feels like the all the muscles are pushing the fat out farther. Hahhahahaha
Might try the Hydro-cut stuff or maybe one of those Alli things. A friend of mine suggested that I could do one of those wraps that take inches off u. It worked 4 her. She said she lost 13 inches all over. Maybe they switched the measuring tape. heehee I'm pretty sure that it only water weight or something like that, but even if it is, it leaves your skin silky. :) I'm at the point where i might just stop eating. 
    Got a new mattress. Getting used to it. Hubby broke the water bed one. With his ELBOW! I mean really. Who does that?! It's a soft pillowlly top serta mattress. Guess I'm just not used to it yet.
  I am having a good hair day despite the horrid weather. Rain  usually makes it poof out like an afro, but not today. It looks nice. yea"

  the little gymnast had first meet and medaled in all events. I so proud of her. Esp. cuz she was so nervous. She has real courage, to stand in front of a crowd that big crowd ( big 4 her) and do her Thang, was really amazing. Sigh ....they get wings sooner than i want them to.. and it'll only get harder for me to let go. Oh the joys of motherhood. *smile*"

"event","Had a great time at the park today. My little girl had her first t-ball game today. We thought it would be chiller than it was but it turned out ok. Well as long as the sun was up. :) She did a great job. She got 3 outs and 2 good hits. Only once was she playing in the dirt, but that was in the outfield. HAAHAA ... I LOVE watching their games. They play just for the fun of it and don't care about winning. We're doin great if they run the bases in the right order. 
I tried t bring yummy yet healthy snacks and drinks for afterward, but it ended up being pringles (baked not fried) and capri sun(it has some juice in it right?). They seemed to like it. 
 My little boys team didn't fair as well. they lost 14-4. It really wasn't their fault though. They only had 4 practices because all the others got rained out. He seemed to have fun though. It's his first year at 2nd base. He's realizing quickly that the ball comes at u MUCH faster now. They get so serious when they bat. In 7-8 u get 5 chances at a pitching machine. The wheels are soooo old that they aren't very reliable. U might get one or two in the strike zone. But hey, he did good anyway. 
Sometimes i embarrass him. I what u call a LOUD parent. Not in a bad mean way to the other team, but i cheer to much. (yea go hot rod!) Or good hit! He must love me cause he tolerates it really well. at least he knows that he is loved. heehee
 well got to put them to bed.

"event","*sigh* So sleepy... Friends from down south came to visit recently. It was so nice to see them again.  They are some the laid back people i know. I don't have a lot of friends that I like hanging out with as much as them.  First we had a picnic in the park. it was relaxing even though it was a little ""crowded"". The kids really missed them. They always enjoy playing with them. Especially the styrofoam plane and piggyback rides. :) We went out(just us adults) to eat and hung out awhile that evening just having fun and laughing. Man, I missed hanging out with them. 
Lots going on this month. Getting y little girls b-day stuff ready (where to have it, when, what to get..) I think she'll like it though. :) We're prob. going to have a tinkerbell theme. Or maybe a tea party. I hope her friends come. she wants to invite the whole gymnastics class. Since she home-schools it means a lot for friends and family to come. 
I don't think i'll ever have my back yard fence. The ONE thing I really wanted, (not 4 me, but 4 the kids and puppies) doesn't seem to b a priority. Somehow my projects always get put on the back burner. i don't think the hubby means to, it still makes me feel slighted nonetheless. He's never told me no, other things keep getting bought... or fixed, or whatever. *sigh*"

I am thinking about redecorating the house soon. I need a change. The white walls must go. My hubby likes white, and I say it says u can't pick a color. So we're compromising, Some white, most not.:) The kids doin great. If we can get 2 days without rain, we might b able to get tryouts done 4 baseball. Mabey...
   I'm trying to get into my gardening again. Mabey a little one out back. 
The kids think it would be cool.It's pretty funny though, because the stuff they want to grow ( or most of it) they don't even like to eat. 
who knows it might b a bonding experience. :):)

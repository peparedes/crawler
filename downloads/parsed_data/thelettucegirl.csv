"event","This afternoon while my parents were at mass I read <em>Phaedrus</em>. Lying back on the couch, I kept underlining passages and noting page numbers until Siegfried came and sat on my stomach so that I could hardly move for fear of being scratched. I enjoyed much of the book, still, and found the second character's arguments worth consideration. Mainly, the succession of speeches formed an extended discussion of rhetoric. All of the techniques were explained thoroughly and the distinction between ""proper"" and ""improper"" writing elaborated. I can't help wishing Ms. Dalton had suggested we read this before the AP exam, or even just gone over some of Plato's most relevant points...perhaps Ms. Paulovic would have. *sigh*"

Several times, he began trying to talk with me, but I was like, ""What the fuck!"" and just laid my head down. [...he said, ""I been around, I slept with who I like...""] Still, the multiple choice was a breeze and the only difficulty encountered was in writing three timed essays, one after another after another. Afterwards, I went out to lunch at Burger King with Jenny, Jessica, Kimberly, and Felicia.&nbsp;From there I came home to&nbsp;read <EM>The Arabian Nights</EM>.

"event","<P>So, yeah, this morning I got in a wreck. Turning left onto S. Holly, I was hit on the driver's side by an oncoming pick-up truck. I&nbsp;climbed out only with a scratch, but&nbsp;the Buick&nbsp;was totaled. I wasn't wearing my seatbelt and was tossed across the passenger seat on impact. </P>
<P>It happened that I had pulled out too far past the stop sign, trying to see around the bushes, and, finding myself in a lane of traffic, tried to dart forward. Most clearly I remember thinking, as I watched the truck skidding towards me, ""Oh my God, I'm going to be in <EM>so</EM> much trouble."" How ironic, that at that exact second I was frightened, not of the threat to my personal safety, but of the inevitability of a revoked license! </P>
<P>Well, I got out and borrowed a neighbour's cell phone to call Alice and stood with another neighbour until she came. The police were called. Then I explained my mistake to the officer (who was terribly nice) and stood with Alice while towing was arranged and the accident report written up. The other driver was also understanding and even offered Alice and me some gum. When I began to apologize he only said, ""All that matters is that neither of us was hurt."" </P>
<P>By this time my mom had arrived. The legal situation was explained and the policeman recommended that instead of paying the $230.52 fine, I attend traffic court and try to avoid having the four points put on my license. The date is set for May 24th. I've cried a good deal and tried to argue my case to my parents, but from here on out it seems that I'll be walking. I can't believe this, really; it seems that instead I should be typing this into my dream journal under the category of ""nightmare."" Such a measure of freedom was lost; I'm furious with myself: how could I have made such a stupid mistake?</P>"

<P><FONT size=2>I just remembered that I had forgotten to correct a blatant noun-pronoun agreement error in my ""Come Fast Thy Prophecy"" essay. Oh, c'est la vie. I'm sorry that I read your gracious reply too late, but you are more than welcome to use that one sentence in the literary magazine as a random picture caption...or maybe printed on the back inside cover? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Well, I must know, because of my own morbid fascination, do you have a ""date"" for prom? [Man, I feel like mould,&nbsp;it's prom night and I am lonely, low and behold! she's walking over to me, this must be fake, my lip starts to shake...]&nbsp;I almost wish that I could go myself, to show off a pretty new dress, but such a teenage fantasy, in the words of the late President Nixon, ""is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I just read in the <EM>Free Times</EM> that Confederate Fagg is having another concert Sat. night at the Art Bar. I do so wish that I could go, but the timing is rather inconvenient, considering that the&nbsp;following day is Easter Sunday. ['I've got two tickets to&nbsp;Iron Maiden, Baby, come with me Friday, don't say maybe...']&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Now, I shall get back to reading <EM>The Three Faces of Eve</EM>, a truly fascinating novel! Part of it, in fact, is rather creepy, as the patient finally recovers a repressed memory (""Mother...! Oh, Mother...! Don't make me...Don't...Don't...I can't do it! I can't!"") of being made to touch her grandmother's dead face at a childhood funeral. </FONT></P>

Currently, she attends D-- High School and collects money in a stash beneath her floorboards to fund a clandestine trip to California.</P>"

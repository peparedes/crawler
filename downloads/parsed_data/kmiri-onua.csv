"event","Hmmm... Tahoi, the ponies, and I have made really good time, considering the usual broblems of ripped leather, ponies picking up stones, and tahoi chasing leaves and scaring the ponies. the strange thing is, though, as soon as we got clear of the fair I didn't see another human for the rest of the day. not that it's all that unusual, but i guess my nerves are just on edge a bit watching for theives. I know I shouldn't, but i'm wearing myslelf out a bit with protective spells on everything.  I really am starting to feel paranoid, and i keep my bow on me at all times. there's another thing too. there aren't any animals around, 'sept for the ponies and Tahoi.  I've had to fish ever since we left the fair: and it's not just tahoi's age that keeps him from catching anything- i can't find anything, and the path is usually laden with animals. I'll keep my guard up, better alive than comfortable. I can't wait to get home, my nerves are on edge."

"event","It's slow going, with just Tahoi to help. Luckily the ponies aren't making too much of a fuss.  We're just clear of the fair now, all of the idiot two-leggers wouldn't get out of my way. *sigh*. 

It's slow going, and I've heard rumors that there aren't as many horse-theives running about now, but that's not going to stop me from being careful. Goddess, i'm lucky nothing's gone wrong already. it IS nice to be able to settle into the safety circle and read these journals- it's like therapy after dealing with those four-legged room-mates... (not that i don't love the ponies, it's just a certain dun gelding can only step on your foot so many times before... ugh.) 

I do have one question though, for anyone who can answer: does anyone know where i can get some more eyebright? (OOC: to tell if someone's lying w/out the Sight.) I've gone through a lot if it from interviewing assistants. *grins wickedly* Yes, Daine, I used it on you, too. I knew you weren't fifteen.

The ponies have ear mites again. I'm off to get ear swabs."

"event","Well, it's time to start packing up camp: the fair is almost over. At least I'll have one last easy day on my birthday... (OOC: WHOO-HOO!...16!!!) and *grumbles* I'm not about to tell you how old I am so don't even ask, trainee meg! ;) Well, off to excersise the ponies a bit, they're getting restless, being penned up all night. ta"

"event","Just an update- Tahoi's fine, but a little dun mare just gave ear-mites to half the herd.  If I want to get done before dark I'll have to start now. No news yet on an assistant."

"event","Tahoi broke his leg today, stupid dog.  *sigh* I didn't mean that. He is smart, just... over-zealous, I suppose.  Well, he's getting on in years, and isn't quite as agile as he used to be, and he caught his leg while jumping over a log. *sighs and shakes head* Thank the gods that I have the gift, or I'd be fresh meat for horsethieves.  Now I just need to find an animal-healer in this mess of know-nothing two-leggers..."

"event","Hey, i know i havent written for a while in this, yall bitch update your liv...ya i know. to be honest. im kinda done with this lj crap. its really not my thing. it might have been fun as an extra little way to contact your friends and see whats goin on with them. personally, ill talk to poeple when i want to talk to them, but im not real able to just spell my life out and hope somebody wiil be interested and give me a sense of self worth. Honestly, i also dont want to keep doin this shit cuz of poeple on it. Its just some poeple who if im gonna know about there buisness we gotta talk about it. Ya wana know the one thing iwant to talk about, I wana bitch about why im so fed up with drama and BULLSHIT. Guys aint supposed to feel real love. Its supposed to be what theyn say top get a girl in bed. no, not ""well she puts out"" but fuckin unconditional love, especially not with the only girl ive previously  been in that situation with. Everyone that tries to explain there advice or views and tell me theyve been there, i find frequently dont really know. Im wih a fucking amazing girl right now that is everything to me.I would do anything for her. Anything but entirekly bail on a person who i promidsed no matter what, id be there for.Nothing would ever come before lani, but she s so fuckin great that she understands commitment to friendship that i made with you know who. I wouldnt ever fuck that up, but i have always been willing to be there for you know who. I was always there. I remember the stuff she used to write in her journal thats still there, and the things she said that made me feel like if i wasnt there for her, id be bailing on her and i needed to help her. I remember outside her apartment, she was telling me how much she needs me and that she wants my help and the crocdile tears that went with it. I would never ever not be there for her no matter what my situation was, burt she made her choice that she doersnt want me around anymore. Her choice. Anyone whos reading this has probobly not only told me: letting her manipulate me is stupid, but has probobly been someone i cast aside aswell. Sorry, I thought this person wasnt the lying sack of shit that all the clues pointed to. By the way, ya, i know, ""dont come to her defense all the time"", ya im done fighting her battles, but yall who are writing the mean things to her beleive me, you wont be able to say things asd mean as ive felt like saying, but just dont say them for me, say what you feel you should say to her but dont say stuff for me, Arye, Bobby, Yelana, Marin, I appreciate yall carin and you all know if somebody made you feel so betrayed i give you my word id do the same for you. but theres no reason to now. I personally beleive she has actually gotten lost in her own world(more than ever before). I also feel like its better to tell someone who you are if your gonna make a comment just cuz you shouldnt cowar away, but that is your choice. I must be the most stubborn person i know, and now im saying she said shes done with me and im saying your choice. How do you tell someone that you always begged to help you and told you theyd love you forever etc... be ""done with you"". Does that mean she was using me. How are you finished with the a person you have admittedly said has never been untruthful and has always been there for you cuz she says she needs me. Thats a classy person, just like her mother, but shed never be like her: lie cheat, use poeple and offer the only thing a female of her type feels she can offer to get attention. But shes done cuz i guess NOW she doesnt need me. K"

"event","""The Sweetest Thing"" is a cool movie. DUDE...How many movies have i watched in the last 3 weeks. Oh shit, Im a nerd, somebody help! This whole being grounded thing is fucked. Not that i could really get permision for much when i had straight A's but this is really pathetic. i cant get out of the house! Not even for the hike. For the last 2 weeks all ive done is go bowling once. Im freakin out. Its like cabin fever or somethin. Christmas and new years i had to spend with my family just like the other 363 days of the year. Im so tied of my dad actin like Im some problem kid that gets into trouble all the time. He'll bitch about how my friends ""arent as fun loving"" and how i dont go out on enough dates but hes the one that always cancels everything on me when he rarely gives me permission in the first place. Most of yall know that to a certain point, and in some paticular areas, Im a goody-two-shoes. But he acts like im gonna rape somebody, get in a drunken bar fight and O.D. on some horrible drug he hears about on the news or that he remembers from his hippie days, if he ever lets me out of his sight. That hike was gonna be awesome. Id think that someone with not that much money, but a kid who's workin hs ass off around the house, would wanna make a free activity like a hike seem great. I understand that he cant really give me money to go see movies or go to theme park everytime some group of friends are going, but somethin like a hike would be encouraged! My mom tries to help out and that was the only reason i got to go bowling after canceling it twice. My mom was saying that shell try to get me a chance to go hiking or something on The last weeknd of winter break. If i can go, anybody whos reading this, get a hold of me on the phone email...wutev and you can come. I havent talked to Marin and Lari since like 2 in the morning when they talked about how they were gonna go on their own hike today behind Lari's house. I dont know where the fuck lari lives so they can go hike behind her house but thats either really gay or really damn cool. After I got off the phone with Marin, somebody with a blocked number called the cell and just kept pushing buttons and then finally finised with that and started talkin like a Habib-acan(ya know like a muslim or sumthin) and they were sayin the funniest shit but she knew what Posters i had in my room and what they said, so that was weird. I was really cose to hanging up on them but they wre really funny! I still dont know who it was though butn its somebody who obviously knows me. They were describing this Jenna Jameson poster i had and so i tought it might be Sasha Mae but then the voice sounded more like shannon, but Marin and Lari were th only ones tht knew i was awake but that doesnt really mean anything and it didnt sound at all like them. Anyway now i wanna figure out who it is."

"event","My friend James Maroni has had this pretty sweet civic for a while. Its Dark Blue and it's got what looks like a Wings West full body kit. It's a rice rocket but,hey, it looks pretty sweet. While i wasnt home, James called and my dad picked up and then delivered the message to me later that the beutiful civic was now a not so good lookin wrecked civic. He said he must have hit some black ice(oil and ice mixed togethr on mountain roads: invisible) or something and just lost it. When i called him his little sister said he went with his dad to the insurance company to see how bad the damage was. Still waiting for him to call me back. Hope it aint totaled and i cant wait to hear the details of what hapened."

"event","hey,
Im showing my friend the live journal thing. all the differant ppl and stuff! He saw marin's pics and he got drool all over my keyboard...THATS DROOL, RIGHT?!?! What are yall doin for New Years? We're goin to pasadena to camp on the parade route before the parade. Weve done it for the last 2 years. Its pretty awesome. we chill with all the poeple out there, play football,etc...Than by morning we try our hardest to sleep through the parade. The first year, we borowed a friends pimp RV and we found a spot for 100 bucks and called up some friends and it just went together. But this year we cant take the Rv cuz it blew up. Frst time me and ryan shields werent the ones responsible for the destruction of  vehicle! We got a new pimp wagon though for this year. Its one of those Ford Mark III vans with the electric fold down sofa that turns into a bed, along with all the cool gadgets like tv and etc... Gotta go pack up the van, the truck and the camper trailer and its late and COLD! So later,

Anyway today was a waste of a day...seriously! I didnt do shit.I talked on the phone from about eleven am to almost 5,but besides that i been sittin around. Tomorrow, bobby were goin bowlin with the girls and if anything gets fucked up and i cant get out of the house, im gonna flip. We cancelled the damn thing like three times now and im waitin for somethin to come up now. 
I went and read some of rachels old entries today. Damn...That was aqn angry girl. Hopefully shes still gonna be cool with bein friends like she always said she would. Besides that, i think shes still got like one of my shirts and maybe my white jersey...I think??? I looked at travis' lj,and damn bro, your realy into pro ball-never knew that. I dont rally follow it much i just watch the games that sound good and OF COURSE, the superbowl. I saw Brianne has some entries but i felt bad cuz the last one wasn't real happy but i didnt know details, so i was just kinda like-hey, uh wutup...i dont know wuts goin on...but HI!. I saw kyle's and damn your still a dork but what up fellow cracker!!! I had to go to sasha Mae's cuz she was just really sweet and called to say Merry Christmas. My grandmother didnt even call to say Merry Xmas and Sasha mae who cant stand me every morning, called so i thought that was cool...Fuckin weird-but SWEET!. Uhh, shit, who else's did i see,oh ya i totally didnt recognize Kazia in her lj and then i caught on but not b4 lookin kinda stupid. That remeinds me, did Kyle say he had a conversation with his sis about life. Michelle? Not to dog on her at all cuz she's a homie (and i bugged Bobby for not stayin with her) but could she really focus that much?! Ive never witnessed her in a deep meaningful convorsation. If theres Any body im frogettin,its cuz i dont like you!-Na, not really! Hear from yall later

"event","Howdy,
Marin finally got me to go to this godforesaken site in which ppl all get pist at one another for what they wrote. Its cool though! Sounds like fun. I just saw marin's pics...uhhhh,wow! I mean damn! K, What bobby said was really far though,lol. Your a hottie, Marin! I dont really know what to write about. i went to the movies today with Sasha. Its hard to spend time with her cuz of her parental figures, but i still try like hell! Everybody that knows me knows that even though we're not goin out or anythng anymore, i still care about her alot and really gotta be with her every no and then. 

Christmas, this year wanst a real big deal. My family didnt really do anything for christmas cuz it wouldnt really work out. My dad didnt really like the gift we got him and my mom's is still in the mail. I got a really awesome internal frame backpack. Im die'n to take the damn thing hiking. were planing a twenty mile hike pretty soon. but i need to get a group of ppl that got the balls to go on it cuz 20 miles is...uhhh...well, its a damn hike! Im gonna ask some of the guys on the team if there interested. The other guy whos already goin with me is my ""mexican brother"" who I went on a hike with to the highest point on the west end of catalina island. About 2 to 3 thousand feet high. At this point your either really interested or im bored as hell of this journal and me rambling on and on, but hey-Its a ""journal""-thats what your supposed to do. I got the idea of blockin anonymous ppl, from marin cuz i wanna know who you bunch'a assholes are, who respond. Just kiddin. Late"

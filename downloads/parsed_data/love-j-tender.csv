I'm going to call his mother today to check how she has been doing lately, it's pretty hard losing your youngest son so quickly.  But I am going to cheer her up.  I always do, she is amazing and so his her husband.  They are like my other parents, they check up on me once in awhile when they are feeling alright.

Well, I feel like talking like better news than that upsetting news.  

Hopefully, Sept 2. 2006! My f/h and I will be getting married, I am engaged to be married (Sat.22.05 it happened) He is a wonderful guy named Mike (weird how many friends of mine are mikes).  So yeah, that's mostly all the news 

Oh yeah, and I start helping clean the church from March - ??? which will bring in some good income for my new future with a husband.  This shall be exciting to work in a place of where I love to be the most since my house isn't Christian it will be good to be in a environment thats better for me

Hope you all are great .. have a great day!"

The day after Thanksgiving, also known as Black Friday, or Thanksgiving Sales to most.  Is worst than the Canadians boxing day sales!  I went down with my mom, grandma and niece as my mom wanted to have people there just so she could get Christmas presents at a cheaper deal.  Anyways, early friday morning and I mean EARLY as I didn't sleep well the night before.  I got up at 4am and to the store by 4:15am as we were sleeping in a hotel across from the mall(Bellis Fair Mall) and stood in the line for a digital camera at BestBuy for 2 hrs before being allowing to be in the store as it opened at 6am, after getting things that we were supposed to get waiting in line for 3hrs just to pay for.  

I really couldn't believe the sales though they are great to get as the money is cheap for us to spend right now as the dollar is so good, however, unless I am really wanting something I am never going down there again on a sale day like that.  It's Crazy!

Anyways, other than that news about crazy shopping.

It's been an okay week I guess, I was sick the night before leaving for the states which isn't fun but okay.  Just kinda sick of work but I am glad that it is almost over, I have quite a bit of time off but I don't know if that is going to work out to that much time off as my sister (who is the manager) for a kiosk had to fire someone.  However, I am really glad he is gone because he was so rude.  but many of the people there now are so called Church-goers.  Which would be better if they were Christians but it's good that at least they are getting out to church.  Hopefully, they will accept God's love one day!

Hope everyone is doing great!"

It's just for the Christmas season and I am glad.  Surrey is just too far from me, though I usually am at Grandma's and it's quicker from her house.  There isn't much for me in Surrey, just work.  However, just sitting here writing this before I have to get ready and start doing things for the day.  As I am going to Burnaby to see my dad, nana and gramps since I haven't seen them for ever and since it's my birthday tomorrow, I think I should go get my present from my dad.  Also, I need to see my gramps as I haven't seen him lately, he has cancer, so if you are reading this please pray for him.  He is non-Christian as well as the whole family, and I just want them to know God fully because I try and just be honest with them about my faith though sometimes they don't care but some of them are glad that I go to church.  Anyways, I just wanted to update a bit though it's not much.  Hope that everyone is well.  Please continue to pray for my family and myself.  Thank you very much

Have a great holiday season!"

"event","Today was amazing.. church was good, God is great as usually and I need to update since I haven't written for awhile.  I don't know if anyone really looks at this; however, I will post what has been going on lately in my life.  Of course, over this summer I was working at the PNE, and housesitting in Abby so I didn't have much time for anything really.  My boyfriend, Mike came to visit once in awhile so I wasn't too lonely.  It was just good to do something rather than always being at home doing same old junk.  Then for my boyfriend's bday.. my grandma and I already had planned to see Josh Groban http://www.joshgroban.com at GM Place, Vancouver.  She had two extra tickets one she gave her friend and the other to my bf.  We had a good bday for him.  Then over to Nanoose Bay to celebrate with his parents, it's so relaxing around their house.  About my boy, we have been going out for just over 4months, and it's great God had and has his hands on this relationship which make it so good, everyone loves him and everyone seems to just be happy and think we are getting married sooner than later which I am happy about!!! However, beyond that I will have a job as my sister says because she gets to hire anyone that she wants for HickoryFarms working in Surrey in the Mall, so I will be working there during the Christmas season which will be great.  

Anyways.. thats mostly all the new news about me.. 

Hope you all are doing okay and hope to hear from you soon

It's hard living in a world that just wants more of what I consider as junk , new cars, new this or that.  What they need is YOU!!!!! Lord, teach me to be a servant and follow you and teach others about you!  Lord, I don't have any thing but YOU right now  direct my future Jesus.  Lord, if I should be teaching I pray that it would happen.  I know I have to get out there and make it happen but Lord, I pray that if I should have to have loans or other ways of getting money from the goverment - I pray that they would provide money so that I can get back to school.  You use everything to your good will and way.  I just want to be what you want me to be.  Though you have provided me with loving children and them loving me in return and being able to help at church for Sunday School.  I pray that getting my E.C.E to teach pre-school children would be the right thing and that if it's not that you stop it.  Thank you Jesus for the peace you have given me just for knowing that you are in control even when I can't have control about some situations.  I wish I could control things sometimes but YOU ARE IN CONTROL!! Thank you Lord.  I pray for this family Jesus and that they would know you because I know they are going to come to Jesus.  When I don't know but I leave that in your hands but I pray as that day comes that I can be a light in this very dark house Jesus.  I want less of me, and more of you.  Just I thank you that I had the money to buy Jeremy Camp's worship cd.  It's so great and just a blessing to have worship music that just speaks so deeply to me.  Thank you Lord.  That's all really I can say is THANK YOU JESUS!!! Amen."

2004 dates confirmed:
July 28, 31, Aug. 4, 7

Whoo hooo. The fireworks are back! They weren't sure if this year's were going to happen but I am glad they are.  It's a great time to get people together and have some fun!!! 

The only part of the fireworks I hate is the traffic of people that I just kinda fly by (walking too fast - as my friends say) or the drinking/smoking.  

Which leads me to a question ... for those that might be like me and doesn't really like drinking booze .. what would you do instead of booze at your wedding when you get married.  

I just want the weekend to come soon.  I am going to UBC to http://www.worshipinvasion.com - I love going there it's just so much unity between people and we come from all different churches.  It's just so awesome how God works because we all believe in Him and it shouldn't matter what church you attend, but still these days people always ask where do you attend church.  Well, if you love worship! and can get to Vancouver! COME!

This has just been something really on my heart lately.  For those that don't know I live in a non-Christian home right now, with my sister, niece, niece's dad(sister's so called boyfriend), my friend, my mom and I.  It's really hard living in this house right now.  And this speaks so well to me especially about the coffee and stuff.  My mom always asks me for things, and what do I do at times not always but whine because she is there sometimes even in the kitchen and tells me to make it.  But I can't - we need to do things as we were doing them for Jesus.  It's sooo hard, but I know Jesus will be happy when we show others how much he loves them by showing them through doing things we dislike for them.  Anyways, tonight has been a rough night and I need to get to bed soon so later.

Encouragement for Today
Love, Part Two
Melissa Taylor, Certified Speaker

Key Verse:

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.  Galatians 5:22-23 NIV

Devotion:

Yesterday we looked at two principles of love: 1)  Love is an act of the will and 2)  Love is action, not just words.  Today, we will examine three more:  3)  Love reaches out to the unlovely.  4)  We need God's help to love us.  5)  Love expects nothing in return.  (Taken from ""A Woman's Walk With God, Growing in the Fruit of the Spirit"" by Elizabeth George.)


Love reaches out to the unlovely.  There are many Biblical examples of Jesus reaching out to unlovely and unlovable people:  the leper, the prostitute, the adulterer, the tax collector, just to name a few.  He does the same thing today.  How does God reach out to you?  I don't know about you, but I'm pretty ""unlovely"" at times. He loves me still. Romans 5:6 reports, ""We were living against God.""  ""We were God's enemies"", states Romans 5:10.  Have you ever thought of yourself as God's enemy?  Have you ever turned against God?  Have you ever done something that God wouldn't want you to do?  Lied?  Cheated?  Gossiped?  Acted in disobedience?  Disrespected your husband?  Lost patience with your children? 

These are all examples of ugliness at its best. ""There is none righteous, not even one...All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:10, 23)  Max Lucado says, ""It isn't that we can't do good. We do.  It's just that we can't keep from doing bad.""  We, my good friends, are unlovely!  Yet we are so loved by God.  We are forgiven, cleansed, purified, reconciled, and then put back together----by God!  Jesus was born the same way we were all born but He came bearing an extraordinary purpose. He came to save us ordinary, unlovely people, paying for our mistakes so we wouldn't have to.  He was always focused on love, His desire, passion, and purpose to bring His children home behind every step He took. 


We need God to help us love.  ""Apart from Me, you can do nothing"", said Jesus in John 15:5.  Even Jesus recognized His need for His Father. Notice how all through Jesus' life, He studied the scriptures and made time for prayer. How else could He love the unlovely?  In our natural state, we hate our enemies.  Look at this principle again. 

We need God to help us love.  That's right, we do. We need God to help us love because He knows we can't do it alone nor were we ever meant to.  We are not to love for our sake, but for His sake.  We wouldn't need a Savior if we could do it alone.  God wouldn't be our Provider if we were self sufficient.  And when it comes to love we are completely helpless to love on our own.  Look at what He did for us.  Romans 5:5 says, ""God has poured out His love to fill our hearts.  He gave us love through the Holy Spirit whom God has given to us.""  You see, we do need God's help to love.  He stands ready, every minute of every day, to love through us.


Love expects nothing in return.  I must admit that this truth is the hardest one for me to practice on a regular basis.  It's easy to understand, but hard to do.  Just this morning, I brought my husband, Jeff, a cup of coffee while he was having his quiet time.  He didn't say thank you or anything.  I got a little huffy, because I had walked all the way upstairs to deliver it.  Fortunately, the Lord brought ""His love"" to my mind and this principle.  I didn't bring Jeff the coffee for a thank you.  I did it because I love him and I know how hard he's been working lately.  That should be enough.  I don't say ""thank you"" to God for all the things He does for me on a moment by moment basis.  And He still loves me.  Let's look to the cross to bring this principle home.

Jesus paid for our mistakes so we wouldn't have to.  Remember John 3:16.  God loves us so much that He gave the life of His one and only Son - for us.  There is nothing that we have to do or can do in order to earn this love. It's free. When I look at it like that, it makes my pity party over the coffee look just plain stupid!  I was trying to charge at least a ""thank you"" for coffee. It's supposed to be free, expecting nothing in return.  Accepting Christ as our Lord and Savior, believing in Him...that's all that's required of us in order to experience His love. We don't have to do anything in return.  He did it all.  While hanging on the cross (for you and me) in excruciating pain, He demonstrated a love like no other. 

To really love someone like Christ loves is indeed a challenging call.  But we can do it - if we do it through Him.   Philippians 4:13 tells us that we can do everything through Him who gives us strength.  If we could do it alone, this verse would just say, ""I can do everything"" and stop there. But we can't do everything. We can't do it all.  ""Apart from Me, you can do nothing.""  Let those words bring you comfort. You need God.

You can fulfill Jesus' command in John 15:12 (to love like He loves), but you just can't do it alone. Spend time with God.  Have a quiet time and guard it.  Go to Him for momentary ""fill ups"". He is your Source and can fill your heart with all the love you'll ever need.


My prayer for today:

Lord, thank you for filling my heart with love.  I need you to help me share my love with others.  I confess that I often expect something in return for the love I give to others.  Help me to love as you love, expecting nothing in return.  I pray that I will be one that reaches out to everyone, even the ""unlovely"".  In Jesus' Name, Amen.

Application Steps:

Practice doing things for others out of love, expecting nothing in return.  Ask God to reveal to you the areas that you need help in loving those around you.

Reflection points:

Do I ask God to help me love?

Do I love just those who are easy to love, or is my love offered to everyone?

Do I expect anything in return when I do something for a friend?  My husband?  My children?

What is one way that I can show my love for someone today?

Am I filling up with God's love each day?

Power Verses:

1 Corinthians 13:5 Love is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  NIV

Philippians 4:13 I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.  NIV

John 15:5 ""I am the vine; you are the branches.  If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from Me you can do nothing.""  NIV
John 15:17 ""This is my command:  Love each other.""  NIV

John 15:12 ""My command is this:  Love each other as I have loved you.""  NIV"

Then I heard on the news about the lady that was going to jump off the Port Mann Bridge so they had to close it down.  man, it's so sad I wish I could have talked to her or at least been there to try and get the cops to see if there was anything I could do.  I was shocked that we just heard about love and it's so true how people don't feel loved or anything and they feel that nothing is out there.  I wish people just knew God's love.  We need to show it more!!! I am going to show it through the way I am to others.  Then tonight we just kinda talked about The prayer of faith.  How we need to believe when we pray that it will happen and just not be like ""God, I understand if it can't happen or something"" But Be like God I pray that this will happen.  and let him to his will.  Have faith and believe when people pray for the healing of whatever their needs are.  We need to have more FAITH!.   Lord, teach us to be more like you I pray AMEN!

Anyways.. Just wanted to share that and yeah.  Once in a while though you might not have money.. go and treat yourself to a worship cd like I did.  It will make you feel better to just worship Jesus when driving. (though I dont drive, when someone else drives) :)"

He doesn't ask questions !!!! whoo hooo I loved that I didn't have to talk much to him about anything that I find unrelvant (sp?) to what he will be training people for.  He said that he doesn't call except unless he is going to train and if those few people don't work out than he calls others.  So I hope I can get trained and can work fast and not slow like he wants.  It would be great to have a job.  Sucky part to it is because I never had a job, nor a fast food job, it would be $6/hr but that's fine with me, any money more than I make now is great! so it's all good! :)

Yes Jesus take my life and make it your own.  When I don't have the strength to jsut come before you.  I give you it.  Just I repent for being the way that I have been and pray that you forgive me - time after time you still forgive me like its the first time i have sinned.  I love you so much ... Jesus THANK YOU.

"event","Well... back to my day, even more just weird events happened after the last post.  Dave forogt to bring food to cell group tonight, so instead we went to DQ and it was quite funny the person making my food was saying Jodi.  So, I was like WHOOOOOOOO! How does she know me! and she knew I was thinking that and she was like all those times you gave resumes into Burger King.  So I was like oh fun! haha.. but I am going to drop off a resume at DQ though she told me she can't hire anyone though I think she would hire me if she was the one doing it.  Whooo hoooo .. hopefully I will have a job!!  Anyways, then my friend called after coming back and we went to eat out.. however before then some person was over and slammed the door, while my mom was trying to sleep so my mom screamed from her bedroom, and then I went out.  My sister is missing somewhere and my mom is hurt over that - she has done this often, when she was 16 she ran away.  but she is 26 now.  Just please pray that she is safe .. it's not good for her to be driving right now.  Anyways, yeah so its been an interesting evening of good and not so great things.  But God is a provider for our needs and he loves us.  So just gotta trust in Him when the not so great things happen in our way.

God bless you!!

Nobody to bother me, except my sister and her boyfriend downstairs, but it's good because they just do whatever, and I can leave my music on and just relax - something I am learning to do more of.  However, the relaxing period just ended with my niece and  my friend coming home, oh well.  Things are still good! I just want to be able to be used by God in anyway that He wants.  I just can't wait for the future even more good things to come ... I'll just have to be patient and wait =)  The Lord has been teaching me many, many things about just what I need to do in my life.  First and foremost - just continue to trust Him because He knows everything and why worry because He is in control.  Control of everything !!! It's great!  I just can't wait to see what more things God has for me and everyone - I love just seeing people happy rather than upset!  Well, I hope that God has been teaching and just showing you more stuff in your life that He is going to do.  But will talk to ya'll later!!! Be blessed!!

Helped me just put things into my life that I needed but even more wow was today's services both in the morning and in the evening.  Jesus, works through and just yeah more unity Lord I pray.  We had church with the Langley campus for the speaking and 2 songs at 11am this morning.  It was great that we were able to hear Pastor Brent share his message over the liveVideo Link.  It was great.  and even more tonight just the simple message about ""To believe or not to believe???""  Just saying why we need to believe in Jesus and all he did is tell it like it is from the Bible.  The true and final word is God's word!!!!  I just am even more just giving what I want to Jesus, because he knows the desires of my heart.  It's hard at times, when I see a cute guy haha.. but Jesus knows.  I just need to continue to follow Him and lie down my will at his feet and truly give up what I want and follow what He has for me because it's far greater what I can even think of.  Lord, help and teach me how to keep my eyes focused on you and not this world or what I want.  But what you want Jesus.  I love you and need more of you Jesus.  less of me and more of Jesus is what I need and want  I pray this Lord from my heart Amen.  Thank you Jesus I love you!  So much blessings are upon me though I don't see all of them they are coming .. just wait and see!!!

Have a blessed day tomorrow.  Take care ya'll!

Anyways, it's been an interesting week.  However, it didn't end too well.  I found out yesterday that my friend passed away as I asked prayer for.  It's just hard to grasp it, since I didn't get to see him for 2 yrs because he moved away to Calgary after living in Maple Ridge.  I just know that even though things like this happen and people aren't believers that God has his plan and way for everything, so I just trust that God will do something great.  I am going to give his mother, a card so I hope that it helps her because I know how hard it is to lose people.  My friend and I went to a garage sale and the children of two older people were selling everything because both of the parents passed away which isn't nice to hear but I told them I was sorry, because what do you say when you just met the people and stuff.  It's been a year of just deaths for me.  I try and not be scared of dying but when you know about 5 people who have died in the last while, it's hard not to think where and how and just what happens.  I never will truly understand death.  I know that I am going to Jesus when I die, and I want everyone else to be - so I better get on fire for sharing and loving people as Jesus does, so they join me in Heaven when they die.  On another note... if anyone has a extra space for a friend of mine, he had to move out of his house because his roommate wasn't paying his share and my friend couldn't afford to pay both shares so he had to find a new place and can't move into it until the end of the month and doesn't have a home starting tomorrow unless there are people willing to keep him in for a day or two.  If you know of anyone that might be able to help.  Leave a comment.  It's going to be interesting tomorrow CLA Langley and CLA Maple Ridge are going to be connected by video.  We are going to have the first ever message talked from Pastor Brent in Langley and seen in Maple Ridge.  It's just all so quick and just yeah !!! I really don't know what to say about it all but it's changing.  I hope people are doing well.  I need to go read, and then sleep for church.  I am so tired tonight!  

Be blessed.

So many feelings, how not to feel angry, disappointment, though I feel happy and joyful at the same time.  Lord, why is it this way?  I just wanna know.  Patience is the key to what I do not know.  I need to just trust in You because you know all over all things.  You are the way, the truth and the light.  Lord, your working now to make my future just right.  The future that I am so unsure of.  What to do, what to be, where am I going in 5 years, a few months, or even tomorrow?  I will just let go and let You direct my path.  Because we never know where we are to go.  Lord, help me just remember that you are there in control.  Thank you Jesus for that promise.  Only you can promise me the world.  I love you!


Teach me Lord, that Mike is okay in your arms there in Heaven, it's hard not to cry when I hear the song from his funeral.  Lord, I miss my friend - his laughter, his smile, his caring sense of being there for others.  Lord, his passion for you and not caring about what others thought about him loving you Jesus.  Teach and help me have that passion and joy that won't care about what others think about me, but to only know that you are who you are and you are the final decision maker in my life.  What will I do when we come to met you in Heaven,  will I dance or will I sing, because we don't know Lord.  We can't even think beyond what we think we know.  We hardly know how much you love us, our minds are too small to truly grasp the love that you have for us.  Lord, show us how to love others as you love them, teach us Jesus how to be as close to you as we can be.  We will never be perfect but Jesus teach me Lord.  I love you!

I just don't know what to say it's just that God is so good and like it's not something that you can totally see but you jsut have to trust that it's going to be there.  Right.. our society is one that you have to see it to believe but why.  Jesus, you can't see but you should still believe.  He is the only way to the Father and heaven.  If you don't wanna be in Hell than you better find Jesus.  

Lord right now I just pray that your children's requests are heard and that Jesus you would do your will and way not mine I pray Thank you Lord for everything I love you Jesus.  I pray this in the name of Jesus AMEN!.

Good night!"

"event","Thank you Lord for blessing the car wash, I helped do for my friend's mission trip to LA.  Especially that it only rained a bit.  Thank you Jesus!  Jesus I pray for strength that I can get through the night since I am helping out at the church tonight, Lord let your will be done and just shine through me I pray AMEN.

It's been a busy day.  Woke up quite earlier thinking I would take the bus to where the car wash was but my friend needed help finding a top for this wedding she has to attend with another friend, then she drove me to the place.  It was pretty good, only had like 2 picky drivers but oh well, that's what you get when they care that much about their cars.  I didn't feel like getting changed though I was soaking wet - took the bus home and then changed at home.  Just waiting now to help the people at the church.  I really don't know what I will be doing there or what they need, but they need help, so I will go just to help in whatever it is they ask of me.  Though I would love to sleep right now.  I am missing out my show I like ""Perfect Proposal"" tonight to help, but that's okay.  It'll be on again sometime.  It's the one where you vote for the wedding and I voted I just wanna see if I voted for was chosen.  Anyways, have to go read... and then get ready to leave soon!

Take care"

You love us just the way we are - teach us and help us see that we don't need to change but we just need to trust in you, because you love us just as we are.  You created us and we need to glorify you Jesus.  Teach us how to be more like what you created us to be though, help us see people through your eyes and not our eyes for we judge Jesus, we shouldn't be judging others but loving them.  Thank you that you forgive us Jesus, because we fall short of the glory of you.  Thank you Jesus, I feel that I fall so short of you being able to love me but I know you love me.  Continue to be pleased what I do ... I hope I am pleasing to you Lord.  Direct my life and do your will not mine.  You know what I want these days, I feel that it's something coming soon but I just will wait until your will be done.  Not mine but yours be done Jesus.  No more serving me but it's all about serving you!  ""Overcome - Erin O'Donnell""  WOW!  This song that I am playing right now Lord.  Speaks of my heart right now.  You are always there Lord, but I just don't see it all the time, but Jesus I am overwhelmed by your love for me.  Just as the song states that when are words are not enough, to paint a picture of your love... Jesus how can we just show you that we love you.  Show us how to be what you want us to be.  Teach us Lord, I long to be taught.  I am overwhelmed Jesus with what you have been teaching me already.  I am just in awe of you Lord.  Lord, you know what I want in my life and I just pray and just ask that you take the desires of my heart and help me to be content in my life until you fulfill my requests that I can't fill without your help Jesus.  Help me to be content when being single Lord, because you have someone totally special no matter if I know him or not, Lord you have him already picked out and making us ready at the same time, so Jesus right now I pray for my future husband and I pray that you just would touch him and just be with him I pray against anything that may take him down .. I lift him up to you and just pray that you would teach him Jesus and help him know your will and way Jesus guide him I pray AMEN!  Thank you Jesus I love you and just thank you for dying on the cross for me, I will never truly understand why but thank you!"

It's funny how phones will just call you when they shouldn't or something.  Like one day, my dad must had called the house and than hung up.  But his phone called back and I could hear people talking and I just kept yelling in the phone DAD! DAD! but he never realized it was on.  Or he would get the answering machine and you can hear him.. hehe :$  Anyways.

Anyways, I pmed a girl who posted on there and then added her on aim just awhile ago.  It's just amazing how God places people in your life at the right time at the right moment, and just who are dealing with the same issues.  It's just amazing.  I won't share much, but WOW!!! Thank you Jesus, for people who are in the same situations as I am in.  AMEN!

Lord, I just pray that I wouldn't have a harden heart to non-Christians but you would teach me how just to love them and be a minister to them as you were.  AMEN!"

Sorry, this one might be a bit long, but lots of good reading'

Jesus is so good!  Like I said last night that I saw the Passion.  My friend, Darren took me to see it and WOW!! what a movie about Jesus dying for us.  I won't say too much however what I read today in the Our Daily Bread just really talked to me since it was a part in the movie.  Now I will always look at it as a different way then I did before.

""Pressuring God"" Read: Matthew 26:36-46.

Under General George Patton's command in World War II, the Third Army had been driving back the Nazis until fog and rain forced the troops to stop.  Patton telephoned a chaplain to ask, ""Do you have a good prayer for weather?""  Immediately the chaplain complied with the general's request.  He wrote a prayer, which Patton ordered to be printed and distributed to the 250,000 soldiers under his command, directing them to pray for clear weather.  The Scriptures teach us that God wants us to bring our requests to Him, and we can be confident that He cares and will answer (Philippians 4:6; 1 John 5:14-15).  But He is never obligated to answer in the way we want or just because many people are praying.  When the Son of God was agonizing in Gethsemane, He made His request in humble submission to His Father by saying, ""Your will be done"" (Matthew 26:42).  That Gethsemane principle ought to govern all our praying.  

The Father's will is always infused with infinite love and wisdom.  So instead of trying to pressure God because we think He's obligated to us, we as trustful children gladly commit to Him our desires.  Whatever He grants will prove in the end to be the best of blessings. - Vernon Grounds.

So lift up your heart to the heavens;
There's a loving and kind Father there
Who offers release and comfort and peace
In the silent communion of prayer. - Anon.

Instead of trying to twist God's arm, put yourself in His hands.


WOW! Speechless for words but have so much to say about this.  I will just let God speak what he wants you to hear from what I wrote above from Our Daily Bread.  However, I have learned stuff from God what he said above and will share it.

Lately, it's been a rough road for me,  I fasted for a week, which was good for me and is ever so becoming clear that it's not over though the fasting is over that God's works he started is just beginning not the end.  I have felt just down because I have wanted things that I truly am not able to have because of the way one feels, however I just saw the movie and read this today and WOW!!!! What a just better thought .. LET GO JODI AND GIVE IT TO ME.  In My will not yours be done.  Then on Focus on the Family was talking about being single.  One thing, I am glad they spoke of that the church doesn't do enough for the singles that they pressure singles into getting married when maybe that isn't their calling.  Many people in church try and set you up, they want you to be married soon.  BUT WHY!!!!!!!!!!! SOON.  if it's God's timing OK!! if not God's will - then we will have to wait won't we.  I have been just God why I am single, but that is because he wants to use me more as a single before He gives me another to work with for His glory.  He wants me to work in His glory alone and then he will add things unto me.  Lord I just pray right now that I would be content in being single until that day you send a guy that will just complete me and just fillful your wanting of me to be happy.  Lord, but for those that are called to a time of being single help them just be content in their calling.  Jesus, I love you and just am in amaze at your works and deeds that you did for me.  WOW! Lord, I am speechless at what you went through for me.  What a eyeopener Lord that movie was to me.  Jesus help me and teach me to see through your eyes and not my own help me to see and just be a servant for you and just to help people find you Lord.  Just be here I love you Lord and thank you for everything.. Oh man. Few words.  Now that song ""Let my words be few"" just isn't a song but a prayer Lord from my heart.  Lord, let us speak few and act more.  I pray this in the name of Jesus.  AMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!

Say what you want about what I write but I am speechless right now.  God bless you!"

""Unsung""  Read Romans 16:1-16.

James Deitz has produced paintings of airplanes and their crews that are so realistic they look like photographs.  His works hang in many aviation galleries in the United States, including the Smithsonian Institution.  On of the paintings by Deitz, titled Unsung, depicts a crew of four mechanics who are working on a dive bomber.  They are far below the flight deck of an aircraft carrier somewhere in the Pacific during World War II.  The pale, serious-looking, grease-stained men are working tirelessly to get the plane ready to go back into battle.  We too may be performing unnoticed tasks as we support the church's mandate to spread the gospel and train believers.  Without many volunteers, no church or mission agency could do its ministry effectively.  As the apostle Paul closed his letter to the believers in Rome, he listed several people who receive no other mention in Scripture.  For example, Paul referred to Phoebe and said taht she was ""a helper of many""(16:2).  Phoebe and the others were essential  to the life and work of the early church.  
   Are you working ""below the flight deck""? Remember, your service for Christ is essential.  Even if no one shows appreciation for your hard work, you can be sure that one day that Lord will reward you (Colossians 3:23-24).  - Dave
Egner  

Our works of service in Christ's name
May not be noticed by our peers;
But what we've done in love for Him
Will be revealed when He appears.  - Sper

No service for Christ goes unnoticed by Him.


WOW!!! Just remember this when you are helping your church and you don't feel cared about.  When I read this it was just kinda a daily Bible thing I did that day, however on ExtremePraise it was Jon or Joel (don't know what one) read this on the air.  Just when I truly needed to hear it feeling that I do everything around this house and just at the church helping them out and not getting seen, but I need to rememeber that I am not seen by people but I am seen by my Holy Father, Jesus Christ! that I shouldn't care about anything else but about what Jesus Christ will see.  Just remember, that it will be the Lord that sees you and not people.  People fail people, but Jesus never fails us.  So cast your cares on Him."

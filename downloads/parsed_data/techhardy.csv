"event","&nbsp;I feel like I had a really busy weekend but I really didn't. It is probably because my legs and arms are tired after helping my brother move a bunch of furniture out of storage in to his new fancy pants house.

I am putting some final touches on an assignment which is due up tomorrow and I have to show up to just get it looked over. I just wanna get it over and done with now. It starts to feel like it is always just one more thing getting tacked on at the end. Like an endless creep of work. I was hoping to be done with everything last Thursday.&nbsp;I am currently grabbing some software to finish up a diagram because I no longer have the required application that I would usually use installed.

The worst part is that all this stuff is really not that big an issue but it's&nbsp;persistence&nbsp;has just worn down my patience.

We started reading&nbsp;Twilight the other day. Four of us took it in turns taking a page each at a time. Comedy goldmine. It is honestly as bad as the usual fan fiction we find online. I am looking forward to getting through this, it really seems to hold a lot of potential."

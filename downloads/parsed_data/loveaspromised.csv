"event","So I&nbsp;had some crazy fraeking dreams. One was kinda like the one were Sean knew how to fly the airplane. But it was like at a carnival idk. And then I&nbsp;was at lewis house idk why, and he said we could get an apartment. I&nbsp;was super super happy. then lewis changed to evan so it was like me and evan were getting an apartment bc cathy wanted to leave again. So i was pretty happy. Then&nbsp;I woke up and realized everything is still shit. I slept horribly. I feel awful. I'm scared out of my mind. This is no way to live. In misery, pain, hatred, and fear. Someone save me. This is just a diary btw so don't take fault with it. I'm allowed to say as I&nbsp;wish as a means to help myself cope. If you don't like what i write, then FUCK YOU.

"event","<p>So last night was fun. UFC at my brothers. Everyone was surprisinly pleasant. The fights weren't that great but the social shit was fun. But I think I&nbsp;need to go awhile without any drinking. Sounds like a plan. And I&nbsp;haven't been eating lately. I&nbsp;need to eat. My stomach has been all messed up. Today I think I'm going to Sean's dads for bbq or something. Idk. Just waiting on Mere Bear to get home from Conroe. I miss her. She's been a little butt lately and starting to use my own tricks on me, but i love her. She's all I got. The one thing I&nbsp;managed to do right. Ok well idk what else to say. Bigger post later.<br /><br />--tara</p><br />"

"event","This feels fucking impossible. How am I supposed to do this? Especially now. Seriously, I haven't felt this alone in a while. Yea sure he says he's there for me but honestly he doesn't know how to be there for me becasue he has no idea what I'm going through. Lack of sleep and the consuming thoughts of &quot;how am I&nbsp;gonna sleep&quot; &quot;how can I be alone with myself&quot;? The two reasons I&nbsp;drink. I&nbsp;don't wanna deal with me, and I wanna fucking sleep. I feel like I'm breaking. I pretend that I'm ok the best that I can. I try not to fall apart in front of anyone but when I'm alone its a different story. I'm teetering on a fine line. Alone. And I don't know how much longer I'll last....

"event","I'm scared. Yea, terrified.

Alone? Yea. Alot. All of the time. Rejected? Please.... I've come to the point I have NO pity for myself anymore because I'm used to it.

After all the times I've said it in my head it almost starts to lose its meaning.

We are nothing but a waste. We do nothing but destroy and justify.

The scars are tearing open along my palms and knees. I guess thats what I&nbsp;should get for crawling back at your feet.

Maybe it'd be better if we were together in these moments. We're not though. We cry alone.

Is this what madness really feels like?
Is it the fear that the person looking back at you in the mirror is not you? 

What do you have to gain in running away?

"event","i want a boy...
who will love me for me.
who would push my hair out of my face to kiss me.
and would hold my hand to make other girls jealous.
someone who would think i was beautiful no matter what.
who would let me sleep on his chest.
a boy who wouldn't mind buying me bouncy balls whenever he had the chance
and he'd sing to me at random moments.
he'd always call;
especially at 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning to tell me he loved me.
he'd suprise me with 25 cent rings.
we'd have contests on how far we could jump off swings.
we'd go to the park together.
he'd grab my waist, and kiss my neck. 
and we'd always take pictures in photobooths.
we would play tag on the beach.
he'd tell his friends about me, and smile as he did.
we would be ourselves around each other.
we'd makeout in the rain;
with poprocks of course
he'd write me love letters, songs, and poems.
he would tell me when something didn't look good,
and i wouldn't mind.
we'd make each other mix CDs.
we would play video games together &amp; he&rsquo;d let me win.
he would take my hands and wrap them around his waist and kiss me hard. 
he'd run his fingers through my hair. 
someone to share lollipops and bubblegum with. 
he would never be embarassed to say, &quot;i love you&quot; in front of anyone. 
talk to on AIM about stupid, pointless things. 
a boy who would take me to Walmart to make fun of things 
and race shoppingcarts through the store. 
someone who will squirt me with water guns around the house. 
he'd love music just as much as i did. 
he could make me laugh like no one else could.
someone who would look me straight in the eye, and tell me something serious, yet silly, and tell me not to laugh. 
a boy who likes stars as i do. 
he wouldn't break my heart or lie to me 
we'd sing songs together.
he'd hold me closer than normal if i was sick. 
we'd buy disposable cameras in bulk and take tons of pictures.
he would draw me silly pictures.
we'd fight sometimes.
a boy who would open his mind up to me.
we would take naps together
and he'd tell me he loved me, and mean it."

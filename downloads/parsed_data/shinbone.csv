"event","Wow, I'm updating. It IS a sign of the apocalypse. But anyways, Sara and I are still going out. Which is a very good thing. And other recent things that have happened to me. I got summer homework for AP English, and I put it off until two weeks left of summer... then I put it off til three days left. I crammed so much that I thought my head was going to explode, but I got them done and handed them in. Alright, off to a good start. And some of my other classes are cool too... Pre-AP chem especially. (Because I've got Rohde!) I thought the first day was going to be boring stuff about syllabuses and stuff... but no! We jumped right into fire! (not literally) Political Science, I have a lot of friends in that class, but it's so boring right now. Hopefuly the discussions start soon. TV production has lost some of it's luster to me now that I've been in the class twice. I know NOBODY except for Mike Anderl in that class... 21 seniors, two juniors... I feel so lonely in that class. The only one who introduced himself to me was Marty Greye, but he has like 10 other friends in that class, so I'm not really his friend sort of. Which brings me to lunch, it sucks... the only people in it are Sara and Eddie, but he won't sit with me and Sara all the time. So that kinda sucks. Trig seems sort of easy, but I'm sure it will get difficult soon. That's all I have to say about school. I get my license in two weeks if I pass, which I will. (I keep telling myself that.) Then I can drive to homecoming myself, and drive Sara around to places, lol. That way we aren't confined to going to each other's houses. This is a long enough post to hold all of you off. Have a great day and a pleasant tomorrow.

Peace Out, Shinbone."

"event","Well, Dave P didn't show up at my house. And I just learned not too long ago they went to the movie anyways... thanks guys. I mean, a later showing would have been preposterous."

"event","Wow, what to say about this recent wave of goodness that has overcome me? Well, I can say one major thing right off of the bat. Sara and I are going out! I am so happy about that. And my informed friends know this. She's been to my house like... three times in the past half-week. It's craziness... good craziness. I finally got all of my work done at ""the office"" so now I'm back to my regular working schedule... free time here I come. Today, I'm going to AVP with Dave P, Eddie, and Krista. I would have invited Sara, but it was short notice... so I don't think she'd have been able to go/wanted to. haha. Anyways, I downloaded some Tom Petty and Steve Miller Band. I just feel really mellow when I listen to The Joker and Roll Another Joint. I learned how to play Breakdown on my guitar, and I also learned how to play Money for Nothing. (by Dire Straits) Other than hanging out with Sara, not much has been happening at all, but today the movie should be sweet. But Dave P should be here soon, so I should be departing for the 12:30 showing... that's all for now folks.

Peace Out, Shinbone."

"event","Sorry about the recent absence... I guess I'm what they call a procrastinator. Anyways, I left off before the movie with Sara. Yes, what to say about the movie. I had a really great time hanging out with Sara. And truth be told, I'm pretty sure that I really like her. So who knows where this will go? (I think that some of my more ""informed"" friends know) The good thing is, she's on my mind all the time. So I'm basically happy all the time now. (Krista and Danielle will enjoy that seeing as how I piss and moan to them, but thanks for listening guys) Yeah, other than that.... I've been working a lot lately. And it's starting to suck. (work suck? No way!) And now we're up to today, I went into registration at about 9:30.. met up with Eddie and we walked around for a solid three hours. But standed in line for one of them. After that he came over, we hung around not doing much for the afternoon. I'm glad I got to spend some time with him. Stuff between us has been very rocky this summer. But as we near the school year (and my license) I'm going back up to number 1. Not much else on my mind... except Sara... so that means not much more to write about. So, I think I'll be leaving. Updates coming later. (who knows when???!!!)

Peace Out, Shinbone."

"event","Wow, August 7th, been sixteen for 5 days. It feels like I've been sixteen for a month. Yippee kie yay... Well let's see, what to say about today. I woke up around 11:30. Customary for me lately. Watched Pleasantville until about 12:15... decided to put some clothes on finally. (I was home alone, shut up) Took a shower, and got all jazzed up. And left to pick up Danielle around 1:40. We got her and went to The Bourne Supremacy. It wasn't as good as the first one, but action nevertheless. After the movie was over we took Danielle home, and we stopped at Blockbuster. (I got Rounders, my parents got Runaway Jury) After getting those I had high hopes of going home and watching them, but of course... we're in town just in time for Saturday 5 o clock mass. I haven't been to church in a long time and tonight reminded me why. <yawn> Anyways, that's pretty much all that happened today. I haven't been thinking much lately. Other than that I'm quite nervous for tomorrow. (I'm seeing The Village with Sara) Hopefully it should be an ok movie. Although that's not what I'm nervous for. But anyways, that's enough for today. I feel as though I've written quite enough to keep you entertained for the 5 minutes or less it takes you to read all this. Good night and have a pleasant tomorrow, I hope I will. 

Peace Out, Shinbone"

"event","Today.... what to say? I didn't do much pre-3 o clock. Worked from 8-12... 25.5 hours built up for my paycheck. That's quite a lot for how little I work. But anyways, after I got home I sat around and watched a movie. Perfect Harmony, it's an old Disney movie form the 80s I found. Quite a lot better now then when I was 6. But then I called Jon, he said he wasn't doin much tonight, so he came over. We watched some Beavis and Butt-Head then decided to go to Best Buy. I got Scarface. (FINALLY) And right now, coincidentally, me and Jon are watching it. It's about 9 o clock, and he's probably leaving shortly. And I will be forced to spend another night on my own. Hey, at least it's Friday night. 

Peace Out, Shinbone."

"event","Bang. There we go. Now that I've got your attention, listen to my pathetic excuse for a life. Today sounds like a pretty eventful day. Work, and then nothingness. Like usual. I should really get started on my AP English stuff. I keep telling myself to but I never do, and this therefore sucks nut. But anyways, I'll get you caught up on what my life has been like the past few weeks. Well, there's been confusion, anger, and the occasional suicidal feeling. Yes, I know what you're thinking, ""Dave? Suicidal feeling? But he's always the cheerful go-getter!"" Well, blow it out your ass. I'm depressed. There's so many aspects of my life I would change right now. I'd change the fact that Eddie wouldn't be so mean to me all the time. He probably doesn't know it, but he makes me feel horrible about myself on a regular basis. Then there's Danielle. I don't know what to think about that subject. I really do like her, and she's been telling me that I'll get my chance at happiness... and she could so easily make that chance a reality, but then she says she likes being single. Which is like a knife through the heart type thing. But whatever, I'm just sitting here, I can't go for anything because then my friends hate me for trying. Then there's Krista, she's a really cool girl, and I wish she'd see that in herself instead of looking at the bad aspects. (Even though there are quite few, if none.) She's helped me/listened to my whining for quite some time now, and I'd like to thank her for that. And last but certainly not least, there's Adam. We've been friends since 2nd grade, but I can't help but feel we've grown apart. He hangs out with Eddie more than he's ever hung out with me. And Eddie is starting to switch over to Adam as well, so I'm stuck here at home wondering what could hav been. Well, I think this is long enough for an introductory chapter of my life. In summation, I suck, my life sucks, and I just wish it would either end, or cease sucking. 

 Peace out, Shinbone."

There is pleasure in seeing a loved one's face light up at an unexpectedly perfect gift, a feeling which can be addictive in that moment's fleeting and elusive quality. But a fake smile, ones that doesn't crinkle their eyes or make them glow from within can be just as stingy or disappointing as when you get a thoughtless or generic gift yourself.<br /> The price of a gift is worthless information. It is the feeling and thought behind it that makes it rich. <br />So, is gift-giving pleasurable or onerous? I think... you should give a gift because you want to, not because you have to because it is a gesture that can be just as telling of the giver as it is the receiver."

Maps, once made,
leave the impression of a place gone dead.

Words, once said,
anchor the fevers in the head.

Vows, once taken,
fade in the shadows of a place foresaken.

Oh, understand
how the mind's landscape forms from shifting sand,

how where we are
is partly solid ground, part head-in-air,

a twilit zone
where changing flesh and changeless ghost are one,

and what is true
lies between you and the idea of you --

a friction,
restless, between the fact and the fiction.

Beautiful. Brilliant. And all the other single word sound bites that could describe such a mind-blowing film.
With haunting music that echoes in your head long after the screen cuts to black and more twists than a city literally folding itself like a paper crane, this movie is a prime example of what real ambitious imagination can accomplish. No gimmicks of third dimensions needed, instead of reaching out to you, it pulls you in and holds you there until your mind spins as fast as the main character's silver top.
It made my fingers twitch with the urge to pick up a pencil and attack the nearest blank surface; with words or pictures, I don't know. My mind was so packed full of ideas and images I that stumble so much as walk out of the theater like I had just taken a hit of something spectacular. Pure imagination, pure creation --- what a fearsome and awe-inspiring idea to behold.

Recently hooked. Reason to continue watching? Auggie Anderson. Or better yet, the UST between him and the lead character, Annie Walker. With their forces combined (figuratively), they could make any fangirl squee so hard she'll loose her voice and/or pass out from lack of oxygen. It's adorable; it's fluffy; and god help me, but I crave it like it's a diabetic craves chocolate.
Let's hope this isn't going to be a CIA version of a ""Bones-Booth-just-freakin'-suck-face-already... and like you mean it!"" kind of relationship. UST is fun and a tad naughty, but 5+ seasons of it is just cruel, diabolically cruel. So keep your freeze rays to yourself. 

P.S. have you figured out what UST means yet?"

I think its a good time as any to explain my take on the saying<div style=""text-align: center;""><b><em>&quot;I drink the universe in a cup of rain.&quot;</em></b></div>It quite literally is true. Everything, from the rain that falls on the roof of your house to the skin&nbsp; and muscle that wraps your bones is made up of the same atoms present during the big bang. The universe does not waste and, in that, you are timeless and eternal. Everything really is connected if you only look close enough.<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>...</b></div>You are also timeless in the sense that light has a limit in which how fast it can travel. It takes 8 minutes for the light of the sun to reach our planet. Therefore, if the sun were to disappear, we wouldn't know until 8 minutes after it happened, when blackness suddenly envelopes us whole. The exact image of you now will take millions of years to reach another star and still billions to reach another galaxy. When you look up into the night sky, you are perpetually seeing into the past. The stars you see now are how they looked millions if not billions of years ago (if they are far enough). We, in theory, should be able to see the beginning of time; the closest we've seen come in the form of quasars (primordial &quot;stars&quot; whose make-up still baffle scientists). So if you really want to see the dinosaurs in real life and not a Hollywood knock-off, you just need to be far enough away from the Earth to catch those old wavelengths of light. <div style=""text-align: center;""><b>...</b></div>Is your brain hurting yet? Do questions of time-travel manifest in your head after reading this? Will you look at the sun with suspicion and worry if it's still really there, or if it is just a massive mirage that will blink out of existence within the next eight minutes? <br />The universe is profound, every inch of it. Be thankful I'm not showing you a picture of the size of the sun compared to the our neighboring stars; the earth doesn't even constitute a pixel. If you truly want a lesson in humility, forget studying religion, just take an astronomy course.<br />Only then will you understand the span and depth of God's power; his creation.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><img border=""2"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v635/muteddreams/Graphics/tumblr_kx0qvykpeN1qzr91ro1_500.jpg"" /></div><div style=""text-align: left;""><em>(source: unknown)</em></div>"

Watched the movie version today.  People had so much time back then, so little distractions. They were able to really focus and put their all into the things which they did pay attention. I wonder if that's why all the great romances were written from that time, or that their grand gestures seem so over the top that they don't have a place in today's world. 
Distractions characterizes our time as much as the internet, television, or cellphones. I do believe there is a point were your are too connected to too many things. You begin to forget what's important."

<center><b>...</b></center>
Like an hourglass filled with sand. Beautiful insides meaning the lack of aesthetics on the out, that you could only be one way or the other. Why is it that beautiful people are stereotyped as being cruel, arrogant, or manipulating? Like their beauty is the telling that shows they've sold their soul to the devil. Is good will rewarded with disfigurement or is it the journey to a righteous soul that leaves one so drained. The savior in a fire, a hard-worker who supports his family in spite of his health. But maybe it is that beauty is a burden itself on its bearer. That the stereotype eats away at the beauty within until nothing is more important than their outward appearance. Maybe it is the ones that <i>don't</i> realize their outward beauty that are the ones who can escape the hourglass paradox, since when you are blind, everything is beautiful."

<center><b>...</b></center>
Such an awkward word, and yet it can be found somewhere on nearly every alarm clock made.
My cell phone alarm just rang (don't ask why) and asked me if I wanted to ""snooze"" ten more minutes or dismiss the alarm. Yes, yes i want to ""snooze"".... and no, i could not say that with a straight face. I guess ""sleep in"" was too wordy to be fit on an inch long button. And so, everyone will continue to be snoozers, and snooze those extra five or ten minutes as their brains try shoo the dreams away... Seriously, shouldn't there be some kind of borrowed foreign word for this? Like kamikaze or something..."

My computer just updated and now my internet program refuses to work. My <i>internet</i> is working, just not the program to <i>use</i> it. It's like dangling chocolate in front of a fat kid and placing it <i>just</i> far enough way were he can't reach it (no offense...i'd be pissed too and i weigh the same as two big bags of flour). I really don't see what's wrong and it's starting to drive me way crazy. I need my internet to apply for jobs. FML.
<center><b>...</b></center>
<b>[EDIT]:</b> It's fixed now and, yes, it was the shitty windows update that did it (in the ballroom with a candle stick). Damn planned obsolescence and whoever was greedy enough to think up something that inherently evil. Why can't all technology be like those old Kitchaids. They could survive nuclear fallout for Christ's sake, fat chance that Vista could do that. Apparently not all things get smarter as they get older..."

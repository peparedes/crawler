"event","I was planning on writing a decent ""Oscar Picks"" e-mail, but I've just worked 23 hours in two days and I didn't have time.  Now it's early Sunday already and I'm tired, so here's a quick blog entry with some quick picks before the telecast.

Best Director: Joel & Ethan Coen, No Country For Old Men - Not even a question.  They've won every directing award out there but more importantly, their movie was just plain gorgeous to watch.  I'm still in awe of some of the shots in this movie.

Best Original Screenplay: Michael Clayton - Can't give this to Ratatouille because it's a cartoon, and can't give it to Juno because of the first 15 minutes.  So Michael Clayton sounds write...I mean, right.  Especially thanks to Tom Wilkinson's character.

Best Adapted Screenplay: Atonement - This is a hunch.  No Country is my pick for just about every other category it's in, but the writing may get overlooked.  Actually, overlooked might be the wrong word.  It might have just plain been beaten out by Atonement.  Especially since the book was supposed to be impossible to adapt.  That's what I hear anyways.  Inside sources...

Best Supporting Actor: Javier Bardem, No Country For Old Men - All but guaranteed a win here.  Chigurh was one of the baddest ass villains I can remember.  Maybe since Hannibal Lecter.  Hal Holbrook will be the guy everyone is rooting for after his performance in Into the Wild.  And he's a great one to root for.  But Bardem's character will be remembered the way few are.

Best Supporting Actress: - Ruby Dee, American Gangster - The supporting categories are always where the ""surprises"" come from.  I haven't seen Cate Blanchett in I'm Not There, but she's the favorite.  Blanchett is also nominated for Best Actress in Elizabeth: The Golden Age.  She should probably win something.  But I don't think she will.  Ruby Dee has the ""Lifetime Achievement"" angle, and Blanchett has already won.  Plus, Dee was pretty cute as Denzel's momma. A quick shout-out to the girl from Atonement too.  She was great.

Best Actor: Daniel Day-Lewis, There Will Be Blood - Kill me now, but DDL is the biggest lock of the bunch.  Overact much?  My hatred of this movie blinds me a little bit, but honestly...the guy doesn't have to be nominated for every picture he makes.  I would love to see DDL in a gross-out comedy.  ""I AM AN ASS MAN!""  Boom, the first ever Oscar for a gross-out comedy...it's that simple.  Give this to someone who deserves it...like George Clooney or Tommy Lee Jones.  Or Johnny Depp or Viggo Mortensen...

Best Actress: Julie Christie, Away From Her - Haven't seen this one.  And I won't.  No thanks to the Alzheimer's movie. But Christie is the runaway favorite, so I pick her.  I'll be rooting for Ellen Page this year, because I thought she was perfect.  Don't be surprised if Marion Cottilard wins for La Vie En Rose though.

Best Picture:  So once again, I've seen all of the nominees for Best Picture.  I think I'll rate them from least worthy to most worthy.

5. There Will Be Blood - This movie has given me a good amount of quotes.  And that's the only good thing I'll say about it.  2.5 hours of my life wasted, waiting for something...anything to happen.  And all I get is a Milkshake quote.  Most overrated movie since The English Patient.

4. Juno - But Jason, how can this be your second favorite movie of the year...and still be 4th?  It's simple.  I love Juno.  Thought it was great.  But it shouldn't win Best Picture.  In this case it truly is an honor to be nominated, but as a whole, it's not as worthy as the next three.  By the way, with that last sentence, I realized that I've officially become what I used to hate.  A movie snob.  Sorry.

3. Michael Clayton - Awesome flick.  Loved every second of it.  But it's a little too forgettable for me to name it Best Picture.  It's the type of thriller I'd love to see more of, but it's not as solid as the next two.

2. Atonement - Really wasn't excited for this movie, and it blew me away.  I thought the way the story was told (through two different points of view) was brilliant.  And I love that it's a love story without the Hollywood ending...although Briony kind of makes it right in her own way.  Plus, the tracking shot was beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.

1. No Country For Old Men - Easy choice for me, and probably not a surprise.  Everything about this movie was great for me.  The story, the characters, the cinematography, the sound...just plain great.  Props to the Coens, to Tommy Lee Jones, to Josh Brolin and to Javier Bardem.  Those guys played a great cat and mouse game in a great movie.  And they will be part of the Best Picture of 2007, as well as one of the best movies of the decade.

Gosh those weren't exactly quick thoughts...Oops."

"event","Once again it has been a VERY long time since I posted.  Almost a year to be exact.  But today I'm sick (got a bit of a cold) and I'm bored...so I came up with a list of my favorite movies of 2007.  Keep in mind I haven't seen most of the movies that came out this year.  In fact here's a list of movies I want to see (or will end up seeing because they are nominated for Best Picture), but who knows if I'll ever get around to seeing them:

Charlie Wilson's War, Gone Baby Bone, The Bourne Ultimatum, Across the Universe, I'm Not There, There Will Be Blood, Atonement, and The Kite Runner...

Let me know if any of these movies absolutely suck.  Thanks.

Anyways, on to my list...be warned, you'll probably make fun of me for a few of these.

10. Hot Fuzz - This movie was fairly entertaining at the beginning, but during the climactic chase/shoot-out scenes?  Well it bordered on brilliant.

9. Live Free or Die Hard - Say what you want, but I had a lot of fun watching John McClane kill bad guys again.  It's still funny to me that in Die Hard, he was a normal guy who barely survived walking on broken glass, yet in this movie, he's jumping out moving cars and even hanging from a flying jet!  Kick ass...

8. Ratatouille - What can I say?  I love Pixar movies.

7. Superbad - Lost a little steam near the end, but consistently made me laugh, as did another Judd Apatow flick...

6. Knocked Up - I'm loving these gross-out humor movies that are also kind of sweet at the same time.  Sure, I'm being tricked into watching a chick flick...but the jokes leading up to the final scenes are always great.

5. Into the Wild - One of those movies that left me speechless when it was over.  I wasn't depressed, I wasn't overly thoughtful about the movie.  I just wanted to sit there, take it in for a second, and leave.  An interesting experience.

4. American Gangster - I was way too excited to see this when it came out and that probably hurt the movie for me, but I still love gangster movies.  Especially when Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are in it.  And Common too.  THEY TRIED TO KILL MY WIFE!

3. 3:10 to Yuma - Speaking of Russell Crowe...  He was the bad guy in this one, to Christian Bale's hero.  Unlike American Gangster, I went to this one with no expectations and was blown away.  Great acting, awesome action, the kind of Western I imagine all those John Wayne fans would love.  Highly recommended to anyone.

2. Juno - Couldn't decide between this and number one, but thinking back, I wonder how charming it will be the second time around.  I had problems with the witty dialogue during the first ten minutes of the movie before it slowed itself down and became one of the smartest, sweetest movies I've seen in a while.  After one viewing it ranks above Little Miss Sunshine for me, and the Minnesota references don't hurt.  But it doesn't feel right as Number One...

1. No Country For Old Men - This does though.  Apologies to anyone who didn't like the ending.  But even that made sense to me in a movie that raises a ton of questions without answering any.  In fact, if you haven't seen this movie and plan on going, be ready for an abrupt ending.  Sopranos-esque perhaps.  Because if you're not, you might not pay attention during the final monologues.  The first voice-over and the final speech bring things full circle.

I spent hours looking up stuff on the Internet after I saw 'No Country' and it only made it better.  Amazing cinematography, lighting and sound (You'll notice it, that's how good it is.)  Plenty of violence to keep you from boredom (Chigurh is one of the scariest villains ever.  And his weapon is bad ass), and enough to think about afterwards to look for answers (even though there aren't any).  It better win the Oscar.

Until 2009..."

"event","So I haven't written on this site in months, despite criticism from the two people who check it.  I want to write, it just seems I never have time.  Well tonight, I'm bored out of my mind.  The reason I started blogging in the first place.  Boredom.  Maybe I was just bored for 6 months when I was really cooking there for a while.  Well, I'm gonna make this promise to myself, and to Lou and Tyler if they haven't given up on me yet.  When I'm bored, I'm gonna write about movies.  That's all there is too it.  The first step is tonight, just by posting.  Next time I'm bored I'm gonna continue my top 100 list, or maybe write about the Oscars.  Depends on what I'm feeling like.  Anyways...that's what I'm gonna do.

Here's my first little bit of movie talk, regarding those pesky Oscars:

Don't see Dreamgirls.  Do see Little Miss Sunshine and The Departed.

I still have to see Babel, The Queen, Pan's Labyrinth, and Letters From Iwo Jima.

Forest Whitaker was very good in The Last King of Scotland.

Sacha Baron Cohen should have at least gotten a nomination for Borat though.

If Eddie Murphy wins for playing Eddie Murphy, I'll be very disappointed.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: I hate Judi Dench.

I'm happy Meryl Streep got nominated for The Devil Wears Prada.  She was fantastic in that movie.  And yes, I saw The Devil Wears Prada.

You know what.  That's it for now.  Hope to type again in the next 6 months."

"event","It's been so long since I've continued my countdown that I actually had to chack my archives to find out what the last movie I wrote about was.  (That was #79 Kingpin way back in December.)

Well what better way to continue the countdown than with a Rocky Movie?!?

This is the second of only three Rocky movies on my list.  Rocky III is #91.  Rocky I is WAYYY up the list.  II & V aren't on the list.  However, let's just say Rocky V is somewhere on my Worst Movies Ever list.  Honestly, Rocky VI is being made as I type.  It better make up for Rocky V.

Anyhow, if you aren't a fan of Rocky IV, its probably because you are a 'Roid Ragin' Communist sympathizer.  You can talk about bad acting if you want.  You can talk about improbabability if you wish.  But dammit, IF I CAN CHANGE!  AND YOU CAN CHANGE!  ANYONE CAN CHANGE!!!!!!  Cold War subplots are AWESOME!

Look, Rocky IV is the second best Rocky movie for many reasons.  First of all, Drago is a great bad guy.  He rarely speaks, and when he does, its classic lines like: ""I Will Break You.""  The training sequence is a classic, ending with a bearded Rocky running up a mountain and screaming ""DRAGOOOO!"" at the top of his lungs.  Early in the movie, we are absolutely SHOCKED to see Apollo Creed die at the hands of the Russian in a truly heartbreaking scene much like when Mickey died in Rocky III.  That of course, leads to the classic ""There's No Easy Way Out"" driving scene where Rocky shifts into 31st gear.

But nothing compares with the climactic scene of the movie.  The fight scene is always the best scene in any Rocky movie.  And when Rocky manages to take the ridiculously hard punches from the Russian, even the crowd in Moscow starts to CHANT ROCKY'S NAME!!!  IN RUSSIA!!!  Amazing.  Of course, when he chops Drago down like a tree at the end, well, I'm sure I'm not the only one who gets a few goosebumps.

The Italian Stallion always delivers on the biggest stage.  Unless of course we're talking about Rocky V."

"event","My goal of making picks before the ChiSox-Cleveland game fell through, but the game's not even half over thanks to rain, so technically I'm doing this before any game has gone official.  Here are my picks with some quick thoughts on each team.

NL East
1 Braves - Until they finally lose one, I'm not picking against them.
2 Mets - Loaded with talent this season.  Always underachievers.  I think the Wild Card is a possibility.
3 Phillies - Jimmy Rollins is good.  Jim Thome is gone.  And they didn't do much in the offseason. 3rd seems right.
4 Nationals - Never forget that the Nats used to be the Expos.
5 Marlins - Another firesale equals another last place finish.  Just watch out 4 years from now.  Too bad for Dontrelle Willis though.

NL Central
1 Cardinals - The class of the NL.  No one else comes close.  Much love for Pujols.
2 Astros - Depends a lot on Clemens, but there is still a lot of talent here.
3 Cubs - Obviously, its all about Prior and Wood.  But you still gotta root for the Cubbies.
4 Brewers - Too much hype.  Will disappoint this year, but watch out NEXT year.  Can't wait to see Prince Fielder come into his own.
5 Pirates - Don't know much about the Bucs, but I have them in my MLB video game, so I can't pick 'em last.
6 Reds - It also helps that Cincy sucks.  Too bad, cuz I like the Reds.

NL West
1 Dodgers - Best team in a terrible division.  Could have won last year but injuries killed them.
2 Padres - Barely finished .500 last year, but made the playoffs.  A travesty.  Won't make it this year.
3 Giants - Barry controversy will bring them down.
4 Diamondbacks - Why was this team allowed to win a World Series?
5 Rockies - Remember the Dante Bichette days?  Classic.

AL East
1 Yankees - Stacked lineup (as always).  Damon will be hated in the Bronx by July.  But the division should still be their's.
2 Red Sox - Fading fast.  Big Papi and Manny are still there though.  That's good enough for 2nd.
3 Blue Jays - Spent a lot of money this offseason, but I just don't see Troy Glaus, Lyle Overbay and Bengie Molina knocking off those other two powerhouses.  Could help the West or Central get a Wild Card though.
4 Orioles - Only this high because of...
5 Devil Rays - Could sneak into 4th again.  But who cares.

AL West
1 Angels - Lot of hype over the A's, but this team knows how to win.  And they have basically the same lineup as always.  And Vlad.  Love Vlad.
2 A's - Never underestimate the negative effects Frank Thomas can have on a team.  Amazing how the White Sox finally won when he wasn't in the clubhouse all season.
3 Rangers - Apparently they are better this year?  They're still the Rangers.
4 Mariners - Long ways from the 117 win days.

And last but certainly not least:

AL Central
1 White Sox - Here's the deal...Everything went right for Chi-Town last year. EVERYTHING! Pitchers had career years, hitters were clutch.  They got a few calls in big games.  I don't see it all falling in line again.  But I can't pick against them because of this: They only lost Aaron Rowand.  And they picked up Twin-killer Jim Thome.  Hope I'm wrong.

2 Twins - Maybe a biased pick, but if everything went right for the Sox, everything went wrong for the Twinkies.  And now that the expectations have been lowered, the pressure is off.  Plus, this could be their best shot with Radke and Hunter in the final years of their contracts.

3 Indians - Pitching is shaky.  Plus, I couldn't pick against the Sox or Twins.  For the record though, Cleveland scares me this season.  Plus the city is bone dry...literally. (inside joke)

4 Tigers - Jim Lleyand is their manager this year...La-dee-FREAKIN'-dah

5 Royals - I have a feeling Doug Mientkiewicz will have a few big hits against the Twins this year.

NL Playoffs
Cardinals over Mets (WC) - Cards just too good.
Braves over Dodgers - Braves are weak in playoffs, but Dodgers are from the West.

Cardinals over Braves - See above.

AL Playoffs
Yankees over Twins (WC) - That's right, the Twins are the Wild Card. Sue me. They just can't get away from the Yankees though.
White Sox over Angels - Just a respect pick for the Champs.

Yankees over White Sox - You know I hate the Yankees, and frankly, I don't really like their team all that much this year.  But I think they're due for an AL title...

World Series
Cardinals over Yankees in 6 - First title for St. Louis since 1982.  They deserve it.  Plus, I will NEVER pick the Yankees.  Period."

"event","A lot of MLB columnists that I read proclaim that their picks are fearless.  Well, when I make mine, they will definitely be fearful.  Especially this year.  And especially because of the Twins.  I have always had a good read on the Twins.  Back in 2000 when they started to show life for the first time in 8 years, I told a few friends, ""This team is gonna break .500 next year, and they'll be in the playoffs the year after that.""  It remains to this day my greatest prediction, and I doubt it will ever be topped.

Well, unlike the Vikings, who I pick to (and sincerely believe will) win the Super Bowl every season, I'm never blind to the Twins problems.  They are the team I will love as long as I am alive and as long as they are in Minnesota (different topic for a different day).  They are also the team I know the most about year in and year out.

Anyways, after a great three year run on top of the division (and after three near misses in the playoffs) last year was the year I saw my Twinkies decline.  And while ESPN and SI and others made them the trendy pick to win the World Series, I knew better.  First of all, the trendy pick never wins the World Series.  That's why the White Sox won't repeat this year.  It's also why the Brewers, God bless 'em, will dip back under .500 this year.  Second of all, anyone who looked close enough at the team last year knew what was gonna happen.  Pitching was great, hitting was young.  You just couldn't expect all of those guys to flourish.  Sure, Mauer and Morneau are studs.  But they never had a full season in the bigs.  Neither had Cuddyer or Bartlett, or any of the dozens of middle infielders (or so it seemed).

Well this year, the Twins are the trendy pick to finish third in the AL Central.  I like having them back in that underdog position.  But I'm also fearful that for once the experts might be right.  And I don't really have any substantial reasons for it.  It's just a gut-feeling.

The two guys I work under got back from Spring Training not so long ago.  Well they love the teams chances.  They also loved being in Florida, in the sunshine, engulfed in baseball, and in that blissful state that is the Optimism of Spring Baseball.  So I just don't trust what they tell me.  I like our moves.  I think a few veteran guys filling in where we don't have youth is good.  Luis Castillo excites me.  So does Rondell White.  I'm a little skeptical about Tony Batista, but a lot of guys play well after a season in Japan.  And frankly, as long as Ruben Sierra isn't in the batter's box against one of our relievers, I'm VERY happy.

So where is this long-winded analysis going?  Nowhere really.  Because this team could finish anywhere from 1st to 4th in the division this year.  I've lost the feel for the team I always have a feel for.  The pitching will be great, but the hitting is still the question.  So is the team chemistry.  So are injuries.  This team can't handle injuries and that's what scares me about them.  The young guys will be much better this year.  But those old guys need to hold up if we want any chance at returning to the playoffs.  That's all I have to say about that.  My fearful picks for the season coming before the Indians-White Sox opener on Sunday Night.  And you can hold me to them."

"event","You know how high expectations are the worst thing you can have going into a movie?  Well, I had high expectations going into V for Vendetta.  I heard good things about it, read a couple of good reviews, was genuinely interested to see the movie in the first place.  Well, I was disappointed.  Not terribly disappointed mind you.  I didn't hate the movie.  But I think if I wasn't expecting it to be good, I would have liked it more.

V for Vendetta takes place in futuristic England where wars, disease, and fear led to a Big Brother type government where a high chancellor rules all, free speech is dead, anything criticizing the government is either destroyed or banned, and where curfew is strictly enforced on all people ""For Your Protection.""  Sounds fun.

This is probably aimed at America.  The high chancellor is probably supposed to be symbolic of Dubya.  But the filmmakers played it smart and decided to place it in England, because I don't think people would be too happy if the hero of the movie wanted to destroy important American buildings.

Anyways, the Wachowski Brothers wrote this one.  They also wrote the Matrix Trilogy.  And much like the final two Matrix movies, V is filled with WAY too much dialogue.  At times I felt like V was going to take his mask off and reveal himself to be The Architect from the Matrix. ERGO!  VIS-A-VIS!  There was way too much symbolism too.  I like symbolism in movies, but gimme a break.  Every shot doesn't need an outside reference.  There's a scene that juxtaposes rebirth by fire and rebirth by water.  (sigh)  I get it, stop cutting back and forth between the two.

The overall message is solid, I guess.  People need to stop living in fear and stop giving up their rights.  I'm just not sure I like how it was done.  The government keeps calling V a terrorist, and that is supposed to tell the audience that ""Terrorist"" can be loosely defined.  But are you cool with blowing up symbolic buildings as a way to rally supporters for a cause?  Without spoiling too much, I think the climactic scene could have worked without the fireworks.  It was the government that needed to be blown apart.  Not the government building.

Anyhow, this is a fairly negative review, but I wouldn't say this is a bad movie.  It was just disappointing to me.  It starts off with a ""verbose"" monologue from V, and some of the stuff that happens throughout the movie borders on ridiculous.  But it's a visual feast, and it does have a good plot.  It's just a matter of how you go into it.

Okay, that last line was supposed to be the end of the review, but I didn't even mention Natalie Portman.  My God is she gorgeous.  There I said it.  Even with the Sinead O'Connor look, she's still kinda hot.  And the scene with the priest...  Well I'll keep my mouth shut on that one.  I just wish she didn't have to use that damn British accent.  I AM SICK OF BRITISH ACCENTS IN MOVIES!  Even if they are set in Britain.  Oh, and if anyone was wondering I went 15 out of 24 in my ridiculously long Oscar picks.  But I hit every single important category.  I'm done ranting."

"event","I'm so happy I didn't have to work today.  I've been absolutely worthless.  Sat around.  In a daze.  Half out of it.  And it's all because a baseball player died.

That's what it might sound like to anyone who doesn't know what Kirby Puckett meant to me...or the state of Minnesota.

To me, Puckett was more than a baseball player.  He was everything anyone could ask for out an athlete.  He was--and forever will be--my sports hero.  He's the reason I'm a Twins fan.  He's the reason I'm a sports fan.  Without him I doubt I would be who I am today.  In fact, I almost guarantee I wouldn't be a television sports reporter if it weren't for Kirby Puckett.  I always wonder what my life would be like if the Twins were a 100-loss team during my childhood.  How lucky was I?

I met Kirby two times in my life.

The first time I met Kirby I was only 5 years old.  My mom took me to Robbinsdale to get his autograph, and hopefully a picture with the man.  This was 1988 by the way.  I already worshiped the man, and 1991 was still 3 years away.  Well, he signed my card...a card my dog chewed up years later.  And he took a picture with me.  That picture is at home, my most prized possession of many prized possessions.  My dad even has a copy of it on his desk at work.

The second time I met him, if you can even call it a meeting, I was 22.  Interning at FOX 9 in the Cities, I was at a Timberwolves game, waiting outside the locker room to interview the players.  Well, here comes Kirby.  All 300+ lbs. of him.  And I'll tell you what, I've never been so giddy in my life.  He walked by, some people said hello, he smiled back, and he was gone.  I clammed up, couldn't say a word.  Just had a smile on my face the size of Puckett's waistline.  The cameraman I was with asked what I was smiling about, and all I said was: ""That's Kirby Puckett, man!""  Afterwards I asked Sam Cassell and Kevin Garnett basketball questions without even flinching.  Kirby Puckett, the only man I've ever been star-struck by.

I always dreamed of interviewing him some day.  Telling him how much he meant to me.  Hell, my e-mail address has his name in it.  Now it will never happen.

It's a sad day for Minnesota, but I couldn't be happier with how he's been remembered.  Kirby lost a lot of his luster the past few years, but today showed that people will always remember him for those 12 seasons in a Twins uniform.  I know I will. Game 6 speaks for itself, and if you haven't heard my story about that night, ask me about it some time.  Bob Casey's introduction has been ingrained in every Twins fan's mind forever.  His stance, his swing, his leaping catches, the way he ran the bases.  That smile.  Those are things that can't be taken away.  My memories go on and on.  I cried the day he retired.  Today was more of the same.

I got phone calls from four people who are very close to me who wanted to talk about Kirby.  I went out and had a few drinks with a co-worker because he thought we should celebrate Puck's life.  I e-mailed two old friends I've lost a lot of contact with because I thought they might be mourning too.  I even called a Minneapolis radio station to share my memory.  They put me on-air, along with dozens of others for over four hours.  The whole show was about Kirby memories.  And they could have gone on for days.  My memories will go on for a lifetime.

Minnesota lost its icon today.  I lost my hero.  I've shed more tears than I can believe over this man.  This baseball player.

Rest in peace Kirby.  And thank you."

"event","2005 was the year of the documentary.  So naturally, I didn't see any of them.  I actually like documentaries, but I could care less about March of the Penguins.  Grizzly Man intrigues me, and I plan on seeing The Aristocrats some time soon.  But the only big documentary that came out in 2005 that I desperately wanted to see was Murderball, the story of the U.S. Quadriplegic Rugby team.

The access the filmmakers had in this movie is astounding.  They spent years with the team, following them from a loss to their bitter rivals of the north, Canada (coached by the Benedict Arnold of Murderball...a former U.S. Player who felt betrayed by the team when he was cut) all the way to the Paralympics in Athens.  Don't call them the Special Olympics by the way.

Anyways, this isn't just a movie about Murderball obviously, it also follows the lives of many of the players, explaining how they became quadriplegic, how they dealt with it and how they currently live their lives.  The stories are heartbreaking, especially that of Mark Zupan, whose best friend was partly responsible for his paralysis.

The film also takes us into a rehab center where one young man is trying to start his life over after a terrible motocross accident.

Honestly, there's not much I can say about this movie other than it's wonderfully entertaining, especially for a documentary.  It's also heartwarming.  And like any good sports movie, its suspenseful when the big game rolls around.  Definitely go out and rent Murderball."

"event","The Oscars are on Sunday, and I have been slacking on my reviews.  Which means I have to write about Hustle & Flow today, Murderball hopefully tomorrow, and then I'll be ready for my Oscar picks on Sunday.  Exciting times.

Anyways, Hustle & Flow was a movie that I thought looked HORRIBLE based on the previews.  Another MTV joint that tries too hard to incorporate music into it.  Well, apparently the guys who make the trailers weren't telling the whole story, because there is a lot more to Hustle & Flow than a few catchy rhymes.

Terrence Howard is actually nominated for Best Actor for his work in this movie.  I had never heard of him before until this year, when he seemed to star in every movie made.  He was in Crash too, which is up for Best Picture.  Anyways, Howard is great in this movie as a caring pimp who dreams of becoming a rap star.  He won't beat Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and he probably wouldn't beat David Strathairn, Heath Ledger, or Joaquin Phoenix either.  But the fact that he got the nomination in such a strong year tells you something.

Well, the movie shows how Howard goes about following his dream.  He meets an old school friend who produces a little bit and when he visits his home, he spits hot fire and convinces his friend to produce for him.  (That whole spits hot fire thing...that's an inside joke for all of you Chappelle's Show fans.  Who are the five best rappers in the world?  Dylan. Dylan. Dylan, Dylan, Dylan.)

Digressing...

DJay (that's Howard's character's name) works on more songs and with the help of his friend and the token white guy who can drop beats with the best of them...he actually makes a pretty good demo.  Well that was the easy part.  Now he has to get the demo to a rapper who made it big, played by Ludacris.  Luckily Luda (who was also in Crash...kinda weird) is gonna be in town, and the Hustler in DJay goes to work to try and sweet talk him into listening to his demo.

I'm not gonna blow any details of what happens next, because I don't like to do that.  But DJay boosts his street cred, even though he probably didn't need to considering he is a pimp and all.

And don't forget, during the whole movie, he has to deal with his hos.  One of whom is pregnant, one who is an absolute bitch, and one who is white (his big money maker)  Just a heart-warming, family-friendly story if there ever was one.  Anyways, I'm not gonna recommend Hustle & Flow straight up.  I'd say if you like rap, check it out.  If it interested you during the awful previews...definitely check it out.  And if you saw Get Rich or Die Tryin'...well I'd be surprised if you haven't seen Hustle & Flow already.

Until Murderball, I'm out."

"event","Well, I went out and saw the ""gay cowboy movie.""  That's the dismissive label Brokeback Mountain has been given by anyone and everyone at this point.  It's most certainly more than that, but frankly, it's not worthy of all the hype.  Is Brokeback worthy of an Oscar nomination?  Probably.  Fantastic images, great score, great acting.  But like so many other love stories, it just bored me to death.  That might make me sound like a typical guy, but honestly, what is the difference between Brokeback and all of the other love stories that get Oscar nominations every year and lose every year other than the fact that the people in love are two dudes?  Generally I see 3 or 4 of the Best Picture nominees every year and the ones I leave out are movies like ""Chocolat"" and ""Shakespeare in Love.""  In fact, the only reason I saw ""Shakespeare in Love"" was because it beat ""Saving Private Ryan.""  It had to be good right?  Wrong.

Anyways, this year I've seen all of the Oscar nominees and I wouldn't classify any of them as ""must-see.""  And Brokeback is definitely not in that category either.  Now you might think I didn't like it because of the subject matter, but that's not the case.  I would be lying if I told you I wasn't a bit uncomfortable during Ennis and Jack's sex scene, but I certainly wasn't appalled like most of America would be.  Strangely, the sex scenes involving women in this movie are much more graphic, but would be considered tame by most standards.  This isn't Halle Berry in ""Monster's Ball"" here, it's about 30 seconds of quick cuts that leave a lot to the imagination.

Back on point though, the reason I didn't care for this movie is the reason I don't care for most stories about longing and lost love.  It fails to truly entertain, and its depressing.  There is an emotional ending, but strangely it didn't work on me.  I cry a lot during movies.  But this wasn't a big tear-jerker for me.  Some people might disagree with that...sorry.

The best thing about this movie didn't hit me until after I read a review by my boy Jeff Makepeace.  While many critics talk about the lost love and heartbreak, Jeff pointed out the way the two characters handled their sexual ambiguity.  While both said they weren't gay, they both longed to be with each other.  Both men have wives and children.  But they live completely different lives outside of the mountain.  Ennis is poor, suffers a divorce, has a hard life, but has many caring people surrounding him.  Jack on the other hand marries into money, has a nice house, but the people around him are not caring.  Ennis could probably tell his loved ones, especially his daughter, about his relationship with Jack and those people could help him cope.  Jack can't do that with his family.  Yet it's Ennis who keeps his love buried inside and it's Jack who let's his secret slip and suffers the consequences.

Anyways, reading those couple of lines from that review made the movie more enjoyable than actually seeing Brokeback.  It's just another slow-moving story about lost love.  But the lovers are men.  Hooray for a relatively mainstream movie about gay characters gaining accolades and a pretty large audience.  But it's not this year's Best Picture.  Not even close."

"event","Wow, LiveJournal.  Been a while.  I miss you.

Before I begin, I just want to point out to my good man Boo Yah Jeff that I am a bit upset with you creating your own blog with movie reviews and sports information.  A rip off, sure, but you use pictures and that makes your blog better than mine.  For anyone interested check out ""jmags""  There's a plug for ya Boo Yah.  And know that when I realized I did not post a single thing about the NFL Playoffs...let's just say that I was disappointed in myself.  I work at a TV station and half the time I spend there I work on sports.  But guess what?  I've never watched less sports in my life.  It truly sucks that I haven't seen one complete Gopher Hockey or basketball game despite the fact that I get FSN out here.  Anyways, I need to stop venting, let's talk movies.

While I spent most of my day off at work, I did find a few hours to sneak in a screening of Capote, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman.  It's nominated for Best Picture (and Hoffman for Best Actor) this year, but I've been intrigued by this movie since I first saw a preview for it on apple.com/traliers.  Love that site.  Anyways, Capote is my 1200th movie.  Yet another pathetic milestone in my movie life...and for those of you who didn't know, yes I have a list of every movie I ever saw.  It was very difficult to compile.

Digressing yet again...

I don't know much about Truman Capote.  I've never read any of his books and I didn't know any of his titles other than In Cold Blood.  (I found out during the movie though that he wrote Breakfast at Tiffany's which is a starkly different book than In Cold Blood)  Anyways, the movie is about how Capote went about creating In Cold Blood, a groundbreaking ""non-fiction novel"" that made him one of the most famous writers in America.  Capote starts out by reading a New York Times article about a family being massacred in Kansas and he thinks it will make a good article for The New Yorker.  After meeting the killers though, he realizes there is too much good material here for one measly article.  He must write a book.  During this first act, we also meet Harper Lee (played by Catherine Keener of 40-Year Old Virgin fame...she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this role.)  Lee is actually a researcher for Capote at the outset of the movie, before she realizes she needs to get away from this project.  The fact that she publishes To Kill a Mockingbird doesn't hurt this decision either.

Well, after Capote does his fact-finding, he spends an inordinate amount of time getting to know one of the killers, Perry Smith.  He finds out all kinds of details about his life and finds this character to be fascinating.  As he writes his book, those who read early drafts are astounded at how good it is, yet Capote tells Smith he does not have a title, and he has hardly written a word.  Smith hopes that Capote's power will help him find a better lawyer and possibly overturn a death sentence.  Capote, though, realizes that the success of his book requires that the killers be hanged.

Capote shows how this odd little man was a manipulative prick not only to a couple of killers, but also to his friends.  The experience of writing In Cold Blood took its toll on him too, and he begs for his friends to feel sorry for him.  But they know better.  He is getting exactly what he thinks he wants.

Hoffman is terrific as Capote, and Keener impressed me yet again.  The movie is almost always told in a quiet, deliberate manner, but there are flashes of brutal violence when the murders are described that make for a jarring dose of reality from the sympathetic view that the killers get for most of the movie.  Anyways, I'm not sure why this movie was nominated for Best Picture, but then again, nothing really sticks out as ""Great"" to me this year, except maybe King Kong (which got robbed by the way).  I guess the lack of greatness is why ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" got nominated.  Who knows?

I would say if you are interested in Capote as a man, go see this movie.  If you have read In Cold Blood, it's probably worth the price of admission as well.  But if you aren't that interested, don't worry about seeing it just yet.  It's probably a good rental just for Hoffman and Keener.  But it's not all that special."

"event","Finally got around to seeing Munich yesterday.  It isn't at every theater our here which kind of blows me away.  Its a Spielberg movie for crying out loud...since when do his movies only get half the theaters?

To be honest with you the Munich Olympic terrorist thing isn't something I knew a whole lot about going into this movie which made it immediately interesting to me.  I've seen the pictures of the Black September gunman outside on the balcony with his creepy mask, but I wasn't clear on all the details other than all of the Israeli hostages were killed.  And not only that, but until I heard about this movie I never knew there was a secret team assembled to kill those responsible for planning the attack. So the subject matter was very interesting to me.

The movie is done incredibly well from many different aspects.  The acting is great, and as usual Spielberg is the man (despite War of the Worlds).  Some of the subtle things he does with the camera are astounding to watch like the consistent use of rack focus and the way some of the assassinations are handled.  But with everything this movie had going for it, it seemed to drag at times for me.  The movie is 2:45, which is actually shorter than King Kong, yet Kong seemed about a half hour shorter.

Its funny though, because I felt King Kong could have been cut down a little, but Munich drags even though I can't think of anything that should be taken out of the film.  All of the small details and discussions are critical to understanding the characters and ultimately the larger argument of whether or not retaliation is the correct response to violence.

There are great lines of dialogue in this film from so many characters including a member of the PLO who says ""Home is all that matters"" to the main character, Avner when the Israeli team ""accidentally"" meets up with the PLO and shares the same safe house.  Avner is played by Eric Bana who goes through a huge transformation as you may have guessed as he assassinates people with his team.  He is a loving family man, but he is also in love with his country.  Along with the PLO's thoughts about home, Avner's mother also tells him that Israel had to take the land they are on because no one would give it to them.  Home matters she says.  ""We finally have a place on this earth.""  There is also a man who supplies information who says that ""family is the only thing worth fighting for"" and he explains why he doesn't deal with governments by saying overthrown governments are replaced with new government that are just as bad.

And that is a big theme in this movie.  Those responsible for Munich are killed, but they are replaced, often times with someone more ruthless and more dangerous.  And whenever a Palestinian is killed, another attack on Israel is carried out.  Its a vicious cycle that seems to have no end, which is the message Spielberg is trying to convey.  The point is hammered home with the very last shot of the film.  ""When does the violence end?"" is a question that is asked.  Then a wide shot of the New York skyline is shown.  Far off in the distance is the World Trade Center, just far enough away that it remains subtle and doesn't hammer the meaning into your brain.  It's a haunting image that makes you think.  The Munich Olympics were in 1972.  It's 2006 and violence has continually been met with violence.  When does it end?"

"event","I work night side tomorrow...I'm not tired...why not update my LiveJournal?  And since I consider myself a half-assed movie reviewer, what better way than to prove just how half-assed I am than by giving you my Top 5 Movies of 2005 list?  That's right...I'm not even giving you 10.

To be honest, I tried thinking of 10 very good movies that I've seen this year, and I couldn't do it.  Had I tried for 10, Star Wars III or Saw II might have made the list.  I don't want that, and neither do you.  So here's the Top Five:

5. Crash - I've seen a lot of so-called ""thinking"" movies this year...Syriana immediately comes to mind.  But nothing left a lasting impression on me except Crash.  A great ensemble cast shares the spotlight in an interweaving tale of race relations in America.  Brutally honest points of view from seemingly every point of view.  And you can't take your eyes off it.  Good stuff.

4. The 40-Year-Old Virgin - Nothing better than a good comedy in a packed theater on opening night.  Except when you add characters you actually care about to all of that.  American Pie is one of my all-time favorites because of the packed theater phenomenon...but I couldn't care less about Jim or Stifler.  I did care about Andy and Trish.  Add some funny buddies, some gross-out humor, and possibly the most random (yet perfect) ending in movie history.  Well, you got yourself a damn fine movie.

3. Batman Begins - Complete redemption after the Batman & Robin debacle.  This was a perfect Batman movie, with some things we've never seen before.  The way Bruce Wayne became Batman was fascinating to watch, and the twists and turns of the plot were fun for any fan of the movies.  Great gadgets, great scenery, great action, and a dark version of Batman.  Can't wait for the next one.

2. King Kong - Sure I might be ranking this higher because I just saw it two days ago, but for a movie to live up and surpass all expectations after so much hype is truly amazing.  Read my full review for my full thoughts, but this is everything a ""blockbuster"" movie should be.

1. Cinderella Man - I can't wait to see this again to find out if it is still as great the second time around.  The story of James J. Braddock was one that this sports fan had not heard before.  Watching him struggle with the Depression, fight his way back into boxing and overcome long odds...well, that's what makes any great sports movie.  And that's why boxing movies are generally so good.  Russell Crowe is great as always as the soft-spoken Braddock.  Paul Giamatti is better as his friend and promoter.  The time period always looks good in the movies, the characters are great, the boxing is fun...and even though the fights aren't as convincing as some other movie bouts, it still hits the right emotional note.  Don't be surprised if it gets a couple of surprise Oscar nominations.

Honorable Mention goes to Sin City for its visual effects, Walk the Line for using the actors's real singing voices, Good Night and Good Luck for giving my Journalism professors something to talk to their students about, Downfall for showing Hitler from an intelligent German perspective, and A History of Violence for Maria Bello.

Dishonorable Mention goes to War of the Worlds for sucking, Jarhead for pumping me up with its previews and letting me down with its plot, and Star Wars III for ruining Darth Vader...NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

And keep in mind, my list may not yet be complete.  I have a few movies on my must-see list. Munich and Capote as serious contenders for the Top 5.  Murderball as one of many documentaries that interested me this year.  And of course, Wedding Crashers, which can't possibly be as funny if I watch it at home as opposed to a packed theater on opening night. But I still want to see it."

"event","The movies generally have two major parts of the year...the summer when all the blockbusters come out, and the winter when all the Oscar contenders come out. The past few years the summer has sucked so bad that people can't stop talking about how movies aren't making as much money as they used to.  Easy solution...make better movies. The Fantastic Four is not going to sell too many tickets Mr. Movie Mogul.

Since I actually started liking substance over big special effects and horrible plots, though (I'd say about five years ago), December and January have always been my favorite months to go to the movies.  One it's freezing cold, and two the best movies of the year are crammed into this little time frame.  That's why I saw Syriana yesterday, and why I saw King Kong today, and it's why I'll see Munich the first chance I get.

But the reason I used the summer/winter intro is because King Kong is like the perfect summer movie mixed with a terrific winter movie.  It's what summer blockbusters should strive to be.  Kong runs 3 hours and 7 minutes, which will be too long for some people.  I am normally not concerned with running times, but I was skeptical of this movie going in because I've seen the 1933 version. It's barely an hour and a half and it's pretty boring for long periods of time.

This Kong is so different though. It's 3 hours that seem to only take an hour and a half.  The movie is basically three parts.  Part One being the introduction to the human characters and their voyage to Skull Island. Part Two being the adventures on the island itself. And Part Three being back in New York City for Kong's rise and fall (get it? Cuz the Empire State...never mind)

Each portion works amazingly well.  To me there were only two parts that dragged and even that is nit-picking, because I wasn't actually thinking to myself, ""okay, I get it, let's move on.""  The two parts in question involve a dinosaur chase scene which looks surprisingly phony, but is still fun, and the second is atop the Empire State Building which is REALLY nit-picky, because I really only felt that about 5 minutes worth of it were overly long.  The entire rest of the movie FLEW.

The human characters are interesting and fun to get to know.  I love Jack Black and was surprised when I heard he was in this movie.  He does a fine job with the dramatic acting though, becoming incredibly hate-able.  Naomi Watts does fine as Ann Darrow, Adrien Brody does what he can with Jack Driscoll who we really don't care about, and all of the rest of the actors are bit parts.  But my God, is Kong awesome.  He is, of course, the character we come to see, and he is the character we come to care about.  While parts of the movie (like the dinosaur chase) seemed a little fake, Kong is perfect in almost every way.  If he didn't look so real, this movie probably wouldn't have worked.  His eyes are expressive, his range of emotion are flawless...he's just so much fun to watch.

The other main reason this movie works as opposed to the 1933 version is because of the relationship between Ann and Kong.  This has been said in many reviews before, but it's worth saying here as well.  The 1933 version is creepy because Kong has a crush on Ann, but she is terrified of him.  We don't care about Kong, so we don't care about what happens to him.  In this version, Ann obviously doesn't fall in love with Kong, but she recognizes him as her protector and she does care for him.  There are great scenes between the two of them, including the action sequences on Skull Island, but more importantly the quiet moments.  In particular, there is one scene that was the absolute highlight for me, where Kong brings Ann to Central Park and discovers a frozen pond.  It is such a charming scene...I loved it.  It's almost a throw away scene that probably would have been cut if Peter Jackson wasn't allowed to make this film at 3 hours long.

Anyways, the fact that I've written this much about the movie should tell you that I recommend it.  It truly is everything you could want out of a movie.  Amazing special effects and action, great characters, and a great story.  I went in a little skeptical, despite all of the positive reviews, but I came out a believer. Go see King Kong."

"event","Went to see this political thriller at the nice theater here in Sioux Falls...the Century 14.  Stadium seating!  The Carmike doesn't have it...but it's cheaper.  Also, the Carmike wasn't playing Syriana.  Easy choice this time.

Anyways, I'll try to explain bits and pieces of the plot, since it's so convoluted.  Matt Damon plays an energy analyst who makes a friendship with the potential Emir to be of Iran under sad circumstances. George Clooney plays ""Bob"" a CIA agent who is starting to ask questions when he should keep his mouth shut. Jeffrey Wright plays a lawyer who is trying to bring down some oil men and get others to higher places.  And, well, there's about a million other people in this movie with small roles to play in this twisting, turning plot where everyone somehow connects with the other.

This movie isn't as political as it has been made out to be.  I found it to be more like Traffic...just telling a story and leaving it's biases on the side.  You can't doubt the fact that oil is running out, and that many countries want to control it...there is no bias about that statement.  But when it comes to how the situation is handled, we see both sides. As an audience, we feel that corruption is bad and that details about big oil is shady, but through the movie we get to see and understand why corruption works as well.

Syriana was an interesting flick, but I wouldn't say it was a great one.  It's worth a look, but it's probably worth waiting for a rental.  The plot is so dense, that I had a hard time keeping up with it and I was 100% into the movie.  Any distractions and you'll be completely lost.  So watch it if you like the subject matter and if you don't mind thinking at the movies.  Otherwise, go see King Kong, cuz that's what I'm planning on seeing later on tonight."

"event","What?!  What is that subject line Jason?  Well, it's an acronym really.  It stands for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.  Duh.

I managed to see Narnia on my day off Monday.  It was a bit of an odd selection, but I had never read any of the books, I was waiting to see Syriana with a couple of friends and I figured that at the least it would be a couple hours of quality family fun...all by myself.

And I was for the most part right.  Narnia is a fantasy land that I would classify as a watered down Middle Earth.  And really the movie is a watered down Lord of the Rings mainly so it will appeal to children, lovers of the books, and of course Christians.

I read some reviews saying that Narnia was as Christian as you wanted to make it.  And I agree with that assessment, but its pretty clear who this movie is being marketed to and if you aren't a little kid who doesn't quite understand symbolism, this is about as Biblical as you can get.  The Pevensie children are called ""sons of Adam and daughters of Eve.""  Aslan dies for Edmund's sins, and he is resurrected because he had ""committed no treachery,"" thus saving Narnia.

I did enjoy the movie a lot, although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it unless you are a fan of the books.  The special effects are solid, especially the animals such as Beaver, the wolves, and of course Aslan, the lion.  But the battle scenes are tamed WAY down for a younger audience, and the children are not exactly thrilling to watch all movie long.  Lucy, the youngest is incredibly cute, but it seems that she was only cast to smile a lot.  The older children are easier to handle, although Richard is a terrible swordsman.  Oh, and those English accents.  I know that these kids are actually from England which is much better than all the horrible epic movies we've been seeing lately, but dammit, I'm sick of English accents in movies.

Anyhow, I did like Narnia.  The kids weren't bad even though I just made them out to be terrible.  The White Witch is played to perfection by Tilda Swinton.  And the special effects are exactly what you would ask for out of this movie.  But unless you are a big fan of the books, I would say wait to rent it.  Generally I think the theater experience is best for movies of a large scale like this one, but its not exactly Lord of the Rings and its not exactly what I think of when I think of a blockbuster type movie."

"event","Man...what a crazy couple of weeks.  So if you didn't know I am now living in Sioux Falls, SD, reporting the news and sports at KDLT-TV.  I moved out here two Saturdays ago and started work on Monday.  That was the day the biggest storm I have ever seen hit eastern South Dakota.  So guess who's out covering a huge snow storm and standing in the middle of nowhere like one of those dumbass reporters in a hurricane?  Yeah...it was me...the dumbass reporter in the blizzard.  Day One ended with me making air by about :30 seconds.  Somehow everyone was impressed.

It was actually nice not having cable or the Internet for my first week.  Kept me concentrating on the task at hand.  As if I wouldn't have been working hard I guess, but still...silver lining.

So since I've moved out here, I have seen some of the most random things I could ever imagine.  That's one of the perks of this job, but seriously in less than two full weeks on the job, I have been out in a huge blizzard (which gave me a chance to see some pretty cool scenery, like entire towns, and full trees completely covered in ice. Disastrous for a lot of people, but beautiful to say the least.)

Anyways, back to what I was saying.  I've been out in a huge blizzard, I've met a Native American woman whose family actually lived in a teepee, I've been in a cage with a white bengal tiger while it was getting a root canal from a human dentist, I've watched the demolition of the tallest building in South Dakota fail miserably, and to top it all off, I met and interviewed Manute Bol today.

MANUTE BOL!  I mean, he's not exactly a superstar or anything, but I'm gonna tell you this right now.  I wasn't all that excited to meet the man until I stood right next to him.  I almost laughed out loud before I asked my first question.  Let's just say Little Manute was at my eye level.  I can only imagine what people were thinking watching me hold a microphone high above my head just to ask Manute Bol a question.  I didn't realize how tall a man could be.

Anyways, those are just a few of my tales.  The others are pretty much all shop talk, so anyone outside of the news biz wouldn't understand, and even if they did, they certainly wouldn't care.  So yeah, SD is treating me well so far.  Good to have friends out here, I'll tell you that.  Otherwise I would probably go stir crazy after a couple months.

I'm sure I'll have more stories to tell in the coming months (years)...but for now, I'm hoping I actually have time to get to a movie or maybe find out how great the Sioux Falls night life is.  Especially on a Sunday or Monday night...cuz my weekend is Monday-Tuesday.  Good to be working though.  Finally a job I care about."

I've always hated that term, but I won't get into that right now.

We packed up the U-Haul today and had an amazing dinner.  Steak and crab legs.  My mom is a great cook, but we don't have meals like ""steak and crab legs"" more than once every two years.  I must be special.

Yesterday was Thanksgiving.  That was pretty tough.  We normally go to only one side of the family each year and rotate that with Easter, but since this is basically my last holiday at home for a while, we had to go to both sides which made for a long day.  I also have a very close family, especially on my mom's side, so leaving them was tough.  Missing Christmas at Grandma and Grandpa's will be tough.  Still the worst thing to see wasn't my grandma crying or even my uncle's crying, it was my cousin Ashley.  I thought she might miss me at Christmas, but she's a freshman in college.  She's not supposed to care that much about her cousin, right?  Well, she wrote some very nice things in a card for me and she was crying on the couch when I left.  That was pretty tough.  Then we went to Dad's side which is not quite as close as Mom's side.  Not usually any emotion there...sometimes anger I guess.  But my grandma, who hasn't said ""I love you"" more than five times to me my whole life started bawling and told me she loved me.

How do you handle that?

Anyways, today was rough too.  Packing everything, emptying my room, watching both my mom and my dad cry.  Hell, I had two visitors and they were in tears when they left too.

It's weird, this whole growing up thing.  I always wanted to work in television and I was never nervous about leaving home.  But its hard to say goodbye to the things you've known for 23 years.

The end of the beginning.  Let's do this."

"event","The second best bowling movie ever made.

Kingpin was made in 1996, which means I was 14 years old when it came out, and didn't get half of the humor.  Who did I see it with?  That's right...my mom.  Neither of us knew exactly what the movie was gonna be about, but the only reason I remember seeing this with my mom is because I still remember the sound she made when Woody Harrelson drank the bull's semen at the amish farm.  Horrifying for her I'm sure.

Anyways, if you didn't know, Woody Harrelson plays Roy, a champion bowler who lost his bowling hand in a tragic ball return ""accident"" thanks to Ernie McCracken played by the greatest movie comedian in the history of the world, Bill Murray.  To get back to the top, he recruits an Amish bowler named Ishmael, played by Randy Quaid, to take on Ernie.  Hilarity ensues.

Who would have thought that a movie about bowling and the Amish could work so wonderfully?  I suppose if you have a disgustingly creepy landlady (try to remember her for a second, I'm sure you will cringe), an incredibly foxy lass named Claudia who likes to distract other bowlers, and of course, a combover that makes Gene Keady misty, you might just have a formula that could bring in big box office bucks.

I just realized how many gross-out comedies are on my list.  I'm kinda proud of them actually.  They make up for the movies that no one else likes, like the musicals and basically anything before 1987.  As usual, I have no point.  Until #78..."

Honestly, who among us would have memorized every single word of Bohemian Rhapsody if it weren't for Wayne's World?

This is a nostalgic selection, as I remember it more fondly than it actually is, but still, with all the quotes in this movie, how could it not make my list?

""GAME ON!"" (bonus points for Stacy crashing her bike into a car)

""I don't even own a gun, let alone many guns, that would necessitate a rack.""

""That is a babe. She makes me feel kinda funny, like when we used to climb the rope in gym class.""

""5, 4, 3, (nod, nod, point)""

""Did you ever find Bugs Bunny attractive when he put on a dress and played girl bunny?""

and of course, all those catch phrases that everyone remembers.

This movie actually provided the inspiration for the multiple endings of my own masterpiece...the 7 1/2 minute long film entitled ""Witches, Witchcraft, and Other Evil Stuff.""  The film stars yours truly and Mike Hayes.  It got us an ""A"" in Greek & Roman Mythology class in high school, even though it had nothing to do with Greek & Roman myth.  Ahh, the good ol' days.

I love this job...OOH-RAH!

That's right folks, I have memorized the trailer to Jarhead.  I'd like to thank the advertisers who put all those ads on during the baseball playoffs and NFL Sundays.  Obviously, I had to see this one opening night after that barrage on my senses.

Unfortunately though, the movie couldn't live up to its fantastic previews.  It's not so much that the movie was boring.  It's that the First Gulf War was boring.  That's the whole point of ""Jarhead.""  Jake Gyllenahkafhfhsfj plays Swofford, a Scout Sniper in the Marine Corps (OOH-RAH!).  His partner is Troy, played by Peter Sarsgaard of ""Shattered Glass"" fame.  The two spend almost all of the movie bored out of their minds in the Saudi desert waiting for their chance to do the one thing they have been trained to do...kill.

The movie has a lot of war movie cliches in it.  The bad ass drill instructor, the calming influence that is the Staff Sergeant (played by Jamie Foxx), the vast array of characters, and the insanity that goes with being in a high stress situation 24/7 for months on end.  The difference here is that the war lasted only 4 days, 4 hours, and 1 minute.  Which means there isn't much fighting in a two-hour movie, and there isn't much fighting for the Snipers.

Instead, we see the Marines playing football, hydrating, field fucking, masturbating, hydrating, digging sleep holes, and hydrating some more.  The plot of the movie revolves around this boredom and shows how the Marines handle it.  Obviously, the most interesting scenes occur when something (ANYTHING) happens to them including a run in with some Arabs who have lost some camels, walking through a bombed-out Arabian Highway, and the climax of the movie...the one time that Swofford and Troy are called upon to use their training.

But those scenes come too few and far between for this movie to truly entertain.  While I'm sure it is an accurate portrayal of the events of the war (the movie is based on a book written by Swofford himself), it doesn't have the impact of some of the other war movies out there, including two movies that are featured at some point in this film: Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter.

The movie is free of political biases, which is nice for a change, but much like its lack of action, its lack of a political motive makes it less interesting.  I think Gulf War movies will be much more interesting in another 10-20 years after much of the history is forgotten, and after more stories are told about it.  And after the Second Gulf War ends as well.  Obviously, the way this second war plays out will have an effect on the views of everything that went on before it.

I think this movie is worth seeing, but I would recommend waiting for the DVD.  It's not worth the 8 bucks, and for a genre that always delivers (the war movie) that is a pretty bad statement.

OOH-RAH!!!"

"event","Ahh yes.  The sequel to the incredibly gory, implausibly mind-bending, but terrifically fun bloodfest that was ""Saw.""

This time, an entire group of people are stuck in a booby-trapped house that is slowly being poisoned with a nerve gas that makes those exposed to it bleed from the inside.  Their only hope is to play the Jigsaw killer's games and find antidotes to the nerve agent.

One of the people in the house is the son of a detective, played by the former New Kid on the Block, Donnie Wahlberg.  The detective and a unit of police officers and S.W.A.T. team members infiltrate the lair of the Jigsaw killer and find monitors to watch what is happening at the house.  The police try to get information from the killer, and try to find the source of the video, but the killer is a smart one and has thought out his little game.

You know what you're getting into when you go to see this bad boy.  You want some blood?  You want some mystery?  You want some interesting ways to kill people?  This is the movie for you.  If you want a plot with no holes in it and a lot of good acting, or if you are a bit squeamish, this might not be your cup of tea. In fact, if you want good acting, don't ever go to a Donnie Wahlberg movie.

But that's not the point, this is a fun movie in a sadistic, evil sort of way, that is meant to shock its viewer.  The plot is completely implausible, but we aren't at this movie for the story.  The twists are fun, but contrived. Who cares.  We want twists no matter why they happen.  I'm not sure how a feeble killer could possibly set all of these traps.  They are either too heavy, too elaborate, or too convenient to the plot.  But dammit, who cares?

Saw II is a good gore fest for Halloween, so if you want that type of movie, go see it."

"event","Saw Good Night, and Good Luck yesterday.  If you haven't heard of this one, its the story of Edward R. Murrow and his attacks on Sen. Joe McCarthy during the height of the Red Scare.  You couldn't call them attacks I guess, more like fact-telling.  The movie was directed by George Clooney, who plays Fred Friendly, the CBS Newsman who risked his career and his reputation along with Murrow when confronting McCarthy.  Clooney has said he wanted to show that the media can make a difference if they don't buckle under advertising and political pressures.  Of course, the risk is so high, that only the most trusted and ethical journalists, such as Murrow himself, can actually do this without getting fired...and even he isn't immune from that.

Frankly, I don't know if anyone other than my journalism friends (aka The Newsteam) would actually enjoy this movie.  I can't separate myself from the subject matter and give a fair review, because I don't know if this story would bore someone who hasn't been taught for 4 years about ethics, and the way news used to be, and what needs to be done to change the news and regain the public's trust.

So let me say this about the movie.  It's shot in black and white, which is perfect considering the time period and the fact that television was in black and white as well.  Sen. McCarthy is played by Sen. McCarthy in the form of old footage from the HUAC hearings and from his speech to the public about CBS.  Brilliant move.  Murrow used McCarthy's words to bring down the Senator, and now Clooney allows McCarthy to hang himself in the movie as well.  It's also nice because so many movies change historical dialogue and facts to make things more dramatic, but you can't change McCarthy's actual words and images.

Other than that, the rest of the movie is pretty hard for me to be objective about except for small details.  The subplot about two reporters who keep their marriage a secret works because it is kept to a minimum.  And the soft jazz music is terrific.  The singer's voice...damn.

So yeah, Newsteam...ASSEMBLE! at your local theater and watch this movie.  For the rest of you, see it if you are interested in the subject matter.  Otherwise, ask someone else's opinion.  Cuz I'm biased.  And that's the last time you'll ever hear this (unemployed) journalist admit that."

Like many of my favorite movies, its a different type of movie and it has some surprises that aren't so easy to figure out.  I knew going into the movie that Russell Crowe's character was insane, but when I found out his roommate was just a figment of his imagination...  WOW!

I wish I had seen this more recently, but I can't really say much else other than Jennifer Connelly kinda creeps me out.  Especially after that anal sex scene in ""Requiem For a Dream.""

"event","Purdue kicks a field goal with no time left, then beats us in overtime at the Dome.

Michigan comes back from 95 pts. down in the 4th Quarter at the Dome to beat us.

Iowa fans storm the field and tear down OUR goal posts at the Dome!

And now Wisconsin blocks a punt and scores a TD to win a game the Gophers absolutely dominated at the Dome.

I've never been a college football fan, and I'm the first one to admit that the Gopher football team is my ultimate bandwagon team.  I don't care about them until Big Ten season starts, they get me excited with big wins, they get me pissed with the most stunning losses imaginable, and then I stop caring again right afterward.  They are the only team that can do that.  Those losses don't linger, and the wins don't stay in my mind either.  But dammit, will this team ever manage to win the Big Ten?  I know too many people who bleed maroon and gold.  Whose mood shifts with the team.  And despite their constant optimism, the Gophers continue to disappoint in the most unbelievable ways.

I don't know where I'm going with this, but I just want to put down on electronic paper my list of Minnesota teams in order of favorite to least favorite.  You can hold me to this if you want, but to those of you who say I'm a bandwagon jumper, I will gladly admit to it with Gopher Football.  I've only been on twice my whole life.  Before the Michigan meltdown game at the Dome and before this week's game against Wisconsin.  Both times I hopped off after one week.

1) Twins - My sports wife.  I love them unconditionally.  From the wonderful World Series years to the horrific run from 1993-1999 to the 2001 renaissance, they will always be the team I live and die with.  If the legislature doesn't build them a stadium with the deal they've got now, they might move, and I might never be the same.

2) Vikings - My sports mistress.  I feel like I'm cheating on the Twins when football season starts because I get so excited on Sundays.  Football does that to me...and most of the nation really.  The Vikings are Minnesota's team, even though they always disappoint and will continue to do so until there is some stability in the front office.  My worst sports memory was the Falcons game in '98, but even seeing the Vikes blow up every year can't convince me that they won't win the Super Bowl NEXT YEAR!!! (And for the record, I'm not ignoring the sex scandal, I just don't want to talk about it right now.)

3) Gopher Hoops - Fell in love with them in the Bobby Jackson years (the ones that didn't happen...remember them?) Had season tickets for three straight years while attending the 'U' and flew out to Charlotte to watch them play in the NCAAs for the first time since Clem.  When ""The Barn"" is rockin' there isn't a better place to watch sports in Minnesota. My favorite Gopher team even though the rest of the state prefers...

4) Gopher Puck - I wasn't into hockey as a kid which is probably the reason they aren't ahead of the Hoops team, but my eyes were opened to hockey thanks to this team.  Mariucci is truly magical and the back-to-back titles are the only wins Minnesota has seen since the Twins.  Still, the season is too damned long.

5) Wild - Sorry guys...you haven't been playing long enough.  But that playoff run was more fun than I could have ever imagined.  And the X is amazing.

6) Gopher Football - We've talked about them.  I think a new stadium would really help them out, but they should be 3rd in line.  Let's play a game.  Of the Twins, Vikings, or Gophers, which one can't be sold and leave the state?  Now...of those three teams, which one will get a stadium it doesn't need?

7) Wolves - This is more of a statement about the NBA than it is about the Wolves.  I just can't get excited about it and the playoffs are way too long.  Unlike the NHL, the underdog rarely has a chance in the playoffs and frankly, the timeouts and free throws kill any drama.  The fact that I watched their entire playoff run in 2003 and never got really excited tells me that the Wolves and the NBA aren't for me. I'll take March Madness any day.

So that's my list.  The Gopher Women aren't on their just yet only because I want to know if they were a fad.  If they can keep my interest after Whalen and McCarville they will hop onto the list.  Until then, there are only 7 teams.  Oh, and uh, Buck the Fadgers."

"event","I feel the need to update, so I'll continue my Top 100 countdown with a movie that I know absolutely none of you have seen...""City Lights.""

This is the only silent movie on my list and for good reason.  I have a hard time watching silent movies.  In fact, I've only seen about 6 or 7 total.  The only reason I even watched this one was because it was on AFI's list of the best movies of the century.

It stars Charlie Chaplin as his usual character, The Tramp.  He is a bum, living on the street who always finds himself in funny situations in all of the movies he appears in.  The Tramp is a funny character, and while I don't particularly care for silent films, other Chaplin movies I've seen such as ""The Gold Rush"" and ""Modern Times"" made me laugh a few times each.

""City Lights"" is different though.  This one isn't just about the funny situations.  This one has a heart too and that's why I enjoyed it enough to put it on this list.

The story centers around The Tramp's relationship with a blind girl in his neighborhood.  He falls in love with her early in the story and shows that he would do anything to win her over.  One night, The Tramp makes friends with a drunken millionaire who not only doesn't recognize The Tramp when he sobers up, but quickly throws him back out on the street.  When The Tramp runs into the millionaire while he is drunk again, the millionaire gives The Tramp a lot of money before sobering up and realizing what he has done.  The Tramp decides to use this money to pay for an operation that will restore the blind girl's vision.  Of course, she assumes he is rich, and when she sees him later, she has no idea that this bum could have paid for her surgery.  Eventually, she realizes that The Tramp is the one and the two live happily ever after.

That is a terrible synopsis, but I assure you the story is great.  The thing about silent movies is that they have to get their point across almost solely through facial expressions.  I can't do justice to the scene where the blind girl realizes that The Tramp was the one who paid for her operation.  The scene actually had me welling up with tears.  Add the usual Chaplin barrage of comedy to the emotion in the movie, and you truly have a classic.

I recommend this to anyone.  Hopefully you have seen one or more silent movies before you see this one, if only to appreciate how great it really is.  But that is definitely not a prerequisite.  Just sit back and enjoy this one.  Trust me."

"event","Saw ""A History of Violence"" last night.  What a strange, strange movie.

It stars Viggo Mortenson as Tom Stalls, who is a small town, soft-spoken family man.  When two criminals threaten to rob his diner and rape one of his waitresses, Stalls springs into action killing them both and becoming a local hero.  His face is all over the news, which brings a few shady characters into town.  Ed Harris is Carl Fogarty, the one-eyed dude from the previews.  He believes Tom is actually Joey Cusack, a former mobster who has some business back home in Philly.  Tom denies this, and from there, the movie progresses.  Is Tom really who he says he is, or is he this mobster?  For most of the movie, you are left guessing.  Eventually though, there has to be a resolution, and we find out the truth.  Before we find out though, the movie shows us the repercussions of this news on Tom's family.  Tom's family starts to doubt his identity, and his loving wife feels she doesn't know the man she married. The movie is mostly about how these people deal with identity...from Tom to his son to his wife to the mobsters.

This is like some weird, mind-bending movie with all sorts of different types of genres all rolled into one.  We're talking drama, romance, unintentional comedy, action, mob movie, porno...yes porno, EVERYTHING!

Unfortunately, all of those things aren't supposed to mix and match.  Unintentional comedy only works when a movie is so bad it's good.  In a movie like this, it is out of place and helps ruin the movie.  For example, Tom's son is being hounded by a high school bully.  Normally this isn't too unbelievable, but in an early scene, we are led to believe the bully wants to kick his ass because he CAUGHT A POP FLY IN GYM CLASS!!!  The dialogue in these early scenes borders on terrible, especially when the bully is involved.

Anyways, the movie picks up steam as the violent parts of the movie arrive...and boy are they violent.  Make no mistake about that.  But its pace ends so abruptly, and with so little resolution, that my opinion of this movie couldn't possibly recover.  The movie is only an hour and a half long and should have been extended at least 15 more minutes if you ask me.  And I'm not the only one, a dude in front of me at the theater actually booed when the credits started to roll.

But there are good parts to the movie, which leads me to a rental recommendation.  If anything, fellas, see the movie for the violence and the amazing Maria Bello.  She is one of the sexiest actresses out there.  And by sexy, I don't necessarily mean hot.  She is hot, but hot is hot. Sexy...now that's different.  Let's just say the two sex scenes in the movie are intriguing.  Both because of Bello and because of when and why they happen.

That's all I got for this one.  Its disappointing if you had high hopes like me.  But go rent it in a few months if you still want to see it."

Its almost October, and I'm still in ""summer vacation"" mode.  Obviously its because I've graduated, but it still seems like an ordinary summer.  I want to go back to school just for the bar scene and to live amongst people my age again.

I wonder if I'll still be playing video games when I'm 50.  I also wonder if I will have the urge to throw my controller against the wall when I'm 50.

Nothing is more depressing than watching your peers move on while you are stuck in a rut.  I tell myself over and over that it I haven't been waiting that long for a job considering my field and the fact that sports is so much smaller than general news.  But attending going-away parties isn't fun anymore, especially when those parties keep getting smaller because so many people can't be there due to the fact that they are already working.

Part-time jobs suck.

This is the first year since 2001 that the Twins haven't made the playoffs.  Normally I am so filled with pennant fever I actually lose sleep.  This year, I just can't get excited.  The Twins were so disappointing.  Even when they were losing 90+ games a season, I was juiced for the playoffs.  Now I'm wondering if the Vikes can win the division at 7-9.  I'm also wondering if the Wild will win 5 Stanley Cups before the Vikings win 1 Super Bowl.  Based on the new revenue system in the NHL, I wouldn't be surprised if the Wild won a Cup in the next 5 years.  It ain't happenin' this year though.

This ""Lost"" show is way too confusing.  I watched a few episodes last season and got caught up on the show thanks to my dad and a few friends who watch it.  This show could last 10 years and nothing could get solved.  I swear, if they end the show by saying the people are all dead or in some kind of story or something...  Why am I worried about this when its only Season 2?  And why did I just add a show to my ""must watch"" list when I already have Survivor and sports?  I'm dropping 24. That's the only solution.

Anybody watch the Amazing Race on Tuesday?  I was channel surfing and ended up watching the intro.  This season, its a bunch of families, so they are introducing them very quickly like they always do, you know...the people turn to the camera and smile, and a super comes up and it says ""Smith Family.""  Then it goes to the ""Johnson Family.""  And then something happened that made me laugh out loud for nearly a full minute...The only black family on the show was introduced, and they are...The ""Black Family.""  How does that happen?!?  That has to be the most unintentionally degrading thing I've ever seen.  Of course, I'm the one who finds it hilarious, so maybe that says something about me.  Who knows?  I wonder if the producers thought about casting another family based solely on their name.  Anyways, I caught the end of the show too, and sadly the Black Family lost.  That meant I only only got to hear the host say these words one time: And I quote... ""Black Family...you're the last team to arrive.""

Every NFL color commentator is doing a terrible John Madden impersonation.  In fact, guys like Brian Baldinger and Bill Maas actually make me want to listen to John Madden.  Why can't these guys start emulating Troy Aikman or even Phil Simms.  Simms speaks too slow, but at least he doesn't talk to me like I'm 5 years old and hard of hearing.  ""Let me show ya somethin'!!! Watch This!!!  His Motor's Always Runnin'!!! That's Why He's a Playmaker Who Makes Plays!!!""

Fantasy Football makes the NFL so much more interesting.  There's a reason I watch 4 games a week and it ain't cuz I care who wins the Giants-Chargers game.

If Sioux Falls and Wausau pass me up for a job, who wants to hire me to be their personal assistant while I search for employment in Wyoming?

Jeff Grayson will be unemployed as of this Friday night after 12 years at FOX9.  I'll be at his going-away party which will be a lot different than the other going-away parties I've been too recently.  Last few parties: ""Hey Congrats on your new job (insert name here)!""  Grayson's Party: ""Hey Jeff...can I still list you as a reference on my resume?""  By the way, FOX's explanation for letting his contract expire is this: ""We want someone who will break more sports stories.""  Now, I consider myself to be a fairly knowledgeable guy when it comes to sports, and if my years of television-watching experience have taught me anything its this:  FOX 9 ain't breakin' no sports stories.  No information leaks out of Pro sports or Big Ten sports unless its going out to someone from ESPN.  And most of the time, that information is false just to build publicity or get the fan base excited about possible trades.  So unless FOX 9 breaks some story about illegal recruiting at Totino-Grace High School, they ain't breakin' shit.  Oh, and if they do get something important like say, the Clem Haskins scandal that wiped away our Final Four...NEWS WILL SWOOP IN AND TAKE IT ANYWAY!!!  ""Sorry new guy, we're gonna let this reporter who can't pronounce our head coaches name take this one...you go read some highlights.  By the way how many points did the Twins win by last night?""

I'm quite bitter towards Local TV News right now.

I'm finally enjoying Bob Dylan and the experience borders on religious.  I actually feel like a better person because I understand Dylan's music.  Or at least try to fully comprehend it.

"event","Behold my dorkiness!  Yeah, I'm a LOTR fan.  I like Star Wars too.  WHAT?!?

Let's just say this, no movie has ever been made on a bigger scale with a bigger risk, resulting in a bigger payoff than Lord of the Rings.  Not Gone With the Wind.  Not Lawrence of Arabia.  Not even the classic epic Waterworld, OH NO!!!  Nothing compares with the scale of Lord of the Rings.

So what else makes these three (I consider them one) movies so special other than the scale.  How about this:

1) Getting away with English accents for 10 hours without being annoying

2) A computer generated character that worked so well people talked about the actor who portrayed him being a sleeper Oscar nominee.  (Note: Not Jar Jar Binks folks...I'm talkin' Gollum/Smeagol here)

3) Worlds and battles that are as exciting and marvelous as anything ever seen on the big screen

4) An amazing ensemble cast that all stole their own scenes when necessary and also gave way when others needed to shine.

and most importantly...

5) Making Sam and Frodo ""more than friends"" and still being beloved by both Red and Blue states combined.

Let's just say that I've never looked at my best friends like that before.  Nor have I told a drunken, passed out friend...""Mr. Frodo, it's your Rab!""  Then again, I've never traveled to the depths of Mordor to save the world while carrying the Ring of Power...so who knows, maybe I WOULD look at my best friend that way if those were the circumstances.

Anyhow, I don't buy DVDs without weighing how they will look in my collection.  Nor do I buy them without KNOWING I will watch them many times over.  I didn't take much time thinking about The LOTR Trilogy.  Although if I had to do it over again, I would have waited for the Extended Version of ""Fellowship"" so I didn't buy all three Theatrical Versions instead.

P.S. As far as my DVD collection goes, I make no excuses for any movie I personally purchased, although if you ever see it, know this:  ""Beyond the Mat"" and ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie"" were both free."

"event","Drove a truck down to Iowa on Tuesday for my part-time job, and since I had to spend a night in the small town of Grinnell, I ended up renting a couple of movies.

The first one I watched was ""Crash,"" which was released earlier this year and just came out on DVD.  Its got an amazing cast including Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Terence Howard, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Ryan Phillipe, Larenz Tate, Ludacris (who does a fine job by the way) and many, many more.

It's about a series of events in L.A., showing how people of different races feel about each other and how they react to each other.  I was hoping this movie wasn't going to preach to me about how everyone inherently is racist.  It comes close to doing just that, but provides interesting enough snippets of these characters to stay above preaching level and actually be compelling.  There isn't a set story here, just a series of events, often coincidences really, that bring the lives of these characters ""crash""ing together.

Every scene in this movie has a purpose, usually to show the character of these people.  And it all works surprisingly well for how much it jumps around.  I can't possibly blow any of the storylines here for you, since many of them are surprising or conclude in a way that make you think.

This movie is powerful because of the way it shows its characters in different lights.  Matt Dillon is a racist cop, but he is a caring son who wants the best for his ailing father.  He is also an abuser of his own power, yet he is still willing put his life on the line to help people (which also provides for the best scene in the movie if you ask me).  Ryan Phillipe plays Dillon's partner who cannot stand to work with this man, but is not above making a mistake because of another man's skin color.  Everyone is involved, no one is innocent, from Persian store owners (don't call Iranians Arabs by the way, there's a difference) to Latino locksmiths, white, black, asian, and every other color of the rainbow.

I recommend this one if you are in the mood for a serious movie.  It will surprise you and make you think, and although you might find it preachy, you might also find it enlightening.  All of these people have preconceived notions about other races, but they are also willing to talk about their views and possibly change them if the right events happen at the right times.

Now...

Let me tell you about Alien, which I had not seen up until now.  What a disappointment.  Incredibly slow, not enough of the Alien, and filled with boring characters including Ripley.  I've heard that Aliens is much better, so I will eventually give that a chance, but this movie was incredibly disappointing for me.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that I knew how the Alien hatches from its egg and attaches to a face and explodes out of a stomach, but I think it had more to do with the slow pace.  There were a few thrills and the suspense was surprisingly palpable (nice word, eh?) for a movie made in 1979, but still...

Anyhow, I'm the last guy in the world to see this movie, so who cares?

Couple quick notes about my Top 100 List.  I moved a couple of movies around.  I just watched ""When Harry Met Sally..."" again, and moved it up to #85.  I will be moving Wayne's World down from #80, since I saw most of it again recently and it has definitely lost a lot of its pop (although I refuse to dump it off my list, it was on of my favorites as a teen).  And also, I added Million Dollar Baby after seeing it last week. It debuts on my Ever-Changing Movie List at #95.  Much less powerful a second time around which was to be expected, but still genuinely touching and funny at times.  It has a chance to move up after another viewing (like everything else I guess)

Oh, and uh, since no one is reading this by now, I might as well mention that my fantasy football team, CPG Speedwagon, is 1-0 and off to a decent start in their journey to become the first team in our league to defend its title.

I need a job.

"event","Unlike a lot of people I know, I'm not a huge Kevin Smith fan.  I didn't think ""Clerks"" was funny, ""Mallrats"" was just alright, and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" was hideous.  The only two movies of his that I enjoyed were the ones that tackled some sort of taboo.  Lesbianism in ""Chasing Amy,"" and conveniently, the subject of my latest post: Organized religion in ""Dogma.""

""Dogma"" isn't funny in the way that most of my favorite comedies are (which is basically completely random and/or raunchy humor).  Instead, it is clever humor and humor based on smart observations.  Casting George Carlin as the Cardinal was genius by the way.  I saw ""Dogma"" for the first time when I was more religious than I am now, and I immediately found it enlightening to both religious people (especially those of us raised Catholic) as well as those who wouldn't consider themselves at all religious.  To be clear, this movie had little or nothing to do with me being less religious today than I was then.  Instead, I think the movie actually makes a great case FOR religion, although many people interpret it the wrong way and believe Kevin Smith is poking fun at God.  NO WAY!

This movie takes its religion quite seriously, bringing characters into the story that have been overlooked by people who only read the more popular Biblical stories.  Now I'm no Bible expert, so I'm not sure how much these characters have been embellished (although I'm 100% positive there was no 13th disciple that looked like Chris Rock), but its nice to get away from Moses, Adam and Eve, and Jonah for a change.

Instead of poking fun at God, it pokes fun at how organized religion is run, and personally I couldn't agree more with much of the subject matter.  I think the Catholic church has historically abused its power, or at the least misused it.  More than anything else in this movie though, nothing hits the mark quite like the marketing of Jesus.  I'm all for people showing what they believe in whether it be a necklace with a cross on it, a W.W.J.D. bracelet, or a Jesus fish on your car, (and by the way, anyone who has a Jesus fish on their car had better not complain about a homosexual having a rainbow sticker on theirs because ""Why do they have to advertise it?""...although I do find the ""Darwin Fish"" to be a bit of a slap in the face to religious people) but I often wonder the true motives behind the people that make all of these products.  I'm sure there are many, possibly a majority, of these companies that have their hearts in the right place and are donating much of their profit to the church.  But I doubt everyone making a ""Jesus is my Homeboy"" t-shirt is in it just to get a message across.  Religious apparel makes too much money to be 100% pure.

Anyways, I've gotten off topic.  The movie makes fun of organized religion straying too much from the message they should be sending.  Instead they are making a smilin' finger pointin' Jesus for better exposure and possibly destroying the universe by allowing those banished from heaven to return through a loophole.  Thanks a lot Catholic Church!

I hope you caught the sarcasm at the end there. And I hope when you see (or first saw) ""Dogma"" it was from an open-minded perspective and you didn't jump to too many conclusions before you finished.  It's a fun movie that gives its audience some interesting stuff to think about afterward.  Good stuff from an overrated director like Kevin Smith."

"event","The best monster movie ever made if you ask me.  When Jurassic Park came out, the special effects were supposed to be amazing.  Were they ever!  Seeing this movie on the big screen on opening night (with Nick Driver for any of you CPG people out there, now that's a memorable movie if I know I saw it with him.) Seeing it on opening night was fun, but on the big screen, Jurassic Park was terrifying, awe-inspiring and unprecedented.  Even today, the dinosaurs look amazingly real and the suspense is still palpable (nice word, eh?).  Those raptors, man.  SCARY!

The story isn't the centerpiece obviously, but there is a plot, which differentiates this movie from a piece of trash like ""War of the Worlds.""  It also has tiny moments that make you chuckle like when the lawyer gets bitten in half inside the port-a-potty.  Add Newman from Seinfeld as the bad guy, and Sam Jackson being half a bad ass and then getting his arm ripped off by a raptor, well that's a formula for a great flick.

Jurassic Park could have been much higher on this list if it weren't for two things: The Lost World and Jurassic Park III.  Talk about ruining a movie with a sequel.  Even Rocky V didn't suck as much as The Lost World.  Hannibal tried to hurt The Silence of the Lambs, but ""Lambs"" was too strong on its own.  Jurassic Park needed an amazing sequel along the lines of Terminator 2 or it needed to be left alone.  Now I think Hollywood is coming out with Jurassic Park IV.  Dammit.  There's another $8 I have to spend.  Gotta see a movie like that on the big screen."

"event","Finally got out to the theaters this weekend to see The 40 Year Old Virgin with a few buddies after our fantasy football draft.  Obviously it was a good day.  Wish I coulda made LouFest though.

Anyways, The 40 Year Old Virgin, if you didn't already know, stars Steve Carrell of Daily Show and Anchorman fame.  This movie is basically a teen sex comedy with a little bit more maturity and a lot more heart.  So basically I highly recommend it.  Some of the jokes are subtle, most are not, but there isn't much time during the movie when you won't be laughing.  In fact, the only times you won't be laughing is when you are saying ""Awwwww"" during the romantic parts of the movie that work incredibly well for a movie based on crude humor.  (For the record, there was...how do I say this politely...a disgusting fat chick who wouldn't stop laughing at the unfunny parts of the movie or stop saying ""AWWWWWW!!!"" during literally every scene that was remotely romantic. The test to knowing a movie is good...you don't want to kill the wench because it would distract you from the movie.)

Digressing.

I could gush over this movie some more talking about the chemistry between Carrell and Catherine Keener, or I could tell you some scenes (one of the most outrageous and somehow appropriate endings in movie history...I will say no more) but I won't do that.  I hate when people tell the best jokes of movies, it's the reason I didn't like ""There's Something About Mary.""  Sorry I didn't see it opening night, why don't you tell me about the jizz on his ear?

DIGRESSING!!!

Like I was saying, I could gush over the movie, but here are its faults, and off the top of my head, I can find only two that stand out.  One, the movie is about 15-20 minutes too long. Not too bad, but I felt like a 100-minute movie would have been great rather than 120.  And two, it took about half the movie to realize that Steve Carrell wasn't, what some people might call, ""mentally retarded.""  Early on, all I could think of was Brick Tamland from Anchorman, and when Andy (that's the characters name) would talk or joke around, I was half expecting him to talk about how menstruation attracts bears.  But that's just me, you might not have that problem.

Anyways, I recommend The 40 Year Old Virgin.  It's one part raunchy sex comedy (always great), its one part buddy movie (usually fun), and for a change its one part romantic comedy that truly works (incredibly hard to find in an era of movies I will NEVER see such as ""Must Love Dogs."")  So that's it. Go check out The 40 Year Old Virgin.

And tell me you don't find Trish to be the sexiest grandma ever."

Here's the deal though, this is a wonderful story with great music and gang fights. Sure, they fight by dancing, but they made a movie about dance fighting a few years ago called ""You Got Served,"" and what a classic that was.

Look, I'm not gonna lie to you, this isn't the only musical on my list.  Singin' in the Rain is way up there.  And dammit if I'm even gonna admit to having this movie on my list, I better tell you why I like it. And really, its mostly about the music.  There are a lot of classic songs on here like ""America,"" ""Maria,"" ""Mambo,"" and the one you will probably associate me with from now on, ""I Feel Pretty.""  Add a great story and good acting and that's all you need.  I'm not a big fan of all the dancing, but it works in some scenes, especially when the Jets and Sharks are gonna rumble and they do the finger snapping thing.  The problem is, the dancing in the knife fights really hurts in my opinion.  I mean, why can't the gang members outside of the knife fight dance while the two guys battling to the death take the thing seriously?

Anyways, I like musicals and I'm not ashamed to admit it.

"event","Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have actually been doing something with my life lately! I promised myself I wouldn't go back to work with my dad. I lied. I've been doing some part-time stuff like usual and running all kinds of errands. Yesterday I started my ""Whirlwind Tour of the Midwest"" when I had to bring a truck out to Chicago. I was supposed to drive an old truck back the next day after a relaxing night of Madden NFL 06. Instead, the company said they needed the old truck about the time I got to Madison and told me I would be flying back to Minneapolis the same night.  Well I left home at about 5:30 a.m. to get the truck there on time, and I thanks to a late flight and a weather delay, I didn't get back home until almost 8 p.m.  Madden was still ready for me though.  Go Vikes!

But the whirlwind tour doesn't end there, oh no!  I'm going to IOWA!!! YESSSSSSS! I have to drive another truck to Iowa to have it equipped and of course, I will actually be staying the night this time. I couldn't have flown back from Iowa and spent a night in Chicago could I? Nope, I leave the nation's third biggest city after only a few hours, but I get to spend my night in a corn field tomorrow.

Which brings me to the final portion of my whirlwind tour that may or may not happen. KXMB in Bismarck called a few days ago and told me I was one of the final three candidates for their open Weekend Sports Anchor/Reporter job. I basically had my interview over the phone, and I while I feel very confident since I've been talking to them on and off since April, I'm a little worried because the other two guys are currently employed at other stations. Having no ""experience"" blows.

Anyways, that's all for my whirlwind tour. I just want to give a shout out to the three married couples who all shared their nuptials on August 6th.  Congratulations to Rachel (Tennessen) and her husband Nate.  Congratulations to Tricia (MacDonald) and her husband Josh Massey.  And many many congratulations to Andy and Gina (Vinzant) Wasilk.  Helluva wedding, helluva reception, helluva couple.  Good luck to all of you guys.

P.S. Good luck also to Nicole Theisen who is now engaged.

P.P.S. Good luck to me dealing with all of my friends either getting a job or getting married while I waste away driving through Iowa and Wisconsin (sigh)"

"event","I've been holding off on writing about the Twins since the All-Star Break in hopes that they might be able to turn this waste of a season around. I can't wait any longer. I've officially given up on this season.

Now let me explain myself before you start thinking bad thoughts such as: ""WHAT?! Jason Anschutz, the biggest Twins fan I know has given up? He is a hypocritical douche bag."" or ""There's a fair weather fan if I've ever seen one.""

HOW DARE YOU THINK THOSE THINGS!!!

I will still follow my team as closely as ever, I just won't have the same hope I've had since I first learned to spell ""Doug Mientkiewicz"" and ""A.J. Pierzynski"" in the summer of 2001. Before the Twins Renaissance that was 2001, I was one of the few who still cared about the Twins. Watching through the lean years of David McCarty, Rich Becker, Pat Meares, Frankie Rodriguez, and all the other bums. Oh and let's not forget about the long list of veterans who made the rounds in Minnesota to try to bring fans to the Dome: Dave Winfield, Paul Molitor, Terry Steinbach and the human skeleton Otis Nixon. Hell, I even won a World Series with the 1997 Twins thanks to a Playstation game.

But for the first time since 2000, when the team made it possible to consider contraction, I have given up on the season. We just can't win this year. And here's why:

1. This team is too young.  In the past few years, the Twins have done a marvelous job bringing up young guys and letting them contribute to the ball club. There comes a point though, when there are too many of those young guys. Bringing up a guy before he is ready isn't so bad when there is a solid option to fall back on. When Morneau came up, he had a chance to play, but if he failed, Mientkiewicz was there to pick up the slack. The same thing happened with guys like Michael Cuddyer. They could be plugged in to different spots, but if they weren't producing, the old guys came in.  Now there is no one to fill in when the young guys struggle.

2. Frankly, the old team was better.  You can debate all day long on whether Morneau and Mauer and Bartlett will be able to lead this team in the future--and believe me I pray that they can--but there is a reason they weren't starters the last few years: The old guys were better.  Now I would take Morneau over Dougie over the next 10 years and the same goes for Mauer over Pierzynski, but those other guys came through with guys in scoring position. I thought Koskie was a terrible hitter in the clutch, but Cuddyer sucks too and he can't hold Koskie's jock in the field. And as long as we are talking about the old guys, let's point out that Luis Rivas and Cristian Guzman are both having the worst years of their careers, but Bret Boone and Juan Castro aren't much better, so there.

3. Other teams with bigger payrolls have copied our style.  Let's look at the White Sox. They finally give up on being a power team and go small ball like the Twins. Good idea, but even better considering they can afford a few big boppers like Frank Thomas and Paul Konerko and still have money to get solid pitching and the best small ball players out there like Scott Podsednik.

4. The hitting is killing the pitching.  This is the most obvious one. We can't hit. Lew Ford has been terrible, the infielders have been terrible, Morneau can't do anything, and Mauer is the greatest hitter in baseball with no one on base. The only guy on the team I would want up in a big situation is Shannon Stewart. Now, if you were a pitcher and knew that you had to pitch a shutout every game, wouldn't that piss you off? Carlos Silva could be the ace of a lot of big league staffs this year, but his record is 7-5 because he never gets any run support.  This pitching staff wouldn't lose in Boston or New York. And they could probably win a World Series in Minnesota if the bats could just give 3-4 runs a game.

5. All the other stuff...  Injuries have hurt us, especially Torii. From a morale stand point that was the rock bottom point for me this year. But other things have hurt as well. Bret Boone. The wasted trade deadline. And worst of all, playing against teams that keep getting better while we keep getting worse.

The Twins are staying on top of my sports priority list like they always do, but they aren't winning this year. Let's just hope that when Spring Training rolls around next year that the young guys have learned how to deal with a whole season, the pitchers haven't given up on their hitters, Torii Hunter is 100% and most importantly Terry Ryan starts realizng that after 2006 most of our pitching staff will be gone...so get rid of some of those prospects that will keep us barely above .500 each year and start getting us some help for one last run at the World Series. Cuz after that, we might have 1993-2000 all over again. And no one wants to see that."

These past few days have been surreal and not at all wonderful. It started off Monday when a quickie job that Ken Stone had let me know about went to hell. I was supposed to do a little info gathering for a P.R. firm and get paid about $600 for it. Nice scratch considering I haven't made any money this summer. Well the firm decided they didn't need me last minute and cancelled the job.

But that wasn't so bad considering the awful news that happened this week.

A friend of mine (Brian Stenseth if any CPG people are reading), well his mother had to go to the hospital with complications from diabetes. She hadnt known about her diabetes for very long, and apparently she had kidney failure and started twitching or seizing in her sleep. This is the same friend who has lost a grandparent each of the past three Christmases. How about that shit? Happy holidays. Anyways, she's alright now, but just learning about her diabetes. Sounds like grocery shopping is like calculus with all the carb counting and such she will have to do.

But no, that's not the worst thing that happened. My high school class lost our first person a few days ago. Adam Johnson was killed in a car accident. I didn't know him all that well, which is what I get for graduating with 399 people, but I did have classes with him and he was always a nice guy. I can't ever remember anyone having anything bad to say about him. I'm not surprised this happened, since I've heard its pretty typical for high school classes to lose a person or two within a few years. But when I read his obituary in the Strib and found out he had a wife and two kids, my heart just sank. I hardly knew the kid but to know that his two kids won't know their daddy and that his wife has to raise them alone...what a shame.  Couldn't have been one of those drug addict losers.

Anyways, hopefully next week will bring some good news. Maybe a call from KVLY in Fargo or KNBN in Rapid City, SD. Who knows? And that's all I have to say about that."

"event","Back to my list with an oldie but a goodie. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre stars Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston (and some other guy whose name I don't know).  They are three prospectors who search for gold in (believe it or not) the Sierra Madre.

This is one of the first old movies I really enjoyed and its basically because of the way all of these actors change throughout the movie. Especially Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs.  The men toil in the mountains unable to find gold until one day they strike it.  After that, the movie turns from a hopeful tale into one of paranoia and backstabbing.  Each man thinks the others is plotting against him and will take the gold for themselves. Eventually each of the men loses everything and the moral of the story is quite easy to see. Greed is bad and stuff.

Bonus points to this movie for being the birthplace of the quote: ""Badges?! We don't need no stinkin' badges!!!""

Extra bonus points to UHF starring Weird Al Yankovic which lampooned the bit in an Animal Planet type show by using the quote: ""Badgers?! We don't need to stinkin' badgers!!!""

By the way...that Bob Dylan sure can tell a powerful story with his lyrics can't he? Damn. It's a shame he could never be a star today...he can't dance and he doesn't have abs...as far as I know."

Of all the times to post, you would think during the 16 hours I'm awake doing nothing every day, I could find a few minutes. Anyways, I haven't been out to see any movies since War of the Worlds thanks in part to unemployment (little cash) and lack of interest (Everything seems to be a renter). Instead I've been frequenting Turner Classic Movies these past few months. They play a lot of great movies (and a lot of bad ones too actually) completely commercial free 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What a station!

Anyways, some of the movies I've been watching lately include Scarface (1932 version), White Heat (James Cagney gangster film), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (still genuinely creepy 50 years later), Sons of the Desert (Laurel and Hardy), Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (pretty self-explanatory) and even stuff like The Postman Always Rings Twice and (I can't believe I'm telling you this) Funny Girl. That's right, I watched a Barbra Streisand movie. Even worse than watching the movie is this: Streisand saved this movie. It would have been downright terrible without her, instead it is bearable.

Anyways, I thought I would recommend two old movies for you in case you were looking for something new (or old) in you movie selections.  The first is Soylent Green starring Charlton Heston. If you have heard of this movie, you probably already know the ending, but that isn't what was so fun about this movie. It is supposed to take place in the year 2022, but it is so obviously a movie that was made in 1973. The future is over-populated, but everyone still uses normal phones and horribly tacky '70s furniture. There are other types of ""furniture"" in this movie that had me wondering where the filmmakers came up with their weird interpretations of the future.

The other, and this is for everyone, but especially the Newsteam: Sweet Smell of Success starring Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis. Lancaster plays J.J. Hunsecker, a corrupt columnist at a NYC newspaper who uses his considerable power as a columnist to ruin other people and look after his own interests. Curtis plays a press agent who is trying to get favorable items run for his clients. This movie will show you why PR people are the devil. It will also show you why I went into the media...TO RUN AN ENTIRE CITY LIKE I WAS A MOB BOSS!!! The rest of the story involves a plot to break up the relationship that is being formed by Hunsecker's sister and a guitar player. Hunsecker is quite incestuous although the movie never flat out says it. But don't let that deter you. Check this flick out.

Oh, and about that job opportunity thing...WDAY in Fargo called me yesterday and it seems I am in the running for a job in their sports department. The job is supposedly ""90% photography,"" but as long as the opportunity exists for on-air work, I am more than interested. Plus the job would give me two other things: 1) a chance to reunite with fellow Newsteamer Sarah Klaphake, and 2) MORE MONEY TO GO TO THE THEATER INSTEAD OF WATCHING OLD ASS MOVIES ON TCM!

"event","Back to the Top 100 list! Only on #88...you all may never find out what my #1 movie is if I keep going a month between movies.

Anyways, O Brother is onw of those movies that tries to be different and absolutely works. The Coen brothers have done it multiple times, including Fargo, which is #22 on my list in case you were wondering.

O Brother is based on ""The Odyssey,"" and no matter how many times I see this movie, I don't really get all of the parallels. I understand the sirens, and the cyclops, and the disguise near the end, but I don't know where being a Dapper Dan man instead of using Fop, Goddammit! actually fits in.

It doesn't matter though, cuz the movie is hilarious at times, touching at times, and just plain fun always. Man of Constant Sorrow by the Soggy Bottom Boys got overplayed and kind of annoying after a while, but the first time you hear that song when you watch the movie, it makes you want to sip on some moonshine, slap your knee, and possibly squeal like a pig. Great times.

Not much else to say...just bored and surfed my way to LiveJournal.

4th of July is tomorrow, but my weekend is basically over. Went tubing down the Apple River for the 3rd straight year, and if you haven't done it 4th of July weekend, then you have no idea how much fun floating down a urine filled river can be. Until next time..."

"event","Spielberg! Cruise! YES! That was what I was thinking before I went into the theater to watch War of the Worlds. When I came out, I was thinking...THAT BASTARD TOOK KATIE HOLMES FROM ME!!!

So yeah, I didn't like War of the Worlds very much. In fact, I would say it was bottom 3 all-time for Spielberg movies, and that wouldn't be too bad of a put down if the other two weren't The Terminal and the gawd-awful A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (which sort of gets a pass since it was Stanley Kubrick's idea and all)

Anyways, War of the Worlds is possibly the ultimate ""summer blockbuster"" movie that critics generally talk about. Basically no plot to speak of, but amazing sound and special effects. I generally like these types of movies, but not when Spielberg and Cruise are involved. Minority Report is one of my top 100 movies for crying out loud!

So this is the basic plot...Cruise has to take care of his kids for the weekend. He is a deadbeat dad, his kids hate him, and he really doesn't care all that much about them either as long as he can get them to shut up for a few days until his ex-wife comes back to get them.

After about 15 minutes of showing how horrible Tom Cruise (Ray) is as a father, electrical storms hit his town, and he goes to check it out. Turns out the lightning was bringing aliens down into huge machines that have been buried in the earth for millions of years. Somehow mankind has never found any of these machines, despite the fact that we can find an arrowhead and pottery from ancient native tribes everywhere around the globe. The rest of the movie, I kid you not, is one big chase scene. There is not plot! It's just Cruise trying to take care of his kids and himself while the aliens crush the human race.

Tim Robbins has a small role in this part of the movie playing a hermit-like survivalist who is basically on the screen just to be creepy and put Cruise into danger. These scenes in the survivalist's basement are fairly suspenseful, but are exactly like the spider scene in Minority Report with a little ""raptor scene"" from Jurassic Park thrown in.

Anyways, if you haven't seen the old version of War of the Worlds (or heard the radio version or read the book for the matter), you might not know how the movie ends. I have both seen the old movie and heard the radio version (thank you junior high) so I knew the ending, but I was desperately hoping for a new twist. Alas, the ending was the same, and let's just say that when H.G. Wells wrote the book in 1898, the ending may have been fun and creative, but in today's movie-making, special effects driven world, nothing is more anti-climactic than the way War of the Worlds concludes.

In conclusion, I give War of the Worlds a big thumbs down as a movie. But the special effects and the sound...well they were pretty sweet. If you're gonna go see it, I recommend a matinee. The less money you spend on this movie, the less angry you will be for not heeding my warning."

"event","My first movie review in what seems like forever. Do you care? Don't answer that.

The previews for Batman Begins got me excited since this was supposed to be a different breed of Batman. For the record, I consider ""Batman & Robin"" to be the worst movie ever made, except for maybe Summer of Sam. Anyways, the word of mouth about the new Batman was positive too, so off I went to watch a movie all alone. How pathetic.

But thankfully, I would not be disappointed! Batman Begins is without a doubt the best Batman movie of them all. I was never a fan of the Michael Keaton version or its weird ass sequel, Batman Returns. In fact, I thought Batman Forever was the best of the 4 new Batman movies, but I thought all 4 were worse than Batman: The Movie starring Adam West. IT HAD JOKER, RIDDLER, PENGUIN, AND CATWOMAN!!!

Anyways, this new movie is so much different than the rest. It is darker and has the same feel as the Michael Keaton movies, but it plays like a real drama instead of a super-hero movie. Since Batman technically isn't a super-hero, but a normal man with gadgets instead of super powers, it makes sense that Hollywood could make this movie as realistic as a comic book movie could possibly be.

We start with Bruce Wayne in an Asian prison where he is apparently studying criminal behavior to use in his future crime fighting work. He is then rescued by Henri Ducard (played by Liam Neeson) and brought to train to become part of the League of Shadows, a secret group of men who fight for justice at all costs. When Wayne has a falling out with the League of Shadows, he heads back to Gotham City to become Batman.

The training sequences in Asia are a lot of fun, and what follows is great too, because we get to see how Wayne becomes Batman. He actually has to order parts for his suit, and because Wayne Enterprises did some work for the military, he also has a chance for some high tech gear such as a tank-like Batmobile and a suit that can repel not only bullets, but knives as well.

When we finally see Batman, he is stopping an apparent drug shipment led by crime boss Carmine Falcone. This is where we discover the Batsignal and we meet Sgt. (not yet Lieutenant) Gordon.  Also at the center of the villainy is a psychiatrist who puts on a mask after making his patients hallucinate to scare them into insanity. He calls himself The Scarecrow, and while he is not even close to as cool as Joker or Riddler or anyone from the Adam West TV series, he is by far the most realistic.

And that is what makes this Batman movie so much better than the rest. It doesn't feel like it could actually happen, but the movie makers try to make it feel realistic. It's not too dark and no fun like the first two movies, and it isn't colorful and completely void of substance like the last two movies. Batman Begins is its own movie, and hopefully the next one that is made (and there will be a next one) doesn't try to do too much different."

"event","Hello again. Thought I would post once again and share my latest adventure, since I haven't seen any movies lately. Gotta get out to Batman Begins.

So Andy & I had a coupon to golf up at Grand National Golf Club in Hinckley, which was basically an excuse for us to go out golfing and gambling all in the same day. Our tee time was at 9:33 a.m. and there was a 33% chance of rain. Things looked pretty ominous early in the round , but skies cleared and the day seemed to be turning out beautifully. But on the 17th hole we noticed a wall cloud coming our way. We rushed to finish 17 and rushed again to get to the 18th where Andy put his 2nd shot onto the green of the par 5 (lot of wind at our back at this point. After I putted out and Andy missed his eagle putt rain came down like we were in a monsoon, except there was some hail to join with it.

We ran to the truck, I sat on two golf bags (so as not to get them wet out in the truck bed), and we sped off toward the casino only to be drenched even more by the rain that was not only coming down now, but also coming up in the form of a flooded parking lot. By the time we got into the casino, we looked like we jumped into a pool, and the air conditioned casino was not treating us well.

So the logical thing to do was to ask guest services for a t-shirt. We were golfing at their esteemed course after all. (By the way, I shot a 97, making it the second time in my life breaking 100. That tells you how good of a golfer I am.) Anyways, after pulling a few strings the wonderful ladies brought us each ""GRAND 2000"" shirts that seemed to smell of moth balls. The shirts hung down to our knees, so the rest of the day was spent carrying our wet rags around and explaining to people why we were each wearing the same baggy shirt. After 9 hours in the casino (including 5 at the brand new card room) I ended up with a fabulous $29 profit while Andy lost somewhere around $70. With the golf and lunch buffet we both ended up losing money for the day, but it was 14 hours of fun, that's for sure. And that's my Grand Casino story.

A few other notes: The Duluth job I was hoping for got filled. Apparently some dude in Green Bay who had worked in Duluth previously felt like stepping back down a notch and anchoring a little bit. So I will remain unemployed for a while longer.

I got an e-mail from Tanzania the other day. It was nice to hear from Amy and to know she was safe. She didn't really say how she was doing, so I'm not sure if she is enjoying herself, but hopefully she is slowly growing accustomed to the Peace Corps way of life.

Also, I wanna give a shout out to Joe Mac who left for Alabama and a career in the Air Force two days before Amy left. Losing one of your best friends along with your girlfriend in a matter of days doesn't make a guy too happy. But I didn't mention him in the earlier post, so Joe if you get a chance to check this out, I miss you bro. I'm gonna go check out tvjobs.com now. Then its to my normal routine of doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! Later."

"event","I promised some insight into my week, so here goes. This is pretty much therapy for me right now so bear with me. You might get some deep, emotional crap that I promised would never grace these electronic pages.

This week has been at once both wonderful and absolutely excrutiating. I've been home for a while now and since I got home from Newsteam Weekend I haven't had anything occupying my time except a little bit of time with friends and a lot of time with Amy. She left this morning for Philadelphia, a three day pitstop for orientation before heading out to Tanzania for 2 years and 3 months. I never thought it would be so hard to say goodbye. I've been preparing myself to say goodbye since the moment we started dating, and up until the past few days, I've handled it all really damn well.

For the past week, I've been trying to show her a good time before she left. I took her out to Blarney to spend one last night with her friends and I've been spending as much time as possible with her. On Saturday, we spent our last night alone together. I had a little theme. Since she lives in North America and will soon be living in Africa, I thought I would give her a chance to visit the other 5 continents. So to start our night, I gave her two gifts. A koala bear named Sydney to represent Australia and a bag of Andes mints for South America (easily the toughest continent to find something for...brazil nuts, no. A wax, definitely not.) Then, in Europe, we enjoyed a Swedish massage (great way to spend a half hour), before settling in for some Chinese food (Asia) and eventually some ice cream (Antarctica). It was a successful night, and one that I will always remember.

Last night I stayed with her at her parent's house so that I could go to the airport with them this morning. It was tough for everyone, but this morning was unbelievably difficult. I've cried when relationships have ended and I've savored that final kiss before, but that was different. This relationship wasn't over yet, and there we were at security crying together and sharing one last kiss with neither one of us wanting it to end. It's tough to think about even now.

She called later in the day, nearly unable to speak because she was still crying. I told her to keep looking forward at her new challenges and to stay busy and not think about what she's leaving behind. I hope she takes my advice. The experiences ahead shouldn't be tarnished because of doubt.

Our 5-month anniversary would be tomorrow. It was a great run, and you never know what can happen in two years. But I know that these last few weeks have been more special than I could have imagined when we started this thing. And watching her leave was a helluva lot tougher than I thought it would be too.

I love you babe. Good luck."

"event","Hello again. Been a while since I've last posted and it might be a long time after this one, because tonight is my last night in my apartment ever. It's also the last night I will have Internet access until I purchase a plan at home. Not sure how long it will take me. Probably not long considering the Internet is vital to my job search.

Anyways, these last two years have been nice in Roy Wilkins Room 205. Jon and I lived in the dank pit that was Centennial Hall our sophomore year, where our entire room was as big as the kitchen we have now, and our food consisted of chicken patties, corn dogs, and waffle fries almost exclusively. Gotta love UDS. Now I'm moving out, and leaving the 'U' for the last time. Kinda sad when you think about it, but really sad when you realize that living at home with your parents is just one day away. I love my folks, but dammit...let's just say mowing the lawn and doing dishes shouldn't cause as many fights as it normally does.

Anyhoo, Jon left a week ago for his new place, but he's been back and forth since the semester ended. His girlfriend has moved all her stuff in until her new place lets her in on June 1st. Kinda weird, but not a problem. Tonight we finished our Tecmo Super Bowl season. You might think, ""big deal, everyone's done that."" WRONG! Jon and I played every single game of the entire Tecmo Super Bowl season. And tonight we finished it. We started back in freshmen year after we met in Intro to Speech. We both lived in Frontier Hall and we both loved TSB. The rest is history. And since I am proud of this accomplishment and I want to document it (like I tend to do with almost everything) here is how the season ended. Feel free to skip the rest, especially if you have never played the greatest Nintendo game in the history of the world.

Here's how it worked: We rotated between first and second player every game, usually playing two or four game sets. Since the computer sets the schedule, the games were predetermined, which could get frustrating if you got the Cardinals too many times and the other guy was always getting the Chiefs. But we dealt with it. Divisions started getting wrapped up earlier this year when we got to Week 14. For you Tecmo fans out there, I'm sure you'll find it very easy to believe that the Bills, Giants, Bears, and 49ers had their divisions wrapped up fairly early in the year. The other two division champs were the Bengals, a surprising force, and the Chiefs, who edged out the Raiders for the AFC West. Rounding out the AFC playoff field: the Raiders, Chargers and Dolphins. The NFC: Detroit, Minnesota (8-8) and Philly (7-9) not a very deep NFC. 

The playoffs began with the surprising Dolphins beating the Raiders 17-10. The Dolphins were 11-5, which surprised Jon and I. The Raiders 10-6. But we've gotten so good at neutralizing the running game that Bo Jackson and Marcus Allen are hardly even a factor anymore. The Bengals beat San Diego fairly easily to move on as well. In the NFC, the Niners beat the Eagles by only 7, and my beloved Vikings finally fell to the Lions by 5 after Wade Wilson was sacked for a safety. Truth be told, I never thought the Vikes could make the playoffs, but I was pumped to see them there. Even at 8-8.

The heavy hitters came next: The Giants beat the Lions 42-0. (Barry Sanders was hurt, LT was as fast as ever, and I gave up hope at 21-0 and started going for it on 4th down all the time.) The 49ers also took care of the top seeded Bears 13-10. Great game. In the AFC, the Bills (14-2, best record in the game) took out Cincy 9-7 thanks to three clutch FGs by Scott Norwood (kinda weird saying that if you know anything about Scott Norwood.) But in a huge shocker, the Dolphins upset the Chiefs 17-14. The Chiefs (me again) went for it on 4th down near the 50 yard line in a tie ball game and couldn't convert. The Dolphins capitalized, hitting the game-winning FG with a minute to go. End of the Chiefs season.

The Dolphins run didn't end there though! They (and by they I mean, I) beat the Bills (who had lost Thurman Thomas in Week 17) 19-13 and headed to the Super Bowl. They would face the mighty Giants who took out the Niners thanks to LT and his uncanny ability to stop every play in the game. 12-7 was the final score.

And then the Super Bowl. I was the heavy underdog Dolphins. Jon, the heavy favorite Giants. On his first possession, the passing game was working wonders, as he went time and again the Stephen Baker. Ottis Andersen finished the job giving the Giants a 7-0 lead, and putting me in the sad position of having to comeback against LT. A surprisingly solid drive ended at the Giants 3 yard line where Pete Stoyanovich had his kick blocked by mutha fuckin' LT, BUT WAIT!!! The Dolphins picked it up and scored, tying the game, enraging my roommate, and putting the season in jeopardy as he threw the controller against the wall. (This happened quite often actually. Nintendo controllers are incredibly durable.) A turnover followed by two amazing catches by Dolphins receivers in seas of Giant blue put Miami up 14-7 at halftime. Helluva Mighty Bombjack Show by the way at the half. The second half saw more Miami magic with Mark Clayton catching a ball without even diving or jumping. Just a straight up catch in between 3 Giants. More controller throwing. 21-7 Dolphins. The Giants quickly answered, and stopped me with 1:30 left to go. Not much time in Tecmo world. 60 yards from the end zone, Jon dropped Phil Simms back and lofted it up to Mark Ingram...he jumps...but so does the defender, who knocks it away. And that was it.

Four years and 236 games later, the Miami Dolphins are your Super Bowl champions. Not in a million years did either of us think Marino would lead Miami to the win. But, they beat 4 teams generally considered to be better than them, and still won. The NFC (me) also beat the AFC (Jon) in the Pro Bowl, effectively ending our TSB careers. Only the occasional exhibition remains for any and all comers. Sadly, this is one of the greatest accomplishments of my life...right up there with graduating college actually (kidding). And while you might think it is incredibly stupid and a waste of time, I will say it was a blast and worth every minute. Jon and I have been friends for 4 years, roommates for 3, and tomorrow we go our seperate ways with loads of memories, and the knowledge that we have done what possibly no one else in the history of the world has ever done. (And that might not be an exaggeration.) Later Jonny. Donk and El Nino forever.

"event","well. everyone wrote about their first day so i thought i'd write about mine. well homeroom was quiet, didn't know anybody in it, all grades in it. some hot guys. lmao. 1st block. well it was hot in the room i knew like one person now wait two. lol. but they were across the room. um i had a lovely time on my way to 2nd block when i got stopped and had to stand next to some girls that i didn't know. the guy told us to go to the cafeteria where a whole bunch of other girls that i didn't know were. this lady took our names and asked what we got sent there for. i still had no idea whether my shirt was too short (which it wasn't) or it was because of the band on my shirt. (rage against the machine) well then the lady led us to iss past classrooms that could see out the big windows of the classrooms. all of the ppl turned around and looked at us as we walked by. there were probly about maybe 12 or more of us. and all girls. no guys!! how unfair is that?! to get out we could call our parents to bring us clothes or buy a 15 dollar shirt. i just sat there and the lady asked me to come over to her. she said i could go back to class if i tucked my shirt in and made it look like it wasn't short. well that took up probly about half of 2nd block. um i walked to orchestra where i new like 4 or 5 ppl in the class. heck yes. lmfao. omg being in iss pissed me off badly. but then i got over it and laughed. i woulda been in there all day!! umm took a tour in 2nd block. i was just gonna hang out with katie during cookie break but it was wicked short. or they messed up the bell. which isn't really a bell it's like a boop boop sound or something. lol. real descriptive. hehe. um i have the same teacher for 3rd n 4th block on blue days. which is the odd day. and gold day is the even or w/e. um yea. his name is richard simmons(sound familiar anyone? haha) and he teaches my career and study skills class and my drama class. he was like a pro dancer/singer person or something. he teaches dance too. umm yea. lunch was gay cuz we only have one lunch and every fucking person in the school is out there. well it was wicked hot so me and kat went into the lunch room to see if there were any seats, and luckily there were. so me katie, kat , jordan ate lunch (thanks katie). i wish i was at barron. omg there are so many ppl i don't know. but i do know some ppl. and some of my bro's friends. umm my friend stephanie is in my c&ss class on blue days and then in three other of my classes on a gold day. which is awesome. la la la la. i made a few friends. blah blah blah. wish i was at barron blah blah blah. and that was pretty much my day with some details taken out. i had fun. i really didn't care about iss except that it was unfair and gay. hehe. so blah.

yesterday i did absolutely nothing and was bored out of my fucking mind!

today i did nothing but wasn't as bored, well i cleaned my room and then at 6 my best friend picked me up and we talked in the car while her mom talked to someone. 6:30 ash was hungry so we went to micky d's cuz we didn't have very much time to go anywhere. well i saw a lot of ppl i knew, even some that didn't rememebr me from like elementary or just a while ago. lol. um the orientation was sorta boring except when the ppl next to us started talking and stuff. haha they were disturbing ppl, but not really. just the snotty preps who were louder!! no offense to ppl who wear preppy clothes. lol. all my friends that do, your not the least bit snotty. well this lady or teacher or someone walked up the bleachers (and this was like my kind of ppl group lol) and they all got quieter, it was funny. so she stood at the top of the bleachers where we all were for the rest of the orientation thing. i barely even listened, only to some of the important stuff. which i don't really remember. lol. well i met two new ppl who i don't know their names we just said hi. one was reeeeally cute, i don't think he was a freshman. i'm not sure if they were freshman either, but some of them had the folders that we got with everything BUT our scheduales in them. ahhh!! well it was kind of confusing with friggen 11 buildings at that school. but we found our way.

um we got into the car and drove over to dillards and looked around and ash and her mom got stuff. I LOVE EXCALATORS!!! sorry i randomly had to say that. hahaha i sat on the escalator as we went down them. it was fun!! I love it!! well me and ash had some fun in some of the departments there. haha. uuuummmmmm i can't remember. oooo sum41 is on my stereo. sorry, it switched cd's. from breaking benjamin to sum41. umm well i can't remember. so blah.

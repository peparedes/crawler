"event","Reading back through all my old posts, reflecting on my younger, not so much stupider as more naive self, I just shake my head. I realise a lot of things I dislike about people, are who I use to be. My biggest mistakes in life were trusting people for the most part, Fuzzy, Thibodeau, Breezy, etc. some of my closest friends (not so much breezy, did not know her long enough to fully trust her, rightfully so) were also my biggest mistakes. everyone has friends come in and out of there lives, and they truly shape us and make us who we are. myself? I don't even make new friends anymore, I just don't care. I'm so happy knowing I will have a full family soon, with a baby and all. the few friends I have from my unfortunate experience with the local furries, well those few friends make everything worth it. am I still being naive? well through all this, people abandoning me because they are asshole/infatuated with me uncomfortably/smalling me because I'm going to be a father id say the few people left are bound to stick around. Ive grown up,I know there is more growing and learning to come, but, i'm out of the pupa, I want to learn to fly now. I do carry some remorse and... I want to say hate for some people of the past, but, it will fade, as I grow. 

felt like letting this stuff out. I keep poking the past with a stick, I don't know why I just don't delete my LJ entierly already. 

I cant wait till August, till I get to hold and touch you, my beautiful child. I can only hope somehow, I can make your life better then mine."

"event","Ya I only post when something important happens. and I want to share some feelings and emotions. 

lets cut it to the nitty gritty, 

Silver is Pregnant with my child. as in IRL for you internet dummies, there is a fetus inside of her with a genetic match to both her and my DNA. can I get any clearer?   


I am ecstatic. she is ecstatic, our parents are happy, and we make more then enough money to be okay, plus moving to a new two bedroom apartment.

what disturbs me is the few narrow minded fuckheads that feel they know it all and want to tell us its a mistake. 

so far we have been told to get an abortion, and a close former friend even told us it is a waste of time and money.

to be spacific, Altenia, fuck you and your shitty point of view. you don't want kids? thats fine for you. but you do NOT lecture me on what I want to ""waste"" my time on. dont even bother replying to this. your words are as good as vomit to me. you are a liar, a drama whore and you never respected us. we arent losing anything by your absence. 


Silver and I are happy, PERIOD. we are moving to a new home, moving into a new place in our lives, and I will not miss those we leave behind. we will not tolerate any bullshit about a baby being a big mistake. I am happy, silver is happy, to all of you negative fuckwits who cannot have enough respect to be happy for us, Fuck you. I only wish somebody had told what your telling me to your god damn mothers so you wouldn't exist either.

to those who are supportive, Thank you :) it means alot to us. 2008 is the beginning of a new chapter. a fresh chapter. Life is beginning to make sense, and it feels good. 

So, if you feel you are against this baby, you are against us. you have no buisness being against what our love has created, no loss here.

"event","Im not getting married this year, stop asking and congratulating. I said I was but I shouldn't have. We will get married when we feel the time is right, Bugger off. 

Whatever happened to happy go lucky fun loving Kitmouse? He was used, abused, trampled and left out to dry. I exclude myself to very few people right now, mostly people who show they give a damn about me. as Iv'e said a million times, I don't see this as a good social utility, you want to know how my life is? contact me, e-mail me, look me up on facebook. I hate Live Journal for many reasons. Anyhow, yes, no marriage, stop looking at old posts and bugging me about them. there will be a marriage, and if it concerns you you will know when, I will contact you personally if you are invited.
I did not decide to be this cynical and growly, experience in life and the furry fandom has made me this way.
Piss off :)"

If any of my freinds give two sweet shits what happens in my life they can make an effort to call me or e-mail me or catch me on messenger, as I have stated before I fail to see any point in dramajournal anymore :)

My contact info is in my LJ info if you wanna know my e-mail, MSN, Yahoo, ICQ or AIM contacts. if your a freind and have forgotten my phons number, feel free to e-mail me asking as I will not post it here.

okay, horrible analogy. 

in any case, We met that day, not a day to forget, we consider it out anniversary because we never started ""going out"" we just fell in love and grew attatched over time. so yar ^^ 5 years together, and a wonderful gift from an extremly talented and wonderful dear friend!

Not sexual, but nude, so not worksafe exactly.

You are a wonderful Artist Breezy,  time and again you have prooved what a caring, trusting and loyal friend you are, and this gift means more to Silver and I then you will ever know *hugs the cute hyena* ^^ THANK YOU!

wanna know how it went?

ask me, I like conversations much more then dramajournal. 

Time for irony

I really hate livejournal, I just dont see a point anymore

no need to point out its ironic, I know.

Found myself caught between two freinds again, last summer it was the same deal, but one showed their true face. this time it aitn so easy, and it seems like im between not only one pair of freinds, but tw. and you know what the funyn part is? I just dont care, I mean I do, and it sucks to see freinds in pain and anguish at eachother, but well, it aint my buisness, and I aint gonna be no messenger again. last time I was there for freinds one of them royally fucked me over, so, fuck em :) luv yall but deal with your own shit, I been livin the stress free life for well over a month now. 

You want to know how im doing? fucking ask :P 

I have chat programs, I have a phone number, I dont need to type out my life in paragraphs. 

thats just my theory, dont take it personally

irony irony irony

back to work tonight. first night back in two weeks. what fun, im tired, im hungry, im cynical, and ive never felt happier ^^

honestly, im feelign really good other then the tiredness, and its all thanks to a drama/stress free existance I am leading, thank you Effexor :D and thanks to my freinds who are there for me ^^ you know who you are."

as for myself, its been a rough few weeks but im back on my feet. after some extremly bad things happenign to me I realized my stress level, anxiety and whatever the hell else was pushing me to a dangerous point, so I went to see a doctor. got medication, feelin great now. 

that is the extremly abridged tail because no one wants to hear the usual omg emo crap. :3

in anycase, Im fine. call me, 209-8372 and let me know your alive and want to spend tiem with me, id like that as id love to get out more ^^

"event","been a while sinces ive posted, thought id say hi. 

Work is getting stricter with internets usage, they blocked MSN, LJ, Emessenger, AIMbuddy, ICQ to go, he only thing I can do at work is use Meebo, no more checking mail or LJs but, at least I can still chat. 

Honestly, and I appologize to my freinds, I dont read anyones LJs anymore, as well, its apparent as I dont leave any comments anymore, I probably should tho, see what my freinds are up to, but, well, its not that I dont care about my freinds, its just that I dont care about live journal more and more latley. you have my number (pobably) gimme a shout to see how im doin :P. I dont post much either, so, no big loss. I usually post if something happens (either I get something new or I have news, this post being neither)

been uber busy with work stuffs latley, but, nothing is going on until august, then I go on a trip, should be fun. 

seems a bad vibe is going aroudn latley, dunno what it is, everyone seems down. Im doing okay, basically, ive been using the internet less and less, focusing on my hobby and other things, getting out, doing whatever. so, appologies to why freinds who A) never see me online and, B) see me online and I dont respond (half the time I forget miranda is on >.>) 

*shrugs again* looking forward to the big NSAO BBQ, if anyone in the local group gives a crap. seems no one cares about meets anymore. ah well, best laid plans. 

in any case, yea, I might post, I might not, never know. dont count on me replying to your LJ tho, I just dun read em anymore. sorry. 

blarg, im tired. 

oh well, bed time."

"event","as I distance myself further and further away from ""furry"" I obviously wont be attending Anthrocon, nor am I going to anthro fest. I am not sure what it is, but im just not into it anymore. yes, I still like the art, yes, I still spiritually feel myself as a gyrphon dragon hybrid, but, I am just tired of societies in general. the local fur group is different, the furs here are different, sure we have a few... people in the group that would be better off just dissapearing, but thats neither here nor there, there are always going to be stereotypes or socially awkward morons in every group you are apart of. most of the locals I consider friends, and our meetings and hanging outs are far from anything furry. we are just people. what im saying is, im tired of furry, ive been tired of it for a while ive mentioned this before. im tired of the perversian, the drama whores, the pedophiles, the losers who are only part of it because the world rejected them and they are to scared to stand up to it, etc the list goes on.

No, not all furries are like that, but most are, and id rather stay away from those aspects. Stick to my group of freinds and get back to what freinds are. freinds are not people you chat with, they are people you can trust and want to be around. not strangers you say ""Hi!"" and lift your tail to. but, your decisions are your own, I wont judge you if you go to furry conventions or consider yourself a furry, its just not my thing anymore, I like who I am, and im tired of hiding from the real world, I love me, and want to be me. I love my freinds, furry and not, you know who you are. 

saying this doesnt prove anything or change anything, im just realizing that im no logner interested in furry, period. I like anthromorphic art, but the fandom is just that, a fandom. and I dont like fandoms. I like me, I like diversity, I want to be a free spirit, to associate with who I please and not belong to a demograph or a group. Im me, period :) 

Its like, I hate people, but I like a person, so in that sense, I hate furries, but not all. Its unfortunate that my opinion of furries has detereorated over the years, it went from being these free people who are into peace and animals, to people who just have nothing better to do but to screw as many others as they can, or pretend they do with a computer, or have had a horrible life and need to hide behind a cartoon character. Oh I know the flames are coming because I made this post, but this is how I feel, take it or leave it, I know who my freinds are in the end.  This is a bitter post, but, hey, its how I feel. and I dont need to appologize for it."

I know there was more to the dream but this is all I can remember. 

I went to an old freind of mine's house, he and I were like brothers once until he got a girlfriend. 

In any case I sent to his house and he gave me soem things, like the old beast wars toys he and I use to play with, I brought them home and they were all broken and missing peices compared to my toys that were complete. 

goes to show you, life is better now that I have forgotten him I suppose.

Well, as everyone knows im cutting back on fast food and anything too greasy or fatty, So I was torn wethr or not to order out to help my hunger. so, I go withdraw 20$ from the ATM so I can possibly buy something. in walks the deliver guy from X-Treme Pizza (Formally Saluzzo) and gives us a free donair. Amanda was sick so I had it. then silver calls and asks if I can withdraw 20$ to bring hoem for her, I had already withdrawn it. weird. so, I miss the 6 bus (which takes me home) so I caught some other bus that got me to Mumford terminal. lo and behold, Fuzzy drives by. 

I just found it to be a eries of fortunate things. plus I got to talk to the Heather monster last night, and that is always a good thing :P Toll free number for my place kicks ass ^^

well, thats all to report I suppose. another night of work awaits me. Now its time to check my e-mail and see how the local fur group is playing with the beach ball of an idea I tossed out to them. looks like once again I have to make final plans because right now all they are doing is throwing it around which does not get the job done :P

"event","Am I a stuffed animal? Am I only here for hugs, and comfort? someone needs a shoulder, Kit is a good one! he listens, cares, he gives up his living space for those who need one for a while, but does he have feelings? obviously not. 

this pisses me off. I like being there for my freinds, to be an open ear and a shoulder to cry on, but im NOT A DOOR MAT! 
You want to be inconsiderate and angry at me for nothing? piss off, my door will be closed to you. 

it just aggravates me ya know? I try to be there for the people I care for, and some of them use me, and when they dont ened me the shut me out or take advantage of me. 

yet in the end its somehow my fault. my fault people shut me out, what did I do? just tell me, I dont think I did anything wrong. *sigh* but, as a wise Coyote once told me, why do I want to be freinds with someone who does those kindof things to me? well, thats a variation of what he said, but it works anyhow. 

so why be nice?

another thing im sick of is people who say they are freinds but never contact me or express any interest in spendign time with me, or even just chatting, im busy yes, but not that busy. id like to hear from some long lost freinds sooner or later, or are they finished with me to? got all they need from me? 

im not depressed, just annoyed.  

oh, I also hate fake people. just had to throw that in. empty promises and people who show off, pretend to be something they are not. or people who say stupid things or outrageous claims, or resort to violence for everything. had to get that out. 

while im at it, I dont want to disable comments because if I do people will think im flaming someone, far from it, im tired of stupid comments let by certain stupid people. so if I dont make this freinds only, I get dumb remarks about people who pretend to know me. 

ugh, im just venting now. Havent posted in a while and now this. 

Ever wish you could hurt someone who deserved it? like really bad, not physically, skin heals. but like emotionally destroy someone who really deserves it? hehe, thats evil I know. but its a good thought towards people who do it to others. but you know something? they are already emotionally dead inside anyhow most likely :3

im done, :P

Oh and for the few panicky people out there, this is a general statement about people ive known over years, yes, something happened that triggered this, but nothing that cant be delt with oer time, its a cimbination of work stress and inconsiderate people that are getting to me, so no one blame themselves please."

"event","ive been doing alot of thinking latley about alot of things, perhaps a slight change in my life is in order, a change of mindset. 

or im just feeling lost. not in a depressed way, not at all im quite delighted,just, dunno what to do about some things I guess. 

my leg hurts

anyone ever wonder what live journal is for? is it nothing but an attention grabber? or a place where you can tell all your freinds ""this is what I did, this is me"" 
im sure its different fro everyone.

My leg really hurts

im bored of my video games. part of my wants to sell em all. but in the end I wotn I suppose. id miss em somehow. I just never play anything anymore. dont care anymore about killing ganon, or stopping space pirates, or stealing cars and running over 30 pedestrians then perform a drive by shooting in all killing 150 people nd several police officers only to somehow lose the hundred cops and helecopter chasing me by painting my car a different color. 

My leg is killing me :(

I paid so much for my DS and now I just dont want to play it anymore. why?

I dotn even care enough to post anymore. I want to post what I feel and my thoughts, but, why?"

FRIDAY

Friday morning, get a ride home with one of the laundry staff, sweet, get home early and find a sleeping dragon on my couch, I did not want to go to bed, so I grabbed my DS and the rats and sat in the washroom playing that and letting them run around freely. I later got on my computer and finished the last touches on Star Tours (finally) Fuzzy woke up as did Silver around lunch time. Fuzzy and I went to get lunch and then proceeded to his place where I witnessed a commercial for Silent Hill (further exciting me for we were going to meet up with the group and see it that night) Fuzzy, John, Librem and I drove to the airport to pick up Librem's friend Terminotaur, then we went to get Chinese food. John and I went back to my place and chilled for a bit until I got a call from Sno, letting us know he, Xeal and Malachi were already at the threatre. Silver, John and I and I proceeded to the theatre where we wound up running into a bunch of others, we then went to Zellers next door to the theatre (the trio who called me were now mini-golfing, since the movie did not start for another two hours) and at Zellers Silver and I bough swim suits for Saturday's swim, and I bought another beast wars figure. well, technically it was a Tranformers universe repaint of a beast wars figure, but shut up, im a geek.
Back to the theatre, we met up with a bunch more of the group, then I met Malachi for the first time. 

on a side note, ive been a fan of her artwork for many years, was neat to meet her in person, and dammitshe is a sweet, kind cute person. If you are not familliar with Malachi's artwork go look her up on the VCL or fur affinity. 

We saw the movie, Silent Hill was very good, but you may disagree. I enjoyed it quite a bit. but I wont reveal anything about it :)

I went home, Malachi, Xeal, Thibodeau and Sno came with Silver and I, we all chilled for a while, Thibodeau went home and the rest of us watched a few episodes of Clone High and got pizza. I went to bed. Note, not once did I say I ever slept, which means I was awake for about 35 hours since the previous Thursday. its 2:30 saturday morning by this point. haha

SATURDAY

woke up and walked out into the living room to see Sno and Malachi still sleeping, Xeal was awake. the rest woke up and after a bit of talking and stuffs Sno, Silver and I went to Fuzzy's place and Xeal took Malachi downtown. 
After being at Fuzzy's for a while, and after Librem bough 200$ worth of alcohol and BBQ stuffs, Librem, Terminotaur, Ephirem, Silver and I all went to the wave pool for a nice chlorine filled swim. twas nice, too many children, but, still, good times. After the swim we went back to Fuzzy's place, Malachi and Xeal had returned and Dan Racoon had showed up too, as did Thibodeau (who went shopping with the otters before, yes I said otters, not others) in any case, BBQ was had, good talking were had with Xeal and Malachi, who totally attatched herself to Silver and I (mostly Silver *giggles*) Cuddles and discussions were held (BTW, I AM GOING TO ANTHROCON NOW) talkings and laughter was had by many a fur, I got buried, it was all good. we then proceeded to Rappy, Altie and Jayddr's place where Weird al music videos were watched and some funny things happened, not ha ha funny, but OMFG funny. nevermind, I aint sayin nuffin :P good times were had by all, and eventually Silver and I fell asleep on alties bed (who wasnt home)

sometime early morning alty came home and kicked us out of her bed, we slept in the cold basement with a loud horny cat. a non anthro real cat, so, ANNOYING

SUNDAY

Woke up early, Asked fuzz when we were going to the Flea market, he informed me it was 6 AM, I went back to bed and got back up at 10, Fuzz, Malachi, Xeal, Myself, Silver, Fuzzy, Jayddr, Sno, wolfen and Altie all went to the flea market. I spotted exactly what I was looking for as soon as I walked up a row of tables

A transformers dealer...

90$ later I had a bag full of Depthcharge, Optimal Optimus, Transmetal Optimus, Transmetal Megatron, Transmetal cheetor, Wolfang, some trasmetal 2 Hyena Silver wanted, and, uh, I think that was it. good haul, all figures were in decent condition ad had all their accesories. Im a geek. We went back to Alties, Sno and Xeal unfortunatly left to take Malachi back to new glasgow (far away from halifax)  but im glad I made such an awsome new friend :D not everyday you become close freinds with an artist you have liked for many years. Silver and I went home, rested, then went for a walk down to the rotary then visited my lonley father (my mom and bro are in florida) he was delighted to see us and drove us home and got to play with our rats. Fuzz and John came over, dad went home, then Silver, Fuzzy, Jono, and I went to wendys. I had a nice biggie frutipia (I love juice) and the rest has burgers and stuff. I went on to steal a pepper shaker and Jono crushed it with his hand in the car, holding it outside the window, and got a face full of pepper. We drove and drove out to sackville and back. good little fun filled drive around. came back home, hung around, then Silver and I went to bed and the dragon and human headed home.

MONDAY

Weekends suck when they come to an end. but monday was good. went downtown and met up with Kagee (never did update on that situation, things ar great between us and the goat now, just a misunderstanding and stupid shit that doesnt matter, and will never be talked about again :P) we had a good time, shopped around a bit, I bought two movies (Eight crazy nights and Sin City) got a nice leather coller because Silver thought I looked sexy with it. Spotted a nice pair of black wings at Night Magic (an adult themed store) Might buy those for my suit I will be wearing at AC. Silver and I failed at DDR then we went to go see Silent hill AGAIN with Kagee. Kagee liked it, I liked it again. Bougth a few posters (Kill Bill, Resivoir Dogs and Sin City) to decorate our drab apartment. walked to Dalhousi university and met up with Jono, we dropped Kagee off at home and went back to my place,watched a few episodes of beast warsand had a relaxing night. John went home, I went to bed early. 


So, That was my weekend, not behind a cut, deal with it :D I rarley make long posts. Highlights of the weekend: Silent Hill, Group stuff, and MALACHI! shes like, the awsome! *giggles* and she is Silvers new girlfriend *laughs* she rocks, very funny, sweet and talented. 

So, Going to Anthrocon in june, yay, also bringing a good freind here from Alberta at the end of May, cant wait to meet you Heather!!!

And thats all I have to say about that :D

BTW, congratulations to anyone who actually read all that! *laughs*"

"event","Eh, meet at my place is coming this friday. Remember how I said Two people were not welcomed? well, we already asked one of them not to attend (very politly I might add) And he completly lost his mind and withdrew from the list entirely. It was far from what we asked for, but who wants someone like that around anyway? In fact he even posted the polite e-mail we sent him in his live journal and acted extremly immature and childish, anyone who reads it will notice that we were very polite in what we said, he jsut took it too personally and too far. oh well, some people. *shrugs* but that situation is over, drama averted.  

That said, there is a second person who is not invited due to the fact he is a total wack job and annoys the piss out of most of the furs I've talked to, and for some reason thinks he is everyones friend. he is a loudmouth and doesnt know when to shut his fucking yap, and I dont need that at the meet im hosting. whats the catch? hes not on the mailing list, so I cant very well send him an e-mail saying ""Heya! having a meet, sorry you cant come!"" I have to know if he is aware of it or not first. I need to find a way to make sure ""Don fur"" (as he is known as apparently) doesnt show up. 

Ugh

I dont care who goes to local fur meets, its not my comfort that says who cannot and who can show up. but, when its in my living space it is my decision, and the only people I dont want coming are people who few locals like anyhow, and who have already made themselves unwelcome with their attitudes."

It's not my fault people alianate themselves and make there presense unwelcomed.

Acceptance is earned, not found.


===UPDATED FOR MY PARANOID FRIENDS====

Chance are if you are reading this you arent part of the unwelcomed party. 
Seriously, think to yourself ""have I done anything to piss off Kit and Silver?"" or ""Do I go out of my way to make people feel uncomfortable?""

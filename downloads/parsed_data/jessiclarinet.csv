Then I cleaned out my closet and boxed up everything that I either don't use or I just don't need lying around my room because of space issues.  Tomorrow I have to clean my carpet because I dropped make-up on it and it is stained.  So hopefully I can clean it up.  If not maybe I can get some new carpet...something that isn't white.

"event","Well I have finally graduated high school.  It kind of feels wierd!  My brother Christopher and his two kids came from wisconsin to see me.  It was a big surprise!  I was not expecting it.  Then my sister, Martina and her husband Dan and their 5 kids came to visit for graduation.  Then came that faithful day.  When I got into the church where the graduation ceremony was happening I walked over to the band to place my clarinet down and Mr. Sewell approached me and asked me if I wanted to speak while the band played a certain song.  I was absolutely floored.  I was so nervous but I delivered my speech and everyone applauded me.  Then I had to run over to the cafeteria where everyine was lined up and I found out that my line had already left.  I had to chase them down and I was running to catch up.  Finally I caught up to them when they stopped at the door.  And when I walked in I saw that my family had taken up TWO pews!  It was the funniest thing I have ever seen.  Then we came home and had my party...people were here.  It was a madhouse where I live.  But it was great seeing my family altogether for a change.  For graduation I got $450, an MP3 player, white american eagle sandals, and a picture frame with pictures of me from 1st grade thru graduation day.  I was so happy to see those.  Then sunday (today) I celebrated my 18th birthday.  But we were not just celebrating my birthday.  My nephew Kory's birthday was the day of graduation, my brother-in-law Dan's birthday is the 7th, mine is today, and my niece Aramie's birthday is the 10th.  THat's all for now. Oh wait.  I got 2 of those porcelin masks for my birthday from my sister and her kids and husband.  Thats about it!  Goodnight!"

"event","Wow you never realize how good you have it until you have been somewhere that makes you realize it.  I have always taken my hearing for granted.  Well I did until I went to the Ohio School for the Deaf's Basketball game.  It was awesome.  I met my 2 penpals, Judd and David.  They are the two most awesome people I will ever meet.  It was the OSD's homecoming game against St. Mary's School for the Deaf from New York.  ALthough they lost 29-35 David said he has never had so much fun in his life.  My Mother, randy and I went to the game and ran inot Mrs. L-J and her step-daughter, Jessie, and her boyfriend there at the game.   Then on the way home Randy and I were being Randy and I as usual.  You know that old superstition that you hold your breath when you go through a tunnel?  well Randy and I tried doing it but when i got one look at Randy I started busting out laughing.  I mean that kind of laughing that where your stomach hurts and you feel like your jaw is gonna explode.  That's how bad we were laughing.  And then we got to about where Stonecreek Diner is located and my mother asked me what my plans are for prom and at that time i was being stupid and I put my arm around Randy and I squeezed his shoulder and it was the same time my mother asked me the questiona and I did the silent laughter, you know the one where you try to laugh out loud but you can't?  That's what I'm talking about.  And I was gasping for air but I just couldn't breathe.  Finally I stopped laughing and I took a deep breath and calmed down.  I have never had more fun in my life.  Oh I also picked up my current paycheck, $38 and some odd sense.  WOOHOO .  It's because I only got EXACTLY 7 hours of work the last two weeks.  But then again Everyone's hours are being cut back. Everyone that is, except Jenn.  GRRRRRRRRR.  That just makes me mad.  Anyone know of a place that is hiring?  Jk.  Well I better go this is getting kinda long and I'm getting tired.  Oh good news on the sleeping front I went to bed at two this morning and then woke up at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and then finally got more than an hour of sleep until my mom woke me up at 10:45.  So I kept waking up every hour on the hour.  It was strange, I've never done that before.

"event","OK well here's to catching up again.  Friday was our last away game .  It would have been fun had the BEAT (our band magazine) editors and members had been nice and not publish such hateful spiteful things about me.  First they start off with saying that I take to long doing my attendance duties.  I only take as long as I need to do what needs to be done especially when the seciton leaders take forever telling me who's missing and who isn't.  Then they ask if I don't want to march with them (because the feelings mutual!!!!!).   I do want to march with the band but I have things I need to get done and it's not like there is a hole in my spot because I am on a shared spot so therefore there is someone in the spot.  THen they attack my choice of instrument.  If my instrument is such a bad choice why is there 20 of us?  We are the 3rd largest section in this band.  THen they attack my mother asking why she was at the meeting for the beat and asking if she was my bodyguard. NO actually my mother cares about me enough to want to be a help to a band that doesn't even like or respect either of us.  Right now my dad is pissed in fact he went to the PRINCIPAL!!! to get something done.  Come to find out it was Mike, our drum section leader and someone I thought was a friend.  So tomorrow him, and I are going into mediation with the Principal.  Then when that is over I am going into mediation with the editor, and all the people involved in writing the article.  Well these people are going to learn not to piss me and my family off.  Because friday I spent the entire game in tears because I didn't know why these people attacked me and hate me like they do.  Right now I need my brother because I miss him and his protective ways so much and I just need to talk to him.  Right now I have no idea what I should even ask these people.  I could really use some advice.  Personally I just want to know what  I did to these people to upset them and get them to hate me like they do.  because all I ever wanted to do was be a part of the beat and submit some funny things to get people's minds off things that are bugging them.   Well everything I submitted got ""lost"".  SO I told the editor(s) not to include my name in ANYTHING if they were not gonna accept anything I submitted.  well that obviously didn't happen.  I know that of nathan was here he'd tell me everything was alright then he'd suggest something like TPing they're houses (which might not be a bad idea).   Now I know that nobody likes me and that I have no friends.  Myabe i should just quit band, not do any afterschool activities and just worry about school and work.  That way I'd have no friends, and no enemies.  Which I seem to have more enemies than friends."

At the band competition last saturday we earned a superior rating 2nd place percussion 2nd place quard and runner up grand champ again.  Friday our football team won (FINALLY) 14-0 our record is now 5-4. We may still be in the championship running!!!!  Who knows.  Well nothing else though.  Still confused on the whole Kevin/Allan thing.  I eraly like Kevin and I talk to him constantly so I mean I know alot about him which allows me to like hime more but Allan and I are constantly talking and hanging out together.  I am SO CONFOOSED!!!!  I really like Kevin and feel at ease with him but I also really like Allan but I feel different when i'm with him than I do with Kevin almost as if I am different.  ADVICE IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED BUT I AM NOT PIMPING THEM BOTH!!!! (whoever put that on my journal)"

Then during band practice we went over our senior show and or competition show and Rose Parade Bandfest music.  Then I got a comment on my last livejournal entry from my brother and it made me break down and cry.  I miss him alot I didn;t want to admit it but just knowing that right now someone is getting MY time with MY brother hurts because there is just so little time to spend together when he comes back on the weekends.  So now we email each other and leave comments for each other.  STILL NEED ADVICE ABOUT WHAT I SHOULD DO ABOUT KEVIN AND ALLAN!!!!! I like them both alot but I'm so confused on how each one feels about me I tlak to both of them and they both say they feel the same way about me as I do them!!!!! MY HEAD HURTS FROM THINKING TO MUCH. I just want to crawl in my borthers bed and cry because there is absolutely noone to tlak to about how I feel."

I miss the power of your hug when we made up
But most of all 

I miss my friend 
The one my heart and soul confided in 
The one I felt the safest with 
The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again 
And let the light back in 
I miss my friend 

I miss the colors that you brought into my life 
Your golden smile, those blue-brown eyes 
I miss your gentle voice in lonely times like now 
Saying it'll be alright 

I miss my friend 
The one my heart and soul confided in 
The one I felt the safest with 
The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again

The making up

Give me any advice you may have on what I should do!!!   ANyways I heard from my brother (see previous post and look at the comments)  I miss him so much even though we fight i still love him and miss him sometimes I cry because I have nobody to talk to during the day and I am all by myself.  When he did live here at least he was home and we talked often.  But now I have no one and the house os so quiet."

"event","Hey guys I know it has been a while since I've put something on here but I have just been to busy. So I'll start off with August. School started in that month. That month we also had our first football game, against the Reynoldsburg Raiders and we won. Towards the end of August my brother moved down to Portsmouth to attend Shawnee State University. Then in September I didn't do much. Mostly football games and band competitions,. At our first competition we got 9 ones and a 2 for an overall superior rating. That superior rating qualified us for the OMEA State Marching Band Competition. My brother came home for the weekend the weekend of my senior night ( that's when all the seniors in Band march across the field while all their accomplishments are read over the loudspeaker) so that made me happy. Then in October we had our first double header competition. The band had a normal competition where we earned all 3 trophies in ""AA"" Class and all 3 trophies in ""A&AA"" classes. Plus ""Runner-up Grand Champ"". We also earned another superior rating. So now we are heading to states with 2 superior ratings. Then turn around that same night we had our home band competition where we did not sompete for trophies but for ratings. At this competition we earned yet another superior rating. Now we are heading to states with THREE superior ratings. Tomorrow we have no school and we have to go do a thing called the ""Parade of Bands"" at a county fair. Not a competition just something to do for fun. Then friday I have no school. Saturday my friends and I are going to a haunted hotel in Granville. I hope we encounter something!!!!  I NEED A BOYFRIEND!!!!"

Our theme this year is ""The Magic of Oz"".  We did nothing but run the movements and the music all week.  Then that thursday, the 28th was the senior luncheon and i had so much fun.  Thursday night was the band dance and I  had fun up until one of my friends threw me in a chair to keep me from hitting a big fat black idiot.  So then that night was a total bust afterward.  Today mom took randy and I to a pool out in Baltimore to go swimming.  well need some sleep.  Good Night"

"event","Well my oldest brother, Christopher, and his fiance, Jessi, came down from Wisconsin to atend a trading card game convention called Origins and to visit.  I haven't seen him in almost 3 years.  They got in about noon July 1st then Chris, Jessi, and I went to Origins both friday and saturday.  Sunday Mom, Chris, Jessi, and I went to the Columbus Zoo and spent the entire day there.  Monday the rest of my family came over for a July 4th cookout. I had to leave it at 4:30 because I had to be at the school for the parade.  Nathan went camping saturday and sunday and came back monday.  Monday night after the parade I had to work the Papa Murphy's Pizza Stand to raise money for the band but instead spent the nigt walking around with my new boyfriend (?) Kyle, we laid together and watched the fireworks and at the end he gave me a hug, actually quite a few hugs, and then I think he said I love you but it was so low he could have said anything.  Chris and Jessi left this morning.  Nothing much has happened since then.  But I will definiately try to fill in as much as possible to keep everyone up to speed."

"event","Today Nathan, Katie, Zachary, Savannah, Taylor, and I went for a picnic at Minerva Park.  Then Nathan, Savanahy, And Taylor went fishing, I'm too old (I don't have a fishing license).  THen we went over to the docks because they weren't catching naything.  Savanah, Taylor, and I fed the geese and ducks.  Before we even opened the package of crackers we were being swarmed by birds.  I WAS ATTACKED BY GEESE!!!!!!  Blue Collar TV is hilarious...I'm sitting here watching it.  I had band practice last Monday and Tuesday.  Monday was the full band Tuesday was seniors and new band persons.  It was fun but lets face it...FRESHMEN ARE ANNOYING  them and new people who think that they know EVERYTHING!!!! but they don't.  Sometimes I just wanna STRANGLE ALL OF THEM!!!  but i don't.

   Next week Danny Hemphill and I are gonna work on a present for mr sewell,  we are making a football feild and then making ""Marching Weebles""."

"event","Hey everyone! I know this is my first live journal so forgive me if it is weird but oh well.  I have a lot to say. Ready? Here goes: Sunday after prom (the one i was stood up at) was my cousins bridal shower, yeah go her. Monday I had a lot of studying to do and I had to answer a lot of questions about why I was not at prom...I never yelled at him, but I did embarrass him. Tuesday was boring not much happened. Wednesday was okay I mean I was still getting a lot of questions but I was not being witch about how I answered them...No matter how repetitive they were or how mad I got talking about it. Thursday (hmm that would be the 26th right? Oh well) I was really board so a I studied for my exams for 4 HOURS!!!!! Man I was tired after I was done. Friday I went shopping and I got a new fish because it died and I had a 3-day guarantee, then I went over to my Aunt Dianne's house to watch scary movies and so that I could clean her house for her on Saturday. I got a TIM HORTON'S ice cap it was good!!! Saturday I cleaned my Aunt's house because her foot was in a cast after a surgery. I also cooked dinner that night too. Sunday was spent with the family in a park having a picnic (yippie note the sarcasm). Monday (the 30th) was my father's birthday so I spent the day with him. Tuesday was the first day of exams I had 2 of them that day. Wednesday I had more exams 2 of them in fact, but I got out of school at 11:10 am because that was when my last exam of the day was. Today I had my final exam and I got out at 9:15 am and I am now officially a SENIOR in high school. Today was also a friend of mine's party and I met the nicest guy in the world, his name is Conner but he will be a freshman next year and that is just to weird. TWO MORE DAYS UNTIL I TURN 17!!! WOO-HOO Well it was nice catching you guys up. Hope to hear from you! {MOOD: HAPPY yet TIRED}"

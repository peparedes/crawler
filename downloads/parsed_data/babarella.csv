"event","...but I can't help it, I can't help it. It sneaks up on me when I least expect it, in the shower, walking down the hallway at school. I just start thinking about law school, about losing myself in years of infuriating situations, manipulation, and the mind-fuck that language can be. I just start thinking about precedent, or jurisdiction, and it makes me feel kind of shivery all over. I think it's the word-lover in me, who always knew how powerful this shit was, and now here it is, proof positive that we built, and still maintain, the legal aspects of our society entirely with words. A very few words, at that. So much is held up by those very few words, and yet so much of what is considered most relevant to our country all comes down to examining those words and arguing about them using our own words. Meanwhile, all of this is based on the assumption that the men who drafted the Constitution were Right, and that we can interpret their words correctly.
Whatever ""correctly"" is, and who gets to decide?
See?
I argued my first case today, I guess you could say. We weren't even hearing a case, we were arguing whether or not this case could, legally, be heard. I was assigned to be the lawyer for an imaginary plaintiff who I knew had no standing to sue. I knew this from the beginning, so I had a brief internal wrestling match of knowing that I was going to have to argue against my personal beliefs, not to mention the facts. But once I pushed that aside, well, I guess you could say that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, because I argued the fuck out of this case. It was exhilarating, to have to keep constructing and reconstructing and adapting an argument. I pulled out all the stops-- moral and financial obligation of the state to provide quality education to its taxpayers, et cetera. And you know what? I lost. Of course I lost. Dude wasn't directly involved with the controversy, his adult daughter was, and therefore he had no standing to sue. But you know what? I may have lost, but I brought half the class down with me. 4 of the 9 people deciding the case sided with me, the blatantly wrong party. Ha! How you like me now, bitches!
I may have been the most jubilant losing party E154 has ever seen.
I was also shaking the whole time. Making arguments up in front of people is scary! Especially when you know you're wrong!
Whew. OK, so the point is, I've got a little crush on constitutional law."

""the best of 2006 	[Dec. 27th, 2006|01:14 pm]
Today's a good day. Maggie and I have knives in our pockets. Every day is a good day with a new knife. We got them engraved, because it's cheesy and because it's magic. Wrap our love up in violence. Mine says, ""blood"" and hers says, ""guts"" and they fold out and the blade is the same color as the sky. We're going for trouble. We took long showers and put on our christmas deodorant. We've got our hand wraps on. It's boxing day. We're going to find pretty girls with big burly boyfriends. His girl will go nuts with jealousy when he comes with us. We're give that pretty girl a long, calm stare. When she's gone, we'll buy him an Orange Julius, fuck him in the change room at Sears and leave him in the parking lot. We're going to tie Christmas Trees to the backs of parked cop cars today. We're going to slit monster truck tires at the Grocery store and lean against the driver's door to wait. There is nothing like being in love, to make you feel strong.""

reminds me of Andy's story about John D, saying to one of the frat boys ""I'm gonna take your hat. That way, when you see me wearing it around town, you can think 'that's the guy who fucked me.'""

"event","""On summer mornings, when you first wake up, you hear the birds chirping, and a shady green light filters through the leaves, and a coolness in the air means it still feels good to have at least a sheet pulled up over your shoulders. Maybe there is the faint whining and clanking of a garbage truck on a nearby street. For a minute or two you don't even think of any personal facts, like what your name is, or what town you live in, or what kind of life you might be having. Then you hear your mother outside talking to a neighbor or banging around in the kitchen, or you roll over and see your sister, still asleep in the other bed. You know who you are now, and your mind eventually gets around to what you might be doing that day. Which is when your heart feels light or sinks a little bit, depending.""

All Alone in the Universe, by Lynne Rae Perkins, is such a sweet, sad little book. It is about a girl named Debbie whose best friend ditches her for another girl, who is of course characterized as boring and annoying. But really it is about getting wiser, about getting up in the morning day after day and then realizing one day that you see the world and relate to it in a bigger way than you used to. It contains unlikely friendships with grownups, a trashy teenage girl from a messed up family, and a nice description of a magical fall day. It also contains a really awesome little boy from the above-mentioned messed up family, and drawings done by Debbie to illustrate what is going on in her life. But what I really like about it is how the whole thing is so matter of fact, staying in the narrator's voice so well, like it was written by a kid. Like the part where Debbie is late for school and gouges open her leg, ripping her fishnets, by climbing a fence. She doesn't want her mother to know she was late again, so she hides the tights under her bed and forgets to throw them away. Her mom finds the bloody fishnets and is upset and scared, and Debbie doesn't understand why at all. Or the part where she is upset in class and spends a long time drawing the back of the boy in front of her, who is wearing a paisley shirt. Another girl passes her a note asking, ""Do you like Paul N.?"" and she passes one back saying ""No, just his shirt.""
It is very deliberate in the way it is written, with just the right details. Maybe because of this, it reminds me of Long Quiet Highway (one of my favorite books ever), by Natalie Goldberg, only for kids.

Plus the author's jacket bio is super cute:
""...Eventually she moved to Boston where, against all odds, she met a fellow from Michigan whose ideas about life were as impractical as her own. They fell in love, drove to Michigan, and moved into a cabin on a hillside, which has since grown larger and more houselike. They have two small children who like to ski, and a cat who is not very smart.""
Good job, Lynne Rae Perkins!"

I have no physical evidence of my dead friend, except for some neurons that memorized his face, and I was suddenly inspired to see if the website about him was still up. It wasn't, and to make matters worse, some fucking firefighter hero has his same name. I find one entry about him, a list of titles of news articles (not the articles themselves) from his college paper. Just his name and the date of his death. It made me want to run my head into the wall.
I viewed the omitted search terms and there it was. 4 people, living or dead, who I want to have dinner with. There he was. One of the four. And of course it was his brother, not by blood but by ink, by matching tattoos. His brother, who I heard so much about, who is now a musician in Philly. Who also mentioned Mark fucking Schoek, who I believe is some guy Brad and Andy and Megan knew in fucking Oly. (Some wicked sleazy guy, if I recall correctly.)

"event","Last night I was walking home and right down the street from my house was a tall skinny dresser! I am in desperate need of a tall skinny dresser and have bruises on my knees to prove it. Anyway, there one was, so close! I know my eyes were all shiny as I caressed the top and tried the drawers, and this woman walks up to me and says, ""I'm sorry, I'm taking that, my daughter is on the way to pick it up now."" #%$*&^%!!! But it is actually a bit of a relief because one person carrying a dresser two blocks can be difficult. I would have had to take it piece by piece, and what if I came back for the rest and it was gone?
I was on my way back from seeing Little Miss Sunshine, which was great. A & M & I made the mistake of getting the unlimited popcorn bucket. We finished the first one before the film started, and by the time we left-- well, I don't think I need to eat popcorn again for awhile. But then we went to the dirty truth and I wished they had peanuts.

I wake up at 5:30ish and really enjoy knowing that I still have a half hour to sleep. I wake up at 6:00 and wondering how much longer I can do this for. At school I check my email and realize I have no way to get home. I go outside and sit on a rock. The sky is gray and I sheepishly call Solon to see if he wants to bring me home and hang out. It is 8:19am and I know I shouldn't call so early. Haley answers his phone. I tell her what's going on and she seems totally unsurprised. Beyond unsurprised. It is as if I haven't even asked her yet and already she has said yes. Yes, and oh, we can bring you those kitchen chairs at the same time. I hang up and wonder what I have done to deserve these people."

I wanted to ask, why do you feel conflicted about dressing up? I have my own dress-up conflicts so I'm curious about yours. You also said, ""I wish that doing things like wearing a cute dress or writing a check didn't feel so foreign. It's easy to be satisfied when the bar is set low, no?"" and goddamn it, this is the whole feeling behind my wanting a night out the other week, because the world is here, and we're here, and we have these bodies that take amazing amounts of pleasure in the simplest little things, and yet we continually deny them those things for no other reason than-- what? We're too lazy? We don't see the point? Why bother? We don't feel we deserve it? We forget we even can? I mean honestly, it's all right there if we reach out and take it, but generally we don't. Maybe we're too well-trained. But realistically, we don't get very long to do these things. And lately, all I want to do is live my life in a series of moments, one after another, making choices based on what feels good. I'm not talking about becoming totally self-indulgent at the expense of others, I'm not talking about the uninhibited pursuit of self-interest. I'm talking about eating that chocolate cake, because fuck it, it's there and I'm hungry and I'm wearing nice shoes. Besides, as Americans we ALREADY live at the expense of other human beings, so we might as well do it with a little joy, rather then dragging ourselves hand over hand on our bellies across the desert, fingernails bleeding, crying about how hard it is. I mean, you gotta water your garden. You gotta water whatever seeds of happiness there are in there, 'cause nothing can grow without nutrients, it's a biological fact of our biological beings. Nothing and no one else is going to take responsibility for that.
So wait, what is the difference between what I'm suggesting and this whole free market capitalist idea of me me me me mine mine everyone is so hot under the collar about? What I'm trying to convey is that THE THINGS THAT MAKE US HAPPY are 9 times out of 10 EXTREMELY SIMPLE and DON'T COST A LOT and MAKE US TREAT EVERYONE ELSE AND THE WORLD BETTER ALL AROUND but we DON'T DO THEM ANYWAY. And we even pat ourselves on the back for not doing them, for denying ourselves, for our ""control."" Well good job. Maybe it is because we were raised to be good, self-flagellating puritans by our founding fathers.
I would like to note that I'm not advocating for overindulgence. I'm not saying, ""Consume as much as you want. It will make you happy."" I shouldn't have to say this but I think I better: Sometimes NOT doing something can make you 100 times happier than doing something. I'm advocating choosing whatever makes you love things. Any things."

"event","As you can imagine, one thing I think about quite a bit these days is children's books. I have decoded that David Weisner is one of the best authors there is, and this really says something, because my favorite of his works, Tuesday, has no words. But he does draw the pictures.
I won't tell you about Tuesday, because you really have to read it. But I will tell you about Hurricane, another of his books. I read it today. It is based on his childhood experience during a hurricane. The storm knocks down a huge Elm tree next door, and the tree becomes the most amazing thing ever. But then the neighbors have the tree cut up and sent away, and the book ends with the boys staring up at another huge Elm tree, hoping for a hurricane to knock it down so they can play on it.

I like that.

The other book I began today on my break is called Pleasing the Ghost. It is about a boy who has ghosts pass through his room a lot. They blow in the window and talk to him. Somethimes they stay, sometimes they don't, and of course he is the only one who can see them. Things get interesting when his Uncle-as-a-ghost shows up. His Uncle, while he was still alive, had a stroke and was left with Aphasia. Aphasia-- or at least the kind I am used to-- is when words come out differently when spoken than when thought. A person will try to say something and say other words entirely. Sometimes they kind of make sense, sometimes they don't. One of my relatives has it, so that was what grabbed me about the book. Well, that and the cover. So, not only does Dennis have to deal with a ghost who wants him to do stuff, but he has to understand a ghost who talks very cryptically. Although, I must say, the ghost is far more consistant in his word switching than Tony is. It is by Sharon Creech, who is a pretty solid writer. So I have high hopes.

I am trying to be a person who gets the right things done. I am trying to be a person who sends birthday cards to her aunts and uncles and parents. I am trying to be a person who returns calls and pays attention to people. I am trying to be a person who is nothing like my brother."

Oh right! That is another thing. It is funny how your dreams can come true without you really noticing. When I first lived in Amherst, before I had friends and a job, I spent a bunch of time at the adorable little library down the street from my house. I knew the librarians, Ellen and Maggie, and I loved it there. Fast forward three years, and I find out North is hiring. I get so excited, I walk around feeling like I'm in love for a few days. I apply, but do not get the job. Then, a couple of months later, Jess gets me a job in Kids. And now, guess what? Foot in the proverbial door, I'm beginning to fill in shifts at North. Just like that. I trained on friday, and as they led me around I was glad to be walking behind them. That way they couldn't see the big goofy smile on my face. They let me go in the basement. The basement! And here at Jones i get to go in the Staff Lounge. The Staff Lounge!

In this book I have, this guy (high as a kite) asks his friend (also high as a kite) ""What if you woke up between the days, man? You got out of bed and walked into the next room, and there would be everyone you know, only out of character, rehersing scenes for the next day in your life?""
If that happened to me I would punch one of them in the face and say, you aren't making this very interesting.

But seriously, they are. Ya'll are doing a pretty good job. Case in point: after working today I will get on a bus to somewhere I've never been before and two of my favorite people who I saw once in the past two years will whisk me away on an adventure, up Mount Washington, no less. Bring warm clothes.

People die up there, because the winds are so fast at the top. People get blown off every year, I hear.
There have been all of these books about Everest around my house, 'cause now I get to have Andy's library books around as well as my own. Everest and Boy Scouts. Go figure. I curled up with one of the everest books and was of course terrified. Why? I kept asking. ""Why would people do that?"" ""Why do people do anything?""
Good point.
But it was like hurricane seasons. For quite a few years, there were very few everest fatalities. People thought it was safe. People got cocky. And then it got bad again, weather and chance, and no one was prepared. The events of Into Thin Air took place. And I hear the same thing is happening with the hurricanes. We were whelped during a lull, and now everyone says, why is it getting so bad?! When really this is how it normally is.
This from a girl who is about to head to Key West in prime hurricane season. Great. Just great.
This is not very babar-ella-licious. But what can I say, I am waiting for work, and a bus, and last night the bar was just depressing.
Except for the bit about the hops. But that's another story for another time."

"event","So I finally found out why we have to wear hard hats at work. We wear them so we can have a durable inanimate object to beat the shit out of in frustration when we lose our temper. Specifically this can happen when you are stuck outside in the rain with all your stuff and your key won't work in the lock and you took your raincoat off to protect your library books with it and it is 6am and you were too restless to go to sleep at a reasonable hour last night and time is passing and you are soaking and your fingers are sore and the key won't work but you KNOW it works because it has to work because it has worked before but it won't work and there is a drip carefully designed to drip directly onto your hand as you try to make the key work, like some kind of awful early morning water torture. And not only did you spill salt in your oatmeal again, but you also know that wet is a one way street on a day like today, and you aren't likely to dry even if you ever do get inside.
After awhile, I put my hard hat to good use, smashing it against the concrete walls surrounding me and the metal door in front of me. Then I finally found out why we have those cinderblocks lying around-- so that when you no longer find smashing your hard hat into impervious objects satisfying, you can pick up a cinderblock, throw it at the concrete wall, and kick the door several times. I can honestly say it is a damn good thing that it was 6am, and no one was around to see me totally lose my shit and take my aggression out on my surroundings.
I wish I could tell you how I managed to get the key unjammed and the door to open, but by that time I was so blinded by rage that I honestly have no idea how it happened. Sheer willpower, maybe.
Good thing I had some cds from the stack I never listen to, and a letter to write, and those chocolate mint Newman's oreos.

I recently learned that I have the appropriate physical characteristics to be a professional cyclist, that is, weighing less than two pounds per inch of height. The difference is, of course, that each of their two pounds is 95% muscle, whereas my two pounds is used for storing energy as fat. After the revolution, I will last so much longer than them. But I digress.
This fact, and the adding of air to my tires, inspired me to go for a little bike ride after work yesterday. I had had this dream that Shannon was really pissed at me for making fun of stoners (""It's not funny, Emily! That's a really serious lifestyle choice for some people!"" ""Uh, no Shan, it actually IS really funny!"") so I decided to  ride to her house. I made it up about 1/56th of the Sand Hill hill before I was basically standing still and fell over. The garbage can-sized potholes didn't help, but mostly it was just my out of shape winter ass. Conserving energy as fat, remember? A bear at rest is a smart bear. I read it in National Geographic.
Shannon wasn't home, and on the way back the sun was hot, and I decided I should buy some beer, since I was passing a liquor store. But I had not brought a backpack or anything, and I did not trust my already wobbly situation with anything as un-balancing as a plastic bag of glass and liquid, especially not with all the maniacs from Jersey and points east tearing around for graduation. I leaned my bike against the wall and went into the video store.
""Excuse me, do you have any duct tape?""
A few minutes later I was laughing out loud, riding home on my crazy rusty little folding bicycle with a 24oz bottle mummified in packing tape to the bottom tube, where people tend to put their water bottles. There was a rare moment of no traffic, and riding down the center of the road I thought about my grandfather, because it was his bike, and I don't know, for those moments I was the happiest girl in the world."

Helgerson appreciates my awful jokes. We got a fish called a White Sucker, and I wanted to yell, ""So long, Sucker!!"" when we let it go. I told him this, and he told me he was playing golf the other day and hit a birch tree, to which he responded ""Son of a Birch!""

Megan's songs make me feel like waking up on a snowy morning in a house full of friends and no one has to go to work. she makes me feel like hot chocolate. I put my hand over my heart and kept trying to drunkenly explain this to her, but I think I only succeeded in scaring her. sigh. 
the rest of the show was good too. it made me realize that boys who dance at shows are few and far between around here, so if you find one ladies, you may want to hang on to him. i am not trying to be mean to any of my beloved nondancers. this is harsh reality. Also, at this show, I decided to cut my hair.

Then I went to a costume party. I knew one person there and peripherally knew two others. It was great. There were lots of hot girls, including a nurse with no pants, and there was punch and dancing. I was dressed as an orphan from Annie. I had pigtails, and I decided not to cut my hair yet, and just wear pigtails more instead.

V-day proper we celebrated at the home of Jesse & Ashley with obscene amounts of food, some people we didn't know, and a viewing of r. kelly's ""trapped in the closet"", an absolute must-see.

Speaking of the meat and all it wants, that's from William Gibson, reminding me: The night I spent in SEATAC, swearing and trying to sleep, an old man sitting next to me was reading Count Zero. And out west, J's amazement that I had read those books, the camaraderie that comes from realizing that years before you ever met you were turning the same, antisocial pages.
I guess my girlness makes me slightly more of an anomaly, as the katana-wielding selfstyled zen teacher on speed in SF pointed out to me. This teenage kid and his homeless hustler disciple, I had stumbled across them in a park, in the midst of a spiritual quest, and impressed them with my knowledge of medieval weapons, prompting an invitation to join them. Carlos seemed convinced that I had appeared to satisfy the baser needs of his master, and just after sunset vanished off into the sunset, leaving the kid to take me back to his parents house, across from the san francisco zen center, where I further impressed him with my knowledge of fantasy worlds and he came down. His father was a zen priest. The kid lived in the basement in a room with 3 beds but he slept on the floor. He made tea and didn't offer me any, and told me the plot of a trilogy he would write. His mom got home and looked me up and down as though I might steal the silver. I probably should have. I was becoming an expert at arching my eyebrows. In the middle of the night I walked back to scotty & hooper & jei's apartment where I was sleeping on the couch, through frighteningly empty streets. The kid emailed me but I never answered it. I was tired of listening to people talk. So instead I told my incredulous, late 20's hosts of my adventures. I was 18 and I loved them. They were like hipsters but this was before I knew what hipsters were. All I knew was that they spun records and wore old sweaters and played music and designed clothing, and that they had taken a virtual stranger with illfitting clothing into their home, where she cooked more than they did, and by the time she left, they seemed reluctant to see her get on the train.
whew. long time ago. the kid was going to go to school out here, a couple times I've thought I saw him, but never spoken to him. I could never quite tell.

I am listening to Bonnie Raitt. Bonnie Raitt is awesome. I love country music. and rap. you hear that, Pom? In writing."

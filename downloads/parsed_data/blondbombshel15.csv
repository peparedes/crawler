"event","Tonight isn't that great of a night.  I was happy but now I'm not.  I just e-mailed my brother Ben and told him about some stuff that has been bothering me lately.  He's away at college so sometimes it's best to go to him since he knows people here but he's not here at this point in time so I get an outside opinion.  My mom did order me some things from a catalog and that was cool but it was after that that I started getting unhappy. Oh well, life goes on, I guess.  I'm supposed to go to the movies with Chad tomorrow.  Friday is sort of ""our"" night.  We get kind of busy sometimes so it's nice to have one day that we try to make plans with eachother.  And for the last maybe 2 months we've spent every Friday night together.  (not always just us, sometimes with other people too).  We haven't really hung out since like Saturday.  I wanted to ask 2 other friends to go too but now I kinda feel like just staying in my room.  I don't wanna be a hoe, but I just don't know.  I'm sure tomorrow will be different but that doesn't mean I'll wanna go out and be my normal happy, bubbly self.  Well, I'm talking to Mary so I'm out.

Considering this is public, I won't be specific....but I'm kinda pissed at one of my friends.  Not too pissed to be cool to them and everything but there's part of me that's pissed.  I think it's something I should just let go because sometimes it's better to do that than cause chaos for no reason.  I'll get over it.  I just printed 
all my computers work.  I hope I did it right cause for some reason I have a B+ and I need an A.  I'm signing out today for a doctor's appointment and then signing back in.  I'm gonna be busy all this week so I'm gonna try to go to bed as early as I can.  I have to go to football everyday after school, float meetings at my house after practice and then homework.  Friday is the homecoming game and parade and Saturday I have to get up early to get my hair done.  Thrilling.  Man, some people bug me, lol.  I have about 30 minutes left in class. Wow, that's gonna be boring.  I'm gonna go sit by Brett and Bates and Court and see what games they're playing.

A few of us stopped by the sophmore float meeting, lol.  We just walked in the backyard and we were like whats up.  We can't get in trouble cause it's not like we did anything to their stuff.  It took us forever to get the pizza too.  My mom and dad bought everybody pop and food and stuff and my sister told us to order it from this one place.  So we did but she left before telling us where it was.  So we called and they told us it was on these 2 streets and that was a totally different city.  It was a little adventure.  I hope our float turns out good cause we're working hard on it.  We have pajama day tomorrow.  I might start writing in here more often when I have nothing to do in computer class.  I usually just e-mail people but this is another idea.  Well I think I might go nap.  I'm freezing cold from being outside for hours and I'm sleepy.  :)

He cracks me up and he's so sweet.  He talks like a little adult too.  It's awesome.   I like someone....I know, I know....bad idea....BOYS ARE TROUBLE!  But what can you do about feelings?  They sorta have a mind of their own.  But with my luck I'm just gonna end up hurting myself.  We're starting to build our float.  We've just been making flowers now we're starting to build.  So that's cool, I think I'm gonna have meetings almost everyday for the next 2 weeks.  Gina's parents are going out of town again the week before homecoming.  Sometimes I wanna shoot myself in the head so I can't make mistakes...lol.  I'm tired, but awake at the same time.  I guess what I mean is I'm tired but I couldn't fall asleep if I tried.  But I can think of anything more boring to write.

I'll get over it eventually.  I guess there's not really much more to say!!  As for guys, well, they're trouble....

"event","well, haven't been online much, or written in here.  football started and it's so fun being a trainer.  it's really hot but we have a lot of fun and there's this big sprinkler that is so cool.  we work a lot harder than people probably think.  we're always worried the guys will get dehydrated and stuff cause they work *really* hard and it's terribly hot.  anyway, my 16th birthday is friday.  then saturday we're leaving on vacation.  i don't think i'm gonna go to warped this year, i really don't feel like it.  so i'm out, later."

"event","Hey, I don't really have much to say.  I'm just doing good.  Trying to cope with different things in life.  I'm gonna be a football trainer this year and we (me, Leah, Ashley, and Trina) had to go to a class to learn how to wrap ankles and wrists on Tuesday.  It's so hard to rip the tape.  Ashley is the only one that can really do it.  Oh well, we'll get the hang of it.  The guy wrapped my ankle to demonstrate and he cut me!  He used bandage scissors but the dull part jabbed into my leg cause the tape was on so tight and he cut my leg and there's a bruise and stuff.  It's alright though, I'll live.  Well, I better go get ready for the day."

"event","Hey, I'm having a pretty good day.  I did yesterday too.  During the day I was sorta weak and tired but then I went to this car cruise around here.  I had to sell stuff for cheerleading.  Then Amanda, Carol, Gina, and I just drove around.  It was fun.  There were some sweet cars there.  My mom surprised me the other day.  I woulda never expected my parents to let a boyfriend or girlfriend go on a trip with me or my brothers or sister until we were like 18 (which all of them are older than 18) but she was like, ""is kevin going up north with us or is one of your girl friends going?""  I was like woah!  So I gotta see if he even wants to and see if his parents would let him.  lol  I'm really bored right now.  I pratically never read and have only finished a few books in my life, but I'm reading the Virgin Suicides and it's interesting so far.  I might go read that in a little bit.  I got my ear pierced on the other side.  So now it looks the same as the left side. (3 holes on each)  I love cheesy 80s music, I'm such a dork.  :)  Sometimes I want to get a job and then other times I realize that I don't want a job until I really need to get one.  I hope I can start a band one day.  That's something I really want to do in life.  Well, I'm out to go read and find out what I'm gonna do today.  Later!!  *~*Molly*~*"

"event","My friend, Kristina, is going up north today.  I've been wanting to go on vacation and going up north is so relaxing and so much fun.  We're going in August.  But I wish I could just go up there myself anytime I wanted to.  I really need to go on vacation, anywhere, but soon!  My boyfriend, Kevin, told me last night to call and wake him up so he can do his chores and be ready for the day earlier.  But of course, as usual, nobody answered.  It's like nothing can wake him up, lol.  I really wanna go to Traverse City or Mackinac Island. I better quit dreaming about how fun it'd be if I could leave today.  :)  Anyway, I guess I better go dry my hair and stuff.  Later."

"event","I'm bored.  I'm also tired but can't sleep.  It's too early to fall asleep.  I think sometimes the best kind of release is when you just chill by yourself in a comforting, relaxing place.  I've yet to find a place like that where I have easy access.  It's like I'd need a ride or something.  For the past 2 weeks I've had terrible head aches.  For the first maybe 3 days I had a head ache all day everyday.  Then they started coming and going.  But they come more than they go.  It really sucks and I don't know why.  I was thinking it might be stress, but then I thought I'm probably dehydrated (which is what my mom thinks and brought to my attention).  Or maybe a combination of both.  I don't drink enough fluids, especially water, and it's pretty hot out, and I'm also stressed so they're equally possible.  Well, I suppose I should go lay down or something.  Later."

"event","Well, I don't exactly know what to talk about.  Today is the 4th of July and we had some family over earlier.  I guess it's a pretty good day.  And I also realize that considering this journal is open for people to read I might not want to put too personal of things on here.  I discovered something that affected me a little and I'm gonna need to talk to somebody about.  I just don't know when that opportunity will be given.  Anyway, I'm in a really weird mood.  I think it's hormonal, cause I've been getting in weird moods pretty often the last week or two.  I decided I really need to take drivers ed though.  I want a car for next summer so I can work at a campground not too far from here and drive there.  My brother, Ben, is home for the day.  It's cool to see him, I miss him being around.  I need a vacation, lol.  Well, I'm out.  Later."

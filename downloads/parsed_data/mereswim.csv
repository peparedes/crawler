"event","So, I have concluded in my infinite wisdom (snerk) that believing God has all the answers is like copying off of someone's test in school. It's lazy. I mean, why not come up with some thoughts of your own? Granted they won't be super original most likely (given surely others have had the same thought) but at least it's not flipping to the end of a Choose Your Own Adventure book and finding out the answer long before you've even played the game. I was usually smited by a dragon, but hey I got there on my own.

Now, now, deep breaths everyone, I'm not saying religion is a negative. I know many God-believing (I hate the term God-fearing) people who can carry on an intelligent conversation where their opinions are rooted in religion deep down but that don't lead with ""Jesus says.."" or ""the Bible says"" or ends with ""thus spake the glory of our Lord"" or whatever. They can have an opinion about politics, about life, about personal philosophies that don't break down to the big man in the sky.

Lately though it's been infuriating. Example...

Me: I just get frustrated with people sometimes.
Him: People always disappoint and will always fail.
Me: Thanks for the pep talk chief
Him: No, I mean people will always disappoint you, only God won't.
Me: AAACK!
Him: Nothing is more comforting than the arms of God.
Me: Uhhh..
Him: Sorry, I can't turn it off.

Thing is, yeah you can. It's funny, I feel like he was religious but normal before and now he's like on religion overdrive. If there is a God, he's probably hugely bored with people talking about him in the most inane mid-week conversations.

God: AGAIN? Geez if it a rest.

There was a great columnist online that said imagine God as your mom when you were a kid. Somethings are not worth bugging mom over if mom needs some downtime. Sometimes mom needs a break, mom is in the tub so don't bug her. So all this praying in food courts over a thing of french fries, or thanking God for your son's t-ball game, or reality stars or football players or beauty pageant contestants praying God helps them win? Or that you find your car keys? Maybe God has bigger fish to fry. There's an idea. Yadda yadda omnipotent universal God knows all and sees all. Maybe God's in the tub when it comes to your tiny little bullshit problems. And maybe, juuuust maybe you should leave God out of it entirely except for the Great Big Stuff of death, disease, famine, depression, heartache, addiction, danger, whatever.

I mean, maybe this is why the whole middle east mess is even around. God's TRYING to do something but he keeps getting all this easy little crap to deal with.

God: Wow the middle east file is huge, maybe I should just get these little things out of the way first...

OK, now I'm being silly. It's folks' business to pray to God for whatever little thing they please and it's my prerogative to find it absolutely silly. Respectfully. But I find it silly.

I just feel like when you're an atheist (me) talking to the devout (him) and you're trying to have a convo and they keep bringing it back to Jesus it does one of two things.

1. Alice in Wonderland logic:

How do I get to X? Jesus
What is the meaning of Y? Jesus
What do you do when you are faced with Z? I ask Jesus

2. Makes me feel like you're trying to convert me.

I mean, really he could answer bologna sandwich and it'd give me the EXACT same response. It might make me hungry and make me roll my eyes less, but you don't hand a vegetarian a side of beef when he says he's hungry and I wouldn't tell him to go .. I don't know... to a pro-choice rally. Know your audience.

Can you imagine an SNL sketch where instead of a Bible study group it was an ice cream study group? Like all they talked about was how awesome ice cream was? And how ice cream is the answer. And sometimes I think about how ice cream changed my life. It'd be hilarious.

I know, I'm terrible. Truthfully, I can't comprehend religion, all I can do is (try) to respect people's choices. I joke, but really I would never tell someone to abandon their belief structure or turn their back on their philosophies. I guess though I'd certainly like to know the whys behind it. It's hard for someone to just give me a book, or a one word (God) answer as to their motivations or why they believe. Circular reasoning and all that.

I mean people believe in God and say it's everywhere but then don't like the idea of their kids learning about God when they're old enough to decide their own religion b/c you have to be taught young for it to stick I guess. I don't get the logic in that.

I just wonder how I can be friends when I can't relate. I mean, if we can't relate to one another and we're always hitting that wall how do we ever really get to know one another? I feel like it's just a way to build in distance and sweep problems under the rug by not dealing with them.

Other people approach religion in a very healthy manner. I feel like he sort of just regurgitates without thought. Just, tunnel vision. It doesn't even sound sincere to me, and I know plenty of very devout people who can relate to other people. It's like an addiction with this kid, trying to achieve perfection. It's almost like... he's alcoholic and religion is the bottle.

I know, so blasphemous today. Sorry kids.


Sidenote: hopefully getting car back soon! Yay for insurance!"

"event","I am out and about suddenly. Being me again. I still feel sort of ""meh"" about certain people and things, but screw it I'm not wasting my time on someone who didn't give two shits when we were involved. I might as well get back out there and spend time with folks who give me good feelings, not feelings of uncertainty.

Of course, I feel like maybe he did me a big favor. Annoying thing is while we were involved I could've been open to dating alot of guys I met during that time. I put them off because I was *with* him. Looking back I want to slap my forehead at what an idiot I was. Luckily, I can make up for lost time.

I've a got a few things cooking. Basketball games, cd release parties, drinks with potentially new friends, hockey games, gym after work. Keeping busy, best way to do these things I suppose. Swimming tomorrow morning and hitting the treadmill and bike after work. Got some things to do.

Looking over the grad school thing, realizing I could get into a grad program quite easily. Just a matter of where and how much. We'll see what is cooking... maybe look at Northeastern's psychology program, I hear it's pretty good.

On the upside I have a few dates lined up. Weird, no? Guess once you just decide you're available, people start noticing.  I'm a little excited about it. We'll see how it goes..."

"event","And this is the last journal post probably for awhile. I'm off to DC for the holidays. My Dad will have his buzzy, whirring, electrical gadget inspired Xmas tree in the very back room (at Kathie's request) of the house, strung with santysauruses (white lights, inside plastic dinosaurs that have little santa claus coats painted on them... my family.. don't ask.. made be an artist friend) and with the death star, darth vader, various trekkie memorabilia. Insane.

We'll have my Dad's famous lasagna the minute I get in the door and I will be inundated by the zoo that is my Dad's house (soo many animals). We'll hang out, maybe watch a movie, I'll wrap presents. 

My Mom will take my brother and I to lunch, I'll see my friend Wayne. And Josh and his gfriend. Chrissy, Charlie, Rigel, MIchael, Danny, Kelly, Nicole, Jared, Miranda... etc etc and so forth.

I'm bringing my swim gear so I can swim every morning at the Y near my Dad's house. I have toll money, gas money and food for the road. My coworkers got me a hat and a scarf that I'll probably wear. And I have all my cds ready to go to make every minute on the road a fun lively time.

I'm excited about getting away. 10 days away from the usual. Should be a nice escape. Getting to be around some of the best people in my life, and the people who will always love me.

Have a great Xmas everyone and a wonderful New Year.

Love

"event","I'm going down Cape to a party and my boss is so nice she suggested I leave early. Gads they love me here. It's so nice to be appreciated for the work you do, and to be seen as intelligent and capable at your work. My old job they never really showed appreciation and if they gave any sort of ""thanks"" or ""good job"" they were so proud of themselve... it seems like they lacked common sense. 

I think they also knew I was too smart for the job (as are most people who work there). I got told by so many of the scientists ""What the hell are you doing here, you are too smart for this crap, you should be in grad school"".

Working with grad students now I realize, looking over their transcripts, GPAs and writing skills that I could get into a very competitive grad school program. My GPA? Higher. My GRE? Higher. Writing skills... I think I could mop the floor with about 80% of the applicants. And I am surprised, frankly. I always knew I tested well, that I was smart, but I lost sight of that surrounded by MIT people. Misspellings, typos, and frankly alot of it just lacks any sort of shape or voice. I think more people should write the way they talk. Then you know what you're getting into. I need to think seriously about a grad program. I like my job, but this is not my lifetime career. Onward and upward.

I'm going to the infamous Shop Party with the Dark n Stormy tent, the margarita hut, the 200+ people, blues band, room of friend turkeys, beers on tap, bottle chick beer that I like and surrounded by good friends and former coworkers at WHOI. WHOI always knew how to throw a party. And I get to hang out with them, crash at my friend Scott's and then go see my gparents and do some last minute Xmas shopping.

I am feeling pretty good. Coming to alot of realizations about my life and about others. I think I am getting my bearings again and realizing some very good things about myself. And I'm also realizing things I need to do, and just mentally getting my bearings back.

As many of you know it's been hellish lately, but I'm realizing I'm probably in a better place than other folks involved in this whole mess. You know? Anyways, I feel like I'm figuring stuff out... and I feel strong. Which is hard to say, really. I may get wobbly later, but I am just reminding myself of alot of things.. and it helps."

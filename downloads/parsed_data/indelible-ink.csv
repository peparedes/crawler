The good bits:
The fantastic food courtesy of John and Fred.  Wonderfully tasty and hot and very very welcome.
A bunch of harts doing a sicilian flavoured ritual to call up Cadarn, and him actually appearing!
Ceri's new character being the perfect mix of Albione noble and troublemaker.
The deadly rescue mission that resulted in more people dying than the number we had rescued.
The fact that we went back 3 times to pick up anyone we could rather than leaving them to die in the dark (sorry we missed some of you!)
Darkness, shades, wraiths and vengence zombies.
The very brief trip (repeating) to Sherburn Keep and subsequent entropy deamon fishing.
Having to kill a vengence zombie Scrat, and then having to kill a vengence zombie Straif a couple of hours later.
The military coup after Michael carked it.
Swapping stories, gambling and fighting with the super gypsies.
Almost getting eaten by a shade in the dark.  Thank goodness it was so dark that his fellow undead mistook him for a hart and kept hitting him.
Taking down William Hulce by mistake in the dark (tall shadowy, looming, who could blame me?)

The bad bits:
The rain (oh my how wet was that?)
The court of lies/court of truth forgiveness/vengence subplot which seemed a little dull.
The rain
The site was good although I felt that everything was very centred around the hall and we could have definitely gone off further afield for linears and whole group stuff.  
Also having the (slightly too easy) Alderyork fight in the same field as the ooc tents was a bit uninspiring.
My PVR failing to record the second part of the first tourchwood episode (thank goodness its being repated tonight coz the first half was great).

More change on the IC front again as Michael was killed on the rescue mission of death I wonder who is going to do the job now.  It'd be great to have a very strong character to give the faction a bit of leadership.  Keep on going with the faction unity/strength thing.

Also I'm looking forward to more low fantasy/comlicated characters plot adversaries that people were talking about at the agm.  ::fingers crossed::"

"event","Right then here goes.

I had a great time, the only time I was bored was Sunday afternoon when absolutely nothing seemed to happen for an exceedingly long time.
<lj-cut text=""Watching the end of the world"">

Watching the end of the world:

So as Theo has sage astronomer we knew when the end of the world was going to start so HC the black hand and the grimmirs went down to the marketplace for a look see.  We sat and watched, nothing happened, we watched some more, nothing happened, the start alligned and then stopped, but nothing else happened.  Where were the fireworks, the booms, the crashes, the screams?  Needless to say Andy got bored and wandered off to see if the end of the world was happening in the ritual circle.  After he didnt return for 5 minutes many of us followed to check he hadnt been killed.  Never ever go into a ritual circle when you know that the end of the world is due.  So in we went.

So inside its terribly impressive, dragons breathing smoke and large pools of shiny water, and also a ritual was taking place where all the high mages seemed to be giving the dragon a large tooth in a box, which it was explained to me had been taken during the last cataclysm.  So the ritual seems to go well, the high mages are congratulating each other and patting each other in the backs when a dracknor walks over and very politely taps one on the should. ""a word of advice"" he says ""run, run like girls, RUN YOU FOOLS ITS THE END OF THE WORLD!""  Not needing any more information than that mages and spectators alike pegged it (the mages hitching their skirts) We burst out of the ritual circle screaming ""run RUN!"" and didnt stop until we were half way across the field.  There was a very small rumble behind us and a puff of smoke.  Welcome to the end of the world.  Later we found out that the Dracknor hadnt been quick enough and had died on the spot, it turns out that the ref standing in the door way was to kill anyone who hadn't made it out of the ritual circles after the cry of ""end of the world"".  Good thing we shifted it. </lj-cut>

For future reference we want fireworks and loud bangs at the end of the world.. even turning up the sound system in the ritual circle to real loud for some rumbles and bangs would have helped...

Fights:

<lj-cut text=""Dragons"">
Dragons:

Rolling the dragons was fun.  they fought quite fairly, and some of their guys were exceedingly snacky.  

The Dragons coming over for a fight and getting rolled again was also fun.  I enjoyed lining up against Stu, its always fun to see an old enemy who you assumed had died. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Cadre fight"">
Cadre fight:
The fight itself was mostly fun although less fun as I seemed to be consistantly lining up against this rubbish girl with two swords who thought stabbing was the height of good fighting.  That and she had a right evil gob on her and whinged every time someone got a hit in.  Hope I never see her again.

That forbidding apart from for vipers banner is sick, sick I tell you!  ::grins:: needless to say a certain amount of the fight was spent watching the vipers do rites. 

The goals of the fight were overly complicated for my small brain and so it really was a case of point and fire..""kill that lot aisla"", ""yes sir!"" ""come on lads!"" which worked quite well.  We didnt really have a difficult fight of it and we had enough people to rotate the front fighters for armour repair.Ritual of peace being its usual 10 minutes kept more people in the fight.  I don't think anyone died on Sunday at all. 

Conclusion:
Not a bad fight, overly complicated goals and a bit of a damp squib ending. </lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""Deamons of doom fight"">
Deamons of doom fight:
Whoar.  What a fight.  The initial crush us from the front with the MA and then open a rift directly behind us ref plan was stupid as all f*ck, but I think that everyone knows it and it wont happen again.  Anyway use of the Harts ""cheese it"" manouver proved necessary when it was getting so cramped that we couldn't fight even slightly safely and were being squeezed from both sides.  Adrian (usually the quietest man alive) was very angry at this point and left the fight to go and have a word with the refs, we didnt see him again until the end.  Also one of the MA monsters stopped the fight on his side and all the monsters stepped back when they realised it was just getting insanely dangerous and the fight wasnt being stopped by the refs.

The monsters were statted harshly and I have never been so glad for shield mastery, although it didnt help agains the artifact crushing mask!  The harsh statting help scare the crap out of us players though and genuinely made the entire end of the world experience seem like and end of the world experience.  All in all perfectly statted and enough deaths to make you feel like a survivor at the end.  Although as a survivor I must say that if the refs hadnt backed off those monsters in the end during that first fight, I think all the Harts would have been toast.

Everything that follows is ranting about bits of the battle that were great so feel free to skip down a section:o)

So we funnel out and cheese it to a secondary position picking up wounded on the way (well as many wounded as we could carry.  Next fight we get squeezed again (this time due to the flank folding back, and I get popped out the opposite side of the monsters to the rest of the harts. Harsh.  There being no way to fight it back into the line I do the only sensible thing and peg it, followed by 4 deamons. Cue Benny Hill like chase across the field, with me wearing my mail and doing my ninja turtles impressionwith my shield on my back. <lj user=""oldnick""> who was marshalling was watching on with a degree of amusement.  luckily I had a head start and some wolves came to my assistance before it all got too nasty.  Thats how I lost the harts.  

Anyway I whole set of adventures ensued that I wont go into detail needless to say there was a certain amount of pegging it between groups trying to get back to the harts, a large amount of fighting, and a few occasions where I was lying on my back bleeding out thinking, ""this is it"".  

The one occasion I will relate is how I got dropped whilst in a bunch of bears and they scarpered.  So there I am bleeding from the chest, man in yellow with a stopwatch above me, seemingly noone about for miles.  Suddenly this steak of brown pegs it from a group and dashes towards me. as he gets to me I see a youngish lad (probably only just old enough to take part in the battle) ""sehrh skdjfie sdkfj woisk wound!"" he screams at the top of his voice whilst ripping a card and then he runs off at top speed.  the ref looks at me, looks at the rapidly disappearing lad, and then at his stopwatch. ""that'll do although those vocals werent great he said and stopped the stopwatch.  about 5 minutes after this a retreating group picks me up with another dose of incanting.  Huzzah for incanters, they saved my life loads of times in that battle.
</lj-cut>

So there you go, over all much fun was had and many shiny fights."

"event","Well the HG was good.  I think we came 6th over all only got really trounced in troll ball (phoar those double body dev, crushing/strikedown players are hard).

The mood of the games was very good.  Only saw 2 really blatent cheats all weekend which made a refreshing change. Probably my best games for many years.

Although the faction was exceedingly low on numbers we actually got out and did things all weekend which made a nice change.  The more proactive stance is definitely welcome and the players seem quicker to make decisions and act on them. I like the fact that not everything needs to be passed all the way up to the npc's for final approval, this is definitely a good thing.

All in all lots of fun.

A big huzzah to the house of glass chaps for their hospitality after timeout.  I love the final battle song!"

"event","The scooter isn't written off, its a weird kind of damage apparently, they don't often see all the stuff crushed under the back wheel but he says provided the engine itself is unscathed then it shouldn't cost more than the bikes worth to repair it.  What I might do is get paid, pay off some of my debt and then start having driving lessons. Then once I have passed a test trade the scooter in for a car. It'll be more expensive, but I'm kind of of the opinion that there are a lot of very unobservant people out there and I don't want to be dead because of one of them.  Will be driving on the scooter for a while yet tho...so vroooom.

<lj-cut text=""Event and GLM writeup cut for the uninterested"">
In other news the event this weekend brought the Cornwall plot to a close.  A couple of very fun games of jugger were played, I need some practice, the amount of mutual hits that were taken was just silly. 6 months is just too long to have between events. The event itself was a little quiet, but it was a nice gentle start to the year and I don't think I could have handled anything too exciting due to a very dodgy curry on the Friday night.

It was discussions in the GLM that made up the most interesting part of the weekend.  Alison (and I presume rozywyn) is an NPC. I'm very pleased with this.  I think she'll do a good job and I also think its a good idea not to have an all male NPC group.  John is stepping down which I think is a shame.  Dave is 1ic, Alison 2ic, no 3ic and Kev is 4ic.

Dave Y put forward an idea which I think is a sensible way forward.  He wants the Harts to get back to a Heirarchical feudal system as currently the Harts are a bit pale and lily livered and theres just not real atmosphere or feel to the faction.  Sounds good in theory, and it might even work if we all get on board.  Following orders you disagree with (""be polite to the ambassador Aisla!"") has always been fun with Sagramor so I dont see why it shouldnt be with the new ic's.

Ian suggested a change in the way the camp is set out as it's a bit of a dead zone, and the ic's are thinking of buying a different marquee with a big open front to make things a little more atmospheric and open.  I think the faction could really benefit from having bards in the command tent to make it a bit more of a focus, as I can't sing or play I'm not volunteering, but those with musical talent should definitely give it a go.

We had a chat about types of plot liked/disliked.  There seemed to be push towards lower fantasy style plots, with less necromancy/walking ancestors/possessions and more challenges against foes with a ""human"" face/motives.  I'm all for things that will get me riled up and I'm far more likely to get riled up against a charasmatic ""grey"" leader who has killed my friends rather than a faceless void entity.  I find it interesting when they play with the idea that the bad guy isn't actaully a completely evil creature but rather a person with motives who might have a point if it weren't for the fact that they are acting against you.  There were also a few comments that people prefered plot that necessitated moral decisions and that reacted to character's decisions.  Like screwing something up and having it bite you in the arse.  I really like that dawning realisation as you realise that something you did years ago has just reared it ugly head.

The thing I really want to see is the return of the harts to a decent fighting force.  We're just far to few in number to actually present a problem in any big fights.  If you die and are coming back as a hart please consider taking some decent fighting skills and be willing to use them.

Finally the faction is going to produce yearly accounts just so the players have some idea of how money is being spent and so that rumours about the ic's spending all the cash on weekend bashes in corsica with drugs and wimmin can be nipped in the bud.  But noone is sure how much money/lack of money the faction currently has.  Which I suspect is indicative of said drugs and wimmin binges;o)  But seriously I am intriegued as to how much money an event costs to run, you've got all these things that as a player we just take for granted and I have no idea how much a mainline costs for a faction, you've got tent hire and bin bags and flowerpots and allsorts.  Does someone pay for the petrol for the giant gate to be driven to the events?  how does it all work?

"event","So had an interview for a job, it looks like an interesting school.  Not sure if I got the job or not as I think they want someone with more experience in upper ks2.  I find out this afternoon.

In other news: I didn't die.

It's amazing the difference being on a scooter to being in a car makes for a simple booting at a roundabout.  Picture the scene, hailing, spring shower, roundabout.  I slow to give way to the right and the mercedes behind me boots me up the bum.  If I'd been in a car I would have moved a little and had a small amount of damage.  Being on a scooter I shoot forwards, fall off the bike, bash my head and have my life flash before my eyes as a red van goes past a few feet from my head.  

My poor scooter is screwed.  everything that stuck out past the read wheel has been sucked under and jammed the wheel solid and the suspension is at its limit.  the bodywork has nairy a scratch on it apart from the fact that its folded in half until just before the seat.  The engine was making the most fantastic reving noises, the handlebar is bent and theres a pipe I didnt know existed hanging out from under the scooter and spewing forth either oil or petrol.

Anyway I digress.  I celebrated shrove tuesday with a thoroughly nice pigging out on pancakes with sugar lemon and quark (the chese not the star trek character).

And now its lent..Im I abstaining from anything?..no..do I feel that I should be?  Well no not really, I have a minor amount of religious brainwashed guilt, but not enough to make me actually give anything up.  I dont eat chocolate often, I dont drink often,  I dont really have any very bad habits I could give up, it just seems to me that this year theres nothing that either the world or I would benefit from me abstaining from for a month.

For those people who are giving something up for lent, are all of you doing it for reasons of religion?  If not then why are you doing it?  I am genuinely interested in peoples opinions on this."

The trouble is my sodding computer keeps crashing or freezing...about 10 or 15 times over a 6 or so hour session.  This usually occurs when moving from one area to another.  I have disabled the sound to see if it was sound card related...no effect.  I have updated my graphics driver (g force Nvidia thingy) so its the latest one again no effect. Alas this represents the full limit of my persoanl expertise with computers.  I am contemplating ditching the entire thing and reinstalling windows.  Is there any reason why this might help?

My theory goes that it freezes or reboots the computer when trying to load textures..or somesuch.  If I turn all the  graphics down to the poo settings will that sort it out?

I took the appeal into the Student Union advice centre again yesterday.  Spoke to a very sensible and refreshingly honest woman who went over it with a finetooth comb.  The advisor said its the most complete appeal shes seen in a very long time, she gave me some advice about re-structuring it so that it is inline with what the Student procedures administrator is used to.  She also said that despite how detailed it is the University have a get out of jail free card which they use for almost every appeal and that cannot be questioned.  She says that the term ""Academic judgement"" can be used to counter almost any appeal and as it cannot be questioned they are likely to use it to scupper the appeal.  She has suggested once this is done we should launch a complaint (different from an appeal apparently)  She says this probably wont work either but then at least we havent given up.  

The Advisor scribbled all over the appeal with handy notes etc which was amazingly helpful, and went to great lengths to assure me that the appeal was detailed and accurate but that despite this I am not likely to get anywhere with it because of the ""academic judgement"" card.  She says she doesnt want me to get my hopes up or on the other hand to think that the appeal was flawed or indeed that I shouldnt have put it forward in the first place.  the term ""weighty evidence against the institute of education"" was used on more than one occasion.  Makes me feel better, but I'm not very hopeful about a positive result.

Ho hum..I'm going into the careers advice centre after I have handed in the appeal for a more detailed interview and hopefully gain some kind of direction on what I can do if this does not work.

Well despite it all I'm almost in a good mood, I think its the expectation of a nice bike ride in lovely weather.."

Bloody hell what a good event!  Absolutely brilliant.  The final fight was perfect.  Brilliant monsters proper heroic combat (on the whole) and perfectly statted.  bloody brilliant event..

I am, however, absolutely knackered..its was sooo hot. No sun burn, multitudes more freckles though.  Gosh it is really exhilerating running around in the woods in chain in the swealtering heat, I was utterly buzzed for most of the weekend.  Saturday afternoon was a bit slow for me, but then again I wasn't on any of the linears.  In the end Kabal sent me off with the scouts to keep me out of trouble (::grins:: dead scouty me;o) ) and we had a quick jaunt round the woods looking for bad guys which was fun.  Kabal makes a top general type you know..up for all sorts and very happy for people to play with things.  Also hes eager to get anyone involved if they are bored.

The highlights of the event for me were:

1) The final battle, especially where the band of refs was approaching as the void mist, it was scary as all hell, retreating and fighting and watching chaps vanish infront of you. 

2) The linear on friday which started off the event with a definite bang.  We went into the land of the dead to put Annwen back to sleep (played by Nick M) First encounter, Saggy and Branwyn are chatting with the speaker of the dead (Played by Andy C) who demands a willing sacrifice for free passage in the dead. and then persuades the two silly buggers to accept hospitality by eating and drinking at his table..They had both been told before hand ""whatever you do dont eat or drink in the land of the dead"".  Branwen was 5 secs of death when she was purged.

Everybody had dismiss levels, coz we were in the land of the dead we were un-natural so the dead could dismiss us.  Poor Saggy only had a dismiss of 6 as did one of the lions who came with us, highest dismiss level was 16 I believe.  Anyway so first major encounter..speaker of the dead says ""If you wish free passage in the land of the dead one of your number must willingly sacrifice themselves and remain in this place"" needless to say we werent very keen on that idea.  Lots of taunting from the speaker of the dead.  ""how many countless victims have you sent here? etc""  Top ranting from Andy.  And then when we dithered for too long he harmed branwen to the head and then had his goons stand over her doing retribution.  Needless to say we went funny and attacked.  Big mosh going down and no way to get to Branwen.  So in the end Aisla goes a bit funny, she went in as Branwen's bodyguard and so she actually gave herself up, said she'd take branwens place, but apparently he only wanted calm dead like people coz he harmed me to the head and then carried on fighting. Well at least I tried;o)  Saggy got dismissed in that fight as did the lion lass when she was trying to heal me.  So as Saggy had proposed me as his second I took over the military stuff when Branwen needed advising.  Hulce isnt very happy about that apparently, but I wasnt in command as Branwen was so that means Aisla didnt actually break her word (if he can work to the word of an oath rather than the spirit, so can I ;o) ).

Other big buzz for me was the one on one fight that I had with Scott when he was playing the dead brother of someone who asked us to lay him to rest at the moots.  He roared ""Non shall pass!"" in a really Brian Blessedesque voice, you should have seen us jump.  Anyway he demanded vengence upon the Harts and the right to fight a champion. According to Osh the fight lasted for over 10 minutes. We had no idea it was Scott until they lit a lantern so we could see to fight.  I made the mistake of locking shields with Scott at one point in order to reach his head, and he got me firmly 3 times on the back.  Never lock shields with someone twice your size.  Anyway he died in a very cool way..he staggered and I swept down with the sword and he just crumbled to the floor with a groan.  It was cool:o) By the end of the fight I had 1 hit left on my back (that buggers got some reach and his shield was *huge*) apparently he had 20 global hits..I only figured out that they might be global about half way into the fight after having hacked his left leg about 7 or 8 times. 

3) Pelleas is a right grotbags, he's as bad as l'Ume was.  okay he approaches Aisla on Thursday beaming proudly and holding a ring.""Here you want to borrow my ring? Don't look at me suspiciously I know exactly what it does. It'll allow you to fight longer against foes.""  So he calls over an invoker and stands well back. Then a couple of seconds after the invocation he cautiously approaches me and asks....""so what does it do?"" and now its stuck.  It did exactly what it said on the tin..but I betcha its not as simple as just granting you with 2 extra locational hit values for a week.  ::grins:: Will I ever learn?

4) Singing and playing with the lions.  Marianne (aka robin) has this great scottish song called ""my plaid""  which harmonises really well.

5) Doing stuff with people I dont often get to go out and about with, namely the host, magpie and owl, and Kabal.

Overall the plot was brill, the mist was scary (halelujah for near full moons and mist machines), and the monsters were top.:o)"

Ahh I miss the simple joy of IRC online star trek roleplay, brainless, fun, and the worst arguments you'd get were..""you cant to that with a transporter!"" 

I have a plan.  Each time there is a discussion about a group concept we need a dictator..or a GM so to speak who just makes a decision one way or the other that noone can argue with.  And then we take that idea and play with it.  Maybe I'm not fussy enough but 2 very different ideas can and do enthuse me equally.  As such I dont mind..hmm..maybe drawing the idea from a hat?

The more I do other systems though, the less happy I am with the LT.  The system is really quite shit and the magic unimaginative, the other hideous monstrocity are the staff.  Security are on the whole unhelpful, god have improved lately but still are rushed and not very friendly, and although lots of the NPC's are lovely (Harts chappies, Dunc of the v'Ar variety, Falcon) you do get the impression rightly or wrongly that there are also a fair share of eejits.  At a non LT event our car was blocked in and so security picked it up and carried it so we could go out a get bedding/groceries.  Do security in the LT get paid?

We've got some ideas bouncing about for Greenwood Legends, Andy seems quite enthused which is nice, and Ivan is interested so we'll see.  I think the increase in enthusiasm has to relate to re-watching Robin of Sherwood for the first time in ages.  I never realise house falcon based their look so completely on the sheriffs men.  Its uncanny, right down to the string mail.  Talking of House Falcon I had an immense amount of fun playing with them at the second moot, shame non of them are coming to BtV..

Also realise that I haven't drunk in a long time and that consequently I am somewhat more of a lightweight than I remember, got slightly tiddly (enough to know it)on 3 pints and a glass of wine (yeah yeah mixing my drinks I know..:o) ).  The up side to this is that I have no hang over! I'm going to hang at Martin's for a while and hopefully meet up with Mel and Sarah for lunch.  I'm contemplating going back to bed now, all this typing has tired me out;o).  I'll stay up until 7 so that I can ring Ivan and tell him good morning and then I may return to that lovely comfy sofa.

Martins house is strange, its really quiet, not at all what you expect from London and sitting in the frontroom reminds me of my first boarding school.  I think its a mixture of the floorboards, the smell, and the building across the way which looks just like the kitchens did, red brick and strangely shaped.

Oooh shock..I have just realised that I am in the same room as my ic tent!  Well that hasnt happened for about a year..okay seeing as I have no luggage I am going to lug it across london with me and take it back to oxford.

I think this is particularly the case for us LRPers...some people will assume that they know you when they dont, they'll say ""oh yeah she is like this"", or ""she always does that"" and then when asked to justify will only be able to give ic examples..its strange..Hallelujah for pubmeets and chats after timeout I say.  

Talking of pubs I think I should prolly go and catch the bus if I want to be at the pub for 6."

"event","Well it appears I finally have one of these things.  In a desperate bid to find even more diversion tactics, Roz set me up with one of these things so I need never be short of them again. This coupled with those mad yet strangely useless tests that you get sent all the time should enable me to avoid all necessary or sensible work for the foreseeable future."

"event","1. My idea of socialising involves good people and good conversation. Now with that thumping bass beat and music about as loud as you get in a rock concert (except in that case I&#39;m actually going for the music), that simply ain&#39;t possible.

2. All the dancing I&#39;ve ever seen in clubs has fallen into 3 categories. Awkward bobbing/hand motions, drunken flailing, and grinding/grabbing. Oh and Mambo, so make that 4. None of which are particularly appealing to me.

3. Speaking of grinding and grabbing, as a&nbsp;(dare I say attractive)&nbsp;young woman, I&#39;m particularly wary of possible unwanted attention in clubs. Ladies Night and all the other objectifying practices clubs partake in do nothing to allay that fear.

4. There&#39;s definitely an expectation to dress up and to make yourself attractive (for the men dammit) when you go to a club. Now a fitted dress I can rock, but 4 inch heels will have my feet screaming in agony before I even get there. And no I will NOT fork out $800 just so I can sit or have a table.

5. Speaking of finances, drinks, especially in Singapore, are expensive, dammit. Yet unfortunately necessary to let loose enough to disregard the fact that someone is squeezing past me, that at any time a creepy dude might start groping me, that the strobe lights are disorientating enough to make me lose my balance and sprain an ankle, that I plain dislike the music and its volume.

The only ever time I had fun dancing and flailing to music was on the Town Green during Supernova (that school rock concert). The music was so-so, but there was space to breathe, I was in tank top, shorts and low heeled boots, I was 100% comfortable with the company, and I could flop wherever I wanted in case of exhaustion. Being mildly buzzed was perhaps secondary.

In short, I&#39;ve been to clubs three times. And I still hate them.

And yet against my probably better judgement, I simply feel the need to learn to like them. Fml."

"event","I still don't understand why Dion saw it fit to make me captain of the DECS Coed squad.

To put things into perspective,
1. I started tumbling classes at the end of last year, around September maybe? Only switched to cheerleading around February. And after two sessions sprained my ankle and was absent for 2 months or so.

2. I have never cheered on a coed squad. I don't even know what half the mounts we use are called. I still, in my opinion, kind of suck. My liberties are still iffy and on a coed squad at this level if you can't do a liberty, you fail.

3. I know so few people on this squad. That makes for a lot of getting-to-know-yous. How do you assume leadership if no one knows who you are?

4. The coed squad is level 6 (all-girls is aiming for level 5). Quite frankly I don't know what that means in technical terms. To me level 6 equals ""highest difficulty level"". Ask about legalities and I draw a blank.

5. I still can't tumble more than a round-off. We can thank my ankle for that.

Given, I've directed Rag dance and stunts, I'm pretty committed and don't whine, have competed regionally in diving, managed not to kill anyone (including myself) on my first attempt at a full downs (both left and right), and Dion has faith that I'll master a heel stretch with a double down dismount by March next year, but nevertheless the dynamics of this seem so strange. I don't mind a challenge, but one has to admit that this is odd.

Dion, I hope you made the right choice. You must either have an insane amount of faith or you're completely overestimating me. YOU DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME A CO-CAPTAIN.

(Also let's hope that no one else thinks this completely ridiculous and develops a grudge.)"

"event","I think perhaps the only other time I've felt this shitty was in year 2 sem 1, during the portable seating device project when I'd just recovered from stomach flu (no eating for 3 days and barely any water), and then came down with the regular cold-type flu, and had to work overnight with hot chlorine-emitting PVC. I don't think it was even half as bad though because I didn't go this many days without sleep.

So I've had maybe 3 proper night's rests in the past fortnight and I didn't slept on 2 of the last 3 days and my period is here and giving me cramps and my entire body aches from it. I just feel so cotton stuffed in the head and it sucks because I still have to think about what to do next and my brain's so sluggish that I swear it takes me 5 mins to figure out if I should cut paper or check on my CNC or go sand the model that just came out of the machine. I just want to be engulfed in an embrace and rocked while sleeping (really dead to the world) for an hour or something. I just feel that awful."

"event","""I wish this could be any other way. But I just don't know what else I can do.""
- Everyday is Exactly the Same | Nine Inch Nails

No pretty language today, no time for it. Crit prep awaits, and progress at 9.30pm is 0/150%. Yet the random bouts of emoing are getting more frequent. Just listening to NIN on the way to school today did it, and I spent the rest of the day feeling somewhat shitty, aside from my bus ride with Darren after class. (Seeing him laugh never fails to cheer me up. I &hearts; you Darren.) And even now I can feel the vestiges lingering on, while doom awaits at 2pm tomorrow.

My thesis schedule looks like a nightmare. Constant work, no breaks. I suppose I brought this upon myself, slacking away for 2 months. But really, I just want to live. Constantly being in the studio is not living, not in my books. Sometimes I wonder if I ask too much of life, but after 5 fruitless years diving (okay well some would argue they weren't fruitless), 3 miserable secondary school years and other countless decisions to play it safe, I've come to the conclusion that I can't do that anymore.

Time to live, Shu Ying, time to live. Just that you know, thesis is asking you to put that off for another 2 months. What do you choose?

How do I balance this?"

"event","Haikel is snoring on armchairs and has been for the past 2 hours; Lionel is dead to the world in his chair, collapsed in exhaustion; Michel continues fervently scratching across paper, attempting to solve Physics problems and muttering about equations far beyond my comprehension. I? I'm not really tired, milk tea apparently having given me a caffeine kick, but 4am never was and never will be an optimal time for design conceptualization. And so I sit beside Michel and fail at doing anything productive, not even sleeping. Ho hum.

I wish I had more to say; I wish I could write it better, more poetically. I wish my thoughts were more complex, philosophical; I wish I could communicate them in multiple languages, not necessarily verbal.

Alas, I honestly feel sometimes like I'm becoming duller and dumber every day.

<i>(The definitions of ""dumb"" - to be unable to speak or to be stupid - are kind of similar yet different if you think about them. If you can't say anything of worth, you might as well not be able to speak. Yet you can communicate a coherent, interesting thought in non-verbal ways. Sort of but not quite equivalent. And yes, how is all this interesting or relevant?)</i>

I feel as if the more I grow into a designer, the more detached I become from the world that I know, what's ""regular"" to me. The more I lose of the self that I was once familiar with, a phantom dissipating like smoke the moment you touch it (for as many parts good as bad). But despite my frequent laments, I don't suppose design is fully to blame for this (partially yes). Engrossed, I've just managed to wander off on an unintended path and now I find myself lost though not really knowing where I want to be either.

"event","Dear Mother,

If I'm such a bad daughter just because I don't think it's my job to find you a cheap scarf in your desired colours (because hi, I would actually have to hunt that down), then why don't you go adopt your dear assistant at work that you adore so much. Since she's so pretty and interesting and sweet. Doesn't matter that she doesn't have a mind of her own and listens to and agrees with everything you say. Because apparently I'm not as interesting and I'm not forthcoming enough (because you don't listen anyway and don't seem to care when I'm upset about school and it's frustrating to repeat everything three times alright) and perhaps I'm too intelligent and can actually challenge the things you say.

Besides she's conservative Christian right? So she'll find herself a nice boyfriend and settle down and procreate only after she's married. Not that you really ever had a problem with Chang and I (it can't have been that hard to deduce that we were doing it, you know), but since we've now broken up there's always that chance that I'll swing the other way just because I'm liberal like that and don't believe in God.

I can't claim to be a fantastic daughter - I get absorbed in my own world, I have work to complete, I'm not the nicest person sometimes. But you know, I wonder why. As a teen I always felt as if you favoured Wen, and hello even my coach saw that. Now, you speak to both of us in a tone that suggests that we're 8 and not nearly 18 and 23. You expect me to listen to you when you don't listen to me. When we go out and I'm upset, rather than asking me what's wrong, you scold me for sulking because ""you were supposed to spend time with me, but your face is so black"".

I've had it, you know. I've tried to tell you why your behaviour upsets me, but you turn around and blame me instead. I try. I've tried. I can't keep trying. You expect me to be there for you, but you aren't there for me. You keep talking about all the effort you've invested in this family that is no more, in me. But you don't realise that for a long time you've been incredibly selfish and so many of your actions point to you putting yourself first rather than Wen and I.

I don't feel like it's worth the effort anymore. To what extents do I have to go to get you to reciprocate? When will you hear me when I scream? When was the last time you tried to?"

"event","I usually don't write about these things because they're not normally too interesting, but yesterday Michel, I and Alwyn watched Black Swan. In that seating order.

Sitting between the two boys was hilarious. Halfway through when all the strangeness/disturbed-ness started, Michel took out his jacket and started texting under it. Then that progressed to hiding half his face under it. And by the end, pointedly looking anywhere but at the screen whenever anything freaky happened. Kept hearing pained sounds whenever there was blood on screen too... no prizes for guessing where those came from. XD Alwyn on the other hand was perfectly normal and quiet. That is until the taxi scene where Lily groped Nina's crotch - he was most certainly enjoying that, and then when the scene suddenly changed, HE LITERALLY GASPED. AHAHAHAHA.

Oh boys. &hearts;&hearts;

Once the movie ended, discussion of psychological disorders ensued, me in the middle having no effing clue what they were talking about (this seems to happen frequently). And then it was the disappointing censorship of the sex scene. And my declaration of Lily's appeal. I think my exact words were, &quot;oh my god, she's fucking hot!&quot; *facepalm*

Yah. We are predictable. I don't care.

The rest of the afternoon/evening involved pigging out at Aston's, then ice cream at Ben &amp; Jerry's *recalls the story of Zelig and BJ Day*, and finally beancurd and fried bread supper. I think all in all I ate maybe half of what the boys did though. XD Slacking at B&amp;J's was fun - we were there for over two hours (maybe three), most of which was spent with three of us piled on this two seater couch. Entertaining ourselves with boy talk, Michel's adult truth or dare iPhone app with an astoundingly small question pool, both of them poking and tickling me (WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE TO DO THIS, WHY), Alwyn for some reason deciding that poking most of the dots on the front of my dress and trailing the key of my necklace over them while Michel was dead to the world was a good idea, us deciding that concern over my dress riding up was unnecessary considering how none of us would actually care.

Scandalous.

It was their ear jewelry that caught my attention first - metal, shiny, bright - contrasting her dark hair and dark clothes. She was in ripped black stockings and black patent Doc Martens, skirt - or dress, I couldn't see - with a greyish (?) blazer over. He with his hair tied back, grey skinny jeans, plaid shirt. His shoes I didn't see.

Four girls, sitting on the steps leading to the heart of the Sunset Way shops, on the side closer to the foot reflexologist rather than the bakery. Glass bottles of what probably contained alcoholic beverages not too long ago lay beside them, more bottles in their hands. I hurriedly discarded my green tea bottle in the dustbin nearest to me (and also to them), avoiding eye contact, trying to give them as much privacy as possible in a public space.

A dog trotting past, quickly. Kind of skinny, I wish I could've given it food and taken it home. Male. Looked friendly; maybe it was one of the friendly strays that lives around my neighbourhood. So many stray animals that I want to adopt. But can't.

I'm not ready for this. Too many details, too many situations, too many experiences that I haven't absorbed. Kai keeps saying he wants to absolutely cram his time in university so that by the time he graduates, he'll look forward to it. I kind of did that. But with one thing (or maybe two, but I really don't want to talk about that) - design. The studio. More studio. Just the studio.

Sitting by as Alwyn, Kai and Huiying talk about things I don't know of and don't understand. But most definitely involve house visiting, drinking, and drinking games. Not understanding.

Alwyn telling Kai that Madhu can see Alaric anywhere else besides home because home is too cramped. Kai boarding the bus with his bottle of red wine that somehow they'd been intending to consume in Chatterbox.

I don't really get it. I wish I did.

My life has been a hurricane of mostly design. I regret that.

I want a wealth of experiences. I want to feel as many things as I can. To take the time to breathe in the little details that surround you, yet live hard, fast and furious.

In other news, the introduction of compulsory Residential College accommodation for USP students will spell the decline of the already small USP-design population. Upsets me greatly. Explanation <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=448047007171"">here</a>."

"event","Scanning the offerings of the Hot Topic online store and recognizing the names of a multitude of bands that once upon a time I'd have stumbled upon at least once every few days, if not whose music I'd been intimately acquainted with, recalls the punk/rock/metal roots that I seem to have left behind in a dimly lit corner only visited with the need for solitude. Perhaps not even then. Do I miss them? I find myself unsure. A barely audible voice nags at me to reach for that studded wrist band, but simultaneously my now-fashionista sensibilities protest vehemently with something somewhat akin to horror.

Perhaps for Halloween, which breezed by this time without my slightest participation. I suppose though, there's always next year.


(Lmfao. This sounds so pretentious. And to think Ash wants us to write descriptions for our project like this. Sigh. Although I do believe I'm perfectly capable of it.)"

From the site:

Yay for plant responsiveness. Now to find a breakdown of the components and system...

And to begin testing. :S"

There are incandescent (bad!), flourescent (not as bad), high intensity discharge lamps (toxic shit in it) and LED (always the best!). Except LED ones are freaking purple to cater to the photosynthetic absorption peaks. -.- Anyway Google turned these up.

I found this on <a href=""http://www.weheartit.com"">we &hearts; it</a> and something about it is so true, isn't it? What is madness? A variance from a social mean? Aren't we really all mad, and isn't it just a matter of how and to what degree?

I want to say we should stop labelling and ostracizing because no one is quite normal, whatever normal may be. But at the same time I think I'm secure in my madness. And if that was taken away and we were all thought of as similarly mad, not quite sitting on the average point along the social scale, would that be a part of my identity lost?

Let me be mad, I'll take difference any day over mediocrity. Perhaps it's just the realisation that you don't sit on the mean and don't want to that is the real difference.


(And no, I don't know what the point of this was, and I don't even know if it makes sense.)"

These are probably one of my favourite plant designs yet. They actually look good, and the fact that you design and tessellate these on your wall yourself gives it a kind of interactivity that's lacking in most of these products. My only gripes are that the pockets are probably too small for most plants and that stacking them over another might block the light. <i>Might.</i>

Then again, small plants <i>are</i> cute.

This isn't really so much about the plants as about the whole system of the kitchen. Stuff like the heat from the fridge heats water for the dishwasher and dirty water is recycled and used to water the plants and spices on the wall. But I really don't think I'd want this in my kitchen. Takes up too much space, and what if my plants all die and I don't want them replaced? Have a huge gap in the wall?

As mentioned on Inhabitat I think, a bit TOO minimalist. You don't want to have to leave it against the wall, or have it wet the floor. Also what if it doesn't rain? The grass dies! I'd also ask why I'd want a small random patch of grass on the floor...

Not sure what this is, but definitely conceptual. Something about drawing the parallels between cemeteries and landfills...

Not very practical nor would it really work, huh? As one commenter says,

<i>""I think its a wonderful project.
Its just non-sellable, non-realistic, non-problem solving, non-sustainable, and perhaps.. not a product.""</i>

True.

Plants for the sake of plants don't work. ESPECIALLY not for residences I think. These aren't even pretty and how do you maintain them?

Doesn't work for residences again. Too much artificial lighting required, probably makes a mess and you don't have a cleaning service to be keeping the house spic and span always."

"event","I'm in school now, at 10.50am. Left home late at 9.40 and walked through the drizzle to the bus stop at the back. Only misted the the Fittonia New this morning before I left (I was late!) and was worried that maybe they need a certain watering routine and that my school schedule would disrupt that, but I guess the rain will take care of that. Come to think of it, wild plants deal with the rain whenever it comes, no? Although the weather has been so wonky as of late. Damn global warming.

I get the impression that since the people on <lj comm=""gardening""> mostly have gardens, watering is a chore. And I always thought that when we had that jungle of a balcony. We should collect and channel rainwater to a system that waters our plants on a regular basis. Really."

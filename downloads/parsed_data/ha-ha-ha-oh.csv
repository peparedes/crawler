"event","Ah I'm finally home.
I was only gone for 3 days but it felt like forever.
We got to my Aunts bar, and it was literally in the middle of nowhere, and one of the most disgusting places I've ever been.
My Dad's side of the family are big drinkers so a lot of them were drunk, which explained their goofiness.
After that escapade, we went to my other Aunt's and Uncle's.
It was so boring, and the next day we went to the areas big mall.
It was small and gross. 
And then we went to the Res.
The Reservation, because my dad wanted us to see where a lot of his family lived/grew up.
CASINOS GALORE.
I love how Native American's are stereotyped to be heavy gamblers/drinkers, and my family brings this stereotype to truth.
And then more sitting around and talking, and we came home.
It was such a long car ride, but I kind of liked it.
Since when do I like riding in cars so much?"

I surprisingly enjoyed Grace Read a lot though it was hard to concentrate on anything but the sweltering heat.
I don't think I've ever sweat that much in my entire life.
We were extrememly close to Kevin Devine, and a little bit farther away, but still REALLY close to Jesse Lacey.
They both played a lot of songs and they sounded so great.
I can't remember all of the songs off of the top of my head though.
But I was so happy when he played Untitled 01, Play Crack The Sky, Soco Amaretto Lime, and The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot. 
And a bunch others.
And even though my feet were killing me and I was sweating buckets, it was the best night of my life.

He's taking the rocks in his mouth from the bottom of the fish tank

And he's spitting them out really hard.
He looks angry.

I've been looking for another author to read religiously since Chuck Palahniuk, and found one in Douglas Coupland.
I think he's phenomenal.
I've read JPod, Miss Wyoming, and am halfway through Hey Nostradamus!
The latter being my favorite so far.
It's heartbreaking and you'd think it was all 100% true the way he writes it.
Probably because it's such a realistic issue, school shootings, but you never hear about the peoples personal stories.
I mean sure on the news you hear about it, but not from the person and all their loved ones.
That's what it is, the girl who is shot (just one of dozens?) tells her story, then her boyfriend/husband, then his future girlfriend or some lady, then his father.
I'm not positive, I haven't gotten to the last two yet.
It's so beautiful.
Go buy it now!
Oh God I sound freaky and pathetic, but it's a way to pass time.
Judge me, I couldn't care less.
Also, for my summer reading I have really big list to choose from.
Most of them are about stories of minorities growing up in Southern America 50 years ago.
I wanted to read the auto-biography about Gilda Radner, but it's out of print and I'm too lazy to order a used one.
So I'm going to read Senator John McCain's memoir entitled, Faith Of My Fathers.
It sounds pretty dry, but after that Renaissance shit I had to read last year, this will be a breeze.
Other than that, my life's the same.
Boring as hell, but I'm content with it for today.
Tomorrow's another story.
Have I mentioned I cannot make up my mind lately?
I'm constantly contradicting myself and it's making me insane.

I can't get up before 1PM and I can't fall asleep before 4AM.

Brooke REFUSED to go to sleep.
She tried to run out of her room, but I held the door closed.
And she stood there screaming like I was going to kill her.
This went on for at least 20 minutes.
I felt awful.
She was so upset and scared and I was overwhelmed, so I took it step by step and finally got her to bed.
And I sat there for about a half an hour trying to coax her to sleep.
She fell asleep, but woke up as I was leaving and got all upset.
I lied and told her I was going to use the bathroom, and promised her I wasn't going home.
I lied, I collected my money and ran home.

I hung out with my friends, and it was nice.
It felt good to just talk and gossip.
After they left, I fell asleep until about 5PM.
Then I went to Red Lobster with my family to kill a $100 gift card that my parents got for Christmas and had yet to use.
I had crab legs and I've decided that I am excellent at cracking open the shells perfectly to I get the meat out in large, whole pieces.
Unfortunately, the people at the table next to us kept staring at me and it was making me very uncomfortable.
I don't like people watching me eat, especially strangers.
Isn't it weird when you sleep on your arm wrong and you wake up and it goes numb?
Like, not even tingly, just flat out numb and you can't move it.
That hadn't really happened to me before about a couple of months ago.
And it freaked me out.
I woke up and I couldn't feel my arm and I couldn't move it.
I started to panic.
I was almost sobbing and screaming when I started to get some feeling back into it.
Since, it has been happening frequently, and I kind of like it.
I don't know why, I think it's cool.
Strange is more like it.
I also can't wait to redo my room.
Not so much ""redo"" it, as get wood floors, or those plastic sticker things, and a new dresser, and a bookshelf. 
Within the past year or so, I have accumulated so many books and CD's and I know my collection will keep continuously growing, so I NEED a bookshelf.

There's really nothing to say, I haven't been doing anything.
There's been a lot of sleeping until about 1 or 2 in the afternoon.
And a lot of reading.
A lot of physical therapy.
A lot of listening to Brand New.
Basically just Jesse Lacey.
Not enough talking, but that's my fault.
I've taken the chance to isolate myself completely from my parental units.
And it's been nice because frankly, I've been getting sick of them.
And hopefully I'm getting my permit soon, only almost 7 months too late.
But that's okay I guess.
I've just taken these last 2 weeks(? Not even, it feels like a month) to think about nothing and about everything.
And I'm finally almost ready to unite with civilization once again.
And act like a normal kid.

I love it when it rains like this, like really pours.
It's really refreshing.
Except what I don't love is when we lose power.
Which we did last night, and it sucked.
I really want to go to the movies soon.
I want to see I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry, just because it looks like the stupid, mindless entertainment I need.
And I am counting the days until the Jesse Lacey/Kevin Devine show.
I can't wait, but no matter what anyone says I'm nervous about it.
We bought the tickets through the actual venue, instead of ticketmaster because they weren't on sale on ticketmaster yet, so when we pick them up, I'm scared we won't get them because we bought them through Nicole's mom's credit card.
And I know, it's stupid to worry that we won't get them because we don't have enough proof, I still am.
I'm going to be worried, despite what anyone says, until I have my ticket in my hand.
Besides, if I don't worry, who else will?
Anyway, I'm also really excited for seeing everyone this weekend.
I mean, we haven't all been together since the campout on June 21st, which is like, forever ago.
And we're going to Townley Hall, so that's always fun.
Haha, like last time, when I pissed off Nicole SO BAD.
I thought she was going to strangle me.
I can't wait.
Other than that nothing is going on.
I've been watering the 8 billion plants for my neighbor while she's away in an attempt to earn some extra money.
And since the past 2 days of rain, I haven't had to do that, which is great because she has so many plants.
I guess I'm gonna go watch TV, and probably listen to my mother rant on why I do nothing around the house to help."

So yesterday was supposed to be my day to hang out and watch TV,
I do that every day but here's the catch.
My parents were supposed to be gone ALL DAY until like midnight.
But instead we got in the car at noon and drove.
I thought we were just going to Cortland because that's where my grandfather lives,
But he was transferred to Syracuse.
Gah.
It was like 4 hours in the car, but luckily since my father had work the night before, he slept in the BACKSEAT, so I had the front for 3 hours.
And then we switched.
But anyway, we got to the hospital and all these relatives were supposed to be there and my dad was so excited about seeing them, but when we were about a half hour away they decided they wanted to go up to Canton for the day.
And my Dad was so mad for the WHOLE day about that.
But whatever.
And well, we got there and my grandfather looked really good.
And seemed really happy.
It was scary, I was so used to seeing him all serious and angry, but he was joking around and stuff.
According to my great aunt ""he was the way a grandfather should be""
It wasn't soo bad.
But, oh my gosh, I have never met a man so
well
stupid.
I mean he had a HEART ATTACK.
And he goes, ""do you think it's my diet?""
DUH!
And my dad told me he likes to eat granny smith apples.
With SALT on it.
Can you say ew?
With the way he eats, I'm surprised he's still ALIVE.
It was so funny to see how surprised he was when he found out he couldn't eat salt.
What do you expect from a man who dropped out of school in the seventh grade?
But anyway, we didn't leave the hospital until 9PM and then we went to my Aunt Lana's house.
It's in Cortland right by my grandpa's house, and we stayed there until about midnight.
And we stopped on the way home because my mom needed a break from driving.
So all in all, we got home at 3:30 AM.
And I smell so bad, I need to shower."

A few weekends ago I went to visit my aunts mother. (no relation to me, but she's a close friend because my aunt and my mother have been great friends since my mom's brother has been with her, like forever ago)
Anyway, she's like 94.
Old.
She's so old, her eyes have kind of glazed over and she looks so small and shriveled in her little wheel chair.
Her name's Jesse.
She's probably the only oldie in the crazy house that hasn't completely lost her mind.
I mean it.
Take her roomate,Mary, for instance.
You've never seen a woman so deformed.
I mean, she looked like if she stood up straight she could be about 5'8?
She was hunched over so much, her back had this giant hump in it, and her whole body was so shriveled with age, it was disgusting.
I feel awful for saying these things but...
And then there was this other man, he rolled up and down the halls singing the 'Our Father'.
These people, our elders.
They scare the fucking shit out of me.
I never, ever want to get old.
Ever.
I have a newfound phobia of getting old.
And I will never send my mother or father to one of these places.
It's cruel.
Maybe now they piss me the fuck off, but they're my parents for God's sake.
I can't even begin to describe the others there.
They were dying.
You've never seen something so sad in your life.
Thinking about it makes me want to cry.

Which, by the way, I can't do.
I can't cry.
No matter what I watch, what I think about, what happens.
Nothing comes out.
I'm like a robot inside.
Hah.

I'm so miserable and cynical sometimes.
What made me like this?
I have a lot of good things in my life.
I have good friends, and for the most part a decent family. 
(Despite the fact that sometimes I want to rip out their throats)
I get these fits of emotions from time to time.
Like one minute I'll be happy, and then something will happen and I'll snap.
I'll go crazy and start yelling and get so mad that I could just kill somebody.
And then 5 seconds later I'll be like, happy again.
What the fuck?
Or, one minute I'll be really happy and content, and then I'll think about something and get so overwhelmed and anxious and nervous it's scary.
I also think I have social anxiety.
When I get put in social situations I get overwhelmed and nervous and I don't talk.
It's not that I don't want to, it's that nothing comes out.
And when something does come out, it's something weird and random and people get these confused looks like, ""Where did that come from?""
I scare myself.
And then sometimes I say things and I can't control myself.
It's like, when I meet new people, that's not me.
It's someone else.
The real me is waiting to come out in 4-6 weeks of knowing you.
It takes me that long to warm up to people.
Mostly because I think they're just talking to me because they feel sorry for me.
Or because, you know, there's nobody else around.
Or nobody better, anyway.
I just have low self-esteem, that's all.
That's why I have like 6 friends.
Also, another reason might be because I lost touch with all my old friends.
Maybe because I'm a bitch who thinks she's better than everyone else?
Yeah, I admit it.
I'm a snob, and that's probably why I hate like 90% people.
I just don't like people in general.
I think they're bad.

But some are good.
Some.
And that helps make it worth it.
I'm looking for some more good ones.
Hopefully ones not like me, because if they're like me, they won't give me a chance.

I love ranting.
That felt good."

My pool is disgusting.
We have to put a million different chemicals in it.
Which sucks.
I hate this weather.
I like it when it's chilly out.

Today I went to Borders and bought Slaughter-House Five.
I haven't started it because I've been reading The Catcher In The Rye.
And it's really good.
I normally don't really like classics, but this book is wonderful.

I lost my Brand New CD and The Red Badge Of Courage.
Which belongs to Mrs. Donnell.
And she hates me already so now she's going to hate me 1oX more.
I'm sure it's around here somewhere.
I just have to look harder.
But it still sucks.
God I hate her.

I just want all my tests to be over.
I'm sick of school.
I want it to be next year.
This year sucked so bad, academically.
I did awful and my parents are on my back every two seconds.
It's getting real old, real fast.
I just want more freedom.
I just want to have my license. 
I just want to have my own car, and money.
I just want them to let me be.

But I don't want to grow up.
That could be a problem.


Edit: Why do I get so mad when people like the same bands as me?
      I guess it's cause it's people I don't respect."

Today was incredibly boring.
I felt like I really didn't see my friends.
Like, it was weird.
Hopefully we'll hang out this weekend.
Only 3 more days this weeeek!
School's almost out.
So thankful for that.
Except I'm slacking really bad, and I'm on the verge of failing like all my classes.
Except I'm not.
But I don't know.
I think I'm just really stressed out.
About everything.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
For sure.
I honestly feel like I'm going insane.
I wonder if this is what crazy feels like.
It's not good."

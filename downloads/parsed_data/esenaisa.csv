Well, Friday I left to go to New york and go to East Orange (about 20 mins from NYC)at The Ramada ( which fukcing sucked ass becasue for 2 nights there was no hot water so yesterday we decided to look for another hotel with HOT WATER. 
Saturday: Went to New York City, we did lots of walking. We went on Broadway ( I almost went to see RENT!, but we ""didn't"" have time.), Walked all the way down to Time Square and Its soo fucking amazing and beautiful. Shiit ill continue my post later !

"event","So yeah!
I've been extremly lazy to update my LJ. So I'm going to try and sum everything which is going to be impossible!
 
All summer has been like half a blur and half we FUN. Had so many parties, well went to so many parties. Right now I'm pretty ""pas dans mes etats"" and Robyn is passed out on my couch. Ava is still crazy and I'm just plain MEH. 
Lately I've been hanging out with Robyn and Ava is here until the 23rd. And then she's off to Winnipeg :( This is going to suck so badly. I miss the old days when Ava used to llive in Ay town. We were always together. And I miss that a lot. I miss having someone always there for me. These days I just think that everyone doesn't give a  shit anymore that they don't do any effert into our ""friendship"". I know I'm one of those people, like for example one of my friends and I barely speak because we got into a really bad fight and lasted pretty long like about 2 months, and we forgave each other so yeah.. but now it's somewhat fake and we pretend a lot of liking and stuff. But I just complain all the time so I'll shut up now. 
I'm so sick of working, but I need to money for my trip to Spain. Like I don't wanna quit, but I want something new abd I don't wanna quit my job at the gym because I have a free membership and get paid minimum wage. SO I tihnk I should stop complaining, but I want to and it makes me feel better. Man I hate everything riight now! I wanna say so much but the words aren't coming out and I'm fucking stoned and I don't know wwhat else to say!

PEaace out homies!
OHHHHHHHHHH!!! and 
P.S I was too late and now i regret. I wish I could kiss his tender lips ! I'm such an idiot!"

I lost 15 $  to Jeremy from work, I bet on the FIFA cup game Italy VS France, and I was rooting for France and they lost! *bummer* Robyn I just wanted to say sorry for saturday night, when you called I was drunk, a bit but no one believes me that I was just a bit drunk. and you probably wanted to talk but yeah IM REALLY SORRY!

So nothing really new: I'm still grounded don't know untill when but I'm dealing with it and deserve every bit of it. My mom found out I lost my wallet but I dont know how someone told her and she obviously won't tell me who but whatever. Friday, worked. Saw John. But fuck John not worth waisting my time anymore. Don't know why I started hanging out with him. Saturday worked, sunday closed with Robyn (her last shift:)  ) and monday worked so that's enough money so I can buy a new Ipod. I went to La source to order a new ipod nano 2GB the guy told me to come back tomorrow. I went back today after school and he told me he has bad news and the he couldnt order the ipod from the store somewhere else in Canada, so I was pretty pissed. He told me to go check at Zellers and Walt-mart! I'm so fucking screwed. So I guess I'll buy my shoes first. Have to go to rideau and I dont know how Im gonna manage to go there since im grounded. So yeah, John Marie told me that this girl was all over him at the party I was supposed to go to on Friday night but couldn't so I said fuck him not working it anymore. I wasnt attached or anything, but it would have been nice to just enjoy his company like I dont know there.. Wtv So yeah, I dont wanna hear of him anymore which is going to be hard because he doesn't know that, and I don't wanna call him to tell him because it would be pretty stupid.
Anyways I'm done for now..

I was totally drunk out of my mind took us like an hour and a half to get to my friends house who it usually takes us 20-30 mins! So yeah, I went for a walk with this random, was gone for like 20 mins I get back cause Chris got there and I come to realise some fucking idiot stole my bag. I got at least 400-500$ worth of stuff stolen. My ipod nano, new adidas shoes and some money, important cards! I realy furious. One of my friend's friend almost got the shit beat of him because they found out he was a racist and wanted to kick leaving shit outta him. But he got away. Then on the way walking back( im still fucking drunk), i was walking with my friends and started walking with Chris, then these guys stop in a car looking for the guy who's racist. Rock, the guy driving the car, thos a U-turn and if it weren't for Sophie and Chris pulling me back I would have got hitten by a the car. Which scared the living shit out of me. So we finally get to Marie's we talk for like 5 mins and all I want to do is sleep cause I feel fucking sick. So, I decide to go on msn and chat but can't write properly so I get off. Then the sickness comes! ( I know you didnt need to know that) So then i go to bed after and fall asleep like a rock. Wake up this morning so fucking nausious. I was totally sick! And everyone woke up so we talked for like 2 hours and now they're making breakfast lol cause I'm wayy to lazy to cook right. and damn you! I have to work later 4:30-7:30.!
Anyways,
Peace out, bitches!

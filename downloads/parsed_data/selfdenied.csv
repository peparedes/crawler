there is movie music in the background. it is making me sad i imagine...haven't been in a while. an interesting feeling..but i dont think it is how i am right now...my whole body feels this feeling. it is slow. it is a kind of saddness..but not sad all at the same time. it is tired. it is mellow. it is crying. it is screaming. for no reason at all. it is me but it's also you. someday it will consume us all. i don't think anybody will know what to do. nobody knows what to do now...we are all oblivious. oblivious to our own games..our own mindfucks. someone will figure it all out.figure out the solution to everything.the meaning to everything.but until then

"event","the end
	you ask why
		but the question really is
			where did it begin

you'll never know
	how, when
		because you were too caught up
			in what was going on

you forgot

forgot about the past
	about when you were happy

forgot how it used to be
	how you used to be...

forgot where it all began
	too concerned that it was ending

forgot how to smile
	didn't want to be happy

forgot how to laugh
	you wanted the attention

forgot how to love 
	prefered hate

forgot how to be you
	liked the fakeness

forgot how to accept things
	for the way they are

people
        for who they are

let it go

run away
	run fast
		and run far

don't come back

just go
	at least for now

please...
	i'm begging you

leave
	before i do...
		

i dont want to go
	back to the start
		ever
			at least....

"event","i want to jump on a trampoline until i throw up in the middle of a field... minus throwing up. i want to go to mcdonalds and eat lots of gross and greasy food without getting fat or having a heart attack. i want to go dance around in the rain..in my underwear. i want to read a book...right now..a whole damn book. i want to find my journal so some creepo teacher isn't sitting there reading it...right now.

there is a lot of things that people want...do they ever get them. well there are the people that do and the people that don't...I usually don't. maybe everyone should just stop wanting things and thn really who whould even care about anything...because if you didn't want anything..and i mean anything..nothing would even matter..

not that anything does matter anyway. i mean you live and then you die so why not fuck shit up and have fun while you can. Because just think -> soon you will be a pile or decaying flesh and well face it...decaying flesh isn't that fun. so go drive absolutely nowhere and have some smokes and get a one arm sunburn and everything will be good.....right?

who's with me?"

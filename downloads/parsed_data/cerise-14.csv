Hey Beacher, 
> 
>Sorry I didn't write sooner. I have been kind of anti-social and 
>just fucking pissed off. (Not at you of course don't worry hahaha.) 
>I'm glad you slowed down to think about the situation with ****. Are 
>you still thinking about him? I find it possible for you to fall in 
>love with him at 15 even though he lives across the country. Not the 
>kind of conventional love, but love for saving your life and being 
>there. I don't think you were being that stupid either. As long as 
>you acknowledge that you will probobly never meet him (sorry for 
>being a pessimist) then I don't think your being that dumb. When 
>your stressed the littlest emotion can seem like a huge thing. I 
>know. Anyway, what's new in Vancover? Excited about spring break? 
>Duncan has been hell. I did somthing I really shouldn't have last 
>night and now I am going insane with heart break. I found out the 
>password to my Mom's e-mail (she had it written down RIGHT in front 
>of me) and I went on her e-mail when she wasn't home. (She was out 
>meeting Barry. She said she was going to Canadian tire. Right it's 
>really fucking open at 9:00! It even said in the e-mail.) The things 
>that I read, god, I will just never forget. I'll tell you a bit, but 
>alot is way too painful to write. I had a nervous breakdown last 
>night and I think I passed out becuase I woke up wierdly sprawled 
>out on my bed and I don't remember going to sleep. Anyway, she wrote 
>about last spring break when we went to Sea Side Oregon. It was 
>honestly the best srping break ever, just the two of us on a road

>where my Mom is going this spring break. Sea Side Oregon. Without

>with me last time all she could think about was him. God beach, I 
>fucking lost it. The best time of my life was spent there and she 
>was thinking about him. Has everything we have done and said to 
>eachother been a lie? She loves him 10 million times more than me 
>and I will never been able to fill that space in her life. Does she

"event","Well, not much has been happening in Drunken Duncan lately. Frankie Jared and I couldn't get into the movie becuase we didn't have ID so we just wandered around Duncan instead and just told everyone we went to see Starsky and Hutch. It was actually really fun though. We found a shopping cart and went for rides in it, talked to a crazy lady, went to the school and got some coffee at Java World. I also discovered that Frankie is so cool! I thought he was all stuck up but he's really easy to talk to and extremley nice. We had these long talks about family, money, religion, drugs.... Jared lives such a sheltered life compared to us though. Like a cop drove by and he started fraking out. We weren't even doing anything illegal. He pisses me off so much sometimes, but then other times it's just like... ahhh... I don't know how to explain it. <br><br>I feel so bad for Andrea right now. She REALLY likes Tibb, but he lives across the country and she has never met him before. I mean I had an interent realationship with Jeff, but he went to the same school. I fell in love with him and I am afraid that is what she is doing. It took me a year to get over him and I really don't want her to have to go through that. She has enough going on as it is. <br><br>On another note.. mom is almost positive that she is going away for spring break. Yay! I really just can't stand her right now and I know that the trip is with Baryee. She must think I am some kind of fucking idiot. No Mom, your not having an affair AGAIN when you are up at 3:00 in the morning on MSN and don't provide me with any explanation. FUCK! I think I'm going to do some pot with Frankie on Spring Break. YAY! I haven't gotten high for a long time. EVERYONE... it has been 2 months since I have had narcotics. I am so freaking proud. I have become an alcoholic in the time being, which is almost more destructive, but I am going through my own personal hell right now. I'm getting smashed with Danielle and Cassie tomorow. Sometimes I wonder if that is the only reason I am friends with them. Just to get the alcohol and shit. Hopefully not. I really like Kim though, she is awsomely nice. <br><br>Oh by the way... I figured out why Geordie was grounded. Him and some of his hard core stoner friends decided to make chocholate fondue with mushrooms (the drug) in it. Geordie ate way too much becuase it tasted so good and had to go to the hospital. It took 5 police men and one of his friend's Dad's to hold him down and he bit off a piece of cement with his teeth he was so fucked up. That's just fucking stupid. I DID drugs and ODed once, but nothing like that shit. What a stupid fuck. He is making me quite mad lately. <br><br> I just got back from watching the movie ""Thirteen"" for the second time. What a good movie. My life at thirteen wasn't quite that bad but I can relate to the girl in it in alot of ways. I hate wallowing in self pitty like this though. I have so much homework to do and I just don't care enough to do it. Fuck school. FUCK IT ALL! Sometimes I just hate the world. Wow what a great note to end on. Anyway, I will write when I am a little more happy. Probobly tomorow becuase I will be pissed out of my mind and numb to everything. I can't beleive the shit mom dosen't know about me. If she did she would have a heart attack. Well, farewell."

"event","<P><FONT size=4>I really don't know how to feel right now</FONT>. Why do relationships have to be so complicated? If someone finds out, please tell me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jared came over yesterday from 10:00am to 11:00pm and it was honestly one of the best days of my life. We watched old, low budget horror movies and comedy shows and made Kraft dinner/spaghetti. The way I felt when he put his arms around me and I lay on him was indescribable. I know in my last post all I talked about was Geordie, but I think that that is only a physical attraction. He plays mind games with you and I am afraid that he is judging everything I do. He also has a bong buisness, I just don't know what to say to that. I feel so much more comfortable around Jared. Yesterday I just laid on him and watched jepoardy. However, what if my attraction to Jared is only intellectual? I don't think it is, but who can be sure. All I know, is what I don't know and I am so confused. Can I really be falling in love with him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another topic on my mind is my cheating Mom. Should I say somthing to her? Should it be mean? Should I just give up and move on? I just hate her so much for being so selfish and making everyone else suffer for her to achieve love. I want her to be happy, but not if it means keeping secrets and lying to other people. It tears my heart out everyday and I can barely look her in the eye. I guess for now I will just listen to sad music and try to force myself to get an appetite and look a little happier. I am never going to act fake though, and if I do, someone shoot me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some other sad news, Honey died. She was really ill and wasn't happy but that dosen't make it any easier. She was a really great lady&nbsp;and what makes me feel really special is that her last words to me were that I was beautiful. It was one of the sweetest things ever and I will never forget her. I feel so bad for Ed though. He will get comfort from knowing she is happier, wherever she is now, but this happened so soon after Beau's death. Well, maybe just to me, but thinking of him still makes me cry and I only met him a few times. Come to think of it, he was kind of my first date. Ok, I really need to stop thinking about this because I am allready crying. Suicide astounds me, although I have been close a few times. I find it really selfish, yet I find it even more selfish for the people around you to expect you to live in a world of hell. I even forgot about the twins, I wonder how they have been doing with this. Death is such a sad thing, yet knowing someone you love is in a better place than this hell of a world brings happiness, or to me anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Well, not many other thoughts. I am going to see ""The Passion"" tonight with Frankie and Jared. I hope it is good. Sometimes I think I am religious and other times I find I really am not. I wonder if there really even is a god, although I wear a cross and ask for his help all the time. I guess I will either start to have faith or find out when I die. Well, So long, I shall write again soon.<BR></P>"

"event","<FONT size=2><FONT size=3>Yay&nbsp;I'm excited.</FONT>&nbsp;This is my first journal entry. It's not like anyone will notice or care that I spent 2 hours figuring out what colours to use on it, but when you are bored, you are really bored. Quite alot actually happened today, where to begin. I really like Geordie again. I don't want to sound like a giddy, 10 year old girl, but damn is he sexy. (No I am not 10 either) We got into a big conversation about music today in art with Frankie and Kim, and we all like the same music! Geordie even borowed my Blood Sugar Sex Magik CD. It's only my favorite in the world. I was happy. I also figured out some good news for spring break. <STRONG><U>IT IS GOING TO ROCK!</U>&nbsp; </STRONG>Mom is going away for 3 days next weekend and she is leaving me home alone. YAHOO. She is probobly going with Baryee (her partner in her evil, and her stupid mother fucking affair) but I don't care becuase that just means I can party even harder and not feel guilty. Hello days and nights of drunken highness. Good to see you again, it's been at least 2 days since I saw you last. Ah my poor brain cells and liver.&nbsp;I also discovered that she is going to be down in Sidney for St. Patties day so Danielle and I came up with even better ideas for a party then too. Hey, I can't feel guilty about that either, it's my salute to the Irish. We are dedicating the party to Rob beacuse he is moving. I know how hard moving is and I feel really bad that he has to go through all of that shit. He is allready depressed, he really dosen't need that. Poor guy, he is so nice too. Oh big news: Krystle broke up with Jared today. Yes, I know I thought I was falling in love with him, but lately I just don't know. I felt really bad so I comforted him and stuff, I think I actually made the situation better for once. It's a god damn miracle. I think Brent also likes me becuase he has been acting quite strange lately, and a whole bunch of people have been telling me. Frank also likes me. Haha so many boys so little time. Oh god I am pathetic, I am just kidding by the way. They probobly both don't like me. who would liek me anyway, I have serious commitment issues. Maybe it is becuase EVERYONE I have ever loved has left me or betrayed my trust in a huge astronomical way, but thats for my shrink to figure out. Well not much else happened today. We have to do our dance tomorow infront of everyone though. AHH. Panic Attack. Anyway, I'll write tomorow. Bye NEW Journal.</FONT>"

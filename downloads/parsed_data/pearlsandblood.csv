I walk in the room and the straight girls all cream. I'm better in bed than you, and they can tell. I don't need a dick to do what I do, but I have several and no, they don't get soft. I'll fuck your girlfriend and look damn good doing it in a skirt and combat boots.

I can paint like rembrandt and I like video games. I'm academically and intellectually gifted, and I'm not a dick about it. Your girlfriend admires that about me, too.

I have an eye for style and I'm a cunning linguist. I'm like George Washington, baby. I'll kick you apart. I have the biggest dick in the room at any moment, just as a given. My piss tastes like mountain dew and I own a pet leopard. I'm responsible for the low birth rate in Japan, because I turned all the ladies gay. I menstruated in your Wheaties.
I have a collection of knives and guns in various styles and colors. I'm trained in martial arts and my heart flutters at the sight of blood. I am a crazy motherfucker.

I can do anything you can, and if I can't, I can learn. I am a Goddess among men. Fucking deal with that.

In summary: any cool girls want to be friends with me? =/"

"event","Last night I was playing the trail version of the Conan the Barbarian MMORPG. Me and Lilith have been rolling characters for the Conan tabletop RPG, so this was part of our research. omg I am a geek.
The whole Conan universe is basically a straight teenage boy masturbatory fantasy. Everything is pretty racist ans sexist and violent and ridiculous. I don't really know if that's going to make the gameplay really funny and enjoyable, or just annoying and gross.
But in any case, the MMO was surprisingly cool. You can make female characters really butch if you want. I made a huge buff butch barbarian woman with a mohawk. The models look friggin' hot, and a female NPC flirts with you like right away. It's funny how you can flip the whole macho guy fantasy into a... well, macho girl fantasy. Go figure. It's still all really gratuitous and over the top, but the models and environments are really lush and beautiful and well, I like blood.

But you know what? In a way, the gratuitous sexuality in Conan is actually less offensive to me than the boobage in say, World of Warcraft. Warcraft is a cartoony world. Things look cartoony. I always thought the extreme cleavage on the female characters and the way their jugs slosh around when they run was really unsettling and out of place.
Whereas in Conan, it sort of fits. <i>Everything</i> looks shiny and sexy and fantastical in Conan, and they have no pretenses about the adult themes in the Conan universe. It's as if because they're upfront and honest about the sex and violence and nudity, they actually managed to do it in a more mature and respectful way. You know what you're getting. Whereas in WoW, they just sort of went ""DURRR BOOBS LOL BOOBS."" The sexuality is not presumed, it's like they force it upon the female characters obnoxiously. I mean, I guess WoW does have that sort of rude cheeky teenage boy aspect, like with the /silly things they say. Maybe it's just a difference in maturity level between the two games.

In addition to the characters and environment in Conan, the combat system is really original and enjoyable, too."

"event","I will be glad when the semester is over. Man, screw school. Ok not really, but still. I go back and forth between thinking ""Wow this is neat I'm learning so much,"" and ""What the hell do they expect of me? I try so hard and all I get is crap in return.""
I imagine most of it is just due to the exhaustion of moving to a new city, trying to change my lifestyle, and dealing with the emotional baggage of my crazy family.

Actually the reason I haven't written here much lately is because my family is still the main thing I want to write about and people just kept saying ""yeah go get therapy."" Well, I'm in therapy now. It's ok =|
I've deducted my dad was emotionally abusive. My mom was pretty crappy too. I just keep running down this laundry list of stuff I lived through that wasn't healthy for my psyche. Social isolation, my parents' radical lifestyle, their mindfuck drama with themselves and each other, the constant fighting between me and my siblings... yeah, it goes on and on. Yet here I am. What am I supposed to make of that? What sort of person does that make me?

Sometimes I wonder if I was better off before I started examining all this. Ignorance is bliss. But then again, maybe my self esteem would be more intact, but I'd be doomed to regurgitate all the antisocial behavior my parents used on me. Maybe I'd walk around like a living dramafest, spewing anger and manipulation wherever I went.
But then again, my self esteem is pretty bad now. It's hard to confront the possibility that I treat people badly, just like my parents. Maybe I'm arrogant, manipulative, jealous, immature...
I want to grow beyond these traits. But how do I do that while keeping my self esteem intact? Or should I just throw it all out and say ""I'm not my parents. I'm not bad like they were. I should leave myself alone""?

Earlier today I was thinking about the concept of performance. I was always pressured to perform, by my parents. I had to prove the home schooling worked. And I still have that attitude toward myself, now. Now that I'm away from the angst of my family, I need to be happy and social and capable and perfect and prove to myself that without my family, I'm a good person.
But maybe that's just my parents' voice in my head, still. Maybe I should lighten up on myself and just try to be chill.
But then what if I actually am manipulative and petty and crap, like my parents? I risk diving into denial, like they did.
Though I guess if I drive myself crazy in the process of bettering myself, I'm not exactly attaining some goal of perfection either.

I know, it's all serious life crap. And probably not terribly interesting to read. Or maybe it's just sort of awkward. What can you really say in response to someone else's psychological crap?
But on the other hand, it feels like soul searching. Soul searching is good.

So let's see, what sort of happy stuff can I write about? I've been listening to music like crazy recently, thanks to the mp3 player my mom got me for my birthday last year. &hearts; (she's not all bad! She really does care)
Right now I'm really into Joan Jett. I saw an ad for the new movie coming out with Kristen Stewart and it reminded me that there is a ton of music out there that is part of rock history, which I've never really even heard.
Joan Jett falls under that category, as well as Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. I've heard maybe one or two songs of each, but I probably couldn't have identified them if you'd asked me, before now. I'm having a lot of fun with it, because it's actually a really important part of my culture.

In addition to that, I continue to &hearts; the hell out of Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the Cure. I really, really do like oldschool goth stuff. It got me remembering earlier how I used to play <a href=""http://otakuworld.com/index.html?/kiss/viewers.htm"">FKiSS</a> and play with dolls by <a href=""http://members.fortunecity.com/glyndon/dolls.htm"">Glyndon</a> and <a href=""http://embyquinn.tripod.com/locmain.html"">Emby Quinn</a>. That was like... one of the earlier exposures I had to alternative sexualities. Back then me and my sister still used to get all ""eww"" and act grossed out by that sort of thing, when secretly I think we were both total gayfaces. For some reason we always kept up this pretense of rigid anti-sexuality.

A while back me and Lilith got in a sort of argument about what makes someone a poseur. She was saying that you can't really be a member of a subculture unless you actively socialize with other members of said subculture in real life.
While I understand that, it's hard for me to accept. I've been pretty socially alienated most of my life, so by her definition, I didn't really have the option of belonging to a subculture. But that being said, I used every tool at my disposal to pursue my interests and give myself some sense of identity. If I look at the interests and activities I've pursued throughout my life, I'd say it fits the ""goth"" label pretty well. I always dressed like a hippy because that's what my parents were, but my natural inclinations lead me towards things like Edward Gorey, Tim Burton, Anne Rice, etc.
Lilith said that sounds like a superficial connection, and maybe it was. But like... that's all I <i>had.</i> I didn't have any goth friends because I didn't have many friends, outside of the internet. And it's not like I could pick up and go to a goth club, cause I was 14.

Anyway, maybe this is just a roundabout way of saying ""nuh uh, I am <i>too</i> goth!"" Which is immature and superficial anyway, haha. I suck at identity.
Maybe I should just say fuck it and do whatever the hell I want, and stop caring what people call me one way or the other.

In that vein, I think I want a sort of soft mohawk hairstyle.
Like so (yes it's Rhianna. shutup):
<img src=""http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/7717/rihannadebutsnewclosesh.jpg"" title="""" >

Maybe trying so badly to fit in is just turning people off. I've always been weird, maybe I should just embrace it.

Now if I can just find someone to cut my hair..."

"event","I'm so tired of trying to be nice to people. I'm tired of being a nice girl. I'm a much more impatient and self-centered person than I make myself out to be.
I'm trapped in this cycle of feeling like I can't express myself, so to attract people I have to rely on courtesy and politeness. People appreciate that, but it makes me feel crappy to keep myself bottled up all the time. But I can't just stop with the Ms. Manners business, because then I'd really have nothing to say and everyone would be like ""what the fuck is her deal?""

Also it doesn't help that I'm fucking spacey as hell these days. Every other word out of my mouth is ""...what?"" I worry people will think I'm an airhead or an idiot or something. It's just fucking hard to follow things, sometimes, when I don't know where anything is, or who anyone is, or when anything is. And man, I got shit on my mind, ok? I'm troubled. So, sorry if I seem like a space-cadet, but you're just gonna have to deal.

I'm in this really awkward stage right now. I have one foot in conformity, one foot in queerBDSMpiercingsindustrialwicca land, and my head in the past.

I want to be myself without apology. Honestly, I'm fucking tired of feeling like I have to apologize for myself. If my silence makes you uncomfortable, like I said, I GOT SHIT ON MY MIND. I'm not saying I don't want to be around people, because I do. It cheers me up. But every time an ""awkward silence"" arises and I start feeling pressured to explain or apologize or something, it's just fucking tedious. I'm sorry I'm not perky and entertaining. I'm sorry I don't know any of the bands you like, or clubs you go to. I'm sorry I don't know so-and-so. But if you want to go dancing or laugh at a bad movie together, I'm your man.

Another thing, I have no fucking power of decision making right now. I just don't care, man. Seriously. Fun things are good, bad things are bad.

APATHY. I'm an apathetic person right now. I hope you understand, it's not personal. I just want to drift along, amusing myself as I see fit, and not thinking too much.
It's true that I've been pushing myself extremely hard to ""get"" Philly. I'm really concerned about fitting in here, and I should probably just fucking stop. Trying to force yourself to fit a mold is never good, especially because the type of people I want to hang out with are not the type who would even like it if I tried to force myself into a mold.

I've just been pushing myself way too hard. Friends, hobbies, music... these are the things that are supposed to distract you from pressure and anxiety. Not cause it.

But when I think ""I need to be myself,"" my mind always goes first to thoughts of changing my outward appearance. But that's not really the issue, is it? You have to be yourself from the inside.
Which also means I can be myself regardless of how I look. Which is good.  Maybe I think about my appearance so much because I feel like no matter how I look, no one really sees <i>me.</i> But if I'm not really being myself, they won't see me regardless of how I look on the outside.

WHY IS IT SO FUCKING LATE? Fuck you, college. Fuck my fucking history class and its bullshit impersonal factory mannerism. Fuck it for taking an interesting subject and reducing it to mind-numbing memorization and mechanical essays. My brain rebels against the concept. Of course they all assume you've taken highschool history, also. Right.

I feel like I've been brainwashed by my dad's girlfriend to be some sort of happy chipper pixie. THAT AIN'T ME, mm'kay? I'm so tired of trying to be nice all the time. So tired. Sometimes people aren't all smiles and rainbows. It happens.

Not that I want to make it out like my life is so horrible or anything. I've just got shit to take care of. And now, for your viewing pleasure, lyrical stylings of Jack White and co.

Well I'm finding it harder<br> to be a gentleman every day<br> all the manners that I've been taught<br> have slowly died away<br> but if I held the door open for you<br> It wouldn't make your day<br> <br> You think that I care<br> about me and only me<br> when every single girl needs help<br> climbing up a tree<br> well I know it don't take much<br> to satisfy me<br> <br> Maybe it's whatever's in my head<br> that's distracting me<br> but if i could find emotion<br> to stimulate devotion<br> well then you'd see<br> <br> Well I'm finding it hard to say<br> that I need you twenty times a day<br> I feel comfortable so baby why<br> don't you feel the same?<br> have a doctor come and visit us<br> and tell us which one is sane<br> <br> Well I never said I wouldn't<br> Throw my jacket in the mud for you<br> but my father gave it to me so<br> maybe I should carry you<br> then you said<br> ""You almost dropped me""<br> so then I did<br> and I got mud on my shoes

I remember when Paradoxx used to be crazy for that song. Good times."

"event","I used a little extra money from my mom to buy a jump rope, a hand grip trainer, and a book about self esteem. I rock so hard right now. My quads are all sore from the squats I did. MY QUADS, DUDEBRO.

Today I walked around in the park a bunch, saw some cool shops, smoked a lot, watched doggies play, and had some sex. Good day.
The sun is actually shining, and it's above 40f. I have not been this eager to get outside in years.
And Cooking Mama 2 is still the most hardcore game out there.

"event","I need more stuff to fill my time. More rewarding stuff. I did a bunch of pushups and squatthrusts tonight. That helped a bit.

I need to be surrounded by more... dykey... stuff. I'm tired of hanging out with straight boy culture. I'm sure you know what I mean. Straight guy stuff and lesbian stuff, while there is <i>some</i> crossover, is just not the same thing.
The other day I was hanging out with some (awesome) queer hippy kids from the neighborhood (yay I have a neighborhood). The subject of horror movies came up and everyone was like ""EEK VIOLENCE.""
I'm no stranger to the old ultraviolence, and I thought it was kind of cute. It's refreshing to meet people who aren't all jaded and evil. No offense, jaded and evil friends of mine.

But I'm bored today. My trip to the park was alright but in retrospect it really involved sitting and watching other peoples' dogs play for 45 minutes. I think I can do better than that. Christ.

I want a pair of big glasses. If I were to stay girly, I'd want to be this evil jaded beautiful bitch with cleopatra bangs and big glasses.
Oh shit, did I just describe Jenny from the L Word?

I might just go back to the faux hawk though. I really can't decide. I feel like I'm a bit of a hypocrite going about all butch and dykey when I'm not really that experienced with women.
Well, I'm not that experienced in general.
WELL SORT OF. I've made out with plenty of girls, and fooled around a little, but I've never really had sex with anyone beside Lilith. I've yet to experience the whole vagina... sex... thing.

But that being said, I want it to be the ~right moment~
I feel sort of dumb for clinging to a notion like that, but it's true.

I mean... I'd like to have another relationship. Not just sex, but some degree of intimacy and the whole nine yards.

Oh, I've been thinking about something. My hair is long now, and I've sort of been struggling with the whole ""where do I fit in"" dilemma.
Back in Massachusetts, I tried to do the dyke thing. I really tried. But it's fucking hard when you're the only one. Me and Lilith were the only dykes I knew there, beside like... a friend of my dad's, and a handful of emotionally-damaged shut ins at my school. NO OFFENSE, they were just all highly medicated and socially inappropriate. But not socially inappropriate in a sparkley and fabulous sort of way. Socially inappropriate in a sad but undeniably obnoxious sort of way. One girl had been adopted and abused and had a voice sort of like Rosie O'Donnel. She liked crossdressing and once said ""I love pregnant women. For some reason when I see them, I just want to bang them"" in front of the LGBT club's advisor and the bus driver.
Another guy was a transphobe who was really into gemology, or whatever the hell you call it. He was a cooking major, and he gave me grape jam he made. That was nice of him, but my family ate it all.
Another was a butch dyke who used to wear baggy stained shirts every day and was so heavily medicated for her anxiety disorder she could barely form a sentence.
Another was a girl named Stacey, who actually did become my good friend. She was still pretty kooky, though.
I mean, there's kooky like ""I know the rules of social interactions and I choose to ignore them for entertainment purposes,"" and then there's just... kooky.
I'm superficial, I know. But it just wasn't the ~lesbian sisterhood~ I was looking for.

I'm rambling, ahahah.

When I was little I used to have a dream of one day meeting others like me. Girls who liked sex, art, truth. Girls who defied social conventions. Girls who were smart enough to critique the straight male sexual fantasies surrounding us every day, but not above liking boobies.

Could I be close to achieving my dream? Maybe now finally, <i>finally,</i> I'm close to the community I seek. Maybe I can cut the hair on my head, show off the hair on my legs, and my peers will nod approvingly. Maybe my dykish mannerisms will invoke amusement and comraderie, instead of confusion and mistrust.

With most people, there inevitably comes a time when a dark cloud passes over the conversation and I can tell, I can just <i>tell,</i> I've crossed the line and committed a grave sin with my gender presentation.
Sometimes it's something endearingly zany like ""I'll be right back, I have to go drain the snake."" Other times it's something as inoccuous as ""I'm thinking of cutting my hair,"" when it already falls only to my earlobes. PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET THIS SHIT. It makes their tiny heads explode, and it makes me feel like I must be fucking weird or something.
I look at myself and I think ""I'm a fucking dyke. I have(/had) short hair which I dye unnatural colors. I curse, I swagger, I girlwatch. Ain't it cute?""
But I felt like everyone else was only looking at me and thinking ""What... is... this... person?""
Sort of like the Eddie Izzard bit.

<i>When I walk into a shop in a dress, I can see the fear in the shopkeeper's eyes. They can't deal with it. The signal goes through to the brain, ""No information on this. Suggestions: Take all the Twixes out of the drawer. Sellotape all the newspapers together.""</i> -Eddie Izzard

BUT! The grand point I'm reaching is that perhaps, I'm now in a land where my self expression will be met with appreciation instead of confusion. Maybe I can be the happy girlboy boygirl dykey gayboy fagdyketron I've always wanted to be.

'Cause I grew my hair out. I feel like I'm trying to recapture a moment in my past, where I was pre-gender and my hair was long and nasty and I wore the same pair of dangly gold earrings every day, because they were comfortable and I was too lazy to change them.

But the past is the past. There's no going back.

I really need to change my icon. Bleh, lazy. I'm gonna do more pushups. That'll be easier ?_?
Then my muscles are gonna beat Lilith up. It's ok, she'll enjoy it. *posts without proofreading, CUZ FUCKIT*"

Mostly.

Spring break yaaay! Today I celebrated by going for a walk in the park. Ok, I'm boring :B
But I smoked up first so that made it a little more fun. I've been smoking a lot with Lilith lately, and <lj user=""moonspark""> a couple times. Good times. Weed feels like a reward for having made it to adulthood. Haha.

If you're against weed and you're reading this, well, I'm sorry.
But then again, how many of my friends are really against weed? Maybe I should stop being so nervous about opening up and stuff.

Anyway, I was walking along in my Docs with my glow in the dark hoodie and my Grindhouse messenger bag, and I was feeling sort of out of place. Everywhere around me were professional-looking young people. Everyone's so groomed and perfected, and I'm just in a t-shirt and jeans with the aforementioned stuff. I dress sort of like a teenager. Oh well.
But all the kids and doggies were running around and playing. It was really fun just watching the dogs romp and do their thing. I really like dogs, though I usually still insist I'm a cat person. The main drawback to dogs is that they tend to smell. I'm sorry dogs, it's not your fault. I just don't like having to wash my hands after I pet you.
Of course cats aren't necessarily more bacterially sterile, technically. But at least they don't make your hands smell.

Anyway, I had my dog Cassie for years and years, and I dogsat my dad's girlfriend's dog Sulu a fair amount. And I watched a lot of Dog Whisperer. Everyone over at <lj comm=""dogsintraining""> seems to think Ceser Milan is a bad man and far too punishment-based. There was a time when I would have laughed at that, but it did get me rethinking my approach to dog training. I read a really interesting article on dominance behavior, too.
Basically I've learned that while animal behavior is largely open to interpretation, the whole concept of dominance struggle is possibly/probably a mostly human invention. It's a little ridiculous to use dominance as an excuse for a behavior you don't like. But really, whether the behavior is dominance or not really isn't that relevant to any training you might be trying to do.
For example, if your dog is darting out the door in front of you, is that really a gesture of dominance? Or has the dog simply learned that rushing the door is a good way to get the reward of going outside?
And whether it's dominance or not, the solution is the same. Make the dog sit and wait and be calm before being allowed through the door.

Anyway, I have hands-on experience with dogs but I don't have much experience watching multiple dogs play together. Cassie wasn't the most socially adjusted of dogs. She was neurotic, was never taught to recall properly, and liked to bark at strangers.
So watching all the dogs playing was a nice change. Observing their interactions is really interesting, to me. I love thinking about animal behavior.
At one point there was a scuffle. A little brown scrappy dog, who had been a bit of a bully the whole time, started repeatedly pinning this beautiful little sheepdog-looking-thing. The owner of the pitbull was obviously allowing his dog to act like a bully, it was so annoying. But equally annoying, the sheepdog couple gathered around their dog and babied it for a good full minute, before leashing it and promptly leaving the park.
The whole exchange bothered me. Firstly, because the guy with the bully dog seemed to be completely unaware of the fact that he could prevent his dog from acting like an asshole. I'd seen him giving it other commands, so I know he was familiar with dog training. The dog actually had a pretty good recall. But when it came to the dog's obnoxious social habits, the guy just stood there like he was waiting it out.
Second, the people with the sheepdog was certainly insuring that their dog would have a fucking negative impression of the park. Praising it extensively in a nervous state, and then leaving without giving the dog a chance to run and play some more. Argh. It was such a pretty little sheepdog-looking thing, with so much playful energy. They're going to turn it into a neurotic mess.

And last, why should the dog with the bad behavior be allowed to stay, while the friendly dog that played gently has to leave? Cry.

But after that, I had a good experience. A little black dog was walking around me, and I hadn't petted a dog yet, so I tried to call her over. She sped past me, so I crouched down, avoided eye contact, and held out my hand. To my delight, she turned right around and came over to lick my hand.
After that, her owner approached and told me it was a rare honor for her to approach someone, because she's actually quite timid. I started asking about her, and it turned out she used to be a bait dog for pitbull fights. He explained that a bait dog was a lab/pitbull mix that is used to train pitbulls to attack. The bait dog is killed by the pitbulls. I knew dogfighting was brutal, but I think that's the worst thing I've heard about it.
I was so thankful for knowing how to give this sweet little timid dog a positive experience with a human. Even if the other dogs were learning how to become more aggressive and more frightened, at least this little one might be a little closer to trusting humans. Thank you, knowledge of canine behavior.

It really made me miss having a dog. I really can't afford one right now though, time-wise or money-wise. Some day I'll have a big beautiful malamute, though. Who will be the star of the dog park :D"

I want to be spontaneous like a beast. I want to cast off all these fucking years of bullshit conditioning and brainweashing. My parents are fuckking psuedo-hippy yuppy racists who think their neo-paganism is liek SO DEEP and excuses them from being hypocritical child abusers. Their ""alternative parenting style"" aka FUCKING ABUSE is so fucking golden and godly and sets them above mortal parents. Fuck all this fucking hypocritical paranoid misanthropic self-indulgent fake hippy BULLSHIT. I FUCKING HATE IT.
All the good in my life came from fucking <i>me, myself, and no one but fucking me.</i> You know what? I was an awesome kid. I was too fucking cool for my parents to even fucking handle or comprehend. I was artistic, spiritual, innocent. I took all the fucked up bullshit my parents gave me and made it into something beautiful for myself. I used to think I owed it all to them, that it came from them. I used to buy into their crap and believe they taught me to be spiritual, to be open-minded. Now I see I was just taking the shallow facade of these things and actually <i>doing</i> them, putting them into practice, believing in them instead of using them to make myself look good.

And I don't give a fuck if this sounds like teenageangstwank. I'm fucking tired of listening to my parents' voice inside my head saying ""YOU HAVE IT SO FUCKING EASY.""

It's a sick joke that my parents always told me I was lucky and had it easy. Yeah, saying it doesn't make it true, now does it? You fucking abusive self-indulgent assholes.

FUCK IT ALL. Fuck their voices in my head telling me I'm not good enough, telling me I'm fake, my feelings aren't real feelings, my interests are shallow pleas for attention. THAT IS YOUR SHIT, NOT MINE. Fuck them for projecting that bullshit on me.</lj-cut>

hello I am a livejournal

My name is Fatima

Just kidding  my name isn't really Fatima. I don't want people to read that and be like ""HOLY SHIT YOUR NAME IS NOT FATIMA YOU DARN LIAR"" and get all ANGRIFIED at me.

Ok, I type in caps a lot. Is that annoying? I feel like nothing else properly expresses the DEPTH OF MY EMOTION

See, there I go again.

I am double-spacing this LJ entry at the request of my history professor.

What's the deal with professor vs. teacher? My natural instinct is to say ""teacher,"" but I always feel like I'm comitting some sort of unspoken breach of student behavoir etiquette. I've never had anyone complain, but I always fear if one of my superiors were to overhear me they are inwardly roaring HOW DARE SHE ADDRESS ME WITH SUCH DISHONOR

Today I went with my buddy <lj user=""moviepimpdj""> to south street, cause he was agettin' his eyebrow pierced. The place was called Infinity, as I recall. It was fun, a nice place, and the piercing looks super good. I'm jealous. I still can't decide what sort of piercing I want, if any. I really fucking miss my tongue piercing. It was like, the only piercing for me. funfact: I had my tongue pierced before my first kiss. I guess that's either kind of badass or kind of sad. THE BALL IS IN YOUR COURT.
I had to take it out because I thought it was making my gums receed. But in retrospect, it could have been my retainer that made my gums receed. It definitely was the thing that started the recession to begin with, and my sister's retainer made her gums receed even worse than mine.
Y'know, we could probably fucking sue the orthodontist who made us those retainers. My sister is going to need to pay something ridiculous like $500 per tooth, if she wants to get her gums fixed. Also, the dentist completely failed to stop her gums from receeding. They just kept blaming different things, like her toothpaste and the denture solution she was soaking her retainers in (??) and, finally, her piercings, rather than just admitting that the orthodontic appliance itself was to blame.
I mean, when I first got my retainer it had a jagged spot obviously sticking into my gum, which is what began my recession.
Neither of us wear our retainers anymore. Good riddence.
The other obnoxious thing is, I tried to do research and find out if there was an appropriate time to stop wearing your retainers. All the sites I found just said ""LOL WEAR YOUR RETAINERS EVERY NIGHT, YOU BAD GIRL.""

So now that I don't have to worry about that shit anymore, maybe I could get my tongue repierced. Maybe I will... and maybe I will!"

"event","I think one of the most unsettling things about the whole situation with my parents is realizing how little I really know either of them. Since the separation, my mom seems to picture herself as some sort of promiscuous femme fetale. She's always dating and screwing people from OkCupid, and when she's around her girlfriend, often every other word out of her mouth is related to sex or some sort of perversion.
For example, we were watching a Catholic mass on TV and she remarked ""I wonder how many of those choir boys just got fucked in the ass?""
Really, mom?
Judgment calls aside, I have never ever known my mother as this sort of person. I can only assume she used to be this way before she became a wife and mother, also. When my dad met her, she must have seemed like some sort of smoldering sex goddess to a simple country boy like him.
He would apparently grow to resent this about her, as so many things in his life.
As for my dad, before I moved out he was working on a lot of soul searching with his new ""wise woman"" girlfriend, Helen. One day we were sitting and smoking and he was unloading his emotional burden as so many times before. He was explaining to us about the deep resentment and hatred inside him, and how it makes him hate himself in turn.
Always playing amateur psychologist, I tried to assure him that admitting the resentment and facing it without fear is the best course of action (right?). ""After all,"" I said, ""it's normal to have feelings of resentment and anger sometimes. It's not like you killed anyone or something, right?""
There was a brief silence, and then he said gravely, ""I used to shoot frogs with a BB gun. I would go to this pond behind my house, and shoot them. They were a pest and everything, but this one time I was out there for hours and when I was done, there were 50, 60 frogs floating in the water. My mom called me in for dinner, and as I sat there to eat I just felt sick.""

This was really scary to me at the time, because you know, killing and hurting animals is a sign of very bad things in the future. But even aside from that, as I sit here now I'm realizing I know almost nothing about my father. My mom was always careful to hide certain aspects of herself from me and my siblings, such as her views on sex and weed. But my dad... do I really even have a vague clue what sort of person he is? He always told me his main ""issue"" was that his mother rejected him when he was 3, and because of that, he learned that his needs weren't important and that he should always try to please other people. He told me he was a classic ""nice guy."" But that's not the fucking half of it. Through knowing Helen, and being involved in conversations between the two of them, I've learned that before he was 3, he was extremely spoiled, as my extended family is wont to do with first-borns. Being a first-born son, I imagine it was even more extreme for him.
So when he turned 3 and was ""rejected,"" the more appropriate word might actually be ""dethroned."" His little sister was born, and he was no longer the little man of the house.
I've also heard grave remarks about how he used to bully his siblings mercilessly. I've never heard any actual stories about this, but that leads me to suspect the reality of it must have been pretty damn bad.

So here I am. I've spent my whole life believing this lie, that my dad was a classic ""nice guy"" who just wants to make the people around him happy, and ends up on bottom because of it. This is the image he presents to the world, because he fears the person inside of himself (wow, that was deep.)
I think growing up with a mother who was fairly secretive and lied about sex and drugs for my ""own good,"" and a father who was basically living a lie, has made me really incredulous about human identity in general. My siblings seem to have this trait also, as is apparent when my sister laughed at me when I told her I thought I might have swine flu.
Growing up with people who hide their true selves makes you assume it's impossible to really know anyone. When people expose their thoughts and feelings, I find myself thinking ""so? Is that all? Does it really matter? Is this even true? What's your angle?""
Honestly, watching Dexter has taught me a lot about the difference between being genuine and projecting a mask. Even a very very good mask can't cover your true self from yourself. Even though you may fool other people, it will affect <i>you.</i>
In this way, I think I'm learning to really listen to myself, for the first time. Because I could never trust the emotional expressions of my parents, I learned to dismiss my own emotional responses. I learned to disregard my own judgment, because in my world, reality didn't matter. Everything revolved around these masks, and my parents played out psychodrama through these masks.

And because I was fucking home schooled and sheltered, I was up in their shit all fucking day. Oh, life :D

So I guess this is a documentation of a pretty big personal insight. Growing up is fun sometimes."

Today I found out that among a certain irc channel, I'm the only one whose parents told them ""sex is for married people.""
I'm sure it's not <i>that</i> uncommon, but jeez, I thought surely <i>most</i> peoples' parents told them ""wait till you're married to have sex."" Is my family really that fucked up?
For a little background, my mom allowed us unfettered access to an old copy of playboy she had when I was about 7 years old. It was supposedly ""educational"" for us. She also rented me Rocky Horror, To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar, and Paris is Burning, because I was asking questions about gay people (????). I was 8 when this happened. I know, because I really wanted to see Rocky Horror in the theater, but my mom said ""you're too young. You can see it on your 9th birthday though.""
For a while I was supposedly going to make a Columbia costume and go see Rocky Horror on my birthday. Until I started reading about Rocky Horror online, and read things about people stripping naked and having sex in the theater. I didn't really want to be involved in that... when I was 9 =/
IT SEEMED A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE. Go figure.

If I had questions about gay people, aren't there much more appropriate ways to educate a child aside from R rated movies?

So yeah. On top of all that, she tells us ""don't have sex until you're married."" I don't fucking get it.

Did you ever reach a point in your life when you finally gain some perspective on your childhood?
For example, I spent my whole childhood being told ""you're fine, our family is fine, we don't have any problems, you couldn't possibly be sad because our family is perfect and loving and we're doing everything Right&copy;""
For a long time I believed that. Then I went through a stage of confusion and anger at my parents. But now I'm at a point where I can honestly put things in perspective and see many things were just fucking <i>wrong</i> about my childhood.
I'm not even feeling super emotional about this right now. I just feel liberated, honestly. It feels good to be able to think rationally and maturely about this, and realize that I didn't deserve all the crap that went on.

I'm sorry if this comes across as a huge wall of ANGST but it really feels great to be able to write about it honestly. I want the truth about my childhood to be out there in the world, somewhere."

<lj-cut text=""cut for crazy family stuff and attempted suicide"">
Over the summer, my sister tried to kill herself. She was having problems with drinking and bulimia and cutting. She lost two jobs because of the alcohol. She'd been in and out of clinics for months. One day the rest of us went to the mall, and while we were out we got a call from her boyfriend. I forget what he said exactly, but we went home and found the police and an ambulance at our house. We've had this happen a couple other times, like the second job she was fired from. At that point, she'd been having a sort of drunken self-destructive freak out, screaming and crying and hitting herself, beating her head against the floor, etc.
This time basically she was drunk with alcohol she'd obtained, she took a bunch of pills that belonged to my mom's girlfriend, cut herself badly, threw up everywhere, wrote a suicide note, and then called her boyfriend.
By the time we got there, she was in the ambulance. There was blood all over the kitchen floor and the office where she'd used the phone and wrote the note.

She went back into clinics and programs after that, and she seems to be doing alright now, after several months.
I just don't really know how to process everything. I guess I'm holding it together pretty well, or maybe I've just dealt with so much from my family that at this point I'm just sort of used to it.
I wish I had more people to talk to about this sort of thing, but I never really know what to say. ""Hey, did you hear my sister tried to kill herself?""

Sad stuff aside, I am doing my damndest to hang in there. I'm moving to Philly, that is my escape plan. I'm using all my wiles to get through this. It may be tough, but it's better than the bubble of denial my family used to live in.
And I guess everyone reaches a point when they realize how fucked up their family is. But that doesn't make it suck any less.</lj-cut>"

I think my mom sexually warped me by letting me watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show over and over when I was 12. She encouraged it, and told me I could go see it with her live when I turned 13.
That never happened! Eventually my dad got mad and told me and my siblings that the things in Rocky Horror weren't ""normal."" He started talking about all the abnormal sex in it, saying ""I don't do these things.""
Of course I had such little comprehension of sex at this point, his lecture just freaked me out and made me feel like a pervert.

Speaking of perversion, I think at one point I ran away from everyone who actually understood me, because I was afraid of who I was. I also didn't have the strength or experience for good relationships. But now I find myself missing my old friends, they understood me a hell of a lot better than my family. Better than most people in general.

This might sound dumb but I really miss my old circle of internet friends. I feel bland and boring now. My life isn't filled with interesting things, it's filled with homework and attempts to recapture feelings I had when I was younger.
I didn't appreciate what I had when I had it.

Oh, I have a giant crush on one of my friends. I'd call it more than a crush, but she doesn't want to date a polyamorous person with a fiance. Fucking details.
Polyamory is really fucking me in the ass right now. I can't see my fiance because she's in another state, but I can't date anyone else because no one will fucking go for the polyamory thing.

God my life is boring. I never should have dumped my old friends. What a stupid fucking superiority complex.
I hope I can either get back in touch with them, or meet new people I click with."

"event","I think it's funny how until Twilight, every new vampire novel or movie was assuredly accompanied by a quote from someone claiming ""the author brings new life to the tired and cliche vampire genre!""
This always pissed me off because I <i>like</i> vampires, thank you very much.
Then the book or movie would inevitably attempt to bring ""new life to the vampire genre"" by making up some bullshitty story about the origins of vampires, like how Anne Rice eventually decided vampires came from a demigod in Egypt that possessed a king and queen, or in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Last-Vampire-Collectors-Black-Blood/dp/0671020609/"">The Last Vampire</a> a demigod in India, or in Underworld... it was something about two brothers who became a vampire and a werewolf, respectively.
I never liked this, for a couple reasons. One, suspension of disbelief can only go so fucking far. VAMPYRES R MAGICK just doesn't float my boat.
Second, I read a vampire book because I want to read about fucking <i>vampires.</i> I want blood drinking and innocence and redemption and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Darksome-Thirst-Morven-Westfield/dp/0974174033"">darksome thirst</a>s, not fucking magical powers and fruity gods and shit.

That brings me to my next gripe. Another thing they like to do is give the vampires either crazy karate skills, or dorky MAGIC MISSILE powers or laser vision and shit. It's one thing if your vampire can fly or transform or has super strength or speed. Those are pretty much canon. But if you're powering up your vamps and making them fight elaborate dorky battles with each other, just write a fucking ninja story or something and stop wasting my time.

Another more minor gripe is when people throw out nearly the entire established vampire canon, particularly if this is part of the ""NEW SPIN ON VAMPIRES"" thing. Taking a <i>few</i> liberties is fine, part of the fun of vampires is theorizing about what it means to be a vampire and what vampires would be ""really like."" But it's like we're heading towards a battle of ""how un-vampiric can you make your vampires?"" If all vampires can walk in the sun (a la Twilight,) don't fear crosses (Interview et all,) don't sleep in coffins, don't have fangs(!?), and eat human food... well what's the fucking point? They're not vampires anymore, they're just emo.

Another minor thing that bugs me is that male vampires usually get to be all angsty and fae or dark and broodingly sadistically hot, whereas female vampires tend to get pigeonholed as temptresses. That, or they're just... absent. I guess this might be because straight girls love vampires. I'd love to see a female vampire with some depth. Though I suppose females have the monopoly on child vampire roles, a la Interview and Let the Right One In.

Oh, but that brings me to another gripe. Sometimes vampire stories border on just fucking sexist. My two favorite vampire books, Interview and Lost Souls, both have this problem. Interview moreso in the later books, though. Oh, and let's not forget Twilight. But the whole ""vampire babies eat their way out of the vagina"" thing has so many <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications"">unfortunate implications.</a>
Vampire and werewolf books both tend to suffer from the ""...AND THAT'S WHY THERE ARE NO FEMALES"" syndrome. This ties into the New Spin on Vampires thing, because the author usually acts like excluding female characters of the supernatural persuasion is a really neat and fresh idea. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bitten-Women-Otherworld-Book-1/dp/0452286034"">Bitten</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Souls-Poppy-Z-Brite/dp/0440212812"">Lost Souls</a>, and to a lesser extent the Vampire Chronicles suffer from this. Again, it's a twist with <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications"">unfortunate implications</a>.

And I think that pretty much finishes up the things I dislike about the vampire genre. Well, we barely even touched Twilight, but it breaks most of the rules anyway. Surprisingly, there actually are a few notable rules it doesn't break. It was refreshingly oblivious to the New Spin thing, even though it did change things up. It also has a bevvy of female vampires, fruity as they may be. So while the Twilight saga is totally mormon and totally <a href=""http://gonk.urbanup.com/1405968"">gonk</a>, at least it seems genuine.

I should follow this up with a list of things I like in vampire stories, but that isn't nearly as much fun as bitching about the things I don't like! :D
I'm just hard on vampires because I love them so much.
Oh yeah, what I started to say back in paragraph one is that it's funny how before Twilight, everyone was convinced that the vampire genre was basically cliche and dead. And then Twilight happened, and vampires are suddenly the new shit. Go figure.

I ate so much thanksgiving leftovers tonight. Helen made the most delicious stuffing ever. It's cornbread stuffing with corn and walnuts in it. It's so delectable.

I'm going to Boston with my mom her girlfriend Madi and Brett and my friend Eve. I'm so excited, I haven't seen Eve in forever. She's super cute and a huge sweety. We're gonna go to headshops and stuff and eat some ooooriental cuisine.

I need some new anime to watch. I've been trying Rosario+Vampire but it's really just silly and brainless. I need something cool and welldone! Or failing that, hilariously funny."

"event","Living at my dad's now. Life is weird. I finally got my driver's license and I'm moving to PA. That's all great but I still feel depressed somehow. I'm trying to make friends but the whole thing is sort of weird. Sometimes I worry the internet has made me too warped to comprehend most people.
But I think that's just depression talking. So I'm just hanging in there, hoping I'll feel better eventually, and doing my best to make friends and be productive in the meantime. I think the atmosphere here might just be bad. My dad and his girlfriend are both nice, especially the girlfriend, but they're both pretty depressed and anxious all the time.

Some days are better than others. I'm really proud of myself for getting my license and getting accepted to Temple U. But I wish I was expressing myself artistically and enjoying the company of other people.

I have a crush on an internet friend of mine but really it's just silly. She's even more depressed and anxious than I am. My crush makes me happy though, and gives my sex drive something to do. Really I just wish I was with Sascha already.

Oh, I basically got dumped by this girl Chelsea I was sort of dating. I don't... really... know what happened there.

I haven't been strength training anymore. I'm getting out of shape. At least I get a fair amount of exercise going up and down stairs at school and the like.
I have a big crush on Jeffree Star too. Yum.

I feel really jaded and sort of worthless. But I'm moving in the spring, I just need to hang on until then."

I'm rushing trying to get ready for my trip to visit Sascha in GA, and I'm feeling needy and a little irritable all at once. I'm yearning for comforting words from her, yet sensitive towards feeling bossed around. I'm tired of feeling like a pushover. But expressing that can go so wrong.
The comforting words she did give me felt like relief, though. I'm just worn out. Stupid things like meeting my sister's friend, or going to the gym, can mentally exhaust me. I don't talk about it with my family very much. I tried to talk about it with my mom and she said ""oh, that's interesting."""

"event","so i just realized i have been complaining a lot.... i am sorry.I love you guys and I shouldn't be putting all my negative energy on these posts so that if you decide to read it you feel overwhelmed with shit. so now for a nice update:

Schools fun enough that i am seriously going to miss it this summer. people are fun and its nice to be independant from family and crap, not that i wasn't before. 

William and I haven't split up like a bunch of people thought we would for some reason so thats cool.

I can see nicks updates now which is pretty awesome! thanks nick.

I got to see family!

I got to see william's family and tigger over the weekend.

I was thinking and I dont have as much to do as i really think i do or something otherwise i would be doing it...silly Laura

umm oh alysha when are you done with school we should have an old fashioned sleepover or something this summer!

I like figuring out classes for college way better than high school because its all choices! yay for choices!


Go good things that keep me from driving me insane! Fuck school! yay people that are cool!"

"event","Today was fun... hehe. Actually today was a great day. First it is a tuesday which means I don't have class till 9:30 so I dont have to wake up till 9:00 if I want to. second, I had breakfast at the dinning center which was great, we actually have an awesome dinning center, everyone usually hates their school food but I really like mine so that was good. Then the next great thing was that I got a topic for my german research paper. I wasnt sure what I wanted to do so I gave my ideas of what I wanted to my prof. and she said I should go with homosexuality in germany so thats cool. So I got some books and started to research. Then after I got out of the library it was SNOWING!!!! yay SNOWING! i love snow! then I went to get sushi which william and I have decided is going to be our new tradition that the first snowfall of a winter is sushi day! yay! so then i went to a psych study, we have to have 4 credits of study participation, and this was my last one! and it was fun! it was an online chat where we chatted amongst others in the study in a little room w/o knowing which 4 other people in the room we were chatting with. We talked about political things like bush, nudists, oil, Iraq etc. Twas entertaining and everyone agreed with my ideas so that was also cool. Then I went to my room and called my mom which was fun, I signed up for a sushi class i am going to take tomorrow and then I ate free pizza and figured some stuff out about my schedual and then I went shopping at target and got some stuff for william for our 2 year anniversary which is going to be on Sunday! It is so windy out though! its crazy. and then william and I decided to go to the Adult emporium to check it out. man it was expensive, I guess MN buys more sex crap or something. but yeah so nothing was bought you sickos lol. and then oh! I bought a tree at target, its 6 feet tall! that might be too tall.... oh well... oh and umm yeah so thats neat. Then i came back to my dorm, went to see how william was and he made hot chocolate for me! it was fun and now i am in his room sipping hot chocolate! im happy! YAY!"

50,000 + wounded
DOWN WITH IMPERIALISM


We're starting a ""white shoe polish"" protest. If you want to help, please do! Grab some white shoepolish and hit the back of your windshield on your car. Wake these sleeping masses up! Write something...anything. ""Peace Now"" ""No More US Imperialism"" ""No more blood for oil"" ""No more boy kind crusades, bring our troops home"" ..........etc...........Whatever. Just something! Wake these people UP!!! HELL, we've got a ""soccer mom"" that's chaining herself to the White House. Are you REALLY ""outside of mainstream""? Are you really awake? Then stop being so bloody melancholy about everything and DO SOMETHING...ANYTHING about this. We have a many wounded now (of our troops) that died in Vietnam. How much blood is it going to take for you to do something ANYTHING about Imperialistic America?!? I know so many that are so ""daring to be different"" with spiked collars and pink hair...but do you really have the balls that it takes to ACTUALLY be different and stand up for a change?!? Got news for ya guys...corporate America is HOPING you won't do anything. You've got rage? You've got angst? You've got intelligence? Then do SOMETHING. Personally, I am so sick of this! 

Join the white shoe polish cars and get people to wake up. 
Enough is enough ""Boy king George"". We're done with the ""new crusades"".
I support our troops...I don't support Imperialism or soldiers lives being used for lies. 
This doesn't even start in on the horrors the people living there face. ..........


White Shoe Polish Protest Now!!!


Please pass this along / repost this / email this / etc ....if you feel so inclined...."

Fade in start the scene
Enter Beautiful girl
But things are not what they seem
As we stand at the edge of the world

Excuse me sir,
but I have plans to die tonight
Oh, and you are directly in my way
and I bet you're gonna say it's not right
My reply:
Excuse me miss,
but do you have the slightest clue
of exactly what you just said to me
and exactly who you're talking to?

She said, ""I don't care you don't even know me""
I said, ""I know but I'd like to change that soon hopefully""
Yeah, we all flirt with the tinniest notion
of self conclusion in one simplified motion
you see the trick is that you're never supposed act on it
no matter how unbearable this misery gets

You make it sound so easy to be alive
but tell me how am i supposed seize this day
when everything inside me has died
My reply:
Trust me girl
I know your legs are pleading to leap
but i offer you this easy choice
instead of dying, living with me

She said, ""Are you crazy? You dont even know me""
I said, ""I know but I'd like to change that soon hopefully""
Yeah we all flirt with the tinniest notion
of self conclusion in one simplified motion
you see the trick is that you're never supposed act on it
no matter how unbearable this misery gets

I would be lying if I said that things would never get rough
and all this cliche motivation, it could never be enough
I could stand here all night trying to convince you
but what good would that do? My offer stands and you must choose

Alright you win but I only give you one night
to prove yourself to be better than my attempt at flight
I swear to god if you hurt me I will leap
I will toss myself from these very cliffs
and you'll never see it coming
Settle precious, I know what you're going through
Just ten minutes before you got here I was gonna jump too

Yeah we all flirt with the tinniest notion
of self conclusion in one simplified motion
you see the trick is that you're never supposed act on it
no matter how unbearable this misery gets

Anywho. Yeah, i thought it was good. So things are good here, it was williams bday so that was cool. soo yeah. time to go softball it up. ttyl bye"

Pieces of You
She's an ugly girl, does it make you want to kill her?
She's an ugly girl, do you want to kick in her face?
She's an ugly girl, she doesn't pose a threat.
She's an ugly girl, does that make you feel safe?
Ugly girl, ugly girl, do you hate her 
'Cause she's pieces of you?

She's a pretty girl, does she make you think nasty thoughts?
She's a pretty girl, do you want to tie her down?
She's a pretty girl, do you call her a bitch?
She's a pretty girl, did she sleep with your whole town?
Pretty girl, pretty girl, do you hate her
'Cause she's pieces of you?

You say he's a faggot, does it make you want to hurt him?
You say he's a faggot, do you want to bash in his brain?
You say he's a faggot, does he make you sick to your stomach?
You say he's a faggot, are you afraid you're jus the same?
Faggot, Faggot, do you hate him
'Cause he's pieces of you?

You say he's a Jew, does it mean that he's tight?
You say he's a Jew, do you want to hurt his kids tonight?
You say he's a Jew, he'll never wear that funny hat again.
You say he's a Jew, as though being born were a sin.
Oh Jew, oh Jew, do you hate him
'Cause he's pieces of you?"

It was so idiotic because the whole thing was how to properly put a condom on and take it off. I guess you never know what kind of health different people got in HS but i thought it was hilarious. but hey nothing like free condoms right?"

"event","ok so this is a rant so here comes a <lj-cut text=""live journal cut! yay. only read if you wanna read about weight things or something like that..."">&nbsp; so I was reading the schools paper and there was an article entitled ""the skinny on being fat. I thought hmm... I'm fat wonder what it will say. well I read it and it was this 130lb girl that wears size 9 jeans saying that even though she was over-weight that she should be proud of who she is and be comfortable in her shoes. HAHA ok so shes 130 lbs... that may not be skinny but thats sure as hell not fat. I think i might write in cuz im close to 200lbs and im pretty finne with my body. I get what the girl was trying to convey but i think it was totally ridiculous to start the article by talking about how bad her body is because the whole article is supposed to be about liking your body. I realize that with standards like lindsay lohan(sp) and nicole richie(haha sp?) and how they are both now anorexic and girls for some reason think they need to be that way could cause things like this, but honestly how many people actually think they look better than when they weighed a normal weight? I dont thats for sure. Im sick of so many people talking about how gross they look or that they need to lose weight, and If your gunna try to lose weight you should at least be healthy about it and not just stop eating cuz then ya end up way grosser than before. I realize i need to lose weight for health reasons but i dont really care if i do for cosmetic reasons. I feel sexy in my own ways and i dont need to be 100lbs lighter just to feel hot because i like myself now. Sure i have my days where im like bleh but i am never like wtf anymore. People just need to take time to really notice things good in their life/ body and then they realize things are better. This is kinda weird though cuz i used to cut because i thought i was stupid and gross and it was the only way to make me feel. now i realize that i feel so much more and i can love myself. its cool. I think that everyone just needs to start focusing on the good and not the bad and people will reall realize how great they really are. </lj-cut> so that is that."

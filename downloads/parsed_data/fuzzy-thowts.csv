"event","1. I like to wipe my paws off on the floor after pooping. (Mommy and Daddy don't like it much).
2. I'll scratch Mommy's chair (or do something else ""bad"") just to get someone's attention, then coo and bounce away when they yell at me. (Yes, I BOUNCE. I'm like Tigger! Grrr!).
3. When I was REALLY little, I had to sleep on Mommy/Daddy, curled up to Mommy/Daddy, UNDER Mommy/Daddy, or on/under their pillows. (They got worried about crushing me in their sleep, so they made a crate-bed for me but, I would only sleep in it as long as one of Daddy's shirts was in it).
4. When I was smaller, I'd climb up Mommy/Daddy's leg, up their body, and onto their shoulder. I didn't want to stop doing it but, I eventually learned I had to when I got heavy and they'd yelp in pain (or I'd fall off). 
5. I like to sniff and cuddle up (as close as Mommy will let me) next to the baby (wait...I'M the baby!)...the tiny person, that is. Sometimes I give her kisses. Sometimes I watch her play (I wish I could play with her!). Now, when she sees me, she starts bouncing up and down and grunting at me (I think she likes me!).

2. I will meow for help when I get stuck but, complain when you try to help me.

"event","Recently, Momma and Papa brought me home an rubber orange spwida (oops- I mean spider). Its the coolest thing ever! They throw it, I chase it, I bring it back to them, they throw it, I get it...Its so much fun! Its got little dangly legs that that jiggle *quivers with excitement* and I just have to BITE 'em! But, but not too hard...cuz then I could break them off and and then it wouldn't be as much fun. Sometimes--oh my gawd, this is so great-sometimes it it it BOUNCES!!! That's when I I I POUNCE IT *HA!* LIKE THAT and I SMACKS it! Oh its so much fun!! SPWIDAZ ARE GREAT! Oops. I call him Fred. I wonder where Fred is right now....*looks around*
But, but I don't play with Fred ALL the time...no...because I have an important job to do! That's right! When Papa leaves the house, its my job *sticks chest out* to watch Momma and the Bebe. Yup! *looks proud* Its really hard if they're in separate rooms (like when Bebe is sleeping and Momma isn't) because then I have to decide which one needs me most! So I take turns! Sometimes, I'll be by Momma's side guarding her and other times I'll be by Bebe's side (or as close as I can get) guarding her! Good idea, eh? I know, I know, I'm so snart! ...But, when Papa returns home- that's when I get to play! *big smile*
Bebe got this toy from someone and it looks like so much fun! I think they call it a ""Plagim"". She starts kicking it *wiggles bum...* and the toys start shaking and I want to, I so badly want to *...pounces air*. Like that! Yeah! But...Momma won't let me...*pouts*...cuz she's afraid I'll land on Bebe. Bbbbut I heard Krissmuss is coming and maybe, just maybe, I'll get some new toys...maybe I'll get my very own Plagim! Yeah!

I mew and mew and mew...eventually Mommy will pet me (unless she's got the baby in her arms...even though I was here first!). Sometimes Daddy will pet me. The baby doesn't pet me...but, the way she flails those arms around, I'm not sure I want her to! My fans have abandoned me. I heard they have something called ""skool"" these days and it takes up a lot of their time. I don't even see them playing outside anymore. Boy, I'm glad I don't have to go to skool if you don't even get to play! I sit in the window day after day waiting for reluctant admirers to notice me...but, no one does. *sigh* 
Mommy's been giving me a little bit of this new food lately (just a little). I must be special because the other kitties don't get any. I ONLY want to eat the new food but, Mommy will only give me so much (she says its a ""treat""). I've lost a bit of fluff. Mommy's been worried about that. But, I've been licking her face and letting her know I'm still okay. I just wish she had more time for me. That little baby hogs Mommy a lot. Toby's been bothering me a lot. I don't like it. Mommy and Daddy say they're gonna chop off his ""fuzzy nuggets"" soon (What are they? Do they come in a McDeal?). They say he'll stop pestering me once they do that. Well, if that's the case, I hope they take his fuzzy nuggets soon!

"event","I've made some changes to our journal. Not sure if I'll keep it in this format but, we'll see. What do you think about it (like I care)? 

Today I got yelled at by the Mother for almost pouncing the little human. (There was a time when she considered me to be her baby). I knew what I was doing, I have good aim. I don't know what the big deal was. The little human didn't seem to mind (again, like I care). 

Every now and then I remind the little human who's boss around here by laying down next to her and slowly nudging her over (on the bed) as the Mother pets me. I purr just incase she needs a reminder of how cute I am (doubtful!). 

The Runt has grown quite big (what a fat-ass!). His size can be intimidating but, I can take him (except for those few times I'm afraid he'll lay on me and crush me-that's when I retreat to the dresser or the couch. He can't even fit his pudgy ass under there! HA!). Ahhh, the advantage of a petite frame! 

Gizmo has been losing weight. Sometimes I worry about her but, then she'll groom my face and let me know she's okay (and I groom her back-don't you say anything!). She's a good sister.

I've decided to give up the plot for world domination. Now that I've lost some of the Mother's attention~my only plot is to get it back (and the Giants', if I feel like it). I'm also investigating this suspicious little human. (I don't think she's as innocent as she appears!). 

Anyway, my time is precious! I must be going.

"event","Much has happened since my last post. 
Its been so busy around here, I haven't had the time to update. 
The Mother and The Giant have since brought home a new Little Human. Competition? I wonder. 
She's a suspicious little character. She makes many different curious noises~ some of them are very close to my native language. I wonder if she's a spy? Maybe she's their way of trying to discover my true mission and crack my plans? Very suspicious.
I've been keeping a close eye on this Little Human...I'll figure her out soon enough! 
I've tried many times to get a closer look at her, maybe a sniff but, The Mother has called me on it and immediately dismissed me from the room. ""The Crib"" as she calls it, seems to be the Little Human's sacred place. The Mother won't allow so much as a paw in it! (Psssh! I was here first! I've been trying to remind The Mother of that and let the Little Human know at the same time but, it doesn't seem to matter). 

Well, I must return to my post at the window and watch over the neighbourhood. Someone's gotta ensure the safety of this family (don't expect the fat, orange cat to do it! Stinky beast!). 

~Valentine, esquire 
(I don't know what that means but, its sounds important...and cool!).

Despite this, I've taken it upon myself to guard the Baby and personally escort her visitors (who I'm sure are actually here for ME) to her. I even personally inspect the ""gifts"" they bring her. So far, so good, aside from the kitty treats that don't find their way into the bags. The least they could do is pay me for my efforts... I'm so underappreciated!

"event","After leaving a hairball on the floor, I realized it is what the human's call ""Mother's Day"" today. I felt pretty bad because the hairball I left specifically for The Giant to clean up was actually cleaned up by The Mother because The Giant had already been dismissed for work duty. 
A little later The Mother decided to take a nap and since I owed her for that unfortunate circumstance, I joined her... 
She slept on her side, so I gave her a nice shoulder massage (""kneeding"" you may call it) and fluffed her pillows for her. Then I curled up on her side(instead of my usual posting at the head of her bed-on her pillows-or The Perch) and napped with her. She seemed happy about it. 
Unfortunately, before I could warn the other cats of what day it was, Gizmo had already left another hairball on the floor and The Runt dropped quite the rank load in the litter box. *sigh* Some minions....

"event","So I've been keeping a closer eye on The Giant as of late. 
I was laying on his pillow the other day and can you believe he had the nerve to lay down?! *ugh* Some humans! 
I still have nothing substantial to report on The Giant however. :(    
One day however, I was trying to get into their bedroom window to keep guard of the homestead but, it is... a very awkward window to climb into. The Giant must've seen me struggling (how embarassing!) and gave me a boost. I'm not sure what his alterior motive was but... Well, we'll see.

The Mother hasn't seemed to well lately. I've noticed her struggling to get to sleep every night. So, I've decided to help her out a little (its all part of The Job!). I've slept on The Perch (reminder: her pillow) every night in hopes that she'll feel more secure with me there or be at least comforted with my quiet purrs above her head. I'm not sure that its helped her at night but, she seems to appreciate it in the day (when her body finally gives in to slumber!) I've also fluffed her pillows before and after sleep (that's what you humans refer to as ""kneeding""). She seems to like that. 

Today, I decided was ""Pay Day"". (You don't expect me to do all this work for nothing, do you?). I let The Mother know and she gladly paid me with pets, scratches, and cuddles. (Well....she's low on cash...ya know?). 

Other than that, I've decided to be a little nicer to The Runt. I let him trail behind me sometimes when I patrol the hallway at night. I run at full speed just to make sure he can keep up---he has to be up for the task! Sometimes though I have to smack him down...he just gets too excited...kids! Sheesh!

Anyway, I must depart.

Then, The Giant (Steve), comes in and corners me! He may have only wanted to pet me but, even that requires some authorization from me first! Well, I wasn't going to take my chances! I bolted out of there with another one of my smooth 'didn't-see-it-coming' moves! I was gone before he could say ""Ble Ble Nori"" (whatever the hell that means!). 
I heard The Mother give him a scolding, a little bit of a lesson on why you DON'T corner a cat. Sheesh, you'd think that was common sense! Some creatures...

This is from Momma's livejournal. Just a few pictures of us. (I think she needs more of me though). 

Kisses,

"event","I've been laying low these past couple of days. Its Gizmo's birthday today so I thought I should take a little break from world domination for now... I deserve a little vacation, don't I? 

I did a funny thing the other day *snickers to self*... I went into the litter box and trudged threw all the messes in there (I know, not very professional but, I had a point to make!) and then I went into The Mother's bedroom and stomped all over Steve's pillows! *Insert evil laugh here* 
Well, he shouldn't have strayed from his cleaning schedule--so he asked for it! I mean, com'mon, what do I pay him for?! Honestly? Okay...so maybe I don't pay him...well not in the conventional way...but, not everybody gets to see my good side every once in a while; I don't just let anyone pet me! How dare he take that for granted! I bet he never will again though... Heeheehee.

HOWEVER, he did catch me as I was about to leave the room. (Had I planned it better, I could've framed The Runt for it! Everyone knows how smelly and nasty the little brat is! ...No, no, I should be PROUD of my work! YES, I DID IT! TAKE THAT! *stands proudly with chest out*). Well, this Steve character is no SMALL human, let me tell you! A worthy opponent indeed. They say he stands about 10 feet tall and built like a pro-wrestler (whatever those are)! He's a big human! Well, there I was, approaching the doorway to freedom and there he was-blocking it! I was a little frightened, a little intimidated, I admit but, I showed NO FEAR (okay...maybe a little..but, that's beside the point). I would've taken him down like David took Golliath however, I had just bathed... I did the only thing a cat could do... I ran through his legs in searched for back-up! (Ha! Didn't see that one coming did you, Golliath?!). However, when I got to the livingroom, Gizmo and The Runt were sleeping. When you can't beat 'em: take a nap, right? Well, that's what I did!

Speaking of naps... *yawn, stretch*

"event","Hello lovers! 

Just a quick update. 
Today I had two visitors come to see me! 
They were the nice superintendant lady that ADORES me and some new guy with an apparent facination with bath tubs. Hmph...I don't get it. 
Well, anyway, they bathed (ha!) in my beauty for a few minutes and then left. I was a little disappointed that they didn't bring me any treats or flowers. Sheesh.

Good news, my admirers returned! They stood below my window and called to me ""Gizmo! Gizmo!..."" How could I ignore the precious little monkeys? To their excitement and pleasure, I appeared and let them bask in the gorgeousness that is ME! I love making people happy. 

Anyway, that is all for tonight! 

Kisses to all, 

Gizmo"

"event","Yes, I'm back! Didn't think I'd return, did you? How dare you underestimate me like that! Ahh, but, I digress... 
Last night, The Mother took my advice and left her bedroom door open so I could protect her. I'm still unsure of this ""Steve"" character that she's co-habiting with. I made my usual rounds, bursting into the room at full speed just to maybe catch Steve off-guard and put an end to his evil plans. It was...to no avail. He was asleep. The Mother was a little annoyed that I kept waking her up but, this is tough work! She must understand this! 
Later, Steve seemed a little too ""unsettled"" in his sleep, so I decided to take more precaution! I guarded The Mother from ""the Perch"". This perch is located above her head, sometimes she lays on it by mistake. She calls it a ""pillow"". I have to admit, its a very comfy place to take guard...sometimes I fall asleep (but we'll just keep that between you and I, RIGHT?!). 
It was an uneventful night. The Runt, Toboe, came in, so I decided he could pick up from where I left off. I bolted from The Perch (accidently waking The Mother) and high-tailed it out of there... Haha... Pardon the pun! 

Steve has gone off again. He leaves 5 days out of every week for about 10 hours. Its some kind of ""routine"" for him. I wonder where he goes... Could he be secretly planning my demise?! Planning to intercept my world domination?! Oh no, this must not happen...this is UNACCEPTABLE! I MUST find out where he goes these 5 days each week... But, for now, it is time I return to my lair, under the couch, where I will continue my *yawn* planning...

"event","Today I returned to my window to greet my adoring fans. 
They called to me and worshipped me. So much praise! 
They really are good followers. 
After awhile, I dismissed them. They gotta eat some time, right? 
Suddenly these rapid explosions disrupted my beautiful complextion! 
Oh boy, was I glad my fans didn't see me at that ungraceful moment. 
Momma called them, ""Sneezes"". I don't know what they are but, I know 
they certainly are NOT welcome! 
Anyway, I continued watching over my land, waiting for my fans to return...but, they did not. I was appauled! We'll just see if they're blessed enough to behold my beauty again! I asked Momma where they went but, she did not know. Ungrateful... 
Oh, look at the time! I'm late for my beauty sleep! 

Kisses, 

Gizmo"

"event","ahhhhhh good times!! so basically, to put it at the least, mountain bound was awesome. i was in group 3 - best group EVER. our group worked together soo well and everyone was so supportive. if someone needed something, everyone was up, ready to help, and everyone was encouraging everybody else, especially on snowy. 

the first day we met with our groups and then drove up, set up tents, and all that stuff. the second day, my group went to chimney mountain. amazing. the climb was pretty rough, a little over a mile but really steep. when we got to the top we hung out for a bit, and then did some climbing and repelling. i have to say, i was all hooked up, thinking, ""oh this'll be easy, no worries"" but then i got to the edge and looked down. it was SCARY. jenna and rick were amazing, they just kept telling me that it would be fine, that i'd be ok.. and i was standing there crying saying ""i cant do this!!"" and begging them to let me come back up. anyways, jenna just kept pushing me and telling me that i would be ok and finally i went down.. and actually was able to climb back up. it was awesome, one of the best experiences ever! and once you got down that first part, it wasnt hard at all. so then we went down to the caves a little later and we were squished up against the wall on the way in. i fell, and again, owe my life to jenna because she picked me back up and we kept going. (i fell a few more times after that so i gotta say thanks to her cuz she was right there each time, keeping me safe). anyways.. we then repelled down in the dark caves which was SCARY.. and then we climbed back up a little later. all in all, day 2 was crazy.. but incredibly fun.

DAY 3- GOOD TIMES. my favorite day- canoeing. i was paired up with jenna, and we canoed 18 miles total, 9 there, 9 back. on the way there we stopped at this jumping rock and jumped off a few times.. and then kept on going. mike didnt have the ""heart"" to tell us that we had missed our turn, so we kept going until we got to bald mountain. we hiked up, ate lunch up at the top, which was beautiful, and then came back down and started canoeing again. a short while into the trip back, we stopped at this 30ish foot jumping rock... and we went up to the top to jump off. i was one of the people who wasnt going to jump but all of a sudden i just ran off - it was kind of surprising for me, and everyone around me. anyways, we jumped off a few times, and again, everyone was SO supportive of the people who were scared. anyways so we continued in the canoes, and our next stop was supposed to be at ""slanted rock"" which was the first place we had stopped (it was about 2 and 1/2 hours from where the 30 ft rock was, and we were canoeing into the wind). anyways so jenna and i were canoeing and when we reached slanted rock, we were on the other side of the lake, so we decided to keep going rather than cross over. we made it back, having canoed about 7 or 8 miles STRAIGHT... no stops. it was crazy. i couldnt have asked for a better canoe partner!! then we got back to the campsite, and started making dinner. i gotta say again, thanks to jenna for keeping me calm that night and for being there for me. 

DAY 4- snowy mountain.. 3 words. OH MY GOD. it was 3 and some miles up. the first 2 miles were ok, not too steep, but the last mile was insane. there were so many rocks and it was hard to keep your balance. melissa, alyssa, molly and i made our way up to the top in about 2 hours and 40ish minutes, we definitely were NOT first. melissa was so great, she kept making goals for us to reach and if it wasnt for her i'd probably still be sitting down on one of those rocks. anyways so we reached the top, rested for awhile, ate some food.. then went up and checked out the fire tower.. watched some guys duel with the hiking poles, watched sal lose the end of one of the hiking poles, watched a bunch of guys run down the trail and find the hiking pole.. oh there were some good times!! we finally made it back down the mountain and went to get some ice cream... and then headed back to camp. 

the last day was for soloing and the ride home. i have to agree with the people who said that soloing was good.. i definitely felt it was nice to be able to get away from everything and just think for awhile.. even though there was this bug that kept attacking my head every 5 seconds.

all in all it was a great trip, with many adventures, some good, and some not so good... but all i can say is thank you SO much to the people who helped me through, especially during the last 2 days. i cant wait until next year!"

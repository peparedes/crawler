"event","As the sun fades, I fade with it.

As the winds grow strong I grow feeble.

As the rain starts falling, I feel my tears too.

As the nights grow colder, colder without you... 

Each waking moment is a struggle.

Each unanswered question is a confusion,

slowly growing out of boundaries,

slowly turning pale into nothingness... 

I hear you calling in the distance.

Fading faster..., 

coming stronger!

Teasing each senses, 

unnerving each memory 

then I grow hopeless again 

in this winter blue."

"event","It's always been dark

even when theres a little ray of light the size of a thumb.

It vanishes.

As I try to move closer.

It's always been damp and cold.

They go together; darkness, dampness and coldness.

Every book, poem and sorrowful song I read and hear;

it's written, its the unwritten.

And everytime I move to that warm place

the rain follows me.

No its not like death, not yet anyway.

I still want to be saved."

"event","Can someone save me?

Can they take me away? 

Can they erase my pain? 

Can they take off these heavy chains? 

I have dragged them so long,

it multiplies my weight.

It drags me astray 

leaving me used up and beat up. 

Can someone save me? 

Can u take me away?"

"event","The time is high.

The nights are cold.

Wings take flight.

My love is old.

Somber as I go

A look, a stare.

Waiting for you

A black-eyed glare.

A hesitating step

A pause, a glance.

One last vow.

One last dance."

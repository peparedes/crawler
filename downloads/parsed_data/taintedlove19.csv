"event","that just about sums it up. a lot. i just want to go to sleep so this terrible day can be over. here's my window to bitch so why not. and it's weird, because normally when i'm upset it's an odd mixture of attitude and hormones. but i feel unusally...sad. and lonely. it's ok, i'll feel better soon.

anyway, i must say that i loooveee TJE. our lyrical dance is kickass. like no joke beautiful. i'm stoked. atleast i have that to look forward to. and kickline, those girls have a knack for making me feel better. and mr.ferrante cause he's awesome and i'm actucally learning in that class. which is unusal because i have some pretty shitty teachers that make me maddddd. and i can't always blame some of this crap on them. or my parents. or my friends. i'm doing this to myself. i'm letting myself down.

the thing i can't change is how i feel about **you. even if you don't relieze it. even if everyone tells me i'm better than that. even if i know it and i don't care. uhg. i'm way too tramatic.

your momentarily emo lover,
jillian"

"event","what's cookin good lookin <3. i haven't updated for awhile. so let's see. what's new? this weekend was pretty...insane. my sister came home from college which was awesome cause i miss her a lot. on friday i went to a ""huge party"" at ben's. hah, that was fun. on saturday i had a kickline game, hung out with chelsea, and went to alisa's house. we watched physco. it was scaryyy. i liked it. i used to be so petrified by scary movies, but now i like them. sunday was extremely eventful. my parents went to a wedding and my sister went out so i had the house to myself. i told my mommy that shannon and andrea were coming over, which was true, but i left out the part that cody, ben, ivan, pat, alisa, and mike were too. it was fun but i'm not even gunna go into the mayhem cause i'd need about 45 minutes to type and i'm way too lazy. on monday i went shopping with kevin for his and sam's one year aniversary. congrats lovers. i also babysat and went to dance. it's offical, i switched studios and i'm a genuine TJE skank. :D very exciting.

so this week was a blur of campaigning, kickline, and dance. yea, i'm running for vice president. i actucally am into that lame school spirit stuff. whatever, it makes me happy. it's gunna be tough becuase i'm running against matt christy and he's awesome. i'll try my best and we'll see what happens. don't be a dud, vote for j.rud.

love,
Jill"

"event","hey kids. so this weekend was too busy. On friday night I performed for tournament.  It was fun and it went well but we didn't win, which was ok because the people that won def. deserved it. Saturday was absorbed by homecoming. First I marched for kickline in the parade which was cool.  After that lisa had a kickline party and I had a really good time.  The squad is tight <33.  Later was the game. bleck. I was cold and wet and felt really bad about telling people to get out of varsity kickline's seats (that's our jv's job). but they did really well, even on the slippery grass. i felt pretty shitty all night which seemed to be the popular feeling. after that i went to a shindig at jenna's which was tight. shannon was there! which was crazy because i haven't seen her out in awhile.  I slept there with amanda and linds which was funny. we made cookies and rice-a-roni but jenna sort of killed it so we threw it out.  Today me and sam worked on our english project for five hours. we made a mural and it actucally turned out really nice. I wanted to go to saint james day but we didn't have time :(. chris mexdorf stopped by and hung out with us cause he's home from college for the weekend. that was cool. then a little while ago i went to youth group. the end.

yea, so question...can anyone (i.e. pulito) help me make my live journal pretty. i noticed today that it's really not. thank you <33

jill"

"event","oh baby it's coming down. i don't like being cold but i like watching the rain and snuggling with blankies. so this weekend..on friday after practice i hung out with tyler which was fun. then on saturday i went to new jersey with my family. it was ok i guess, but i missed my sister a whole lot. on sunday i went shopping with jenna and KT. later i went to my kickline pizza party <33. it was really fun. we are such a little family. our first game was on monday. it went pretty well. there was a decently big crowd and we didn't fuck up too bad. it was a good time :). i am so exhuasted from going from acting to kickline to dance and getting home at 8:30 to start hw. this needs to stop.

"event","hey lovers. the fourday weekend was tight. here's the brief sum-up...on wendsday i was jewish with shai's family for Rosh Hashana and then i slept over which was fun. on thursday i hung out in the city with my parents and my brother and his wife. it was awesome, i love the city and my family, annndddd my daddy bought me the garden state soundtrack, which by the way is a great cd for a great movie. on friday me linds, heather, sam, shai, + some other homies went to the movies to see wimbledon which was very good. the best part was heather clapping like a champ. oh man i love her. on saturday shaina, jenna, and heather slept over and we went to kevin's house with some kids. we had a good time ;). on sunday i did the breast cancer walk and then sam came to church with me for bring a friend to church day. later i went with my parents to my other brother's house and played with his kids. they're actucally really cute for being major japs. so there you go! my weekend: abridged.

i've felt shitty lately. i'm not sure why, maybe it's hormones, but like whatever i do i can't get myself out of this weirdass mood. that's about enough emo for me.

love,

"event","hey party people. so I just got home from shai's. on the way home my dad and I got huge cups of coffee from starbucks. i am w i r e d. last night I went to a Rosha Shanna dinner and that was cool. then we went back to shai's dad's house and ate icecream. then, attempt number two, tried to watch the full monty but we both fell asleep. again. ha. me, jenna, shai, and khall watched it last weekend, which by the way was an amazing night, but me and shai fell asleep. goood work. 

so what's good? kickline! before it started i was sort of hesitant about it but those girls are awesome. and it's a great workout. our first game is the 27th, so we're kinda rushed for time. i've been practicing cause i want to make competition although it's really doubtful. they're having a jv competition team this year with 12 girls. and there's 20 of us and like 10 were on the squad last year. so we're trying out next friday. i just want to know that i did the best i could.

also, i made this school play. it's called 'jerry springer is god'. i think i get to hit someone with a chair :D. it's kinda stressing me out though cause i go from 2-3:30 and then have kickline from 3:30-6 so everythings rushed. and i feel guilty about being there half the time everyday. whatever. i have to memorize those lines. my preformance is october 1st..:)

today i'm going into the city with my brother and his wife. i looove the city so much. i'm gunna go practice now.

love you,
jill"

"event","word em up. so today was the second day of school, and it was actucally really fun. yesterday wasn't but then again i never like the first day. it's the wake up call that summer is over and that kind of reality check doesn't make me smile.

so my classes turned out to all be pretty good. my teachers seem much better than last year. i was really stressed out yesterday because my scheduel was pretty messed, but after more than a period waiting in guidance today everything got sorted out. oh, and they put me in lifetime sports haaaaa. it's like golfing and archery. whatever it should be funny. also, kickline's going really well. we have a tight team and everyone gets along. i'm really excited to kick at football games cause fall's beautiful and it's fun being on the field.

anyway, i'm gunna go collage my binders cause i'm that much of a loser :)

"event","word. i just got home from babysitting. good times...$50 and i got to sit around and watch movies like jay and silent bob strike back. kevin smith movies are really funny. anyway, today was my mom's birthday. she took me and sam to roosevelt field. we hit jackpot at hollister <33. then we came home and i slept and ate thai food (which is a freakin food orgasm). then i went babysitting for this really cute family. i like kids a lot.

last night i slept over annie's house with hannah, jen, kai, and max. it was fun. andddd eventful, ha, good times with the uu's. oh, and we saw garden state which was awesome. the soundtrack is fucking amazing :), i need to get it pronto.

you know what else i need to do? finish my summer reading. sweet jesus. i need to read a book and write two papers. i have two days. you know what's cool? i'm not even worried about it. i should get some sleep.

sweet dreams,

"event","heyhey. i just woke up. first of all, i have to tell you my body is still sore from kickline. owie. so yesterday my parents and i went up to brown to drop my sister off. she has a really big room which is unusal, and like people kept coming in and being like 'wow this is a huge room.' chelsea's dorm was on the third floor so my parents and chels grabbed something and went to go put it in her room. they left me with the job of gaurding the immense pile of stuff that was sitting by the car. in like two seconds a big group of like ten guys wearing brown tee-shirts came over and asked if i needed help. i told the room number and they whisked all the stuff away. i was impressed anndddd i didn't have to carry anything like a tv up three flights of stairs. yay. we met some of the people in her hall who were all really nice. after that chelsea registered and we walked around campus. brown, being an iv, is beautiful. and it's full of granola heads, as my brother would say, which is cool. it sucked when we had to say goodbye and my parents were teary on the way home. i'm really going to miss her.

let's start off with last night/this morning...one thing that i thought was fucking insaneeee: jen's stepdad drove here last night at 4am from east eslip to bring us a happy 'mail' delivery. whaatttt. anyway, really good night and i love my girls. u.u.'s are fucking crazy.

so today, after three hours of sleep i went to t.carlton to get a haircut with my mommy. i have to say, i don't think that once in my life have i been pleased with a haircut. i think it may be because they blow it out all ... fuzzy. anyways, it's not that bad.

at like noon my family went to jersey cause my brother and his wife just moved there. i used to be under the impression that jersey, as my sister would say, is the armpit of america, but i was wrong. they moved into a beautiful neighborhoad and i'm extra happy for them. we walked around town and ate indian food. ::so goood::

i'm really exhuasted from sleep dep, talk to you kids in the am.

so what's been going on this summer...one word ::amazing::...for like the first half of the summer i worked at saint pat's day camp with a lot of awesome people, like pof+2 (me, sam, hillary, linds, danielle marsh, marygrace, + amanda) good times man.  all the other counsilers were pretty chill to. the only thing that really blew was that we got paid $3 an hour for harddddddd work. like, these kids get out of control to the point where you need to jump ontop of a desk and scream at them. good one sam, way to be. as much as i bitched i'm probably gunna work there next year. ::loser::

so then for like most of august i went to sleepaway camp. it was sooo good. for two weeks i went upstate to unirondack. these kids are the freakin shit, like you have no idea. some highlights? 1.talent show where we dressed up as barbies 2.ninjew night 3.the rumpas (huge bondfire that you dance around while people bang on drums. and it was pouring. i was sooo muddy but it was crazy fun) 4.dare or dare night (basically sam, ryan, alex and I got an insane sugar high off koolaid during intersession and played jenga dare...and then expanded on the dares, oh man it was so funny, everyone in the lodge was like right..) 5.the dances (ah skeet skeet skeet) 6.mud wrestling (i kicked gwen's ass but me and sam tied) 7.baja unirondack (me + alexis trying to tap amon in a canoe :)) 8.estrogen fest (""shut the fuck up mother teresa""-nina) 9.skeet (oh man) 10.beanie man (i love nina and her ghetto booty) 11.bag under chadwick (so fucking hilarious) 12.put it in my mouth (hahaha) 13.""poke fest"" (ha camping with nerddyyy guys...one of the brilliant things to come out of this annoying kid's mouth. ok another story, me and olivia were talking and one of us said something about beer so this kid comes out of nowhere and was like 'wait beer, like real beer?' and we were like ?! and he was like 'are you guys serious?' and i was like no i was talking about rootbeer ::rolls eyes:: and he's like 'ohhhh i totally missed the root'). i miss you guys like woah and you need to come visit me.

the other sleepaway camp, sophia fahs, was on shelter island for a week. k, so the one thing i can say about this camp is i definantly just go for the people. they have a natzi motif going on throughout the staff but there's some suffolk county regulations blah blah...whatever the kids are amazing. and i think i broke about every rule there was...minus the like bringing weapons to camp one. good effing times. shoutouts to the grads, it really won't be the same next year. i love you guys.

anyways, we're gunna go be badass. talk to you laterrrrr

"event","wow i havent written in a while. i have been so busy its just crazy. i caught up with my father which was cool. i found out that my big sis is engaged and im so happy for her. i did a lot a lot of back to school shoppin and there is still more that i want. lol im so spoiled. but anyway a lot has been going on. there is so much drama going on i just cant stand it. im like why i gotta go through all of this? i think that God is tryna show me something cuz its just to much happenin which is really similiar. im the school side doesnt really affect me. what has got me all mad is my own family talkin trash about me. it really hurts because even though they aint blood they really do some shady stuff and its not like i can dodge it or anything cuz im around all the time it is really disturbiing but i have to live with it."

PA lol. i cant reallly stand her and if some how she gets to read this oh well i said it. i mean we are cool and every thing but she gets around her father and likes to act as if he isnt my dad too. i mean he is my step dad but its cool because i actually am closer to him than she is so o well got bitch about it hater! but anyway  its weird cuz me and my mom were talking and i found out that i might have to get surgery on my toes. and im like well i wont be able to walk duh what am i going to do be in a wheel chair at school over some lame ass pinky toe no forget that. i was like yea right that doesnt make any sense. im like why do i get stuck being extremely talll with f---ed up toes? why me? but who cares i guess that is what socks are for."

"event","ok... all i have done for the last few days is just shop and shop some more. That is like the only good part about back to school time. ick i cant believe i just said back to school that sux really bad. i mean i cant believe lil ol Jerri the family baby is like almost 16 yrs old and is like a jr in high school its just crazy to me. but anyway... i actually spoke to my father for the first time in about 2 months its weird. like i love him to death cuz thats my dad but then he does shady stuff too. like how can you not tell your own child that you were moving and changing your number?! wtf! i was pissed man. then he tries to make it better by making promises to take me shopping. ok thats nice but still thats only going to work for so long. so idk im so torn. its like hard to be pissed off and happy at the same time its weird. but... i went and hit the club scene the other day. i had a crazy good time and i met this boy. he is really nice so we talked and out of no where we hook up. so i was like ok no big deal. so the next day  he calls me 4 times (i think i mentioned this already) haha but anyway i didnt get to talk to him so i try to call him and the whole thing is just weird so im like ok w/e if we dont talk its cool i can move on. little do i kno this other pest is calling me. now for those who dont kno he is the brother to a friend of mine. we like eachother but he is with this other girl. so as soon as i find out im like ok maybe we shouldnt talk anymore. ok he calls me like every day with a freakin attitude im like dude i dont have to put up w/ this crap cuz guess what im not your girl. so to make a long story a tad shorter... i'm so confused because some boys suck cuz they dont know how to act and they say and do stupid stuff and im just plain ol annoyed. i dont want to sound like i complain a lot but i just do cuz no one will listen. so oh well i type and by the way if some of this didnt make sense o well it just reflects my life"

"event","it was the best of times and the worst of times...
omg i cant believe i just quoted freakin a tale of two cities! but it is so true though. i mean last night was osm partying and stuff but then old remnants of a ""relationship"" come back to hit me in the butt. 
i mean me and this person arent together but then he clames ownership. so when i go to a party hes all acting like an ass askin if i got any numbers. you know what i say? hell yea cuz im a pimp! lol im just kidding im just so frustrated but its ok cuz this new boy marcus called me 4 times today so i'll just talk to him! haha that is the biggest middle finger i can give to this other boy who has just been one headache after another... so booyah!"

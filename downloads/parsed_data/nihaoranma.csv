"event","I guess Jabberwocky was what got me after all. I have always loved that poem, but since I didn't think I COULD memorize it I hid it in the back corner of my brain n' forgot about it. I know the whole thing now! (When it's too late to be of any practical use.) I must remember that there isn't a redo button!

"event","Lucky fer me that nobody reads this anymore. I was so freakin nerdy! And look at the layout! Holy crapola, what was I thinkin!? I'm gonna keep it 'cause it's a testament to my former self. The one that didn't like anything harsher than Green Day and could happily spend a day on her own with a book. Feckitall, I didn't think this year could suck as bad as last year, but it's definitely trying. 

I'm gonna translate my myspace post last night for my own benefit, so I'll know what the hell I was talking about when I don't speak Mollie anymore. 

""Sammit! Soggy puzzle pieces don't fit, and my blowdrier isn't working! Still don't have enuf pillowage, my cat hates my guts, and even the flowers pity me. Being invited into the light helps not a whit if your eyes won't adjust- but it'll work well enough if you're drunk cause your eyes are all freaked out anyways. It's not so simple as all that, either!""

That's the post. Translation:

I don't friggin fit anywhere anywhere, and none of the advice I've gotten helps me any. Also emoing out 'cause I didn't get to know Garett enuf before I agreed to go out withim, and that was about the most brilliant thing to do (since he's quaker, and he's got an itchy trigger finger as far as ""I love you!"" goes. I can't think of enuf good reasons why Kat would hate me, but she does and that's one hellova blow, and Hannah feels sorry for me so she invited me to her Hallo party last night. Spent most of it in the emo corner cause they only talk about stuff they did when I wasn't there, and I refuse to eavesdrop on people. That reminds me! I heard Ben tell the guys he sits around that he found the best Shakespearian insult ever, and I listened. It was a really good one too! But he heard me laughing, and said I eavesdrop alot. So I WON'T listen to  other people's convos. No mas! At least I'll have an excuse not to talk on monday, my throat hurts so bad right now! ... Crap! I hadn't thought about suck n' blow! (If anybody else reads this, that's a party game that involves a piece of paper.) I bet everybody's gonna get sick now. Dammit! I was so careful! ... Okay. I just won't go to anything anymore. I shouldn't have gone last night! Stupidstupidstupid! 

Aw crap. I'll finish the McEmopants monolougue later."

"event","I think I wrote a song last night. The lyrics anyway, I can't write music. 
Here are the lyrics:

This neverland has never 
been invaded before
so try not to smile 
when you kick down the door

'cause payback's a bitch
and pride's second cousin
you see two for one
I get a dime for every dozen
revenge may be sweet 
but the aftertaste is bitter
but you know I love chocolate
and I've never been a quitter

you better leave me sittin here
I couldn't thrill you to the core
the blaze'd leave you nothin 
but ashes on the floor
possessor is a title 
you could only pray to keep
you ain't in the cards no more:
Yeah baby, read em' and weep 

'cause payback's a bitch
and pride's second cousin
you see two for one
I get a dime for every dozen
revenge may be sweet 
but the aftertaste is bitter
but you know I love chocolate
and I've never been a quitter

~*~

It surprised me a lot, and they're pretty angry aren't they? A couple of the lines got stuck to my fingers while I was petting my cat, which is supposed to be a relaxing thing! And here came all these angry words! It was weird, and it really freaked me out, but they're also pretty good, aren't they? Now I need to find somebody to write the music for me... Maybe I'll take up guitar after all."

Stumbling around in the dark is rather pointless unless you know what you're looking for. So the best thing to do is sit back and wait for it to come to you, because you don't know what you're looking for until you find it.

Comfort is that soft place between asleep and awake where nothing is important enough to worry over. That's where relief lives, and the overwhelming calm it brings is what finally lets us sleep.

~~~

I could really use some calm right now- I'm gonna be stuck with my siblings all day today, and they're being way stupider than usual because Mom's letting them. FECK!!!"

"event","Or so says Trelawney. To... Lavender? Dang. The next book is coming out in about two weeks and I haven't read any of them since the last one came out. SADFACE!!! Ahnyvays, I wanted to put up sone of my more geniuser quotes from an IM chat with a buddy of mine, in which SBJL had a litle too much fun with metaphors n'stuff. 

~~~

Would that I could extol thy virtues endlessly,
but the time would trickle away and be lost to me, 
time that I could further spend with thee.

~~~

I'm actually your shoulder angel. <3 I'm the one who whispers sweet nothings and possible pickup lines in your ear while you sleep. The suck-e ones you never use but laugh at and never think of again. But I'll keep it up until you like at least one!

~~~

Being noticed is the best of all interactions. for when you are noticed, there is no longer anything to hide behind, so you better start your act before your time in the spotlight is gone.

~~~

I'm slipping down a steep path with a puddle at the bottom. I could jump into the bushes and be spared, caught on the thorns, or land in the water and be wet until I return home. The difference is a few scratches that will heal in a week or a case of bronchitis that will end my life in less than a month. But I don't know that, I'm just the fool out walkin on a rainy day.

~~~

Thus abandoned by a most crucial part of myself I can't function, I can't bring myself to lift my pen. Without my better self on my shoulder telling me what to say I'm uninspired, abandoned at my desk in my desolate field of dreams. Without a guide I'm easily lost, led astray by the short-lived and glowing threads that dangle from the trees. 

~~~

A smile is the simplest expression of happiness. It is a personal invitation to anyone who sees to join in and spread the sticky sweetness. but it's like a game of telephone how the meaning is often lost, turned into the incoherent psycobabble of people having fun, thus spreading it further and further like a drop of dye in a cup of water. It all turns blue eventually, but the purest happy feelings are too small to be spread to everyone. Hold on to the pure feeling and stock up against the flood, or it will all be washed away.

~~~

I made all of these up, and if you steal them I'll hunt you down and gut you like a fish! >:/"

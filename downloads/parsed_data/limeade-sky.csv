"event","<center>This is where it all begins
Where our first breath and the hot sharp feeling if LIFE starts.
This is being cruel, the world.
This is where there's no reason
And no explanation
No justification

Don't ask, don't anticipate, don't expect.

This is when the sky turns limeade sherbert.

This is where the questions stop and our own answers begin.

Self definition mandatory.
Lack of judgement requested.
Kind consideration appreciated.

"event","Well, not happy days for me.  I have physical problems that lend themselves very nicely to feeling anxious.  Ever feel like your safe haven, your home is closing in on you?  It feels like that when I get anxious, I have to be out in the open air.  I think it is called claustrophobia.  Who knew I had a little bit of claustrophobia in me?  Who knew I would suffer from an anxiety disorder.  Who knew I would break?  Who knew I would need so much help, who knew I would feel so horribly wrong?  Not me.

"event","Well well well, it has been ever so long.  I feel like my body has suffered a breakdown along with my mind.  I went out and did a full day today, it was too much.  My mind is tired, and my body is tired and that is the perfect setup for an anxiety attack.  I had low level anxiety at school today and an attack this evening after dinner as the little one was saying how much I didn't love him.  They are changing though, the feelings behind them are changing.  No longer is it abject fear, more of an extreme anxious sadness.  This is one hell of a journey I am on.  They go away much faster now as well.  I wonder what that all means?

I fight those feelings, I dont like them as I like to look outwards.  I want to see the world and interact with it, not get lost in my own mind.  It just reminds me of how seperate we all are from eachother.  Perhaps sex is a way where humans try to connect.  To connect on a deeper level then speech could ever do.  We are always trying to connect, well most of us, and the question remains, do we really?  Perhaps love is the ultimate connection.  Although I have seen love that was not returned, so what is the connection there?  Verrrry interesting.  No, I believe love does connect on a fundamental level.  I also think there is more to connection than just the physical on this plane of existence.  

Who connects with me?  lol  or should I say concurs

I am tired.  Hubby kept me up last night.  Wink Wink nudge nudge say no more say no more.  Which reminds me, there was a special on Monty Python last night, saw about half of it.  How monty python came into being and the rest, but I didn't see the rest.  Tis alright, will catch it another time...I hope. 
We are off to Jeniffeffers house today yayayayayayay.  Dropping the kids off at the parental units.  An adult day.  WOOOOOOOW  How often does that happen in my lifetime anymore.  In my tired stupor, I am excited about this.  We went to see Scooby Doo yesterday.  Emo sat through pretty much the whole thing and really enjoyed it.  A take note!  Emo did sit through most of it, enraptured, I was the one sitting beside him, not you.  He enjoyed it!  ach, nevermind, I am rambling from thoughts running through my brain at lightning speed.  Hold on, this might be a good time for poetry, lets see.....
I wish words, stuck in my mind
stayed with me a while, whispering thoughts into my head
waited to be caught up in my web of sentences.
I wish sounds, stayed a while in the air
looked around for an ear to listen to their soft hums 
came out of my mouth in jubilant beauty.
I wish all my thoughts could be written down
mulled over and looked right 
chased away, brought to my bosom to love.
I wish I had my words back"

Look at me, I am a saxaphone.  I always liked that instrument.  Well daddys day is approaching, tomorrow in fact.  Our daddy is going to have a nice day, dont have anything planned.  Thought we could wait on him if he so desired.  Lets see, been a long time since I wrote anything.  Everything is good, finally.  Nothing new, nothing exciting.  Tammy had her baby and now I have that damn maternal instinct to have another!!!   I think I am going to let it pass because adoption can be damned expensive.  Especially if we want to adopt from another country.  Both A and I have to travel to said country to do the adoption procedures.  Hmmmmm all seems too much trouble.  
flipperdeegibbit.  Fun word that.  Not much else to say.  Got a nice tan just hanging out with the kids at the park and such.  Yay.  Got lots of music for My birthday, that was lots of fun...Little shop, little shop of horrors....for some reason that song just popped into My head. ;) Happy birthday spice.  I have a birthday spanking for you, come and get it dear. *G*  Lots of birthdays, hey, spice, your a gemnini too?  Cool.  Going to My friends next weekend for a fun ""adult"" day out.  I am oh so looking forward to that.  
Met some women who live in the neighborhood and their kids.  Interesting lot.  One woman who lives in the townhouse complex across from us, who happens to own a doberman, she is an interesting piece of work.  Nice enough, but a little brash.  The Indian woman I met down the street has two beautiful children.  A boy with an award winning smile, 5 and a little gorgeously cute, two year old girl.  Well there go the maternal instincts again.  And if we did adopt I would want an Indian girl.  Well that would be a great excuse to go see India I guess.  But alas, I shall let this feeling ride.  I have other things I want to do with My life that I just want to get on with it.  School being one.  And other things.  Off I go to do breakie"

How do you tell a three year old yesterday it was warm enough to have a picnic, swimming, today it is to cold to go outside in pajama's.  Well it is cold and he is out there now.  Kids are smart I tell ya that much.  He came in and put his cold feets from the cold pool under the sheet, I put a blanket on him. LOL   I got the updated information for the MA I want from JFK university.  Oh man it would be like a dream come true!  It is everything I have ever wanted, right up to the studying a discipline like meditation or yoga everyday on ones own.  I love yoga, would love to get into it again.  However, I am not holding up high hopes about going.  Tis nice to have a dream though.  Sex show is on this weekend.  Hmmm make plans to go, now.  Gooooood idea. YAY.  Let ya know all about it on monday.  hehehehe  Kate came over yesterday for a quick tea and a quick chat.  Then we all went over there yesterday so My kids could play with her kids, was interesting.  She reminds Me of Sue, but not as ditzy front.  She warned Me about all the kids in her townhouse complex.  I did get a nasty feeling from them, so no more playing with the kids in there, too the park with us!!!   They are moving up north at the end of this month, so that is that for friends in this neighborhood, so far.  The woman next door, nice nice lady, but older.  We shall see, it has only been three months.  Jeeeeez.  Tomorrow, meeting spice always a nice treat.  Going to spend money, alwasy a nice treat.  Lunch at Kiva's.  All in all it is going to be a nice day.  If I remember correctly, supposed to be good weather as well.  hmmmmm I am formulating a plan in My head about sunday, this could work!  Laters"

I met someone I have not seen in ohhhh fourteen odd years.  I knew him in grade and high school, was never really good friends with him, but he was ok.  We spent a good three hours talking.  Mostly him talking about his life.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  We are going to get together with him and his ""friend"" (girl) sometime soon.  This should be interesting to talk to A. about.  He is almost a lawyer, but really good at what he does.  I would like him to write up our living wills.  He wont take money for it though, he doesn't like money.  He said a dinner will do.  lol  I think if this actually happens A.  will convince him to take something for his time.  From how I hear him talk, he is really good at what he does, and dedicated to helping his fellow man.  He is a reallly nice guy.  I hope his ""friend"" sees this sooner than later, cause there aint many like that around anymore.  I would like to hook him up with my dad so he can begin making money in a way that doesn't offend his sense of, hmmmm what did he say, principles.  He believes the law should be there for everyone, so he would probably be working for the poor.  I told him basically how to do that and still make money.  My dad is really the one to talk to about this, perhaps he will take me up on my offer.  That would be cool to be involved with, if even just to help him out.  I like dealing with worthwhile causes, and meeting old friends.  and making new ones all over again. :)  Very interesting day indeed!"

I dont write enough about the good things in My life.  That is because it is not cathartic to do so?  or is it because I am a depressed individual more often than I care to admit.  Now that I think about it, I see others writing about the happy times in their lives.  Perhaps I just dont find My happy times all that interesting compared to most.  Yes, definitely depressed.  Time to do something about it.  I love A. That is for sure.  He is My rock!  I can only see us growing closer as time goes on, as long as we (mostly I) keep the communication flowing freely.  Things are definitely looking up.  Wish I could feel that in My heart, but the time will come.  Interesting development, architectural landscaping.  Think I might go to community college to learn such a thing.  I just loved mowing the lawn way to much.  Want to work with the earth too.

Movie Review: SPIDERMAN
Ok it is hard for Me not to give a completely biased view, but what the hell  this is My journal so I can bias away.  I loved it.  It was great!!  Better than Batman, but I was never really that fond of batman.  A lot of comic book schtick, and the storyline stayed pretty true to the comic book.  I like that.  Gives the movie integrity when it is a movie from a comic book.  The best thing about the movie....when Peter Parker is in the Spiderman outfit fighting bad guys, he makes smart ass comments.  He is still just Peter Parker, not some super duper, ""I can save the world"" hero, just plain ole Petee fighting the bad guys.  Go Pete Go!!!!  Lots of good special effects, good casting, (I wonder if the green goblin was really willem defoe's voice, damn creepy!), Kirstun Dunst has amazing red hair.  Negatives?  Well some of the technical stuff was not very well done.  One thing that was not true to the comic book, he gains the ability to spin webs, where in the comic he had to make a device to spin webs, for various reasons this should have stayed true to the book.  All in all I had a great time watching it.  Main reason I liked it...a lot of character development, not a lot of fighting, although it had its share of that too.  Must see movie, if you like the idea of comic book movies."

"event","Hello again,  Well all the stress of this morning, which by the way was the fault of the pharmacy, because the doctor actually phoned in the prescription, but the pharmacy took the name down wrong, has made Me ill.  At least I am not stressed anymore lol.  Now I am just sick.  Got E has got his medicine.  He will be feeling better in a few days and hopefully so will I.  This is one kick ass anti bio, should do the job splendidly.  I am tired.  Now hubbys brother is coming for dinner, that should be an experience.  Get to listen to the two brothers talk about how their parents screwed them up.  Jeez, I am such a gossip monger.  lol   Not much else to say, laters"

I have everything I could want, a house, a good hubby, good kids, and I hate My life.  So this is what mid life crisis feels like.  I know what I need.  I need spirituality back in My life, but how do I go about getting it there?  Why is it so hard to get there, when I used to live there.  Fuck  I wish I knew how, I wish I could get there again."

Perhaps that is exactly what I need, a summer completely alone, well, never being completely alone, alone with My kids.  Perhaps that is just what I need.  So I think I will dye My hair a nice brown, take the nose ring off and the rings, and just try to blend in with casual, boring clothes and learn how to talk motherspeak and housewifeease.

Five and a half hours of sleep last night, interupted by a little one quiet a few times.  I dont feel it now, perhaps tonight, definitely tomorrow.  E is full blown sick now, staying home from school and L has something going on in his nose too.  Welcome to My life.  But thats ok, I will stay home today and take it easy, as easy as I can with both kids here.  I think I have to do a serious cleansing of bad feelings in this house, it seems they are lingering and I am feeling them, cause I haven't been truly content since we moved in.  I think the tele room is not good feng shui for starters.  I can't wait to get the couch, then I can really start making that room look good.  I want to move our bed upstairs too.  One should always sleep with head to the north and feet to the south, it aligns some sort of particles in the body.  I think it will do wonders for the look of the bedroom as well.  However, I cannot do it until the little one is out of our room, cause his bed wont fit beside ours without blocking the closet.  ach well.  Have to deal with all the wierd dreams for a while longer."

MOVIE REVIEW:  Do not, I mean NOT go see The Scorpian King!  Very little dialogue, lots and lots of fighting.  The thing I enjoyed about the fighting is the women fought and held their own.  I can get into that.  Dialogue sucked, but the rock was curiously good looking throughout most of it, must be the rugged hunka hunka, built like an ox, (wonder if he is hung like one?)  OH yeah, I just remembered who the rock is engaged to, cant remember her name though, big blonde sex thing.....Righhhht Pamela Anderson!  I wish them both all the luck in the world, (guffaw).  So, definite yuck rating, although lots of eye candy, both male and female.  So back at home, everything is the same, yeah.  Just trying to figure out what the difference is between My old home and this one.  I think I find the tele room much warmer in My old one.  I am finding that time goes faster in this house.  I wonder why?  I could stretch out, enjoy shows, relax in the old home.  Here doesn't feel quiet like that and then it is time to go to bed...boom!  Wierd, perhaps I just have to get the new couch and get used to this house, decorate, yaknow make it Mine.. Aha, hmmmm warm colors, that is what that room needs.  (wheels a turning)  Had chinese food for dinner, prefer sushi though, but E loves his wontons :)  Alright, lots more boring shit going through My mind that I will not write down.  Although it is time to start getting ready for L's b-day party.  A is going to make the invitations, lets see if he does it before he goes away.  Right now he is reading a book.

And I have to get working on finding a prof and a subject for My undergrad thesis next year.  So, busy it is.  Great!  I like busy, rather then bored.  But I have a few books to keep Me occupied in the interim.  I wonder why it is that I have so much to say and I get on here and it all just magically goes away.  Wonder if any of the oh two people who actually read this could guess why?  I know *g*  but anyhoot, not much on the plate for this weekend....no really?  Who's going to see spider man!?!?!?  I want to go the sunday after it opens.  I wonder if I could get tickets way in advance as I am sure it will sell out everywhere the first weekend.  Gonna take E to see it, I am soooooo excited!

Now this is going to sound corny, but if one looks at it in a very real way, it was disturbing.  L was possessed by someone who was dead but I had known and this person was pure evil.  So L was trying to kill Me, I think.  He was strong, but not strong enough so I just kept fending him off and trying to talk to the spirit to leave him.  I awoke with a very foreboding feeling.  That was at five, then at five forty five the thunderstorm came in.  It was great, woke Me and E up, however, I couldn't get back to sleep after.  I couldnt really enjoy the tstorm either because I still had that foreboding feeling.  Well, all better now.  Looks like A will be staying in town next week.  Seems like spice and I are never destined to get together, but ya know, it is a wonderful test of patience for both of us.  God must be a Dom/me."

Yesterday was fun, going downtown to walk Queen street with spice.  She is so funny, saying I am in her part of the town now.  I had to remind her that it was My haunt before she ever laid eyes on it.  Hmmmm think that dates Me?  Yeah, I am not young anymore, but of course, I dont care.  I feel young at heart, that I do.  Stay young forever, thats what I say.  But hold to your responsibilities, I guess it is a balancing act, hmmmm.  Perhaps that is what life is about, balancing...balancing the budget, balancing relationships, balancing lifestyles, balancing who we are and who we want to be.  To quote Buddha, ""the middle road is the best""  Keep everything in balance.  On that note, been out for a couple days, now time to clean house....and the cat.  Since we let him out back, his fur is yuuuuucky.  Time for a brushin of those two critters."

"event","Here is a thought....  Fact: energy can neither be created or destroyed.  So when one emotes, they give off energy, of anger, or love, there is an energy there.  So, we can make the leap that emotion carries a certain energy.  Therefore if there is an emotion that one is trying to not feel, then the energy of that emotion stays with the person, because it cannot be felt.  This is the thought of many a guru and spiritual people.  Well, I cant shake this angry feeling.  It just creeps up and lashes out.  Perhaps it is circumstance, I am going on three weeks hardly leaving My house, being sick and taking care of sick people.  Perhaps it is from times past as well, when things have made Me angry but I have not had a chance to express the anger, but have held it back, which is basically what I have to do now...no choice.  All I know is, I feel very trapped, and that is making Me angry.  Perhaps it is also due to the fact that I am here sick, taking care of two kids and A is out having dinner with his boss at a five star restaurant until ten at night.  I know he had no choice, but it is still getting to Me, big time."

I guess there are worse places I could be a prisoner of than this house.  Ok, movie review time.  Hedwig and the angry inch.  Very unique if you go for the transexual with a twist, good, really good music musical.  Sounds like another movie I can think of, but alas, nothing like it.  It ends up being about one persons becoming whole.  Very interesting..must get soundtrack.  Dont say a word, about a  psychiatrist who has to get a number out of one of his patients heads, because his daughter was kidnapped.  Predictable, however, I enjoyed the young girls performance.    Princess and the Warrior.  A german film, subtitles.  She works in a mental institution, he is an extremely troubled man.  He saves her life, she goes searching for him and ends up saving him...but I wont tell you how.  Must see movie!  The germans are coming out with a lot of worthwhile films these days, kudo's.

"event","I had the most wonderful dream last night.  I dreamt I was in a school, not unlike the Marketplace.  However this one was bigger and had a lot more ppl.  There was more to the dream before this took place, but this is what I remember most.  I am new, and we had to get ready for dinner.  I couldn't find my clothes and then the shorts were too big.  Let me describe the dinner attire for slaves, as I was training to be one...black very short shorts in nylon and a black mesh shirt that showed off my tits beautiffully.  Anyway I took far too long and the HeadMaster punished me by making me lie on the floor on my stomach face down.  Let me describe this feeling I had while I was there, submitting completely to this man...""this is home, this is exactly where I am meant to be, this feels damn good and damn right""  Back at my room I begged him to let me eat cause everyone else had finished, he said yes.  I went downstairs and one of the servants said the gym was that way but I said I was going to the kitchen, so she pointed the way.  There were other ppl sitting at a table, definitely not slaves.  They beckoned me over there and I sat with them, they gave me all kinds of desserts and I started to say no I need real food and then thought better off it.  One person offered me something and I took a handful and started eating unti l realized as one of them took one from my hand, that I am still the slave and should be offering these to all of them first and then I can eat what is left.  I started offering them around the table to each person and again I got that, this is where I belong feeling.  I woke with that wonderful feeling in the pit of my stomach.  That is where I belong.
Well just had to write that most wonderful dream out.  Yay
I think I am doing better this morning.  A and I chatted last night and got some things sorted out.  Had a scene but I really wasn't into it.  Did it anyway, and then that glorious dream.  Now if I could live in a dreamworld like that every night, I would be one happy camper!

L is on day six with a fever that averages 102.  Looks like E has the same flu, or whatever the hell it is.  I am starting a cold, I think because I am run down and stressed and just plain insane these days.  Would help if I had some emotional support, but alas I have found there is little support for those who continually support others.  Might be that I have a big problem asking friends and loved ones for support.  That does not help certainly.  I am trying to just put it all aside and work on My presentation.  It is going soooo slow cause I have the two kids now as well.  Although E. is pretty good just watching tele and all.  The little one wants lots of attention, but that is the way of little ones.  Anyway, back to the presentation on euthanasia and assisted suicide.  
Sometimes I think that it is morbid, but most of the time, I just find it fascinating.  Hey spice... is it just us or is it a jewish thing to be fascinated with death?  Helps to believe in reincarnation, as I do.  I am thinking, there is so much here that perhaps I will do My undergrad thesis on this topic.  Tis an idea.

"event","From the moment Adam said Igal wanted to look for a new roommate my mind wandered into the possibility of us living together. All weekend I thought about it. How it just makes sense because I spend most of my nights with him anyway. I leave toiletries, food, a few creature comforts in his apartment for when I come back after a night or two of staying at home. How we both know each other's bad habits and are still fully functional, even though he farts all the time and I forget to do little things, like close the blinds when I leave. How I've asked every person I know who seems trustworthy enough to live with, but they've given me the runaround when I tried to put plans to move in with them into motion.

I have a full-time job, he has his entrepreneurship and connections to always have a job. We both trust each other with our valuables and in moral issues (if we broke up, I would always be able to go back to Stephanie's, but I would certainly pay my share of the rent for the remainder of the lease). It all seems like it would work. 

This morning he told me Igal drunk dialed him the other night, saying how he still wanted to live with Adam, but found that Adam not keeping kosher was a problem. Remembering all I pondered over the weekend, I slyly pointed out that he should ask me if I wanted to live with him. I ticked points off my list one by one, even stating that maybe a two bedroom apartment wouldn't be a bad idea. One of the biggest things we value in our relationship is having personal space, even though we spend the majority of our time together. A two bedroom apartment would allow us to have separate bedrooms and sleep together when we want. Or we could share a bedroom and turn the second bedroom into a shared space, like a study, where we could just go to have time apart and engage in our own lives. He thinks two bedrooms is pointless because we would be paying for an extra room for no reason, and I guess he's right. If space was necessary, one of us could go to the living room, the other to the bedroom. 

Surprisingly, he didn't oppose the idea outright like I expected. He listened calmly to my reasons and said he was thinking about it himself. This could be a huge step in the right direction for us, and for me personally. I don't know if I can handle living with Stephanie and Zack any longer. They're great and I love how they look out for me, but they live so far. I spend more money on gas than I should. Plus they'll try to start a family soon. My life would be awkward if I still stayed there for that.

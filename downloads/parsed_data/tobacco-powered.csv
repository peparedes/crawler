<b>Series:</b> DOGS: Bullets & Carnage
<b>Character: </b> Badou Nails
<b>Gender: </b> Male
<b>Sexuality:</b> I'd say he's largely heterosexual, but unless he's got a secret love affair we're not aware of, he's yet to express much interest either way.

<b>Appearance:</b> Two things generally strike people first when they see Badou: his long, red-orange hair and the black patch that goes over his right eye. Presumably, he lost the eye at the same time he gained the scar that mars his right hand, and whatever effects that these injuries may have had on his physical capabilities, he's adapted to them.

Badou is a lanky, wiry sort of fellow, all legs and arms. He is perpetually surrounded by a haze of smoke coming from a perpetual cigarette (unless he runs out, which happens more often than he likes), and keeps a pair of MAC-10 submachine guns with him whenever he needs them. Although he also seems fairly taken with coveralls, his typical get-up usually comprises jeans and a t-shirt with the occasional jacket.

<b>Personality:</b> Foul-mouthed, clumsy, and a bit of wuss (though he'd clock you if you said it to his face), Badou's got all the tact of an unwieldy hammer -- a trait that perhaps gets him into trouble more often than he'd like. Still, he survives. His life ain't great, but he's only got the one, and damn if he isn't going to fight to keep it.

One way he does this is by running the fuck away from anything that is apt to ""artificially shorten"" his lifespan (which is a little ironic, given his nicotine addiction). It is rather unfortunate that a lot of the time, he winds up in situations that put him under direct fire from people who would prefer him dead. When this happens, Badou <i>is</i> largely capable of taking care of himself, but he is not above begging shamelessly for help. Or, as is more likely, for a smoke.

Badou is, as many people in his line of work are, a bit of a cynic. He's more likely than not to believe the worst about people; he's seen too much shit go down while working -- either alone or with Heine -- to truly have faith in the goodness of humanity. At the end of the day, though, he's not a bad guy. He may not be <i>nice</i>, and he certainly has no qualms with going in with guns blazing should the situation call for it, but he cares about the people close to him (if only in a way that he'd rather poke out his other eye than admit to it).

While Badou's past doesn't necessarily haunt him in the o-noes-emoz and recurring-nightmares sense, he does think about it fairly often. Even if he could forget about the fact that he's missing an eye, the scar on his hand is a constant reminder of his allegedly dead brother and the shit that went down with him, all those years ago. Badou tends to say he's better off without his brother anyway, but how much of that is truth and how much of that is a coping mechanism remains to be seen. 

<b>Abilities/Strengths:</b> A key feature of Badou's character is the fact that he turns into a trigger-happy nutbar whenever he's deprived of smokes. In this state, he's a much more formidable opponent than he would be normally and is able to face off against entire mobs of enemies without breaking a sweat.

Otherwise? Well. He can run very, very quickly. He is quite proficient with his guns when he needs to be (read: when he isn't running away), and working as a private investigator has also given him a certain level of sleuthing ability, though he is not by any means the cream of the crop. He is also very good at housework, given that he had to make up for his older brother being hopeless at it, and can sew/patch together clothing and presumably cook and clean.

Personality-wise, Badou is a decent dude to hang out with if you can deal with his abrasiveness. He's funny, if loud and often rude, and he's up for socializing if it's with people he likes. As he also works in a food/convenience store, presumably for extra pocket money, he can at least do a passable attempt at the necessary cashier politesse required to deal with customers.

<b>Weaknesses:</b> Badou is, as previously stated, a bit of a wuss. While not completely incapable of saving his own ass, sticky situations often find him tied up/beat up/fleeing while someone else (usually Heine) is shooting the bad guys in the face. He is also not exactly what you would call graceful or clever in any way, and his screw-ups can generally be attributed to either his stupidity or his clumsiness.

Badou lacks tact in a kind of epic way, and he will swear at and insult people with nary a second thought. Except in the most extreme/rare cases (like when a friend's loved one has died), he rarely takes other people's feelings into account, which results in a decided lack of sympathy or empathy for anyone else's situation.

Badou is also <i>addicted</i> to smoking. It goes far, far beyond your average garden-variety nicotine addiction; he literally needs cigarettes to keep him sane. He will whine and beg until he gets his smokes, and although nobody has used this against him just yet, there always exists the possibility.

<b>History:</b> Information on Badou's early history is a bit scant, but we do know he lived with (and picked up his smoking habit from) his older brother, who was a freelance journalist. It would be a fair bet to say that their parents were dead or otherwise completely absent from their lives, as Badou had to learn how to sew and cook and do other everyday things growing up because his brother kind of failed at that sort of thing. At some point, Badou's brother started investigating the mysterious disappearances of young children and hit upon information about a place even lower than the underground.

That's when he disappeared, too.

Badou started an investigation of his own, going deeper and deeper until he paid the price of getting too close to the truth -- he lost his right eye.

The exact details of this period of his life are unknown for the time being, but after he recovered, presumably he found work at the food/convenience store and did commissions as a private investigator. Eventually, he met a man named Heine Rammsteiner and they partnered up, doing jobs for a strange priest named Bishop and a genetically altered cat-lady named Liza, among others. Heine also ended up dragging Badou with him in order to rescue Nill, and although Badou had neither a clue what was going on nor any investment in Nill's safety (he didn't even know she existed), it was kind of hard to say no to a guy who had just literally dragged him here by the hair and stole all his smokes, and could also probably eat him in his sleep.

Sometime later, as Heine and Badou headed to Granny Liza's to receive information on another job, a girl named Naoto Fuyumine came along with them. She also accompanied them on the mission itself, although she stayed slightly set apart. Badou didn't really notice; he was too busy trying to keep from getting shot up by a bunch of lunatic gang members with guns. At some point, Badou ran out of cigarettes and went a little nuts himself, and then they were all attacked by a pair of killer twin girls, Luki and Noki. (Badou's life, so hard.) After intense injuries on both sides, the twins were called away, leaving Badou to drag Heine and Naoto's sorry asses up from the ground so they could head back to the church.

Once there, they found Bishop to be mysteriously gone, and Badou asked (in his characteristically rough manner) Heine to talk about his past in the underground ""kindergarten"" -- which Badou then said sounded like a bad comic book story, because he is a bit of a dick. But a dick who sews! As demonstrated when he easily sewed the button that had come loose from Naoto's shirt back on, much to everybody else's shock and amusement.

Then a sudden explosion shook the city, and Heine and Naoto immediately ran off and Nill hid under a table, and Badou was confused. Eventually, they came back, accompanied by Mihai and Liza and Bishop. Nill stayed with Naoto, who had fainted, Bishop and Heine went off somewhere, and Badou was told by Liza that she wanted to hire him for a job..."

Josh and I found a house and we bought it so it should be closing January 6th, I'm so excited.  It's a four bedroom house so his mom is going to move in with us for a little bit to help pay the mortgage so three rooms will be occupied which leaves a guest room which means if anyone wants to come up and visit I have room.  I'll be home for Christmas, I'm so happy, I can't wait to go home, we should all hang out I'll call and let you guys know when I'm down.  I love and miss everyone, see ya soon."

"event","Thought I might update.  I've been here a little over a week and I'm starting to adjust I guess.  I miss home, I miss my family and s much as my sister and I used to argue I miss her so much.  I miss being abke ti talk to my mom without having to pick up the phone and call and I miss hanging out with my dad.  As hard as it was taking care of a newborn and a toddler I really miss watching my niece every week while my brother was at work, I miss my brothers cheesey jokes and him trying to stall as much as he could before he went to work but trying to get out of the house before he got caught going to work late by my mom.

I hate that everything here is in a casino it makes it hard to do things when you have to be 21 to do anything, it's even worse since I'm the youngest adult here and everyone has to work around my age.

I started working with Joshs sister in the office of his dads company.  I don't recomend working for family, especially your in laws.  It's hard to go off and just quit when you have to see that person again.  The first day he raised his voice at me because he said I didn't get anything done, it didn't help that Josh didn't stand up for me he just egged his dad on.  I refuse to cry in front of them so I went in the room where my baby was.  It's not my fault I don't know what the hell I'm doing I just started, not to mention they were being audited so it's not like Christina had time to teach me anything she was getting ready for the audit.  He told me he didn't know what he was paying me for and that part time to me must mean sitting around all day.  I wanted to say 'Fuck you then don't pay me' and just leave but it's my father in law and I don't think that would go over too well.  Things are getting better though.

Well I guess I better go now, I wish I could say things were going absolutely great but what ever goes the way you expect it too anyway?  I'm glad everyone is doing so well, I wish I was there with everyone, I wish I had stayed in touch with people more."

I'm happy that we are finally moving on with our life together as a family but at the same time I'm leaving the one place I've lived pretty much my whole life and all of my friends.  Sure I know I'll be back to visit but it's not the same...I can't just call someone up to go and hang out anymore, not like I really took advantage of that like I probably should have, but still I knew I could if I wantd to.  I don't know it's just going to be hard to say good-bye, especially to my parents, they have been there for me through everything and I'm going to miss being able to talk to them and hang out with them and go and do stuff with them whenever, now we're going to have to make plans to set aside time so we can come and visit.  I've known we were going to leave for a while now but I guess it didn't really hit me until now since it's so close.  I just feel like I am going to be missing out on so much.  It's my sisters senior year and I'm going to miss all of her volleyball and water polo games and her swim meets and I'm not going to be here for her prom or anything.  And my niece, she loves her baby cousin and it's so cute to see her run to his rescue when he starts crying, she's going to be lost when she comes over and there's no more baby.  I dunno I guess I just wish I had more time."

"event","Okay so here's the story:
Wednesday night after dinner my mom looked at my feet, which looked like elephants feet because they were so swollen, and told me that I needed to go to the hospital and get checked out because it wasn't normal for them to be that swollen so me Josh my mom and my mother in law threw some stuff together just in case and went to the hospital.  When I got there they checked me out and to my suprise, and the doctors because I wasn't in any pain, I was 4.75 cm dialated so they decided they were going to admit me.  About an hour later they came in and said they were going to break my water and get things started so they did that and started to give me some medicine to make my contractions harder and more consistent.  A couple hours later I was pushing and next thing you know there's a baby.  All together it was about 9 hours I think.  The labor went exactly how I had wanted it to pretty much, I didn't have any pain medication and the pain wasn't even that bad and the baby was healthy.  After labor I was so exhausted and after looking at the pictures I was extremely swollen, turns out I had pretty much retained all the fluids they had given me so I looked like balloon.  I couldn't move without getting light headed and dizzy and they found out after a couple of blood tests that my blood count was way below what it is supposed to be so Friday night I had a blood transfusion, it's amazing what a little bit of blood will do for you.  After a couple more blood tests and a few days of close observation they let me come home Monday afternoon and now I am good."

"event","THE ROSE 
The first day of school our professor introduced himself and challenged us to get to know someone we didn't already know. I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder.

I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being. She said, ""Hi handsome. My name is Rose.

I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?""

I laughed and enthusiastically responded, ""Of course you may!"" and she gave me a giant squeeze.

""Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?"" I asked. She jokingly replied, ""I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, and have a couple of kids...""

""No seriously,"" I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age.

""I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!"" she told me.

After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake.

We became instant friends. Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop. I was always mesmerized listening to this ""time machine"" as she shared her wisdom and experience with me.

Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went.

She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up.

At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet.

I'll never forget what she taught us. She was introduced and stepped up to the podium. As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped her three by five cards on the floor.

Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said, ""I'm sorry I'm so jittery. I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know.""

As we laughed she cleared her throat and began, ""We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing.

There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die.

We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it!

There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up.

If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and stay in bed for a year and never do anything I will turn eighty-eight.

Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding opportunity in change. Have no regrets.

The elderly usually don't have regrets for what we did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets.""

She concluded her speech by courageously singing ""The Rose.""

She challenged each of us to study the lyrics and live them out in our daily lives.

At the year's end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago

One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep.

Over two thousand college students attended her funeral in tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.

REMEMBER, GROWING OLDER IS MANDATORY. GROWING UP IS OPTIONAL We make a Living by what we get, We make a Life by what we give.

God promises a safe landing, not a calm passage. If God brings you to it, He will bring you through it.

""Good friends are like stars ... You don't always see them, but you know they are always there."

Well my sister decided that she wanted to talk to her friend in another car so she reached al the way over, she was driving, and rolled down the window but since it doesn't roll down she had to grab it to help it along well it wasn't even on the track and it fell into the door, so now my window is broken thanks to my sister who I must say is never using my car again.  Not only did she break it but Josh isn't even here to work on it and it's getting dark and my dad isn't sure if he can fix it.

"event","Okay I'm super emotional right now because my hormones are all retarded but it doesn't help that Josh is going to be gone until the 26th and he's not going to be here tomorrow when I go in for my ultrasound and find out what we are going to have.  He called me today, but of course only after he told me he was drinking and I told him I didn't want him to call me drunk, then we only talked for about 6 minutes when he of course decided he had to go because hanging out and drinking with his friends was of course more important than talking to me at the time.  I know it's hard for him to be gone for three weeks but it's not exactly easy for me either and it's not like I can just go out and have a couple of drinks like he can, I wish he would try and understand that, but instead he's somewhere in Seal Beach getting drunk with his buddies."

"event","So my brother finally had an appointment with a lawyer and she told him that with everything that has happened he has a definite chance of getting full custody of Alex.  I'm happy he's finally getting stuff done and I hope he gets full custody of her that way I never have to see or hear that crzy wife of his ever again.  If there was ever anyone I hated, like could care less if I never heard or saw them again it would be her."

"event","Well I don't think we'll be moving into military housing because you have to have at least 6 months left in the military and well Josh doesn't and he's not going to be staying in so now I'm trying to find an apartment that's pretty cheap so we can at least move out of here.  And since Josh isn't going to be staying in that means at the end of August after I have my baby we will be moving to Reno...so I'll keep everyone posted on what's going on.  I go in for my ultrasound April 6th so hopefully I'll find out what I'm having."

"event","Okay so I called the housing office today to renew our application and I asked if the guy new how long it was going to take.  I actually talked to someone who knew what they were doing.  He pulled the information up on the computer and told me that one person had already accepted a house so I'm really like number four and another person can't move in until august and two more houses are about to open up so we should be the next people to get called and we should get a house by next month.  So I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that he is right and I can move out next month."

"event","I had a doctors appointment yesterday, we got to hear the babys heartbeat and then our doctor got an ultrasound machine and we got to actually see it.  I was so excited, so was Josh, it's crazy how something, a person, can grow inside of you.  It was really active because I had just eaten and it was kicking the ultrasound thing.  I have pictures but my scanner isn't working right now so when my dad gets it working I'll post them.  It was an ""unofficial"" ultrasound so we didn't find out what the sex is or anything, we'll find that out next month.  I can't wait, i'm so excited..."

"event","It's so sad how much of a push over my brother is.  He's so unhappy yet he lets people talk him into staying with Justina just a little longer and try to work things out.  Today they actually got as far as starting the paperwork which of course pissed her off so when she went to work today she of course got ""mauled"" by a cat that hadn't been vaccinated yet and my brother missed yet another day of work to take her to the ER.  So of course now they're trying to talk things out, that is until she gets mad for some reason and he gets tired of her again.  It's such bullshit, my brother is so easily controlled by everyone, for once I wish he would learn how to do what he wants and not what everyone else tells him he should do."

Josh is up for orders, I think one of the choices is Italy...it would be cool to go there and live for a little bit, and it's shore duty so he wouldn't be on ship so he would be home so we could go and explore.  I don't know what he wants to do yet, I'll keep everyone updated though.

Right now I'm trying to go through all of my old crap and throw stuff that I don't need away...I already have 2 trash bags full of shit."

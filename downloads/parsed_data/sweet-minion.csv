"event","Back again. *sigh* Not everything went as I thought it would.
The last 4 days were simply amazing. Maybe a bit shallow though ... no museums or sightseeing at all ... none. This citytrip consisted of shopping, musicals, good food and funny coincidences. I only took 2 pictures, that's it.

<lj user=""mariquitahelena"">: stop reading here so I can tell you in person!!

<lj-cut text=""these days in London"">

After we put our suitcases into the hotel room, on monday, we sat out to drive to the Westfield Shopping Centre where I tried first and mostly to get the new John Barrowman book. I failed. Quote by shop assistant ""we only get it before the signing which is on sept. 30th"". Well, that proofed to be a lie come thursday, but more later. 
What I did buy that day was 'Mika: The Boy Who Knew Too Much', 'State of Play' with John Simm, 'In Bruges', some stuff from L'Occitane, quite a bit in Boots & Superdrug, Next is an awesome shop too!
Then we went back to our hotel to put the stuff away and made our way to the Gielgud Theatre to get our tickets and opted in for some Yo!Sushi. Then we still had some time left till the show began so we decided a visit at GAP is due, oh well, evil shop where i always leave money.
Avenue Q was, as always, funny and oh so true to life. (Plus Daniel Boys as a treat)
Also: Brian May (from Queen, for those who don't know) sat in the audience about 4 rows in front of us.

Tuesday we spent on and around Oxford street. Shopping. Back on our way to the hotel we grabbed a Pret sandwich as dinner. In the evening I even put my feet in (very low) heels and we went to La Cage Aux Folles.
We managed to get lost on our way, and that made us come around the theatre from the other side as we had originally planed. Never mind though because while we walked by the stage door John Barrowman was on his way out. He did look a bit stressed and there were some fans who immediately compassed him and because neither Doris nor I  are that kind of fans we just went our ways and got the tickets we booked (in the middle of the front row at the first balcony - you think Zaza is looking at you while 'I Am What I Am').
I don't even know where to begin, I probably can only tell you in person. Two things I can say is: Simon Burke is one of the best singers I've ever had the chance hearing live, and the musical is good enough to see a few times.

We decided to go to Leicester Square and tried to get tickets for La Cage Aux Folles on wednesday. We succeeded and got tikets for the back of the stalls (30pounds instead of 54). After that: more shopping (boring, I know) in Westfield and this time I got the book, they were just to lazy to unpack the cartons, I guess, on monday. 
La Cage aux Folles in the evening. Allthough this time we had the worst possible ppl sitting next to us. An couple about the age of my parents, with there son and his girlfriend. They (the parents) put their feet on the seats in front of them, babyboy did the same because if mum can do this surely he is allowed to, the father (he sat next to me) couldn't keep his legs still and the whole row of seats kept moving (not even in time with the music!), and the mum SANG ALONG TO 'I Am What I Am' (well until i leant over and threw her an angry look) and in the intermission she yelled so loud I thought my ear-drum was going to pop out (OMGWTFBBQ she got a sms!!!!! AAAAHHHH).
Three things that are different about a theatre in GB to one in Austria: You wouldn't be allowed to eat ice or drink coffee in the auditorium, someone who puts their dirty shoes onto the seats would be thrown out and: we do have encores. In London, the last song ends, the curtain fall, the actors come out to give their bow, they go back behind the stage, the light comes on and everybody rushes out. Aside from a handfull of ppl like us two who wait until the live music stops playing and gives them an applause too because they were amazing and have to play cramped into the boxes because there is no orchestra pit.

On thursday we only woke up about 9.30am, had a lazy breakfast at Pret and then went to do some shopping at Sainsbury (Hobnobs, Jelly Babies, Shortbread & Cadbury chocolate). Followed by packing the suitcase and shlepping it to and down to the tubestation, driving to the airport, going to Yo!Sushi once more and then home again."

<b>Sunday</b>: I arrived in Heathrow, met up with <lj user=""moreslash4me""> and took the tube to Earls Court from where we went to our hotel (base2stay.com) which was really nice! Decided to go out and look for dinner and eventually settled for chinese at 'Dragon Palace'

<b>Monday</b>: Got up and went to Westfield, had breakfast at starbucks and than SHOPPED. we've been to Yo! there to. Later we made our way to the Royal Albert Hall to the John Barrowman concert. SO MUCH FUN. 
Playlist of the few YT videos from the day http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=75CDD8AA0C9CC405
We even went to the stagedoor where we waited quite some time, but it was kind of fun. First his parents came out, than Scott (who was handed a gift by a fan and had to sign somethin) and after that John who didn't have time to sign anything (and looked a wee bit tired - no suprise there)

<b>Tuesday</b>: Bit of sightseeing at the Tower and a journey with the riverboat to the London Eye from where we decided to go to the Sir Soane museum (where every first tuesday each month it is candlelit in the evening just like Sir Soane opened his house to Students) with a stopover at Leicester Square to grab a quick sandwich at Pret.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Soane%27s_Museum
It is very very weird, lovely, stange and overwhelming. After they've finished renovating it I plan to go there again and book a guided tour beauca 1) not everything is open to the public atm and 2) i think there are quite a few stories behind the exhibits.
Later that evening we went for Fish & Chips at the Earl's Court Tavern which was quite good.

<b>Wednesday</b>:  GAP @ Oxford Street, Illamasqua @ Selfridges, afternoon tea @ the Orangery in Kensington Palace (sweet, sweet and SWEET ;) quite nice and an other 'typical' british thing marked as done. The evening was amazing as we went to see La Clique at the London Hippodrome. Unbelievable artist! I especially liked The English Gents: 
<lj-embed id=""33""/>

<b>Thursday:</b> the day was quite a bit uneventfull as the only thing i did was go to tkts for my avenue q ticket and with <lj user=""moreslash4me""> to the Apollo Victioria Theatre to get her ticket to wicked, where we took the chance to go to the victoria place shopping center to get a bagle each and do some shopping for tea at Whittard's. After that <lj user=""moreslash4me""> decided to go see St. Pauls Cathedral which didn't interest me that much so I tried to hunt down sampoerna mild but failed, so I got back to the Hotel to bring back my shopping and went out again to Boots and Starbucks. In the evening i went to see Avenue Q (for the third time since 2007 btw) at it's new home at the Gielgud Theatre near Piccadilly Circus. (catchphrase: feel good at the gielgud) and really enjoyed it! Daniel Boys was fantastic, as was the rest of the cast. My favourite musical ever. (i am not a huge musical fan but i can safely say Avenue Q brought me into it a bit more)

<b>Friday</b>: :(((((( Starbucks and then off to Heathrow where I waited a bit with <lj user=""moreslash4me""> at teminal 5 and then took the Heathrow express to terminal 3 where i checked in, droped off my bag and went to kill some time waiting for my flight.

So that was my week at London. I am missing it allready. And am planning to go back later this year to see John Barrowman in La Cage aux Folles.

Now I'll take a look at the pictures and videos I made and with a bit of luck I will edit and upload everything too and post that too."

"event","self made, tasty caramely-honey-candy are amazing and are also very good for a sore throat (honey!)
do yourself the favour and and buy some cold-centrifuged-honey from either a apiarist or some bio-shop and not the stuff you get in the supermarket. because with industrial produced honey you loose a lot of the positive effects of honey.

by the way, Honigzuckerl is the austrian name for those things, ""honig"" = honey; ""zuckerl"" = candy

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>recipe</b></div> 

250 grams sugar
60 grams butter
1 tabelspoon honey

put everythin in a pot (use one <i>without</i> teflon-coating) and cook it till it gets smooth and a golden yellow/light brown colour
take a baking tray put some water on it and spill the suger mass on it
let it cool down a bit and use a knife to put some ""lines"" so you get some predetermined breaking points ;)
let it cool down more till you can break it into pieces (if you can't get it off the baking tray anymore because its too cold, run some hot water over the underside of the tray)
you are almost done, you got the pretty looking but very sticky honey-caramel-bonbons (Honigzuckerl!) and the will get stuck together, so get some powdered suger
put it in a plastic container (like tupperware) and put the Honigzuckerl in there too, close it up, shake it, open it, and voila - done!

for those who need the warning: while cooking the mass - stirring is very important - you don't really want to know what it is like to get boiling suger on your hands because a bubble exploded! (at least I don't want to know)"

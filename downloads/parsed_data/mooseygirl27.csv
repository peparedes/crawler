those always hurt the most.
who knows what will happen.

I got my Invader Zim DVD and was watching that... and I got to see Steph... and at work my friend Braxton helped me out... and then I saw Chop Stix and Richard and they liked my glasses, and Chop Stix said they were fabulous... which made me kinda scared... and then I found out this guy, Alex, plays hack and we were talking about that, and then he gave me candy... and then when I was cleaning up at work the kitchen flooded.. it was pretty funny.. hehe.. and then I was off early and me and Joe played two games of pool in which he won... and then I came home and watched Zim some more and then I got on the comp and chatted with this awesome guy...

I actually talked to them... usually someone else is with me and they talk to them more... but yeah... I also got my glasses... I'm feeling really dizzy and headache-ish... but that's oky.. they look awesome.. I still have to take a pic to post... When my dad saw me in them he thought I looked like a geek.. it made me feel bad.. but that's oky... I think I'm going to go now... yeah... I should try to actually sleep...

I wasn't there at the time, but that's what claire said... it kinda freaked me out.. and the entire time dana was trying to catch me of gard and spank my butt.. it was a little scarring... I feel sorry for nick and peter.. those poor little kids.. I think we might've menataly scarred them... but oh well.. yeah.. and stephanie kept flashing everyone and we played at the big park and steph and me went wading in the the creek that's made up of glacieral water.. it was cold!... and we kept burning stuff and the smoke of the fire smelt like puke and we hung out on the roof until the cops came... but it was a lot of fun... Its crazy though, up here I'd see someone and think to myself ""I WILL be friends with that person"" and then I eventually become friends with them.. its cool.. I bring that up cuz dana wasn't my friend before last night... I knew who she was, but I never met her... and I had wanted to be her friend since she's danny's fiance and danny was my friend.... so now I'm like ""Yay"" haha.. but yeah...

I'm so excited, dude... it shall be awesome... so everyone's going to come over and we're going to ""rock concert"" ourselfs.. and basicly I'm to only one who knows what they're doing... but that's oky... but yeah... I think this Friday I might have a party to celebrate the end of school... it shall be fun... we're probably going to go into the woods by my house and just have a bonfire... but then me and stephanie are going to randomly jump into to the creek (which is full of glacier water, so it'll be damn cold)... my friend says it sounds like a stoner party and that all we need it a bag of weed and stuff to burn... lol.. so yeah... well.. I should be off now.. .nothing too much more... well, I did just get back from seeing Harry Potter... sorta disappointing... but still... what can you say?.."

"event","So much has happened since my last update... I don't know where to start... mmm... well all the senoirs left and they made us ""official"" seniors now.. go me.. hehe.. Only 2 more days till school is out, although they are finals days... which sucks.. but still... only 2 days... thank goodness!.. I know my school gets out late, but we did start later in the year.. by like 2 weeks... and we're only a week late.. so I think I got the better deal... hmm.. what else... well, the normal person here should have 16.5 credits at the end of their junior year and 22.5 to graduate... and at the end of this year I'm going to have 22... oh yeah.. go me!... lol.. so hmm... what else...? Well, me and Thalia are no longer friends.. ack.. she just made me so MAD... I couldn't deal with it anymore... even though every time I see her I put on a happy face and try to be friendly, she just doesn't have anything nice to say to me ever anymore... and that just makes me so furious... and the fact that she was stealing my friends right out from under me... ack.. just thinking about it is pissing me off... so I'm going to move on... I started working last week... its not that bad... kinda dull if you ask me... but hey, I'm getting my homework done... lol.. and the pay isn't bad... minimum wage... $7.25 p/h... so not really complaining... hmm.. what else... I went to fairbanks this last weekend... it was pretty dull... but hey.. now I can  say that I've been to the arctic circle.. yeah.. and after the trip I decided that part of me wants to start a homestead out in the middle of nowhere... or maybe by a main road... and just think that would be so cool... like I met these ppl who homesteaded this town called Joy... its this man and woman and the had 23 kids (most of which were adopted) but its just so awesome.. I met some of the kids and they're so cool.. lol.. so yeah.. but I hate being out in the middle of nowhere cuz of the outhouses in like -40 degree weather would suck.. shoot, outhouses suck in regular weather too... well.. I'm going to go now I think... bye bye"

"event","So I haven't updated in quite a while.. sorry about that... well... hmmm... 
Yesterday was more or less fun, except for one little part. It started off with me and Claire wanting to do something, so we asked Steph and her sister to come bowling with us... so that was a lot of fun. Then after that we decided we should go sledding, but Steph and her sis couldn't come. So we asked Claire's bro and his friend, but they didn't want to come with us, so we asked Evie, and she didn't want to come. After that in a half hearted attempt, we asked our friends the Sleeth's, and Justin, Nick, and Brian came with us. So at first we were just sledding and doing the train, but then me and Brian went down and we hit this snow bank and flew into the parking lot, after that we couldn't get enough of the air. So we moved to were there were ramps. The guys were afraid at first, so me and Claire went down and we started on top of this big ramp that was maybe 5-6 feet high, then we got to this other ramp that was a little taller and we just flew, we got up about 3 feet higher then the ramp and landed, which didn't hurt at all... it was so great.. we had to do it again, so this time Brian came with us, so it was me in the front, then claire, then brain, and we set off... we were going super fast when we came to the ramp, we flew so high, maybe 5-6 feet above the ramp and that's when I made the mistake of opening my eyes... it was great, I was able to see almost all of post, but then we started to fall, and I must have freaked or something, Brian jumped off to the right, and the sled started to go left next thing I knew, I hit the snow (which is more ice then snow) face first, and then the whole of claire's body falls on my head and pushes me down the hill a couple feet. That totally burned and scraped my face up... so now my face is just one big scar. It sucks... and hurts so bad... and I'm so sore, but man it was hillarious.. we just laughed about... like 3 minutes after it happened... I think I was laughing about it to keep me from crying.. it hurt so bad.. but that's oky... thank god its just the beginning of spring break.. at least my face will be a little better come school.."

"event","Well its FINALLY friday... ack.. I was ready for friday about 3 days ago... but its all good... 
School has been so unadventful... so I think I'm going to rant about all the really stupid ppl at my school... 1st there is this girl that I hate in my 3rd pd, she is such a whore, ack, she flirts with every guy in the stupid class and complains to them about getting taken advantage of, and I'm all like, you're a whore, what do you expect... ack.. I hate her so much... then in 5th there are all these ppl who are so annoying... all class they talk about the stupidest things and I'm stuck between all of them... ack... I'm starting to get so irritated with they're constant cackling... I'm also getting pissed about EVERYONE getting in my way in the hallway, when I was going to my locker before lunch everyone I got behind would stop... the entire way to my locker... I smacked a couple of them with my guitar ""accedently""... grrr... ppl make me so MAD!!!! 
So yeah... I just had to get that out of my system... so only 6 more days and I'll be 17... yay... go me!! haha... it sucks though cuz my b-day is on the day with all the classes that I hate... ack... that makes me mad.. grrr.... but I guess that's oky... and I'm going to be having my party on Friday and I think everyone will bring an instrument and we shall jam either in the living room or the garage... haha... it shall be great...
I have decided to make it my personal goal to fit into my old prom dress... all I have to do is loose maybe an inch or two, so lately I've been doing so many sit ups that I can't even laugh or anything without pain... I've cut back on junk food too, which sucks so bad cuz I'm really craving some cheetos... ack.. oh well... hehe.. so yeah.. that's pretty much all for now I guess... Well, I did meet this guy on the internet, and he seems so awesome... hehe... but he'll probably turn out to be some 40 year sex affender, but oh well.. haha.. so yeah.. I'm off now.. bye bye"

"event","Well I'm having great animosity towards Alaska... lately during the day it gets about up to about 40 but then its like 20 at night, so the snow melts during the day, and then freezes at night... and its really pissing me off... the sidewalks, roads, everything is covered in ice... I've fallen at least once and sprained my ankle which pissed me off pretty bad, I'm a hockey player, I'm not spose to slip on the ice... lol.... but it sucks so bad... our ice rink is all squishy so I can't skate on that which is really gay since I could probably go skating in the street... and the snow is roughly the consistency of a snow cone... ack... stupid weather...

So yeah, lately I've been planing my part... since there are only 9 more days till my birthday and I shall be 17, which means only one more year till I'm legal... haha... so yeah, my party's gonna rock so hard.. haha.. I'm doing something like I did last year, only I'm thinking about tell ppl that they can bring their musical talents and instuments and have a HUGEMONGOUS jam session... it shall be so awesome... hehe...

Well, prom tickets went on sale today I think, I haven't totally decided if I want to go or not... if I do I think I might go with chop stix, but only as friends... but yeah... I don't know... I guess if I do its about the time to start dieting.. haha.. lol... not really...

So yeah... nothing much else is happening here, geeze... if you thought El Paso was boring, you've never been to Alaska... I mean sure, there's all sorts of stuff to do in the summer... but there's nothing you can do in the winter when everything's all icy... I mean its kinda idiotic to go snowboarding on ice... that's a given... haha... you know that was funny, I know that you're sitting there picturing me screaming and falling down an ice covered mountain... don't deny it... cuz even if you weren't, you are now.. haha... so yeah.. I don't know what I'm talking about...

Actually now that I think about it, there is something happening here... this friday there's actually a CONCERT... I didn't believe it at first, but its true... and I might be able to get tickets... and its actually a band that's on the radio... 36 crazy fists... and I want to go so bad... Tye and me might go... if I can convince my parents to give me an early birthday present and buy me the tickets... haha... so yeah.. .I think that's all..."

"event","So yeah... yesterday I finally got my letter from hockey... it makes me feel special... haha... like seriously, my letter is a lot bigger then Chugeak's (or however you spell it...) 
Well, my band hasn't had a meeting in a while... I'm beginning to give up on it, I mean, we've only had two practices, Sally's the only one with any talent, and yeah... I don't know...
Well, lately I think my friends and I are ""drifting""... like Chris NEVER hangs out with us... Thalia left us a while ago for random boy, and even before that... Ashley usually leaves after lunch since she only has one afternoon class... Tye's there mostly, and Kristen, but I don't know... I'm beginning to wonder if its me that's ""drifting"", I've always had bad luck with really good friendships, at least until last year with the hack circle, and I think that's why this move was so much harder on me then any of the (many) other moves... ack... and I don't know... 
I had forgotten how much I really wanted to come back down to el paso until yesterday, I was looking around on the web and I came across one of my other friend's web page and I don't know I was just overwhelmed with sadness and longing to be back... I hate it! I know I'm probably not going to be able to come, so sometimes I wish I could just forget about it... but I can't.... I'm driving myself mad with all the memmories of el paso and how much I want to go back... and its not going to happen... I just wish I could come to grips with that... ack...
But yeah... this week was so great... no school monday, testing in the mornings, so I got to stay home and sleep, it was so good, I think that's what I really needed... I feel so refreshed... ah but alas... all good must come to an end, so I have a regular school day tomorrow.... but that's oky... its Friday... and I think this weekend Tye and I and whoever else are going skating, with roller skates, which I haven't done since the summer...
I look back I think about how good the summer was, me hanging out with claire everyday, not just the weekends... hanging out with all the stupid little kids on the street... Thalia and my walks... buying out the Zours in the shoppette... going over to the Sleeth's house almost everday... playing hockey in the street... I miss all that stuff... and a lot of it isn't going to happen next summer... almost all my friends are leaving... maybe two or three are staying... all I'm going to say is thank goodness for music... I don't think life would be worth living if I didn't have music..."

I hated valintines day.... its so gay... its just a holiday there to rub in everyone's face who is in a relationship... its pointless... and if you're in love with someone why do you need a holiday to prove it... you should celebrate it everyday, not just that day... it pisses me off... oky... I'm done ranting about that... 
Wow... lately I've been really excited about going to college... I've decided that I want to go to UAT in Tempe, Arizona and major in web design... I'm so excited, and just the thought of going there is motivating me to actually do really good on my SAT's... which I will be taking sometime next month... oh... only 17 more days till my birthday... yay!!... hehe... 
So yeah.. there's like nothing to do today... I'm enjoying it here a lot its like perfect weather... its so warm lately and the snow is starting to melt... all of you are going to laugh when I say when it warmed up to about 30 I was out in a tee-shirt... its so great... lately its been up to about 40 and it great... well... at least untill you go into the shade.. then it sux...
Well last night was fun... I went with Thalia and her brother Uriah and sister Evie to this youth group thing... it was so fun... and we drank this nasty coffee that took like 10 minutes to actually flavor... lol... and I was surprised how many ppl there that I knew... and Uriah and this guy that looks like him and Jimmy and me and claire all went jumping off the church into the snow... it was great... except that the snow had melted and then froze so it was like hard and jagged and I cut my hand on the ice... but it was fun... 
Dude... I now have a trade mark... everyone knows me by checkers... I have a checkered purse, guitar strap, 2 pairs of socks, a chunky 80's bracelet, a wrist band, and an awesome belt that's like a seat belt and it says ford... its so awesome... hehe...
So... yeah... I think I'm done... yeah... oh wait... I'm so happy cuz I found a song that I used to love, but I didn't know who sang it, or what it was called, or how it went... but I found it... its called Bitter Sweet Symphony... I love it... hehe... and I just bought the Queens of the Stoneage cd Songs for the Deaf... its so good... it makes me sad that I missed the concert last year... it would've been so cool to see it since it was on my birthday... hehe... so yeah... I'm going to go now... hehe.. bye bye"

I rember we were talking about the name of his band.. they're called Frozen Souls since we're in alaska... but they wanted to be called something else... so they talking about how all the good names were taken.. Mike said someone suggested Noose... and he's all like well what's a noose but a slipknot... then one of the band members, Jeff, said that if they went on Jay Leno then he'd be all like ""Noose? these ppl are from alaska... why not call then moose""... it was so hilarious... then they got me hooked on their word.. I love it so much... ""fucknut""... I crack up every time I hear it.. lol... 
Then today during lunch this guy, I call him ""random boy"" because I don't know his name, just randomly came up, sat next to me, and put his arm around me... I was scared and flattered at the same time... he said that my balls were big and just sat there... lol... then Thalia drew us (that's what she does, just draws random things at random times) and said how we have the same eyes.. which is weird cuz I've never met anyone who has the same eyes as me... then Chris left to go kill someone and me and ""random boy"" said have fun at the same time.. then Tye asked if we were related and ""random boy"" said maybe then he hugged me... I was scared.. hehe.. 
Then during history my friend Chop Sticks said that I had a cool style and said that he wished he had a cool style like mine... I was so happy... hehe... and him and his friend said that I had awesome shoes... that made me happier... I love my shoes.. they're my vans that nobody has... hehe... 
Yes... well that was my interesting day for today... everyone needs one every once in a while.. hehe... bye bye"

"event","So.. yay... I am now officially in a <STRONG>band</STRONG>... YAY... I started this band at the begining of this week and we are called <STRONG>the Mutant Penguins</STRONG>... its great... it consists of my friend sally on drums, chris on bass, chris's bro nick thalia and me on guitar and tye as our manager... its so great.. and yesterday we had our first ""jam"" as a band, although sally was unable to join us... But I swear, I have never laughed that hard in my life... some of the things chris and nick did was so hilarious, I could not breathe most of the time from laughing... but it wasn't just fun and games... thalia and I were able to come up with this uber cool tune that's so good... and it was great cuz we got it on video for future reference and incase we need to laugh hehe... so yeah, I'm <STRONG>so</STRONG> happy about the band... I don't know how everyone else feels about it, but I'm just doing it for fun, nothing serious, just something to keep me busy and&nbsp;to engage in a&nbsp;form of art that I love.... but yeah, this monday we might be going over to sally's, I happen to be the only one in the band who knows sally, this is because she goes to a different school, and I only know her from hockey.. but she seems really cool and she's super nice... and I'm really hoping we'll all be able to go to her house on monday, just so we can have even more hilarity in our lives... so yeah... everyone needs to check out my band's <A href=""http://www.geocities.com/mutant_penguins2004"">homepage </A>and sign the guestbook... oky.. well, I'm going to get going now I guess.. bye bye"

"event","<P>Well today was good... no today was great... hehe... Although there were some parts there that I felt really stupid... like I lost my homework and I was flippin' out about it cuz I couldn't find it anywhere and it was a study guide and we had the test over the same day... well.. I found it the period before I had that class and was like franticly trying to answer the questions, but <STRONG>ofcourse</STRONG> I don't have my notes... so I go to class with it and it wasn't even due today... grr... then.. I was feeling hungry, so... I was going to buy something out of the vending machine, but then I couldn't get my wallet out of my back pocket... it was making me so mad... I even started jumping up and down.. but I couldn't get it out.. then my friend Thomas (well, actually he's more of an aquatence) but he's all like ""let me help you"" so he like comes over and is all like ""your pocket isn't unzipped all the way"" and he unzipps it and pulls it out.... I felt so stupid...</P>
<P>Oh my gosh... I want to commint suicide now (well... not really) but my mom told my best friend, Chris, that I used to like the Spice Girls *scream* ack... that is like worst possible thing... he's all like.. ""I can blackmail you now"" and I'm all like ""NNNNNNnnnnnoooooooooo!!!"" exactly like that! haha... </P>
<P>Man my fingers hurt... I've been playing my guitar for like 3 hours at least so far this week, everyday... I'm so proud of myself for being able to play <STRONG>good</STRONG> music... like seriously... ever since I first picked up a guitar all I wanted to do was play recognizable music... and now I can... let's see... I can now play... RHCP- Otherside (Chris and I are going to jam out to that hehe), RHCP- Californiacation, Whitestripes- Seven nation army, Audioslave- like a stone, and Metallica- Enter Sandman.. hehe.. I love it.. I'm so happy now... and soon I shall be getting my beautiful new Fender.. wheee hehe... and my amp/distortion petal... and my uber coo' new guitar strap that is so totally me...</P>
<P>Oky now for the Spring Break update &lt;insert breaking news theme song here&gt; First, I still don't have a job or money... crap... Second, my mom said she's not going to totally agree with the trip unless I can find a place to stay...&nbsp;Third, I've&nbsp;been offered a couple of places to stay, but none within the area that is needed, preferabley near Chapin and Nations Tobin (which is on railroad)</P>
<P>So yeah.. I think that I'm writing alot cuz I'm all hyper and weird today.. I don't know what it is.. maybe I'm getting so early signs of&nbsp;cabin fever or something... considering I haven't&nbsp;seen the sun in about 2 weeks.. but that's not&nbsp;entirely because I haven't left my room the&nbsp;whole&nbsp;time..&nbsp;its also because the sun like doesn't rise until about 11 and sets about about 3... so yeah... its not my fault.. haha... </P>
<P>oky.. hmm... what else happened of interest?.. OH&nbsp;today someone let off a stinkbomb<STRONG>...</STRONG>&nbsp;<STRONG>A stinkbomb</STRONG>... come on ppl... this is high school.. nobody lets off stinkbombs... geeze... well... maybe some ppl do... but that's not my point.. my point is that ppl shouldn't do that <STRONG>anywhere </STRONG>near my locker.. haha.. but it was so funny cuz I was with Chris and everyone started running away... but we walk right through and as everyone cleared he shouted ""it was me"" hahah... only he said as in he farted.. haah... that was so hilarious.. I don't know... maybe you had to be there or something you had to be there for it to truely be funny... I don't know.. well I'm getting tired of typing now... hah... oky.. well.. bye bye for now then...</P>"

"event","Oky... well... I talked to my mom about comeing down to El Paso for Spring Break... she asked a couple of questions and in the end I got a ""We'll see"" so that betters my chances of being able to come... :) all that's left would be to get the money to come... I check, with help from Justin, and the cheapest flight was about $704... and I would be leaving here at about 1:30am... just to show you guys how much I want to come... so yeah.... If I get a job after hockey season's over then I don't know... if I work over time or something... do a lot of babysitting... and if you guys could help... then I probably would be able to come... I'd be able to hang out with the old hack circle cuz my spring Break is different then your's so that means I'll be able to go to Chapin... :) lol... I could be a foreign exchange studant from Alaska...lol... so yeah... it would be great!!! Oky well I have to finish choirs... oh... and homework :|... so yeah... bye bye"

"event","Yesterday was great. It consisted of Thalia, Ashley, and I, but we felt like going to see our friend Jacob, who is extremely funny but of course, we walked all the way to his house and he was still at rifflery (yes, our school has a rifflery team... sad huh?) Yes, well, his brothers Justin and Nick were home though, so we hung out with them. First we played hack with them at their house, it was fun, yes, and then we were going to go to the new skate park, but it was closed, so we played hack there. Then we jumped over bushes, I fell and got a huge grass stain on my jeans *sad face* oh well, then we walked over to a park and played on it, yes, played. Then we went walking some more and went to the shoppette. Yeah, it was very exciting, hmm... then we walked some more and ended up at my house were Nick and Justin's mom came and picked them up. After they were gone Thalia, Ashley, and I walked a little more then Ashley went in and Thalia and I sat on the sidewalk and talked for a while, then we got up walked some more and went inside. It was quite fun. Well, it was more fun last night, yes, I just made it sound boring. hmm... well...
Today Ashley's coming over and we're going to watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and Holes, yes, it should be quite fun. (Thalia's going out of town *sniff*) Then later Justin and Nick said they shall be coming over to my house so we will probably do, what else, but walk. Geeze, there needs to be something to do here.
Ack... I miss the hack circle. You guys don't know what its like here, you try to play and people are way too serious about it. Geeze, its annoying. You can't just tlak about random things, everyone's too busy concentrating, its just so sickening. Yes, well, I must get going now, bye bye"

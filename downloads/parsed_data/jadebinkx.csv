"event","$1,125 is the cost of a ""2 mile"" ride in the ambulance.

fuck that shit.
how do they come up w/ that number? $40 was for the neck collar thing, $75 was for the heArt monitor, $20 was for the milage-wtf? that more than paid for 2miles worth of gas they made 95% profit on that and then the rest is for the ambulance....wtf the people were all volenteers who the fucks getting 1000????

such a rip off and its not like i could have refused they didnt ash me or how about the fuckin life flight i didnt get that bill yet but that was totally unnessary, i had a few cuts and a broken pelvis, i know it looked bad and they did whats best but they want to rape the wallet that i dont even have. and on the bill it says pay this amount---->$1,125. no payment plan? fuck that they think they're getting a flat payment? thats funny i havent even had that amount of money all at once since i spent it on my damn car and since i got the appartment a month later i havent been able to build it back up....

wes sid it was about supply and demand people need it, cant turn it down and theres nothing more to do...it sickens me that people make money that way....which is why canada is much better"

at work i got so mad i got dizzy....the store manager ken came back to talk to me about my retarts, and i said ""yea they're doing ok today....yea i gave them a list of things to clean...yea nate will be back tommrow...yea, i cleaned up thoese things this morning...oh that? thats just a box from when they made sauce the other day, i guess they forgot to throw it away, i didnt even notice it"" ...""it looks like its leaking""...""huh? oh no oil was proablely spilled on it, i'll throw it away now"" and i bend down to get the box from under a counter and im really close to it as i grab it and a swarm(more than 20) fruit flies fly at me, b/c my little retarts made a mess when making sauce and spilled some in the box and left the used pouches of sauce in the box as well and then pushed it under a low dake table.
so i freaked out and grabed the box after the flies scattered and stalked backed to the sinks where my speds were hanging out and i threw it at them atd started yelling at them and then realizing ken was still there i lowered it to an inraged hiss which brought upon my dizzyness

i felt like such an ass hole.i was sticking up for them and i find that shit they dont have an ounce of commen sence...they're just stupid retarted fuching dirty spicks....."

"event","so yesterday i went over to lindseys to do laundry, i had 2 loads. the first one i did and when the wash stopped so i put it in the dryer upon putting it in i noticed the clothes were really wet but i figured the washer was doing ts own thing so i put it in and was taking forever to dry, so i said id just let it dry and i'd come back for it tomorrow, well when i went back chris said he turned the dryer off b/c it shouldnt take that long and that the whole bathroom was soaked from condensation or something...
i hope i didnt ruin anything
so i cant do laundry there anymore, so i took the wet clothes and went to the laundry mat by wendys(i stopped to tell wes what i did, and he pretended not to be mad at me but i know he was, b/c when he's pretending not to be mad he's very sarcastic, and he's scarcastly cherrful) i never did the laundry mat thing before so i was confused but i figured it out, it cost $1.75 a load and $0.25 for 10 mins of drying, but these dryers only took a 1/2hour to dry the stuff. so it didnt cost as much as wes said it would...well at least its closer to the house and is quicker, but it doesnt have the company of lindsey, although lindsey can be replaced by the arcade... oh and i forgot to use my dryer sheets:(grrr"

i can't really remember a lot of it...i know ralph and rachael came around 10 w/ the baby Raine. me ashley and wes were already there. i&nbsp; asked ralph about world of warcraft and what faction he was(hoard:) or alliance fags) he says hoard. that made me happy cuz hoard rules. then i asked him how long he was playing and he said he started on a new server about 2 months ago(there are about 10,000 people on a server, and about 50 servers are so) he said Jadenard!!!!!!!!!!!!!thats my server!!!!!!!the odds are fucken increadable that we were on the same server!!!!!!!!we could have spoke before and never have known we've known each other.....if you dont play you cant understands what this means to find someone you've known for years and havent spoken to in a while ....to find them in game....ah..anyway.... 

so ralph had to drop his daughter off at his moms house wes went w/ him b/c as it turned out they were in the same guild!!!! rachael stayed and then we started the drinking..... 
after many shots and drinks later and we got better aquainted w/ rachael. who is awesome by the way, she really is, she'll be a good new female for our dwindling group.&nbsp; 
then the men came home still talking about w.o.w. and ralph gave me a present, he said now this was last min. so i couldnt buy u anything so i want u to have this....he opened his hand and gave me a little hamtaro hampster toy thing. its cute. his name is shotzzy b/c after that we drank a lot of shotsi cant remember how but at somepoint he ended in ralphs shotglass andralph drank him or something...i cant remember why... oh speaking about cute things , ashley got me a bunch of crap that was cute...oh my god ashley got me a HELLO KITTY ICE PACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SO HELLO KITTY CAN HELP MY B00 B00S!!!!!!!!and hello kitty sandwhich bags, and a hello kitty purse and a hello kitty pez dispencer, which i already have but 2 is better than 1. hello kitty car window clings, tooth paste that i used this morning b/c i hate mine and turtle hand towles and a turtle necklace and i cant remember what else but i was very pleased w/ it all. she aways gets me the most random crap..amazing... 

but any way....i got really wasted and i remember popcorn and toast, but my toung was so numb from the liquor i couldnt feel me chewing it or taste it, but im sure it was good.&nbsp; 

oh we played twister and all the colors called was on one side of the mat so it was hard and we were all trashed so it was harder, but first ralph was out then i fell into rachael i think...or maybe she fell in to me...but we were out. then lindsey, then ashley, so shottzzy won....he didnt want to say anything but he thinks she was cheating and pushing peeps on purpous.... 

at some point i was talking to rachael and i was kinda leaning over and some one cracked my ass really hard and it hurt so turned around and i was drunk so i fell or something...and the just kept wailing on my ass! WTF. i think every one there slaped my ass really hard and it was more than 19 and one for good luck!....so i have a bruise on my left lower buttcheck....*grummble grummble* and then when i was poor drunken and on the floor and couldnt get up ashley grabed at my thong and then lindsey pulled the strapss up to my ribs....and i'd be more mad if i could remember more! but i cant lol its all so vauge....then i stumbbled on to the car and wes was trying to help me but i wasnt having it . lol i felt bad for him b/c the whole ride home i didnt shut up once..... i was trashed...

and on top of that my mom called and told me my brother said my car will be ready for either monday or tuesday! ya!!! he said that yesterday afternoon, unfortunatly last night my other brother davy, wrecked my dads truck badly (he's ok though) so im thinking on the scale of importants my brother rob will consider fixing my dads truck before touching my car, which isnt even broken. the deal w/ the car is its a 1996 monty carlo(green!) cost $800 he bought it off an old lady. 80,000miles. good car. how ever his girlfriend has the same exact car, even the same color, and he knows that the motor heads go at 100,000 miles or so. so he's going to put new ones in or something so he doesnt have to later otherwise he says it should last me a while....but it takes so long to get the part....grrr

i think i want cereal no wait beagel....ummmm"

Wes came to pick me up from work when he got out of school. he came around 3ish and i get of at 4. so he went to roam the mall. so he comes back to me at aroung 3:40 w/ a white chinese take out box, and he waves at me to come behind the counter so i go to him and he tells me to look inside. i did and it was a baby red ear mud slider turtle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he's so small, and so friendly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he smaler than the palm of my hand. wes bought him for $10 at the pet shop, it was just hatched a few weeks ago they didnt even have them on display yet. so she sold wes it under the counter, cuz your not susposed to sel them that young.

but im sad b/c the new turtle(TURDY) is very friendly and doesnt mind being held and is very small and cute, and he was hatched in a small little cage, so when he goes in to our big aquairum he has a lot of fun b/c its so huge... and thinking about it makes me feel bad about keeping horde. he's miserable i think b/c we're keeping him somewhere much smaller than he's used to so we're letting him go later today...when we put the little turtle in w/ him it was the cutest thing i ever saw ...turdy crawled up on top of hordys back!!!!!!!!!so cute but they were getting along together for the most part but then hordy snapped at the little one twice and we're worryed that hordy will hurt turdy so w're keepig them in different containers now....

im sad though, and all teary eyed b/c im letting him go i feel bad and was crying about it im going to miss hordy...he's so cute but i think he'll be better off. tommrow we're going to the pet shop to get another domesticated one..."

my turtle is so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
i just gave him some ham (he gets meat every 3 days. he goes snaches it up, carries it for a swim around the tank and then takes it under water to eat... 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
wes's mom thinks the dog isdying. its a great dane and its 5yrs old but danes dont live very long...i feel bad for her,b/c losing a pet is hard..wes was like so? he's mean when it comes to pets sometimes, its b/c he didnt have any when he was little, witch sucks b/c when we have a house i want a cat or 2. i know what having a cat is like he doesnt(his mom has one but he doesnt really see it cuz's its upstairs). he doesnt understand they're so eazy to care for. i blame mike and dawn, just b/c they didnt care for there cats doesnt mean they're bad pets, but he thinks they are. all you have to do is feed them change there box1-2 times a week or scoop it as needed, and spend a little time w/ them which could just be letting them sleep on the couch next to u when u watch tv. dawn never did any of that thats why the grey cat was such a bitch.... 

a turtle will be SO MUCH HARDER to care for than a cat, but i thik he tricked me a little...now i have a pet that , yes i want and love, but is rather hard to care for and he could be like mike and say well if u want to keep it you have to take care of it...............a turtl box is a lot harder to clean than a litter box...litter box-------&gt;pick up take out side, dump out, re fill. Turtle home-----&gt; remove turtle and put him in another box, put some tank water in a bowl, catch fish and put them in tank water bowl, remove all stones, the filter and heater, take basking light off, lug the tank w/ about 15gallons of water outside, dump, re make the tank, and turtle and then temper the fish so they wont go into shock and die...and he thinks cats are so horriable...i hope i can do it, the bitch at the pet shop told me i'd proable regret the turtle, but i love hordy.... 

oh yea so i think wes's mom wants to rase the rent again. we were giving her the rent today and she said not now im in a bad mood we need to talk aout it when im in a better mood. so wes said whats to talk about we're giving u $130 i'll leave it on the table and she said not now and walked a way... 
he said if she raises it for no good reason again we'll move..but i dont know 
`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
so today at work i went o my half hour break, and it sucked sorta. all i wated is to go to rue and buy a shirt or 2 and see if there were sales. on my way i passed this guy named mike, he works at the cell phone assesory&nbsp; stand,&nbsp; we talk every now and then&nbsp; cuz he comes in alot and orders a pizza from me. so he sees me and come and says hi and said so where are we going? and i figured he messed up his wording. so i said rue 21. so he follows me in to rue and says he loves shopping w/ girls so im like what ever, always good to have someone to fetch me sizes. so im looking at those polos i always get there and he keeps bring me all these slutty close telling me they're sexy, so i always make a gay joke like yeah you'd look good in those or i dont think u have the chest to pull that off, and stupid things like that and i was getting really anoyed b/c he knows i have a boyfriend. i dont know i dont&nbsp; mind attention from guys that dont know me, like if i know some one just checked me or&nbsp;if a coustmer flirts w/ me a little thats fine, but this guy pointing this and that out telling me that'd be hot on me or thats so sexy or ""you'd&nbsp; look banging in that while your banging""&nbsp; that shit really anoyed me, i think mainly b/c he knew i have a boyfriend and i dont like people like that.&nbsp; i kept telling him stuff like yea i have that my boyfriend loves it or what are u kidding my boyfriend wouldn't let me out of the house dressed like that. but he just never gets the message....gggrrrrrrrr the guy creeped me out....now i want to try to avoid rue 21 but that sucks b/c its my favorit store.....grrr why are men perves"

"event","so i go into work today and nate, my manager is talking to ken, the store manager...so i stay out of the way until kens gone b/c i figured nate was getting in trouble for us closing yesterday, so when ken left i asked him what that was about and he said Tiffany, his assistant manager, and how he doesnt want her there anymore. well i like tiff and all but she is a bad assistant manager b/c she cant hardly work durning the day b/c of her baby, which makes her useless to nate, really. and b/c having the 2 of them incharge is like your parents splitting up. nates very new to manager and of coarse he wont be as good as the old one, but she blames him for EVERYTHING. people quiting, the schedule fucked up and her not having enough hours. she's constantly bitching about him not doing his job. but what the fuck she doesnt do anything either, well she does as much as anyone else working there. but she's not there durning the day doing what she's supposed to do---assist him.

well anyway he said something like ""i dont know what the fuck her problem is i loved being the assistant manager"" and he said that on pourpos  to lead me to my next comment which was along the lines of""yeah  i'd love to make $1 more just to critize you"" and he laughed and said ""thats good b/c i recomended you for the position b/c im having her demoted""....and i said""oh..."" and he asked me if i'd take the job if it was offered and i told him that i would but i wanted him to ask cierra first. he said he would have but he doesnt think she could do it w/ the job she's starting when she comes back from vacation. because she would be better suited b/c she knows a little bit of the paper work and she's been there the longest, but when she comes back she's going to start a job at Hilton, which pays alot more so she plans on working there full time and at caesars during the nights and weekends. she has to start her $3oo  car payment soon as well...yet the same problem...she wont beable to work durning the day....

another problem i brought up is tiff will not stand to be demoted, she'll quit. and he said he knew, and he's not going to fire a young mother hard on cash just b/c she's a bitch...but if she quits thats not his problem...and she'll quit, i know she'll will and she'll bitch about me everyday the moment i leave...which causes another problem if she quits so will katie, which will leave 4 people working there...and goodworkers are hard to come by...oh well"

well i had to close the resturant down today at 4.b/c my boss nate had today requested off, and he was sick anyway(and if he wasnt already sick he would have been too drunk and/or stoned) plus he's at 38.5hours(WE'RE NOT ALLOWED OVER 40 B/C THAT WOULD BE OVERTIME AND THAT'S NOT ALLOWED)so even if he came in to day he wouldnt help much w/ only an hour 1/2.
im at 39 hours and i, could have only stayed an hour. megan had to go to scranton after work, i forget why but she couldnt stay, and tiff was going to work to night but she cnt close by alone or be by herself the whole night. so than there's katie who could have worked tonight (but she'd have to leave and come back froma doctors appointment) but i need her to work durning the day tommrow, b/c the bitch who quit was going to work day tommrow...

i dont know k`mart is stupid...if they would have given overimeto me for 3 hours that would have ment paying me$9 extra or so...well thwy cant do that!!!so lets close it down for the evening and not get all the night profits...such retarts!"

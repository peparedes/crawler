"event","So...its 4:30 and I'm at Cara's with Preston and Joey. We played cards, spoons, and pictonary. We went to Taco Bell at 12:30 and when I walked in the bathroom the girl in there was on the phone and told whoever she was talking to that the girl who just walked in was hot. I think she was talking about someone else. We are now watching Troy. And I'm on more drugs but I'm taking these of my own will and they are good for me... That's all I really have to say...

"event","<center>Ok, for those of you that I haven't told. I might be at school today during 7th hour. If you want me to try and come see you, note:this doesn't apply to Liana or Erica or anyone in 7th hour German b/c I will already be coming to see you, leave a comment w/ the class you're in seventh hour and I'll try to come see you. But you have to leave room numbers or I'll get lost or give up. I have advice for those of you wondering if homeschool is better...Its not. It sucks I get emails from 2 Jessicas and Erica. I dont mind getting emails in fact I enjoy reading the emails I get, but I have to deal w/ Cat...for those of you who don't know she is kind of immature...She's the same age as Shay...but She asks me to go shopping at Hot Topic w/ her so I can show her what to get and she claims she's goth...what a bunch of shit...damn...ok sorry about the bitching...My new German teacher is named Frau Rocker...god I love the name...but her teaching skills are kinda off...but I must go as I have to get some school done today....

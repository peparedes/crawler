"event","Soooo... welcome to North Carolina, Blue State 2008.  It's been a great week since The Election... but we here at NC State can't handle change very well.  See, according to our wonderful newspaper (I use both terms loosely), The Technician, we're all damn racist bastards.

Ok, backing up.  Wednesday morning, some poor innocent freshmen stumble out of their dorms for 8:00 class and into the Free Expression Tunnel.  Now, I spend all my time on the engineering campus and thus missed this whole spectacle, but from what I gather, some idiots had gotten hold of some paint.  What happens when idiots have paint, kids?  Correct. They paint racist messages in the Tunnel.  (Klan wannabes don't like Obama much, by the way.) 

Long story short, this turns into some huge deal, like we got together as a campus and decided to hold a KKK meeting in the brickyard.  The newspaper has been reporting nothing else, I'm getting e-mails left and right about anti-racism meetings, and there's a general feeling of hostility on campus.  One headline today read: ""NC State students are more racist than you think.""  Really?  I didn't think I was racist... but maybe I am. After all, the rest of the city seems to think that all white students are racist now.  For Pete's sake, the NAACP is coming to Raleigh to verbally abuse...err...speak to the campus. 

Now, I've done nothing wrong here.  I'm certainly not racist, and I happen to support Obama.  I even spent an afternoon at campaign headquarters.  So why on earth do I have to interrupt my regularly scheduled programming to tune into this drama?  Four maladjusted asswipes decided that they needed a little more attention than they were getting from their sorostitute girlfriends and decided to paint the tunnel.  Big F-ing deal.  Let them go, hang them by their toenails, I don't really care.  Just leave me out of this.  Quit cluttering my inbox and taking over my newspaper.

They wanted attention, and they got it.  Happy now?  Good, let's get back to normal already."

"event","so it has been a looooooong time since i've posted last, but i needed to express my joy over the upcoming democratic primary in north carolina.

the date of our primary in this wonderful state is may 6th.  this falls more than three entire months after super tuesday, which is widely considered to be the most important primary date in the country.  we vote so late here that i actually vote after i finish the school year.  well, i don't know who decided to stick our primary at THE END, but thanks to his vast intelligence, our votes rarely count.

that's right: in this ""democratic"" society we have going here, an entire state's votes do not count in the primary election.  in fact, seven states, plus puerto rico, vote on or after may 6th.  yet, iowa and new hampshire, of all places, get the priviledge of setting the pace for the rest of the election.  does this make sense to anyone else? and does anyone actually live in iowa?

didn't think so.

north carolina holds a fairly large chunk of delegates, at 134.  in this election, every delegate counts.  so what does this mean to us?

this year, the democrats care about north carolina.

that's right, folks: these past few weeks, the tarheel state has hosted hillary, obama, and all the relatives that can maybe give them an edge politically.  chelsea clinton (who i apparently look like) and michelle obama have spoken at n c state.  (why they came to a predominantly republican school is beyond me, but hey, i ain't complaining.)  bill clinton visited the senior center in cary. and best of all, there is  talk of a debate being hosted by cbs and ncsu, to be held at the rbc center on april 27th.

forget hockey, forget our disappointing basketball season... i'm gonna go watch a presidential debate.

and then i'm going to vote. and best of all, my vote will count."

the bush gardens trip was amazing. except for when steve got sick and jon, olivia, and i had to stay with him while he ran and threw up. oh wow. and then a truck went off a bridge on the way back home and we got stuck in traffic (...?) and then there was a hobo sleeping on a table at the rest stop, which was kind of sketch... and divya and i made friends with some random guy in line for the one ride and he kept staring at us. and mandi and steph were flirting with some creepy guys and steve told the girls to knock it off and the creepy guys freaked out. and then we had some interesting band trip hook-ups (none involving me this time, aren't you proud of me?) and then me, joe, and steve had to entertain the bus by doing stand-up... oh geez. i wish david would have been there because we were getting some serious UNC-bashing going on there...

"event","so this is really weird, but...

olivia and i ran out of gas on the way to the school play last thursday at the intersection of western and gorman... so we got a bunch of guys to help us push the car into the wendy's parking lot at the intersection. (by the way, that parking lot is death to cars: we ran out of gas, bryan's tire went flat, and devin locked his keys in his car while the car was running.) so then two of the guys that helped us drive into the parking lot and ask if we need help. considering our plan was at that point to walk to the gas station to get some gas, we of course said sure why not... because, you know, it's not shady at all to get into a mini van with two college guys that you don't know... but they were pretty awesome about the whole thing... so we got gas for the car and made it to the play on time (yay).

ok, so the weird part... of course they go to state, so we were like yeah, i'll probably run into our rescuers next year sometime... and then one of them found olivia's myspace so yeah... we have new friends now. lol.

today was... emotionally draining... i had a tough lunch period. (i know that sounds pathetic, but take my word for it). 

everyone pretty much hates me and hannah for nailing flight of the bumblebee in four days. ah, hell, they're just jealous.

went to the hockey game last night. that was the most depressing night of my life. except for... well, we won't go there. basically, the canadiens scored 3 in a row, the canes scored 4 unanswered, the canadiens scored 2 more, the canes tied it up with 2 minutes to go, and it went into double overtime. and then we lost two and a half minutes in. pain in the butt. so i didn't do my calculus homework.

i hate calculus.

yay, busch gardens in a few weeks! i just love band trips. (we all know what happens on band trips. bad things happen...) i'm 3 for 3 in doing stupid things on these trips. let's make it 4, shall we?

key lime. yum. or pecan pie.

4. What are you doing this summer?

working, college orientation, possibly a DCI show or two (yay!), and maybe some durham bulls baseball games.

5. Through the eyes of your Freshmen year self, describe the way you are now.

so i thought about it, and basically, my freshman year self hates my senior year self. she thinks i'm way too much of a ditz. and she thinks the way i handled everything sophomore year was incredibly stupid (but that's a long story).

(and meagan and i are so mad at sato for not coming. he would have enjoyed the asians at the restaurant.)

i think i got extremely dirty looks from 4 people today. which is better than last year. but i think i need to have less people that hate me.

championships were totally awesome. we made finals for the first time ever in a class above the one we used to compete in (and lose in), and then we had the most freaking awesome run ever on sunday. but the judges decided to be idiots and give us a lower score... we thought we might move up in the standings, but not quite, so the whole entire day was basically a waste of time. so we just ended up talking through awards with broughton's and roanoke rapids's guards.

(except for me nearly fainting during 4th period, but i'm getting that under control, i think.) umm... we traveled down capital boulevard for like a year (and the whole ride seemed to consist of asian jokes directed at sato and kevin... haha), then we went into wakefield and into warm-up... during warm-ups, hannah looks at me, goes ""uh-oh"" and, well, we had to find someone with a lighter (in our band, not a problem) and run outside to fix her piccolo... then nothing crazy happened until after we finished playing. then we got the scores, straight 1's yet again, rock on. some of the girls decided we didn't feel like going back into the disgusting bathrooms to change out of our dresses and high heels so we figured hey, we'll change on the bus. not a stupid idea, but not too bright either, with cary hs being on buses next to us and guys being on our bus and whatever. then we went to the mall (yay) to go eat... at like 7:30, but late dinner is better than no dinner (i love food, of course). doc got a huge coffee so he was in a really, really good mood... then i went to the ice cream place and ordered a cone but no ice cream and of course the guy thought i was nuts. meagan tried to get the guys to go into the bathroom and tell us what was in the vending machines in their bathroom... i'm not sure why, but it's meagan so there's really no explanation. then we went back to school (uggh) and, to top it all off, we had to go down to the gym to do one runthrough of the show. without warming up or anything. damn. and then, to get back into the school, alex had to call doc's cell phone and get him to unlock the door for us. so... i got home at about 10:00.

(because, you know, we weren't very good last year...at all)

today at lunch, ho said that he hates all band people (except david.) so i said ""aww, michael, do you hate me?"" and he instantly replies ""yes."" lol.

went to the mall with morgan, laurie, and lauren to look for prom dresses (i didn't find any that fit, of course... ""does this come in a size 0?"") and we figured out that the store with all the massage chairs is awesome.

it's gonna be a long week. i hate valentine's day with a passion."

steelers. rock ON. man, at one point, roethlisberger threw an interception (in a brilliant stroke of genius) and we all thought the game was gonna start to suck but then what do you know, it got better. what was the score, 10-21? awesome. i get to laugh at joseph tomorrow.

yesterday was stressful. woke up early, went to science olympiad (yes, i am serious), did two events... complained about my hair being messed up (which i'm sure i was one of the like eight people there who actually worry about stuff like that... seriously), rushed over to practice until 9... the usual. long day.

calculus was unusually boring today. and in english we had a writing assignment on our summer reading. so after we planned out our essays and everything... our teacher told us that we were going to do the actual writing in groups. scott, chris, and i killed that essay. rock on.

in nhs, they gave us a speech on how some people have ""inappropriate"" pictures on their myspace, etc and that it will. not. be. tolerated. hahaha... i love my school. it's full of idiots.

EAC presentation tomorrow. exciting. this means we get a grant to start a recycling program at school... yay! no more nasty blue trash cans... you have no idea how bad the stuff we pick up smells... gross.

state of the union at 9 tonight.

edit: i promised updates on the competition. it was incredible. compared to last year... wow. 2nd place. and then green hope's varsity guard (yuck, green hope) got bumped to the next class up so we're the top of our class right now... exciting. amelia and i spent a good deal of time bugging wyatt (a.k.a. thomas), which was fun. laurie made it to the competition from all-district in chapel hill, and then came back for awards... she came in right before neko, sam, and i went up for retreat, which made us happy.  matt and charlie came to the competition... as did joseph and one or two other athens people. i think we need to have a better turnout at the next one though. oh well. i'm excited. only two more weeks until west johnston!"

highlight of the day: discussing how david will do anything for money. (for gradman, of course. to raise money for the homeless.) rach asked him if he'd shave his legs. he said he would for the right price. so i asked him what that would be, and rach and i decided on $2. he said no, so i said 5. he replies:

""for $10, i'll let <i>you</i> shave my legs.""

there are some people in my english class who i never wanted to deal with ever again. like my neighbor. oh, this is going to be so fun. and sociology is, of course, crazy, because mr. bahm doesn't make us do anything. at all.

calc BC is a pain in the butt.

much to-do in 4th period about christine. something about respiratory problems. then joel (or charles, i don't remember) said something about how hey, i think she's faking her problems most of the time. gee, ya think? i spent over a week in the hospital for respiratory problems. i sincerely think her issues are minor.

went to zaxby's today for lunch. we were heading towards western and david was wondering if we could make it to hillsborough and back in 37 minutes. so we decided to ditch the rest of the group. and we weren't even late for wind ensemble. david is still amazed that kelsey and i took matt to a club. he says they still talk about it. which is kind of weird.

picked up recycling around the school today. fun stuff.

physics was pretty strange today. we started talking about the quiz that we took (and failed) and then we somehow ended up talking about blowing stuff up, which really has nothing to do with thermodynamics. and then alex was drawing trumpet players on my quiz. crazy kid.

went to the jv softball meeting today. maybe i'll try out.

"event","well, on the plus side, winterguard is getting off to a great start... second practice was tonight and i'm so excited for this season. and i hear the uniforms aren't bad either... i think someone said we got them from the crossmen. so maybe no bleeding bananas. (just kidding.)

according to the calculations of my physics class, it was 3 degrees celsius in the classroom today.  i think we were wrong though. it's almost december and they have the air conditioning on. what the hell...

so today we found out who got us in trouble for last saturday night.
my ex-best friend is the reason i nearly got suspended. wtf? (i mean, i hated her before now, but honestly.)

lunch was fun today. we made fun of colorblind people. this could be the reason i miss matt and andrew so much: no more colorblind people.

i'm so ready to fail my physics test tomorrow.

i. am. exhausted."

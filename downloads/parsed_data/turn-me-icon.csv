ANYHOW. This time there was a theme, and the theme was ""love."" Aw, how cute-ish.
Actually, it was quite enjoyable, and helped us focus.

Notes:
Don't ask about Nick Martin. We're running low on images.
Our Brad Pitt icons turned out accidentally similar, oh well.
The lyrics for Anya's Pitt icon are from Dave Matthews Band's song ""Dancing Nancies"".
The lyrics for Anya's Sirius icon are from the song featured at the end of the movie The Two Towers; ""Gollum's Song"".
The blond chicks = results of a meme thing that Stephy did.
Again, don't ask - hah!"

Ugh.

We had another icon-off, first time it's to be posted here.
Too bad it was so brief and not so great.
Two icons...

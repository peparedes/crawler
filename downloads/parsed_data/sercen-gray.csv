"event","<font face=""Bradley Hand ITC"">Hi, journal.  It's me again.

Anyway, I said I would tell you about the races and the Mage-Touched, right?  Okay...there are five races.  From most to least common, those are the firexi, the humans, the paxis, the eserptat and, lastly, maltat.

The firexi are like otters, but humanoid.  They range in color from black to white, covering shades of brown and gray.  They're pretty laid-back, for the most part, but their nobility isn't.  There's no such thing as a laid-back noble.

The humans look like hairless apes.  Now, for me, hair and fur is pretty ugly, what with me being scaly, but flesh is even moreso.  They tend to be a bit...ah, socially stratified.  They can be most colors between white and dark black, but a deep drown seems to be most common.

The paxis are reptilian, but not like me.  They're desert lizards, and are humanoid.  They range from orange and red to blue and green, and most colors in between.  Their nobility is very upright and honorable, or so they claim.  Me, I wouldn't know.

The eserptat, like me, are also reptiles.  However, we are not quite humanoid, having arms but no lges.  We also have gills, being an amphibious race.  We range in color from blue to green, but not gray, so I'm pretty noticeable.  Our nobility is really annoying.  They're arrogant and rude if you happen to be lower-class than them.  Especially to Mage-Touched.  I don't think they like knowing we come from nobles.

Lastly, the maltat.  They're easily the oddest.  Picture three-foot long rats with foot-long tails.  That's a maltat.  Their tails are prehensile, but from what my maltat friends say, they think hands would be nice.  And thumbs.  There's not a lot of maltat nobles, but the ones that are around are very...ah, nasty.  In creative ways.

Those are the five races, although crossbreeds are increasingly common.  Especially between firexi and paxis, for some reason.  Philosophers and wizards didn't believe it was possible, but it turns out that it can happen.  There's no such thing as crossbreed Mage-Touched though, because of one major quality of the Mage-Touched.

Mage-Touched are caused by inbreeding.  We are, it's true.  That's why most of us are noble-born.  After all, who else marries their cousins on a regular basis?  From what I can tell, they either kill us or quietly give us to orphanages and say we died in childbirth.  Closed-casket funeral and all.

We're pretty easy to recognize, so they can do it easily.  See, whatever color we are, we're all that color.  Completely.  I'm gray.  Scales, fins, frill, everything.  Even eyes.  We don't have visible whites to our eyes...unless it's a white Mage-Touched, then it's all whites and no pupil or iris.  They're there, but the magic we're born with hides them.

We can't become wizards because of it, too.  Normal people can do any color magic, but not directly.  That's what spells and research and learning magic theory is for, I guess.  We are magic, in a way.  A part of the huge web of magic that the book we borrowed before talks about.

However, we can do magic directly.  Not powerful magic, but magic all the same.  For example, <i>I</i> have second sight, sort of.  I can always tell who's in a room with me, without looking.  If I try, I can sense an entire building or street.  It starts to hurt and I can't do it for too long, but I can do it.  And I almost never forget.  I guess, maybe, if I tried really hard, I could read someone's basic thoughts.  Maybe.  But last time I tried, my whole body ached and I didn't manage to do it.

I'll tell you about my friends and what we do tomorrow, journal.  I'm going to read one of my books now, and not a lot happened today.

"event","<font face=""Bradley Hand ITC"">I said I'd explain, journal, so I will, even though I already wrote in you today.  First of all, magic, right?  A book wouldn't know, even if it is a 'Gray Book,' like you claim to be.  I wonder if you are one.

Anyhow, there are twelve colors to magic: red, blue, green, yellow, black, white, brown, gray, orange, purple, silver and gold.  I'll explain them one by one.  I know all this from a book we borrowed from a mage.  Well...we gave it back, anyway.  After reading it.  I don't forget stuff, you see.

Anyway...red is fire magic and heat.  Of all kinds.  Very destructive, not much else, but skilled red-specialist wizards can do...a lot with it.  Even more than destruction!

Blue's water.  And ice, steam, some weather and so forth.  Very versatile and common, and one of two colors that can grant water breathing.  Being an eserptat, I can already breath water.  But that's irrelevant.

Green is earth magic.  Dirt, rock, stone, physics.  Yeah, physics.  Friction and all that.  It's a new science, relatively.  A lot newer than the science of magic, anyway.

Yellow is air, and also electricity.  And most weather, and also water breathing.  I said one of two before, right?  This is the other.

Black is...death, really.  Disease, undeath, direct killing, sensory deprivation.  Not neccesarily evil, though.  Big distinction there.

White is life.  Healing, sensory input, lots of stuff.  It can be nasty, too.  Sensory overload, physical boosting of nasty, unfriendly things, so don't go thinking it's harmless, journal.

Brown is nature.  Animals, plants and that sort of thing.  It's very versatile, but not the most obviously powerful.

Gray (like me) is logic and intelligence.  Also information.  It can make second sight, search the past and predict (not tell, though) the future.  Predictions are not guarenteed accurate, because it's all logical predictions.  Life doesn't always work like that, but it should.

Orange is space.  Teleportation and telekinesis are the two best-known skills of orange magic.  It's also got some minor control over physics.

Purple magic is illusion.  This should be self-explanatory.  The bigger the illusion and the more senses it has to fool, the more powerful (and difficult) it is.  Some illusions seem entirely solid, even if you touch them.

Silver is time.  The complement to orange, whatever that means.  It was from that book we borrowed.  Anyway, silver magic can tell the future and the past and is very powerful, but always subtle.

Gold magic is enchantment.  It can't do anything on its own, but with another color it's extremely powerful.  It makes magical artifacts, like everburning candles or flaming swords.  Or water-breathing apparati.  Apparatuses, maybe.

So that's magic, journal.  I'll explain Mage-Touched and the five races next time.  It's time to go eat breakfast, and not much happened yesterday for me to tell you.

"event","<font face=""Bradley Hand ITC"">I just bought this journal at a second-hand bookseller.  For some reason, it was completely empty.  It <i>was</i> a second-hand bookseller, so why is it empty?  It's also got the words ""Gray Book"" on the cover.

Well, anyway, my name is Sercen.  I don't know what my last name is, what with being an orphan.  I do know my parents are alive and noble, for all the good that is, of course.

See, journal, I'm a Mage-Touched.  A gray one.  That's why I bought this over the other journals.  I was born infected by magic, just like some kids are born without arms.  I was infected with Gray magic, which is information and logic.  I live here in the orphanage with a bunch of other Mage-Touched kids.  I guess there are real orphans, too, but they don't like us much.  We're lucky, though; there are twelve of us, one of each color.  We can deal with most things.

I'll explain that in another entry, journal.  A book couldn't know much about that.

But...well, we survive off the stuff the orphanage gives us and by petty theft.  After all, they don't mind it and they don't give much, so what can we do?

It's one of the few good things about being a Mage-Touched...I'll explain that later, too.  I have to go now, it's time for breakfast.

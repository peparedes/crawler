At least the students will get caught for the alcohol >/ They don't realize that it basically shrivels your liver, and that's one of the most important vitals in your body.  Idiots."

<small><i>There's a good kind of pain
An insane kinda sane when I'm around you
There's a chill in the heat
Feel the sky at my feet cuz I adore you
I cant ignore you

I'm not ill I don't need to
take a pill to fix what you do
Cure can come through
cuz baby all I do is suffer from
The symptoms of you</i></small>

...This is disgusting.  The journal says its by that one stupid girl that keeps carrying cocaine on her.  Paris Hilton?  No.  I don't care.

<small><i>There's a left kinda right
There's a blind kinda sight looking at you
There's no light in the moon and its winter in June
When I'm without you

And it trips me off my feet
I think I'm falling in too deep
Do you feel it too?</i></small>"

There's not nearly the amount of noise here as there was when Angie was here too.

In other news, I suppose I should start sign ups for my class.  Please respond here if you are interested in Medical Studies.  This will not be an easy class, and you best be on top of it if you would like a passing grade."

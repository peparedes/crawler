Hope dangles on a string
Like slow spinning redemption
Winding in and winding out
The shine of it has caught my eye

And roped me in
So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing
I am captivated

[Chorus]
I am Vindicated
I am selfish
I am wrong
I am right
I swear I'm right
I swear I knew it all along

And I am flawed
But I am cleaning up so well
I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself

So clear
Like the diamond in your ring
Cut to mirror your intentions
Oversized and overwhelmed
The shine of which has caught my eye
And rendered me so isolated, so motivated
I am certain now that

[Chorus]

So turn
Up the corners of your lips
Part them and feel my finger tips
Trace the moment, fall forever
Defense is paper thin
Just one touch and I'd be in
Too deep now to ever swim against the current
So let me slip away [3x]
So let me slip against the current
So let me slip away [4x]

[Chorus]

Slight hope
It dangles on a string
Like slow spinning redemption..."

"event","Imagine there's no heaven,
It's easy if you try,
No hell below us,
Above us only sky,
Imagine all the people
living for today...

Imagine there's no countries,
It isnt hard to do,
Nothing to kill or die for,
No religion too,
Imagine all the people
living life in peace...

Imagine no possesions,
I wonder if you can,
No need for greed or hunger,
A brotherhood of man,
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...

You may say Im a dreamer,
but Im not the only one,
I hope some day you'll join us,
And the world will live as one.
   
     RIP john

wouldnt it be nice if we could all live in peace & accept everyone ?? thatd be verry nice. but no. people have to be ignorant & judge people. well maybe one day itll happen or maybe it wont. i hope that by setting an example i can influence some people into being more accepting. thatd make me somewhat happy."

"event","i dont feel well. too much stress. im too tired 4 typing up an entry but heres how im feeling:

(Sounds of someone puking) 

There I go--thinking of you again 

[Chorus] 
You don't know how sick you make me 
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach 
Every time I think of you, I puke 
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
You may not think you do, but you do 
Every time I think of you 

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem 
But off of the dome would probably be a little more, 
more suitable for this type of song--whoa 
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of 
Sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink ta 
So fuck it, I'ma start right here by just be brief-a 
Bout to rattle off some other reasons 
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you 
On my arm, but what do I go and do 
I go and get another one, now I got two 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin 
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again 
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim 
Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it 
If you only knew how much I hated you 
For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through 
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you 
Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-who 

[Chorus] 
You don't know how sick you make me 
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach 
Every time I think of you, I puke 
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
You may not think you do, but you do 
Every time I think of you 

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter 
But I thought a song would probably be a little better 
Instead of a letter 
That you'd probably just shred up--yeah 
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of 
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta, a stupid piece a 
Paper, I'd rather let you see how 
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle 
You're a fuckin' cokein' slut, I hope you fuckin' die 
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye 
I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut--I hope you die 
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie 
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad 
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back 
It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna yak 
-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag 
What else can I do, I haven't got a clue 
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to 
But every time I think of you now, all I wanna do 
Is pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke 

[Chorus] 
You don't know how sick you make me 
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach 
Every time I think of you, I puke 
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
You may not think you do, but you do 
Every time I think of you, I puke 

Fuckin' bitch


i thought id do it in song. well bye


xoxo, love me"

"event","i have no idea whats going on anymore. whats the truth ? im sorry kevin. i love ya hun dont be sad. ahh but like to think that all this time it was all a lie. to think that he really was using me for another purpose. maybe getting closer 2 kev ? that sickens me a little. and to think that he lied to all of us and everything was a lie and steph and amanda were right. to think that hurts me inside. i really hope its not true. im confused. i need the notebook so i can pour it all out. but i think its stuck. i have so much pain welled up inside & i can see in his eyes he does too. but mine just cant pour out. its impossible for words to express it. bit by bit im dying inside. im going insane. im growing closer to the blade. its the only thing im sure of anymore. no no no. im stronger than that i say. but im begining to crumble. i cant express it anymore. a pain so deep and maybe if i jump...ill get to the bottom and end it.

at lunch brian and alora attempted to lift my spirits. it didnt work. i didnt talk to them at all at lunch.


i have madD hw 2 do. ttyl =]

"event","It's your first time. As you lie back your
muscles tighten. You put him
off for a while searching for an excuse, but he
refuses to be swayed as he
approaches you. He asks if you're afraid and you
shake your head bravely.
He has had more experience, but it's the first
time his finger has found
the right place. He probes deeply and you shiver;
your body tenses; but
he's gentle like he promised he'd be. He looks
deeply within your eyes
and tells you to trust him - he's done this many
times before. His cool
smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him
;more room for an easy
entrance.You begin to plead and beg him to hurry,
but he slowly takes his
time, wanting to cause you as little pain as
possible. As he presses
;closer, going deeper, you feel the tissue give
way; pain surges throughout
your body and you feel the slight trickle of
blood as he continues. He
looks at you concerned and asks you if it's too
painful.Your eyes are
filled with tears but you shake your head and nod
for him to go on. He
begins going in and out with skill but you are
now too numb to feel him
within you. After a few moments, you feel
something bursting within you and
he pulls it out of you, you lay panting, glad to
have it over. He looks
at you and smiling warmly, tells you, with a
chuckle; that you have been
his most stubborn yet most rewarding experience.
You smile and thank your
dentist. After all,it was your first time to have
a tooth pulled.

"event","Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
"" 'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door;
Only this, and nothing more.""


Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore,.
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,
Nameless here forevermore.


And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me---filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
"" 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.
This it is, and nothing more.""


Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
""Sir,"" said I, ""or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you."" Here I opened wide the door;---
Darkness there, and nothing more.


Deep into the darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word,
Lenore?, This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word,
""Lenore!"" Merely this, and nothing more.


Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before,
""Surely,"" said I, ""surely, that is something at my window lattice.
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore.
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore.
"" 'Tis the wind, and nothing more.""


Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven, of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door.
Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door,
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.


Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,
Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the nightly shore.
Tell me what the lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore.""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""


Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door,
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as ""Nevermore.""


But the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered;
Till I scarcely more than muttered, ""Other friends have flown before;
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.""
Then the bird said, ""Nevermore.""


Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore,---
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of ""Never---nevermore.""


But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore --
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
                                       Meant in croaking ""Nevermore."" 

Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er
She shall press, ah, nevermore!


Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath
Sent thee respite---respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, O quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore!""


""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
On this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore:
Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me I implore!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""


""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--
Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore---
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""


""Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked, upstarting--
""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""


And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming.
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted---nevermore!"

You have only 10 dollars on you and if you eat it in the 60 minutes its free. Can you?...

Imagine yourself in a nice pizza resturant in minnesota, when a man walks out carrying a 28 inch 11.5 pound pizza to you and your friend and sets a timer for two hours. If the two of you finish it you get five hundred dollars. Can you?...

Imagine yourself sitting in Ben and Jerrys with 4 of your friends. You all put in 50 dollars and each of you get a VERMONSTER which is a sundae, 20 scoops of ice cream, 4 bananas, 1 brownie, 3 cookies, 4 ladels of hot fudge, and 18 scoops of toppings, plus whipped cream. The first one to finish it ALL gets all the money. I can do it, Can you?...

Imagine yourself sitting in a nice seafood resturant at a bar for the oyster eating contest. Whoever eats the most in five minutes wins. The guy next to you is the bars record holder, comsuming 52 dozen (624) oysters in 2.5 hours. Can you do it?...

Imagine that you and two other frineds just got finished partying at a bar and go across the street to a nice breakfast place that is 24/7. The three of you each get the world famous 12 egg omlete. It is 12 eggs with meat and cheese, plus hash browns and toast. The whole thing weighs 9 pounds. Can you finish it?...

Imagine that you are hiking the california trail, a trail that runs 2368 miles from mexico to canada. Your hungry so you and your friend stop at a nice little diner on the side of the road/trail. YOu decide to have a contest, seeing who can finish the five pound pancake platter first. The time limit there is two hours and if you loose it, you clean it up. Can you do it?...

Imagine yourself going to Tufts college in boston and there is a nice deli right off campus so you go there and order the riley burger, a cheeseburger weighing 3 pounds, 8 patties, 12 slices of cheese, plus 5 pounds of fries. Can you do it?...

And at one point its not the tracks on the mt, the tracks go off the mt onto these structures like one of those wooden coasters and for those of u who know me well I HATE HIGHTS AND ROLLER COASTERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.

First, you had this guy who had two girls, one for 5 yeares and one for 3. neither knew about each other and he had a child with both of them. On the next part there is this guy who spent a year with theis ugly girl. Three months ago he also started sleeping with her sister. Then about a month ago he moved on to the sisters mother while he was still with the sisters. Then while with the mother and the sisters he got with the father multiple times. Cool huh. He just made his way through the family."

"event","I maen like holy crap. What the hell is up with tv commercials these days. Lets see:

Pepto Bismal Commercial- Crazy awsome cool but sop freaky. I mean who wants to see a bunch of old work people doing the pepto macarena

Boost Mobile Phone- The scariest commercial ive ever seen. THeres this old ladie thats actin all ghetto and shes sayin stuff like ""bangin party yo"" and my personal favorite, ""now were all at this bangin party and getin ten kinds of nasty"", in which you see two old guys on top of some other old lady. 

K9 Advantix- Another of the scariest commercials ive ever seen. It would bve cute if the dog wasnt wearing the neck thing and if the dog didnt sing. Its not even cute. It gives me the heebeejeebees (i dont know im weird)

What not to wear- I just saw this commercial for what not to wear a tv show on TLC where they redo your entire wardrobe cuz the people on the show cant dress (their like me). Yeah but this commercial is cool. You see this guy who cant dress running in a park. Everyones staring at hiom like holy crap, why cant he dress. THen the two people who redo ur clothes sniper the guy in the ass with a tranqulizer dart. When he wakes up hes dressed in cool clothes. 


But whatever, some are cool and some arent but thats ok
ummmmm errrrrrrm errrrrr ok

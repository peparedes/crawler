"event","im in pittsburgh right now at the library. its weird so far. the first night i realized how important it is to breath when i couldnt quite do it because the house i was staying in had a cat. the second night i spent sick totally sick in some random persons 4x7 spare room that had heat to kill someone. i slept all day and all night and now i am up again, cranky and wanting to go home where i can relax in my home and drink tea and knit and talk to my valerie. she has a way to always make me feel better. i dont fell like walking anywhere cause its cold and i dont feel like sitting anywhere cause i dont know anyone and they all have cats. ugh. this is more annoying than fun."

"event","last night time went backwards and up and down, slow and fast, it went out the window and i saw patterns in time and rooms filled with song and loud. i danced behind the red curtain, my feet exposed at the bottom, this is a moment. i think.                    the snow was beautiful and the trees breathed with life they made me listen, i heard them. 
could you just say something so that i know you are okay. so i know you are with us cause im not sure you are.

last night i did drugs. lots of drugs. weird."

"event","Today. I wanted to run through swirling leaves. Through falling leaves. Jump up on cracked sidewalks and not feel the cold sneer from the city. I wanted snow angels. I wanted ice cicles. Open my eyes and see purple and blue and winter. Today. I wanted to breath new. i wanted real. i wanted dirt and grass and natural. I wanted warm breeze and fields to lay in. Today. I wanted hot sun and bare feet. Feel smooth rocks in cool streams. I wanted shade from trees. I wanted night, warm, and the moon, full.
Today I did laundry.
Yesterday I had food poisoning."

"event","im at work. im excited cause things are finally looking up. i have been in a slump for the past two weeks or something. it was weird. i quit my other job, so i had all this free time and all i wanted to do was sleep, but im finally starting to get me own for real blood running through my veins. i want to create again/more. Ive got all these ideas. woo! 
so the house is getting to me. there are so many people all the time being drunk and loud and annoyingly dirty. the new thing to do as of lately i guess is to ash your cigarette wherever you want, which totally pisses me off. people need to do their dishes too. last night i got home and no one was there. i was so relieved. i jumped in the bath tub, took a looong hot bath, walked around the house naked for a bit, and then meditated. i always feel like such a weirdo new age-y type when i mention meditating but it is such a wonderful wonderful thing. I seriously think it makes me sane. 
valerie has a new love interest. i felt really weird about this at first. im not sure why. it could have been my general weirdness as of lately or maybe i felt left out, im not used to her being interested in hanging out with anyone else. this is fucked up though and i must not think this way. sharing valerie will be hard but i can do it. 
im hanging out with my mom tonight. we are constantly saying that we want to be closer even though we see each other all the time. there is something missing. we need to talk like really talk about stuff that matters. its hard to do that with the mom."

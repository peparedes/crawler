Today has been a good day i have eaten until i am stufffed and all my dads side of the family just left my house.  Last night was good too we went to this realy nice restraunt and had dinner.  It wasn't really a thanksgiving dinner because everyone had steack and a bake potatoe but wwe went there to celebrate Thanksgiving because most of my moms side of the family lives out of state so it would only leave two people my mom and my aunt to cool all the food. That is why we decided to go out.  We were suppose to go to Lake Lanear to see the light afterwards but it was raining and stuff so my uncle canceled that part of the evening.  i was kind of glad cause i have sse those same light since i was two and so i gets kind of old after a while.  Plus i have a sinus infection and didn't really feel like doing much.  i feel better today accept my throat still hurts. 

I think we may put up all of our Christmas stuff tonight but i am not sure.  My mom is really in a bod mood right now she has been in a bad mood all day for some crappy reason . So i don't know if she will feel like putting everything up tonight

I think tomrow i am going to go shopping with my mom but we aren't geting up really early because my brother and i don't play with toys anymore so she dosen't have to bee the crawd to the toy store.  In the past she hasmn't let me go with her but last year she did. Now she lets me go cause she wants me to pick out stuff i want for christamss. Even though i have already got most of my christams.  I think that might be fun if she is sorta in a better mood. Hopefully she will be.  Well i guess i am going to go and watch tv if i can find anything good on. LATA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I was in the kitchen fixing my lunchand he said that I couldn't eat until he got done. I told him that he wasn't the boss of me and in his perspective i could do what i wantd when I wanted.

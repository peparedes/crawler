"event","Well my dad was admitted into the hospital yesterday. We took him to the regular doctors office and they were checking him out and they found that he has extremely high blood pressure and his heart beat was going up and down very rapidly, so they did a EKG on him and then they wanted him to go see a cardiologist right away so we were getting ready to walk out to get into the car and my dad had to sit down because he said that the room was spinning in huge circles so he sat down and i went to the back to go get the doctor. the doctor was trying to get him to get up and walk to the back but he was telling her that he was in no condition to walk out of there so they got a wheelchair and took him to the back and by this time he is having a hard time breathing and having some chest pains. they hooked him up to oxygen and gave him some asprin and some stuff for his high blood pressure. he wanted some water so the doctor gave him a little bit and by this time the ems had arrived and they were moving a bit slow and he started throwing up so that made them move a lot faster. they got him stablized to where we could make it to the hospital and we get there and they stablize him and then they admitt him into a room. he saw some doctors today and they say that he has an inner ear infection that is knocking off his balance which is a possiblity that he was feeling dizzy and light headed. they did a cat scan on him today and we are still waiting on the results for that but all the other tests that they have run are all turning out ok. they want to do a stress test on him tomorrow first thing in the morning to see if the dizziness was possibly caused by his body trying to  have a stroke. this has been a scary event. my dad scared the shit out of me. i was there on his the whole time all this was going on. he is doing good right now and feeling better because they are giving him medication to help him. hell be ok. this has been so hard on me thinking that i am daddys girl. i am taking this hard, but i am holding up. i just want him to come home and be o normal but that might take a little while. well i havent gotten any sleep in 36hrs so i am dead tired and need to get some rest so that i dont end up in the bed next to my father. i will keep you guys updated and all i ask is that you keep us in your prayers. thanks guys."

"event","Well well well, I had an okay day i guess. i was late for school because I dont have my car and my dad had to take me and he is late for everything. i got all my reading lab done for the rest of the semester today, so that was a good thing. i just have to get caught up in my math now. hopefully that wont be so bad. i went with my dad to go to his friends print shop because he had a job that he needed to get cut and while we were there my dad started feeling light headed and faint, so i made him sit down for a little while and then we went and picked out the paint for my car. we went and bought pizzas because little ceasers had their customer appreciation day and then we came home. we were eating and the next thing that i know my dad was leaning over and telling me that he still felt dizy and faint. i told him to drink some water because he might be dehydrated. he drank a glass and still wasnt feeling well, so i made him go to bed early. he woke up about 2 hours ago and said that he still felt the same way. i dont know what is wrong with him but for some reason it is scaring me. i am hoping that he will wake up and feel better then he has ever falt, but who knows whats going to happen. it just doesnt seem normal. he was also the one that was making fun of me this weekend because he was talking about the time that i blacked out and hit the fridge then the stove then went head first into the front door and then passed out. thats was one crazy morning and i wont ever forget that because that is some scary shit to wake up after being passed out. last night joseph called me and came over and we talked for a while outside before my mom called me inside. my mom was asking me if we are together again because she doesnt really like him because hes a druggie. he says that he is trying to stop and that he doesnt really do that anymore. he does smoke cigs and drink a lot but i guess thats what he has taken up since he is trying to stop drugs. im just not too sure that i want to get involved with someone who does that. i have been involved with that shit one too many times and its not something that i want to get myself involved with again. hes an awesome and hott guy, but thats just a huge flaw about him. i have so many friends that if they werent druggies i would probably date. those of you that this involves know who i am talking about. i for some reason have seemed to attract a bunch of druggies lately and i dont know what it is about me that attracts them. who knows. i talked to peter today, and it is official that he has a girlfriend. i dont know whether to be happy for him or to be sad. i just still see myself with him and getting married and all that, so its hard to accept the fact that he has another girlfriend. peter is doing good though, he seems happy out there and thats good. he got a job and thats keeping him busy. he said that hes doing ok in school but he is failing a class. im hoping that he brings that grade up and passes that class. of course i miss him here but i am still here and surviving without him. i get to the point to where i see myself thinking about someone else here and forgetting about him for a little while and then i think about him and there i go again. i havent really thought about him all this weekend except for on sunday, and thats a good thing because that means that i have kept myself busy and not thinking about that shit. well i better get going and quit boring you guys if anyone reads this. lates."

Today was okay, I had to wake up early and go pick up moonwalks and then my dad and I came home to work on my car and see what was wrong with the starter. We figured out what was wrong and we went to pick and pull and got the part and a little extra parts that we werent really planning on getting but will help with getting my car back to normal. We got it fixed and then we took it up there to get the new door and hes going to fix the dent from the first accident and then paint it. I cant wait to get my car back. I have to go with my dad tomorrow to go pick out the paint that I want to get. Its still going to be blue, but its going to be a little bit lighter then what it is now. My poor car has been through a lot in the past two years. Its still kicking though and I hope that it will keep kicking for awhile. Well I better get going to bed so I can get up early for someone to take me to school, I will update later."

"event","I just wanted to say Happy Easter to all you guys! I hope that you had fun, well I hope that someone out there had some fun because I didn't have any at all. I took my baby cousin to see Nemo on Ice yesterday, and then my mom and little sister wanted the baby to stay the night here. They called my uncle and fought with him to let her stay, and with them knowing that I had to get up and go to work today they put her in my bed last night anyway. She sleeps all over the bed kicking and turning everywhich way, man I hate people that sleep like that! I was up almost all night! Then I had to get up early and go do moonwalks with my dad, and me thinking that we only had one to do, boy was I wrong, we had to take out 3 and pick 2 up. We did all that and I had to rush home and eat and get ready at the same time to be at work on time. Then I went to work and worked the last show of Nemo on Ice til about 6. My sister picked me up from work, because right when I think that things are going to go good with my car, some other shit happens. My dad went to start it last night to go to work, and the damn starter went out on the damn thing, so now I have to come up with more money to get that shit fixed before I can even get it to the shop to get it fixed and painted! This car is pissing me off. I just want to go out there and kick the shit out of it and hit the damn thing with a bat! I just want it to be back to where I can drive it, because now I am stuck working around everyone else's schedule and not having a social life. Well, I better get to bed because I got to get up in the morning to go pick up all the moonwalks that we took out. Talk to you laters!"

"event","Well, well, well, it's been awhile since I have updated this! Man do I ever have a lot to update you guys on, that is if any of you still reads this thing. I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't! I am still enrolled in college at SAC. It's been going pretty well I guess. I am doing good and passing my only two classes that I am taking. Sometimes I feel like a loser because I am only taking two classes. As for Peter, who I still consider my best friend, is in Nebraska for school still. He still calls me every once in a blue moon, but when he comes down, he will come see me. He knows better if he comes down and doesn't stop by to see me. He was here last week for his spring break. When anything happens to me, he is still the first person that I call and talk to to lift me up or to tell what happend. He is still there for me and will talk to me when I need someone there. I miss him a lot though. I still see myself with him and him only and I guess that's why I can't seem to find a boyfriend, because when they hear about Peter they either stop talking to me or get really weird after that. This next thing will prove to you that I call Peter for everything still, I was in a car accident once again on Feb. 21 st and my first instinct was to call my dad and as soon as I got off the phone with my dad, I wanted to call Peter and I wanted him to be there with me, because I was scared and I know that he is there to comfort me. Well, unfortunately when I called him he was in class and can't answer his phone. But the weird thing about this event not only is that it has been less than a year since my last car accident and less then two years since i had my license, but the guy that I was ""talking"" to at the time, Tim (Hutch), called me right after it happend. I don't know if that was fate or what the hell it was but it was surely crazy. So, once again I had to go round and round with another fucking insurance company because the bitches that hit me were trying to lie about it. I got it settled, and I think that it helped that I had some experience with the first accident. Why do people have to keep hitting me?!? And they are always guys driving their girlfriends cars, it just doesn't make any sense. Then to just top this day off, I finally got a hold of Peter and find out that, to what I understood, he has a girlfriend. That just totally tore me to pieces, I haven't got the courage or the guts to ask him about it ever since it sort of slipped out of his mouth that day, I'm kind of scared to, because I don't want him to and I don't want to know if he really does. That will just kill me! I know that I need to move on and it seems that I move on from guys fast, but for some reason I can't let go of this one and it's painful. I have been trying to talk to other guys and move on, but I am getting treated like shit and it hurts. I guess Peter has treated me better then what most of the other guys have treated me like and I respect that and also the fact that my parents love him to death and talk about him all the time and bring him up for everything. I am sort of talking this guy in the Air Force, but I don't really know how that is going to end up, because things aren't really looking too good on that. He wants something that I don't want to give him and since he found that out he has been acting really weird and not wanting to see me and not really calling me that much anymore. I guess I am just not meant to be with these military guys because I won't put out for them. I am not going to be a military hoe and do that shit, sorry. He was so nice at first and I even talked about moving with him to New Mexico with my sister and her boyfriend is also getting stationed there, but now it doesn't look like I am going there. If I do end up going it isn't going to be with him, it will be because my sister needs someone. Sometimes I get to the point to where I hate guys. I guess we all go through that at one point! I am still working with my dad on the weekends, and also at the Alamodome, but I also sell Avon now, so if anyone has any questions about that or want to buy any, let me know and I will be glad to help you out with that. I am having a good time doing these things, but sometimes I wish that they could take up some more time. I have too much freetime on my hands and I get pretty bored. My neighbor had a baby on jan. 21st, and he is so cute. I help her out with him a lot. Anyone that knows me knows how much I adore children. I love to help them out. Well, I better get going. I will try to update a lot more. Laters guys, I have missed this a lot!"

I was so shocked to hear from him and then the news that he told me explained everything. He told me that he broke up with Marlyn because she got mad at him for getting drunk one night. I didnt even know that they were together, I mean I knew that they were talking but i didnt know that they got together. I knew that it wouldnt work out for long anyway, because they are totally opposite. A friend of mine keeps complaining that I talk about him a lot, but can a person talk about their best friends? Matts birthday is coming up this weekend. Happy Birthday Matt! I dont know if I am going to be working on your birthday or not, so I thought that I would say it a little early. I will try to call you. Love ya man. I met a guy at Chilis a couple of weeks ago, and we have been getting to know each other and he tells me that he wants to go out on a date. Hes a nice guy, but I dont know if I am ready to date again. To me, Guys Suck! But I guess most girls say that when they go through this stage. I think that I get along with guys as friends better. I guess I will know when that right one is there. I just dont know. Sometimes I feel like a loser, because no one calls me from school anymore. And when I think I find a guy to get Peter off my mind, they go off and dont want to have anything to do with me anymore and I guess thats why I am just going to give up and not worry about finding a guy, and then maybe one will just come to me. Hey, its happened before. well Igot to go help my dad fix my car, so I will update someother time."

"event","Hey guys! Today was so fun. I had an awesome day! At school we had fun because a friend of mine brought confetti eggs to school, and it was so fun chasing richard around the school with them at break. I got him twice heehee. But then he took one right out of my hands and got me big time. Boy did he ever wedge that shit into my hair. There was no getting it out without using a brush, so I have to go all day with that shit in my hair. That's kool though because it was so fun. I had some tests today, but I think that I did pretty good on them. We are getting progress reports sent out and I am failing government with a freakin 69. My parents are going to shit. Then I was in 8th period and I turned my phone on and I had a voicemail, I checked it and it was my grandpa telling me that he had gotten my car repaired and that it was waiting on me to go pick it up. OMG boy was I ever excited to hear that. I went around the school bouncing around and telling everyone the great news. I missed my car so much, and now it is so great to have it back finally. They fixed it to where I can drive it, but we still need to get the body damage fixed, but we are going to wait until I actually get the check from the insurance company. It wasnt that expensive to get it fixed either. It was only $192, and I am getting $760 for it. I still need to get the body damage fixed, but hell I got my car back and that is all that matters. 

On another note, I went through a stage in my life again asking where God was and why he was putting me through a bunch of shit. Everyone was still yelling at me for the whole insurance shit, like I am supposed to know what the hell to do, my mom was yelling at me because she says that i dont do anything, but the only reason her house is clean. Then my dad was yelling at me because supposedly no one helps him out and does anything for him, but yet I am the only one that helps him with anything. Bridget got mad at me because I bitched her out about me having to take her ass to work, because she isnt ever home, but then when she does come home everyone has to stop their lives and help bridget and do for Bridget. I'm sick of it. Then Tori does nothing but yell at me and curse me out all the time, but I take her to school everyday. Why do people treat me like shit all the time? Sometimes I feel that the only person who doesnt treat me like shit is Peter. I got to go because I am talking to my cousin. Laters!"

My dad and I were both like, ""I hope she didn't have Fred Loya Insurance, because they might try to screw her over and not give her money for her car either."" I was pissed, and they made my dad talk to some other lady and I think that my dad kind of already pissed her off. That isn't a good thing, because now she is the one that is handling my case. It just sucks for them, because they are the ones that are paying the rental car, not us. Oh yeah, Meredith is doing great and she is back at school. We are having this really big drug issue at school. Four people have already been busted, and there are still more to come. I am just so glad that I don't have to worry about that at all. A bunch of the people that are going to get in trouble are my friends, and I don't want to see them get in trouble, but if you are going to do it and tell people, then you deserve to get caught. I don't know. It just hurts me to see so many of my friends doing it, much less get busted and get in trouble with it. This just sucks for prom though. I don't think that some of these people are allowed to go to prom now because they got busted. Three of the four people were on the baseball team, and now they aren't. I don't know. Oh yeah, I wrote the insurance company a letter, and I told some people that I would put it on here so hang on..........

March 28, 2004

Fred Loya Insurance Company
5805 Northwest Loop 410
San Antonio, TX 78238

Dear Fred Loya Insurance Company,

I am an 18 year old, who worked very hard to earn money to buy a car which I purchased and paid for the upkeep of my vehicle.  Your client ran a red light (which to my knowledge is against the law) and took all of that away from me. 
First of all, it took your company 11 days to take responsibility for the accident when at the time of the accident your client told my father and the police officer that it was his fault because he ran the red light.  I had no vehicle during the 11 days to drive myself and my 15 year old sister to school, which is a thirty minute drive from my home. 
I feel that what you are offering me is not fair at all. If you could find an equally dependable vehicle that will get me to school and home with the amount of money you are offering, then I would consider your offer.  I am a senior in high school getting ready to go off to college, but to what I can tell I may have to change my plans, because your client ran a red light and ""totaled"" my vehicle.  
I had a witness to this accident, and thank the Lord that the other people in the car along with myself were not injured in the accident.  This was all caused because your client was not paying attention to his driving.
I feel that you are trying to take advantage of the fact that I am a teenage driver.  Legally, in the state of Texas, I am considered an adult, and could join other adults such as yourselves in a voting booth if I so desired.  I am not going to let you take away what I have rightfully owned because you want to keep business with the person who ruined it.  My car was very dependable until your client, to which I may say was not focused on his driving, ran a red light and hit my car. You have put a ridiculous price on a replacement, which only makes me wonder what you would offer if I had owned a new vehicle, like the car owned by your client.  I know that his car had damage from the accident as well, and I would like to know if his car is being repaired or if you considered it totaled as well, and offered him only $366.00 to get it fixed.  I may be young, but I know the value of things and I know things in life don't come free, and I'm sure that an offer of $572.00 for your client's vehicle would cause a laugh in the face at your company, and more than likely the loss of that client.
I am not trying to rip you off, I am just trying to get a good, reliable car like the one I had before your client made a mistake and ran that red light.  I do hope that together we can come to a compromise that both your company and myself are willing to accept on behalf of the loss of my car, otherwise I may be forced to take action in court to get back what was wrongfully taken from me.

That's how I feel about it, and I hope that by them reading this that it might change their minds and let them realize what they are trying to do. They need to realize that I am not going to put up with it. I will not let them screw me over and some how I am going to get a car out of this, even if it is getting my car back and fixing it. We might have to take them to court still, but I don't know yet. I also found out that the car and the insurance stuff isn't even this guys. We think that it is his moms or something like that. This is just stupid and retarded. I just want my car back, and yes I am going to whine until I get it back. So whoever reads this has to live with it."

"event","I dont feel the need to be here right now, I know that I shouldn't be saying this seeing as to how my best friend is in a mental hospital, but I know that I won't get that bad. My life is just going downhill and I am fed up with it and I don't know what to do about it anymore. It all started when Peter broke up with me. I didn't know what to do when he broke up with me because at that point he was my only friend that I hung out with outside of school and he was the person that I tried my best to help out whenever he needed it. He was the person that I turned to for everything. He got my hopes up about being together again, but I know that isn't going to happen at all. I mean come on he talks shit about me to people at school. Then my mom got sick and we had to rush her to the hospital and she was real sick for awhile and had to have major surgery. She is still out of work and has to go back in on Monday for some more surgery. I get into a car accident and find out recently that my car os totalled and the insurance company is being a bitch ass and wont get me any money for it. I have put so much into that car. It is the only thing that I can say that I bought on my own and its in my name. Now it is gone to the dogs and thrown to the dump. Then my best friend runs away from home and when they find her they put her in a mental hospital, which she is still at now. I havent seen her in two weeks and I havent talked to her in about a week now and I am going to so crazy because I miss her and want to talk to her and see her. I am so worried about her. She thinks that no one cares for her, but I got some news for her, I care for her. My little sister is treating me like I am one of her little friends and cusses me out all the time and I dont know what to do about her anymore. She just doesnt care and bosses everyone around and gets away with it. It hurts me so much to have a little sister that doesnt have any respect for me what so ever. I just cant take this anymore and I just want to know what I did wrong and why God is  punishing me this bad. Just keep me in your prayers. I need them."

"event","On Monday after school I was taking Shanyra and Lauren with me and we were going to Walmart right by the school. Well, we didn't make it to Walmart. I got in a car accident. I was sitting at a red light and my light had turned green and I waited for a good 15 seconds and I didn't see anybody coming until he had hit me. He had ran his red light and hit my drivers side and now I don't have a car. He hit the front part of the car and messed up my tire. The thing that sucks is now I don't have my car for spring break. My dad talked to the insurance company and told them that I need a source of transportation until they can get my car fixed. So, my dad is trying to talk them into getting me a rental car until I get my car back. All I know is that I want my car back, you don't realize how much you love your car until you get into  a car accident and you don't have it. The guy was nice and admitted that it was his fault, but then he was real pissy and mean to me in other aspects. He looked at my car and was like thats all that it did you your car. I was like what they hell your the idiot that hit me. Then I asked him if he had insurance and he was like, of course I have insurance, it's a new car. I was like your the fucking dumb ass that hit me so don't be getting all pissy and shit with me. I didn't say that, but boy did I want to. He had like 20 people go look at the cars and shit. Man if I was the one to run the red light and hit someone I wouldn't have had my friends come look at the mistake that I made, I would be embarrassed. He was an older guy, but I am just glad that he admitted to it and he didn't try to blame it on me because I am a teenager. But he admitted to it and now it's all on him and his insurance company to get my car fixed and back new."

"event","Well, today was soooooooooo horrible. I don't know what to do anymore. Peter is taking someone else to prom, which is kind of what I figured was going to happen seeing as how he isn't really talking to me right now. I don't mind that, it's just the fact that I didn't find out from him. I found out from everyone else around me. And he is also saying that I lied to him. And that he has done nothing but catch me in a bunch of lies. That is nothing but bull shit. I'm sorry but I do not appreciate that because I would not lie to him about anything. I care about him waaaaaaay too much to lie to him. To what I know his mom still thinks that we are together, and I want him to tell her and to tell her the truth about it and not make me look like the bad guy. I didn't do anything wrong and I don't want his family to hate me for any reason because I love them and respect them will all my heart. I wouldn't do anything to hurt Peter or his family, and I just want them to know and understand that. I don't want to be the one to tell his mom, I want him to be the one to tell her because not only is it his mom but I feel that it is his responsiblity to tell her because it is his mom. I don't want to be the one to break the bad news, but if that's what is gonna happen then I am going to do it. I feel bad for not telling her sooner but I respected what Peter told me and I didn't tell her anything because he didn't want me to. I have done nothing but help him out in any possible way and then I get treated like this. I just don't know what to do about it anymore. Right when I thought things were going so great, they turn and I get treated like shit and hurt so bad that nothing can compare to the way that I feel. I am going to go now, because I am tired of talking about it because it hurts so much. Lates."

"event","Well, I went to school of course, then at break Meredith and I went to my car to go get some drank drank. We drank some and then I felt bad so I had to take a cup back to Peter. Man, that boy chugged that cup like it was nothing. I wasn't surprised though because he loves that stuff. He has gotten to where he really doesn't talk to me that much at school anymore, so he really didn't talk to me yesterday and I was a little upset because I had planned on going to his baseball game after school. Well, after school I was walking to the bathroom in the gym and he stopped me and asked me if I was going to his game and when I told him that I was going he got all excited about it. I didn't want to go to the baseball game by myself because if you don't have someone with you then it gets kind of boring, so I took Shanyra with me. I didn't know that Rachael and Melissa were planning on going as well, but they went and we had fun. I was talking to Rachael a lot. It started to rain a little so I went to my car to get a jacket and I had Peter's cell and they called me and told me that Peter said that he thought he locked his keys in his car, so I looked all on the inside of his car, but they weren't there. Well, he threw them in his bag which was in his trunk. We didn't know what we were going to do, so he had this brilliant idea to try to use my car key in his door, and what do you know, it opened it! Like I always say, what would that boy do without me? It was craziness. Then he wanted me to go eat with him, Rachael, and Melissa, but I had to take Shanyra home and get my ass home before it started raining because I hate driving in the rain. I went home and I tried to call Peter but he was still eating and told me that he would call me back when he got done. Well I got tired of waiting and I went to bed at 9 because I was like dead tired."

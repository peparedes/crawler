"event","<P>Ok well i shall recap on the happenings of the past 2 weeks of band camp...</P>
<P>Basically I&nbsp;just sat around because&nbsp;I am in pit... and thats what we do... sit... I wanna be on the damn drum line! Shane was supposed to teach me the snare cadence for parades but did he? NO... grr... oh well... ok so yeah... I get to play the tambourine... Its not that fun... Troy (who plays snare) are going to switch instruments for indoor. Yay! Lol. Ok so anyways... We went to Kennywood on Thursday and it was grrrreat fun! I think I made some new friends! Yay new friends! Ok so then there was Friday. Band camp was boring. Jenna, Kayla, Sarah, and I went to the mall Friday night. It was fun. Um.. I stayed over Kayla and Jenna's Friday night. I fell asleep around 3ish. Apperently everyone else stayed up till 5 and made cupcakes. (and by the way, I still need laid) I didnt get to try any because I had left the house at 9am. Darn. Sarah told me that I got up and shut the alarm off in Jenna's room (where I slept), however I dont remember that at all... Ok so the band had a car wash today and it was also great fun. Sarah D brought the Jeep down to get it washed. Her and my mom said we did a shitty job of washing the cars. I think its because we were all tired and hungry and hot... Well whatever... Ok so now I'm at my gram's house, not that fun... Jason needs to get done cutting his damn grass... I'm bored and in need of someone to talk to... Ok well that's all for now... I'll write again when I get to a working computer!!</P>"

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well I went to the mall yesterday. I was there for about 6 or 7 hours.... Holy shit that's a long time.... Ok well I got almost all of my school shopping done. My wardrobe now consists of mostly JCPenny clothes... OMG I loooove my shoes!!&nbsp;It's quite funny though because my wardrobe is ""preppy"" and my shoes are ""skater"". Oh well, what is one to do?? Anyways... We were walking and this dude hands me this cd so I'm like yay some cool new music. Well I get home and find out its not a cd, its for the computer... So I pop the cd-rom in and I'm even more pumped cuz I think I'm gonna jam to some rad tunes. It turns out that the videos weren't working so I went to the website that was on the case. <A href=""http://www.peta2.com/"">www.peta2.com</A> So now I'm like wooo a whole site dedicated to a new band. Well, I get there only to find out that it's not a music site at all, its <EM>a site trying to convert people to go veggie</EM>!! I'm like <STRONG>wtf</STRONG>?!? So that&nbsp; thoroughly dissapointed me... That and the fact that <EM>someone</EM> hasn't been on all weekend and that I can't find this one site has made last night very unenjoyable.... Ah well... </P>
<P>Ok so thats about it for what happened this weekend... Damn it... I still need to get to HotTopic... ::sighs:: ok well I'll write next time I get to a computer with internet access....</P>"

Well, nothing much has happened since I got home from Maryland &lt;3.... I hung out with Kayla everyday after band camp and that is always fun. Band camp isn't too bad, we (the ""pit"") really don't do anything... at all... I get to play tambourine, woo fucking hoo... (can you see my enthusiasm??)&nbsp; I WANT TO PLAY SNARE DAMN IT!! Ok well writing it isn't really gonna get me anywhere... Um yeah there's 2 foreign exchange chicks in band... the one (Loes) is pretty cool... Um... what else... oh yeah!! Certain people (not mentioning any names... TRAVIS) are really starting to piss me off because they are <EM>supposed</EM> to be transposing music but they aren't... Oh well, fuck them... And if anyone cares, I stayed awake through the WHOLE day, and that's pretty damn good considering that I only got 2 hours of sleep last night... Ok, that's enough of my complaining to last you a while... I'll write later... maybe... Well, I'll at least write before I leave a working computer..."

"event","Ok well I'm gonna start off with the happening of yesterday:
   We went to Red Robin to eat which is always fun. Sadly no one got ""Bosk Chicken"", but it was fun none the less. Ok so there was this bus boy kinda dude and he was all like ""Enjoy your meal"" and of course my Unlce and his friend had to say something. Then there was this dude with a hat (What is up w/ guys in hats down here?!) and I was about to hit my Uncle and his friend but I didnt... Ok so then we went to Marshall's so Brit could get clothes, but my Uncle, his friend, Cassie, and I went over to Best Buy to look at TVs. That was fun... Then we came home around 930ish and we were in bed by 10...

TODAY:
I was rudely awoken at exactly 8:30AM by my gram. Now since you've never been woken by my gram then you need to understand how it is... Imagine this: You are in a deep sleep, probably having a great dream. All of a sudden you hear ""GET UP! C'MON GIRLS! GET UP NOW! I SAID NOW!"" and you are abruptly woken from your sleep and must jump out of bed like that (::snaps fingers::) and be ready to work. Yes well that is how I was woken today. OK so as soon as I get up, we eat breakfast really quick then get to work. We had to vacume every room in the house. I had to vacume the bedrooms twice because I ""dont know how to vacume"". You could see footprints on the carpet so it wasnt good enough... Then i had to run the ""Clorox Ready Mop"" on the wood floors, wipe the baseboards (which I never really did, shhh) then scrub the kitchen floor b/c there ""was hair everywhere"". Then we were told to finish the scaloped potatoes but, sadly, we didnt... Ok so those are the wonderful happenings of my day...

Ill write later about the evening fun that is well deserved..."

"event","Ok well today, like every other day, was pretty boring until my Aunt and Uncle came home... When they finally did get home we went bowling. It was great fun. (Its also very nice to do something every night of the week... I looove it!) There were some kinda cute guys there during our second game... One had nice hair, but not so nice of a face (Yes, I know thats mean but its the truth!) The other was kinda cute, kinda not... Anyways, they had this really dumb handshake and at the end of it they pretended like they took a hit off of a cigarette then they touched eachothers arms and went ""ssss"" like they were burning eachother with the cigarette or something... It was quite amusing. Well the kinda cute, kinda not kid kept looking at me and I started to really suck during the second game... (Wonder why...) And well my Uncle came up to me and goes, and this I quote ""You need to keep your mind on the game, not in the guys pants""... Yes that was quite hilariouse... Ok well thats all for now!"

"event","Yes, well as you can see from the title, I, for one gloriouse day, was not deprived of the thing&nbsp;I love the most... ice!! Yesterday, my Uncle Larry, being the wonderful uncle that he is, took us ice skating at their local rink. I can surely say that I loved every minute of it... Well... Ok the only bad part was that their hockey skates sucked... they majorly needed sharpened... But, being greatful to be back on the ice, I made do with what I had. They have 3 rinks there and there were some guys playing roller hockey... How I loathed them... And I saw this chick dressed in full hockey attire.... Oh how I wanted to beat her, shove her in a closet, take her gear, and go play in her place... O:) hehe, Yes if I lived up here my uncle said he'd let me play... hmm... I should take that into consideration.. lol... Oh and afterwards we went and got ice cream, which I have been craving for a while now... It was indeed very yummy. Ok well thats all the happenings of yesterday..."

"event","<P>Where to start? Babysitting yesterday had its ups and downs. The ups were that I didn't have to wake up at 7:30 like I thought I had to. The next door kids spent the night over here so that was a plus. And I basically just read the entire time, which was good. The downside was that I had to watch them for a grueling 6 or 7 hours. That really sucked. But hey, I did make $20 so its not all that bad.</P>
<P>Today we (we as in my gram, the sibs, and me) are going to be leaving for <FONT color=#ffff66>Maryland</FONT> for a week to see our Aunt Monica, Uncle Larry (who is the coolest!), and our little cousin Alexis (she's so adorable). I have no idea what time we'll be leaving, my gram thinks around 2ish... There are 2&nbsp;downsides of this: 1) I'll miss being at Sarah's and Kayla and Jenna's houses. :'(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Band camp starts the Monday I get back, so I won't be able to spend all day with Kayla, Jenna, and Sarah. :'(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But band camp is 2 weeks long, so its not like I won't get to see them before school starts. We'll still have a week to spend some well deserved quality time together... Omg I'm acting like I'm married to these ppl, lol, oh well, I really do miss all of you guys!!!!!</P>
<P>Ok well I think that about wraps it up for now. I'm not sure if I'll be able to use the computer while I'm at my relatives' house. My gram might be all like ""No computer, you've been on it enough at home (meaning her house). Get outside and get some fresh air!!"" Hehe, I'm so mean... lol... but it is rather funny...</P>
<P>I shall talk to you people soon!! I love and miss all of you guys!!!!</P>

I have been there. You make the choice because is the right one, but, it makes you wonder why you are having to make this choice in the first place. Then sometimes you are glad you made the choice and sometimes you wonder why you did? 

Why do we end up in this position? 

Is it because we rush into things or don't see the big picture? Perhaps we refuse to see the truth.

No longer will I trust someones word. It will have to be earnt."

"event","I have been thinking alot lately about family and friends. I have thought about what breaks family ties and friendships. I have also thought about what brings people together. Isn't it strange it takes something small to change the dynamics of a relationship and it takes something big to get it back to normal! 

The boys and I have become closer than I thought possible in the last 6 months .. I always thought we were close but, after everything that has happened we are closer. I talk more to them about how I feel and what is going on and they talk to me about how they are feeling and trying very hard to do the right thing. 

Their Grand parents have been a huge support for both the boys and myself. 

In some ways I have lost a lot but in other ways I am much better off..."

If there is a chance it will work I want to try. Alot of people probably don't think that about me. No denying I made mistakes on the way but, at the end of the day it's true. 

I have realised that I end up in situations that does not have an easy solution so I spend most of the time trying to fight battles I have no chance of winning... I would rather just shut up and get on with it. But in the end I'm not happy and it's not just about me being happy... It's about me enjoying my life and the boys enjoying theirs. That's all I have ever wanted. 

Being on my own has given me that feeling. I can relax and spend time with the boys. I don't have the pressures of trying to keep someone else happy. Maybe I don't belong in a relationship. Maybe I don't have what it takes to be in one. Who knows. 

At the end of the day I don't know how much influence I have in my life.. Perhaps none

I have made some mistakes in my life and I have to live with the choices I have made. I also have made decisions that I felt needed to be made. I have been judged by many about these things and as I am crushed I have lost those friends, I understand that the friendship wasn't as bound as I once thought.

I think true friendship means you do not judge anyone, you support them no mantter what! 
However that is just my opinion and does not mean much!

I am waiting to see what happens in the future I hope it is a positive change. The boys and I are looking forward to a positive year.  It has been a rocky start butm now I have found my house we should be ready for 2009"

The saddest thing today is, Mushu was found on the side of the road today :(
Troy was crushed. Nothing worse when it comes to pets. 
He had to go to work today and when he comes home we are going to bury her. 

I have recently been told there are a number of people who don't think too highly of me for some reason!
Now, as much as this bothers me, I have had about a gut full of all this. Gees these people don't even have a reason to feel this way and if they did, it would be nice to know!

But, thats seems to be the problem, people cant just come up and say ""Im upset with you because.......""
For gods sake ... Teenagers. Funny enough it they all have one person on common... co-incendence perhaps ???

Head back to the car, now Im worried I havent heard from them... Where's my phone ? Oh no!

Bottom line.. It's gone! 

I am angry that I lost everything.. all the numbers, information, dates, times, etc. 

What angers me the most. Is that I try and help as many people as I can. If I find something I don't keep it. I try and find the owner, or take it in the police station. It would be nice to get that in return. 

I don't know where my head is at atm. 

No longer than 15 mnutes I have realised it's gone ... We head back to find the phone.

Tried to call it.. no answer... then straight to message bank bastards took the sim card out.

For some time I have been getting headaches. Now for someone who never gets headaches it is not cool.
On the rare occasion I did get a headache, 2 panadol off to bed and not long after I would be fine. 

Not any more....

Now they last from 1 to 2 days, I'm nauseas and the day after the headache has finally gone, I have no energy, tired, still feel nauseas and down. This is just dumb. I can't even funtion, I just switch off.
I have gone to the doctor they just put it down to stress *sigh* I'm not really under any stress though as I try and keep telling her.

So I have finally finished the grading books.... I think... 

Also .... Not doing enough now, I have just picked up work! I am not into the courier business (thought I would follow in savvy's footsteps.)
Starting tomorrow (Thursday) I now do 5 days a week, 8-3 :D 
It is daunting but, exciting at the same time. I havent been in the work force for a long time, since my boys were born.
The motivation behind it, is being up and about, extra cash, something to tie me over until I finish my cert 3 and 4 in fitness. 
 I kinda wished I did it earlier. Oh well .... At least I am doing it now.

Troy and I also have fallen in love with the idea of getting our bike license and buying 2 bikes. A bit scary, however, again exciting at the same time.

It looks like Troy as now came down with what I have had now... *sigh* it is never ending. 

I have given up on my endeavour to get the yard cleaned .. so I have decided to get a gardener in. Get it all done in a day I hope. Me waiting for Troy to do it and for me to have time to do it.. looks like it is not possible, especially now Troy looks as though he is getting sick.

I think the next generation is going to be alot softer than us.. and I think our generation are softer than the one before.  I remember mum and dad just constantly working. Mum inside and Dad outside.. and when mum was finished inside she would help outside.... I hardly ever seen them in bed sick. 
Now a days if the kids are sniffling they are sent home. What are we teaching them? If they are sick they stay at home. Do that in a work situation you would be sacked in no time.

I have had a lovely time with the computers for the oys in the last few days.... I had to do a full reinstall in one.. and they both were having issues.
So that is fun trying to find out what the problem is. Turned out it wasn't something I did ...
I am no way an IT professional, but, I am slowly getting there.
I still have alot to learn. I find the hardest thing is that people do things differently and in the IT world.. thats not a good thing. *sigh*"

Anyway, tournament tomorrow, in most ways I hope it is over quickly....
Roll on next week"

It was a good one.. I got alot of work around the house done. Had some quiet time on the computer and hung out with Mustang for a few hours, so yeah it was good. 
I never thought I would enjoy staying home so much.

I did some soul searching and came to the decision that I gotta change things. Try and be more positive, work that little bit harder, and prepare for the oncoming. 
I also need to get into better shape and I have to make the change. and work with the time I have. If I can't train as much as I want to, hopefully I can do other things.

NENTIKOBE... I did get your message. Hopefully Tuesday night will be a go. I will be in touch as to what the go will be for the night... perhaps the usual (we won't let troy pick the movie ! haha)

Well, I did front kick, round house kick, spinning 45, and sliding in turning kick.... then spent time the boufa (Jo) and it was the best session!... It is what I have missed for so long.

Once the grading was out of the way I was right ... 

I have missed the feeling of loving taekwondo and training. I came home tonight remembering how good it felt to train hard and practice on techniques. I was so happy.

Grading is over for George Town for another few months I have reduced the gradings this year to 3 instead of 4. We are going through a change at the moment and I think we need more time to perfect what we are doing.

I think some of my seniors have figured out what it is like to be a real black belt/senior belt, in a club. It is good that has happened.

There comes a time when you get tired of things. I have had alot of friendships in my time and the thing that hurts me the most is betrayal or loss of friendship. 

It is funny when you think you know people so well.... or that you think they are very close that you can talk about anything, and then the next thing everything changes in one foul swoop.... It is more dissapointing than anything else.

It has come to the point where it's the quality and not quanitity. 

We are lucky to have the friends we have... I don't think we will be looking to make any new friends in the future.  I know I know, you're reading this thinking these guys have serious issues .... It may seem like that, the bottom line is, I think, we are very helpful people when we can, we try and help people as much as we can..... but, then it is like we are no longer needed.

You know it only takes 1 or 2 bad things happen and you are not so keen to help out ...... However we will always be there for our friends even though we might not be in touch with them ... we are always thinking about you guys :) </lj-cut>

Anyway, Finally coming up from the flu, thank god... I hate being sick.
Things are going better, for the moment. 
We finally got our hot water cylinder in.. so no more leaks... now we have to do the floors.

Taekwondo is going flat out there is something always on these days. tournaments, gradings, fundraisers etc... gone are the days of the 2 lesson a week club. 

I am so impressed with the boys at the moment. They are acting so grown up at the moment and being really reasonable about everything...... The difference being I am home more I think..... I am not training as much as I used to... (which I am missing sooooo much) it's a catch 22.... I want to make sure the boys are happy, and that makes me happy.. but, there is still part of me that feels ...... old.... I am not as active as I want to be... and I have lost all motivation to do anything ..
Hopefully that will be a temporary problem.. *sigh* I dont like the way I am feeling at the moment..."

Troy and I were looking at prime real estate the other day. 
Now it's just getting the money to run a training centre at g town. I dont know if it is something that they need, but, it would be worth the shot. Worst case just for training. 
I joke about moving to george town .. I dont know if I could survive down there yet! lol
Would I be in town more than at George Town.... Its a thought.

I am preparing for my 4th Dan grading this year in October.... I am in 2 minds as to whether I should actually go for it under the circumstances. Seeing as I have plans for the following year. Might crap me off but, still there is respect there (sometimes I wonder why).

Troy managed to sit down and watch ALL yes ALL the Star wars movies, PLUS some Clone wars thingy. a good 12 hours of watching star wars.. (If only he would work as hard as he watches!) ....  Mustang was part of all this but piked 9 hours into it! Should have made him stay... me I was blissfully avoiding it all by jamming thank god!

Well time for me to go and check out a new gym opeining up! Hopefully it has some potential.
Pics next time mother :)

I think the club is going through a transition at the moment. It happens every now and then, things change, people change, new people arrive and find their way in the club etc.
Numbers are a bit quiet though, I am hoping it is because of winter. Having said that it is funny when you say 26 is a quiet night :)
We have alot of things going on within the club at the moment. tournament, gradings, school holiday programs, dinners and bowling. Gone are the days of just training and doing a comp here or there.

As of tonight I am refusing to go to Newstead as I no longer feel like I am part of the club anyhow.
I have not been training on Tuesday nights for the last 5 weeks as I have been helping clare out at Tunnak on thursdays (which everyone knows) and so now it's like I don't exsist.
The boys have been saying that they dont spend enough time with me, so I give up the training to be with them. I know that is the right thing to do, but, now I have lost my fitness, my enthusiasm, my dedication, my routine, and this was supposed to help make the home life easier. That has definitely not happened.

I usually help ben with the grading of his tiny's however after the weekend decided I better check in with Flan on that. It seems he had it all under control.. Brandi is there to help out. I am not sure if he is saying that to piss me off or not.. but, hate to tell him that doesnt work.
So that's fine... turns out ben was told he can grade them himself, that he is the instructor. That's all well and good to. It would, however, be nice to be told this.. the last message was, Brandi is there on Tuesdays all th tie so I am sure she will be fine. I will be i touch!
That was the last thing I heard.

Now some of my students want to get into competition. Which is great. The problem being is if they do want to go to comps, we are better staying with FnC, but, I dont know if I can.....
Peraps that is what they are trying to do... push me to the point where I quit and the students come to them
It is not a good sign when you cant trust your instructor.

Looks like it is in the pipe works for the big giant heads to receive more money from the external clubs.
It seems they are trying to not take any more grading fees now, but, they would like to see the FULL support of all the clubs and tournaments and other club functions...
Simply put  as long as the members turn up and pay their money, everything will be ok..... they will be making their contribution towards the ""services"" us instructors are sooo lucky to have.

So I have been asked to come up with other ideas as to how they will make more money from the external clubs that they dont teach without hitting the grading fees!... If you have any ideas I woiuld be interested to hear them.

She if finally settling in after a long and stressful week.

The reasons behind it ???? 
1. Try and keep order within the club
2. So I can put forward my expectations of the students without repeating myself
3. To fix those annoying little problems in a general sense.

Is it to be a bitch?? No not at all
Is it to stop having fun ??? No way.. everyone should know my moto... if not it is simple. If you dont have fun you wont learn!

Today was a hard day, Looking at a new gym to join, Health and fitness World is getting a bit tedious. *sigh* Checked out a few other places and I got it down to 2 other gyms so I had appointments. So 2 work outs at each gym today was a bit tiring. Having said that private BJJ session in between topped everything off beautfully :) I really struggled with BJJ today, just couldn't get most of the techniques right. Chris is a good instructor I really enjoy it. I was put off a little bit but, I have to remember that I dont have to pick everything up easily. that I am not an instructor in the art. I am a student.

Anyway, I liked the second gym more purely because of the trainer that I was talking to. He also does martial arts so it is nice to have someone who knows what you need. 

The gym I am going to at the moment is the cheepest, however its exspensive when you dont go to work out.
So I definitely need a change.

After the work out it is off to Tunnak to teach for Claire who needed me to cover for her. then the long drive home. (tunnak is near Hobart). A very long day and time for me to go to bed *sigh*

We have an emergency meeting. 
Basically the ""business"" fnc are running has gone over the threshold and now needs to pay GST.
sooo they think it is fair to up the lesson fees (that is apparently for our benefit) because they now have to pay gst on their lesson fees.
and us instructors have to hand over ALL .... yes ALL of our grading fees in return for that extra $1 p.p.

Now like I said I could be missing something... so I have a meeing... I ask: ""So I am a little confused if you get all the grading fees it amounts to an average 10,000 (and thats the minimum) if you are over dont you only need about half that.
""yes"" the rest is for wages .......
riiiiiiiiiight.

So it turns out that 50% of all the grading fees go to GST and the other 50% goes to them to help run an office... 
Here are some figures.. I have it wrong by all means tell me... everyone else is going for it.. why is it only me saying . hang on!!!!

week 1- 10 students train with the extra $1 per person I will be making an extra $10
week 2 - 8 people train I make an extra $8
week 3 - 9 people train I make an extra $9
week 4 - 7 people train I make an extra $7
Total increase per month $34
(it is not like everyone is there every week)

grading time (same deal not everyone grades)
grading 1- 8 students grade 
8 students
25x8 = 200
40% = $80

grading 2
10 students
25x10 = 250
40% = 100.00

grading 3
10 student
25x10 = 250
40% = 100

grading 4 
9 student
9x25 = 225
40% = $90

grading total 100+100+80+90
Total $370 / 11 months of the year
= $33.6
 If I have totally lost you .. this is the short of it.
we are meant to profit by this.. by getting a pay rise *weekly*
an extra $1 per student. We are in fact meant to get more overall then the amount of our grading fees. 
As you can see with this example that lesson wise I made an extra $34
and as you can see I made $33.6 per month on grading fees.

Fees arent the real issue.. It just doesnt sit right. I dont feel comfortable with it.
we are giving them an extra %30 to them for letting us run a class...... no sorry, I meant to help fund the office..
No doubt Jude does alot of work .. and she should get paid... however, 30% of my income? 
%30 of the income over 15 clubs?
and I am the only one not happy....."

Training has been busy we are getting huge numbers which is exciting. I just hope everyone is getting something out of the training that I am offering. All the classes are having minimum 30 students.
Sat was the Lauren Burns seminar. I only gt to see about 45 minutes of the seminar. From what I had seen though I thought it was pretty good. 

Then off I went with Andrew to Deloraine to pick up Allen, then, off to Ulverstone to do a seminar for doctors. I never thought I would ever be teaching doctors self defense. Do you know about 2/3 of doctors are assaulted each year!!!! I didnt realise.

Apparently the regional manager was impressed and has the power to get this seminar available all over the state... and... all over Australia! WOW!!!! 

She did follow that up with ""But, the wheels take a long time to get moving, however we will get there eventually!""

That's ok I am patient.

Hmmmm was else has been going on. 
The club, I think, have seen the light. Last week we had a lot of fun. It was good  that everyone enjoyed themselves. I hope that continues.

Everything has been put on hold with the renovations.. Paint stripping is a bitch! I am telling you. 
So until that is finished nothing else is going to be finished.

"event","I was preparing to go to tournament Sunday, and I received a phone call... A friend has passed away in a motorbike accident. 
It makes you really think about life when something like this happens.
Zac was full of life, all he wanted to do was enjoy it, and he made the most of it.
He was so young.... he was 21 ..and it makes you realise how petty it is to complain about things... It is a shame that is takes something so devastating to realise this. 
I went to the funeral and there were so many people they could not fit inside the building... 
*thinks*... sometimes it doesn't make sense."

"event","Being an instructor is awesome! I love seeing my students/clubs grow, members being there for each other, gradings being strong and students enjoying their training.
Mike always said that there is always 5% of being an instructor which sucks and he is dead right.
However, sometimes I feel it is more than 5% I deal with and I think why is that so?
Do I get involved in situations that do not really have any effect on me?
Or am I expected to deal with situations that do not concern me?
Where does the friend line  start and the student line finish? (That one I thought was simple.... On the floor  you are a student off the floor you are a friend).. I have always lived by that rule.. but sometimes people can force you into a situation where you just do not want to be,.... then what?
All I want to do is enjoy instructing and not have to worry about who is going to be upset tonight.... Which side am I supposed to take now? ... what do I have to do to keep everyone happy, and I know that is not possible?
Sometimes it is so stressful that I feel physically ill !! I am not sure why.. is it because I cant let anything go and I have to try and fix situations that I have no control over... Is it too much to ask to just to taekwondo???? Sometimes I think it is. 
I want nothing but for my clubs to be close.. that we support each other as a whole, no matter what, that all my seniors are there for the next generation of students coming through not just  themselves.That is part of it.
*sigh*..... I, to, want the old club back"

"event","Well... it has been a very busy week for me.

I have been busy working on redecorating the house at the moment. The house is now white (just the undercoat). I hjave fixed up all the holes, painted the walls and the ceiling. *sigh*  Thanks sooooooooo much for Jude coming up and giving me a hand to help paint. For most of it though it has been my little project. 

Now I have to start peeling of paint (yay).... I really cant wait for it to be finished.. Everytime I start a project, it takes me 3-4 days to recover.. the house is like a bomb has hit it.

I hope the colour scheme will work out though... fingers crossed.

I have been offered an awesome opportunity this week. I have begun taking on doctors seminars, no I am not becoming a doctor, I am teaching them self defense (yes I know, something I wouldn't have expected to do myself). After talking to the co-ordinator of the event, she informs me that she has been sending out my name not just statewide but NATIONWIDE!.. OMG  this could mean the possibility of travelling over Australia taking on these seminars. I hope it just all works out that I have the opportunity and the chance to go.

Not much happening on the Taekwondo front... we finally got back into our own hall after 3 months of waiting. The big giant heads have gone back to normal, and my way of thinking has not changed.

That's something that annoys me. I don't like change, and sometimes do not have the courage to take the leap and risk it. I am glad that I am a safe person, however, it can be frustrating at times!"

"event","Well this weekend has been a hectic one.
This weekend we had a ""young instructors program"". At Beaconsfield. We had to be there by 9am this morning (thanks mustang).. I woke  up dreading the day ahead and noticed my achillies (excuse the spelling) tendon had tempoarily stopped working. 
I loaded up the car, (which is going remarkably well), and off we went. 
The day wasn't too bad... 4 hours later we finished training and headed back to town.

I am not sure of the temperature, but, I know that when I got home that was the end of me. Standing in the pool really eased off the tendons making me feel like I was an old woman, they started easing up.

So the plan was for a group of us to go to smithon tonight for a seminar tomorrow for the doctors assoc. Which in the end was cancelled. So instead of that was a get together at george town to have a bbq. At the time sounded like a great idea. By the time we were ready to head off.. I was feeling blah! so to not ruin the night I opted to stay home.

After watching tv, sleeping (which is something I do not do often), I woke up refreshed but still ...... It was like a hangover but not ... 

So now, I am full of energy the tendons are fine (go figure)... Now I am looking round to do something.. go figure.

What a great way to spend a night.. by yourself... Alot of people may not enjoy it.. but, I know that I do"

"event","Ok Im all for this karma thing ... but, its getting to be the same as to when the big giant heads are really nice to me.. usually something bad is going to come out of it.

We have had a brilliant start of the year.. I received finance for my car.. it will be ready to pick up on Thursday (weeeeee) I am doing everything to it friday (make sure everything is working properly.

I bought an archway a few days ago.. and it fits perfectly on the deck that is getting there slowly.

hmmm I would buy a tatts ticket.. but I dont want to get too greedy, it might stop! lol

Whoever is responsible for this.. thank you... it is something that I wanted needed before I went totally crazy.

Mike called me today asking my opinion on a matter. That is just scaring me and I proceeded to tell him so! How am I meant to keep up y bitch status if I have to be nice to him! gees! how inconciderate!

As much as I want to believe that they mean everything they say... I am always curious as to their motivations behind their actions.

*fingers crossed* hope all this keeps up... but, the main thing is that we are happy with what we have (which I am) and dont become greedy."

"event","Well how excited was I today... Found a car.. and thought what the heck I will have a go at financing .... and the loans been approved! ... WOW.. its been like 10 years since I have the opportunity for that  happened.. Who ever says money doesn't make you happy obviousy is hard to please.

So far all our bills are paid for.. we have got furniture and no deck.. *sigh* To be financially secure was always something that I wanted.. that's all... Troy tells me off all the time for not ""wanting anything""... I dont think I am demanding when it comes to material things. I am demanding on other ways! lol

So tomorrow I am looking at buying a Lancer.. Hopefully it is a car of my dreams.
I hope......."

"event","Well we are finally back from camp and it was soooo cooool!
Even though it rained for most of the time we were there we were very happy with the result of the camp.

Going from comments of the students there seem to be a good mixture of training and time frame.
We trained for 5 hours on Sat which was cool and trained for 2 and a half hours today. total 8 hours. Not including the 3 hours training on Friday and the 3 hours they will be training tomorrow ... OH I LOVE MY CLUB!

Today was excellent.. we trained on a beach! Working on endurance and muscle development we did drills like wading through water, draggin someone behind you through water, working as a team to get everyone to the end .. balancing in water, hand actions under water..

The most surprising thing about the day was that when we got down there it was raining and miserable no sun to be seen, owever, it wasnt cold, but, for some reason we all got burnt!! Our faces are that red .. Like the colour of my hair! lol

But all in all it was a great time. I hope to do it again it was really exciting .. whether it be the George Town/beacy clubs or all of us its going to be great fun!"

"event","Omg can it get any muggier!! *sigh* I hate this heat.. Im all sticky and yucky *ugh*

I wonder what the temp will be over the weekend I bet rain rain and more rain! *sigh* 

I hope the camp comes togther.. Im going through the ""can I do it stage."" I am a bit nervous as to the plan of the day and is it going to be successful.. am I going to do the right things... What are we going to do when we are not taekwondoing!.. *mild panic attack* I'm sure it will come together on the day..... I hope fingers, toes and anything else crossed.

We fixed the car AGAIN today... Hopefully it will be the last time. It better be good to me now cause monday night I was determined to have a car by the end of the week.

We decided to test drive some cars today from a car yard. Well, needless to say it did leave an impression on me thats for sure.
The first car was a Honda... It didnt have much grunt even though it was a 4 cyl, the right indicator was a bit dicky and half way through the test drive, it got a flat battery. So i got a lift back to the yard he came back with me to jump start the car and we took it back to the yard .... $7,999 for this car I mind you!

Second car a Lancer Sports... not bad I guess.. still not what I was looking for.

Third car (and these are all from the same car yard) was a suburu wagon $10, 999 for this car.. Took it on the outlet.. up the hill and I didnt get over 80km/s *shakes head* then it has a little button on the dash saying ""check engine."" So for the trip back to the car yard begging not to blow up the car before I get there.....

Sometimes you just have to be careful."

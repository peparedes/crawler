I went out with Chris for 6 months and a week or so.
I liked Buzzi for a while.
But that didn't work out, long, sad story.
He just hurt me too much, that's all (emotionally).
I like Corey.
He's such a muffin.
He's taking me out for Valentine's Day, Wednesday.
I'm rather excited, actually.

so it's not called a liperette.
but that's okay.
when you get the ring around your lip.

that's what i'm getting done.
and i was turned down yesterday.
by the piercing guy because corin isn't my legal guardian.
reh.

so i talked to my mom about it.
she said that i could.
and i'm getting it done tomorrow.
yays.

i asked when my mom was gonna take me since it was 11-6pm.
she freaked out said she was going to a meeting and then the beach.
and i was like but mahh and tried to explain this;

the fact that she's always out
from either 9 or 10 in the morning until 2 to 3 in the morning the next day.
leaving travis && i alone at the house.
eating cereal for meals, yum.
i mean don't get me wrong, i love cereal,
but i just wish i could have a meal with my mother and brother.
you know?
that's how we do it at dad's house.
dad... that's another story.
anyways.
she flipped out on me.
and i started crying cause she's NEVER home since like october.
she never spends time with us.
and doesn't do anything for us.
and she started calling me a baby.
and saying that she hopes that my dad legit kills me for my lip.
and saying that i was selfish or something.
and i was like no you can't even take time out of your life.
for your kids, you'd rather be with your stupid friends and fred.

okay do you know what this makes me feel like,
a rejected parent from their teenager.
i mean come on fucking seriously!

ugh.
i hate life.
and i have a feeling that my dad might, just might disown me
for my lip getting pierced.
or something worse.
who really knows.

he hates that i am myself...
life sucks...

and the fact that i have 5 people.
that i'm kindof interested in.
and i listed the pros and cons.
but the person... with the most pros that i might try for.
and give a chance to...
parents hate me, and are WICKED strict.
and it would be weird.
and i don't think that it would work out because of his parents.
but, try, maybe?
idk, i'm not gonna go out with anyone.
but i guess swinging.
whatever a swinger does?
maybe, idk.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
ugh.
sure.
whatever.

I'm friends with Sheila again.

I'm out of the band that wasn't even really a band.

So that's okay.
Uhm, helped Travis out yesterday.
When some kid named David was blaming him for something.
That's on a game that you can play with your friends.
Which I thought was stupid, so I spazed out on the kid.

For being a jerkoff and getting Travis pissed.
I hate craypa's!
The scedules are weird.

and like was basically in shock and it was kindof scary
and it looked like it killed and then there was pennies all over my trampoline
and i got pissed because i hate pennies so i was whiping them in my neighbors yard
then we all came inside at dark and played guitar and hung out

until they all left at 9 and then evan called and i was helping him out
and then i was talking to brian online and we were getting to know each other
until about 11 something then that's when i went to bed because i was POOPED

"event","<center>so like, this morning; &hearts;

computer; got new seats. listened to my headphones.

mathworkshop; jimmy and i were ignoring sheila. then she started crying, so he gave in and talked to her.

science; got a study, they had spanish food or something in there and soda. there was no more cups left so i drank out of the siera mist 2 liter bottle, =) they had good cookies and cinnomon snack things.

english; double, cosmon was there, or however you spell her name. we had to do packets and we listened to our headphones. i was pissed and there was nothing i could do about it. so hogan was trying to help me out and i was like, no.  cause i didn't understand how it would help. then he kept asking me if i was okay and i was like no, because when i'm wicked mad and i can't do anything about it i cry to let out my anger and i wasn't about to do that in school.

lunch; jimmy told sheila that i didn't want her to talk to me because i was mad. he told me that she was like FUCK HER. then next thing you know, she's outside on the bench crying about it. then ethan pushed me and i went flying into hogan so i grabbed his shoulders so i wouldn't have a body collision with him. then i told jimmy and jimmy and him were gonna fight, so then i put my hand on jimmy's stomach and pushed him gentley and said not to. then shantal was calling him a pussy because i wouldn't let him fight him. then hogan was like yeah well, you have red hair! it was funny. then jimmy kept picking me up and i couldn't breathe when he did it.

algerbra; wrote notes back inforth to katey. then we just started talking, i let jon listen to my ipod. dude i was SO happy at one point when she said something, i couldn't stop smiling, lol.

art; had a nice talk with lorraine about sheila, lol

aw, hogan is still worried about me. even though i'm insisting that i'm great now, because of what was said in algerbra.

"event","<center>yeah, so why does everyone always have something to say about who i like this year?
when i liked chris, they made fun of him.
when i liked jordan, they made fun of him.
when i liked mike, they made fun of him.
when i liked corey, they talked shit about him.
when i like brian, they make fun of him.

why does this always have to happen, why can't anyone besides;
hogan, miranda, dave, dan, and allison not care for who i like.
jesum crow.
i'd just like respect, the respect i give them, that's all i'm asking.

sheila's been ticking me off, over anyone else though.
calling me a crush stealer, SHE HAS A CRUSH ON EVERY BOY ON EARTH.
gees!
she said that she saw him first, i saw him with hogan at lunch a LONG time ago.
didn't know him, thought he was kind of cute, but never said anything.
it's not like it matters anyways because she's a attention-whore and a slut.

i was talking to joe today and she got jealous and started stomping on his foot.
and took out his necklace and said it was cute.
okay he told me to make sure that she never touched him again.
i'm finally realizing why no one likes her.

i'm ignoring her tomorrow, and i'm glad and excited.
i mean, she ALWAYS makes me go to her locker and the bathroom with her.
why? because she's scared of lorraine and colette and people.

okay, now that that's off my chest;

computer; didn't really do anything we're gonna have new seats though

mathworkshop; sheila pissed me off when she pissed jimmy off. it's so stupid, she thinks she's cool just because she knows people from chelsea.

science; miranda, sheila, and i were walking through the spanish hallway and miranda said, ""he's in that room right there!"" and as soon as we got up to the door, he's laying on desks, which was adorable to me for some reason, and funny, but i ran anways.

history; we had a pizza party and devon couldn't have any pizza because she didn't bring in her form. i felt bad.

lunch; i started talking to andrew more and ignored sheila some more. she was getting jealous too.

english; showed hogan the song, i wanna show him all my other crap from last year too, so i'm gonna do that tomorrow in english double. plus i wrote allison a note.

art; got my feelings kindof stepped on. and i think that i pissed off joe.

and my head hurts. and i'm tired and still pissed!!"

Carter Lane was to the right, just a little turn.

Mike and I saw Jared, Jose, and Tony.

I had Sully open the window all the way since I was stuck sitting with him.

I barely talked to Mike today, like at all.
He called my cell, but it came as a missed call because I need a new cell phone.

I went to Maine to see my Papa and cousins.
I stayed at my cousins and hardly saw my Papa.
Whenever I stay with my cousins, I pick up akward lingo.
Such as <i>Sally</i>, <i>Bird</i>, <i>Mobious</i>, and <i>Punched it</i>.

So don't mind me talking foolish like that, it's hard not to pick up.
It especially doesn't help me.
Since my accent sounds sortof like a New York/Boston/Maine accent.
It makes me sound wicked stupid, but that's okay.

Dylan kept asking me if I hated him, how could I hate my favorite cousin?
This morning I woke up with Digger sleeping next to my foot, their evil cat.
I accidentally kicked her because I didn't know what it was.
Then she was being all nice to me, she is <i>so</i> bipolar.

I played Nascar 2003 on their PS2, HOLLY PLAYED VIDEO GAMES FOR ONCE.
Woah, woah.
Dan, Carrie, and Evan left to go to their mom's house for the rest of the week.
I missed them, not too much of Daniel though, we never really talk that much.

So, I didn't really do much today, other than talk to Mike on the phone most of the time.
Fred and Dana came over.
My mom invited me to go out with them, and invited Mike as well.
He could come, I wouldn't be alone, since Dana's nine and all.

Picked up Mike, then some dude named John.
Got into the parking lot and saw the other John, I <b>hate</b> that John.
John, thy devil.
So we were there for a while.

I ran down the isle, it was wicked dark, there was two figures at the end.
Scared the living shit out of me, I ran super fast back to Mike at the other end.
I hid behind him and felt like I was gunna cry.
The figures looked like two people just standing there, though they were trees... -is embarrassed a bit.-

Then we were writing on the white board and such, ate.
Mike spilled his Pepsi on his food and the table when he brought it over.
I told him I would have gotten it for him.
Fred called my mom <i>Honey</i> again.

Gosh I wanna knock him out badly!
Then Dana was wicked tired, so we had to bring her home.
In the car, my mom told us we were gunna drop off Mike then me.
It was only 8:57 (I checked), we were supposed to drop him off at 9:30.

Don't ever go telling a kid a certain time then shortening it.
I only saw him for an hour, obviously this upset me, it was like teasing me.
Since my mom was like pushing him away from me, practically, anyways.
I got upset, as predicted.

But in the car when we were leaving the place, I was <i>freezing</i>, so Mike kept me wicked warm in the car.
Now, I need to paint my nails, but I'm not in the mood.
-Sneezes.-
Uhm I don't know if Mike's gunna call... but whatev, right?"

Uhm, Jimmy had like Dan in a headlock or something rather.
I got up and punched them both at the same time in the back.
Dan with my left, Jimmy with my right, it was sick.
After Joe saw that he said that I know how to control things, since they stopped instantly and all.

I kicked Hogan in the balls because he was saying how he was taller than everyone, and I was shorter than everyone (that was standing right there).
So I was all, "" 'Ey!"" -Kicks Hogan in the nuts.-

Okay this is when I got mad/upset.
Someone made Cookie come out from underneath my bed.
She got wicked scared and didn't know where to hide.
Everyone started screaming like crazy, she got more scared.

How the fuck can you be afraid of a fricken cat!?!!
She hid in a small place between my wall and arm of the couch.
I thought that I was going to cry.
<b>She's my life, like Mike, Joe, and Sheila. <3</b>

Then Katey spilled the M&M's.
Smooshed one on the floor too.
Claimed Cookie bit her.
Cookie doesn't bite.

I never want to see M&M's out of their package again.
They were everywhere.
7/9 of the bag was spilled.
Cookie only came back out when it was only me, Sheila, and Hogan.

Hogan got laid.
My lai fell off my wall, so I threw it around his neck.
Told him he got laid.
It was great, haha.

Uhm yeah, then it was just me and Hogan.
He's an animal lover, hehe.
I didn't expect that from him.
He's different outside of school.

This just in:

My new nickname, is Crazypants.

~Compliments of Hogan.

We were driving in downtown (somewhere).
We had to stop because it was sort of like downtown Reading, but it wasn't Reading.
So the streets were complicated.
I saw a clown, with purple hair.

The car was stopped near him.
I shoved my face into Mike's chest.
I bawled my eyes out for like 10 minutes.

HORRIBLE.
Then my mom like told her friend.
I felt majorly stupid.
Sheesh.

Today my mom took Mike and I out.
Fred came -stab stab.-
Met Freddy, Fred's son.
Went out to Friday's with Mike, Dana, my mom, and Fred.

I answered WHAT (mean way).

Later in the day, Brittany called and said happy birthday too.
Then Matt did too.
I like need it to be summer so I can go down to NC and see them!! =(

He didn't want me to get introuble again or have something happen to me though.
So I just hid out away from my house.

Then my dad, Travis, and I went to AREI or something like that to get the beast a gift.
The beast is Anothny because he's my arch-enemy.
Dropped off Travis at Anthony's.
Went to CompUSA and saw the same dude that sold me this laptop.
Koowah, that dude's pretty awesome, so I got a thumbdrive for computer class.

Got dropped off at Mike's.
When we were walking to his mom's car when they were going to drop me off;
He put his hat on me so I wouldn't get rain in my face.
And he put his jacket over my head so that it wouldn't go down my shirt and such.
He's such a sweetheart.

Since my birthday is this up-coming monday, I got away with something.
=)
In science we're gunna have a huge test on my birthday.
=(
But whatev, right?

Goldman was looking for the date that we were going to have the test on.
I was thinking to myself, 'Not Monday, not Monday. Please-.

'Monday is the day of your test.'

""Mrs. Goldman! Can we please not have it on Monday.
Monday's my birthday. And I have a huge science test on Monday too.'

'Okay fine we can have it on Tuesday because it's your birthday.'

-Bites hand out of excitement of getting out of a test for a day.-

Uhm that's about it."

"event","<b>Computer;</b>
Substitute, went on AIM.
I threw a note to Jimmy for him to tell Joe to go on.
After that class Joe said that I got off as soon as he got on.

<b>Mathworkshop;</b>
Don't really remember it that much.

<b>Science;</b>
Drew little pictures for Sheila to cheer up.

<b>History;</b>
Worked on a giant time line with Sheila, Jennell, Mark, and Brittany.
Sheila, Jennell, and I talked about our sucky experiences with boys.
Mhm, after lunch we went galavanting around the school a bit before the end of lunch came.
First we got in there wicked early and I got hyper so I threw my water bottle at the ceiling.

<b>English;</b>
Passed notes to Jimmy most of class.

<b>Art:</b>
Pretty much a normal day.
Talked to Laurie-Ann and Joe.
Andrew bugged me.
Got a hug from Joe, ect.

After school I went to the eye doctor.
It took forever, the assistant was like a fricken rapist.
Looked like Mr. Kitchen too, *shivers.*
Then Mike called from Travis' cell when they were on the late bus.
I told him I had to go though because you're not supposed to be on the phone there.

Now I can't wear my contacts for a while because I got my eyes dialated.
I got a note from them saying that I can't do my homework though.
So that's good.

My mom pissed me off.
You don't even wanna know, ew.
So I ran out the door screaming I hated her and she was immature.
I was only in my socks, jeans, and tee shirt.
Cold.

Can't wait for the 10th. =|"

Went down to the library to use laptops.
Didn't really do anything in there.

Sheila came up with a wicked scam.
It's great.
We might be able to pull it off too, if it's a miracle.
If not it was <i>so</i> worth the attempt.

Got sent down to guidance to get retard sheets.
Even though that's just what we call them.
It's because I have too many F's and they're mad.
Whatever.
Unwanted secrets were released.
Whatever though I don't care anymore."

"event","Yesterday I went to Miike's house. Him and Chris kept fighting. Then it was him and Gavin.

When he was fighting Gavin, he caught Gavin looking at my butt.
Then a while later when I was sitting there and they were attacking each other on the bed, Gavin put his head on my boob.
So then I was all, okay no.
I got up and just stood there.

I forget what he did, but Mike did something really mean to Chris when they were fighting so I slapped him in the leg.
Then whenever I thought that he was getting out of hand with them, I'd tickle him because it's his biggest weakness.
But I felt bad when Gavin whipped a ball at Mike's nuts.

In the car ride home Mike was wicked cute.
He started dancing to the music.
It was adorable and I was trying not to smile, though I couldn't help it.

I love him."

"event","Hm lets see. I went with my mom to pick up Mike. Then my sister and Maria were here again. My mom, and Corin started fighting about something, yelling and screaming. So then I got up and went to see what was going on.

Before I even got in there I heard what was going on.
Corin is going to get rid of Monty.
Okay, we got Monty when I was four.
I grew up with him until I was 12 when Corin took him to live with her.
My mom didn't want her to give him to this dude that used to stalk her or something when my mom and dad were dating.
Then I started crying because he's my dog too, I got make up all over Mike's shirt.
I felt bad for that though.

But it's not our fault that we have a small house and Monty is really big.
So we can't take him, as much as we'd like to, we can't.
And yeah I'm too lazy to write out everything else.

But I got to punch Dave in the stomach because he kept saying that I worshiped the devil, that I was a punk. Then when I was listening to my music he was like; loser, loser, loser. So then I was like ugh okay maybe he's talking to me. Then I look around and he was like LOSER. So then I was like shut up or I'm gunna punch yuh.

How come all guys want girls to try to hurt them like that?
Wow.
Anywho, I punched him.
Then I told him not to tighten his muscles then he was like NO I DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOCK THE WIND OUT OF ME! Then he went outside."

Then when I came home Mike was here and my sister Corin and her friend Maria. After Mike left Corin called Dave, this dude that she likes and he likes her back.  Then I drew a picture of stick figures and made them kiss and said that it was her and Dave.  Then Maria and I were teasing her wicked badly, it was great.

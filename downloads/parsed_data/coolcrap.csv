i cant wait!its gonna feel so different, but yet at the same time there is no greater sense of familiarity...........

""Got Me Waiting""

[Verse 1]
Just when I thought I found me 
Someone I can go with just 
When I thought I found me
Someone I can go with that's
When my girl friend came to 
Me said she told me that nigga 
Ain't nothing I seen him in the
Club acting like he wont no
Where around that's when I 
Found out that you was nothing
For me and all the love that you 
Said that you had
It turned out to be fonny and 
I done gave you the best part 
I don't know what else I can
Do to turn you around nooooooo 

[Chorus]
You got me waiting you got me waiting 
When I am telling you everything you 
Need to hear like baby come now you 
Got me waiting but I can't keep waiting
On you acting like whatever I will always 
Be around cause you think that you 
Something like a pimp you can hang in 
These streets and it will be all right with 
Me ohhh baby now you got me waiting
But I can't keep waiting on you ohh

[Verse 2]
Look at me and tell me now if
I can be the last one that that
You think about thinking you 
Can keep running out my life 
My life my life why is its so 
Hard for you to pick up the phone
And call me put a little time in for 
Me to show that you really care for
Me remember how you used to say 
That nothing comes before me you 
No it was a lie because you put your 
Boys before me promises promises 
Made and broken still I keep 
Holding on thinking you would that notice that 

[Chorus]
You got me waiting you got me waiting 
When I telling you everything you need 
To hear like baby come now you got me 
Waiting but I cant keeping waiting on you 
Acting like whatever I will always be
Around cause you think that your something
Like a pimp and you can hang in these streets 
And it will be all right with me but baby you 
Got me waiting and I cant keep waiting on you 

[Bridge]
There comes a time in every mans life 
Where he has to do everything his girl
Likes because if he don't choose to 
Play by the rules I am sure there's 
Somebody else out there who just would love 
Too do me hold me go the extra mile 
Like you did when you was trying to 
Get to no me do me hold me treat me
Nice and show me all the things you
Forgot to show me cause 

[Chorus]
You got me waiting got me waiting
When I am telling you everything 
You need to hear like baby come
Now you got me waiting but I cant 
Keep waiting on you acting like 
Whatever cause I will always be 
Around cause you think that your 
Something like a pimp you can hang in
These streets and it will be all right with
Me you got me waiting but I cant keep waiting on you"

I LOVE..LOOOOVE COLLGE..fucking LOVE IT!i still miss everyone from back home.notice how im refering to singapore as home.it took me a while to accept that.then i grasped it.i have two wonderful places to call home.im lucky that way..and anyone else who has dual citizenship..actually i have one citizenship and a PR ship..but still the same concept.so much has happened since i got here. ive become more independant and wise i think.and ive realized the importance of family and friends.not that i dint appreciate them before.but when ur so far from home..ur friends here really become like ur family.dunt worry shaiz,C..u guys are still my best.nothing and nobody's ever changing that.*kiss*
ok i have class right now..so ill update more stuff later."

"event","WOW! i cant believe how long ive ignored this thing.a WHOLE month!well neways..i LOVE college.seriously, ive made friends with some really cool ppl and thats what keeps me going.cuz classes r a lil stressful!im having a love hate relationship with my philosophy and business class.they're interesting..but soo exhausting!i devote all my time to those TWO classes.its ridiculous!i have nightmares abt them. next semester im taking psychology so that should be a lil easier.im soo tired and sleepy i know what im writing wont make sense to me if i read it tom.mmm....for business we're playing this strategy game and its basically managing a shoe industry andits really cool. u earn revenue and right now our turnover has been 35 million dollars!WAHOOO!and when i found out..i got soo excited, my friend had to calm me down saying ""its just a game..its not even real money..""..pffff! he's such a party pooper! there i was feeling all elated abt my....errr...OUR millions and he just ruined the whole moment.
ooh i have a crush!yes!this guy named daniel.he's venezuelan and has such a fantastic smile...so dreamy and he has dimples too.its like a *ting* moment when he smiles.sighhhhh..atleast im over u know who..well kinda...maybe i should call him..ugh..nevermind...forget i said that.
i hate the weather..im having HUGE issues with it.its really pretty coz all they leaves are changing colour and when the sun's shining they actually seem to glow..but when u get out there..and the wind slaps u in the face with harshness..and ur eyes begin to water cuz the cold air is stinging them..ur not really thinking abt the pretty trees and whatnot.ur cursing the weather!!!ok u know what..im fallinga sleep while i type this..im gonna do this later when im not feeling so dead."

A BIRD SHAT ON ME TODAY!ugh!yuck!i cant beginn to describe what it has done to me!i've never been more traumatized..and it has left me completely scarred for life!i will NEVER be able to look at a BIRD or SHIT the same way again...sigh
on a more enthusiatic and happy note..i love INDIA!ive been going out to all these great restraunts and what not.ooh..OOOH let me tell u abt the flight.YESSS..i flew air india..yes you laugh!but admist my own misery..i fell in LOVE.for a brief few hours.omg..OOH MY GOD!the male flight attendant who was serving us was sooo fantastic!i mean honestly i totally forgot who varun was.this man..yes man..whateverrr.he was soo good looking and uhuh...i know now what love feels like...or lust..whichever..its was soo overwhelming!i couldnt stop thinking abt him..actually i still get a lil butterfly flutter..even now.sigh!and even my mom admitted he was fab looking.i cant really pick one thing.he had a really cool indian accent.the kind i like..and he was funny!smart..actually i kinda wonder what he's doing as a flight attendant..neways,i was talking to him for like an hour or something.but yet he had this shyness...and the BEST eyes....if i ever came to know what love at first sight would be..this..sigh....then this would be....

"event","Is it love tonight
When everyone's dreaming
Of a better life
In this world
Divided by fear
We've gotta believe that
There's a reason we're here
There's a reason we're here

'Cause these are the days worth livin'
These are the years we're given
And these are the moments
These are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

See the truth all around
Our faith can be broken
And our hands can be bound
But open our hearts and fill up the emptyness
With nothing to stop us
Is it not worth the risk?
Is it not worth the risk?

'Cause these are the days worth livin'
These are the years we're given
And these are the moments
These are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

Even if hope was shattered
I know it wouldn't matter
'Cause these are the moments
These are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

We can't go wrong
Thinking it's wrong
To speak our minds
I've gotta let out what's inside

Is it love tonight
When everyone's dreaming
But can we get it right?
Yeah but can we get it right?

'Cause these are the days worth livin'
These are the years we're given
And these are the moments
These are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

Even if hope was SHATTERED
I know it wouldn't matter
These are the moments
These are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives"

"event","i am at a loss for words.i just dont have anything to say.the life i've lived uptill now has come to an end.exams are over and done with.draduation is a day away and school got out a while back.its like all these chapters in my life have come to an end.and its been good, for the most part.and ive finally said goodbye to HIM.CC harshly but accurately put it ""its over..thats it.he's moved on.you've got to accept,ther's nothing more you can do.just aCCEPT IT!"".thanx C,i needed to hear that.i've lost him, but i never really had him in the first place.
im glad i made the friends i did.they've provided me with the kind of fullfillment that couldnt be replaced by family or good tv.but there r two people who have been there for the most part.shaiz and C.

candice-gosh!where do i start.so0 much!u've been there with me throughout(literally).and u've been one of the bestest and truest friends.im glad i have u in my life., and i hope i always will.i cant recall one particular moment and gush about it, coz there have been sooo many great ones.i wouldnt know where to start.blood may be thicker than water,but u r the exeption to that very rule.u've been my therapist when others have been busy..lol
shiaz-u've been away two years and a lil longer, but you've been there for the important bits.when i needed you..whoever thought those riduculous housep-ractices for isabel would be the begining of a beautiful friendship? so many great laughs,untill tears ran down my cheeks.thats what u've been.now with university down the road, it maybe harder for us to keep in touch.but hey!if we dint let a damn country seperate us,i aint gonna let a continent!

this ones for the two of you.my longest most cherished friends.i LOVE you LOADS and will MISS YOU guys."

"event","what a day!somethimes things happen when i least expect it.see we had these people come over for dinner and yes!HE was one of those people.coz we have this childhood friend who moved to the states and now hes back for some internship or sumthing.so my mum invited prash over,but she invited all our other family friends and kids over as well, coz prshant was close to the guys and all...
so im all whining coz i wanted to be alone today, u know??chill and all...but my mum was like how can u be sooo selfish..we are seeing prashant after soo long..u dont have to be so arrogant..blaaah di blaaaaaaaaaah  
right whatever!so i calmly told my parents that i was not to be disturbed coz i had my exams and that i needed to study..and if i dint do all that well it would be their fault coz they had kept on nagging me to talk to all these people..well it kinda worked, coz my dad took my side and was like ""munni, leave her alone.she needs her 'alone' time""..
but then when my dad came into my room like 7.30ish to let me know people had arrived.SO i had to switch topics(from peters sweet ass..heh) and start talking utter rubbish about bonding and stochiometry with alex(cuz i was on the phone..DUH),but i was also painting my nails, and while trying to hide it from my dad's sight, it ended up spilling on my bed.SHIT!i now have a bedspread with a bright red bob and it STINKS!
see i hate this..i mean i study..i know i study.but YET i have to bee SEEEN studying in order for my parents to believe i study.LIKE HELLO??!i mean when i got off the phone my dad actually said""i think u can take a break now..."" i'd been on a break for the past hour!but if i do study(not showing off that i study) and i come out to take a break to watch some tv or msn..my mum's like ""taking a break already????its only been 20 mins...""...YEAH RIGHT.
so neways back to today..btw i wasnt really talking to HIM all that much..coz now that i know he hates me..i dont wanna waste my fucking time, i was actually being pleasent company to others..
neways we were all eating pizza and anil uncle said ""oh im stuffed already"", after like the 1st slice and i was like ""yeah..im full too(after my 5th slice)"" and then i said ""i guess aging pacifies hunger quickly""..or sometihng like that. and i was NOT being offensive, i mean i was making a joke(abt me!) for christs sake!but my stupid sister made it worse by glaring at me and going ""janu!""...then all of  a sudden everyone else seemed to think i was being rude coz HE kinda coughed and smirked.BASTARD. and my mom was trying to give her ohimbeingsoosubtle glares.EXCEPT she is NOT!but thank the lord,anil uncle dint take any offense but started laughing and went""hahaha!thats true!this girl has wits sudhir!""..man i love the man..he really does think im funny(when all my mum thinks is im talking without a reason), hes always on abt my wits..TAKE THAT MOM!im WITTY!HA!hahaha!
so after dinner, the guys all wanted to go play at the b&b court..and i SOOO dint want to but my mum practically pushed me out the door.sigh..
so at the basketball court i shot some pretty good baskets, i mean i AM 5f10. it would be embarassing if i couldnt shoot well.so then about i hour into it i started feeling nauseas and had to sit down.but seeing all those people made me think abt when we were were kids.life was soo much easier back then..and then HE started messaging( that swedish cow i bet!), and i was fiercly overcome with jealousy. MAN.
what the hell?!"

ok ive been thinking about it lately. NO, not that im having any sexual desires, just that some of my friends have been active in that department and i wonder.naturally. i always thought i would wait until i got married, but then again i dont wanna be this national virgin when im 35..just coz i havent found ma man. and its a pretty huge step anyways. i dont think im emotionally mature for it. YET.u know..one small step for any other human being, but a giant leap for ME! sigh. and hello??what about the worst case scenario???? an unplanned pregnancy? i was watching OPRAH and this 14 year old girl was getting ready to give birth. FOURTEEN!!! thats even younger than my sister! so whatever u do guys,, just use protection ok??! a condom..a pill..whatever works for ya. it maybe uncomfortable..ugh..but preventions better than cure..so umm..yeaa.
oh i finally got round to watching girl with a pearl earing. alex and i had both read the book and we thought it was awesome so we went at caught it at marina square.but oh! it took us soo long to go find the theatre and all becoz alex dint want to ask ppl for help. so i had to pretend to go to the bathroom but really, i went and asked this guy where the leisureplex was...aah! i was soo clever! and then i told her ""id figured out how to get there""..muahaha! i was not gonna miss that movie..pffff.oh oh and then we got these seats right at the back..the ""couple seats"" and we were pretty much surrounded by all these couples..u know the only thing worse than couples with PDAs..is CHINESE couples doing PDAs!!!grrrr..u never know which ones trhe guy or girl..they both look and sound alike............"

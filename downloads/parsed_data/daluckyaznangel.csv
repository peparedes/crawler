"event","you know the only thing i ever wanted was to have a best friend that would:
care for me

listen or at least pays a  bit of attention to me when i talk

likes to be helpful

can cheer me up

and someone who knows how i feel without asking stupid questons.

the reason why i say this is because all the ppl at my school are so i cant even say

my friends arent what i imagine they to be their so cold and all they ever talk about is boys and problems

my other friends talk about things but they always say oh we cant tell you.

i feel like such an outcast from school and even outside of school its hard for me to make any friends.

my friends at school doesnt even pay attention to me everytime i talk they're either talking to someone else or just not listening to me 
they dont even bother to cheer me up

just a few days ago i was suspended.
it was stupid this girl jessica torres is always be races to me and she said things that made me snap  i was yelling and i got sent to the office and they suspended me for using swears and was discriminating towards another student. I WAS LIKE WHAT THE FUCK SHE WAS THE One being prejudice aand discriminating towards me i just snapped. YOUR FUCKING LUCKY I DIDNT HIT HER WHEN I COULD HAVE

i swear and then i cried when i found out that jessica got a lunch detention and thats all. i was still crying when i went to my locker to get my stuff to go home and my so called friends looked at me and said sandy u lost another fight didnt u and they walked away. i felt so frustrated i when i got home i got a fever from all the stress.

i want to move away from this town and find real friends 

friends that would caer for me and cheer me up when times are hard and even listen to me and and... 

oh great i'm crying again"

your smile breaks through the clouds of grey
far from the sunny days that lie in sleep..

waiting for patience for the spring when flowers bloomed renewed again...

knowing theres more beyond the pain of today....


although the scars of yesterday remains..

you can go on living as much as your heart believes..

you can't be born again although you can change....

"event","<br /><span style=""color: #800080"">Well today I didn't get nearly done what I wanted. But I did get Georgya to the doc and got an Rx for her skin, got a higher dose of my zoloft, found out my thyroid levels are a bit on the low side so I have to up that med too. I picked up Geoff's Rx's after I called to get them filled, got Gillyan to and from school, got an extra hour and a half of sleep and a shower. So far so good. Want to get the house picked up before Geoff gets home tomorrow morning and we have to go to Indy to take the big truck back so I wont have much time tomorrow to get much of anything done. UGH! I think I am glad he is going to be home. I will miss the quiet.&nbsp; He likes the TV on ALL the time. Its like it has to be on. I get tired of it being on. I am not sure what we are going to do this summer. With him working nights and all the kids home. This should be challenging. Please Lord give me strength to handle this. </span><br />"

"event","<br /><span style=""color: #0000ff"">The Counclor says little by little. Each day do something. So yesterday I did am and pm yoga a load of laundry and some picking up. Today I didn't manage to get to the yoga but I did get a few loads of laundry done, clean the kitchen, sweep the floor, hang out with the neighbor and go to church. I know I&nbsp;need to focus on the positive. The things I DID do not the things I didn't. Its hard. But I need to get out of this funk. I like myself better when I am happy. Besides when I am in that middle point between happy and sad its so easy to be sad. Its like when your in the middle you are on a hill, half way up and half way down. Its so much easier to roll down the hill then to go up it. So I am trying. I want to try for my kids, for my husband.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style=""color: #0000ff"">So at church we talked about what needs to happen for you to have a good kid. Not that I didn't know it but it was some up in your face &quot;Your the parent and its your job to make sure you kids feel safe, feel loved and behave respectfuly&quot;&nbsp; I know thats true and it was good to have out there in the open. I know I need to have more faith, I need to do all I can and put the rest in God's hands. I have to trust the He will help me. Its a struggle. Especially when I feel like I need to do it all myself. But I don't. I need to learn to depend on my husband and TELL him what I need and not expect him to read my mind. I need to learn to ask for help when I need it and not be stubborn about trying to do it all myself. I need to be more patient with my children and have a bit more structure. Not too&nbsp; much... but enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is this whole person I want to be. The good housekeeper. The good mother. The amazing wife. The super student. I feel like I fall so short of those things everyday. Almmost like they are unattainable. And maybe they are. I need to accept the fact that I can't be all things to all people. I am human. period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So tomorrow I want to do my yoga, take the dog for a walk, get some more laundry done (my goal is to at least get put away what is already clean), Get milk, get a shower, wash my sheets and remake my bed. Write Char a letter, call the school, see what my options are. If maybe I can retake these classes this summer. Thats a thought. We shall see. </span><br />"

"event","Wow reading over some of my old entries really brought back some memories.  Things were really tough there for a while.  Well things certainly changed, and for the better let me assure you!!  About 4 months after I ended it with the ""not-so-boyfriend""  I met my soul mate.  He came through my work and I thought ""WOW that is a really cute pepsi guy""  Well a week later I was chattin on yahoo and there was this guy from town... So i looked up his profile... I was shocked to see he was a pepsi man and looked a lil like the guy that had come in my drive thru a week earlier.  we Chatted and chatted and realized that it was him... he remembered me and my NAME even.  WOW  Well we met that night... to wach a movie.  but of course movie watching didn't happen.  Although its not what you think... We talked.  and talked for hours and hours.  I think we were busy falling in love that night.  Crazy how the world works.  Well we have been together ever since.  He is my soul mate and I love him with ever inch of my being.  He is an amazinly awesome man.  So hear I sit... my girls and I live with him now.  (I let the not-so -boyfriend rent my house so he and his kids didn't have to move)  and we are blissfully happy.  Ok... well its not like life stopped... LOL we still have bills and still have to deal with the lil things plus learn about one another and worked through the irritating lil things that drive us bonkers.  Although there aren't too many of those things.  And now we are expecting our first child together.  We weren't going to tell anyone till I was at least 8 weeks in case of a misscarrige.  But I have a hard time keeping my mouth shut.  We are both over joyed.  He is happy... the happy I always wanted the father of my kids to feel.  but my girl's dad didn't give a crap.  My love does, he already talks to my belly.  Its so sweet.  I am in my 6th week and continue to keep my fingers crossed and sending up prayers, hoping that the good Lord will see fit that this child shall be born.  I think my Love would accually be more devistated then I would be shoule the ""bad thing"" happen to our child.  We are waiting to tell my girls untill after we at least hear the heart beat.  I don't want to have to explain the bad thing to them.  Anyway I should end now... I have laundry and stuff to do..."

"event","<FONT color=#6600cc>s at that. I don't want to lose him completly. I still love him. I will only loves him. He brought out so much in Well the not-so-bf read my journal here. That is how he found out things were over. I hate that thngs had to be like that. but at least they are done. I hate that he is hurting so and the kids will feel the pain the hardest. Somedays I think I am selfish for wanting to be happy. there are 5 other people that at least for a time are going to be very sad because just this one person wants to be happy. I wonder if that is fair. What about the greater good? He is a good man and has the potention to make a wonderful mate and a great father. He just needs to start with him and his kids. He needs to be a good father to his OWN kids first, and learn to be independent. I wish and pray for so many things for him. A good job or better position so that he will be finatially stable, a nice place to live so they kids have room to play and are happy there with their own rooms. And then when things are settled for him, when he is comfortable doing it all cause he has had to, the SHE will come into his life. I hope its a woman without kids so that his kids can get tons of attetnion and love from her. A woman that wants to be a mother as much as his kids need a mother. And she will love him because he is a good man. So now the new stress begins. I wont MAKE him leave untill the kids are out of school. That wouldn't be fair to them. I will prolly offer to help with babysitting for the summer too. The kids have spent the last 2 years together... not fair to cut them off cold turtkey anyway. But living with him will be mostly hard on him which will stress me out. I just wish that he could feel the peace I feel. I want him to be where I am... at the point where we can br friends, and pretty good oneme and taught me a lot about myself. I am a better person for having loved him but that time is over. I will continue to pray that he will find peace in this. And i hope he will laways know that i love him. I just can't tell him that right now because I don't want to confuse him. Apperently I have done enough of that already. </FONT>"

"event","I really feel like I know what the right thing to do is.  I am not supposed to be with the not-so-boyfriend.  Our relationship is over.  I know he doesn't want it to be.  I know that he thinks he can change and make it better.  ""This time we will accually do it and not just talk about it.""  I am past that.  Its over.  It has to be.  I am not happy... when I think about giving it more time it makes my head hurt and my tummy turn.  I know what I have to do but I am so not looking forwward to telling him he is losing us.  For the first time since we have been together he refered to all of us, me, his kids, my kids and him as a family.  ""I am not ready to lose my family""  Too little too late.  But I know he wont see that.  I will be the bad guy since I am not giving us a fair chance.  I am making all the desions and he is left out.  I am desiding to seperate our family and there is nothing he can do about it.  I just wish he could feel what I feel.  A peace with the end.  I wish he could feel the relief. 

I really want to be his friend too.  To still be around for the kids.  To help him.  But I am not sure if that will work.  I have untill tomorrow to tell him.  But I think I will have to write him a letter.  We can talk after .  But I will need to get everthing out.  Wish me luck."

"event","Kids were out playing and went over to the neighbors yard.  When they all came home for dinner the little neighbor girl came back over and asked for the oldest's help in finding their gate lock.  I sent her on over to find it.  She came back and asked the other 3 about it... (2 oldest girl 12 and boy 9 are not-so-boyfriends kids, the little girls 4 and 6 are mine)  They all said they hadn't seenit.  9 y/o has been a theif in the past.  i told him this would be his only chance to tell me the truth.  I didn't beleive him... told him to empty his pockets... he said they were empty but  checked int hem anyway.  I still didnt believe him so i made him come to my so i could check them.  Low and behold there was the lock in his pocket.  i just don't know if i can handle this anymore.  Everytime i turn around he is stealing something and then has to be in trouble.  Well if he was watning attention he sure got it... and the red ass to prove it.  I just don't know what to do with him anymore... he is in counceling and on all sorts of meds.  what am i doing wrong.  He is not even my kid.  I never have time with my girls cause of these kids and i don't want to resent them for it.  But jee whiz have i got myself into a mess.  I think i did over do it abit with his punishemtn... but being nice for the last 2 years hasn't seemed to help.  I don't know what I can do about him anymore."

"event","The not-so-boyfriend let me sleep intoday.  He took care of the kids aside from yelling at them and it was kinda nice to sleep in.  I know he is tryin to win me back... so if i give in... what will happen then?  will things go back... so that i am a single parent of 4 kids and 2 of them aren't mine? Its a stuggle for me... when i broke up with him... i felt calm... almost nothing and then i said the words that are always my down fall... 'well maybe we can make it work if'  There are only so many times you can 'if' something.  There are lots of things i need to think about... and things to consider... but this time its not to see if I should end it.. but to see if i should continue it"

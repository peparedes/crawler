"event","From the bottom of our very full hearts, we want to thank everyone who came out last night, bought our CD, laughed at our jokes, and generally made us feel very squishy and amazing inside last night.  It was a wonderful, wonderful night.

You are quite possibly the best friends and fans the world has ever known.  We love you.

To everyone who was not able to make it out, the CD will be available for purchase on our website in the next few days - so its not too late to grab your copy.  I am exhausted today (and a little hung over!), so I am not making this a link, but MC website is at www.missile-command.net. 

Thanks again.  Oh, and if you got a CD - let it play for a little while after the last song.  Just sayin'.  ;)"

"event","Hey, for those of you in the Cleveland area that thought about Convergence but thought you couldn't get a decent airfare to Tampa - Airtran is running a sale if you buy by June 3rd:

<big>$99 each way</big>

Just go to their website and click on the Specials tab, then click Akron/Canton and you'll see the Tampa rate.

They are running a lot of specials to/from all over the place - check it out.  It may make Convergence a more reasonable goal for some of you that want to go, but have held off because of crappy airline fares."

YES, MISSILE COMMAND IS PLAYING C14 IN TAMPA - let there be rejoicing.  :D

If you have the means to go, you should - because we are playing, and there will be other cool bands and some wonderful DJs *coughBATTYcough* AND because there will be some interaction between <lj user=theonebob> and a shark that promises to be very <i>Happy Days</i>.  That's all I'm saying.  

For information on Convergence (in case you aren't in the know about what it actually is), go here:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_%28goth_festival%29"">The Festival</a> and then go here for <a href=""http://www.c14ybor.com""/>info for C14</a>.

My dad is coming down from Tallahassee to see our performance - I'm so stoked!!  :D"

<small>ok - the cake is a lie.</small>

Yay."

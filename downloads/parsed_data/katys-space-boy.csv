"event","well no one took the time to fill out the little thing i posted a couple of times ago

but anywho...last week went by fast,well i can say that now it didnt then.  i mainly worked on my car in CAD and had a physics porfolio due.  

THE WEEKEND:

Friday- school for a test, then i got a hair cut and hit the road to clemson to pick up my baby, then we headed back into town and hung out for alittle bit and i took her home

Saturday- picked up katy and we ran around irmo taking care of flowers, hair, makeup, buying stuff, then off to dinner, picks and prom, back here afterwards

Sunday- the best is waking up next to the one you love, (even if shes drooling on ur pillow...i love you) but we got our usual late start which is our trademark and i dotn mind at all not having to get up before noon, and still having someone to roll around with and br goofy :p. we went to the international festival and then the long trip taking her back home :C. 

this week is going to be jam packed with rotc stuff the speech and the slide show

today things got crazy with grandaddy, and i dont know exactly what is going to happen with him.  I really am not ready to loose him but i know that he is ready to be with grandma and vanny.  but if its not too much to ask can u keep him in ur prayers, i love him very much.

goodnight"

then physics, rotc where nick and i worked on the launcher drawing it in cad, then cad, and language.  She wants us to read Gullivers Travels i think, spark notes here i come!

after that i came home and well damn i cant remember what i did....oh yea i went with nick to lowes to fix his window and they did have the glass, then we went and dee and i joined nick in a bowling league, its gonna be fun.  then i came back and changed and went to the gym, had a good workout till the end and i started to feel alittle bad cause i didnt eat before i went.

today, woke up early again like always, government is getting better we have a test next time.  then i slept during teacher aiding, i hate the desks though cause if u lean over and sleep on ur arm air builds up in ur throught and when u wake u have to burp alot. cad i had to rip some boards and nick put ducktape in franks hair and he had to cut it out. then math was boring cause i already know what shes teaching.

got home and talked with dad some and decided to head to the lake, i talked with Katy for most of the ride up there and got chinese for grandaddy which was an adventure in itself. i talked with him for a while and came back home. 

heres a thought:
    Everyone has one, a place that they can go to to find complete calm.  A place where no matter what else is going on in your life it doesnt seem to matter, time seems to come to a hault.  I went there tonight, my place, I walked out there and the only sounds were of the light on behind me, the waves lapping against the dock driven by the gentle breeze that chilled my cheeks.  It's peaceful, I can stop and think there about whatever I need to, whoever I need to.  Time just stops, I give a few prayers, maybe a few tears, think of my loved ones, and hope for a great tomorrow. 
    This is one of two, the other is with a certain someone, who makes everything going on around me disappear, you know who you are, I love you.

Do u have a place, that seems to calm u down, leave me a message"

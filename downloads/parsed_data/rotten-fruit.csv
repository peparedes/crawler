"event","so a weekend usually equals going home...which is exactly what happened.

friday i took the train home with alicia.  it was my first time taking the train EVER and it was soooo fun!  i didnt relize until halfway through the trip that there was another side to the traid which means MORE WINDOWS TO LOOK OUT OF!  YAY!
so when i got home odin called me and i went to pick him up.  we went back to my house with ""r king"" and ate as fwank fwank, frisk frisk, candooshk and moose paraded through the dining room.  fwank fwank was being all cute and stuff as always.  after, we went in my room and i dont remember what we did.  no seriously, i dont remember.  after a while odin fell asleep and told me to nap with him.  we napped until it was time for him to leave and i brought him home.  
saturday i had to get fitted for my sisters wedding since im the maid of honor.  yay.  i went with toni, my aunt, and my sister.  after that we went to the diner and it was hilarious bc we had a bitchy waitress and she wrote slow and stuff.  
there wa a really bad fight at my house that made me really emotional.  im a wuss.  
that night i picked up odin and we went to vickys for some eatins.  i saw merrisa which was cool.  vicky odin and i went to connections to see one lump sum play.  before we went in we pregamed in my car and saw joe hickey!!!!  that was awesome.  when we went in we saw torres' band.  i havent seen him in a while so that was cool.  i got odin vicky and myself kicked out of connections so we went to a party with danny dunn.  it was cool until some shit went down...but everythings all good now.   
this morning i hung out with odin for a while.  we went to the park and saw evil squirrels that tried to eat us and give us the finger.  since odin didnt feel well he wasnt doing front flips or anything lol  
after a while we decided to get something to eat so we went to a diner where i got something i didnt want.  the waitress asked odin what nationality he was bc she said he looked like a turkish boy.  
after that we went back to the park and saw more evil squirrels and evil mentally unstable women.  this lady came up to us and put her stuff right down next to us and started rambling.  she changed her shirt in front of us and stuff.  it was gross and freaky.  and then she told us that she wanted to be alone....even though she went up to us...it was weird.  so we went to my car and hung out and then i left him.  and then i was sad again.  bc i know that i wont be seeing him until next weekend (which isnt even certain...i could see him 2 weeks from now if i dont have a ride and whatever).  whatever...i still had fun this weekend with my love.
after that i went home and hung out with my parents and my grandparents for a while.  when they left i brushed my dog and then left with my dad to rutgers.  
when i got in my room it smelt like....ass.  yup, definitely ass.  so i cleaned hardcore and listened to bjork.  number 6 is an amazing song.  yay.  
i have to study for precalc.  exam on tuesday.  im gonna fail.  this sucks.  
alicia got me wildberry skittles lip gloss.  thats one of my favorite candies in the world!!! 
my mom put 3 of my checks in the account for me to use for xmas even though that money is supposed to go to college.  that was extremely nice of her. 
i just got back from eating with the gals.  i dont see them too often.  i miss them.  it was really fun just chilling with them.  for once i wasnt busy.  
odin just called me so im gonna go talk =)"

"event","<P>Happy Halloween everyone!!!!!</P>
<P>wednesday after my classes i saw brower ( the cafateria on college ave) burn down.&nbsp; it was so cool.&nbsp; flames were flying out of the windows.&nbsp; after that i learned about the lunar eclipse and mark and i watched it.&nbsp; after that i went to college ave w sarah ans alicia and i got hot chocolate.&nbsp; it was fun </P>
<P>so thursday after work and a nap that was beautiful (a war could have went on in my room and it wouldnt have stirred me one bit), i went to target&nbsp; to look for a halloween costume.&nbsp; after almost being little red riding hood and a cat, i bought horns that cost me 3 bucks.&nbsp; it was probably the cheepest thing there.&nbsp; they were amazing though.&nbsp; we got ready and we were gonna go to this party but it got broken up so we went to college ave to the gay/lesbian frat.&nbsp; it was fun to get drunk... and to dance the night away!!!!!&nbsp; heh.&nbsp; we payed 6 bucks but i actually payed like 20 cuz i payed for 2 of the gals who didnt have money.&nbsp; </P>
<P>friday after class i waited for my dad to come and me and anne talked.&nbsp; it was nice letting some of my emotions out.&nbsp; when i got home, i went to the doctor.&nbsp; i dont have athesma but i have something kind of like it where instead of hyperventalating i cough&nbsp;so the doctor gave me a temporary inhaler.&nbsp; i also found out i have allergies.&nbsp; but, despite what i thought, i dont have strep throat but she gave me meds and im feeling better.&nbsp; </P>
<P>after the doctor i went out to eat with my parents and after that i picked up odin and we went to my house to watch some stupid corny movie.&nbsp; it was pretty bad.&nbsp; we still had fun that night though.&nbsp; </P>
<P>my knee hurts.</P>
<P>saturday i did soe shit i needed to do and made decorations for my room for fun halloween weekend with odin and eventually i picked him up.&nbsp; we went to stop and shop where i saw adam.&nbsp; he asked me if i was 18 so i could buy him eggs for mischief night.&nbsp; i did, and then me and odin bought cookie stuff to make cookies.&nbsp; the cookies could have been better...they were too crunchy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>we watched signs after that....it was my first time seeing it...i thought it was good though.&nbsp; </P>
<P>today my dad said that i could go home whenever i wanted bc there wasnt a jets or giants game so i hung out with odin.&nbsp; we went to the park and hung out and talked and it was nice.&nbsp; i forgot about daylight savings or whatever so i got to have another hour with him!!!!!&nbsp; yay!&nbsp; we went to pizza hut and talked some more and it was nice to talk.&nbsp; yay talking.&nbsp; we went to the park again and stuff and it was soooo beautiful out.&nbsp; when i dropped him off he realized that he forgot his wallet so i had to go back and my mom was a bitch.&nbsp; </P>
<P>oh yeah.&nbsp; i got electicuted too.&nbsp; that was fun.&nbsp; </P>
<P>my weekend was pretty awesome though.&nbsp; i miss odin already and i cant wait to see him again.&nbsp; we are gonna talk lots on the phone this week&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; i should get started on my expos paper.&nbsp; eek.</P>
<P>thank you odin for the wonderful weekend.&nbsp; and happy 3 weeks.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; im so gay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

"event","it be sunday and once again this meansa that im procratinating all that i can instead of writing my expos paper.  man, do i hate expos. 

odin came thursday night to visit me.  he stayed until today and left at around 2:30.  it was so nice having him here with me...having him up my ass 24 hours a day for 4 days was amazing.  he steals covers on occasion though, but it was okay because he cuddled me until i was warm again.  

we basically just hung out and rested, but just being with him was splendid.  we watched eternal sunshine of the blah blah blah and the best of will ferrell on snl.  we ate junk food until we felt like we were gonna die.  i wish he could stay in my dorm forever.  

he came to class with me on friday.  class is always interesting when you have an odin sitting next to you.  we met teresa....a girl that i see all the time bc shes hard to miss.  she listens to weird music.  

we took showers next to each other.  NOT TOGETHER you pervs...just next to each other.  if i get water thrown in my eye one more time ill chop off your balls.  
the movies were good.  i would never erase odin from my memory.  no matter what happens.  haha

we fine dined at cooper.  i got sauce all over me.  that was superb.  
everything we did was just wonderful because i had him with me.  now i have to wait some more til the next time i see him...it sucks, but i can deal with it.  

i love when he comes to see me.  its so much better than me going home.  he gets to sleep over for 3 nights when he comes.  when i go home i have to deal with my parents and come home by 2...and usually i get in trouble bc i dont come home at 2.  and when i go home i have to wait to see him bc he has band practice.  its just so much nicer when he comes here.

thank you for making my weekend happy and i cant wait til i see you again my love.  

on another note, expos sucks my asshole.  stupid papers.

halloween is coming soon and i wanna do something fun and i really would like to dress up but i dont know what the fuck im doing.  

psych exam on tuesday.  this means im not going to philosophy.  f that ish yo. 

i hate work.  i dont wanna go to work again.  

its 9 and i havent started writing my rough draft.  fuck me.  im so stupid...i wanna talk to odin when he calls me, but i choose to procrastinate which means i cant talk to him.  gah. 

i should start i suppose."

"event","so today was one of the coolest nights at rutgers.  alicia, sarah and i went to the red lion cafe on college ave.  there was supposed to be jazz music, but when we got there there was open mic and people were reading poetry.  i got some coffee too which usually isnt my style.  there was this one cute guy who kept on reading poetry and he was amazing.  and he looked like the singer of hed pe...dreads and all.  but yeah, after that we played some pool and i lost bc i scratched on the 8 ball.  poops.  i saw joe at the grease trucks for a moment; i also saw the gals from orientation that i met.  after that i went to cook and went to sarahs friends room for a bit.  

i heart college. 

i wanna get another piercing.  hmm.  maybe my nose?  i wanted the back of my neck but sarah has that and i dont wanna seem like a poser.  although if i was to get one it would be better  back there bc you cant see it with my hair down.  

people said i looked skinnier today.  i guess thats cool. i did lose 5 lbs since ive been here for some reason.  

people drive like maniacs at rutgers.

i have psych and precalc tomorrow.  woo.

so my dad had the operation.  he was in intensive care longer than expected but now hes out.  i feel bad for him; hes in so much pain.  he really needed this operation though...he could have died at any moment. 

i really wanna thank anyone who has told me that everythings gonnabe okay.  it really meant a lot to me and i greatly appreciated everyones concern.  

i dont really feel like typing anymore....so bye bye sluts."

the downside is that i miss so many people.  i miss odin so much it kills me.  i think about him all the time; hes such a funny unique person.  

and greg...i miss him calling me smelly. awww. 

and toni, my lovely cousin.  i hope shes having fun so far in rutgers newark.  


the first day of rutgers i unpacked and rested.  basically it except for some mandatory meetings.  

the next day was a lot of walking around.  i dont understand how people gain their frshmen 15; i think im gonna lose 15 lbs.  

at night alicia and i hung with some friends and then we went to college ave for some frat parties. we got nice and drunk.

tonight we went to a dorm party and some guy was hitting on me.  it was awkward but it got worse when this girl i was with was like hey she has a boyfriend...it was a mess....

i just got off the phone with odin.  =)

"event","so its early in the morning on tuesday and im up because my mom made me go to the doctor.  i freakin have bronchitis.  

uhh, my mom wants me to get better so she really isnt allowing me to stay out that late or anything.  this sucks because im going away to school in a few days and i want to spend as much time with my friends as possible but...i cant.  she thinks that im going to get phnemonia because it starts off like this and this is how i got it when i was like 5. sheesh.

i have to do a lot of packing; i went shopping and got a lot of shit that ive needd to get, but i still haveto go clothes shopping.  woo.  

yesterday i went to the beach with toni and kori.  it was fun.  i applied sunblock 3 times but i  only have a little more tan-nes than i did, im just not as white.  

after the beach i hung out with odin.  we went to the park first but then went back to the car to listen to some music.  due to the terrible lighting we ended up moving quite a bit.  we listened to tool...the cd i have is pretty amazing, i mean, i know a lot of the songs from the radio and from my brother, but there are some that i didnt recognize...i dont know why i never got into them...its just that i have so many cd's and some i still have never listened to before because im still on other music, but yeah, this cd rocks.  

im hungry.

i need to call this lady still for the work study program at rutgers but i dont wanna bc im scared.  dont ask.  


i cant believe i leave in like 4 days.  im gonna miss so many people."

"event","my mom keeps on threatening to bring me to the doctor.  i dont wanna go.  my cough isnt going away, but i just started taking medicine yesterday so we shall see.

my mom is sick now.  it happens every so often...her fibroids become swollen.  they were thinking about sending her to the emergency room.  shes home though taking pain killers.  she has to go to the hospital to get checked out soon. 

i think my dad is having his operation september 9th.  not positive though. 

my grandmother isnt doing well.  she still may or may not have her surgery. 

my sisters in virginia?  i think?  shes coming back sunday...i think...but monday we are gonna go to seaside with toni and go on the boardwalk and have fun.  woo.

i hung out with toni and joe yesterday after i ran did some shit for my mom.  joe came with me to pick up her midication...it was a funy situation.  heh.

anyway...it was danas birthday yesterday...HAPPY BIRTHDAY LOVE!  we hung out a bit with that crew but i was coughing up a lung and didnt feel well so i decided to go home.  toni and i played video games. we took some pictures and headed out so i could bring joe and her home.  

i was coughing so bad last night.  it sucked.

odin was my wakeup call this morning.  he called me at 11.  when i woke up i was drenched in sweat because i didnt have my ac on.  

my mother and i went to the bank and opened an account for me for college.  

i made a list of things i haveto get tonight because my cousin and aunt are coming with my mom and i to get some college stuff at bj's.  my list is hugggge.

i still need to do a lot of shopping but with everything happening all at once its kind of complicated to get things done.  

im hanging out with odin and toni later.  i dont know what we are gonna do, but its always fun being with them.  they are both extremely awesome and they make me happy.  thats what i need right now."

toni told me that i signed on RIGHT as odin signed off.  what kind of non-sense is that? psh.  

so im getting sicker and sicker by the moment.  my chest feels like theres a ton of bricks on it and i have a bad cough.  i hope no one gets sick.  cough cough i warned you cough cough.  

oh, and while im complaining i might as well say that i have a runny nose as well.

so my mom told me today that my grandma isnt doing too well.  she has a clogged artery that is TOTALLY clogged.  theres nothing you can do about that...and she also has another clogged artery, but its ALMOST fully closed...so they can try and do something like that, but there really is no definite positive outcome.  she told me that if my grandmother does have an operation, she might die on the operating table.  they might just tell her not to have an operation and just live as long as she can like that.  why is this shit just piling up like this?  i feel bad...my grandmother didnt even tell my father about her condition because she didnt want him to worry about her while he was having his operation, but my uncle told my father anyway because he thought that he deserved to know.  

so now about my day...

i went to the mall with my sister because i wanted to see if i could find earings.  no such luck.  

when i got home i changed into pajamas and wrapped a blanket around myself.  i really didnt feel like going out because i felt like shit.  sooooooo i went online and looked up prices for dorm shit.  i leave in 12 days, but im guessing when i leave ill be back a lot for my father and grandmother.  

oh i got my classes too, expos, precalc, phycology, and philosophy.  doesnt look too bad.  i didnt haveto take a moth bc i placed out of it, but im taking it just incase i change my major to math.  im undecided as of yet.  

anyway...joe ended up stopping by and we just talked.  

i napped and now im wide awake.  

i just had the worst pain in my shoulder.

tell me that wasnt super obvious. 

so ive just been thinking about things.  im sorry if ive ever hurt anyone in any way.  i wish i was smart to think of words better than anything i could possibly say, but i guess im sorry will have to do.  i think ""im sorry"" is enough considering the things that people have said to me...or have not said.  no hinting involved.

my father has to go into the hospital again soon.  i think hes gonna be going to a hospital in trenton to have his major heart surgery.  its supposedly a reallllly good hospital that only does heart surgeries...but we shall see what happens.  

am i a stubborn person?  i mean, i usually give in so quickly, but there are just some things that are unacceptable and wrong.

i just dont wanna be seen as being week i guess.  

im gonna be going to college soon.  i wonder if ill ever see some of the people i talk to ever again.  ya just never know.

up until friday i probably hung out with toni, odin, greg, and that crew.  i know we watched a movie-dead man on campus-and it was pretty good.  we also attempted to build a fort but lack of motivation stopped us in our tracks.  

another day we watched alli g.  it was the first time i ever saw that show and it was pretty funny.  

friday came along and dj was having a kickin' party at his house so i decided to go.  a bunch of people showed up including dana, jenn, katrina, sean, luis, allison,  odin, roman, and others that probably arent important.  we all drank and it was fun times.  i ended up sleeping in dj's bed with sean and luis.  i was in the middle and i was squashed so i ended up on dj's couch.  dana and dj made me a breakfast that i wouldnt normally eat but it was okay.  

dana and i made dj watch mommy dearest.  i used to love that movie when i was ab out 5.  i think i was fucked up as a child. 

yesterday (saturday incase you didnt realize)i hung out with toni and merrisa.  i ended up seeing alex which was amazingness. i havent seen him in so long and i missed him so much.  

we all went to dj's and he was fucked up. it was funny.  a few people were there.  i had to go home at 2.  

toni and i played mario world until she dropped the remote control onto the snes and made the game freeze.  shes so cool.  

we stayed up until 7 in the morning just watching tv and talking.  

shes the best. 

we woke up at 4 and we ate bagels.  =)

we might go to cool beans tonight if we can make it there."

for the past like, 5 days ive seen toni.  

i went to see linkin park with my sister.  i ended up seeing roman and his friend which was pretty awesome.  i also knew that toni was going to be there so i called her up and we got together.  korn was pretty awesome and linkin park was amazing.  
after the concert kori and i went to hang out with my friends that were having a party.  we all got drunk and played uno.  

my sisters engagement party was cool; my entire family was there.  my dad asked me to dance which was kinda weird, but hes trying and i haveto give him credit.  
toni and i wentto joes house afterward to play some pool and cook some food.  we also played video games. 
toni endd up sleeping over my house and we stayed up playing video games and watching tv.  we talked and it was nice <3

toni and i have been hanging out with odin and greg and all those lovely people.  yesterday i picked up toni and we headed to fort lee again and we ended up being thrown into a pool.  odin gave me shorts to wear and i was very greatful.  i didnt expect to actually end up in the pool.  sigh. 

i continue to have fucked up dreams.  it ... is weird...

so today my father is in the hospital because of a clogged artery.  hes coming out today, but hell be back in the hospital in one or two weeks for major heart surgery.  the doctors wanted to do it today but i think my dad was scared.  i hope everythings gonna be okay.

tonight was the odd hours show so toni went with me and we had ourselves a grand ol' time.  they ended up winning $500 which is totally awesome.  they deserved it because that band is really good.  odin played the drums wonderfully.  what a talented kid he is. 

after the show we all ended up hanging out.  we went to angel's where we just sat for a little.  i got hit with drum sticks and that was nice.  

we all went to fudd ruckers and got some food.  toni and i split fries and a coke.  the ice in the drink annoyed me.  

i am stinky allison and cracked out allison.  i think im also something else, but i cant remember what.  

hi im allison and i like art and music.  im cool.

so after the food-age we went to this place in i think it was edge water.  it poured on us so we went in my car for a while and just talked (greg odin toni and i). after the rain we went by water and we threw rocks in water and mud and it was fun.  im talking like a little kid.  woo.

greg hit me in the leg with this weird plant and it hurt.  bad sexy greg.  sheesh.  

everyone stepped on my feet about 20 times because i was wearing flip-flops.  

i haveto start a wall in my room dedicated to roman.  

and yes, i have a weird nose/ chin/ whatever, but...alas.... i have cool eyes.   supposedly.  

greg drove my car.  i didnt feel like he was going to kill me either.  

he seems like a cool kid.  in fact, everyone we hung out with was really awesome.  

we went to baskin robins and i didnt get anything.  but we discovered i have soft weird arms.  thanks.  

i dropped greg and odin off at angels house and then i drove toni home.  we listened to lost prophets.

before that i hung out with my friend.  we were having what i would call amazing conversations, but then he kinda ditched me for his friends who had ditched him in the first place.  it just kinda angered me because i really needed to talk to someone; i mean im not in the best of mindstates right now...maybe im just overreacting and such.  im just confused and all that nice shit that comes along with depression.  WHATEVA!

so yeah today was a boring day.  but the arrival of my computer was orgasmic.  totally.

today i gardened.  my mom made me go pull some weeds out of the ground.  spiders were scared of me, but i think i was more scared of them.  they are UGLY.  whoosh.

i smell good right now. 

summer has been awesome.  except for today.  i think this is one of the few days i have been depressed this  summer.  

my fish are alive and well for those of you who care.  

and thats everyone.

hal sparks is gorgeous.  mmm.

"event","so yay im back from rutgers!
it was definitely not as bad as i thought it would be.  when alicia and i arrived, we got our keys and went to our room.  she was only down the hall so it was easy to keep in touch with her.  i went in my room and set down my things.  my roommate (who is NOT the person im rooming with when i actually go to rutgers as a student)walked in.  i greeted her, ya know, ""hey im allison...lovely to meet you...where ya from..."" all that nice talk.  well, she didnt take a liking to me.  she cut the talk short and said, ""umm.  yeah, i need to go find my friends.  BYE!""  and walked out of the room.  everytime i was alone with her it was awkward so i just stayed in alicia's room for the most part.  kathleen was her name, and a few times i would walk in the room and she would have her friends with her and totally stop talking as soon as they saw me.  it was really weird when i was in the room for more than a few minutes and they were silent.  i wasnt in my room for long anyway though.  we had a lot to do.  
when alicia and i walked outside, we introduced ourselves to a bunch of people.  i would later find that i belonged to the popular group at douglass campus.  it was strange.  i havent felt that in so long.  i used to be popular when i was younger but i didnt like the people so i just cut myself from that croud...but these people were actually nice and fun to hang out with. 
we did some ice breakers that were pretty gay, but looking back it really did let everyone get to know each other.  
the food wasnt bad at all.  i could live off that ish yo.  werd.
all in all it was a good experience.  

my mom didnt kill my mr. feesh.  he is alive and well.  

im probably forgetting so much shit, but if i remember anything ill put it in later.

when i got home i went to sleep.  i was tired as hell.  i didnt sleep long though because there was a party at michelles.  it was really fun and awesome.  but something happened to one of my close friends that made me wanna freakin kill someone.  i hope shell be okay.  billy came and he had cuts all over him.  he fell on his way there.  he was skating.  awww, poor billy.  i got drawn all over too.  that was fun.

my meatball sandwich has just arrived. 

the next day, me karen and michelle went to the diner.  after that we cleaned up her house because here parents were coming back today.  

when i went home i tried to sleep but just couldnt.  that sucked.  

greg, joe, and i played some tennis.  it was fun times.  

i wanted to go down the shore tonight but its too later already.  maybe ill go tomorrow. 

i wanna hang out with odin, but hes probably out doing something and due to my phobia of calling people, i probably wont see him tonight.  oh shucks.  

i have 2 mosquito bites that are red as hell.  

im gonna go do.  something...i suppose.  maybe eat?  meh.  well see.  call me if anyone wants to hang out."

we talked about college and jobs.  my mom wants me to get a job having to do with art.  we shall see what happens.  

when i got home, it was about 5:30, and mike zangs house was awaiting.  
when i FINALLY got there, everyone was drinking and it was a grand time. mikes parents are amazing people.  hes lucky to have a good relationship with them.  im jealous.  
after a while, me mike and billy took a trip to christy's house to watch the fireworks.  they were beautiful.  they made me happy  :)
we ended up going back to mikes house to drink.  im still fucked up right now.  
eventually we ended up at michelle's house where i listened to some fucked up conversations.  smart people i tell you.  
mike zang is an amazing, smart kid.  we are gonna paint together one day soon.  we talked for a long time...if i wasnt tired i would have continued our conversation, but he dropped me home and here i am.

<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=1><STRONG>NOTE: anything that is said in this journal is my opinion unless otherwise stated.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>i found out a lot of things yesterday; many were not pleasant to my ear.&nbsp; I found out that my best friend vicky isnt who i thought that she was.&nbsp; my vision of a beautiful, honest, trusworthy individual was shattered and broken into a billion pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>for one,&nbsp;i told her something that only i knew.&nbsp; something that wasnt supposed to be said&nbsp;to anyone.&nbsp; something that i was trusted with and&nbsp;something i trusted her with.&nbsp; whats funny is the fact that it took me around 10 minutes to tell her because i was busy making her pinky&nbsp;swear&nbsp;that she would NOT say anything.&nbsp; i guess that meant nothing to her, because she went and told someone.&nbsp; what a dissappointing moment in my life- thinking that i could trust her all along with anything that i have spilled&nbsp;to her; who knows what else has been spilled to other people.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>this is what got to me.&nbsp; this is what broke me down inside.&nbsp; i found out something that&nbsp;probably ony one person knew and that person was going to bring this to the grave with them due to their loyalty as a person.&nbsp; well, this person didnt&nbsp;say anything to me.&nbsp; This person, being angie, wrote in her journal one day, and this is what it said&nbsp; (im sorry angie, but dana had to tell me)...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>it&nbsp;said that one night, my best friend vicky recieved a phone call from a former hook up&nbsp;of mine named russ.&nbsp;&nbsp;he was at a bar on park avenue that is extremely close to victorias house.&nbsp; well, he ended up going over to her place and they hooked up.&nbsp; who knows if thats even all they&nbsp;did.&nbsp; oh, and by the way,&nbsp;its not like i wasnt hooking up with him at that point.&nbsp; i&nbsp;really dont know what was happening. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>when i heard this i began to cry hysterically.&nbsp; you dont know how bad i was hurt&nbsp;by this.&nbsp; someone that i trusted SO much just went around my back and hooked up with this kid.&nbsp; im not mad at this guy russ at all.&nbsp; im&nbsp;mad at the fact that she would be so quick to hook up with him.&nbsp; she, knowing my feelings for him,&nbsp;didnt even care how i felt.&nbsp; i knew that this kid liked her from a conversation that he had with her online that i wasnt supposed to be reading and when i found that out, i was like, ""i know youre gonna hook up with him.&nbsp; it may not be now, but when i go away to college youre still gonna hang out with him and eventually you guys are gonna&nbsp;hook up, i know it.&nbsp;&nbsp;and all she could say to me was, ""no, i would never do that to you, allison you mean the world to me i wouldnt fuck this friendship over.&nbsp; and i dont see him that way."" &nbsp;hm, so you woundnt fuck this friendship over infront of my face, but&nbsp;behind my back seemed like a good idea, eh?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>i just find it funny though.&nbsp; we combind forces because we had similar interest and similar situations that had effected us in a negative matter, such as getting fucked over by girls.&nbsp; we both had our stories about how girls are assholes and they fuck each other over so easily, especially when it comes to guys.&nbsp; heh.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>it sucks.&nbsp; i actually thought that i found my best friend and my soul mate.&nbsp; i could have seen this friendship lasting forever.&nbsp; i saw us moving to california and having an appartment together in the future; it was something that we both had dreamed of...and now those dreams have just drifted away in the distance.&nbsp; i dont think theyll ever come back.&nbsp;&nbsp;im just upset, because i feel like everyone has their own best friend.&nbsp; like, dana has michelle.&nbsp; i look at them and im so envious.&nbsp; their friendship is one that someone could be waiting their entire life for.&nbsp; but hey, im only 18.&nbsp; i have a long time to get fucked over more than i already have been.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>and you know,&nbsp;so many times i just dont listen to people, and i always end up kicking myself in the ass bc these people know what they are talking about.&nbsp;my brother met vicky once and told me, ""al, shes all about guys.&nbsp; shes gonna fuck you over bad.&nbsp; i can tell the kind of person she is.&nbsp; she wont care about you in the long run."" and of course, he was right.&nbsp; she didnt care about my feelings.&nbsp; but we learn from mistakes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>a lot of people dont like the guy-obsessed side of her.&nbsp; i just tried to dismiss it for as long as i could, but in the background i heard all these people complaining about how&nbsp;they dont like her because she flirts and touches and teases.&nbsp; not that they dont like her as a person, they just dont&nbsp;like how shes always all over every guy that she sees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>so i heard that she hooked up with mike ryan, this kid that my friend jenn&nbsp;liked for a while.&nbsp; now, jenn liked him maybe a week ago?&nbsp; two weeks ago?&nbsp; thats a short time to get over someone, and i think that&nbsp;anyone with their head on straight would realize this.&nbsp;&nbsp;now i havent talked to jenn about this AT ALL.&nbsp; never once was this situation mentioned, but if i were&nbsp;jenn i would be pissed at vicky.&nbsp;&nbsp;vicky said she didnt&nbsp;like him&nbsp;in that way.&nbsp; but, alas, she hooked up with him anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;i know that jenn said she didnt like mike anymore, but she still had feelings for him like, a week before...in my opinion jenn was in denial.&nbsp; i think she still had a little attraction...something that was still there.&nbsp; meanwhile, vicky&nbsp;always told jenn&nbsp;when&nbsp;mike called and stuff...i would have taken that as a slap in the face.&nbsp; but this is my&nbsp;opinion.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>oh. and i was thinking about it.&nbsp; she put angie in a horrible situation.&nbsp; angie, who is good friends with&nbsp;both vicky and i, was told not to say anything...and she&nbsp;didnt,&nbsp;but i mean, im sure she wanted to tell me&nbsp;because thats just keeping something from me, but if she told, then vicky would be mad.&nbsp; vicky just&nbsp;should have told me.&nbsp; at least&nbsp;i would have respected her a little bit more than i do now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>she wrote me something in my myspace account before she even knew that i know about the russ thing about how shes gonna stay out of my way for the time being, or however long i want her to even if i never want to talk to her again.&nbsp; she said shes not up for confrontation, so ""thats that.""&nbsp; well, since you arent up for confrontation, here it is, right in front of you.&nbsp; i just dont get you sometimes victoria.&nbsp; i hate people who avoid confrontation and dont wanna talk things out.&nbsp; you were willing to end a friendship over ThAt?&nbsp; wow.&nbsp; thats ridiculous.&nbsp; and listen, normally when i do something wrong to someone i say the words, ""im sorry.""&nbsp; this is a good time to say it.&nbsp; it means it will never happen again.&nbsp; those were words that seldom came out of your mouth at opportune times.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>and i know that i could have headed in a total different direction&nbsp;that i put myself in now.&nbsp; i could have beat the crap&nbsp;out of her, i could have called her and cursed her out (and have had her hang&nbsp;up on me), i could have IMed her, but would she really have listened?&nbsp; would&nbsp;i really have gotten everythign that ive been meaning to say out?&nbsp; no...and who knows if shell listen&nbsp;now, and i highly doubt this is everything ive been meaning to say, but i guess its a start.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>i guess the moral of todays journal is you cant trust ANYONE but yourself.&nbsp; sorry this was so long, but i wanted to clear my head.&nbsp;&nbsp;im thinking now, and maybe this&nbsp;WaSnT the best way to go along with this, but well see what happens.&nbsp; im not one for drama, but others are.&nbsp;&nbsp;and second chances come to few.&nbsp; they come to people who dont know what the consiquence would have been if they went along with their actions.&nbsp; i just dont wanna hear bullshit lies anymore.&nbsp; ah.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>love always,</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=1>well i just woke up a few minutes ago, but im able to do that considering i went to bed at around 6 or something.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Christy picked me up around 10 and we headed over to michelles house, where michelle, marcus, danielle, lindsey, puzak, matt, billy, chris, and mike (hopefully i didnt forget anyone) ended up hanging out.&nbsp; christy had this lighter that shocks people; it was fun watching everyones reaction until i did it to myself and ended up throwing the freakin thing.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>we listened to some amazing music.&nbsp; i forgot how much i liked the sublime self titled cd.&nbsp; and that kid chris who was there was like, ""man, i grew up on this music.&nbsp; you just dont know man.&nbsp; this guy and speed."" and danielle and i, thinking he said this bc he was old, asked him his age and when he told us he was 19 we looked at each other like....""whatthe fuck?!""&nbsp;&nbsp;this kid was just all wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; twas a good laugh. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>i basically sat on a couch with danielle, billy, and mike&nbsp;most of the night.&nbsp; we just talked of bullshit and looked at the yearbook from becton.&nbsp; i look like im angry in the tennis picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;:( </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>eventually,&nbsp;sellout came to the household and hung out.&nbsp; i officially met the two newest members.&nbsp; they seem like&nbsp;cool peoples.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>when it was time to leave bob stayed up to talk to michelle for a while i&nbsp;waited outside.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>when bob came out we walked around east rutherford and talked for a while.&nbsp; then we got in his car and talked even more.&nbsp; i hate crying in front of people.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>we talked about a lot of shit...family...friends...just anything that came up.&nbsp;&nbsp;i just&nbsp;got really upset when everything was brought up.&nbsp; when it was time for bob to leave&nbsp;due to the fact that he had work in like 2 hours (by that time it was like 5) i gave him like 298475 hugs and walked inside my house.&nbsp; my mom&nbsp;probably thought that&nbsp;i was smoking weed (she thinks the worst) bc my eyes were bloodshot.&nbsp; i went upstairs and didnt go to sleep.&nbsp; i couldnt.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>and now im here.&nbsp; i called toni a few minutes ago and just talked.&nbsp; im glad i can trust her so much with anything that i haveto say.&nbsp; shes blood related, which i dont know if it should, but it makes a total difference.&nbsp; i love her to death and i know that she would never fuck me over no matter what...and thats hard to come by.&nbsp; im kinda sad that we dont hang out as much as we should.&nbsp; when we were younger she was (well, of course she still is) my bestest friend in the whole wide world!&nbsp; we hung out all the time and we would plan out that when we were able to drive that we would hang out every single day.&nbsp; i wish we were still in the mindset of children sometimes.&nbsp; i would look forward to hanging out with her so much.&nbsp; and now we are both going to rutgers but different campuses.&nbsp; and it sucks.&nbsp; because im afraid i wont see her a lot.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>im just crazy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>ps.&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>and before you think that you've gotten away, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>know that im just plotting my scheme,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>&nbsp;not forgetting the game.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; </FONT></P>"

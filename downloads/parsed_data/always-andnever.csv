 Well this weekend was good =)
 Ive spent every weekend for the past..oh 4 weeks
 with My lover -timothy- <33 
""things are looking pretty serious,
we chat online everyday for like 3 hours""  =)=)

Saturday afternoon sucked >=| i was supposed to
get a car, so my dad calls the guy to say hey were coming
to buy the thing and the guy doesnt answer..so we drive
by and the car was gone..so my dad calls once more
& this time he answers but it wasnt something i wanted
to hear___ He sold the car 5 minutes b4 we called him !! errrrr
fucking A. i was so mad;; it was a nice car too 

  Same thing happened friday..went to go purchase an 01 grand am..what does the
  guy tell us when we walk in, ""nope sorry we just sold it"" 
   fuck off. 
   ill ride my bike.

But im happy that i only have to attend school
for 1 day this week. Vacations with my mother = thee best.   sortof.

And friday, the day i effing dread...is my court date..super.
     theres no way in hell im going to have a 9pm curfew. thanks =)

i miss friends.
<3 how everyone used to hang out and always want to do things.
   or randomly call just to talk or go for a night out.
    i miss summer also. this 70 degree weather in april is just teasing,
     because..in about a week its gunna rain like a bitch. 

Ive been really emotional lately and i dont know why?
  help-? who knows.
  i guess im just looking for so much more.
  life is strange.

mk bye.

                                              cause  we  care <3
                                        and  not  for  the  thrill."

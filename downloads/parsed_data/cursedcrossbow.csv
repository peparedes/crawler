I had a girlfriend last year around February... It lasted a couple weeks... Nothing more. Didn't really do much...

A week or so ago, she comes up to me and tells me to close my eyes and stick out my tongue...

...

Questioned her and she just told me to do it.

...

I did.

I tasted strawberries on my tongue... but it wasn't strawberries...

I asked what it was.

It was some new homemade lube that she tried to make.

We convince ourselves that life will be better after we get married, have a baby, then another. Then we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are. 

After that, we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage. We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, are able to go on a nice vacation, when we retire. The truth is, there's no better time to be happy than right now. If not now, when? 

Your life will always be filled with challenges. It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway. 

One of my favourite quotes comes from Alfred D. Souse. He said, ""For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin - real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, or a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life"". 

This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to happiness. 

Happiness is the way. So, treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time... and remember that time waits for no one. 

So, stop waiting... 
until you finish school, 
until you go back to school, 
until you lose ten pounds, 
until you gain ten pounds, 
until you have kids, 
until your kids leave the house, 
until you start work, 
until you retire, 
until you get married, 
until you get divorced, 
until Friday night, 
until Sunday morning, 
until you get a new car or home, 
until your car or home is paid off, 
until spring, until summer, 
until fall, until winter, 
until you are off welfare, 
until the first or fifteenth, 
until your song comes on, 
until you've had a drink, 
until you've sobered up, 
until you die, 
until you are born again 

...to decide that there is no better time than right now to be happy. 

Happiness is a journey, not a destination. 

Thought for the day: 

   Work like you don't need money, 
   love like you've never been hurt, 
   and dance like no one's watching."

WHY THE FUCK AM I COLLECTING ALL THESE GODDAMN MAGAZINES?!

:3 So yea... This is a long shot but... If you guys are magazine collectors and are in search of a particular issue... Check with me...

I have Modern Brides, BRIDES, and Gothic Beauty...

I'd probably ask for no more than $7 for each issue (that's including shipping and handling cause the bridal magazines are heavy like a bitch.) But who knows... Maybe I can do some combined shipping... I just want these magazines OUT!

If interested, name an issue number and which magazine and I'll check if I have it. If you want me to hold onto a magazine, I'll only hold it for a week... No more than that. A week is MORE than enough for you to get money in your paypal. :/

I copied this from someone's journal over on furaffinity. Cause it's sooooo fucking true!!

http://kotaku.com/5122671/a-field-guide-to-second-life-animal-hybrids

<i>Kotaku posts about furries and POOF! Drama explodes as the gamers and anime otaku swarm to the site to journal bomb with ANGRY FURRAH RAGE!

I find this particularly funny. If you were to actually do a comparison between groups, Furries, Gamers and Otaku... you'd really find little difference. For the most part they REALLY are the same god damn fandom. Swap out the furries with Megaman and Final Fantasy characters fucking and... yeah. Swap out wolves and dragons for giant, melon-busted Slayers sorceresses, Ghost cyborgs and mecha-armed soldiers... it's mostly the same. There are differences to be sure, but there is a certain parity between it all. Cosplayers are no different than fursuiters. Except in furry, you don't see 350lbs guys dressed as Sailormoon or Tifa Lockheart. All of the fandoms are pretty much the same basic nerditry underneath.

I've been to furry cons, anime cons and gamer cons. Honestly? There really is little different except a few quirks here and there. The fetish? All the same. Every fandom. EVERY FANDOM.

. . .

lolololol drama on Kotaku hahaha furfags

I don't know where I was going with this.

The end. </i>

I agree with him. They're all goddamn fandoms!! :D Little difference. They're just special in their own little geekdom. :3 I personally love ancient ass 8bit and 16bit video games (although I'll play some others so long as it doesnt give me fucking epilepsy). I read manga and watch Anime all the fucking time. And I'm an anthro artist. xD lawl~

<img src=""http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g83/mukistudios/th_TotTbadge-Punkin.png""></a>

Can also be seen here - http://www.furaffinity.net/view/1763576/
</center>

So... Here's the deal if you'd like one of your own.

(1) Send me at least 2 visual refs of your character. (I'm not limited to anthro, you may post ferals, humans, or other creatures as well)

(2) Name your favorite hobby or what your primary tool of the trade is.

(3) Let me know if you'd rather have your character clothed as is in your ref or clean-nudity (like in the above pic with the orange dragon).

(4) Comment with your paypal address so that I will send the bill. All comments are screened to protect you.

(5) Also in your comment, tell me which email address you'd like me to send the badge to. Or you can just look for it when I upload them to FurAffinity (my primary art account).

But I have some personal rules that I'd like for you to follow should you commission me for a badge...

<b>RULES</b>
(1) All chibis will be kept as simple as I can draw them yet make each chibi look as much as your character as possible. So I'd like to apologize in advance if any markings, spots, or stripes are off by a bit. I will do the best I can to draw the chibi as close to your character as possible

(2) You will have to laminate the badge yourself. I do not have a working laminator nor can I afford to go laminate them for you and mail them off to you. ;n; I am very sorry.

(3) ALL badges are traditionally sketched, traditionally inked, and digitally flat-colored. So the lineart may look a little funny, but I try to clean them up as much as I can digitally. :D

(4) Each and every computer/laptop's color settings are slightly different. So please don't get mad at me if I'm off by a few shades or something.

(5) Each of these badges takes a few hours to make since I do not own a tablet and am relying on a laptop-sensorpad to color all of these badges. I'm hoping to save up enough to get a tablet.

Do you have any other questions? Send a PM/Note them to either of my accounts:
mukichan (FurAffinity)
mu-ki (deviantArt)

Emails tend to send alot of things to the spam folder which is why I ask for PMs and Notes. ^^ Thanks so much in advance!

(1) Awesome friends on FA. They are at least a reminder that there are friends that are worth keeping and some that are just not worth my time and energy.

(2) Daniel and Niklas... As much as I love them both, they're both too goddamn far away from me. They listen to me when I'm upset. They comfort me when I'm torn to pieces. And they give me the best advice I ever need. Niklas may have a girlfriend, but he still makes time to cheer me up and give me the e-hugs that I need. And Daniel... (he's a cutey and I love him like a friend) He's there every single night to make sure I go to sleep with good happy thoughts and is always willing to listen to me when I'm upset. Even if he's at work. Funny how all our e-friends thinks that we're such a cute couple. xD

(3) Having to NEVER see that ugly-ass bastard again whom is seemingly having the time of his life on the other side of the world. May he wither forever lonely as he dies when his time comes. Oh, God... If you're reading this... Drop a bomb on him if you will. ^^ That will make my Christmas even DOUBLY cheerful!

(4) Alex-teh Squid, Alex-teh Plu, and Alex teh-girl. Squiddo is just plain awesome and gives me a good laugh every time I need one. Plu, although girlish, is always there when I need a pep-talk. And Alexandria has taught me an awful lot about the meaning behind friendship.

(5) My mom. She's suffered too much. And she's much more lenient than my father. Although my mom is strict, I love her to death. :3

(6) Jon and Kim, Cam and Lillian, Kieran and December, Christa, and Matthew. For being some of the few awesome and badass friends I still have left from Brookwood that actually still talk to me. Thanks for putting up with me guys!

(7) For my hands and feet. They get me to places, they help me make money, and most importantly... They let me enjoy life to the fullest.

(8) To be alive. I am Muki. Let me inspire people and direct them along towards the path THEY should walk. :3

"event","<b><u>I. Hotness VS Personality</u></b><br /> I've noticed a shitload of people trying to show me pics of figure 8 girls or macho muscle-y guys and then they'll be like &quot;Isn't s/he hot as fuck!?&quot; My usual response? A shrug... Just a shrug.<br /> <br /> Why do I respond like so? Well, simple. I simply DON'T like them. It's very unappealing to me. I hate girls who look &quot;perfect&quot; with their &quot;pencil straight hair&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot; body... I fucking HATE them. And there are guys with muscles and think that it's muscles that get the girls and shit... I personally HATE guys like that. I like proportional figures with a fitting personality. I love personality and if there's a click, I follow them around like a lost puppy. There was only ONCE in my life that I dated someone for looks, and I fucking regret it. <u>Majority</u> of people with &quot;good looks&quot; are assholes and bitches who think about NOTHING but themselves.<br /> <br /> Now the only type of figures that will blow that whole paragraph away are males with proportional but sculpted bodies such as <i>soccer players</i>. Lean figures. Not too much muscles, but enough for their figure. ^^ I also have a tendency to &quot;latch&quot; onto tall guys who are thin (but not anorexic). As for females... What I personally consider &quot;hot&quot; are the brunettes with a proportional figure that can dress appropriately and have at least sensible fashion sense.<br /> <br /> I like guys and girls who are understanding of others, has a sense of responsibility, open-minded, and is hardworking. If they have hobbies, that's great! It gives them a sense that they don't NEED to be around people to enjoy themselves. That's why I draw and crochet and stuff. Also, I don't care if they're religious or not so long as they are respectful of my own views. I grew up and was raised around &quot;Respect&quot; and it's a huuuuuuuuge thing for me. If you can't respect my views or my friends, fine, then you're not worth my time.<br /> <br /> <b><u>II. Porn, Art, and Me</u></b><br /> I'm an artist. An anthro artist to be exact (although that <i>does not</i> mean I don't draw humans and fairies and all that stuff). Because I specialize in fetish art (yes, furries is considered a fetish not a culture, ass-fuckers), I end up drawing porn and such. People automatically assume that I get all hot and bothered and shit when I draw porn. I most certainly don't. Much like theatrical performances and Gothicism, porn is an art. I don't get turned on at all in the least bit. I watch pornos and hentai and read adult novels full of sex; but none of it phases me at all. I shrug at it. Yes, I would say that some of it is sexy and stuff like that, but it most certainly doesn't turn me on. It's all an art. I do admit that I do &quot;overreact&quot; when someone buys me some Yaoi or Yuri mangas, or the latest novel by Anne Rice or maybe the newest volume of Bible Black or some porno. But it does nothing more than amuse me.<br /> <br /> Now, in the above paragraph, I mentioned &quot;Gothicism&quot;(sp??). What is it exactly? It's not about dressing in all black, listening to death metal, wearing black makeup, fishnets, and boots. THAT is a subculture. Subcultures is NOT art. I believe gothicism originally came from the &quot;grim and dark&quot; overtones in 18th-century Romanticism (which is also an art). We have the dark chandeliers and the grim and grotesque appearances of true art of Gothicism.<br /> <br /> <b><u>III. My Behavior</u></b><br /> Yes, I could be bipolar but I don't know for sure truly. I have a tendency to overexaggerate. But being emotional is NOT just a girl thing. Although most girls express their emotions more than guys do, I seem to express it more often than the average female. This is perhaps my one flaw that seems to get guys to either dump me, break it off, or scare them off the face of the earth. Although I am highly emotional, I believe you'd rather have me be emotional than to be of cold-heart and stoic. The last time I held my emotions in, I ended up letting my emotions take hold of me and I blanked out. Not a good thing if it involved hospitalizing people. Also, I cuss an awful lot. It's my way of expressing myself since I don't get to cuss at home without gaining a bitchslap across the cheek.<br /> <br /> Rarely, I tease people... If it gets to be overbearing, just tell me to stop cause I don't know what my limits are. I tease people to give myself a break from being conservative (what I usually am). Yes, I'm usually pretty conservative and keep to myself other than all the hugging (I love hugs), but there is a part of me that I need to let out once in a while before I really go insane. xD lawl<br /><br /><b><u>IV. Me, Guys, and Girls</u></b><br />I admit that I have mostly guy friends. This comes from having grown up pretty damn lonely and hating dresses and skirts and the color pink. I tore Barbie's arms and legs off every time someone bought me a Barbie doll. Since I hang around guys an awful lot, I'm often told that I was a &quot;slut&quot; and &quot;whore&quot;. I used to get all depressed and shit, but after having talked to some of my guy friends about it (I lurve you, guys~)... I don't need to feel that way anymore since I personally know what I'm like as does my friends. If my friends want to believe what others have said or misinterpret things without hearing from me, fine then. There's no need for me to be around cause, they just suck rhino penis if they just want to be jackasses like that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like most guys, I've attained this knack for speaking without thinking. I speak on impulse and piss off a shitload of people without meaning to. I will often times say things that will often times be misinterpreted. Like this one time, I told a girl that I had gone alot farther than I thought with this guy. She probably thought that I had sex or some shit like that when I've only just kissed or made out or something. I will say things that may be painful, but I certainly don't mean to hurt people. Also, unlike girls, I have horrible memory. I believe this comes with being around guys since they seem to have this knack for forgetting things easily as well. (I'm not saying all guys are forgetful.)<br /><br /><b><u>V. So I'm a Bitch?</u></b><br /> Yes, I cuss. Yes, I slap people and fight. Call me whatever you want, I don't give a shit. ^^ I will do what I want cause it makes me happy. If I want to drink, okay! Awesome!! If I want to cuddle, ubertits!! If I want to visit friends that I haven't seen in ages, so be it!! And people can just go fuck themselves if they want to get all anal and bitchy cause I don't hang out with them after they don't speak to me in months.<br /> <br /> <br /> So, there. If you still think you have a problem with me, let me know now and I can easily remove you from my friends list and forbid myself from ever speaking to or even associating myself to you again. Mind you, I wrote this to let out alot of pent up frustration that I didn't get to let out this week. I am not pointing at any one person in particular and if it sounds that way, I apologize and assure that I do not mean anything like that at all.<br /> <br /> ~K.<br />"

"event","That things will get better...

Squiddo... TekBoi... Tanis... Elly... Amelia... Wolfmagik... Nora... Kedo... Roberto... PeneBelle... T-bear... Kiko... everyone...

I've been through shits... You've been through shits...

Yes, it's hard to get over it all, but we just have to continue to believe that things will get better. Cause they will. They will get fucking better.

Everyday, you wake up. You're fucking alive. You're breathing.

Everyday we all make mistakes. We all have things dump on us. We all get beatings.

But we're still alive. Things happen for a reason.

Maybe you need to really get over that person. Maybe you need to really stop looking around. Maybe you need to really find someone that can actually relate to you. Maybe you need to really be yourself.

Be happy. Be calm. Open your eyes and leap. Don't be scared of what's in front of you. Quit being a coward.

I say things that perhaps hurt others even though I don't mean to hurt them. But that is how I am. Although I know I've hurt someone that I care about deeply, is it technically my fault if I hadn't known that it'd hurt them in the first place? No, it isn't. It's not anyone's fault. They wouldn't know that I'd hurt them that way and I didn't know that I'd hurt them. Last I checked... Hanging out with friends wasn't a crime. Finding happiness and fun isn't a crime.

... I'm not apologizing, but neither am I looking for one. It's NO ONE'S fault. Chin up, girl... You still mean an awful lot to me. Although I may have done something really nasty to you a few days ago... You should hear my side before thinking up accusations. Perhaps it's not as bad as you think.

If you honestly want to know... All I had done was kiss and bite. That was it. I never knew that I'd go as far as that but I did. It's human nature to get that way.

I will be waiting on hands and knees. Not for forgiveness cause I understand how you'd feel about this. But I will be waiting for the time you may trust me again. Even if it's just a little bit.

...

I love you, dearly... nee-chan...

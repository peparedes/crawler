She was my first horse my father gave me for my 12th birthday.That day, my dream of owning a horse finally came true! She was my shadow for 21yrs.She was there for me through grade school, junior high, high school, college, a divorce, and many other good and hard times of life. She made me so happy when I would be so sad.  She taught me and many others to ride. She made everybody laugh with her tricks and antics. She was one of my greatest ""teachers.""Some cruel people would say, ""its just an animal.....get over it!"" I say those people can go fuck themselves! Any true animal lover would understand my feelings completely. They say when losing a loved one, it takes time to heal. But a person never gets over it, you learn to try and ""cope"" with it.

The line is never neat in appearance and never goes on with much intensity. It always drags over the shadow looking drab. I hope that explanation made some sense. The only time a pencil goes on nice is if I put it on b4 the shadow when creating a smokey eye. Anybody else have this problem?

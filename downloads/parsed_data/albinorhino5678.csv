Need faith to make me numb
Live like a teenage christ
Im a saint, got a date with suicide

To be this young is oh so scary
To be this young im oh so scared
I wanna live, I wanna love
But its a long hard road, out of hell

You never said forever, could ever hurt like this

Spin my way out of hell, theres nothing left this soul to sell

Live fast and die fast too
How many times to do this for you?

Sell my soul for anything, anything but you



Today I am dirty
I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt

We are the nobodies
we wanna be somebodies
when we're dead,
they'll know just who we are

Yesterday I was dirty
wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt

Some children died the other day
we fed machines and then we prayed
puked up and down in morbid faith
you should have seen the ratings that day"

"event","i have my first hockey game in over a year at fucking 945 tonight, and it gets worse it is a 3 x 3 league which means i wont have any defense (im a goalie) and that all turns into very high scoring fast paced games. o yea and every time there is a penalty instead of sending some1 to the box there is a fucking penalty shot. 

o well over half of u probably didnt understand a word of u so i am back to the normal language

tomorrow is 420. hell yes 420 is a good day other than the fact that so much bad stuff has happened on it here are a couple examples (1) hitler was born on 4/20, (2) 4/20 is the anniversary of columbine o well i am getting stoned for the first time in 2 months tomorrow that is what this is mainly about and if i dont celebrate tomorrow fuck it i will just celebrate on wednesday

it is weird how much my life has changed in just a few days. i went from being very depressed to very happy, i started to really hang out with people again for the first time in like two months and im actually playing a sport that i thought the love for inside of me was deadened. maybe it also has something to do with the fact that the music i have been listening to is much more upbeat and positive then bands like mushroomhead and static-x and some others like 36 crazyfists but who the hell knows. o yea and i have cigarettes :)

ryan is back from louisiana he is no longer a virgin which upsets me bc i was looking forward to making fun of him for still being a virgin when he turned 18. hung out with him for a while tonight bc he wanted to smoke a square and i complied just told my parents i was goin on a walk and then met him at the bottom of the street sat in his car and then this chick with dreads he knows walked by and she chilled with us for a while. her hair was so damn cool i cant wait until this summer when i get my shit dreads with ash that will be a good time. 

only 29 days till no more school i cant wait and only 11 days till i get to go to atlanta to watch my cousin marron get married. the wedding wont be to great i personally think it will be boring as hell but for every wedding there is a party and at every wedding party ive ever heard of underage ppl wind up drunk as shit and if they wont let me drink fuck it ill steal a couple bottles and chill with my cousin who i am pretty sure is a cokehead havent seen him in 4 years so who the hell would fucking know but he does live in cali so it is very doubtful that a 17 year old kid who has a shitload of friend living near las angelas hasnt smoked. 

that is about all that is up in my life if u wanna talk to me just leave me a message in my journal ill be home at like 11 so yea peace"

"event","hey everyone check out this site http://www.kingsofleon.com it is so damn trippy i love it and the bands music kicks ass u should watch the videos page they all kick ass most ppl seem to like molly's chambers the most

here ill give u some of their lyrics

Free- is all that she could bleed
That's why'll she'll never stay
White- bare naked in the night
Just lookin' for some play
Just another girl that wants to rule the world
Any time or place
And when she gets into your head
You know she's there to stay

You want it
She's got it
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol

Slow- She's burnin' in your soul
With whispers in your ear
It's okay I'll give it anyway
Just get me out of here
You'll plead- you'll get down on your knees
For just another taste
And when you think she's let you in
That's when she fades away

You want it
She's got it
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol

those are the lyrics for molly's chambers that song kicks ass but it isnt their best i have to admit that it is a great song though and if u like any of the 60's and 70's rock music u should defianately like these and if u dont like classic rock u should check them out anyway they are awesome but i am bored so im gonna go find somethin to do peace"

Hello my name is Jimmy Pop and I'm a dumb white guy,
I'm not old or new but middle school fifth grade like junior high,
I don't know mofo if y'all peeps be buggin' give props to my ho cause she all fly,
But I can take the heat cause I'm the other white meat known as 'Kid Funky Fried',
Yeah I'm hung like planet Pluto hard to see with the naked eye,
But if I crashed into Uranus I would stick it where the sun don't shine,
Cause I'm kind of like Han Solo always stroking my own wookie,
I'm the root of all that's evil yeah but you can call me cookie,
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire,
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire,
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire,
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn,

Yo yo this hard-core ghetto gangster image takes a lot of practice,
I'm not black like Barry White no I am white like Frank Black is,
So if man is five and the devil is six than that must make me seven,
This honkey's gone to heaven,
But if I go to hell then I hope I burn well,
I'll spend my days with J.F.K., Marvin Gaye, Martha Raye, and Lawrence Welk,
And Kurt Cobain, Kojak, Mark Twain and Jimi Hendrix's poltergeist,
And Webster yeah Emmanuel Lewis cause he's the anti-christ,

yea i know what ur thinkin y the fuck would some1 take up like a page with song lyrics well what i say is fuck u im gonna take up another one :)

Every time I think that 
I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then 
I spend my time at rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to give me kicks and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales from all the fails and tribulations
No one ever sees
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

When vague desire is the fire 
In the eyes of chicks whose sickness
Is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played 
The neighbor folks make jokes
At who is most to blame today

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to set them free and 
Let them see reality
From where she got her name
And will they struggle much 
when told that such a tender touch of hers
Will make them not the same
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

And when the morning of the warning's passed
The gassed and flaccid kids
Are flung across the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone 
The songs have all been sung
And hung upon the scars

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to see the stains, 
The dead remains of all the pain
She left the night before
Or will their waking eyes reflect the lies 
And make them realize
Their urgent cry for sight no more
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

Sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch

ha mother fuckers

"event","i hung out with a hole bunch of ppl tonite for the first time in a long time. i also met this really cool jewish kid from valley i guess i should call him jewish kid #2. it is funny i know 1 jewish kid who doesnt smoke pot and i know 1 kid who does, therefor 50% of the jewish teenage population smokes pot based on my own personal research. o yea i also got some cigs without even having to show an id or anything and some free beer 2. then we went to tgi fridays for no apparent reason at all and wound up eating food which was in no way a part of our idea all any of us really remember is that one minute we were in johnston then the next we were sitting in the tgi fridays parking lot, but i guess that is what happens when u r hanging out with freshman. also met some cool college chicks who were gonna get drunk with us after we had known eachother for about 2 minutes. tonight was a blur and i wasnt even fucked up i just had a couple beers but my entire life is pretty much a blur so who the fuck cares. i am glad i am writing this shit down because i probably wont remember much of it in about a week and when people ask me what i did last weekend it will be nice to actually be able to tell them. but hey im blabbing on and on so i am just gonna go to sleep. yea that is right the tweeker is going to bed how uncommon is that shit?"

"event","i played hockey today for the first time in over a year. surprisingly i did really well it was just me dan and nick out there but my movement (im a goalie) and my pad saves were really good it took me all of 5 minutes to get used to being back out there and i think my playing has actually improved somehow maybe a break is what i really needed

o yea got to go driving today with my drivers ed instructor and i did good at that 2 i guess today is a just ""do good at things"" but not really bc i drove my mom up to williamsburg and then on the way home i almost fell asleep during a turn started drifting across the lane and almost slammed into this old lady. that would have sucked.

and i get out of rehab on 420. that seems kind of ironic to me.

o well i got to go take a shower peace"

"event","I've felt the hate rise up in me Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves I wander out where you can't see Inside my shell, i wait and bleed... I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here? Something about this, so very wrong I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this Is it a dream or a memory?

-MARILYN MANSON~DOPE HAT

If you can't already tell what my mind is dwelling on it means 1 of 2 things either you dont know me or you are just slow in the head. Meth is always on my mind these days someone will be talking about shoes and my mind will be wandering off into a world full of light bulbs foil and crystal. It is the shittiest drug in the world not to mention the hardest to kick, other than nicotine. I am getting off probation and out of rehab soon and i dont want things to go back to the way they were when i was using anything i could get my hands on, basically living the life of a junky always fucked up on something, stealing money, betraying friends, forgetting things before i had even been told them, scratching around this shitty world looking for answers to questions that do not exist, seeing shadow people out of the corner of my eye, living my life blind to the obvious. This world is a crappy place if u fall into the wrong group of people or just simply make bad decisions. I may not seem depressed in person but if you were to take a walk inside of my mind you would find a lonely piece of shit human being that in 15 years has not only made his own life a living hell but has personally made sure that people closest to him feel like they are in hell as well. I dont want out of this world, but i don't want to stay in this world either. What i need to do is to get my life back. I need to get back out in the world. I need to break out of this shell that has been around me since i returned from residental rehab. The only people who have really hung out with me are taylor and ryan. Everywhere i look i think the world is collapsing in on me. My old friends don't seem to want to be around me, and my new friends don't hang out with me. I could do more to make it so people would hang out with me such as actually calling people. But right now my entire life revolves around something i can't afford to do to myself anymore. <METH> As the song by three days grace goes that no1 seems to realize is even about meth (""everytime we lie awake after every hit we take"") ""I hate everything about you why do i love you."" That can describe any sober meth addicts feelings about the damn drug. The majority of meth addicts only continue to use it because of how bad they wind up feeling after they have not used it or when they wake up after 2 full days of sleep. I havent even used any of that shit for a while but i still continue to think about it constantly. Something even sadder to me is that i am opening up more in a damn journal entry that only one or two people will ever even notice let alone read.

o well i am blabbing on if u read this and for some reason u care or u can agree with me or some stupid ass shit i am tired of drowning in my own self pitty so i am gonna go pretend to do something productable shit i might even go to sleep i have been awake for 3 days in about 4 hours without the assistance of any drugs which seems very sad to me for some odd reason but o well i am off so peace out."

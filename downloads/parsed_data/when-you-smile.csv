"event","well im a bit annoyed at the fact i just had to spend 11 quid on a new fightstar ticket but it was worth it it rocked. i spent more time on the floor than in the pit. We all came to the conclusion that my ticket was stolen and we all have the same idea as to who it was.........
All in all it was a brill night although i lost 11 quid.
Rachel's nickname is Lacey and she will never know why hehehehehe, Becky bought a little ducky called Steven from Sweden lol and he is small. Rachel tried to kill him but failed. 
I stayed in Rachel's and now i'm dead cos my mum and dad stayed up til 3 in the morning waiting for me even though i told her i would probably go to Rachel's anyway i'm off bye x x"

"event","Hey guys, everyone freaking out over Hunger Games?  I know I am! I'm seeing it in about 7 hours ';sldf'as;dfk has anyone seen it yet? Tell me, what did you think?

I'm happy to announce I'm going to be writing recaps again, this time for Mad Men!  They will be more wordy and less crazy than my Lost recaps, but I am writing them all the same.  My friends over at <a href=""http://www.tvgasm.com/"">TVGasm</a> have asked me to recap the show, and I am more than happy to oblige, since Mad Men is one of my favorite shows ever.  I'll be posting the recaps there and I <i>think</i> on <a href=""http://ack-attack.tumblr.com/"">Tumblr</a>, since theackattack.net was hacked and I haven't been able to fix it up.

<b>Question: Does anyone know where I can find Mad Men screencaps? More specifically a site that posts them within 24 hours-ish of the show airing? Any help is much appreciated! </b> :D

I'm sure I'll post links to the recaps when they're up! Can't wait!"

"event","Hi all.  I've been getting lots of random comments lately asking me where the hell I've been, so I thought I'd give an update!

I live and work in Philly.  Love my job, love my place, love the city.  I've been <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695703-rachel"">reading a lot</a>. I've been <a href=""http://www.ravelry.com/projects/ack"">knitting a lot</a>.  I go and see the Philadelphia Orchestra a lot. I've been baking a lot. Life is good, for the most part.

<lj-cut text=""Since it&#39;s the beginning of a new year, here are all the things that I loved in 2011..."">

<b>Game of Thrones</b>
The show is great, but the books are better! Storm of Swords was definitely the best. My favorite characters are Jamie Lannister (like medieval, incestuous Sawyer, no?), Jon Snow (swoon), and Brienne of Tarth. Because she is a badass.

<b>The Walking Dead</b>
The show is awesome, so I read the comics too. I highly recommend them, even if you've never read comics before. They are crazy violent and awesome.

<b>The Hunger Games trilogy</b>
Like crack in book form.  I read all 3 in 5 days.  Couldn't put them down. I can't wait for the movies!!

<b>Jane Eyre</b>
I read the book and read the movie during December and loved them both, although as usual, the book is always better.  I highly recommend it!!

<b>American Horror Story</b>
I always say this should be called Crazytown, The Show.  It's soooo nuts, but so good.  I can't believe next year will be a whole different location and all new characters.  I will miss Tate and his emo ways.

<b>The Name of the Wind and Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss</b>
If you are into Lord of the Rings or the nerdier bits of Harry Potter, read this series.  It's SO GOOD.  The author is a fanboy himself, and it's like he just <i>knows</i> what we're all waiting to hear.  They are long books, but I blew right threw them in a few weeks.

<b>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2</b>
Close to perfect. I had a couple of issues with some changes they made (mostly that not one person cheered when Harry finally killed Voldemort - I mean, seriously?  He just defeated the Most Evil Wizard of All Time and not even a high five? Come on!)

Also, I went to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Florida and <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ack_attack/pic/00dpc2g2/s640x640"">I NEVER WANTED TO LEAVE</a>. The highlights are definitely the ride (which is amazing) and eating at the Three Broomsticks.  Seriously, never wanted to leave. Ever. 

<b>Spotify</b>
Best thing to happen to music in a very long time. I've gotten into like 8450384 new bands since I signed up.

Speaking of which...

<b>Best Albums</b> (Either came out or I discovered them in 2011)
The Rip Tide by Beirut (Best song: Goshen)
Yuck by Yuck (Best song: Get Away)
The King is Dead by The Decemberists (Best song: June Hymn)
Heart of My Own by Basia Bulat (Best song: Heart of My Own)
This is Happening by LCD Soundsystem (Best song: Home)
Middle Brother by Middle Brother (Best song: Theater)
Rodrigo y Gabriela by Rodrigo y Gabriela (Best song: Diablo Rojo)
Bon Iver by Bon Iver (Best song: Holocene)
Reservoir by Fanfarlo (Best song: Comets)

<b>Charlie Siem</b>
Have you heard of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=charlie+siem&amp;oq=charlie+siem&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=42l393l0l537l5l3l0l0l0l0l151l325l2.1l3l0"">Charlie Siem</a>, the most handsome, dashing, sexy violinist in England, nay, the world?  omg. I could watch him forever. He is the definition of a dream boat.

<b>My iPad</b>
When I bought it I honestly didn't know what the hell I'd use it for.  Now I can't imagine life without it haha. His name is Neville Longbottom and he is my constant companion.

<b>Podcasts</b>
My favorite podcasts this year:
- Doug Loves Movies (hilarious!)
- Radiolab (fascinating!)
- WTF with Marc Maron (interesting!)
- Comedy Bang Bang (weird but funny!)

<b>Portlandia</b>
This show is weird/hilarious and you should be watching it.  Just slap a bird on it!

<b>Louie</b>
Louie C.K. is revered amongst comics, and I can see why.  This show is kind of amazing. It's real in a way TV almost never is.

<b>Downtown Abbey</b>
Entertainment Weekly called it ""surprisingly addictive"" and I totally agree.  Season 2 is even better than Season 1. I watched both seasons in like 3 days over Thanksgiving weekend.

<b>Breaking Bad</b>
I've heard nothing but praise for this show, so I finally hunkered down and had a marathon over the last few days.  I'm only on episode 9 of Season 2, but it's good.  Real good. I can't wait to watch more.

"event","My thoughts on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1....

<lj-cut text=""Moooorning."">

I loved this movie.  So very much.  While watching the last 3 movies, every time they'd cut to a new scene I'd think, ""Oh no, they skipped ____!"" but this movie I found myself thinking, ""Oh wow, they kept this in!!""

I've seen it twice. So far. I'm glad I've got a long weekend coming up :D

<b>Things I loved:</b> 
- That they showed Hermione wiping her parents' memories, even though it wasn't in the book. And then how sad it made her to obliviate those two death eaters in London.
- The 7 Harrys scene was amazing LOL Fleur telling Bill she was hideous hahaha oh man.
- Hedwig trying to defend Harry ;_;
- That they included ""Harry is the best hope we have.  Trust him.""
- ""I'm holey, geddit?"" and George interrupting Harry and Ginny's kiss in the kitchen.  LOL
- That the conversation between Auntie Muriel, Elphias Doge, and Harry didn't go on forever like it does in the book. 
- And that all the Dumbledore/Grindelwald stuff was kept short and sweet.
- Lucius Malfoy is a hot mess and I love it.
- That they included ""The Ministry has fallen.  Scrimgeour is dead.  They are coming.""
- Ron and Hermione playing the piano. And them falling asleep holding hands. &hearts omg
- The fact that the snitch is always following Harry around.  Knowing what's actually inside that thing when it finally opens makes my heart explode.
- Dobby's sneakers, and telling Bellatrix he was trying to maim or seriously injure her.
- The actors they got to play the trio when they break into the Ministry of Magic.  The way Runcorn walked slayed me, and the guy playing Reg Cattermole was perfection.  ""We flush ourselves - disgusting!""
- The entire Godric's Hollow sequence, from the cemetery to Bathilda Bagshot's house. The whole thing was pretty much perfect.
- I'm glad they cut the fight between Harry and Lupin. That always made me sad.
- Luna was adorable as usual. ""That's an odd thing to keep in your sock.""
- I loved those snatchers, even if they looked like Pirates of the Caribbean extras. Especially when the one guy could smell Hermione through the enchantment.
- Despite the uncalled-for toplessness, I thought the destruction of the locket was freaking awesome. Including Harry diving into the water and the locket trying to kill him.
- Harry and Hermione dancing adorably, even if it wasn't in the book. (I just found out that's a Nick Cave song called ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKWydA69o9E"">O'Children</a>."")
- The 3 Hallows animation was super cool.
- ""Just keep talking about that little ball of light going into your heart and she'll come around.""

<b>Things I wish they would have included:</b>
- It's kind of silly, but the one thing I REALLY wish would have been in there was Ron screaming, ""HERMIONE!!!!!!! HERMIONE!!!!!"" while they were locked in the Malfoys' cellar.  He just stood there. Boo.
- Dudley saying thanks to Harry.
- Kreacher actually becoming nice.
- How come Voldemort didn't kill Grindelwald at Nurmengard?
- And how come he didn't show up at Bathilda's house?
- Ron reading that ""How to pick up chicks"" book and putting the moves on Hermione.
- I'm bummed they didn't have the sign outside Harry's house in Godric's Hollow with the messages people wrote him, like ""Good luck Harry, wherever you are!"" I always loved that.
- Wormtail's hand didn't kill him, but I have a feeling that may end up in the second movie.
- Along with ""Here lies Dobby: a free elf"" ;_;
- I liked that the locket made that weird ringing sound, but I wish they'd have given it that creepy heartbeat it has in the book.

<b>Things I wish they would have changed:</b>
- One of my favorite lines in the book is after Ron has come back, and he tells Harry that Dumbledore must have left him the deluminator because he always knew he'd leave them, and Harry says, ""No, it's that he knew you'd always want to come back."" It's such a sweet line, and in the movie Ron says it about himself, which didn't have the same impact.
- I never really cared about Harry/Ginny, but I can see H/G fans being bummed that their relationship is really on the back burner in this one, whereas in the book the thought of Ginny is what got Harry through a lot of this stuff.
- Bathilda Bagshot's body decomposing was cool, but I was expecting to see the snake actually coming out of her neck!
- That is totally not how I imagined Mundungus Fletcher, although that guy did a good job.
- As usual, I thought Bellatrix was super cartoony and over the top.  I wish they'd tone her down a bit, maybe lower her hair a foot or so.
- Even though it should have been the cruciatus curse, I liked how Bellatrix carved ""Mudblood"" into Hermione's arm. (And did you notice Hermione watching that piece of hair float down?  The hair that will make the polyjuice potion for when they go to the bank, amiright?)

<b>Random thoughts:</b>
- Emma Watson is ridiculously pretty.
- Somehow almost every set and scene looked exactly like it did in my head, which is crazy.
- I thought the trio's acting was better than it's ever been. 
- I like that the pace was slower and there were shots with nothing in particular happening in them, especially during the camping scenes.
- As with the books, I always liked Harry as a character, but I didn't really LOVE him until Deathly Hallows.  It's when he really came into his own and was a grownup for the first time, and I like how that really comes through in the movie. Aw.

The last movie is going to be out of control amazing.  I just know it.</lj-cut>"

"event","01. Been rewatching Doctor Who with my roommate, who has only ever seen the most recent series, with Eleven and Amy Pond.  We just wrapped up Nine last night and we're finally on Ten and I am v. excited about it. I had almost forgotten how much I loved Rose.  And Captain Jack.  &hearts  I'm wondering if I'll be able to get through ""Doomsday"" without bawling like an idiot.

He's also starting to watch Supernatural, which also makes me happy because I've always wondered what a guy would think about that show.  So far so good!

02. I finished <u>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</u> this weekend.  My <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695703"">Goodreads</a> review because I'm lazy:

While this one wasn't as intriguing as the first in the series, or as action packed as the second in the series, it's still a solid story. True, in many places it began to drag, especially when discussing decades-old Swedish politics (the names and places are especially hard to keep track of), but the trial and its outcome are pretty damn satisfying. My least favorite of the trilogy, but if you're into these books I wouldn't skip it.  

03. I've started reading <u>The Passage</u> by Justin Cronin and LOVE it so far.  I'm already into Part II.  It's weird and scary and touching and so well written.  Love it.  I was planning on saving it for my trip to Hawaii (I leave in 13 days!!!) but I'm almost positive I'll be finished it by then.  I think I'll either bring <u>Await Your Reply</u> by Dan Chaon or <u>Zeitoun</u> by Dave Eggers - you guys read either of those?

04. Yesterday I was home sick and finally got to see two movies I've been waiting to watch forever.  <i>Paper Hearts</i> was super cute and everyone who has a crush on Michael Cera should watch it.  <i>Bright Star</i> was a gorgeous movie, and anyone who is into period pieces should definitely see it because it's really, really good.  I wish Jane Campion made movies more often!

05. I finally got a Droid phone!!!  I love it.  Thanks to all of you who told me about yours a few months ago, you guys really helped me out!

06. True Blood has been so crazy lately, I luff it.  Feel free to discuss!  For those that have read the books - is that how you pictured Holly??  She scares me LOL.

07. Mad Men: Between the conga line last week and the scene with her husband this week, I swear I love Joanie more every day.  Don continues to make me sad for him.  The lack of Betty is just fiiine with me.  Lane's Texan accent in the restaurant FTW.  More Pete, plz."

<b>Keywords:</b> [spn] Too precious for this world

The keywords are from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuv2Ji6zEM"">one of the funniest Supernatural scenes ever</a>.  Sam Winchester is usually so emo and broody and wanting to <i>share</i> himself, it's kind of hilarious that Jared Padalecki is so awesome in real life.  I'm pretty sure this icon is from one of the hundreds of adorable Supernatural outtakes.

<b>Keywords:</b> [bsg] No longer empty and frantic

This is Gaius Baltar and Six from Battlestar Galactica in one of my favorite moments from the series - they hear a baby crying amidst the rubble of a big battle, which was part of a prophecy...it's all very cool.  It's like them witnessing destiny unfolding in front of their eyes or something.  Also, I love the cropping on this.  The keywords are from Radiohead's ""Fitter Happier.""

This is Peggy Olsen, one of the stars of Mad Men and one of my own personal heroes.  She's the young girl hired as a secretary in an ad agency in the early 60's who deals with lots of sexist bullshit to actually make something of herself.  DIY, baby.  Punk rock.

One of my favorite moments on all of True Blood - Eric basically devouring a person alive and then asking Lafayette, his prisoner, if he got blood in his hair.  ""Pam's going to kill me.""  Pam + Eric = obvious OTP.  So fierce.</lj-cut>

In other news I saw Arcade Fire last night and they rocked my socks off.  Oh em gee.  So, so awesome.  They closed with ""Wake Up"" and it was EPIC.  The new album is fantastic.  I &hearts those guys."

I'm seeing the Arcade Fire and Spoon tonight.  I am very excited.  The new Arcade Fire album is spectacular, I got it a week ago and haven't stopped listening to it yet. <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128878239"">You can stream it here</a>.

<lj-cut text=""Mad Men."">

Don Draper is so pathetic and sad this year, but I love it.  I love that no woman can walk into his lair without getting sexed.  And I love that people are seeing Betty for the psycho hose beast she is, and that Sally lost the lisp.  I love that Joanie and Roger are back to being friends, and that the Lucky Strikes guy was such a dick to Roger.  I think Peggy's whole ""I'm a virgin"" thing with Karl from Lost is classic.  Peggy's not Peggy if she's not hiding something.  I also love the new guy Joey, I think he is adorable.  

I'm just really happy it's back.  I can't believe what happened between Don and his secretary.  That was SO AWKWARD.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""True Blood."">

Since I've read the books and basically know what's happening this season, I won't theorize about what's going on. Bill attacking Sookie was terrible, although in the books it's even more violent and scary.  And for those who have read the books - what did you guys think of the Claudine thing on the show? I was wondering how they were going to introduce all that stuff, I think it was pretty cool, albeit strange haha.

Things that are particularly awesome:
- Eric's fake smiles when he's with the King, and his concern for Pam
- Franklin.  Everything about Franklin. So ridiculous.
- Evil Bill.  
- Lorena, may she RIP
- Lafayette, as always
- The King of Mississippi, even if he's a dick
- Alcide's frequent nakedness

Things that are not so awesome:
- Sam's stupid white trash asshole family. I want a bunch of werewolves to eat that father.
- Tara.  In general.
- Debbie Pelt, the trashiest character of all time.
- I love Jason, but I am not loving this Crystal thing, or his whole cop thing.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Let's talk about True Blood for a moment, shall we?"">

1. Bill ""breaking up"" with Sookie was sad, but not as sad as that face he made at the end when he sensed her fear.  Lorena needs to die, stat.  Bitch is crazy.
2. Eric's Sookie daydream >>> all. He smells like the ocean in winter!!  Or he wishes he did, I suppose.  Also, I want this whole show to be Eric and Lafayette riding around in that sports car, chatting.
3. I can't believe Bill was the Queen's Procurer!  That is different from the books and it makes Bill much less noble and gentlemanly, no?  In the book he did like...paperwork for her lol.
4. Speaking of not like the book, WTF Russell Edgington supplying werewolves with V!?  That was crazy.  Also: Debbie Pelt is so gross.
5. Franklin Mott was a creeper in the books but he is scary as hell on the show.
6. Nobody better lay a finger on my <strike>Butterfinger</strike> Pam.  That magistrate is a sick puppy. 
7. Sawyer rules should apply to Alcide: (ABS) Always Be Shirtless, but if you must wear one, make it plaid.  Yowza.
8. Sam's family makes me want to barf.</lj-cut>

I've been playing the new Harry Potter LEGO Wii game during every spare moment I have.  It is fantastic.  I highly recommend it to any HP fans that have never played the LEGO games before.

I have lots of cleaning and unpacking to do, which is always a <i>blast</i>.  My cat is having some kind of nervous breakdown over the move, she hasn't let me sleep through the night since I brought her to the house.  And she hasn't eaten anything in 3 days.  Lovely.

But other than the cat and no cable, no internet, the fact that the gas is not turned on, and the fact that it's been over 100 every day this week, the new place is great and my new job is going really well.  For now it seems that everything's coming up Rachel."

WHAT IN THE FUCK WAS THAT ENDING WITH BILL BREAKING LORENA'S NECK AND BANGING HER BACKWARDS LOLOL OH MY GOD.

You'd think this show had gone far enough with those two (that time they pretended to be those French people...yikes) and yet here we are.

O_O HAAHA I was just sitting here actually saying ""OH MY GOD OH MY GOD.""


Also:

1. Sam's father needs to put his pants on because if I have to see his junk in those disgusting tighty whities one more time I will puke.

2. Tara banging Franklin was not unlike seeing someone have a seizure.  I still don't care about Eggs.

3. Worried, slightly emo Eric is awesome.

4. As is him selling Lafayette a car for $1.

5. ALCIDE.  IS.  HOT.  I have a thing for bearded men in plaid shirts.  And he is so...<i>big</i>.  I never liked Alcide much in the books, but I already like the TV Alcide way more.

6. Did anyone else realize that head werewolf guy that was in the meeting with the King of Mississippi was the freighter captain from Lost?

ETA 7: Terry's reaction to Arlene's pregnancy > ALL.


I STILL CANNOT GET OVER THAT ENDING.  That was the campiest and most insane this show has ever been, even with that giant meat statue from last year LOL.</lj-cut>

Also, I finally saw the Doctor Who finale last night and <i>loved</i> it.  I think this whole series has been brilliant, apart from the stupid green people living in the the center of the earth.  That ending was so SO good!  It had everything!"

""The Ack Attack lady has it right. Read her points and go to bed. Then you will wake up feeling good about LOST and yourself.""

LOL These people have no idea that I saw that.  I don't even know why this amuses me so much, but it totally does.  I guess it's because my whole mission in life over the last few years has been helping people love this show as much as I do, so it's always nice to hear it actually worked. &hearts"

Christian Shephard?  Seriously? haha Kate.

Jacob = Worse than Yoda

""This would all be so sweet if we weren't all about to die.""

Hurley tranquilizing Charlie!!!  LOL 

Rose & Bernard saving Desmond = AMAZING. I was so happy to see Vincent again.

""I'll make it hurt"" SMOKEY YOU ARE A BASTARD.

SUN AND JIN REMEMBERING THE ISLAND WAS SO SO BEAUTIFUL AND SAD.  Them speaking English immediately was crazy.

Richard aging!

FRANK LAPIDUS!!

JULIET IS THE MOTHER!!!  I knew it!!

SHANNON AND BOONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Jack and Smokey lowering Desmond into the waterfall with the long camera shot was exactly like the shot of them looking into the hatch, that was so cool!

Daniel seeing Charlotte was cute.

Desmond unplugged the island and nothing happened!!  WTF!  And then Smokey started bleeding!  

KATE AND CLAIRE AND THE BABY AND CHARLIE: THIS SCENE MADE ME BAWL, NOT GONNA LIE. I cried so hard my nose started bleeding, true story.

JACK AND MOCKE EPIC LION KING BATTLE ON THE MOUNTAINTOP!!!

KATE KILLING SMOKEY?  JACK GETTING STABBED?  SUPER EPIC BATTLE IN THE RAIN?  All bad guys have to fall to their deaths, that was SO AWESOME.

Locke waking up from the surgery and him and Jack flashing?  And Locke telling Jack he doesn't have a son?  Oh my god.  I feel like my heart is going to explode.

JATE IS FATE?  OH MY GOD.  I had no idea.  NO IDEA. brb throwing up forever.

""I don't believe in a lot of things, but I do believe in duct tape.""

Sawyer calling Smokey Smokey and Frank Chesty was awesome.

Sawyer and Juliet...look, guys.  It was done very beautifully and I'm sure I'll find it much more moving in a few years when I am over my 5 years of wasted Skate shipping.  I'm happy for all of you who were right, but I am bitter LOL.

(P.S. Knowing the ending now, I am going to pretend that Sawyer and Kate went back home together after the plane.  A girl can dream, right?)

""You were right, Jack.""
""There's a first time for everything.""

Ben telling Locke he was special, awwwww.






OH MY GOD.  So the Sideways World was Purgatory/Limbo/What have you?  And they all found each other so they could get to heaven?  So we don't know what happened to everyone else on the island after?  I think I like it...so Hurley took over, Ben was his #2, they helped Desmond get home since Hurley was a much nicer guys than Jacob...everyone else went home and lived happily ever after, eventually died, and then they all met up and ""moved on"" together?  I like it!

It's like if when you died you went to hang out somewhere (where time doesn't really exist) and you wait around for all your BFFs and whatnot to show up, and then you all move on together.  I like it.  It's surprisingly a simple end to the most complicated show of all time.

I always knew Christian would be important somehow!

Man.  I can't believe it's over.  


I'LL WRITE MORE WHEN I CAN COMPUTE THIS.  

ETA: So after all that it really was Live Together, Die Together?  LOL

ETA 2: I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.  HOW THE HELL DID DESMOND GO BETWEEN WORLDS?????????  I mean okay that was Limbo or whatever, but how did he do that?  Was he like...a deity or something?  And what did Eloise know about it?  Did she stay there in limbo waiting for Daniel to move on with her, and that's why she tried to stop Des?  Methinks yes.  But how Desmond could swing between worlds is beyond me.

ETA 3: On Jimmy Kimmel they just showed the first episode when they first showed the plane in the Sideways World and there is the turbulence and Rose goes, ""It's okay, you can let go"" so it's like that was the moment Jack died on the island and the limbo world began!  WHOA!  Maybe Rose had already been enlightened?</lj-cut>"

Desmond called about Christian's coffin with an American accent THAT WAS WEIRD.

Jack sewed Kate up just like she sewed HIM up.  I felt really bad for all of them when they were standing there on the beach!

""I'm making a citizen's arrest"" LOL BEN I LOVED DESMOND'S PUNCH/FLASH.

A secreter room.  It was the one summoning me! Alex under the fence!

Jacob came to Widmore after the freighter?  I wonder what Widmore's plan was before Jacob's visit.  But Jacob specifically asked for Desmond?

Desmond turns himself in and goes to jail with Sayid AND Kate LOL I forgot they'd all be in there!

Sawyer blames himself for everyone dying, but it's okay.  I will comfort him.  Physically.

Tiny Jacob scaring Hurley in the jungle was funny haha.

So does Ben really want the island, or does he just want to kill people?

DANIELLE!!!!!!!!  WHY DID BEN CRY???  I wonder if he got a flash of his life with Alex, or he was just really touched.  Hm.

LOLOL BYE TINA FEY. DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU ON THE ASS ON THE WAY OUT.

UM SMOKEY?  DON'T KILL PENNY PLZ.

BEN KILLED WIDMORE OMFG :LSDFL;'KS';FLKADS;'LFKL;'ADFKL;SD I CAN'T BELIEVE IT I always thought Widmore was so important!  I mean I love that they made Benry evil again, but COME ON.

I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKING COINCIDENCE FOR FATE!!!!!!  MISTAH EKO SHOUT OUT!

YOU WERE ALL FLAWED I CHOSE YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE LIKE ME, ALONE, LOOKING FOR SOMETHING YOU COULDN'T FIND OUT THERE, YOU NEEDED THIS PLACE - AGH JACOB!  So what, all the other people on the plane were happy, so it was cool to just kill them?

BECAUSE YOU BECAME A MOTHER SZ';LDF;LS'KD so all those people could have been Candidates after all?

I HOPE SO BECAUSE HE IS CERTAINLY GOING TO TRY TO KILL YOU.

JACOB GAVE THEM ALL A CHOICE!  AND JACK VOLUNTEERED!?  He'd better not be the real replacement or else I'm losing a bet, goddammit.  I love how no one even tried to stop him LOL.

IS JACK IMMORTAL NOW?  THIS IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

OMG SO HURLEY REMEMBERS EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ISLAND NOT JUST LIBBY?  He remembered Ana-Lucia!  (I love that she was corrupt, by the way).

I kind of love that Sawyer didn't help Kate escape haha WHAT A STAND UP GUY.

HOW DID DESMOND CREATE THIS GIANT PLAN?  LOL THIS IS NUTS.  GOING TO A CONCERT, IT'S LIKE EVERYONE'S GOING.  IT'S LOST'S ""WE ARE THE WORLD.""

So Smokey is going to destroy the island?  And Desmond is the failsafe?  And he's going to get Desmond to HELP HIM? I think Desmond's going into the sparkly cave of light, and he's going to not only survive but he's going to like...somehow bridge the two worlds.  idek.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF THIS MEANS.  AND THE FACT THAT THE FINALE'S ONLY A FEW DAYS AWAY MAKES ME NOT WANT TO EVEN BOTHER FIGURING IT OUT.

;LSKDJF;LKASJDFL;KAJDSKL;FJSDKL




THAT EPISODE WAS RIDICULOUS. I AM SO CONFUSED.  SO VERY CONFUSED.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THAT CONCERT? ';SLDKF';LADSKF;L'ADKS


P.S. WHAT HAPPENED TO RICHARD?  I looked away when that happened to him, did Smokey come and take him away?</lj-cut>"

<a href=""http://www.knitpicks.com/yarns/Felici_Self_Striping_Sock_Yarn__D5420165.html"">Knitpicks has a special Doctor Who sock yarn right now</a>!  It's the one called ""Time Traveler"" obviously.  I think I need to get some even though I never ever finish a pair of socks.  ETA: Yeah I just bought some, how could I pass that up?

Speaking of Doctor Who, I loved this week's episode.  I really do love this new Doctor and how he's kind of mean sometimes, and how he's getting old and crabby.  And I also think Rory is adorable, and I like what they did with Amy in that episode.  Bravo.

2. In other news, after 7 weeks of job searching I finally landed my first interview!!  WOO!  It's at a big science university in Philly for an administrative coordinator position.  I'm not getting my hopes up since it sounds like they are interviewing lots of people, but it's still something.  (But honestly I wouldn't mind doing this unemployed thing a bit longer, it's really quite relaxing haha!)

3. I've been spending all my time getting stuff ready for my big Lost party this weekend.  I can't believe the finale's almost here.  I feel like someone I love is about to die or something, it's ridiculous.  It's worse than when Harry Potter ended.  It's not just the show ending, but my recaps and everything that goes along with them!  How depressing.  I mean it's just a TV show, but still.  Lost has been a gigantic part of my life for 6 years and in less than a week it's going to be all over!  ;_;"

First off, I liked that episode, I don't care what you all say LOL.




Speaking English/Spanish? WTF?  How'd she do that? She definitely did some magic to make the real mom speak English, right?

Twins!!!!!!  And she killed the mom right away!!!  OMFG!

""What's dead?""
""Something you will never have to worry about."" - It's funny they don't know what death is, but Smokey knew what a man was when he saw them. 

""I've made it so you can never hurt each other."" - HOW!?  

So the Tunnel O' Light...that was weird.  So it's like the source of life and death and rebirth, but WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

Smokey seeing his mom was SO much like Ben seeing <i>his</i> mom.

""Why do you love him more than me?""
""I love you in different ways."" - NICE, MOM.

Frozen donkey wheel!  

So going into the light would be worse than dying?  Wah?  And the wine made them the same?  Is that what happened with Richard, when he shared wine with Jacob, making Richard the same as Jacob?

So the light turned Smokey into Smokey???  And the mom and MIB are Adam and Eve??? <strike>But then how was Jacob always talking to Smokey all those times we saw him, was he a ghost??  I thought Jacob couldn't see ghosts...?</strike>

ETA: Okay, so Smokey just took on the form of his own dead body, that makes sense!

So the woman stole the babies to be her replacements - is that why the Others were always stealing babies?

Are Walt and Smokey ""special"" in the same way??  Maybe?

I can't believe we still don't know Smokey's name - are we to assume he just has no name?  LOL weird.  What did all those Viking people call him?  ""Hey you?""

ETA: So Smokey killed their mom with the dagger by stabbing her right in the heart without letting her speak first, which is exactly the way everyone keeps telling other people to kill Smokey.  Hm.

ETA 2: I like how the mother told Jacob that he had no choice in becoming the island's protector because now we see why he had no problem drawing all these people to the island and changing their fates.  He never had a choice, so neither do they.

Although I do wonder how he figured out he could leave the island to go visit people...

ETA 3: How exactly did the woman burn and kill that whole village?  Was she possibly Smokey-like too?  And that's how she knew what happened if you went into the light?</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""I have many party ideas, I thought I would share..."">

In case you guys are looking for ideas...

- <a href=""http://www.craisin.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/02-mysampleboardingpass.png"">fake Oceanic boarding pass</a> for everyone
- I'm making a Rice Krispie treat 4-toed statue
- and possibly a hatch computer cake
- hanging a glow in the dark hatch map on the bathroom door
- having a disembodied hand that says ""NOT PENNY'S BOAT"" stuck to my sliding glass window
- giving out airplane-sized bottles of liquor 
- giving everyone lottery tickets with the numbers
- I'll have the brainwashing video from Room 23 queued up on a computer
- playing only music that's been on Lost or the OST itself
- Dharma labels on EVERYTHING
- including a big Dharma logo on the front door
- lost of Hawaiian food like pork, pineapple, mangoes, etc.
- Mai Tais, Pina Coladas, etc etc.
- scattering luggage around
- recreating the face of a Dharma van that people can stand behind and take pictures
- possibly converting part of my porch into the fuselage...LOL

This needs to be epic.  And it will be.  Oh it will be. Hopefully everyone coming will wear costumes.  I've decided to be Danielle Rousseau because my hair vaguely resembles hers and I'll get to carry a bigass rifle LOL.

If I was working right now this list would be cut in half, but I have nothing to do all day, so planning for this party just became my number one priority LOL.

If anyone out there in LJ land lives close to Philly you are more than welcome to come!</lj-cut>

2. I met Charlaine Harris, author of the Sookie Stackhouse (True Blood) books last week.  She did a Q&A for like an hour in which she proved to be hilarious and awesome and adorable.  Then I stood in a line for 1.5 hours by myself so she could sign my book.  When I finally got up to her, I said, ""I'd like to thank you on behalf of womankind for creating Eric,"" to which she replied, ""Well, if you ever need a Viking, you know where to go"" LOL.

Whenever Eric was mentioned during the Q&A the crowd went BERSERK.  I mean I knew most people liked Eric, but when the woman who introduced Charlaine mentioned ""The Northman"" I thought the roof was going to cave in LOLOL.  Nice.

I finished <u>Dead in the Family</u> 8 hours after I bought it on Tuesday last week, so if anyone wants to discuss, I'm in!

3. I'm almost done reading <u>The Girl Who Played with Fire</u>!  It's so good!  And even though the 3rd book in the series doesn't come out in the US until May 25th, I found a UK copy of it online and it's being shipped right now haha I couldn't wait!

4. You know what's so good right now?  Fringe.  And Chuck.  And Supernatural.  WHY IS IT FINALE TIME ALREADY? ;_;

5. And I don't think I ever posted about it, but I love the new Doctor.  And Amy.  They are both adorable.

6. I'm also in love with Chris Pratt, aka Andy from Parks & Recreation. Big and stupid.  Mmmm."

Locke refused the surgery because he made his dad into a vegetable?  So he's punishing himself?  Oy vey.  (And is Sawyer going to show up and try and kill Vegetable!Cooper?  LOL)

Bernard called Jack out flirting with Rose LOL

Kate's name crossed out - sry2say you are useless, Miss Austen.

Sun and Jin were super cute, albeit speaking English for no reason.

SMOKEY ATTACKED!!!!!!! ""I'M WITH HIM"" LOLOL YEAH!!!! Awesome.

Plane rigged with bombs!  Did Widmore really want to blow them all up, or just Smokey?

Get Smokey in the water?  Then what?

Locke having his dreams about the button!

Catch a Falling Star music box!

KATE SHOT!  BACKPACKS SWITCHED!  THEY LEFT CLAIRE!  AND SMOKEY'S PLAN WORKED ;SLDKF';ALSKDF'L;D OMG.

THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER ;_____________; SAYID, LAPIDUS, SUN AND JIN ALL AT ONCE???????? ;_____________; OH MY GOD I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.  AT ALL. I NEVER THOUGHT BOTH KWONS WOULD GO AT THE SAME TIME.

And then Jack tried to save Locke and he wouldn't let him, but that little exchange was pretty cute.

And then we got Jears but I'm going to allow them because I was totally crying too.





I AM SO SAD RIGHT NOW.  ME AND SMOKEY ARE DONE PROFESSIONALLY.

"event","You guys <a href=""http://www.charlaineharris.com/calendar.html"">Charlaine Harris is doing a book tour</a> for the newest Sookie book!  And she's going to be in Philly this Wednesday!!  And I'm totally going!!!  HUZZAH!

I'm so excited. If anyone else will be there let me know!

In other news, this week I saw two concerts: the first was <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Owen+Pallett"">Owen Pallett</a>, aka <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Final+Fantasy"">Final Fantasy</a>.  He plays the violin in ways no one else does.  He plays pieces of the songs and then loops them, then layers the loops until it sounds like there's a whole orchestra playing and not just one guy.  <a href=""http://blip.fm/~pbegf"">Check out this video of him playing one of his new songs</a> it is like...amazing, dude.

Anyway, inspired by Owen, 3 of my friends and myself have decided to take up playing the violin, which has been a lifelong dream for me.  I bought a violin off eBay last week, and one of my friends is going to give us lessons.  I'm not sure how long this will last, but it should be both hilarious and awesome.

And then last night I saw <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Frightened+Rabbit"">Frightened Rabbit</a>, who are this Scottish Indie Rock band whose music is constantly being used on Chuck.  They were really good, although the venue was a super crowded, insanely hot church basement full of douchebags.  Apparently while their music is awesome, a lot of the fans suck.  We had some drunk sorority-type girl dancing around in front of us the whole time and doing that Breakfast Club fist-pump thing the entire time, and she kind of ruined the mood.  Otherwise it was good.

In book news, I read <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo"">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a> and loved it, and now I'm halfway through <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5060378-the-girl-who-played-with-fire"">The Girl Who Played with Fire</a>.  These books are hard to put down.  I never read stuff like this, but if you're looking for something cool to read over the summer, I highly recommend them!

I haven't posted about knitting in forever, but I've been working on a wedding gift since February: <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ack_attack/pic/00d0dqbh/s640x480"">a blanket for my cousin</a> that is taking FOR-EH-VER.  It's still pretty, though.

I'm still looking for a job, although collecting unemployment definitely curbs some of the anxiety about not working.  It's like free money.  It's weird.  I'm going to start going on lots of little mini-trips to places I've never been, just because I have all the time in the world right now.

I'm also planning a big Lost finale party.  ;_; I want to plan it, but I don't even want to think about it because then Lost will be over just like that. *sobs*

This is totally the most I've written on LJ in forever.  Hooray :D"

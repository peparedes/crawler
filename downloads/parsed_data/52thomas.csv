"event","And then it can be said that I have been posted to yet another camp! Currently, it seems like I am about to spend the next of my remaining 1 and a half years in SAFTMI camp which is at boon lay. Could be better or it could have been far worse. All I want to say is I cant stand dusty musty rooms that trigger my lifelong allergic reaction to DUST. I hate that wretched thing as it collects in all dark and dirty places, scattering itself all over the floor and in unwanted corridors. They lurk in the cupboards, and underneath objects and when the wind blows, these wretched specks seem to gravitate towards my nose, my beloved schnozzola, my smeller my sniffer my sinus stricken sneezer. An affliction I have to live with I guess. I am not perfect! And apart from the dreaded dust, dead bees, cockroach body parts and mould and weird brown fungi. This is a housekeeper's nightmare. And also the place I will have to sleep in for the next of the 3 weeks to come. Wish me luck on my OJT. Being a medic's such a chore. There are so many details you have to remember. I'm like the freaking nurse of the army. I shall leave this to be the end of my nonsensical post. WOOHOO BOOYA!"

"event","So long since my last post. I think I can barely remember how to write properly. My command of the language has been shattered. Is that even an appropriate adjective. I can barely remember any good word to use. So has become of my vocabulary. I finally understand that if you don't speak good english, you will never be able to write good english. And why does writing this feel word. Incoherent, disjointed words strung together like pearls that dont belong together in the same necklace. Such a horrid, ugly worthless necklace. Yes, thats precisely how I would describe my writing - A piece of chinky second grade jewellery. Is that even how you spell jewellery. 

I shall now start another paragraph, another stanza, in an attempt to revive a coherence from a time forgot. The last post dates back from February. That means a fair 5 months have passed since I last wrote on this piece of the web. There are many reasons why I do not fancy writing, namely 2. Firstly, I do not have a nice and pretty layout. Secondly, I do not have nice and pretty things to write about. All I have are bad memories that I would pay someone to get rid of. Maybe not all the memories, especially the special ones with a certain random boghog. So, lets see, what happened to me. Firstly, I signed away 2 years of my life by enlisting in the army. The main event of my life from then on involved dreadful sunday nights when I had to go back in, and happy friday nights when I could get out of that dreadful place. And in between, waking up at 5 and being dressed in green. Just before I enlisted, I received my dreadful A level scores. Such dismal grades could not let me lay claim to a fate I once dreamed of - To be a doctor. Such is the fate of a now confused boy, thinking about alternative career options. Well I hope by the time the 2 years is up I would have come up with something good. Mostly people just end up doing something that they regret doing, I hope that doesnt become of me. 

And so, presently in my stint at military medicine, it consists mainly boring lectures in lovely air-conditioned halls with dim lighting (the perfect ambience for a snooze), wrapping people up in smelly cloths and poking people with oversized needles. I can say the people there are a friendly bunch of nice people, which I am thankful to have around. And I should say the food is much better than the last place. So it seems life seems to be improving. As the cloud of dreariness casts its shadow upon my pimpled face, I frown upon a fate that I see unravel. A fate far less than that of a yesteryear. I have to learn not to just plainly accept it but to think of a plan to change it for the better. 

It seems like my old habit of writing in gibberish is coming back. I'm not feeling myself lately. Who am I? I wonder. I guese that is a question for another time."

"event","And so, in a second, there he goes again. Malaysia is a very bad place to live in, especially if you frequent a popular shopping spot in Johor Bahru, that is the city of the State Johore. A nasty place to be in, very often you have to watch your back, because you never know whos going to pop up behind you. The cases of petty theft and robbery have skyrocketed within the past few years. I have many a friend who has fallen victim to these treacherous fools. Never would I have thought wary me would one day join them. Yes I have become prey. I shall now relate to you the series of events that have led to the disappearance of my beloved motoE398. You may choose not to read on, as these devasting chain of misfortunes might prove too much to take, and your mood might grow foul. Yes, they should be hanged. These phone-stealing scum. 

Living both in Malaysia and Singapore, it is very convenient to have 2 handphones/cellphones to carry around. One being a singaporean line, and the other of course malaysian. I was holding this phone in my hand reading an sms kimberly sent to me, and attempting to reply to it whilst navigating across the streets. Terrible drivers, they speed like hell, and stop at nothing. The only safe route will be high up on the overhead. As I was walking on the splishy-splashy puddle-strewn floor, CNY cookies in one hand, and phone in another, I strutted unknowningly into the territory of the phone-stealing scums. Many a time I wonder, there are just too many people in the bus stop, who do not seem to get up buses. Its them! Eyeing my phone, which was comfortable saddled in the safety of my pocket. Then, 39 came. I went up the bus and took out my wallet to pay the fare (RM1), and my pants were tight! I had to remove my phone, and put it somewhere else. In a fleeting moment, little did I know that was the last time I would ever feel the nice black smooth surface of my dear phone. I placed it there and paid the fare. Behind me, the shadow of a person who too, came up the bus, but then made his way back into the crowd. That was where he disappeared, with my phone. Alas, when I came upon the realisation. It was too late, all too late."

"event","And so, 52thomas has created a space he calls his own(which is actually not) again. Eventful, and more often, uneventful thoughts both random and hallucinated will be best written rather than forgot. So once again a certain beginning commences, with it, it brings a happy and hopeful start that a new chapter will be made."

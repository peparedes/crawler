"event","so, this weekend jim was going to come up, but im a dumb cooter and decided it would be better if i just study.  hm, yeah.  he's coming next weekend though, and bringing my vegan vitamins. <3<3 this boy, i swear..... he makes me incredibly happy.

so ashley and i have been sitting in our room the whole day sleeping, watching sabrina the teenage witch, full house, family matters, and step by step.  oh, we ate too.

there is a full mix drink next to me right now.  is it wrong that im tempted to drink it?  its 3:30 in the afternoon. 

roomie and i have been stuck in the ninties all week.  yesterday i was sick.  we downloaded hundreds of old ninties songs.  then suddenly i just decided i wasnt going to feel like shit anymore and started dancing.  i was the only one dancing. i danced for about three hours.  then we drank.

woo!"

"event","interresting day i guess.
<br>
woke up at 4am to write two 2 page essays that were due at 930am.  yeah, i should probably major in procrastination.  it's not like i dont do my work though.  it always gets done and it gets done well.  i just work better when i know i have to get it done, otherwise i just get distracted.
<br>
<br>
almost got to hang out with a drunk karl tonite, but he passed out on me.
<br>
<br>
rearranged some shit in my room.
<br>
<br>
came home this morning after class to a room mate who wont talk to me for unknown reasons.  perhaps personal issues? but im honestly done trying to pick it apart.  im done asking ""whats wrong"" every time she wont talk to me, when usually its about some guy.. dude!! dont take your shit out on me! its fucking annoying and makes me feel awkward in my own room.
<br>
<br>
escaped to victorias, and had a much needed discussion.
<br>
im sick of being this way.
<br>
im sick of waking up the same way every day, then giving up.
<br>
i cant keep doing this to myself.
<br>
i need control, thats the only thing i need right now, other than support.
<br>
i was really about to give up and give in before tonite.
<br>
we'll see what tomorrow brings.
<br>
<br>
goodnight."

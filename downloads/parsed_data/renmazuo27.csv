"event","I bet that none of you ever thought this would happen.... that'd I'd be happily content for the rest of my life being a car freak, gaming nut and fishing enthusiast with no way to finance it... WRONG!!! I started working at at my dad's company today. Was a little hectic getting used to the place, least I knew some of the people there. Spent the whole day packing some software package. Wasn't too bad as it was a nice simple job...cept when you do it for 10 hours- fatigue starts to set in. I work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week plus 2 hours overtime (which I had today)- obviously depending if they are busy and need people cause I'm only a casual worker. When I get used to the run of the mill, I'll get transferred over to where me dad works. Thank god... now I don't have to loan off people. 

The best thing about working there (aside from the pay) is the girls...haa-geez!!! the filipino girls...all around my age. But I gotta focus on the job first... don't wanna get fired and I'm not really a closet person anyway.... They're all nice though.. 

Disadvantages....none really, cept I can't sit on my arse and do the aformentioned all-day Ps2 session. The disadvantage to the rest of the world is soon I can finance my Wangan activities, may it be at Timezone or on the freeway. Plan of attack, first the 32Skyline- drive that for a few years then get the Supra...but I'm getting ahead of myself.

Ain't gonna write much tonight....it's sitting on my arse doing fuck all time.. I've been hard at work today (and that ain't a lie either!)

"event","A recent 80's or 90's rock song I came across somewhat gave the 'fighting spirit' in me the proverbial kick in the pants. As a result of such I feel somewhat better than I did a week or two weeks ago. I've got a little more spring in my step, more of the aggression that I'm used to having. Brain is still burnt out though- needing a holiday bad. Academically, things are still scraping the bottom of the barrel. Definitely taking the next semester off, just to refreshen the mind, work with dad and finish the unfinished. Exams are coming up soon, not feeling good about them but not panicking yet.

On another topic, the model cars I spoke about several months ago aren't sitting in some corner gathering dust. The Skyline R32 is waiting for the rims which I'll hopefully get relatively soon. The Supra has been well modified. I'm finishing up the engine work....most of it is just drying, just the intercooler piping and exhaust outlet to go. Bodywise, just the rear spoiler and the little diffuser left to go..still waiting for rims on that car also.

Did a little questionnaire... Apparently I'm Keisuke Takehashi from Initial D- To be honest, I do feel like him at the moment

"event","yes, I backflipped into depression again. Hate uni, hate computer science, hate my parents, hate myself, hate everything in this life of mine. I just can't figure out what I want to do. Sick of studying, just wanna work but you need a degree or certificate or some fucken piece of paper to say you're qualified to get a job and to get that miserable piece of paper you need to study....fuck it!!!

Don't know what to do in this life. I'm as lost as ever, seems like everyone else knows where they're going and I'm always the one left standing there. Parents are getting on my back how I'm wasting time, they don't want me to take a year off and think about it....they reckon i'm wasting more time if I do that. How can you guys do this...keep studying and working hard? I can't see any logic to it and it drives me insane. 

I don't want to get left behind, but somehow I always do...No matter how hard I try I always fail something or find it almost impossible... and I can't catch up, it's as if life is like a receding door. I can't find anything that brings me happiness anymore.

Somebody stop this, end it now for god sake!

"event","Well, as a result of playing Gran Turismo 4 on the PS2. I've finally got myself into groove and into gear. (Who ever said video games was bad for you- well you suck!)So yeah, in other words I've shaken the academic dust off and is once again willing to tackle stuff head on. So tomorrow I'll hit the books and send them flying. Got an assignment due in next friday and I feel I get it done and looking forward to studying too...- all because of this song; Kasabian - Reason is Treason (JackNife Lee Remix). It's just got all my cells bouncin around.

I is no longer feeling that lost or isolated or negative for that matter. Bring it on world!!! As a result, my cousin and I tried to re-enact a fight scene from Jet Li's movie Unleashed. It takes place in a standard home toilet. The result of our one was similar...a few dents and cracks in the wall which I had to plaster and paint over. Got headbutted in the shoulder while I socked my cousin in the hip. Was fun though...cept my shoulder died on me and my cousin can't walk more than 50 meters.

So in closing...thank you Kasabian, thank you PS2 and thank you Gran Turismo 4.

Ps. susie, I feel pretty stoked for you. Hope your teaching prac goes well with the kids..sounds like you're doing well anyway. Good luck.

"event","For some of you, this is gonna come as a surprise. For once I chose a more sensible and civilised method of getting rid of my girl troubles. This came in the form of badminton last Saturday morning. The usual guys were involved, me Al and Kristian headed off to Herb Graham Centre. It wasn't only me who needed de-stressing. Kristian had a thing for Louisa- The older sister of Justine (whom I was ranting and raving on about in my last entry) who also said she has a boyfriend now (after both of them messed with our hearts and our heads) so he was none too chuffed about it as well. 

It was fun. I'd built up a lot of emotion and a little bit of anger (at myself) so I was putting up a lot of effort into my game. Aerial smashes were my primary avenue of venting it all out. But it was mainly just to chill- brought the camera along so there were some shots of some rallies between us- an aerial smash of me (which I gotta say looked pretty cool), some pics of Al and Kristian with his deformed raquet- which he somehow did throughout the game.However I think I did too many aerial smashes in the bid to make myself content, now I have a sore lower back and right arm...hrmm

Monday I met up with Chan and Al again at the city- this time all of us needed a lil more de-stressing (with Al becoming single again overnight)- so i was off to timezone for some multiple Maximum Tune 2 fun. Imagine seeing two R34 skylines trying to block a Supra on the Wangan freeway. Awe inspiring the sight, but actually trying to do it ingame was a nightmare- Chan kept blocking my path till I eventually got the better of him (and Al) on one of the corners- only to have him slam me into the back of a truck...twice!!! I won the first run and was on course for a 2 nil sweep till I saw the black nose of chan's Vspec II edge out in front- just meters away from the finish line..so the 2nd round went to him. (Shoulda rammed him into the wall)- finally got some footage of me playing...quality was shit but i'm determined to make it better...

"event","It's been 3 years since my life went into a nosedive into hell and from that point I've been the person you guys always knew me as. The assault rifle toting 2nd Lieutenant, the driver who can become one with his car late at night on the freeways, the pool nut who used to wag some of his classes to play pool and the arcade freak that spends all his time and energy at Timezone. But in the three years that I have grown to accept and enjoy being single, it has finally hit the rocks...It all started Saturday night at the party...(Al was there, he would remember)- she was there too but I couldn't say anything. So I carried on being my usual self- playing dodge ball and cricket (as Al mentioned, all done with newspaper) so all in all the party was good. Cept I had to make a serious effort not to take a glance at her.

Slept over Chan's house that night. Chan, myself, Al, Danny, Ian and Jarryd all sang karaoke till 5 in the morning where we all fell asleep on the living room floor. This would probably be the only time in my life where i would regret sleeping in my singlet and shorts. Because at 9 or 10 am, Justine and her friends rocked up. I awoke to her and her friends all sitting on the couches in the living room..first thing I saw was Justine's face.

Now I'm home though....and I've seen her pic on hi5, it's declared war on my emotions. One side wants to get the heart involved while the other is against the idea. It's tearing me apart- everything I do is reminding me of her. Cars guns and games were all thrown out of my head and if you know me, that's pretty damn serious- If you're saying to yourself, what's wrong with the situation...she's 5/6 years younger than me. At first the feeling was one sided (coming from her) but it's spread like a disease and I'm caught in the crossfire. Last night I snapped... while I was watching the movie Heat.. I quote...

""I got three dead people on the street Justine, I'm sorry if the goddamm chicken....got overcooked"" - Al Pacino

The result was a pizza slice being thrown at the TV. It's never happened to me before, feeling like this for a girl. I don't know what to do..except maybe pray and hope that it'll turn out alright...watch over me peoples, I need help on this one, (You got any suggestions, I'm all ears)

Ps. Shieet- that's a huge entry!

"event","Well recently I've been finding myself singing at various Phil Collins songs and somehow feeling a little lonely and wishing I did have that someone special. So yeah, vocal chords have been getting a decent workout. Stayed at a mates house during the weekend so he could give me a hand in an assessed piece of work that's due on wed. Ending up going to the Filipino Australian Sports Association foundation event. Mainly just played basketball, hung around with a few families that i knew and had a small dosage of vodka. Had a small incident involving a fire extinguisher and a jackass of a filipino (thought it was me mucking around with the thing...but how would that happen if I was the one who got hit by the cloud. Woulda sworn at him some more if he didn't make a hasty retreat.)

Got back to Kristian or rather Chan's house and sang karaoke with Chan and Ian at 2-4am in the morning while everybody else was asleep. So it was a pretty good chill out session, got the work done and got to have some fun too. Chan and I have made a schedule to make regular Maximum Tune meets on mondays.

Al get's back from the Eastern States tonight...my other bro...

So now I'm at home recovering... and singing Phil Collins - Everyday

I got lost
couldn't find my way
And i guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind
make you act so
strange
But I'm here
and here I will stay.

So everyday I cry
Yes everyday I fall
D'you ever wonder why
Why I love everything about you.

But everyday I say
I'll try to make my heart be still
'til then everyday there is to cry
Ourselves to sleep
we will.

It picked me up
knocked off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you
love you
love you but this fire
inside
Will never see the light of day.

So everyday goes by
And everday I fall

It makes me wonder why
my life's worth
nothing without you.
But everyday I say
I'll try to make my heart be still
'Cos every way there is to cry
ourselves to sleep

we will.
You'll never know
no
no
no
no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know
no
no
no
no
You'll never know
no you'll never see.

The book closes an we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel
how life goes on
And that seems so strange.

And so the light fades away
Try
try
try as I may
I can't stop thinking about you it seems my
life's worth
Nothing without you


Everyday
everyday
you know I try so hard
Everyday
everyday
ooh it gets a little harder.

"event","Yes, as the title of this journal entry explains. I have been MIA (Missing in Action) for quite some time now. So where have I been, what have I done? Here's the lowdown. Mostly it's just been sitting around at home, doing the regular house keeping chores of uni work. Sitting on my arse and playing PS2 when there isn't any work to be done or if not that I've been watching Twins Effect 1 and 2. Dad's taken last week and the coming week off so getting to and from uni is a lot less cumbersome. Haven't been getting my regular intake of fishing- which means I'll have to make up for it pretty soon. The only fish I've interacted with is the one Silver Bream at Cicerello's in Freo. (if u can call that interaction).

Today I was at Stuart's house where he helped me get started on the front bumper of the Toyota Supra (Yes I finally got one) for the diorama. I'm itching to get cracking on the diorama and models again but as usual I'm still waiting for those rims and I'm lacking certain materials (Green Stuff ie, putty like stuff for building) for any progress to be made. But she's looking fucking awesome...

Was gonna to Autosalon tomorrow but I don't know how much it costs so that's another one of my plans scrapped.

Btw. ""How you doing everyone? How's things going? Hope to catch up with you guys soon so keep me posted if there are any happenings""

"event","I is back from my little holiday away from home. Actually it got extended by 2 days since my Aunt let me stay over for a little longer. So in my time at Kristian's house we spent plenty of times playing PS2, naturally with Alastair making regular appearances. Went with Kristian and his family to play volleyball at Altone park with a host of other filipinos. While we were there, played several bouts of basketball (with Kristian getting most of his shots from the 3 point line, though I did find some form on the court) and ended up watching Kristian kick ass in his match. But after a couple of rounds of volleyball my arm was rendered useless during that night. Everyone from volleyball that day turned up that night at Kristian's house, so there was a lot of people there. Had a beer and some vodka but nothing substantial to get me under the influence.

Went to Morley Rec a few times to play badminton. Course there were some wacky moments there. Maximum Tune 2 was played regularly at Leisure Island also. The rest of the time was scattered between the city, going to bed at 4am, waking up at 12, watching some chinese movies which resulted in a small debate of which girl was better (this is what happens when two single male friends watch a movie with good looking chicks in it-Charlene Choi rocks!!)and generally just lounging around the house.

Yesterday I went fishing with B Brim (or Frapple) at Mindarie and what a haul it was. Frapple opened up the accounts by catching 6 herring, a smail tailor that went back into the drink and the catch of the day.... a 50cm Soapie Mulloway. Took a while before we got it ito the bucket and as for myself (S Brim), I contributed with a stack of decent sized Silver Bream. Most would go back but two were big enough to be chucked in the ice slurry, to be given later to my hosts.

And so that was my 6 days of vacation. Pretty good but it's almost time to get back into the uni shit. Though I will have one last hurrah...

"event","What a bastard. I got my results back yesterday. I failed one unit, but passed the other two. It is a bit of a bastard to go back and do it again- cept this time its enough inspiration for me to actually sit down and do the work (I kept wagging the lectures *Yeah I know its my fault*), so I can kick its arse in the exam. Apart from that the outcome was expected- I had a feeling I'd fail this one, anything with Math in it drastically reduces my chances of passing.

I embark on another sleep-over. For a few days I get a well deserved break from the confines of my house (and my parents) for several days of mucking around-solid gaming, badminton, reckless spending and general guy behaviour. 

The model building- It's making nice progress, I need the bloody rims though. Can't believe no-one stocks them. So i'm thinking about getting a fill-in project. One I can do while I wait for the rims. Though I'll probably choose another car that needs rims as well *slaps head*.

Anyway I think that's enough of an update, I'm off to kill some terrorists again. Oh yeah- my new favourite movie is ""Heat"". Gotta love Al Pacino in that, cause he's a bastard.

Shopping was the main order- my aunt needed to get some supplies and a few bits and pieces (things are cheaper here than in Karratha)On the other hand- RJ and I (literally my younger brother) spent some cash at Timezone and yes, he does play Maximum Tune as well. Amazes me what a young kid like him can do. A few other people; Gerald (another one of my family friends) tagged along with us- got him started on Maximum Tune as well (drives a Subaru), he's a juvenile driver too cept RJ and I are the ""Wanted Wangan Brothers"" (ask for pic) a friend of Janelle's (RJ's older sis) joined the group, (You remember Cindy don't you Stalin)- Anyway she was a bit of a pain but that's Year 9 teenage girls for you.

Along the way, we got a barbecue. Actually Rj's family plus another filipino family that we're friends with bought it for us. They're great people anyway... RJ and I slept in the entertainment room. Funny cause we slept real late playing PS2 all night. We had some fun moments. Janelle and Cindy slept in my room- Christ! looked more messy when they were in there than when I'm sleeping in there. I'm actually pretty tidy if you can believe that.

Tomorrow my cousin's girlfriend from Spain flies in. Another visitor but I assure you- NO ONE'S TAKING MY BEDROOM- I HAVE SLEEP TO CATCH!!!

Wasn't too bad, wasn't the nut buster I'd would've thought it would be but still tricky enough to make you think about it (shakes fist at DFD question). So after that I went and celebrated. Not at the pub cause it was closed, but where else would I go? Timezone of course!!! Spent a while there and some dollars, still good practise for the real thing- which I can do at will now *hehe*. Another bit of good news is that model kit from Sydney came in the mail today. Well actually it came yesterday but mum thought it'd be a smart idea to keep it from my knowledge. Can't do anything yet until I get the rims from Japan (my friend goes back at the end of june...*sigh*).

Tomorrow I plan to meet up with Kristian (get some Maximum Tune Vids taken) then stop by good old chisholm ""How ya doing Mrs McCrory, I just came to pick up my lecture notes""- then off to the city to meet Al and play some badminton. Hopefully aftre that we'll meet up with Shaun, Kazuki and Laurent to play some pool at Orbit- then go to either Al's or Kristian's house until my dad picks me up. Reason for that is we got family friends flying in from Karratha tomorrow night and we gotta pick them up from the airport-(I get kicked out of my room for 4 days...dammit!).

"event","Saw Star Wars Episode 3 yesterday, twice to be exact. Dad and I went in the morning then at around 5 in the afternoon, my cousin Neil asked if I wanted go. So I did. I won't say much in terms of the story....don't wanna spoil it for those who haven't seen it. But the lightsabre fights are more intense this time round. 

Was thinking about doing a Star Wars Saga marathon yesterday. Watch Episodes 1 and 2- then go to the movies to watch 3- come home and watch 4, 5 and 6. Cept it couldn't be done. I have a feeling I'll be seeing it a third time cause I have family friends coming from Karratha on Friday week. Least I'll have an opportunity to do the marathon then (all in one day mind you). I wonder if it's even humanly possible- I want a lightsabre too now.....

"event","Hahahahaha!!! For those who think I had addiction problems to Maximum Tune, it gets worse..or better (in my case anyway). Maximum Tune 2 is out!!!! *Commme Onn!!!* Played for the first time today, still a little clumsy shifting with my left hand but with a few hours of practice, I'll be back to to reclaim my title as ""The Red Master""- Soundtrack wise it didn't have the *Ootts Ootts*(Bass) of the first Maximum Tune but had it a few more game modes- Definitely gonna come back for that one, cept they kicked out the original Maximum Tune at Timezone in Northbride... meaning I can't do my $8 = 30 mins unlimited Wangan sessions.... *cries*. I will find that machine where I can do my sessions or maybe it's to stop me from playing so much. I have the soundtrack to Maximum Tune 2 as well, came with the soundtrack to the first *raises eyebrow*

Ma's party was orright. Had a few drinks...again people stealing our alcohol- Bring yer own fucking drinks!!! It even said on her invite. Next time Al and I are bringing our own esky with a padlock. Found out her bro (Christian) was a revhead, so I spent some time with him talking about cars and watching a few video clips. Quite fun really....he gave me a few mags that he had multiple copies of- thanks mate. Shame we couldn't use ma's pool table, would've been fun though.

During the party, my pool companion, Courtney, rang me up and asked if I wanted to crash at her place with some friends. Since her parents were out of town I went for it though I literally did crash at her place, 30 mins after I got there I passed out on the couch...sheer fatigue. Woke up to my phone ringing- was dad, saying he was on his way to pick me up. So from there I went fishing with dad. Caught nothing that day but we saw a shitload of decent to big sized bream under the jetty at Jojo's restaurant. Wouldn't take the the lures, then we found out they tend to hit them at sunrise or sunset so Dad and I are already making plans... We gotta christen the new fishing hardware properly.

Got a talk that's supposedly due in tomorrow to do but I can't be fucked, plus I'm still recuperating form the last assignments we did. I'm on the verge of saying, ""Nuh! not gonna do it.""

"event","This is one of those days that I ask myself what the fuck am I doing. This has got to be the most stressful week of uni I've had, I have a 3000 word report due in on tuesday, a group assignment on wednesday that we've only done half of the work- still gotta do those bloody Data Flow Diagrams that one of my guys was supposed to have done a week a go and it gets worse, they have to be done on the computer which takes at least 3 hours! In essence, we are FUBAR (Fucked-Up-Beyond-All-Recognition) All of this boils down to me being Team Leader. This is the one time I've hated being team leader, for the cadets- fine I'll do it but anything for Uni, no way!!! I never wanted the job, cept I was forced to ""sit there and shut up,"" literally when I had the chance to back out.

I'm seriously evaluating about continuing Uni at all. I'm ready to throw in the towl and live a regular life as a technician or a mechanic- when it comes to theory my brain just gives up and repeating the unit will equal a very very very depressed me and another grand wasted in education. The more I sit there, the more I dread uni. I think I've lost the passion to expand my knowledge- At the moment I don't know what I am or what I want to be, I feel really lost in this world. All that makes me what I am is my passion for cars and fishing and even those require some sort of degree to get to somewhere significant.

Tomorrow is another day of shit- I have to turn up at uni on a saturday to get those Data flow diagrams done and whatever else we can. I've lost sleep on the matter and my brain hasn't felt at ease at all lately. Why did I chose this path and why is my life always in shambles....a life of pain and suffering.

"event","I got done this week. Got myself a new rod, reel and lure. The rod cost me $50, the reel $80 and the lure was a fiver. $135 in three days, boom...gone.   Though I ain't complaining cause I love my new reel and rod. Now you may ask yourself why I'm so enthusiastic about my new rod and reel. Firstly the rod is a corky or a cork handle that's specially designed for flicking around light lures when you're on the hunt for Black Bream. The reel is just a much more advanced version of my other one cept it's a lot smoother to cast and the drag is a lot better to use. I've been itching to get the reel and the rod's have been on laybuy for 2 months already. Dad even got himself a similar outfit to mine, only his is smaller cause he's reel is smaller. Now I'm just waiting for a chance to put the whole outfit into action, a bit of nice weather on the river and once I get rid of this cold then Dad and I will go hunting again. I feel like I've unleashed another beast in me...

Last night was interesting. One of my neighbours was having a party that was meant for 16 people but somehow over 200 people rocked up. Things did get a bit rowdy so that's when my a couple of my neighbours rang the cops. The boys in blue did turn up and disperesed the crowd. Though the problem was later in the night when the last few guests were leaving. A couple of them tried to uproot dad's pencil pines out the front yard. One guy succeeded but the other didn't- probably stopped by the sharp wires dad put at the base. I was asleep at this point but Dad marched out fuming, armed with a reasonably big stick. I was as getting ready to hit the sack when mum came in and told me. Still I woulda liked to given them a pounding...But dad and I will be ready next year- cause I'm getting Al and Neil and we're gonna hold the line next year..hoo-yah!

But for now, more trance chilling..

"event","Anzac weekend was ok. Went to Moore river on Sunday with the whole family. Course what's a trip to Moore river without fishing. Tried walking the flats and casting lures but that wasn't productive. Camped out with dad on a small pile of rocks past the boat ramp though we were only rewarded with a few tiddlers. Had some decent bites but nothing to show for it. Ended up showing a group of kids how to fish, I hooked a small bream and gave it to one of the kids that was there. Had a ball seeing them muck around with small fish.

On the saturday dad and I went to the swan. Started off at East Perth in front of the hill everyone was sliding on at Christina's party and walked towards the WACA. Caugh a small Silver Bream there, which surprised me. A few meters down river I caught a 20cm yellow-tail grunter or Fingermark Bream (FM Brim). (The ones we kept catching at Garret Road Bridge and gave to that guy for bait, Al) I've seen plenty of small ones but never one as big as 20cm. Then it was off to Jojo's restaurant for a try there. Scored another S Brim there but dad scored the only B Brim on a soft plastic prawn. Bastard, he always manages to upstage me somehow. 

That night I went to cadets- at this point I was feeling a little worn out but I had to go cause of the rookies, they're still too green at this point. Ended up almost fainting and was hauled into sickbay where the practising nurses had fun babying me. Turns out I have a cold so all I can do is sit on my ass at home. Did a Metal Gear Solid marathon- finished Metal Gear 2 and 3 within two days. Uni-wise I'm 5 weeks behind in terms of notes but for assignments, still on time- I'll get around to it soon, either when I get better or when I start shitting myself. 

Just saying hi to everyone... and I hope I'll see you all soon. For now 'm off to watch McClane and going to have a shave...that high school chick will be back on the bus tomorrow- How I love the bus ride to uni in the mornings.

Btw- I got the Wangan Maximum Tune Original Soundtrack..mwahahaha!

So it was left to me meeting up with Phil, Rachel and Elyse. We window-shopped a bit, bought mum's b'day/mother's day present for tomorrow. After that met up with Kazuki and Shaun and spent 2 hours playing pool. It was fun to chill and muck around with some mates after getting rid of some assignments- Sik! Timezone was next on the menu, we went for a half hour super session. Kazuki want's to be part of the Maximum Tune meet, awesome another dude in the team.

After that I went fishing with dad. Funny thing was I was nowhere near the water but somehow still got drenched. Reason for that was dad was getting the water to put in the bucket when he slipped on the rocks, the bucket went airborne and I found myself looking into a tsunami. Then we found the rain coming down on us, still we hung around until we caught some nice Silver Bream then we made a run for the car.

So all in all that was my day. Still single but not really complaining, though I was in love in the city today and I got the title of ""The Red Master"" in Maximum Tune *Cooommee Onnn!* It was good and I'm hoping to have a city chill out session once again.

I got three assignments to hand in next week but with the way i'm going, I think i'll be alright. Still go to the tavern once in a while to practice my pool skills. I got beaten 6 games in a row by my friend Kristian- and I one once by default (he sank the black ball by accident) so that was humiliating. I ain't playing pool with him no more. The bus ride going to uni in the mornings is good though...hehe. 

Last time I went out was last saturday. Supposed to meet up and play LAN with Kristian, Johnno and some other guys. Only johnno bailed out on us leaving Kristian and I stranded in the city (Al wanted to come but he was working and he had a date...*hrmm*). So what happens when you leave two video game enthusiasts alone in the city? Well we had lunch first, then we went to timezone...spent 24 bucks cause we went on three half hour unlimited sessions. Kristian converted over to Maximum Tune as well- though his tuning and driving styles are rather unorthodox.... That's three in my team now, Carlo from uni (possibly be four cause I've heard Carlo's lil bro is a bit of a Maximum Tune otaku, Kristian and myself (I plan to convert Alastair soon...)

Stalin's party was good. Caught up with an old primary school friend...she's changed heaps. Nice to catch up to everyone cept not everyone was there. Went on a long walk to find alcohol...only one bottle shop was closed so we had to walk all the way to the mirrabooka one. Sad...cause we coulda drivin there *throws hands up in disgust.* But it was fun....watching ben (not our ben) stumble around totally trashed and listening to his vocab made my night.

I wanna catch up with everyone again. So next sat (not tomorrow- got the assignments) I'm gonna be in the city to muck around and spend some more money aimlessly- if you would like to catch up let me know, I fully expect everyone to turn up. I'll give most of you a ring if i don't talk to you about it on msn. Solid!!!

"event","There's only one thing that can really mess up my mindset. Girls. Not even a solid run on the Wangan can clear that up. So I figured it was time for me to go back to my roots. It's been a year since I've gone regularly at cadets. So it was quite pleasing to see good old Bravo Team. All the guys that were there when I went on a break were still there, plus a few new rookies that the provisionary Lieutenant had decided were good enough for my team. It felt good to be 2nd Lieutenant again. Back in the Olive Drab Greens it reminded me of what I joined up for in the first place. To celebrate my return from the wilderness the whole Seal Team 10 airsoft unit had a big piss up in the canteen. Leon was there, he's always been there- Still Team Leader of Alpha Team. These guys are like brothers to me- I've gone through some of the toughest times in my life with these boys and they've been there every step of the way. Not to mention Al, he's been there too but he's not in Seal Team 10.

A few new faces at turned up in the girls camp. Nothing interesting though- I was happy with my boys and I was keen to lead them again. Back out into the bush during the freezing winters, the boiling summers, in the rain, storm or hail. With no food or sleep for days on end. As you would expect, I was a little rusty but I will be back. NO matter how dangerous it is, 'I shall return!!'

Yesterday at the city was good- played countless games of pool. Went with Al, Stalin and Ros- met up with Laurent and Shaun as well so it was quite a happy bunch. I gave them quite a scare with my newly refined pool techniques but I find that I couldn't finish the game off when I could've. So it's back to the good old bar at uni for more practise. Marci and Shannon decided to drop by as well-spent the next half hour kicking myself in the head for missing every easy shot and poor shooting. She still looks great- caused a great tidal wave of memories so that was the reason for returning to cadets. Still it was great to see them and I had fun yesterday.

He always looks after me and my other filipino friend and introduces me to girls as well. I know where I'm having my 19th now!!! Asked me to burn some trance music for him so he can play it at the bar. He loved it and now he's asking me to burn some more- only I got one blank disc left. Its cool to hear your music being played in the bar while you have a few games of pool (which by the way I've improved greatly on) In exchange he leant me one of his cds. It's got the sickest, solidest trance song I've heard in a while. Most definitely worth listening to on the Wangan. Because of it I've developed the ""Renmazuo CTM or TCM""  (Chill to Trance Method or Trance Chilling Method; whichever you prefer )- which consists of me having my feet on the study table, sipping on frozen coke while doing the 'rapper' thing with the hand to the beat of this awesome trance song. Not only is trance good to drive to but it's awesome to chill to as well!!! Just when I thought RnB was growing on me...Solar Stone comes along and says ""Fuck off Nelly and Mario!"" hehehe...

Otherwise, life has been good. No problems at home- uni has been solid and the work is on time. Relationship wise, things are on the up. I've met a girl and we're going to go out soon- as friends of course but it looks good. We get a long really well. Now I just need a job and a car and I'm sorted... Next week is gonna be good. Looking forward to the week off.

By the way, PJ is having his b'day at the bar next week and he wants people to come. Let me know if you would like to come. It'll be great, I'll certainly be down there!!!

In the first few mins of entering my house- he shits on one of mum's new rugs and makes a mess out of the food container in his bed. On the ride in he spilt the biscuit container in the back of Neil's car and as a result, Neil had to clean out the back of the car before he left for uni.

Caesar's a real playful little thing. Loves to nibble at everything- Put a hole in my new corduroy shorts and almost punctured the back of my leg. Still I love the little guy. I look after him every friday when no one's home at Neil's place.....just spent a few mins cleaning up his shit- hard to do when you've got him pulling on your shorts. I've got a plan on how to toilet train him- I'll keep you posted on how that goes. I figure I might as well learn now so when I get a dog, I'll know how to do it. We want a labrador too, but a peach one. They say that labradors love water and they like to retrieve things- wouldn't that be useful (he comes back with a massive silver bream from the waves...god!!!) So I'm looking forward to having a dog, despite the hardships. 

Neil suggest in me calling my dog Hector (yes, from Troy) so they'd be real good friends.....I like the idea.

I think it's the first time since year 12 that I can say I've been totally free- that I've left all the shit behind me. It feels great to be me and I love it.  I've forgotten about past lusts and objects of affection. I think I can survive for a while without a girlfriend...it's not a priority anymore. I mean if the opportunity should arise then why not but as long as I have this, I'm content.

Contrary to what people think, I don't do this because it's wrong or for the thrill of it. Seeing that black, endless road at night with only street lights for illumination with no cars, no traffic- nothing to hassle you, It's like another world that belongs to you, the never ending road. A world that's perfect compared to our one.

You won't understand what it's like to own that road. Only those that have done it themselves know what it feels. It's more like finding an inner peace in yourself and it really makes me smile. Leon understands why we do it, he's been there with me all along. He knows what it's like to be in that domain. Likewise with my friend (Boris), although I have to borrow his car but he sees why I do it.

No one can stop me doing this. It's where my home is, where I belong. The ""Driver's Delight"" can't be explained but one must experience it for themselves and see how awe inspiring it is to be on that black, endless road... I really do love this, because it's what I am and always will be.

Alissa's party was good, everyone had a bit of alcohol to liven things up. Shame how some people couldn't control themselves on it though. Had a few quick dips in the pool, I didn't want to get a cold like last time and no- I didn't put the dress on (Sorry peoples, I know you would've liked that but I didn't feel like being an idiot this time round). hehehe...

Taught Christina how to play pool on Alissa's mini pool table. That was fun- for once I found myself playing consistently well (certainly a lot better when I play elsewhere), even managed to accumulate a small pile of winnings(Not just against Sprite, mind you). That was most of the night for me, course I had a beer but nothing else. Like I said before, I wasn't in the mood of getting hammered. Chilling was what was on my agenda.

Sadly, something has to happen to really fuck things up. My badminton raquet went missing. As far as I know, I left it outside on Alissa's table. I'm pretty sure someone's just used and misplaced it somewhere. But if someone's bailed off with it- There's gonna be some bad blood stirred up cause I need that raquet next month when we start playing at Uni and if I find out that someone has knicked it, there will be hell to pay... Sure as hell it wasn't me cause I put it on the table after I finished with it and spent most of the night playing pool. Anyway, I hope it'll turn up.... I don't really wanna spend more money buying another badminton raquet.

He's filo too so we relate pretty well. The canteen lady is filipino as well. Christ! we're everywhere!!! There's a guy from Bahrain too and he seems like a nice guy, though I'm yet to learn his name. Pretty boring though, most of it was introduction to the unit and we got two assignments already. That really sucks!!!! If I get more tomorrow and/or Wednesday I'm gonna have a cry, really. Though they aren't due in till week 6 and 10, it's a bit of a pain to get an assignment on the first day.

Good thing about my schedule is that I get Monday and Friday's off. I have a morning class on Monday so I get home around 1. Tuesday I'm in the afternoon so dad will probably pick me up on his way home from work and Wednesday is the same as my Monday timetable. Applying for a job pretty soon, (reminds self to fill out application form) I need the money and I need something to keep my occupied. Oh, and it's my cousin's b'day today, gotta send him an email and I gotta do the dishes too and on top of that I need some sleep.

"event","Yeeeheeee!!!!! After being used for 4 long years, my old phone has finally retired. Mum finally relented yesterday and got me a new phone. Panasonic X70. It's a nice silver little phone- camera and flip flop design (Yes, I know it's called a flip phone but I've grown accustomed to calling it flip flop- and I don't mean thongs!!)Course the first thing you (well after you've put in on charge) is to customise it and of course, I put a Maximum Tune wallpaper on the screen. Hey, I can take pics of all the real 'big' fish I catch. Now I'm just trying to figure out how to change my ringtone. I'm no longer out of touch with technology, well mobile technology that is. More importantly, I will still be using my old number but I do have a new one(phone is on plan- gotta use it at least once a month to keep it from getting disconnected), I probably will send you guys an email to let you know or I'll just tell you on msn.

Today- well, 2nd hand book sale today. So I gotta go back to ECU again to get some books, well one anyway.I have to get one brand new, ahh dammit! Stupid new edition! That's another 98 bucks down the drain or something like that. Well I'm off.........Burnout 3 yet again. Plus mum wants Barbie girl on her phone (my old one). Oh god.......*rolls eyes*

"event","Had orientation day today. Christ- I've never seen so many asian people in my life. Was a little nerve racking, not knowing anyone but once I saw a few people I know, I became very relieved. It wasn't too bad, bit boring. Least I got free food though. (Hell yeah!!!! Fish and chips!)I liked the fact the with ECU, they have sports faculties that play against other uni's, and yes Badminton is available and a I will be going to that, no doubt about it. (If we end up playing UWA, you're gonna die Al!!!), they even host it up here in Joondalup!. Uni isn't so nerve racking at all, it's pretty relaxed. Even better is the that I only have to be there 3 times a week!!! Two days off is a god's blessing. Plenty of girls there today, and I was grinning most of the time. But still, had to keep my mind on the task (which was paying attention to the computing and IT talk). Still, definitely giving me something to look forward to.

I think i'm ready for uni. The trick is to take it in terms of semesters. If you start looking at the workload as a year, then you start to hate it. Fair enough that you gotta work your ass off, but hay- it's all for the good. But you can't work all the time, you'll die or go crazy. (I quote that from one of my lecturers)

Haven't made any progress on the Skyline Model kit, need bloody LED's for the headlights and I can't find any!!!! I wanna see it on the diorama already, goddamit!!!

Burnout 3 has made a comeback tour on the PS2. No where else can you drive a Formula 1 car on suburban streets, with NOS, take out the F1 racers and smash up your car. Quite fun actually. Might go play it now.....

"event","Fuck Valentines day!!!! The day doesn't even exist in my calendar, not to mention my vocabulary. It was only a regular Monday to me. Still though, it's not all too bad. Being a single guy, you can do whatever you want, without attachment!!! Didn't do much that day though, had a fucken virus on the comp. Eventually got the bastard fixed (kudos goes to Al for the help). Ended up going for a drive on the Monday evening, one word to describe it is 'Wangan' then you have an idea of what I did to chill. I sure did look on the bright side of single life on that one.

Now being Tuesday I should say something about today- Hot!!! Bloody stinking hot!!! well it's not so bad, we got AC (short for aircon). Mainly slept and ate today. Got access to parents bank account now, yeeheee!!! so I won't be such a poor bastard anymore. Gotta pay off some debts.....(dammit!!!)- still least it ain't that much that I'll have to cough up. Found out that I don't start uni till the 28th. My original thoughts were I'd be starting this coming week. So that was worth a Krakozhia or two....(Oh! Krakozhia!!!). Been having a hankering for Nestles Crunch- that's an awesome chocolate and thanks to Manuela, I have a new song to listen to: The Killers - Mr Brightside. Shoulda talked to her earlier, then I coulda listened to it in the car. Thanks Ma!!!

"event","Things have been pretty uneventful, well inside the norm that is. Still building the plastic kit. It's looking alright now, most parts have been painted with a few to go. Made custom intercooler and front bumper too and all that's left to fabricate is a custom exhaust. (Only the revheads will know what I'm taking about). So yeah, that has been keeping me occupied. Couldn't go to Shannon's party (sorry about that) cause I was busy, ended up going for a drive later that night though. Don't worry, no high speed runs. Just cruising around perth.

Al came over on Tues, played cricket at the nets, then mucked around with the r/c petrol powered car. It was being a bitch this time around, kept stalling so we have to tune it up again. After that we had a water fight for no reason. You know you have problems when you do that. Then we played basketball at the local school. Stayed up till 2:30 in the morning just mucking around on the net. 

Wed was pretty much the same story, hung around Lakeside shopping centre after we woke up at 11 (that was expected...), bought myself a new grip for the cricket bat cause it'd had split the day before. Then went and tried it out at the nets. We had to wait around before we got a chance cause there were these youngsters practising in the nets. They were about 10 or 12 but they were a lot better with the bat than us, really put us to shame. Played basketball once again then went home. PS2 passed time a bit then stayed on the net till 3am.

Woke up at noon (again....) then al went home after that. Spent most of the afternoon eating and sleeping (I sound like Jordan). Now I'm just downloading music and writing this.

"event","I now fully realise that girls have this funny power. I don't have much fear over the other stuff I've done in my life such as doing a 'wangan run' but talking to a girl whom I haven't seen since primary school was one of those moments when I had to sum up all of the courage I had in me. It didn't particularly help the fact that she'd gotten a lot prettier over the years but she was still really sweet. It's so shit!!! 2nd Lieutenant Bongcaras, me. I guess I'm pretty well respected at cadets for being a decent team leader and I have no hesitations about doing the mission. but when it comes to girls. I need all the help I can get.

She even confessed to me that she used to have a crush on me back in primary school, and now I've really started kicking myself. Why is it that girls can manipulate our feelings and emotions. Is it because they're so different from us males? Or is cause we're attraced by their sweet demure, gentleness and the way they laugh and smile. Obviously physical attraction is there but I've begun to see deeper than that and that's why I fell for Julie I guess... (it's not the Julie in Chisholm we all know) It really bugs me that when us guys try to make a stand against girls, we say we will but it's easier said than done. Cause even though how solid our defence for our emotions, girls can wear away at it or sneak in through another way into our heart.

I guess we're just human after all, no matter how much we try to hide from love.

I'm gonna go drown emotions playing Wangan Maximum Tune.

"event","Went out dinner with my cousin last night- had a man to man talk about things. Mainly this year ahead of me. Neil's a good guy, for a 20 yr old he's pretty damn mature but he look after the younger people....me. He knows the problems I've been having at home cause he's been there, fights with mum about uni and such. But he sat me down last night and laid it all out in front of me. He didn't dribble on about meaningless bullshit but it was the simple truth.

I know I'm not the smartest student but he told me that I can do it just as well, 'It's just a matter of choosing to do it'.It was one of those talks that snaps you back into the real world and now I realise I'm into the shit for real. It's all on me now........But the important thing he made me see was that they're is always people who are looking out for you. So to all of you out there...everyone in our group- I apologise for the way I've treated you this last year. I know you're all out there to help me and each other. So if I've had a go at you this last year- I truly am sorry. 

So I've finally found myself again. This year will be a busy one. But I'm up to the challenge, hell, I'm up for anything!! Neil told me i'm not a kid anymore, 'You're an adult Vernie,' and he's right- I'm a man now, and I think I've grown up these past few weeks more than I ever have. I was always talking about 'me needing to grow up,' it was always gonna happen soon and I think it's just happened.

So in closing I say- Bring it on world, no social life, mountains of study and work. Bring it on!! I'll get through this year and pass all my subjects no matter what.

Thanks Neil, owe you one bro........

"event","Soo much for having a good day today. Well it wasn't too bad, got the first kit for my diorama- a Nissan Skyline GTR R-32. Met with Al- and looked around town for a model kit that was in my budget. Town included Stanbridges in Mt Lawley- and they had crap all. Eventually settled on one that was a few dollars cheaper back in the city and I'm happy with it- now I need some putty, then the real work begins.

Met up with Amy and Olivia for a while, just to say hi then we buggered off. Went to Cybernet and played C&C Zero Hour. First time we tried, it was too hard- second time was better, cept we ran out of 'comp' time to finish the attack I started. Last thing Al saw was a whole line of tanks that he thought we're heading his way, 'Oh shit!!' but when i told him they were mine, smiles went all around. We never got to see a single shot fired from the second round but I think it's safe to say we would've won that. It was here that the chaos started, left Cybernet and Al and I went home...

Got on train and the security dude asked for my ticket....*pats pockets* ""uhhh... where's my wallet?"". Fortunately the guy let me off with a warning- cause that would started World War 3 here. Dad wouldn't have minded but mum's being all bitchy at the moment. Still the question of my wallet- I was pretty sure I'd left it in Cybernet and I tried to ring the place up but they weren't answering. I was getting worried at this point, all my wangan cards (all the money i've spent on those!!!) and my student age card. To lose my wangan cards was no big deal but my student age card- no alcohol, no strip clubs. Jesus!! thank god stalin told me that ben was in the area and he picked it up- yeah all the stuff was in there.
Now I just gotta pick it up tomorrow. I owe Stalin and Ben for that one.

My cousin comes back from his holiday tomorrow- all the stuff he bought me, yeeheee!! still he's a great mate. After we pick him up, Dad and I go buy some putty and go fishing but as far as mum knows, Dad and I have gone 'driving.'

"event","Soo much for a relaxing day on Aussie Day. I worked all morning and most of the afternoon on my uncle's reticulation system. Hard work- but better than playing PS2 all day (that's a new one for me). Still I got payed, which was good.

Aussie Day party was killer. Met a new girl at the party, Nicola- she was a nice one. Blonde and quite flirty if i should say so. She was, let's say- very up front about certain things, herself included. Didn't drink all that much to be honest cause I had more fun taking people on in Wangan Midnight- I'm still the undisputed champion. Soo many people there too, lots of girls and bikinis (a few smiles'll go up with that one). Music was pretty good- mainly party/beach/flirty music and the mood was great. Everyone passed out around midnight or 1- mainly cos alcohol ran out. 

I went to bed earlier cause I wanted to go fishing in the morning. How could I not- it was on the Mindarie Key shore front. So while everybody was snoring from a late night orgy (which what the party really was, heard some people got with each other)- I took the boat out at 8am and hunted for my S Brim (Silver Bream) and it was worth it too 4 S Brims around the 25cm mark, one around 28- fun to catch on a light rod and reel using soft plastic lures. Really enjoyed that- just being on the boat by myself, no problems or worries whatsoever.

However, I did get a phone call while I was on the boat- I got into ECU!!!! mothafucka!!! yeah!!! Didn't think I had it in me. Nearly fell off the boat when I heard. Yeeeheee!!!!

"event","Well, looks like things have settled down at home, things still edgy between mum and I but at least verbal communication is in play now. Fired up the petrol powered R/C car (yes, it stands for remote control) and had fun doing donuts on the street. Still a fair bit of tuning to go but just hooning around up and down the street is fun. Found out dad had been mucking around with it when slept over at Al's and Kristian's house- now it's got a cracked front rim and a leaking fuel tank. Well least dad said he'll pay for it. (heheheh) - Gotta get my hands on a video camera and shoot a video of me driving it.

Here's some good news for you all. Instead of going to timezone and spending all of my money. Gonna buy some model kits of cars and make a little diorama. Gonna be set in a tokyo carpark under a freeway bridge. Three cars with headlights on. It's gonna be SICK!!! Take me a few months to build cause I gotta fabricate some shit and get the kits first. (need fuckin money!!!)- Still, doesn't stop me from going on my 'wangan runs' at 3am in the morning.

Found out i had two chicks living opposite me the other day. Had a nice friendly chat, so friendly that i might invite them over for a drink sometime soon (hahahahaha!!)

Gonna go to an 'Australia Day' party this week. lots of alcohol and girls (yeeeeheeee!!!!)- and the blokes'll be there too. Some girl from my cadets unit is holding it and she lives near the beach too!!! Should be real good. When everyones all passed out, I'll take the boat out nice and early and catch some nice S brim.

I apologise to all the people that may have been offended with my obscenities when i was 'under the influence'- ended up crashing early too. Just way too tired to keep up with the vibe. Was intending to sleep on floor but somehow made it onto a mattress.

I liked my idea of the private bar. no one wanted to eat the potato gems so i did, along with smirnov and coke- made for a nice dinner actually.

Went to city again today, arrived way too late and ended up not meeting the people we were supposed to meet. Once again was at timezone. Might come again tomorrow with sarah le and such, but for now it's back home, wonder what sort of shit awaits me now.......

Needed to get out of the house for a few days, sleeping over at Al's (as usual). This whole uni, TAFE thing is starting to get to me. Too much stress and problems.........maybe i need to break my high speed record on the freeway (it's 300km/h at the moment, aiming for at least 323). Was hoping to start the year in a more positive note, but hey, least i go out more often these days. Still single and doing stupid shit. I have too much time on my hands- i need a job!!!!

Got myself into deep financial trouble as well in the form of getting addicted to playing 'Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune' (I'll possibly post a pic of that) but hopefully if i get it on PS2, i'll be occupied once again.

Ros' party tomorrow, should be good. time to get pissshhhed.

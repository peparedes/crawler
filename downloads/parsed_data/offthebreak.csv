"event","I havent written in a while though I said I was going to so here I am. Today we had the FCAT writing test...Easiest Assessment test ever. But SOOOO long and boring. You'd think as their job, they could make up some GOOD stories for us to read and answer questions on. Lazy People these days. Anyway, Ive written some more songs. Some say ""thumbs up"" and some ""thumbs down""...Whatever, thats life. Steven grabbed my ass today (as a joke thank god) but it was freaky. We had a fricken party on the bus man, it was awesome. We watched movies in class all day. You wouldn't believe this happened on a Tuesday. I met a gay guy yesterday. Accually, I've been hearing about a lot of gays lately. Gays are cool though, people shouldnt have a problem with them. I AM NOT GAY. I AM TOTALLY STRAIGHT. I LIKE ""THE GOODS""! I'M A STRAIGHT GUY! LMAO. But I heard about this gay kid ""going pretty far for a gay relationship"" and I almost barfed that the thought. Esther told me to think about my parents having sex RIGHT BEFORE the FCAT so I had some VERY disturbing pictures in my mind at the time. That's about it. BONZAI, AMERICAN Hi-Fi, MEST, AND THE YOUTH FAIR are coming up SOON!!!!

BTW- If you've looked at my ""current mood"", I'm not really drunk. But I wanted to see my penguin dude drunk looking. HURRAY"

"event","Yo Everybody....Has anyone ever felt what its like to go insane...Probably not..I doubt I have either but damn I am being attacked back and forth verbally and physically and its driving me crazy. Ali doesn't believe I'm sorry for dumping her and she just won't listen to me. But anyway, whats up with these kids cutting themselves...A lot of my friends are slicing up their arms with knifes because they are depressed or something. Its stupid and if you agree, post a comment about it. Thats about it. SEE YA'LL LATER!!!"

"event","I was looking over my live journal and there are some things I havent filled a lot of people in on. First, can someone tell me how to make the little penguins go there that say your emotion. Thats so cool. Anyway, since I last wrote, I was still going out with Ali. Yea, thats over. I know, its sad cause I was MAD CRAZY over her. For some strange reason, the love left me and I just had to break up with her. I know, I'm an asswipe and deserve to be hit by a truck but hey, thats life. We were together for V-day tho, even if we DID break up. I've been crushing around lately. Liking people, but unfortunatly, I never get the feeling they like me back in any way. *some people have exceptions this. Some people I feel like me but NOPE!!!* LOL, whatever. I was like enjoying my singleness. Its awesome, I was flirting with EVERYONE. But, I'm sick of it. I miss having the feeling of someone being there to love and they love you back ya'know. LMAO.
#2- I've joined ANOTHER band. Yes, I'm a DAMN RETARD cause none of them are going anywhere. Well, this point is kinda short. ON TO MY NEXT POINT!!!
The last thing that has happened to me since I last wrote is that I'm missing EVERYTHING and EVERYBODY since I'm all the way in New Orleans at the moment. Dude, I missed a party, a concert, and I missed all my friends. I've got a 2 hour plane ride back on monday and I have a PAININTHEASS 5 year old bro that was so damn annoying the whole plane ride over here. Wootwoot. Oh Well.

"event","Dude, I havent written in a HELLOFA long time! Anywho,I'm up in New Orleans Louisiana for Mardi Gras. Its really COOL. You watch like A LOT of floats go by and they throw like TONS of beads and other trinkets at you. I come home from each parade with like 500 beads. Im planning on giving a lot to all my buds (hahaha, who says buds anymore). What some people think of when they here ""Mardi Gras"" is BOOBS. Yes, boobs. If you go to this street called Burbon Street, which is a famous street with strip joints and stuff on it, there is usually a lot of girls who flash you if you give them your nice looking beads. (pretty sweet huh, yea, I bet the guyz are like HOLY MOLY I AM SO THERE). Whatever, the real party is over with the floats. Anyway, when I'm bored in between parades, I come back here and see if any of my friends are online. I'm so pissed when they arn't cause I'm dying of boredem. But I'm sure they got better things to do. LOL. To wrap things up, this is like one of the longest things I've written on here. I'll write back LATER!!!

"event","I havent written here in a while. Must have slipped my mind. Nothing big has happened except ONE THING... I was freaking BANNED from Ali's house...WTF...anyway, it was cause the bus came really early and I was at Ali's house and I'm like, ""hell no, I'm not riding the bus this early, I'm staying here"" and the bus left. I called my mom to pick me up and she was PISSED that I did that. So she banned me from going to Ali's house on the weekdays. I still see Ali everyday at school but we want to be together for a longer time then we have at school (which is usually at her house). So I'm going to do SOMETHING to convince my parents to un-ban me from Ali's house and be able to make the bus at the same time.

God Speed

Peace OUT!!!"

"event","I was depressed yesterday cause I thought I would'nt see Ali for a week. Then she called up and told me she was able to come over. I was super happy and just couldn't wait. Then she told me like 3 or 4 hours later that she couldn't come over cause she had gotten this fever. I was all depressed again and my spirits died. But she took a shitload of asprin and vitamins and whatnot, took a nap, and woke up with a perfect temperature so she was able to come over. She came over and life was good again. But now that she left, I really won't see her again for a while. :(

"event","I've been bothered like hell about the god forsaken love problems going on with people I know. Damn these stupid F*cking trajedies that go on in my life. The only exception I can think of where love seems right is Me and Ali. I'm going insane and can't stop thinking about her. I'm trying so hard to see her everyday but it's out of my power. (what power does 14 year old teen have? not much, I can tell you that). Anyway, I'm really sad cause I won't see her for a week and its depressing. I wrote such a sad song that I couldn't bare to finish it and that means it will NEVER be seen on here"

"event","Today was the last school day before winter break. NO SCHOOL FOR 2 WEEKS!!!!!! Ali got me the new Blink 182 CD because she's da best. I went to her house for like a million hours after school. I left my backpack OUTSIDE on her lawn when I left. LOL. I've been listening to this CD for EVER. The drummer from Blink 182, Travis, KICKS ASS. I went in the hot tub during freezing weather. FELT SO GOOD. I'm going to Ali's Parents' christmas party tommorow. That's awesome.
I wrote a sad song today for some reason. That kinda sucks but whatever. CHECK THEM OUT AT http://www.greatestjournal.com/users/justanotherguy/"

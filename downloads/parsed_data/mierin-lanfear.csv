"event","Tomorrow marks the beginning of the holiest of seasons, the Easter Triduum, where Christians everywhere commemorate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ--the core of Christian belief. &nbsp;So, right now, the clueless chemist takes a break from brown-nosing her labwork and reminisce (and reflect) on Easter Triduum past, back in Manila.<div><br></div><div>I have fond memories of the Triduum. &nbsp;Well, for most part, these are really old memories--as a kid, I just remember celebrating Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday with my family (which can be described as ""go to Mass, wave palms OR sing the Gloria after a long time, then go home""), but not the rest of the services. &nbsp;Good Friday, for some reason, impressed me as a day when everybody should walk and work silently (going tippy-toe and speaking in hush-hush tones, more scared of getting scolded by the elders than by ""the God who died that day""), suffering in the summer heat.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But this all changed around 10 or so years ago, when my brother (who had volunteered to serve Mass in UA&amp;P) dragged me off with him to attend the Triduum activities. &nbsp;As the younger sib, I was supposed to watch him during Mass...and being the younger one, he was supposed to mind me. &nbsp;So, he packed me off to the choir loft, with his Roman Missal and an admonition to stay out of people's hair, including his.</div><div><br></div><div>And so I learned...and appreciated this sacred triad of days: the significance of Holy Thursday (institution of the Eucharist via the Last Supper), the needed pain and sorrow (and the sense of emptiness) of Good Friday, the hope and joy brought by Black Saturday (Easter Vigil). &nbsp;And staying in the choir loft taught me my first Gregorian chants as well--my brother's former high-school teacher was part of that choir, and she took me under her wings, if only to get me out of my sib's hair. :P&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>After that experience, we went to Triduum activities every year. &nbsp;Sometimes, my mom would come along. &nbsp;At times, he would simply be an ordinary mass-goer instead of an altar server. &nbsp;At times, I would be found not in the choir loft, but counted among the congregation, who could sing a decent ""Pange lingua"" and ""Ubi caritas"". &nbsp;Attending those became a family affair.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, listening (and singing) ""Pange lingua"" in a foreign land in this season gives me a queer heartache. &nbsp;For starters, I have no brother to watch for during Mass, no mother to be with. &nbsp;I'll be celebrating the Triduum on my own, singing in a choir not because I was simply dropped off there. &nbsp;I barely remember the Latin lyrics, but I can hum the melody.</div><div><br></div><div>I guess I'm a bit homesick now.</div><div><br></div><div>Have a meaningful Lenten/Easter to you!</div><!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

It's actually circular in layout, that if you walk along the diameter of the town, you can pretty much cover everything in 30-45 minutes.</li><li><b>It is easy to get lost in the side-streets</b>. &nbsp;Happened to me once, but that's one way to learn the lay of the land. :D The official KULeuven map/bus route pamphlet is the best weapon to have on hand.</li><li><b>Buses are Belgium's version of our local jeeps</b>. Except that they're spacious, with effective ventilation and heater/cooler, with very disciplined drivers. &nbsp;You just have to remember the location of the important bus stops and the routes, or else you'll end up in a different place altogether. This, thank goodness, hasn't happened to me. &nbsp;And don't lose your student bus pass, or else you'll have to shell out 1.60 EUR...</li><li><b>You won't get run over by any vehicle</b>. &nbsp;That's how nice Belgian drivers are. &nbsp;Except that you'll get run over by bikes instead.</li><li><b>Trying to convert everything from EUR to PHP will drive you crazy</b>. Just believe me that anything over 4 EUR is expensive (for food), 20 EUR (for blouses/tops), 60 EUR (for boots). My favorite coffee-vending machine in the ALMA charges 0.60 EUR for a cafe mocha...which is unheard of in terms of PHP. &nbsp;And bus fare in Leuven costs 1.60 EUR.</li><li><b>As much as possible, greet people first in English.</b>&nbsp;Or else, they will speak to you first in Dutch.</li><li><b>It is easy to read Dutch.</b>&nbsp;But not to speak. &nbsp;Beware of tongue-twisters like ""Bondgenotenlaan"", ""Kapucinenvoer"" (street-names). &nbsp;Knowing Deutsch helps in reading, but do NOT attempt to pronounce nouns and verbs in German...guarantees weird looks.</li><li><b>Filipino ingredients are easy to find</b>. And quite affordable too.</li><li><b>Nothing happens on Sundays.</b>&nbsp;Better be ready to be bored. Or schedule important housekeeping chores. &nbsp;But it's best to attend Sunday Mass to begin the week. *cough*</li><li><b>Always wear a good coat</b>. It's autumn, and very windy here.</li><li><b>Predicting the weather is at best a futile attempt</b>. Temperatures here can swing from comfortably cool (think NMR Room at NCIC) to outright cold (think refrigerators). It's better to overlayer than to go with one layer less.</li><li><b>Keep your hands warm</b>. By sticking them in your coat-pockets. :D Gloves are for winter. &nbsp;Or...have someone warm your hands for you.</li></ol><div>Work-wise, what have I learned...</div><div><ol><li><b>Fishcare</b>. &nbsp;Zebrafish need a buffered pH environment of around 7.5. &nbsp;This is done by refreshing the aquarium water everyday with a solution of bicarbonate and calcium/magnesium salts. &nbsp;And these fish eat <i>Artemia</i>, or brine shrimps.</li><li><b>Sorting fish eggs</b>. Yes, fertilized eggs are harvested from the aquariums everyday. &nbsp;It takes a good microscope and a good pair of eyes to figure out which are the dysmorphic embryos that need to be disposed.</li><li><b>Antiepileptic assay</b>. Involves torturing 7-day-old zebrafish larvae with a convulsant like pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and measuring their length of movement as they seize.</li><li><b>Toxicity diagnosis</b>. &nbsp;Check fish larva's heart under the microscope and time the heartbeat.</li><li><b>The NMR subject here for Pharmaceutical Sciences is the toughest one</b>. But was able to help a lab groupmate pass her oral exam by tutoring her in 3 days. :D</li><li><b>It is nothing unusual to work in the lab without a lab coat, for now.</b>&nbsp;Even if you're handling interesting reagents like PTZ...just wear nitrile gloves<b>. </b>T_T My lab coat won't arrive until after 2 weeks from now!</li><li><b>Chemistry is the central science</b>. A lot of the basic problems in the lab are chem-lab related issues. &nbsp;Steric hindrances, isomerisms...and basic maintenance of the analytical balance. &nbsp;Please, the one and only analytical balance in the lab is so battered...making our ABs in Schmitt Hall look brand-new.</li></ol>That's that, I suppose. &nbsp;There are still a lot of things I want to learn here, lab-wise and social-wise. :D</div></div><!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

"event","She marks her Friday night with reviving her music library in iTunes.

Lab work is progressing at a smooth rate.  Not too fast, not too slow.  Already tested two plant extracts from our Strathclyde extract-library which corresponds to the local anticonvulsive plants listed in Pardo de Tavera's Philippine pharmacopeia. They look promising, but I have to check for true sedation AND toxicity.  Fish can sleep, apparently.

Socially, I'm slowly integrating myself in the lab.  Still trying to get the feel for the ""relationship-strands"" in the group (i.e., ""political hierarchy and the power-web"") but it's rather hard since majority of my labmates are Flemish and my grasp of Dutch is barely decent.  Enough to read, much to their surprise and delight, but not to completely understand conversations.

I'll be measured for my official lab coat next week.  Which calls for a trip to the Arenberg Campus, where the castle is located.  Hehehehehehe, field trip with my promoter!  This calls for Oui!mode instead of the proper!uber-polite Olivia.

On the other social side, I live practically alone.  Except for an occasional conversation with a fellow foreign student (a Lit major from Burundi) also living in the same floor in Camilo Torres, and a French scholar who taught me how to operate the dryer.  Nothing much--well, there's my weekday/weekend Mass habit in the American College *cough*.  I should go to the University Parish, but they only offer Masses in English only during Sundays. And I need my daily power!<strike>greeting</strike>pack that can be gained through a bit of reflection.

My eating habit is normalizing, with my guerrilla cooking in the communal kitchen, but I've noticed the shift to more vegetarian lunch dishes.  Yes, it's cheap, but I like how they do veggies here.  :D Even noticed now that my waistline's dropped to 29.5 inches from 32.  Drastic.  But then again, Leuven is walking-town.

...
What made my day today is news that ZK <lj user=""blue_cage""> and eClair got the letter from the post already. :D Only took a week, from Leuven to Manila!  Heh, I hope the other girls will get their letters soon.

Currently writing my second cycle of letters, to be posted in October.  When I get replies, that is. Haha.

...
I also realized that I can survive autumn as long as I can take a hot shower once a day.  Preferably at night, before going to bed.

I will buy a wool coat tomorrow.  Wish me luck in finding a cute, cozy one!  I'm eyeing the one in H&M, a bit high-waisted with a poofy skirt part.  Will definitely go well with my skirts. :D

I can't wait to have my credit card in the next few months...if not December, then next year.  I'm seriously considering to get myself an Innocent World jumper-skirt, given my size now.  I don't care if it'll be late for the Sherlock Holmes movie (wah, no steampunk!loli for Christmas!), but just as a gift to myself."

At the rate I'm going with my readings in the lab, I'll end up with a mental nosebleed by Friday. Y_Y Sorry, my idioms are all mixed up...I'm just a bit brain-tired, but stuffed with pizza and soda and amaretto.

And as for an interlude...well, nevermind.  Autumn's approaching and I get a bit sentimental over the drifting gingko leaves whenever the wind blows through the city park, or the nodding pansies on the chapel windowsills.  An elegant sonnet would have fit the moment."

Do you know how hard it was for me to resist buying a really nice and comfy pair of Victorian lace-up boots (knee-high, FTW!) for 99 EUR?  Or resist a bunch of really lovely yarn and a pair of knitting needles?  Goodness there weren't any fountain pens on sale so I got away unscathed, except perhaps with a broken heart over resisting such wonderful buys.<br><br>
Instead, I thought of buying myself a serviceable pack of 3+1 pairs of thick cotton tights in black, with a subtle black/black argyle pattern, for 11 EUR.  Wah, something useful for autumn!

Photos of today's adventures can be found <a href=""http://synesthesiae.multiply.com/photos/album/45/05Sept2009_-_Acting_like_a_tourist...the_only_time"">here</a>.  Isn't it obvious that I'm trying to generate more traffic for my Multiply album?
<p>Today, I embarked on a quest to (a) locate the ALMA 1 (university cafeteria) and (b) locate the ""nearest"" laundrette, along Tiensestraat.  Thus sallying forth from the guesthouse, I took a scenic ""shortcut"" through the city park, reaching Tiensestraat and proceeded to follow the road.  It had slipped my mind that I'd be cutting through the Lauduzeplein where the iconic University Library and Carillon can be seen...and where the booths for the <i>kermis</i> are set up.</p>
<p>While following the road, I spotted the ALMA 1...it was closed for the season. Argh.  Then I found the laundrette up further, also closed. ARGH.  And so far from where I'm staying (so much for location).  Walking further on, I saw another stationer's specializing in PENS.  Needless to say, I was drawn to it, browsed through their collection of notebooks and pens, before lighting on the LAMY.  The salesclerk picked the pink one for me...must be because of my color theme for the day (black brocade jacket over pink gingham, with mauve/maroon scarf, very un-autumn colors).</p>
<p>I continued walking until I reached the ring-road encircling the town.  Following the ring road a bit, I turned at a street leading back to Tiensestraat, right smack on the fair proper.  A lot of the booths were still closed, but a really big one was already open, serving its clientele fries and crepes.  I had their fries for lunch...om nom nom, the fries were nice and crispy and so not like our fries at McDo or Jollibee.</p>
<p>I traced my route to Bondgenotenlaan, the shopping district, where I got an English-Dutch dictionary, resisted the charms of H&M (it was easy...but why couldn't I stop myself when it comes to pens?!) and a bus ticket to Campus Gasthuisberg (for trial commuting).  I walked the whole 1-km length of ""de Bond"", as locals were wont to call it before reaching the bus terminal.  The ride itself was comfortable and uneventful...until it reached the campus, where it deposited me in front of the hospital!  A mistake!  A wrong turning! O_O; This part of the adventure ended with me walking across the complex, going down from the hill to the nearest bus stop.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Back at the town center, at the Grote Markt, I finally caved in and nosed about the weekend market (made more festive by the town fair).  So many garden plants (which I just read about and haven't really seen until now, like cyclamen and ivy), foodstuff and antiques!  Haha, tourist mode!  Had a rather heavy merienda/snack at McDonalds (imagine my glee upon finding one!) before going back to the guesthouse.</p>
<p>Lessons learned? ONE: Avoid stationery shops like poison. TWO: Fries are delicious, but fattening. THREE: I should do my laundry on Monday. FOUR: Stop acting like a tourist come Monday.</p>"

I will never run out of rants about how cold it is here, right?  Not really...I'm slowly getting used to it.  During the day, that is.  Without any sudden bursts of drizzly rain.

Yes, I did mention that I'm officially enrolled in KULeuven in a previous post.  So indeed.  The next thing is waiting for the summons from the City Hall so I can get my residence card and put myself on the list of resident aliens.  Hopefully I get it by next week, before the 11th.

Yes, I have my stipend and allowance already as well, in check form.  The problem is that it's the town fair tonight (and the rest of the weekend) so no bank is open.  Argh.

And, ironically, the non-essential things I bought today (i.e., the ""essentials"" today are an umbrella and my food for tonight and tomorrow morning) were: a book (in English, a rare thing!) and...a Sheaffer Calligraphy pen set:

OK, cut the poetic frou-frou.  But, yes, I'm leaving in 24 hours.  Happy?

For the next 5 years, I'll be studying for my PhD here:

Of course this will entail flying, and I have zilch experience in travelling abroad.  I guess there's always a first time...

If there's one thing I'm sure of, it's the feeling of missing people and places that I love that I dread the most.  For a Gemini, I have this aversion of saying goodbye to all of that/them.

But, quoting from Ursula K. Le Guin's work ""The Dispossessed"": <i>True journey is return.</i>  I will embark on the beginning of my true journey and end it by coming back.  I still will come back."

"event","Busy, busy months.  Had an exciting trip down Zamboanga City right after my May birthday to retrace my roots, visit dead relatives and do some bargain hunting in a barter center for formal <i>batik malong</i>.  Returned to Manila with an awesome bang and amusing family high-drama, involving unhinging certain relative(s) sanity by an innocuous photo which may have trigged a massive load of guilt-trip on their part, and became essentially a way of thumbing my nose at their shenanigans. Mudslinging from their part ensued over the INTARWEBZ, which became a LOL-tastic source of comedy here in the capital among other family members.

(Ooh, they might be reading! Please Google ""unhinged"", ""innocuous"" and ""shenanigan"", if you must!)

(And, why did I derive much amusement about the whole thing? Because I wasn't the one who got embarrassed <strike>nor forcibly ejected from the hotel by hotel security and MILITARY PERSONNEL</strike>, for starters.)

Busy, busy months before and after the adventure.  Wrapped up summer class (taught senior undergrads/Chem majors), began a new semester (teaching Science and Society, if for only a few months), running to and fro government/diplomatic offices to arrange my travel documents (yay, to Belgium!), among other things.

Just a short post for tonight.  Am sharing the results of a Jane Austen quiz:

Arrived here yesterday around 1PM with some travelmates in the department, which included EPE, IKD and a grad student (Ofel)--we went straight ahead to Panglao island, to a beach resort reserved under the dept. and joined our other co-faculty members who were already there. :D  

White sand, crystalline-blue water, a jellyfish and lots of seaweeds...with the Milky Way splashed across the sky at night.

I'll mention something more about the happenings in Panglao in a later post, but suffice to say that whatever happened in Panglao stays there, haha.

Everyone went touring today: getting a lunch cruise by Loboc River, climbing/viewing the Chocolate Hills, seeing tarsiers and Baclayon church, AND getting ourselves registered for the congress:

Some shots:

Suffering through the heat during Holy Week is a good form of penance, I think.

...
Bridesmaid updates: I've seen the teal dress (80% finished) and it's lovely.  The designer (Tina Basa-Reyes) knows and understands how women are <i>really</i> shaped.

I just need accessories.  She suggested pearls, but I need more suggestions.

And as for the list: I'll be having my hair treated with a hot oil and a badly-needed trim tomorrow.  And be waxing my legs.

...
With everything that happened last week, despite the stress and the exhaustion of being in hyper, peppy mode, I realized something:

I am, after all, a female human being who after all has a emotional side to her despite her seeming bossy, weird, logical/intellectual persona.  A side which drives her to kick clueless friends' shins when they say something truthful out of the blue.

And kicking shins is a soul-satisfying exercise."

To not count down the days too much (and worry a lot about it), I'm taking everything a day at a time.  Work and responsibilities are first in my to-do list--check exams, do grades, monitor lab work--and this helps me pass the time.

But sometimes, the thought ""this is the last time I'll be doing this for a long while"" sneaks up behind me and whacks me by my backside.

<lj-cut text=""To beat the anxiety..."">...
The lamest thing I've done for the week is to NOT make a list for things-to-bring-to-Bohol, but a list for things-to-bring-to-Leuven...six months in advance! *headdesks*

This brings to mind my if-possible-must-have list (to be sourced for the next few months):

- a pair each of knitted and leather gloves
- GetBlued's <a href=""http://getblued.multiply.com/photos/album/54/GetBlued_Sesquicentennial_Shirt"">ADMU Sesquicentennial shirt</a> - Ladies' L/Men's XS
- GetBlued's black ADMU-seal hoodie - either S or XL (the latter's long and big enough to be reconstructed into a warm hoodie-dress)
- a pair of slacks

"event","Yes, I <a href=""http://www.plurk.com/p/kcdcu"">plurked</a> about it last night, but as a general announcement to those in my FL in LJ and Multiply: <b>I got the IRO scholarship.</b>

What does this mean?  I'll be going to Leuven, Belgium for my PhD THIS YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!

The university I'll be going to is the Katholieke Universitet Leuven (aka. Catholic University of Leuven/Louvain) and I'll be gone for 5 years.

The gravity of this news hasn't sunk into me yet....I'm so happy, but advanced separation anxiety is ruining my digestion.  Truth is, I've studied and worked not more than 4-5 kms from where I currently stay (i.e., where I was born and raised) with my family, so this happy turn of events scares the hell out of me. 

(Yes, I had such a cloistered childhood [until adulthood] for a struggling middle-class family.)

So, from now until August, I'll be preparing to leave...and I don't really know how to go about planning what to bring, what to do, etc.

If there's one thing I'm sure about, it's that I MISS STUDYING.  Teaching has its own fun and merit, but after spending time at the other end of the classroom, I want to get behind a student's desk and study...and do awesome lab work."

This will pull me back financially for 12 months for only Php2000+/month.  But still, it's more powerful than Orihime the main laptop and looks so...embarrassingly pink. (But I still love my 'Hime more, because all my special work programs are there and I got her when I first worked in the Chem department.)

...
I should write a list for myself (and possibly my mom) on what to do in preparation for the wedding.  She is, after all, the mother of the groom and I the bridesmaid...and I dread the thought of embarrassing ourselves on my bro's day.

Question: what should be IN the list?  As a bridesmaid?  Am not too sure but here's a partial list of what I need to do:

- wax my legs
- get a proper manicure/pedicure (which I don't do at all in normal life), Mom included
- find the best pair of shoes (silver, to go with the teal 'maid dress)
- drag myself and my mom to Ace Water Spa weeks before the wedding
- wheedle out more info about the event from my bro and my future sister-in-law
- coordinate with the designer about the design of the 'maid dresses
- find the right accessories for the dress
- plan out where to get the proper hair and make-up done

So far, it's the third item that I've had luck (spotted a good pair, will buy by the end of the month).  The rest are <i>nada</i>.  Any more suggestions?"

...
Health-wise, I'm roughly 98-99% fine now. The remaining 2% sometimes surface (and kill) me come evening, right after my evening lecture sessions and general work.  Heck, I sleep before 12MN now, sometimes as early as 9PM because of sheer exhaustion.  Oh, and the whole experience (or ordeal) left me hating the smell of hot coffee and tea.  Yes, now I get nauseated with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee!  And me a coffee-drinker!

...
About work, we're already beginning to wrap up the semester and call it a year.  Finally.

And I've discovered (and accepted) that I'm not the ideal, pastel-sweet, gregarious and inspiring teacher.  On hindsight, I was trained since high school by no-nonsense, tough cookies who taught hard facts and rules with iron fists and left you alone to learn and discover by yourself how these facts shaped (and were shaped by) real life.

So I guess I'm a tough cookie, who smiles yet teaches with an iron fist.  Goodness, a terror!

(Although some of my former teachers who became my friends later during my uni life were the ideal, pastel-sweet and inspiring ones.  Odd, I know.)

...
And which I introduce to those who are unfamiliar with this color: teal.

Teal belongs to the family of blue-greens (equal parts blue and green).

Why did I mention this color?  Well, my bro's wedding is in May and the color motif is white/teal (with secondary shades of aqua and something like pale tiffany blue?).  And I happen to be one of the bridesmaids.

A bridesmaid.  For the first time.

I've no qualms wearing that color, but.............I just hope I don't look like a duck in chiffon in the process."

<marquee><font size=""7"">HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DANG <lj user=""blue_cage"">!!!</font></marquee>

...
Weekend report pertains to a new hairdo and alumni dinner-meeting.

New hairdo: Finally caved in and got my hair straightened after almost a year.  Instead of the usual hot oil, I opted to have a cellophane treatment.  Discovered, much to my surprise, that my hair color reverted to its original brown color.  No, the cellophane treatment did not have any dye or tint added, upon my request.

Alumni dinner-meeting (ADMU Chem): The turnout wasn't that big, as I feared.  But I daresay I was disappointed with my own batch for not coming.  Oh well, so much for the vaunted Atenean loyalty.  

However, the dinner-meeting wasn't all a waste--the steering committee was formed, ideas began to be tossed in for the grand alumni homecoming next year (the department's 50th founding year), people from different batches made new connections.

[And, yes, Ferds <lj user=""madelung""> was there, too.  His company, and Chinggay's, colored my evening.  Max, too, was there, but had to leave to join my batch's separate get-together.]

...
To do this week: go back to lab-work, 31P NMR, and prepare the NMR class samples.

I've finished knitting the 7th color block of my scarf...will begin the 8th later in the week.  Hopefully, when I've finished the 13th (and last) block, I'll get positive news.  Man, talk about superstition...

And the weather's colder than usual...one by one, my cats get sick. :O I also had entertained a wishful thought of snuggling against someone--unfortunately, there is a dearth of ""someones"" out there.

It's January now...God, save me from February!"

Cross your fingers and toes for me...because if I get accepted, I might be in Belgium starting next fall.

- Teaching Quanti chem (haha, again!) and Science & Society for this sem. And NMR lab for grad students.

- Currently learning how to knit.  Project on hand is a red/black blocked scarf of alternating sets of knit and purls.

- Lolita-side, it's sleeping for the moment.  Broke, as usual, but on the lookout for loli-able turtleneck cutsews to match my one-and-only black JSK.

- Love-life's non-existent, but that's the default.

- AND I'M ADDICTED TO HOUSE, MD!!!!!!!! Dr. Greg House is my new fangirl idol on my altar, ahaha. Because he's a mischievous, crankier version of Holmes. And my mom agrees with me about House/Wilson OTP.

A cousin of mine thought of taking her kids, and me and my mom, to have a merienda-cena at an Italian resto in Tagaytay today.  Translation: a trip of more than 2 hours from the city for ""just a cup of coffee and a bite to eat"".

The tomato/cheese bruschetta, NY pizza, mozzarella/pesto/veggie panini AND a teapot of tarragon tea...were worth the aching back.  Oh, and the fresh, bracing air of the highlands--pollution-free and cold!  And the limpid beauty of the Taal (Crater) Lake's vistas!

I did bring my Holga along, with a bit (one roll) of film.  Here's to hoping the shots did well!

Two: Arranging photoshoot skeds and permissions and people = HEADACHE

'Nuff said...all I can say is that the permissions were given, as managed by yours truly (which involved going to PSHS and personally talking to the CISD chief + formal letter to the campus director).

...
Three: Paintballs, food trips and videoke madness last Oct 30 by the department

Survived the paintball sessions at the La Mesa Ecopark with nary a bruise or hit by the marker bullets.  Does this mean that I can has covert-ops skillz?!

Oh, and boating in the Ecopark!  So much for post-20th century feminism--the women were the ones doing the grunt work of rowing the boats.  Still, it was fun...especially since we chased our fellow workers (who were in another boat) for ""stealing"" my camera while <strike>at sea</strike> on water.

And an early dinner at Hanobe in New Manila...the beef hofan, yang-chow rice, <i>taope</i> with 3 kinds of mushrooms AND (drumrolls, please) the crispy pork spareribs were to die for.  Followed by Wii + videoke showdown at Ken's place.

One word: AMAZING

For those who didn't watch the anime series, I recommend them to watch the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy, as the creators finally polished and tightened the plotlines and re(de)fined the character psychologies.

"event","The jumper skirt replica of Boz by Bodyline arrived yesterday.  It's a good thing that I was wearing my standard pintuck polo in black, so I wore it for a trial run (to assess quality, comfort issues, etc.)

<lj-cut text=""Saving for almost a month is worth it, really"">I did take a lot of camera shots of the dress for Clair <lj user=""eclair""> to see (and reviewing purposes), but I'll post them later (indoor camera phone shots = grainy).  So here's a good quality photo from the department's Sony DSLR (with a lab co-worker):

<a href=""http://synesthesiae.multiply.com/photos/album/3/Random_arting#24""><img border=""0"" src=""http://images.synesthesiae.multiply.com/image/6/photos/3/500x500/24/DSC09631.JPG?et=FRg65M9%2CrEoiwLmgoIGE3Q&nmid=56612486""></a>

Well, I did take a bad camera phone shot of the wrapper and tag (which is now posted on my office corkboard):

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mierin_lanfear/pic/00077pbr/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mierin_lanfear/pic/00077pbr/s320x240"" width=""300"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Quality-wise, it's fine--good, thick stretchy cotton twill, chrome buckles and clean pattern cut and neat seams--but the workmanship is only at par with the mass-produced garments made locally--unlined, so-so thread quality, not much leeway for seam alterations.  Plus when I got the package, a button fell off; it's a good thing I keep a sewing kit in the office, so I was able to remedy that.

Details of the bodice and waist areas:
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mierin_lanfear/pic/00078qfc/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mierin_lanfear/pic/00078qfc/s320x240"" width=""192"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mierin_lanfear/pic/000791ex/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mierin_lanfear/pic/000791ex/s320x240"" width=""192"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Details of the back:
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mierin_lanfear/pic/0007a4az/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mierin_lanfear/pic/0007a4az/s320x240"" width=""192"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mierin_lanfear/pic/0007bwwx/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/mierin_lanfear/pic/0007bwwx/s320x240"" width=""192"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

To shell out approximately Php1500 to join the group order--it's not an easy thing, with the global crisis and all.  But, if one thinks about it, a dress costs more than Php1000 if bought locally, and the current dress modes use flimsy fabrics that don't stand well in constant use.

Next up in my Bodyline wishlist is a blouse to go with the JSK, a pair of bloomers, and lace topped knee-high socks.  Soon, love, soon.</lj-cut>"

"event","For starters, I'll go back to working in the lab.  Looking forward to doing anthrone-assays and NMR experiments.  Mmmm, NMR experiments...I miss my baby, even though there are times the electronics scare the guts out of me.

Not to mention planning <a href=""http://synesthesiae.multiply.com/journal/item/1007/updates_some_photoshoot_details"">this</a> out (people in my FL, care to lend a hand?).  Am thinking of setting this up on the 17th or 25th...

...
<lj-cut text=""The reason why eClair went 'EH?!' a while ago on the cellphone..."">
Opted not to go to the cosplay event in Megamall today (sorry, Clair <lj user=""eclair"">!) because my bro and I did some house-hunting.

No, we're not moving out soon.  BUT...there's this house/lot being put up for sale a few meters from where we're staying.  So we had a look-see, with some informative chat with the owners.

It's a lovely, BIG place.  The house, despite its age (>>40 yrs), has a great floor-plan that hearkens back to 1960's Manila, with more-than-adequate room spaces.  But more than half of it is made of creaky old wood with flaking paintwork; the electrical and plumbing system look quite old and dubious...and the backyard is dingy.  In other words, it needs a major renovations to save it, stat!

Now, do we have the money to buy it?  The answer is................................no.

*laughs* Maybe not yet, but hope springs eternal.  Lottery tickets cost cheap, anyway.

And besides, bro is considering to buy the place since he's planning to get married by next year. (Ergo, no house for me and Ma! D:) But, then again, if my mom gets a windfall, it would be a win-win situation (house/lot is a duplex!)...and my cats would have a bigger place to romp.

Everything boils down to cat-care, really.</lj-cut>

...
On other matters, I'll be paying for my Bodyline JSK this week, so I might get it by next Monday or Tuesday, hopefully.

A sad side-note: Nay Lita, the favorite seamstress of mine and Clair's, has moved out permanently from her place in Cubao Expo. Y_Y; The last time I saw her (for a bit of chit-chat), she was sick and shocked from a recent spate of robberies in the area--she lost her valuables and other things because of it.  I will miss her grandmotherly attention!"

Yes, that leads to my recent wishlist.  I would like to amend that entry.  In other words, this IS my real Christmas wishlist!  Those belonging to my <a href=""http://mierin-lanfear.livejournal.com/friends/"">FL</a>--heads up! XD

(1) People helping out / joining in this ""small"" effort for Pisay (you don't have to be a camera-addict to join): http://synesthesiae.multiply.com/journal/item/1004/alert_feelers_ahoy
(2) A Vivitar PN2011 (c'mon, it doesn't cost that much...*wheedles*): http://cb1129.multiply.com/photos/album/32/VIVITAR_PN2011
(3) A fountain pen to add to my collection...maybe another one of the Schneider calligraphy pen-types?
(4) Music: from classical music to old-school grunge/metal/punk...and Utada's new album
(5) <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.ph/LARGE-CAMEO-NECKLACE-VICTORIAN-GIRL-IVORY-on-BLACK_W0QQitemZ280273017670QQihZ018QQcategoryZ92840QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem"">Cameo pendants</a>, pocket watches....accessories to go with classic-lolita
(6) A pair of shoes that look like <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/egl/12297918.html#cutid1"">the pair shown below</a>...I saw one in Cubao Expo worth ~1300-ish...*hint*
(7) Books you want me to read and discuss over tea.
(8) Lace stockings that look elegant and not...hookerish.
(9) 5-10 rolls of Fuji Neopan ISO100 120 film.  Or any 120 slide film.
(10) A giant sack of Friskies cat kibble.  Or Tuffy's. OR...fanfics / original works done by the gift-giver.

I should go to sleep, methinks."

"event","Finally went to the traditional bonfire party of the university, for winning the men's basketball championships this year.

The field was dark, crowded with happy inebriated merrymakers.  And muddy.

I went there, trudging through the mud, to see the crowd, sign on the well-wishers' whiteboard and listen to the uni's president opening speech.  Then trudged back to drier, concrete ground...then home.  No bonfire was in sight that time.

So I can say that I've been to the traditional bonfire!  Without fire.

...

Currently thinking of writing a confessional essay of a closet-lolita, as what I mentioned to Clair <lj user=""eclair""> a few months ago.

<lj-cut text=""It somehow goes like this, with a tongue poking the insides of a cheek...""><b>Offbrand/No Brand: Confessions of a fledgling Pinay lolita</b>

<i>Even when wearing a jersey, a princess is a princess...
Sew frills onto the hem of your heart!
Put a tiara on top of your soul!
Have pride.

- Novala Takemoto</i>

I admit it--I love Lolita fashion.

I adore the impractical frills and ruffles, laces and bows.  Elegant maidens in lampshade skirts, cushioned by panniers (or petticoats) and bloomers, sometimes armored by corsets and lacings, and shielded by well-placed parasols or fans.

I love it so much that a few months ago, I finally outed myself as a fledgling lolita.  Discreetly, of course, following the mode of a classic-lolita instead of following the more popular sweet, gothic or punk styles.  I had two things to consider--my age (25) and my personality. Correction: three, since I forgot to put in ""weather"".

You see--Lolita is NOT at all compatible with the climate here in Manila.  Humidity is one main cause of lace wilting, makeup smearing, and other mishaps.  So it is a challenge to start out in this particular Japanese street-fashion at a relatively advanced age AND weather.

But why persist?...</lj-cut>

And here upon I draw a blank.  I must be tired. :P"

"event","I'm working at a lumber haul out in the back of a corner hardware store. I'm being paid to get tan, wander around shirtless and haul big pieces of wood from that pile to that car. It's easy. It's fun because I work with a bunch of younger guys, it's nice to not be alone so often.

I've been writing to Ron all the time now. It's cool that we can still keep in contact.

That's about it...


Thanks about the birthday thing Jae. I had a very uneventful birthday. I didn't work. I went out the night before with Snake for a smaller italian dinner. I got to see Jae for a little while the night before, and we watched a werid movie about loving yourself.

Roxanne stopped by to say happy birthday with her new boyfriend. but I didn't see Beaner or Paul at all. Ron is still in the Pen, so I can't really see him.

And that was my birthday. *shrugs* Oh well.

I miss my mom...and my dad...."

"event","Slow day at work....I'm getting a  new job soon. Starting next month for the summer. I am tired of working here, nad my boss won't let me actually get on the  payroll....so I'm leaving.

Heading to Home Depo I think...

How is everyone??

<b>Answer these questions:</b>
If you could have one thing for yourself over the summer what would it be?
For your parents?
For a friend?
For Bush?"

"event","Things have been getting better. All in all, Dan and JAe didn't work out. I can't say that I am unhappy about it, I just hope she's not hurting too bad over him. I realized I was being a dick and apologized. It was good to see her that one weekend, but I still miss her like crazy. No matter where i go it's like I am missing a part of me, like a piece of me has flown away on wings of ebony tears, only to land with the winds of GVSU. No matter whats happenning, I just hope she's happy.

I love you Jae.



Other updates include Ron who is still in jail, but they have given his bail ammount, and if I can clean up his house we can lease it between michael and I, and raise the money to get him out of there. Newest question: How the hell to you drop soap-on-a-roap?? How?? ::shakes his head:: Once again, though, if anyone wants to send him a 'heya', just let me know. I can slip it into the letter with mine.

I found a place where we can set up a car shop, Michael, Ron, and I. It's cheap actually, and if Michael will actually pay for the rent next time I can afford to buy it and start fixing the place up.

So it looks like life is working out for me after all..."

Congratulations on making Slytherin!

Well, first off, I've got to say that Slytherins have a special place in my heart.. I am a Slytherin myself, and I love them all to bacon bits, and I refuse to let any of you leave with hugging you *hug* .. Alright, okay. So basically, you're cunning, ambitous, and willing to use any means to meet your ends. Lots of people think Slytherins are cold, evil, heartless people.. and although some are, some are not. Slytherins are the most misunderstood people.. We're not all evil! We're misconceived and misunderstood, and have been given a bad rep.. The movie makes us look like shit, the only Slytherins we have come to know are all cocky bastards (but don't get me wrong! We all love them anyway, right?! I know I do!), and people just have this thing about people with ambition.. Hmm.. Well screw society! We're the best, and we all know it! Gryffindor may beat us at, hell, everything.. but we still keep trying! COME ON, SHOW SOME SLYTHERIN PRIDE!


Slytherin to Remember

Draco Malfoy (you make evil fun, you drop-dead sexy bitch..)

Lucius Malfoy (..oh hell yeah! we all love our malfoys!)

Tom Riddle aka Lord Voldemort (i'll read your diary anyday..) 



It's kinda true for me. Heh. Funny, out of all quizzes, this one seems the most true to how people see me."

I can always cry with Jae. It kinda shows my humanity, that I am still here and still kickin'. I can cry. Peopel always think Blood shows life, but its really tears. It's all about emotions.

I guess I'll chill out for a while. I didn't have my first class of the day cause it was canceled. I wanna go see Jae. I really wanna curl up in her bed and cry. Even if she isn't there, at least I'll be surrounded by her."

So I took this lame ass quiz from D&D...here's my charastics...

<b>I Am A:</b> Neutral Evil Half-Elf Thief
<br><br><b>Neutral Evil</b> characters believe in Number One. Their personal gain takes precedance over all else, and they will work with whomever necessary and whatever institutions necessary to further their own goals.
<br><br><b>Half-Elves</b> are a cross between a human and an elf. They are smaller, like their elven ancestors, but have a much shorter lifespan. They are sometimes looked down upon as half-breeds, but this is rare. They have both the curious drive of humans and the patience of elves.
<br><br><b>Thieves</b> are the most roguish of the classes. They are sneaky and nimble-fingered, and have skills with traps and locks. While not all use these skills for burglary, that is a common occupation of this class.
<br><br>Find out <a href='http://neppyman.irulethe.net/dndwho/index.html' target='mt'>What D&D Character Are You?</a>, courtesy of <a href='mailto:neppyman@yahoo.com'>NeppyMan</a>!<br><br>


Well..I didn't like that one so i took it again.


<b>I Am A:</b> True Neutral Half-Elf Fighter
<br><br><b>True Neutral</b> characters are very rare. They believe that balance is the most important thing, and will not side with any other force. They will do whatever is necessary to preserve that balance, even if it means switching allegiances suddenly.
<br><br><b>Half-Elves</b> are a cross between a human and an elf. They are smaller, like their elven ancestors, but have a much shorter lifespan. They are sometimes looked down upon as half-breeds, but this is rare. They have both the curious drive of humans and the patience of elves.
<br><br><b>Fighters</b> are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.

I got to see her beautiful naked form this morning. I creeped into her shower and enjoyed a good view of my love's beautiful body. God she is *so* hot. ::smiles:: I am one lucky mother fucker arn't I?

"event","Yeah, I don't really know where this came from or why it's bursting out of me, so to speak. But since I got home and sat down at my computer all i can think about is how much I am in love with Jae. Yeah, I post on other peoples ljs and I do this or that, but mainly, my mind is on Jae. Now don't get me wrong, I am always thinking of her...but for some reason, just tonight, I get this outpour of emotions. So here goes...

   I'm sitting here just thinking of all the things said between us. wondering, hoping praying, that when all is said and done that you can be with me and I can be with you. That when it's all over and we toss our grad caps in the air, that you and I will find ourselves with our hopes high, our rings on, and our dreams out in front. I pray to the Dark Mother, my matron, to grant me the patience I need as every day grows and I am not at your direct side. I miss your touch. I miss your taste. I miss feeling your warm skin under my hands. I want to hold your form in my arms and listen to your heatbeat. I miss your playful smile and the threat of 'no kisses for you'. I miss the sweeetness of your voice and the thrill of your tongue carressing my name. I miss your kisses, full and warm, my air, my breathe for this long and grueling life. I want to be near you, with you, sleeping there beside you. I wish I were there now. Even though I saw you just reciently, I still want to be there now, always. I want to be close to you, next to you, and,(forgive me for possibly seeming crude) yes, inside you. I long to be connected to you, surrounded by you, carrying you tword brinks and edges within the absolute estacy that is LOVE. I LOVE YOU. I long to be with you now, just hearing the soft rise and fall of your breath as you drift off to sleep under the blue covers. 

I will always remember Florida.It alone sticks to my memory. The beach, the waves. Carrying you along in the water. The moon over the waves at midnight, eating chinese take-out with my fingers, and dodging your grandparents because they still don't like me. I will never forget seeing you that night while driving in the car, truely experiencing the awesome beauty that *is* Jaenelle at night. I remember our first kiss. My first breath of actual life. My moment of absolute truth. I knew after that that I had fallen from whatever height I was at. Falling, and breaking through the ground below. You became everything to me that night. I let myself fall, I was falling in Love. I would not deny it, even if it was only for that week. I Loved you and I would continue. I will always love you.I know that now as I knew it then. It's hear in the screaming ofmy heart when I am forced to be away from you, forced to walk out a door andforced to put any sort of distance between you and I. I know that I love you in the way I thrill when I am with you, how not everything is sexual, but everything is Love. How I understand you and you alone understand me. That is the way I want it to be, and that is the way it is. it makes me happy. I have you there for I am happy. All is right in my world. In my heart, mind, body, and soul, all is right. I only wish I were thre, right next to you tonight.

I am in love with you Jae.

"event","I guess you all know now that I offically asked Jae to marry me. It was awesome, if I may gloat about it, I stole her away from GVSU around 11. I turned on 'our' song and pulled her away from the computer. I told her how I loved her and wanted to be with her for the rest of my life. I nelt down and pulled a ring out of my pocket. I asked and her eyes grew wider and wider. I waited my insides shaking, and she said yes. I have never been happier in my life then when I am with her. I *know* I love her. I *know* I am in Love with her. I also know that I will *always* be in love with her.

On the down side, I know we will have to wait to get married. I am in college, she is in college, obviously neither of us are rich so we need to wait for that whole finicial situation. God I hate putting this off. I want to be with her every moment I can. I don't want to have to drive for 3 hours just to see her(though I would gladly do it) I want to walk in my front door and see her smiling from the kitchen, playing music in our bedroom, fiddling around on our computer, or even watching Itsumo Futari de on our kitchen and yelling at the screen or laughing at what ever just happenned. I would love to be working on a car in the garage and watch her pull up the drive way. I want those long happy nights in her arms and those crazy mornings when all we see, hear, think, and feel is each other. I wait for all that and so much more. 
I want to be with you Jae. I want to spend as much of my life with you as I can. I love you."

"event","So yeah. Jae and I had a blow out and she wanted to leave me, it got fixed and settled..almost. I have things to finish about it still, but it will happen soon. It;s time forme to stand up.

All in all I'm kinda glad that We are fixing this whole thing. I love her. I guess I always knew that the way we hooked up would come back to haunt me, but I was a coward and tried to ignore it. perhaps it's my background that speaks volumes here. I guess that I don't see it as such a big problem to be so americanized. It's the only thing I have ever known. I guess i really don't feel like i fit anto any other culture. I'll try though 'cause I want to go to Japan with Jae and have a good time as well as spend the rest of my life there with her.

This a a pretty private matter, but I'm gonna make it public. I'm wondering if 18 is too young to get married...I was thinking of proposing....making it legal. I have never felt this way about nayone before. I know I'm in love with her, and that I will love her forever. I just hope she feels the same for me. I don't want to be away from her, ever. I want to wake up every morning and be able to look over and stare into the face of my beloved.I will never get old of her laugh or her smile. I cold stare into her eyes for hours at a time....but enough of my sap...before I get lost here....because I know you all readin' this will not want to read a huge post."

"event","Another day. Not so different then the rest. Sun shines, people move. Things are. But I havn't seen Jae yet, and I hope she will make it online to tlak to me tonight. She's probabily planning on writing some tonight. But thats okay. Maybe she will letme near her. I don't mean to pout or whine, but I feel like she doesn't want me around. Maybe I'm being paranoid....after all it has been a while. I am waiting for her to dump me. Or break me, or hurt me...or something. Somthing that would signify that she is just like everyone else. I feel bad for it too. It's like...no matter how much I know that she is not like the rest of them...I've taken 20 years of torment fomr the female populus. I have been beaten, used, broken, torn, hurt, and forced into things that should never be put on to something so open because they could possibly offend and disgust anyone who happens to read my LJ. I can't take the suspense. I wish something would happen...but then again. maybe I'm just messed up. Maybe it will never come. Maybe I just need to step back and chill out about the whole thing. Maybe now is not the time for me to be harping on her. I'm sure she has enough to worry about.

On top of it all there is a fight comming up. A group of people that I know, who will remain anomymous, are schedualed to fight. I was asked to go. I innitally said yes, however, that was before Jae and I hooked up. I can't risk losing her. I don't want to have to stare down some people to get myself otu of it tho. I don't like the person I am around them. I left their group because I was forced to move, so I'm not on bad terms with them...however, If I can keep myself from being on bad terms I would feel a lot safer at night. My choices are this..
I can:
A) Go and not get caught by the poepoes and simply have Jae be slightly upset with me

B) Go and get caught and have Jae break up with me

C) Not go and Keep Jae happy, but get all of my old homies really pissed at me

As you can see...I really don't know what to do. I called him today and he said that he could get a replacement for me and that I would not have to be in this. But he was not happy with me at all. I had already committed to being there. So yeah. It sucks...and I really am not sure what to do. I refuse to lose Jae over some stupid thing such as a fight. But my boys are counting me to bring up the tail in our little problem here. I can pull a ton of weight in a fight and they might not find a replacement for me.

My other problem with this is that it reminds me of West Side Story. It's supposed to be a good clean fight...but if it's not..well that wouldn't suprise anyone. Especially with this crowd.

I only have about a week to decide. I hope he can find a replacement for me."

The third was freaky. It was her showing up at my place with cuts and bruises all over her. Her hair was mated and snarly and she was dripping blood everywhere. Her eyes were held wide open and her expression was absolutely empty of life and personality. I huged her and wanted to know what was happenning and she just felt void, like there was nothing left. She ran into my kitchen and whipped out thios huge butcher knife, she held it out in front of her and started mumbling about how death was the only answer. I reached otu and grabbed her wrist, moving the blade to point at my stomach. She paused as I took her by the elbow and pulled her arm twords me, moving the blade into my stomach. it stopped as teh hilt hit my skin. She let go of the knife and stared at me understanding suddenly dawning on what I had just done. She crumpled to the floor and huddled herself up. I pulled otu the knife and set it on the counter. I huddled down next to her and took her in my arms. She looked up at me and realized I would die. ""why?"" was all that she said. ""With out you there is no me..."" and with that the entire dream went to hell, people I have never met before showed up and started wandering around my house. At that point I realized it was a dream. The the phone rang and woke me up.  It was jae, so I knew she was okay and I breathed a huge sigh of reliefe. That was my morning, how about yours?"

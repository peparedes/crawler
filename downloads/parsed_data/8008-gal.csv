"event","Work today was pretty boring and uneventful. I had to stock dog food, and stick price stickers on every bag. Very boring.  And then I had to clean out the puppy cages. That was gross.  Rodents are so much cleaner than dogs.  At least you can get away with only cleaning their cages every few days.  They are so much cuter too.  After work I went over to Pamela's house and we hung out at her pool. She is leaving on her trip to Romania in a couple of days.  I'm going to miss her!  Maybe she'll bring me back a souvenir.  Okay well now I'm going to make dinner for myself since my parents are at a church meeting. Goodbye!"

"event","Today my boyfriend came and helped me set up this blog. I love Stew. I think im going to marry him. I mean he loves my pets. and my art...he always knows how im feeling.Its like..hes apart of me. 
Besides that... today has been very uneventful...i got home from work at complete pet mart early! so i got to play with cheech and chong my two new rats. I think hunkamonka is a litttle jealous, but i think he will get use to not being an only hampster anymore. Unfortunetly i have to go back to work early tomorrow to fill in for bobby's early shift.

Thats all for now.. im going to go fall asleep , watching animal planet! my fav.

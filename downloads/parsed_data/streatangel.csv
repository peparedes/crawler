"event","Yes, it is me... after all this time I am still alive!!! In this recent time that I haven't been updating I have some great news.. I've gotten married!! Going on almost 2 years October 25th, the best time of my life.  His name is Matt and he is everything and more then I ever expected.  We both are hair stylist and love what we do.. so that makes it easier to talk to him. LOL! 
We have also decided that it's about time to start a family --FREAKED-- but I definatly think we can do it.  He is going to be a great dad I have no doubts.  I haven't told too many people, not even my parents.  I don't want any negativity towards it, ya know? We both have good jobs, making good money..nice place and big enough.. and lots of love to give.  I can't wait to be a mom, really! I've always wanted that dream to come true.  
On to another note.. my sister told me a couple weeks ago that she is going to be moving (PROBABLY) at the end of her lease.  I was speechless, although Matt had already told me that she told him (why?), I was still under a tremendous amount of shock.  I don't know why Austin TX. exactly, but for some reason she thinks she would be happier there.  And it's very well she will be.  I was hurt of course, but who I am to say that she should be happy here?  Not everyone can handle this place.  If you aren't a bitch, in a nice way.. where you can handle the hurtful things that people dish out here, then you won't beable to live here.  U have to beable to live amoung alot of white trash and GUESS WHAT--- I deal with that all day long in what I do!!! I've just blocked it out.  I mean who says that in a couple years when  matt and I are ready to open our own shop, that we won't move?  Who knows!  All I know is, if she is really going to be happy there then let her try.. she can always come back!! (wink wink.. i know you are reading this)
Anywho, I'm not goin to draw this all out.. but what I will say is that I might not update every day, but I will sure try!!! 
Take it easy and I'll write more later!!!!!!

I know I haven't been a good friend, and I don't deserve anyone on my side to be called a friend ... a friend is just that... a friend.  You can all call me a peice of shit, but I love you all.  Rich, to you ... You are my one and only best friend.  Things have changed in my life, but that will never be different.  I wonder sometimes why you even bother to keep hanging on to me as a friend .. I know I've done you wrong, and I am truly sorry.  Right now a ton of stuff is happening all at once and as overwhelming as it may all be, I should still find time to be with the people that gave me friendships... but it seems that my life is in such weird states that I just don't have enough time in the day to wipe my own ass, let alone go out to dinner with a friend to catch up on old times.  I feel horrible and I should be hung for all my misconduct.  Rich, I love you ... you are everything to me and I don't want to lose you.  I have lost you in many ways ... I don't even feel like I know you at times .. I just feel like a person that ""just know's rich""  it's like I can't even call you my bestfriend because I would be lying .. or so it seems.  Things have changed in your life so much and we rarely talk .. god how I miss you.  But the point is I love you and I miss you so much .... please always remember that.  I read all your journal entries and I just wish I was there when you needed me to be .. all those nights that you cried .. and just needed a friend...  I am a horrible person ...  please forgive me  ..."

It's cool though cause they don't expect that much out of me .. lol .. but the cool thing is that I will be so close to old friends that I've missed alot since I've moved to Tulsa so that will be an advantage.  I also start cosmetology school the week that I move .. EXCITED !!  Finally I can start working on my dream of making the world look better... lol.  Naw, ya'll looks good ... you betta back that thing up.

Things with Austin aren't that good, but I am working on it.  The thing is he and I just don't communicate on a normal human being bases.  We are so good in person and we connect like you wouldn't believe, but when we can't see expression then we tend to go overboard and we just make things more difficult then it really needs to be.  I hate that.  I wish that things were back to normal, but they never will be.  I have to look at the now and find time to make things better as they go, which I am willing to do.

The thing is, he said some really hurtful things that have just really tore my up inside, but I've learned that I am none of those things and I am not going to let him get to me like that.  He is the one that did all the damage to our relationship ... he is to blame for all of this.  The fact that nothing meant everything to him for 11 months is sad and the hurtful things that he has said about me even after everything that I've done for him will stick with me for enternity, but I will forget eventually.  I am better than he will ever be .. He is fucking sick. To string two women along while he is having his fun is terrible and devastating at the same time... but to think that this girl is just going to forgive him is the worst.  He doesn't deserve to eat shit off my shoes let alone be with a girl that seems somewhat respectable.  I've told myself that I should talk to him and at least say goodbye and have a nice life, but he hasn't done that for me and I am the only one that fucking deserves that.   I am done with it all.  I've moved on and I am having fun ... for the first time in a long time.  I can be who I was a long time ago... someone that he never met obviously.  I met a really good looking guy tonight and gave him my number, doubt he'll call considering that I am so fucking unattractive :: what austin said about me::  Yeah well if I was so fucking ugly then how the fuck did you get it up each and every fucking time we had sex?... funny thing is ... nah nevermind...

"event","Hi.  Haven't wrote in here for a week now ... umm what's new?  I dunno, things have been really fucked up lately.  It's weird, a person has just come back into my life that has been kinda gone for the past year and it feels awesome.  I haven't really hungout with him for awhile and it's really nice to see and talk to him again ... Anyway, I'm not gonna talk much about it.. But, other than that shit's been going down with Austin once again.  I got an e-mail addressed to kyle I think his name is, and to myself.. yeah what the fuck happened there?  Anyway, the email said that Austin was going to see his girlfriend that lives in Arkansas for the weekend .... whatever.  Anyway, so I confronted him and he told me that I misunderstood it all. I didn't take any of that as the truth.  It pissed me off enough that I thought I didn't want to speak to him for the rest of my life, but something happened and we've been talking.  I am so sick of not trusting him, it's ridiculous.  I mean honestly, who the FUCK tell's someone that their girlfriend lives in another state when she actually lives here with him.  And on top of that .. it's fucking Arkansas where Jennifer lives.  Yeah, well I don't believe that he didn't go and see her and he won't convince me otherwise.  If he did then that's great, maybe he has found something in her that I can't ever pocess.  All I know is that she is 4 hours away and he can keep in contact with her emotionally, but I am here physically.  That actually makes no difference to me what's so ever. If I ever find out that he actually went there and slept with her or anything romotely to that ... there's gonna be hell to pay and paybacks a fucking whore with me.  It hurts to know that he talks to her and may tell her nothing about me... that maybe she loves him in a way that makes him feel 10 times better than I do.  IF that is the case then fucking have her.  When she called his cell phone and I saw the number and her name come up I wanted so bad to call her back and say do you know who I am... I still do.  I have her number and I know her e-mail, but something tells me not to.  Austin says that I have the power to destroy him, well I don't want to.  IF she is who he wants then great, go get her!!!  I can't compete with someone that know's nothing about me.  If she only knew who I was and what he tells me then maybe this would make more sense.... maybe if this is all the truth about him not going to Arkansas he will just let me call her and be done with it.... who know's.  Maybe I'll make the decision myself.  Anyway, we are talking now and things just aren't the same after that night I saw that.  I am completely embarassed that there is a great possibility that he's cheated on me .... but I dunno.  I don't want to think of him as that kind of person ... but everything was black and white in front of my face ... anyway.. i am in a great mood and I want to share it with someone.  I'll think more about this Austin shit later... bye"

Memories seem to rush through my bones like a cold wind... chilling my heart with the knowledge that they will never be again... He has left and taken my desire to live with him... Why am I still here - you ask, well the truth is, I don't know the answer to that... maybe it is the vain hope that one day I will look through my window - and there he'll be, waiting for me... beckoning me into his powerful arms... maybe I am just lost in my memories of him... all the first times, all the kisses and wishes and promises .......
The dream that portrays all of humanity as innocent and good has become a joke to me now... for where is the good? Where is the innocence? ... my magic garden of happiness and faith wilted with the realization that fairy tales are lies... Everyday I see a world of routine, a world with no excitement... There is nothing when you are alone... 

Someone once told me that it is those who help others the most, who are hiding their loneliness... I have loved and cared for more than my share of people who have labeled me as not worth their time... not worthy of their eyes to look at... or their fingers to touch... You learn to numb the pain of someone shrugging you off when the night before you held their hand while they were sick... When you covered them with a blanket in the middle of the night and looked down at them, brushing aside their hair and thinking to yourself; ""I miss you... we used to be friends/lovers... what happened? I love you, yet I hate you all the same..."" And you know that if you were in their position, they wouldn't give you a second thought... they would rather you rot in a ditch than hold your hand... Why do I do it? Why do I care?

 Everyday I think of all I had and what I lost... But why I lost it and the repercussions that came with losing everything are of two different values... I lost everything because I was so blind... My desperation made me numb and sad...
I tried to be happy for him, but it was too much... too much effort for someone whose soul was starving for something I could not find... and still, to this day cannot find... I have no doubt in my mind that he loved me... but does he truly know what love is?  Love is not lies, betrayl and sneakiness ... it is true and colorful and one of a kind!!   One thing in life I have to question from now on.  Love, it's not the easy thing ...

 ps... what a great little story ... I love this!!!"

If you're having a hard time saying what you need to say, perhaps you need to experiment with other means of communication. There are many ways to get your message across that don't involve words. A tacit approach will probably make for a stronger statement, anyway. Go ahead and try gestures, cards, paintings and tokens that encapsulate everything you've been feeling lately. The key here is that you're honest. If you're simply trying to sugarcoat something that is rather serious, you may end up with a sticky situation"

If you get the chance, you may want to consider some kind of rebirth ritual. Try a new hairstyle, bathe in mineral springs or go spelunking into the caverns of the psyche. And most of all, get ready to emerge as a new and vibrant life form. Show others the strength it takes to let go."

"event","Being a vegetarian isn't good all the time.  I went and ate tonight at TGI Fridays and needless to say I am sick as a dog right now.  I'm not going to go into how sick I am, but let's just say that it's gross!!!  Anyway, I just got the strangest call ever... it was from James and he wanted to hangout... except it's 130am... I'm tired and it's weirding me out that he called.  We are good friends, but I haven't heard from him in months.  Although he works at Mazzio's and I see him from time to time because Ashley want's to see Jason ... I just haven't had the time to chat with him about anything like we use too.  Things have changed and I wonder what kind of person he is.  He seems extremely lively and he's always been very entertaining, but he's never been reliable and that is what caused our break-up to begin with. But, I shouldn't be talking about the past because he's changed and that's cool enough.... anyway... so I am gonna go puke now.  Austin is going out of town this weekend, but for some reason it just isn't adding up ... I dunno, maybe it's paranoia ::sp?::  but I just for some reason get a bad feeling about it. I dunno .. I don't trust anyone anymore... just to much bad stuff has happened in the past months.  I've had all kinds of dreams about Austin, but I don't talk about them because he thinks they are crap.  Well, I believe in things like that and some of the time it happens... just in another form.  Like I had a dream about him seeing someone else and it woke me up for the rest of the night.  That was just the other night... and then the next night all I can remember is him saying to me I don't love you anymore .. someone else has taken your place.  I was scared in the dream because I woke up with goosebumps.  And then the dreams just get worse.  Maybe that's why I don't sleep that well... hmm..   Anyway... bye"

"event","Well, it's been a couple days since I've wrote in this thing.  Sorry guys.  I've been kinda busy lately thinking about things that have been going on and I just haven't wanted to sit down and type all of it out.  I am sick of feeling sorry for myself so this is the time that it's all going to stop.  Yes, I am very sad right now .. and yes I am very angry about certain things ... but I continue to shovel them so far back inside my heart that it is crushing my secruity in myself.  I'd like to think that I am a beautiful person with many things to offer to someone that is willing to take me for who I am .. don't you think?  Well, why do I feel like I've been dumped for someone new and just thrown away like I've never mattered?   I've always had a problem trusting people and now it is just going to get worse.  I thought that this would be my chance to finally get over what has happened to me in the past, but all it's done is cause questions and confusion about how someone can do this to another human being.  How someone can look another in the eye and know damn well what they are dong to that person ... the person that has loved them... the person that has done so much for them ... the person that made them feel alive at one point in time?  Do they just block out feelings except their own and go about life like it's just another day?  Don't they think about what they are doing?  Who the FUCK do you think you are taking someone's heart like that and pounding on it so hard that it just becomes nothing?  I know life is suppose to be tough, but when it becomes unbareable... what else is there to do?  There is so much that is good in my life, but I can't get past the bad right now to see this.  I have continuously been sad over all of this and I don't know when I will feel better.  I don't know when I will be myself again ... I just want someone to care about me again like I once had.  I want someone to love me for who I am and want to be around me because they love being with me.  I want to feel happy again.  Happiness is what my life use to contain .... I use to laugh all the time and now all I do is sit and think about shit.  My head is so full right now that I can't even sleep at night without having horrible dreams and waking up every 30 minutes.  I haven't had a decent night's sleep in over 2 months.  I just want someone to care enough about how I am feeling to make me know they care ... I try so hard to let everyone know how much I care for them ... little e-mails just saying hello ... stopping by to say hi... I love you's... and I don't get any of those.  I just want one I LOVE YOU e-mail from someone.  Just so that I know you're listening and what I'm saying matters."

"event","Congratulations, you're Elizabeth Bathory!

Hailing from sunny Transylvania, your first blood-related incident was when you stabbed a servant girl in the face with a pair of scissors for underperforming. Some of the red spray landed on your hands, and as you washed it off, you noticed that it left your skin fresh and young looking. From then on you were convinced that the blood of young girls was the secret to eternal youth.

Rather than killing girls outright by stabbing them or slitting their throats, you enjoy torturing them for weeks on end by pricking them with needles or prodding with sharp spikes - all to bathe in their blood. You've killed over six hundred women, all without raising a peep from the authorities.

If you wish, you can proudly tell the world that you bathe in virgin juice with the following fine graphic

Jesus, how can this stop?  I hate feeling as though I am putting in so much effort on something and the ""thing"" I am putting the effort into doesn't really realize how much it takes for me to do what I do.  My heart is only so fucking big and it's like everyday it is getting smaller and smaller.  I am so tired of doing and doing and doing and not finding any satisfaction in what I do.   No only do I continually stay depressed all the time ... I'm just not me anymore.  As soon as I start enjoying myself in the least bit something comes and fucking knocks me in the face with a pile of shit for me to eat ... I HATE IT!!!  God, when is anything going to seem right?  I don't have any self secureness ... I don't even know if I believe the people I am around anymore.  I've been lied to so much in the past couple months that it's driving me literally insane.  
I tried to tell Austin how I've been feeling today in an e-mail.  I told him thank you for being there for me and that I appreciated it all... and that I loved him.  I didn't expect much in return from him through and e-mail, but what I got wasn't what I expected either.  I know that we see each other all the time and we talk all the time... but, maybe I would love an e-mail just one morning saying I love you.. just waiting for me.  I don't want to start feeling like just because we've been together for this long that we need to stop making each other feel wanted.  I know we say it to each other ... I just don't want love to be ""just a word"" to us... I want to feel it tremble inside my body once again .. and I am trying for that so hard... but I am just so insecure about things and myself that it's hard for me.  I need him to reassure me that he's not sick of me and that we are doing fine... I need that right now.  And I don't think he realizes just how much I need that ... I feel like I am a wall that is fixing to crumble because of all the stress I am taking and just that little bit of reassurance keeps me balanced ok.  ok.. I am done with this.. I am just bitching now.. ::sighs::"

Tonight was a fun night... weird but fun.  I didn't do shit all night, but the thing of it was is that I wasn't worry about anything tonight.  Austin took the day to himself and it didn't worry me in the least bit.  It's like I have so much stress on me right now that nothing is getting to me.  Does that make any sense?  It's like I am blocking out all kinds of things.  My wall is thick.. very thick.  I talked to James tonight... He's having problems with his girlfriend and he needed a shoulder to talk on.  He thinks very highly of this girl and I've never seen him this way with anyone else.  Although the eight billions times that we were together he never treated me as good as some of these women.. but it is nice to know that someone thinks highly enough about you to want to talk to you about their problems.  There is nothing between us at all... just friends in case ""someone"" is wondering.  This is the first time I've talked to him in almost 3 months.  NOTHING THERE!!!!  I've got my eye elsewhere and that's where it's sticking.  :)  It's been stuck there for 9 months now.  Besides, there is nothing for me to hide ... so I'm not worried about it.  
Ashley and Walter broke up tonight.  She called me crying at like 12:30 am and I just sat there with her.  I feel so bad that she's gotten herself into this mess.  It's like now she is settling for a loser because she is afraid of being alone.  I know she'll give into him... that pisses me off.  It's her life though... some of us carry on with things that we no won't work for the future.. and then some of us get slapped in the face with the truth that maybe it's not meant to be... just some get it before others.  Life is a crazy fucked up thing.. and it sucks.  
I hope that Austin isn't getting tired of me... I worry to much about that.  I'm worried that I don't do enough for him... but like I know I do alot .. more than I should... but I like doing things for him.  I dunno, anyway.. I'm off."

I could afford to not give a shit
and buy a drink and drown the day.
But your pockets, they are empty,
Yeh, and mine are times two.
So why not make an about-face,
And accept the love I send to you?
You're never gonna be content if you don't try,
To see outside your line.
There you go, you did it again!
You act as if there's blinders on your eyes.
Should I appologize if what I say burns your ears and stains your eyes?!
Oh, did I crack your shell?
When it falls away you'll see we exist as well!
Like a bottle with the cork stuck,
You're true ingredients are trapped up inside.
Through the cloudy glass we catch a glimpse of you.
I guess the hard shell represents your pride.
Oh, if only it could be different,
We could uncover the you, you deny.
Between two, a small discrepancy,
One complicates and one simplifies.
TAKE THOSE FUCKING BLINDERS OFF YOUR EYES!!
So if I had a dime for every time you walked away,
You could bet your bottom dollar that
I'd be filthy rich by noon today.
 
Will I ever get to where I'm going?
Will I ever follow through with what I had planned.
I guess it's possible that I have been a bit distracted and the directions for me are a lot less in demand.
Will I ever get to where I am going?
If I do, will I know when I am there.
If the wind blew me in the right directions would I even care?
I would.
I take a look around; it's evident the scene has changed.
And there are times when I feel improved upon the past.
Then there are times when I can't seem to understand at all and yes it seems that I'm going nowhere... really fucking fast.

I felt horrible that he drove all that way for such a short time, but it was nice that he did it.  We came back to my house and hungout for awhile and I ended up giving him one of his present because I thought that maybe he could use it right now .. and because I am such a kid with present.  I just can't control myself.  If they had a short bus for 21 year olds that acted like retards about presents, then I would be the one that sits up front with my face pressed against the glass drooling and screaming MEEEP for a whole 20 minutes... :)
He liked the blanket alot so it's not like it was a waste of him opening it.  Plus now I don't have to worry about him finding one and getting it and ruining my present.  Besides the fact that I gave it to him a month early.  Anyway, so we went out to eat and I had a really fun time tonight.  I need to stop paying for so much stuff, but it's like I can't help myself.  And when he tells me not to pay for things I get pissed because I want to ... it's weird.  I know it's kinda a guys thing to pay for things.. but shit ... oh well.  We talked alot tonight about Wyoming, it was kinda sad thinking about it all.  It's coming up so fucking fast.  The thing that I hate is that one minute he'll be right here with me and then the next minute he'll be starting his life somewhere that I can't be.  I mentioned to him tonight that today would be/is our 9 month anniversary... he got really quiet.  I don't know what the deal is with that. One minute he's talking to me on the phone calling me his girlfriend and then the next minute I feel like I've hit him in the head with a lead pipe because I bring it up.  God, I was thinking tonight that I've never met any part of his family besides his mother .. and I'd really like to eventually.  I can't help feeling like he's hiding me for some reason.  I mean that sounds mean, but like he won't even let me talk to his father online just to say hello.  That's strange to me.  He tells me that he talks to his dad about me, but I don't know to what extent.  I just want to feel like I am part of his life more than I feel right now.  I would be so happy to just say hello to the grandma that he is so fond about.  I just wish he felt the same way.  I dunno how he feels about it.. it's kinda a lost cause asking because I just don't think it will ever happen.  But, it would be really nice.  I guess it would make me feel as though he really thought highly enough about me to meet his family ... strange .. and I know that some people wouldn't agree with me, but I am a family person and would be very appreciative if I got the chance.  Anyway, enough blabbering.."

Man, I just got done wrapping presents and I found two things today that I wasn't expecting to find for Austin .. so I wrapped those and put them under the tree that Tara and I set up today.  It's actually nice seeing the X-mas tree up.  It's kinda a warm feeling of giving... know what I mean?  I wish that Austin would call, although I am still feeling really awkward aboiut what happened last night .. I miss him.  Normally we watch Jackass on Sunday nights and we just hangout .. I wish I was doing that.  I am really tired right now and stressed.  I need another vacation!! 
I do need to get away from everything just to think... life in general.  I just wish things weren't so condratictive.  Anyway, I am gonna jet.. I am actually in a better mood so maybe I'll just hangout by myself for awhile.  I told work that I didn't want to come in until 12 cause I thought Austin and I would be together most of the night since we really haven't spent anytime together alone for awhile... but I dunno if he'll call or not.

It's not the normal depression that I feel, it's much worse.  There are only a few people that know the side of me that get's this way and I tend to try and keep it to the only people that seem to give to fucks about it.  I laugh so much, but at times I just want to curl up in a ball and cry.  I feel that right now.  It's easy for me to write this out because I really don't think many people read my journal entries.. and it tends to be some sort of therapy for my head just to see my fingers typeing out how I am feeling.  Weird I know, but true.  God I need a hug right now.  I need something.  I need someone to make me feel like I am loved and I am beautiful.  But, right now everyone is asleep.  I wish there was someone holding me right now .. touching me and making me warm .. I am freezing balls here.  I think my fingers are getting frost bite.  I was thinking today about all the depression that Austin and I talk about and I can't imagine what he goes through on a daily basis, but if it's anything like what I'm going through right now then I can honestly say that I know what it feels like to just want to take a fucking gun and get to blowin.  I know that sounds bad, but I am just sick and tired of the everyday routine of working and hearing bullshit.  I want someone to do something for me for a change.  I think that I do so much for others and I never ask for anything in return ... but it would be nice to really have someone reconize the things that I do and show me how much they appreciate those things.  That would make life so much easier on me.  Hopefull that doesn't sound too dis-tasteful ... I just want a little note or a flower picked from the neighbors yard or something just saying ""shit girl, THANK YOU""  That's it...

So many people say that U2 is just a bunch of old balls trying to be young again, but the fact of the matter is that these are men that have gave so much and are still giving because they love what they do.  I am listening to this song and it gives me chills down my back because every verse is so strong to me .. I could never write poetry like this and if I ever did then I would be trying to compete with something that could never be matched. The song Kite is now one of my favorites due to the fact that during the concert it hit me that my life is at a point of stand still.  It's like someone is holding this bag of tricks for me to play in, but I am scared off by the facts of succeeding. What's my goal in life anyways?  What if I go to cosmetology school and I hate it in the end?  Not only would I have wasted 7 grand, but I would've wasted 15 months of my life doing something that I thought I would love just to find out that it's just not for me.  I am so scared of failing and not being able to handle failure if that happens.  I could never look into the eyes of my parent's if I failed at something I felt so passionate about at this very moment.  Just the thought of spending that kind of money and then deciding - eh, this wasn't such a good idea --- that FUCKING bugs the hell out of me.  I have NO ONE pushing me right now because of the capability I have.  The only thing that my parent's are doing is telling me that I better get my ass out there and do something because I am not making the kind of money THEY want me to be making.  FUCK THAT!!! I could be the richest person on the earth and be miserable at the same time because money is filthy.  It's a beautiful thing when you do have it and you don't have to worry about a goddamn thing in life, but when it becomes the only happy thing that you have it becomes filth.  I want to be happy in life.  I want to make money.. sure... but I want happiness.  I want to be comfortable in my own skin and I'm not right now.  I want the depression that I have in my heart to cease.  - your eyes as black as coal --- u2 --- walk on by, walk on through .. walk till you run and don't look back for here I am --  GODDAMN that is another great song.  That say's alot right there.  Austin came over tonight after his driving thing today and it was a great suprise that he stopped by.  We were about to go out to eat when he asked about this party I am having on Saturday.  We got into this fight and all I had said was that I wanted him here, but if he wasn't going to be happy about it then just don't come.  He got upset because I wouldn't listen to his reason .. and the only reason I wouldn't listen is because I was sick of hearing that either way he wasn't going to be happy ... when in fact I was trying my hardest to make him happy by telling him how much I wanted him here.  Well, he stormed out of the house and all I said was what the fuck did I say ... I wasn't fixing to go out there and try to talk to him because I didn't think that I did anything wrong.  Matter of fact I said what I thought needed to be said.  I was hoping that he would come back and apologize and he did .. it suprised me because it was nice that he did that.  It meant alot to me that he took the effort to come to my door and say I am sorry after that argument ::it took balls::  He'll never realize what that meant to me.  We talked about alot of things and I just wish that he would trust me and come and talk to me like he use too.  We use to communicate on a level like I have never done with any of my friends.  I felt like he thought I was helping in some way.  Now it's like he talks, but keeps things to himself because he doesn't think I can do anything about it.  Which may be true .. but it also might be good to talk it out with someone that loves you so that they don't judge you like the rest of the world.  He takes way to much stuff out on himself when the blame should be at another's feet.  Life is what you make of it and if I let out all the saddness I had inside of me I wouldn't have anyone left in my life.  -- I want you to know.. that you don't need me anymore .. I want you to know... that you don't need anyone or anything at all--
WOW ... ok .. I'm on my U2 trip again.  But, back to Austin... Tara asked me tonight what I was going to do when he leaves .. I just sat there and a tear rolled from my eye.  She sat down right next to me and hugged me and said, ""all though you may of had some rough times with him, you're in love with him and it'll crush you when his car leaves and it's out of site and your still standing there trying to be strong only to cry on the inside hoping that he will turn around and grab you and tell you to come with him""  -- I started bawling .. that's exactly how I am feeling.  I am crying right now just writing about it.  If he only knew just how much he has affected my life and how much I love him ... I don't think I will be able to just tell him or even show him and that hurts me.  I may never see this person again when he leaves. Or if I do what if he's changed so much that there just isn't any room left for me.  I am so scared that he will leave and he will flick me out of his life like he's done to so many people ... and he'll find some way of getting over me.  I don't think that will happen, but what if it does?  -- I know that this is not goodbye --  I wish he realized how hard this is going to be on me.  I am getting sadder and sadder as the days approach that he will be leaving.  Sooner or later he will start to pack and I won't be able to handle seeing it.  This seems easy for him, but I think maybe he is starting to realize that he is really leaving and this isn't a dream and anything could happen while he's gone.  I wish that Wyoming was a girless state .. then I wouldn't have to be scared of him meeting some beautiful girl that blows him away and is everything that he has ever wanted.  That is the most selfish thing I have ever said and I am a bitch for saying that, because what if I am not meant for him and he does meet that special person ... I can't ruin that for him.  I don't want to meet anyone else, nor will I have the time.  But, as much as I am going to try my hardest to keep in complete touch with him .. I HAVE to see him try his hardest because that is the only thing that is going to keep me trying.  On the day ::god forbid:: that he stops trying, that's the day that my heart will start to turn around and walk the other way.  That may be harsh to say, but if I don't see an effort from him then that's when I will know that I wasn't meant for him ... is that wrong on me?  Hopefully I'm not that bad of a catch to get over so quickly.  I would like to think that he would want to try and keep things going while we are doing the whole school thing.  I am still waiting on him to say I want to try and stay together while we are apart ... god I am waiting to hear that.  I am so fucking sad right now ... how ridiculous is this.. I've cried and now the keyboard is covered in tears.  This has become a fucking novel.  Goodnight all ..."

"event","I am so tired and depressed.  I don't know what's wrong with me ... I feel like I am taking up too much of people's time and I feel like shit because I am so tired all the time.  But, the thing is is that I want to spend as much time with people that make me smile .... I just came back from Austin's and he did that for me tonight .. it was nice.  I could've used a big hug from him, but I was just too tired to ask for one.  I just wanted to go to bed and lay there.  I am freezing right now ... goodnight."

"event","I just got home from work, which was a very long and boring day.  My back is killing me and I am exhausted, but the thing is I didn't do hardly anything today.  I've tried getting ahold of Rich to ask him what he's been up to because we have been playing phone tag this past week ..  I miss him.  I haven't really hungout with him since I got back from Denver and I am thinking that our schedules just don't mix anymore.  It's kinda sad because I am use to talking to him about everything and now I really don't have that.  If I call him he is too busy to talk because normally he is at work and he's the big manager now, but even if he calls me I can't talk that long because I am always at work helping people.  I just want to sit and have one of our talks like we normally do.  I need that right now.  
Austin came over last night on his way home and I gave the book that I had been making him for the past month .. he liked it.  I don't think he really knew what to say because no one has taken that much time to do something for just him .. at least I don't think so.  I have no idea what his ex use to do for him, but I would like to think that I am totally different from her.  Well, of course I am different.  The picture that I've seen of her about a year ago will tell you that much.  I really hope he's over her.  Sometimes I wonder if he ever thinks about her and wishes that he was back with her.  When we broke up about 3 months ago he brought her up and said that he has never really gotten over her and that he didn't know what to think about us anymore ... I didn't know what to think.  Is he over her?  I would like to think he is, considering how much he knows I care about him and how much it would kill me to find out that he's not over her.  I mean shit, how would he feel if I said that about Alex ... that I'm not fully over him?  It would hurt.  And he would most likly think about it from time to time.  Aynway, it's not that big of a deal.  I am just blabbering.  I wish that I could spend some time with Austin.  It just seems like he's too busy right now.  Like I'll call him and he'll tell me that he'll call me right back and it's like 4 hours or more until he does ... if he even does at all.  I guess it just bothers me a little bit.  I dunno, it's not that big of a deal really .. I guess I am trying so hard to spend as much time with him as possible before he leaves ... I just hope he's not getting sick of me.  Anyway, gotta go."

"event","Since Friday afternoon I have been in this dull mood of depression.  I dunno what it is.  It's like I need a hug and maybe that will clear all this up.  Austin's been gone since Friday and he said that he would call, but I have yet to hear from him.  I wonder what's going on.  I called his cell phone last night cause I missed him and I didn't get an answer.  I called his house today at like 7:30 and his mom answered and I just asked if he had gotten home yet.  She said no and asked if I had talked to him because the last time she talked to him was Saturday afternoon.  I told her the last time I had spoke with him was Friday and I was just curious about where he was cause we were suppose to hangout today.  She said that he was suppose to be home like at around noon or somthing and was wondering herself where her son was at... I just started laughing and said for her to let him know that I called.  She's a nice lady .. I really hope that I stay in touch with her when Austin leaves .. it seems weird to say that, but she is really nice to me when I call and when I stop by.  Anyway, so I guess Austin will just call me whenever he wants too.  It pisses me off for a split second that he does this.  I mean yeah it's not like we had any great plans this weekend or anything, but like he said that he would take me out in his car with the new springs and do something because we hadn't hungout since like I think Wed. night.  It just ticks me off that he doesn't call and just let me know what's going on.  He know's this.  It's not like it's some big news that Nicky's biggest petpieve is someone who makes plans and then doesn't call when it get's screwed up. If something happened and you can't make it out then just call .. it's that simple.  I am not mad at him, because I just figured that he got all caught up with his friends and just didn't realize. I didn't sit around and wait for the phone to ring today .. I hungout with Halen and Ashley for awhile .. but I really would've rather seen Austin ... I miss him.  Shit, it's not like Austin has to check in with me ... but it would be nice to know what's going on (as bono would say).  I just get worried when he says he's gonna do something and he doesn't.  It worries me that it's just not important enough for him to remember the little things.  I guess it is a girly thing, but why do I always remember the date that we got together and on that day I just sit there and I don't say a word because I don't know what to say.  Should I say happy anniversary?  I don't even know what we are.  I would love the words ""together again"" to come out of his mouth, but I mean we are together .. but are we really ""TOGETHER"".  I hate this.  I hate wondering things that should be so FUCKING simple.  It doesn't take a fucking genius to figure it out. I know he loves me .. it's just confusing and I hate to be confused.  I am so happy right now, but it would make me even happier if I had a clue as to what is fixing to happen in the next month.  Whoa I jumped to a totally different thing then I want to talk about.  I finished Austin first Christmas present .. he is going to love it.  I am going to give it to him early cause I can't contain myself when it comes to gifts.  I want to see him smile ...  goodnight."

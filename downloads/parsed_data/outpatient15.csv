"event","THIS IS MY VERY FIRST ENTRY!! THANKYA SIERRA 
SO...
I went to register for school today. My schedule sucks, i have world history, geometry, and biology for the whole first half of the year. and i have art3 and thats IT! i had to get a shot today, it hurt realy bad, but i got a sparkly bandaid. my friend brittany and her boyfriend were there, her boyfriend had a whole in the butt of his pants.. mom thought it was funny and made it realy obvious and she was staring. 
we went to WalMart and i hang out with my friend Nathan and one of his friends kept calling me Avril. lately ive been getting it because of my shoes? whatever. i need school to start, so i can find out who my boyfriend really is.
im bored bored BORED bored. 
the neighbor boy realy needs to come over and ask if i want to play basketball or swim. i realy want to go swimming but i cant go by myself. i think its a phobia."

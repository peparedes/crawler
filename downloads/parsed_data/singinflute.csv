"event","Not really fun...maybe. Tonight commences my rehearsals for my next opera. The opera is 2 1/2 hours and I sing about 1 1/2 hours of that. No, I'm not joking. I'll have a 90 piece orchestra playing under me that may just completely drown me out. We'll have to see about that. I'm singing with them for the first time on Saturday morning. First thought on that is...who the hell schedules an opera rehearsal at 10am on a Saturday?!?!? Do they not know that singers voices don't wake up until at least 11am? This will be interesting. I also have my first rehearsal with a pianist tonight. It's quite possible that I completely suck tonight. Everything is different with the piano part. All of a sudden you can't hear your own part in your head. I'd like to think I know all of it...tonight will be a good test.

So, my NY transition commences as well. The first potential employer has received my resume. Now, whether they throw it away or not is yet to be determined...but the effort is there! It's possible that I may have to be an RD again. NOT my first or maybe even second choice after being out of Res Life for 2 years, but if it can get me in the right direction, I'm all for it! 

As for men...well, I'm having coffee with my very attractive Italian (really, he's from Italy!) singer friend tomorrow night. We sang an opera together about a year ago and have kept in touch. There's nothing there, but at least I can spend an hour or so with a really attractive straight SINGER with an Italian accent... did I mention he calls me Bella? Hehe...nice."

I stopped for a minute and realized it was probably his way of making a joke. I checked my email tonight and he sent an email saying he liked my pictures posted and especially one all the way to the right. Ummm... what do I say to that? Last time I checked, we broke up.

"event","I didn't have much to update on until today. Funny how that happens. Well, I'll start with the bad and end with the good. A couple days ago I had a serious thinking session about singing. Yes, I know I have a beautiful voice and that I'm hired quite a bit to sing...and even paid sometimes. The problem is...I can't support myself with it. It's quite frustrating to work 8 hours at a job you feel ""eh"" about; then go home and spend the last few hours of your day doing what you REALLY want to be doing...and be exhausted while doing it...and not get paid. IT SUCKS!- especially when you have two, yes TWO degrees in it. To be completely honest, I'm sick of it! I'm tired to driving to NY to sing my best at an audition (which I did 97% of the time this year) and get jack SHIT out of it. I understand that's the business but it gets old. Okay...rant over.

Did I mention I'm PMSing?

Anyways...good news is that I had a long talk with my coach last night and he gave me a few ideas. Basically, his response was that I'm being a lazy ass about my singing. To quote him...""You fit singing into your regular life...you should be fitting your life into your singing!"" I thought that was very well said and true. So...(yes, now on to the good news) when I got 2 emails today for auditions I KNEW I had to work around them. First, I have an audition with Chicago Lyric Opera. Not as big as the Met but still an AMAZING company to work for in an amazing city. I've already started looking for flights. I can't afford it or have time to take away from the next role I'm learning...but I'm going. Second, I received an audition in NY for Chelsea Opera. They're doing Suor Angelica...which I just sang the title role in back in October! So, there's no reason why I can't sing the shit out of that audition! It's on a Wednesday (highly inconvenient for traveling) but I already replied saying I accept. I may end up in a cardboard box by the time I'm done ""fitting my life into my singing"", but at least I can say I'm giving it everything I have!"

I do think it's pretty incredible that it's 2009 already. I'm going to save the nostalgia for another post but it's cool. Here's a quick update of my last week or so. Xmas was fun with the fam. My time off has been pretty relaxing so far. I haven't done much work on my music. I decided I needed a real vacation before I can dive into more ""work"". 

So, as for New Year's, it was okay. I went to Chris and Ken's house. There were about 8 of us and we played asshole. I went from the President to the asshole after one round. Kinda crappy. Then I quickly worked my way back up. Phew... I'm actually quite impressed with my consumption of alcohol. Since ending my evil medicine I can drink as much as I want now. Well...within reason of course. So, I started with a few mango margaritas then had a couple fresca and mango vodka (very yummy) and then a glass of champagne. All that and I wasn't drunk. I'm quite impressed. Granted this was over 5 hours so it's not such a big deal. Well, tonight is the annual CORE reunion. All of the Cores (RD's) from Roger Williams and I are getting together at Beth's for some drinks and apps. I'm sure it'll be a good time.  Happy New Year!

The Singer's Christmas Carol by Tytania Strange

(sung to the tune of the 12 days of Christmas) 

On the first rejection of Christmas, the opera said to me ""We had too many applicants this year"" 

On the second rejection of Christmas, the opera said to me, ""We weren't casting sopranos and we had too many applicants this year."" 

On the third rejection of Christmas, the opera said to me, ""You should have sent a demo, we weren't casting sopranos and we had too many applicants this year."" 

On the fourth rejection of Christmas, the opera said to me, ""You're over our age limit, you should have sent a demo, we weren't casting sopranos and we had too many applicants this year."" 

On the fifth rejection of Christmas, the opera said to me, ""Apply after you've finished schoooooooooooooooooooooool ... You're over our age limit, you should have sent a demo, we weren't casting sopranos and we had too many applicants this year."" 

On the sixth rejection of Christmas, the opera said to me, ""Your resume's too empty, apply after you've finished schoooooooooooooool, you're over our age limit, you should have sent a demo, we weren't casting sopranos and we had too many applicants this year."" 

On the seventh rejection of Christmas the opera said to me, ""Thank you for singing, your resume's too empty, apply when you've finished schooool, you're over our age limit, where's your goddamn demo, we weren't casting sopranos and we had too many applicants this year (it was like 800 or something!)"" 

On the eighth rejection of Christmas the opera said to me, ""It was a hard decision, thank you for singing, your resume's too empty, apply when you've finished schoooool, you're over our age limit, did we mention that demo, we weren't casting sopranos and we had too many applicants this year (and each one sent us $45 bucks, score!)"" 

On the ninth rejection of Christmas, the opera said to me, ""We regret to tell you, it was a hard decision, thank you for singing, your resume's too empty, apply when you've finished schooooool, you're over our age limit (the unwritten one, hah!), where is your demo, we weren't casting sopranos and we had too many applicants this year."" 

On the tenth rejection of Christmas the opera said to me, ""We only had two contracts, we regret to tell you, it was a hard decision, thank you for singing, your resume's pathetic, apply when you've finished schoooooool (WHAT??? but I graduated 8 years ago!), you're over our age limit, you should have sent a demo, we weren't casting sopranos and we had too many applicants this year (you know how it is when you put a listing in CS.) 

On the eleventh rejection of Christmas the opera said to me, ""Best of luck with your career, we only had two contracts, we regret to tell you, it was a hard decision, thank you for singing, your resume is hopeless, apply when you've finished schoooooool, you're over our age limit, you should have sent a demo, we weren't casting sopranos (or mezzos either) and we had too many applicants this year.""

"event","I have returned from the great state of NY. Here's a little recap of my weekend...

I left Friday morning around 9am (which was supposed to be 8am). I stopped at CVS to make copies of my headshot for my auditions. The woman refused to let me copy since my headshot was a professional picture. Funny since that's where I copy ALL of my headshots. I tried to explain to her that that's how headshots work. You get one master and the photographer gives you the negative to make copies. Well, she wasn't having it so I just left...annoyed.

I arrived at Brian's apartment around 1:45pm. I changed quickly and walked to the Met. I was really nervous walking there but once I got inside they were all very friendly. I was surprisingly pretty calm. I could hear the other singers before me. Some good...some not so good at ALL! I knew I was better than some of them...so I felt pretty good about it. I chatted with a current chorus member...which by the way, all of them seemed to be in their 40's or 50's. That didn't seem right to me. Anyways, I went in and sang fine. I chose a piece that was about 5 minutes long and they cut me off before the end. I was a little surprised until I realized that 5 minutes for one piece is a long time in an audition. I think they really couldn't have been bothered. I know I didn't suck but they didn't seem interested in me. Oh well...I sang for the Met.

After, I went to my friend Scott's condo and met his wife and BEAUTIFUL baby. SOOOOOO cute! The cutest blue eyes ever!  Her name is Millie and she was precious. It was a nice visit and a beautiful condo. I spent the rest of the night watching TV at Brian's. He and his very recent ex (as in it happened hours before I got there) were at rehearsal. The three of us hung out of for a bit before going to bed.

Saturday morning, Brian, Allison and I went for brunch. I went to my next audition. My friend Jody played for me. I sang the same piece and they heard all of it. :) Then they had me sit and talk with them for a few minutes. That's ALWAYS a good sign. This audition was for the Opera Company of Middlebury in VT. They truly enjoyed my audition and said they wanted to come here me sing my next role. I told them it will be in March. Then they said...""well, we'll have to do a road trip!"" WHAT?! Now that was funny. It was definitely the polar opposite of the Met audition where I got a stone faced ""Thank you"". 

I had lunch with my friend Jody and on the way back I ran into Joshua and Karin at the Penn station train station. How random!? Joshua lives in Ithaca and was meeting Karin for lunch in the city. Karin's lives in Boston. Weird...but it was good to see them. I had a coaching down by the Met. That went really well and it was good to see Louis. At this point I was beyond tired from walking 10 blocks here, 11 blocks there, etc... I wanted to be home and I had a 4 hour drive ahead of me. Ugh...

All in all it was a great way to end my audition season. There will be more auditions at the beginning of next year but that's it for December. Thank God! I can't wait for my 2 weeks (minus 2 days)off from work! All I'm going to do is relax and learn my next role. That's it! I don't remember my last vacation and I have lots of things coming up in 2009 (3 operas from February-May). Time to get down to business!"

It really has nothing to do with what happened, but for some reason it popped in my head. So, 10:28ish this morning I get a text message from my coach telling me that I was scheduled for an audition at 10:35am. HA! Really? Thanks for letting me know...here's the background on that. I applied to a company called St. Louis Opera Theater and I received an email saying that I was being placed on the waiting list. Well, for some reason I was on their list to sing today. I'm sure you can imagine the panic I felt. My coach was kind enough to call me (after a good half hour or so of complete anger and frustration) and told me that they can hear me at 5:29pm today. Not 5:28pm not 5:30pm but 5:29pm. Nice. It was a huge sigh of relief until I realized that STILL doesn't give me time to go home and change. Oh joy. I'll just wear what I have on I suppose. More on the sexy, less on the professional side.

I'll leave you with a little more Dane...

Anytime I think about this weekend I get...nauseous. I'm trying to remain calm about my audition at the Met but it's not working. It just stresses me out more. I know my coach told me to remain calm and just think of it as any other audition. Well, since it's going to be like Fort Knox getting in, I'm pretty sure any sanity I have will surely leave once it comes time for me to start singing. Let's hope I'm wrong. Okay... I don't think talking about it is helping.

I'm housesitting for Chris and Ken this week and watching their two dogs. They're sweet... but not at 5am when they have to pee! I do enjoy being a 2 minute drive from work. I could probably walk in 7 minutes but it's too cold! I know...I'm lazy. I like having an entire house to myself. It's quite calming. It helped me this weekend when all I really did was laundry and practice (oh and watch a 90210 marathon!).

Did I mention it's supposed to snow Friday? Ugh...I actually have more fun filled things going on this weekend other than my audition. Can you believe it?! Well, Friday night, I'm having coffee with Scott Harris. I haven't seen him in years!! It'll be nice to catch up. Maybe he can help me find a job...or a place to live! Saturday I have another audition with a smaller company. After, I'm having lunch with Christina and Kirsten...two of my singer friends in NYC. I'm staying at Brian's so that'll be nice to catch up with him too. I'm coaching with a man I worked with in Florida...really good!...then heading back to Boston. Busy busy...but still good."

Funny and crappy all at the same time. Anyways, we still talk and email occasionally. So, long story short, he'll be in Providence for a competition this weekend. I left him a message yesterday saying that after he wins the competition Saturday, I'm taking him out for a celebratory drink. Well...I haven't heard back.

Times like this really make me wish I lived there already. Soon...soon. Well, my latest audition was for Disney. This was the third time I auditioned for them so I felt it was appropriate to ask him a little about the process. He explained that he was in fact the Casting Director for Disney so I wouldn't have to audition for anyone else. That's a relief...unless, of course, that meant he didn't like me. Well, last night I decided to email him. Here's what I wrote:

Hello Mr. Larosa-

I wanted to thank you for having the opportunity to sing for you on Tuesday. I wish you luck in your search and hope to have a chance to work with you in the future.

Thank you,

Melynda

This was his response:

The pleasure was all mine Melynda.  It was a pleasure meeting you.  You
are one talented girl

All the best,

Ron 

Now, you're probably thinking...""Wow Melynda that's great!""- which was my initial response. Then I started analyzing his words...as only I can do. I'm wondering...was this the standard PFO (Please Fuck Off...in opera terms). Was he saying thanks but no thanks? Obviously I will never know unless he calls to offer me something. Then I think...well, he didn't have to respond AT ALL...but maybe he felt that I AM talented but not right for Disney and wanted me to know that. Ugh...oh well. I'll just sit and wait again... :("

Well, just the left side. ""Why don't you go to the doctor?"" you may ask. I've told her about this and she said it's normal. Apparently 20% of women can FEEL when they're ovulating. Oh joy! Somehow I'm not feeling special about being in that 20%. This would be incredibly helpful if I WANTED CHILDREN, but no... now it's just annoying.  The pain should be gone in an hour or so. It usually is anyways. Inconvenient! Oh, don't worry, this doesn't happen every month. I actually did a bit of research on this...which is called ""Mittelschmerz""  which is German for ""middle pain"" aka...the midpoint in a women's cycle. It can be every month but for me it's every 3rd month or so. I haven't paid enough attention to memorize the pattern. Okay, I'm going to find something else to distract me for a bit.

I'm sick of rehearsals, but it's about that time. I'm very excited about being the lead and it has given me a new boost of confidence. I was also just offered the lead in another opera in March. It's with a 90 piece orchestra...DEAR LORD! They seem to think I can do it so...I CAN!

I'm sure anyone reading this knows of my plans to move to NY in May/June. It's a very scary thought, but I'm determined that I need to be there if I want to continue to pursue my career. All of these new things on my resume will be great additions for any NY auditions.

Relationships...this has been a thorn in my side. I don't even want to talk about it anymore. All I know is that I don't want the hassle. Even when things are good it's not for long. I was listening to a radio show a few months back and it's still stuck in my head. The man was comparing humans to other species and saying that we're the only ones that find one partner and stay with them and only them forever. He was questioning if that was normal and if we were truly capabale of doing that and being happy. Interesting point...Clearly we ARE capable of it because many have done it. But...does that explain all of the infidelity? I googled facts on marriage and found this...

""50% of all marriages in America end in divorce.""

Age at marriage for those who divorce in America Age Women     Men 
Under 20 years old                                27.6%        11.7% 
20 to 24 years old                                36.6%        38.8% 
25 to 29 years old                                16.4%        22.3%

These could just be numbers but, they're scary! Clearly I'm no where near marriage, but with numbers like this why would I want to be?"

"event","Well, I'm back from  Florida. I don't even remember if I said I was going. I went to Tampa for 10 days to basically be picked at and criticized. Sounds fun doesn't it? Well, it really is that bad but believe it or not it's worth it. So...feedback. After singing for the panel of judges and having them say that I'm not consistent, I don't sing to the end of phrases, and my technique is SOMEWHAT lined up...yet, they loved my dress, SOMEWHAT like my voice, and SOMEWHAT are interested in me while I sing. Really? Now, remember this experience is supposed to be educational and helpful for future auditions. Well, I can honestly say that those comments were NOT helpful. Yes...I know to sing to the ends of phrases now...and yes, I will wear that dress to my future auditions...but really? is that it?

Besides that, I received very important feedback by the very well respected Howard Watkins. Mr. Watkins (who I had the privilege of working with several times)summed things up for me nicely. The concern with my inconsistency is that I'm not always singing. What does that mean you ask? Well, it means that I sing so sporadically (even though I'm almost always in a show!), that my technique doesn't stay solid. I guess it's the same with anything. Let's take someone's drinking tolerance...(only because I really could use a drink!) If you drink everyday for a week, you're tolerance will improve/go up. If you stop for 2 weeks and attempt to drink the same amount, it will no doubt take a little while to get back to where you were. Well, the same goes for stamina and consistency with singing.

So...that being said...I'm moving to NY. I say I AM moving instead of I'm considering moving because I can't consider this anymore. We talked about this quite a bit and decided that I need to be constantly challenged and on my ""singing"" toes. Boston just ain't cuttin' it! There's lots to sing in Boston but not much is challenging or right for me.

So...with the exception of my lease, I'm at a free enough place in my life to just up and go. I don't have anyone or anything tieing me to Boston. (If you say Dan, I'm slap you!)

So, my goal now is to finish up what I'm working on in Boston -including my very fabulous show at the end of October you should come to (it's the BIGGEST thing I've ever sung!) make sure I'm done with all gigs by May (when I hope to move by), find a job and a place to live. Easy right?...HA! You know nothing's easy with me...enjoy the ride!"

Well, yes and no. I've noticed that he's back on match so I feel that gives me free reign to do the same. Well the date was okay. We met for ice cream and had good conversation. I wasn't really feeling a whole lot though. It could be the fact that I compared him to Dan the entire afternoon. One good thing is that he showed more chivalry in that one date then Dan's shown in 7 months. If nothing else, the date was good for that.

So...I went to my friends concert the other night and usually I sit and sing along and enjoy my evening. Well, it was all good until a song called ""Anyway"" came on. I started singing along as I usually do until I realized what I was singing. My eyes started to water and I had to look away from the stage. All I could think was ""How dare he?! How dare Dan invade my fun time with bad thoughts of our relationship?!"". Here are the fun lyrics I enjoyed...

I just heard you whisper in my ear
I can feel the hair on my neck stand
You just said you loved me so I don't understand
I thought you would always be here
But there's no more passion in your eyes
There's no more burning in your gaze
I think I can feel it, the ending of our days
My heart's not responding to our lies

And though I don't know about you
And I don't know what to do
All I know is I love you Anyway
I wish that we could just go on Pretending to be something we're not
I can't seem to give up on everything we've got 
Not you- I think you're already gone.
I'm doing the best that I can do
It seems there's no talking it out
Something's just lacking that you can't go without 
Soon, what's missing will be you 

I wonder if I always knew 
But then I wonder when it all went wrong
I'll just have to move on without you Then I wonder why I think I'm strong enough
And though I don't know about you
And I don't know what to do All I know is I love you Anyway

Pathetic I know. You must know by now, that I connect very strongly to music."

I know...to you this may seem trivial but to me, it's the most exciting day of the year. The actual day has passed (yesterday in case you're wondering) but the celebrations have not! Tonight I enjoyed a nice dinner with Chris, Ken, and Jen. This weekend will be my friends wedding (not exactly a birthday celebration but still more fun!). So...I went out for drinks Sunday with some local friends here in Boston. It was fun and it was good to see everyone. I got some nice presents too (including a Tiffany's bracelet!). Last night I went out to dinner with Dan and then went to the movies. It was a nice night but something happened. At some point during the night I realized...""yeah...I think I'm done with this."" What?! Why now? I've been so weary of saying it's over and ending it (which I still haven't done) but I definitely got the feeling. I guess that's a good thing?

I guess we could start with the entire opera I have to learn by the middle of August. That may seem like a lot of time but not when you have a full time job. As my voice teacher says...it will happen. Yeah I don't doubt that...it's just that I feel like it's war and I'm not winning!

I'm very excited about my birthday! Not as much as usual (since I don't have much time to celebrate. Also, several of my close friends can't be there. I don't have ANY plans for the actual day. I took the day off from work just because but now I wonder what I'll do with myself. Learning music or cleaning my house are not options. Anyone have any thoughts?"

"event","I was thinking that today would be a good day. I woke up (feeling good even though I couldn't sleep all night!) a few minutes before my alarm clock went off, I played awesome upbeat music and sang all the way into work. Then...I came across a payroll error. Ugh! This consumed me for 2 hours. It made for a fast morning but still sucked. Then I was completely out of it. I decided to sing on my lunch break since I have more music than I know what to do with to learn and memorize before the middle of August. Turns out there's some big conference here completely consuming the campus. I had to literally move their tables from blocking the practice rooms. Then I was annoyed and it took a good 10 minutes to really get into my singing. Now it's only 2pm and I'm already ready to go home. I still have 3 hours. The good news is that I DON'T have rehearsal tonight! I got the movie Enchanted in the mail so maybe I'll watch that tonight. Who knows...let's just hope this ends today.

Let's see...I know there's LOTS to update on. I'm not even sure who still reads this but we'll soon find out. My opera opened Friday and it went well! We've had good crowds and people are performing well. We have one more weekend and then a few weeks of free time! I can't wait! I just started learning my next role since we start rehearsals in September. I also have a few new pieces to learn for the voice program I'm doing in Florida. It was pretty intense last year and I'm sure it will be no less this year. I just need to be prepared and ready to WORK!

Now on to the boy...no, don't correct me with the word ""man"". I would've used it if I felt it was appropriate. So...things are the same. I do find it odd that they can remain the same since we both know we're looking for two different things. The other day I sat down and thought about what I really want. In all honesty I just want someone to spend time with. The way my schedule is now and the amount of practicing I SHOULD be doing...there's NO TIME for a boyfriend. Sure it'd be great to have one and hang out all the time...but they're distracting! I'm sure this will end badly and with me in tears. 

Okay...that's enough updating for now I suppose. I'm sure I'll have more to say tomorrow. I think this could be therapeutic."

When Cory and I reached Bethlehem after the VERY long 5 hour drive I thought I was in hell. There was nothing but broken down factories and houses that looked like they would fall down any  minute. I immediately began to panic. Then we continued to drive and I soon realized that that was not a true reflection of Bethlehem. It was really a very cute town! I loved the sign that said "" Help Bethlehem glitter, please don't litter"". The hotel was nice and had a nice display of Xmas tress featuring different countries in the lobby. Cory and I made a top 10 list to sum up our weekend. I think this displays the highlights well.

10. Learning the many faces (and one ways) of Bethlehem.
9.  Watching Justin's (my accompanist) piano act (Mashed or Baked?)
8.  Being serenaded (kind of embaressing)
7.  The Rail Bar (really cool!)
6.  Running to peek out peephole of hotel room to see drunk people
5.  Cory making Bith connections 
4.  Friendly people (I might need to move there!)
3.  All 5 Bith members attending my concert (I almost fell off the stage!)
2.  Carrying ""THE"" Peep 
1.  Singing my first First Night Concert (Yeah!)

To make matters worse, the vet wiped him down with some stuff that makes him smell nice but now Raven-Kelly has NO idea who he is.

So, a few weeks ago I emailed Boston Opera Collaborative because they had auditions for Hansel and Gretel. I was going to be in NY for an audition so I couldn't make the audition. I asked if they were having auditions any other day and they said no. They explained that I could mail a resume, headshot and CD so I could be considered. I thought it was a long shot but I did it anyways. A few days later I got an email saying they'd made their casting decisions and I wasn't chosen. No big surprise there. Well, today I got an email that said due to cast changing they wanted to offer me the part of the Dew Fairy. Sweet! Nevermind the fact that I've done the role before and it's literally a one song role...it's still a ROLE! I need to keep singing even if it's small. Let's hope there's more good luck to come.

"event","All day long all I could think of was coming home and relaxing on my couch. Well, now that I'm here...all I can think is that I should be doing something. I need to learn how to relax without feeling guilty.Anyways...I got another audition in NY! The only problem is that it's 5 minutes after my other audition that day. I emailed to see if they can change me to another time that day. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. Since I'll already be there it would be a shame to cancel. So, I did a concert yesterday with Cory and a man who might possibly be the worst pianist I've worked with. He kept complaining that he only had the music for 2 weeks and we didn't have a lot of time to practice. Ummm...last time I checked professionals got their music and just learned it on their own. I shouldn't have to teach it to him. Whatever...it's over. I'm excited for a few days off. I'm going back to Deal or No deal. I love this show!"

"event","So, I've sent out 8 applications for competitions and Young Artist Programs. I feel good about that (except for the 18 more that I have to send). Is it obvious that I want to leave here? I actually really like my job here. Yes, there are things that bother me but isn't that true for any job? Anyways, so I've been spending so much time on sending out the applications, CD's, proof of citizenship, proof of age,head shots, recommendation letters...the list goes on, anyways, I have failed to actually prepare myself for these auditions. I have one on Saturday in NY (thanks Jeff!) and another one on the 30th in NY again (thanks Jeff again!). 

So, I told my voice coach about these auditions today and he basically kicked my ass in my coaching. The coaching which was supposed to last an hour went for 2! He just kept going...he had lots to say. I will say that I think it was the best I've sung in a while. Basically, I've figured out that I'm a ""safe"" person. I've always been in my singing but I got to thinking about other things in my life and realized it goes all around. I had the same experience in my voice lesson on Saturday. I guess it's true that if you want to do something bad enough, you'll do it. 

I feel like I might've subconsciously been holding myself back with my singing. You know...if I'm not good enough then it's okay that I'm an RD and not singing professionally. Well, I've vowed NOT to give up unless I get nothing. Out of these 20 something applications I'm mailing in, if I get nothing then I can officially say that I've tried. Until then, regardless of how much I think I'm sucking or how unqualified I feel like I am I'm going to keep going. 

It's hard to talk about this with people because all I usually get is ""you have an amazing voice, of course you'll make it!"". I know I have a good voice. People wouldn't pay me hundreds of dollars to sing for them if I didn't. Well, what people fail to understand is that singing isn't like other professions where you just keep mailing in resumes and eventually you get something. Not so much...you can keep trying for years and get one or two things. My conversations that I've had with current successful opera singers haven't been encouraging, especially when you hear things like ""yeah, I had my electricity turned off, I wasn't sure if I could pay my rent...it was a rough 10 years."" 10 YEARS?!!? Are you fucking kidding me? I don't think I have 10 years of patience. Then I realized why it took 10 years...everyone else had given up by then! Anyone who knows me knows that I like stability and like to feel safe. 

I guess I'm done ranting...I need some sleep."

I'm excited to be sitting on my couch and watching Brothers and Sisters (good show by the way. I don't really have anyting to say. I will say that I don't enjoy growing up. I've been told that there are certain things you're supposed to grow out of when you get older. What if you don't want to? Eh, whatever. Oh, there was a brief crush for about a week...until I found out he has a girlfriend. Ha ha...nice!"

"event","Okay...maybe not see but whatever. So, I'm exhausted from opening but what else is new. So, I don't really have much to talk about. Well, since I haven't written in forever I probably do but I can't think of it right now. All I can think of is a nice hot shower, my sweats and dinner. I need to find a movie to go along with that but I'm sure I'll find one. So, I filled out this survey on myspace (mainly because I'm just bored and want to go home)and in the survey I had to check off everything I fear. I didn't enjoy it therefore I won't relive it. Let's just say, it was entertaining. I can't stop yawning. Eh well... I really need to fill out some applications for young artist programs. I had a great conversation with an old faculty member which was inspiring but also made me realize why I'm still doing Res Life and not singing. I'm scared. I'm scared of being poor, of not having a home, not living comfortably as I have my entire life. It was harsh to take at the time but now I've come to accept it. It helps to say it because it forces me to deal with it. I'm not upset about it or anything. I'm just reminding myself not to be afraid and that this is my passion that I must follow. I do love my job and coworkers but I'm always looking for my next performance or can't wait to get out of work to get to rehearsal. It was quite obvious this summer when I found myself saying, ""God, I can't believe I have to work today. I have so much music to learn."" Yeah, that's just not right. Well, I'm going to see if Doug's back so I can go home. Later."

"event","So, week 2 of closing in coming to a close. Graduation was today and the seniors are currently packing up. So, why am I writing in here you may ask? Good question...I'm using my one free hour this evening to check email and relax myself before my late night begins. I worked all afternoon and I want to be able to destress a bit before I go back in 20 minutes. As for an actual update, things are good. I guess. I can't really complain. Things are good with Mike and I'm happy with that. I still get neurotic when I haven't talked to him for a couple days, but I luckily I keep that to myself. I just realized that after my two weeks of closing, I go on duty for a week. Ugh...at least most of the students will be gone. Well, I have a few auditions coming up. I auditiioned/interviewed for a church job on Thursday. We'll see how that goes. I have an audition for a summer program at New England Conservatory tomorrow. I hope I'm relaxed enough to sing! I have another audition on Tuesday for a new opera company in Natick. Lots on the horizon. Let's hope luck stays with me."

I feel you should be able to get your work done during the work week and on special occasions you'll need to stay late. Usually that's the case but grad housing is kicking my ass. So high maintenance! Anyways, I think I'm going to see my mom today. It's a nice day and a good day for a drive. I can't wait till June. I think my life will slow down then. That painful audition I did last week didn't have any results. I guess just good audition experience. Zhanna got the part of the whore. That will be fun to watch. lol. Well, I think I'll start my day today. Oh...got a text from Mike (West Side Story) asking me to go out this weekend. We'll see."

"event","I'm beginning to think I have something seriously wrong with me. I sooo called this one. Approximately 3 weeks ago when this dating frenzy started I told Cory ""You just wait! In two weeks it'll be back to zero."" And I was wrong about how long it would take, but it's back to zero. So, brief run down. Met Al, had a drink, talked a few more times, he mailed me to call him, called and haven't heard from him since. Maybe ""call"" meant something else? Next is Mike from West Side Story. Went out for dinner, great time, emailed me to sing karaoke when he returns from LA. Haven't heard from him. Did LA swallow him? Finally is Mike #2. Met him, went out 4 times, talked about a week ago and he said he was ""going out with the boys"". Haven't heard from him since. Maybe I'm not good with Mike's? So that's the abridged story. Oh yes, and what makes me think of this today? Well, Beth got engaged today. Woo hoo! I knew it was coming since last week...AND she asked me to be in the wedding. This reminds me of a song ""Always a bridesmaid, never a bride"" This weekend will be fun too. I'm going to Jodie's bridal shower and then am rushing off to sing at a wedding. Maybe this is what's bothering me. Too much wedding crap in one week.

The kicker is this...I'm reading a dumbass book called 'The Rules'. Yes, it's a dumbass book. It's only $6.99 if you want to waste your money."

I was fairly productive at work today. I had a crappy staff meeting but that just seems to be the norm now. I've accepted it. Hmmm...I got to sing some new music after work today. My voice is severely damaged from all of the coughing I've been doing. It should be back soon since the coughing has almost completely stopped. My students leave Friday for break. I can't wait. It will be nice for a little quiet. A few friends from RWU are coming to visit tomorrow night. I'm excited! They haven't come since September. Well, one has but that's it. It's funny I wasn't sure we'd stay in touch when I left. I'm glad we are.  I really do like Daniel Powder's song Bad Day. It's very catchy. I don't know that I'd want to listen to it if I actually did have a bad day though. Oh well. Maybe I should just go to bed early. That would be a change. Hopefully you had a good day as well."

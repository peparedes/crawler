""One More Time""
<font face=""verdana""><font size=1> <font color=white>

Lullabies, butterflies and goodbyes make me cry (oh my)
They all remind me of you (yeah)
In the trees honey bees, birdies tweet when they look at me
They sing dat song about you (yeah)

[Chorus:]
Even the clouds can see its over
And they can feel my hurt inside
When the sun comes out tomorrow will I feel alright
Come back to me
Dry my tears for me
Wont you hold me one more time
take my only be my only
Come back for me one more time
One more time, one more time, one more time yeah yeah
One more time

Teddy Bears, rocking chairs, it's not fair (it's not fair)
To share these treasures with me, yeah
My reflections shows that I'm alone, on my own
Waiting by the phone, I know you wont call for me yeah"

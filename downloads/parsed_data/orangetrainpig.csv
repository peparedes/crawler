The secrets of the universe are now clear to me.
Is it possible the Almighty bestowed me with perfect clearity?
Or were these abilities gained threw careful planning by that first protien that stood up and declared ""I AM MORE THAN LIFELESS GOO!""
I am no God.
I am no diety.
I am no poet or bard.
I am not even impressive.
But I do hold the wealth of human achievement and knowledge within my grasp.
What time forgot is gone.
What time hasn't learned will come.
Time is an invention. Like feet and meters.
Like the wheel and the Hydrogen Bomb.
And the medicine that created our chemical reaction.
If humanity is a virus of the Earth, when will we spread our AIDS?
If Homo sapiens really are only being of human nature.
Then do we really have free choice?
The answer is imagination.
Thinking. People have it, but don't use it.
It's the only power that goes unused.
Ultimate beings are the only ones that don't partake.
Men destroy the weak. Like animals.
Only they invent to do it.
We destroy with words.
With thoughts and ideas.
Dogs can't even talk.


Hypocrisy is really what sets us apart from 'lesser' animals.
And what keeps us from the angels."

That last month of my life has been up there with the hardest. Alex and Brennan have been gone, two of my best friends. My mother has been getting my hopes up about an attractive girl at church, the girl was not enthusiastic. I got a job on my own. I still dont have the lap top. My mom's leg is healing. Hurricane Charlie raped Florida. There is nobody to make me feel better. It is rare when I'm fully comfortable around girls, many I'd never be comfortable around. I LOVE the girls I'm comfortable around, but they never love me back. There are so many attractive girls I see everyday, I can't strike up a conversation with any of them. The taste of Edmonds, the Fantasy Fair, Alien vs. Predator, Dash, Knights of the old Republic, homecoming friends, Janna's birthday, Matt and Joe, all the girls I've ever liked, how Andrea is going out with Artem and how they lied to me, my family, my art, my comics; this is whats on my mind right now.

Why is it so easy for some people and so hard for me?"

or lack thereof

Will I ever get a girlfriend?
Some would say yes, it's part of life. It's bound to happen eventually, and I'm not denying that, but when? And how?

Janna has a friend she goes to EdCC with, the guy is 28 and he's never had a girlfriend. I mean, it's easy to say ""I'll easily have a girlfriend by 28, that so far away."" But in middleschool I always thought that'd I have a girlfriend by now. Of course I thought highschool would be just like it was on TV, stupid me. I always thought that I could give myself a little time and eventually I just find a good girl. Maybe I'm not a couragous as I thought. I just don't know if I can see myself with a girl at 28. I'll probably be one of those guys that's single until they're old.

Another example of the not-dating-until-they're old, is my newly found unlce, Eric. He's in his late 40's, maybe older, and he's just got a weird girlfriend that lives far away. And the really weird thing is, he's a lot like me, the guy loves Star Trek, old movies, dogs, and I don't know, he's just a lot like me. I can see myself turn into him, and sometimes that scares me. Plus, he had cancer and was raised by Mennonites, but other than those things, he's similar to me.

I always figured that one of my friends could hook me up, or one of my friends girlfriends; but I'm starting to think that won't happen. I guess there's never enough incentive or something. Or they try to hook me up with weird or odd looking friends. Maybe that's my problem, my standards are to high. But I don't think they're that high, as for looks, they don't have to be that attractive, just either be hot or cute, or something about them is attractive, cause most girls have some catch. I guess I'm not really into BIG girls, maybe my standards are to high. Ok, mental problem #1 discovered.

It's just hard seeing all of your good friends hook up and always feeling like the thrid wheel. I figured that Alex and I, or atleast Dane and mine's fates would be intertwined about girlfriends. None of us have ever been successful, but recently Dane and Alex have found themselves girls, while they may not be their first choices, they're girls none the less.

And all the other friends that are complaining about being single have had girlfriends in the past, they know how good it is and want it again. I HAVE NOTHING! FUCKING NOTHING! NO EXPERIENCE AND I'M FUCKING 18! I've got nothing really, only what my parents have given me. Nothing is truely mine. I feel pathetic when I think about it, everybody else has had and or has a girlfriend, why not me? What's wrong with me? I figured I'd attract someone by now with my cheezey humor or slight charm, maybe even looks, but I guess not.

But then it begs the question, do I really want one? Or is it just society and peer pressure telling me I need one? Half the time I'm perfectly happy with myself, the other half I'm depressingly lonely. But there's a little voice that tells me I need a girlfriend, and makes me feel bad when I don't have one. It almost wouldn't matter if I didn't have girlfriend if that voice was gone. Everybody says, that when I stop trying it will happen, but I think that if I stop trying, nothing will happen. I just can't stop, not matter how pointless my tries have been.

How did humans face 2.5 million years of evolution and reproduction if I can't even get a girlfriend. My grandpa was fighting the nazis at 18 and I can't even get a girlfriend.

Here's what I think the problems stem from:
-Bad timing mixed with lack of expierence
-High standards
-A slight fear of confrontation
-A fear of change
-The inability to understand flirting or ""hitting on""
-All around bad luck
-The Olson gene
-No friend support (most of them are as bad as I am, just luckier)

I think that when, if, I get a girlfriend, the situation will be completely unexpected and I will have little to know control over it. I'm a control freak who's bad with control, go figure. It will also be ironic in some way, and will conform to no situation I've ever planned for. In other words, love will most likely find me, not the other way around.

There are a million songs about love or how good love was, there is just one about how it stinks."

"event","Reality has hit me like a train hitting a worthless hobo. My parents layed out everything and how they feel about it. They talked about my job situation, they talked about my living situation, they talked about my church situation. It was quite possilby the worst conversation of my life and I deserved every word of it.

Lately I've found the fantasy/virtual world much more appealing than the real. I wasn't spending all my time on the computer or playing video games, although much of it was wasted there, but I had been spending all my time having fun with my friends, or prolonging the job situation. I escaped into the world of my friends, into my games, into the fun. I wasn't committed to getting a job. I didn't put in the effort. My mom will give me one last hope of becoming a clerk a local super market, if, when that fails, I will have to work for my dad at the car lot, cleaning cars for 40 hours a week. But I do need a job, badly.

My parents talked about how hard they work and how hard I don't work. It's true, I do jack shit and take advantage of what I have. And just by not asking my parents for money all the time I felt like I wasn't ""milking"" them or using them like ATMs. I still didn't appreciate all the work they've done for me, all the work they're still doing for me. My dad works really fucking hard for the family so I'll have a good life. And my mom does all the house wife shit that keeps the house running. And what do I do? I have fun with my friends. I'm horrible.

And I always convinced myself, when a huge confrontation like this happens, I'd always say to myself ""you're such a nice person, you don't deserve this."" But I do deserve ALL of this, every backwards comment, every fucking breathe. I am nice, on my own terms, I do nice things. But I've still been worthless. I've still used my parents. 

As they were talking to me, I tried to fight back. They were probably just trying to help me, but I felt under attack. I said everything I could think of. The truth is, I am pathetic. SO PATHETIC. I'm a control freak who has control over nothing. And I just tried to make them feel bad because that's all I could really do. I have no control, because I'm totally, 100% dependant on my parents. I wouldn't survive a second in the real world. I really have nothing of my own, and I don't think I'm willing to work for it yet either. I try to know everything, but what do I really know? My parents are the only thing keeping me alive. They hold all the strings, all the strings to my life.

I was such an asshole. The last two days have been hell and it's been a deserved hell. A personal hell.

I need to become less dependent on them."

"event","I took the biggest gamble of my life today. Lately I've been getting close to Andrea and I really like her. She seemed perfect to me; beautiful, she beat Brennan in Star Wars trivia (I was so turned on), she smart, laughs at my crappy jokes and most of all, she's one of the nicest people I've ever met. I asker her out.

I guess I didn't actually expect it to go well. I never would have. But I tried. I'm proud of myself for trying. But I was nervious, very nervious. I stumbled words, but I got my point accross and she understood what I was saying. But alas, it was not meant to be, not yet anyway. She claimed she wanted to get settled into college before she had a relationship, which sounded logicical to me, but at the same time broke my heart. She let me down as easy and as nicely as possible. I was crushed. And I continued to hang out with my friends to give the appearance that nothing was wrong, but I was quiet and sad, so I failed there too. 

All my friends are hooking up. Dane hooked up with Katie(shes not much of a catch, but as long as he's happy), Brennan's had Alex forever, Devon is with Shirley through some weird twist of fate, and Alex has his girl Amy. Seriously, out of my best friends, only Dash and my cousins are still single; Dash as physical and emotional issues to tackel and Matt n' Joe probably have the same girl issues as I do. I must be some Olson gene. As much as I can gather from comics my grandpa sketched (go figure, the old man and I have something in common) he felt the same way about my grandma, he eventually won her over though. I really love to talk to that man though, one on one, about life, but he's so crazy and stereotypically conservative.

I have this cycle that I go through with every girl that means something to me. I start out depressed and then I meet the girl. Through some twist of fates, I get to know her and start to develop a crush on her. It never happens over night, I like the person, not as much how they look. I start thinking she likes me back and I almost get to asking her out. I feel confident, but something bad happens, I fail some how and I return to that lovely original depression. But this time I actually made my move and it was horribly wrong. But at the same time I'm very glad I did.

I think the main reasons I'm upset are because I feel like I'll never have a girlfriend. I can't get one. I'm fucking 18 and I have no girls AT ALL to show for it. I'm SO lonely. And I liked her so much, she has no idea. I went through so much shit for her, for all the girls I've ever liked, and none of them will ever know. And I'm always helping people with their relationship problems. WHEN IS IT MY FUCKING TURN!? WHEN DO I GET A GOOD WOMAN?! Life's not fair, and I never get what I expect, at the cost of being cliche, ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get."" And it's not like I'm most guys, I don't want sex. Well some day I do, but it's not in the short term plans. I want a relationship, I want love, I want happiness and time well spent. All I have are fucking video games.

Last night I was so proud of my new found name ""Drew."" To make decsions different than I would normally, and I did. It's made me wiser. Maybe all this shit was for a reason. God is playing games with me."

I have to work all summer, full time. I'll make good money, but it was never about the money, well maybe a little bit. I need something to occupy that long time during summer when I'm bored, but 40 hour weeks are insane, that's what somebody works when they're supporting a family, so I guess more profit for me, but still, I'd rather have the free time. I'd be working under my cousin Nik, I don't know how I'd feel about that, he's pretty cool. 

The weirdest thing about my life right now it 'Age of Empires'. It's this super addicting RTS (Strategy) game that has super realistic medieval warfare. My friend, Dwayne, is usually good at it and I can't understand why, I guess he's the master tactician, not me. I always felt that I was a leader, a problem solver, but maybe Dwayne has one-upped me. I even had a nightmare about Dwayne killing me in 'Age'. Good thing all my friends are just as obsessed as me, I'm getting lots of practise. One day I'll beat that bastard.

Also, I'm starting to think that I'll never get a girlfriend. Every year I always told myself ""you'll get one next year"" or ""you're getting close to this girl"" but I was always lying to myself, or maybe I was just niave. I can't ever see myself getting a girlfriend, I can't see her face, I can't hear her voice, I can't smell her beatiful smell or get lost in her eyes, because see doesn't exist, and I'm not sure if she ever will, and that scares me. I think I'm a good catch, just unlucky, how long can bad luck last? I've lost that little bit of hope that kept me going. Maybe I should give up, but I don't know if I'd let myself."

"event","So I've been told on more than one ocasion by varios women the I'm attactive, or that a friend of friend thinks I'm hot, or just that I'm good looking. Also, many people, on daily basis', tell me I'm the nicest guy they've ever met. What the hell. So if girls think I'm super nice and good looking, why am I single? Aren't those the main thing girls look for in guys, hot and nice? You'd think I could maybe get some of the more shallow chicks, because I often have money, but NOTHING.

Here's my latest theory on my female issues. I'm good at talking to girls, I'm good at making them laugh and I can enjoy my time with them now. My problem is that I have no idea how to express that I like a girl, to that girl, or I'm just afraid or something. I also do NOT have the ability to comprehend if a girl likes me, no idea. Or I'm tease easy or something. Cause I think a girl likes me and then BAM! she's with another guy a week later. Maybe I'm too slow about the whole thing. 

This shouldn't be this hard. One of the most important parts of life is reproduction, or atleast the act of finding a mate. And humans have been around for 2 million years. You'd think we'd have perfected it by now, but NO, there's still millions of lonely men and women around the world."

"event","My mom has been freaking out cause I wouldn't let her get a picture of me on prom with my date. Truth is the whole frigging situation was a mess for me. So my family and I are on usually bad terms. We usually have pretty good Dez set me up with that weird girl, Nicole. Now, don't get me wrong, I feel good that atleast I went, but I seem to keep playing a whole lot of better situation in my mind, things that could have been, as if I had the ability to change what has happened.

My own dissappointment in the way prom turned out has resulted in embarassment when people ask me questions about it, more specifically my family. I know they love me and just want to know about me, but I'm a very private person and I don't let many people in, my family included. I just didn't like my date very much, but I still tried to be a gentlemen and be as nice as possible, just cause my prom was crappy, didn't mean I had to make her feel bad, it wasn't really her fault. She was kind of creepy and wore HEAVY make-up, and may have been a freshmen. She seem really interested in weird things like hobos, which see gave $21 dollars to, and a car crash that burned violently was the most beautiful thing she saw. But I did actually enjoy many aspects of prom.

I enjoyed the before and after a lot. We had dinner at Alicia's aunt and uncle's house, Josh Gamler cooked, and he was pretty good, good steak. I hung out with my friends and enjoyed myself. I also but on my tux and felt like a million bucks. Nicole tried to talk to me a few times, so she was trying, but I don't think it'd work. Alicia's a cute girl, I would have rather gone to prom with her, but she wanted to go with Jed, who, in all his class, wore torn shorts to prom that had one leg cow patterned with the black and white. And afterwards got high with Chao. Chao being Dez's stupid boyfriend. The guy's bi-polar, I don't want to up-set him. He wore BRIGHT yellow shoes to prom and got high with Jed. I think the only reason Dez is with him is because she thinks she can't do better, she could easy, I mean I liked her for a long time, poor girl, her parents are constatly grounding her, kind of like Brennan.

Speaking of Brennan, he obviously went to prom with his girlfriend Alex. But Alex set Dan up with her hot friend. I don't even think she know Dan that well. But she set him up with someone good, instead of me, even though I thought we were good friends, But whatever, not worth pissing off her or Brennan over something that's in the past.

The after party was pretty good. I had to take my date and Alicia's sister home, even though I didn't know them that well. I brought Keith to make the ride a bit more comfortable. I don't think Dez or Alicia trust me on highway after Rocky Horror. Keith wanted to go to the hotel where half my senior class, including Dash, was getting drunk and high. We went to Tony's and hung out until like 4:30am. I don't think I got drunk, but that's opinion.

Well now that prom is over I'm going to put all my power towards getting a job, a personal quest. When I have a job I'll have 1/2 of the things I REALLY need to do done, the second mission is to find a significant other, which I've almost given up on. I think I have a large amount of mental illness involving female relations. The only reason I haven't given up completely is because it's not in my nature, I'll always have hope about everything. It's what keeps me going.

Dez is setting me up with some girl, presummably a freshman, who wears weird make-up. And Dez wants to do a different thing than me at dinner. My mom said she'd get me a limo for my friends and I. Well I'm going, for better or worse. It seems to be on stressful mess. After prom I've decided to focus 100% on getting a job. It's should be all that matters, MY GOAL! 

Prom night, all my friends, who for various reason aren't going, are BBQ-ing. Yeah, most of my male friends aren't going, mainly cause they didn't have the balls to ask anyone, but neither did I really. Well I half-assed asked Andrea and Meredith, but that didnt work out. Now that I can go to prom, it's like I'd rather be with them, eating BBQ. Careful what you wish for, huh? That where I belong, with the geeks. I've always prided myself on being a nerd.

Speaking of which, my friends seems to be obsessed with outside activity, I find it boring quick. I'm getting up to hike at 8 am tomorrow! MORONS! As long as there's a girl and they're outside they're cool right? Morons. I hate and love them all."

I didn't miss them at all. And now that they've come back, it feels like they're all crawling back, but for them nothing has changed except the timezone. I've changed. It was only 5 days, but I've changed. I've become angrier towards them. They really did nothing, but I still feel abanndoned. 

I guess I had enough other friends to keep me busy. If I'd gone I would have missed my ill-fated, but first interview; giving blood, an eventful easter and getting a $177 driving ticket. Who can be sad about that? 

Now they all want to do something, but so do Tien or my cousins. Three different groups, they may not work together. Alex is going to David Bowie tonight. 

Tien was a crush from last summer and spring. I met her through my confirmation class on a retreat. I off and on liked her. Another miss opportunity. We actually spent a lot of time alone. I'm just a big stupid moron.

I feel sorry for both my cousins, Matt and Joe. They are very close brothers, but are almost opposites. I've always related better with Joe, but they both seem to have familiar qualities. Matt is what I imagine my dad like at the same age, just less misguided. His parents think he's perfect, perfect Olson kids.

Joe is weird, sometimes weirder than me. I think he's got a better work ethic and more loyality. Joe has a more open mind, but the poor kid walks in the shadow of his accidemically and athletically superior brother."

I feel like she was my last hope, I feel like not only prom, but any chance of a relationship in highschool is gone. Over. I am defeated. It almost feels like I'm made to suffer. My heart has no power.

I'm embarrassed to easily I guess.

I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to get a girl. Sure people say that you change in college, but what if I just keep those stupid reasons why I don't have girlfriend forever. I need someone that wants me back, someone that makes me first, someone that loves me the way I love them. Everybody thinks I'm nice, but I seem to be easily tossed aside. I long for those relationship problems that some of my friends have with thier girlfriends. 

And the worst part is that I think I'd be better with a girlfriend than my friends. They make dumb deciecions, I'd be totally head over heels in love. Hopefully not whipped, but who knows. I think I'm attactive and caring and smart at times, I just can't understand why all the girls I've liked can't return my affection. All the girls I like seem to move from guy to guy way to fast, I can barely keep track. Am I too nice, not aggressive?

Sometimes I wonder if the flaw is genetic or somehow introduced via my friends. It's a known fact that all Olson men have trouble with women, but the marriages all seem to last. It's good to know that if I ever get a girlfriend, or for Godsake a wife, then I could keep it together. But none of my close friends seem able to get girlfriends either? Coincidence that we all have no luck with the ladies or is there a reason?

Earlier this year I had a big crush on this girl named Sarah, she was kind of mysterious, I didn't seem to know a lot about her. She liked one of my best friends, Dane. But she lead me on, wanting to hang out alone and play video games. I guess Dane thought that her and him were almost girlfriend and boyfriend. One day she just cut off contact, No idea what happened. I saw her at the musical, but she avoided me.

Speaking of girls, prom is coming in little over a month. I don't really have a date yet. I got brave enough to talk to the girl I like about prom, and half ask her, but I don't think she gets the impression that I want to go with her. Or maybe she doesn't want to go with me and is too nice to tell me? The girl is Andrea, she's very cute and nice. She's going to SPU next year, which is only in Seattle, not far if I ever wanted to visit. *wink wink* I think I like nice girls, well mannered and atleast slightly religious. I hate slutty girls. Well for whatever reason, prom is still very ominous. I'm not sure if Dez thinks shes going with me in a group, but I want prom to be romantic, important for a relationship. Dez is still going out with that weirdo, Cho, spelled maybe Cao? I like Dez off and on most of this year, but I never told her because she always had some stupid boyfriend. They were all stupid and mean, but whatever. She has to make her own choices. There seems to be a lot of girls that move from guy to guy really quickly.

Me, I've been on dates, but I've never actually had a girlfriend. No one to keep me company or to be on my side of arguements; I've never been first for anyone. I've never been anyones favorite person. And I wonder, is it because I fear change or I can't see good opportunities. I think it's both, I'm just girl stupid. And all the girls tell me how nice I am, but I guess nice isn't what they really want. 

And I saw the musical last night. It was good and there were lots of friends in it. People were telling me all these fun stories about it and I wish I could go back and force myself to join it. I have no clue why I didn't. And they had they're cast party last night. Just once I would have liked to have gone to it. Once again I'd like to blame my fear of change and inability to see opportunity on not joining the musical. I hope they don't destroy me.

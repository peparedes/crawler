"event","This weekend was spent with Kathleen, she is awesome.  Words cannot decribe the time that me and her spent together this past weekend.  Well good times would work i guess.  But it was more than good times anyway, I myself have not had that much of a good time with a person from the female race in along time.  She makes me feel wanted and actually like a person.  So that was for you Kathleen, you really are the best thing in my life right now.  On another note work wasent so bad saturday, we were busy as hell, and of course qui didnt show up til about 1.  But on the brighter side of things i did make 12 hours worth of work, which helps out tremendously with my check.  The good times are flowing for me right now and I hope they continue to do so, im gonna knock on wood when im done with this lj entry.  Well im done so ""knock, knock""."

"event","Well im back in the general public now, after being locked in your house for a week you start actually wanting to go to work.  I feel a whole lot better, that damn pnemonia kicked my ass hardcore.  Well before I got this medicine im on.  Started back at work today, same ole shit really, i mean i had more work so thats always a plus.  Im dreading tomorrow, i start school and as most of us know i hate school, but im going in optimistic this time and wanting to pass and go to class especially since my dad is paying for it, so im lucky there.  Im not gonna let him down, dont wanna waste the old mans money.  I am contemplating on moving out of my house, i really hate living here now, soley because of my dumbass brother.  He bitches with my parents then they bitch at me, and he still does and gets what he wants.  If Anthony would get his stuff together, then we can hurry up the process of getting us an apartment, but i understand his situation so i guess a couple more months will be ok.  I myself dont have the funds at the moment.  I have four tickets to the monster truck show this saturday, its prolly gonna be me, chirs,dusty, and johnny but i havent decided yet, some bribes would be nice, i dont know something.  Haha na, j/k.  Well maybe i was just kidding.  Well thats really alli have right now.  So of course Im out."

Its saturday night and there is nothing to do.  Well there is a party that i was invited to but when i asked if i could bring some friends they said no theres already way to many people coming.  I find that so coincidental, and believe me i will remember that.  I mean who says there are already too many people coming?  Personally i think certain people just dont want to ""deal"" with us, which is also funny.  Really i could care less i just thought it was funny, so i posted it."

"event","I went to work today even though i didnt have too.  I stood around for 2 hours then finally got some work.  Easy work too, so it was all good, all and all I think i made about 5 hours at the most, and I left early.  After work I washed my car, its all shiny now hopefully it wont rain anytime soon.  I came home and then went and played in this poker tournament with some of my friends from highschool.  It was awsome, I was winning really good there for awhile, then lost most of it and finally was defeated.  All and all it was cool we were playing texas holdum so lots of up and downs ""swings are bitches""  is a good way to describe it.  I think im over the whole Nichole deal which is good i guess, although i still will confront her about it one day.  Wednesday Lord of The Rings 3 comes out, im gonna go that night, its gonna be the best.  Oh yeah its 15 days til christmas. So awsome the year has gone by so fast.  Sucks i think i wound up getting a damn cold.  Oh well im fightin the sombitch off.  LAter people."

All the family it was great, I really need that in this time in my life.  Today has been one of those lazy days where your so bored but yet you still dont wanna do anything.  I also think i have some kinda damn cold, sucks.  I havent talked to some of my friends in awhile i think they may hate me because of the whole situation with Nichole and possibly this live journal.  I want them to know i dont hate them.  Im out"

"event","Well today was a better day, although i feel like i may be getting a cold.  This is my new beginning i guess, with all the other stuff behind me for the moment.  I would just like to say that my last entry may have been harsh but i meant every word of it, and if you dont like it oh well.  I actually had some work today, which was a plus, a very good plus.  The only bad part of my day was when i got my check from last weeks pay period, $81.61 yes thats a paycheck!  I worked three days and only made that much now you can see why i was complaining on the last journal entry.  I talked to Randall today a friend of mine who did not care to much for the last lj, but he agreed with me in some instances.  Me and him are on cool terms, but i would like to also express that it will probably be awhile before i make an appearance in that social group of friends, but then again you never know.  Tonight was a good night i hung out with Chris, Dusty, and Johnny, all very good friends.  We all had a good time, goofying around, at the outlet mall, then at Johnnys pizza.  THere pizza is good, but their service sucks ass.  I mean we were in there and they made us go and pay before we were done.  Then they started playing this gay emo music and were talking under their breath saying "" i hope it dosent offend them"".  Its just one of those places where you bare the bad service for the good food.  Dusty went home after that.  Later me, Chris, and Johnny went bowling.  I owned them, we will just leave it at that.  It was so weird i felt like i was in highschool again, everywhere you looked their were 15 year olds, just sick.  Good Night to all."

"event","This month has been hell.  I dont expect sympathy or anything like that, im just venting it all out one good time.  It starts off with work, wow generally work means http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=work, see definition.  Well I have been doing the complete opposite of that.  Which equals Alex makes no money, which really fucking sucks.  I mean yeah i will get the occasional used car or the dreaded oil change, no pdi's, and definetly no gravy work.  So this has been like this all month.  We will proceed with:  I liked a girl and I thought she liked me but boy was I wrong.  Me and Nichole dated for a good two months and it was great until the day she went out with a friend of mine (Jason), and yes that sounds harmless, and im sure it was but damn friends just dont need to fucking do that.  This happend at the beginning of this month, so i freaked out naturally.  Me and her have now been fighting since then and she has once again done the samething with that same person on more than one occasion, when i thought me and her had something.  I did tell this girl that I wanted a relationship with her and she said she didnt want one, so i accepted that, yes it was hard but i did.  She tells me we can be the same, do the same things we have been doing, and does that happen, abosolutely not.  She dosent even look at me the same, and its so apparent, but i try and make it work.  My weakness is that im too nice if you cant already tell that.  So yesterday we hang out in the morning i go to school take a final, then go back to her house.  She wont look at me, or be straight with me, so i get her to spit out what she had to say.  She said she wanted to end what we had which has basically been non-exsistant since the day she thought it would be cool to go off with the friend.  She says she dosent want to hurt me anymore.  I agreed with her, didnt go out without a fight but agreed with her.  So now we are supposedly friends, but i dont know how thats gonna work.  Then i hear some bad news today at work from another friend of mine who is watching out for me.  He tells me that he was talking to her best friend and he told my friend that Nichole sought out Jason because she was aggravated with me.  The friend then went on to say that Jason agreed to do it because he wanted a good laugh because he knew how much i really did like her.  So fuck both of them she lied to me and so did he.  The past three weeks have been nothing but lies, and i have been brought so down , because i really did like her and she does this.  Why? I dont fucking deserve that, and i just can believe they would do that.  And its quite apparent that eveyone else knew about it and just didnt bother to tell me so fuck them too.  Yes this will take some time to get over but damn u would feel the same fucking way, if this kinda unessesary shit happened to you.  Nichole you could have just told me, but instead you did that, thats not cool.  You deserve what comes to you.  And as for when you said well when im ready for a relationship i will come to you.  Was that true?  And if it was do you actually think i would consider it now.  Im done with that moving on my house got robbed last sunday as Dusty pointed out in his lj.  So now im kinda scared to be in my house.  I mean its pretty bad when my dad is having to show me where his pistol is and how to use it.  What a lovely fucking christmas."

"event","So, I'm posting a meme Lorrie had. 
Don't expect this to be a regular occurance. I'm not really a livejourally person most of the time. This is a rare time.

"event","Wow.
I really have been letting this journal go. 
Yet, here I am.

Well then, I am in school now. It is something to look forward to. Work is still a knife in my side sometimes though. For example, today I leave school at 5:00 PM. (I am in the Learning Resources Centre at Centre for the Arts campus right now.) I must proceed from school to home for a quick changing of clothes and then strut off to work to be there by at least five minutes before 6:00 PM. How appealing is that? I woke up at 6:40 AM this morning after a night of nearly no sleep, and I have to stay awake until midnight. Sighlands indeedland!!!

Indeed, school is interesting and enjoyable. I am somewhat worried about my research class, PROW-114: Consider the Source. I feel somewhat lost in this class. Currently, I am in a group with two other women to complete a critical analysis project on an article or book concerning a specific topic. The two other women are much older, and most likely smarter, then me. I feel quite intimidated. I also feel like I don't completely understand the project we are trying to complete. I want to be a valuble part of the work, but I'm not sure how it should be done. Sigh...maybe the emails back and forth between us will help me. 

Scottland is doing well at his work I believe. He is cuteland and my loveland. I love you Scottland! ------l-----<3

Shasta is bazooed by all this coming and going that both me and my Scottland are doing now. She thinks it is weird that I go to school. 

I wish we had a bigger living area and a yard of some sort for kittypoo. She would love to have a yard to play and smell everything in. Of course, I don't think I can contribute much at all to rents or mortgages until I have some kind of decent job that pays (hopefully) much more than $6.75 per hour.

Scottland and I might go shopping this weekend at Roots because of the aquisition of a coupon and a gift certificate. I'd love to go shopping. I have not shopped for clothes for some time. Scottland needs pants and underwear; I need pants and sweaters/long-sleeved shirts of some kind.

Scottland asked his Mom for a vacuum cleaner either for his birthday or Christmas. What a gift! Ha! Oh well! We need it because our current vacuum device likes to barf out lots of dust. 

My parents have a cute new puppy and my Dad's blood is back to normal platelet levels. Now, my Dad can take the military medical exam again, and pass!!!

I should probably go to some constructive school work of some sort. 
Meow meow meow..."

"event","The day we took Lady to the vet to be put down, I thought I wasn't going to cry. I was mad at myself because I couldn't cry. But, when it all started happening, my eyeballs blew up with tears and my nose started oozing snot. I was surprised. I didn't cry the day we took Chicken. I cried much much much more later. I suppose I will this time as well. I am kind of scared of going to see my parents now that Lady won't be at the house anymore. It is really hard because she seemed so happy to see us, and was so excited when we took her for walks these past months. Her illness didn't make any sense. I really hope she is with our other animals in some place warm and wild with nature. I really miss all of the pets I've ever had. 
At work on Tuesday, the day after she went away, I was very much sad. I thought about her all day long. She was so good. 

Scottland is very tired for some reason. It may be that he overslept today with me, or that workland is extremely stressful. He also has this terrible canker sore that insists on staying put. I can't remember having canker sores that bad. 

I wish I could find a bunch of money to put in the bank and save for school. I am worried about moneylands. Money is so annoying.

I bought my Dad a Father's Day gift and a gift for his birthday today. I am unsure he will really like them. Buying gifts is really difficult sometimes...all the time actually. Blarg...

I've experienced much sore throat, sore muscles everywhere especially in the neck and back, stuffed up nose, sore ears, extreme tiredness, and a constant flow of green and yellow mucous mixed with blood, and sometimes giant fleshy clots of blood. I haven't gone to work for three days now. Sigh...

Besides being sick, there have been other things to classify this week as hell. I don't want to write about them though. Not for all to see.

I love Scottland so much. I want to be with him forever. I want everything that might prevent that to go away and never come back. I want everything that might prevent us being together to be non-existant, gone.

I have to work 5:00 PM to 1:00 AM tonight. Blargins!!! My boss said it would only be this week and the occasional time that I would have to work nights. Sigh. It complicates things with my life with Scottland. 

Scottland was very sleepy this morning. He should go to sleep when he gets home after buying some chows for kittypoo. He looks so adorable when he is sleeping. It reminds me of a little caticus. I am tempted to jump all over him and hug him furiously, but of course hold myself back to not wake him. It seems he sleeps a lot better than I do. I have always taken longer than the rest of my family and friends to get to sleep. It is annoying sometimes, but also a little neat as I get to see what Scottland looks like when he sleeps. Sometimes Shastaland likes to stay up with me, trying to get me to play with her. Other times, she just wants to sleep at the same time as Scottland. 

Our vacation is mostly settled. We are going to Calgary for 3 days, Banff for 2, Revelstoke for 1, and Kelowna for approximately 4 days. We may or may not stay somewhere else on the way back to Edmonton. I hope for much fun times!

There was freezing rain last night when Scottland and I went to see ""Hellboy"" at South Edmonton Common. I hope it does not snow again. Cold winds and air, please go away and wait for next winter to spread your wrath.

Scottland and I see so many movies in short time frames. In the past 2 weeks or so we have seen ""Man On Fire"", ""The Punisher"", ""Mean Girls"", and ""Hellboy"". Sigh, we enjoy movies at the theatre almost too much."

I really miss things from the past. But, I can't go back because everything is different and I want my Scottland with me all the time. Apparently I am really young. I feel old though, as if I've been away for years. I don't feel like my life is just starting. I feel like I am always near an end, or that the open abyss in front of me is too far down, is too frightning. I know that going back to the military will probably be a good thing for my Dad and Mom, but I really don't want them to move away. I don't know if I will every be completely happy for longer than an hour or so. It is so stupid sounding. I feel really stupid. For a long time now, I've felt that I am going to die soon. What is it? What is wrong with me?
There are so many good things. I feel like they are all going to go away. We're so weak.

"event","Sometimes this livejournal feels more like a burden than an outlet. Isn't that stupid?
I feel as though I am never going to be free of this apparent chemical imbalance and these emotional mental problems of mine. I probably never will be. I sometimes do not take my anti-depressant pill at the same time every day. The results are disturbing to me. This morning, I did not take my pill at the same time as my bc pill. Yesterday, I did though. Consequently, between the time I took my birth control and finally took my antidepressant pill, I experienced the usual horrible bout of nightmares as I slept. Everytime I don't take my pill within twenty-four hours of my last dose, I experience this. I find this in itself depressing. I hate knowing that, because of a pill, I am spared having to suffer nightmares. 
It also seems that I am too sensitive to everything Scottland says. Everything he says is under my emotional scrutiny. I can't help it. I wish he wasn't looking over me reading this right now. It would be much better if he would just read it after I am done typing. 
I'm never going to be ""normal"" like other people. I just can't find anyone who has the same problems as I that I can really get any help from. Everyone is all alone in their problems. 
Scottland is a huge bum. He figures he'll get some work done at home so he can come home earlier tomorrow. In reality, he'll be a work just as long. I hate it.

I've thought that maybe Scottland and I should try other physical activites, recreation things all the time to keep life interesting. I don't know if he'd do it. Some things are a hassle to him for some reason.

Scottland and I just aren't having fun lately. Maybe just not as much. I've had a sickness of some influenza sort all week. The muscle pains and bowel problems have ceased, but I now am stricken with an annoying dull soreness of throat. 

I've been depressed today, wondering the stores in City Centre with no purpose. I can't seem to find anything I really really like anymore. It's all gone. 

I saw Karen walking down 102 avenue today. She was carrying a lot as usual. She ignored me. I know she noticed me though, as she looked back and stared at me without being direct. I was going to say hello, but the words didn't come out. It is quite obvious she does not wish to talk. Sigh.

I saw my bald sister at city centre by her work. She was with her friends on break. She's so uplifted in person. I can't do that. 

Scottland wanted me to be happier looking today. I can't pretend things. He asked me what he could do to make everything better. I just have no idea. 

I wanted to go for a walk or do something interesting. Interesting being introducing Shasta to other cats, but Scottland surprised me immensely by declaring he thought I was just joking all along about this subject. I had no idea my dreams and wishes were so fantastic or ""out of the question"" to others, especially him. What the hell is so bad about bringing my parent's cat over to the apartment for a bit to see how Shasta interacts with other cats? Scott thinks it would be ""disruptive"" to their lives. He's so weird. What does he think cats are? Weak injured seniors who will die if they are moved? I am just asking for them to be together in the same house for a day or a few hours. I don't understand what the big deal is. I don't understand what the big deal is with a lot of things when it comes to Scottland. For instance, what is so damn outrageous about going outside the city for the night to see the countyside when there is no work or commitments the next day? What the hell is the problem with going for a walk at night in a forest? Oh my God...the trees are going to eat me. I sure hope the troll people don't come out, they like to sit on people. Scottland's adversity to simple interesting peaceful beautiful things really bothers me sometimes. I wish he was more adventurous.  

Sometimes I have ideas of something different for us to do together, but Scottland continues to be uninterested. I don't know what to do. I love Scottland. I wish we were having more fun. I don't consider fun to just be sleeping, eating, drinking, and watching movies. 

I'm bored and depressed when Scottland isn't around because I want to do things with him, but when he is here, we seem to get like this a lot. Sigh..........


I want Scottland to tell me all the things he wants to do with me. I want him to take me seriously when I suggest things. Sigh....I don't know what else to type right now."

I'm hoping the chamomile tea I am drinking will let me sleep a little. Sighlands Ahoy!

I was supposed to see my sister on Saturday, but for some reason it did not occur. I phoned her at 9:00 AM in the morning, there were four rings, and then the answering machine came on. I was going to call her again, but I just ended up falling asleep very quickly. I don't understand why she didn't phone me. Sigh, I guess I will just have to wait for another day to see Lorrie. 

I worked 4:00 PM to 11:00 PM at work on Saturday. Stupid scheduling!

I really hope everything goes really smoothly today at work, and otherwise. I need it to. Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Scottland so easily falls asleep. I envy him for that. He is a cute Scottland. 

I haven't seen my parents in a while it seems. This past week seemed really busy. My Dad came into my work to eat earlier in the week, and unfortuneately it was extremely busy. He asked me if I was going to be on break soon, and I of course had to reply with ""no"". I was very disappointed that the lunch rush did not end quickly enough because when my Dad was done eating, I still could not go on break, and he had to go back to work. It made me feel really sad. I really wanted to go eat and talk with my Dad. 

Dad, if you read this, my schedule for next week is like this:
Monday, April 5: 10:30 AM till 7:00 PM break: probably around 1:30 PM
Tuesday, April 6: 11:30 AM till 4:00 PM  NO break
Wednesday, April 7: 11:30 AM till 4:00 PM NO break
Thursday, April 8: not working as of yet
Friday, April 9: not working as of yet
Saturday, April 10: not working for sure
Sunday, April 11: 7:30 AM till 4:00 PM  break: probably at 9:30 to 9:45 AM

Scottland and I plan on going to Calgary, Revelstoke or Salmon Arm, Banff, and Jasper this summer on our vacation time. We haven't got it all worked out yet. I am really hopeful that we have a wonderful time. I am highly anticipating being in such nice wilderness and on vacation with my Loveland.

I am cleaning laundry right now and listening to music. I had just washed the dishes and had a shower. Shasta is hungry again of course, and meows occasionally at me. She is a wonder cat. 

Scott and I are attending the Juno Awards on April 4th at Rexall Place. It should be a great night with great performances, besides the fact that I have to work during the day for eight straight hours. 

The spring is slowly shining in. I have been sneezing a lot for quite some time now, and have conjestion and coughing. I know that a lot of it must be because of allergies. I am worried though that today I inhaled too much Spic and Spam cleaning solution when I had to spray it constantly to properly complete my extra cleaning for the day. Ever since the scary inspector came by a week or so ago, the manager has made an extra cleaning list for every day so that the whole place is very clean, even though most of these areas we clean are not that important. It is all for the best I suppose. I hate Spic and Spam. YUK!

Today I wrote the aptitude test to get into the Bachelor of Applied Communications in Professional Writing again. This year, I took it at the Jasper Place campus. I dislike the area that the school is in, but the school itself is neat looking inside and out to me. It reminds me of one of my High Schools, J. Percy Page. Some people might find it weird that I remember that school with any amount of fondness. Mostly, it was a good experience for me, but maybe not for others I know. Anyhow, the aptitude test was the same as the one I wrote last year. I wonder if my writing on it is almost exactly the same as the writing I submitted last year. I think it is odd that they do not change the test from year to year. I guess it might just be what a lot of the people there thought, just sort of a simple test to see if everyone who applied to the program is serious about it. I hope I did good. While there, I became a kind of celebrity amoungst all the other people because I had already taken the test previously. I talked very much more to other people than I usually undertake today. I even started talking quite continuously about my job at Wendy's and my cat. Strange for me indeed to be striking up conversations with strangers. 

After writing the test I went to the Dairy Queen right west of the campus. It is a very old location, and smelt really funny. It reminded me of some of the old beat up restaurants I have been to in small towns while on vacation in British Columbia with my family. Brown interior, old pukey coloured seats, ancient cash registers, and only two people working there. It took quite a while for everyone's orders to be received because of this. I found it odd that the restaurant still used the old system of giving you a number that they call when your food is ready. I don't know. Maybe a lot of food places are still like that, but I am so used to the Wendy's way....LOL. At the DQ, I decided to have some dipped ice cream to get some change for the bus back home. It was very delicious. 

After getting off the bus at 109 street and Jasper Avenue, I went to the Save On Foods and bought some Tokyo Express sushi. I brought it home and enjoyed it while Shasta sat by me wondering if she could have some. Silly kitty!

Now I am just waiting for Scottland to arrive home. I think the day has been quite good so far. It should only get better.

Other than the events of the day, some strange news has occured in my family. My Dad is planning on joining the military again, in particular, the navy. He wants a vast change in his life, some adventure maybe. My parents also want more security about their future. The crane business just isn't giving them that. It was slightly shocking news to me as I didn't even know a person my Dad's age could join the army, and if he does in fact get into the navy, my family will have to move far far away in Nova Scotia or Vancouver Island. I went the other day with my Dad to a downtown building where he obtained his High School transcript, which is one of the things he has to submit whilst applying to the army. Overall, I just want my parents to be happy and secure. Therefore, if joining the army is going to do that for them, I wish and hope them the best. I will miss them if this all happens. I will want to visit them with my Scottland. Weirdness, weirdness ahoy!!!

I wonder what Lorrie thinks of all this. She has a lot on her plate of course with this shitty migraine curse. Blarg...if I had them all the time I think I would go live in an underground hole and never come out. Sigh...

Signing off....do do..."

"event","I tried playing with Shasta today to help her be less bored, but she didn't seem very enthusiastic. She slightly runs for the ball, but then stops and becomes disinterested. She looks at me like, ""The ball was not thrown far enough"" or ""The ball and these walls around me are boring to me now."" I hope she won't be as restless and bothersome this coming sleeping night and morning anyway. 

I went to eat lunch at my work today. It was my day off. I think I would have been better going elsewhere, as my manager was on his break, and he decided he needed to speak to me. He is thinking very seriously of keeping the store open till 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM, which might require me to work the late shift. Aiya!!!!! I wish I could just work 11:30 am to 8:00 pm Monday to Friday, or 10:30 am to 7:00 pm Monday to Friday. That would be perfect. Sigh...and bum...and poo!!!

After eating lunch, I swiftly walked to the Save-On Foods for a few needed groceries. I bought oranges, tomatoes, bread, fish sticks, cheese, milk, and for a treat, apple strudels. Scottland needs some groceries too. We are out of ketchup, crackers, cookies, and juice. We are almost out of fries and burgers. On noeses!!!

Scottland just phoned. He needs to do another meeting at work, and than he'll be coming home. Of course, he is theoretically supposed to be on his way home now, as it is 9:00 PM. He worked 1:00 PM to 9:00 PM today. Sighlands againest!

Tomorrow, I start work at 7:00 AM. Yikes indeed. I really hope it isn't a huge bother to me. I hope it turns out to not be troublesome at all. I want more hours, and if this is what I need to work to get them, then so be it. I am going to do my best. I better do my best anyway, or I will be sighing indeed. 

I am a sigher. 

Daydreams of soft warm summer days with Scottland are in my head. There is so much wilderness for us to explore. I am so anxious for it all. Seeing new wild places will seem so much more exciting in my dreams when Scottland is there with me. This spring and summer, I hope Scottland and I go to many natural beautiful places. 

Kitty-poo just woke up from her slumber under the kitten blanket on the couch. I'm taking that as my cue to leave this post now."

"event","Shasta has gone insane. She has been constantly meowing and scracthing the walls to get our attention while we are trying to sleep. She slightly quieted down when I opened the blinds to let the light in this morning, but still was not satisfied even though Scottland had already fed her. It has become very annoying because we cannot sleep with her crazy behaviour. We think she is just very very bored.

I have been feeling very worrisome and insecure for so long. It's never going to end I guess. 

I want to be with Scottland forever. We argue a lot about stupid things that for some reason really do bother us at the particular arguing moment. 

I want to go out walking much much more, but it is difficult as Scottland does not feel the same way, and I don't want to go walking alone. I wouldn't feel so lonely or afraid of walking alone if I had a dog to walk with or we didn't live in downtown. I know it sounds like I'm saying it would be better for me to go back home and live there, but in my mind, that is out of the question. The truth is that living with Scottland is better than living at my parent's with the ability to have dogs to go out walking with in a neighbourhood ravine. I wish that Scottland was more adventureous. He has been at several points in our relationship, so I know it is not impossible. I just wish he was like that more often. He said that to him, walking in a park or quieter area at night is scary compared to walking around downtown. But to me, walking downtown is much much more frightening than a nice park type area. I love the trees, plants, water, and quiet of parks or wilderness. I could walk in the same park for my whole life, and still enjoy it muchly. Yet, I cannot continue to walk around the same buildings and city things all the time, and still enjoy it the same way. Those things get boring to me after a while. 

I've got to have a shower now before I go to work. 
I love you Scottland. -------l----<3"

"event","Ever since I started taking the 60 mg Celexa pills, I've noticed that my crazy annoying scary dreams have gone away, until now. I'm still on the pills, and taking them at the same time every day, yet I have begun to have these horrid dreams again. Sigh...
The past two or three nights, my dreams have been especially strange since in the dreams, I am dreaming as well, and trying to wake up from a dream within a dream. I'm dreaming that I'm dreaming. Aiya!!! Also, my disturbing dreams continue to contain lots of events in which Scottland is gone, not there, as if I somehow lost him. When I wake up entirely, I am so happy and glad to see that he is beside me on the bed. When I am having the dreams though, I feel so much struggle just to get out of them. It feels like I'm stuck doing the same things over and over again. 

Besides my insane dreams, Shasta has managed to keep her collar on for a long while now today. For some reason, in the past, she was extremely resistant to it, and somehow got the collar off. I can't seem to get her tag on the collar though. I was never good at putting tags or keys on to collars or chains. Stupid metal doesn't want to cooperate!

I bought Scottland some Valentine's Day gifts yesterday. I hope he enjoys them. Finding gifts is fun, but difficult.

I sent my portfolio by mail to Grant MacEwan this year. I really like it better that way. Nice and neatly it is printed on paper. 

Scott and I might go bowling again tonight. I really think we should go bowling a lot more often. It is an exercise, maybe not the best, but we like it. 

I'm probably going to start working at 7:00 AM every day I work now. I asked my manager for more hours, but not to work till midnight. He asked if I'd like to start with all the morning preperations for opening. I think I might enjoy it. I know I'll probably dislike quite quickly having to wake up that early, but I need more money. I want the nights for Scottland and I. 

Now, waiting for Scottland to come home..."

"event","I went to my yearly dentist appointment today, and it turns out that I have good teeth yet again. Yay! This is good news indeed. I thought that maybe something was wrong with my jaw considering this whole clicking or popping sound I experience. But, the dentist said that if it doesn't hurt, then there really isn't anything to do about it. He says my x-rays and my teeth themselves look great. Also, bumping my tooth on Scottland's head months ago does not seem to have created any permenant damage. I managed to keep the berry flavoured floride in my mouth for a minute this time. I remember not being able to other years. I would puke it out in disgust. No matter what flavour they make it, I swear they will never make it tasty. Of course this is good in a great way because it is not advisible to swallow floride. 

Scott is currently under my kitten blanket on the couch pretending to be a cat. Shasta is beside me on the desk under the lamp. She loves that lamp. 

Sigh, I don't know what else to type. I thought I would think of more. 

I finally bought a nice picture frame for a picture of Scott and I that was taken in September. Scott and I went Ikea shopping the other day, and I chose a nice beachy-tan coloured frame. Scott bought another matching night table, a new front door mat/carpet, new drinking glasses, and a heart shaped ice making tray. I like shopping with Scottland...lol.

I feel like the sides of my hips and my belly by my hips is getting bigger, but I am not sure. All my pants still fit the same as ever. Sigh...

Scott and I went bowling this night at Bonnie Doon Mall. It is five pin bowling there. It was quite fun indeed. We played three games. We tied the first. Then I won the second, and Scott won the last. I'd say we are both probably at the same level. I think Scott is more relaxed though. Our names on the bowling computer monitor were Valerieland and Scottland. Funtown! 
Before bowling, we ate a good dinner at Tony Roma's, which is also in Bonnie Doon Mall. After bowling, we proceeded to the Video Station on 104th Avenue to rent 4 movies as they have a rent 2, get 2 free special on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 

Scott's car is still being crazy. A connection to the battery is either very loose, or just plain broken. Scott is thinking it is just insanely loose because the car is still working. All we've had to do is open the hood and give the connection a little jiggle and the car starts up. Weirdness indeed! Scott's Dad is coming over tomorrow afternoon to take a look at fixing it. 

I am going to ask for more hours at work. I hope that they can just get me working earlier in the day, or just till 8:00 PM on weekdays, but not on the weekends. I like having Saturday's off and being able to go to Scott's parents' house on Sunday for supper. 

I went to the eyeball doctor to get a new prescription. According to him, my prescription hasn't changed that much at all. He says it is nothing to worry about. To me though, for a while now, my eyes have felt strained and tired and farther things have seemed fuzzy. I wonder if it is just stress. I will be getting new glasses anyway because the new prescription is sharper. I want new glasses anyhow. 

My dentist appointment is on Tuesday February 3rd. I shall inquire as to my strange jaw popping problem. 

My appliction for Grant MacEwan went through and it is now time for me to send in a portfolio for the second time. I hope it is as simple as it was last year. I also hope that nothing comes up these coming months that makes me question whether or not I should go to school this coming September. Lorrie has applied at the University of Alberta and I really hope everything works out for her. It sounds really wonderful.

I guess I'll go now and continue sipping my Big Rock Grasshopper beer."

"event","Overnight, it is said that it will drop to -39 degrees celcius. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! Right now, the windchill is making it feel like -43 degrees celcius out there. Yikes! Our weather is beyond bizarre. One day the snow is all melting and no one even has to wear a coat, next it is freezing rain that causes cars to turn into ice blocks, then a long comes the insane -40 degree celcius weather which causes eyebrows and eyelashes to freeze. If you are out for too long, your arms and legs won't move, and the snot in your nose will turn into ice. Thankfully, I had a nice sweater to wear today whilst working the drive-thru at Wendy's. People are nuts!
On last Saturday, Scott and I picked up my sister to go to the Pet Expo at the Sportex in Northlands. First, we went to Southgate mall so Lorrie could pick up her repaired engagement ring. It was all new and shiny again. Next, we headed over to the Pet Expo. We had hoped to park as near as possible to Northlands, but the road was all backed up with cars as there may have been some sort of accident on the proceeding bridge, or there was just too much traffic. Therefore, Scott had to drive a few blocks away to a residential area. We parked near a ""Joy Ho Chinese Centre"", and then walked in the bitter cold (which wasn't -33 degrees celcius yet though) to Northlands. At first, I had thought the Expo was in the Northlands Agricom. But, after being unable to locate its whereabouts in the Agricom, I was worried I had gone crazy and there really was no Pet Expo. Fortuneatly, we were merely mistaken of the exact location. It was at the Sportex building just across from the Agricom. After getting there, we embarked on our quest to find cuteness and fur. There were mostly dogs being shown, and different types of products for pets. There was a camel, and two black bears who you could ride, or get your picture taken with. Strange indeed! There was a petting zoo there which contained many rabbits, sheep, goats, chickens, other birds, and guinea pigs. Lorrie informed me that the particular petting zoo had visited Convergys sometime before. The animals were very temperate, soft, and cute. We saw the biggest dogs we've ever seen at the Mastif display. The one adult we saw was over 220 pounds. If our Akita Nova ever saw a Mastif, she should best not display and anger or dominant behaviour, as those dogs are much much larger and I think stronger than her. Nova would have a hard time submitting to any dog though I believe. There was a pony and a type of horse there as well. One didn't mind being touched, the other was somewhat weary of it. I felt like adopted one of the retired greyhound racing dogs. Of the few cats at the Expo, there was a Maine Coon, which is indeed a larger cat than most. It's muscle and bone structure is much bigger than that of a cat like Shasta. It was also very furry. He was resting at the time. He was in a cage with a bunch of other furry cats. Two were persians, and the other two were calicos, but the woman was unsure of their breed. Overall, I really enjoyed going with my Loveland and my sister to see all the wonderful petlands. I do wish that they had more cats though.
At present, I am waiting for Scott to arrive home, as it occured that his car decided not to start in the city centre parkade. He called his Dad for help. His Dad I hope is there by now. Crazy cars and crazy weather!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!"

Every morning, if she hears the alarm, and we don't immediately rush to the kitchen to bless her dish with glorious food, she starts randomly meowing and scratching on annoying sounding things. Everytime we come home from somewhere, she whines and complains if we don't go feed her. She sounds so desperate when she meows for food. It is as if she feels she will die if she is not a huge fat cat. The veternarian said we have to try to make her lose weight. She is the biggest whining cat I have ever known. 
My sister was planning on coming to see me after work today, but most likely will be unable to because of lack of sleep. Sigh... I really got excited when she asked if we could do something today. I wanted her to come over, see my work and the cat. It is FUN! Sigh and poo!

I was on back cashier for drive thru. I tried my best today. It was not as pressuring as I thought it would be. The last time this Wade guy did the inspection, he ordered something through the drive-thru I guess as a test. I remember almost mumbling incohearently to him. I am not sure if I made sense or not. I guess I still keep the back room really clean. 
I find talking about my job at Wendy's in this manner to be strange. I just keep on thinking about society's stereotype that my job I have right now is a dead-end useless job. Therefore, a part of me finds it silly that I talk about it like it is important. But it is, because I need money. I also don't think it is useless.

Scott and I saw the movie ""21 Grams"" last night at City Center. It was really depressing, but of course very well done. It was seperated in all different parts not in chronological order, but I believe I was able to place them all easily. 
Scott and I phoned Boston Pizza for delivery today, and discovered much to our horror that they no longer deliver Steak Sandwiches and Taco Salads, which are exactly the two items we were drooling for. We asked why they were unable to deliver said food items, and it has come to pass from Boston Pizza's head office that the delivery of these items diminishes their quality substantially enough that they have been stricken from the delivery menu. Sigh. I never thought of the quality as bad. I guess they had a lot of complaints from people who obviously have sticks up their bums. Some people are just too picky. Haha!!
The blanket that my Mom bought me for Christmas that has 5 orange kittens on it now always lays on the couch here. Shasta has taken a liking for going under it.

Scott informed me today that his superiors at work have deemed it necessary to rid him of his reliable and extremely helpful laptop computer. It really doesn't make any sense at this point. As I understood it, he very much required the use of it. I hope he gets it back at some point. The pooheads will porbably give it to someone who won't even have a real use for it. Dorks!

I don't want to spend money on something that doesn't work. I should not say that it doesn't work at all, it did seem to temper my insomnia, but that is it. I was hoping I would feel less sad and depressed. I still think about death all the time. I don't want to kill myself, but I still think about death. I am scared to die. I think about it so much, and I cry. I think about what would happen if certain people in my life died. I think about how horrible it would be. I think about what would occur if I was dying or died suddenly. I cry. I think about it constantly. Every night I believe it passes through my thoughts at least once, and it appears very often in my dreams as well. I want to change the past a lot. I know that it is ignorant of me to want that.

I want to still see my parents often. I want Scottland to come with me when he isn't working. I want to be all together.

I have a huge amount of things to be thankful for in my life. I am very lucky. Yet, I am so often filled with depressive thoughts and nightmares. I so often feel an underlying sadness. It is so stupid.
Scott and I had a strange burst of emotion and anger tonight in the car. I told him something that Anne (my cousin) had advised me on that I have been thinking of telling him for a while. It made him very angry. I didn't actually think he would be. It surprised me. It felt like my heart, or something inside, was falling apart. Everytime something very upsetting happens in my life, something inside of me feels like it is breaking apart. I was crying intensely. I felt ashamed. I thought horrible things like ""Oh dear God, this is the end isn't it?"" Yet of course, it was not. Scott was only angry, not dying or thinking about breaking up with me. My mind is always assuming the worst. He comforted me and held me. I just wish it never happened because I can't seem to forget the sadness it made me have. I can't forget the sadness of so many things. I'm an emotional bomb. Continued...I have to go to the bathroom."

"event","So, as Scott and I did last year, we spent New Year's Eve mostly at home. I did convince Scottland to go out of the city where it was quiet for a little drive. I was hoping it would not have been cloudy. But, sigh, it was very very cloudy and snowy. We had a good time nonetheless though. Scottland had some beer, and I had a homemade malibu pineapple. We watched ""The Sorpranos"" for some time last night before going to sleep. I really enjoy that show. We slept in till 4:30ish PMland, and then shortly proceeded to the nearest open Wendy's for some delicious supper. 
Last night, a strange delivery was made to Scottland's front door. Apparently, his address was given as the one for a ""Anne Wilson"" who delivers ""The Edmonton Sun"" newspaper. Therefore, a pile of the newspapers was delivered to Scottland so that ""Anne"" could distribute them. We should phone the company that is in charge of it and get this weirdness sorted out. Shastaland is cuteland..."

Cats are cuteland, especially Shastaland Catland Loveland!

Scott and I are burning his ""money"" candle right now. It supposedly contains an amount of money inside of some protective thing. It could be up to one hundred. Weirdlands!

Scottland is sitting over at his desk clicking away on his work lap top. He was smelling and nibbling on the hairs on his right arm as usually he does when he is busy at work. He is so cuteland! He looks at his work so intently. He moves his eyebrows down in a peculiar fashion which makes it appear that something is confusing or he is looking at something important. Maybe something didn't work the way it should of. He puts his left hand in a half fisted motion towards his face as a pause between clicking and typing. He is working on two computers at one time. He really enjoys smelling and nibbling at his arm. He is such a hard working handsome wonderful cute cuddle-worthy interesting manland! His hair is so dark and ravishing....drool...I love his hair! He twitches his nose sometimes, I am not sure why. His face is so determined when he is working. He just scratched his head and put his right hand over his eye like something either annoyed, confused, or bothered him. Ooooohhhhhhh....a Scottland!"

"event","My subject of course refers to my desire to move in with Scottland. I haven't slept at my parent's house once since I got back from Montreal. It seems I might have to this week though because Scott wants to eat at home most of this week, and his apartment does not contain foods for Valerieland to eat the whole week for meals and such. I have no money to buy said foods until I go back to work, and of course my original plan in working was to save money for school, not use it to pay for food and regular ""basic"" needs. AIYA! My room at home needs so much organization too. I am having day dreams about organizing my things into Scottland's house. Scottland tells me that if I moved in with him, I wouldn't have to contribute much to rent, possibly nothing. But of course the food and personal needs things are different. If I move out with Scottland, a lot more other expenses might show up all of a sudden, at least I am afraid of them. Gods, I just want to move in with him! There is still a part of me that wishes I could stay at home, yet the problem is, at home, Scottland cannot sleep with me. I wish I could be with my parents and Scottland in the same place for long periods of time. I know that we would all probably become intensely sickened by it, but it seems like a nice idea. I miss conversations and time with my parents, but I just don't want to be away from Scottland. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! 
I was sick for three days including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. I was struck with a nasty case of stomach flu (as far as I know). I was puking and having other digestive tract problems. I still managed to have a good time though for parts of those three days. Yuckers it was during the hurting convulsing sickness!!!!
I got lots of interesting, unexpected, and comfortable gifts for Christmas. One of the gifts Scottland got for me has not actually arrived through the mail. He bought me something from the La Senza online store. Fun! Every gift I got was most unexpected, which is extra good! 
Meow...
I am thinking of a Bachelor of Education or Arts transfer, as well as my original plan of the Bachelor of Applied Communications in Professional Writing to take at Grant MacEwan this coming September. I need to see a career counsellor. 
There are too many things I have to do. 
{dentist, doctor/psychitrist, eyeball people, prescription & doctor visit in Montreal refund, applying for school, etc.}
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

"event","I have finally decided to update after arriving home from Montreal. The day I came home, December 19th, was a day of migraine or awful headache activity in my brain. I woke up with a slight hurt of head, and I was somewhat worried that it would get worse on an airplane, but I had hopes it would go away completely. We got to the airport in reasonable time, care of a man who periodically used his cell phone while driving. Of course, at the airport, Scottland and I had to go to our seperate gates to take seperate planes, much to my natural dislike. I felt a bit nervous, like I was a mouse in a pit of snakes. That is possibly an exaggeration. I also felt quite ignorant compared to all the other passengers. I liked it when Scottland was there to just lead me through everything. But alas, it worked out fine, until the powers that be, or lazy/crazy airport staff forgot to load a fair amount of cargo and luggage on the plane. Therefore, I and all the passengers waited anxiously to get under way for close to an hour. Some people, who were going to Vancouver, missed their connecting flights in Toronto. I thankfully did not miss my connecting flight to Edmonton. Yet still, my headache was worsening. I worry too much, and my brain very much detests the pressure changes that occur going up and down on airplanes. My stomach also was digging a hole inside of itself when the planes took off, and landed. I enjoyed my cold meal on the second flight. It was composed of spicy chicken, lettuce, grapes, guda cheese, some weird bread, a bread roll, a brownie, and a strange little piece of chocolate. The chairs on planes are disgustingly uncomfortable, very hard to sleep in. On my first flight, I sat beside a woman who seemed a bit apprehensive to my presence. I can't say for sure, but I think she felt I was annoying. The people I sat beside on the flight to Edmonton were nice enough. I believe they were a couple. The man did have an odd stink emitting from him at one point, but they were easy to sit beside. Still though, my headache worsened. I like planes, but they are not a good atomosphere for stressed out worrisome nut people like me. I was really glad when I arrived at the Edmonton International Airport, and rendevued with my parents, and to my surprise, Scottland, who was hiding behind a giant pillar. My Mom cried a bit, and my sister presented me with a great birthday present. Scottland went home with his Mom, and I went with my parents. Later, we met for a yummy dinner at the Coliseum Steak Ribs and Pizza, and I left with Scottland. 
Being back in Edmonton has been surreal and a little depressing. It is very warm here right now. I wish there was some more snow though. My parents gave me some money for my birthday, and I honestly don't feel like buying anything for myself, so I spent it on gifts for them and my siblings. I am glad I was able to get them some things. FUN! 
Shasta is very furry and cute. I think she is somewhat fatter than before. She is cuter for sure! Baby kittypoo is bigger, but still so small to me. I have yet to see the comedy of her attacking my dog Lady. My other dog Nova is all furry again. Before I left, she was close to bald. Lady doesn't seem sick at all. I am glad I didn't have to see her that way. I hope it stays gone. 
Aiya, I think I should stop typing or everyone will die the death of too much reading care of Valerieland. Bon soir!"

"event","Scott and I are both sick. I am only slightly, because I was sicker before and am now recovering. It is some cold virus that annoys the nose most of all. Scottland does not appear to be getting his usual sore throat, so I think that is good. Yet, he still seems to feel like crap. It sucks to be sick! My nose still has this constant feeling like it might explode. I really hope this sickness disappates quickly. Scott and I are going to see Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King on Wednesday as we bought advance tickets. I wish I could dress up. Sigh and poo! 
I am having bad dreams about going home involving simply not being able to sleep with my Scottland every night. I am worriedlands! I don't want to go back to Wendy's, but I have to. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAARRRRRRRR!
Montreal is now a full-fledged snow explosion. It had snowed, but then it melted away with rain. Now, it looks like the city has been eaten by snow. While it is snowing, I think it feels less cold outside, so I like it."

"event","Last night, Scott and I went to a Christmas party hosted by one of his Montreal work collegues, Ray. He has a very nice house in an upscale neighbourhood here in Montreal. I felt slightly odd at the party, and I think Scott did too. Most of Ray's friends were gothic people, or at least they seemed to be. Plus, I've never been to a non-family Christmas party in my life, and I am not exactly the social Queen, far from it. I liked the food at the party. The house is quite neat. The best part was the two black cats named Black Bean and Charlotte. Black Bean was a big fattie, so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Charlotte was much smaller. She would meow at me annoyed-like if I touched her tail or after I had been petting her for a while, but she wouldn't run away, she would just come back for more. Funny cute catlands!!!! Neither cat liked to be held, but I tried anyways just so I could feel them in my arms. I love caticuses! Scott and I arrived at the party quite early, and we left before everyone else. Scott was very hungry when we left the party, so we took a cab home, and then walked to Dunn's for some food. I just had some soup, whilst Scottland had some yummy steak and fries. All in all, a good night, somewhat feeling out of place of course though."

"event","Yes, I am aware that I have not updated in a long time, but that is all explained in my last entry.
It is cold here now, and quite a bit of snow has fallen, so Scott and I will not be shocked when we return to Edmontonland. 
Last night, Scott and I went out for dinner at Le Keg with Anne, Anne's parents Pat and Marie, Christine, Christine's friend Michel, and Anne's son Vladamir. It took a while to finally get our drinks, but all in all, it was a great dinner. I talked to Anne, my Great Aunt Marie, and my other second cousin Christine mostly. Scott was mostly quiet. Marie told me today that ""Scott is a really good guy!"" Yay, I wonderfully agree. 
Today was the Grade 4, 5, and 6 concert at Anne's school. I went as I was already there at the school. Anne's parents went because Anne's Dad Pat, my Great Uncle, wrote two of the Christmas songs. One was sung by the grade 4 group, the other by the grade 5 group. They were very nice songs. One was called ""Ev'ry time a bell rings"", and the other was ""Falling Snow."" I had wanted Scott to come, but he couldn't due to work conditions. 
Also today, Anne surprised me at school. She was making a big yellow and black card with a sun on it. I thought it was for her father. But, as it turns out, it was for me. Inside she wrote a good message to me. She gave me some money and toothpaste inside of it too. The reason why she gave me tooth paste was because I had mentioned that usually when people give me money I nearly always end up spending it on things like food and tooth paste, not on something entirely for myself. She demands that I buy something nice for myself. I guess I have to then. I was really surprised. She is a wonderful person. I hope she knows that. Scott and I plan on buying her a cadeau(gift in French) for being such a great host in Montreal.

"event","Yes, I am indeed a giant procrasinator! I had a strong feeling this would happen sooner rather than later to my livejournal. It is just that I find using the computar to be such a boring chore sometimes. I don't find it really all that fun most of the time. I am forcing myself to make this entry. Sorry to anyone who may be in rapt anticipation of my entries on here. 
Not much has happened at all since my last entry.
I do know when I am coming back to Edmonton though. I will arrive at 14:05 on December 19th, the day Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King comes out. I am coming back at least a day before Scottland because his work people have not actually indicated the exact details of when he is going except that it will porbably be on December 20th. Scott and I looked at the ticket prices for December 20th, and everywhere we looked, they were at least 300 dollars more than any on December 19th. WTF!?????
So, yeah, I will be a bit pooed off because I will not be with Scott on the plane back. 
At this point, I am indeed very nervous, in fact extremely beyond all nervousness ever nervous. When I get back, I don't know how I am going to be able to deal with things if they must go back to the way they were before Scott and I left for Montreal. Things being how I would go home and sleep at my parent's house some days and be with them some days. I never anticipated feeling this way when I decided to go to Montreal with Scottland. I just knew that if I didn't go with him to Montreal, I would be very lonely, bored, and I would miss a chance to travel. Therefore, I didn't really think about any emotional consequences. All the consequences I thought of were those about my education and my work. But, now I feel like I won't be able to handle not being with Scottland every single day. I don't understand people who can be away from the one they love for weeks or months at a time, and not feel hugely depressed. I am not sure how to explain myself, it is just the way I feel. I miss my parents, but I just need to be with Scott. I wish we could all live together in some grand place of niceness. Maybe we'd all hate each other then though, I don't knowlands. I don't know what to do. I have no money. I won't be making a lot of money when I go back to work at Wendy's. I have to go to school. I have to pay for school. I want and need to be with Scottland. I need to see him everyday. He's my Scottland! WHAT IS THE SOLUTION??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"

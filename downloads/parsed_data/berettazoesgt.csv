"event","<font face=""comic sans ms"">OMG...LOL...DJ got the helix of his ear pierced..lol...he just called me and was like totally FLIPPING OUT!!! It was soooo fucking funny!!! Hmmm...what else happened to me today.....oh yeah..NOTHING. :-\ I've been going crazy thinking about Doug all of this week. I can't get him off of my mind. I keep listening to the song ""Sabatoge"" by the Beastie Boys cuz it reminds me of him (long story)....Anyway, I really wanna see him again :( cuz I really like him but he hasn't been on the net since Saturday! He did email me, however,  to let me know that this wasn't going to be a good week as far as him being able to get on the computer...<sigh> oh well :-\ Hopefully I'll be able to talk to him soon...I MISS HIM!!!"

"event","Well, it's set...my life officially SUCKS ASS! This week in particular. It all started w/ the minifest being cancelled...I had been depressed for a while and was hoping that the minifest would somewhat cure me. ...but nooo that had to be shot down the poop hole. Which, I can sorta understand w/all of the stuff going on. Then on Saturday I went out w/Doug and it was great! The best time I've had in a while......but I haven't talked w/him since...I'm feeling as though I'm being avoided...Anyway, Tuesday I drove to MD to see Ricky. This was probably the best day I had this week. Then 2day school just started to really get to me and everything is just getting to me now....I can tell cuz I'm rambling about nonsense now.....Oh! And monday...I went to take a test for a company and was SUPPOSED to get the friggin job but they ""changed their minds""...FUCKING BASTARDS! This week just SUCKS!!! I hate my fucking life..I want to die...end of story..good night."

"event","Well, this week has been nothing short of hell for berettanet, berettatalk, and berettagurlz. :-\ I have a feeling that a lot of the friendships I have are never going to be the same after all of this BS. But, what can you do. Shit happens and you just have to roll with the punches. Jason (one of my beretta pallies..heh heh) was supposed to come and visit me this weekend, but now he's not so sure :( ARGH!! I don't understand men. Well, actually I kinda can't blame him for not wanting to. I've been acting weird lately cuz I'm just so confused about so many different things. Today hasn't been a good day :( ::goes back and crawls in to her hole again::"

"event","Well, it's been a pretty good day so far. I guess it can't go bad being that it's 11:20p.m. However, I'm waiting for this guy with the parts for my beretta to get here and I guess if he doesn't show up it will make this day not so special. Oh well, what can ya do? Anywho, I had a nice evening tonight. My boyfriend and I went out with our two friends. We went out to dinner and then went back to their house and sat outside and talked. It was a beautiful night, a little chilly, but otherwise, very nice. There's nothing like sitting outside with good friends and chatting the night away."

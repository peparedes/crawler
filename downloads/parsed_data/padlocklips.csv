 i hope everyone had a rockin Christmas :D mine was not too shabbt. spent with my mom's overly blunt and upfront family eating way too many cookies and the like. haha. my cousins have gotten pretty cool though, which is a nice break from their usual rude devious selves. 

 my Christmas thingies:
 
 $30 MAC certificate
 bottle of MAC MV3 perfume
 peanut butter chocolate daisies
 two belly barbells
 bra & undies
 harry potter calendar
 $40 to the mall 
 about $300 in cash
 crossword puzzle books

 and...

 effin CELL PHONE <3 new baby. so nice compared to my old brick of a phone. number = 403-519-2208 for anyone who cares.

 i also am asking my mom to get me a membership to the gym when we get home because my New Years resolution is going to be to finish putting off all the weight i swore i would last year, and have mostly accomplished, i just need to build up some abs/muscle.

 i bought more MAC stuff today. haha..i am a FIEND!.. i purchased some Hyper Real SPF foundation which is amazing! annnd some eyeshadow in 'Retro-speck' which is a silvery-brown colour... which brings my total to 12.

 i miss my bed. and coffee every morning. and outings with Adam. and my kitten. and my pink walls. hell, I even miss Wal~Mart. 5 more days.

 oh, and my grandma (dad's mom) has been in the hospital since Christmas eve due to complications she had following a procedure she'd had earlier that week. hope she's okay :\..
 
 and lastly... i retired my lip piercing tonight as i am bored with it. people like me shouldn't get pierced. i get bored too quickly. oh well. i'm still in love with my navel piercing... and planning on getting my nose done when i return to Calgary. wee.

 i think that is all."

"event","So. i am currently sitting in Caity's bedroom, where we are taking a break after way too much shopping in an insanely busy mall, where i saw way too many people i used to know. i arrived here yesterday around 1pm, by train(!)..which i love. and where i met an interesting fella by the name of Parker.

 After this we are having a drinking adventure with Caity's Wal-Mart crew. hahah. oh boy. apparently i can't even get away from the place on vacation.

 So obviously, i arrived in ontario in one piece. which happened Wednesday. it's be alright so far. got all my xmas shopping done, finally.

 Only thing that kind of sucks is that i left at a bad time, because things were just beginning to happen with Adam. hopefully, they will commence where they left off when i return. apparently the rumours are already flying at work. joy.

 Tomorrow i go back to my dad's and then i will have to endure christmas dinners and way too many relatives.

 I wish i could be here for New Years..which is a tradition for Caity & i..but i cannot. blah. so it will most likely be spent lonely, sitting on my dad's couch, unless i manage to go to my aunt's party, which will also be lonely. meh.

 holidays really suck sometimes. i wish i wasn't alone for them."

 except Wednesday when i left art about 45 minutes early to go to Tim Horton's with Adam before work. and yesterday when i was late for science and then ended up going downtown with Casey, Jackie & Ray to Jackie's dentist appointment, in which the three of us sat in her truck drawing interesting pictures and listening to Billy Idol and such.

 i've been so hyper lately. even without caffeine. just off in my own little world. i enjoy it.

 today i actually went to all my classes, but the school called and said i missed math, which is annoying because i didn't.

 i cut out 24 styrofoam eyes in art today. hah. i shall explain this later, as i am tiiired.

 i can't wait to get my reading glasses. writing four pages of notes in social today just made my eyes tired and gave me a headache. bah.

 tonight Adam came over around eight. he just left about twenty minutes ago. am i a good entertainer or what? we just hung around, watched tv & talked and such. fun stuff.

 i close tomorrow night at work. ick. blah. oh well. i shall survive.
 
 Meh. i spoke to Jamie the other night at Wal-Mart. it was kind of weird, but went okay. i think i sort of weireded him out though, because i usually go out of my way to ignore him if i see him, and this time i just figured i'd get the first step over with and chat with him for a minute. akward, but somehow relieving.

 anyways. i am off to bed as my brain is quite jumbled and i need sleep."

"event","Well, i finally had a quite good week, which was nice.

 Mostly to do with mindset. done a lot of ""soul searching"" so to speak, and stopped dwelling so much on things i cannot change...

 Monday & Tuesday were spent at home because i have a terrible cold which i am getting really sick of now, because i want to be able to not cough, and to be able to breathe. Wednesday was school, regular routine. Thursday, school & not a bad evening at work, it went by quickly and i had fun. ""caaaawww"" haha. oh man. Friday i purchased a ticket to the Cradle of Filth show on a whim because i decided it would be nice to go to a show after not having been to one in a year, followed by seeing The Incredibles that night with Adam from work which was quite a lot of fun. Saturday morning was work which went by quickly and Saturday night was Cradle of Filth with Laura & her boyfriend Ben. it was kind of strange because i've never really been into them much, but their music is pretty amazing, and i was just kind of like ""holy crap, it's Dani fucking Filth"". some low points of the evening were the fact that we had to wait outside in line for almost two hours, and then the venue was absolutely freezing so i wore my winter jacket pretty much the entire time. also, Bleeding Through is a terrible band. Today was work again as well until 7, but it was fun as always, especially with the aid of caffeine pills.

 Tomorrow is back to the routine. bah. i loathe school. but it's all done at the end of this year. blah blah blah.

 I'm freezing. and somewhat tired. and my ribs hurt from coughing.....

 but hey, i actually did homework tonight.

"event","Okay. so i'm still super sick today. hacking up lungs of all sorta, sniffling & unable to breathe properly. but i've come to some revelations..sort of. and i feel *almost* like my old self again. i know it will still be a long hard road ahead of me before i am completely okay. i just need to make some changes in my life. and i also need a break from this province for awhile, which i will be getting soon enough!

 Well. i missed school again today. i feel like a horrible failure. and i know i need to be going..every..single..day. getting all my homework done, studying my ass off. all of that. or else i'm not going to make it through my last year of highschool. and all my teachers look at me like i'm a ""bad kid"" and i just know what they're thinking. that i'm lazy, that i just don't care. and i hate that. i just wish that i could explain to them what i've been feeling like. I keep feeling as if i have no control over how i'm going to feel or how motivated i am. i wish i could tell them how sometimes laying in better just seems like a better alternative to sitting at school with so many unfamiliar faces, not knowing if i'm going to be able to handle it. It seems like ever since he left, i just.. feel out of control. i'm moody, i'm irritable, i spin out of control, i'm wreckless, i have no motivation. and i doubt a teacher would understand why a 17 year old girl would feel that, just because her boyfriend left her. and i don't even understand it. i just know that i haven't been myself the last two months. and i need to make A LOT of changes. I can't wait to make New Years resolutions.

 Things are seeming a lot easier the past few days. i know i still have a long way to go. and if i wasn't sickly at this moment, i could say i was ""GOOD"" for once instead of ""i don't know"" or ""i'm....ok"". Now that i can stop thinking that he's coming back, stop thinking he's good for me, stop thinking that it was me that did something wrong, i can begin the process of moving on. which i plan to do. after i read those things, after i saw him.. i realized he changed. and not for the better. he became everything i've always really hated. your typical, obnoxious teenage boy, obsessed with sex and all those fun things. he's everything he never was before. and i don't need that....

 I just need to get him out of my head completely. out with the bad. in with the good.

 I realized that i love myself. at least i'm beginning to. and i can do better than that. i don't need someone who's just going to hop from one girl to the next when he gets bored, or when things don't go his way. i especially don't need a boy who's going to go for a girl like <i>that</i>....

 I'm also thinking of switching schools next semester. I kind of want to go to Scarlett to be with Kate & Laura. i need a new crowd. new everything. 

 & Today was pretty good. i woke up at 7:30, said ""screw it"" to going to school, which was probably a bad idea. watched Dawson's creek until 9:30..then went back to bed until 1. and then i went out for coffee at tims with Adam from work. which was fun. we just sat and talked for two hours and made fun of the bad drivers in the parking lot :P.

 I can't wait until x-mas break..to visit my Caity! :) so excited. i miss my bestest buddy <3

 bah bah bah. Sex & The City is onnnn <3 and math beckons to me.

 I need more days like this. i talk too much.

 Oh and one of my earrings closed up :( much sadness."

 why am i constantly s i c k.. i think i have mono :( as i cannot swallow, and i can't stop feeling tired.

 sometimes i just can't believe myself. and my horrible judgement in people. i have a bad perception of what is good & what is bad. the people i always think are perfect end up being the ones i always hate the most. and i especially can't believe you, and your changes, and this life you've created for yourself. and how i'm unsure of whether to think you're living a lie, or you're just finally letting your true colours show through. and let me tell you, what i see, i do not like. i am not impressed. and i'm kind of disappointed in myself for not seeing it earlier. for not seeing that you are in fact just like every other average human being in this world. i'm sorry i ever thought you were special, or for seeing something so amazing in you, when there is nothing amazing at all. i sort of feel bad for you. i almost want to laugh.

 anyways. now that i have yet another ramble out of my system. things have just been going on lately. and i've found some things out that make me rethink myself, make me wonder why i'm mourning this relationship so much.

 so things are looking slightly brighter. i think things will get a little easier from now on. i hope. unless i have to see him five times in a row, like i did the other day. 

 my puppy had surgery today. no babies for her :\. so she's got this plastic cone on her head. and she looks so sad and pathetic.  
 
 anyways. sore throats are horrible. so is school. and social exams. Sex & The City should on now, so it can cheer me up <3

 everything was confirmed today. i had to see ""them"" for the very first time. and saw him for the first time in two months. it's so weird how you can not see someone for two months, but their face is the most familiar thing in the world when you finally do see it. god, he looked more beautiful than ever. 

 & of course, i proceeded to shake and have an almost-breakdown in work and had to sit in the back for fourty-five minutes with Sam and hugged for a good twenty minutes, and talked. and everyone babied me all night, which kind of annoyed me. but i realized that i work with some really nice people who actually care about me. and that i am thankful for. i got hugs, and hair-messed-upness and Timbits.

 i went to Bushido with kate & alex after school. well first we went to Arby's to eat and then kate bought shoes and then we went to Bushido. we had to wait a bit, the waiting was the worst :\ my piercer was Jake, who is pretty cool. very nice. i got a 14g silver barbell with a pink jewel in the bottom ball. 

 afterwards we went back to kate's and drank ""soda"" & watched invader zim.

 the only thing that sucks is that it's really sore right now. and i hit it on my sweater earlier and it pulled the bar up a bit & it won't go down due to swelling.

 ..and work will be crappy tomorrow. all the bending and moving around. yikes.

 everything stresses me out. everyone annoys me. suddenly, i've become really short with everyone and i hate it.

 i love the days when i can smile & laugh and feel like i'm actually living. and i hate the days when i feel like i'm a cement block. just existing for the hell of it. why is it that one person can make me feel like this? i despise that.

 Work has been extra busy lately, since people are starting Christmas shopping already. and since i'm in Toys it's extra busy. i've been taking extra shifts & stuff so i can save up for xmas presents and such. plus it's nice to be at work keeping myself occupied, even though it makes me want to hang myself at times. 

 i think i am going to get my belly button pierced on friday. gasp. hah that should be exciting. if i go through with it. 

 i've been going for walks pretty much every night lately. or every other night. it's quite nice to just put on my headphones and walk until i can't feel my legs anymore. and i either think, or let my mind go blank. the only thing that ruins it is the passing cars.

 i wish i could wake up and be fine. i wish this month was over. so i can say i made it through another one. i wish the cold would subside, it makes my lungs ache. and mostly, i wish i could string together a coherent thought. wish i could find some sense in everything.

"event","agh. i'm in the worst mood right now :\ and i'm not even sure why. just one of those days.

 my dumb dog ate my whale underwear.. hah. they're green. with a whale on the front. and they say ""havin' a whale of a time!"" on the bum :(. and this stuff i spilled on my favourite jeans wouldn't come out in the wash. and i barely got any sleep last night. and last night's episode of Sex & The City made me cry. i had to cut open a sheep eye in Science. my discman messed up & i'm pretty sure i failed a Capitalism exam in Social.. ack.

 & then i had to go see my therapy lady this evening and talk about..things.. with her. much tears & sadness. blah.

 i wish i could just run away sometimes. go somewhere. get away from this mess..this discord. this city is so loud and unforgiving. 
 
 hope everyone's Halloween was fantastic. i worked all evening. blah. but there was candy involved. and i found a little boy's fireman outfit to wear. complete with a plastic hatchet. so it made the evening worth while.

 i decided that i am travelling to Europe with <a href=""http://livejournal.com/~brokensoundx"">Caity</a> after school is done. Italy, France, Spain..here i come! 

 i'm cleaning my room. organizing things. trying not to think. i have the worst headache ever & i cannot wait until i get my eyes checked because my vision is craptacular. 

 ....GrrrrRrrrrR... i just feel like screaming today. punching something.

 at least i will now be driven to & from school by Jackie on occasion, saving me from le bus. that is nice.

 ergh. i'm going to make tea. and watch television."

strength in my bones
put words in my head 
when they pour out to paper
it's all for you...</i>

Max Bemis from Say Anything writes the best songs. seriously.

work was booooring this evening. but went by quickly as i cleared an entire clearance section & then proceeded to ""socialize"" the rest of the evening. it was fun! i was a gay pirate with rainbow stockings & we played Barbie games on a laptop...thing. and the manager was pretty slack tonight too. 

tomorrow is Halloween! i wish i could trick or treat, because i could obviously get away with it. but i stuck working :\. but i will wear kitten ears & a pumpkin necklace and eat candy, so it might be okay.

i keep eating fortune cookies. & hoping for a good fortune. mm. Teddy Grahams & Ovaltine.

"event","""forever"", you said, as we stared eye to eye. we lay side by side in the coldness of the night breathing life into each other. ""forever"", you said, as i placed my hand upon your chest in attempt to memorize your heart beats. ""forever"", you said, as we chased clouds & named stars. we created a world entirely of our own, letting no one else in. ""forever,"" you said, and your voice was sincere, and i knew you told the truth. but ""forever"", you said ""isn't our fate"" as you gathered your belongings and touched my face. the look in your eyes was unfamiliar & cold. ""forever"", you said, ""just isn't mean to be"" and you stood on the steps, the moon glittering on your face, and i barely recognized you. ""forever"", you said, ""is not for you & i"", and you walked away into the night. i stood there in dizzy shock until your silhouette diminished into the fog, and ""forever"", i whispered, ""simply does not exist."" 

 more poetic babble. blah.

 i like the ride the bus & the train. i like the watch people..and just sit there and look out the window.

 i feel like Charlie in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower""... <a href=""http://livejournal.com/~paris_intherain"">Karla</a> always said i was like him. and now that i think about it, maybe i am. now that i think about it, that's possibly the best compliment i've ever been given. the observer."

"event","i'm left here, gurgling broken sentences that you will never hear. not because you can't, but simply because you don't want to. constantly whispering under my breath, the unrequited love of a boy that once shone in my heart, never forgotten. you've moved along, so quickly, so cruelly. your wanton heart, so sporadic, so eager to forget. intermittant love that you said was meant to be, but then you snatched it away right before my eyes. you stitched up my mouth so i couldn't speak and you bottled my heart in the cellar so it couldn't be found. it tried to show through, but you ignored it effortlessly, like i was never there at all. you could hear it beating from a mile a way, every beat pumping blood just for you. but you cover your ears as not to hear, and you walk away from me time and time again leaving me lusting and pathetic. i don't know how you do it, shut it all off. you closed everything in, how can you pretend it never was, when i'm stuck here being reminded every hour, every minute. 

 why i still make attempts to write, i do not know.

 frick. i am rather inebriated.

 tequila rose is good. so is arbour mist. yes. i'm suprised alcohol is not dripping from my pores.

 we watched Fight Club. destruction is my new middle name.
 
 where is my mind?.....

 i've never really written ""drunken"" journal entries before. perhaps, a new hobby. although not a healthy one.

 i should sleep. i have to work tomorrow morning. ick."

"event","The vodka burns my throat, but it sure leaves a better taste than your name does as it rolls off my tongue. numb every bitter memory away with another swallow. 

 i'll just drown it all away in a sea of martinis & other upscale drinks that are too high-class for the likes of me, but my mother drinks them, so i'll have one anyway. 

 i like the warm feeling it leaves inside, when everything is so cold. i like the way my head is just static & nothing else. i like not thinking for once.

 m.a.c eyeshadow is too expensive, but i'll continue buying it just because i can."

"event","Blah. i think i need to join ""shopaholics anonymous"" my god. shopping is like therapy now. drowning my sorrows in random purchases. haha. at least it makes me feel better...right? i bought... a green & grey striped hoodie, blue long sleeve shirt, white long sleeve shirt, fuschia sweater, Halloween underwear (!), an aqua-ish coloured shirt, headphones, a lip ring (black captive).. i think that's all. i was going to buy boots, but i'll wait for my mom to do that. 

 I bought a really nice winter coat the other day, but i had to exchange it for a bigger size today. it's black satin with red silk lining & a fur hood. i enjoy it a lot. especially with my zebra mittens.

 Hm. there's an opening in the Automotives department at the Wal~Mart i work at.. the part time dude quit, so i might apply for it.. i'm getting a bit sick of the toy department. even then i just got like.. a 70 cent raise in the past month. and my manager loves me. 

 frick. i hate this cold weather business. but i love the way everything is buzzing this time of year. i'm going to shoot myself when the Christmas music starts up though. ack.

 Halloween is soooon!..but why is there snow on the ground?! joy.

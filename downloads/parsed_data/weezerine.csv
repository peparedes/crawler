"event","so turns out i am going to taiwan after all... all expenses paid for almost 3 weeks... that's pretty awesome i guess... so i feel really stupid feeling this way... but i'm actually kinda bummed that i'm gonna miss out on SOOB and sage francis... i know an all expenses paid overseas trip is logically something to get more excited about right? but there haven't been any good events in the last couple months and i've had heaps of fun at SOOB and sage francis in the past so i was really looking forward to both... the thing with the taiwan trip is that my cousin will be there too and we might end up cramping each other's style... plus i'm not sure what kind of people will be on this trip... especially with my inability to connect with other people which is a lot more apparent at this period in my life... i hope there'll be some cool people

i hate it when people get touchy feely with you when it's known that they're in a relationship... what the fuck are you thinking?? i wouldn't like knowing my boyfriend is at a party without me and drunk and flirting with other girls... maybe i'm just really traditional and prudish or whatever... but that shit's wrong"

i think i might try and get a second job over the summer... to keep myself occupied... and the extra cash would be handy... and i wanna try and spend some time at the computer labs too... to scan all my negs and i really wanna have a fiddle with illustrator too... really wanna start incorporating more graphical elements into my work... i'm gonna give peter the shits with that... i know it... mwahahah... oh no i'm gonna have to put up with him for another 3 years... groan

i get to use the new imac g5 at work... it's so purdy...

celia was at the exhibition thingy on monday... it was cool to see her again... i sometimes wondered what happened to her... we didn't get to talk for long and my mind was so scattered... but maybe i'll see her next week and catch up then

the photography grad show yesterday was pretty overwhelming... lots of really good stuff... but at the same time everything was so same-y... most of the creative ad stream was very stylised/fashion based... which i can appreciate but is not really the shooting style i think i'll get into... or maybe i will... i dunno... i think i have an idea what direction i wanna go in but i don't really... i don't feel i'll ever be good enough for this shit... but strangely enough it still feels like the right thing to be doing... i have another 3 years to find my niche... i don't wanna do straight photography... shit i don't even wanna be a photographer hahaha!

fuck... and the photo store didn't provide me with the right cable for the flash so i couldn't get the flash assignment done today as i'd planned... and fricking officeworks couldn't bind my book so that means tomorrow i'll have to plead with some other places to see if i can get them to bind it on the spot for me...

on another note... darren hanlon rocked the house on friday night... beforehand me and huy had the spiciest scallop soup... it was unbearable... and then afterwards i almost made myself sick with a lovely but way rich macadamia dessert... and on saturday i got 2 pairs of perfectly fitting pants... it's been awhile since i had a taste of the ole retail therapy... though seeing the christmas decorations up already in myer and the skanky summer styles did make me mad"

It's as if we have a lot to talk about with each other but just can't find the right words to get started ... so we downshift into small-talk for the nth time and look for ways around the next awkward moment. Such is my sense of it, anyway -- because I certainly am an introvert, and I do frequently find myself searching for words when we're together, searching for a way to explore this ""connection"" I feel with you.</i>

i was bored so i decided to go out last night... plus it was a good excuse to go out and shoot for imaging... i was kinda scared to tell my mum i was heading out since i went out the night before and didn't tell her about it and she'd just had a go at me that morning... so i told her i was going out to take photos and she was surprisingly cool with it... so i went to the orient to check out the boom bip show... he didn't do much for me... i preferred the local acts actually... i thought there'd be some people i knew there but there wasn't so i found a spot in the corner and tucked myself away there for the night... a pretty boy sitting near me kept looking at me and offered me beer... which was sweet i guess..? :P  later on luke came and hung out with me... he was pretty wasted and was starting to gross me out... and emma was there also with her mum which was funny... gary turned up later also and i had a bit of a chat to olivia... i was getting bored with boom bip so i wandered off into the valley to look for some photo opps since the lighting in the orient was way flat... there wasn't really much going on so i was thinking about heading home when i ran into julian and dan at ric's... then guille... then angela... so i ended up hanging out with guille... sitting round and people watching and stuff... we didn't talk about anything deep and meaningful but it was nice... in an awkward kind of way... but comfortable nonetheless... :)

and on thursday me and jenny went to see cat empire... it was a spur of the moment decision and we probably shouldn't have since we were both so tired... but twas still cool... so packed and hot though... ugh... especially when you bump into the sweaty people next to you and it makes your arm feel all gross... urrrkk...

"event","i miss my friend... hanging out with huy and michelle and people at/from uni is all good up to a point... but i just want some real company... i'd call her... but i have nothing to talk about... i'd be happy just to sit and stare at the sky

i wrote a lot of crap over the last couple weeks... no i'm not hypo anymore... i have flat-lined once more

all uni work is coming along well... just plodding along at a nice even pace... feedback has been good... but it's not generating much of a response... there are 2 parties and a bbq i can go to this weekend... but i don't think i will... we are becoming such a cohesive group... it's a foreign concept for me

hmm yeah... i got nothing... is monotnous even a word?"

eXpressive: 5/10
Practical: 6/10
Physical: 3/10
Giver: 4/10 

You are a RPIT--Reserved Practical Intellectual Taker. This makes you a Love Geek.

Heh heh -- you love geek! You are weirdly sexy. It doesn't take people a long time to get to know you, but people *think* it takes a long time, because you are as cool and regulated after a year as you are on a first meeting. You don't tend to date casually -- you just suddenly find yourself in long term relationships.

Your approach to conflict is your greatest asset -- it complements almost every other type. You don't express yourself or your feelings in dramatic terms, but you will speak up to those who do. You are generally calm, but capable of ramping up, and you don't give up until the issue is resolved -- this means even the hottest temper or coolest conflict-avoider can feel comfortable pursuing their satisfaction with you. And you don't hold a grudge -- you get through it, and it's done. You rock. 

Sure, you like the sex. And you communicate with your partner well, so you're good at it. But it's not something you would make jokes about or bring up in polite company (not that you don't appreciate that kind of humor). You're no prude, but that's just not your style. 

You'd make an excellent parent. 

You enjoy food and can be a ravenous eater. A good cook will get your attention quickly.

Of the 79871 people who have taken this quiz, 5.2 % are this type."

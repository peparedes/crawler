Maybe it's because I'm cold, or maybe I died last night &amp; didn't realize it.<br /><br />I'm going to buy Lauren's purse off of her because it's majorly cute &amp; she hates it so woot woot!!<br /><br />Thank you to Molly &amp; Lauren for being the only people to add me back.<br /><br />Lauren &amp; I have art next period, but I don't feel like dealing with my project. I've already screamed at it &amp; almost thrown it across the room. Who knows what today will hold.<br /><br />Work tonight will suck as usual, but what's new? I really need to start looking for another job before I go karate on them all!!</font></strong></p>"

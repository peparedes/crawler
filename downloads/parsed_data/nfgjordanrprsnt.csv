"event","Soooo Im being forced to update haha....so I'm gonna use this space to just talk about a bunch of bullshit Ive been going through lately....

Reason 1: Brian......I do not know wtf is up with him but um I appreciate the coming home every fuckin weekend a month ago to see me and now coming home and not even calling COOL BRIAN COOL! GAH Im so glad that hes willing to lose me as a friend to gain her as a girlfriend...I love guys seriously

Reason 2: Valentines Day...holy shit could we say SUCKED ASS...majorly. Um i would like for just one year to go out on a date with a guy I actually like...considering I went out to eat with two and had the worst time frigin EVER imaginable...we talked about ducks for Gods sake. It was horrible...and my ""date"" looked like freddy kruegar....then stupid Hunter comes over with his friend Brad...and so Im thinkin alright Brads hott...no he has a girlfriend WONDERFUL...so my cool valentines consisted of:
A) Date from hell
B) Coulda been a hook up...but no
C) Watching movies with Sarah where the woman in it is WAY gettin hooked up

Reason 3: I've been having a guy overload all the sudden....like one week I have NOONE and I feel so fuckin depressed i just wanna die...then two weeks later from that theres like three...David I know ur reading this and ur like u bitch, but I want everyone to know I like David the best! because he loves me and i love him and he is going to bring me flowers and he was the only one who even thought about it on Valentines Day...

Reason 4: Prestin....so i have only met him once and i talk to him online but he looks like BENJI MADDEn and dammit I cant help thinking hes hott...he does a lot of drugs and im not down with that so making out would be fine with me!

UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM I think Im done complaining...yeah im good
Im going to see Britney Spears(yea LAUGH IT UP) on March 23rd with my cool ass cousin...then Aerosmith on April 7th (joe Perry rocks my fuckin world)...then Warped Tour on August 2nd...which I am very pleased to find out we are one of the select dates Simple Plan will be playing...yes there music sucks but that gives me one more chance to hook up with the love of my life Pierre Bouvier...remember guys last year he said i was hott OH YES IT WILL HAPPEN THIS YEAR....on that note IM out"

"event","Soooooooo it says its been since August 24th since i updated and that is FOREVER ago so Im gonna do it now. Ummmm life in general is pretty okay...love life ehhhhh. I did have this guy who shall remain nameless who decided to get back with his ex and show me the frigin 400 dollar ring he bought her for christmas LUCKY ME...what did I get NUTHIN a burned CD in November that was ""my christmas present"" BOO. So other than that I took up guitar which Im fairly good at considering I've only been playing for a month or so...maybe the next Michelle Branch.  Doubt it. So I'm doing this study Biology homework what a BIATCH she gives us no joke 4 hours of homework a night...i think I might go crazy. And so Im only updating this cause this cool guy David told me too. I hadn't talked to him for like 6 months and he calls out of nowhere to apologize for some things he said which I think it pretty damn cool that someone has the balls to admit they were wrong. So thanks for that David and yes I love u haha. So i hope ur happy that I updated my journal for u.~Cara"

"event","WOW its been a long ass time...and the sad thing is not much has changed. I went back to school fun fun fun. It actually isnt that bad this year...a lot of cool people to chill with. And....I really like Dashboard Confessional, like whenever they first came out I was like WTF but I just started listening to them again recently cause everybodys been talkin about going to the concert at the beach and I like hella like them now. I should probably go get there cd. I dunno what my deal is lately but Ive been missin a certain person and it sucks and gah yea it sucks! Cause theres not a damn thing I can do about it...so Ill just deal with being alone for right now and stay single and hell who knows maybe something will work out...doubtful but possible. That song Screaming Infidelities reminds me of him too speaking of Dashboard....

...Your not alone and ur not descreet
You make sure I know whos taking you home
Im reading ur note over again
Theres not a word that I comprehend
Except when u signed it
I will love u always and forever

As for now Im gonna hear the saddest songs
and sit alone and wonder
how your making out
And as for me I wish that I was ANYWHERE
with ANYONE making out!

Im missin ur laugh how did u break
and when did ur eyes begin to look fake
I hope ur as happy as ur pretending...

I feel like that song was written about my whole situation it fits like frigin perfect. It reminds me of him cause hes got this girlfriend and I duno I see them together and I know hes not doing this but it seems like hes rubbing it in my face...it just isnt cool for me to see. And Dashboard makes me cry I just realized it....So yeah Im out...later"

"event","WOO HOO! Warped Tour was awesome dude! Althought it was hot as fourty hells out there it straight! First we found out The Ataris werent playing until 1 and we had two hours to kill. SO we were walking around the booths and guess who we saw....Seb the guitar player for Simple Plan at his merch booth...Imagine that....He was awesome! And so then we watched The Ataris...kick ass....then we watched The Starting Line...Kenny rocks my world haha! He just seems so awesome to me! Then we watched Mest haha TONY IS A TRIP AND A HALF! Man he was cracking me up! Let me give u a run down of Tonys famous drunken lines from my show...

""I was walking around earlier right after I woke up and this girl came up to me and she's like ur band sucks ur sucha poser and I was like well alteast Im not fat and ugly so I wanna dedicate this to her I hope u fall and break ur fatt ass u stupid whore.""

""Nice tits!""

""Hey this is my brother he's a virgin he wants to have sex with u nice tits girl so come suck his dick."" HA

""I want everybody to say FUCK U to those stupid assholes waiting on the other band to come on. They know they could be watching us cause the other one doesnt play until we're done. Jackasses.""

See Tony is a trip. Anyways...after his set I was talkin on my cellphone and apparently I was looking at him although I had no idea it was him and he winked at me! HAHAHA! So then after that we had like forever until All American Rejects played....so we went to go to sleep HAHA for 2 hours! So we got back up at 6 and went to go check on everything and buy my warped tour shirt. So then we notice Simple PLan is playing at 6:30 and not at 8:30 like was planned. SO Pierre comes out on stage WHEW HOTT and hes like....""The guy in AFI had a family emergency I know you dont wanna see us but they'll be out on our show time at 8:30."" So everybody that came to see AFI like booed them and shit. It was so sad! But a lot of people liked them and they got the crowd hyped. SO anyways after their set we went back to the Simple Plan merch table and guess who was there....PIERRE BOUVIER...the singer for all u stupid asses who dont know...so we were talkin to him and hes like ""Your hats awesome it makes u look hot."" and i was like HELL YEAH he said I was hot! and then when I was getting my picture made with him I accidently put my hand under his shirt instead of on the outside so I was touching his back and hes like WHOA!!! like really loud and shit! I was so embarrassed haha! But he was awesome! And hes the love of my life!!!! So then we saw All American Rejects and left.......and my pictures are AWESOME!!!"

Wathching 40 Days and 40 Nights and The Real Cancun...Cancun sucks by the way dont waste ur time! Then we decided why not go to Dennys...cause I've never been there. I know its sad. So we jammed to old school Hanson all the way there. It was great. There are some scary characters in Dennys early in the morning. Man some guy talkin about getting herpes from his mama I was like uhhhhhh check please. So then we took Rachel to work... Then I SLEPT. Then went to work!

SO TODAY - My mom comes into my room at 8:30 in the morning to tell me my hottie yardworker has finally come. That was enough to make me get up FAST! SO I stared at him all day and I found out he likes New Found Glory just as much as I do. YAY! And he waved at me when I was driving out of the driveway. YAY! I had to make my presence known all day long! But he's not coming back for a while...but atleast he's coming back right?!? So then later today I went to work for forever! And I came home and this guy left me a message...it was all I miss talkin to u call me on my cell whatever.......He wants some ass end of story...U guys dont know my history with him but uh yeah. It was cute I guess needless to say I didn't call him BECAUSE I told him to call me and he's all alright and then NEVER FUCKIN CALLED. JERK!

"event","Today was pretty alright. Last night my girl Sarah spent the night and this morning I went back to her house. Her crush guy that i secretly have this thing for too haha came to show us his truck the night before and while we were driving to her house this morning he was in front of us cause he lives in her neighborhood. So I'm like no makeup no shower no nuthing and  he pulls in behind me at her house. So I'm trippin out cause I don't want him to see me like that. I'm not a bitch so I went to his window and hes like what are u guys doing for lunch and we're all going to chik-fil-a and hes like alright i wanna go so call me when ur ready to go...and Im thinkin okay go ahead and invite urself but really what I was thinking was how far can I pull my hat down so he doesnt see my face haha! Anyways so we went out with him and then came back to her house and watched Blade II. Which was kinda uncomfortable cause it was like her then me then him. So I was like the middle man. I dunno I dont really think he likes her like as a girlfriend but thats just me haha. So then I took him back to his house cause apparently he cant walk five houses down and then I came back to my house. 

So then I started watching Gangs of New York. And I have to say it was REALLY good. I'm usually not down with historic movies except like Pearl Harbor and of course Titanic but this was like REALLY good. And I have to take a minute and say how much I appreciate Leonardo DiCaprio. Not only is he beautiful but he is an AMAZING actor. He can play so many different things...from a raging gang member to ""king of the world"" Titanic Boy. He just amazes me everytime I see him. It's gone passed the good looks for me I see him as just a great actor and those are hard to come by. The movie was so great! I think everybody should go out and rent it....definetly. So yeah I'm done with my Leo spill so yeah LATER~Cara"

Then I took my sister to the orthodontist fun fun...but it was cool we only stayed for like 10 minutes. Then we went to eat at Ruby Tuesdays where I got checked out by some guys OH OH OH speaking of getting checked out on the way home from the ortho appointment I was stuck at this light for like 2 frigin hours...okay maybe like five minutes but that is STILL a long time! Anyways so there are these three guys in this car and this one is hanging out the window trying to get my attention but I like see him through the corner of my eye cause I got good peripheral vision haha. And I'm like damn do u know how stupid u look so hes all whats ur name...so I decided I was gonna play with him and I'm all Britney...and he goes u wanna come hang out with us and Im like no I have to go to my tour rehearsal and drove off...they got the best look on there face like holy shit was that a famous person HAHA.

"event","Alright I think I finally get this thing so I can finally tell you about yesterday. It was the fuckin coolest. My sister shes a hella good swimmer was in the state championships...shes only 12 by the way. So I went to her swim meet, not necessarily to see her...but ya know whatever. So I have this hella crush on this guy and I finally got his digits yesterday so I dunno I may call...I may not. I don't wanna look desperate. He use to be like skinny and now he's got the eight pack and the big muscles and the Timberlake facial hair...mmmmm it was great!  So like then I come home from the meet and theres this guy I swear to you guys he was like Nick Carter's twin. He had the old Nick hair thing the long hair like Nick use to have. Man it was great. So hes all talkin to me and he's workin in our yard all next week...I know you're thinkin a construction worker??? but no it's his summer job he's a sophmore at Clemson...how convienent that my bro is going there next year.Speaking of jobs I finally got a job...go me. It's only for like 2 hours day but whatever it'll still pay gas money. So maybe I'll be dating a college guy! Anyways so then I went to Sarahs house...shes like my best friend very awesome girl! She got a new car so we sat in that all day and watched Dirrty Dancing cause I'm gay and have never seen it haha! Then I went to work and put boxes together and did files for my dad's office...fun fun! Then I came home and talked to Roxy FOREVER but it was cool cause she's my twin and she's awesome!.....Fast Forward to Sunday

So today I was being a bitch cause I got up at 9:30 and went to bed at 4 so only 5 hours of sleep compared to my usual sleeping till 1 in the afternoon. So I was being a bia to my family and I kinda feel bad now but whatever. So we went to church and I'm SO glad I went today. Our youth group went on a mission trip a few weeks ago in Tennesee and the kids that went were doing our service today. They kinda made me feel bad that i didn't go. It was so emotional like they really really had a good time and became a family there. I watched two grown men get up and cry in front of our whole church because it touched them so much. One guy was all ""I'll never be able to look at these kids faces the same again without thinking of the mountains and the fun we had up there it changed me forever and I love all of these kids to death.""...it was better worded than that but it was like so good...like I was crying in the middle of church. I just couldn't believe how emotional all these people were and how good they felt after doing it. I think I may go with them next year...I dunno just a thought. It made me thankful to have people that were that caring and involved in my church. It also made me kinda ashamed that I didn't go with them...but better luck next year I guess.  So yeah today was a big nuthing I've been sleeping all day and I went to Home Depot haha cause I'm cool like that. So now I'm gonna go to work. I like this journal thing even if noone reads it it's still cool cause I can just say what I wanna say and not worry what anyone else thinks...and to me thats great. ~Caroline"

Also, I get to carve up a fetal pig for a Bio lab today, and that is gonna be pretty rad. I pretty much took this course to know whether or not I could do the dissections, and not because I care about biology in some great way. 

I've got to upload an incomplete draft for workship critiqu next week, and that makes me pretty sad. I wanted to work on it last night but wound up just sleeping a lot. Like, a super lot. Took a nap, woke up, fell back asleep, slept for 12 hours. Not I'm gonna try and polish it up on the bus while I head to school and maybe it'll turn out ok. Maybe it'll be crap. Maybe I can just worry about making it perfect later, right before I try to sell it. WHO KNOWS.

I submitted a few things to the liar collective this term, not sure if anything is gonna get in though. I might submit one last thing before friday, if I can find something good enough. I should really just go through my portfolio and grab the good stuff from it."

CLEARLY I&#39;ll be fit and healthy forever so why work for something that&#39;ll just be handed to me on a 6-pack platter? Teenage me would rather have a sword.<br /><br /><b>All of the internet</b><br />Some things never change. I have 50 Mbit now and I&#39;m getting 250 Mbit next year. It&#39;s the future, baby!<br /><br /><b>A soldering iron</b><br />Small repairs on every pair of headphones I own would become fun little afternoon distractions. Stereos would bend to my mastery of nature and I could perform science on things! This is a recent development (4 years).<br /><br /><b>Paper</b><br />All paper. I want a paper collection; weights, acids, shades of white, and all the wonderful varieties centuries of modern printing has spun off. The smell, the taste, the texture... a good sheet of paper is irreplaceable. Kids these days just don&#39;t read.<br /><br /><b>A nice belt</b><br />Every outfit improves with a quality belt in the mix."

I don't really have anything to talk about today excepting the dishes I did and the food I ate. Who wants to hear about how I watched a video and spectated someone playing ADOM with PuTTY? That's right; no one because it is boring. I spent a good twenty minutes this morning using a scalpel to dissect a menu I grabbed from a brunch place nearby. I really want to buy my own scalpels.

"event","I had a long post that, upon closer inspection, was just a lot of complaining about things utterly outside of my control. it boiled right down to wanting the people in the park to take things to the next level or go drink and fight someplace else. It was irritating enough that I would rather scoop cat litter for ten minutes in relative peace then listen to people bark and yell at one another.
<lj-cut text=""Whining and Insecurity"">Normally I can deal with it; I&#39;ve lived here for years and it&#39;s not a huge shocking surprise that East Van has parks full of drunks and young dickheads looking to puff their chests and fistfight for stupid reasons. Lately it&#39;s been a lot harder to stand, with school right around the corner (for the first time) and a frightening lack of money. Both my fault, to be honest. No one would hire me and I just sort of... gave up, eventually. I applied for jobs here and there but I never really expected a reply. Good thing, too; I never got one.

It&#39;s a lot of stress, and I can&#39;t help but feel like I&#39;m a sham; a liar to myself about my own chances at succeeding at school. I&#39;ve already accepted that succeeding in a writing program just qualifies me for a job at Starbucks if I&#39;m lucky. What the hell sort of chance does an author have these days when everyone seems willfully illiterate and properly ignorant, entirely interested in looking at pictures and Youtube videos?

I had a dream the other night. The sun was expanding into a Red Giant and I had the pieces to stop it, if I could only figure out how to combine them. I spent so long trying to make them fit that when I threw open my door, the sun filled the entire sky. The heat was overwhelming, my Cat, who lived at my parents house, was incinerated when she ran outside. I stared; I was too late to act and everything burned. I woke up after getting a phone call from my Aunts Boyfriend; he wanted to say goodbye. I told him I didn&#39;t have time to talk and hung up. It feels a lot like I have for years: Waiting until the last second to try and realizing that not only do I lack the knowledge to succeed, I waited too long to start.</lj-cut>
Oh great, they&#39;re at it again; Sounds like a lot of them and every goddamned one is piss drunk, looking for a fight. At least the Skytrain is close, right? Convenience is totally worth it, RIGHT?"

"event","2010 was the decade of the emulator; a long ten-year grind wherein I completed all the old RPGs from the 16-bit era I had neglected to play the first time 'round. Of all the games that made my list, only one escaped my completionist eye: Illusion of Gaia. That motherfucker has been taunting me since the first moment I played it, all those years ago. This next decade will be on the next generation of RPGs I wanted to play and never did.

It is a much shorter list; RPGs started to suck. Somewhere along the way they just got too wrapped up in trying to make the game easy while simultaneously trying to fool you into thinking their plot was complicated. Making up words and refusing to share a narrative doesn't make something complicated, just obscure. Beat one of these fucking games and you feel cheated: 40 hours of investment for what turns into a love story between two characters you really can't connect to.

This is roughly the number of Kilometers the solar system has traveled in one year on its orbit around the Milky Way. 

It seems like a lot of people are treating this year like we've come back around and we're right where we started, looking forward to a new beginning. Well, that isn't really what I think. We're not all of us suddenly free from the last year and all its luck; the only thing that's different from yesterday is a number on a calendar. Being free from any good or bad that happened in the past is up to us to move away from it and there is every opportunity to do so. Every moment we`re someplace new and no calendar marking somehow makes it more or less real. Lets all of us just move forward each second, try to make the present the best we can, leave the past behind us and watch for the future. 


That is the only resolution. I have."

"event","Gaming has been a growing concern of mine in recent months. I've been running a game for some friends but it's growing into a pretty bland endeavor as the game drags on. Part of the problem is the size of the group; too many players means less time on each one. Another part of the problem is how unfamiliar I am with everyone. They all feel like strangers who have almost nothing in common with me. I think it's funny that one of the people in the game complains that he feels like a sideshow attraction when some of his wife's work friends come over, yet that's exactly how I feel when I'm in front of this group. I'm watching the clock all night waiting for the earliest opportunity to get away from it all and come home. It wouldn't be so bad but for one last problem: not one of them is heroic in any way. I take my hand off the wheel and let them interact in a town without pushing them to do something and they just go berserk. The only player who really made me laugh in the game was a newbie playing a paladin. He was the only good-aligned character in the game!

They kicked him out for it!

Now I'm stuck running a game I don't like for a lot of unappreciative strangers who have no interest in adventure or doing the right thing unless I force them to. How is this any way to run a game that SHOULD be about saving the world and exploring the idea of noble sacrifice? I keep trying to find reasons to cancel because I just can't bring myself to be interested in the campaign I planned. I can't help but feel like I'm wasting my time trying to make it work, but this is the one thing I really, really wish would work out. I miss gaming in Maple Ridge. At least it was fun."

"event","The garbage truck across the street is pounding More than a Feelin' and it made my night a little better. Every night here is a little worse than the one previous and I blame the worthless dog-fucking students who make a mess, steal my tip jar, make too much noise and expect me to be Starbucks. If one more goddamned economics student comes in here and orders a venti anything, I will make it BUT I WILL MAKE IT SO BAD THEY WON'T LIKE IT HA HA HA. PUT THAT IN YOUR BOOK.

I was messaged on the facebooks last night from a fan of the old internet radio show of which I was a part. He's doing some shitty thing I don't care about and I feel like partly he wanted to brag how internet famous he was (although you, me and everyone you know has never heard of him) and partly to try and convince me to make a QCF reunion happen. I told him, in pretty uncertain terms, it was as unlikely as suddenly being internet famous for some juvenile sci-fi art thing that happened on facebook. 

Of course it made me want to blog, so blog I am! Not this livejournal POS though, a real blog. I have my own (which is neglected already) for my day to day nonsense but I am going to make a real nerd blog with my friend Trev. Assuming he can get on board with my stupid idea. Very stupid idea. I've been using my google wave to organize my thoughts and assemble an article I'd like to post up on handheld computing, starting with the abacus. I realize should PROBABLY start with the counting board, but there is little computing happening there. WHATEVER.

I also am hoping to get some help from the wonderful Tamsocalypse to start up a blog about really, really retard simple DIY crap that shouldn't be taken seriously.

I can't be taken seriously, even when I'm trying my damndest to be serious. Seriously.

It seems to me that I hate doing normal people work like some regular jackoff and would much prefer to do something more... free from jackoff-dom. I deletored most of the games off my computer at home to free my mind from distraction. This isn't going as well as I would like, but it is a little better. I want to write, and I want to feel like I CAN write. I've been stuck staring at the looming blank page for a fucking DECADE now and it really makes me angry. I feel like the inside of my head was scraped clean of good ideas in my teens, leaving the vacuous space that exists now like some stark reminder of 'use it or lose it' mentality. I've been neglecting writing, drawing, music and dance for the hamster wheel of Computer games without end; searching for that one skinner box that I can feel the most comfortable in.

I am 27 years old; that is too old to be a shitty do-nothing slacker barista fucktool failure. I want something published by the time I'm 30. If I don't, I can officially say I have failed my life and amounted to absolutely nothing. I would rather my epitah read 'Beloved author and threat to society' than 'disgruntled nobody; debt withstanding'."

If we lose to the US of A again I think we're pretty much going to poison the entire team. Except our Ladies hockey team. They are puck-shooting ROBOTS powered solely by victory.

"event","there are 20 recent entries on my livejournal page right now, the oldest of which is the middle of june 2009. I really should do something more active with this. Thing is, I don't have anything to say. I can complain, I can rant about nothing important and I can talk big about things I won't ever get around to doing. Ultimately, do I even need a livejournal for anything? Signs are pointing to 'no' but I still keep it around. Sentimentality rules.

So, dear blargh, let me complain for a while.

I'm exhausted; I am about 2/3rds through a 24 hour day and due to finish at roughly 7:30 am. I have what feels like an insurmountable number of boxes full of food to unpack, wrap and put away. I have a floor to mop and garbage to pick up. I have product to display. I have the nagging feeling I will be stuck in shitholes like this for the rest of my natural life. I suspect many people don't know how broke I am. I wake up early on my days off to spend some real quality time with the love of my life and it is getting harder and harder to slip back to a graveyard afterwards. Part of it is how amazing it feels to have the morning sunlight on my skin, part of it is how old I'm getting. I don't spring back and forth like a youthful slinky anymore, now I just sort of sit here like a worn-out stretch armstrong.

I'm one or two boss fights away from finishing Dragon Age: Origins and managed to drive away two of my three favorite characters in the space of 5 minutes. I could have reloaded a save and done it right, but I think I'd rather suffer the consequences of my actions this time. I miss Morrigan already.

Some days are better than others."

What do normal people do for their birthdays? Do I get to join some special 'you're old now' club? God, I hope so. I should start planning for my midlife crisis meltdown early, so I can get it just right. Maybe I will buy a kit car and build it in my backyard, then never drive it because I don't know what I'm doing at all."

"event","I've spent all night moping about how bored I am, reading depressing news on the internet, watching depressing students study and sleep under tables, listening to customers bitch about the coffee and all the while thinking to myself, 'how did I convince myself that staying here was a good idea?'

I'm thankful to have a job, full stop.

It is my birthday soon. I've invited a bunch of you without really knowing where I want to go. There's a pub just around the corner from my place I wouldn't mind handing out at for a while. I know not all of you can make it. In fact, I'm pretty sure a lot of you can't make it but I'm willing to bend a little. Maybe Sunday or Friday?

I don't really know, you know. I know.

Sometimes I like to have conversations with myself when I'm sitting alone in the morning. Usually I just argue about what to listen to and make up names for the people in the park. Sadly, my imagination is shot and the best one me and the Tams have come up with is Camo Granny. The only one I have is Dog lady. because she has dogs. in the park. She's a lady.

Fuck.

What does a castaway do to pass the time? Does he count the grains of sand or build himself a kingdom? Does he explore and explore and wander aimlessly until he sees a ship in the distance? What does a castaway do?"

"event","I am making a small update in the hopes that this becomes addictive and I start updating with some regularity. What is new with my life, you might ask?

Well, I've been trying to relearn the guitar and spend some quality time with my good friend the bed. Unfortunately the bed is a piece of crap and makes sleep more akin to ancient Greek torture. Me and the lovely Tams have been going out a little and doing some fun stuff like walking, hungering for delectable foods and watching hockey. I am not a very apt knitter. This friday we are attending the Da Vinci opening at the gallery like cultured people. However, we are ridiculous and will stand out slightly more than if the gallery were on fire. Oh! Someone was shot near where we live the other day, perhaps you read about it in the paper?

Speaking of me and the Tams, she has been uploading things to her Youtoobe account! If you have ever been curious what I look like in a small car built by Renault for children, that is the place to see it! 

Hey guys, a serious question and I expect a serious answer. Maybe even thought out?

Ok. Am I a hipster and I don't know it?"

I miss it, I do, but I just haven't felt that urge to play. Where did it go? Did I accidentally sell it for coffee?"

I don't even like coffee anymore; I just want to go home and spend a quiet evening with my sick girlfriend then go to bed at a normal hour like a normal person with a normal life.

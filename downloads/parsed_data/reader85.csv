"event","Ah, finally I can say it&#39;s winter here in Finland. We have enough snow now and the air feels crisp. It&#39;s cold enough to create this fog-like air that you can see just enough but not too far, if you know what I mean. The temperature is -8 degrees of Celcius which is 17.6 degrees in Fahrenheit so it&#39;s not really cold but feels cold after weeks of slosh.

Winter love. Now waiting summer...

"event","I&#39;ve been thinking about starting a journal for my knitting and crocheting. The thing is, I don&#39;t know if I should start a new journal or start a community. Journal is more personal than a community but I don&#39;t know how I should link it to my original journal. Community is easy to link and can be made to be more private than a regular community with posting access restrictions and even how someone applies for a membership. But a community is a bit too big for something no one most likely reads.

So what should I do? A new journal? Suggestions how to link it? Should there be a direct link in my sidebars below tags or should I just mention it and link it to my profile info? Putting myself as a friend is no option (can someone say conceited?), and the worst way to promote the new journal. Suggestions? Is putting the results of my hobby in a community okay or just egoistic?

All input matters.

"event","Today something wonderful happened to me. I got my younger niece to sleep! She's just eleven months old and very much a mommy's girl. I've tried to get her to sleep before but in vain. Today, after giving her some milk, I put her to bed and gave her her sleep-bunny and gently fondled her face. In a minute she was sleeping!

I was so happily shocked that I almost laughed. Of course, I still need practice when it comes to getting her sleeping, so that she gets used to me enough to fall asleep. I'm very close to both of my sister's kids, being a godmother to the older one and helping to take care of them whenever it was needed or possible but getting the younger one to sleep was something that I couldn't do... Until now!

Oh, so happy now. Next up, changing a nappy with number two. No problems with number one but if there's number two ... Mommy!!! But that'll be another story... *grin*"

Today my three-year-old niece came to me and said that she's sleepy. She sat on my lap and I began to stroke her back. In about ten minutes she fell asleep. On my arms!&nbsp;She made me feel so special.

"event","Okay, so I was at the local grocery today with my mother and I noticed this little jar that just made my day. Now, I'm a huge Stargate fan and if you've watched Stargate Atlantis you will get this. Now, it's not a perfect joke but it's pretty damn close. The picture ain't a good one since my phone is old. Cameraphone was the fastest option to get this gem online. 

<lj-cut text=""A picture of the jar in question""><img height=""600"" alt="""" width=""450"" src=""http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u297/reader85/LemonCurd.jpg"" /> 

So there it is. The label says Mackays Lemon Curd, 100% natural fruit, 340g, 12oz. Ingredients: Cane Sugar, Glucose Syrup, Fruit Pectin, Whole Eggs, Modified Starch, Butter (unsalted), <strong>Lemon Juice (3%)</strong>, Citric Acid, Emulsifier E475, <strong>Lemon Oil (0.18%)</strong>. It also says that &quot;CURD is delicious spread, excellent on bread, rolls, croissants, scones and teacakes. Ideal as a filling for tarts, dessert pies and cakes.&quot; It also says &quot;Product of Scotland&quot; and gives addresses, normal and webpage (<a href=""http://www.mackays.com"">www.mackays.com</a>). 

Now, I said that it's not a perfect joke since it's spelled M<strong>a</strong>ckays but it's pretty damn close. Oh, if someone just could write a fic where Beckett has a jar of this lemon curd at Atlantis. </lj-cut>

Definetily made my day!"

"event","I'm looking for songs for this mix-CD I'm making...<br /><lj-cut><br />Okay, so my wonderful brother-in-law got a little project four months ago. He bought a 1962 Cadillac and has started to rebuild it. So, I got an idea. I'll make him a mix-CD with bunch of car-related songs or songs that give you a nice feeling when you're driving. The only trouble is, I don't know that many.<br /><br />The one I definetily want to put there is Queen's &quot;I'm in Love with My Car&quot; (even thought he once said it's one of the few bands he can't stand to listen). And of course, then there's &quot;Won't Back Down&quot; by Fuel and &quot;Click, Click, Boom&quot; by Saliva (they give me the nice feeling I was talking about). But how about others? That's why I need your help. If you know any, please, tell.<br /><br />My brother-in-law mostly listens hard rock and metal but my sister said he listens all types of music. And they have a daughter (my goddaughter (I'm a proud aunt, can you tell?)) who is a year and nine months old so children songs are welcomed too.</lj-cut><br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Ps. This is supposed to be a surprise for him so, shh.<br />"

They're fooling around while I'm trying to ignore them (because I don't want to be seen as a perv). I'm having a blast, btw. And I need to go the bathroom. I've only been drinkin... well in Finnish it's jekkupatteri, which is Jegermeister and energy drink. Three of those and I'm drunk. I can still stand... I think... so it's not that bad. But my head feels funny. 

Even though they get me drunk (especially my b-i-l) I still love them so it's good. And I know that my sister will take care of me in the morning if she needs to so ;).

"event","At the end of OC's season 4 I started to think how big Ryan's family is. And it's huge! And on some lever it's really f*ed up. First there's his original family. Dawn (mom), Frank (dad) and Trey (brother). Then Frank and Julie went together and had a baby (as far as I know). Julie already has two kids (or had two, now has one), Marissa and Kaitlin. Ryan dated Marissa. Julie also was married to Caleb who has three daughters (not Julie's). Hailey and Kirsten are from one marriage and then he has Lindsay. Ryan dated Lindsay. Hailey dated Jimmy (or still dates, I'm not sure about that). Julie also was/is engaged to Bullit. Kirsten is married to Sandy and they have three kids. Sophie and Seth are their own and they adopted Ryan. Seth is engaged (right?) to Summer. Summer's dad is Neil. So lets count, shall we? Ryan has three ""moms"". His biological (Dawn), his adoptive (Kirsten) and kinda mom (Julie) through his half brother or sister. He has at least five siblings, two aunts, two dads, and a granddad. And they all have connections. I think the only ones not really connected to other family members are Summer (who is Ryan's sister-in-law or something) and Taylor. Her and Ryan's relationship was kinda left open. Anyhow... is really big family.

Peace out!"

And when that had happened, I've been starting to love her with Ryan. And now I've been starting to ship them. I still ship Ryan/Summer but now that he has Taylor, I can't imagine Ryan with Summer that clearly. Before, it was obvious. But now it seems the other way around?

Can I ship them both at the same time or do I have to abandon them both? Why did this happened to me???"

"event","I just read an ER spoiler.

<lj-cut text=""spoiler warning"">At the end of season 13 Ray's legs are amputated for some reason and he confesses his love for Neela. I seriously hope that this isn't true but I'm afraid I'm wrong. Neela brakes off with Gates but doesn't get a chance to make up with Ray. Apparently Shane West is leaving ER so there'll be no Ray in season 14. *cries* Maybe Neela moves to where Ray is going to heal and to be his doctor. And there are always prostethic (my spelling is horrible) legs. Too bad this automails aren't in this fandom, or that FMA and ER are pretty hard to combine.

I think my ship is about to die. If this happens, my ER series finale is on that episode where Neela and Ray are happy. So it's before that. I wanna live in denile.

But seriously, this (my ship dying) has never happened before and I start to understand about some ships that are mad at my ships and shippers of my ship. Like lets take Sheppard/Weir. Enough said.

Right now I hate ER writers."

"event","I finally decided to use the 'brothers' icon for my family stuff. Okay, maybe I decided it before but now it's official.

And for the good news...

I'm an aunt! My sister had a beautiful baby-girl yesterday. Her name will be Taina Emilia (if I remember correctly) and she's 8 pounds 7 ounces and 20 inches with dark curly hair. She's going to be a heartbreaker. We now have five generations in our family. My greatgrandmom is 93 years old. We need to take a family portrait.

Anyway, this girl will be spoiled. She'll have SEVEN granmoms. Three from her father's side and four from her mom's side. Two aunts, an uncle, and maybe four grandads. I said maybe because I assumed the number from her father's side. I don't know for sure.

She's just the cutest. I'm so happy!!!

I've been watching both Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis' latests seasons (10 and 3) and I've loved both of them. Today in GateWorld I read that they plan another Stargate series. I can't imagine what they haven't been exploring. I mean, another galaxy = Atlantis. Same galaxy = SG-1. Maybe they go to some paraller universe. Who knows? Apparently this series should be placed on SG-1's place since it ends after the tenth season.

I also read that they plan to make not one but two SG-1 movies that go straight to DVD. I buy them immeaditely if that's the case. Atlantis still continues on the fourth season.

On last Sunday, here in Finland, started this new anime series called Fullmetal Alchemist. I watched it and boy it was good!!! My brother loved it too and he's 12. I know that it's somewhat harsh or crude but I think he's old enough to watch it.

I've also read Inuyasha and I love it!!!

What else...

I realize that I've claimed a pair in three different communities and have wrote only one fic so far. I'm sorry for that. I try to write more. Promise!!!

<b>Author:</b> <lj user=""reader85"">
<b>Fandom:</b> Dark Angel
<b>Characters:</b> Ralph/Bullet
<b>Prompt:</b> 001. Sleep
<b>Word Count:</b> 276
<b>Rating:</b> PG-13
<b>Summary:</b> Bullet can't sleep and it's all Ralph's fault.
<b>Warnings:</b> One small graphic thing.
<b>Disclaimer:</b> I don't own anything from Dark Angel, I'm not making any money from this.

<lj-cut text=""No Sleep Tonight"">~

Bullet couldn't sleep.

He looked around and saw Fixit sleeping peacefully next to Zero, holding Bugler in her arms. Bugler had been having nightmares and Fixit had promised to chase the monsters away. Zero was motionless. He didn't move around like the others. Zero didn't sleep deeply, either, and even in his sleep he looked like ready to attack.

Then there was Ralph. She was the reason why he couldn't sleep. Ralph's body was pressed against his, her head resting on his shoulder and her arm was wrapped around his waist. He could smell her and her smell was slowly driving him crazy. She smelled like... like... wind at spring and apples. Bullet loved apples.

She was also very well developed X6. The X6s were not placed on the breeding program, not because they weren't old enough, but because they were created to be followers, so they first needed the new commanders, the X5s. Maybe few years later the X6s would have been placed on the breeding program.

They didn't know who the most compatible partner for them was. They operated on need-to-know basis and because they weren't in the program, they didn't need to know. But he couldn't help but wonder, if his had been Ralph.

Ralph moved slightly and tightened her hold around his waist. Bullet held his breath for few seconds and slowly let it out. Ralph moved again, this time bringing her leg on top of his. That simple move did more to him than anything else he could think of. His blood rushed south and he cursed.

There was no way he could sleep tonight.

"event","Okay, so today I got back from Chicago. Bought a lot of things, including five CDs. Three Queen's CDs (Innuendo, News of the World, and A Day at the Races). They are great!

<lj-cut text=""More..."">Other two are soundtracks of The Breakfast Club and Stargate. David Arnold's music on Stargate is magnificent. I don't usually like this type of music but I love this.

While in Chicago, I also went to the SOFA show and to the Field Museum where I saw artifacts that were found in the tomb of Tutankhamon (I hope I spelled that right). I also bought some things. A shotglass for my roommate (she loved it, btw), couple of things which I won't mention in case my parents read this (they are for them), a ring with ankh-symbol, and a necklace with the eye of Ra (or Horus). Ankh means life and the eye-symbol means protection and power.

Found couple of other things too. But I won't tell about them in here. Too lazy.

So, last Thursday I changed my lj-layout. Not my pictures or my colors but the theme. Mainly because my tags-page wasn't working right so I had to get them to work. And I did. And today I added two userpics to my collection. I made them.

Brothers-picture (which I use here) is from Oz. It has Ryan and Cyril, the O'Reily (I hope I spelled that right) brothers. I just love their relationship. I also added a 100_situations picture for my new favorite sub-ship, Ralph and Bullet. My claim haven't been accepted yet but I'm hopeful. Both of these new pictures were made by using Paint. I say Brothers worked out better. I may do another 100_situations icon for Ralph/Bullet to replace the one I made earlier. I'll use the same base but I'll change the text.

Okay, I don't think I have anything new to add, for now.</lj-cut>

Okay, so I've been reading <lj user=""missmara"">'s prompts (she joined this community called <lj user=""100_situations""> with The O.C.'s Ryan as her choice) and that has inspired me to write my own. So, I've decided to join the same thing. My choice would be Ralph/Bullet from Dark Angel. This is my sub-ship or secondary ship. I don't want to write Max/Alec simply because I wouldn't be happy with my writing. I would write them completely OOC. Same thing is wrong with every other pairing/character/fandom. Since Bullet/Ralph were only in one episode, I think the chance of writing OOC is a lot smaller. One chance is to make my own character but that just reminds me of Mary Sues. Even thought it would be interesting in Stargate SG-1 or Stargate Atlantis, but seriously, who wants to read fics involving with OCs? 

Oh, sorry that I didn't finish my last rant even thought I promised. My defence is that my brain was fried (it was after 1:30 AM).

"event","...but I have to do this rant. So click the cut if you're interested what I think after 1:30 AM.

<lj-cut text=""The scary place called I call 'my mind'"">Yeah, my rant... First I'd like to talk about my... ships. Like I haven't done that in awhile. Please, it's not that boring. I'll just give my rant on each of them. Oh dear, this is going to be a long post.

Okay, so I guess all my ships are some kind of variations of Romeo and Juliet. I guess I have to admit that Shakespeare was a good playwriter when he came up with that story.

Pairing: Draco Malfoy/Hermione Granger
Fandom: Harry Potter
Rant: Yeah... these two... I've always seen these two as a perfect match. I never saw any other pairing for them. I mean ultimately. I must admit that I've toyed with the idea of Hermione/Viktor, Hermione/Blaise, and even *gasp* Hermione/Fred. Not with George, though. Don't know why. They are their enemies. In school and in war. Draco is a Death Eater (book six) or going to be. Hermione fights with Harry. They are Gryffindor and Slytherin. But still they are so much alike. They're both very smart (Draco's intelligence was proven in book six), they are both only child in their families (I don't remember any mentions of siblings), and so forth. I absolutely adore this couple and there is too many good writers to just point one out. This is UC. When you don't like your fandom's CC, go UC.

Pairing: Michael Guerin/Maria DeLuca
Fandom: Roswell
Rant: One of my very first ships. CC (one of the few I got). They have this electricity between them that no one can miss. They fight and they make up. They didn't give in just like that. And what's more important, they didn't just decide 'I love him/her'. Max and Liz was just like this. Max was in love with her before they've even had a decent conversation. And after few flashes Liz was smitten. That's not how relationships form. Maria and Michael got it right. They fought, they ignored, they felt the attraction, they fought some more... And they got together. They got the order right and that's why they didn't have any (or so many) major crisis in their relationship. DocPaul is a perfect ficwriter with this ship.

Pairing: Ray Barnett/Neela Rasgotra
Fandom: ER
Rant: Oh, the Roomies. They're completely opposites of each other and still they work perfectly with each other. Even thought this isn't CC (I'd like to add 'yet' but I don't want to jinx it) many have seen how they seem to only complete each other. Not long rant but still... I'm tired. Too many good writers.

Pairing: Alec McDowell (X5-494)/Max Guevera (X5-452)
Fandom: Dark Angel
Rant: They fight, they watch each others backs, they fight some more, they trust each other, they were breeding partners... I bet on the third season (if there was gonna be one) they would've been together. I guess I'm tired because my brain is shutting down and I can't seem to write more of this UC couple. But a fic writer named Valjean is fantastic with them so check her stories out.

Pairing: Steven Hyde/Jackie Burkhart
Fandom: That '70s Show
Rant: Another CC. What can I say? Fight, push, pull, give in = another perfect couple. Brain. Shutting down. Sorry. Too many good writers.

Pairing: John Sheppard/Teyla Emmagan
Fandom: Stargate Atlantis
Rant: From the very first episode I was hooked on this couple. Not CC but I hope I can add the word 'yet'. There just have been too many hints on the show supporting this shipper. They are both fighters and leaders of their people and they understand each other. Plus the stick fighting. Gotta love the stick fighting. And they have trust. Again, brain is shutting down. I'll write more when it's up again. Too many good writers.

Pairing: Ryan Atwood/Summer Roberts
Fandom: The O.C.
Rant: My latest UC. They complement each other. They are good for each other. They have understanding and even thought they are so different they also are so alike. Who can argue with that? Brain. Shutting down. Check out lj-users missmara and bonnied.

Pairing: Charlie Pace/Claire Littleton
Fandom: Lost
Rant: I'd like to say that this couple is already CC. Ah, I'm going to say it anyway. CC. Some might say that first-time mother and an addict are not a good match but I say they are. Charlie needs Claire and her son and they need Charlie. They understand each other. They both have their shadows and dark closets and to them it's okay. They don't try to fix each other. Them being together fixes them. I can't understand why some people prefer Jack/Kate over them. Too many good writers.

Pairing: Jayne Cobb/River Tam
Fandom: Firefly
Rant: Both deadly, both has flaws, both has dark pasts. They so could fight each other's enemies. Damn, brain acting up again. So sorry. Check out lj-user lady-cleo2001.

Pairing: John Connor/Kate Brewster
Fandom: Terminator 3
Rant: What ever they did, they couldn't fight the outcome. They still ended up together. If that doesn't say it all, what will? I swear I had more but now my brain is fried when it comes to this ship. CC. Too many good writers.

Pairing: Wolf/Virginia Lewis
Fandom: The 10th Kingdom
Rant: CC. Virginia fights against Wolf's charms and fails. Happy ending. Saving the girl more than once. Mistakes are made. My brain is fried. Too many good writers.

Pairing: Lex Luthor/Chloe Sullivan
Fandom: Smallville
Rant: Again a couple that complements each other. UC. My brain is fried. So sorry. Many good writers, check them out!

Pairing: Connor Angel/Dawn Summers
Fandom: Angel / Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Rant: UC, since they never even met. They are different (Connor all dark thoughts and broody, Dawn is girly and somewhat happy) but still they are pretty alike. Again, brain fried. Many good writers.

So there are my 13 shippers. I'd give links to livejournals and webpages but frankly I'm tired! I'll rant more tomorrow. It'd be more than just shippers.</lj-cut>

"event","Okay, the new version of my web-pages is coming together really slowly but the number of fanlistings I plan to join is growing so rapidly I even surprise myself.

I mean, I have to take something out. In 'Relationships' category I have 13 listings and right now I plan to add one more. 'People & Character' category I have 12 listings. The other categories have nine, eight, six, and three listings. That means right now I have 51 listings and my primary goal was to keep it simple and small. 51 is not small group. And as I said earlier I plan to add one more relationship. And I just discovered this ship!

<lj-cut text=""More about my listings"">So... Why do I keep thinking they're worth to put on my list?

Lets start with the listings I've already joined. M/M fic fan... I don't know why I joined this. Dupe fanfiction... I'm kinda sad that this site has been closed and removed. It doesn't exist anymore. I really love dupe fanfiction. Don't know why, though. HP couples fan. At the time I didn't find Draco/Hermione listing so I decided this. Now I can quit that. M vs M fan... I kinda joined this one accidentally. It was supposed to be M/M fan. I can quit it too. I'm still a huge fan of the movie 'Stargate' so it'll definitely stay. And I'm a fan of Slytherins. It'll stay too. Stargate SG-1 stays, of course. Rath... is it hot in here? Rath fanlisting stays. Right now I have like eight fanlistings. The whole number is frigging EIGHT. So what are those 43 others...

I had to put them to categories so that it'll have some sort of order. The first one is 'TV-shows & Movies' (I'm so original when it comes to naming a category). Stargate (the movie), Stargate SG-1, and Stargate: Atlantis are kinda given since they are about my favorite movie and tv-shows. That's why I chose bigger pictures for them and put them above all others. Then there's Oz. It's brutal, I know but definitely one of my favorites. I think it's my second or third favorite tv-show (I can't decide if Atlantis is the second or on the same line with SG-1 which is the first). NYPD Blue. One of the best cop show I've seen but I'm not sure if I should keep it. I feel If I keep it I also should add Rescue Me to the bunch. It's the same with The Fast and the Furious. I don't know if I should keep it. The Breakfast Club. Very good. Not sure about it. The Client and The 10th Kingdom. The same problem.

Then 'Relationships' category. Two pictures will be bigger than others but it's not because I like them better. It's because there wasn't any pictures with both characters in the same picture in 50x50 size. If there isn't comment then I won't have any doubts about it.

Draco/Hermione (Harry Potter). Michael/Maria (Roswell). Neela/Ray (ER). Jackie/Hyde (That '70s Show). Dawn/Connor (Angel and Buffy). Charlie/Claire (Lost). John/Kate (Terminator). Jayne/River (Firefly). Max/Alec (Dark Angel). Virginia/Wolf (The 10th Kingdom). Lex/Chloe (Smallville). John/Teyla (Stargate: Atlantis). And finally Cyril/Ryan as brothers (Oz).

Some of them are slipped back in my mind like Lex/Chloe, Virginia/Wolf, John/Kate, and Michael/Maria. And I don't know what to do with them. I think I could join but somehow quitting is always hard for me. What to do...

Then there's the one relationship more I am thinking of adding. Ryan/Summer (The O.C.). I just found it few days ago but now it's pretty strong couple with me. I've always liked Ryan-character and I've had many girls for him. It has never been Marissa since she always rubbed me the wrong way. First it was either Theresa or Anna. Anna was sweet and Theresa was good for him but something in both of them was wrong. Anna was too sweet or something and for some reason in my fic ideas (I never wrote an OC fic but had some ideas) she died leaving the kid (she lied about the miscarriage, right? it's been so long since I've watched the show) with Ryan and Anna. Then came Lindsay and Anna had to go. But then Lindsay left so somehow everything became screwed up. Then I somehow got the idea of Summer. Read couple of fics, watched some R/S vids, and voila! There's my pairing. So now it's Ryan/Summer. Don't ask me why. But I am ready to make such a commitment of joining to their fanlisting? I'm so new in this ship.

Moving on. Next, 'People & Characters' and it's the people part that brings trouble. I mean I love the characters. Ryan (Oz), Cyril (Oz), Miguel (Oz), Riddick (Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick), Cassie (Stargate SG-1), Beckett (Stargate: Atlantis), Rath (Roswell), Goofy, and Donald Duck. I really like Jerry Lewis, Vin Diesel, and Eminem but do I like them enough to take them to my fanlisting list?

'Literature & Games' category is ok. No problems. Calvin and Hobbes, Artemis Fowl series, The Wishlist (I strongly recommend), Backgammon, GTA3, and Jigsaw Puzzle. I'm fan of them all!

'Technology & Places' is the latest category. Computers (the picture is bigger since I love computers so much), HTML, and libraries. Love them all.

And the last. 'Nature & Miscellaneous' category. I'm not sure if I'm a wolf fan enough. I love rain, wind, night, lemons, ice, fire, and gotta love Slytherins from Harry Potter. Maybe I should add thunder to the list. I love nice thunder or lightning. Both?

Just had to rant.</lj-cut>

I guess it's because my intrest in Romeo & Juliet. Also I've noticed that one of them is CC (Candy) and all of them are subshippers in the show or books. Roswell has Dreamers (yak! Max/Liz), Smallville has Clana (another yak! Clark/Lana), Harry Potter has well, Harry and his love intrests (Booriing) like Cho. And AtS and BtVS has this ultimate love couple Angel/Buffy (which has too much fluff and angst, I'm not that kind of girl).

The teacher keeps talking about webpages and making of them and it would be okay it the subject in question would be something I don't know of but I do know them. I've been making webpages for five years already as a hobby and he talks about things I learned to do five years ago. The BASICS!!! Whoop di doo... And as if that wasn't enough, the pages we made as an exercise on last lecture... Well, we made them with an EDITOR!!! I'm so bored.

Ranting, I know... But that's who I am. When I have something to rant about I rant.

Last weekend I saw who Ja Rule was and heard him rap. I wish I didn't. So bad rapper, so bad.

In 'Like Toy Soldiers' Eminem talks about how someone talked about his daughter and after a good two minutes in Internet, I found out it was Ja Rule. I was curious about what he said to piss off Eminem (although when it comes to Hailie Jade it doesn't take much - Eminem loves her) and after another two minutes I found the lyrics to Ja Rule's song 'Loose Change' and I was furious! That rapper is on my hate list, on my 'absolutely no' list. And I've never hear any his songs! And I hope I don't hear them.

Anyway.  There's a month or so left of school.  Things with Kathleen are going very well.  Mike and I are becoming obsessed with Mario Kart, and are starting an experimental jazz band with George Awesomepants Seibel.  Next year I'll be TAing again, hopefully be student conductor of club again, and i'll be writing my senior honors thesis with Dr. P.  And I'll be living in a Maytag box on Vine Street.

Come visit."

"event","I always seem to update this thing from the road.  Here I am at Caribou Coffee in Chicago, doing homework on a saturday with my good buddy Kristen Moore of the Chamber Singers.  Yesterday the Collegiate Chorale (which includes all of the chamber singers this semester) sang at the Central Division Conference of the American Choral Director's Association (ACDA).  We did a program of Indian music (plus one random Brazilian samba, because it's fun), which completely brought down the house.  Ethan told me that he had been deathly afraid that our program wouldn't be recieved well, that he would be thought of as the 'sell-out' of the collegiate choir world.  However, when you get standing ovations halfway through your concert, I don't think you have anything to be worried about...

Anyway, this trip has been lots of fun.  I've gotten to know some new people from Chorale, which is really cool.  We left campus Thursday afternoon at about 5.  Drove to Chicago, and got here a little before 11, chicago time.  Stayed up a bit talking.  I was looking forward to sleeping in on this trip, yet somehow my body won't let me sleep for more than 7 hours or so.  I've been conditioned this semester.  Yesterday we had our conference performance, then a group dinner at the Hilton next door (where the conference is).  EXCELLENT food.  Our hotel, by contrast, is the Essex Inn.  Probably not the worst place in town, but definitely bare bones.  We have old piping sticking out from the bathroom wall where Mateo thinks there used to be a beday (did I spell that right?)  The room needs a new coat of paint, and could also use some amenities like a coffeemaker and a refrigerator.  However, Chorale got us a deal for $25 per person per night, so I guess I can't complain.  

Last night I went to a comedy club with some friends.  9 of us crammed into a minivan taxi to ride across the river to Comedy Sportz, which was a competitive improve troupe.  The sketches were assigned like games on ""Whose Line..."" and then the audience would vote about which team's skit was funnier.  I came back and spent some time in Ethan's room, where he was basically holding court.  People would wander in randomly just to talk to him for 30-45 minutes, and then wander away.  This morning, Mateo, Marc (my roommates here) and I walked around the Magnificent Mile.  Which was a bit farther than we expected.  Our hotel is at Michigan Ave. and 8th Street, and it was at least a dozen blocks.  We stopped halfway and each bought 2 dollar earmuffs to make the walk more bearable.  We stopped at a place called Pizzaria Due (right down the street from Uno)  It was great, but SLOW.  Very slow, it took nearly an hour for us to get our three small pizzas.  Small pizzas turned out to be way too much for each of us...it turns out that they don't mess around with pizza here...:-)

I've had a lot of fun on this trip.  It's been especially fun getting to know Mateo better.  He's fairly reserved, but he's really come out of his shell to me this trip.  I've gotten to meet some new people from the Chorale, which has been lots of fun too.  Tomorrow we have another full concert at what is apparently the largest Unitarian Church in the city, or the country, or something.  Then we're heading back to Oxford, where I get to work with the Cheezies all day on Monday.

Speaking of which...CHEEZIES CONCERT - Friday and Saturday, Feb. 24th and 25th at Hall Auditorium!  8 PM, tickets are 5 dollars.  We're doing the top 5 requested songs, plus tons of others, included ""Until You"" by Dave Barnes, ""Uptown Girl"" by Billy Joel, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" by the Beatles, and lots of other cool stuff.  Be there, you'll love it!  I promise!  See you there!

Update:
I'm home now.  That Unitarian Church was TINY actually, but the concert was awesome!  The ride home was a lot of fun, with more new friends and some amazing old ones too!"

"event","It's been forever.  Quick update:  Christmas break was busy and awesome, as expected.  Went to New York with the family and saw the Producers and Rent.  Then to New Jersey for a few days with my grandparents.  Then home for less than a day, and off to Medina to see Kathleen.  Which was awesome.  Spent four days up there, then came back.  Got to see some of the gang for a night which was AWESOME.  Then it was off to New York again with the glee club.  

Club tour is where it gets interesting.  At the time of tour, Ethan's wife Siri was nine months pregnant.  Not wanting to leave her and go twelve hours away (where he might miss the birth), he decided not to go to New York with us.  That left me and Jason, the student conductors, in charge of the music, and the other officers in charge of logistics and keeping all the freshmen alive.  Good times.  There was also the minor detail that one of our alumni who failed to make concert arrangements for us called on Sunday night with the excuse that the church ""collapsed.""  Needless to say the church was perfectly fine, as we found out from other alumni who tried to go see us.  This cost us both a concert and a place to stay, so we wound up in a sketchy youth hostel on Amsterdam and 103rd for a night (some underclassmen spent two nights there) and then a nice hotel at 95th and Broadway for the rest of the tour.  Jason and I conducted concerts at an elementary school, and more importantly, St. Patrick's Cathedral.  It was amazing.  The group did really well and did a great job following us in Ethan's absence.  I saw three more shows while I was there -- The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, The Light in the Piazza, and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.  My thoughts on these will be posted later...

Ethan showed up for the last three concerts in Cleveland.  We sang at a church there, my group spent the night in a RIDICULOUS mansion on the lake, owned by three gay men and a random female Case student who was renting the guest apartment.  Slightly strange, but the most gorgeous house EVER!!  We did music for a Lutheran service that morning, then I left and had brunch with Jim Krukones, a family friend who works at John Carroll now.  We did our last concert of tour at another church down the road, and Kathleen's family came to that, which was pretty cool.  I rode back to Oxford with Kathleen, in what was definitely the silliest car ride of my life.

The semester started off at full speed.  Quick rundown of classes:

MUS 312 - Music History (Classical to Modernism) -- I LOVE this class.  Probably because i'm a nerd.  Dr. Green is an awesome teacher, extremely intellectual.  He's rapidly becoming one my favorite profs ever.  I've learned SO much already.

MUS 355 - Elementary General Music Techniques -- This class is fun.  Not hard work at all, yet (knock on wood).  It's half lecture, half playing 2nd grade music games.  Plus the upside is its all vocal majors so i'm friends with everyone in the class.

SPA 211 - Deaf Culture and Language -- This one is also awesome.  It's mostly learning Sign Language, with a little bit of lecture about Deaf culture as well.  Really fun, and Joey Schneider is in it with me.

MUS 189 - Great Ideas in Western Music -- I'm a TA for this class.  There are four undergrads and 1 graduate TA leading discussion sections once a week.  I had my first one today, it was OK.  Things will get better once I get the hang of it.  Or maybe once they actually open their mouths and talk...

Those are all the regular classes, plus I have voice lessons, Glee Club, and Chorale.  Which are the usual.

To sum it up, life is pretty good. Anyway that's it for now, stay tuned..."

"event","I'm here at work on the last day of the term.  I took my last exam yesterday, and thought I'd take the time to give a little update, since I haven't written since Thanksgiving break.  It's kind of a quick run through of significant events...

P.S., I apologize in advance to any friends who never want to talk to me again after reading this entry...:-)

--Last week I had four concerts in four nights.  Glee Club w/Orchestra on Wednesday, then the Cheezies did a guest appearance at the Misfitz concert on Thursday.  Chamber Singers winter concert was Friday night, and I directed the St. Mary's Christmas Concert on Saturday.  It was really stressful but AMAZING to do so much music in so little time.  I feel like I'm learning SOO much about choral music, conducting and about music in general.  Dr. Swift nominated me to be a TA next semester for MUS 189, the ""music history for non-majors"" survey course.  I'll be leading a 50 minute, once a week recitation section on the material, with a group of about 20-25 students.  I'm definitely kind of nervous, but REALLY excited.  The TAs get complete freedom to present the material however we want, so I'm hoping to get really creative over break.  There's a chance that I'll get to do it next fall semester as well, so if any of you still need a fine arts credit...MUS 189!

--Exams are over, they were OK.  Geology, EDP, and Vocal Ped had a few questions I know I missed, but other than that they weren't too bad.  My voice jury, however, was mediocre.  I just wasn't in the zone, I know I could have sung much better.  Somehow my voice just wasn't vibrating well, I couldn't find the right space.  Whatever, it's over.  And I know I did REALLY well on the Music History exam, like nearly 100%.  

--Christmas break is here!  It's going to be pretty insane, which is typical for these days.  I'm going home after work, and I'll be home for several days.  We're doing ""Christmas"" at my aunt's house on Sunday.  Then the family leaves early in the morning of the 22nd for Manhattan!  We're spending the holidays with my dad's side of the family in Jersey, so the parentals decided to take another little detour up to the Big Apple.  This time we'll be staying two nights, seeing Rent and The Producers!  Yes, I know there are movies of BOTH now.  Should still be awesome.  I'm excited to be in NYC over Christmas, with the tree @ Rockafeller Center and all that jazz.

--After NYC/Jersey, we come back to Ohio.  I'll be heading up to Medina for a couple days to see Kathleen (things are going well) and probably get paraded around in front of her entire extended family.  After that I plan to be here for New Year's Eve, hopefully with the third lunch gang...The next day it's back to Miami to get ready for Glee Club tour, in which we are going...back to New York!  This time we're branching out and spending a day in Brooklyn as well, singing at high schools and churches there.  The next day, we have a mid-day concert in St. Patrick's Cathedral, and then two and a half free days!  I'm seeing Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and The Light in the Piazza with clubbers, and we're supposedly on some wait-list to sing the national anthem at a Rangers hockey game.  We finish the tour with two days in Cleveland, then get back to campus Sunday night before classes.

Anyway, that's all I can think of at the moment."

"event","I meant to include this in the last entry, it's kind of just a random reflection.

Memory is a really strange thing.  I was taking a break while cleaning my dorm room, and I watched an episode of The King of Queens.  Kevin James' character and his wife find out that the engagement ring he payed $2000 dollars for when he bought it is really worth closer to $10,000.  Naturally, they don't want to sell it.  The jeweler keeps offering more and more, and they eventually give it to him for $13,000.  They buy a satellite and a hot tub, and a cheaper, replacement ring.  However, it eats away at them, and eventually they both feel terrible about it.  They try to re-create their engagement, and fail miserably.  Their happy memories of their engagement are tainted by selling the ring.

I went to breakfast at the Uptown Cafe the other day.  I had some unusual free time in the morning since my classes were cancelled, and my friend Amy works there, so I decided to go visit. I talked to her for a while, then ordered pancakes.  The pancakes were AMAZING, by the way, you should try them.  They're HUGE though, so only get one or two.  Anyway, I brought along a book to read: Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, by David Sedaris.  (Genius)  For some reason I was noticing how many memories were attached to one little thing, this book.  I remember running into Amy on my way out of Follet's the day I bought the book.  I was uptown buying the book in the first place because we had done our Chamber Singers concert the night before, and Bausano cancelled rehearsal that day.  My bookmark is a folded up ""Love Your Body"" pamphlet from the University Women's Center.  Inexplicably, Harry Bauer from Club was passing them out at the Phi Delt Gates...There's a Little Mermaid sticker on the pamphlet, because it Kathleen stuck it on my collar later that night when we went to 80's night to celebrate Julie's birthday.  I remember that it was the first night when we really 'clicked.'  The night I decided I liked her.  (Collective 'awwww')  She gave me the sticker because I had taught her to play Happy Birthday on the recorder for Julie...  

I probably could go on forever, but you get the point.  This is why I like to buy clothes when I travel.  They're better than cheap little souvenirs, but still bring back memories every time I wear them.  The blazer I bought in Germany, the tux shirt I got in Boston, etc.  I think that you should all leave comments about simple objects that hold lots of memories for you.  Good conversation starter... :-)"

"event","So Charlie Brown is over.  It was a good run.  Four nights, and almost each one was better than the last.  Sunday matinees are never stellar, so it's kind of to be expected.  I held things together pretty well on the drums, only one major screw-up where I missed a sound cue.  Kathleen came to the show on Saturday.  We went to Panera in Colerain beforehand, then went to the movies afterward.  (More on the movie later)  We headed back to Oxford, got food and stayed up till 3.  Great night

After that, I slept through Millet Mass.  Went to Hamilton and did the last show on Sunday, then rushed back for Cheezies.  That night was the usual 10 PM mass at St. Mary's, but neither Joel (piano) or Nick (guitar) showed up to play.  Bass alone doesn't sound so great, so I had to do my best with my mediocre piano skills.  The smaller than usual congregation was treated to some of the most frantic piano work Oxford has ever seen...luckily the rest of the group got through things pretty well.  I'm amazed sometimes by how timid both the singers and the congregation can be at times.  Some kind of pack mentality, they need someone to take the initiative and make the first sound before they;ll go out on a limb themselves.  I read an article once about how professional orchestras play behind the beat (ie noticably after the conductor gives the downbeat) because at that level, one noticable mistake can get you fined, or fired.  So none of the players want to risk being THAT GUY who plays before everyone else...that was kind of random, it just popped into my head.    

Monday and Tuesday passed in a blur.  Half of my classes were cancelled.  I think I walked uptown to the bank.  I think I had a voice lesson.  A meeting with Dr. Bausano.  A terrible audition for a solo in Chamber Singers (hint: never audition for something at 10 AM)  I can't really remember.  Nerd and I made dinner and watched Elf Monday night after Glee Club.  She went back to Medina yesterday, and I stayed late to re-organize my dorm room.  It'll be clean and new to come back to in a few days.

I woke up this morning, looked outside, and saw SNOW!  Happiness.  Then even better, Nobody's Fool was on TV.  Great movie, my dad introduced me to it last year.  It's his favorite.  I'm really excited to relax the next few days before the last two weeks of the semester kick into high gear.  Only two weeks of classes left, then exams!  Hard to believe.  A month from now, I'll be in New York!  I'm excited to hopefully see some of the old gang this week...I already IMed Meg about it, but for the rest of you that read this...we should go see RENT on Friday or Saturday!!!  Call me about it!  And have a great turkey day.

P.S. I used my spare time in the CIM to digitize a clip of the Glee Club from Channel 12 news a few weeks ago...<A HREF=""http://www.users.muohio.edu/oharawe/club.mov"">Check it out!</A>"

"event","So, I've cooled down.

I made a police report, to the very distinguished Miami Police Department, which strikes fear into the hearts of criminals everywhere.  There's not really a way to investigate a theft like this.  Oxford Police won't even touch it since it occurred on campus.  Hopefully they'll try to sell it to a music store or a pawn shop in the area and I can get it back that way.  If not, we'll hope insurance will come through, and I'll get a better bass than I already had :-)  I'm going for six strings next time...

I've been going home in the evenings this week for dress rehearsals of You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown at Badin.  The show is coming together pretty well.  There are a few scary moments musically, and one or two missed cues, but it should all be ironed out.  Hopefully with an audience in the house the energy level will go up.  The frequent little sketches need a little more energy and character to make sense and get laughs.  It should wind up being a good show though, there are a few really great moments.  Come see it, Thursday Nov. 17th through Sunday the 20th, at Badin.  

In other news, Cheezies are doing a promotion for our Spring Concert!  It's called Cheezies Request Live (CRL).  The ballot is currently up on <a href=""http://www.mucheezies.com"">The Cheezies website</A>.  Go there and vote for your favorite song out of the top 10!  The top five songs will be performed as part of a countdown during our spring concert!  Almost all the songs up there are really good.

"event","So Friday night was the Guided Prayer retreat over at Western Lodge.  It was OK.  The outside guy who was supposed to run things had open heart surgery this week, so Father Len took over.  Consequently, the whole thing was kind of thrown together.  It was fun, and offered some interesting things to think about, but overall it wasn't the deeply affecting experience I kind of hoped for.  Afterwards we went and saw Anchorman at AfterDark at Shriver.

Saturday, I slept WAYYYY way in and then Kathleen and I went to Kroger's and Hueston Woods, where we basically just walked around the trails and the beach for a while.  Came home and didn't have time to go out to eat before the Opera, so we stopped at Kroger's again and bought a bag of Lean Cuisine Pasta w/Chicken, and made it in the basement of her dorm.  We headed to the Opera with Marisa.  Cosi Fan Tutti was really good.  The set looked absolutely amazing -- arches and a raked central platform.  But almost every surface was covered in ivy and other textures, and the entire exposed surface was covered in astroturf, for a grass effect.  With every inch of the stage covered, the visual effect was amazing -- it was completely like looking into another world.  The music was good.  The orchestra occasionally covered the singers, but that's almost unavoidable.  The production was sung in English instead of Italian, which sounds like a good idea on paper.  People can understand the English instead of reading the supertitles, right?  Wrong.  Half of the lyrics were unintelligible anyway.  They frequently sing together, in counterpoint, and the lines overlap.  Combine this with the volume of the orchestra, and the audience couldnt understand half of what was said.  The staging was EXCELLENT (and hilarious), so it was still easy to follow the plot.  However, the production might as well have been in Italian with subtitles -- at least you would be able to read all the words.  Not to mention lots of the lyrics sound REALLY REALLY dumb when translated into English anyway...after the show Kathleen and I got B-Dubs to go and watched Hitch.

Sunday morning, my amazing weekend came crashing down.  I went out to my car that morning to drive to CSAB, to find my driver's side door unlocked.  (I OBSESSIVELY lock my car doors)  I got in and found that someone has rifled through the glove box, and its contents were strewn all over the front seat.  Same with the little console between the seats, except the top had actually been half-broken off.  Worst of all, the got in the back...and found my bass.  It's gone.  Someone stole my goddamn 800 dollar bass guitar.  FUCK!  Who the fuck does that?  I left it there a few days ago when i had to leave my car at Krogers because of the parking pass fiasco and didn't want to lug it across town.  Big mistake.  But no one could have seen it,  SO basically my car was the target of some random break in, and they lucked out and found my bass.  I'm filing a police report tomorrow, although it's not like that will really do anything.  I'll also be calling all the music stores in the area to put out an APB in case they try to sell it.  Does anybody have any other suggestions of what I could do?  As much as I would personally love to beat this jackass to a pulp, right now I just really want the bass back, and that's probably a lost cause.  

Honestly, you have no idea how much this pisses me off.  Why the hell does random stuff like this happen?  Who the hell breaks into a NEON, on Miami's campus, and steals stuff?  Time after time it's proven to me that the human race is not worth putting faith in.  People will screw you over every time.  Everytime I forget that, something like this happens.  People are shit.  Really, just shit.  This person probably has no idea who I am, yet they took the liberty of helping themselves to one of my prized possessions.  That strikes me as unspeakably evil.  I don't understand why (and this goes for lots of things) people can't just leave others alone.  Live and let live.  IT'S NOT HARD!!

I probably should cool down and then re-edit this entry before I post it.  Maybe take another look once I DON'T want the entire human race to fuck off and die.  But I won't.  I'd like to record this mood for posterity.  So I apologize if this is a little intesnse.  But I think with this day, I've earned the right to vent a little bit.

I guess I'll fill the world in on the big news of the past two weeks.  I've started dating a girl up here at Miami.  Her name is Kathleen, and I'm not gonna lie...she's pretty awesome.  I know her through St. Mary's.  I've been kind of out of touch with the world, including LJ, due to extreme busyness, so I might not have told a lot of you.  So here's the big announcement.  It happened pretty fast, we haven't known each other all that long.  We just...'clicked,' just like that.  There was definitely some uncertainty on my part at first, since I had convinced myself I didn't need/want a girlfriend.  A four hour conversation on a park bench took care of that.  We've been hanging out and having lots of fun.  I don't feel like this should be a super public thing (and I hate mushiness on public forums), so that's really all I'm going to say about the subject for the moment.  But I'm happy.

In other, less happy news, my IPod has suddenly stopped working.  With no good reason.  I was listening to it on the way to Glee Club last night, and then it wouldn't turn on on the way home from Club.  I can't find the wall charger to plug it into either (that apparently helps -- refreshes the 'firmware' or whatever Apple calls it.)  So I need to find/borrow a wall charger.  If that doesn't work, the nearest Apple store I know of is in Kenwood, which would be a huge pain.  I've heard of IPods crapping out randomly, but it's one of those things that always happens somewhere else.  To someone else's Ipod.  Not in my neighborhood...

The nice thing about having super busy Mondays and Tuesdays is that the week is nearly half over before I know it.  Tomorrow Mike and I and maybe George are going to look at a house, kicking off the great ""not be homeless bums in Oxford"" campaign.  I'm really excited to live with him again next year, I miss the late night philosophizing.  Thursday I'll be home in the evening for ""You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown"" practice at Badin.  I'm playing drums in the pit.  The show is Nov. 17th -- 20th (next weekend, Thurs to Sun.)  You should see it if you're in the area.  It's cute.  Friday is the Guided Prayer Retreat at St. Mary's, then Saturday I'll be going to Miami's Opera, ""Cosi Fan Tutti.""

Yeah, so cancel those IPod complaints.  I fixed it, thanks to the magic of the internet.  Have a good one..."

I feel like I've learned so much this year, about music and about running rehearsals.  My ear is getting better, and I'm really starting to learn what works and what doesn't work with an ensemble.  The Glee Club especially has been super supportive while I'm learning the ropes, and I'm really thankful for that.  (I especially appreciate all of Ben's LJ shoutouts!)  It's kind of like last year was my year to take all this stuff in the classroom -- Choral Techniques, Conducing, Score Study -- and this is my year to learn how to apply them in real life.  The Glee Club sounded phenomenal on Haec est Dies in the concert, especially the second night.  Everything clicked.  I'm not conducting anything for Club's winter concert, but I'm doing another one in the Spring.  Hopefully I'll get to pick the piece, and it should be an even better experience.  This success has convinced me, though, that I've picked a good career path...i can't wait to do this stuff for the rest of my life!

The Cheezies also really impressed me with how they rose to the occasion.  Especially Friday night.  It was the first REAL performance for all of the new guys that we have, and they did an amazing job.  Hallelujah was SO perfectly in tune on Friday night, and we really nailed What You Own the second night.  So not a perfect, consistent performance both nights, but we're getting there.  We're breaking out some new AND old stuff at the Acapella All-Stars concert next weekend.  I feel like it's a little more higher pressure, since we'll be onstage with Miami's other a cappella groups, and this makes it easy for the audience to directly compare us.  Count in the fact that the acoustics in the Multi-Purpose Room are not so flattering...it'll be a little touch and go, but I think we can turn in a good performance.  

The other big highlight of the weekend was Kairos.  Basically every minute that I didn't spend with the Glee Club, I spent with the Kairos people working on stuff for the weekend.  (Sorry I lost track of you guys, Madeleine and Reckner)  It was great, but very different than last semester.  I'm going to apply to lead for the Spring Semester.  Home team just wasn't the same this year.  I had my expectations set high by the awesome time I had last semester.  Not that it wasn't fun this semester, just different.  Things work out that way sometimes.  Maybe I need to be more flexible and have fewer expectations.  Either way, I'm excited for next semester.  And excited for other stuff that i'll talk about on our next episode...

Anyway, it's almost time for me to get off work.  This weekend includes hanging out with Mike, Maggiano's in Kenwood with some cool St. Mary's people (and one who's only kinda cool), and the usual waste of a Sunday.  Happy Halloween!"

"event","So, fall break was great.  I was LAZY, but I needed it like no other.  Friday, I went down and visited Katy at her new school, St. John the Evangelist in Deer Park.  I observed her 5th and 6th grade classes, who were doing presentations on composers.  They were kinda hilarious.  Then I helped her teach her K-4 classes.  We taught them about salsa music and percussion instruments.  We had them dancing and playing claves, shakers, and drums.  The Kindergarteners probably had more rhythm than any of the other kids.  They also had the most enthusiasm.  The other grades were still fun, but you can really watch the phases of growing up when you see them all in one day.  The lowest grades are just like little sponges, soaking in everything you tell them and hanging on every word.  Easily excitable.  By 4th grade they start to get less interested in what you have to say, and more interested in just banging on the drums themselves.  Then by 5th or 6th grade they started to lose interest in music class, and the 7th and 8th graders were mostly apathetic.  At least the boys were.  Music class is no longer ""cool.""  7th and 8th grade was a short period, together, and learning songs for the all school masses.  Overall, the day was lots of fun.  We went out to Kenwood for lunch at the Potbelly Sandwich Works.  I went there once in D.C., and I didn't realize that it was a chain.  Either way, there's one in Kenwood, and you should go, because they have amazing toasted sandwiches and Oreo milkshakes.

Saturday and Sunday really consisted of a lot of nothing, before coming back and doing Cheezies and Student Mass on Sunday night.  
  
The Chamber Singers and Choraliers concert was Tuesday night.  It went really well, even the pieces that seemed like they might fly apart at the seams.  Attendance was also great for a midweek concert, Hall was almost 2/3 of the way full.  We had a really great program for Chamber Singers, the perect mix of slow, pretty, fast, rhythmic, loud, quiet...As Dr. Bausano says, a concert should have something for your head, something for your heart, and something for your foot.  We really did have all three, and it turned out great.  

The Glee Club has all three as well.  In huge amounts.  I LOVE our Glee Club repertoire this semester.  And more importantly, tomorrow is my big conducting debut with Glee Club.  I'm definitely more than a little nervous, but I think it'll go well.  It's not my 'debut,' I guess, since I've conducted Club before. But only on tours, in Columbus and Germany.  But that was far away, in front of lots of random people.  I mean, the Columbus concert was at an elementary school, and the Germany one was at a casion...This time it's on the home court, Hall Auditorium.  In front of lots of friends.  You should be one of those friends!  8 PM, Friday and Saturday, up at Miami.  Tickets are $5 and $7 and going fast.

Last night the Cheezies had their first real gig of the year.  We sang at the Masonic Lodge.  For the Masons.  It was interesting.  We did five tunes, none of which were really suited to the audience.  It's funny, the Cheezies went from doing tons of 50s and 60s doo-wop, to not having anything in our repertoire from pre-1990.  Either way, they were super-appreciative in that way that old people always are :-)  It was lots of fun, honestly, to get back into action.  We'll be singing at both Glee Club concerts this weekend, then some serenades on Sunday.  The Parents' Weekend concert is in two weeks -- Friday, Nov. 4th.  After the Cheezies gig, we ran through our two songs for the concerts this weekend, and then I hit 80s Night with some St. Mary's kids for Julie's birthday.  The big 2-1.  SOO much fun!  

Recap: Fall Break = good.  Chamber Singers/Choraliers = went well Glee Club/Chorale concert = Friday and Saturday, 8 PM.  This week = good."

"event","Fall break is finally here!  I survived my hellish week of midterms.  Monday, I had classes as usual.  In my Geology lab, we took a 'field trip' down to Peffer Park.  It was actually a lot of fun, and we let out early.  Chamber Singers, voice lesson.  Took a nap, club.  Dinner with Ben and Mike H.  Studied EDP for a while.  Tuesday was my typical crammed full Tuesday.  I had a midterm in EDP, and I think it went pretty well.  On Tuesday night, I went to Kate's house for a study group for Music History.  After that I went over to St. Mary's for the first Christmas Concert rehearsal.  It went well, despite the small turnout.  I'm not worried, it started small last year as well.  I had some time to kill after that, so Christina and I hit Kofenya and walked around Oxford for a while.  Then I had Cheezies 10-midnight.  I let them out around 11:30 and Bill, Kristina, Kate and I returned to Kate's house for some hardcore MUS 311 studying.  We did listening examples and terms until about 5 AM.  Kristina went home.  I slept on Kate's couch, and I'm not entirely sure if Bill slept at all.  He may have just stayed up ALL night.  Kate woke us up around 7:30, and I drove her back to campus.  Went back to my room and slept for another hour, then went to the CPA for the midterm.  Thankfully, our marathon study session made the exam seem EASY.  I'm confident that I did well.  Chamber Singers and work that day, and then I crashed.  I slept from 5 to 8:30 or so.  Studied a bit, and then went to another Cheezies rehearsal, 10-12.  Came back to the room, tried to study, but couldn't focus.  I went to bed around 1, and got up for the 8 AM exam.  This one I'm not so confident about.  I didn't bomb it, but I definitely didn't get an A either.  Luckily I'm taking the class pass/fail, so all I need is a nice C average to get credit.  Again, not too worried.

I'm SOOO looking forward to having a weekend to unwind.  Even though there are already some plans.  I had dinner with Caroline tonight @ LaRosa's before coming to work.  We hadn't seen each other in a long time, since the first few weeks of school.  (P.S. I can't believe it's MIDTERM time already...half the semester is gone, and I feel like it's barely started!)  Also had a good discussion with the two other dream team members who bothered to show up tonight.  Tomorrow I'm going to Katy's new school in Cincinnati to observe/help teach for the day!  I can't wait!  We're going to teach a lesson on percussion instruments, probably half made up as we go along :-)  That's kind of how we operate...:-)  That should be awesome.  I'll be spending time with the family later tomorrow and Saturday, then probably back to campus for homework and stuff.  Time for bed..."

"event","So, it's officially my favorite time of the year -- Fall.  I love fall.  The leaves.  Jackets.  (Jackets are my favorite)  Wind.  That constant smell of hot dogs being grilled uptown.  Leaves crunching under your feet.  Getting dark early, and being light early.  

I wonder what it really is about fall that appeals to me so much.  I really think it's the memories.  I have so many happy memories associated with the fall.  Kairos last year.  The good parts of HS marching band.  Raking leaves (I have strangely vivid memories of doing this on lazy saturday afternoons in high school.  God I miss lazy Saturdays...)  Walking around Miami's extra-gorgeous campus in the fall.  I love the fall weather when it's just cold enough to throw on a fleece or a blazer, yet not so cold that you can't venture outside.  I love the way that school is in full swing and Oxford is HOME but the semester end is nowhere in sight.  I love fall break.  I love the VIBE, kind of a catch all there...

This weekend was great.  Glee Club bash was Friday.  I didn't end up making it to the symphony concert.  :-(  But bash was great, I headed up there around seven.  Hung out for a while, then they served Jack's sloppy joes.  Which weren't quite as amazing as I remembered, they're kind of just beef and...spicyness.  A LOT of spicyness.  Anyway, SKIT started around nine, and I was featured...twice!  It's such an honor to be made fun of in skit, honestly :-)  It was a highlight.  Then I went back to Shrout's room for a while and hung out, and we went up to the pink house for the afterparty.  Wasn't as crowded as usual, so I actually hung around for a while.  

Next morning I went home for ""Charlie Brown"" orchestra rehearsal at Badin.  That went well.  Then I went shopping with my family.  Came home, had dinner, and went to the Cincinnati Symphony.  

<lj-cut text=""LONG symphony review..."">
The symphony concert was AMAZING.  It was a mostly Brahms program.  Started with a cool modernist piece by John Williams, of all people.  Then they did the Academic Festival Overture, and Variations on a Theme by Haydn.  Intermission, where I bought some overpriced chocolate-covered peanuts in the lobby.  Then they kicked off the second half with an excerpt from the Liebeslieder Waltzes.  They had a small group from the May Festival Chorus come and sing, and they were set up in a really weird formation.  They two sets of risers, one on each side, in FRONT of the orchestra.  Basically blocking the audience's view of most of the orchestra (at least from our floor seats).  And the chorus probably couldn't see the conductor very well either.  The last two Waltzes featured the soloist of the evening, mezzo soprano Frederica von Stade.  She sounded great on these.  

Next was the Alto Rhapsody, which the glee club sang with the Oxford Chamber Orchestra last Friday.  It was great to hear it again.  The men of the May Festival Chorus sounded amazing.  They have a lighter sound than we do, it's pretty, but it lacks the power of Miami's Glee Club.  They also stood in sections, which I thought was kind of a cop out for a professional ensemble.  If college students can do it mixed up and sound amazing...Von Stade didn't sound as good on this one as she did on the Waltzes.  To be honest, I thought Mari (Miami voice professor) was better when she sang the solo last week.  von Stade didn't sound comfortable in her low register.  Afterwards, she did the Brahm's lullaby with the orchestra, and it was GORGEOUS.  It was only one time through, about a minute and a half, but it was seriously the highlight of the concert.  Frederica sounded AMAZING, it was easily her best singing all night.  

The closer of the concert was the premiere of Steven Reineke's ""Te Deum.""  Reineke is a Miami grad, and is now composer in residence for the CSO.  He's about 35 years old, sickeningly young for this business.  ""Te Deum"" featured the entire May Festival Chorus, as well as six extra trombonists spread throughout the concert hall for the fanfare sections.  I'm pretty sure I spotted Jaime (Miami's trombone prof) in one of these extra sections.  The piece itself was great.  Not exactly groundbreaking -- it was completely tonal, with a shiny, modern 'film score' sound to it.  But it was exciting, and well performed.  I thought the music complimented the text PERFECTLY.  The May Festival Chorus' singing was beautiful, and their Latin was absolutely perfect.  I would love a recording of the piece.
</lj-cut>

Sunday was busy as usual.  We had CSAB at noon, that was fun.  Father Len is back from having his stroke, he's living in the rectory at St. Mary's again.  He'll have a home therapist for a month, then start going to the hospital for outpatient therapy sessions.  He's recovering very quickly.  CSAB featured amazing food and wonderful people, as usual.  Then it was off to work (sneaking out of CSAB a bit early, actually.)  Work was quiet.  Cheezies went pretty well, then a quick break for dinner, and then mass at St. Mary's.  Then back to the grind for an insanely busy week.  I have three midterms in the next three days -- Ed. Psych., Music History, and Geology.  I can't wait until all of those are over and fall break is here.  Time to get to work..."

"event","Oy I feel like I'm too busy for life!  I'm really not, I just need to manage my time better.  Monday and Tuesday are always terrible, because i have TONS of classes.  Tuesdays I go straight from 8 AM to 6:30 PM, with an hour for lunch at 1 and 45 minutes between the end of glee club and my 2 1/2 hour education class.  This particular Monday I drove down to Xavier to observe my cousin Jessica's voice lesson.  She's a music minor there.  It was a little insane to drive an hour down, watch an hour lesson, and drive an hour back to campus.  But hey, the voice faculty here is insane, so it works to do insane things for insane assignments...On the way home I was driving up Colerain Ave. and couldn't resist the call of Graeters.  I stopped, ran inside and bought a pint of mint to take home, and raced back out to the car...only to find I had left the keys in the ignition, and locked the door.  That was definitely a highlight of the day.  Triple A was there in a half an hour and I was back on my way.  I met with Ethan at five and then had Glee Club at 5:30.  Afterwards I went uptown for Marisa's surprise birthday dinner at 45 East.  Amazing food there, amazing St. Mary's people...and amazing Ganache! :-)  

Tuesday was typically insane, then things have slowly gotten better yesterday and today.  I just wish I had more time to spend with random friends, there are some I haven't seen in weeks.  I feel like I'm too busy for life.  Dinner with Christina tonight.  I'm having lunch with Amy tomorrow, which is awesome.  But I haven't hung out with Mike in way too long, and Bananafish needs to jam.  Mike's been doing his cohort field placement, student teaching for two weeks at Schroeder Paideia in Cincinnati.  I want to hear all about it next time we get to hang out...

So last Friday was the Glee Club and Oxford Chamber Orchestra Concert.  It went really well, we recieved lots of compliments on our singing.  I sang the baritone part since my voice was still kind of screwy.  It was kind of interesting to sight-read during a concert, but lots of fun.  I thought the group sang better than they had in any of the rehearsals.  Mari sounded great as well.  I'll be seeing the Alto Rhapsody again with my family Saturday night, the CSO is doing it with Frederica von Stade as mezzo soloist.  They're doing some other awesome stuff too (Variations on a Theme by Haydn, Academic Festival Overture) and a Miami Music Composition grad is having a piece premiered by the symphony with the May Festival Chorus.  So I'm uber-excited for that.  A day off, Cinci with the family...should be good relaxation, which I need.  The music department is sending buses down there for students to see the concert for free on Friday night.  A bunch of chamber singers are going, and I wish I could go with them, except Friday night is...

BASH!  Glee Club Bash, the official kickoff of the school year.  I can't wait.  Even though it'll probably be an uber-busy night as I try to catch the University Symphony doing Dvorak's New World Symphony (my favorite ever), and then rush off to Bash.  Glee Club is going well this year, we sound great.  I can't wait for the fall concert!  (October 21st and 22nd, Hall Auditorium, buy your tickets now!)  I've been running rehearsals on ""Haec est Dies,"" the piece I'm conducting for the fall concert.  It's double choir, which is fun, but other than that, the piece is somewhat lackluster.  Nothing super exciting or fun to sing.  I need to find something cool to work on next week and make club love the piece.  In my rehearsals, club's energy has been inconsistent.  Today's rehearsal was low key, but they sang wonderfully on Monday and Tuesday.  Cheezies has been going well this week too.  We've gotten a lot done, and our repertoire for the semester and year is starting to take shape:

This semester:
""What You Own,"" from Rent
""Insomniac,"" orig. by Billy Pilgrim
""Hallelujah"" by Jeff Buckley (sung by Rufus Wainwright for the SHREK soundtrack)
""Just the Girl"" by Click Five
""Dust in the Wind"" by Kansas
and probably some from the next list...

Farther out there:
""Lullaby,"" by Billy Joel
""Feelin Good,"" by Michael Buble
""Somebody Told Me,"" by The Killers (just for you Mads and Reckner :-))
""The Masochism Tango,"" by Tom Lehrer
""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" by Deep Blue Something (is that the name of the band?  who knows...)
Either ""Bless the Broken Road"" or ""I'm Movin On,"" by Rascal Flatts...or maybe both.

And more stuff that we come up with..."

"event","Back in July, my mother discovered a <A HREF=""http://unfd2.ohio.gov/"">website</A> called the Ohio Unclaimed Funds Treasure Hunt.  It's something run by the state (the treasury department or something) that allows people to search for unclaimed funds under their names.  Try yours.  She found an old savings bond that my grandma must have given me when I was a baby.  We're not exactly sure how big it was to begin with, but it had grown to $1,900!  I sent away to claim it, and the check arrived this past weekend.  I deposited most of it in my savings account, but kept out enough to buy an IPod!  I got one of the 20 gigabyte sizes.  New generation, so it's in color and has the photo capability, which i haven't figured out yet.  But I have figured out Podcasts, which are brilliant.  It basically lets you download radio programs to the ipod and listen later, and it automatically updates itself when a new one is put out (ie, daily, weekly, etc.)  I've got mine set up to get morning and evening news, and movie and music reviews.  I love it so far, probably dangerously so.

In other news, we've had our first two Cheezies rehearsals.  Things are going well.  I'm starting to learn how to run a rehearsal.  We haven't had perfect attendance yet (now I understand my parents' frustration with the school plays...) but things are sounding good.  So far we've learned probably 90% of Kate Nolen's arrangement of Dust in the Wind, half of my ""What You Own"" (RENT!) and the beginnings of Ethan's old Harvard arrangement of Lime in the Coconut.  Bill Pendergast tells me he finished ""Hallelujah"" by Rufus Wainwright (Wufuth!!!!!!) and he's begun work on 'Beautiful Soul.'  I'm halfway through ""Lullaby"" by Billy Joel, and just started on ""Walkin in Memphis.""  So, our rep. for the semester is starting to take shape.  The group sounds good so far.  We have a massive sound, which is what I was going for.  The basses sound HUGE.  Details like tuning and blend will come in time, I'm not worried.  Dynamics are already starting to happen, and they sound amazing.  I'm uber-excited to get out and sing for people, I may try setting up a soroity serenade or two in a few weeks just to get out there.  Having such a large group is allowing me to add lots of complex layering in my arrangements.  What You Own will end up with about 8 parts going simultaneously, and things will only go downhill as I write more arrangements this year...

Glee Club retreat is this weekend, Saturday and Sunday in Dayton.  Ethan sprung it on me today in Club that I have to run one of the three rehearsals on Saturday.  A former prof and Glee Club benefactor died this week, and glee club was asked to sing at his memorial service Saturday afternoon.  So Ethan's taking a contingent of 20-25 clubbers back to oxford in the middle of the day, leaving me in charge of rehearsing the rest of the group for an hour and a half.  A little bit scary, but nothing I can't handle.  Then that night half the group is driving to downtown Cinci, to fight the Oktoberfest traffic to the Westin Hotel, to sing at the Music Teachers' National Association Conference.  Then most likely back to Oxford, and up to Kettering again to sing more in the morning.  Monday is my first day to rehearse my piece for the fall concert with club.  Again, scary...

Seems like I only get around to writing this stuff at the end of the week.  Last weekend was a blur.  CSAB retreat and then Caroline's house Friday night.  The funeral on Saturday, then some hanging out uptown and at Madeleine and Reckner's place.  Sunday was work, Cheezies, St. Mary's.  Which will be like most Sundays this semester.  Packed full.  This weekend is shaping up to be dominated by Glee Club.  But it'll kick off tonight and tomorrow with a Kofenya trip and then a music history quiz tomorrow morning.  Can't wait...:-P"

"event","Last Thursday, we held auditions for the glee club's a cappella groups, the Remnants and the Cheezies.  This was really my first experience running auditions, and it's stressful!  As a choir director, I'll probably be hearing auditions my entire life.  Hopefully it will get easier.  There's just so much to take into account.  The ability to be both a soloist AND a choral singer.  The voice parts necessary to fill in the sound.  General musical aptitude.  I tried to stay as objective as possible, but that's nearly impossible.  I found it difficult to stay open to all options.  We were looking to fill a limited number of spots, out of a large pool of auditionees.  Some people obviously stand out.  We also had a decent number that we could discount almost immediately, but it's the middle level that seems the hardest to work with.  Obviously everyone in glee club is a decent singer, since they've already made it into club.  I feel like some of the guys at the auditions were almost forgotten about as we went through filling in spots.  Most of the guys who auditoned were good enough, but we didn't have space for all of them.  If we had really compared every detail we could have been there for hours and hours.  I guess in hindsight I'm just questioning some of our decisions, and how we arrived at them.  We made them as a group, and it was tough to reconcile everyone's viewpoint to agree on a final lineup.  I know that there's still some dissent among the people who were overruled.  I'm not overly worried, I think the group is going to sound great this year.  But it was a trying experience, and I need to both get used to it, and find a better way to run it.  The a cappella groups also have a policy of calling EVERYONE to notify them of the audition results.  Which made for a lot of unpleasant phone calls informing people that they didn't make it.  Thank God Nick handled most of those.

Last weekend was a good one.  Friday night we had ""game night"" at Amy's apartment with a bunch of St. Mary's kids.  (I still call us kids even though most of us are at least 20...)  We played Apples to Apples and Catchphrase, then went up to Skipper's for a little while.  Saturday I went home for band practice, then back up to Oxford.  Sunday, Brokin Silence played at St. John Newman's church festival.  I still have money coming from that, Mike, I'm not letting you forget...Brokin Silence will probably be on hiatus for a while, since we simply can't seem to find the time to rehearse and advance the band.  The gig went well, we were a bit rusty for the first few songs, but it's comforting to know that we avoided a train wreck even without a lot of rehearsal time.  Monday was a pretty lazy day, I got some work done and we had a Labor Day cookout at the Pink House to welcome the new acappella members.  

The week, as usual, was a blur.  Classes, voice lesson, watched Finding Forrester with Christina, Heather, and Ben; more class, Mike and I and our friend George played at Stadium open mic under the name ""Bananafish,"" class, lunch with Amy, work, Kairos meeting, Kofenya, Fight Club...you get the picture.  Rants like this are for me more than my dear readers, I like to be able to look back and remember the things I've done here.  

I went to Ethan's house yesterday to pick out a piece to conduct for Glee Club's fall concert.  Out of the stack of spirituals and Renaissance motets I left with, I have it narrowed down to a few.  Ethan is making me conduct a fast piece, because he insists that I'm already good at slow and pretty.  Which I guess makes sense, slow and pretty is what I prefer when it comes to choral music.   There's a part of me that's looking for something cool to conduct, which draws me to one of the complicated, polyphonic motets.  I LOVE that kind of classical music, and these pieces tend to lend themselves to lots of interpretive possibilites.  However, one of the lesson's I've learned from Ethan in the past year is that music can be found in anything, from the simplest call and response Spiritual to the most complex fugue.  It's easy to come up with something when there's a lot to interpret, but with a simple arrangement I would have to take what little is there and make it interesting.  Maybe I SHOULD pick a simple one and try to wring a really good interpretation out of it.  I know that one of the other things I need to work on is an effective way of teaching and correcting notes.  Doing a motet would give me plenty of that to do, and would also let me put some Latin diction skills to use.  Glee Club is a little more intimidating to work with than an acappella group, and much more intimidating than the friendly neighborhood St. Mary's choir.  So there's another thing to consider.  I know that running rehearsals with Club will take a more tightly organized plan than I'm used to sticking to.  I'll be borrowing 10 minutes of Ethan's rehearsal time, and I can't afford to waste it, or the time of the 100 guys in club either.  There are different ways to challenge myself.  I welcome comments and suggestions on both this and my audition musings...have a great weekend!"

"event","So I've decided to take a little time to talk about the year so far.  I'm living in Elliott Hall.  Elliott and Stoddard are the two dorms of the Scholar Leaders program.  I applied and interviewed last year, and here I am.  The two dorms are almost identical, one for boys and one for girls.  It's a perfect location, right near the center of campus.  A short walk uptown, a (kinda) short walk to the CPA.  A short walk to the library.  Elliott and Stoddard are two of the oldest buildings on campus.  Built in 1825, they're supposedly modeled after a dorm at Yale.  They're heavily renovated, obviously, but the bathrooms still suck.  The showers are badly designed, although the fact that you can clearly hear what's going on in the other floor's showers through the vents is sometimes amusing.  They're both tiny for dorms - they house 35-40 people apiece.  Which means that when some people go home for the weekend, it feels almost empty.  I have a single room, and it's almost the size of the room that I shared with Mike last year.  All the usual dorm furniture (although Miami puts slightly nicer furniture in these dorms than the normal ones.)  I have a futon that we picked up the first weekend for some extra seating.  The room also came with curtains and carpet (again, the University likes us better.)  Huge closet.  I would still like to do a few things differently with the room, but its starting to feel like home.  

Classes this year are OK.  The 8 AM Geology 111 lecture is hard to sit through, but the lab is actually kind of fun.  Music History is not quite as enjoyable as I thought it would be, but it's OK.  Glee Club and Chamber Singers are going well.  I especially like how Ethan is moving faster with Club this year.  As amazing as the glee club experiece is, rehearsal started to get a bit boring last semester once I got used to the constant on-your-toes challenge of Chamber Singers.  Vocal Ped is pretty interesting and fun.  We're supposed to be making models of the vocal folds this week...I guess the EDP 352, 'Inclusion' class is the last, and it's pretty bad.  While the prof is the Director of Special Ed. at Talawanda City Schools and obviously has lots of experience in Special Ed, she doesn't know how to teach.  You can't just lecture for 2 1/2 hours, no matter WHAT the subject matter is.

"event","My weekend consisted almost entirely of St. Mary's stuff.  Saturday morning, Julie and I got up bright and early to go to St. Mary's and make a poster for music ministry.  We poked around Jeff's office to find posterboard and markers, and I think it wound up being a work of art, if I do say so myself.  The stick figures were crucial.  We had a nice little talk as well.

I worked at open house after 4:30 mass, and then went to Andy Moore's farewell barbeque.  Andy graduated last year, and was in Naval ROTC.  He left Monday for flight school in Pensacola, hoping to fly F-18s.  It was a small little gathering at his Miami Commons apartment.  It had probably been bigger earlier, but we were un-fashionably late.  We had burgers and some weird super-spicy metts, and played lots of cornhole.  How midwestern.  Some other St. Mary's graduates were there, including Fia and Dan.  Dan's big brother is Mike Cifuentes, the Miami grad/Marine who was killed in Iraq a few weeks ago.  Dan seemed to be almost normal for most of the party, in a very good mood.  But near the end of the night, he found a St. Michael's medal that his parents had given to Andy.

He broke down.  I didn't know if I should write about this, but, it happened.  He lost it, in seemingly uncontrollable grief.  And it made me think, a lot.  I was the only one in the room with him when he started crying.  I held him and fetched him tissues, but what the hell can you do? He apologized several times for crying, but he's more than within his rights to cry.  I listened and did my best to be supportive, but I know nothing anyone, especially some dumb underclassman he doesn't even know very well, can say will help.  You can't say ""It's OK,"" because it's not.  I can't say ""I understand,"" because I don't.  I can't even IMAGINE what it would feel like to lose a sibling like that.  It has to be one of the hardest things in the world.  It must just be completely numbing, shattering.  I realize that I've never had anyone very close to me die.  Mike Hayes' funeral was rough, and Mallory's accident was like getting the wind knocked out of me for a few days.  But losing a sibling must be like losing a limb.  And the circumstances don't help either.  Something so senseless and random as war.  I can't imagine how it must overshadow every day, and shake your faith to the ground.  I doubt it would have been much consolation for me to say I think his brother died for a good cause, and it would also be about the most tasteless time in the world to tell him that I hate the war.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't.  I don't mean to focus on myself, but it's one of those moments where you realize that all the stupid things that happen in your life just DO NOT MATTER in the grand scheme of things.  I had a lot on my mind, and it all just seems trivial right now.  At least my sister is alive.  And my parents, and grandparents.  I have a roof over my head, plenty of food, all my limbs, and the opporunity to get a college education.  Fuck worrying about girls and grades and money.

I was too drained after this go up to Kofenya with Megan and Madeleine (also didn't feel like going into it on the phone, sorry Reckner).  After that night, Sunday was busy but pretty uneventful.  I woke up early to do two more St. Mary's open houses, then worked at the CIM from 2-5.  I went home to get a bass for church (forgetting about Mike's barbeque that I had planned to go to), then came back for another open house and then 10 o'clock mass.  10 O'clock was nice and full this week, I had been worried about the future of late masses last week when it was only half-capacity.

Monday and Tuesday were also normal days.  Monday I had a really great voice lesson to kick off the year, and make me hate the voice studies department slightly less than I usually do.  Monday was also the first real night of glee club this year, which was amazing as usual.  When we sang ""Prayer of the Children,"" I got real chills from hearing Club, which hasn't happened for a while.  I think that's a sign of good things to come for Club.  And a sign that the fall concert, Oct. 21st and 22nd, is going to be amazing, and you should come.  Tuesday, it rained ALL day.  That's basically all I remember.  It was a blur of class and water from 8 to 6:30.  Had a long walk with my friend Christina from St. Mary's, where we again talked about today's theme, letting go of control and just taking things as they come.  Everything happens for a reason.  ""Let go and let God.""  Which is harder than it sounds.  But I'm trying."

"event","Picking up where I left off, I finally made it through a full rotation of classes.  It turns out that Ben and Kate are NOT in my EDP class, they must be in a different section that meets at the same time.  That class was INSANELY boring, the prof lectured for most of the 2 1/2 hour period.  That night I visited Madeleine and Reckner in their new apartment, which is pretty sweet in all its 70s glory, brown wood paneling and all.  Wedensday morning brought me Music History class.  A big lecture by a soft-spoken prof in big, poorly lit Souers Hall.  Despite this, it should be a decent class.   I love the material.  My dad came up and took my mom and me to Bdubs uptown, since he doesn't start school until Monday.  After that I did three hours in the CIM.  

Wedensday night we had the first CSAB (Catholic Student Advisory Board) meeting of the year at St. Mary's.  The first with the new campus minister, and one of the first with Fr. Len, since he was on sabbatical last semester.  Now that I think back, I don't think Fr. Len ever came to the meetings when Cotter was still Campus Minister...yet another disturbing trend I guess.  I didn't think the meeting went so well.  First of all, it was FAR too long, and our attention/motivation was gone by the second half.  Jeff and Fr. Len seem to want to change too much, too fast.  At times Fr. Len seemed to be taking too much control, using Jeff as his little puppet.  And I don't know if either of them has much of an understanding of how the students fit into St. Mary's.  Yes, we all love it and each other and most of us hang out together a lot outside of the church.  But I don't think many of us don't want events EVERY Wedensday and Friday, plus some Saturdays, plus yadda yadda yadda.  Maybe that's just my opinion.  I don't think they have a very clear agenda, and they haven't thought through a lot of the changes that they want to make.  Jeff didn't facilitate the meeting very well, allowing too much time for completely unstructured conversation (it doesn't really qualify as debate).  I don't know, maybe I and the other students need to be willing to compromise a little.  Sunday night at mass I felt like everything was far TOO different here this year.  The graduates left huge holes, especially Katy, and lots of my friends weren't there that night for various reasons.  I quickly got into the swing of the school year, but Weds. night briefly shook my faith again.  I'll get into the groove, and once the ball gets rolling I think we'll be OK, because I think the big talk will go away when it comes down to actually getting stuff done.

Thursday was more full day of classes.  Boring (but easy) Geology, more coloring in Vocal Ped, the resurrection of my love/hate relationship with the voice studies department at Vocal Forum, and then auditions in Chamber Singers.  I'm SOOOOO excited about Chamber Singers this semester!  Bausano held callbacks for new members, and they sang two pieces with us.  The music was really cool, especially a modernist setting of the Our Father, by Gwenyth Walker, and a GORGEOUS GORGEOUS spiritual by Moses Hogan.  Bausano just happened to call back enough people to perfectly fill out the ranks (six of each voice part), and nobody was cut.  So the Chamber Singers are back up to a full complement of 24 members, and we sound amazing.  It's especially great to have a full bass sound again.  This year, we're doing a set of Spanish pieces, but even cooler, we're doing a set of Russian music.  I LOVE slavonic church music.  We've been asked to perform at a dinner reception when Mikhail Gorbechev comes to campus for a lecture this semester!  Should be sweet.  Afterwards I had a long lunch with Amy at Encore, my first stir fry of the year.  Good to see her again.  Bought some books on Amazon, hopefully they'll arrive sometime at the beginning of next week so I won't end up too too far behind..."

"event","The school year has gotten off to an appropriately busy start.  Yesterday morning I had Glee Club rehearsal, a break for lunch (at the Shriver Center) and then we sang for the University Convocation.  They did it slightly differently this year, and they had us sitting front and center instead of off to the side.  And they had us FACING the audience, literally 5 feet across from the first row.  Which made for some pretty awkward staring contests during the assembly.  It also let the audience watch a few clubbers fall asleep...

After that, Ethan took me, Jason Sleppy, Kevin Lambert, and Tanesha out to Kofenya for our student conductor's meeting.  The main point of the meeting was to tell us that his wife is pregnant!  So musical genius baby #1 is due in January, and he wants the student conductors to be prepared to take on more responsibility in case he has to miss things.  Like Winter Tour, which is a week before the kid is due.  Hopefully it won't come to that, but it's cool to be trusted.  As the Kofenya meeting broke up, I was flagged down by none other than Chris Ahn, who was sitting across the shop with his laptop.  I talked to him for a minute or two before he kicked me out so he could do a conference call or something.  Apparently he's a big deal whereever it is he works now...

I did dinner with some Stelliott folks, and then we all would up over in Stoddard playing Nintendo.  College students are easily amused.  Ulanski called as he was getting into town, and I went to his new apartment to help him get things set up, since he didn't get back from DC until yesterday.  He lives in the new Heritage Commons on-campus apartments.  Yeah, the super expensive ones.  The super SWEET ones.  The place is huge and fully furnished.  Needs some decorations though, its all cold, white and sterile so far.  But the buildings are beautiful.  Angie showed up before too long, as did Megan Falk and then Chris.  It turned into a regular reunion!  We ventured down campus for some Tuffy's (snack shop in Shriver Center).  The snack shop that until recently, was 24 hours!  They're closing Tuffy's at midnight now!  And they got rid of the grill as well.  Tuffy's is across the street from our old dorm, and basically defined our sophomore year.  Mike and I were devastated, although nobody else in the group really got the significance of this momentous tragedy.  Honestly, a world where you can't buy a Clinton (grilled cheese and pizza sandwich) at three AM is just not a world I want to live in.  Supposedly Tuffy's was losing the university money, so they're cutting hours.  In other news, the library now will be open 24 hours a day.  Where are the priorities around here? :-P  We returned to the apartment with only drinks and cookies, and watched a Dave Chappelle DVD.  Who, as Mike pointed out, looks like Richard Prior now that he's grown a mustache.

Today was the first day of classes.  I walked into my 8 AM Geology lecture to find another voice major there, so that class should be tolerable.  Somewhat interesting, it could definitely be worse.  The prof definitely reminds me of somebody's easy going grandfather or something.  10 AM Vocal Physiology should be fun.  A nice small class of ten people, we spent the whole hour coloring diagrams of larynxes.  The prof has moments where she channels Grace Adler from Will and Grace.  I don't know WHY i think this but it popped into my head several times.  Just the way she says certain things.  Kristina and/or Ben, am I totally crazy to think this about Alison?  Had a long break for lunch afterwards, since voice studio and Chamber Singers won't meet till next week.  This year my dorm is right across the street from Belltower Place, one of the dining halls.  I'm starting to realize that belltower really doesn't have a nice non-busy time to go eat.  It's pretty packed every time I'm in there so far.  Dannie Ball works at Belltower, I don;t think I mentioned our reunion Sunday afternoon while I was moving in.  She nearly broke me in half with a ten minute hug, but its all good :-)  Anyway, it's off to my last class of the day.  Because I just didn't get enough of Educational Psychology over the summer.  At least Ben and Kate Nolen are in this one with me, it should make a 2 1/2 hour class tolerable..."

"event","Prologue -- Denver, Colorado, August 2005

So, a few days ago I ventured out to Denver, Colorado with some friends from school for Katy and Mike's wedding.  Except for Erin and Andy, who had the sense to fly, we drove from Cincinnati to Denver in a rented Honda Civic.  Four doors, yes, but still a sardine can when you have to spend 18 hours in it.  We left Tuesday night from Cincinnati, and returned the next Monday morning.  I'm not going to bore everyone with details.  Suffice to say there was some shopping, MANY restaurants, a day in the mountains, more restaurants, and, of course, the wedding!

It was very strange to watch one of my closest friends get married.  Just months ago Katy and I were taking walks around Oxford and practicing conducting together long into the night.  Now, after not seeing each other all summer, suddenly she's getting married.  She's becoming an ADULT.  I think the most surreal moment was watching her get her picture taken with the two little girls who were passing out programs, before the wedding.  Katy, who is only two years older than me was suddenly THE BRIDE, and all the little girls wanted to be like her.  She suddenly looked so grown up at that moment, because I could envision how grown up she would have looked to me when I was that age.  To myself, I look the same as I did when I was in high school.  So do all my friends.  For years all I've been able to percieve is the freshmen getting younger and younger each year, while we stay the same.  When my mother was my age she had just gotten <em>engaged</em>.  Kind of an eye-opener.  The wedding itself was beautiful.  The church was modern, something like Sacred Heart in Fairfield.  A hexagonal ""theatre in the round"" set-up.  The priest gave an excellent homily about love.  The music was great, including a piece composed by Katy herself.  The reception was in the parish center across the parking lot, and it was about the fastest moving wedding reception I've ever been to.  Food-toast-dance-cake-bouqet-home in about 2 1/2 hours.

Denver itself is a beautiful city.  Downtown was very clean, and everything seemed shiny and new.  I'm pretty sure the city was founded in the 1850s, but the only evidence of the past was the old statehouse
building.  Everything else downtown was all tinted windows and skywalks.  The 16th Street Mall was a highlight.  The whole length of 16th street, running right through the heart of downtown, is reserved for pedestrians only.  They have free shuttle buses going the entire length, and the street is packed with shops, restaurants, a movie theatre, etc.  We spent lots of time there.  The interstate was strangely nice as well, as nice looking as a highway can be.  It had well labelled, sandstone overpasses and embossed sound barriers on the sides.  Since I'm going into detail describing a ROAD, you can tell it was very noticable.  Our hotel was in a busy suburban shopping district, with shopping malls, car dealerships, and tons of restaurants, about 20 minutes south of downtown.  Apart from the fact that 80% of the city seems to be under construction at any given time, it was an amazing place for a vacation.    

All in all, it was a strange week.  I remember saying before I left that I had no idea what to expect.  And I guess that's partially true, but I definitely knew how I was hoping it would go.  And not everything fit into that hope.  Some aspects were amazing, and went better than I could have dreamed.  Others definitely didn't.  Our little group of six interacted (and sometimes clashed) in strange ways.  The trip definitely felt longer than six days.  Living in a hotel room for 4 nights with the same people feels like 4 months.  Little dramas pop up, unfold, and disappear in microcosm.  The bathroom is trashed, and seems to be occupied 24/7.  Television channels change faster than Denver weather.  Which changes faster than SW Ohio weather, for your reference.  EVERYTHING is blown out of proportion, both good and bad...or is it?  Either way, I guess I'll have to wait till everyone is together again (probably tonight, first student mass of the year) to see how the trip really went.  

I'm all moved in to Elliott Hall.  The folks and I got up here around 10.  They helped unload the car, then went to church while I organized things.  They came back, took me to WalMart, and bought me lots of new junk, including the futon which is now taking up more than its share of space in the corner.  Also took more than its share of elbow grease from my dad and me to put together.  But that's over now.  It's time to get things settled in, and head to the orientation meeting in an hour.  School starts Tuesday, and I've got a busy day tomorrow to kick off my busy year.  Cheers!"

"event","It's been all week since a real entry.  Monday night ended up being my last night at Coldstone.  I had planned to work there all the way up through Saturday, but the manager got her wires crossed (which is pretty common...) and marked me off the schedule for the entire week, so Monday was it.  She called the next day asking if I would come and fill in, but I was in class.  Darn.  Now I've got the CIM thing to replace it and carry me into the school year.

Weds night I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with the family.  It was good, honestly better than I expected.  I don't even know if I've seen the old one all the way through but i remember hating/being creeped out by what I have seen.  Gene Wilder in a big hat, and lots of creepy 70s special effects, and bratty kids dying in twisted ways...I loved how snippy Willy Wonka was to the kids, that was some of the funniest stuff in the movie.  I enjoyed the brighter-than-life color and detail--the movie was amazing to look at, from the Buckets' rundown shack to the bright blue and white nut-sorting room.  I guess that's what you expect from Tim Burton.  The grandfather (old man from Waking Ned Devine) was also brilliant.  In general, I liked Johnny Depp in the movie a lot more than I thought I would.  He was good in Finding Neverland, but downright irritating in Pirates of the Carribean (I may have people jumping down my throat for not being a Johnny Depp fan...sorry...:-P) He was a lot different than the creepy Michael Jackson-like character that the trailers led me to expect.  

Afterwards we hit up Flubs where Kara and Meg gave us delicious ice cream.  But no candy eyes this time...:-(

Thursday was the last day of Ed. Psych class.  We had a cookout.  Par for the course.  Talked a bit about how the class went, as our ""exam,"" then our prof skipped out way early.  He and his wife were planning to drive through the night to South Carolina.  I still haven't really made up my mind about that course.  I think I learned a lot from a practical standpoint -- classroom management, interpersonal relationships, educational philosophy.  However, I don't think I got many of the details, and almost none of the ""book knowledge.""  Virtually nothing on Piaget, Skinner, any of those guys.  It could be argued that these things are not essential to being an effective teacher.  This was obviously Greeson's standpoint.  I'm just worried that these things WILL be essential to passing the Praxis exam and actually getting my teaching license!!  I picked some of it up on my own through using the textbook (I'm so glad I only checked it out from the library instead of buying it), but to be honest, who has the motivation to really sit down and teach themselves educational psychology out of a dry textbook, especially in the summer?  I know that college involves lots of outside work, but at least SOME work needs to be done in the classroom!  I understand and agree with his theories that pressure and rules (i.e. lectures, pop quizzes, and even details like being there right on time) can be counterproductive to learning.  But I think most students, myself included, need to be held accountable SOMETIMES.  Greeson wouldn't have cared if we had spent six weeks having food fights and watching M*A*S*H reruns.  We still would have all gotten As.  I think I did a reasonable job keeping myself on-track, slogging through the text and the supplemental materials.  But I know I could have gotten a lot more out of it, and I know that I had classmates who didn't do a damn thing all six weeks, and are still getting by with A's or B's.  We spent two entire class periods watching movies (The Breakfast Club and Dangerous Minds) and two eating, plus the first day of class, where nothing ever gets done.  This is kind of a half baked rant, but I sort of feel like this professor did us a bit of a disservice.  I'm too tired to finish this thought now (I already wrote the rest of the entry, I went back and expanded upon this middle paragraph) so I'm headed to bed.  More later.

Today was a lazy day mostly, but I spent a lot of it getting things in order for Denver/School.  Bank, dry cleaners, cleaning the room...Then Mike called me up and I went over to his house, where we had the first real band practice of the summer.  Which was AWESOME, I've SO missed jamming with the band.  We were all getting burned out second semester and it was good to have a little time off.  Now we're back with a vengence, with another practice Sunday and a gig scheduled for Sunday of Labor Day weekend, our annual appearance at the St. John Newman's festival (corner John Grey & Mill Rd, Fairfield -- be there!)

Now I'm off to call my cell phone from the house line so I can find it..."

"event","Hi kids.  Kristina already posted a similar question on her LJ, I'm actually stealing the idea to post it from her...

Misfitz and Cheezies (her a capella group and my a capella group) are doing a joint concert this coming semester up at Miami, and we're looking for songs to do together.  Can anyone come up with suggestions for good male/female group or duet songs to do?  We already have some ideas but it can't hurt to ask the larger community...

On a similar note, I'm looking for tunes for the Cheezies to do, since I'm musical director this year.  Again I've got some already arranged, but I'm trying to expand the repertoire.  I'm mainly just stuck on finding songs that fit.  The best a capella songs are popular/recognizable, catchy, and easy to pull off with just voices (ie - horns and pianos good.  guitar solos bad)  I'm probably being too self critical, in that I shoot down all my own ideas as too obscure, too campy, TOO poppy...etc.  Suggestions are more than welcome!  What would YOU like to hear the Cheezies sing?

P.S. You're all invited to the concert, I'll post dates and times when it gets closer!"

"event","So it's been a few days.  Friday I went to Tri-County with my dad and sister.  The Gap closed down!  Which has shaken what little faith I had in corporate America.  Oh well, Northgate is closer to my house anyway.  Got a great shirt at Express. And then we went to Graeters, which made it that much harder to set foot in Coldstone that night.  I felt like I was living a lie the whole shift.  Coldstone is good, but Graeters blows them AWAY.

Saturday I went and saw Encore's production of Footloose.  It was really good.  I'm not a huge fan of the show in general, after doing it at Miami freshman year.  But it was less obnoxious than I remembered.  ""Somebody's Eyes"" was really well done, and so was the extended opening number -- musically, those are the two best written pieces in the show, and they were pulled off the best as well.  Lindsay was amazing as usual (watch out Wright State...), and I was blown away by Nick Schneider.  He got a standing ovation right in the middle of the show.  That kid definitely has to come to Miami and be in club next year...I was impressed with the girl who played Vi's voice too.  It was also less traumatic than I expected to go back there.  A lot of fun actually.  It was wonderful to see the whole Flick family again (Hi Mrs. Flick!)  I miss them a lot!  Mike and Angie happened to be there as well, and Joey flew in from North Carolina to see Ashley, it was nice talking to him after no contact all summer.  Now I just need some more jamming with Mike time.  Hearing the orchestra jam after the show gave the rock-out itch.  But alas it was another night at Coldstone.  Just like yesterday was.  And tonight.  But Saturday is my last day there.

I'm at the dream job at the Library right now.  James (super-cool boss) is gone, maybe already on his way to New Zealand to puruse his sailing career.  Which makes me my own boss today."

""Hola, Roberto,"" said the waitress. Her skin was like leather-brown and tough and still in the shape of a cow.

""Hola, Little Rabbit,"" said the man, who loved the waitress, though her skin was greatly in need of the lotion. Also, at the moment he could remember her name.

The waitress looked at him. He looked at her. They looked at each other.

""Something to drink?""

The man knew in his heart that the time had come to speak truly and well-to""order,"" as they said back in the States-for if he did not he might have to give up his seat.

""Prune juice,"" he said. ""With an umbrella. Because it is raining.""

They laughed at his joke and then made love on the bar.

Afterward the man sipped from his glass. I have known better prune juice, he thought, but this prune juice is strong and warm and good and will deliver its message. It tastes sweet, like prunes, only more liquidy, which is how it should be when you are with someone you love.</A>

BEST.
JOB.
EVER.
My boss is cool and super laid back (although unfortunately, he's leaving in two weeks to go become a professional sailor...so we'll have to see how the new one turns out.)  I spent three hours messing with computer stuff, resizing digital photos and helping people with questions.  Blows Coldstone, or any other job I've had, out of the water.

"event","So it seems like all I have to do to get comments on my LJ is offer parenting advice.  Here's another one:

I support the eating of newborn children for both sustenance and population control.  Especially south of the Mason-Dixon line.

Anyway, first things first.  Dave Matthews Band concert with Meg, Kara, Kara's brother Patrick, and his girlfriend Julie.  Riverbend.  It was steaming hot in the Pavillion, where we sat, and Matthews was sweating like a pig on the big-screen.  Carter Beauford, the drummer, is usually the main event for me, and did not disappoint.  They did a nice mix of old and new songs (I hardly knew the new ones), most of them filled out with long jams, which is the other selling point to me.  A highlight was hearing all of ""#34,"" an amazing guitar and sax-centered instrumental.  I used to be able to play that when I played sax in high school.  I wish I owned a saxophone.  <A HREF=""http://usuarios.arnet.com.ar/bambu/Esaxos.htm"">Or one of these.</A>  Then I could drop out of school and tour with Springsteen.  After the concert there was some amazing heat lightning on the drive home.  It was beautiful.  I'm kind of disappointed there hasn't been a really good early evening summer storm yet this year.  Or at least that I've noticed...

Is that Jack Johnson on SNL?  Somebody must have watched, tell me if I'm right or wrong, i missed the intro.

Today I found myself in Oxford with an hour+ to kill before work.  I went to Kofenya and got a frozen coffee.  The place was almost deserted, the lone staff person there was sitting at a table surfing the web with his laptop when I came in.  A singer-songwriter was setting up, unfortunately I missed that because of work.  I read for a few minutes, and then Amy called me.  I walked out and wandered the streets while talking to her for a while.  At the corner of Main and Spring I was the victim of an unexprected drive-by ""Hello"" by the notorious Megan Falk.  You never can be too careful in that neighborhood :-P  I hung up with Amy and made my way back to the car, to move it closer to Coldstone.  Unfortunately, I put my half-full Frapenya on the roof before pulling away.  It splattered pretty spectacularly in the middle of high street.  Which was a highlight.  While at work, the quiet store was invaded by a bearded Polish guitarist in a Guiness hat, who may or may not have lived with me this past year.  I served him ice cream with my bare hands.  Which is more difficult, and less sanitary, than it sounds.

Anyway, now it's time for John Belushi and ""Samuri General Practitioner.""

Yesterday, I picked up my new glasses from the eye doctor.  I like them, although they don't look quite like I remembered.  They're the same lens shape as the old ones, but rimless this time, and with grey hardware holding them together.  They're very lightweight (read: flimsy-feeling), but the eye doctor assures me that they're titanium, so they can probably take more abuse than my actual head can.  After getting the glasses, I went to my interview over at King, and was hired on the spot.  Now I have the school year job all taken care of, and I'm going to pick up a few hours here and there during the rest of the summer.  

I was sent home early again from work yesterday, because we were so empty.  Actually, two of us were sent home, it was that dead on a monday evening.  Oxford as a town seems to be emptying out.  Lots of the people taking summer classes are finished and long gone, and the classes that are still in session will only last till the end of the month.  Summer Orientation is over, as are all of the reunions and conferences.  Uptown is mostly quiet, except for the occasional thunder of tractor trailers pounding up the bumpy brick streets.  The townies have one more month of quiet sidestreets and easy parking to enjoy before the students will be back in force.  

Taking a cue from Meg's blog, I tagged along with my father to the library today.  He was picking up more fuel for our TV shows-on-DVD addiction.  We're running out of seasons of ""Homicide,"" and the new ""Six Feet Under"" is still on hold, so we've got M*A*S*H, Frasier, and the first season of 24 (which my parents became addicted to this year while I was at school.)  Since I still have outstanding fines from sometime in high school, I used his card to check out a few classical nerd CDs--

The Rake's Progress, an opera by Igor Stravinsky
Sergei Rachmaninoff's ""Vespers,"" one of the most beautiful choral pieces ever
a disc of Schubert songs -- Schubert invented the pop song 200 years before John Lennon was born...
Benjamin Britten's ""War Requiem""
John Adams - ""On the Transmigration of Souls""

The last two are the only ones I've really listened to so far.  They're somewhat related.  ""Souls"" was commissioned by the NY Philharmonic for premiere on Sept. 11th, 2002, commemorating the first anniversary of the attacks.  The War Requiem is Britten's response to WWII, written for the re-dedication of a London Cathedral destroyed by German bombs.  This particular recording comes from a 1995 performance in D.C., celebrating 50 years after VE day.  It's interesting to me how art responds to current events, both directly and indirectly.  Both inndividual pieces of music, poetry or works of art, as well as entire artistic movements and schools of thought are brought about as a reaction to significant world events

Both works caught my attention because of their contrasts.  I had read about both, online and in music classes.  ""On the Transmigration of Souls"" is by John Adams, a contemporary composer often described as a minmalist.  The work begins slowly, hypnotically, with swirling strings, New York City street sounds, and pre-recorded voices reading the names of the dead.  A chorus sings words taken from ""Missing"" posters at ground zero.  Adams blends modern electronic music techniques like tape recording with a full orchestra and chorus.  He takes bits of 'found' text and sets them to music like poetry or prayers are often set in other classical pieces.  The music finally fades out the way it began, diminishing back into the sounds of city streets.

Britten's ""War Requeim"" interweaves the traditional Latin text of the Requiem mass (with chorus and orchestra) with poetry by British poet Wilfred Owen, who was killed in the final weeks of the first World War--a clear anti-war message.  A tenor (representing a British soldier) and a baritone (a German soldier) sing these poems, sometimes alone and sometimes together.  In the original performance these parts were actually performed by a British singer and a German singer, both famous opera stars in their day.  The music alternates between soothing, calm phrases and jarring modern harmonies.  Britten balances both texts out with music.  He sometimes sets Owen's WWI poetry like a hymn.  And in one instance, during the Requiem's stanza about ""the wondrous trumpet, spreading its sound"" on the day of reckoning, he throws in military trumpet calls and march rhythms.

I guess I'm not sure where I'm going with this entry anymore.  I'll probably write more later after I've thought about the two pieces some more."

"event","So, I'm sitting at the library at Miami at 5 o'clock on a Sunday.  Why, you ask?  Well, I just saw the matinee of Seussical at 2.  It was really good, I especially liked the illustration-like quality of the sets.  The music was good, and made good use of recurring motives.  A few standout performances.  Lots of crying babies in the audience.  The story wasn't anything spectacular, but that's what you get when you take a bunch of (mostly) unrelated Dr. Seuss books and try to make a show out of them.  So it goes.  I did like the random little references to books that didn't make it into the show.  

So anyway, I have to work at 6, which brings us back to the ""why"" question from before.  So I've got some time to kill, and going home/coming back wasn't worth it in such a short amount of time.  So here I am in the air conditioning keeping up my pledge to write more.  Although I really don't have much to write ABOUT...I'm getting new glasses tomorrow, how's that.  God, is my life that boring?  Is summer that boring?  Hmmm, Dave Matthews Band concert this week, there's a more positive thought!

Time to go uptown and find food, because fainting in the ice cream isn't quite as much fun as it sounds.  Have a lucky day."

"event","Someday I'll actually get back to a regular schedule of updating this thing...someday.

First of all, how hard is it to believe that the summer is halfway over??  At least halfway...my first summer class ended on Thursday.  No more conducting with Dr. Bausano.  And my conducting lessons with Ethan are practically over because he leaves Sunday for three weeks.  Poor baby has to go and spend three weeks in New York City to take a class at Julliard...now you see why this is my chosen profession!  The Ed. Psych course in Middletown hit its halfway point this week as well...three weeks down three to go.  It's mostly a waste of time,  we pretty much watch movies and talk about rats in mazes.  But Tuesday we're going to a Mexican restaurant to have our discussion there...just because.  So I guess I can't really complain...

Coldstone is...coldstone.  I don't even remember if I ever put that in here...I started working at Coldstone at the beginning of June, after an unsuccesful on-campus job hunt.  It's alright, similar to the movie theatre in the way I DREAD going in, but once I get there, I find that it's not so bad.  Also similar to the movie theatre in the sense that having laid back managers makes work easy and fun, while the non-laid back ones can make it hellish.  Either way, it's decent money and it's only for the summer.  

I also have a job interview Monday, brought out of an application I submitted to the University Libraries at the beginning of the summer.  I'm interviewing to work in the Center for Information Management at King, a computer lab full of fun toys...so my fingers are crossed for that one.  If I get that one lined up I'll make the first weekend of August my last one at Coldstone, then start at the CIM after I get back from...

DENVER!  Katy's wedding is August 13th, and several of us are going out to Colorado for it.  Erin had the sense to fly, but Caroline, Dan, Julie, and I are renting a car and making an adventure out of it...So that'll be five or six days in August, and then school will start about a week later.  I'm looking forward to moving into my HUGE single in Elliott Hall, and seeing what the year has in store for me..."

Summer term classes started, I'm doing  Choral Conducting with Dr. Bausano and conducting lessons with Ethan.  Tonight I went to the Reds game with Todd, Scott and Ryan.  Kara met us afterwards at Todd's house and we ate Wendy's and authentic Cincinnati Reds frosty malts.  It was great to see the gang again, I guess I got to see some of them at OSU a few weeks ago.  Reds lost, 10-5.  So it goes...anyway thats all for tonight it's past my bedtime! :-P"

"event","Quick update.  We just finished our concert in Differdange, Luxembourg, across the street from Miami's Luxembourg Campus.  I'm in the Miami Castle right now, in their computer lab.  We're all taking turns checking email and stuff.  The next two days of the trip have been phenomenal.  Yesterday we got up and drove to Trier, on the Western edge of Germany.  We ate and shopped there, then continued to Luxembourg.  We checked into a youth hostel yesterday, did a concert last night and had another phenomenal dinner.  Today we shopped and toured Lux City and then went to an awesome castle, then had Italian for dinner, did our concert here across the street from the Chateau, and now i'm on the computer here.  Tomorrow we sing mass at St Michael's in Lux City, which we toured today.  Not very big, but acoustically very nice.  Then we're going to the American Military Cemetary and I think touring a vineyard, although that might be in two days...We'll stay our last night in Lux tomorrow night, then go to Reims for a night, and finally finish up with three days in Paris!  Actually we'll finish with a hellish day of travelm, but who's counting...Anyway, time to let someone else use this. See you all soon!"

"event","I'm still basically in shock that this year is over.  It has been an amazing ride, especially the last month.  So many good times, new friends, old friends, more good times...yeah some exams in there somewhere.  I was loooking at my computer slide show last night and just CAN'T believe the year ended so abruptly.  I mean its like just yesterday i was having a great night with all my friends from St. Marys, and then less than 24 hours later, i'm at home.  now it's 48 hours after that, and I'm leaving for Germany in the morning with Glee Club.  Which I'm now a student conductor of by the way.  like WHOA.  Things were great this year, in almost every way.  Summer should be good (i just need to find a JOB now), and next term holds so much promise of amazingness...i'm honestly excited to see what life will throw at me next.

Anyway, I just wanted to make a little update, since i did promise myself I would keep in touch with this thing...see you all in 2 weeks!!

Love,
Billy"

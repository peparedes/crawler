I made the mistake of listening to it again today and I'm listening to as much Iron Maiden as I can to get that bloody song out of my head.  I have a real love/hate relationship with songs like that.  Catchy, somewhat entertaining, but as annoying as fuck (I have no idea how annoying ""fuck"" is, but I bet it's pretty damn annoying).  That little marmoset mood indicator thing I have captures me perfectly right now.  I even have a squiggly little GIF line hovering over my head and everything.  At least when I have ""Whiskey in the Jar"" stuck in my head I somewhat enjoy it.  But seriously, son, fuck Numa Numa."

As much as I hate to say this, the Roman Catholic Church has been doing something that I actually applaud them for.  Yes, I am indeed talking about what's like the only consistent pro-life policy on the books (other than what the Quakers and Menonites use, but they're really small and politically insignificant).  That's right, unlike Democrats (who kill babies but save criminals), Republicans (who save babies but kill criminals), or Ashcroft (who rapes and eats babies during the process of killing criminals -- ok, I'm joking, but I am really fucking glad the bastard resigned), a true-blooded Catholic opposes both abortion and the death penalty.  Pardon everyone else for being a flaming hypocrite (except Ashcroft... that mother-fucker's just pure evil).  Alright.  There you have it.  Discuss.  I need reactions.  Best thought I hear on the subject gets a prize (probably; I think I'm still working on some of yours').  Y'all got a week on this subject.

No fraternity, no really thought-provoking courses as of yet (although Intro to Sociology has whetted my appetite for the subject), and it's too goddamn big and the parking sucks my ass really, REALLY hard.  In other news, work is interesting, what with working until 1am everytime I pull a shift (Yea!  Closing!).  I make minimum wage, but at least I get free rentals.  I've actually seen SOME movies now.  Which reminds me, the sequel to From Dusk 'Til Dawn is HORRIBLE, despite Bruce Campbell's presence.  And that AvP movie was weak, too.  Good thing I only paid a dollar to see that one.  Sky Captain rocks, though.  I don't care what anyone else says (i.e., half the people I saw it with).  Anyhoo, for future plans, look for me to be in the wonderful burg (that's what it is) of Greencastle, IN sometime within the next few weeks.  My boss can't schedule mandatory staff meetings (wtf?)

"event","***Disclaimer***: I have NO IDEA why I was thinking about this.  DO NOT ASK ME WHY.
I've often wondered (possibly due to my mechanical ignorance) what the hell place hydraulics have on an automobile.  Personally, I don't see what the appeal is of having a car that can go into a seizure.  I think (and this is just my humble opinion) that hydraulics' true places are in OTHER household applications.  Like a pinball table.  That way, you can scale the learning curve, or just cheat like a discontented housewife.  That'd be pretty sweet.  I have a real love/hate relationship with that game.  I love to play, but it's the biggest bullshit game on four legs.  So make the inclines adjustable.  Then it'd turn into those little handheld games where you try to maneuver the little balls through mazes into holes.  Yeah...  Anyways, I also think cats should have hydraulics, especially if they have an inner ear problem.  Because I HATE cats, they're evil sons of bitches.  So hydraulics would really fuck the little shits up.  Yeah...  And also I think that stereo systems should have hyrdaulics and move around to the music, like they're doing a little epileptic dance or something.

And Matt says that person who left the thongs on my computer said I would ""get it"" or something like that.  Well, I don't.  And he's not saying who it was.  Which brings me to one of the fundamental laws of the cosmos:

(1) Big Country has a horribly unreliable and fractured memory (mainly due to the bipolar).  DO NOT COUNT ON HIM TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING!

Also in this list are:

(2) Big Country hates the world.  Most other things he has a love/hate relationship with.
(3) Castro died like 10 years ago; they're just faking it now.
(4) Satan is a multi-faceted being, and includes (but is not limited to): John Ashcroft, Charlton Heston, Pat Robertson, and Jerry Falwell.
(5) Fear is NOT the mind killer.  Falsities are.  (HA!  Take THAT Herbert!)
(6) Arkansas sucks Pablo's ass.
(7) Erich is a tool.
(8) He is also a MASSIVE tool.

I'll make some more up later, but these are all pretty much true (esp. the last two).  Later!

"event","Jesus Christ, it's been a long time since I've updated this thing.  Okay, tonight after chapter I walked into my room and found a SECOND thong on my laptop keyboard.  Allegedly (Matt was sworn to secrecy regarding the identity of the individual who left it there), it was left by a very special person, and I'm guessing not very special in the short bus sort of way.  Anysways, I am absolutely clueless as to who this person is (even though Matt said I would know who the person is).  In fact, my first inclination when I found the first piece of undergarments was that Matt had a lady friend over while I was away on Saturday and that it landed there on accident or something.  And now, I haven't decided what the hell is up.  Part of me thinks this is a bizarre joke, and part of me is curious as to who would leave a thong on my computer TWO DAYS IN A ROW.  I can't think of anyone that I consider ""very special"" in a leave-thong-on-the-computer sort of way, and I can't think of anyone who would consider me ""very special"" in the same manner.  Anyways, a reward to anyone who can provide the identity of the person who is presenting me with what are going to be used as unusual room decorations (as well as proof of said identity).  There we have it.  A reward.  I'm stooping so low as to turning my friends into mercenaries and private investigators.  So go find me a very special person, gumshoe."

Sometimes a boon, but more often a curse that I am afflicted with due to my particular illness.  I hate not being able to sleep.  It always means that I have too much on my mind.  And that always means one of three things: (1) an exciting event is about to transpire, (2) I'm in a state of mania, or (3) I'm in a state of depression.  Sometimes it's a mixture of (2) and (3).  So four things, I suppose.  But anyways, I can't sleep, and I don't give a shit about most things right now.  That's not good, either.  I need to care about things.  I really need to.  Sometimes I feel like I'm slipping.  Horribly.  Like I'm kneecapping my life so it has nowhere it can go.  Christ, I should be tired.  I'm not.  I've found a lot here at college, but sometimes I wonder if this is where I really belong.  I don't know.  I'm not making any sense.  I wish I could put what's in my head on paper.  I really do.  But I can't.  It's either a lack of courage or common sense or articulation or some combination thereof.  Maybe none of those, too.  Ah well, back to trying desperately to sleep.

I'll start ending these at arbitrary times from here on in (at least a day though)."

"event","As my first entry in more than a week, as well as my triumphal return to Live Journal Free City 17, I felt it would be appropriate to comment on Abhi's break-up letter to Chris (just ask and I'll forward it, free of charge).  First, I was disturbed.  Then, I became both disturbed and nauseated.  Finally, in order to cope, I tried to think of derogatory names I could call Abhi based on the information obtained in the break-up letter.  However, I found most of them juvenile and in poor taste.  So I eventually gave up and settled on dubbing Abhi ""Ass-Dart Champion of the World.""  Congratulations, Abhi.  You do Oscar Wilde proud."

He got all three answers correct (all three were ""D""), and for showing mental prowess superior to that of lesser men, he receives an autographed sketch drawn by me (of Cthulhu eating Jesus).  If you feel that you were short-changed and that YOUR answers were the correct ones, come talk to me IN PERSON.  Otherwise, tough shit.  Also, due to divine revelation, I have decided to make the quiz 5 questions from now on.  Also, look for some short answer questions in the future.
And Ben, I'll bring the prize to you sometime in the near future."

[2] Taters do NOT go well with gravy because...

Anyways, something I've always wondered which ""voice"" in one's (i.e. my) head (and no, I don't hear voices in the schizophrenic sense; at least not since I've been on the med) is the voice of reason.  I've often heard that it's that ""little voice in the back of your head"" that is the voice of sanity or whatever.  But the voices in the front and back switch positions on me fairly frequently.  So... is possibly false hope and faith better than the more probable half-paranoid cynicism?  Man, I have a real love/hate relationship with Machiavelli.  He gave real wings to what I always hoped were delusions..."

I'm not terribly sure why, but I've had the repeating vision of a man in a black coat striding towards the edge of a cliff with his arms spread like wings before just walking off and falling.  I don't know if he dies, like if he is broken upon the ground or has his fall broken by water or whatever.  I don't know.  Just something strange, I guess.  Just typing to get this out of my head and somewhere else, really.  Have no idea what it means, or if it means anything.  I've also been having trouble typing this, like spelling ""no"" as ""know"" or typing ""I"" instead of ""idea.""  Harder time typing than normal, at least."

I suppose if I could, like, e-juggle or something, THAT'D be impressive, but I have no such talent.  I also suppose I could propose new product ideas, like this item that complements the George Foreman Grill: the Smokin' Joe Freezer.  Haha.  I liked it.

At any rate, we have some sort of social event through the house with Theta sorority.  What really honks me off is that I have to walk to the second farthest house from my dorm, just to walk back to across the street from where I started.  I suppose it's good exercise, but I'd be a little more enthusiastic about THAT if it were a little WARMER outside.  Bloody weather... whoever's in charge of it should be fired.

For those of you who aren't familiar with the last one, it's that mood you have when you are able to speak in complete and absolute gibberish (while still using actual words).  For example, when someone asks you how you feel that weather will be that night, you reply, ""Astound sympathy, for Timothy running twenty dollars of greased quickens.""  Real conversation stopper, let me assure you."

"event","Yeah... this journal thing is new to me.  Really new, as in I have no idea what the hell to write.  Ah well.  Such is life, I suppose.  I could probably start off with some deep, meaningful bull shit quote about perseverance or some such taken off of one of those inspirational posters.  You know what I'm talking about: those posters they always have in the breakroom or counselor's office.  They always have windsurfers on them, or the pyramids, or a basket full of puppies.  There's always a word like ""Dedication"" or ""Aspiration"" or whatever.  And then it has some phrase like, ""...means pushing the limits"" or some quote by Plato.  Occasionally there'll be a Garfield poster where he's holding a cup of coffee, bitching about how much he hates getting up in the morning.  It's best when both posters are in the same room.  It makes NO sense.  It's like saying how much your values suck.  I don't get it.  Personally, if I made a poster, I'd make it one with Buddha on it saying how it's the motivation behind actions that really matter.  That'd be pretty damn cool if you ask me.  Or maybe you could have George Bush juggling cannon balls or something.  Yeah... that'd be sweet..."

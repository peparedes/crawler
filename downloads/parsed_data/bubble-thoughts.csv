"event","Yet again i say how sad & immature you are.
Leave it be.
Stop reading my LJ & move on with your life.
Im sure you have one even if it obviously doesnt challenge you enough.
You may think that im ""sad or thick"" but im far from it.
Dont push this any further."

"event","Well first & foremost i would like to say a thankyou to the person who hasnt even got the balls to use their username to make a comment on my only public post besides this one. 
Well done !
Secondly to the other person im glad that you whoever you are feel its necessary to actually copy & paste what someone writes into their LJ thats posted so its ""friends only"" then to pass it onto someone else so they can then make a comment anonymously. 
YOU are AWESOME !
Proves my comment was right about people being incredibly immature !
Somehow i dont think you really should be under ""friends"" do you ?
I still find it amusing that when you apparently loathe me so much your still reading my LJ & using someone else to actually access it ! 
Hilarious !
Funny really when it was only yesterday i took off anon posting because i wanted to test what would happen i must say its very interesting !"

"event","Ok so this is my ranty journal.
Nothing special though really.
Just me being open & honest about my life.
The old journal will be used to comment.

If you want to read this journal its friends only ask nicely & maybe i will let you in ......
For a small fee  :P

If you cant cope with what i have to say dont read it ......
Then there is always the delete friends option if it gets too hard."

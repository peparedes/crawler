"event","its been a while since i've even looked at this thing but alot of things have changed since then...the sarah things is done brushed aside by my choosing and at an end that relationship is...and not soon enough the end was,things have changed opinions, feelings,appearences, everything for me..my hair has gone from long and blonde to a shorter brown...natural. new relationships have formed,and the one girl i never thought id be calling baby is exactlly who i call that every day..while the days of dating sarah where coming to a close i became very close with a girl i met over XBL (xbox live) her name is Alex, and me and her became very good friends over the 3 yr perios we've known each other...well sarah n her didnt see eye to eye... and for god reason i woulda dumped sarahs ass for Ally( her nickname i gave her) n a minute but newayz this is how it went down...ok well summer came and i decided that id spend the first month with my dad since i always stay a month in the summer over there..well sarah decides that thats the time to be fucking round with everyone..which im glad she did..it only supported the descion of throwing her out of my life, the whole month my dad explained to me that he was worried about me, i wasn't the same Zack i used to be i was tired, hardly cared about anything but making sarah happy, and the words that my dad told me that i stick by now is "" it doesnt matter if other people are happy because all that matters is if your happy, because in the end, your usually all you've got"" and it opened my eyes to what had been going on, that sarah was slowly sucking the life from me. and it relized she had to go..well the month finally came to a close and unwillingly i went home with my fathers advice riding high on my shoulders,i didnt intend to break it off that day i just wanted to see if it would work..well it didnt..i got home and called her and we talked for abit and i looked at her myspace and saw that this guy she constantly talked about at work named joe was on her number 2 ( she had been talking about him all month n i knew that she liked him) and i saw how much they had been talking then i knew, it was done...slightly happy and mad i told her ""you know what fuck this..im done...we're done"" and that was it,  neither of us objected, and im glad well i figured it would be hard and i would want her back, but it wasnt like that at all, i felt lifted,free..as if i had broken the chains that had held me to the ground for so long...i smiled after i hung up that phone with her and silently said...im free. (months before this sarah said i couldnt talk to alex so i hadn't been for awhile which was one of the reasons i felt like shit because i loved that girl she made the fucking awfulness of my relationship go away) well after i threw the phone on the bed i rushed to the computer got on myspace and messaged alex. then we never stopped talking. the next day...me and my mom stayed up til 5 o clock and i made the decsion to get my hair chopped off...lol kinda felt like a new begining when i looked at myself in the mirror. it raised my spirits so much and i was back to my old cocky self. well a few months had passed school had already been in for abit, repeating the 9th grade was embarrasing but hey at least i had good ol Steve there to acompany me,,so after re doing classes and constantly being hounded by sara wall and steve telling me i was gonna go back out with sarah (they still owe me money)and everything..well while i was single and happy my Sexy buddy Alexandria was having ""my boyfriend is a fucking asshole"" problems, and which was pissin me off...he treated her like shit n i wasn't gonna stand for that shit...we had our words and the kid did not want me going to Illinois to beat his ass..while she was dating him she called me all the time knowing id cheer her up un til one night ( we had stayed up til like 4 talking ot each other while she ignored her bf calling her) and Alex hesistated on something. she wanted to tell me something but she said she was afraind t would compromise our friendship i told her "" Alex you know you can tell me anything and nothing will happen i will always be here for you"" she sighed then said ""ok Zack please answer me honestly, do you like me, as in more than a friend...because i have a confession, i like you...way more than a friend and i was wondering do you feel the same"" i was overwhelmed with the total omg wtf did this just happen?? "" i was like Alex..ofcourse i like you more than a friend"" then we went to bed...i couldnt sleep at all...neither could she. well not long after that alex broke it off with Ryan and she was single...but after that she got really lonely and she was quite sad..so on the phone with her one day..i put my 360 controller down and said "" Alex we should go out"" she laughed a little and said "" oh zack where we going?"" i said"" no..we should GO OUT like we should date"" ""what?"" ""Alex im asking you out we should date""...silence then "" are you serious??"" and i was...and ever since that night on December 13th i have had the best relationship ever even though its long distance it couldnt be any better, i love her more than anything...when i stayed at my dads he told me i needed to find the girl for me...pick out the things i like in a girl n look for that..Alex is everything i wanted and then some...but i wanan besure shes the one..i wanna se if this long distance thing can work til i graduate ( ill see her in the summer and shit but i wanna see if shes as commited as i am) and if it stays as good as it is now..as soon as i garduae im pack all my things and im liveing BFE West Virgiina and im headed to Naperville Illinois..hopefully i can stay with Alex until she graduates..then she'll get her apartment in the city and lll move in with her...then if it gets this far ill know shes definatly the one for me..and then ill ask her to marry me..hm...what can i say..im in love"

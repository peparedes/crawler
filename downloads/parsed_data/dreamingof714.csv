2 friends got pissed at me for no reason today. then they said sorry, and i swear, i couldnt let it go. if they were sincere apologies, i couldn't feel it. 

my best friend called me a ""stuck up b*tch who doesn't understand her anymore"". wow, do you mean it?

then she got offline.

it came out of the blue, and i dont know what i did in a matter of 2 minutes to suddenly become a stuck up b*tch. what the hell?

anyway. dad had his bone marrow test today. the results should be in tomorrow. im a little worried, but not as much as i was before. everything's gonna be fine.

i'm home 6 days early from arizona. dad's surgery was cancelled until NEXT monday. he has to have a bone marrow test. i'm kinda scurred about that. BoNe MaRRoW just scares me. immediately i think CANCER. but i know it's not that. he's had the tests for cancer already. but still, why do they need to test his bone marrow?

ugh the hotel room we had wason the SMOKING side of the hotel. i was there for a day and even the clothes i didn't wear smell like smoke. i hate that smell. my parents don't even smoke, but my aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, and second cousins do. been raised around it. hate it. i feel like my nose won't let me breathe every time the smoke stench hits it. great. have to wash clothes that aren't even remotely dirty. oh well. i'd rather not feel like im suffocating. 

got to talk to My VaLeNtiNe when i got home. nice WeLcOmE hOmE even though he didn't know i was gone. i didn't get to tell a lot of people. it's okay, i was only gone a day.

bought two good books. finished one of them in two hours while we waited for dad at the Mayo Clinic. 

1) Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging
2) Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen

there a bit on the lighter side as opposed to ""THIS PRESENT DARKNESS"" and ""THE LOVELY BONES"" No dying or taking over of towns by evil forces. I read ""ANGUS, THONGS, and FULL-FRONTAL SNOGGING"" freshman year. HILARIOUS. When mum saw it she nearly gave birth to a cow. She screamed ""ANUS, THONGS, and FULL FRONTAL-NUDITY??!!"" I was in tears... my mum can't read to save her life without her stupid glasses. Of course i had to correct her before she ran to dad and started screaming that i was reading porn or something. GOD knows that's the last thing i need, for my parents to think i'm an oober perv who read about anus', thongs, and the full monty. jeeeze. ahhaaha.

babysat on valentine's day. didn't mind though... it's nice to know u have a valentine. didnt matter that i didn't get a kiss or anything. he's such a sweetheart, that's all that matters... anyway, i watched THE ITALIAN JOB, FREAKY FRIDAY, and THE TWO TOWERS with the twins and Hayley (the babysitting victims. KIDDING.). It was a blast. Hayler is like 13, so she's fun to talk to, and i swear the twins are 8 going on 42. little prudes, those two. they are so funny. always talking about there little boyfriends and how they cant go on dates with them because they are FAR TOO YOUNG (they used those words) and their parents wouldn't approve. meanwhile, im staring at them, thinking: ""WHERE ARE YOUR WALKERS AND CANES?!"" They are tiny, young-looking, old women.

errrr the smoke is killing my lungs. i swear i can feel the second hand smoke as my lungs succumb to it. 

moooving on. arizona was an experience. the ratio of blondes to brunettes was 53:1. NO JOKE. Everyone was blonde. i felt very original. hahahaha. the hospital was nice, except for the enormous amounts of geriatrics that were there. while mum and i sat in the waiting room, we kept looking around. it was almost funny. OKAY. it WAS funny. someone to the far left would cough, then mum and i would try to predict where the next cough would be. i won that game. then i started to feel wrinkle-claustrophobic. i looked around. it felt like a cell-block. then my clever mum says, ""we're in prison. and they've all got 5 minutes to life."" i thought i was going to die. i burst out laughing, and got up to leave. well, tried to get up and leave. my leg had fallen asleep while we were waiting, so when i got up, i was limping. i heard someone whisper, ""she's so young."" i felt really bad after that. i don't know. i think it was a reality check of sorts. i thought, ""what if i really WAS here because i was sick? how would i handle that?"" Then i tried hard not to focus on that, and more on reading my book. I laughed out loud at least a dozen times and all eyes would shoot their gaze toward me and i'd have to bit my lip to stop laughing. funny book.

i suppose i should stop here. LJ cut is probably necessary. we'll see if anyone complains and then i'll change it.

i'm off to sleep. i made this away message... pretty clever at the end, one u get past the boring. its witty, though.

*iT's A biT LaTe, eH? THEN WHY ARE YOU UP?! i'm not. i'm sLeeping. sLeep is niiice. that's three i's. nIIIce. it's so nice i had to misspell nice to make my point. it's nice. and i'm sLeeping NoW. right now. and now. and now. and now.

i guess he talked about religion... well, talked bad about it, and then he got reported. i'm religious, very, but i wouldn't report him. he has an opinion. who are WE to codemn? we're not.

besides, you would think that with this sudden death at our school, that people would forget their petty crap with mr. george and let it go.

jeeze people... a girl is dead. right in our community. she walked the halls with us, sat through classes with us. how can you be so insensitive?

yesterday one kid says: ""duuuude, did you hear about that girl that died?"" 

that sad part: he had a class with ""that girl"", but just because she wasn't the most popular girl, that jock didn't pay her any mind. 

that really sucks, too, cause i know that all football players and jocks arent that ignorant and heartless, but it's really hard to stick to that notion when you've got jerks who talk like HIM. he ruins it for everyone else.

i was talkin to her about prom and how excited i am to go to West High's prom with her and our whole group... it's gonna rock. and i told her a while ago how i didnt think i was gonna end up going with dustin cause he has a girlfriend now, and even though we're best buds and his girlfriend and i are super close and she doesn't care, i didnt feel right about the whole thing.

and then tina tells me yesterday:

""dustin can't go with you. he just bought a car and he's broke, so yeah, he's not going. sorry to break it to you.""

tomorrow is friday. Thank God for that one. I got out of 8th period today. I was helping Emma do some stuff for the FBLA. It was fun. We talked to our Computers teacher(business law, personal finance, comp apps...and a leader of the FBLA i think) forever... She's way cooler than i thought she was. We talked about everyone in her our Business Law class and in her Comp Apps class. it was hilarious.

overall though, pretty boring day. found out one of my teachers might get fired for soem crap that he pulls. he lets students ditch and come to his class... guess it caught up with him. Poor G-Dizzle.

anyway. that's it for now.

AWESOME GAME. could have ended better, but it was awesome. by the way, Stever and Emma, if you comment on this entry will some of your frickin crap about the Patriots, i will delete it . Don't test me. Anyone else, FEEL FREE.

Anyway, back to the BoWL.

Both teams played to win which is more than i can say about last year's SuPeRbOwL in which my favorite team, the Raiders, lost ridiculously and had a season following that was equally bad...

That wasn't the case this time. This superbowl was a game to remember.

Delhomme did awesome, and yes, i'll admit Brady did, too. Do i think he deserved to get MVP, of course not, i dont like the guy, but if i did, alright, MAYBE. If the PaNtHeRs had won, DeLhomme was the MVP fer sure. They put up an awesome fight. I'm proud, CaroLina. You can hold your heads HIGH. You guys never gave up!

MOVING ON...

OH YEAH, DUH. The now INFAMOUS Janet Jackson BOOOOOB flash.

Justin, Justin, Justin. Wow. Yur hot. Wow. You ripped off Janet's top. (well 1/2 of it anyway.) WOW.

that was so bad, no one cared much about the streaker that made his way across the field in nothing but a MALE BIKINI and some stickers advertising for another .COM company. NIIIICE. LoL.

Back to Janet (Miss Jackson if your nasty. Perhaps you should refer to yourself as Miss Jackson, Janet, because TRULY, you are nassssssty. Whether good or bad, each person had their own opinion! HaHa) ACCIDENT OR NOT?

Here are what my results will look like:

YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT BE A MECHANIC. YOU, SAD SAD CHILD, HAVE NO CAREER IN AUTO. YOU ARE WHAT WE AT THESE STUPID TEST SCORING FACILITIES CALL ""A RETARDED INBRED MECHANIC"".

We walked around Coronado and checked out the shops, which is always fun. We went to the bookstore and coffee shop where my sis works and i got the BEST SMOOTHIE i have ever had. It was SOOO yummy. 

I'm gonna move there. It was so beautiful i can't imagine NOT living there.

I liked the movies, so im excited to read he books. 

And her cats... O WOW. They are all like flat-face persias -- i dont know the correct terminology-- and they're adorable. Their names are ARCHIE (big red one who is watching t.v. right now. it's so adorable. he's literally watching the television. the nature channel. hes SO cute), Gigdet (who lays on her back and tucks her arms to her chest and stretches her legs out. she's hilarious. she has an attitude. i love it. LoL), and MoOoOoSe!! He's my favorite. I  mean, we have the same nickname! MoOsE! He's my buddy hahaha. He lays in my lap and licks my finger. It's rather funny. It's precious. He's my FaVoRiTe. 

Coronado isn't like i imagined it at all. It's a fairly small island and its so beautiful. As soon as i saw the water, i immiediately thought of Kevin. We're BeAcH bUdDiEs... he would've LOVED being here.

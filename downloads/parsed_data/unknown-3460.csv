"event","Sad Eyes:


Each time I look upon your face,
My heart goes faster, out of control.
Memories keep flooding in,
Recalling times, of a really fun day.
Like swimming in your backyard pool,
Or going to the park, to swing on the swings.
From laying in the grass, to looking into your sensitive eyes.
O I wish I could stop crying.
I wish you could be here.
Fate has tore us apart.
A hole was dug deep into my heart.
I try to fill it, with silly things.
But each time I do, I just want to scream.
When I said I love you,
I couldn't stop saying it.
Because it was so true.
I may look at you, and act as in disgust.
I might call you names, and put you down.
I only say that, so you can't see me frown.
I cried when you told me that it's over,
I even broke my hand.
Because I was once your girl,
And you were once my man."

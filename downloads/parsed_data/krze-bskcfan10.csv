"event","Ever feel like your the cinderella of your family? well what if you really were? Ever feel that no matter what you do it's never enough? in every family there has to be one cinderella, and to bad for me i am her. in my family i live with my grandma, dad and my older sister. my sister the good girl, the great student, majorily involved with church, the ""loved one"" as i say. when she graduated even the day before she did she got a car and she got a $7000 car..i was struggling thru high school, my government class and my dad said all i had to do to get a car was to graduate, and pass government.. and I did yet i still haven't gotten my car, nor do i get a $7000 one i get a $4000. you know it's not that bad becuz atleast i get a car, but the fact that i did everything he said and still haven't gotten n-e thing if unfair..also i do EVERYTHING in this family and no matter what it's never enough. i do all my chores and my sis and my dad don't do theres so i have to do there's and then if i complain i get yelled at saying you never help out around here your always stuck to the computer.. well if i had a car i wouldn't be.. i have to always borrow my grandma's and she limits me to EVERYTHING.. so i have nothing to do besides come on the computer or watch tv.. i hate it here after i get my degree i'm outta here forget this i can start my own life some where else like new york, or texas, oregon, washinton N-E state i want where i don't have to deal with this n-e more.. oh wait i can't leave becuz that means i will be running away like my mother, who yes ran away back to oregon. i feel like the new kelly song called BREAKAWAY.. thats what i want to do breakaway just leave..

*Grew up in a small town
 and when the rain would fall down
i'd just stare out my window
dreaming of what could be
and if i'd end up happy
i would pray
trying hard to reach out
but when tried to speak out 
felt like no one could hear me
wanted to belong here
but something felt so wrong here
so i'd  pray
i could breakaway
* i'll spread my wings 
and i'll learn how to fly
i'll do what it takes till i touch the sky
and i'll
make a wish
take a chance
make a change
and break-a-way
 out of the darkness and into the sun
but i wont forget all the ones that i love 
i'll take a risk
take a chance
make a change
and break-a-way..*

this is how i feel mostly the i don't belong here, or i try to reach out but no one could here me i'm out practice time!"

"event","Man do i wish i could have a new life or just leave and start over. i hate it here, i thought it was desent until my senior year when my life turned completely upside down. freshmen year my mom left i was fine, it hurt but i grew to be independent. then she came back, and it hurts even worse.. becuz i see her like i saw her when i was little.. and the way she talks 2 me and says that she doesn't know how to be there for me.. and crap..then i lose all my friends.. i have no one to lean on.. no one really cares they just act like it, no one really wants to hear my crap cuz they have their own that they have to deal with. i try to help others but i doubt it helps, it just leaves a bigger problem on my shoulders..i sit with people who only see my joking side, they don't really know me, the ones who did they don't care n-e more cuz they think drinking is more important...also my grades have been dropping cuz i don't really pay attention n-e more i'm trying soo hard to graduate, but yet my grades are slipping like i'm not supposed to..i think the only thing i have is my volleyball team.. and thank God for them they keep me sane i guess.. my mom said she's going to go into a Hospital..and i wont see her for 21 days, yet i haven't seen her for the hardest part of my life and when i do it hurts more then if she wasn't there..i can't stand this life style n-e more i hate being depressed but i can't think of n-e thing good cuz pretty much there is nothing.. i'm tyring to hold on to the Lord but it feels like he's pushing me away.. or just letting me slip..i have no chance in meeting Britney Spears or Kelly Clarkson but i'm still goin' to write to them and let them know everything..sounds so lame but thats all i can do becuz i have no other chances n-e other way..when i am happy it turns to hell.. something goes wrong.. and i hate it.. i like my toes tho..i hate toes but mine look cute for once..i'm stressing over summer becuz i'll hopefully be starting volleyball for PCC and it's goin' to be hell cuz we have 5 hours a day of practice.. i'm getting fatter becuz i'm soo depressed so i turn to food for comfort..i'm outta shape..when i was at school i was laying down trying to sleep and thought that people could see me like that and they would think i'm sleeping but i could really be dead and it still wouldn't matter.. i am not gunna let my self slip away cuz i don't want to hurt my family like they hurt me..i want to live on my own.. in a new state maybe texas..burleson cuz no one would know me..people say it would be harder but i think it would nicer and easier and maybe funner..i should just leave wonder who would care or who would actually try to look for me..yet i'm stuck here becuz of my dad.. but once i turn 18 i think i'll leave for a year to see what it's like..maybe i should just let go and drink just like all  them fuckers..maybe poeple would like me better.. NAH.. i like my choice for not drinking and if i have change for ya'll to like me well fuck that i don't care hate me..i hate it here.. i want to leave..can't wait to go to new york.. get away i need it.. if i'm not at school i moved cuz there is no point except for volleyball..n-e of u i feel like Britney in her Everytime video!!...and if i have defended... well i'm sorry but why don't u tell me somehting good that has happend to me.. besides volleyball and i have shelter..piece practice time

"event","Tuesday my life turned upside down.. i got home from practice and my dad says HEY shannon did u check your messages? and i told him no and he says will you u got one from your mom.. so i checked it and one was from my mom.. it was HORRIBLE i couldn't imagine n-e thing scarier that could have happen.. 
  in the message it was my mom and she called up crying so for like a minute it's my mom crying then she starts talking while she's crying she says, "" shannon i love you so much and your in my heart both you and your sister are in my heart, and i want you to take car of your sister for me ok i love you and then she hangs up"" well i started freakin to my dad i was in a high pitched voice "" WHAT IS SHE DOING what is she goin' to do,""and i started crying.. then we all sit down and my dad told me my mom was going to drive up Angeles Crest and drive right off the edge.. that made it worse i started crying more.. and my dad said that when i was younger she used to cut her wrist..THANX dad that help the situation.. but then we talked and i held in my tears and stuff.. then at night i cried my self to sleep actually i couldn't even sleep i just cried and tried to forget about it but i could picture the car driving off the edge and me not having a mother..i could hear the phone message in my head..and me freaking out.. horrible..
  THE NEXT DAY
i went to school and every period i have tears in my eyes. then second i told my 2 friends.. Lisette and Sarah.. but they had to pry it out of me.. i couldn't speak it i had to write it cuz i wouldn't be able to get it out i would have cried.. then it all came crashing down.. i walked outta second period and i lost it i started crying and then Nikole saw me crying and i told her and i cried.. i let it all out..i felt like a retard cuz i was crying soo much and loud..and it made it worse thinking of how if she had gone through with it.. then who would i have spent mothers day with.. plsu also what hurt me is i'm the closer with my mom then i am with n-e other family member and if she died i wouldn't have n-e one to go too.. also the fact that she would consider leaving me and my sis.. becuz of someone who hurt her.. how unloving is that.. AAAHHHH i hate it just thinking about it and now the memory is burned into my head.. 
thank you
 i have to say thank you to all my friends who cared.. at first i didn't think i had anyone but i do and i thank you so much for helping me.. and for Nikole for letting me cry on your shoulder and getting you wet.. cuz i was crying lol.. thank you and i LUBS ya'll much!!.. 
GOD BLESS

  ok soooo i just watched the new britney spears video.. it's called 'Everytime' and it's THE greatest video of all time. i cried.. and everyone who knows me knows i don't cry in videos/ movies (except air bud it's an animal thing) and it's not the oh i felt like crying, or i had tears in my eyes and thats all NO i mean i was like tears falling down my face and i couldn't talk crying.. and i know ur thinking what a wuss.. but thats how big of fan i am, seriously, like in the video it shows her dying.. like she died and she's all bloody and.. just dead, and for me as big of fan that i am seeing her like that hit me hard..WOW if she died i don't know what i would do, kinda like if a family member ya know who's close to me, like it would break my heart majorly.. and that sounds gay but honestly she is like THE greatest thing to me, and yes i am also a huge Kelly Clarkson fan, and everyone keeps asking who i like better, Britney or Kelly, well see here's the thing, they are completely different people.. for one thing, kelly is known for singing britney is known for performing.. and so much more and personal ish's..not the dirty way lol, but i'll say if kelly can make me cry in her video.. then she will be tied with britney.. i know i'm a loser but hey i'm ok wid it.. oh heres a new count down.. also this is how big of fan i am of kelly she has added a new birthday count down like Britney... there are 12 more days until Kelly's 22nd birthday..

"event","OK so this night which was actually Monday night was THE best, and THE best concert EVER.. if it's possible, i LUBS Kelly even more then i did before.. honestly this concert changed me.. no joke and i'll tell you all about it after i tell the story of what happend...
  ok so i woke up and wanted to go right then and there that's how excited i was.. but i waited until like 130 ish to go.. which the concert didn't start till 7.. so 130 ish came and James weiss, Rachel johnson, and my HERO.. RAQUEL Gibert..all went together..with YES it's true my 3 posters and of course the infamous box of Ding Dongs.. no joke i brought/bought them for kelly.. and although i don't know for sure if they got to her.. heres what happend.. we were all walking across the street after we finally got to park.. and this guy was with us.. and my RAQUEL.. asks him if he gets to talk with Kelly and Clay, and he goes yes i do and she goes ""would u PLEASE give these to kelly for her (me)"" and he goes i don't think she's eating ding dongs right meow ( he didn't use meow but i like that word) and then raquel goes PLEASE and he's like sure i'll give them  to her for you.. and yea then he left and we just hung out andhe comes back and goes i put them on her bus for you.. i wanted to die.. i called him my AMERICAN IDOL.. lol i was soo happy..so hopefully she got it.. and read my note..but only God and her would know.. thats alrighty.. and if ur wondering about the ding dongs it's this whole interview that i read.. with her and clay here i'll post the web site instead of write the whole thing:www.kellyclarkson.ca/index.php?action=fanzone&subarea=transcripts&aid=72 
 so if you go there then u'll see where i got it except it doesn't say that she likes ding dongs but i know she does.. n-e ways.. so the concert started.. Clay was first.. now see all the ladies were yellin for him but he didn't impress me except i like his version of ""when doves cry"" that was my fav he did besides open arms with kelly.. ok but n-e ways honestly kelly should have SOOO much more people screaming for her then Clay.. She's hella lot better singer/performer than him.. no offence to him, but she is.. but anyways her set finally came on AWESOME.. my fav song was ""Beautiful Disaster"" but i was mad at one thing.. the whole Timeless song.. jacob.. good singer 2 nothing against him BUT he ruined my favorite verse in the WORLD..he sang it, which he is an awesome singer but why i like it, is becuz it's soo beautiful and kelly sings it, the two reasons, it goes ""where the crystal ocean melts into the sky"".. but he said ""where the crystal ocean meets into the sky"" i know who cares but thats my fav verse EVER.. but the concert was soo amazing and how it changed my life.. well when i woke up the next day i was talking to my friend about it and he asked about the ding dongs, and normally i would be all panicy and stuff but this time i was like "" if she got them thats awesome, but if she didn't then it's awesome that he made me believe he did."" and if n-e one knows me then they know i would never be like that.. plus i was way more thankful after the concert, and ok so it wasn't huge but for me it was and it still changed me i LUBS KELLY CLARKSON and wish to meet her one day, or atleast get my chance back.. and i wish her all the luck in the world cuz she's def a TRUE artist, OUTSTANDING performer, SINGER, person EVERYTHING KELLY I LUBS U!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","well well well, what to say but blah.. you know i'm kinda dumb becuz i have a lot of good things in my life yet i hide my thankfulness for them behind the depression that i have with the bad things i have. i don't understand how i can show more thankfulness because most things turn bad in my life, and i bring those out.. when i am happy something inside or outside hurts me deep and i feel sorrow.. i need help, i feel like i hate my life but i also love it at times.. and i have to ask: WHY do people tell you they will do something for you or with you like in advanced but the day before the event they change their minds?? Raquel this is not intended for you becuz u are the only person who has come threw with their promise and i respect that greatly and LUBS u lots for it.. and i THANK YOU soo much.. also have to ask.. isn't it kinda weird if your best friend becomes best friends with your ex best friend?? also putting them before you EVEN though u have been there for them day in and day out, even when no one else was u always stuck by them?? what is this world coming too.. no actually it's just the town of La Crescenta.. I HATE this town.. and i DISLIKE many people in this town becuz they are fakes/flakes/they just SUCK.. i want to make a movie out of my life no joke i think it would make people cry, i don't want them to feel sorry for me,just kinda teach them a lesson.. in away.. make them understand me better.. which would be hard cuz i don't open up unless.. no actually i don't really open up unless i trust you.. but.. i got bad news and i gtg 3 days until my concert gunna throw a box of ding dongs on the stage for kelly lol LUBS her and Britney.. they complete me i believe lol piece

"event","Stupid 

Night lift up the shades let in the brilliant light of morning
But steady me now for I am weak and starving for mercy
Sleep has left me alone to carry the weight of unraveling where we went wrong 
And all I can do to hang on, to keep me from falling into old familiar shoes

How stupid could I be
a simpleton could see 
that youre no good for me 
but youre the only one I see

Love has made me a fool set me on fire and watched as I floundered
unable to speak except to cry out and wait for your answer 
and you come around in your time speaking of fabulous places create
an oasis that dries up as soon as youre gone
you leave me here burning in this desert without you

Chorus 

Everything changes everything falls apart
I cant stand to feel myself losing control
In the deep of my weakness I know

Chorus

got the words need the song lol i'll write more on my day later.. kinda blah but i have practice soon so meow i'm out piece
6 days left until 'IT' excited but still sad

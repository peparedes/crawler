"event","I'm leaving on a jet plane today, and I haven't packed that much as of 2:37 AM.&nbsp; This happens every time I leave for a big trip. 

The obligatory postcard check is in effect.&nbsp; Leave request here and/or email a snailmail.

I think I will leave my iPod at home since my headphones decided to leave this earthly realm for audio-sonic Valhalla today.&nbsp; Why Sony's why?&nbsp; Will I suffer musical withdrawal over the next month and a half?

I want to see a UK festival firsthand, but they're all sold out.&nbsp; Oxegen in Dublin was my closest bet, with Glastonbury coming up second.&nbsp; My only consolation is the possibility of seeing Beirut at Temple Bar in Dublin... and perhaps the Sunday lineup of Pitchfork when I return to the States for Joycie's wedding...&nbsp; 

Aaaah.&nbsp; I still have to pack."

"event","Canal Street Station

31 Down's interactive telephone mystery Canal Street Station runs
from now through October 31. Canal Street Station is a free public
media art installation set in the Canal Street Subway Station in New
York City. Participants are invited to make a toll-free call from any
public payphone in the Canal Street station (inside of the
turnstyles). Participants will then be guided on a pay phone mystery.
The game takes approximately 45 minutes to complete.

Tajna Tanovic stars in this public pay phone who-dunnit set in the
maze of tiles that make up the Canal Street Subway Station. This is
an interactive piece that challenges participants to test their
skills at listening and following directions. Players are put in the
shoes of Mike Sharpie, private investigator, as he searches the
depths of Canal Street Station for a young French woman who may have
committed a murder, or may be a figment of Mike's wandering imagination.

To play, call this toll-free number from a pay phone inside the station:

1-877-OR-WHAT-31

Canal Street Station is co-produced by 31 Down radio theater and
free103point9 and presented by free103point9 as part of the
transmission arts non-profit's 10th anniversary celebration. Created
by: Ryan Holsopple, Shannon Sindelar, Mirit Tal, and Tanja Tanovic.

Canal Street Station
N,Q,R,W,6,J,M,Z platforms
24 hours a day; $free with subway ride
Continues through October 31

NOTE: This is a pretty neat installation. The phones aren't great,
and it's kind of hard to hear parts of the story, but it's fun to
walk in circles and listen to a French woman whisper into your ear.
And wouldn't it be incredible if there were competing stories in
different stations, and they changed all the time, and you could
always listen to a new tale? Maybe try this one on your way to
something else."

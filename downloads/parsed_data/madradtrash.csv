addiction, bi-polar disorder, and manic depression. good thing i can't have kids, right? i'm thinking of adopting, if anything. i doubt i'm gonna want to sacrifice my life and relationship to a child, though. i really despise them, in violent, wrong ways. in other words, stop bringing your screaming kids to the fucking grocery store, the movie theatres, or anywhere public, otherwise some crazy drug addicted bipolar bitch is gonna fucking hurt them and teach you the lesson the hard way.

sorry. i just think it's rude, that's all. and of course, as is the american way, rudeness should be punishable by death, for small children anyway."

uh, i rely completely on my landline. can't afford a cell. and yes, it's extremely difficult to be the only person on the planet without a fucking cell phone, especially when i see fourteen year olds running around with iphones. spoiled pieces of shit."

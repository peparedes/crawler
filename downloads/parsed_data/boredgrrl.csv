"event","today i emptied out my locker and head all these clothes and shit in my locker then i put half of it back in my locker cause my back pack was full. Oh guess what i got sent to ISD again. they sent me cause i said SHIT! thats stupid, Shit shit shit shit this is so fucking stupid then they give me some packet that ask why i said the word and why its hnot accepting in school and Chris and Leighton told me to write i don't know for every quesion and that was a good idea, cause i don't care i mean it is the end of the school year already damn whats the worse that could happen, they kick me out of school actually thats not bad thats good cause our school is dumb as hell! Anyways some people think i like Jamale well um i do admit that he is cute but no i do not like him, he is short, and he is a crackhead, pothead etc.. and he only goes out with girls that give him blow jobs. Take the information we all learned in school serious and remember ALWAYS USE A CONDOM.i feel like throwing up i just ate like 6 of those icy thingys and the purple ones taste like childs medicine"

"event","I just got back from the Mall with Chris, Jamale and Susan. And guess whp we saw there... we saw the ""BITCH"" yup we saw kim... She cam up to us and she was all up with Jamale, she is trying to hook up with Jamale right in front of Jamale's girlfriend. Then susan was like excuse me but who are u and Kim was like Jamales future wife. It was funny cause jamale said he would never go out with her not even if he was ever desperate. And then Susan was like ""u best get of my man, be4 i kick ur ass"" then kim was like bring it on and then Jamale was like to Susan that it isn't worth it. And we just left cause she was getting on our nerves, plus she was about to get beat up. Okay all i gotta say is STOP DREAMING, no one wants u!!!!!"

"event","ok it is sunday i am so bored anyways next weekend is the 8th grade graduation and i don't have anything to wear yet. I don't even really want to go but i am still gonna go. i'm sure that the dance is going to be stupid and there are ony 7 days of school left, yes i counted cause i was really bored. I can't wait till school is over in a way but i don't want it to finish cause it is going to be so boring this a summer, atleast i think it is. I mean some poeple are leaving the school and i have to stay their cause i have too but i don't want to i want to go to the High School. This is not fair at all. Last night i had this weird dream. We were at school, at recess and it was me, Chris and Jamale and we were talking and all of a sudden someone comes up to us and she was talking to Jamale and she is like hey will u go out with me if i suck ur dick and he goes no i have a girlfriend and she goes well tell me when ur single and he goes why its not like i'll go out with u anyways. Then we left school and Lateisha was with us too and we went to the movies and we saw some kid we met in Canada and his name was Kevin. So me and Lateisha went over to talk to him and he had moved to Bloomfield and we thought that was cool but me and Lateisha said not to tell Krista about it cause she was just gonna start bragging and it was kinda stupid but oh well..."

"event","some people talk way too much shit!!! I mean they over exagerate too. They think they are the best thing on the world, like this one girl from my school (kim), she swears she is so cool with her Hot Topic pants and shit but then she talks to much shit, like i'm goth but u never see her wearing all black and stuff like that and she is like yeah heavy metal and shit, and tell em she was not talking about some kid from our school and she was like that he acts like he is the blackest person in our school and that around his friends he listens to rap and stuff but it is kinda weird because just cause u like rap doesn't mean u can't like rock. Just cause our group is a group filled with all this punk rock people and there is only few people who don't listen to rock..damn she gets on my nerves i can't wait till school is over. Only about a week left!!! YEAH i won't have to see her face all summer!!!!"

"event","Well, just a quick little update from the world of Joe, I figure since im sitting here at work with nothing else to do for the next 2 hours i might as well write some stuff in here. Lots has happened since my last post, so i guess ill start with golf first. I just started competing in the Re/Max World long dive championships and have been very successful for my first year doing it. I've qualified so far in 2 separate districts and am going for a qualifier in Daytona Beach this Saturday the 25th, so if anyone is in the area give me a call and come on down. HUGE PARTY after i win! :) http://longdrivers.com/sked/res.php?rnd=64&c=1&l=1&t=&f=25  Thats a link to the last qualifier I was in.....I lost to a guy who has been in the world finals the last 4 years by only 2 yards, so im optimistic. 1st prize in the world finals  $250,000. I've already emailed them and told them the correct spelling of my name for the check. But yeah, it's been lots of fun for me and my goals are modest, so as long as i win i wont be disapointed. 

Lets see.....oh yeah, I had eye surgery about 3 weeks ago. For those of you who dont know, I have a rare degenerative eye disease called keratoconus which gradually changes the shape of the cornea of the eye making it impossible to focus light and in turn terribly difficult to see. So, up until now the only real treatment for this has been a corneal replacement surgery, which is major surgery and not something id ever like to do. But luckily another treatment was approved just recently and my doctor agreed to preform this new experimental surgery on me free of charge. So I agreed. The surgery is basically a plastic ring that gets implanted under the cornea of the eye then stitched up, its supposed to make the cornea reshapen back to its origional position. So yes, haha ive gotten implants using plastic surgery. :) Good news is surgery went well and was a success, bad news is it hasnt worked at all, my vision is actually worse....and at night i see a huge white circle of light around everything as a result of the plastic ring in my eye. Oh well. My doc says it may work in conjunction with a contact lens. I guess Ill give it a shot. Im still optimistic.  

Personal Life still sucks. No real change there. Ive decided to just give up on love and focus on my career and other business ventures, it'll be better that way. 

Well i guess thats all for now....my short message turned into a mini novella. 
Bye Kids"

"event","I love sweet tea. Yeah I know its bad for me, but i really don't care. If there is anything in the world that the south got right that hasnt yet been abolished, its sweet tea. Im sitting here at work bored outta my mind, so i figured id randomly write some stuff in here. I have a big golf tournament coming up tomorrow, and i think im playing well enough to win it, I really hope i do, i sure could use the money. OHH, yesterday was my sister's final soccer game and she scored her first ever goal, she was soooo happy, her name is Katie and she is 6. Wow Im scatter brained today, I cant keep a train of thought going. Im currently setting up two office pools, one for the mens club championship and one for another big tourney we are having here next week. I think thats the only reason they keep me around, Im good at running illegal gambling pools :). God i wanna go home. I just had a nice conversation with a bride to be, she is getting married tonight and seemed so incrediably happy. I remember a time when i still believed in love, oh well. I think im gonna wrap things up here and leave a little early, maybe go play some golf. Adios"

"event","I feel trapped. I really dont know what I should do. I can very clearly
see my destination, but the path(s) are to cloudy to comprehend, I fear
Ill never reach my goals. Im having a lot of trouble trusting people
lately, and my ability to trust was one of the few things i liked about
myself. and don't accuse me of being emo, im venting, so fuck off. i
really need to find a friend, anyone i can just share things with and
talk to. its been way to long since ive really talked to anyone. My
life is a lonely one, and im ok with that for the most part, i know
better days are ahead, but for now its awful.......whatever highs I
experience through accomplishment are so quickly and harshly dashed by
lonliness, it almost seems pointless to try and do anything but go
through the sustaining motions of everyday life. I need to get the fuck
out of dodge, make some sort of fresh start somewhere, ive been trying
to plan a move for sometime now, but God only knows if it will work
out. I pray for some sort of change. BLAH. i hate being so damn
negative, im really not a negative person. things will improve, i have
no doubt. maybe ill become a monk, or join the peace corps. <br>

someone tell me there is more to life........."

"event","I'm trying to stay positive. As God as my witness I am really really trying to keep my head up and keep smiling. So it turns out the BIG return i was looking foward to with my taxes didnt work out in my favor. Looks like its gonna be about 300 dollars. Three hundred dollars is great some might say, then i complete my sentence...I OWE 300 DOLLARS. I am so irrate right now, plus my vision in my right eye seems to have gotten worse over night. I got pulled over this morning too, apparently my tag expired on my birthday.....only 2 month from the day i got it. So i had to pay another 175 bucks to renew that this morning. 
I've been told I shouldn't be so fixated on making large sums of money, that money isn't what life is about, and about a billion other dumbass cliches. Well sorry to inform you inncoent youths but money is what makes things work. Anything and everything. It may not be the answer to all problems but is sure as hell is the lubricant that makes things run smoother. The WD-40 to your squeaky life. And sorry, but anyone who dosent believe that either hasn't realized it yet, or is in a position of wealth and comfort that they take for granted. Im not trying to be cynical here, Im just keeping it real. Mad real. :) 
I'm almost done bitching for today....
My knife fight wound is nearly healed, tho i fear it may need to be drained of what ever disguisting fluid lies inside. Sorry for that visual image.

"event","You gotta be fucking kidding me. I was just called into a fucking ""lets ram joe"" session over some bullshit that happened at work last saturday and i couldnt be more pissed. I am sick of slaving week in and week out for shit money and shit people. Its amazing how quickly a ""friend"" can stab you in the back when they get a minor promotion. So apparently I have developed a pattern of insubordination and an inability to admit any wrong doing even when I am obviously in the wrong. Anyone who knows me knows thats bullshit, but apparently not as many people know me as I use to think. This is the third time one particular person has stabbed me in the back, and as God as my witness he is fucking dead to me, Im done. Nobody fucking tells me my preformance is poor, not when i bust my fucking ass doing absolutly everything around here. True enough, I dont like my job, but it is all I have right now. I am a golf pro, and that is all I am, so when I am here at work im the best motherfucking golf pro i can be. I guess its because i do most everything i do under the radar. I guess i need to tell more people im a wonderful employee for them to think i am. Thank God i wont be here long. WATCH FROM THE SIDELINES IF YOU WANT......BUT IM GOING STRAIGHT TO THE FUCKING TOP WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR HELP OR SUPPORT.   
      On a brighter note, I got my ticket dropped at my trial hearing this morning. I am no longer at fault for my accident, and my insurance company is now declining all payment to the old bastard who hit me. Which basicaly equals lower car insurance rates for me, and a clean record. This was the defining point of my day until i became outraged about an hour ago. Im feeling much better now, leave some love. :)"

I hate being like this, and i have no one to talk to it about so I turn inward and it keeps getting worse and worse. I can't excited or happy about anything anymore, I seem to be going through my days completly numb to everything and everyone. Fuck it, I really dont care anymore."

"event","So I tried updating this damn thing yesterday and somehow lost everything i wrote. That did not make me happy. New day though, I'm over it. I don't seem to be able to hang on to any anger or bad feelings for more than a few hours, Im just not a negative person. Thank God for some things. 
 I really need to get back into some sort of a routine. Since my vacation, and the injury to my hand I have been lazy as hell and have lost all momentum in my health crusade. Today is as good of a day as any to start again tho, my hand feels alot better and i really dont have any more excuses. On a side note, I really hate having to tell the same story a billion times. People keep asking me what happened to my hand, and yesterday I decided to have a little fun with it. Oh, for those of you who dont know, I sliced my hand up pretty badly last week in a knife fight protecting a beautiful but endangered young lady(I was drunk and I fell). Anyway, this lady at work came up to me and asked what why my hand was wrapped up, so i told her i was experiencing signs of the stigmata. She freaked out, he face dropped and she just stared with me. I really though I presented it in a manner where the was no way to take it except as a joke, but apparently she either believed me or was so grossly offended taht she stood there speechless and eventually just walked away. Oh Well. 
  I DONT WANT TO GO TO WORK TODAY. Maybe megan is working again today, the day would be much better if that were the case. I finally talked to this girl yesterday after 2 months, Im such a loser, but im working on it. Im sure my woes with women are completly mental, after all Im fucking gorgeous. Lately, Ive been trying to put myself in much more akward positions, to try and make myself more comfortable doing things that I would have been, for lack of a better word, scared to do before. It seems to be working, Im better at talking to some people, and I seem to be a lot less stressed. This journal has been a good outlet for me so far too. I hope I can keep doing it on a regular basis, and it stops deleting my entries. Well I think thats all for me this morning, time for some fruit loops and a shower.

"event","Bear with me here as I figure out a style in which to compose these entries. My mind is all over the place and I have no clue what to focus on and write about. I guess ill just start with my day and see where it goes. So my car is fucked up and needs more work...which again means more money i dont have and mo0re time wich i have too much of(even tho i may tell you im busy, im not). Brakes and roters on all 4 wheels, but thank God i found one of the rarest species on earth..the honest mechanic. it looks like its gonna set me back about 450-500 bucks. Not too bad i guess, just another expense i could have gone without. I really can't wait till i get to the point in my life where i dont have to worry about money at the level of self sustainment, it really sucks. Once again i spent wayyyyyyyyy to much money on my trip to Stetson, although its worth it, a great investment in some friendships that im sure will last a lifetime. I always have such a fantastic time when im down there and i come back with a revitalized sense of whats possible. The real world can become very numbing, its far to easy to get stuck into a particular path in life, even if its one your not happy with, just because its convient and any change can appear terrifying. I have the attention span of a 3 year old......im watching Theres something about mary and totally forgot what i was gonna write about next. so i think im just gonna stop things here, ill probably write some stuff tomorrow morning before work."

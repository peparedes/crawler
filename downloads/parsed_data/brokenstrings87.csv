"event","so it has been well over a yearr since the last time that i posted something in this thing. i cant exactly put my finger on what made me want to post in this again. i just have a lot of things going on in my life and i figured what better a way to talk about it than via livejournal. im still going strong with kate. everything is great. she is fantastic. i love her with my whole heart. 
        i currently am working for apple computer. i am starting out as a mac specialist. i am really excited. im finding out when the store is supposed to open today. im excited. it should be a fun experience. i also am starting school soon as well. so that should also be a good time. 
        due to the fact that i dont really have too much time to post right now, i'll leave it at that. maybe i'll update again later in more detail or i just might wait another year. we'll just have to see.

"event","so last night i made a trip up to west babylon to meet brandon boyd. the guy is like my idol and i love his band so i thought it would be appropriate for me to meet him. the signing was supposed to begin at 7:00pm. which started about 15 minutes late because brandon arrived at exactly 7:00. me, joe, and liz waited outside of the store for about 3 hours on this tremendous line. i also had to buy the book that he put out in order to get an autograph. so $32.69 and 3 hours to talk to him for 30 seconds was worth it. definitely. there were two lines outside. they would call in about 10 from each side at a time. i was the 10th one from my side. which means i got separated from joe and liz. so i walk in the store, take a look to my right and there he is. it was really unreal. i was like..shit hes right there. 5 minutes later, joe and liz came in. i was getting up to the table and gave the camera to one of the guys that worked there so he could take a picture of brandon and i talking. so i walk up, hand him my book, shake his hand and introduce myself. here, i remember the dialog. (kinda pathetic but it made me very happy)

brandon- ""hey man how are you doing?""
me- ""im doing swell. my names justin. it's really very nice to meet you.""
brandon- ""well its great to meet you too man.""
me- ""well, while i have the 30 seconds that i have to talk to you, i should tell you what i need to tell you. you are my idol and i respect and deeply appreciate everything that you do and are.""
brandon- ""right on man. thank you so much. really.""
me- ""also i sing in an incubus tribute band and that guy right there ( i point at joe) spins the turntables in the same band.""
brandon- ""wow, right on. thats awesome dude.""
me- ""here is a song request from me to you. i love you man, ill see you saturday. it was nice meeting you.""
brandon- ""love you too man, ill see you then.""


so that was my really crammed 30 second chat with brandon. it was really cool. really reeally neat."

a crow left of the murder...


i've been thinking about what i really want to do with my life lately... i gotta make it to where i want to be in life or else i dont think ill be truly happy. i need to have a career in which i am playing music for people that want to hear it. i think that's what i am meant to do. write and perform music for people. so i think from this point on, im gonna really focus on graduating high school and persuing my career with music and art. i think i can make this happen. fuck that. i know i can make what i want happen because i want it so bad that i can almost taste what it's like to be there. friday made me realize that. nothing in the world compares to being on stage for me. when i am on stage performing for people, i feel so untouchable. nothing can bring me down."

within all my power two weeks and one hour

theres something inside me that says more than twice
that breathing this air beats breathing you in...

i saw you standing in my headlight
i though i'd run you down for the weight you left on me
instead i pushed rewind, reverse, and drove away (lucky for you)
seeing you dissappear in my rear view
back to me the word risaprocity

hey
what would it mean to you?
to know that it'll come back around again

      this past year has been the best year that i've had. it was full love laughter and love, but also pain and agony. more than others. but whenever i think of the year 2003, i will always think of you. you are the only person or subject that i can think of when i think of 2003.

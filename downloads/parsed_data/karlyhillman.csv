As it turns out, I'm going to be able to go to Adrienne's party, but I'm not going to be able to drink because my life is silly right now, so I'm just going to dress up (maybe...if I'm allowed to go shopping or I can find someone to take me) and probably be the DD for all of my lush friends. I think they'll probably need me. And I'll need their gas money since I no longer work. At all. Ever. Besides, my 21st birthday is rapidly approaching and I'll have plenty of time to catch up on my drinking once that happens.&nbsp;

My problem now is going to be getting all the time off work that I need. I think I've probably hit my quota for like, oh, I don't know... THE YEAR!?! I still need the 20th off and the 26th and 27th off though because I need those days for me and my Lyssa. Her boy is coming in from New York on the 20th and obviously our birthdays will be celebrated on the 26th-28th. Damn you Mom and your having me on Memorial Day weekend! Seriously, what was she thinking?

I'm so damn bored right now. My mom has the day off and I wanted to go out and do something fun (i.e. anything that doesn't include being inside this house) but all she wants to do is clean. I would like to go get a new memory card for my camera because mine's broken or some shit and prom is in a few days. Looks like it's the couch for me... AGAIN.&nbsp;

I hate my life."

Know what else is good? Liquid vicodin. It's like taking a shot of flavored vodka everytime you want to feel better. I'm not exactly sure what flavor it is yet though. Something between apple and mandarin I think, but not yucky so that's a plus. 

Tonight Lauren and Lissie are coming over to watch House with me, so that will be fun because my family is in love with Lissie and I still get to watch House with Lauren. Everything works out. 

My surgery wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I thought that I was going to be in a lot more pain that I actually am, but there's still time because apparently it's supposed to hurt more later after my scabs fall off. I'm okay with it though, I have a lot of people who are thinking about me right now and I LOVE LOVE LOVE my friends. 

Now I get to look forward to my birthday. And then Lyssa's birthday right after. I love birthday season. Especially the big 21! wOOt."

Alcohol and cigarettes for the ""after party"": $20
I'm going to the Fall Out Boy concert and you're not: priceless

Yes, Fall Out Boy is in 10 days. I know you're jealous. I'm actually okay with that. Even more exciting? I was informed today that the semester ends in 17 days. I would probably be way more excited if I hadn't stopped trying like a month ago. 

I got my license renewal in the mail yesterday. I think that this means I'm about to be a big important girl. Or it means I'm about to be a completely useless drunk... but I think that I'm okay with this. I'm a completely useless drunk now. 

Speaking of completely useless, I went to price new earrings and it turns out that they are NOT quarter-carat earrings but HALF-carat earrings and therefore, cost a shit-ton more money than I ever wanted to spend because I'm an Applebitch. So, good thing I picked up that double on Wednesday because I think I'm pretty much going to be broke. I really want to go buy them now because I CAN afford them right now, but I have no idea what my cell phone or Visa bills are going to look like this month, or even when they will be arriving, so I'm basically just nervous that if I replace the earrings now, I won't have enough to cover my actual expenses. I should have been a drug dealer. 

I told Lauren that I was very pissed at ABC last night for tugging at my heart strings and showing a repeat of Grey's Anatomy. Then I told her to call them because I'm pretty sure that she still has their number. But seriously, at least FOX has the balls to tell everyone when House isn't going to be on. ABC just makes up some huge fabrication about ""new"" episodes and then lets you down like a bad boyfriend... and you just put up with it because you love him. Whatthefuckever dude. That pissed me off."

When I got to work I was told to take them out. When I got to work I did as I was told and put my beautiful princess cut diamond granduation presents in my apron like I always do when I get caught wearing too many earrings. Tonight they were not there when I got home and I'm just sick. Absolutely sick. It's not like I can't afford to replace them, because I can... but they were a gift. A very special gift. One that reminded me of my life being so cool and so new and so happy and maybe it's just a sign that that's all gone now and so are my earrings and so now all I can do is shell out a couple hundred bucks and pretend it's the same damn thing. It's not, and I'll always know that. Maybe my parents won't have to though. I'm just sick about it. 

On a much, much happier note, I'm going to Lansing for the weekend and I'm getting my tattoo at 5:30 tomorrow evening with my Lyssa and I don't have to be At The horrible Bee's (which will forever remind me of losing my earrings) and I can just play with my Lansing friends. Maybe I can buy new earrings in Lansing so my parents will never find out. 

I'm disgusted and the one person I need to talk to right now is dead. I'll just sleep it off. Or drink it off. I choose that one."

I made some good money this weekend, so now I don't have to worry if I have enough money to get my tattoo next weekend. I'm very excited about that. I did finally tell my mom and dad that I'm going to get it, and though they weren't happy, they haven't kicked me out of the house yet. Perhaps they like me? 

FOB=18 days.

Adrienne, Alyssa and I got the time off. Big fun. Very big fun. 

Last night I went to Stephanie and Dave's for a bonfire and we drank Woodchuck and it made me really really miss my Lyssa a lot so it's a good thing I'm going to go visit her. I was pretty pissed though when Lauren and Scott came over and Scott acted like he didn't even know me. Sorry if this is an uncomfortable situation for you or that by ignoring me, Lauren will forget how you know me. 

""Oh, we have to leave now... we're going to the Westphal's.""

Yeah bitch. It's been done. You're just the understudy. Sorry. pHace, I know you have something to say about this. 

Other than that, I had a lot of fun over there. Aimee came over and the three of us just drank and bitched about work and about people at work and damn did it feel good. I love nights like those.

I'm also supposed to be in class right now, but it's my last one and I take the final on Friday, and that whore Baiyasi gave us so much damn work to do, I don't really have an extra 3 hours to dick around in a class that I don't pay attention to anyway. Oh, and did I mention that I have hours upon hours of homework already deligated for this weekend? My mom told me that this only gets worse and it was at that moment that I wondered if maybe Alyssa had been right about this belt thing all along. Excuse me? Life is seriously this hard from here on out? Fuck that. Heroin junkie here I come! 

Speaking of heroin junkie... it's Thad's birthday tomorrow. Oh balls. I don't think I'm required to call him since I've tried several times previous to today and have gotten no response. This is me, pretty much tired of pretending to care about everyone else's shit. What could I have honestly been thinking when I met half of these people? Hell, even Matt was okay for the first week... so where did those other four years come from? I really do need a hobby. 

I was really excited to not do homework last night. I went to Lauren's and played with her and Joel and Bender. Then I was only going to drink a little, and I thought that I did only drink a little until I got home and my room wouldn't stop spinning. So now I have a new dilemma and it's called ""Karly can't figure out how much she's drinking... even after she gets drunk."" This hasn't proven to be too much a problem yet except for the room-spinning-going-to-work-drunk thing that I've been doing. I guess we'll just have to see where this goes. 

Eeeeeeeeeetchy skeeeeeeeeeeeeeen. Lotion no longer helps and I refuse to stop going the tanner because it's my drug of choice.

"event","<font color=""#ccffcc"">The past few days have been interesting, no lie. Matt has once again found a way to ""disappoint"" me, and I say ""disappoint"" because it was completely expected and typical and should hurt my feelings but really didn't because it's just getting old now. The fact is, I've pretty much been thinking about someone else lately and he's just not that big of a deal anymore. Fact is, if it's taken him 4+ years to figure out who I am and what he wants, then he's never going to figure it out... and I want someone who loves me and sincerely wants to be with me. I shouldn't have to be working this hard to get something that's just not going to last anyway. This is the way the rest of my life with him would be and it's just too much work and too much stress and there comes a time when I really do have to respect myself and my friends and my family and my time a lot more than this. I'm not going to even tell him. He'll figure out what me giving up looks like. Not that he'll even give a shit though. Meh.&nbsp;<br /><br />The person I have been thinking about lately though is pretty random... and a lot forbidden which is probably why I like it so much. My newer manager and I flirt a lot at work and we get along really really well... we basically have the same life story. He told me a few days ago that as soon as he can get transferred to a different store, he's going to ask me out. Which was pretty cool to me because I've had one of my work crushes since he started working there... but now it's all I think about and I want him really bad now. So he brought it up again today because he thought that maybe that creeped me out a little bit, but I assured him that, even though I really like that we work together, I'm pretty excited for him to get transferred now. Maybe this is really bad because he is my&nbsp;manager, but the fact is, he brought it up in the first place and we're so good together now... I don't know. Hell, I don't really have a whole lot to lose at this point. And he's got a job. And he might be going back to nursing school. At least I know he won't rush things because technically... he can't.&nbsp;<br /><br />I should go into my St. Patrick's Day. Not a whole lot to say. I went to Lauren's and got trashed and was still drunk when I got to work the next morning. Note to everyone: drinking before work is a lot more fun than not drinking before work. Good day. Then I went home, took off my shoes and passed out on the floor. I woke up about 3 hours later, still in my uniform and jacket.&nbsp;<br /><br />""How much did you drink?"" asks my dad.<br /><br />""I lost count after the first case.""<br /><br />""You drank a case? Good for you!""<br /><br />It's nice to know I have such a good support system at home. Somehow by being the fuck up all those years, I'm now not... and my dad loves me again. So I have that.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fall Out Boy- April 20th= so excited I could probably pee if it didn't seem so far away still.</font>"

We hate you. We can say it and sometimes feel it... sometimes even really mean it, even if we can't on camera in front of America. When it comes down to it we know that we'll probably give a shit forever and we hate that too. Mostly, to make us feel better, we hate you and we're okay with that. 

You screw with our lives way too much. We can have everything in place exactly where we want it and before we know it, a crazy violent girlfriend or an ABC camera crew is bursting through the door and it's always your fault. Maybe all we want to do is sleep, or dye our hair, or drink a beer... but we can't because you're screwing with our lives and messing with our schedules based on what fits yours. In case you didn't know... we hate that too. 

You're not phone people. Sometimes you say really horrible things, but most of the time you say nothing at all and you like it that way. Usually if you do say anything it's to friend, people at the bar, or your lawyer, camera crew or even your mom. Why can't you just talk to us and work out what's on your mind? 

You tend to walk away when we count on having you around. You tell us things like, ""I could spend the rest of my life with you and be completely happy,"" or ""No matter what happens we'll always be close friends and I'll always be there for you."" Then the Earth makes a slight rotation and we never see you again. So where's all this fucking support now? 

So, to all the ""men"" who have wronged us: Fuck off. Seriously do it. Take your whining, and your raging alcoholism and your federal court cases and fuck the fuck off. We're trying to do things like, go to school and work and be with family and friends... and you just keep barging in with one thing after another. You know we'll always care to some degree, but you don't so just go. Keep your problems and your issues to yourself because, we may have very small 20-year-old lives, but we really do like it that way. It makes us happy and, though we never thought it would end up this way... you no longer do."

Now I'm just filling spaces. Am I always going to be filling these spaces with more useless bullshit and these worthless guys that call me and I can convince myself that ""this could really be something"" and everyone knows it won't be because he's not Matt and I'm just too damn hard to please. Probably. I wonder if I'll ever be over it. Lauren says I will. Normally she would be right, but I can't... no, I won't let this go. I don't want to. I have love, even if it's just one sided and hey, one side is better than none right? Willing my phone to ring is a lot more fun than all the productive things I could fill my time with. I just keep thinking, there has to be a reason. It's been four years and maybe this is the ""been through&nbsp;a lot together"" phase that everyone talks about on their wedding days. I either don't respect myself at all or I'm a hopeless, hopeless romantic. I'm a mess either way.&nbsp;

I don't do fun anymore. Sarah called me last night at 11:00 because she wanted me to go to a party with her with lots and lots of guys and you know what I told her? I told her that I was tired and that I was going to bed... and you know what? I did. I hope I get more fun after I turn 21. That's what I'm expecting to happen because it's kind of hard to go out and have fun now because I can't go anywhere and drink with friends.

"event","It's true, I officially got my ass beat at about 7:30 this morning. And you know you want to hear the story...

Lauren and I were looking for someone available to purchase refreshments last night, and in a last ditch effort, she called Matt. He ended up coming over and staying because he wanted to get the hell away from Nikki for one night. Bender came over for a little while too and we were a big happy family. 

Then we all got really drunk and played some really fun games and Nikki must have called LITERALLY 85 times last night, but Matt didn't want to talk to her. Finally Lauren got on the phone with her and told her that Matt was okay, but he had been drinking and so he would be staying at her house because she didn't want him drinking and driving. Apparently that wasn't good enough for her, so she continued to call every 20 seconds (Note: This is not an exaggeration). 

As the night progressed, Michael came over and we were all happy because we had sleeping buddies. Lauren and Mike went to sleep in her bed and Matt and I ended up on the pullout and we finally went to sleep at about 5:00am.

Shortly after 7:00 this morning the doorbell rang. I didn't really know what was going on because I couldn't think of one person that would be at Lauren's door at that time of day. I tried to wake Matt up to get him to answer the door, but it's an impossible feat, so I just ignored it and went back to sleep. Finally Lauren got up to answer the door in a mostly asleep/hungover stupor and sure as shit, it was Nikki. The second she saw Matt and I laying next to each other on the pullout, she flipped out and jumped on me and started punching me in the face.

Now, you're thinking ""ouch, it would really suck to be punched in the face."" It's true my friends. Not only does it suck to be punched in the face, but it really really sucks to be punched in the face repeatedly, pounded on in the back of the head, and screamed at while in the midst of waking up after two hours of sleep and realize that you're hungover as fuck. (P.S. It's also really hard to think about any of those things while being repeatedly bludgened in the head because, as it turns out, that's pretty difficult to ignore.)

Well, Micheal realized that I was pretty much getting my ass kicked and pulled her off of me. She then began beating the shit out of Matt asking him, ""what were you thinking?!?"" (I was definitely wondering the same thing. I informed her that there was a sleeping 7-month-old baby in the house and that she needed to get the fuck out and then I went into the bathroom to assess the damage. Bloody gash across my right cheek... no hiding that. Another gash below my ear. Must be the ring Matt bought her for Valentine's Day. Glad I got to enjoy it too. Goose egg over and behind my ear, loose tooth, chipped enamel on my front tooth, and more pain than my jaw will probably ever experience again. Not to say that had I been in my best form I could have taken her, I'm just thinking that she had an unfair advantage with me being somewhat comatose. 

Work was fun. Or not, but everyone seemed to really enjoy my tale about how I took advantage of a completely drunken situation and how I recieved an ass beating that I probably deserved. Scott even changed my nickname of ""Snarly"" to ""Scrappy"" because he's completely a dork and I love him. Except when he started calling me ""Scarface""... not really a fan of that one. 

By the time I got out of work (100 years later), my jaw hurt so bad that I could no longer pronounce words. Playing off the scratch on my face as a sleeping ""accident"" to my parents was getting a lot more difficult. They probably know the truth though... I definitely look like the type who would get their ass kicked. I had an interview with Lyss's mom today about her nursing career. I'm sure she was impressed with my ""Butterfly Effect prostitute"" look. I just hope the bruises on my jaw don't get any bigger or I'm going to have to try and make some excuses for those... and I'm not doing a very good job at playing off the other telltale signs that I suck at life. 

That's the most excitement that's going to happen in my life for a while. I hope you savor it."

I'm here in the MLL once again, trying to catch up on some work that I missed out on in the past two days. I'm feeling better, but I think I would feel the best if I were at home on the couch again. Ahhh... the simple things. 

I start a new class today. I know, random right? It's my first offical nursing class. I'm officially a nursing student. Tell all your friends. I was happy that I was going to be able to finally go to the tanner today, but then I looked and my class gets out at 9:00 instead of 8:00 like I had previously thought. Today is just not going my way. Hell, they didn't even have tomato soup in the Brix today. What luck. I could plan to go to the tanner early tomorrow morning, but I did that today and that clearly worked out well. Again, I heart sleeping. Sleeping was my Valentine. 

In other news, I have incredibly dry skin right now. Want some? I have plenty to go around.

Things got worse throughout the day, and I was hoping that today would be better because Lauren and I bought all of our cute Valentine's Day stuff and I couldn't wear it. Meh.<br /><br />This morning TJ called me at 8:00 and told me to come to the door, and I tried explaining to him that I was in bed and I was sick, but he insisted and there I was, in my robe while he stood on my front porch with balloons and flowers. Okay, I forgot it was Valentine's Day and he clearly didn't, but I definitely wasn't expecting anything. Especially after last weekend and the fact that we haven't spoken in days. I thought he was just one of those guys who got sick of things and would just stop calling. Now I'm just confused because I guess I do like him but not in that, ""this could actually be something"" kind of way, because I really don't think it can be.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I was thinking that I would feel better today and that I could actually get some work done, but of course that doesn't usually work out for me. The only thing that I really really wanted to do today was go to the tanner because I haven't gone in 4 days, but I can't even imagine getting in my cold ass car and driving and then standing there for 10 minutes. It seems great, but not when I wish that I were dead.&nbsp;<br /><br />Eh, I guess I have nothing more to say.

On Saturday night Rachel and I went to her work party at the Horizons. It was really fun and we looked really hot and it was a good time. The end. (There Rachel, how did I do?)

Sunday was possibly the worst day ever. I found out some more things about my dad and my family that I'm not even going to bother writing down because everyone who knows me, knows what I'm talking about anyway. Well, we were really dead at work because no one wants to come to Applebee's for the Super Bowl. I called TJ when I got out and he was sad because he was all alone and I was sad because I didn't make plans and had to go home. So, I ended up going out there to play with him. Funny how every guy I meet these days lives in Hemlock. Oh well. We went to the Evergreen and I met his sister, along with some more unpleasantness (but I kept to myself and caused no trouble because it's not worth my precious time). Then we went back to TJ's where I made him watch Grey's Anatomy and then some stuff happened and I went home at about 2:00am. Good night... and the more I talk to and see him, the more I really do like him. I love feeling this way. 

Okay, so... studying time I feel."

Your dad told you it would be a good idea. You knew that it would be too. Why wouldn't you want to call me? I was wonderful to you. Funny, smart, determined, understanding, and loving. Always. Your best friend, your companion, the person you could realistically see yourself growing old with. There's just one problem. I don't love you anymore. I'll say it again. I don't love you anymore.

""I thought I would call you. You can stay at my house tonight and we can talk things out. You know we still love each other.""

You never loved me and you know it. Oh, and I'm not sure if I mentioned this but, I don't love you anymore. 

""If you want to be with me, you better call me in the next few days because I'm moving on.""

Now, there are clearly several things wrong with that statement. For one thing, if YOU want ME back, you better come to my doorstep, get on your knees and beg, because you owe that to me, and so much more. Second, that's the problem. You're always moving on, so sometime if I'm busy with homework or friends or I take some time to go out of town without you, you're just going to cheat on me again. As much as I loved that the first time, I think I'll pass. 

""I'm seeing someone else.""

""I know you're not as happy with them as you were with me.""

You're right. How did you know that I love crying myself to sleep and cutting myself with razor blades when there was no other relief? How did you know that I adore being treated like the scum of the earth when I did nothing but go through everyday thinking of new ways to try and make you happy? I can't imagine a complete stranger doing those things to me... so why someone I love? Correction. Someone I loveD. 

""Well, do whatever you want.""

I am. I have been since July 10th when you ripped my world apart. I've been seeing who I want, when I want, working the hours I want, staying at school as long as I want, kissing whoever I want, talking to whoever I want, being whoever I want. I'm really good at it and I like it and I'm sure as HELL not going to let you take this away from me. Never. Because no one will ever again. The problem is, you only know the weak version of me and I'm not sure you could handle who I am now. I love who I am now. 

So I'm sorry you figured this out too late, but I'm pretty sure I warned you. I'm sorry you treated me like such shit, but I'm pretty sure this is karma. I'm sorry that you need someone in your bed so badly but I'm pretty sure it's because you're pathetic. I could have loved you forever... I had planned on it, but plans change and people change and someday you're going to have to learn that. Maybe today is that day. Maybe not. But I'm not going back to you. I'm not going to back to the joy of having you and the fear of losing you and the pain of wanting you... I won't do it ever again, and that's the person you don't know. Be happy you don't know her... I'm sure you'd think she's a bitch anyway."

I then realized that I'm running out of money so it's a good thing that I'm going to work tonight and an even better thing that we're going to be busy. 

I'm sick, I'm tired. I just want to jump from weekend to weekend so that I can spend this weekend being gorgeous in a limo with my favorite Apple-Bees (yeah, you heard me) and then next weekend with my Lyssa and Dawn and Cassie and RachpHace and getting my new tattoo! I'm not ready for school to start again either. I haven't bought my books yet and I really don't think that I've had enough of a break. Seriously... I wanted to slit my wrists last semester... can I get another week? 

Okay, I've got this coughy-sore throat thing going on right now... but I'm currently in love with this song, so I'll just leave you with that.

---.---.---.---.---.---.---

I opened my eyes
While you were kissing me once more than once
And you looked as sincere as a dog
Just as sincere as a dog does,
When it's the food on your lips with which it's in love

I bet you could never tell
That I knew you didn't know me that well
It is my fault you see
You never learned that much from me

Oh you silly stupid pastime of mine
You were always good for a rhyme
And from the first, to the last time, the signs
Said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started
They said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started

I took off my glasses
While you were yelling at me once more than once
So as not to see you see me react
Should've put 'em, should've put 'em on again
So I could see you see me sincerely yelling back

I bet your fortressed face
Belied your fort of lace
It is by the grace of me
You never learned what I could see

Oh you silly stupid pastime of mine
You were always good for a rhyme
And from the first to all the last times, all the signs
Said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started
They said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started"

You're never lonely for very long. You're never nice unless you're lying. You're never lying except for all the time. Time is the one thing I miss more than anything, because I wasted too much of it on you. I don't miss you until you hug me. You only hug me when you're pretending to care. You only care when it's about you. It's only about you in your own mind.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>I wasn't mad that it was you tonight, only that I had asked you not to come to my work anymore and you did. You drove around the parking lot to make sure I was there. I know, I watched you do it. You walked up to me in front of my coworkers and my friends and you hugged me like we were okay. We're not okay. Just me. I'm the only one out of the two of us that is okay. You told me that you came in to see me. Why? You asked me to come over on Christmas Eve. Why? You told me to get a hold of you when I got out of work. ""Okay."" I said. I really meant ""no."" You'll know this by now because I haven't called you. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to see you. I don't hate you... I feel nothing for you. No good, no bad, no wonder and no remorse. You're an entity which no longer exists to me because your existence doesn't fit into mine. That's why I didn't want to see you... because then I have to admit that you're real and I'm happier with you as a bad dream. One in which you can wake up and it all goes away. </FONT></P>

I'm glad that Scott was there and was also ready to kick him out because I'm his ""Snarly"" and he hates loser guys who treat good women like shit. I was going to let him kick him out too, but then I thought, no. Let him sit there by himself at the bar, drinking and looking at me and thinking about old times and how I'm not talking to him because I genuinely have nothing to say. Let him sit there and take in all the stares and the whispers and the dirty looks and the laughs and let him know that it's because these people care about me, and that's a room full of people that don't give a shit about him and would rather see him hurt than&nbsp;let him be&nbsp;nothing but a stranger. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>I looked at his face while he talked to me. I examined every line and curve and familiar feature that I loved for so long... and I didn't see it anymore.

I didn't see the man I was going to marry or the father of my children or the person I was going to grow old and die with. I didn't see any of those things. I saw that his top lip was too small for his bottom lip and that he finally found a way to get a close enough shave without all those random patches that wouldn't go away and a very good looking outfit that he probably picked out but could never afford to purchase for himself.

We tried some ice but she was really weirded out by that. It wasn't a long night. Lauren came back relatively early and Joel had been there hanging out with me and Jim was with Lauren, so then we all just sat around and got drunk (okay, really drunk) and the good news is that I didn't have my car so I couldn't pretend that I could drive like I usually do. </FONT></P>

"event","It's amazing how much time I can find to update this thing now that I know people are actually reading it. I think that's probably why I stopped writing in it for so long, but now I have friends that are still all about the LiveJournal and I feel important again. 

So Matt did show up for the paternity test today. Surprise surprise. He acted 12... not surprise surprise. He brough his mom... wow. Shock of the year I suppose. Seriously, cut the cord, you're 25. I hate him. I really do. There are only a few people I hate and I believe I have good reason for all of them which is why I don't feel bad about sincerely hating him as a human being. God should have made him a fish. A really small one. 

Now there is this person I like... again. It doesn't make sense for me to keep doing this, so I'm probably not going to. I won't let myself do this ever again. I have my family, I have my borrowed family, I have my work family... I don't need more complications. I don't need to get cheat on again. I don't need to get hurt anymore. I hope I'm being smart about this and not being cold and bitter. That is not my intention, but a girl has to protect herself somehow and I'm not strong enough to be with someone without actually BEING with them 100%. I'm just going to stay away until I'm ready to be with someone, and if that never comes, I think I'm okay with that too. Now I just have to let everyone else know that I'm seriously not interested in them no matter what I do when I'm drunk. I love drinking more than I love you I promise. 

I am going to get to hang out with Thad on Christmas after all. He doesn't think it's a good idea for him to hang out with Katie. I didn't say anything because I knew that they had plans and I figured that it was just one of those Jim things where the guy would tell me not to get back into a relationship that clearly doesn't work and then he goes off and does EXACTLY what he told me not to do...I just let it go. I don't care what other people do anymore because I've accepted the fact that I'm not going to be able to save the world... and sometimes if you care enough, you just have to give it up and let them learn and just be there when it blows up in their face like you know it's going to. I've been lucky enough to have friends who are willing to do that for me, and I never realized how hard it actually is until you have to be the ""stand back and watch"" friend. This is why I value my friends so much. 

Well, I've written 1 out of 3 essays. I don't have anything to do tomorrow until Lauren comes to pick me up... and that's not going to be until after 5:00 at the very earliest. I clearly can't go to Delta to hand these essays in because I don't get Mimi back until Saturday maybe. So I'm just going to have to email this shit in. I see no other way. 

In other news, my back has been hurting so bad that I want to slit my wrists... either to forget about the back pain or to die. Both are good I feel."

I decided to turn around and go back home because I was scared of dying in the middle of Mackinaw, so as I was pulling back into the neighborhood my radio decided to shut itself off and I idled the entire way home until my car pooped out at the end of the driveway. Hey, at least I made it to the driveway. No car for me until this weekend... so, I'm 15.

I'm going to court today with Lauren. I'm not even sure if Dubay will bother showing up, but if he does I'm sure she could use the support, so I'll be there. God I hope he shows up though. I've got a finger that's just WAITING to meet with his eye. You know.

Work today at 3:30. Making some money would be nice so I think I'm going to try for it. I hope I'm not there late though because I have 3 essays to write for tomorrow and then this semester=OVER! Wow... I'm so happy I could go streaking or something.

But I'm good now, so I just get to look forward to buying the books and waiting for the classes to make me want to slit my wrists. That should be a good time. 

This past weekend was super fun. I was just happy to not have to be at work, unfortunately it's going to make it so much harder when I do have to go back. I actually think that I open tomorrow=suck. Oh well. I went to Lansing to visit my ladies and they hooked me up fat with Facebook... and yeah I just said that. Now, much like everyone else who recently joined, I'm addicted to it like heroin... or at least what I think that that would be like. Then on Saturday, Lyssa couldn't get work off so I drove to Sterling Heights to visit my Thad and I have to tell you, he's a completely different and wonderful person now that he's in his right state of mind. I got there and we sat and talked, then he got my car washed for me, took me out to eat, bought me cigarettes and made me coffee. Then he watched all my shows with me (Lord of the Rings and Grey's Anatomy) and let me hog all the covers while we slept. He's so much fun to be around now... I think I'll keep him. 

As of right now I'm addicted to Christmas music because I'm probably a flaming homosexual. I think that that will be okay though because the conversations I had with Lyssa and D made me never want to think about balls ever again. You know. Plus I'm already helping raise a baby with Lauren, and I think I'm doing okay... better than the actual sperm doner which is actually all he is. Speaking of which, I think Lauren is making us lasagna tonight which I'm really excited about because it's delicious... probably because she's Italian. I wish I were Italian. Meh. 

In other news, I suck at sending out Christmas cards. I'll do it soon, but if I send it to your at school address instead of your at home address, just look forward to it in the new year when you go back because as I previously noted, I suck at sending out Christmas cards. LOVE!"

Until this one table sits down... a couple of guys, and they start talking with me. They were my average customers and I was just happy that they didn't complain or need something every four seconds. I dropped off their bill, which ended up being about $30. The guy hands me a $100 bill. So I tell him that I'll be right back with his change and he says, ""No, keep it."" I started laughing. ""Yeah, right,"" and I began to walk away to go make him change. Then, he and his friend got up and left. He was completely serious and left me a $70 tip. Let's repeat that. A $70 TIP. Damn. Right place, right time I suppose because I know I'm not that good of a waitress. 

I was seeing someone new, but last Saturday when we hung out I realized that he's a complete woman. All he wanted to do was talk about where this was going and how he really liked me and do I want to go out sometime. I just couldn't handle that shit. I didn't want to talk about ""our future."" Chances are we didn't even have one, but if we did, I didn't want to know it just yet. I've never been with someone seriously if we were really close friends first, and him sitting there and just tell me that I'm ""smokin'"" doesn't really make me want to be friends with him. Let's just put it this way. If I can't fart in front of you, this isn't going anywhere. 

I told Matt to lose my phone number. I think it's the best thing for both of us. I'm happy. He's miserable, but he loves being miserable. Why would I want to take that away from him? 

I go to Lansing in three days and then I visit Thad in four. I'm just happy that I get to drive further than Applebee's to do something I really want to do."

I got to play with Lyssa, D, Meggy and Liana on Wednesday night, which I completely needed. We had a margarita/daqueri night, which was fun and good because I didn't drink too much so I wasn't hungover. Actually, I wasn't even drunk. Maybe I'm not much of an alcoholic after all. Thanksgiving was super frigid. None of us could open our car doors the next morning when we were going to leave. Lyssa had it the hardest because she couldn't unlock her passenger door to open it from the inside. Eventually, and without too much frostbite, she got it and then I had to say goodbye.

It's a combination of Matt's here-today-gone-tomorrow act, Lauren finally having her own life and not actually needing me, and all the mediocre guys that keep coming into my life and promising me the world. I know they can't give me that and I know that they can't take the place of the one person in this world that I really want to be with. Seriously guys, I have to deal with it, you do too. 

I can't wait to spend the evening with Alyssa and Dawn tomorrow. I'm so excited I could probably pee because I miss them so much.

Mistake. That's what it was. Believing...that's what it was. I don't know if my feelings are right or okay or either... but I don't care right now. I want to feel love. The crazy kind of love that life doesn't exist without. The crazy kind of love that kills you if it ever goes away.

Jess took me off her lists. All of them. I didn't think I was to blame for anything but apparently I am. I don't know why. Because I'm friends with Alyssa. You can't punish me for that.

Then she left to get movies for her and Jim and we left because Applebee's was closed and Arika was having people over last night.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff>I loved it. I always love going to Arika's. Almost everyone from work (everyone who counted) was there and Arika was nice enough to loan me some 21ness so that I could join in on the festivities. Nevermind that I had actually started drinking about 3 hours previous at Lauren's house. I was feeling pretty good. Not gonna lie. The three of us left Arika's at about&nbsp;2:30am and there is no way in Hell that I should have driven my car. It was terrible. What's more terrible is that you only notice that you shouldn't be driving after you start driving. I literally had to close one eye so I could see the road. I followed Tim back to his house so that I could sober up some. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have made it home. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff>We chilled there for a while and just talked. It was nice. I didn't go home until 4:45am. I kinda wanted to die this morning when I woke up. Kinda.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff>There's been so much shit going on lately. Jess moved out of the apartment and it really sucks because Lyss and Jess were such good friends. I can't verbally say that I'm taking a side here because I won't admit to it, but everyone knows me and knows that I know both of these girls. That's all I'm going to say about that. </FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#ffccff>So right now I'm supposed to be studying for my bio test this afternoon. As you can clearly see, that is not what I'm currently doing. Surprise surprise. You didn't actually think that there was a new Karly taking over did you? Nah. A lot has changed but the really sucky things have stayed the same. Goody. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff>In case anyone was wondering, that whole block on my phone thing didn't actually work, because he still found a way to worm inside my voicemail and it was the very last one I had to listen to when I got out of work last night. Just how I wanted to end the evening mind you. There's nothing I love more than being reminded of how you're NOT about to go see the person you love after a horrible night at work. Good times, good times. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff>The good news is that, not only did I finally hear from Chris, but Hippie Bill actually <EM>does</EM> want me really bad and he told Christina how he and his girlfriend just broke up and he'd really like to hang out with me. Yeah, I really like hanging out with me too. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff>I couldn't sleep at all last night because there were just so many things going on in my head. That and I drank about 6 cups of coffee at work so I wouldn't fall asleep while writing my essay that I didn't want to wake up early to do, but since Mr. Fabulous called me I couldn't go back to sleep. I don't feel depressed or confused anymore, so that's a good thing, I think it's just the changing weather that gets me like this. I can't wait to start thinking about Christmas, but I feel like it's too early so I'm not going to let myself just yet. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff>Tonight I'm leaving my bio class early because Madison is in a little play at school and she's worked really hard on it, so I'm going to that. It's so cute... Paul is going too. He's so allowed to marry Alex now. Not that he wasn't before. I'm so proud of Madi though because she really went out there and got involved in things when she got to White Pine. My biggest goal for her is to not be like me, and so far she's doing great. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff>Okay... I'm going to go pretend to study now. Maybe it will count. </FONT></P>"

"event","So here I am at Lauren's tonight, only she's not here and this is where I'm staying. After working 12 hours yesterday I came home to having no power. Meh. I figured it would be on soon enough, so I showered and went to bed. Endured the usual painstaking phone call from Mr. Wonderful himself, and then went back to sleep. This morning, still no power=no hair straightener, no coffee, no food. Yeah, suck. I had plenty of homework to do tonight and our power wasn't supposed to come back on until tomorrow night, so I called Lauren and asked if I could stay with her and her electricity filled home. So here I am, even though she's sleeping in Birch Run tonight. My mom called while I was at work to tell me our power was back on, but since I have Lauren's only keys, I have to stay here anyway. Not that I would rather be at home. I'm ready to poke everyone in the eye. Twice. 

A few nights ago I was feeding Elisabeth and Lauren walked out of the bathroom and said, ""God, what would I do without you?"" Can I just tell you how good that feels? I'm sure she doesn't need me, but it's nice to know that I make things easier and that she'd rather have me around. I don't want to think about what she would do without me though... that's not going to happen. 

I hardcore flirted with Hippie Bill at work tonight. It's so silly, my little work crush. Better than just doing my job though, right? Heh, whatev. He flirted back and probably wants me a lot. I feel a new fake boyfriend coming on, and this time I won't screw it up. It's okay though, White's Bar is a dive. 

Damn, why am I so tired? No one's here to entertain me. I feel like that probably doesn't matter. Lauren has Napoleon Dynamite. I wonder if it's funny when you watch it alone and sober. Maybe I'll have to find out. 

Period tomorrow! wOOt!"

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Where to start? Let's see, the Halloween party with the pHace was really really fun on Saturday night. I went as a suggestive nurse and pHace was a really hot pirate. I met all of her work friends and there was a creepy priest who was completely in character and it started to drive me nuts. Then there was a referee who just kept saying ""I'm a professional."" A professional what? The funny part is that everyone was married and some guy named Bill who was dressed as a cop was like, trying to initiate a threesome with me and Rachel and it took everything in our power to not die of laughter. Excuse me, for one thing, you're married, and for another you could completely not handle a threesome of any kind. It was about 3:00am when Rachel and I decided to leave but since it was scary Halloween time, naturally the keys were locked in the car, along with our purses and phones. Rachel called her mom so that she could bring us the spare but she said we'd have to stay there because she wasn't driving out to Midland at 3:00 in the morning. So we had to get up super early because I had to open at work. Gah. I really just wanted to go home.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Everything worked out okay though and the good news is that we had that extra hour to play around with so it&nbsp; was okay and still pretty fun in the grand scheme of things. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>So I worked yesterday and I wanted to die because I was either going to throw up all over the damn place or I was going to shit out all of my intestines. My managers had a great time with my hungoverness and decided to try to get me to throw up all day. Good news is that it didn't work. Partly because I started feeling better but mostly because they suck. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Last night I went to Midland again, but this time it was to hang out with Chris. Heh, he loves me. We watched Edward Scissorhands (yes!) and he offered me a fabulous back rub (see Lauren, I told you I was getting one and he didn't even know it) and we cuddled... among other things. It was just really nice to finally spend time with someone who wasn't mean and belligerant or trying to get a blow job all night. Plus he's cuter, so it works out well. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Tonight Brian is having a Halloween party, but I don't think I'm going to go. I haven't really spent a whole lot of time with Lauren in the past few days, and it's not so much that I feel bad about it, but I want to play with Elisabeth and just relax and hang out. I know that that's the only thing I ever really do, but I've decided that it's because that's my favorite. </FONT></P>

"event","Okay, so the funniest thing happened last night. Well, maybe not the funniest, but it was pretty good. While I was working I saw an incredibly familier looking guy walking in and I'm like ""where have I seen this face before?"" Then I realized that it was Elisabeth's face, therefore it was Elisabeth's father. The nerve, seriously. He knows that I work there. Anyway, so I went in the back after I was cut and left Lauren a voicemail letting her know that he was there and that my blood was boiling because I'd get fired if I just punched him in the face. So I came out of the back after eating and Lauren decided it would be a good idea to come visit me at work on this particular evening. She thanked me for calling her. In short... Matt finally got to see his daughter and Lauren and I both hope he remembers it for the rest of his life because it will be the only time. P.S. He's mature enough to hide his face under his hoodie while he was leaving. Why? I don't really know... he and Lauren had already seen each other. I hope it ruined his night... and maybe a few nights after. 

I have so much homework to do. Normally I've very motivated to do it, but as it keeps piling up I feel like there's less and less of a chance that I'm actually going to get it done. I have to interview some of the neighbor kids today for my child psychology class. The report is due on Monday but I feel like I'm going to be busy this weekend so I'm just going to email it to him on Monday afternoon. I don't mind going to school but damn... do I get to keep the rest of my life? 

Halloween party tonight with the pHace (I know you love it). I hope it turns out to be a good time and if not I hope there's at least enough alcohol there so I can sit in a corner and make my own good time. I'm sure it will be good though. pHace and I always find a way to amuse ourselves if nothing else. Hell, we haven't seen each other since like, the Greek Festival. I'm sure we'll have plenty to catch up on. If nothing else I'm excited that I get to see her. 

Eeeeeeeeeugh. Don't wanna do anything today. I'm probably the laziest person you'll ever know.

I talked to him before work tonight. He made up some bullshit about how he was trying to work on our ""friendship."" I told him that I wasn't interested in his friendship and to stop calling me if that's the best he could do. 

I hate it when things get like this. I'm just so sad. I was happy at work tonight... but then I had to leave because things were so slow. How convenient.

I'm randomly going to a Halloween party with the pHace on Saturday so now I have to find a costume because I wasn't planning on dressing up this year. I was thinking either nurse or cowgirl... hmmmmm. Who knows."

I stayed up way too late ""relaxing"" over at Lauren's last night, so I decided since today I have the class that I couldn't care less about... I just didn't go. Is that bad? Probably.

I get to register for winter semester on Halloween. I'm actually pretty happy about that and maybe I won't have to deal with any waitlists this time. Also I found out that I currently have 57 credits. WHAT? How the hell did that happen?

How dare he call me and say those things to me. Now he says he's going to break up with her. Ummm... doubt it. I could kill him for bringing it up again. It was easier forgetting they still exist.

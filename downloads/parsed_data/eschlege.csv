"event","I feel like total ass. My throat hurts, it's full of phlegm (you can thank me for that detail later), and I just want to go to bed. Tonight is the premiere of Andrew and my radio show. I'm planning on telling our listening audience that ""I feel like ass."" The right way to start off a show, isn't it. 

Things have calmed down a bit - I have a little more free time than I did the last x2 weeks. Next week the countdown for 100 days until graduation begins, though. Wow. When you look @ it that way ...

It is snowing - again. (YES, I'm talking about the weather) This has been a really snowy winter. It was fine the first few times - it was even beautiful - but now, it's just become a pain in the ass. I wake up and pull up my shade, and if it's snowing, it sort of fucks up the whole day, because you realize you're going to have to get all bundled up and ready to deal with wet snow and slush. It's just not happy.

I should stop writing until I have something more positive to share."

"event","I just spent an hour trying to describe what kind of light my lamp in my room emits. What kind of homework assignment is that.

After my crazy weekend in and out of Portland bars and the celebratory (eating) events in honor's of Zeke's 23rd birthday in Boston, this weekend was crazy madness. My schedule and the amount of things on my plate - it's overwhelming, but (can you believe it) it's fun. I don't have time to get bored, which is good. Probably the best thing for me right now ...

My teaching assistant sessions went well. Okay, so only 1/2 the kids showed up the first day, I started and ended 15 min's late/early, and I only did one of the activities, but it all felt like it went fine, so - I'm thinking it did. Even the retired older man in one of my classes was getting into my activities. That should count for something. 

Andrew and I got our radio show back - we've renamed it ""Loveshy with Valley Girl and Gay Boy"" (hint: I'm not ""Gay Boy"") and it will be streaming live on the internet @ some point (atleast that's what they told us). It should be fun - we're on Fri nights, which is a more appropriate time for our genre of music than 10:00 AM like we had last semester.

Last night we watched ""10 Things I Hate About You"" - it was not as entertaining as it used to be; it was good, but I think my viewing tendencies have finally changed from the way they were when I was 17. Kind of refreshing to realize that. Except now I have to renew my DVD collection."

"event","Friday has been going a little something like this: I had lunch with Nick today. For those of you who don't know Nick, he and I lived in the same freshman dorm back in the day; there is, of course, more to the story, but it's not appropriate for public - ahem - reading. Lunch was pleasant. He appologized for having a mullet (volleyball team did it), which I didn't think he needed to appologize for; mullets (well, ""style-mullets"") were all the rage with young women in Germany, afterall. It didn't even look that bad. We chatted about experiencing Berlin, about having (Bowdoin) roommates, about getting along with people who are older than us, about New York - it was nice. I would be lying if I didn't admit I was surprised @ just how well it went. The food in the cafeteria, however, was not so nice - and a piece of jello fell out of my mouth/off the spoon while he was telling me something. Not nice.

Last night I went to an artist lecture - this lady, Anne Harris, she is into portraiture. Her paintings are somewhat frightening. Her subjects look really bleached out and dead. I have to go spend more time with her work; I haven't decided how I feel about it yet. It's always interesting to hear artists speak, though. Since I'm on art - I got an internship for the summer with Artistsspace, a non-profit gallery in Soho for emerging contemporary artists. Go to www.artistsspace.org if you're curious.

I am a teaching assistant for intermediate German this semester. Our first unit is ""Arbeit"" (= work). I have to go to some of their classes (sit in on them) and then hold hour-long conversation sessions with them each week. It should be a good time.

I got my hands on The Cure greatest hits CD, and it is awesome. I bet I have already annoyed Clara (my nextdoor neighbor) like hell, because it is practically on ""repeat."" 

This weekend a lot of birthdays are being celebrated - today my dad turns - um, shit - well, he's getting older (I want to say 53, but I'm a sad excuse for a daughter and don't really know for sure), tonight Andrea and I are heading to Portland to celebrate Ashley's birthday and tomorrow I'm driving all the way to Boston to pay my dues (ha ha) to Zeke. He's 23!"

"event","phew - an update is desperately needed. this winter break can definitely be summed up as one of the top 3 winter breaks of all time. although the first x2 weeks went by rather slow, and i spent a ridiculous amount of time in front of the TV, the break as a whole went well. 

Daytona FL was spring break-trash, but it was sunny, and snow-less and i got a tan, so that's all i could really ask for. we did my favorite things: ate junk, laid around in the sun, read books for pleasure (not academic pressure), and looked out at the ocean. we even drove on the beach - exclusive privilege to visitors of daytona. weird sensation. we visited Angie and Peter - a woman my mom used to work with in one of the many hospitals in her lifetime. usually older people ask younger people like myself all kinds of questions, but no - i sat there pretty bored most of the time we spent with them (total - x2 days). they had a lot of junk accumulated in their retired-old-people-house. even a pictures of president bush - they donate money to his campaign. that's what happens when you live in FL where they can't count votes properly. 

after FL i returned to New York and spent some time with old friends, which was great, because i am really lucky to still be in touch with them. i did a lot of thinking this break - it was good, because reflection on one's own life is always a positive thing. especially at this turning point of my 22 year old life. i also talked to a bunch of Bowdoin alumni about their jobs, and i got a lot of positive feedback and advice from them, which is always helpful. i also went to the Artists Space gallery (non-profit) down in Soho with Emma, which turned out to be the gallery i applied to intern at. we'll see if i get it - i'd like to work there, even if it's unpaid. 

i have a fresh new outlook on this semester. i think i may even be getting out of my perpetual pessimistic rut. then again, you might want to check this journal again in a few days to see whether i am a) compaining or b) smiling from ear to ear. 

i hope you're doing well - that means journal reader/you - and that you write me an email at eschlege@bowdoin.edu. talk to me. it's good for you."

i saw 8 MILE - the eminem movie - and as much as i hate to admit this, the movie people made eminem look hot. i don't know how they did it, but he was one to be desired during this film. maybe it was all the hooded sweatshirts. the movie itself gets 3 stars out of 5 - it dragged on and out quite a bit, and i thought kim basinger was going to do drugs of some kind during the film, and she didn't. 

this week and a half has felt like the longest exam period ever. it will not end, and it's moving so slowly. i got two of my exams out of the way at the beginning of last week, and there's one dumb one tomorrow, and then the revisions of my honor's project. can we take a moment: Christmas is 9 days away and i've done no shopping for it. instead of exams, we should have organized trips to the outlets.

how is it possible that i am so incredibly socially awkward around guys - was i born this way - can anyone offer me a solution?! why do i come off looking and sounding absolutely retarted when a guy gives me a compliment? on the same topic - i'm sad, because jin ho told people (guys, mainly) that ""i'm cold."" so - not only am i socially retarted around members of the opposite sex, but on top of that i'm not even lukewarm. how can this be?

"event","good morning - things are going well (wait - what? you think you're reading the wrong livejournal, don't you) ... yesterday was the last day of classes, but i've been such a slacker this entire week anyway, that it really didn't differ from any other day. my roommate Andrew drank a beer to mark the occassion, which was sort of odd, since nobody else was drinking. then he blew beer breath at me, which is one of the most disgusting things in the world. i don't know what compelled him to do that, but i hope he never does it again. 

we went to the Asian Students Association banquet last night (does eating off of paper plates and drinking out of plastic cups qualify as a ""banquet""?), and of course we only talked to eachother and didn't bond w/any of the underclassmen, which i always thought was the whole point of these events. i can't stand how, after eating Chinese cuisine, your clothing always reeks like grease - oh well. Jin Ho - the boy i didn't go to the Jr/Sr ball with - remarked that he liked me better when i've gotten sleep. make with that what you will. isn't everyone more cheery when they sleep well. yes. 

i volunteered to pose for a girl's final photo 2 class project, so we had a little photo session in my room last night. posing in front of a large camera is really awkward. i guess i can cross ""supermodel"" off of my list of future occupations. ha ha. the girl liked the fact that i only have one dimple. i enjoy it too, and it's better than a butt-chin.

in case you couldn't tell, i'm livejournal-ing because i really have motivation issues when it comes to studying for a dance class exam. doesn't that whole phrase seem counterintuitive? like an oxymoron, maybe? i mean, i already did the dance show, what else is there to be tested on? whatever, stop complaining about work, emilie. you're a student, it's your only obligation. 

a week from now i'll be back in New York for break. i have some ""networking"" ( = talking to alumni people about their jobs) lined up (one guy even offered to take me out to happy hour ... um, no. something sketchy about that). i'm looking forward to being in the house again, even if my parents are too cheap to heat it properly."

my roommate Andrew is blasting the new Justin Timberlake CD. no matter what people say - it's a fun collection of songs. Andrew and I were watching 'Making the Band 2' with PDiddy this morning (we're MTV junkies) and it was sad, b/c one of the potential band-members' sister was found in a trash can in Detroit, her body parts chopped up. my eyes were watering - situations like that (even if they aren't happening to you - thank god) definitely make you realize how insignificant your petty, caddy everyday shit really is. god, i am such a sucker for reality-television programming. 

my other roommate Clara broke up with her boyfriend of a semester, so our quad can no longer vicariously live thorugh her romantic relationship. oh well - more Clara for us, and that's always good.

Dance Show madness is over. people who came to the show come up to me (and the other dancerS) and put in their two cents on how they thought the show went. it makes me happy that people went, but it's even more interesting to hear what they can come up with to say about it. this morning someone told me we looked like 'marionettes.' others enjoyed the 'boob-shaking move'. i'm glad everyone found their own niche with which to enjoy the show. 

Clara calls me an 'amateur' photographer which i am, but can i just tell you how much fun it is to take pictures? i can't wait to get my first roll developed to see how it turned out. my subjects were people being themselves. i'm a nerd."

consumed by Bowdoin Dance show. had first real show (w/audience) tonight and it was pretty fun - was self-conscious about breasts flopping up and down and flashing audience the nude legs, but ... we were received pretty well, and it was fulfilling to perform again. realized it will probably be my last dance show of my life; sad realization at that.

turned down Jin Ho for the Jr/Sr ball - had asked him a couple months ago (while I was intoxicated) for him to accompany me, but decided against it afterall, last minute, b/c i have too much work to catch up on. no dress. no shoes. clara said she'd go w/him instead. her boyfriend doesn't dance.

work work work - am doing 2-semester honor's project, so that has relaxed a little. this weekend will be rough - i have 2 finals this coming week (it's not finals week, but oh well), and then one the week after. bla bla. who cares about school work. i'm a senior, dammit.

because of dance show, i've worn scrubby sweatpants the entire week, but tomorrow the jeans're going back on. oh my god. i can't wait. as andrew once said: ""emilie is the only girl i know, whose mood is determined by sweatpants."" it's true."

i've gotten several swift kicks in the ass about how bad i am at updating this thing, so -- here's one for everyone who i owe. it's saturday night and the usual ""you goin' out tonight?"" questioning was going around the hall at dinner - since it is (post-) halloween weekend, though - there were drunk senior guys at one end of the dining hall hootin' and hollerin' and just generally being ... well, guys. one was Jesus (and i'm not talking the guys in Mexico who try to sell you timeshare condos named ""Jesus""), some others were characters from the Royal Tenenbaums (go see it, if you haven't), and there was a ""walk off"" from Zoolander (GO SEE IT, i almost peed my pants in the plane). what a spectacle. speaking of dressing up - Andrew (my roommate) has my mom's eyeshadow-case and is currently turning himself into the fabulously ""emilie-kicked-the-shit-out-of-me""-Andrew. clara was thinking of going as ""Emilie"" (people are always saying how alike we look). i'm glad i've turned into an icon and turned people onto various Halloween costume ideas.

movies: the other night, Andrew and i (yeah yeah - we do a lot together; we're like married couples, who i hate to watch, bickering all the time) were trying to watch the movie Waking Life (don't see it), and although it was visually stimulating, it was just OVER our heads (mine, atleast). sorry Hohos. went to see Drunk-Punch-Love tonight and it was weird. Andrew and Di (my other roommate) seemed to really enjoy it, but ... i wasn't feelin' it. maybe because it wasn't targeted at my age group: the teenyboppers.

scott - i'm really sorry i don't get to see you wear a dress in your play in the cafe - i really suck.

i decided i'm not going to be a talent agent. i ""networked"" (called a Bowdoin alumn who used to be a talent agent in NYC) and - i didn't realize talent agents are basically lawyers. being a LIBRA, i can't choose sides, defend sides or anything like that, so ... plus, you spend 5 years in the mailroom, earning 400/week, and promotion can take forever. it's also very cut-throat. now, does that sounds like something i'd like to do? no.

i don't really know what else is going on. i've managed to stay un-depressed for quite some time now, which is nice. i go through a lot of phases while at this place called college. someone rudely IMed me the other night about flaking on meeting them several weeks in a row - don't you wonder why people don't just go straight to assuming that because i flaked, i never really wanted to see them again? seems logical to me. 

i got a really expensive flashy new camera, and i've been using it to take fun portraits of my roommates and people i know. there isn't too much else for me to take up here. the other day i walked across our ""quad"" and the pathways were covered in leaves - it was like a pictures straight out of a calendar; i felt like a little kid kicking the leaves out of the way. i hope nobody saw me - ha ha."

(note: the barbie purchase was in conjunction with an art project i have to do, not because i enjoy playing with dolls. never did, doubt i ever will) i am much more calm today.

i am supposed to be working on a german paper. obviously i am not. you see what i'm doing instead.

this weekend was pretty uneventful (is that a recurring theme? i think so). i crashed another party i wasn't invited to (is that a recurring theme? i think so), but it wasn't all that fun, and i left early. clara's boyfriend did a ""keg-stand"" at the party, though. it was the first one i'd ever seen. it was hot, though i felt compelled to ask him is he was alright afterwards. gotta make sure and take care of the wild party animals.

scottie too hottie (from Berlin - woo woo) stopped by my room to say ""hi"" today. such a nice young man. i hope i can find a nice young man like him to date me one day. he is, afterall, ""too hottie"" for me."

"event","welcome to emilie's thursday (oh yeah baby it's the weeeekend - hello homework. crap): classes = fine (extra-fine when i had to lead discussion group in art history and didn't die of social-anxiety-panic-attack in the process; also learned some swedish - that's right, you read correctly - SWEEEEDISH dancing this morning w/live accompaniment. definitely taking advantage of the whole ""liberal arts"" aspect of my education), walk back to dorm from classes = interesting. this promotional table was trying to corrupt our innocent college-minds by brainwashing us to buy FUZE, the latest craze in vitamin waters and energy teas and other holistic stuff. the guy proceeded to tell us how good it tastes, how little calories it has, and how one girl at Bowdoin (yeah, fucking right) lost 5 pounds by drinking it. i asked him how much she had to drink, and he said like 7 bottles a day (whoa hello, that is like 21 bucks for the fuze company right there) and that she replaced water with FUZE because water (AND I QUOTE) ""made her feel sick."" WHO feels sick from drinking water (when our bodies are mostly made up of water)? and who is stupid enough to try to sell a product with that kind of logic. FUZE needs some help, it seems.

lots to do this weekend, so if i am absent from the whole entry thing, don't panic. i'm not dead in a ditch somewhere, just busy doing other stuff."

thanks to anyone/everyone who wished me a happy birthday, whether it was verbal/cyber/snail mail or hand-delivered - you remind me that i have friends, and that is the best present anyone could ever give me (screw all the people i used to be friends with, but rejected/was rejected by).

today was rainy, gray and gross. andrew and i did our 2nd radio show, i went to work in payroll for a couple hours (my eyes started glazing over after the first hour), and i left early. this past weekend was sort of fun, but i realize this only in retrospect -- my people and i hit the mall (i didn't spend a dime, aren't you proud of me?), portland old port for some caffeine (weeeeee), and then andrew and i drank (i managed to hover over the toilet without vomitting), and then we shook our booties and went out dancing. good times. 

monday (today): went to ""career in communications meeting,"" only to face hard slap-in-face that i will never be able to work in that high-pressure environment.

have given up drinking for rest of life. what is the point of consuming something that makes me: ill, fat, feel like shit, dehydrated, pee a lot, look like i have deadly red rash all over body, eyes blodshot ... and it's expensive. alcohol is no good.

i am wasting away yet another afternoon that i could be working on one of the billion readings i have to do this weekend. Emilie = slacker. why is it that you can be fully motivated to learn/have a ""thirst for knowledge"" (to quote clara, the hotness) right up until the point when you are given an assignment in college?!

i was drunk last night. drunk enough to write drunk email, drunk enough to be reading things out loud, drunk enough to be lying on the floor laughing in the middle of our hallway w/my roommate clara (she was also drunk, i spelled her name ""calara"" in the drunk email i wrote), drunk enough to ask someone to be my date for the junior/senior ball (which is in December). 

this morning, when i woke up, i felt like shit. i felt dried out like a desert, and all i wanted to do was eat (wait - all i ever want to do is eat. that is funny). the kicker is that i only had about one and half drinks (none of which i paid money for) the entire night. yay for the low-tolerance that is my body.

i need to stop saying that ""i hate school,"" because eventually, i will actually start believing it, and let's face it, i am a big fan of learning. in fact, i love to share what i learn here, so ... for anyone who has ever wanted to feel their ""chakra,"" here is one way you can do it:

""Extend both arms out in front of you, parallel to the floor with elbows straight. Turn one hand up and one down. Now quickly open and close your hands 20 times. Reverse your palms and repeat. This opens the hand chakras. To feel them, open your hands and slowly bring your palms together, starting at about 2 feet apart, moving slowly to a few inches. When your hands are about 4 inches apart you should be able to feel a subtly ball of energy, like a magnetic field, floating between your palms.""

i am trying to make an effort to complain less about being single (and lonely) and about the body (because i like the body, but i also like to complain about it for some fucked up reason). my friend pointed out that complaining about those two things makes you a) desperate and b) sort of pathetic seeming. i don't want to convey that image, atleast not this early in the semester.

i was reading the VillageVoice yesterday while on the trainride home, and discovered this insert about all these upcoming MTV VMA pre-parties. i told Arn about it, and so after dinner we sped back into the city (by car, beep beep) and practically ran to the music store to grab some free tickets (to Moby - although i hate his latest album, oh well - Sasha/Digweed, and New Found Glory). i didn't even bother finding a store clerk, i just grabbed the security guard @ the entrance and pointed to my Voice. he got us the tickets, and said that arn and i looked like a ""nice couple."" that is just so WRONG. SO SO SO wrong. that people think i am dating my own little brother really ""irks"" me [shiver]. at the garage sale, some random woman called arn ""rather tall for a japanese guy,"" to which he responded, ""uh ... that's because i'm half chinese (where is the swiss pride, arn?!)."" i guess arn and i are having all kinds of ID(entity) issues lately.

tag sale - asian style: my dad, arn and i braved the tag sale and survived. we made 99 dollars and 75 cents selling old crap we would've thrown away otherwise. the most surprising item of mine sold = a pair of never been worn, blue satin chinese-print platform shoes (i don't remember what possessed me to buy them in the first place), that i thought would never sell due to their tacky, ugly and scary-factor. there is obviously a market for everything.

this is my last week playing receptionist @ Vontobel. whenever clients or people for meetings come in, i have to ask them if they'd like a refreshment and greet them with a big superficial/kiss ass smile. i guess i get to fulfill my life-long waitress dream by playing office hostess. (note: i haven't spilled any beverages on anyone yet. family-style restaurant - here i come!) 

andrew and di came for the weekend, they saw some of new york city, and they were mad fun. andrew and i purchased bootleg CDs from a chinese lady in soho. there is a whole network of little asian ladies running around with carts of bootlegged CDs that they cover in black plastic when they spot the police - they are great. luckily none of them were being chased by cops when we were there. in sad news today: for those of you who witnessed my manhattan portage messenger bag moral dilemna in Berlin - the beloved red, falafel grease stained bag is no more. it has been replaced by a shnazzy new marine blue colored one. keep that in mind when trying to spot me in a crowd. we did a lot of wallet damage shopping, but it is all part of our continued effort to spruce up the Bowdoin fashion factor. we are trying to move away from those white baseball caps that have turned yellow to something a little more hip - we do what we can for our student body. 

my mother is battling w/the London family as they travel up and down the east coast in the rented mini-van. she actually called me like 10 minutes ago (for those of you who know of my mom's practical, cost-saving, everything-is-too-expensive-and-you-don't-need-it, don't-call-us-unless-it's-an-emergency attitude, you know that her calling at all must mean she is having a REALLY bad time) to tell me how much she hates travelling with them. poor woman - now i feel bad for not going with her. 

""you are ... my fire ... the one ... desire"": this sunday, the new york times devoted the front page of the arts & leisure section to the rise & fall of the Backstreet Boys (did anyone else know that they are pretty much broken up? oh the tears). i think it's the only article i've ever read in full - no, i'm kidding, but it was pretty entertaining. kevin (the one who's like 40) pisses me off."

there is an authentic warhol painting in the office, like 10 feet away from me. it is hot (it's of the founder of the bank). i jammed my finger in a drawer this morning, and i'm waiting for it to turn purple/blue. mom didn't buy arn a normal birthday cake - instead she got his an almond paste-filled U-shaped ""horn"" thing and sprinkled hershey's melted chocolate on it to spell out ""ARN 19."" tasty, but definitely unconventional. 

i'd like to share a little chunk of an email i wrote to someone this morning, b/c frankly - it is too early for me to be creative this morning, so i am subject to the copy/paste method: ""um, don't tell me things like, ""She also tells me to spend my last year at Bowdoin looking for a husband because supposedly it's hard to find one out of college."" let's not live in reality, let's stay in our little hot men-filled world of coffee, magazines, junk food, no weight gain, beautiful sunshine/sunsets, beaches, green grass, shopping, hot clothes and um ... piercings (sure, why not). let's not even give marriage/lovelife after Bowdoin a second thought. it is just too painful.""

i also wanted to take this opportunity to appologize (""i'm so sorry"") to any friend of mine that i have ever flaked on (emma & kristin ... this is especially for you) - i am really working on not ""pulling Emilies"" anymore, and i have nightmares about how mad you get at me for doing it.

BUT, she had a good time, and told her dad she wanted to come back. he told her that she could come back @ Xmas time, but Lily said, ""but Emilie will be gone by then!"" touching story, isn't it.

back to reading about sex (that i'm not having), clothing, and celebrity."

the office kitchen just exploded and water started shooting out of the wall. one of the girls in the office - the one who i think hates my guts, we won't name names - comes up to me and says ""did you JUST notice that?"" and so i had to lie and say ""yeah - like two seconds ago!"" the truth is, i had seen it earlier (20 minutes earlier), but nothing was shooting out then, and i just thought someone had spilled a big cup of water on the counter. i mean, i spill things all the time, so ...

i walked into the GAP for the 6th time in the last x2 weeks. (guess what i do on my lunchbreak, kids) i don't even know why i keep going in there, the GAP is like a black hole that sucks you in. it's not like they are getting new exciting stuff, and i think i am weirding out the sales people, b/c they see me so often. plus, everything they make (with the exception of the ""favorite T"" - that's right, if you own it, check the label) is produced in some horrible, inhumane sweatshop in Asia or India. i shouldn't be supporting that. 

remember the ""crazy man"" from the office who taped his cookies and junk food with scotch tape? he has called from switzerland x3 times today, to remind me to send him his newspapers/mail to Turkey. i keep reassuring him that they are on the way. 

tomorrow i go to the dentist, which means ... HALF DAY!"

can we all take a moment to talk about the old man who was continuously staring at my breasts all the way to grand central station this morning? he wasn't even trying to be discrete about it, so ... not only was i late for work - train was late - but i also had to try to find various ways to cross my arms in front of me, so as to block his side-view angle directed straight for the cleavage - it is hard to be a woman sometimes.

i saw Lord of the Rings this weekend. arn and i did the suburbia-cruising-thing (= driving around aimlessly) and ended up @ BESTBUY. arn promised it wouldn't be gory/bloody, and it wasn't really, but i was still scared shitless most of the movie (to compensate for my fear, i talked through most of it, and kept asking ""who's that?"" and ""why is that slimy orge coming out of the earth?""). it was okay. my friend erin was right - the androgynous hot elf w/the blonde hair and pointy ears was the highlight of the movie.

at sherwood beach (CT) yesterday, arn and i spotted a woman (a mother!) in a bikini that was JUST WRONG. it was a) WHITE (BAD color idea for something that is supposed to get wet, not see-through) and b) a THONG (i am the official anti-thong spokes person; i am not ashamed of my underwear lines and neither should anyone else be). we managed to enjoy the beach nonetheless.

mom comes home today - the leftovers have almost all (arn and i are not fans of the shepard's pie dish, grrr) been eaten and none of the plants died, thanks to my skilled watering - and that will restore order back into the house. i'm sure she will have plenty of descriptive stories about the excursion to Canada w/the ""London family."" i am forseeing a lot of complaining about the screaming kids.

i started filling out my U.S. Citizenship forms (that's right, kids - i am on my way to becoming just like you, so i don't have to be an ""alien"" anymore) last night, and some of the questions they ask are really bizarre. one of the questions was ""have you ever been a member of the Nazi party?"" um, okay.

fuck, someone just gave me more address-inputting to do (my favorite)."

Patrick (aka the other intern) and i went to FAO Schwarz during our lunch break today, and it was awesome. i haven't been inside that toy store in forever (maybe since i was 15), and it still has the same appeal (and impressive marketing power - although i'm 21, i wouldn't mind getting one of those silver robot dogs - b/c, you know, real dogs scare me) it once had. 
Patrick is a nice guy. today we talked about ""street parties"" (boo Love Parade - for those who were there, you know what i mean), skiing (which i don't do - anymore), and then we had to battle the cashier-guy, who kept trying to get us to pay together (it's not like we're dating!), when we wanted to pay separately. (sidenote: i'm glad to be back in a country that sells MOUNTAIN DEW.)

arn and i have the house to ourselves this weekend, which means we will be doing nothing but eating leftovers (my mom left us enough leftovers for a month, not a weekend, and she expects it all to be eaten by the time she returns - crazy woman). none of our friends are around, and the ones that are, are not really interested in coming out to the boonies to hang out (i don't blame them). maybe we'll hit something beach-like again. nature calls.

i miss Berlin, i miss the people i hung out with there 24/7. maybe it is just this ""in limbo""-period (some call it summer break), between one thing ending and another thing starting. i am excited about going back to Bowdoin, but i'm also kinda scared (when am i ever NOT scared?), b/c it's been so long since i have been in that kind of environment (homogenous, preppy, rich college kids, wearing khakis, flipflops and basecall caps - fuck, i am going to get hatemail from some people, i can feel it ...) 

i watered the plants around our backyard last night for the first time in my life (due to absence of mother-type; she usually does it). i soaked our entire front staircase (note: no plants grow out of the staircase), and i was running back and forth between the turny-knob for the water and the other end of the hose that was spritzing out large amounts of water, flooding our front lawn (doh!). some things are just more difficult for me than others.

think happy thoughts."

"event","good AFTERNOON kids (that's right, i was actually assigned some ""work"" this morning - inputting addresses, my eyes hurt from staring at the mini-writing on business cards - so this entry is coming in a lil' later in the day)

it's day 4/week 2 in the office (!), and i keep answering the phone eventhough i'm not supposed to (they are fixing the voicemail = my baby) and are trying to test it. it's like second nature to me to just grab the phone (ooh, that's a bad sign) when the damn thing rings, though, so i am having a hard time holding myself back. maybe i should sit on my hands. 

there is a crazy man (i won't name names) in the office, and the receptionist (= me, until i get out of here) doubles as his assistant. he has an entire drawer in the office kitchen full of JUNK food, aka cookies, chips, sweets. the man scotch tapes his JUNK meticulously, so that nobody else will eat any of it (two girls stole some Kudos bars once, and later found out they were actually two years old - gross; the man thanked them for reminding him to throw them out). he also gives me all kinds of - ahem -""interesting"" things to do, such as mailing his magazines (The Economist) to random eastern european countries which he travels to. he definitely puts some spunk into the office environment, and he talks really fast.

i am really looking fwd to the weekend, b/c damn! i am on my second caffeinated beverage of the day, and that is the only substance that is keeping me going right now."

[note: wearing sleeved shirt today, look like a librarian somehow]

i am oozing happy right now (and it's 9:45 AM, and i just proofread 20 pages of financial BLAH, so this is good). i just received one of the nicest emails form one of the nicest boys i have ever gotten to know in my entire life (yay Berlin). he has fully redeemed all of the evil boys in the world in one swoop.

my mom rented a mini-van for the large London family. mom and mini-van is NOT a good combination. in fact, the whole visit from the large London family is not agreeing w/anyone in the family. my mom is stressed, my dad hates all the screaming kids and the tissues they leave everywhere, arn hate how stressed my mom is, and i am annoyed too. last night was depressing: my mom disrespected me (my age, and the fact that i live - sort of - in the house) by banishing me to sit off by myself in the fancy dining room (we usually eat in the kitchen together), b/c the large London family (and their x4 kids - argh!) take up too much space. (i am obviously the most disposable family member). THEN, a chair freed up (lil' kids eat fast), and my mom STILL insisted that i was just fine, eating by my lonesome self in the other room, eventhough my uncle was telling her to call me back. even arn got to sit at the adult table. i felt like such a loser. 

i am sad i missed a special E!news report on Gwyneth last night (i'm sure you're all aware of my obsession with the new york socialite/heartbreaker/ fashionista/oscar-winning actress). nobody is allowed to watch the real world movie (vancouver the lost season) - what the hell was that? even arn agreed: ""it's so fake."" i caught some of the Anna Nicole (Smith) show. i think she has some problems. her poor son. 

only two hours until lunch - i am going CD shopping (wohoo). i should just start replacing food with CDs. no, then i might pass out.

i think i am dressed a little too scantily for the office this morning. i was watching all the other commuting working women today, and i've come the conclusion that SLEEVES (no matter what size, shape or form) are absolutely neccessary. um, yeah - WHO has a tank top on. sounds like a shopping opportunity to me. i am making BANK working here (i shouldn't be bragging about this, but i've never had a real paying job - i try to block that whole hellish camp counselor experience). i got my first paycheck yesterday and DAMN! everyone should be a receptionist for their dad.

i called a friend of mine last night ('drea) to wish her a happy belated birthday, but she wasn't there, so i left a message with her little brother. he laughed at me for calling after the birthday. damn kids. (no, he was cute) i also talked to clara lee last night. she is going to try to set me up with anyone who will date me at Bowdoin this fall (god, that sounds sad, doesn't it). i am REALLY scared about this, b/c boys scare me. i am going to have to re-learn how to talk to them, since it was TOTAL DROUGHT SEASON in Berlin. (kristin: ""i saw this REALLY hot guy on the tram today, and then i realized his hand was on another man's thigh."") fuck it - i need to stop racking my brain over the boys-thing. 

so my uncle and his rather large (x4 kids - that is large to me) family from London are over right now. last time they were over i got huge fuzzy slippers in the shapes of unidentifiable animals (you know, the slippers that go on sale at xmas time). i got a nice picture frame with fairies and sparkly glitter all over it this time. kind of britney spears-ish, but i did get that belly piercing, so i guess i am trying to be her. my mom is like ripping her hair out because she is so stressed about their visit. her voice level has risen in both volume and speed (if you know my mom, then you know that's scary). i feel bad for her, though, but i don't know hot o help her either. so, i try to empty the dishwasher and clean up after the little kids as much as i can. i know, that's not enough."

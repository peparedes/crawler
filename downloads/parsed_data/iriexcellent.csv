"event","...here is an email I wrote to a friend I havent talk to in a bout 5 months.

You're alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well, now I can send a famously ridiculously long e-mail.
So, I don't even remember last we e-mailed so I will start at the beauty pageant, cuz I know I had sent the link to the pictures of that...
-So that was my big debut into singing on stage.  It was also my second to last show ever.  The last one was my final for my vocal lessons class where I sang on stage at 6 pm in a dining area at school...it was rather embarressing in the beginning but I like to do things I wouldn't normally do. 
-Also, you should see my final project for Art class (I may have mentioned this in a phone call or previous email) but god it came out beautiful (charcoal self portrait).  Like, I am usually very sketchy in my artwork, I am not good at coming out with a finished looking piece, and this came out really well, I mean naturally there are many things I wish I could have done better, but it's about as good as I could have ever hoped for.  It would have actually looked ok standing next to your stuff unlike all of my highschool stuff (hence why I never brought any in). 
Graduation went well...  
-My real dad and that side of my family came to visit my school for the first time EVER a few weeks beforehand because he wasn't invited to the actual event (not enough tickets).  It was a decent visit, but as per usual, he did things to piss me off like not wait for me to be done with class before going to dinner, and having me skip my art class twice to go to bush gardens, and cancelling both times.  Other than that, my lil sis went to my Japanese drill class, and copied off of my quiz and surprised the teacher.  We all went minigolfing and as we got there 5 minutes before it opened, my dad, stepmom, sister (16 yrs old) and I pregamed with coronas and smirnoff malf beverages in the parking lot hiding behind our cars.  Also, I had one of my pictures chosen to be in the art show, which was going on while my dad was there, so that was nice as he is the main artist in the family (my mother was actually quite good in her day as well, but now she's been reduced to drawing bunnies on Easter eggs in crayon). 
-For the actual graduation weekend, the moms side came down with a grandma and an aunt.  It was a bit of an awkard mix, but I got to hang with friends a bunch, my dad (step dad) came out on graduation night and drank as much as my b/f which meant he was on pint 6 at 1 am.  While I don't know how you handle yours, this particular 43 yr old man did not do so well the following morning with the packing and the driving to NJ. 
So now we are at the summer...
-So I too suck about keeping in touch with people.  I havent heard from a few people at all since the end of school, and I haven't been great about getting to phone calls as I have no cell service at home.  E-mails are prolly my new best friend. 
-I went to France for a week with my grandmother.  Took 110 pictures.  Tried to be a little too artsy for using disposable cameras (I HATE BAD LIGHTING).  The trip was real cool, I mean, granted it was with my grandmother, but it was also was Paris.  I'll show you pics one day, some came out pretty cool. 
-Other than that I have been studying my butt off for a Morgan Stanley interview.  I had the first one, and made it to the second/final round.  What's weird is that I am the only one in the second/final round....Soooooo, I am hoping it is a relative shoe in so long as i prepare for it real well.  Once I get that job, my life is gonna be a lil sucky since the hours are crazy in the beginning and I will be studying for some standardized tests that you need to take to do the job.  But its 50,000 starting plus bonuses, and if you do well, it goes up real quickly.  My main goal is to make a ton of money, pay off school, save a bunch, and after 10-20 years retire/quit and teach highschool until I am way old.  Then I become a substitute teacher until I die at 107.  Its quite the plan I know :) 
So final round interview on July 13th. Going to a spa (graduation gift certificate) on the 14th, so hopefully its a ""Congratulations"" massage, not a ""oh well, better next time"" massage.
 
Ok, well I am sure there is more, but I think I will let you get back to work, or whatever else it is that you do :-p.
 
-Lauren-





*** The interview is actually on the 14th now.***"

"event","So the break wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
I suppose this isn't any surprise, I mean, I was DREADING it and it was a school break, how can that be bad?
Highlights: brendan missing his first train and not leaving me until 12:30 in the afternoon rather than 6 am, sleeping in the office instead of the basement, turkey, black friday shopping
Medlights: my mom fighting with my aunt BUT actually making up within the half hour, which included quotes like my aunt- ""Deanna, I love you"", my mom- ""I know"", my brother to me whispering ""isnt that where she is supposed to say 'I love you too'?"", Jarhead- good movie until it dissapoints you at the end, but GOD Jamie Fox was awesome in that, reminded me of Jules a little bit.
Lowlights: sleeping in the car on saturday night, only having money to eat turkey and a piece of chocolate for dinner sat night.  Still being poor on sunday and only being able to afford tuna for both brunch and dinner on Sunday (mixed one with easy mac for lunch and made a sandwich with the other bit of it for dinner), getting badgered by my family for wearing a tanktop (slutty eh?), not being hungry enough to eat more sweet potatos

anyways, also saw harry potter a week ago, ...pretty good, didnt focus enough, tried to do too much and in doing so didnt do enough for any one subplot, and the music felt like background music, didnt really enhance or draw the viewer in as it has in the past.  But because the book was so awesome, it was impossible to actually make a bad movie.

I heard of a few L & L plans, any info any of you ppl?
I bought a new corset just in case!"

"event","So I am kinda miserable, and I know I have no right to be, but it seems I just can't help it.
I am excited to see my siblings, however the parents I only like to see on either christmas break or summertime.  These short meetings end up being nothing but a chance for them to make a quick evaluation of my attitude and quality of life, and unfortunately I am waliking into this one stressed out of my mind.
Not to mention I am not even going home.  I want my own bed, not the dreary basement floor in some unfinished room with no walls, just lined up planks of wood, the light fading into the darkness.
Also, the family is never quite as good to be around when with extended family.
My dad is out of it, my mom is stressed, my bro is with my cousin, and my sister and i bond immensly while i uncomfortably try to get on ok with my other cousin.  Not that it is so hard, but she is right at the age (16 almost) where she feels like she knows everything i know, and makes me forget that she doesn't.  So then I get all comfortable and talk about my highschool life, which was far from normal, and say something stupid that comes back to bite me in the ass.  I better stick to the 8 yr old (my sis).  There, I know my boundaries.
So yea, not pleased by this break at all.  My boy is leaving me at 6 am to go to the richmond train station, rather than chilling with me for a few hours at the library after getting a good 8 hours of sleep and then driving out.
Jerk.
i mean, we got over it, but it still makes me sad.
I have my ""Blue Day Book"" all set and primed for the moment I need it most.
Cried today alot about a lot of things:
empty campus
brendan leaving before me
being broke
not looking forward to this break
being stressed/too much work
my dog being dead.
ok ok, for those of you in the know, she's been dead for months now (died august something).  The thing is, I had very little time to ever grieve.  First, I was hiding it to stay strong to help the younger folk in my family get beyond it, and then i was at school soon afterwards.  Christmas is her ""birthday"" , santa got her for me about 14 years ago and as we knew she was about one and didnt know her age, we made x-mas her b-day.
So this is the first year I am not buying her a gift, and it hurts alot.
I am also going back home for the first time to a house without her trying to eat the chocolate chips, and rubbing her snotty nose on my khaki pants (black lab = black snots)
See, now I am crying again, cept this time its ok, cuz the campus is empty so no one will see me."

"event","So I was thinking the other day (and it was these thoughts that drove me to write my autobiography- or to start it) but that it seems people are of very different opinions of me depending on what they see and that no one ever can possibly ""get me"" if they try and judge me at any given time.  I REALLY wish I could explain this, but all i can call it is a psuedo manic depression.  I do not have the extreme symptoms, however- my main reputations in highschool amongst teachers were 1)excuse making, lazy, procrastinating, manipulative, lying, lacking in work ethic, cocky and 2)hard working, motivatited, bright, innovative, creative, exciting, etc
why is this?
well I thought I could try to merge these two people when I came to college, and it seemed to work.  For  a while I was relatively stable.  Then last spring came and I failed out.  Then I got a 3.2 last semester, and started getting all A's this semester, and right now? I havent done a stitch of school work for a week.  I cant stand it, I try to get motivated to do it, and i fall asleep, get nauseous or something like it. I feel as if this trend, that has gone on all my life should have a name or label.  Yet I seek counsling, and no one can ever tell me what's wrong.  I think i am looked at as having a sort of ""addiction"" to failure.  Like the oscillations are viewed as more of a ""well shes doing well now...oops, she slipped up, ok shes doing well again"" rather than having both parts being identified as problematic.  The motivated side isn't ""doing well to me"" I think too much, plan too much, become overly aggressive with work untill I burn myself out or become frustrated- that is just as problematic as the being burned out and not doing well.
I need a fix."

So last night, boy comes home with some sorta salmon and shrimp thing from catering that was awesome, we exchange half our gifts, stay up too late because in my efforts to bond, I have become an obscene geek and actually ENJOY playing starcraft, and go to bed super late.  Only to wake up and find my 8 am is cancelled and I get to sleep more.

2) I feel as if the movie ""Sabrina"" is highly underrated.  I bought it from the 5.50 bin at walmart b/c I remembered enjoying it in the past and damn, it definately one of the best romance films without a sex scene I have ever seen.  Harrison Ford is fabulous, and Julia Ormond pulls off the hairdo like no other."

"event","So tomorrow is my first day of observing 6th graders at Walsingham Acadamy (Catholic School, bleh)
So, do I bring a notebook?
What do I wear?
I am gonna feel kinda creepy.
I am sorta relived and sad that it is sixth and not seventh or higher that I am going to observe.  I can actually separate myself from this age group and acknowledge them as younger, whereas I had my first boyfriend in seventh and so a part of me will always still be there and my memory is full of painstaking detail.
For the psych majors out there, seventh grade I under went a stagelike change in development in my movement from late childhood to adolescence.  Granted, I don't feel I was ever a late child.  I mean, no one can say they never were a child.  Sure I mimicked bugs bunny way to often for my parents taste, and at some point liked sesame street.  However my Barbie Dolls always had tales involving torture, love, betrayal, etc... I hated playing house or school.  I had my first make out dream in second grade.  Wrote about it in fourth for the assignment of writing your favorite dream.  I had to redo that o ne because the teacher said mine was innapropriate.
I began believing in fate and love in second grade, and had this reaffirmed in 4rth when Ben Miller and I were both Vampires for halloween.  I mean, it was meant to be.  
But sixth grade is like a black hole for me.  It was the first real ""uppergrade"" as my school went from preschool to eigth grade.  fifth was when you moved to the upperclass hall and got the priveleges (electives) and downfalls (shorter recess) but sixth is when you got the teachers you would have for the next 3 years. 
I am oldest of 6 and it is strange how different all of them go through childhood.  I guess that is why I am both excited and nervous.  Am I gonna be llike the hot sub/teacher/assistant/etc. that we all had once and thought was sooooo not old enough to teach us?
(Mr. DeLala in 8th grade history- looked IDENTICAL to tom cruise and said cheesy things like ""Persistance"" while nodding his head at you while you are trying to get a different teacher to accept a late homework)
Or will I be like the mom in the song 1985?  Totally missing what's ""in"" and seeming like a creepy goofball to these  kids? 
Should I just record and distance myself?  What is to be gained through interation? Will I lose my objectivity?
And come on, most importantly, what do I wear? I mean, how do you look Cool AND Catholic School Girl......don't answer that.
OK, off to J. Hardy's

Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight"

"event","So I began the semester with much vigor- some bad shit happened and here I am being a waste case after days of being a waste case.
It sucks not having anything REALLY wrong, but a lot of little things not right.
There is always a feeleing of dissatisfaction/ dissapointment and when this occurs with the majority of the parts of your life- then you feel generally displeased with the world.
But then there are people dying, sick, grieving, homeless, schooless, the poorer and needier, more lonly, more desparate, the busier, etc....all the extreme cases of every little problem that you have and so you feel guilty about feeling shitty/ about complaining/ or about not doing better.
The ""you"" is so clearly ""me"". 
I hate this situation  I can't even think of anything good to rant on.
I just feel incomplete at times.  I am not a druggie/rebel/alchie/partier- I lack connections and a tolerance.
I am not a nerd, smartiepants, genius, etc- I lack the grades.
I am not a slacker, loser, laid back, relaxed, etc (note: these are not considered synonyms)- I have too much conviction and motivation.
I am not average, normal, one with ups and downs, even emotions, and a normal life- i have too many mood swings,I feel/think too deeply, and fuck- look at my friends.

I don't know what I am.
I mean, this has always been my problem.  I never had a close group of friends in highschool because I was in part in so many groups that I was never close with any of them- and so when I was having a really bad day, there was nobody to go to.  I couldnt imagine having so many friends and so little support.

I mean, I have come away with two good friends from pre-college, but they are a result of years of trying to form real bonds and I suceeded with two.  And even then- there have been complications.
Now I am at college and I vowed not to do that again.  I mean it isn't a problem with being open I don't think, I am very open to ppl and with myself.  But sure enough I am in a similar position.  So many aquaintenances.  I won't lie- things are better than before, but they also have more potential than before.  There are so many people who I wish I had the courage to call and hang out with and become better friends with.  But I am so stressed and busy and scared to follow through and so I have my group of five, including my boyfriend, that I talk to with any regularity.  May be I am doing worse than highschool.  At least from there I got two close friends from a school of about 600, now I am at 5 close friends of a school with 5000+.
And I apologize, Justin- make it six . I was counting people I see often, but my couple of weeks knowing you at school, 3 social visits and year of online communication has made you one of my closest friends (doesn't that sound strange almost?)  
And from highschool there is a third that while I do not hang with him, or talk as much as I would like, Jason W. you will always be amazing.

In anycase, I will stop complaining- I prolly sounds like a stupid little girl.  I need a hug."

"event","So I went to the Norva for the first time to see Bright Eyes as a Christmas gift (well one of them) from my boy.  The first band was Tilly and the Wall and was decent.  I really liked the two girls that tapped danced as their instrument. One of them looked like the woman from the first two seasons of 24 , arch nemesis womman of Jack Bauer (killed his wife).  It was groovy.
The second band needed me to be high, it begged me, pleaded me to be high.  It was screeching so awfully for me to be high.  God they sorta sucked. (Real definative I know)
But seriously, one nasal woman, one operetic woman, drums, 2 keyboards and some Bhatian man who rapped.  Oh, and a video that seemed to have a theme vendetta against sailors who gave blow jobs, a cartoon of a mix between abe lincoln and simba, white horses, and zebras.  SOOOOOOO weird.  Oh, and te bhatian man had an indian chief headdress on. It was called Coco Rosie, and with a better sound balance may have been good, I recomend the song Madonna.
Lastly, and mainly, there was brighteyes.  Brighteyes ruled. Seriously, I love them.  Cept they didnt play ""lover I dont have to love"" which was a tease.  But I dealt.  It was all so wonderful, tall people sucked.

The 4.00 burger was fucking delicious.
So it wasnt as good as dresden dolls, but it could not have been.  I nearly want to have amanda palmer's babies.  
But anyways, thats all for now, dont get greedy. Ciao bella, back to moving shit."

"event","Ok, so since my last post, life happened.
So much shit I could write about but have been way to lazy/busy/facebook addicted/ or otherwise engaged.
Thus I am not even going to try to really catch up on stories.
Right now, I really want a puppy.  I have fish.  They are cute, they die to easily and I totally blame the inconsistency of heat in my room, the travelling from NJ to VA, and the power failures in the first 2 weeks at my dorm and thus filter issues.
But my black moors are still alive (I have 2 of them and I want them to make babies) and 3 neons, 1 whitecloud, 1 catfish, 1 angel, and a hideous goldfish.
Deaths were a tricolor shark, a pretty goldfish, another tricolor shark, 2 velvet swords.

Then there are the bettas, and they are pretty and insane as always.

Enough of fish, I want a goddamn puppy.
My dog is still alive at home, poor thing, 14 yrs old, arthritis, thyroid cancer, and such.
She's beautiful though, I like the gray hair on the black coat.
I want a puppy.

And Brendan is moving out today.  I am a smo and not helping much, but I can't deal with it.  I don't want to actually realize we are leaving this room for good.  At least he is staying in Williamsburg at Laura's condo.  Thank god or her place.  Storage would be a bitch.  Yay to her mom.

And damn my low tolerance.  I mean really, I went to speak easy last night and planned to come back and drink to I,robot, but naturally I fell asleep and erin and laura left, and now here I am, in a cleaned out room, with a bottle of unopened crat waiting for next saturday cz i dont drink more than one night a week (hopefully).  Interesting.

May be i will have to go into Human Sexuality sloshed one of these days.....I wonder if he has class on blowout.  That'd be mad crazy.
Speaking of sexuality, I was discussing L & L and I need to find something to top last yr.  I was sOOOO pleased with last yrs outfit (I am a huge dork and spend like 100$ every yr on new shit for that.) But I don't know what to do short of getting a boob job to look better, I mean, not that I personally looked unbeatable compared to others, I am not that cocky, but it was the best i have seen me look.  
So, I need to start the planning.  M air will be longer, so that will be something to work with.  Hmmmmm....... Know of any good lingerie sites?

I need to change my icon.

I have just the thing....."

Got most of what I wanted, and that which I did not get- I have gift cards!
Got some grades back- not great but better than last semester (4 F's) so far the tally is: A-, B+, and C+ (damn you raj).
Doing returns and shit today.  Fun stuff.  May be I will find something pretty at Vickies, although more likely than not I will just buy a bra- I am boring and I already spend money on corsets and shit for last liquor and lingerie.  Then again it is never too soon to begin shopping for next yr- senior year has to be nice :)
And the weather can suck it- too cold and not enough snow."

"event","I have come to discover a deperate need to be 21.  All the people I surround myself with at home are twenty one and it is just not fair.  I know that people say that it is not as good once you actually are, however this isn;t about the ability to booze.  I do that enough for my taste, but I hate hanging with people before and after they hit up the bars.  There's an entire culture I am missing out there.  Steve goes to ""Johnny's"" that looks kinda fun and unpretentious.  Lauren goes all over with her friends from school, and well I sit at the Station waiting for my take out with the pretentious fifty-ish old men who ask me questions like ""Do I have a daddy fetish.""
Now while such a question is a little disturbing, I would have loved to answer, ""I don't know, buy me a drink and ask me again"" throw back a shot, and walk out laughing, putting on my new leather rabbit lined gloves.
Oh well.  June twenty- third.....here I come!
In addition, hope everyone's holiday season is rockin.  Curse you 95.5 for having only Christmas music from Thanksgiving through Christmas... Doesn't anyone like normal music in addition to x-mas? The jews want their rock dammit!
Well, I need to go back to Christmasing...cleaning my room, baking cookies, preparing gifts!"

"event","So I had up an icon of a nostalgia based painting I did the other night and I thought that would last a while.  However, while it is still my computer wallpaper, a new tradgedy has struck.  Draco- the oldest of my betta fish- has passed on.  And the photo here is how I found him, sprawled on the floor, mouth open, gills out, lying next to the turtle.  After weeks of sitting at the bottom of the bowl after I took the female betta out (he was starving her by not letting her get to the top for food), he finally died of heartbreak....so may be love isn't as great for fishie lives as it is for people.  
""And at the moment of his death, the night became alive with those stars. And thus was born the Dragons' Heaven. But when we die, not all dragons are admitted to this shining place. No, we have to earn it! And if we don't, our spirit disappears as if we never were. ""

"event","Last year I asked a a guy if he had ever been in love before in any context - the idolization type (where you are not in a relationship with the person) or in the concrete fleeting thoughts of marriage type (dating).  To which he replied that he had not and that it was not  much of a priority.  I thought this was terrible as I have been a love fanatic for years.  While I have fallen in love with many, it can be said that I have definately romantically loved three men thus far.  The first one being the longest and the third being the most concrete.  And while two of these involved a LOT of introspection, crying (hey- I am a girl- what do you expect), pining, idolization, and so forth, they have made more difference in my life than probably a majority of friendships.  (Not you, of course you are special. YOU are the best, *insert name here*!)
My first boyfriend was in seventh grade.  He used to say I love you at the end of conversations and I always felt sort of weird about saying it back.  It felt fake and unrealistic.  Ironically enough, he cheated on me, I dumped him in an overdramatic fashion (including hanging up on him) and then pined away for years crying to the song ""I'll be missing you"" by the now called P.Diddy (what a stupid name).  He will never be forgotten.
The next I actually dated for a considerable amount of time.  He reads this thing so I can't be too complimentary  or his head will get too big (yes steve, I mean you).  This one was actually the opposite of the first. I overused the 3 words, and he never believed me.
I digress.  My friend since then seems to have experienced this feeling.  While I cannot put the title of ""love"" on it, he definately feels the longing, the idolization (she is not as perfect as you make her seem, I promise you), and the thoughts of ""what if"".  When I first met him he seemed so carefree about his course and detemined that it was what he wanted.  It was what he always wanted, he was 'liveing his dream'.  And now he seems so uncertain.  I have never seen him like this.  And yet, after thinking about it for a while now, I still think it is a good thing.  I would not be where I am if it were not for the loves of my life.  Christ, I wanted to go to college originally to join the CIA to keep track of one, and to help out the other.  Granted my goals and ambitions have changed since then, but the point remains the same.  I am driven by emotion and I love that, no matter how crappy it feels sometimes.  On the otherhand, I understand that it can suck...alot. And I wanted to let you know (yes you) know that I am sorry for everything you are feeling and that I can't seem to help.  Call me one of these days, as always, I managed to lose your cell phone number (I know the area code and the first three digits I think).

On an 'upbeat note'- I have now typed this for the second time, as my computer has issues with the internet and likes to close it on me...so I shall now study for Stats, ...boo finals.

P.S. Anything Going on on friday the 17th?
     Dorms are closed but boy and I shall be here."

"event","And So I leave for my final Rodriguez appointment of the semester.  After two semesters at the councilling center, I have seen two very different approaches taken to discover and discuss my oddities.
Bonnie: most issues were a function of my family history - the divorce, their issues, the remarriages, the italian 'thing' (nothing is ever wrong and if it is you don't talk about it and thus it doesn't exist, and trying to please my parents and not myself schoolwise..
  So results of her: I switched my major from computer science to psychology and rather than 4 Fs like last semester, I am looking at what at worse wil be 1 C and 4 Bs, at best will be two Bs and 3 A's

Rodriquez: centers on the idea of my not being able to express myself, that I also try to pleae my friends too much and I am fake and thus not really able to ever uderstand myself...hence the inability to express it...he is a little stereotypical likes to talk about feelings sorta guy, but hes cool
   So results of him: I have pissed off two friends of 2.5 yrs or so, begun sociallizing again (hadn't really been to psi u much since freshman year), talked with people I would have never met otherwise, and had a pretty good year.

Some may think (ie my family) therapists are a sign of weakness, but I heartily disagree.  They are fun...I get to talk alot, I get to study them little do they know) and their approach for my own gain, and thus far it has been productive.

Greatest words by a therapist ""I am struck""
  You would think with all they have read in getting their doctorate- nothing I could say would seem anymore than a general case study.  I win.

Quotes from my father:
I was 12 yrs old...
""You are both smart, but it's differnt.  Your brother is smart in that he is going to become a doctor or something like that.  You are smart in that you are going to change the world.""
...then when I was in college and they had long since given up this idea- wanting me to go into business, economics or sales (I wanted to be a teacher)...
""You a psychology major? That's like teaching a cow to be a butcher.""
He's Sweet.
Off to my meeting!"

"event","Ok, so I spent an hour or so writing a beautiful thing- and the computer got crazy and deleted it.  Let me try todo this again in a more concise manner (it was 2 pages long).
To those who were offended:
I am not quite sure how to begin this again.  I hope your finals are maravelous and life is good or getting better, as the case may be.
I miss Hunt Hall. 
I miss freshman year.
I miss my friends.
I miss my life.
But everything has changed.  It took me a long time to really understand this, and I am still not quite over it.  Inside of me there is a little voice that says everything will one day be all right again.  But after last semester, I cannot listen to that little voice.  I just have to hope it is right and that things will amazingly turn out wonderful.
Last semester I avoided thinking about how people and scenarios changed.  I lost site of my own limitations and tried to keep up every friendship I had made here by never doing work or going to class because that would mean I would miss seeing someone or hanging out with someone.  At the same time I was also trying to please the folks at home by taking classes that I thought they would be happy with.  I hated my classes, I hated being fake, I hated being the ""lazy"" one that didn't get work done, but I just felt really empty and I assumed only friends could make that go away.  I became really depressed, ate alot, engaged in habtual risky behavior and spent weeks sleeping 20 hours a day.  I went home, argued with the parents and was told to move out.  School was awful, life sucked, and I hated it all.  I escaped by avoiding my troubles and responsibilities by hanging out with friends and lying about getting work done.  I was seriously shitted...I got straight Fs.  It sucked.  My entire world revolved around avoidance and escape, but I was never really satisfied with how I escaped.  I only felt worse than before.  I was looking for something that no longer existed: the commune, the commoradery, the hanging out, playing card games without fights, frisbee without fights, less resentment, less talking behind peoples backs (if you dont know what I am talking about- ask me and I will remind you), in general a happy atmosphere.  Everything was so stressful sophomore year.
-Now for the one having a hard time this year- feel better, do what you have to do to make yourself happy, but DO NOT try to make me out to be the bad guy.  You were no where when I needed some one.  In fact, you managed to make my life a little bit harder.  And I never said a thing until this year when you tried to villainize me.  I am happy you are trying to find yourself and find your real friends.  That's healthy, good for you. (Note I have said nothing in here to identify who you are- you should know based upon our last conversation)
Back to me...so this semester, I have made it my goal to be academically on track, health wise on track, and mentally on track.  I work at Jhardys 5 nights a week and I do homework on weekends, I do very little socially. But when I do, I want to enjoy myself.  I want to feel like the people I am with want me there.  I don't want to be guilt tripped, I don't want to feel some one is outdoing themselves for me.  I don't want to feel like an outsider.  
-This is the cause of my issues with the other person.  I don't want to be a closet friend.  I either want to be a real fried again or I don't want anything.  this halfway thing we have going is not working for me.  I cannot be the one that you only want to hang out with when you feel like escaping your ""real friends"".  I am not a bad person and I don't want to be made to feel that way, and whther you mean to do that to me or not I am telling you thats how I feel.

Well, this wasn't as prettily written as the first one.  I just cant do it twice.
Feel free to call, IM, come by, etc."

"event","So I have a 'friend' who knows who she is and she feels as if she has put in more than she should towards a friendship with me and my friends.
She also feels that she is sick of us for the level of drama.  This is how she makes her point:
Friday, Blowout- 
we are all drinking happily, she is attempting to speak with someone WHILE they are getting a perppermint patty (syrup in there mouth awaiting the ice101 shot)- the shot giver gruffly informs her that she is being nonsensical in this convo attempt and she storms out and leaves.  moments later a IM appears on his screen with phrases like ""Fuck you all""...since this time she has refused to speak about the scenario and wants to just not communicate with anyone in that room.  In fact, she feels that life is so bad that she sould just go home and not come back.  She cant take being surrounded by all these over dramatic people.  
She also has bouts of feeling like those in her sorority resent her/ hate her/ avoid her/ and talk about her.  She just cannot take it.
Her other deficits include reading screennames improperly, turning refridgerators on, common human curtisy, being on the bus with homeless and black people, and dealing with cars parked too close without keying them.
I can see why she cannot deal with those over dramatic others.  She likes her life simple and emotionaly stable... 

Some people make abnormal psych seem average- now back to studying for it."

"event","So this weekend has been a relative success.  I did not expect it to end well and it did, so I suppose I should be happy about this.
Sadly, today in my procrastination of studying for a looming abnormal psych final, I have way too much time to contemplate what I miss from years beforeand other such things that went wrong.
1)We used to have a condo to go to and chill.  It was a nice condo.  The owner went born again and is often either insulting me or scaring me.  Thanksgiving sucked much due to her (she ruined my potatos) and I am happy to know it will never be held again.  I cried over it, I do that alot.  But I shall hold my own hopefully, put the tables in Jhardys together and seat many!  In either case, we lost both her comapny and home, and it was sad.
2)Jackie was supposed to visit- she didnt.
3)Lauren was suposed to visit- she didnt either due to a test worth 25% of her grade on friday that the teacher only informed them of on Weds. tough...
4) I was supposed to be excited about lauren visiting.  This one is more complicated than I care to type.  As far as I know, we are cool- but when your best friend talks behind ur back, calling u anorexic- only to see months laterthat you do in fact eat and so decides you must be bulemic- thats fucked up.  Forgive and forget I know, but its a fine line.
5)I had a christian origins paper to write (finished 10:30 at night on blowout) and two quizzes on friday. (and two the weds before and a paper due the day be4)
6)hennessey is not as good as I thought it would be, but still acceptable- this was a minor dissapointment comparitively.  
7)I have work today and have no time to think of more- but they exist.
On the upside:
Friday night- I drank at Mazzeo's place- barely ever see him- he is cool, i miss having class with him despite his calling me fat :-p
              Yay Kings!
              New friends are groovy
              Congratulations to brice for geting a new girl- Kristen is tre-cool (how could she not be, she randomly speaks russian and german drunk or  
              sober)
              Do I remember going to bed? not so much, but it wasdone without a mess, and so all is good.
Saturday night-2 games of kings in the afternoon
               meant to study.....whoops
               speak easy was maravelous as usual- i dont know how i ever went without
               liquor n lingerie- my outfit this yr kicked the ass of last yrs.
               I was kissed by (and kissed back a lil) by a random goth bass player with super cool pants - my boyfriend knows- was there- and was cool
               with it as the longer story to this includes a compitition (ask and I will tell you)
               Brendan comfortted a coworker for an hour while my friends and I left- story number two- I didnt knowbrendan wasnt coming, and tried to 
               wait for him, Tristan picked me up to make me leave and fell, I am very scratched up, so I got up- realized I had no brendan to give me a 
               hug and being very drunk and whatnot, began to cry- alot.  In fact, I cried the entire way back to chandler- well one exception.  We went 
              into another party to pick up someone else and I thought we were back at 412, so i stopped crying, looked for brendan, realized e wasnt 
              there, and bawled all over again.  On the plus side I was carried fireman stlye by two diff guys, my butt all in the air with the thong and 
              all that.  Quotes from crying: ""but I love him"" ""no, you just dont understand"" ""I miss him"" and repeat.... I am cute.
              I went to bed and passed out as soon as I got to the commune (brice and brendans room)- Erin, tristan and the likes watched tv
  MEANWHILE: Brendan gets drunk coworkers bf to pick her up- proceeds to look around room for his pants while a freshman (who is in my class and went 
             through rush, and whos initials are S.M.) knelt before him and began fumbling with his boxers. Note that she had already made out with brice-
             silly youngins.
             So brendan came back to his room, brice let him know that I loved him and that was that.  I woke up happy, and here I am.  

In any case, looks like it is time for J hardy's, but for all you 2 or three ppl I know that ever read this, question for you:
What makes a good porn (what is your favorite type) IE: hetero/homo/race/kink factor/bdsm/plot/office/school/real/big-small/etc..."

"event","aww when theres nothing to do mays well turn to good old l.j Its been a while. Its been a while for alot of things actually, wow its crazy how time flies. I guess things always change, as one gets older. Its difficult to know whats the right path sometimes. I mean what I really should say Its difficult to manage time. It doesnt matter which path you choose as long as its the right one for you and you wouldnt have chosen it if it wasnt. Anyhow time *tick tock* time time time. Its a beautiful thing. Although it has its many negative sides. Like a rose with its thorns. I wish I wasnt so busy =( between work and school and christian. It would be nice to just relax like the good old days I guess thats what im refering to as in how things change. Alot has changed when you actually look back on it. Im not gonna lie, I miss it. I miss just being able to wake up whatever time, to do whatever I feel. NO worries. HMPH I guess this is what its like when that time ticks. When life gets older. 

When days fly by.
wow 2008. WOW just think about that.

The Sun rises, another day
There so much to do, so much to say
Get dressed times running out
its quarter to nine, just about
time stops, and i look to the sky
my phone goes off i must fly
one more glance to the perfect sun
The phone rings, I really must run
Walk into the giant doors
and step on the purple and black floors
sounds of crashing and cheering woohoo!
walk into the office, so much to do.
The work just lie there waiting for me
The children run past, they are so free!
Five O' Clock time to go
And here i thought today would be slow
Off to dinner, its almost seven
Home at last, Its almost eleven!
The moon kisses me goodnight
Lying here loosing sight
slipping off into dreamland
as the hour glass loosses her sand.

Eh its not that good im just a little bored
sounds liek a doctor suess ryhme.

Goodnight world
Goodnight Love
Goodnight Friends
Goodnight Heather"

"event","God i miss the good ol days..no worries in the world. Well i graduated 8th grade..I hate it. I want to be young forever. I dont wanna get older..lifes just gets harder and im not ready for it, but i guess you dont really get a chance to prepare for it. Tommorows my birthday. It feels like any other day. why? i remember when i was younger i used to get all excited and everything used to be so speical,*it was my day..when did all that end?* And i remember i wanted to grow up so fast, now i dont want to. 

 well as for graduation..i love them all (well maybe we can leave out 2 or 3 people) but for the rest, i love them soo much i really do. It was alright i expected it to be better, it wasnt really speical. 

 as for the after party at melanies..i wish i never went. I know it sounds bad but its not her fault she was a great host..its just that everything went wrong. I was hoping that zack was gonna be there. He came. 5 minutes before i left. I looked so good, i did my hair makeup outfit everything for him.. he ignored me didnt even say hi. I remember when he walked in he looked amazing i wanted to just run up and give him a kiss. i smiled and opend my mouth to say hi and as i was gonna say hi he walked past me. I felt like just falling on the floor and crying. (people were getting pushed in the pool honestly at the point i just wanted to jump in and just float to the bottom) Love is a killer.

 Look at me 20 mins until my bday, and its susposed to be so fun and im sitting at the comp sobbing over how everything is not the way its susposed to be. You know when you plan somehting and it never works, well thats how everything is for me. This past year has been so emotional. With dreyfoos, graduation, friends and family. whew..

 well i made it this far, no turning back now...
not that i have a chioce*

HAPPY BIRTHDAY HEATHER.
thanks heather, i love you.
i love you too."

So finally we get over to Vinny's grandma's house. we were talking to the grandparents a little bit, then vinny and that other guy came out. We cant remeber his name so we call him ""mr white tee"" ill explain later. So we are all hatian packed in the car and me and christina are sticking together and of course i get middle.. So we finally get to the pool. Nothing speical we just talked. I dont even know why we didnt go in the pool. Well i know wy christina didnt go in the pool lol. Adam got christina a pina coloda. And then we left becouse chrisitna had to get to work. So as we're walking back adams all over christina, and flirting up a storm.

So we drive around for a little bit and almost get into 2 accidents, ( 1. it was raining outside, 2. it was late out and people were acting kinda crazy). Not to mention i was wearing ripped jeans and on the thigh the rip got even bigger and it looked effed up lol. So we're driving around this deserted area. Then adam calls hes lie sorry ill be there in 2 mins. And we're like okay this is gonna be the worst night ever. So we're sitting in the car on the side of the road, and we always scare each other. we're like what if someone came up and opend the car. Then chrisina presses then lock button and all the lights go on and it made a loud sound and we got so scared it was so scary. Adam comes and lets us in. We roll up with vodoo playing. then we get out and we got all the stares. ( vinny white tee and adam were there) We walk in and his dogs were barking like they were gonna have a storke..like it wouldnt stop i wanted to kick the dog in the face. i KNow it sounds bad...but that dog would shut up lol. So we all go outside, christina is wasted. And adam brings out more to drink. Then this guy comes over sean? lol hes so cute and funny. omg! then christina brings out this carton of eggs and is like i want boiled egges..who wants eggs i got eggs vinny you know u want em and she's like going around giving eggs to everyine lol. Christina's makein drinks for everyone shes like mixin orange soda jack daniels and  pink champaine and bulgariun wine, and shes like who wants some.? lol so funny. Then she falls into the table and all the drinks spill..adn vinnys liek whoa whoa whoa  Oh yeah then i go in the kitchen and i was looking in his cabnit and i drop somehting and i bent over ot get it and adams like ohh...nice..or soemhting like that.

And then chrisitna keeped on saying ok its time to go.. and we never went lol. Then she takes out her camara and is like its picture time. So she starts taking all these pics. And adams like yeah take a pic on my lap.. and shes makein me take all the pics (not that i cared) and everyones like i want a picture with heather, and sean comes over and sits next to me and we took the cutest pic.

But THEN christina came by and it was time to go to the hard rock casino and hotel. Its amazeing there. Its like a mini islands of adventure with no rides lol. The hotel is amazeing. theres a casino in the center. And when you first pull in theres a giant guitar i got pics on my phone! we went upstairs to go see christinas grandpa and grandma they're so cute! There was a proce list for everything in the room. It was like $65 bucks for this little (extremly cute) trash can. And omg funniest thing ever in the bathroom the bath tub and toilet are in a seprate room from the sinks. So i was looking in the mirror and christina was useing the bathroom and i notice theres a glass window thats in the wAll to the next room, so i look in and i see christina lol it was so funny. And they're veiw from their room was amazing you could see the whole pool area. The pool was like a giant circle and there was this giant flat screen tv over the pool. We wanted to go in so bad it looked so fun. There were hotubs and a waterslide. We went down there to check it out, and we went over the tv birdge and through this cave. The cave had bathrooms, and the entrance to the water slide. Then we headed over to the shops and club/ resturants. We walked around there for a little bit. It was really fun. There was this one place that was called tatu it was asian food but you could see inside there was fod and it was all black with red lights omg it looked so effin cool. There was this other place Knight time, youhad to be 21 but it looked so cool from what i could see. And then there was this overcrowded pub, that looked really fun, but not as cool as the teguilla ranch you had to be 21 but the bouncer let us look inside. There was a mechanical bull we watched this one girl do it, and she sucked lol we went to go get ice cream at hoffmans we got kalua ice creams oo good and a free fudge sample lol. And then we went in this gilatto place and chrisitna goes heather r u sure you dont want anything, and i was like i didnt want anything int he first place, and she goes cmon heather just get somehting...lol she always puts it on me lol. We went over to hardrock cafe. It was this guys bday and he had to stand on a chair while the whole resturant sang happy birthday to him, and christinas like should we say its my dads bday lol we ate, and christinas like should we order more becouse we only orderd an apitizer and a milkshake and shes like i feel bad, and the lady comes back and shes like did u decide yet and christina goes well they dont want anything so i think we're good lol puts it on me agian lol.. We head back to the car and go home :( and that was the end of hard rock hotel :( for now... :) Omg on the way home at the shell gas station&nbsp; there was like this big gang fight, The cops came and they all got arrested...there was like a car chase...i dotn know its exciteing considering we never see this becouse we live in gayass boca lol</P>

"event","It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen


thats MY song lol...

sitting here eating m&m's listening to it :)
i love the simple things in lfe"

Last night if you saw my away message it said detective and thats just what i was doin lol. I went outide  and got his licence plate #. maybe im just as crazy...but i dont care i had to know if it was true. And knowing my luck and my life it was. He was regestered as a sex offender. Not only that but he apparntly lied about his age too. wow.  my other neibors asked him (thats kinda rude no?) and he started tearing and said that he was falsely accused. I mean he could be telling the truth, becouse he doesnt seem like the guy that would do this...but then agian you never know. In is police pic. hes crying so i dont know...is it from guilt, or is it that he was truly innocent. I have no effin clue.

  Me and christina were going to go to ft. luaderdale beach but then i saw my first real accident. It was so scary we stood on the sidewalk watching and this lady was upside down in the back seat...the driver couldnt move the passenger was bleeding alot and this pretty young girl was like in acoma she wasnt moving :/ it was so scary the people said that the lady that was upside down bleed through the car onto the payvement. It was soo scary it was like i was living a horror movie. :( i felt so bad and this all happend right by a church what does that tell ya?

  I just got off the phone with christina and i learned some interesting things between her and dan. I dont want to get in the middle of it but i guess i already am. we were talking about her and dan i guess she doesnt like him as much as he likes her if you wanna say that. Usally she doesnt break up with anyone they have to be the one to end it, and from what she said i guess she wants dan to end it :/ i dont know...she said sometimes she thinks they dont make a good couple...oh boy...

 Well on that note have a good night :(            :)        lol

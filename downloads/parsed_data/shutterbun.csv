I decided since I have a random blog elsewhere on the net, I'm going to make my journal friends only.
Feel free to comment to be added. teehee! I have to have a place to rant and rave. ;)

Just as a reminder, the random blog is located here:
http://www.myspace.com/shutterbun

Talk to you all soon!"

I hope all you mommies out there have a great day!

This is a photo I took of my sister and her baby boy last year. 
I get to see him again this week. I'm looking forward to seeing how big he is now."

So how many blogs does one girl need? Apparently one more. Sometimes I want to slap all my friends and sing ""Come together right now!"" I am really trying to keep in touch with everyone and it doesn't help that all of you have your blogs in different places. It's all good though. I'm a blabber mouth. I should be able to fill space pretty easily. I may have a weekly drawing on where I will post for the week. I'm spying on you everywhere...it's only right that you spy on me. I can pretty much guarantee I'll stay away from myspace though. That place drives me crazy. I hate it when I click on a page and there is some annoying music going on. Good music is okay...bad music isn't. Some of my posts here may be kept private/for friends because this is the best place for me to come and complain about customers and people in general. It's better if a customer doesn't find all that. heh! To tell the honest truth, Livejournal was the first place I ever blogged. I ended up taking it down though because of some people I wanted to get rid of. I'm so kind.

Anyway, if you want to jump on board, here's the blog I use the most:

Alright peeps...keep in touch and beware of wondering eyes. ;)"

"event","I am not ana. I can't be. I keep having these binges and actually, since I've started writing in LJ I think I've had more trouble with this whole weight issue------perhaps I'm thinking about the whole thing entirely too much!! 
Yesterday was fine... I ran 5.5 miles, biked the same and then walked for like 6 mi's (the walking was unintentional---I got lost, and then couldn't find the car---don't even ask!!) I ate only at dinner and even then, not that much.
Then this morning, I had to go w/Dudu to the courthouse (blah!) so my run was postponed. Now, it's nearly 2:30 in the afternoon and I haven't run. I drank two coffees already and totally chowed on some dried fruit (loaded w/sugar) and nuts. 
If I were really ana----I wouldn't have done that, right? Fuck it.... as long as I can just do my work-outs in the mornings, there's never a problem... but as soon as I encounter a delay or obstacle, the day goes to shit (food).
I don't know if I'll end up running today... yeah, sure I will.... after I hook up the new printer...then I'll go---while Dudu starts to fix dinner (so I won't have to help...Hhehehehehe). 
I'm so spoiled. He's really been handling this whole ""control"" issue superbly. It's like he's a new man!! ...and I am definitely reaping the rewards!! KNOCK ON WOOD!!! Spit, Spit!!!
Our ""buyer"" backed out. ...and my ""connection"" in the company was a fraud. What an asshole! But, this and many other experiences prior have only reinforced my belief that when it comes to issues in business or money--you can ONLY rely on YOU!!! ....and as far as me being nervous in front of any top executives---that will never be the case again!!! Fuck them, all of them----how are they better than me or you, or anyone..... because they graduated from Yale with high honors---give me a break!! Hand me a glass and a half of wine before I enter the room and I can be as cocky and manipulative as the most talented of them!!! ......That's exactly what I've done lately---before an important conference call---I get drunk!!! ....lightens things up a little..... and it makes it so that ""I care, but not thaaaat much"" (in the words of the famous Herb Cohen).
...in fact, that's exactly how I got lost walking yesterday.... I was drunk from after an important call with an executive at the second largest retail pharmacy chain in the US (fucker! :) )---and I went walking in a nearby park with Dudu--to talk about some schtuff---and we got lost--very lost----- we even had to go into a convenience store, once we finally made our way out to the road to check a map as to how we could get back to the parking area where our car could be found. ...from that convenience store it was about 2.75 MORE miles. 
...Not so fun to be lost, but it was great to have a nice walk surrounded by early-Autumn splendor! 

BTW-----Dried fruit is the worst thing to have around, readily accessible, especially when there are also nuts in close proximity---the sweetness of the dried fruit countered by the fatty/salty flavor of the nuts-----it just begs to be eaten---...And eaten 'twas today, by moi!! But I'll make up for it by the modest fare I intend to consume in the evening, and of course my rigorous :) workout in the next hour.
.....Moral on my mind today: (sorry to disappoint---if any of you are disappointed...??) I intend to stop obsessing about every ounce, every morsel of food I ingest. I was doing fine before I started to obsess about it. I'm just going to be cool, stay motivated in every aspect of my life---and it will come naturally, as it did before. Fuck this eating-struggle thing. I'm giving it up. Why should I spend so much time and cause so much pre-mature aging (of the mind and body) by agonizing about my food consumption. Exercise daily, eat in the evening...and if you're hungry some days by the afternoon, grab an apple or something. That's it.
Yalla! Enough.
Bye.... that's over.

"event","I'm having a problem.... I'm over-eating in the evenings. I go all day long, without any problems with hunger... just drinking tea, and water---no problem.... 
then dark hits and Dudu and I prepare dinner and ritually turn on the television. We proceed to finish fixing our meal and then plop ourselves on the couch for at least a couple of hours to watch whatever suits our fancies. If I leave to read or go on the computer, he feels lonely---so I've stopped that-----with the only exception being when we're swamped with work (in this case he pleads that I've been working all day and that I should take a break---how nice of him!).
Anyway, I need to get a handle on this... I hate eating on the couch---it just reminds me of low-lives. If it were up to me, we'd eat at the table like our civilized ancestors and relatives, clean up, and then catch maybe a half hour to an hour of television, or reading (what a novel idea!!) before making bedtime preparations.
Actually, he agreed to try that routine...but insisted that he'd never do it again...at least not until we had guests next. For a while, I sat at the table alone while he sat on the couch...but that didn't work out either.
Enough with my rant. My point is that this is something I must begin to focus my attention on. I can't treat dinner as my once-a-day binge fest. That's just not going to work...and if I don't get this solved now...I'll just continue to torture myself daily.
The thing is that I've gotten into the habit lately to eat way beyond my fill in the evenings...out of boredom?, or maybe to just be in tune with Dudu (who can and often does eat until there's nothing left in the entire house and appear to gain no weight whatsoever...knock on wood)?
I will not be tortured for the rest of my existence by my own selfish vanity. 
I just need to develop a routine for this down-time/the time I spend between trips--at home....and stick to it. What's the problem? Huh girls, what's the problem?...just develop a routine and stick to it. Easier said than done, I know..... but really, it's not. Just stop making excuses!
No more over-eating at night, K!!!
I feel okay overall though....because I ran 5.56 miles today and biked another 5....so perhaps I could afford (yeah right) this evening's mini-binge.
For those of you who have read this entry that do not identify somehow with ed's and other self-absorbed behaviors, I apologize that you've wasted your time. I hope to post something of more value later---perhaps not so self obsessed."

I find that whenever I get close to my goal it goes to my head and then I set myself up for failure. I've still got 11 pounds to go----or at least 6 before I can breathe.
Ran 5.6 miles this morning and biked another 5.5 on the treadmill and stationary bike in the gym. I also did all my exercises: push-ups, abs, arms, legs, etc---but skipped the weight machine routine today (I think it's starting to make me bulk up---better to do more cardio and just cut the weight machine out completely).
I've got so much research to do this weekend----our last potential buyer seems like they might back out so we've got to hurry to get our products seen and ordered before missing Valentine's rush (now!!). I better get going. Bye.

"event","Dudu and I went to Atlanta for the long weekend. We saw broadway's Chicago, visited the Coca-Cola factory and a bunch of other tourist things. I drank a lot. I ate too much.... etc. etc.
All and all it was an okay mini-vaca. I had wanted to visit NYC--but Dudu preferred a warmer climate.
Things are going alright for now between us. He's said that my recent decision to leave, although not something I followed through on was his wake-up call. Okay, I don't believe that I have the power to change anyone... but I feel like he's really trying---and I guess I owe him that chance.... especially considering I've never really (until now) spoken my mind clearly enough about the control/abuse issues---always just tip-toed around it. We'll see. 
Okay... I've gained weight again---but I am sure that this weight gain (which was my form of rebellion and self-hate) directly coincides with my frustrations with Dudu. I have started a paper-journal to keep myself on track.
I will not be able to post as much here as I have in the last week or so---because I told Dudu that I posted very risque photos on a community full of bi-sexuals, etc----this was meant to be a turn-on for him---which it was.... until after his ejaculation.
As for my attraction to girls.... that's a work in progress... I have communicated to Dudu that if we are going to continue from here, I need to feel free to do what I want.... he has agreed to help in any way he can.
I will go to school after we move to Houston----probably will start in January. 
This very-important-buyer has not contacted us... time is running low... I hope we don't lose it----------But I have many other ideas brewing... Everything will be ok.
I bought some garden burgers (w/o cheese inside) from the frozen food section today... 100 calories each. They are terrific---I love the taste..... I ate one this afternoon, just that by itself. 
I have been thinking about how I was always 110 before---how I was eating then, exercising, my mood, etc. I felt much better about myself...I kept to my routine... woke up early and went to sleep at a reasonable hour. I drank one coffee in the am... had an apple or small snack in the afternoon and ate a small salad w/an entree in the evening. The key is the snack in the afternoon---w/o that I have a tendency to over-eat in the evening.... So, it is back to this routine that I will go!
The journal will help keep me on track. 
I can't communicate how satisfying it is to wake up around dawn, exercise, shower and start the day. I love to wake up early. When I'm consistantly waking up late (which is what I was doing for a while now--to kill this down time as much as possible) I start to feel depressed.
I get very bored easily. I need to stay busy to stay motivated. 
This f-ing buyer----- but as soon as they call it's going to be a hurricane for about 1.5 mo's or so.
I think that in the days until this deal I will continue to study my Hebrew reader and DANTES business exam guide, and maintain this new journal.... and the day-to-day stuff---bills, etc.
So, let's see what I have to report tomorrow------will I actually study????? I have been so bad this last week!!!

Lose weight,
stay motivated,
dedicated,
optimistic,
idealistic,
perfectionistic................. I was trying to be cute. 

Dudu read my horoscope from walla.co.il. It said that I'm an ""international traveler and/or a 'professional' student""....sounds about right.... that'd be an 'and' rather than an 'or' I HOPE----I MUST GO TO SCHOOL!!!!!
I'm going to be visiting Russia for the first time during the manufacturing-intermission in China. I believe that I will really enjoy myself there---and I'm SURE that Dudu will.... Russians are the Queens of beautiful girls (and many prostitutes)."

"event","The last couple of days I haven't been doing as well as I would like. I've just had one coffee and h20 throughout the day...and then when evening hits... and I've got to help fix dinner and Dudu and I must sit together--he starts watching me, asking me questions... I hate to come back from the pot. His eyes immediately go to my plate---usually accompanied by some comment.
Last night, after Dudu called me a prostitute (??!!***) and left the house I spoke with my grandmother (the only person I could ever turn to for help in the family) to ask if I could spend a few days with her. I checked for plane tickets and I was ready to purchase roundtrip tickets up north for 1 week. 
This was the first time that I have ever talked to someone else about our problems. 
Our relationship is not healthy... you know, I've done a lot of reading on the subject--abusive relationships, possessive spouses/bf's.
Dudu exhibits so many of these warning sign behaviors and last night was no exception. He made me feel too guilty to leave. I knew that that might happen. 
It's not the best time to go right now anyway, I'm waiting for a very important buyer to call. After that call, our lives will explode for the following two+ weeks. Rushing and running to meet their deadline.
I still have everything in the forefront of my mind. I still believe that at 22 I am too young to commit myself for life.
.....I told him that I would wait until this evening to decide if I were leaving for a few days. We shall see.... ?????"

"event","Okay... I'm going to try to be completely honest with myself and examine what's bothering me right now. 
I am with Dudu. He loves me and I know that he'll never leave me. The question is whether or not I am happy with him. He is my best friend. He is an awesome business partner. He's a great cook, fun, adventurous, willing to follow me on new journeys, listens to my advice (usually). The downsides: he's controlling, he's easily angered, he has no tolerance for mistakes, he is very anxious, and I *think* that he doesn't like me having too much independence. 
I did the online course thing--hated it...but he liked that---studying at home---always around. Have applied to go to day school---unable to because of business ventures. He seems not to like me having any private time with friends---in fact, at this point I really don't have any friends. He buts into my relationships with anyone---to kind of keep tabs on it. 
He is manipulative... I know that he says things just because he thinks I want to hear them. 
I have not been sexually attracted to him for the last few weeks. 
He's beginning to feel like I don't love him. 
I want to go to school. I like being my own boss. I need Dudu to help me run the business if I'm going to attend school...but lately, it's our imports that have really been picking up--and that seems to be where we want to focus our attention right now----which rules out traditional college classes because there's just too much travel--and for such extended periods. He can handle our shoe franchise in Israel--we've hired a professional buyer to help with the styles--so I won't need to go on those trips....but in the U.S. I carry most of the responsibility---I don't know how he'll be able to do it without me. 
What have I got myself into? 
I need to go to school.... I'm not the side with the business genius---although I have learned a lot lately and can keep up my part--that's primarily Dudu's area of expertise. I want to study... for self enrichment, for a sense of accomplishment, for knowledge, and yeah.... to have something to fall back on if things go bust between Dudu and I or just the business in general.
I just don't see it getting any easier... I love all this travel... I love being in this business of importing. I am not willing to go to school part-time. I am not willing to take any more online courses. 
If only I could have it all.....?
You want to know the funniest part?.... (we're selling the local businesses so those no longer count as part of my work) I'm home waiting for inventory to run low for sometimes months at a time..... we've always started other projects during this down time, but with all that free time...you'd think there'd be a solution to this rather simple problem. I haven't found it.

I've suggested that we relocate to an area around Houston (maybe bet. Houston and Austin) and now it has become Dudu's fixation. We're planning to move as soon as this next order is finished (about 2 mo's). Neither of us like the cold. But I'm not sure if Houston is really where I want to be.... maybe Atlanta???? I just dunno.

...Our beginnings are VERY modest. Dudu and I started our first business together as tractor-trailer drivers for a moving company.... yeah, that's right---I drove one of those big rigs all over the US and unloaded furniture like any of the other guys (they were always guys--the movers---and they always stared at me as I moved the boxes, etc.---so I told Dudu that I didn't want help ever---we'd do everything solo---fuckers!! I hated them staring at me like I was some kind of side-show). 
My point that I somehow lost sight of in all that rambling--is that I've seen the whole continental United States---every state... nearly every city (that's worth visiting). 
I remember Texas for its delicious peaches and nice weather.
I also liked San Diego---for the weather---but prefer not to live so close to LA.
New York is f-ing amazing----but I shy from the cold.... etc.
If I weren't with Dudu, I'd go to NYC. I'd suffer the cold to be in the Big Apple and enjoy the splendor--the shows, the fashion, the hustle and bustle, the culture.
I'm rambling soooo much.... 
I'm bored..... I want to go to the gym---but I've been put on assignment to monitor the phones until our buyer calls (which probably won't be until tomorrow)------so it'll have to wait until the evening.

Last night Dudu started giving me a hard time about my eating again.... saying, ""Are  you trying to lose weight? What did you eat today? How do you expect to survive? You're running and exercising. I'm not letting you run tomorrow. You'll see.""
....so maybe that's what he's got in his head----that he'll just postpone my trip to the gym until I've lost the motivation---ha!! I'll prove him... But honestly, I can see it now---I go to the gym for the hour and then I come home to do another hour (more like 45 min) of my exercises--and he'll be watching me the whole time---bugging me, ""You're not finished yet?""
It'd be nice to have a bigger apt. We're planning to buy a house once we relocate--to who-know-where...probably Houston area (property value is insanely low there---so that's one plus). I dream of having the basement---or some section to myself--a nice gym---with huge windows, sliding glass doors---a nice view of a huge lawn.... and privacy....ahhhh.

I used to run outside... all the time... I love to run outdoors... but I've got this problem in my foot---supposed to have surgery---anyway, I find the low impact of the treadmill rather than pounding on pavement helps to keep the pain down. When I go to Israel I run outside--through the fields (on dirt)----that's the greatest!!! 

I really hope that no one has suffered through the entirety of today's psycho-babble. I'm a rambling queen. So, if not with Live Journal... how else can I kill the time.... 

I really don't like living in Raleigh anymore. I used to go for walks. I just don't like being around the people here---I don't think myself a snob... maybe I am... no, just anti-social---due to insecurities... really, I'm fucking weird... I mean someone talks to me when I'm buying groceries, or I feel someone looking at me in public and I start walking funny or twisting my face... I've found the best way is to just completely avoid eye contact with anyone while you're in the store-----except for employees when you need some assistance. The strange thing is that the less you look at others, the more intrigued they are by you----when I avoid meeting eyes with anyone I feel every one of their eyes on me.... but it doesn't bother me as long as I don't make out their facial features or meet their eyes. 
Call me crazy... I know that's true... call me long-winded---I've certainly proved that here. Just don't call me late for dinner!---what a stupid line.... who even says that.... I think Robert DeNiro's character in ""This Boy's Life"" (one of Leo DiCaprio's first convincing roles) said that. 
Btw, that's a really great movie-----I definitely recommend it. ....and it's autobiographical (the screenplay came from a book)."

"event","Okay, I have a confession to make. Last night I made dinner... vegetables roasted in the oven and salad. Dudu is back, so I have to eat one meal a day. 
I ate dinner and I was content...didn't eat a lot and managed to avoid Dudu's scrutiny.
Then he left to close up the local businesses. I was feeling mischieveous. I just wanted to do something naughty. So I went to the freezer where he's stored his mother's chocolate croissants, pulled two out. Then I took the Nutella from the pantry and proceeded to dip the ultra-super-fatty croissants into the Nutella and devoured them. I didn't even take time to enjoy the taste. I just shoved them in my mouth because I knew what I was doing was wrong so I wanted to finish before my inner-food police threatened to prosecute.
....an added note....there's something about homemade sweets, maybe the fact that someone went to the trouble to make them especially for you--that makes those BAD foods harder to resist.
Anyway, I wasn't about to leave that garbage inside me. I purged. I purged until there was absolutely NOTHING left inside except some ulcer-causing digestive juices--and even some of that I forced out.
It was utterly DISGUSTING. I hate resorting to that.... and I was doing so well... it had been weeks since the last time I had to go to those extremes. 
....I just wanted everyone to know, including myself that I am far from being perfect on my quest for perfection.
..I'm back on track today and taking it all in stride.
Also, I posted some rather revealing photos of myself. I'm telling myself that anonymous nudity is ok...but I dunno if I actually agree with that....---I just couldn't get a photo with my clothes on---you couldn't tell where my body ended and the clothes began or vice versa. These were taken right after my trip to the gym-which explains the marks on my body from the elastic bands in the sports bra and pants. I would call myself voluptuous here.(I took them down--not sitting well in my head) Not what I'm striving for, but for my own psyche--at least I'm a little bit toned.
About 10 pounds less and I think I'll be happy. Here's to 100!"

I don't know what I feel. I feel like I want us to start from the beginning... you know, a little romance, a little respect, fewer expectations.
He promised me that when he returned home he wouldn't be smoking (he just started about a month prior to his trip). He's smoking.
He's nagging me about the business proposal because we're running out of time to make the Valentine's cut-off. I know we're running out of time---but it's not up to me anymore... I sent the proposal..now it's up to the buyer---they're aware of the length of our production and delivery times. What can I do about it---stop nagging me... stop making me nervous.
All this morning he was mumbling and making faces...so I asked, ""Dudu what's wrong? Is something bothering you?....Did I do something wrong?"" his reply, ""No. No my love, you're perfect.""----he said that as sincerely as he could, but I know that it wasn't true. ...so what's bothering him---me.
He's been telling me how great it was seeing his family, how great his sister is, etc. Okay, that's fine. But then he says, ""I don't like being here. I don't like being home with you.""
I feel like I don't like him here either.
So, what's going on??? 
Now, he's sitting near me--so that's my cue to face him and talk. 
I also can't go to the gym while we're fighting---that's completely taboo....to do anything on my own or go anywhere while we're in a fight----although he can---he can take the car for a ride.

"event","I'm back to 110 (my ""normal"" weight). ....don't know how much more I can lose because: Dudu came home last night 10:30pm. I knew that his return would break my fast. This morning I feel very bad about that. I mean I was really enjoying it---and I didn't even feel hungry--although it was only two days long... and my mood was very good. 
Anyway, he called me from his layover in Canada...said, ""Wow, I'm so horny. Please wear something nice when you come to the airport--something tight."" 
From about 6:00-9:00 I was cooking. I cooked tomato and eggplant soup, black bean pattie-thingees (in the oven), and he likes rice so I fixed some curry/lime/cashew/mint rice...oh, and basil/cucumber and tomato salad. Dudu loves good food and I knew that if I wanted to do something nice---that would be the first and most appreciated thing I could do (not to mention expected).
Well, he loved all the food---said the soup was, ""the best soup he's ever tasted."" ----that's a first...Me, fixing ANYTHING relating to food the best...???!!!!! (you see, I am NOT a cook by nature--although I can always follow the directions of a recipe book to the T. ----which is exactly what I did last night).

He threw my pants on the ground--which I then picked up and placed on the bookshelf (they're new-and I don't want wrinkles or lint)---------anyway, one can see by my pant worries that I wasn't entirely into the whole sex bit at that moment. Okay... so we had sex... it was never-ending. I was so uncomfortable. I just couldn't get myself there. He finished about 3xs--and it was so wet that I really didn't like it. 
I don't know what that is supposed to signify...but it is really unlike me. I am someone who is usually very easily aroused. 
...And this morning, I woke up and said, ""do you mind if I go to the gym now?"" and although he said, ""no, I'll go later,"" I saw his face and the fact that he said he'll go later----everything pointed to, just wait. So, here I am---drinking my coffee and updating my live journal. 
...I wish I could have gone 3 more days fasting. I've been thinking about when I'll have another chance. ....can't think of it---we're 24/7 together. I guess it's back to 1 coffee until the evening and then small dinner."

"event","I don't think I'm looking forward to my bf's return. He's just so ahh, masculin. What makes it even worse is that he's Israeli--where machismo is f-ing rampid and grossly widespread about the male population. I think it's because many Israelis have roots from Arab cultures: Morrocco, Iraq, Yemin, Tunisia, Eithiopia, etc. And the Arabs---fohgettaboutit--they're SUPER controlling (with the exception of most Turkish--who are more Westernized and exhibit reason). I dated one a-hole from Lebanon when I was young, stupid and desperate for attention. He was CREEPY controlling. That actually started out as a joke--I was pretending to be Russian when I met him at a club/bar smoking nargilla. I kept that up for some time...didn't even give in when his Russian-speaking friend tested my actual knowledge of the language (which is NONE). heheehe
That blurb seemed way off topic, but some of it is actually important to note because it gives me understanding/insight about Dudu's aggressiveness.  
He says I have pride issues. Well, what do you expect when I'm always hearing, ""You don't get it,"" ""You don't understand,"" ""Let me explain something to you,"" ""Let me tell you what we're going to do..."" -when he's talking about something that we deal with on a daily basis. I mean come on, give a girl some credit. But to be perfectly honest, lately I've been demanding of more than just credit--I want attention, admiration, adoration, etc., and yes--that forbidden CONTROL! 
I don't want to be anyone's puppy. Sometimes I think about leaving him, moving to NYC or some other delightful and stimulating metropolis other than Boston (lived there for many years already) and making it on my own. For right now though, our relationship works. We are the closest of friends, with just about the same goals and aspirations. The main difference though is his 8 year head start on life and his desire to have many children (aaaaahhhhhh!!!), and marriage soon (double aaahhhh aaaahh!!)
I have decided to start my fast tomorrow, but unfortunately it won't be able to last the whole 5 days because Dudu is coming back on Saturday---fuck!! that leaves just tomorrow and 1/2 of Saturday---that's not even worth it. You know, I hadn't realized that it was so tight. That f-ing company that I ordered from (you've got to order via internet, because none of the stores carry it)---I paid about $30 for the entire 5 day fasting kit (it's got all-natural crap to support your body's cleansing: fiber, liver cleansing, colon cleansing pills, etc) and then I paid about $18 on top of that for overnight delivery---I ordered it on Sunday am. Today is Thursday--I just received it this afternoon----mo-fuckers!! I'm DEFINATELY getting a refund on that $18 ""overnight"" charge. 
It's 20 minutes to 12am. I don't feel like going to sleep. 
I've made the final preperations to submit my proposal tomorrow. I had initially planned to send it this morning, but I had to wait on one contractor to finish the POS display. So, it'll be off and on it's way (fingers crossed) to a green light tomorrow. I really really hope that it goes through. I've been waiting for this a long time and it could put my company on a much larger map. This deal could put our foot in the door to sooo sooo much more. I'll keep you posted--don't want to jinx anything.
I ate a bit more than I had planned tonight. Not too much, just a few bites. I had a few bites of tomato paste--I know, you must be thinking, ""gross!,"" but I don't like to cook and I simply REFUSE to eat overly processed foods(no baked goods: no breads, no cookies, no potato chips, no Oodles of Noodles, canned soups, or ick--microwavable anything, SHIT!)--so I am presented with this dillemma every time the bf, aka Chef Boyordudu is not around (which isn't often). 
So, let me tell you what I ate today: my morning coffee, then at 10:15pm I ate my air-popped popcorn (sm serving), 1/3 buttnernut squash in the oven, and that fucking tomato paste. 
You must be thinking, ""this chick is crazy""---she won't eat over-the-counter convenience foods, but she'll eat tomato paste with popcorn?
Enough about food. I ate a little more than I should have, especially because I didn't work out today. I did plan to--but what I thought was my one last quick errand before my workout, turned into about 6 ""last"" errands and I didn't get home until dark, so I just left it at that. Anyway, I weighed in today at 111--so I'm on my way. --I need to post something on the message board before I forget so lataH!"

Right now, I'm making a really fine go at the procrastinating game----if someone is reading this they'll notice the date/time and content of my last entry---and I'll be found out. Oh no!!!

I should be practicing my Hebrew right now, or even more fulfilling would be if I would complete my workout right now.

"event","These assholes----wow... you think that you're paying them enough. I've been waiting all morning for this one contractor to finish her job. The point is that when I agreed to use her--she said that she'd agree to have it finished by either yesterday afternoon, or if I wanted to make any changes (which of course I did)--at the latest before noon today. Now it's 2:21pm.... 
I didn't have a chance to exercise this morning and now I feel like I've lost my momentum. I had planned on noon---I said to myself, ""okay, you'll drink your coffee around 7am, do some paperwork and make your phone calls until 11:30am and then you'll head over to the woman-under-scrutiny's office, pay her, pick up the project and then do your exercise routine. 
Well, wouldn't you know it didn't happen like that. .....you see, what I've found about leading yourself and having a lot of ""free time"" in between projects is that you NEED to give yourself structure. For me, it's a must---I've seen what happens when I don't go by a schedule---last time I gained 10lbs in 2 months. 
So.... I don't necessarily appreciate when someone screws that up.      
But then again, I've been telling myself, ""at least she'll have it done before Friday---so that I can send it to the buyer before the close of the week""..... and when I think about it----the real reason (I mean truly---although this is not so easy to admit--because I'd rather be more concerned about the business) that I'm peeved is because I didn't exercise and now I'm feeling lazy/sluggish and afraid that I'll skip it today. 
AM/or early afternoon is the best time to get sweaty.... so what am I going to do now.... maybe I should kick myself off this chair and go.... I'm sitting here in my workout clothes ready to go.
...I'll go in a minute OKAY!!

"event","You want to hear something kind of sick.... When I was in second grade my mother used to dress me up in these skirts with white tights--so damn cute. I remember sitting with my friends and telling them that my legs looked so fat because I put cotton balls all around them inside the tights. 
.....so since I was seven, I was super afraid of becoming/being fat. 
...Even now, my legs are one of my ""problem areas""---ankles like Grandma Bertha----seems like all I can do to hide them is build muscle in my calves. Ah, to have the legs of Gisele....... 
Here's something unbelievable, but I swear it's true. ...Usually I weigh myself at night-I'm heavier at night and it's great to beat myself up a little before I go to bed. So last night I weighed in at 118 (yuck!!!) and this morning I was between 112 and 113------------I kid you not. Don't ask me how, cause I have NO idea. Once I get back to 110 I can take a half breath and then after 100 I'll breath a little bit deeper and more relaxed. 

....was up all night last night, but spirits are very high. I'm motivated. My business plans are falling into place. I'm generally keeping busy--- even just doing nonsense; busy-""work"". I read messages and comments on this site about 3 times per day. .....a lot of phone calls overseas (different time zones by 7-13 hours) makes my insomnia seem totally self-controlled. :)"

"event","Wow... how selfish am I?? ...the answer is very (not proud of that, but it's true)
......but really... I haven't even introduced myself or anything.....
I'm 22 years old. I live on the east coast. My boyfriend and I own and operate three companies: 2 in US and one abroad. 
My life has been a strange one.... I went to drug rehab when I was 16, then I went to a terrific all-girls boarding school--only to get myself kicked out, wasting $30,000. I then got my GED. Then I joined the army (where I first began to have weight problems)guard as a deisel truck mechanic of all things (what a HUGE lapse of consciousness). After having realized what a faux pas I made---being surrounded by fat old men who drink beer religiously, I left the army. 
I have done some college through the internet (btw--not the best way to go: no interaction is not stimulating). My boyfriend and I work very hard at building our businesses and I haven't been able to work more school into the scenario yet, although I REALLY want to continue my studies!! I'm not sure if my boyfriend and I have the healthiest relationship----in fact, I think he exerts too much control over me--and I let him, although lately it has changed a bit with my becoming a control freak. ......So, school is something very important--especially when things (might) fall apart between him and I. In all honesty---he's the one with the brilliant business head---I'm just along for the very pleasant ride, but I've started to make my own deals lately--and done reasonably well.
I hope that you'll forgive that I have rambled my life into your innocent, unsuspecting minds. ...and yet, I continue...

I have just one friend that I adore and love dearly---but she lives 1,000 miles away. 
I suppose I'm a bit old to have this kind of a struggle with my weight.... but it keeps me busy---always thinking about it. You see, I go for long periods of time waiting---waiting for replies on business proposals... waiting for our inventory to run low, so that I need to import more. ..... During this time my weight it is my hobby---it is my obsession----> oh, that's misleading; it is ALWAYS my obsession. ....Isn't that normal though?? ....Don't all girls obsess over their weight?? 
Yesterday, I saw a girl in Nordstrom's and she was so thin---perfectly thin---...I wanted to ask her, what's your secret? 
...the thing that's so strange is that I know my weight is ok. I mean I'm average: 5'7"" 120 lbs--my measurements are ""normal"" and I am pretty much toned all around. 
All this I know, but I still want to wear clothes that hide my body.... I hate that I sometimes feel my clothes tight around my butt, hips, thighs and waist. I still want to lose---- I want to be 100-105 lbs. That's it.... 100 --the perfect number."

"event","For the entirety of last year, I weighed 110 lbs. I was always trying to lose, but managed to remain mostly content with that weight. I ran and exercised every morning for an hour. 
I have to travel for very long stints----usually over a month each trip---to Asia and the Middle East. When I'm there, I maintain something close to my usual exercise routine---with the exception of missing one day here and there. My last trip to Asia, I lost about 6 lbs., so I weighed 104--->for about three days---only to quickly gain it back while staying at my boyfriend's house on the way back home--I could not control myself---late night trips to the fridge to devour his mother's cake while everyone was asleep.
By the time I finally got home--I was back to 110 or 112. Then my boyfriend took one trip without me---two months I was home alone. Now, me being home alone is REALLY alone---because of my work I don't have ANY friends here--no one, no family, nothing. Two months---I started to feel depressed and tried to sleep most of my day away---my exercise routine went out the window, I started smoking and my weight skyrocketed to 120---which is where I remain today.
I have started to exercise again, quit smoking---but I can't seem to drop below 119, or if I really try 115. 
Now my boyfriend is away for 1 week---I'm alone again---but this time for a short time and with a mission in mind: to get my weight under 110. 
For the most part, my boyfriend and I eat once a day--dinner. That makes it easier for me to maintain one weight.
I purchased a five day fasting kit from Nature's Secret. I'm going to stick with it---if it arrives in the mail today I still have five days before my boyfriend returns and starts to haggle me about my ""eating problem"". I hope that I will be able to continue exercising through these five days.  ???"

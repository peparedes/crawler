"event","so i realized today that i really don't like most of the people in school. and i fully realized how glad i am that it's over. yeah, i'll miss the daily m-f routine and looking forward to seeing ricky in between classes and stuff, but...there are so many people who's attitudes i'm sick and tired of and who have talked about me behind my back and thought i didnt know all year, that i am so glad to never see again after graduation day. yeah, i can be a bitch but i dont talk about someone until they give me a problem. but anyway, my baby just left. i love him so much. well, im gonna go. i gotta clean and stuff before mom gets home.
later yall"

"event","i really hope he comes over tonight. i want so badly to work things out with him. i don't know what i'll do if i lose him. but at least i know he loves me and is willing to try working things out with me.

elena-thank you so much for being there for me today, even if we don't talk much...just seeing you being goofy and telling me you loved me and understood what i was going through kept me from breaking down. so thank you so much.

My first attempt at creative writing&nbsp;(not for school) may have been a 8 page (or so) children's book I wrote (with crayons and construction paper, of course) when I was about six or seven.&nbsp; I don't remember what it was about, but I remember my impetus to write it:&nbsp; In the Sunday funnies, there was a cartoon that had a note suggesting that you could cut it out and use it as a bookmark.&nbsp; I didn't know what a bookmark was, and when I asked my mom, I misunderstood what she meant, and thought it was something that you <em>glued</em> into the book (for reasons unknown).&nbsp; Not wanting to ruin any of my books, I decided to just write one myself, just so I could ""use my new bookmark.""&nbsp; There's something about this whole story that sums up my creative direction, I think.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Okay, I tag:&nbsp;<br /></strong><br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://potch1214.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://potch1214.livejournal.com/""><b>potch1214</b></a></div>&nbsp;<br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://sacredspud.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://sacredspud.livejournal.com/""><b>sacredspud</b></a></div><br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://the-mighty-lady.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://the-mighty-lady.livejournal.com/""><b>the_mighty_lady</b></a></div><br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://not-eurotic.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://not-eurotic.livejournal.com/""><b>not_eurotic</b></a></div>&nbsp;<br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://mrsveteran.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://mrsveteran.livejournal.com/""><b>mrsveteran</b></a></div>&nbsp;<br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://jupiters-moons.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://jupiters-moons.livejournal.com/""><b>jupiters_moons</b></a></div>&nbsp;<br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://m0rrigan.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://m0rrigan.livejournal.com/""><b>m0rrigan</b></a></div>"

"event","<p>Emily Mills taged me--these are her questions:</p><div><strong>1) Can you trace your obsession with dark humor, guns and violence back to any one experience or childhood trauma/joy? I'm curious as to the origins of your thematic bent in writing. <br /><br /></strong>Good question--if there's anything that's affected the overall writing--or at least, the dark, violent stuff, it's that from 5th grade through my sophmore year of high school, I was grossly unpopular and bullied pretty mercilously. Not physically, but the teasing throughout middle school was really viscious and persistant to the extent that (and I've only realized this relatively recently) almost all of my work contains some form of bully somewhere in it. <br /><br />That said, I also think it may come from the fact that other than that, my childhood was a happy one, and I've always liked my family. I think that sometimes when you haven't been around a lot of trauma, it's easier to view it in a satirical way. As I've gotten older, and experienced more, the work has gotten more and more serious--and that may be because I take pain more seriously now. <br /><br /><strong>2) Who's your favorite historical figure and why? <br /><br /></strong>It seems kind of a cop-out just to say Martin Luther King, like everyone else does, but I guess I'd say him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />However, if we opened the floor to historical figures that were still alive, I'd go with the little-know performance artist <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://joeyskaggs.com/"">Joey Skaggs</a>. From the late 60's to earlier this decade, Skaggs and his crew have performed hoaxes with one singular purpose:&nbsp; To prove that the media isn't doing its job.&nbsp; From setting up phony dog prostitution rings, to diet pills supposedly made from cockroaches, part of the scam was leaving clues in each hoax--ones right out in the front.&nbsp; Clues that if any reporter did the most basic of fact-checking, they be found out.<br /><br />He stopped this decade, mainly when the media stopped playing fair.&nbsp; Part of Skaggs' method is that the reveal of the gag is the most important thing--it's the main message.&nbsp; Well, when Skaggs released that one of his pranks was a gag, one publication started reporting that they'd ""found him out,"" and that ""someone finally outwitted the great Joey Skaggs.""&nbsp; Plus, post 9/11, he said that the government has has less of a sense of humor about the whole thing.&nbsp; Which is a shame, because now, more than ever, we need a Joey Skaggs.<br /><br /><strong>3) If you ever found yourself in a bar with a lady who had a bomb strapped to her chest, a lady you'd had a less-than secret love for, what would you do?&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>Heh.&nbsp; Whyever do you ask?&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />If I knew how to disarm a bomb, I would--but I think the larger question is would I be willing to die with a woman who I loved--who didn't feel the same way?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't know.&nbsp; I think I'd stay.&nbsp; I'd like to think I'd stick it out, even if the love was one-sided.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>4) Name your dream cast for any one of your shows (can be famous people or locals or any mix thereof, doesn't matter). Explain yourself. And don't feel at all bad if it doesn't involve me. :)&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>Oh, jeez.&nbsp; Since it's coming up, I'll dream cast <a href=""http://frigidfest.com/shows/OrangeMurderSuit.html"">Orange Murder Suit.</a><br /><br />As Lynn, the lawyer, I'll say <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0341737/"">Rachel Griffiths.</a>&nbsp; Perhaps because people are always bringing up that Molly Vanderlin, who played her originally, kind of resembles her, but also because she can play someone you <em>do not want to fuck with</em>.<br /><br />As Nina, the mother, I'll say...<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000211/"">Mimi Rogers.</a>&nbsp; My crush on Mimi Rogers is the stuff of legend.<br /><br />For Joy, the drug addict, I'll say...um...ooh!&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0735442/"">Michelle Rodriguez!</a>&nbsp; She has a toughness you just can't fake.&nbsp; It's easy to imagine her being brutal.<br /><br />And for the full version of it, for Julie, the daughter, I'd go with...<font size=""2""><a href=""http://www.katdennings.com/"">Kat Dennings</a>.&nbsp; Granted, I've only seen her in ""The 40-year-old Virgin,"" but she has a quality that might work for the role--Julie is pretty much the only ""normal"" character in it, and as such, you'd need someone who might not play it too ""nice.""<br /><br /><br /></font><br /><br /><br /><strong>5) If you met <span id=""lw_1172430039_0"">Christopher Walken</span> and, like the wise man on the mountain, you could only ask him three questions, what would they be?<br /><br /></strong>Oh, jeez...I'd probably ask him one thing:&nbsp; ""How's Lance doing?""<br /><br />Christopher Walken actually has a brownstone in NYC, right under my dad's friend Lance, and they've been neighbors for years (Lance's wife&nbsp;was housesitting for him the night that he won the Oscar for The Deer Hunter).<br /><br />In fact, my dad and I went to visit Lance about ten years ago, when I confirmed that, yes, he did really live there (the nameplate said ""Walken"").&nbsp; While there, I did my impression--which cracked up Lance--and it suddenly occured to me that there was the tiniest of chances that the <em>real</em> Christopher Walken could have heard it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Didn't happen, but it would have been funny.<br /><br />Okay!</div><br /><div>Now: Your mission, should you choose to accept it: <br /><br />1. Leave me a comment saying, ""I too am an egomaniac."" <br />2. I respond by asking you five question. You will answer them, because you like talking about yourself. <br />3. You will update your LJ with the answers to the questions. <br />4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the post. <br />5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>[Apparently, it's the LJ tags that are screwing up this entry, so I just removed them.]</strong><br /></div><div id=""highlighterDiv"" style=""DISPLAY: none; Z-INDEX: -1; POSITION: absolute; BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow""></div>"

Let it be said that The Blitz Smackdown was so awesome that I honestly think that <i>every</i> Blitz should be like this.  And I know I'm not alone. 

Thanks to producers Bonnie Balke and Kirk Stantis for putting it together, Rachel Jenkins for doing a great job directing mine, and a wonderful cast for providing some of the best stage combat EVER.  (Kelly Lee Kriesel in the doorway is my favorite moment of the night.)

More on this later--I'm anxious to get this up."

"event","<P>So last night I had one of those all-at-once ideas for a play about a conversation on a phone sex line, when it occured to me that I honestly don't know the first fracking thing about how Phone Sex Operators work. </P>
<P><A href=""http://p218.ezboard.com/bphonesex"">This site</A> has been a ton of help--and kind of a fascinating read, too.&nbsp; My favorite exchange:</P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff><SPAN class=title><STRONG>Tamer:&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff><SPAN class=title>I feel that I failed when they hang up without a goodbye!</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Is this normal to just hang up when they are done without a goodbye or anything. I have talked for 25 minutes, can tell by the breathing that they are done and then they are gone. No thanks, see ya, good bye, etc... Should I feel like I failed or is this normal? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000><SPAN class=title><STRONG>angelashingler</STRONG></SPAN>:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>If I tell you that I work </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>in despatch and I've been logged on for the last 3 hours, I've takne 20 calls and I think ONE of the guys said ""That was great, Babe. Thanks a lot"". </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>It's understandable - after all, how many of us say 'thanks' to the girl at the supermarket checkout?</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33cc00>jenniferfowler:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>Maybe it's just me, but I always preferred that they just hang up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><IMG alt=;) src=""http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif""><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> </FONT></P>
<P>This is a helpful site, but it occurred to me that I might know someone who--or someone who knows someone who has been a PSO at some point so I could ask a few basic questions and bounce the script off them to check it for accuracy.</P>
<P>The big questions:</P>
<P>How does a customer cross the line (regarding asking about the PSO's personal life)?&nbsp; Is it against policy to discuss any of the realities of the service (how it's run, etc.)?</P>
<P>Does anyone know anyone who can be my expert witness?</P>"

<P>Name the movie each of these quotes came from. </P>
<P>I'll screen the comments for now so that everyone can guess without seeing each other's guesses.</P>
<P>1.&nbsp; ""Well, some white ASSHOLE took the last piece-of-shit sky-blue Cadillac on the lot.""</P>
<P>2.&nbsp; ""See that?&nbsp; Boom.&nbsp;Still alive.&nbsp; Now we question him.&nbsp; Y'know why?&nbsp; 'Cause I got him in the leg.&nbsp; I didn't pump him full of bullets and jump off a building with him.""&nbsp; ""Hey, that's no fair, the building guy lived.""</P>
<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;""I shot that fucker three times.&nbsp; He was takin' a shit.&nbsp; He went for his pistol an' I blazed away...""</P>
<P>4.&nbsp; ""What do you need a gun for?&nbsp; For ze Germanz?""</P>
<P>5.&nbsp; ""There's&nbsp;ALWAYS some stupid bullshit&nbsp;reason to kill your girlfriend.""</P>
<P>6.&nbsp; ""I said NO camels!&nbsp; That's THREE!&nbsp; CAN'T YOU COUNT?!?!?""</P>
<P>7.&nbsp; ""If you... don't keep the baby, if that's what you decide, then, never tell him you were pregnant.&nbsp; I mean that.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; The relationship will whither and die. But, if you do decide to have the baby,&nbsp;then, at that very moment, when you're absolutely sure, tell David.&nbsp; Tell him at&nbsp;that exact second, and then you spoil that kid every chance you get.""</P>
<P>8.&nbsp; ""He gave me a picture&nbsp;of you once.&nbsp; I never knew why.&nbsp; It was very old. Torn. Faded.&nbsp; You were young, like you are now.&nbsp; You weren't smiling...just a little sad...&nbsp; I always wondered what you were thinking at that second.""</P>
<P>9.&nbsp; ""It ain't elves.""</P>
<P>10.&nbsp; ""&nbsp;I stopped by here to tell you two things. Number one is that you're going to die tonight. Number two, I'm going to go home, have a nice hot meal, then I'm gonna find your wife&nbsp;and I'm going to kill her too.""<BR></P>"

<P>A letter to the Rob of 1986:</P>
<P>Hey, it's me again.</P>
<P>First things first, Bridget is a dead-end.&nbsp; You'll think you're going to get there, but--and this important--<EM>no matter what happens,</EM>&nbsp;it will never happen between you two.&nbsp; The good news is that this does not impact your life in any real way.&nbsp; The better news is that the cooler girls are waiting just in the wings.&nbsp; There's one who's going to pop up in just four years, who--well, I won't spoil it for you.</P>
<P>Right about now, you may be wondering what to do once you graduate high school.&nbsp; Well, the bad news is that your grades just plain suck, so Montclair State isn't happpening.</P>
<P>The good news is, this also does not affect your life in any real way.</P>
<P>When you do go to a college, and you pick your major--right now, you're thinking of film--make sure you're lining up your career before you gradute--and while we're on the subject, no matter how tempting it is, don't take too light a class load.&nbsp; It seems like you've got a lot of free time, but you'll just be spinning your wheels.</P>
<P>By the way, do NOT count on your advisor to help you figure out your class schedule.&nbsp; You need to do this on your own, or it won't happen.</P>
<P>Learn to drive.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; It's not that hard, and once you start, you'll love it.</P>
<P>Okay, here's where things get scary. </P>
<P>You have to leave the nest.&nbsp; Study abroad.&nbsp; Leave Jersey.&nbsp; You can always come back.&nbsp; There is no reason to be afraid of travel.&nbsp; (Consider L.A.&nbsp; SERIOUSLY CONSIDER L.A.)</P>
<P>I debated telling you all sorts of other things to avoid, personal situations, professional situations...well, I hate to say this, but I'm not going to.</P>
<P>It sucks, I know, but if you don't fuck up here and there, you might never take any chances and you might not learn.</P>
<P>(Although I will&nbsp;say that if you attempt standup comedy, it WILL GO BADLY.)</P>
<P>Here's one big piece of personal advice:&nbsp; You first girlfriend is coming up soon.&nbsp; Two years from now.&nbsp; Don't get too excited, you haven't met her yet.&nbsp; Obviously, since I used the word ""first,"" that means that it won't last forever between you too.</P>
<P>My big piece of advice is that that is okay.&nbsp; Don't sweat it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>And for Christ's sake, don't get obessive and weird about it...when it's over...really, just let her go.&nbsp; I only tell you this because there's a chance you could miss out on a few other opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls will stay away if&nbsp;you're still focused on Girl #1.</P>
<P>LET.&nbsp; IT.&nbsp; GO.</P>
<P>The friends you are making now, amazingly, will be some of your best friends.&nbsp; Amazingly, you will still have several of them when you're my age.&nbsp; Friendship is the most important thing you've got in this world.&nbsp; Treasure them.&nbsp; (Just don't get creepy about it.)</P>
<P>Keep writing.&nbsp; And don't be afraid to get into trouble from time to time.&nbsp; Just make sure you don't get caught.</P>
<P>Also, you're only going to be able to drink alcohol for another ten years.&nbsp; Allergies.&nbsp; Ask Dad.</P>
<P>And, well, I guess that's it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Oh, and there's a film director you should look up:&nbsp; John Woo.&nbsp; Trust me, you'll love him.</P>
<P>Love,</P>
<P><SPAN class=ljuser style=""WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"">Your Pal,&nbsp; Rob Of The Future.</SPAN></P>
<P>p.s.&nbsp; Don't bother seeing any live-action Batman movie until the year 2005. You're just going to get angry.</P>"

Thanks goodness for guys like you. When you're in love, you can't hide it. Once you're sure how you feel, throwing yourself into the boyfriend routine is as natural as shaving. It starts with the framed photo of your sweetie on your desk and skyrockets from there. 

What gal hasn't pined away for the irresistible John Cusack-in-Say Anything type? You share that genuine boyfriend quality that's so sweet that it can give a person cavities. But once all the roses have wilted and the violins have quieted, you really start glowing. Recognizing that love isn't always going to be as gaga as your initial dating stage is your secret to relationship bliss. Your natural persistence keeps you thriving in the love and romance department.

Here's the catch: You might want to check in with yourself from time to time to make sure you're not avoiding real intimacy or hiding behind romantic games. We know, we know. It's more fun to just play. But keep in mind that true love is worth the work!"

"event","This is the result i got over at emode.com on the sex god test, lol.
   
Are You A Sex God? 
  
   
 
Hark - the oracle speaks! A bolt of lightning falls from the sky! SHAZAAM! As the smoke clears, the hidden deity in you emerges and is revealed to be:

EROS, God of Love. 

As a devotee of this long-neglected virtue, you are a committed romantic. You prefer to savor the joys of seduction before you step into the bedroom. This quality makes you incredibly attractive to women, who seem to melt in your presence. They sense your strong character and respect your ideals. They dream of stealing you away and making dreamy love to you all day long. Not to say you wouldn't be happy to oblige, but you want to make sure that there's some emotional or intellectual compatibility between you and your partner to carry the relationship along. By the time you are ready to show them your godly performance, they're hooked. You take sex seriously and show your lucky woman a passion that has only existed in her wildest dreams. You are probably an emotionally expressive and sensitive person whose pleasure comes from pleasing others. Your chivalrous ways have probably earned you a following of fans and a trail of satisfied mortals in your wake."

Patrick
 Like just 6% of the population you are a PERFORMER (DEAF)--personable, self-assured, and excellent under pressure. You are extroverted and strong-willed, which, in combination means you are good with people and aren't willing to let opportunity pass you by. Congratulations. I'm sure all the peons you've stepped on never saw it coming and didn't feel a thing. 

You like being naked. 

Anyhow, you have formidable creative talents, and you often following what your heart tells you instead of your logical mind. Your exuberance can earn you many friends and admirers, despite your ambition, or it can intimidate the less confident into keeping their distance. It's also possible you're Madonna."

"event","Mylissa and I went to the batting cages today, oodles and oodles of fun!! I sucked major ass on the 70 MPH though, weak sauce. I need practice. Mylissa did very well, especially for not even swinging a bat in 2 years. She's hopefully going to come and play softball with us Sunday, but it's kind of early Sunday, so we'll see. After that we went to the Disneyland, but it was still pretty crowded, so we only went on Roger Rabbit and the Jungle Cruise, but now Cupcake!!! lol. =-)   Then we went to ESPN Zone for dinner, and i got Mylissa to try the spinach and artichoke dip, and she actually liked it!!! That stuff is soooo good, almost an instant orgasm!! well, maybe not that good, but maybe it was because Mylissa was there that made it seem THAT good! Anyway, we had fun tonight, hopefully Friday we will too, assuming everyone is not anti everything. Mylissa got that ""anti"" word in my vocab, and i relaized it's very universal. Another wonderful gift from my friends. Mylissa and I are becoming realy close and it's really cool. So thank you Mylissa for being an awesome friend and someone I can always have fun with, i hope it's recipricol. Ok, it's pretty late, nigty night, dont let the bed bugs bite, they leave marks....... anyway, whenever anyone reads this, have a BEAUTIFUL day, or as Mylissa would say, a PRETTIFUL day."

"event","It's a marvelous days, isnt it??? well maybe not, but it's still today and I'm gonna try and make the most of it. Yesterday I had to go to LAX, and i went looking for belated christmas gifts that have evaded me, =( I found one of them, but just for the wrong Melissa. Then Dave, Melissa, and I all went to T.G.I.Fridays, my initial experience there. I just ate desert though, odd for me, i never eat desert. Then we took Mylissa home and i got to see her newly re-arranged and clean room, very magnifico. She did it all by herself, ""Im a big Girl Now!!"" Then i went home and proceeded to get in an argument w/ my parental units, which is always fun (sarcasm). Then i went running and worked out at Liberty Park a lil bit, which helped. Then i came home, took a shower, and went nighty night. Looking Forward to New Years, Matt has a date, and his date wants to go to DISNEYLAND!!! which is exactly where everyone who's cool will be New Years. Okey Doke, im gonna go. big *MUAAAAAH* to all of ya."

Finishing touches are being added as we speak and hopefully this teacher will give Melissa over 100% on this or I will personally beat his carcass until he screams for the little snowman in the sky to take his soul.  So far, we are up to 8 pages lol.  I am hyper as hell right now.  I am typing like 5000 words per minute.  Hopefully, the caffine will wear off so I can catch some Z's.

"event","Well i started writing in my journal last night, but then i was so rudely interupted by someone that shall remain nameless.... for now.
  So my kitchen is now torn up and construction has begun on the reclamation of this forsaken house. I'm all dirty from ripping wallpaper off the wall and helping move the refriguerator that the ice dispenser doesnt even work on!! Sorry, im a bit flustered right now, so dont mind me. 
Melissa and Dave and I wentbowling yesterday. We missed Matt even though we went and saw him at work, it just wasnt the same, ya know?? Todays Tuesday by the way!!! (wink wink) ""Wheres my corn bread!!"" - Dave quote. Paul and Breanne are fighting again!!!! Too much drama, i swear!!! Cant we all just get along. Melissa ( not you!!) and I are going to go pick Sean up from the airport on Friday to surprise him. I cant wait to see him, i feel as though im not the same Pat without my seany boy, *sniffle sniffle*, not really but i do miss the lil guy. Stalkers suck major, HAIRY ass. :-) 
Everybody is asking me what i want for Christmas, so here we go.... For Christmas I would like one night of consentual (sp?) sex with Heidi Klum and Shakira, 'cause god damn those hips are the sexxxxist hips i have ever seen, woooooooo
ok, but really i would like for all my friends to get together in one place for one night and just hang out and party like old times. Paul, breanne, matt, ERIC, Dave, melissa, melissa, chanel, Ryan, Josh, Sean, Brian, Brandon, Mike, Matt, the other brian, Christina, Elizabeth, that other Kristina i havent seen since 8th grade, and all you other Gaylord Faulkers!! So, thats what i want for Christmas.

  Well my parents are getting ready to sell this god forsaken house finally, but of course I'll be doing most of the moving work. But at least that way it gets done. My mom and i just had a fight about her smoking, We're getting ready to re-do our kitchen, and if we're going to that I dont want her smoking in there! Thats gross! I hate ciggarettes, if you smoke, QUIT JACKASS!!! its a disgusting habit. If you really need something in your mouth all the time, theres plenty of other things you could be putting in there. 
  I had an interview at Tower Records today, i'll know by tomorrow if i got it. I dont think i did, but we'll see. Matt and I are playing Disc Golf manana, then Ryan and I are going Christmas shopping, and then Ryan, Josh, Melissa and I are going to the CSULB Volleyball game. So yea, see ys when i see ya.

"event","So, College is interesting. Let me just tell you Nova is so easy. 
   I am taking History- the prof. talks the whole time while we take notes and thats it.
   Sociology- interesting, the professor is extremely opinionated but at least we know were he stands i guess. I have to read a book called The Demon Haunted World (A Candle in the Dark) it is incredibly boring in the beginning but its getting better. The title is cool though. 
   Liberal Arts Math- really easy so far, if you are bad in math this class is great. There are so many math problems for homework though. Thats the only bad thing so far. 
   Art History- Mrs. Lash is great, she is very funny. We just run through a chapter of the humongous book every class while looking at cave paintings, so far. The only thing i don't like about this class is that you have to do a presentation...I hate them so much, I don't see what the point of doing them is. 
   That's all of the classes I am taking, only four this semester. Amber is in all of my classes so we carpool each other. The problem with signing up for all of the same classes with Amber is that I have her to talk to so i haven't really met to many other people. 
   My best friend Megan is off at ECU, she likes it there but has a lot of projects and stuff. And Jordyn is in Utah, I miss them..."

Today's half day in school seemed just as long to me as a regular day, I think I fell asleep in Algebra
or just zoned out because when I went back to work on the problem I had strange numbers that didn't make
sense down. 
 I'm going to my grandparent's house for Thanksgiving,who live in Warrington. All of my dad's relatives
will be there. This year we are also having some other people that are apparently related to me, coming and 
they have little kids who will be sitting by me...I just hope they aren't annoying. Besides going to my 
grandparent's house, I'm really not doing anything but I want to go see Finding Neverland, which looks 
really good."

The first few weeks are ok but I do wish there was still more then two weeks left because after school gets going you have to suffer for 9 more months. I really don't know what I am going to do after highschool though, I might just end up going to NOVA, which is fine with me anyway. Senoir pictures was the 10th, it went ok, there were only about 5 other people there. It felt weird being back in that empty school. I hope the pictures turn out ok."

So i have 13 out of 40 hours i need to get my license... My brother also took me driving that night while it was raining. My mom needed us to go grocery shopping for her, i've never driven at night or in the rain before so that was interesting considering i couldn't see the lines on the road from the glare of all the headlights. But it was cool, i got to drive my brothers jetta. Yesterday in my guitar class, all the bands had to play on stage in front of our class while she video taped it. It was worth four grades. Dan, who plays the melody in both of our songs, didn't show up until one band before we went on. It was a good thing he did show up because Justin and i would have had to play by ourselves, Justins the cords and i am the bass player. We did pretty good, it was alot better than our practise one last time. Then today I found out i past my chemistry SOL, so i passes the class. Also today is Jennifers birthday!"

"event","ok so today i got my wisdom teeth pulled out, they gave me so many shots of novicane it isn't funny. Luckally i couldn't feel anything after that and i chose to be awake while they did it, don't ask me why, man my mouth hurts right now! anyway they only part i didn't watch was when the dentist told me to close my eyes cause he was sewing up my gums were we pulled out my teeth, i had 4 removed. After it was done they stuffed my cheeks with gaws, i looked like a chipmunk or as jen puts it ren from Even Stevens when her cheeks got all puff after she got her braces off. The nurse or dentist's assistant or whatever you call her asked me if i wanted to see my teeth, i shook my head no, i would prefer not to, she said they looked like dice... so now i am hunger but everytime i try to eat something like pudding or ice cream it hurts soo bad just to swallow so i think i would rather put up with my stomach grumbling that all that pain, it really sucks. The medicine helps a bit though so i don't feel to bad, i guess. Zsazsa i think or i hope i will be up to going to your party, i really want to go. Thanx again everyone for the comments :) you guys are the best. I think i will go rest so i can recover. Jorydn i posted the address to the website i got the pick from on the last entry in the comments thing."

WHile we were there we went to Nemacolin and went in the old run down factory's were my uncle worked in the mines and we got lots of pics. Last monday we went to west virginia to some lodge, wasn't much there either except the outdoor pool that we swam at at 10pm and there were no outside lights in or around the pool the only one they had was on the door leading to the inside of the lodge. So basically i just watched alot of tv and stuff. Wednesday i have to go get my wisdom teeth pulled out, which really sucks.

"event","I just got back from Delaware, i went to Rehobith's boardwalk which was awsome, it had lots of little shops and it had theme park rides me and jen went on 3 of them, the paratrooper, spinning tea cups, and the haunted mansion (which was totally lame) and the night before i went on the sea dragon, i hated that ride, and some alien spaceship ride which was pretty interesting except the fact that it was as hot as an oven in there. The beach was cool i went body-surfing but there weren't to many big waves...and i got a little sun burned and NO TAN!!  Oow and i got to go to Pacsun's i love that store, i got 2 Roxy shirts and 1 Billabong shirt, also a belt and a pink star braclet that rocks, oh and i also got my hair cut at the mall there so now it is a little below the shoulders and layered, i like it. Also it was my moms b-day on the 24th the first night we lesf and then on the 26th it was my dads b-day, which was thursday, our car broke down though that day and it was roasting hot out and he were stuck on the side of the road, luckally some army people were doing something with the road close by and came and gave us water. Then when the towtruck came my whole family, except my brother who didn't come, all had to sit up front with the driver so jen hoped in first by the driver, she had to be by the stick shift (haha) and then i sat by her then my dad hopped in and my mom had to sit on his lap and we were all crunched in ther together and it was like 90 degree's so we were all hot and sweaty it was pretty bad. Then we had to wait around at the car place for them to fix it, luckally it only to like 2 hours. Sunday i saw Finding Nemo that was a cute movie i liked it.  Yesterday before going back to the boardwalk we out to eat at Friendly's and my dad decided jens new family nickname was going to be Betty Buttkiss LOL i thought that was funny so ever sense then he calls her betty! so anyway i am bored now so maybe i will write more later."

One of the guys named Matt died, so many people in my classes knew him so it was hard to see everyone so sad and crying yesterday. Since we only have one teacher at my school that teaches drivers ed. and it is required in the 10th grade my driers ed. teacher new him and told us about it and how he tought us better than to not where seat belts,that it increses your chances of surival by 50%. He told us how life is to short and that you never know when its going to be your time to go so you should appreciate everything you have because to manythings are taken for granted, like telling your parents you love them and how greatful you are to have your friends. So while I still have time i just wanted to say thanx Jordyn for being my bestfriend and always being there for me, your the best, I love you. Zsazsa thanx for being there for me too! and burning cds for me and just making me laugh, I love you too! Changing subjects- sorry i forgot to bring your les miz cd last dance class, i'll give it to you the next time i see you or on monday, i'll call you. Zsazsa i still need to call you too, sorry! Yea, if you are busy this week there is always next week. Well gotta do hw.

I'm sorry 
I heard about the bad news today
A crowd of people around you 
Telling you it's okay
And everything happens for a reason

When you lose a part of your self
To somebody you know
It takes a lot to let go
Every breath that you remember
Pictures fade away but memory is forever

An empty chair at all the tables
And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down
But it's better where you're going anyway

I'm sorry 
I heard about the bad news today
It's really hard to get through
Tough times and long days
But it really just depends on the season

For now we'll say goodbye 
We know it's not the last time
I've lost the best part of my day
But it's better where you're going anyway

This is the last thing
I will remember 
It's better where you're going anyway"

When I went to the class room i almost chickened out cause i thought i had to do cpr and resque breathing stuff by myself while the class watched but luckilly that is not what happens. We got to practice with partners and Mr. Dulin just walked around and watched and then gave us a situation and asked us to show him what to do, it was easy. Monday was dance and i got to see my jordyn!!! i missed her soo much but hopefully we are getting together this friday. I was hoping Heather would be back in class but she wasn't, i hope she is next week even if she is just watching cause i want to see that she is ok so i can stop worrying. Today in my bio class this guy told me he loved me...(i am pretty sure he was joking)then he said do you know whay i love you, cause you wear your black chuck taylors more than anyother girl i know, i wasn't even wearing them today....he is weird then he sat really close to me practically on my chair and put his head on my shoulder...i was like ok, he was creepin me out!

Bio was last block we had a test and it was soo hard that Ms. Mayes said that if we failed it she would just throw it away and it wouldn't count as anything, and if we passed it with something like a 65% or more we get a home work pass so its all good! Everyone finished the test with like an hour left of class, so then we took notes and gave us worksheet packets. I just kind of sat around for the last 15 min. because i didn't feel like working anymore. I guess noone else felt like it either because to guys who sat across from me and one behind me, the were putting the stapler on eachothers arms but not pushing all the way down.Then one of the boys accidentally pushed it down to hard on the others arm and it went in his arm! eew...he pulled it out but said it hurt bad, that was so gross. Then the dude who accidently stappled the other guys arm desided for some strange reason to staple his arm on purpose!! ugh i felt sick, the the guy infront of him put a staple in his arm too, then this girl behind me put a stapple way in her arm...it was sooo gross i seriously felt sick it was so nasty, why would anyone do that!! But enough about that stuff, I am not sure if i am going to Annie tomorrow or sunday now cause megan forgot she had plans at the same time! So we are either goin sunday and i am going to the coffee house with megan saturday or she will have to cancelle and we go saturday...my mom is desided though so...yup thats about it for now...today at school wasn't as bad as yesterday so...i don't know!?!"

He is getting a red jetta so that will be 10times better than that ugly maroon van that is as old as i am! (no lie!!) So that will be cool cause i will get to ride in it to school and back.

Yay! no gym till April cause we started C.P.R. class and then FLE (i was wrong we are havin it this year...eew) But i don't think we will be taught much cause it is my drivers ed. teacher who is teachin us and he is a man so we prolly aren't ever seperratin boys and girls. Its kind of funny that my entries are so short most of the time when i have plenty of time to write but when i have major homework due the next day i can just ramble on and on about any ol'thing ;) But anyway in Spanish class i have to get up infront of the class with my partner and present our conversation that had to be memoriezed (it was only 5 lines) but anyway i am extremely shy at school, ask anyone, but i remembered all my line and glanced at the class every now and then so i thing i did a great job! Blah school, i can't wait for spring break i think i only have 2 more weeks till then! Me and the family are goin to NC but i don't think it will be for all of spring break just a few days...ok i think i finally ran out of thing to, actually Jordyn we got a min.&45 seconds done for the dance recital, the song is 5min. long but ms. lisa cut it to 3min. and says she is gonna cut a little more, we basically finally finished learning most of the dance except the very very end we just know we are gonna end in a pyramid. it will be interesting.

Then gym oh the joy of p.e., lets so today there was a substitute so it was open gym but we still had to do something. For most people open gym is the best time and you get to talk to your friends and everything but not for me in this class i am pretty much alone...i don't like this class at all. So i just practiced shooting baskets with a girl i sort of now, but 1 hour and 40 min. of just shooting hoops getts extremely tiring and boring, at least for me.

Breathing deeply, walking backwards,
finding strength to call and ask her
Rollercoaster favorite ride,
let me kiss you one last time

Leave me standing here, act like I'm not around
The coaster probably never clear, can I please go home now
I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in,
and there I stay

Lay beside me and listen out the wall, 
we'll keep on lying until the summer comes
I had that dream about you again, 
where you drive my car right off the f****** cliff

And now I`m breathing deeply, walking backwards,
finding strength to call and ask her,
Rollercoaster favorite ride,
let me kiss you one last time

Make me promise that I will never tell,
all I remember's the way your bedroom smells
I had that dream about you again,
where I wait outside until you let me in

And now I'm breathing deeply,walking backwards,
finding strength to call and ask her
Rollercoaster favorite ride,
let me kiss you one last time good night

"event","Spanish class today -.- oh well we actually didn't do much except talk about how it is better to marry a bad looking guy who is sweet on the inside than a hot looking person who is a jerk...the teacher is kind of weird, then she says but it is better if they r nice and good looking then u got the whole package, but it would help if he had, and then she pats her butt! everyone laughed and gave eachother funny looks like umm your a teacher and saying that? Then she is like NO it didn't mean that i was patting my wallet in my pocket!! It was funny...Woo art tomorrow only bad thing is we are drawing the person from across the table which is cool except when i have to sit still for 30 min. while the other person is drawing me, it is so hard to sit still and stare at a wall and not move at all! Oh well one more day of that.

Simple Plan 
I'm Just A Kid 

I woke up it was 7 
Waited till 11 
just to figure our that no one would call 
I think i got a lot of friends but I don't hear from them 
What's another night all alone? 
When your spending everyday on your own 
and here it goes 

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare 
I'm just a kid, I know that its not fair 
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is 
having more fun than me 

And maybe when the night is dead, i'll crawl into my bed 
Staring at these 4 walls again 
I'll try to think about the last time, I had good time 
Everyone's got somewhere to go 
And they're gonna leave me here on my own 
and here it goes 

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare 
I'm just a kid, I know that its not fair 
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is 
having more fun than me 

What the h*** is wrong with me? 
don't fit in with anybody 
How did this happen to me? 
Wide awake I'm bored and I can't fall asleep 
Cause every night is the worst night ever 

I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare 
I'm just a kid, I know that its not fair 
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is 
Nobody wants to be alone in the world

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare 
I'm just a kid, I know that its not fair 
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is 
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is 
having more fun than me, tonight

I'm all alone tonight 
Nobody cares tonight 
Cause i'm just a kid tonight"

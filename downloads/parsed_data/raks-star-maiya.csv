"event","Mere has inspired me to start recording my dreams. Last night, I dreamed up an awesome sequel to the hotly discussed Wad Dream:&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm sitting at&nbsp;a gorgeous poolside tiki bar on a warm night. All of my friends are there and we're having a great time.<br /><br />Michelle nudges me and says, ""Eww, it's HECTOR."" **&nbsp;<br /><br />Herman walks by, and I whip my head around, turn up my&nbsp;nose and make&nbsp;what I call the Snotty Belly Dancer face. I scowl audibly at him, and everybody laughs.&nbsp;<br /><br />A minute later, he approaches me, handing me a napkin. On the napkin, he had scrawled: <em>""Please forgive me. You have done so much for me that I can't begin to describe it. I could write a book about you. Call me sometime. (XXX) XXX-XXXX.""&nbsp;<br /></em><br />I read the message, stare askance at him for a moment, and begin laughing so hard that I am gasping for air.&nbsp;<br /><br />""Go home, Hector**,"" I say. <br /><br />This blank-faced, leggy chick with stereotypically ""exotic"" features is staring vapidly at him--I think this was his girlfriend--and he turns and walks&nbsp;toward her.&nbsp;<br /><br />My friends all stand up and cheer.&nbsp;<br /><br />THE END.&nbsp;<br /><br />What's with all of these dreams? I guess my brain's been working overtime to process the shock of losing somebody that I thought was a very good and honest friend. At least this dream was a bit more encouraging, giving me the upper hand in the end and reminding me that my friends are cheering me on. <br /><br />Still not quite sure what Herman's gf really looks like, but the fact that she was represented as lifeless and stereotypically ""exotic""&nbsp;&nbsp;in the dream (think Penelope Cruz, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie) probably reveals the insecurity that I'd had all along that he had&nbsp;been attracted to me as&nbsp;this cardboard cutout of something ""seductive"" and ""mysterious"" and never wanted to get to know the real me.&nbsp;I've always pictured him with a vapid jet-setting supermodel type who eats sashimi for breakfast and parties with celebrities and breathes imported air, but is entirely lacking in real-life knowledge. &nbsp;(An antithesis of me: small-town girl who lacks the means to travel, but has street smarts, book smarts, a broad worldview, an open mind and a legitimate curiosity about all different cultures not just because it's trendy). <br /><br />The napkin blurb ""I could write a book about you:"" damn right, you could write a book about me. Once again, this was a touchy subject while we were friends. Did he understand the real me or did he merely stop at the superficial? I'd always longed for him to find me compelling, brilliant and complex--and to tell me, if he did. But it never quite happened. Though he complimented me on many things, the praises never pertained to my true depth of character. I think this dream reflects a conversation that I'd had with a friend recently about how guys never appreciate a strong, intelligent woman until they dump her for a fembot. (Or they never see the error in their ways, and cheat on their fembots with saucier women).&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway. Analyze if you please ;) Hopefully my subconscious will stop beating this dead horse and return to dreaming about lighter, funnier things. Like ""Chinnigan"" tap dancing in a bra and leggings.<br /><br />~Lisa<br /><br /><br />** Hector: Around the first couple of months that I'd gotten to know Herman, he went MIA on me for several months. (Turns out he'd been living&nbsp;in Puerto Rico and Florida). One day at work, Michelle asked, ""Why don't you hang out with Hector anymore?"" She meant Herman. We jokingly referred to him as Hector for about a year, typically when discussing his more asinine habits. Eventually, we filled him in on the joke. Needless to say, it never amused him.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Edit: (One more thing to add) The message was written on a torn up, crumpled&nbsp;piece of napkin--looked very similar to the wad that was stuck in my cheek in my last dream. Very weird recurring theme. Any significance? </strong><br /><br />"

"event","<p>Best Daytime TV moment ever: today, Ellen DeGeneres was poking fun at a video clip of Suhaila Salimpour's famous glute squeezes, and attempting a couple herself.&nbsp;<br /><br />(If Rachel Ray latched her grubby paws onto raks sharqi, I would just have to gouge out my eyeballs with a spoonula.)<br /><br />So....SKETCH ALERT!&nbsp;I went to scout out that prospective club gig last night. The nightclub promoter that I'd met on MySpace was really cool, very much into creating a sexy, buzzworthy vibe in the upstairs lounge that had opened up. (Downstairs is a very generic bar/tavern kinda place). We talked about our vision, it all sounded good and then, on my way out the door, while trying to remember where I'd parked, I ran into this big-ass dude.&nbsp;<br /><br />He was like ""You look confused. The bathroom's over there."" I told him I wasn't looking for the bathroom, I was scoping the place out because I'd probably&nbsp;be belly dancing there.&nbsp;<br /><br />The guy looked at me like I had two heads, seemed rather offended, and said ""BELLY DANCING?""&nbsp;<br /><br />""Yeah, belly dancing!"" I said. ""Gustavo wants to get me in the upstairs lounge, and.....--""&nbsp;<br /><br />""Gustavo has NO AUTHORITY to hire you,"" the guy interrupted. ""I'm the owner!"" (Oh SHIT). ""And why would you BELLY DANCE here?""&nbsp;<br /><br />So I haughtily retort: ""All of the hottest clubs in New York, LA and Miami have belly dancers.""<br /><br />""What's yer rate?""&nbsp;<br /><br />""2 sets at $75 a set; that's $150 for the whole night.""&nbsp;<br /><br />""You want US to pay YOU $150 to dance? Why? People get up and dance here for free all the time!""&nbsp;<br /><br />""I'm a professional dancer.""&nbsp;<br /><br />""Well....you got a card?""&nbsp;<br /><br />*whips one out, grudgingly gives it out*&nbsp;<br /><br />""Oh. So you ARE for real."" <br /><br />So....EWWWW.&nbsp;Ironic that this jerk was questioning MY professionalism.&nbsp;<br /><br />Even if they decide they want me,&nbsp;I doubt I'll take&nbsp;this gig. My integrity is worth much more than the $25 they probably want to pay me. Scary thing is, my local BD community is so full of American Idol wannabes who would jump at the chance to perform for $30. I am very afraid that they'll bring 'em all in by the truckload and get like, 10 reeeeeally bad amateurs for the price of one top-of-the-line Maiya. *shudder*<br /><br />Sadly, to a lot of club owners, belly dance is all about skin. And to them, skin is skin, whether it's a professional who's been dancing for 10 years or a ghastly amateur who's only been going at it for 6 months. I've even noticed that attitude among Middle Eastern restaurant owners, shockingly. They'd rather have somebody vaguely Turkish looking, for instance, than a dancer who truly represents the art and the culture that it comes from. And there's so much complacency among dancers; nobody's taking any measures to correct this backasswards attitude.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the shit that becomes very disheartening if you really, truly think about it. And that's why I'm just not going to think about it anymore.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the end, I only want to make moves that will&nbsp;position me as a respectable name in the local community. That's the only way to rise above. A lot of these pissy nightclub and restaurant gigs are so not worth it at the end of the day. Like, what good have I done for my reputation or for that of Middle Eastern dance as a whole if I dance for below the going rate at a venue that just doesn't understand this art form? Have I really succeeded as a dancer if I'm dancing for only two tables or vying for attention with somebody's moussaka at a Turkish restaurant? And why in the fuck are all of the bratty divas of the local and national BD community fighting each other over this?&nbsp;<br /><br />On the up side, I have AT LEAST 4 classes in the works right now. I finally got in touch with two of my prospects today, and it's looking very promising. Results Fitness Spa for Women wants me. And the Dance Workshop also wants me, which is REALLY exciting. Everybody who's everybody in my area studies at the Dance Workshop. Their reputation is absolutely&nbsp;fantastic, and being associated with that name will do wonders for my credibility as I'm getting established. They want me to teach an a.m. class for stay-at-home moms, and 3 evening classes (pre-teen, teen and adult), AND possibly offer another evening class during the week. This could be huge for me!&nbsp;<br /><br />So yeah. One door closes, 4+ others open ;)&nbsp;That is a very, very good thing. <br /><br />~Lisa</p>"

"event","<p>Because we've all been talking about dreams lately, here's&nbsp;your latest glimpse into the freak show that is my subconscious mind. If somebody can analyze this weird dream I had last night, I'll be amazed:<br /><br />I'm walking around and talking with a friend at some sort of an outdoor fair.* It's a hot, nasty summer day and all of a sudden, I feel this really weird wad forming in my mouth. It feels like a cross between gauze and plastic, and begins to grow, cutting into the inside of my cheek.&nbsp;<br /><br />I keep talking to the friend, ignoring the weird sensation in my mouth at first, until the wad--whatever it is--starts to suffocate me. Slowly, I feel all of the energy leaving my body, and tell my friend that I think I'm dying. My friend says nothing, turns around and vanishes. I then see this beautiful white bed in front of me and pass out for a moment on it. When I come to, I see my old friend Debbie** in front of me, dressed entirely in white. There's a white glow around everything at this point. She pulls a blanket over me, kisses me on the forehead and tells me everything will be OK.&nbsp;<br /><br />I take every last bit of strength, reach into my mouth and rip the wad out. In my hand, it transforms from the weird cotton/gauze/plastic substance to a fortune, like you'd find in a fortune cookie. I read it out loud (the only word I can now remember on the fortune is <em>friend) </em>and upon reading it, I feel very empty inside.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then, I wake up.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am almost positive this dream is symbolic of my friendship/sexual relations&nbsp;with Herman. (I haven't explained it here on LJ, but my friends know about it). Last night, I'd discovered something very upsetting in his MySpace that revealed that he'd lied to me about something huge. In one night, I found out that our entire friendship essentially was a farce. So I confronted him in a very nasty e-mail and haven't heard back from him. I think the wad that suffocated me in the dream was symbolic of my feelings of deceit and degradation: it went from a minor nuisance to something emotionally deadly in no time.&nbsp;Also, I think the recurring death/rebirth imagery has something to do with the demise of the part of me that used to make myself a martyr for jerks. <br /><br />What do you guys think? Any Freudians out there?&nbsp;Help!!!<br /><br />~Lisa<br /><br />*The friend wasn't anybody I knew from real life, but the fair was nearly identical to this one stretch of the World's Longest Garage Sale that I visited with an ex 3 years ago.&nbsp;<br />** Debbie: great chick that I know from belly dance. She was never a very close friend of mine, and I seldom talk to her anymore, but in the past, she used to give me these very caring heart-to-heart kind of talks about standing up for my rights, being true to myself and not letting others bring me down. </p>"

"event","This past week, my single friends and I did my share of bitching about guys. And I think&nbsp;it's time to shut the fuck up.&nbsp;

Why do we insist on pursuing--and complaining about--jerks, players and other tools? In recent weeks, I forgot just how content I am to do my own thing. Life is too short, and too beautiful, to get caught up in the drama.&nbsp;

To offset my bitching, here are some wonderful and positive things that this week has offered me:

* I taught my first dance class

* Went out with Michelle last night, hung out in Borders, went to Barcelona (the wine bar in Fairfield, not the city in Spain), had a great time bullshitting with two hysterically funny businessmen who paid for our drinks and dinner, drove past John Mayer's house

* Putting together a sexy reggaeton fusion piece with Isis wings (""Noche de Adrenalina"" by Pilar Montenegro and Don Omar)

* Finding just the PERFECT Austrian crystal starfish to use as a centerpiece for my mermaid belt

*Doing Bollywood workout videos at home by myself late at night, laughing my ass off the whole time

* Rockin' even harder at my spinning and double veil

* Had margaritas and got the NW dirt from a former co-worker

* Woke up this morning to my adorable 1-year-old golden retriever Molly playfully growling at me

* My tan is friggin' AMAZING!

* Met a nightclub promoter on MySpace; looks like I may have a regular nightclub gig!

* I'm writing for pleasure again after two years

* It's gonna be a beautiful, sunny weekend here in CT: I'm SO going to the beach!"

"event","Because I'm bright eyed and bushy-tailed at 7 a.m., here are my three:&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Teeth Falling Out:<br /></strong>Yes, it's cliche in the land of dreams. And, yes, losing a tooth is tamer than, say, being chased by a giant key lime pie. (This was my dad's recurring nightmare as a kid. Alas, I digress). But this one really effin' bothers me, and I don't know why! Usually, my teeth kind of crack and fall out, and I can vividly feel the sockets left behind. Maybe the Freudians are right; I am going through growing pains. Or maybe it just goes to show my deep rooted horror of dental procedures. (Who wouldn't loathe dental work when your dental hygenist loves to ask you about your ex-boyfriend while prodding your mouth with sharp objects?)<br /><br /><strong>""Dude, Where Are My Pants?""<br /></strong>A spin on the classic naked dream. Typically, I'm strutting down the street, minding my own business, when it suddenly occurs to me: I'm not wearing pants! (Sometimes, I'm topless). Sometimes, it bothers me. Other times, I joyfully keep on truckin'. Obviously, this has everything to do with the fact that belly dancers don't wear clothing. *groan*<br /><br /><strong>The Local Friendly Health Food Store (You know which one): <br /></strong>Back in my days of retail whoredom, I could not escape from work. Even in my sleep. My dreams were really scary, vivid and often violent. Common themes: weird government surveillance, the owners plotting to murder me and other employees, being stalked and threatened&nbsp;by the owner's daughter, being accused in court of crimes that I didn't commit. (I'm not even making this up). I typically had one graphic nightmare about work each night; some nights, I'd have as many as 10 and feel sick the next day. Other employees who were harassed and targeted like me reported the same thing. I could have sued them for psychological disturbance! No, really. I could have.&nbsp;<br /><br />My scariest NW nightmare? Chinnigan, the owner's daughter, decided to take all of us into the city to see <em>Cats </em>on Broadway for being such great employees. During the show, she gets up on stage, says ""HOLD UP!!!"" and strips off this weird robe to reveal a bra and leggings (like what she allegedly wore on a summer day last year), and starts tap dancing.&nbsp;<br /><br />Nothing beats Michelle's NW nightmare, though: she and the grocery manager, a huge body builder notorious for his not-so-cuddly disposition, were baking chocolate cakes for Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's birthday party.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'll leave it there. Analyze this, mofos."

"event","<p>To reprise the mantra of my last entry: Everything is unfolding as it needs to unfold. The universe is working itself out, and positive changes are actually starting to filter into my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's about mothafuckin' time, man.&nbsp;<br /><br />I think losing my job is what it took to get me to let go, send out all of my good intentions and wait patiently to reap the benefits. As of now, I'm&nbsp;trying to go with the flow and not&nbsp;tear my hair out over the irresolution of the moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;Slowly, I'm learning. I'm not a hopeless case, after all. <br /><br />This week has been looking up. My upcoming Westport class is looking very promising. Jo, the owner of the health club, is amazing. She got me an ad in today's issue of the Westport News. How hot is that? Also, I got two calls today&nbsp;from future students. And when I went to Wild Oats tonight, I noticed that all of the little slips on the bottom of my flier were torn off. Fucking unbelievable. Tomorrow, I'm going to check in on my flier situation at the other places I've posted them at, and I'm definitely putting up some more. Call me a flier slut, but I totally get off on self-promotion.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of my future students, Brianna, is 13 years old.&nbsp;The girl called me tonight and was more articulate than most people I know who are twice my age. Can't wait to work with her. For some reason, I've always loved sharing my dancing with teenage girls. Somewhere along the line, I really want to do a dance class strictly for teen and pre-teen girls. I suppose it's all a way for me to vicariously reverse my past: if some kind person had simply given me the permission to feel safe in my own skin, I probably never would have had half of the body image problems I had as a teenager.&nbsp;Because I went through things that no teenager should ever have to go through, I feel a moral obligation to protect young girls from harmful beauty standards.&nbsp;<br /><br />Damn, I hope that didn't come off as <em>motherly</em>.&nbsp;Gawd forbid.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway. My Westport class is looking great. Next step? Put the PR and the English degree to good use. I want to pitch a business profile type of story to the local media, but I really have bigger plans in the end. I've got an essay in the planning stages that I ultimately plan on pitching to Vanity Fair, Vogue, and other biggies. I really want to do a beautifully written think piece that shows the transformation I've been through while coming into my own as a dancer. I want to talk about my unique relationship with Colleen/Adina, my slipping into and out of the Maiya alter ego, and my ultimate reconciliation of mind and body. All with elegant verbiage, of course.&nbsp;The past four years have truly been a fucked-up coming-of-age fairytale. And I'm dying to tell the story. I think belly dance is finally mainstream enough where this actually would be relevant to the big fashion and lifestyle magazines.&nbsp;<br /><br />I just have a good feeling about all of this. My charisma will set me apart in the field. And my love for writing and publicity will help me to go the distance. I want to be a persona and a brand, not just a dancer. My goal is to have <em>that thing. </em>You know when somebody is so cool that you want to bottle up their essence and wear it on a chain around your neck? That is what I ultimately aspire to be. I'll settle for nothing less.&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of settling for nothing less, that's how I'm approaching relationships now. No meaningless hookups. No more pursuing assholes and wondering why I'm always treated like shit. No more letting guys take advantage of me. Over. Done. Finito. The only way I'll get others to respect me is if I respect myself. Enough said.&nbsp;<br /><br />So yes. It's coming along. Life's good again. Buddha Bar vol. IV is also good. Lots of nice stuff for veil and tray.&nbsp;<br /><br />It goes without saying: I'm only accepting Boyfriend Applications from candidates with a high tolerance for endless chatter about belly dance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lisa<br /><br /></p>"

we met with trent/brando/nick/steph/anne at liz's. coolcool. when i first got there i was attacked by matt. he looks like a skunk. hes hot. there were so many people. i was amazed. a lot of hot hot people too. i saw everyferkin one....bill/jake/girlfrom rachaels/lauren/court/kim/garrett/rachel+herfriend. it was actually kinda fun. i noticed tho that everyone had converse on. like everyone. didnt matter what color or shoelace, it was converse. damn. it was like you couldnt get in without having them on. so much for individuality....
yea so once lauren got there i wouldnt let her leave. heh. but i mostly stuck with brandon trent nick and jake. and garrett too. hes entertaining. plus i got a hug from jon :) and i met these weird-haired people. 1) red (maroon..) haired kid named jeff and 2) long haired kid named dan. brandon introduced me. speaking of brandon i got to talk to him after. i miss that kid, it was cool. hmm..pat has a band!!!1 what!! dude it was crazy. but hes still 8th grade pat on the inside. watching drew dance is outstanding. and spencer..different story. blahhh what am i forgetting. ohh yea then a buncha people were playing twister, yasmine was cracking me up and we all got a nice butt shot of jon (kthxbye, o.0, XD, etc.) me and lauren kept sneaking in the VIP room.

AND i get to miss assy musical


but other than that i feel like shit. total shit. and i jinxed myself into it because i said i wouldnt get sick. nice going asshole. i walked into dance today and liz was like ""WIHAD YOU LOOK LIKE HELL!!11"" (but in a more simpathetic way). and i felt like passing out while we were doing our spiral leg swings. im glad mrs banks noticed because i was too afraid to ask if i could call home. so i finally got to the attendance office and the bitch was being SO MEAN i just started crying. i dont know why i cried. i cried like 7 different random times in the time between 7:30 and 9:15. 

but tomorrow will be better, i promise.

Dear Journal, 
HAPPIEST DAY OF MY FUCKING LIFE. 

Dear Dad,
Thank you for understanding.

Dear Gel, 
Thank you for making me bring it up

Dear ****, 
Thank you for turning me down. and no, this isnt sarcasm. 

Dear Rachael, 
COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

I am so happy. i havent felt like this at all this year. im doing company next year. My dad said if i got a 4.0 next semester i could do company. i dont know what to do with myself. i called gel crying. oh my lord. I dont think anyone understands, this is all ive wanted since i started high school. i thought it got taken away from me when my dad told me i couldnt do it next year. its been eating me up inside. but last night, i had a certain conversation with a certain someone. i guess it made me look sad or something, because my dad noticed and kept asking me what was wrong. i just started up on the lecture about the meaning of dance that mrs banks gave us. i explained to him how i just wanted to be a part of it. he was still convinced it was trashy and that i should focus more on academics. 
our agreement. 
me - 4.0 next semester
equals=dance company/car next year. 

i cant believe this. nothing can get me down. no one. nothing. i love it. i love chances.

I'm finally getting a real chance at something that i want. this is so good. i love this. ahhhh eaouit89aeytgp9ueoahgpoureygp9a7rgharo

"event","yesterday was so fucking fun. 
in dance we had a guest teacher. he was hilarious but everytime we laughed mrs banks would make a face and huff and puff and blow our houses down. why is she so disgruntled?
the chemistry final..blah. it was so easy. why was i worried? i didnt really study but im seriously expecting like at least a B-. 
after school i ventured off to liz's house where we were accompanied by annie and sarah. we called john and told him to get pizza. john, being the bad driver he is, said ok. so john, catherine, angelica, and lauren all came later. it was so fun. i felt like i was on a natural high the whole time. we watched saved by the bell and had a mini nsync talent show. i wish brandi coulda gone, but i didnt know where she was and it was snowing so hard i doubt she coulda made it. im excited to hang out with branderss tho on saturday hopefully. john was making disgusting genital jokes and ii wanted to put my head in a box and wait for him to stop. ewww. so we totally were just being crazy idiots the whole time and i LOVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEED IT i wish i could do it always. forever. times ten.
me and catherine discussed how we'd be related. because when natalie marries eli that would make natalie my sister in law once removed after i marry ...'him'. heeh.. and then catherine would be my 2nd cousin...or something and john would be related to me some how. but shut up. angelica figured it out. so you can too. or not.
so me and catherine decided johns not her boyfriend, its her pet. 
so after cathering and john and lauren left, everyone went outside to play in the stupid snow. and i was like hail naw. but later after lauren came back i got dragged out there somehow. but cool. i almost fell in the creek NOT knowing it was the creek. liz showed me her sledding technique and i was like baby girl no, this is how you do it. and i just dove on to the hill and rolled down. that is sledding. haha. we buried gel. and gave her a dick. and boobs. wow. so after like 2 hours we went inside and tried to study for history. then i went home. and studied? hmm.. yea. that was fun. i wish i could do it always. eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee wowo maybe one of my longest entries? yes? no?"

i've had no time to talk to anyone or do anything for the past week now. and my energy levels gone way down. all ive been doing is schhooool school school and more school. and the worst part is, my grades are still stupid. i dont get it. last year i would NEVER get b's. i got one b in geometry last year and it killed me. now i'm lucky if i can get an A in anything. whats going on?

and i havent talked to anyone. it kills me. i want to interact with people.  this musical is so horrible right now. i finally get to see rachael, but we dont have any space to talk. i dont get home til around 530 and from there its shower homework sleep. i hate school. 
and i finally got to see matt. that made my week. seriously. ive just been feeling so down lately. ::) matttttt
i hate embarrasing matt in this thing, but hes so great. people like him come one in a million. he makes me so happy. only a few people make me feel the way he does. thanks matt. youre what ive been waiting for. 
anyways. time to do stupid english. late start tomorrow ;-)"

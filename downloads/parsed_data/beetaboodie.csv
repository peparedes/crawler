"event","I absolutely love it here in Germany!! IT is SOOO Good to be a family again and have Chris here with me.  Our apt. is really nice, 3 bedroom, living room, dinnette, kitchen, big bathroom.  We have several families around our age and with kids close in age so it makes the evenings and weekends enjoyable, and i never have to be alone while chris is away periodically.  I am really really happy here :)  Also, relaly really happy to finally have the internet up and running.  only took them two months to hook it up!  GOt my european license...all that fun stuff...point of interest...i may be dumb, but i thought every country over ehre drove on the wrong side of the road, but this is false.  only britian does that.  we here in germany actually drive on the proper side of the road.  makes it much less intimidating as this is my first week of being able todrive here.  I passed my test on the first try so i am happy about that :)  hope all is well for everyone else. 
love ya!"

"event","I hate waiting. I've been waiting for almost 9 months now. Its a good thing  I wasn't pregnant when chris left, hehe, it would probobly be miserable now if he had. But hopefully I will be there soon. He got my package with the paperwork, so hooray.
24 days left in the countdown. supposedly, again i'm not holding my breath. But it sure would be nice.  It puts me leaving around June 4th. Which is sorta funny/sad. That is my parents anniversary, and not only that, they are busy with plans that whole day that they can't get out of, so if I do leave that day I will have to find other means to get to the airport. haha. My mom said that would make for an anniversary she would never forget, and perhaps not in a good way. They are spending the whole day proctoring for a big test downtown chicago. So that's cool for them. But chris said that perhaps it could be less than the 30 days, so maybe like May 28th or something. I would love to be gone by the end of this month. That would be great. :)
Ashley is walking all over the place now. she is a menace. HAHA.  She can climb on everything and she mimics us when she is doing thing. It is so cute. And all of a sudden she has turned into a momma's girl. She comes to sit in my lap every chance she gets, which i love because she isn't usually up for long bouts of affection. She is a short and sweet kinda girl. ha. But she has been all over sitting in my lap and having me read to her, and I am more than happy to oblige. So I guess, all things considered, things are going fairly well here. 
I hope all is where for everyone elsewhere."

"event","Ashley was up early this morning. Ugh, tired.
I found out yesterday that because Chris has an APO address, it doesn't cost anymore to express mail things to him there as it did here. So that is cool. I expressed the paperwork I have been trying to fax to him over because the fax numbers for him aren't working. It is sad that overseas mail is faster than the fax i've been trying to send. lol. Oh well. I should get there just before he leaves for 2 weeks, so this is good cause he can turn it in before he leaves and then it will be processing while he is away and perhaps soon after his return Ashley and i will join him. 
Tiff, his sister, is coming to visit us this summer and we've been joking that it's taking so long she might as well just hop on the same flight over as me. That would actaully be nice, not flying alone with a one year old overseas. Plus, then Chris and I would have help unpacking and all kinds of stuff like that. So that would be cool. 
I got a dvd burner and installed it the other day, and my computer is screwing up which drive is which as I have a cd drive as well. So i had it open and was looking at stuff inside, turned my back, and my cat chewed through the cables. stupid stupid cat...lol
Well, Ash is done with breakfast. Later :)"

"event","Yes, still in the states, while Chris is off gallivanting in Germany.  Actually, he's working really hard and putting in a lot of hours.  Which also means not much time for me. But there hasn't been much of that in several months.  It's getting pretty lonely here. 
I'm sorta fed up with the whole situation.  It is now going to be at least another month and prolly more than that before I get over to Germany. So as I had been anticipating leaving a month ago already, I no longer have my car, I am stuck living with my parents, and I have no life other than playing mommy all day and night, and for anyone out there who is a mother, you know how taxing that can be.
I love my little girl though. She is so beautiful and smart and entertaining.  She had her very first birthday not too long ago. Sadly, Chris was unable to attend as he is out of the country.  
You know what is really just sad? We were only married for 10 months when Chris left. In July we will have been married for 20 months. He has been gone for 50% of our marriage.  This sucks royally. 
I am so sick of making everyone think that this is perfectly fine with me, that each time plans change and my departure date gets set further and further back i am unaffected, when in all actuality, i'm going crazy. I hate that I am married and yet, spend every single night alone in my bed. I hate that I spend my entire day alone, with only my one year old child for company. I hate that I barely get 5 minutes on the phone with Chris anytime I call him, and that's only once or twice a week (previously once or twice a month---that SUCKED) and when i do get to talk to him, he is usually exhausted and not much of a conversationalist. I hate this. I hate everything about it. and the thing i hate most of all is there is not a f*cking thing i can do about any of it. All I can do is sit here hating it. I hate that more than anything.
Yes, this is a terrible mood, and if you don't like it I suggest you go elsewhere for your reading material, because I spend all day long making everyone think that I am just fabulous, and I refuse to do that here.  This is my outlet for all of my irate uncontrollable rage at my current situation for which not many could truly understand or appreciate. 
I am a married woman acting as a single mother. This sucks. I don't even have friends to hang out with so I have virtually no social life.  The outings I do get consist of going grocery shopping and sometimes going out to dinner with my parents. 
blah."

"event","Well, It's been almost a month since Chris left for basic.  I miss him a lot.  It's been good receiving letters from him.  It's as if we are falling in love all over again.  I can't believe we are coming up on our one year anniversiary.  So much has happened and changed in the last year.  More than i could possibly put into words.  
I know that i love him with all of my heart.  I try and keep things in perspective because I do know he is different now,even from the man that I married, and that he honestly wants to make things work for us.  I don't know, sometimes it's hard to keep focus when he is gone and my mind is left to wander.  Thats part of what i love so much about his letters.  They bring me back to the present, and the man that I love, and I miss so very much.  A little over a month and I will get to see him for a day or two.  
I know it would be awesome for him to be able to see Ashley at that time as well, but I can't travel alone with her right now.  That would be more stress than I can deal with on top of trying to spend precious little quality time with him.  We need a day to just be together, away from the world.  
I went up to Great Lakes yeseterday and actaully got my very first military ID.  I had plenty of friends who had them when i lived in North Carolina and I sure as hell never dreamed that I would ever have my own.  It was really weird looking at it, with my name on it.  But I felt different than i thought i would.  I was actaully proud to have it.  Proud that my husband is doing this, and that I get to be around to support and encourage him.  
But for now, I hate that I am the only one in our queen size bed everynight, and that I wake up to an empty bed every morning.  And that my soulmate is so far away that my daily thoughts must be kept to myself.  I haven't even had a meaningful hug in a month.  yeah, friends hug, but there is nothing more intimate and special than a loving hug from your soulmate, your husband, your lover, your best friend.  All of those things rolled into one man.  
I miss him so much.  But I've almost made it through another week.  It's the weekends that are hard on me.  I have a schedule during the week.  No one is home during the day.  It's just me and Ahsley and no one else.  On the weekends, my schedule flies out the window, my parents are home all weekend (I am living with them so that Ash and I aren't alone while Chris is gone) and the time seems to crawl when my schedule isn't followed.  I know, i'm ocd, i fully admit that.  But there it is. I dread the weekends and here one looms.  The only good thing is that Chris gets to call for 10 minutes every Sunday morning.  That is the only thing that gets me through.  I love that I get to hear his voice, if only for a few minutes.  I'll take that over nothing at all.  
It's sad how much he is missing while he is away.  Ashley is just about to be ready to crawl. She is gonna be 7 months old soon.  I can't hardly believe that much time has gone by.  He won't be home for our very first wedding anniversiary.  So that sucks royally.
But, right on schedule, Ashley has arisen, and is ready for some cereal and veggies, so off I go."

"event","Memorial Day was a very sad day for me.  My very dear friend Leah delivered her baby boy, Luke Nathaniel, at 1:28 am.  He was 4 pounds 14 ounces and only 16 inches in length.  He fought for every breath he took, adn took his last at 5:31 am that same day.  We had all hoped the outcome would be different, but that was what God had planned, so that is what took place.  I can't imagine how Leah could go for the majority of her pregnancy knowing that there was a 99% chance that her child would not survive in this world.  The only reason he survived in  her womb was that her body was providing the necessary functions that his body could not.
It was a blessing however, when she delivered.  She had been told he would not be able to cry because of his lack of lung development, and yet, as he came out, he definitely made it known that he was in the room. I'm glad that she got to hear him cry and that she and her husband and their other son were able to spend a few precious hours with Luke before he passed on to the Lord's hands where he will be forever cradled in a perfectly heavenly body without any of the pain and suffering of this world."

"event","So i was at my college graduation with all of my old school buddies.  I was totally excited to see them ane kept running around saying hi to them.  None of them would say hi back, they wouldn't even acknowledge me because i didn't graduate.  So I left and went home. 
Once at home Chris told me that a bunch of his buddies were coming over and all of a sudden i wasn't wearing pants and i had to go into the bedroom but i couldn't decide on pants.  Well finally i picked a pair (can't remember which)and his friends came over.  somehow after goofing off for a while we ended up at some old ladies house.  no idea who she was.  but we all sat down to dinner there, after i used the restroom for some reason.  don't know why i remember that.  but anyway, at this point i realize that i have 2 children, not just 1.  And i'm trying to figure out how ashley went from 6 weeks to toddler in such a short amount of time and i have no idea how i ended up with another.  i kept asking people and trying to explain to them that not enough time had passed for this to be possible, that i couldn't even remember being pregnant, and i had no new date for a birthday, just ashley's at march 23.  then they were all mad that i didn't remmeber my new child's birthday.  SO i dropped it but it perplexed me the whole dream. oh, for some reason at this point my dad was there. 
Well then we decided to go for a ridein a horse carriage.  it had 4 seats and there were 4 of us.  chris and i in the back seat, but we weren't together, i was trying to get with him.  well on the way we picked up two girls .  they were both sitting on the driver and flirting with all 3 guys that were in there.  (somehow at this point the open buggie's convertable top went up and it was an enclosed vehicle.  Well I kept trying to keep chris's attention and he finally put his arm around me.  I dont' knwo where we were going but we invited the 2 girls who declined due to a basketball game that we had to turn around to get them to.  (even though at this point they jumped out and left.)  So we are turning around and the driver crashes into something.  we unhook the horse adn are trying to fix it, but then everything goes nuts and ashley is screaming over and over ""i want mommy, i want mommy"" even though i'm holding her, so i hand her to daddy, and then i see griswold (our cat) who somehow i just now in my dream realize that he's been with us and allowed to run all over outside and has since turned ferrel.  So i try and catch him and hold him and over and over someone is saying ""there's the puppy, there;s the puppy"" and holding a stuffed animal that i recently sold in a garage sale that has puppies.  and over the top of all of this is some kid in the backgriound from south park saying over and over ""simpsons did it, simpsons did it"" as i recently watched that episode in real life.  so we grabbed the kids and the cat, got the horse back onto the buggie and got back in and away we went.
Then...consciousness....
really weird. still cant get ""simpsons did it, simpsons did it"" out of my head. really annoying little kid voice"

"event","Why Women are Crabby: 

We start to ""bud"" in our blouses at 9 or 10 years old only to find anything that comes in contact with those tender, blooming buds hurts so bad it brings us to tears. Enter the almighty, uncomfortable training bra contraption the boys in school will snap until we have calluses on our backs.

Next, we get our periods in our early to mid-teens (or sooner). Along with those budding boobs, we now bloat, we cramp, we get the hormone crankies, have to wear little mattresses between our legs or insert tubular, packed cotton rods in places we didn't even know we had. 

Our next little rite of passage is having sex for the first time which is about as much fun as having a ramrod push your uterus through your nostrils (IF he did it right and didn't end up with his little cart before his horse), leaving us to wonder what all the fuss was about.

Then it's off to Motherhood where we learn to live on dry crackers and water for a few months so we don't spend the entire day leaning over Brother John. Of course, amazing creatures that we are (and we are), we learn to live with the growing little angels inside us steadily kicking our innards night and day making us wonder if we're having Rosemary's Baby. Our once flat bellies now look like we swallowed a watermelon whole and we pee our pants every time we sneeze.

When the big moment arrives, the dam in our blessed Nether Regions will invariably burst right in the middle of the mall and we'll waddle with our big cartoon feet moaning in pain all the way to the ER. Then it's huff and puff and beg to die while the OB says, ""Please stop screaming, Mrs. Hear me roar. Calm down and push. Just one more (or 10) good push,"" warranting a strong, well deserved impulse to punch the bastard (and hubby) square in the nose for making us cram a wiggling, mushroom-headed 10 lb. bowling ball through a keyhole.

After that, it's time to raise thosemangels only to find that when all that ""cute"" wears off, the beautiful little darlings morph into walking, jabbering, wet, gooey, snot-blowing, life-sucking little poop machines.

The teen years. Need I say more? The kids are almost grown now and we women hit our voracious sexual prime in our mid-30's to early 40's while hubby had his somewhere around his 18th birthday (which just happens to be the reason all that early hot man sex got you pregnant in the first place).

Now we hit the grand finale: ""The Menopause,"" the Grandmother of all womanhood. It's either take the HRT and chance cancer in those now seasoned ""buds"" or the aforementioned Nether Regions, or, sweat like a hog in July, wash your sheets and pillowcases daily and bite the head off anything that moves.

Now, you ask WHY women seem to be more spiteful than men when men get off so easy INCLUDING the icing on life's cake: Being able to pee in the woods without soaking their socks...

Now I love being a woman but ""Womanhood"" would make the Great Ghandi a tad crabby. Women are the ""weaker sex""? Yeah right. Bite me."

I thought the manicure i started out with was gonna be the highlight of the evening. it was leah's birthday last week and she didnt' want to go to the salon alone, so she offered to take me as well.  Then we both decided to do pedicures as well.  They have a big chair you sit in and instead of footrests it has pools for yoru feet that are filled with hot sudsy water and have jets massaging your feet.  meanwhile the chair itself is heated and is a massager and you have the control to make it do pretty much whatever you want on your back.  Then they actually massage your feet and your calves.  They also do all the main stuff on your toenails that they would on yoru fingernails (such as oils, filing, polishing, and so on...)  That has got to be the most relaxing thing.  I wish we could have gotten our hair done as well :)  Oh it was wonderful

And then went out shopping with my mom cause i don't have a car currently, as i mention often because i want my car back!  But i had to get a sewing needle to fix a pair of pants for Chris. 

It's almost my bedtime, but i hate being home alone (Ashley doesn't count as company in terms of nighttime home aloneness, she's too little to be a comfort if something happens, like the domestic dispute outside last night.)  Chris is working overtime tonight so i'm alone till like 2 or 3.  don't remember which.  just know it will be WAY past my bedtime.

So Trixie, our female, went into heat like 2 weeks ago, so we kept her locked up in the only room that the door actaully latches in.  Last week we finally let her out and 'lo and behold, the damn cat went into heat again yesterday.  It wouldn't be so bad except we actually have to go in that room cause it's the nursery. So we have to fight them to keep the two cats apart each time we have to change Ashley.  Damn cats.  But Grizzy is being cute this morning, so he's okay.  Trixie is doing nothing but howling and it's annoying.

I actually got to sleep last night.  Sleep is good.  I had to get up around 4, but that was it.  It has been a couple nights in a row like that so i'm hoping to keep that up.

"event","Yesterday was a very blah day.  Probobly one of the most blah days i've had since the first few days that i got home from the hospital.  Those were really bad though. hehe.  I was an emotional wreck for a few days and i don't think my husband always fully understands what to do when I am in a state like that. Oh well.  He was pretty good last night.  Sometimes I just need a hug, and he's not a very ""hug"" type person.  It was just a very not feeling attractive at all day yesterday.  I'm still trying to get back to my old size, actually smaller than, but also my hormones are still way out of wack so my face is still completely gross.  Such is life i suppose.  None of any of it is any real big deal, but compound it with lack of sleep and there you have it....a blah day.  

Today has been a bit better however.  It's pretty out and sunny, and even though Chris really doesn't get it, I very much enjoy going out to even just the store with him.  it makes for two things...  1. getting me out of the house for a bit since i can't go out the rest of the day with him having the car. and 2. i get to spend time with him, even though it is just the store, it's a big deal to me cause i don't get to spend much time with him away from the apt. just the two of us.  we always go with people or to his or my family. it's never just the two of us.  But we went shopping together this morning and I always enjoy that, even if it does drive him up the wall.  :)  Tough nuggets for him.  sometimes you gotta deal with it to keep the wife happy which in turn keeps the peace. hehe.

Well, I'm gonna take advantage of the fact that Ashley is actually sleeping and do some cleaning since I didn't get to yesterday cause she was up all day.  (by teh way, cleaning is one of my fave things to do...i know, i'm weird.) it's not so much the cleaning as it is having a clean environment when i get done.  :)
Peace out."

"event","i wrote an entry earlier today and it didn't post it, not sure what the deal is with that.  oh well.  i spose it happens.  anywho. Now i really don't have much to say cause i said what i wanted to say in my other entry, other than i'm 22, married, and am expecting a little girl to pop out at any minute and i really wish she would get a move on that :)  I am so beyond ready to be done being pregnant. hehe.  i guess that's pretty much it for now other than that i hope it is warm outside cause i guarantee my shoes are not going to wrap around my hugely swollen feet today.  must wear sandals.  lol.  have a good one.

"event","Hello.  this is my journal.  not really sure what to put in here since i haven't had a journal like this since i was in high school.  that seems like a long time ago even though i graduated just back in 2000.  much has changed since then.  I'm married to a wonderful guy named Chris and we are expecting a baby girl ANY DAY NOW! i'm so ready for her to get out. lol.  Anyway, that's about all i feel like typing at the moment.

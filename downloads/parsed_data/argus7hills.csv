"event","My work totally stinks. I got promoted recently and I have to say that I never realized how stupid the people I work with were until I became a supervisor. Its a mean thing to say but oh so true. People who ahev worked there 10 years doing the same thing all of a sudden developed a case of alsheimers (sp?). The questions are brutal and totally distract me from work I should be doing. 

This is an actually conversation I had with someone today. They were sent to pick poly bags to label, put individual parts into and seal. 
The person: I got the bags do you want me to put the parts into them?
Me: Yes that would be very helpful
The person: how to do I tell what parts go in the bags I label
Me: Pick up one of the bulk part bags do they have a part number on them?
The person: :Picking up a bag and looking at it: Yes
The person: Once I put the parts in the bag do I seal them?
At this point I am starting to get a little annoyed I say no leave them unsealed we want them to come out of the bags and go into the bottom of the box after you pack them.
The person: looks at me blankly satisfied it seems with the answer
Me: no seriously you need to seal them

These conversations happen all day pretty much every day. I have 3 people I consider reliable and the other 4 are useless. One is actually gone because she cant physically do the job and is being moved back to a sit down position. 2 are college students related to higher ups in the company (one of which is the einstein from above) and both dont care. The last of my basically worthless people goes to church with the owner of the company and his wife and is a pet project of hers. So 3 of the 4 are untouchable and I cant really do anything with them. Ah gotta love nepotism :)"

I had kinda lost touch with fatal renegade and it was nice to see her again and spend some quality time together. Alot of people I hadnt seen in a long time showed up this weekend. Too many to get into but maybe I will write more later. I have got to get out of the funk work has put me in."

Been so busy lately havent been able to do much of anything but sleep, work and have my weekend fly by. Havent been able to play Btech for several weeks. It's been so long I actually got an email from the guys asking me if they had pissed me off somehow and wondering what they had done to make me not goto the Tower for the last 5 weeks or so. I emailed them back and let them know I have been a little busy. More so than any recent time I can remember. I've had (in somewhat order) Demo at Dartmouth, Baronial birthday, wedding, Val's 2 grandmother's birthday parties, Crown and this weekend my 20 year high school reunion. Tonight Im going to Worcester to hang with my Buddy Kenny and my niece Alicia who is now 21. Man Im getting old (LOL)."

"event","Worked most of my off friday to save some money for my new computer and whamoo my car needs a ball joint and didnt pass inspection :(. Friday night I accidently erased the season premiere of Smallville so I did get to watch that :(

Saturday was a little better got up and after doing some minor cleaning decided I was going to go and play Btech. Ended up having a really cool session of our Solaris VII game. We were in a light Mech meatgrinder scenerio in Davion stadium. No ranged weapons just a Mace on a 20 ton Wasp. You used your piloting to attack with and if you missed you had to make a piloting role to stay on your feet. The Mace did 1 point of damage for every 4 tons of your mech. So simple math says 5 points per hit. To add a twist the GM also gave the Mech spikes on their legs there by eliminating alot kicking as the spikes would damage the person kick more than his target. Kinda weird but o.k. My stable or the stable I beling to (Montgomery Mashers) had 3 pilots in the match. It started with 7 Mech's all moving 6 9 6 walk, run, jump. I managed to club a mech down as another mech was performing a death from above. Started out pretty good hitting 3 out of my first 4 attacks while needing to roll three 10's and one 9. Took one hit in those first few rounds nothing major. Next 8 rounds I missed all my attacks including a roll where I needed a 7. I almost bought the farm in the 12th round when I tried for a death from above and missed. After getting up the next round 3 other mechs had me dead to rights. Bad rolls on their part saved me. After that I picked my spots and rolled about 50 percent hits. Thankfully I didnt miss a piloting roll. About the 20th round 4 Mech remained the 3 Mech's our mechwarriors piloted and one other Mech piloted by a Rock something. He was a skilled pilot and the battle in my mind was going to come down to him and Leo because Leo knew Mech Karate or something :). Basically he could mkae himself harder to hit by dodging. Alexius was the first to go down as he missed a Death from above and ruined par of his own Gyro and leg. Amazingly he stood up twice and ran twice but missed his second piloting roll for running and went down again. Stood again and tried jumping. Missed his piloting roll and cored his own mech. We later joked the Vid's used his mech running around at high tape speed and the Benny HIll song. Now down to three I managed to actually land a good shot on the Mech not affiliated with us. Leo who had recorded 3 kills did most of his damage with charge attacks. As I sat back and watched out of attack range in the 27th round Leo charged and the other mech raised it leg to counter kick. Both hit and both took fatal damage. Leo's mech was cored and the other mech lost a leg and was cored. I won by default (LOL.
We did some roleplaying after where a bunhc of the pilots and tech's went to a Scottish bar and started a bar fight. End results 2 pilots critically wounded broken arms, ribs and a broken leg. 2 Pilots out for 5 weeks and this is a real weekly time based game. I was fine however because I had taken Mary (stable owners secretary) out for a victory celebration dinner and we had a wonderful night. For all you sicko's interested I rolled a 33 on 2D10 open dice roll and scored (LOL)"

Got to See T'scot, his lovely lady and Wyette(sp?). Man they grow up so fast! The party was cool lots of kids running around and having fun. I enjoyed having to bench press Elliot about 100 times but man it gets tiring when another little boy wanted me to bench press him too. After about 20 times of 10-20 reps each I was dying lol. 

Patty made me this sweet shirt for my birthday but somewhere along the lines measurements got mixed up. She only had me as a 40 chest :). I am atleast 48 chest unexpanded. Well she did add 8 inches to the 40 and then 2 inches for in seem I think she called it. Needless to say it fit but was very form fitting. :) Val and she made comments about my nipples or something or other. I wont go into details. I still try to block it out mentally.

Friday Amy and Jenna came over to watch Star Gate SG1 and Atlantis we have saved on the DVR. They worked on some favors for the Baroness who is always short on them. It was nice to have people over on my off friday to hang out.

Sunday getting ready to drive to Dover for Curia and then maybe hit some books stores on our way back. Nice lazy weekend"

"event","Cant believe I have been out of High School for 20 years! Sad but true! Im gonna be going to my 20 year High School reunion Nov 11th down in Worcester and it feels weird. I almost feel like It was last sumer that I said good bye to people. It will be interesting to see everyone and see how they have changed and aged. It will be a chance to connect with people I havent seen in forever. I have to admit I did not really understand what graduation meant. I thought I would see everyone around and not lose touch with alot of people but I did.

Worked out today hour on the exercise bike for an hour today. 17.5 miles 807 calories burned. Gotta get back into doing that regularly. I have been doing a little lifting and only biking 1/2 hour 2 or 3 days a week. I need to stay on a full hour every day. I need new music for my MP3 player and someone else to goto the gym with. My music workout hour is starting to loss its effect after 3 months. Gotta get some new song maybe Gnarls Barkley, Natasha Benttingfield(sp), old school Outkast and some more R&B hip hop stuff.

Another thing affecting my workout is the new work schedule 9-80. 9 hours a day and every other friday off. The extra hour might not seem like alot but it has totally screwed my workout up. On a good note the lifting is starting to show a little in the neck, shoulders and arms. The thigh master as I like to call it is working a little too. Still gut has gone down but still not happy with it yet. I just have to keep telling myself I screwed my body for years and its not gonna come back over night."

"event","Got up while Val was still asleep (big surprise there :) ) and decided to go yard saleing. It was late for me probably 9 a.m. when I headed out. Drove around for a little bit and came up with some cool purchases. First place I stopped found a drinking horn for $2. It was in really good shape and I ended up giving it to Val so she could have one. The next place I stopped at I picked up some blue cloth napkins with trim on the end for use as feast napkin. Paid $1 for about 10-15 of them. Not sure how many exactly I just picked up the bunch and asked how much. Stopped at 2 other places and looked around and didnt find anything I liked. At the 5th place I found a queen size bed frame for $15. I am planning on getting some wooden cross boards and taking it with us camping so we dont ever have to be on the ground again. 

I looked at the time and noticed it was around 11:00 a.m. The guys would be at the Wizards tower getting ready to play Battletech. Made my way over there and pulled my dice out of the back of my car. They had already started to set up and I was happy to find out we were going to be playing the Solaris VII game. Get to play one of my favorite character ""Crackshot Phillip McCracken. I dont get to make it to all the gaming sessions because of the  weekend SCA camping thing so they quickly caught me up on what was going on. I and a tech named Spike (who I immediately started calling ""TECHIE"" had been taken on a transport to the nearby planet of New Kyoto? We were to help the stable owner Ted Montgomery inspect/review some investments he had made in the local manufacturing plant. As we landed he went off to the plant and told us he would call us when he needed us so we should enjoy a little free time and explore the city. I decided to buy a gift for Mary (the bosses secretary and a potential love interest) and Techie having nothing better to do decided to come along. I found her a gift and decided to grab something to eat. Techie hemmed and hawwed he didnt have that kinda money to spend he was only a tech and didnt get paid as well as I did. Translation: If you want me to come along. You have to pay. So we ended up at a surf and turf/japanese place where I spent some time trying to learn about Techie. Some guys overheard us talking about Mechs and such and joined the conversation. They were members of the planetary defense members of Husein Hotheads. The two guys names were Jake and Mark and they didnt give last names. I buy them a few drink and we eat and discuss thing. They try to be a little insulting to see if I will go for the bait I dont let them get to me and I shrug of their comments. Stuff about being a specialist and not a real Mech warrior. I ask about their service career and basically point out how pathetic it is but in a round about nice way. :) They get a call on their communicator about something. Its too low and muffled I cant understand it but the way they rush off it is apparent that something is wrong. 

I head back to the dropship with Techie and in route we find out that a jumpship entered a pirate point in the system and released a dropship that was coming in on a hard burn. We reach the dropship which is preparing for a lockdown. I grab some of my toys (laser pistol, sawed off shotgun)and give Techie my Auto Pistol. He says he knows how to use it. H says he has been through basic training (I later found out he lied). So we head out of the Dropship before lockdown and call Ted who wants us to meet him at the Plant. We manage to catch a cab and make it to the plant. The guards ofcourse take our weapons and techie makes a smart comment about what a waste of time it was for us to have gone and got them. I say back to him. I would rather have my weapons here then 40 minutes away on a lockdowned dropship Einstein.

Even at a hard burn the pirate point has whoever is coming 6-8 hours away. Ted brings Techie and I into a Mech bay where some personell are working on a design I had never seen before. He has Techie inspect it and has me run throught the design spec's also. He says he had hoped to run some mock battles with me as pilot but it looks like it might be the real thing instead. He says it is upto me if I want to go out the untested design. After techie ensures me it is relatively safe I decide to go out and help the planetary defenders. The Mech is at the heavier end of the medium class weighting 55 tons. It has 4 medium lasers for close in fire power and a large laser backed by two LRM5's for punching power at a distance. With a movement rate of 5 and run of 8 and good armor for a mech its size it is a solid all around design (basically a lineholder for those of you who know Battletech). 

So I go out and join the local militia and the Merc's. My buddy Jake is piloting one of the Merc mechs. What a surprise! :). We have 4 Mech's, 3 tanks and 2 squad of infantry. The attackers have 5 Mech's all light weight. I think it should be fun picking them apart. Then we find out they are the Heartbreakers from Beta company of beta galaxy of Wolf Dragoon's. One of the Mech a Valkyrie is a LAM! For those of you unfamiliar with Battltech these guys are almost godlike and their equipment is far better than ours. LAM stands for Land Air Mech which means it can kinda transform and be a plane or Mech or a mix of both. After some bloody fighting in which we lose 2 mechs and 2 tanks we manage to inflict enough damage to drive them off. (to be honest there was a very small chance we could have won. Our two remaining Mech had already taken rear armor damage where Critical hits were possible. The remaining Tank couldnt move and had short range weapons. The attackers could have stood off and picked it apart. The infantry was hidden all game and hadnt done anything. On my best shots I needed to roll 9-10-11-12 all night on 2d6 to hit. If he would have pressed the attack he would have wiped the players out.) I asked for a general recall order after our 2nd tank and 2nd Mech died in the same round. Just playing the game the way it should be you lose half your forces without taking down one enemy machine that can be considered a rout. Still it was alot of fun even if he had to roll lower than a 4 or 5 to hit most times and that with the enemy moving around at maximum movement every round. They were 0 or 1 gunners :(. I really enjoy the roleplaying 

Left early around 10:30 at night and came home. Gotta get ready for Pats and Hooter wings today! (sunday)"

Got completely blindsided by the whole Millstone thing! (good job keeping the secret guys I had no clue! Ofcourse this does mean I owe you all now :) ) Awesome Job by Roberts on the scroll. It was beautiful and he has a PIC of it on his live journal.

Only draw back was my buddy Kenny coming upto the event and getting snookered and being a little rude with comments and attitude. While he wasnt too bad he definitely made me a little uncomfortable. George and Ryan were cool though. Ryan actually came to Bardic with me and seemed to enjoy himself alot. George was there more for the fighting and was kinda bored when the rain canceled it all. 

Usually Harpers is the start of a slower SCA schedule til spring but not this year. Val who is the keeper of the schedule says Sept is a full month of events. Even days free of events are filled with Birthday parties and wedding and such.

Quote(s) of HARPERS for me: (SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO CALL MOTHRA...), (WOW I HAVE A SET OF BOOK ENDS!),  (KENNY YOUR NOT IN EXILE) (YOU OWE ME A BILLION GAZILLION DOLLARS!)"

Went to Craftnite tonight and saw Kythe and the family! Morgan is so big and cute! Spent some time with some new kids interested in the SCA. They are 15- 16ish and would be a good addition to the Youth fighting program on thier way to the heavy list field.

Fighting was awesome as we won the war! Also Stoneamrche fielded 9 fighters in the field battle and joined with Carolingia and together we had a force of over 20 fighters! The highlight of the field battle was helping Matty D when he was being assaulted by the King of the Midrealm and a few retainers. Stonemarche killed the king and his retainers and saved Lucan's standard bearer!

Got to hang out with my home girl fatalrenegade most of the week and got to see parts of Pennsic and into parties I never knew existed! Pennsic is just that damn big!

Called Kythe to see if he wanted to go and found out he was having brunch with Gunn and Kairn. He said he couldnt goto the Fleamarket but invited me to come over for brunch. I said sure and got there around 11:30ish. Had a good brunch with fresh fruit, homemade coffee cak, and two egg dishes. Yummy! They asked if I wanted to hang out and go swimming and I said sure. Had to borrow a pair of Marks Swim trunks which actually fit me :) The water was awesome and the eye candy wasnt that bad :). Had fun coming out of the water and scarring Justin (With a little help from Kythe). Also Morgan seemed to love the water. Then I went home and watched my Sharpe movie and vegged. All in all it was a good day."

"event","Today was a pretty boring day. Got up, went to work and came home after my workout. Got to start putting my ideas down and into action about updating the Stonemarche Chatelaine. Talked to Eadric about putting some easier to find info on the Stonemarche websight. 

Just found out that BBC is indeed going to have another Sharpe 2 hour movie saturday and I am more psyched than I probably should be. They are starting to affect my brain! I will be doing something at work and all of a sudden I will start humming the song they open with and end with! The over the hill and through the main(sp?) thingy. (LOL)

Spent an hour or so looking up Argyrus and Yeomen stuff on the web. Came up with some cool stuff I am going to put together and show to the Baron and Thaddeus.

Well thats all for now"

"event","Didnt feel good all sunday. Not so much sick but just worn out? Went to work today and seemed to be doing fine. Again no sick just a little worn down. Did my daily hour workout today which seemed to go fine. On the way home I had to pull over cause I felt sick. Actually hurled twice in a parking lot. Nothing solid just the Peach flavored water I had while working out. Now Im not keen on Peach flavor. Grabbed it by mistake when I was buying the flavored water. Might have just been that but its several days now I have felt off? Seem to be getting enough sleep? If it persist I might have to go see the doctor.
What the hell is wrong with me? (LOL)

"event","Got up in the morning feeling o.k. and made some eggs for breakfast. Not sure if they were the ones left over from GNEW but they didnt sit well with me. I wasnt feeling very good by noon time so I didnt go anywhere or do anything. Just set the DVR to tape a bunch of shows for me and then watched the movie Ultra Violet (Yummy Mila!). I am suppose to goto Thaddeus's today to fix the metal legs my friend George gave me. I will call him around 8:30-9:00 a.m. and see if he is still up for it.

"event","Had a nice lazy friday off. For those who dont know my work went to the 9-80 system which basically works out to me getting every other friday off. Great idea, wonderful in theory but crappy in timing. None of my Fridays off matched up with any events that I had to drive long distance to (GNEW), (Glen Lynn), (Panteria). Maybe better luck next year? Back to my lazy friday off....

Didnt really do much all day although the house did need to be cleaned. Picked up a little but for the most part napped and got caught up on T.V shows I had taped during the week with the DVR. Sped through the South Park, Family guy and Benny Hill episodes looking for ones I had missed or ones I wanted to see again. Watched Blade: the series and have to say I really like what they are doing with that show. Finished two of the Sharpe episodes we have taped from BBCA. For thoses who dont know it is a series set in early 1800's when the english were driving Napoleon out of Spain. Sean Bean stars in it as Major Sharpe, leader of a squad of riflemen called the chosen ones. He has a Captain Kirk kinda thing going on where he has a new love interest every week (LOL). 

Got my butt in gear around 6:00 and started to get ready for Curia at 7:30. One of my wonderful children (cats) knocked my electric razor off the sink board and ruined the flimsy metal covers for one of the blades. Thing is a piece of cap anyways! Its a Remington and it doesnt do a very good job and is louder than a Barber sheers. BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGG

So anyways, got to Curia and we had a good meeting. Got elected Chatelaine and now have to start putting some of my plans into action :). 

til next time

"event","Greetings all,
Went to fighter practice in Concord yesterday and had a really good time! Got to see Sean, Cathal and a couple others for the first time in a while. Got some sugar from Moria (inside joke) :). We actually had about 9 guys. Sean, Ulfarr, Moria, Cathal, Dave, Bob, T-scot, and the other Dave and myself. Plus Damien and Drefen stopped by. The weather was actually pretty nice and we had shade.

I need to repair my armor as it is starting to show the signs of being fought in alot. My body harness is to big for me now which is a good thing (losing poundage) but also a bad thing as it tears apart the cording holding it together. Blew an elbow strap out at the last GNEW battle and need to get that fixed. I will probably do that tonight at Kythes. Going to Thaddeus's sunday and hopefully I will be able get rid of my plastic legs and into the metal ones George gave me :)

"event","GNEW (Great North Eastern War) was this weekend and I had a great time despite the heat. Enjoyed hanging with my home girl Kara (sp?) all weekend. Getting to watch Damien get Squired was great. He's a good guy who deserved it! Visiting with Kythe and the family was a special treat(baby Morgan is so cute and Justin can stick his head under water now!). As always hanging with Eadric and Eydis was fun too. Got to see Moria and Ulfarr for the first time in a while.

Fighting was awesome as usual. Regardless of the odds I always enjoy going out and fighting with the rest of the Yeomen of Stonemarche! Lead by our inspirational Captian Thaddeus and our most beloved Baron Xavier the fighters, combat archer and Siege team of the Yeomen fought bravely and as a team. Special thanks to Sir Artos and Master Gwen for fighting with us.  

Work is still work and I dont need to go into details about it :)
Well thats it for now so I will try and write again soon
Ya right

"event","This past weekend was alot of fun. I got to play B-tech with the guys saturday night before coming home to find a house for of other friends waiting for me. We play the game A**hole for a bit and caught up on things. We also watched a spoof movie about AD&D players called the gamers. If you havent seen it I highly recommend it to anyone who has gamed. Sunday I spent part of the day playing AD&D with the guys who came up from Worcester which is always alot of fun. I was suppose to goto fighter practice but with the wife off working sunday and a house full of friends I wasnt going anywhere :)

I will probably be going to NY this weekend for an SCA event called Bears Tavern. It was alot of fun last year so I ma sure it will be a blast this year. I will miss Battletech saturday which will be a bummer. I have really enjoyed playing again and getting to know some new friends. Oh well cant be in two places at once and I guess to much of any one thing is not good for you.

Will write again soon"

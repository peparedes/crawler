"event","Whilst shopping last night, my house mate informed me that she will be moving out.  I tried very hard to contain my self and NOT have a party in that very isle.  Don't get me wrong, I love her to death, but we will stay friends for much longer if we don't live together.

So now's the exciting part!  New housemate.  This is a new concept for me since Dayna was always going to be my first housemate - I'm looking forward to it.  My uncle is going to put some notices up at his work (Bunnings) and at his old work.  And guess what his old work is???  He used to be a detective and he said he will put one up in the 'POLICE ONLY' part of the station - can you imagine??  My very own policeman.  I'm nearly going to pass out at the thought.  And my chance of a young hottie is greatly increased by the town I live in - we're a popular destination for new recruits!!  That would be soo fab!

My brother is getting a new puppy tomorrow - a Staffy.  It'll be soo cute.  His name is Bruno which is definitely suitable.  Staffy's make me think of the mafia and so does the name Bruno.  Cam better pray that it doesn't eat mum's leather couch, though.  She will not be pleased.

I've got a relaxing weekend planned - some gardening tomorrow and the local football Grand Final on Sunday.  I have a wager on the Grand Final so hopefully my team wins.  If the Hoppers win, I get 3mths of Empire magazine bought for me.  If the Bulldogs win, I've gotta kiss my mate's cheek.  I know, I'm prostituting myself for a bet!  Should be a good game though."

"event","I made the first move on a guy for the second time this year.  Might not seem a lot to most people but it's a huge thing for me.  When it comes to guys I've been a firm believer in them making the first move.  BUT I'm sick of being single - it's as simple as that.  I'm not looking for marriage or anything like that.  I just want a nice guy.  So I decided I better start working for it.

I've also decided to do more.  I don't think I do enough.  So, I've been accepting any invites that come my way.  I want to expand my circle of friends.  The ones I have currently don't really go out that much.  And the ones that do, live in Melbourne or Sydney (which doesn't help when I decide on Sat afternoon that I want to go out that night).  I'm young, I don't have any ties, this is my time.  I've gotta make the most of it."

"event","Holy crap!  It's been like a year and a half since I've written in this baby - I'm so very bad.

Let's see, what have I been up to?  Working my butt off.  I work at Myers now, in music.  I like working in the area and I like the people I work with but I hate the hours - no normal hours there!  Especially at sales - 7am might work in the city where people actually shop at that time but in the country NOBODY shops at that time so we just stand there for 2 hours until they turn up.  Stupid national rules.  Anyhow, I'm working at tax for 8hrs a day during the week and at Myers on the weekends only.  It's a new development in the last couple of weeks and it means I might actually be able to plan things a little.  The extended hours at tax are only temporary but there is a possibility of something a little more permanent at the end of it (a couple of months).  If I ever get permanency, I'll drop Myer like a hot potato - it's just way too exhausting!! 

I bought a house this year for my birthday - that was way exciting!  I've been wanting to do some renovations to it but the weather is preventing it at the moment.  Well, in truth I could do it but it's too bloody cold!  Speaking of which, I've been a little sick this last week - most horrible cough.  So I've been having the puffer on at night and it's so funny cause the moisture means I have to get up in the morning and mop my walls!!  

I'm a bit obsessed with Super Nintendos right now.  To me, they were always the best games.  I never really got into the 3D type games, I like the 2D ones better and the Super Nintendo is just right.  So I'm going Ebay mad to find the right package.

I'm currently sharing a pack of Salt & Vinegar Rice Snax with my dog.  They are totally yummy!  And he is so cute!

If you're wondering about my choice of current music it's cause my car got broken in about a month ago and the bastards took my CDs which were in the car (that's all they got though).  Too bad for them cause they pretty much consisted of albums I hardly think thieves would like - Hanson, Taxiride, Ultra. That last one might be hard to replace though.  Anyhow, it got me back into the Hanson mood and, wah-lah.

Ciao!

Megan.

PS.  Emma, waiting patiently for the whole conference update!  Saw James on Rove as well - he was great.  I love the fact that he's been on nicotine patches for 5 years.  And that he thinks Rove is funnier than Letterman.  And that he wanted to dive headfirst into the M&Ms!!  Funny funny man."

Anyhow, today I worked for my friend, Kel, who's a florist.  Being Valentine's Day tomorrow and all, I spent my day on the main street in a booth (nicknamed the 'Kissing Booth' cause that's what it looks like) selling teddies to the deeply in love.  It was VERY hot & humid but it was great.  It just brought a smile to my face to see all these people in love, to see women of all ages looking wistfully at what I was selling in the hope that maybe they'd get something like that tomorrow, and to see men ummming and ahhhing over what to get.  It's just totally cute!!  I'm working again tomorrow which is good and a change from my other job.  

Wishing you all a very Happy Valentines Day!!"

"event","I FINALLY saw Sneak play again. YAY!!!!!  Taxiride came to Albury again - they actually started their new tour here.  I think that's pretty cool.  They really like it here.  Jase said he comes down here buying bargain instruments all the time.  I reckon it's cause they got flashed so many times last time they were here.

But back to the point.  I wasn't even going to go cause I have to get up at 5.30am and blah, blah, blah.  Anyhow, my brother was going so he went to get the tickets and saw that the support band was Sneak.  So, he rings me up and I'm like...well, I used many swear words.  But I couldn't see myself surviving work after such a late night.  I rang back 5 minutes later and told him to get me a ticket.

Sneak rocked!  Not that I expected any less.  I hope they weren't put off by the crowd - they were a little stand-offish but I screamed for the guys so hopefully it helped.  I even went up to Andrew and asked for a bit of ""Everything is Green"" and he did me a bit of an acoustic version which was sweet of him.  They didn't have the gear or something to do a complete version but, HELL, I was happy!! :) 

Taxiride were fab.  They rocked the place down.  I had a great time.  Rocked along at a distance.  Didn't feel real comfy up the front by myself.  Of course, if I was with any of you girls (you know who you are) we would have knocked those psychos in the front out and had the time of our lives.  

So, had a great night.  And somehow actually converted 2 boys into Sneak and Taxiride fans.  That's right, my brother is now officially a Sneak and Taxiride fan.  In his words ""They sound so different live"".  And his mate, Bluey, asked to borrow my albums of both bands.  My task is complete."

"event","Well, here it is, as promised, if not a little late.  A bit of a look into my trip to New Zealand.  Maybe I could call it, ""The Tale of the Two Towers""?  Okay, here goes.

Okay, so I picked up Cam (my brother) from work, got him dressed & cleaned & into the car so we left for Melbourne about 1pm.  When we arrived we dropped his ute off at a security parking place & were then shuttled off to the international terminal.  We weren't really there for long, well it didn't seem long anyhow.  Pretty much just enough time for a quick change, a quick meal, a quick window shop, & money changing.  When the lady at the checkout desk found out why we were going she freaked!  She couldn't believe it!  Then again, neither could I!  We went through customs, checked out a few more duty free shops & sat down to wait at our gate.  Anyhow, we boarded the plane soon after & this man goes to me ""Did you win the LOTR competition, too?"" and I'm like ""Yeah"".  He knew cause I was carrying around this Express Mail package (containing all necessary info) like it was my own precious, which he had also received.  That was Pete & he & his daughter Sophie were simply nice & that's who we chilled out with most of the time.

We arrived in Wellington, NZ, in a cloak of darkness at about 12.30am.  We got a ""limo"" (funny how they look like shuttle buses in NZ) to the hotel which was pretty swish - bathrobes, room service, huge shower, pay tv...  And the brekky was delicious.  Worth about $27 (but we got it free) it was a buffet of cereal, fruit, juice, yoghurt, bacon, eggs, toast, muffins & danishes.  YUMMO!

On the Wednesday (the day of the PREMIERE) we checked out how we were going to get to the theatre (it was only a few blocks away), checked out a few shops & had lunch.  Then I had to start getting ready - it was a rather big, important event so much preparation was needed! :)

Sooooo, just after 5pm we met up with Pete & Soph & started the big walk to the VIP entrance.  It was fairly chilly & my $220 dress was more suited to the Australian climate so I stole Cam's jacket to save passing out.  First famous siting was Pacifier who walked up straight behind us.  Wasn't particularly interested in meeting them but it was cool all the same.  We waited a while, being entertained by a mad looking monster carrying a head, before going through the entrance onto the RED CARPET.  All these people were screaming - it was totally amazing.  We were walking along & I noticed this man signing autographs.  Then he turned around & started walking behind Cam & I.  It was Sam Neill from Sirens, Jurassic Park...  Coolies, huh?  He damn near ran into me!  So, after forever (the red carpet went for ages) we finally reached the entrance to the theatre.  It was done up like a cave with all these rocks, gravel & sand & we had to walk through the cave to get in.  Then we had champers before finding our seats.  

We were thoroughly entertained, via the big screen, with the antics of the stars arriving & signing autographs, taking photos, & doing interviews - Peter Jackson (director), Elijah Wood (Frodo), Karl Urban (Eomer), Billy Boyd (Pippen), Dominic Monaghan (Merry) & Richard who runs Weta & does all the effects for the trilogy.  And yes, as you would all know, I was highly disappointed that Orlando Bloom was absent but you know, I've dealt with it.  And sorry to those chickadees who wanted me to bring them Viggo Mortenson back - he too was missing from action.  Anyhow, then there was a short film shown to Peter that the people of NZ had made for him.  It was really cute.  They were all doing whats now known as the Two Towers sign (2 thumbs up).  At one point there were 3 older men saying how much they like the Fellowship of the Ring & so on.  It came back to them later & one said ""Did you see it?"" and they're all like ""Nah"", ""No, no"".  So funny.  Then they all made their way into the theatre - you can only imagine the atmosphere.  We were aching to see them!  And so they came.  They all sat way down the front where only binoculars could see, but they all got their applause.  There were a few speeches & then the movie began.  Not long after, they left & we *think* were replaced by seat warmers. Hah, nice job that one!  

""Oh, what do I do for a living? I'm a seat warmer.""
""What's a seat warmer?  Well, at things like Premiers and Awards I get to sit in famous people's seats while they powder their noses or have a drink or for whatever reason they wish to leave their seats.""
""Well, to name a few there's been Elijah Wood, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman...""

Anyway, back to the point.  The movie rocked!!  It was totally awesome, so much more action.  Cam even really enjoyed it!  The downer - lacking in Merry & Pippen.  The bonus - lots of Legolas!  There's a lot more joking going on between Gimli & Legolas & it really starts to give an insight into their friendship.  There's a part where Aragorn looks stunning - he's half dead & walks into Helms Deep.  Yummy!  Pippen had some great ideas, and looked delicious when he was sad.  Merry shows a lot of conscious & compassion & tries his best to do his part in the war by way of getting the Ents involved.  He's so dissapointed at some points, it damn near brings me to tears.  It's like he's put all his effort into something & nothing ever comes of it.  Gimli cracks me up for the entire movie. :D  Legolas' emotions got me again - it's that deep sorrow but you also see this mischievous element that is totally droolworthy.  Oh, & he speaks even more elvish - melts my heart!  Now, I've just gotta wait another year until the next one.  Well, shucks.

After that fantastic movie, we started to head out & jumped aboard a heap of buses which took us to the after party at the Te Papa museum.  Huge museum - just fab.  It had this ring of fire and a group of drummers making it a fantastic atmosphere!  There was a red carpet there, too!!!  It was a pretty good party.  There was a LOTR exhibition that we were privileged enough to have first viewing of.  Soph was dying to see it, as was I.  So, I dragged her up, like 6 levels, to the best exhibition I've ever seen!  It was like they'd dug up all these artifacts from the past.  There was sooo much detail.  The costumes were so gorgeous up close - esp Galadriels dress.  And I got to see Legolas' quiver, bow & arrows - frigin awesome!  Plus we got to see how they created all of the size effects - Cam & I even did an effect ourselves.  I was hobbit size & he was wizard size.  It looked awesome.  And the armory rocked.  I hope it comes to Australia cause I'd love to see it all again.  While there, we got to meet the stars who were wandering around.  I got Elijah Wood's, Peter Jackson's, Billy Boyd's & Dominic Monaghan's autographs.  Billy & Dominic were sooo nice.  Very friendly & chatty.  Real nice guys.  We stayed at the party for a bit longer but then headed off cause we were totally buggered!  As soon as our heads hit our pillows we were out.

After another HUGE brekky, Cam & I headed out for some shopping. First up was a visit to the Official LOTR shop at the Te Papa.  I came out with a few pieces - including a location guide which shows all the places the trilogy was filmed.  Can't wait to go back & explore them!  Then we walked the streets searching for treasures which was nice.  We found a ""Bungee Jumping Trampoline"" where you get strapped up to a couple of elastic bands & you jump on a jumping castle thing.  So, Cam decided to have a go - he said it was wicked but got buggered after about 5 minutes.  Great exercise.  I wanted a go but being in a skirt, sort of lacked the courage. ;)  Then we checked out the ocean - so gorgeous.  And I could se the mountains!  That's the reason I've always wanted to go to NZ - the mountains.  They're just so green, so wild, so wonderful.  I got some footage & checked out the scenery.

3am the next morning we had to get up cause our flight left at 6am.  And so we left again in a cloak of darkness (do you see a pattern arising here?).  We flew over the South Island so I got to see the mountains there - so rugged & rough!

We were supposed to land in Melbourne but because of fog (oh there's a shocker - fog in Melbourne) we had to go back to Sydney where we were transferred to another plane back to Melbourne.  And eventually we were on our way home.

And that was my first trip to New Zealand - what a blast!  Can't wait to go back.  So surreal - if I didn't have the photos & souvenirs to prove it, I wouldn't believe me!"

"event","What a week it's been.  I'm gonna keep it short cause I just wrote the long one and lost the bloody thing.  If you want more details you know where I am.

I was on a total high last week cause my best friend was getting married.  I went up on Wednesday to keep her calm & do whatever I could do to help - which wasn't a lot cause they were very organised.  So, on Saturday, after a home facial, some nail painting & a trip to the hairdressers for make up & hair dos, we were ready to go.  Then a few things went wrong - her uncle's (who walked her up the aisle) jacket got locked in the house, she got lipstick on her dress & her great great grandmother had a heart attack at the end of the ceremony.  HOWEVER, it all got replaced, whited out & sent to hospital & the day continued.  Reception went off without a hitch which was great.  But I was totally exausted by the end of it as you can imagine - all that build up coming to a head.  I was ready to pass out.

I also got my results - 1 C and 4 As which was pretty good since I thought I was going to fail most of them.

My mum might also have a permanent job which is much better than the casual one now.  Plus she'll get to work with dad which means they have the same hours meaning they can see each other more.

So, what could top that.  Well, I'm going to New Zealand next week.  I won a competition.  Totally cool, huh?  Do you know what makes it even better though?  I'm going to....the....Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers....PREMIERE!!!  Yep, uh huh.  Can you f**kin' believe it?!?  I'm going to see Liv, Cate, Elijah, Viggo, Orlando & so many more in the flesh.

Going to go before I get too excited to write anymore.  If you freak out after reading this, don't forget to write a comment!"

"event","I've found myself skipping class a lot lately.  That sounds really bad,huh?  It's not as bad as it sounds, though, cause I do actually do the work - it's just I prefer to sit in the sun and do it rather than sit in a cold, dank classroom or lecture theatre.  And it's only for one particular teacher who I don't really understand too well and I never get anything from his lectures anyhow.  Main thing is I get the work done.

I am thankful for:

1. The Lord of the Rings - I went to the movies last week and say 'Bend It Like Beckham' (excellent movie with a pretty good ending which is severly important), and I saw an ad for the Two Towers, the 2nd installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  And I damn near cried I was so excited.  Mmmmmmmm, Legolas....*drools*

2. My brain - apart from the obvious neural functions it creates and partakes in, it has got me out of trouble a fair few times so it deserves a thank you.

3. My brand new orange shoes - they are soooo comfortable and soooo orange.  They're leather too and just fantastic.

4. Brutus - that's my car.  He gets me where I need to go (well, most times) and he doesn't often break and has only crashed once but that wasn't his fault cause somebody ran into him.  And best of all, he can handle my driving which has been described as crazy, psychotic and mad at times.

I've gotta go to class now.  Just one last thing before I go, a quote that I think wraps me up in one go:

""Good girls are just bad girls that don't get caught"""

I ended up quitting my job.  All went well.  I didn't want to cause any more trouble so I just told them it was because of school.  So I now have my weekends free and it's a total joy.  Loving it!!  And it does make it more possible to at least try and get my school work done.  Just finishing as essay right now actually - it's due tomorrow.  Hmmm, and I had all these plans for being organised this semester.  *shrugs*

I am thankful for:

1. Taxiride - the boys are finally coming to my hometown and I'm totally psyched!!  It should be excellent.  Some of my friends from Uni are going with me and we'll have a ball.  Unfortunately, I'm currently too poor to buy their CD so I won't know any of the words!!!  Hopefully, I'll be able to afford it.

2. Motorbikes - must be my dangerous side but I really want to get a motorbike.  There's just something about them and I just can't wait till I can afford one.  I don't want a dirt bike and I don't want a fully decked out road bike and I don't want a Harley.  I don't really care what colour it is but I've heard that the resale on black and red bikes is better, so that's probably the best idea.

3. Picture messages - I've finally got a mobile phone that gets picture messages.  I get so many picture messages sent to me and until now, I couldn't see them.  But now, it's all good.

4. Sunlight - I like nothing better than sitting outside in the sunshine reading a book, or doing my school work, talking or hanging with friends.  

5. Finishing something I set out to do - this is an awesome feeling.  To feel that I've actually completed something.  It's fantastic."

"event","I'm quitting one of my jobs tomorrow.  Why?  Well, since the big bosses have been on the floor, things have changed for the worst.  First they decided to get rid of the radio.  Then the heaters had to go(mind you we work in a big cold shed that is so cold that bomber jackets are part of the required uniform).  Now, they don't like my hair and want it back to a 'normal' colour.  My ass!  They can shove it where the sun don't shine.  I'd been thinking of getting rid of it anyhow - studies are taking up too much time of late.  Plus, I wouldn't mind going out and getting drunk now & again.

I am thankful for:

1. Fudge - the hair dye that gives me the chance to be me.  It gives you the opportunity to change your hair to any colour of the rainbow.  Just think of Kelly Osborne - she orders it in from Australia she thinks it's so good!

2. Online Journals - this is one of the most necessary items for a uni student.  I don't know what I'd do without these babies!  They save so much time and you don't have to wait while someone else uses that journal.  They are extremely handy.

3. Clubbing - I have found this new love of going out on a Saturday night.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's because of my Orlando Bloom lookalike bartender.  Mmmm.  I'm just really enjoying socialising and having a bit of a dance - sober or not.  I don't know where my change of heart came from but I'm liking it.

4. Kit Kat Chunky - no matter if it's milk chocolate or white chocolate, I love 'em both.  The only problem is that I have this mad inability to simply suck the chocolate and make it last, I just HAVE to eat it in big chunks.  It's uncontrollable.

5. Being organised - I like making up timetables and having my books in a specific order (height, already read, alphabetical, etc) and having my schoolwork in separate, organised folders for each subject.  I think it's got to do with being a Capricorn, it's apparently a part of our nature.  I have this little trouble though, in sticking to my timetables and keeping my work separated. *shrugs*  I spose, at least I try."

But it wasn't too bad today cause they had me cleaning shelves and crap so it sorta kept me warm.  Got a few good comments on my hair, too.  It's bright bright red.  My mum adores it.  My brother said he needed to put his sunnies on to see me.  My dad was just shocked.  And my boss said nothing.

The weather has been very chilly the last few days.  It even snowed in a part of our town - we don't get snow here ever.  The last time was 1956.  It wasn't much but it made me exstatic.  

I am thankful for:

1. Heath Ledger - I'm watching 10 Things right now and I just adore him.  He is totally gorgeous and was perfect for the role.  And that smile.  *drools*  I love the movie too, some great music and some hilarious lines.  Cracks me up.  The Baby Belly.  *he he*

2. Double ""D"" Butter drops - they're sugar free, fat free butter drops and they are really yummy.  They keep me entertained & awake when I'm really bored at work or doing homework.  You know, those times you want to eat but you're not hungry, they're good for that.

3. Being up to date with my schoolwork - doesn't happen very often but when it does it's fantastic.  One of those times when you don't have to worry about school for a little while and can just get on with your own life.  It's those moments you wait for when you go to Uni.

4. Jelly Beans - I adore these.  I never used to eat jelly beans at all until a friend gave me a ""Study Buddy"" full of them.  And now I'm addicted.  So badly that I can't buy them cause I'll just eat the whole lot.  Really good during exams, though.

5. My vintage lamp - people always pay me out for my lamp but it's classic.  It's orange with a cylindrical lampshade and gold edging.  It's from the 50s or something...very cool.  Although, I think it's a bit of a fire hazard.

That's it for today."

I am thankful for:

1. Dawson's Creek - I have to admit I didn't always like this show and I really think they need to, in my mum's words, ""drown Dawson in that damn creek"".  However, there are some great storylines, some fab talent and, hello, they have a tendency to bring in some hotties.  Just check out Jen's new squeeze!!  Mmmmm, don't bother breaking me off a piece of that, I want the whole lot!!

2. Quotes - I love quotes.  I don't know why.  Maybe because the quotes I like are said/written by people who are smarter, wiser and funnier than me.  They can be inspiring, helpful or just good for a laugh.  I've actually started a bit of a collection.

3. CD Burners - have you got any idea how much money I've saved with this fantastic contraption??  No, me neither but I know it's a hell of a lot.  And while I understand the problems it causes in the music industry, I also understand that my wallet is not overflowing with cash.  I've weighed up the options and I'll deal with the guilt.

4. Moisturiser - I live by the stuff.  I wash my hands so many times a day (and that will increase when I become a nurse) that moisturiser is a savour, especially if I don't want my hands to look like that of a 60yr old woman's when I turn 25!  Plus, I quite rather my hands feeling smooth...all the better to FEEL with, my dear. ;)

5. Water - I think the only time you really appreciate how great water is and how fabulous it tastes is when you get that sick that you can't even drink water without throwing up.  I remember the last time that happened hence it's mention here.  I won't list the benefits cause we all know them, I'll just leave you with one comment - it's the essence of life."

"event","I nearly fell asleep at work today so many times!!!  I stayed up late studying & then had to get up at 5 to go to work - not at good combination!!  Once I got some breaky into me it was a bit better but boy oh boy, not fun.  And my boss sits diagonal to me & I had a couple of episodes where I just thought ""I'll just close my eyes for a minute..."" & my head would fall & I'd jolt awake for about 1 second before it happened again.  My body should adjust soon enough.

I am thankful for:

1. Breakfast bars - I only have short breaks at work & there's no way I've got time for toast & cereal so it is breakfast bars I depend upon on those days.  They're quite yummy, too.

2. The cinema - I LOVE the cinema, I LOVE movies, I LOVE the atmosphere, stale popcorn & all.  If I could I would live at the cinema.  It's a way to escape reality & probably one of my absolute favourite past times.  I just wish it didn't cost so much & then I could go more often.  I think there is very little that can beat a cinema experience.  Sitting back in an uncomfy chair with bladder-bursting drinks & popcorn that's guaranteed to get stuck in your teeth.  How can you argue with that??

3. Lamb shanks - ever had these?  Really soft meat that just falls off the bone, add a little salt & it's totally delicious.  Had some for tea tonight so definitely worth mentioning.

4. Laughter - I cannot live without laughter.  It's essential to life & will help you get through all the trauma & troubles you come across in your life.  Well, that's my belief, anyhow.  It's so important to me that I got a tattoo on my back that means 'to laugh'.  

5. Audio books - my mum introduced me to these babies.  I'm a data entry operator which means hours & hours spent in front of a computer typing up data.  This is a skill that requires no brainwork at all (which explains some of the people I work with!) & is really really really boring.  But when I listen to audio books, the time sorta goes a bit more quickly & it's a little more bearable.  Otherwise, I might go crazy.  Although, people who know me might think it's too late."

"event","Found out the funniest thing last night - my ex got dumped again!!!  Sounds like I'm a really bad person, right?  But he's so arrogant & such a bastard that if you knew him, you'd be laughing too. Sometimes life just comes round and bites you on the ass. *tee hee*

Anyhow, saw ""The Sweetest Thing"" last night which is a cracker of a film.  Was dissapointed that the taxi part was cut though. Hmmm..

But onto my thankfuls for today.

I am thankful for:

1. Working short hours - I know that working longer than 3 hours would mean more money but at least I can still get my schoolwork done with a little cash on the side so I can still, well, live.  If I depended on the government I'd be dead in a gutter somewhere.  Cheap bastards.

2. E-Tax - being able to do your tax over the internet is soooo much easier & you get your refund in a maximum of 2 weeks.  Now, that's what I like.

3. Rainbow - she's my ancient cat.  And I'm talking 18 human years here so, hello!  When I got home from partying last night, she looked cold so I brought her inside to sleep on my bed.  It was nice and cosy.

4. Male bartenders - we've definitely got some good lookers there.  There's one club I go to and the bartender there is FINE!! Mmmmmmm, dreamy.  A hottie who can mix alcoholic drinks.  What more could you ask for?

5. Corn Thins - they're like rice cakes except they're made from corn.  They're healthy and they, full on, taste like popcorn.  I like them with tomato & salt, or promite, or promite & cheese (my very fave).

And for now, I say ciao."

"event","I thought I needed to use my livejournal in a more productive way so I've decided that whenever I remember, I'll list at least 5 things I'm greatful for.  I've heard it's great for your spirit (so says Oprah - and who's gonna argue with her).  

I am thankful for:

1. My mum's homemade vege bake - this is really yum!  I've got no idea where she got the recipe for but it's got pumpkin, potato, carrot, maybe brocolli & cauliflower, and pasta in it.  Then she covers it in this cheesy/creamy pumpkin soupy mix and bakes away.  Okay, doesn't sound fabulous when I write it down but it's great for a cold winter's night and it's healthy too.

2. Sneak - that's my dog.  He's soooo cute.  He's a Shitzu-Maltese bred from our other 2 dogs.  He's got his mother's height and his father's width so he's built like a brick shithouse.  And he is really really fluffy.  He's mad as well.  He comes flying into the house with his mum and they attack each other and run around like madmen.  Funny as a card.

3. Cold & Flu tablets - when you've gotta go to lectures all day, there ain't nothing better than cold & flu tablets to clear your head of that nasty virus.  Without them I wouldn't make it through the day.

4. Diet Coke & Extra chewing gum - two things you will never find me without.  I don't like coffee and with the hours I keep (sometimes 5am - 12 midnight) I need as much caffeine as I can possibly get.  The gum is cause my jobs & uni lectures are extremely boring and I need some sort of activity to at least keep me awake, & possibly attentive.

5. Heaters - at uni, the heaters never seem to be working and in the cafe they don't even have heating, so I'm thankful that I have heating in my car & at home otherwise I'd never thaw out. 

Stay tuned for more exciting thanking."

"event","Well, it has been forever, hasn't it??  I just read my last entry and so much has happened since then.

Rowan and I ended up dating but I wasn't happy so I ended it.  I always do.  I may or may not have a fear of committment - I have yet to be committed enough to work that out!  Anyhow, no need to dwell too much on that 'relationship' though I hardly think it falls into that category.

My best friend's engagement was fab - I met a total honey named Matt and he's just sweet as.  He gets to go to so many concerts and it pisses me off royally - we have very similar tastes so he's seen all these fab bands!  Unfortunately, he now has a girlfriend but then again LD relationships don't work too often.

Funny, yet again my babble has turned to boys.  I really am 15 years old mentally!  Next, let's chat about my latest crush.  His name is Anthony, he's a friend of mine's younger brother and is sweet as.  If I had a scanner I could put in a lush photo but no, it's not meant to be.  He's going to my brother's birthday celebrations in a few weeks so that should be awesome - they know each other from school  Don't panic, I'm not considering dating someone my brother's age.  Anthony is a whole year older than my brother.  :)  I'm hoping that something happens with this guy, my brother says he is an awesome guy but that brings me to my bitch session.

See, my brother has known Anthony for a while (but they're not really really close or anything).  Anyhow, I asked him to think of a way or two that might help me to get Anthony and he goes off saying he doesn't even really know the guy or anything.  Hello, he does know him and he has friends who know him and it would be nice of him to maybe find something out for me but NOOOOOO he couldn't actually help his sister out could he?  I always help him out - just last week I took time out to travel downtown and get him a form for a health care card and he hasn't even bothered filling it out.  He was so desperate and I tried to help.  Sometimes I think, Why bother?

That's it for me. Back to study."

"event","The much awaited visit from Julie arrived on Saturday.  We haven't seen each other in a couple of years and I was so very excited to be seeing her and also for the big night that we had planned.

First, a bit about Julie.  I'd have to say that I am one of her only remaining friends from our little group in high school.  Not her choice but some of our other friends have decided to not keep in contact.  I'd say it's because Julie is loud and some people just can't put up with that.  I, on the other hand, can.  

Back to the story.  She arrived just a little after midday and I was still in the bath because my brother had run the hot water out and I had been waiting ages for it to come back on.  Anyhow, so I'm running around half naked trying to get dressed in something half suitable.

So we chatted for a while as I continued to get ready.  We ended up going to the local shopping centre to window shop and buy alcohol and get lunch.  We pigged out so badly that it's hysterical.  Then we came home, watched a couple of vids and as the sun began to fall behind the horizon, the drinking began.

We went out at about 10pm and had the best of times.  Julie really enjoyed herself - which was my main aim - and I did end up getting her drunk - which was my second aim.  
Me, well yes, I was very drunk myself but that always works to the advantage.  I caught up with a few friends.  Ali sat down and talked to us for ages - God, that boy has a washboard stomach!!  But then again, there is nothing of him.  And I got to talk to Luke, who I haven't seen in 4 years!!  It was absolutely awesome to see him - he's still got whatever it was that attracted me to him all those years ago!  And Rowan and I flirted continuously at each other but we were only joking.  Overall fabulicious night!  I had a blast.

On the other hand, Sunday totally sucked.  I had the worst alcohol poisoning - damn that evil drink!!  I stopped drinking at 3am and I didn't stop dry reaching until 5pm.  I had the sickest headache and my tummy was in total turmoil.  It was terrible.  I'm swearing off the drink for a little while because it's just not worth it.

So, let's see how long that lasts.

It's my best friends engagement party this weekend and I'm planning on having a ball.  I can't wait to see her glowing.  This is the biggest event before her wedding.  It'll be like the build up.  And I think the bridesmaids are being announced too.  Yeah, I know I'm one of them - actually, I know who they all are - but it's still exciting."

"event","I've had a severly busy weekend and I'm totally exhausted.  It begins on Friday.

I worked on Friday which was strange because I haven't worked on a Friday in about 2 months but work had picked up and they needed us.  Then, I got home and I had to call my friend Cathy straight away.  Cathy is a friend who goes to Uni on the coast.  We've known each other for 6 years now and we're very good friends.

We ended up going out for tea to our local RSL, eating too much and talking even more, and then headed to the movies to see ""Swordfish"".  I really enjoyed the movie - okay, Hugh Jackman was a big puller but the twist at the end was good.  We had a great time and I was really happy to see her.  We talked about her college ball which I'm going to and we got real excited about the whole prospect.

We also discussed Fiona.  Fiona is a friend of mine who is dating a man much older than herself but that's not the problem.  She's doing that thing where her boyfriend is more important than her friends and she keeps cutting out on us at the last minute.

Anyhow, we got home around 12 midnight and I went straight to bed I was so tired.

Saturday.  With no real plans I just went about my day as usual.  Though I did more than expected.  I went shopping with mum, walked the dog, went shopping again, went to the bank, cleaned the house, blah blah blah.  Then I got a message that we were going out so I started to get ready.

Here I will admit that I did a naughty thing.  I bought myself a pack of cigarettes.  Bad habit, I know.  But sometimes I feel the need.  Does the fact that they were menthol make the situation any better?  No, I didn't think so.

Anyhow, I went around to Gemma's to pick her and Rachel up and off we went.  Yep, to the local club.  We always go there, I know, but I enjoy it and on the worst night for good-looking guys, you can always depend on the bar staff.  Yummo!!

I wasn't drinking but I had a good time anyhow and we stayed out till 3 again.  Now, usually when I get home I have to stay up for an hour or so because I'm still buzzing from the night out but on Saturday I went straight to bed.  That was after eating a sandwich because I'd been starving for 2 hours!!

Today I was woken up by my brother announcing that my ""idiot friend from Wagga"" was here.  Dammit!!  I'd slept in and Simone and Jason were visiting.  So, we went out for coffee and cake and then they went to Simone's grandfather's 90th birthday.  I don't see them for long when they visit but it's good to see them anyhow.  

Then I changed my room around because my bed was next to the window and it was getting too cold for me at nights.  It's been like that ever since I blew up my electric blanket.  

And now I'm sick and tired and starving.  Somethings wrong with me I can feel it.  I'm always tired, always hungry (and particularly craving sweet foods), light-headed, blah blah blah.  

Anyhow, we'll see.

Love always
Megan."

"event","That it did.  Gemma and I had simple plans to watch videos at Heidi's.  But then we decided to go out.

This was both good and bad.  There were some defnite highs and lows to the night.

It started as usual.  No big line-ups or anything this time so that was great.  And we got a table which is a tad rare.  I wasn't planning on drinking but we'll get back to that.

So, first thing I noticed was that it was a guy from high school's 21st birthday so it was a bit of a reunion except that they didn't really recognise me.  It was great to see them all again, even though I didn't talk to them.  How some of them have changed!!

One guy in particular.  Let's just say that at one stage in my early drinking days, he took advantage of me so I haven't had particularly great feelings towards him.  Anyhow, he was always a really skinny guy and always proclaiming that he didn't have the teeniest bit of fat on him.  Well, I saw him and he had packed on the pounds.  Not a huge guy but it just brought me a little joy to see that some of the bad karma had caught up with him.  Is that mean spirited of me?

Then some of my other friends turned up.  Krissy turned up to take in some techno and sance the night away.  She's the best techno dancer I know.  Right in the spirit without killing people with wayward arms and kicking legs.  So, I danced for a while with her which was great fun.

Then Jenny turned up with her sister and some friends.  They had been to her sister's deb so they were all dressed up and more than half cut.  All very gorgeous girls.  Anyhow, I was just chatting to them and then her friend said, ""Do you want a 'cocksucking cowboy' (a shot drink) cause I'm buying?""  And I was like, yeah!!  But then Jenny broke down because she had broken up with her boyfriend 2 weeks beforehand and he was at the club that night.  Poor baby.  She was in tears and it hurt me.  I hope she'll be okay.

I was sitting there (right at the front of the club so we could see the line-up and who was coming into the club) and having a great time, laughing, talking and drinking Blueberry Vodka Cruisers (mmmm, yum).  And of course, checking out the line-up.  And wouldn't you know it, he turned up.  Yep, Josh.  And here I was thinking I wouldn't be talking about him anytime soon.

Right.  Good thing coming up (though not as good as I would have liked) for Megan.  I did not make real eye contact with him.  I just did that eye contact that you do with strangers when you're looking around a crowd.  You know, the one where you look briefly but don't think or recognise the person?  Yeah, that one.  I was so proud.  And the more I didn't look at him, the more he tried to make eye contact.  And he did it for the rest of the night, too.

However, *warning: bad part* that did not stop him from making out with some girl.  Yeah, killer.  Stabbed right through the heart.  And I was so determined not to care but I did.  And then I drank some more and smoked a little (unfortunately, sometimes I feel the need). 

Then I went home to Gemma's and sulked in my sleep.

Interesting night to say the least.  And defnitely some things to think about and friends to console.  Here I was thinking my life was deadly boring.  Then again, maybe it is?"

"event","Now, I have a decision to make.  Is my car cursed or am I a totally sucky driver?  What am I talking about?  OK, let me explain.

About two months ago, I was driving Gemma home from work when I hit a dog.  I was doing the speed limit, following the road rules and everything.  It just ran out of the yard.  The owners told me it wasn't my fault, it was theirs because they had the gate open, but it was still shocking.  I burst into tears.  But Gemma was great.  She went and talked  to the owners and checked it all out.  It was a little Jack Russell.

Yesterday, I was driving Gemma to work and I hit a dog.  Again.  And it was the exact same circumstances.  I was in the right.  The owners were getting their boat out of the drive and the dog just ran straight out the gate and across the road.  Unfortunately, I was driving along the road at that exact time.  The owners told me it wasn't my fault.  But it was worse again this time.  The dog, I can still hear it's whimpering echoing throughout my car.  It was a Jack Russell.

Everybody says it's not my fault.  I did all I could do.  But two dogs, both Jack Russells mind you, in two months.  It doesn't seem right.

My brother and my dad think it's terrible but there was nothing I could do about it so they think I should laugh at it.  They call me the ""Terminator"" and ""Roadkill"" but it still hurts.  It doesn't feel right."

"event","Talk about a mad Saturday morning.  All I wanted to do was take my little cousin to the movies.

My cousin, Janie, is 5 years old but she's tiny.  She's very petite and the total opposite to her younger sister, Renae, who is the same height as her but built more solidly.  They're both so gorgeous.

Anyhow, Saturday morning I had plans to take Janie to the movies (I wasn't taking Renae because she's only 3 and would get bored).  So, we jumped in the car at 10am (the movie was starting at 10.30) and started off towards the cinema, chatting happily to each other.  But then my car, Brutus, decided it was a tad too cold for him outside and stopped right in front of my old high school.  How many times did I try to get him started again?  Who knows?  However, I was lucky enough to have halted in front of a police car and the police man was nice enough to get out and push my car around the corner into a parking space and he even let me use his mobile phone so I could call my dad (because for the one time in my life since I had got it, I left my mobile at home!).

Anyhow, my dad came along and we swapped cars and off we headed again.  I later found out that Brutus was just having a hissy fit and was only cold, not sick.

We arrived at the cinema, running a tad late, ran up to the ticket desk and what did they tell me?  ""Sorry, 'The Emperor's New Groove' has been cancelled because we've had a last minute booking for a conference.""  

Aaaaaaggggggghhhhhhhhhh!!

So, I grabbed Janie, ran upstairs and showed her a poster for Shrek because that was on at the same time.  I wanted to check that she wasn't scared of Shrek but she got real excited about it.  Well, we grabbed a couple of tickets to that, got some snacks and got comfy in the rather packed theatre.

We got half way through the movie when I started thinking to myself, ""Did I lock the car?""  And because it's one of those automatic things that you do, I couldn't for the life of me remember if I had and I started to panic a little.  So I had to leave Janie alone, with a cinema attendee watching, while I ran to check the car.  And, yes, it was locked but I wouldn't have been able to watch the movie properly if I hadn't checked.

So, everything went smooth from there on.  Except when mum asked me to go and get the newspaper.  Well, I got it and jumped in her car and wouldn't you know it, the damn thing wouldn't start!  I just thought, ""OK, I'm not supposed to be driving today.""

So, the day turned out a little more eventful than it was first planned but we had a great time and I can't wait to take her to the movies again.  I love my cousins!!

Oh, and just a note.  I'm currently going through a Westlife phase.  They just redid Billy Joel's (whom I'm a big fan of) ""Uptown Girl"" and I adore it.  And all the profits from the sales go to charity!  Gotta love it.

Love always

"event","Sometimes people annoy me.  With their knowledge.  It annoys me when someone has been in a similar situation to yourself and they think they have all the answers and know everything about it.

For example, we found out the other week that my dad needs to get a hip replacement.  I was telling Gemma about it and how dad was determined to be well for my birthday party and how he was going to try and get better in less than 3 months (which is the average).   Then Gemma started to give me this huge lecture about how much pain he'll be in and how he won't be able to move much at my birthday.  But she doesn't know my dad - he's very determined and he knows we can't afford to have him off work for too long so he'll risk his health for the family.  He's always been like that.  I don't like it, but that's just the way he is.  And a family friend had had the same operation so she had given him the inside goss on it.  Gemma's friend had had a SIMILAR operation so she wasn't really basing her information on facts.

Another example.  I found out yesterday that I've been put on the 3 month waiting list to get my wisdom teeth pulled out.  I'm really excited about the prospect and some people don't understand.  I've never been admitted to hospital so this will be my first time and I can't wait.  I was even excited the first time I got a drip put in, if that helps you to understand.  So, I'm very excited about being admitted and being put to sleep and stuff like that.  But Gemma was at it again.  ""Oh, you'll be in so much pain"" ""You won't be excited when you're there"" ""It's terrible.  You'll hate it""  

Some people are more prone to do this than others.  Like Gemma.  She seems to think that because some things worked or didn't work for her, they'll be exactly the same for everyone else.  Not all the time.  Just some times.

She did it to me when I found out I was going to be a bridesmaid for the first time.  ""Oh, it's so expensive""  ""It's boring""  ""It's so much hassle"" ""You'll hate it""  And I'm really looking forward to it.  I can't wait to be a part of my friend's special day.

I just wish people were more open-minded.  That they would realise that not every experience in life is the same for each and every person.

I know a lot of the time these people are just trying to help, it's just sometimes they don't.

Love always
Megan."

"event","Well, my weekend turned out to be a little more jam-packed than first expected.  I had a four day weekend because there was no work on Friday and the Queen's Birthday Public Holiday was today.  So, I shall begin with Friday and the slumber party.

Gemma had organised a slumber party for Friday because both her housemates were going to be away and she thought it would be a great time for all of us to get together.  There were about 12 of us in total going but nothing ever turns out as planned.  One person I was really hoping to go was Rachel.  I hadn't seen her in 3 or 4 weeks so I was really dissapointed when I heard she wasn't coming.  Because when I think about it, Gemma had organised it especially so that we could catch up with Rachel.  And slowly but surely, the numbers decreased to 2 - Gemma and me.  Heidi, Trina and Nicky showed up and stayed for a few hours but really it was just Gemma and I.  

Anyhow, we still had fun - we watched Charlie's Angels and Reindeer Games and ate way too much pizza and chips but *shock horror* we totally forgot about my ice-cream cake!!  I'd been talking about this cake for ages and I was so excited (I'd won it at a trivia night a few weeks ago) and I can't believe we forgot it!!  I've eaten some of it since and it is so delicious.  Mmmmmm.  *drools*  It's passionfruit and strawberry.  Yummo!

Back to the plot (if there actually was one).  We slept late on Saturday morning and got up and watched music videos for a couple of hours.  Then we got dressed and went to McDonalds for lunch.  I hadn't had McDonalds in sooooooo long.  So that was yum.

Then, me and my ice-cream cake went home and unexpectantly (as usual) I stayed up that night with my brother and his friends while they drank themselves into submission.  It's quite funny to watch and being the older sister, there's always one that tries to hit on me.  *Ha*  I figure I can't be that desperate otherwise I would have gone for it!

Then I woke up on Sunday as sore as anything.  No, it had nothing to do with the couple of drinks I had on Saturday night.  My teeth were absolutely killing me.  I have major troubles with my wisdom teeth.  I'm on the waiting list to get them taken out but I've still got 1 1/2 years till that happens.  So, until then I have to put up with the pain, infections and swelling that occurs nearly every month.  And because it was a Sunday, the doctor's surgery was not open so I had to wait 4 1/2 hours in the ER for a 5 minute consultation and a prescription which I already knew I needed.  Pain in the butt - I was so bored.

I had plans to go out for tea and the movies last night and I still went, it's just I couldn't eat.  Gemma, Heidi, Heidi's boyfriend, Steve, and I went to a local RSL for an all-you-can-eat buffet (well all-you-can-not-eat in my case) and then we went to the movies to see Pearl Harbour.  I don't know what all the critics are babbling about 'cause I really enjoyed it.  Good action sequences, good story line, great cast.  I have to admit I got a little teary at times.

But, I was a little agitated over something.  Kyle.  You may know the name from my previous entry.  He's a friend of Josh's but much kinder, from what I've seen.  And he's a hottie.  Anyhow, I had plans to begin my campaign but they failed miserably because Kyle wasn't even working!  Ahh well.  Maybe next time.

And today I'm just bearing with the pain and taking it easy.  Nice slow day to catch up with the soaps.  *grins*

Love always
Megan."

"event","Well, it must begin sometime, I suppose.  So, here is my first journal entry.  My friend, Emma, recommended that I give it a whirl and here I am.  

I think I'll start off on a sour note.  I know it's not the best way but it's the only place to begin.

Josh.  That was his name.  I hadn't known it beforehand but I knew his face.  I'd noted his good looks on many occasions before that Saturday night.  He worked at the local cinema and I tell you what, he still looks great in his work uniform.  *drools*

But back to that Saturday night.  

We were celebrating my friend Gemma's birthday.  A large group of us ended up at a local club and made ourselves comfortable on the couches in the window.  I, myself, sat on the edge of another couch currently used by some guys.  One of them (Kyle, as I was to later find out), asked me if I wanted them to move so I could sit down and I said not to worry about it - I was fine on the edge.  Then some of my friends moved and I joined Gemma and her sister on the other couch.  I kept looking at the guys on the other couch because I was sure I recognised them.  And then it hit me - they were the hotties (Josh and Kyle) that worked at the cinema!!  I told Gemma straight away and she definitely helped with what happened soon after.

We actually moved to a table (situated behind the boys) to have a drink.  Then Gemma's twin sister, Heidi, came up to her and (pointing to Josh) asked if Gemma thought he was cute.  Gemma said no but that I thought he was gorgeous.  And I can't believe what happened next.  Heidi, in her drunken state, went up to Josh, introduced herself and brought him over to us so we could all talk.  And it went something like this.

Heidi: ""This is my twin sister, Gemma, and it's our birthday today!""
Josh: ""How old are you?""
H: ""25.""
J: ""Oh, a bit old for me.""
H: ""But our friend, Megan, here, she's only a youngin'.""
J: ""How old are you?""
M: ""20.""
J: ""Oh, that's better.""
(Gemma all the while is just laughing)
H: ""Anyhow, my friend Megan's got really dry lips.  Can you help her with that?""

And that's when Josh first kissed me.  Yeah, he was drunk, but so was I.  Gemma was amazed.  Heidi was smiling with glee.  And I spent most of the rest of the night stuck to Josh's lips - not that I minded in the least.  And the one thought that kept running through my head?  I can't believe I'm kissing one of my crushes!!  It's still an accomplishment in my books.

So, I did not sleep with him.  It's not my style.  However, I did leave him with my number (written with lipstick on a beer coaster - very classy but then again, he had just shown me his naked butt cause of his new tattoo so it was a very classy night in total) and, after he had double checked that it was in fact my number, he promised to call.

He didn't.  It took me a few days to get over it but I did and I was fine.  I just put it down to some drunken fun.  That was two months ago.

Two weeks ago, I went out to the same club with Gemma again.  We usually go there and it was just another Sauturday night, like all the rest.

We were sitting at a table near the front of the club, just watching the people come and go and chatting with some friends.  Then I saw him.  Josh was at the head of the line outside and just about to come in.  I panicked and told Gemma.

Now, I'm not one to just go up to someone I've kissed and say, ""Hey, how's it going?  Remember me?  Want to go out some time?"".  As much as I talk usually, when I get around strangers, any real thoughts just totally leave my head.  So, after some feeble and unsuccessful attempts to talk to Josh on my own, Gemma took it into her own drunken hands.  It must be something with that family and alcohol.  Anyhow, she walked straight up to him, with me in tow, and said,

Gemma: ""Josh!!  Hey, how are you?  Do you remember me?  You don't remember me.  I'm Gemma and this is..."" (and she points to me)
Josh (looking at me): ""Megan.""

He remembered me.  I was sure he'd forgotten.  Anyway, we had some halted talks about various things - his work, when he hadn't recognised me when I went to see a movie, his upcoming holiday to Florida and the fact that he didn't have my whole phone number (he was missing the last number).  So, I was blunt (for the first time in my life).  

M: ""I'm going to be blunt here.  Do you want my number or not?""
J: ""Yeah, just give me the last number.""
M: ""OK, it's nine.""
J: ""Right, nine.  I'll remember that 'cause it's the last number of the place where I live.""
M: ""OK, great.""

We chatted some more, Gemma in some of the conversations, just the two of us at other times.  And again, as I was leaving he promised to call.

He didn't.  The second time it hurt a lot more.  To get rejected after a drunken night of fun is totally different to the rejection of a second promise from a guy who's sober.  I hate lies.  It's a terrible habit and even though he may have been trying to save my feelings, I would have preferred if he'd just said, ""No, I don't want your number.""  I would have saved me from the hope I went through.

But the adventure does not stop there.

The following Tuesday I went to the movies with my friend, Jenny.  And Josh was working.  We didn't say hello but we did acknowledge that each other was there.  He was closing that night and since my movie was the last to finish, I got a ch"

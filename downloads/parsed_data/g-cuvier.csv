"event","The tide is not looking too good this week:( this will limit my shore fishing options...however if the south swell dies then i can go fishing from the kayak. surfing is always an option if the swell stays through the week. maybe the best of both worlds... Haleiwa would be 1-3 feet and south shore flat! this is not very likely though. i guess i could go diving...which i would rather be doing somewhere exotic like Palau. that would be sweet! oh well...i will probably sleep. still at work bored out of my mind."

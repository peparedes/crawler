"event","I feel fantastic!

This has been such a good week I cant beleive it!

Wooh.

Talking to Holly some more and beat her at CS:S, hahahah.
The first thing she said when getting into the game was 'Prepared to Get Pwned' and I got 24/10 to her 9/19 in the first round.  It wasnt 1 on 1, it was 2v2 and there was another player who whped the floor with us at first when we joined up, but once I got used to annoying map and the way the guy played he wasnt such a problem. Heheheh.

But anyways, thats not one of the good things.

My dad seems to be taking this better this better then my mother, and I think I know why.
My mother is struggling to understand me, she effeted so directly by any changes I go through since I'll be living in Southampton.  She still hopes that I'll just forget about it.
My dad has put his hands up and said 'I know I cant understand what your feeling, so you are the best person to know whats right.  I just want to make sure you do it all right and dont regret it.'

Speaking of doing it properly;
Father offered to pay for private treatment for this!  Woohooo.
I explained everything that I was thinking about at that time and how I'd started to look private treatment and find out about how it works and Bank Loans.  And he offered to pay.
Though, I dont know how much he would be willing to pay for, but as long as he pays for the basics like the piles of psych meetings and basic treatments after that I should be able to save up for random cosmetic stuffs.

So, this might happen the way I wants it yet.

"event","Right, I'm about to leave for Southampton and get to the councellors place.

So, I'm reading over logs of stuff that people have told me, stuff that makes me feel good and fills me with hope so I can walk in there and tell them just what I want and if its at all possible.
If not that's not at all possible, then the entire complex will get forcibly placed where the sun dosnt shine in the NHS (pretty much the entire thing) and I'll look into private treatment.

But after this meeting, I have to go and see my dad.
So I will talk to him for a long whilat about this whole thing.

What I want to do is try and get a private psych session or two out of my parents and then have him tell them that I'm deadly serious about this.
ANd then with luck my dad will surport me with some money, or else help me manage the debt I#'m going to put myself into over this.
As I need this before I can carry on, I'm sure of it.

Well, going to miss the train if I stay here.

Bai bai,
Prey for me

"event","This morning I had such a bad day, EVERYTHING went wrong, I was threatened with being fired from work and stuff like that.

BUT.

I was angsting at some people on an IRC room for TGs that I've been going to over the last few days.  I was happily venting to someone about my thoughts and had made sure all my dates where in my phone for all the next convention and such.  I also put the date in where my 4-8week waiting list would start.

Anyways, was Mid rant when I get a phone call from a privat number.  Any other time I would have presumed this was mother from work, but she was downstairs and I picked it up and my hope was right, it was the councellors!
They said they had a cancelation tomorrow and wanted to now if I could turn up.
WOOOH
Take that Month waiting list!

So, tomorrow I shall be going to the councellor.

Then I went down and was talking mother and we started to make a cake together and mentioned that I had an apointment the next day and we got talking.
We talked for ages about everything she felt about the news and some of my feelings.
She was saying he she had expected me one day to tell her that I was Gay and stuff like that and had grown to except that, but never this. 
And we talked for ages and she seems fine with it.  But what I dont think she knows if how fast I want this to go since my entire life is on hold at the moment.  Which thinking now is a bit unfair on her, but I shall tll her tomorrow depending on how the session goes.

But I've found out some horrible stuff about the NHS.  Yes it'll be years before I can get hormones, which I hate enough.  But also, before they can prescribe hormones they want 3months of Real Life Experiance!
What the hell is the point in that!  I need those hormones to change into someone I can be happy with going out as a girl.
It really sucks.

But I also got talking to someone who is my age and about to start Uni and got through onto Hormones after about three months and got some surgury and all that really fast.  But did it all privately.
This is what she looked like three months ago, I need to get a modern picture of her;
http://photobucket.com/albums/a383/theoneandonlyholly/?action=view&current=DC100392.jpg
But she's full time at the moment and very happy with who he is.
I dont want to rush anything drastic, but I realy need this.
The only way to get on Hormones before trying to live as female is to go private.  So I'm fucked really.

So, I'm going to ask some serious questions about how the NHS works its patients, and if it turns out what I'm being told is true then I'm going to have to look into going private and ruining my finances for life.
But at least I'll have a life.

I'm actually totaly stoaked about this, I cant beleive I'm feeling happy after such a crappy day.  Its great.  I made a new friend, got a but load of information, made progress with mother and finaly got my apointment all just before I head out with friends.
So, maybe over the weekend of Tokonatsu I can try dressing and not just in cosplay.  I dont have many clothes unfortunatly.
Oh well.  I can but try.

Jazz, I need your surport, really!
Thankyou

"event","I feel worse then I did those weeks ago.

I'd just managed to balance my emotions, to control myself, I was on top of it and willing to wait.
All was good.

But then my fucking parents.  WHY
Did tehy not think that I'd tell them it when I was ready.
THe fuckwitts!

Now I've got it back on my mind and felt crap, felt frantic about how much I hate what I am and how every second gone by is a wasted second to a life I could be living.  But cant.

But that's not whats worse, thats what got my started.  I managed to surpress my horrivle perspective, my overwhelming impatience!
I went back to the forums and found a chat room seeking solice and got it.

What I also got was information I could have done without, someone who is 15years older then me but went through the same sort of rout I seem to be going.
And from where I am it was over 3years before they even go to Touch Hormones!

I WILL be on Hormones by age 20 if I have to fucking self medicate.  
I dont want to self medicate, it fucks up your chances at getting it on the NHS

Here's a tale I was told;

<Emma_J> well i can tell you a cautionary tale about an ex friend of mine
<Emma_J> well this person went to the GIC.....................
<Emma_J> but she thought she could be clever and take Mones before the GIC approved them..............
<Emma_J> and when she went for her second appointment ...................
<Emma_J> they told her to stop and get a blood test done in 3 months and then wait another 6 months for another appointment
<Emma_J> so she could hyad mones in 2 months if she didn't self med now she had to wait 9 months
<Emma_J> my advice is be patient

I have an impossible desicion!  I have over 2 years before I can get to that point itself and thats time enough to change alot on homrones but at what risk?!
Or Do I wait.  I cant wait.

This, honestly, is the first assertive thing I've ever done in my life, the first thing I've ever done to improve my own life.

I have no ambition, I have no sex drive, no energy for life, the only thing I've ever put energy into is escaping my life.  
I need to do something for my life!  Maybe once I start on my vision will clear and I'll become a functioning person and not this emotionaly stunted pawn of the world.  This piece of shit.

AND I GET PUT ON A FUCKING WAITING LIST!

How thef uck to I continue!
I just want to stop

Why cant I be fucking stronger
All I can hear are the words my last councellor 'What, How fragile are you!""  It was sort of his fucking catch phrase!  He said it over and over again,
That fucking pshycology dosent work shit for brains!  That only hurts more.

I'm an utter slave to such crap emotions and I cant do anything about it, I'm isolated in my life and am just going through the motions of life.

"event","Just a quick update, I might get around to writing it in full some other time, but here it is.

Was playing on the computer today and got called downstairs, both my mother and father where there wanting to talk.
They do this often.  No surprise
What did take me off balance was, after the obligatory 'sit down', 'we want to talk' and my 'what have I done now' came;

""We want to talk about you dressing.""

..

I'm sure I whent white as a sheet.

..

Well, talked a bit and they said stuff, surprisingly surportive stuff.  They'd done a fair bit of research on the net apparantly.
They said how they knew they could never understand whats in my head and how they knew it was my own business, but urged how much doing anything would effect them and their jobs and such.
My mother tried to convince me that she wouldnt think any less of me if I just released the feelings by crossdressing randomly, and stuff.  They wondered if thats why I went to london and also questioned a friends true gender (which amused me highly) and stuff.

Talking about it like this it sounds al really possitive, but it was half warning, half we'd like to surport you and know about it all.
The first of which I cant think of how describe.

I told them I was in councelling and stuff and trying to get my head straight about it all, muchly underplaying how certain I am about what I want, beacuse, well, yeah.

It took me by suprise but it wasn't like it was something I'd put past them, almost.
I'd taken no real pains to hide some of the new clothes I'd bought with friends, knowing my mother would trip over them and not really approch me about, but had some vain hope that that'd soften the blow when I did tell them.

After that the talk went onto my future, jobs, more eductaction and all that stuff.
They're of the opinion I should either upgrade to a full time job or go and get eductation in some creative field.
None of which I have a clue about, which is ever more pressure.

So, there you go.  Damn"

"event","Well, the councellor I went to see today, I found out what he actually is.

He's a Mental Health advisor, diagnosy person.  I dont know his actual title since I didnt actually ask.
But yeah,
That guy is just there to find out what is wrong with me, and reffer me on to the right people.

I'm now on a 4-6week waiting list for a 'Psychosexual Councellor'.
That really dosnt sound promising.

The councelloing itself today, I got nothing from, absolutly nothing.  I was glad of the Human contact, but that was about it.

Now I just need to cope with the waiting and Isolation somehow."

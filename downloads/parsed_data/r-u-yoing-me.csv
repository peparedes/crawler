"event","hobo ryan here bringing u bracking news
today was the first day of school booooooooooooooooooo! in august wat the heck this is wicked anoyying it usally actully has never started in august!!!!!!this is really annoying because bth of my sisters start after me ahhhhhhhhhhhh! any way r new L.A. teacher is pretty cool even though his name makes him sound really really geeky he is still cool.  it reall sucks that ms. calise is our math teacher because mrs. juneau let us do anything.  so that was my first day. it was really boring and bad unlike the last day of summer. the last day was full of excitment because sean zack and i got to gether and had a jolly good time we mostly rode bikes but we made this wicked cool movie that was about a taxi driver and the moffia. it was really fun after we watched it we started to ride bikes and since seans sister kt did not hav one zack gav her a a ride on the back of his bike while sean and i rode to other bikes i rode mine and sean rode zacks sisters it was way cool. then it started to rain and we rode around the circle in the rain it was a lot of fun then we went in seans garage dithced our bikes and ran around the neighborhood w/ no shoes we all hoboed in the rain except for kt. it was lots of fun.

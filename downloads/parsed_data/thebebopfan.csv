"event","I had a job interview Monday!  *w00t*  Very exciting!  Especially considering I've had my resume out in the world for about a month and a half now.  Though I wasn't as aggressive at first because I thought I already HAD a job when I moved up here.  Hooray for miscommunications with Dad and Co.!   Oh well.
Either way, it's a Mortgage Lending company...I know I can't seem to get away from financial jobs...but it's a great opportunity for me...so Yay!

I went to the Breaking Benjamin concert in Atlanta, GA right afterwards with Hunter.  We got to spend a lovely seven hours in the car together.  Talking about dishware vs. china.  Hehehe it was funny.  I really love that man.

We met up with D.J. (a friend of Hunter's from Asbury, he's the best man) and ate Chinese beforehand.  There was a group of Japanese behind us, so I spent most of the time trying to eavesdrop.  Not successfully, they were all males and using a dialect I had never heard before...plus a lot of what I'm assuming was slang.

Then the concert!  It was at a great venue called the Tabernacle.  Really neat place, five stories, three balconies and standing room on the ground floor.  Awesome chandelier too!  The opening bands were Red and Sick Puppies.  I had never heard Red before, but they were pretty good and I had had the privilage of hearing Sick Puppies at the opening of the Flyleaf concert I went to earlier this summer.  Great band!  Y'all should definitely check them out!

Then it was time for the main event, we were all getting really excited, Hunter, D.J. and I went to the ground floor for some moshing (I never moshed before so it was going to be interesting) and then....then.......

Some guy gets onstage and says ""Due to an ongoing illness, Breaking Benjamin will be unable to perform.  blah blah blah refund blah blah reschedule blah"".

Say what????

At first I thought he was joking.  Like it was just some sick joke they wanted to play on all of us or something.  Nope.  The real deal.  So some people left.  Others threw things on the stage.  We stuck around for about twenty minutes...

ANGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We drove for seven hours to see that band!  ARG!!!!  Though I'm not blaming BB or the Tabernacle.  I'm blaming whoever was supposed to call the Tabernacle AHEAD OF TIME and let them know that the lead singer had an ONGOING ILLNESS!!!  ARRRRRRR!!!!!

Okay, anyways, we went to the shake of the steak n' and had some milkshakes.  Then Hunter and I drove home.  We got back at about 4:30am.  Fun times.

I enjoyed myself all in all, because that was the most I had seen Hunter in weeks, and I love hanging out with D.J....but come on!

My friend Abby invited me to see the premier of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Tuesday evening.  IT WAS AWESOME!!!!  So incredibly good!  Everyone must see it right now!  Definitely my favorite!  And it's crazy cool to think that I'm one of the first people to see it!  Besides the original premier in Japan that is.  But we saw it at 7pm, not midnight.  FUN!  I was really happy that Abby asked me to go!  It made me feel all special.

That's really all my news right now.

P.S.  D.J. loaned us some of his CDs for the trip back, including the Minutes to Midnight album.  It's pretty good, not as good as Meteora.  I really like three of the songs, and I kinda' like some of the others.  I really dislike at least two downright.  The only thing is that it's so Anti-Bush I have problems listening to the lyrics.  So I'm not sure if it's worth buying."

"event","Hmmmm.  What to say, what to say?  Strange, I have never been truly happy since 2004.  The year I started college.  A lot of other things happened then too.  Of course, I was also nineteen, so more responsibilities came my way.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I'm depressed now or any other such nonsense.  In fact, I can honestly say that this is the happiest I have been since Asbury!!!  Asbury was the worst time of my life, hands down.  I really shouldn't blame the college.  After all the reason for my depression was related more to matters of the heart than school.  But being at that place certainly helped to keep me down.

I've decided that people don't just get a few turning points in their whole life.  After all, I've had three or four this year alone!  Some of them may be small, but two of them are ones that I will never, ever be able to forget!  Namely Greece, and getting engaged.
Wow, Hunter proposed!  Really, it's not that I'm surprised seeing as we had been to pre-marital counseling and we had talked about getting married for a long time beforehand.  But the fact that we are finally engaged is amazing!  Especially when I think about how much we went through to get to this point!

Funny, I still prefer sad songs to happy ones.  Then again, I always have, even when I was a little kid.  I can't relate to them anymore, not in the strict sense of the word.  I can relate them to other times in my life.  But definitely not now.  ^.^

I still have theme songs for the day, or week, in case you were wondering.  But they don't translate directly into what my mood or feelings of the day are.  Now it's just whatever song I feel the need to listen to that is my theme.  Things are always changing.

I'm going to be working again soon.  Very happy about that, though not in the gleeful sense of the word.  More in the relieved sense really.  I was starting to worry.  Though it seems as though I will have the choice of a few different companies.  I need a job, and because I need one I want one.  But I don't really want it.  Hahaha, strange I know.  Nobody I know who is my friend would like me if I weren't myself though.
Which is why there are people who I no longer call 'friend'.  I was too much like myself.

God has blessed me with some truly beautiful friends.  For that I will never be able to thank Him enough!

I miss my church.  I love St. Andrews!  But I need to give St. Michaels another shot.  I just can't get into the service there.  The choir is too good.  It's like a concert instead of worship.  What's the point?  I'm not going to Liturgy merely to be entertained.  The word Liturgy translates into the work of the people.  That doesn't mean choir and altar servers.  That means the entire body of the church!  Christ's bride!  Every person there should be celebrating Liturgy.  That's why I hate it when I feel like I'm being excluded.  Even at the monasteries in Greece I knew that I was a part of the worship.  Sure, it was in a language that I do not understand, but I was still worshipping!  At St. Michaels it's so hard to concentrate!  Granted, at St. Andrews I was in the choir, so I have to pay attention the whole time.  But I've sat in the pews before and not had a problem.  *sigh*

I miss Hunter.  T.T  It's hard enough being an hour and a half away from each other!  I can't imagine living further apart.  Some of my friends, who are having to do so right now, have earned my respect for managing it!  I do like Louisville on the whole, however.  I've been able to reconnect with one of my friends whom I've known since I was a baby.  Very grateful for that!  Really, I've been more social since moving to L'ville.  Makes me wish that Katie could be here.

People are intriguing.

I've been reading like a fiend lately.  Ever since school let out.  I've missed books!  I've read about six books so far...no...seven.  But now I need another one, and I can't seem to find anything else on my bookshelf to wet my appetite.  I don't want to re-read anything right now, because this is one of the only opportunities I will have to read new books!  The other seven were all new except one.  I borrowed some from the library, had bought some last year but was never able to read them and found some on my parent's bookshelves.  Now I'm at a loss.  I must get a membership to the library here in town before it's too late!!!!  Must...read...more...books!!!
Hehehe.  I love stories.  But only stories where I can actually admire the characters.  Which is why I couldn't stand the books I had to read for my Japanese art class.  None of the characters were worth anything.  Of course everybody has faults.  But they didn't have any virtues to make up for their faults!
Probably one of the reasons why I love fantasy novels.  Because there is always at least one hero who has to save the world.  I like that.  One of the reasons why I love the Final Fantasy video games.  Because the characters always have to save the world.  Hahaha, oh how ideallic I am!  I think I will re-read the Honor Harrington series.  Once I've read some other new books that is.

I guess that's all that's going through my mind right now.  No...not really.  There is more floating around, but I'm done sharing."

"event","I was talking on the phone yesterday with my Mom.  We've gotten a lot closer now that I'm getting older and Mom doesn't really need taking care of.  She's feeling infinitely better and only has a bad day every now and then if that.  My parents have recently moved to Louisville, which is about an hour and fifteen minutes away.  Dad is now the doctor/director for an accident therapy clinic and his two bosses have big plans for him.  They also have an anti-aging clinic in the works.  To hear Dad talk about his current job and future plans, I think he and Mom will do just fine.  :)  They are also attending the Orthodox church in Louisville and the head priest (there are four alltogether) is going to build an Orthodox school!  Very exciting!  He wants to make Dad the board director or whatever the head person is over a school, which is nifty if you ask me.  Also, it's a great opportunity for Hunter down the road, if he does end up teaching.
By the way Hunter is now Orthodox!  *YAY*  He was chrismated on Holy Saturday, the day we celebrate Pascha.  Very cool.
My brother has started going to the gym with my uncle and being more active in general.  It's done wonders for him!  He's much more social and outgoing, and even though he still needs his cave time, I see him going out more often.  Big improvement!  He is still and out of work actor, but some things are staples in life.  ;)
My sister is now a waitress at Regatta, a seafood restaurant under a huge bookstore.  She and I have been living together for the past four months or so.  We get along a lot better now too.  She still borrows my stuff without asking, but she's gotten a lot better and only does it once in awhile.  Which is fine, sometimes a person needs a type of shirt for an outfit to work and the only person around who has said shirt is at work.  So for the sake of the outfit, that shirt must be borrowed even if asking is impossible.  That's cool with me!  Hehe.
On the downside I've also lived with another roommate for the past four months who I just don't get along with whatsoever period.  There is no meshing of the brain cells with this girl!  She and I are on completely different wavelengths.  It doesn't help that I love her family which has known mine since before we were a family.  (Dad's college roommate).  *sigh*  I get along with this roommate okay if her fiancee isn't around.  But on the flipside, I get along with her fiancee pretty well if she isn't around.  I just can't stand them together!  Ugh it's annoying!  Not that they're lovy-dovy or anything like that.  It's just difficult to withstand the power of two annoying people at the same time.  Unlucky for me, the fiancee is at my house...oh...all day.  I wake up, he's here.  I go to bed, he's here.  I really think he's just spending the night.  Which is something else that bothers me.  It's like, come on people!  Most of the couples I know either already are living together, or are planning on it, or spend the night with eachother.  WHAT HAPPENED TO PURITY?!?!?!?!!?  I'm not saying that all these couples are having sex.  But I do know that it is a lot harder to keep from having sex if the object of your affection is constantly around.  I know that I wouldn't be able to 'restrain' myself.  Urg, it's just...sad.
Moving on.  I'm pretty sure everyone who reads this already knows, but just in case, Hunter and I are engaged!!!!! EEEEEEEEE!!!!!! TEEHEE TEEHEE TEEHEE!!!!!!!  *Does happy dance*
It's awesome!  I'm so excited for the future (as well as today)!  He proposed at St. George's in Athens, Greece.  St. George's is a church (that is now closed due to tourists) that sits on the highest vantage point in Athens.  From that spot you can see the entire city and let me just say it's breathtaking!  The city is HUGE!
The reason we were in Greece was for a missions trip this Spring break.  Hunter and I, along with eleven other college students and Fr. Stephen, our team leader, traveled to Greece and helped multiple monasteries with any labor that they needed done.  We stayed with two different monasteries, The Holy Cross and the Twelve Apostles (both of which are more like convents) and we also worked at the Moni Petras monastery, which is completely male.  We met some of the most Godly and spiritually uplifting people there!  I am ready to go back whenever the chance is given again.  I love all of the people, not only the monastics, that we met while over there, and I know that I will always have a home in Greece.  It's pretty amazing!  I also made lifelong friends with my fellow students, Larissa, Stephanie, Dale, Jamil, Robyn, Dave, Norma, Jordan and Robyn.  Also, Fr. Chyrsostom a heiromonk from the monastery in Jerusalem, acted as our tour guide because he is one of the original founders for many of the monasteries we worked at.  Not only them, but the Clark family, who lives in Athens but also goes to the monasteries during the summer helped us out tremendously.  Especially Demetri, our very own Greek brother.  He is the 2nd eldest in the Clark family (of five boys) and is now sixteen.  It was great having him along because he was always willing to teach us Greek words and he knew all of the monastics already.  We met a sister named Ignatia, who I used to know as someone else back when I went to the Antiochian Village for camp every summer.  She was an amazing example of the monastic life.  Very helpful, always cheerful, when asked to do something she went without asking why.  Just a great woman.
When we worked at the Moni Petras monastery we also made friends with a younger heiromonk named Fr. Simeon.  (He is thirty)  He taught us how to read byzantine chant, and also taught us how to obey.  Every word from his mouth came straight from God.  But a more humble person you could not find.  We asked him to come with us to Athens, and after asking his monastic leader's permission he came!  He walked with us through the city and also led us to St. George's.  By the way, everyone on the trip knew that Hunter was going to propose.  Except me!  (And Larissa, but that was purely be accident).  So we ended our final evening in Athens and after Hunter proposed we all went to a little bar to celebrate.  Fr. Simeon, Stephanie, Dale, Larissa, Robyn, Jamil, Dave and Norma all went.  It was an extremely happy day!  I was pretty much floating on cloud nine the whole time.  Hahaha!
Anyhoo, the long and short is that it was amazing and anyone who has the chance should go.
Hunter and I are planning our wedding, and Mom is being an amazing help!  We also have a wedding planner, Michele, who really knows her stuff.  So we're getting married in December, and we already have a place to be married (our church of course), a reception site, a photographer, a caterer (included with the reception site because it's a hotel), the wedding party....oh and I have a pretty dress.  *teehee*  :D
Really, that's where I'm going to stop.  I was going to write about what my Mom and I were talking about, but I'm in a good mood now and I'd rather not bring it down.  (Just about stress and how for the most part I'm not really a happy person...due to stress).  So maybe later.
Real quick, I'm moving to Louisville too.  Actually, I will be moving next week and I will be working for my Dad's boss fulltime this summer and fall and hopefully onward.  They have offered me triple what I make now....yeah...and I would be helping Dad out.  Basically, they need someone they can actually trust to do their job, and that's where I come in.  I've now had four jobs, and every one of them has been sad that I've left.  Three of them have tried to convince me to stay with promises of whatever.  But working with Becky, the evil assistant manager, pretty much made me hate life and caused me to be depressed.  Funny thing is, I'm not the only one.  Every teller there right now has talked with me about how hard it is to work under Becky.  It's not a good situation.
So the job with Dad's 'company' is a Godsend!  I am a little worried about it in the sense that I still don't know what my exact job description will be, but they know my qualifications and so they know what I'm capable of.  Which means they're going to give me a job that I can actually do.
Yuppers.
It's finals week.  bleh.
I LOVE HUNTER!  TEEHEE!!!

"event","Oh man.  I'm glad yesterday is over!  The long and short of it is that I'm now sick and I had an exam as well as having to turn in a speech (in Japanese) yesterday.  But I still had work.  So work from 7:45 to 12:45 (luckily I stayed 30 minutes later on Tuesday) and then back again from 4 to 6:15.  BUT!  The good news is that I still had 4 personal hours left, so they let me leave work at 9AM to study for my exam.  *whew*  The reason this was such a big deal is becasue the previous night I had stayed up until 2:30AM finishing the speech.  I hadn't started studying for the exam yet.  *dun dun dun*  What gets me is that this past week and weekend I was constantly studying and doing schoolwork.  Hunter commented that in the two classes I'm taking I have just as much homework as a student taking 15~16 hours.  Yeah, so that makes me feel really bad for the full time students in my class!
Anyhoo, after work I still had to go to tutoring.  So I stayed for about forty minutes, because by this time I was feeling terrible.
On the way home, I happen to get into a car wreck.
yeah.
Yesterday was the first cold day of the season.  It wasn't very fun for me.  I still feel terrible, and I was at work for 9 hours and 45 minutes today, which isn't long to some people, but that's longer than anybody else at the bank.  Anyways, back to last night.
My car is totalled.  The whole front of it is smashed in, so that the car starts at the tires.  My airbags deployed.  Apparently when airbags go off, there's a lot of powder and fumes 'cause I couldn't breathe.  I got out of the car as quickly as possible!  The fumes were unbearable!
So yeah.  Three car car wreck.  My was the most damaged, and I was in the back so guess who's at fault?  Me.  Yup.  (Silly me, I was looking over my shoulder to get into the left-hand turning lane and didn't think that traffic would abruptly stop without a stoplight being near!)
The good news is that everyone is okay!  I'm so glad for that!
So Dad and I are going car shopping tomorrow after I get off work.  I really don't want to.  I just want to sleep.  But, it's necessary.  I can't live the life I lead without a vehicle and my parents are moving this weekend.  So gotta' get a car ASAP.  Tanoshimi ne?  (Fun, isn't it?)
There's a party for JCIKS tonight.  I feel like a bad president for not being there.  But I have a fever, and no car.
So there.
All the money that I've been saving since I got my job?  Yeah, it's all going to go towards a car.  sweet.
Oh well, it's just one of those things.  Part of me wants to cry, but really I'm more stressed about school than I am about the car.  I know that I'll be able to save more money.  Not as much as I planned, but still.
My birthday is next Thursday.  *woohoo*  I'll be taking some vacation time from work.  Very, very excited!  ^-^
Either way, I'm really getting sleepy.  So I'm going to cut this short.
Oh yeah, and things are going well as far as life goes.  In the grand cosmic scheme of things anyway.  :)  What I have right now, and what I hope to have in the future makes what I'm doing w/ work and school well worth it.  I mean completely worth it!
Good night all!
KATIE
I CALLED YOU!
LIKE FIVE WEEKS AGO!!!!!!!
ARE YOU OKAY?!?!?!?!?!?!?  IS EVERYTHING GOING WELL WITH YOU!?!?!?!?!??!  PLEASE CALL ME!!!!!!!"

HI!  How are you?  I'm good thanks.
Very tired, very busy....but what else is new?
Working full time sucks on the one hand, but the paychecks are nice.  At least half of them are going into a savings account.  And, once I save enough money up, I'm going to upgrade my account to one that sweeps all extra funds into stocks etc. overnight and on the weekend and then goes back in the account during the week for use.  Yeah.  It's risky...kinda'.  But the account only takes X amount of dollars out OVER what the base amount is.  Say the base amount is 1000.00, then if there's 1100.51 the account will 'sweep' out 100.51 to invest.  So you could lose that 100.51....or you may gain .50 .  Which doesn't sound like a lot, but when you consider how interest works and how it usually accrues once a month, .50 twice a month is more than most savings accounts.
Yeah, sorry.  It's the banker in me.
My new nickname at work is ""The gun show"".  That or Shogun warrior if I'm really rockin'.  Hahaha.
Yeah, it's this new fangled notion called 'doing your job' that earns you nicknames like that.  Basically, because I actually work, I'm getting a lot more recognition than most.  Sad isn't it?
I met with my sorta' faculty advisor today to discuss my major.  He suggested I think about emphasizing my topic on the anthropology aspect.  Which would mean having Inoue sensei instead of Slaymaker sensei as my faculty advisor.  Which doesn't bother me, because Slaymaker, while nice, is scatter-brained and all about feminism and France.  (He's kinda' strange).  Plus, Inoue is actually Japanese.
Right now I'm still wanting to do something involving translating, though I know I wouldn't mind a job teaching Japanese, or English to the Japanese...though that would require more English classes....BOO!!!!  I really, really, really dislike English classes.  And essays, and papers, and anything involving writing for someone else.  Which is ironic seeing as my final project is a 40 page paper.  But, it's on a topic of my choosing and it covers my entire college career of Japanese studies.  So there's a lot of stuff to put into it.  *yay*
I've been getting JCIKS going.  The club is now an official UK organization!  YATTA!  Plus we just got access to a website, and I have a member of the club who is willing to take care of getting it set up and doing upkeep.  Sweet.  I love delegating.  Heh.
That Japanese students this year are a lot friendlier than last year.  Meaning that they aren't as shy, and will actually hang out with the club members.
Three girls, two guys.  All of them are nice!  Two of the girls came to church with me last Sunday...that was an experience to say the least.  One of them, Tsukasa, asked me what Fr. Tom was saying...the whole service.  That was difficult to explain for sure!
Dance rehearsals are going well.  One of the guys from my Japanese class and JCIKS is dancing with us to help pick up the slack since *sniff* Timothy is gone away to school.  *sob*  I don't want to make Hunter dance, especially since he wouldn't be my partner if he did.  (Height difference, while in normal life doesn't matter, looks bad when putting on a dance performance).  *sigh*
My parents will be moving to Louisville in the not so distant future.  Not quite sure when, they are looking at houses over there now.  But they want to keep a place in Lexington for the weekends.  Dad teaches Sunday school, and they really want to stay at St. Andrews Orthodox instead of going to St. Michaels.  So they will let me live at the small house/duplex/condo/apartment/whatever in Lexington.  They'll probably get a 2-bedroom place.  Hopefully it won't be too big, I won't like the thought of living in a big place by myself.  Especially since I won't be there very often, and I'll be paying the bills.  I'll also be paying rent.  My parents don't know this, but that's neither here nor there.
It's September 13th, a mere three weeks into school and I've already studied more than I ever did last year.  AND I'm taking half the classes.  Go upper classes!  Woot.
But honestly, it's also because I'm tired of knowing so little.  I'm tired of only getting by with the bare minimum of knowledge to pass Japanese.  I'm tired of people like *jerkfaces* Nick and Phil making me feel embarrassed.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!
Oh wait...I have class tomorrow.  Heh.  Okay, so it's going to take me more than just the will to do better.  That's why I'm studying so much.  Basically, if I'm not at work, school, or church...or doing something JCIKS related, I'm studying.  Occasionally I get to see Hunter, but we're back to the sad state of me working days and him working nights.  And of course, the one night he has off for sure is the Adult Education classes at church.  Kinda' required for catechumins!  (I have no idea how to spell that).  I'm really glad that he's going to that, and that he's going through the process of becoming Orthodox, so I don't mind too much.  It just stinks sometimes.  But once the heritage festival at church ends, we'll have Sunday afternoons, on days he doesn't work.  And the occasional Saturday or Monday evening.
Oh, by the way...
Did I mention that we've started Pre-Marital counseling?  Yeah.
Last Sunday was our first...session?  I'm hesitant to use that word becuase it's not really a session feel.  It's more like we're having lunch with a learned person who is helping us out.
That's not really it either...difficult to explain.  Either way, she's really nice.  She was actually an Episcopalien (don't know how to spell that either) priest before coming to the Orthodox church.  She had quite a few reasons for leaving the priesthood and the Episcopal church.  Her emphasis though, was on marital and pre-marital counseling, so yay us!  Very lucky.
Anyways, no we're not engaged.  It would be foolish to get engaged right now, because we really can't afford to be married!  Plus we need to do the counseling first.  It's important to make sure that we really are good for each other, and also to find out what th elittle...annoying habits are before it festers and rots away at our cores for 20 years, making each of us more and more bitter towards the other, though never knowing why.  Hehehe, okay that may be a little extreme...maybe just 15 years.  ^.~
Plus, being engaged is as good as married in the Orthodox church.  i.e. You can't just break it off.
But either way, I'm really excited!  :D
If y'all could just be praying for us, we would greatly appreciate it!  I'm praying for all of you.  :)
Goodnight!"

WAHOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
:)

It's really cool.  I mean, I've obviously never dated someone for a year.  Or half a year for that matter.  So I feel...I dunno, proud? of us??  I guess that's the right word to use.
Either way, he still makes me giddy with happiness.  *teehee!*
I think the best thing about our relationship right now is that we have goals set out in front of us that we're both working towards together.  We're not just dating.  Does that make sense?  *shrug*  It does to me.
While I would ramble on and on about how awesome he is, I really do have to go.  So y'all should count yourselves lucky!  ^_~

"event","Heylo all!  It is once again time for an update.  *YAY*
Things are going well at work.  I'm starting to get a feel for what's required/expected of me (though I'm still confused with a great many things!)  >.<  Hopefully the training seminars will help to clarify.
I'm trying to save up as much money as is possible. It can be hard at times though.  Especially when people like my sister want me to go out and do all sorts of expensive things.  *sigh*  The good thing is that I do have a goal in mind, and I think it is quite achievable.  It's always a bad idea to set a goal that you don't think you can achieve.  Hurts the morale and what not.  Heh.
Aikido is definitely different now that Craig's in charge!  The changes are for the best, but the classes and requirements are a lot tougher.  I know I can do it...but it's so hard!  Basically, I'm having to unlearn everything and start over.  Even though Craig is letting all the old Ronin Bushido members keep their ranks, most of the newbies are better than us!  Which says something for Craig's teaching.  But anyhoo, just need to keep at it and do my best.  That's all that anyone can ask for.
THe more I think about it, the more excited I am for next semester.  It's going to be so hard, but so fun!!  What's funny is that I'm also ready for it to be over.  Mixed sentiments are difficult to live with, that's for sure!  I'm meeting with the other JCIKS officers tomorrow evening after work, so that's good.  I really hope that I do well as the president.  I hope that the club helps out students, and is also fun for people.  I am a little nervous though...oh well!  We shall see what will happen!
I gave my friend Ducky a driving lesson yesterday.  It was one of the first times that she has actually driven, so she was a little hesitant.  But, I think she did really well!  It seems like all she really needs is time behind the wheel, which she won't get except for our lessons.  Poor Ducky!  But it went well and we're going to have a lesson every Monday, at least for the rest of the Summer.  Exciting!  I really hope that I can help her out!
So y'all want to hear a funny story?  Okay!  On July 4th Hunter and I decided to get (illegal) fireworks from OH.  And hey, since we'd already be up there, why not visit three or four of our friends that live in the general Cinci neighborhood???  ROADTRIP!
A lot of fun, I must say.  I always enjoy spending time with Hunter (duh) and it's especially fun when I get to spend the whole day with him!  So we head off, we meet our friends at their places of work and/or homes and get our fireworks.  Fun times, fun times.
Here's where the story comes in; the whole trip my car was making a strange noise, but it had been making that noise for a couple of months now.  It's also a noise that I had a mechanic check out when it first started up.  Said mechanic told me that there was nothing wrong, and it should be fine to drive.
Well.....yeah.....kinda'.  It lasted me about three-four months...so in a way he was right.
Anyways, while Hunter and I were getting off on an exit ramp in search of much needed food (skyline to be exact) the front driver's side tire + wheel POPPED off!!!
Yup.
It popped off.
Not fell off.
Popped.
While we're coming to a somewhat screeching halt, we both watch as the tire bounces down the exit ramp and on around a bend in the road...never to be seen or heard from again.
....we started to laugh, really hard!
It was so hilarious!  I can just imagine that tire hitting a person!!!  (which is terrible of course, but funny nonetheless!)
So, needless to say we were kinda' stranded.  And hungry.  And holding fireworks that we wanted to set off dangit!
So long story short (too late) my brother came and got us and we called a tow truck (a very nice tow truck man too, not creepy like all the other ones I've experienced) and went on our merry way.
The end.
I'm still waiting on my car to be fixed.  It should be drivable tomorrow, so I'll probably pick it up from Cinci over the weekend.  ROADTRIP!
From there, I have no idea what I'm going to do with it.  Apparently the actual wheels on my car are not Toyota brand, and are in fact very difficult to find.  So the mechanic/tow truck dude couldn't find one to match, and I can't quite afford to replace four wheels in one go.  Oh well, that's just the way things go.
So here are my thoughts for the day (while I was on my 3PM lunch break...they kinda' forgot about me until I reminded them that I was hungry.  Hahaha)
""...I have a lot of things to do right now.  It feels like I'll never get them done too.  I just wish I could work as long as I need to so that I could actually finish my 'chores'.  *sigh*  Plus in my personal life, I definitely feel like I'm playing 'catch-up' especially in the social department.  I just need to focus and prioritize.  What needs to be done today?  What can I complete tomorrow?
It's like I'm reaching for a goal and never quite getting there.  I have this notion that as soon as I finish my to-do list and finally get caught up I'll be ble to rest.  Which isn't true.  The world will always need some sort of job done for it after all.
It's not that I don't like staying busy.  Indeed, I wouldn't know what to do with myself if there weren't something more to do.  But it is nice to get a break every now and then.  The only problem with that is whenever I'm on a break, all I can think about is all the stuff I have to get done after my break!  ARG!!!!!  I just need to relax and be in the moment.  It's not like my thinking about something will make it go away.  Either way, it's time for me to go back to work....""
Yuppers.
Having said that though, I've been very busy making stuff this summer.  I'm not done with all of my projects, but so far I've made a pair of capris that I sewed sequins on the hems, a pretty necklace and matching set of earrings, another set of earrings for a co-worker who wanted a pair for his mom *aww* and new stands for all of my shoes.  I still want to make an anklet, a bracelet, some more earrings (naturally), another necklace and a purse out of an old pair of jeans.
I've completely murdered the one skirt that I had been working so hard on over the winter.  *sigh*  But now I've learned my lesson.  Always measure things!!!!  Hahaha.
Once I finish everything I'll take pictures.  Because I like to show off the stuff I make.  Prideful, I know.  Sorry.  Heh.
What else, what else, what else...........
Had the 'ole family vacation two weeks ago.  We went to Maine and Hunter came with.  That was awesome!  I actually got to spend an entire WEEK with him!  Sweet.
All in all, I enjoyed the vacation, but I've decided that I don't really like Maine.  It was rather boring.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed sea kayaking and going on a whale watching trip (in which there were no whales, but lots of puffins which are almost as cool)...but I don't like fog.  I especially don't like fog for 7 days straight with one day break...on which day we got on a boat and SAILED INTO THE FOG AGAIN!!!!
So yeah, towards the end of the trip I definitely started feeling meh and disinterested in...well...everything.
But, on the day we left to go back home the sun came out.  Maine is actually a beautiful state!  Y'all should visit...maybe in July when you can actually see more than a mile ahead of you.
I danced tonight.  Just in my room, but still.  It really is so fun!!!
I also cleaned my bathroom and the kitchen.  And I put away the mountain of clothes that I had washed.  Go me!
I feel like I've just touched the surface of all that's going on in my life right now...but it's getting late, and I still have some work to do.  Sorry y'all...I'll try to update this more often!
Farewell for now...

Anyways, hi.  How are you?  I'm good, thanks.
So not too much time, because I (once again) have to go to bed soon.  BUT!
Umm...my summer has been going well.  I've been working a lot, and so nothing has really changed except the fact that I'm not having to go to school and study and be stressed.  It's really nice.  I'm loving it!
I am, however, excited about next semester of school because I will just be studying Japanese, and basically I will be putting my all into learning it.  Plus I'll be doing the whole President of JCIKS thing, which means extra reason for me to know my stuff yo!  word.
Work is going really well for me.  I was offered the opportunity of a promotion, and decided to go ahead and apply for the open position.  (Things have to be done a certain way with JPMorgan, so even though my manager wanted me to take the position, I still had to apply and she still had to interview me as well as one other person who had applied.  Strange, I know).  So I found out today that I got the position, and will officially start my *new* job this Friday.  *YAY*
So that means that instead of being an almost full-time Teller, I will be a definite full-time SSA.  (SSA = Sales and Service Associate).
What's in the job description, you ask?  Well, let me tell you; I will be the person who makes sure that the customers are happy, that we are getting people to open accounts/meet with our Personal Banker (who is a really nice guy, very quite, reserved, calm, and easy-going but he knows his stuff), that my Manager doesn't have to worry about whether this and that document were filed in this spot and so-and-so was called to verify such-and-such etc., mmaking sure that the Assistant Manager (who I don't quite like...for a lot of reasons) doesn't have to worry about the Manager worrying about etc. etc. so that the Ass. Manager (like that?) won't bite people's heads off for breathing and also making sure that the Tellers don't have to deal with irate customers.
Fun!  I'm really excited!  Mainly because I will be working more with my manager (who is very cool) and the pb (personal banker) and the customers, who I actually enjoy for the most part.  Except the stupid people.  But when have I ever liked stupid people?  Exactly.
So yuppers.
I'm not really doing much else.  I've read about five books so far, one of them being 800+ pages long, and have already started the sequel to the 800+ pg book, I've sewed a sequined dragon to a pair of jeans of mine, I've made a pair of capris out of some old jeans and am currently sewing a small layer of iridescent sequins on the hem, I made little sparklies that go in your hair (i.e. rhinestones attached to velcro so they stick onto the hair), and so on and so forth.  :)
I've also been playing some videogames which is nice.  I like video games.
Katie came down to Kentucky to visit me (and technically go to a wedding...but that fell through.  oops) and I got to meet her boyfriend Tim.  He's really nice.  I approve.  :D  And she also got to meet Hunter finally!!!!!  She also approves of Hunter, though I'm still going to let her object if there's a wedding, because she's always wanted to do that.  Heh.
I'm planning on going to see MSI in July, FINALLY OH MY GOSH!!!!  sheesh it took me about three tries...four?  to see them!  I'm very excited!  :D
I'm also planning on visiting Meg-chan from my JPN and Calc classes in the near future, and Hunter and I are going to pay a visit to Lavin to see how the old chap is doing.
My family is going on the traditional family vacation the last week of June and Hunter is actually going to be able to come with us!  *Much elation!!!!*  We're going to Maine, which means that I'll be in the neighborhood of Katie.  and by neighborhood I mean I'll be on the same side of the country.  Hehehe.
I'm still intending to teach Ducky how to drive, though she apparently had some evil things done to her by doctors so has been out of commission for awhile.  Poor Ducky.  :(
And that's really all that's happening this summer!  I hope y'alls summers are going well.
I'm sure I have thoughts and ponderings that I should talk about now, but I'm just too tired to think straight.  Sorry guys.  Hopefully next time.
Goodnight!  God bless!"

"event","So I'm done with school for the semester.  *YAY*  Oh man it hasn't even been a full week and it already feels like a month.  I love not being in school!  Hahaha.
But I'm seriously exhausted right now.  Have been for awhile.  I'm hoping it's just me getting over school.  *fingers crossed*
My grades this semester?  Pretty much what I predicted, A, B, C and D.  Japanese, Economics, Biology and Calculus respectively.  I'm upset with myself to some extent.  I think I could have done better in Econ and Bio.  But at the same time. . . I am glad I got that A in JPN!  So happy about that!
So I keep telling myself that I'm going to update this with all the thoughts that I've been thinking lately, and that I'm going to e-mail everybody I know just to see how they're doing etc.  But then I get home from work, and all I want to do is eat and not think.  Or talk to people.  Either that or I have to go out after work, and not get home until late.  *sigh*

Oh Meg, I'm sorry for not responding earlier to your question.  I work at the one off of Nandino Blvd.  If you want directions you can call me.  I would love to see you!!!  The one thing is that I couldn't actually help you at work, since you're a friend of mine, someone else would have to handle any transactions you might have.  :-\ sorry!

Work is still going well.  It was extremely stressful for me for a stretch of about ten days, but it's not so bad anymore.
I had been having problems balancing at the end of the day, my drawer would be off by say, $50 here, $24 there.  Not so good.  (We're given a $10 leeway).  And on top of that, I had been late a couple of days, and was called into the 'principle's ' office.  Within the first 90 days of being hired anyone who is late three times is put up for possible termination (using their words).  I had up to that point been late four times.  ooops.
What really sucks is that one of those times was because the auditor was there, and I was late by two minutes, which technically doesn't count, but because of the auditor, it did.  Then two of the other times were because I had slept through my alarm.  Really bad.  And the last one was because I got out of class late, and had called to let them know I was going to be late.  But *shrug* whatever.
Anyways, then this Monday I thought I was scheduled at 1:15.  So I leave and give myself enough time to be at work by 1PM just to insure that I'm on time.  Welllllll......I was ACTUALLY scheduled at 12:15PM.  *crud*  But they didn't call me at 12:30 asking where I was.  Nope, they didn't call 'til 12:50, while I was already on my way.  Oh good grief.
Either way, I've officially been written up, and it's in my file, and I have three months.  If in the space of said three months I screw up even ONCE I am fired.  End of story.
Can we say stress much?
Yeah.  But so far so good..........*sigh*
I really need this job.  I need the money, and the stability, and the opportunity for career advancement.
But, it really shouldn't be a problem to show up on time.  I just need to make sure I check the schedule everyday since it does differ.

I got to meet with Christina this past Thursday.  I didn't realize that she would be leaving on Thursday!  It saddened me.  :""(  But we ate breakfast together, and I got to kind of see her off.  (She was going to be meeting another friend of hers for lunch).
I do miss her.  *sigh*  But she seemed to be doing well.  Lot's of stuff going on.  But I'm not too worried about her....just as long as she doesn't take on TOO much at one time!  (I know I know, look who's talking).  ^_~

I want to see Meg.  And I want to talk to Katie.
I'm sorry I haven't called either one of y'all!  I am ashamed.  Hrrrmmmm.
Oooo, that reminds me, Katie, you're still coming to Sarah's wedding right?  It's June 3rd.  I RSVPed (heh, risvpid) that you and Tim were coming.  I figure, it's easier to say too many than too little in cases like this.  June 3rd is a Saturday.  Please let me know!!!!!!  I do so want you to come down!  oh pleeeease!!!!!!!!

Hunter and I went on a DATE yesterday!!!!!  Wow!  Haven't done that in awhile.  *shaky fist at busy schedules*  But hopefully it will happen a little more often, what with the summer and working more hours.  (More hours = more money).

I've been sewing in the free time I can snatch away from other things.  I'm still trying to sew this one pair of pants into a skirt, which shouldn't be hard, I know.  But I think I messed it up early on, and now I don't know if I can fix it.  Doesn't help that the sewing machine is at Rachel's, and the little power cord is missing, which means I have to turn the knob thing by hand.  *shrug*  Meh, oh well.  But yeah, I'm hoping to put little beads on the side in the design of butterflies.  Eeee pretty shiny!!!  I'm also sewing a sequin dragon on a pair of boring jeans I have.  YAY it's cool!  Almost finished actually, so yeah.  I also put rhinestones on a skirt of mine, and am planning on putting them on a pair of old jeans that I've converted into capri's.  (Renovating the old wardrobe into a new one a little).

This is somewhat random, but I've decided to cover my head in church now.  It was weird, but on Good Friday I just felt like that was the right thing to do.  See, I feel like my spiritual life needs more guidance.  So I've been getting into a much more steady habit of reading the bible and saying my morning and evening prayers along with the meals.  I don't really have a problem remembering to pray, it's just that I wasn't really concentrating on what I was praying.  Make sense?  Kinda' like I was only half-way doing it while thinking about other things.  Not good.  But anyways, during the service on Good Friday it just hit me.  See, I'm not humble enough.  Really, I'm not.  And putting a covering on my head is very humbling.  It encourages humility in me, so that's why I do it.

While I'm looking forward to enjoying the Summer, and having time off from school, I'm also somewhat ready to have it over with.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not getting excited about school, but I keep catching myself wanting to fast forward a little.  Which isn't right, I know.  Besides, I do need to enjoy this year for all it's worth.  I feel certain that a lot will happen this year, and next year.  And in a way, I need to enjoy this year for what it is.  If you think about it, it's the last Summer that I'll have like this.  Maybe I'm just noticing that I'm growing up.  But seriously, I'll never have another Summer '06.  Ever.  Unless they make some sort of prolonged aging thing that is mandatory for all humans, and I live to the year 3006....unlikely.  ;)  Plus, I don't know that I would want to live for a thousand years.  Not that I would get bored, but it seems like such a long time!  Then again, life would go slower (hopefully) if that were the case.  Oh well, guess I shouldn't really bother pondering this.  But then, I don't ponder on this, what will I ponder on?
Probably the fifty million other things that Becca ponders and rolls around in it's head.

So I read a fantasy novel that Dad borrowed from the library for Mom.  It was titled the Wayfarer Redemption.  The main reason I read it was because it had a pretty picture on the front, and it happened to be on the table when I sat down to eat a quick bite.  Heh.
But anyways, it was really good!  I mean, I enjoyed the characters, the story held my interest, and it wasn't too long.  Plus it's a trilogy, so it's not too short either!  (there's a fine line).
Well, anyhoo, after finishing said book, I went on-line to find out what the title book 2 was.  Guess what?  Book 2 got horrible reviews.  I mean just terrible!  So I read the synopsis to find out why.  Apparently in the 2nd book the hero of the trilogy breaks a vow to the heroine of the first book to fight for her/marry her, and marries somebody else.  And has two kids.  The somebody else he marries plays a small role in the first book, but was nothing extraordinary.  Whereas the main heroine in book 1 rocked!  She actually is key to the whole ""saving the world"" thing.  i.e. she plays a very important role in the prophecy etc. etc.
I was mad.
Very mad.
So I'm not going to read the 2nd, or 3rd book.  (Before you say anything, yes I checked the 3rd book's synopsis to see if maybe the hero goes BACK to the GOOD heroine...nope.)
I felt sorry for the girl!  Here she marries the hero's half-brother (who she was betrothed to from the start) simply in order to keep the hero alive (the half-brother wants to kill him, so she keeps him from being killed).  She brings the hero BACK TO LIFE after a battle, and when given the chance to cheat on her current husband (the half-brother) she doesn't cheat on him even though she wants to.  All in all, a good person.
The chick who the hero ends up with did rescue two peoples lives, granted.  But it was mainly because she wanted to escape herself.  Then she was also attracted to two other dudes.  And that's really all there is about her.  Oh, okay, so she did convince some people to fight when they are surprise attacked.  But come on!!!!
ugh.  stupid book.

Moving on.
I talked with Dad about this.  I've been tossing the idea of making a CD around.  I really want to do it.  Not sure why.  Maybe it's simply because I miss singing so much!  But also, I want Dad to play for the CD, and definitely compose some stuff.  Also, I think Nathaniel could compose some awesome pieces.  So yeah.  I can't sing pop.  Just doesn't fit my voice.  But I can sing opera and arias.  Which is precisely what I mean to do.  But with a twist.  See, NMB is really good at re-writing music his way.  Well, I want to see if he could possibly take an aria and remix it a little.  Kinda' like the Paul Schwartz CD's.  Y'all may, or may not, know them.  If you haven't heard them, go listen to them!  They are very good!  (Aria, and then New Horizons Aria 2).

Have I mentioned lately how much Hunter and I fit?  It's crazy!  I'm so very lucky.  I don't know how I can ever thank God enough for this gift.  A waitress actually came up to us and told us how cool it was that we were such happy people.  She was telling all her co-workers to come over and meet the happy people.  I don't think they realized how much of it had to do with the fact that we were with eachother.  Not saying that I'm not happy when Hunter's not around...but I don't think it shines through as much (to use someone else's adjective).  People are always telling me that the whole giddy happiness thing will wear off eventually...but part of me doesn't believe them.  Don't get me wrong.  I know that we won't always be the way we are now.  (i.e. barely able to contain the excitement of getting to see each other).  But at the same time, it's been 10 months.  10 months that feels like years.  In a good way.  Maybe I'm just being idealistic, but I see him and my heart goes *kerfwallop* every time.  It's not the buzzing ""oh my gosh, oh my gosh he finally noticed me!  We're finally together!!!"" excitement like when we first started dating, hehe.  It's a subtle thing.  But there is more depth to the excitement.  And an almost overwhelming happiness to boot.
It's kind of sad too.  I don't really talk about this too much with other people, because a lot of them think that I'm condescending to them.  That's not the case at all!  It's hard to describe these feelings.  And they make me so happy, why wouldn't I want to talk about them?  But, some people....some people don't like hearing about things that they aren't experiencing too.  Which, in a way, I can see why.  I mean, who wants to listen to someone talk about something that they haven't experienced?  If they haven't experienced it, then they can't fully understand it.  And no, that's not me sneering saying ""Haha look at me!  I'm so much wiser blah blah blah"".  Not the case at all.  It would be the equivalent of one person talking about how awesome their first taste of sugar was and consequent tastes after, to a person who has never had it.  Not fun for either person.  But who wants to live in a world where everyone is on the same level, at the same pace?  Too boring.  I wouldn't be able to draw on those who went before me's experience.  I wouldn't be able to offer advice to others.
Strange thought.

Well, that's all that's going to come out of me tonight.
Sleep well all, God bless.

Oh well.
So yeah, studying.  A lot.  And stuff.  Loads of fun, let me tell ya'!  Meh.
I'm extremely worried about my Calculus final, but then, all I need is 30 out of 90 points to raise my grade up to...a C!  WOOOO go me!!!!!  :P""
Then there's Biology.  I don't have any clue what grade I have right now.  I think I have a high C or low B.  So I can theoretically get an A in that class if 1: I do well on the final, and 2: the curve in the class is high.  poopie.
Economics?  Yeah, probably going to come out with a B.  I got a B on two of the quizzes, and an A on the other.  On one of the exams I received a C, and on the other an A.  So I just don't know!
And then there's Japanese.  My saving grace, right?  Well.  Yeah, I guess.  I have an 88% in the class right now.  Which translates (get it???) into me needing 100 points out of a possible 105 on the final.  blarg.  The final in JPN is actually optional, so I'm taking it.  See, it won't hurt my letter grade if I don't do well, but I could possibly bump myself up to an A.  Which I desperately need!!!!!  But the good news is that Fiona sensei is letting me turn in some homework that I missed (because I was sick one day and uber depressed the other) to help raise my grade.  YATTA!  YAY!  Which is what I'm doing right now.  Coincidentally enough these are the two harder homework assignments.  buggers.
Watched Howl's Moving Castle last night with Hunter, Nathaniel, Kerryn and Cassie.  It was so good!  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, though I did start to fall asleep towards the end.  Heh.  Kerryn wants me to get an apartment with her next Fall....yeah.  Not very sure yet.  I told her I would think about it.  But I just don't know what I'm doing next Fall except work and school.  I mean, yeah.  Sorry, this doesn't make much sense.  *shrug*  I'm tired and my brain is frizzled.  Yes, frizzled.
I kept calling the assistant manager at work 'Sarah' when her name is actually 'Becky'.  I've been there for over two months now.  Very tired indeed.  (Sarah wasn't even there).
I'm running for the presidency of JCIKS (the JPN tutoring group I'm in)!  Awesomeness to the extreme!  I already have a lot of ideas for what the club could do to get attendance up.  (Like one evening session, and then a Saturday afternoon or Sunday afternoon session).  Also, once a month we're going to go out and do something FUN!  As well as once a month having a movie night.  Japanese movie of course, with English subtitles.  Or maybe an English movie with Japanese subtitles...if those exist!
Anyhoo, need to get my nose back to the grind.  BYE BYE!"

So today is not going so great.  This morning, afternoon and evening all have their list of things wrong with them.  I hate to complain, but today sucks.
Bless both Hunter and Dad's hearts!  I love them both so much!  It really bothers both of them whenever I'm upset, so I try to keep that in mind, but at the same time sometimes it seems like Hunter is the only one who cares enough to ask, and Dad is the only one related to me who cares enough to say ""I love you"".
This morning I can't explain.  Basically, I felt like horse poopie, inside and out.  I seriously felt so freakin' ugly!  And opening at work didn't go so well either.  (Annoying/stupid co-worker=stressful conditions and more work for me).  So Hunter was doing everything he could think of to make me feel better in the very short period of time that he saw me for lunch.  (Seriously, all I wanted to do was go home and finish sewing a skirt!  Oh yeah, I'm sewing a pair of pants into a skirt.  No money and the pants didn't fit anymore).  And he did make me feel better, I still felt really blah, but he did help!  What's worse is that I was aggravated by every little thing!  Poor Hunter.  T_T
So then this afternoon....well the branch is being audited today.  Which means that there's a lady that looks at everything, asks a million questions and takes note of anything that we're doing incorrectly.
mmmm fun.
It was bad.  Seriously, I didn't really mess up, except once that I know of, but my drawer was off by $7.  *arg!*  But everyone else was so stressed because she was there that it was just a terrible terrible day to be at work!  I mean, you could have cut through the stress with a knife!
And the fact that my morning sucked so much wasn't helping.
Then my parents come (after we close the lobby) to switch cars with me.  Now, they were technically going to pick my car up from the shop, but then Mom wasn't feeling well, so we decided to do it Wednesday.  Well, they still came to get my Mom's car, which I was driving, and then let me take Dad's car home and swap again after work (because I'm supposedly taking Timothy out for his birthday...if he'll return my phonecall!).  See Mom and Dad decided that they needed to get some stuff for a business meeting that is going to be held at the house later tonight.  So...Mom was feeling well enough to buy some chairs (yes, buy) but not to pick up my car.  Okay....that's cool.  No problem.  I'm fine with that because it's my car, my responsibility.  BUT!  Mom has been sighing and being an over-all poopie head about me not having a car and she's even said to me ""Oh, I am always the one who is inconveinienced!""...I'M SORRY!
So tonight I drove Dad's car home, and was upset about the whole $7 thing, and when I pulled in the driveway...I couldn't find the parking break.  Technically I wouldn't care, but when I lifted off of the regular brake the car slid really far back.  So I call the house.  No answer.  Call Dad's cell.  No answer.  Call Mom's cell.  No answer.  Oh look!  I have a voicemail!  ""Bec it's Mom I tried to get to the phone call me now"" (in a very upset stressed voice)
So I call the house again, and Mom tells me to pull on some square thing on the dashboard that I have to pull and then snapped at me when I said I couldn't find it.  ""IT'S THERE I PROMISE *CLICK*""  ooookay....So I started to cry.  Which is pathetic, I know.  But I did.  I couldn't find the square thing, I still had to change clothes and take Timothy out, and I couldn't leave the car because it's a freakin' expensive/nice car that's not mine!!!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
So I park on the side of the road.  I'm still crying.
Dad is talking on his cell to someone and he's like ""What's the matter???  Are you okay????""
*sigh*  Poor Dad.
So after I had changed clothes Mom came up and gives me the most rehearsed apology I've ever heard.  She didn't mean it!  She was rolling her eyes, and then ran off as soon as she had finished!  I mean, I wasn't mad at her, she didn't need to ask for forgiveness!  But good grief!  Seriously, when she started to apologize I said ""It's okay..."" and I was planning on telling her that I was just upset because the day had been so awful and she just snapped ""WOULD YOU LET ME FINISH?!!??!""
....I thought you were apologizing...doesn't that mean you should be...sorry?
Dad made her do it.  Which sounds silly and juvenile, but it's true.  He did.
So I really don't know what to do.  I'm honestly flabbergasted.  How does one react to such an event?
Well, Dad then came up and asked if I was okay, and he's sorry that he hadn't helped me with the parking brake.  (apparently it's a little square thing that you push, not pull).  He gave me a hug and explained that Mom is just stressed.  To which I broke down and asked ""Does she even care?""
Wrong thing to say.  Dad doesn't need anymore drama.  But it's too late now, I said it.
He was like ""Of course, she cares very much she loves you etc. etc.""
......so then....""But she's so disappointed in me!""
Dad:  ""No she's not!  She's very proud of you!  She loves you!  Whenever she talks to me she's proud of you!""  He said that we'll talk more later.
*sigh*  I don't want to.  I don't want to talk more later because I don't want to cry anymore.
And Tim still hasn't called.  Which means that I'm going to be staying out later than expected.
i'm hungry."

I've noticed that people rarely update when they're happy.  I mean sure, there will be an occasional ""Yeah I'm still alive, things are great la la la"" post, but when people are depressed there are postings at LEAST five times a week!  So that's what it is.  I'm blaming my overall lack of posting since Christmas on the fact that I've been too happy for my own good.  Not that I'm complaining.  ^_~
Now, the reason I didn't say that I've been too happy for my own good since oh....July of last year is because I had other issues going on with other people that were never resolved 'til after Thanksgiving.  Such a long time.  *shrug*  Be that as it may, I'm pretty much just doing the obligatory ""Yeah I'm still alive, things are great la la la"" and so forth.  :)

Well, I will say this much, I'm not completely happy.  I still hate school.  More so than ever after Sunday.  Why?  Because of my *insert swear word of choice* calculus homework!!!  Oh man, it was bad!  See, because I had missed Monday I completely had no idea what was going on!  Although, apparently everybody else in the class had the same problem, whether they had missed or not.  *sigh*  Oh well, there are only two more weeks of actual class, and only one month to go before I will be FINISHED with this semester.
Which will also bring us one step closer to two years.  blarg.

Speaking of, today was especially pathetic.  I think it's because we have such horrible weekends!  I really do!  See, we rarely get to see eachother as is, but at least during the school week we SEE eachother and are able to have a full conversation!  Hehe.  But then, the weekend.  For whatever reason, something always comes up on Saturdays, so rule that out.  And then on Sunday if we're not playing the Anime game, then that means that something is going on with Hunter's family, or my family, or we're having to go out of the state to *shudder* Ohio.  So Sunday is shot too.  Once again, I will say...oh well.
But getting back to my original statement, yeah.  I'm really glad that none of y'all saw us 'cause y'all would have been sick.  (No, not PDA gosh!)
*happy sigh*  :)

Okay.  The next time I update, it will all be about my eventful day/night Friday.  Oh man!  It was something else entirely!  But I must go to bed now, seeing as it's 10:15.  Yay for early mornings!
GOODNIGHT!"

Yeah.  I wanted to have a picture for my background.  It definitely took me awhile to figure out how to do that, and then it took me even longer to get the page so that the picture actually SHOWED, but now it's all good.  Heh.
The picture is by Yoshitaka Amano.  He's the main artist for all the Final Fantasy games.  I love his style, it's very flowy and obviously Asian.  The picture isn't from anything as far as I know, but it's just beautiful!  So I had to put it up first.  :)

So, haven't updated in awhile....again.  My bad.  Sorry y'all.
Well, if you were wondering I did make a choice.  Next semester I will be taking 6 hours and I will be working about 40.75 hours.  *YAY*  I'm really excited.  Plus, I'll be taking JPN 301 (next step in the language) and JPN 421G.  421G is basically a class about anime.  You heard it, I'm going to be watching anime, writing papers about them, and getting credit for it.  Oh yeah!
So my major will be changed very soon from Accounting to a Topical Japanese heading.  Basically, I have to pick a topic that I kinda' emphasize throughout my academic career.  Right now I'm rolling a couple of ideas around in my head.
1)  the Western influence on Japan's younger generation
2)  Religion in Japan and how Christianity fits in
Yup.  For awhile I was thinking maybe doing something about how Japan has always been warlike, you know, way back when when all they did was kill people with swords to now when they are one of the major economic powers out there.  But then again...since China is pretty much the number one economic power right now, and since they SUCKED at fighting off the Japanese, it probably wouldn't work too well.  Oh well.
So that's what the rest of my school is going to be in a nutshell.  Japanese, Japanese and...Japanese.  With a little bit of gen eds thrown in there for good measure.  (Stupid natural sciences *shaky fist*).

What else has been going on?  Finished my taxes.  I'll be getting back more than I ever have before, so that's good!  Haven't mailed them yet because there are no stamps in this house and I haven't gone out to get any.

I skipped school today.  Completely skipped three classes.  Why?  Because I felt really gross and blah and kinda' sick.  See, yesterday I got a migraine.  First one I've ever had, hopefully the last one I ever have!  I was seriously on the verge of throwing up!  But thankfully I didn't.  Either way, it carried over to this morning.  Not the migraine so much as the feeling terrible.  So I decided ""forget school, I'm taking a break"".  I'm glad I did.  I slept in, a first since...well...ummm.....about January?  Yeah, that sounds right.  I also registered for classes (via the internet), cleaned my room, bathroom and vacuumed downstairs, the hall and my room.  Cleaned up spots left by the Brodie dog (stupid dog) got started on a 500 word essay on 'If you [I] were to write a book what would it be about and why would people buy it?' for a scholarship opportunity, messed around with the LJ, realized that I don't have the paper with the JPN homework assignments anymore, walked teh dogs, spent a couple of hours with Hunter (more on that), fixed my taxes (I had messed them up when I tried Saturday), met with Mom and Dad for a quick dinner and was all in all a little useful creature.  I kinda' wish I had done more, but it's already 9:40 and I need to go to bed in an hour.  Work tomorrow, yay.  heh.

So I had called Hunter to let him know that I wasn't feeling great and I wouldn't be on campus to eat lunch with him.  Well, he calls me at 12:55 to see how I'm doing which I thought was very sweet, and right as we hang up ('cause he has a class at 1) he walked into the house and gave me a hug.  *awwww*  So apparently he skipped his 1 o'clock to see how I'm doing.  Which I sorta' felt bad about, but then again, he didn't consult me before doing this so I never got the chance to tell him to not skip his class.  *^_^*  *YAY* I got to see Hunter today!
He had met with his advisor prior to surprising me, and apparently he only has a year and a half to go in school.  Or rather, after next semester, he'll only have 21 credit hours left, so technically he could graduate in a year if he took summer classes.  (He's still not sure if he's going to or not).  *teehee*  That makes us both happy.  :D

Anyways.....
I've been going to church more often.  Mainly because it's lent.  But I really do enjoy going to church, it's just hard to remember that when I have so much other stuff that I could be doing.  Although, technically church is far more important.  *sigh*  Hard sometimes.  So I go on Wednesdays and Sundays now.  I'm wanting to get into the habit of Matins during the Summer.  Hopefully by the end of Summer I'll be so used to it that I'll be able to do it in the Fall as well.

To anyone who calls me with a cellphone:  I've switched to Verizon, so sadly y'all need to be aware of your minutes if you call me.  My number is the same.  It's only the provider that has changed.  Sorry guys!  Couldn't really help it, it's a family plan.  Just thought I'd give ya' a heads up.

Mom and Dad are going out of town tomorrow and will not be home until the following Tuesday.  :(  It's cool in the sense that I get the house to myself, but sad because I'm going to be lonely for an entire week!  *sigh*  I'll probably end up spending the night at Rachel's apartment!  Hahaha.  Technically, it won't really matter because tomorrow I'll be at work all day, Wednesday I have school then church, Thursday is a repeat with work plus another two hours for tutoring, Friday I have school and then Karaoke in Louisville with JCIKS and Saturday I have work and I'll probably be bugging Hunter at his place while he's trying to study.  Sunday church, then a dinner in Ohio with Hunter's extended family, Monday lots of school and possibly tutoring, and then repeat.
So I don't even know that I'll notice Mom and Dad's absence!  They're going to Florida on a business trip.  Mom's packing right now, which means that she's moving around a lot and keeps coming in my room to ask me where something is, if I want an old article of clothing, or to toss some of my clothes on my bed that had been clogging up the laundry room.  Heh.  It's really not all that annoying, but every now and then it can get on my nerves.

Last night we (i.e. Hunter, Nathaniel, Tamez, Richter, Laroux, Lance and I) played the Anime game.  It's the first time that more than three of us have played for a loooong time!  (Hunter not included, he is the almighty GM and we bow down to him ^_~)  yuppers.  I had fun....but not as much as usual.  And I got really frustrated with...everyone.  Except Tamez.  But meh, it happens.  I'm just not used to having so many LOUD people there all at once.  It was hard to play because Hunter couldn't hear me or Tamez.  See, Tamez and I were the only ones trying to play the whole time.  The other four were goofing off half the time.  Which is fine, it's a game for crying out loud, you're supposed to have fun, but lordie!  Anyways, at one point in the game two of the people did something that I was completely uncomfortable with.  Basically, they killed an innocent 18 year old (NPC) who we had captured.  The kid was already tied up, I mean, he wasn't going to do anything.  *sigh*  But what really gets me is that my character was trying to keep them from doing it, and then out of character I just backed down.  Yuppers, it's basically my fault that non-existant kid died.  *poopie*
My problem is that I'm afraid that all the other gamers think I'm not a very good roleplayer and so I tend to just go along with what they (they meaning Lance, Richter and Lavin when he's there) say.  Which is stupid, my character is the captain, so technically they should do what I say.  But yeah.  So I'm definitely working on that, and starting to get better.  But last night I seriously screwed up.
I was really upset y'all!  I mean, once again, it is just a game, but still!  I'm just not cut out for cutthroat and ruthless behavior.  Or coldblooded murder.  Can't do it.  I don't care if it's 'pretend' just can't do it!  Anyways, once all of the crew was back on the ship the 'captain' called a meeting and made it very clear that that would never, ever happen again.  If anyone disobeys that command...bye.
Y'all wanna' know how upset I was?  The minute we took a break to order food etc. I went upstairs and just cried my heart out.  Seriously!  Hunter didn't know what to do with me!  Heh.  Luckily Tamez was the only other person who noticed that something was wrong.

But anyhoo, I accidentally got another haircut!  Heh.  The person cut my hair too short this last trip.  So it definitely looks different!  If I had a picture, I would post it, but sadly I do not.  I kinda' like it.  But I've come to the realization that I really like my hair no matter what the style as long as it's not ""shaggy"" or unkempt.  i.e. as long as it doesn't actually need to be trimmed.  Then I just hate it 'til I can actually get it cut.  Hahaha.

Oh man, there's probably more that I should update with...but it's now 10:15 and I have an early morning.  (6:30, YAY!)
So goodnight all!  God bless!  I MISS YOU!

Wow.  Just wow.  When I think about what was happening last year as opposed to this year!  I had good days, and bad days.  I documented more good days than bad.  But that's only according to this LJ.  I actually have evidence of more bad days than good.  *shrug*  Not now.  ^_^
Hunter and I went on a date Saturday.  It was the first date we had gone on for awhile, so it was very nice.  Well, we started talking about where we had both been last year.  Just trying to put things into chronological order.  It's kinda' funny how pathetic we were.  We're still pathetic, don't get me wrong!  But it's a different sort.  Last year we were pathetic because we both felt that it was hopeless if for different reasons.  (Me, I thought there's no way he'll ever go for me when he has so many other options and he never really hung out with me alone and I knew that Natalie liked him too at the time.  Hunter, yeah, he just KNEW there was no way I would ever go for such a goofy guy).  But now, our pathetic-ness veers more towards the whole extreme happiness thing.  Yeah, we keep catching the other with a huge grin plastered on our faces.  Yup, it's funny.  :)  Hehehe.
Looking back I realize what an absolute blessing I've received.  There were so many times where if someone had done, or said something differently Hunter and I might never have happened.  Such a scary thought!
I'm so glad that things happened the way they did.  Strange to think how so many different factors were involved.  It's a good thing I worked so much.  And it's a good thing school was so difficult for me.  Yes, I missed out on a lot of fun.  Yes, there are times when I still wish that somebody would have called me.  there were quite a few days where I wasn't working and I wasn't doing anything else.  But, it's good.  Because Hunter really didn't need any more opportunities to figure things out!  Haha!
The trip to CIII (Celebration 3) almost blew my cover.  That's when I fully realized that Natalie liked Hunter too.  I didn't know that Hunter had almost figured it out though.  Thank goodness!  Because my actions were what pretty much kept him just kinda' sorta' not sure.  It also sealed the deal in a sense.
I was so...sad...upset?...Maybe disappointed is the right word.  Yes, I was disappointed last year when I found out I wasn't the only one who liked Hunter.  Hurt would be a good word too.  Because I was never told...you know?  I finally figured it out, and just kept waiting and waiting.  I was just waiting to be told.  But you know what?  That was the best thing that could have happened!  That's just one more of the factors.
All I can really say is this:  Thank you.  Thank you from the very bottom of my heart!
See, while we were talking, we realized just how much we owe to other people for our current happiness.  Things would never have worked out the way they did if it weren't for all of y'all!
I could keep going, and type everything that was done/said that helped.  But it's really not necessary.
It's so funny.  Everytime Hunter meets someone new, he tries to tell that person ""our story"".  Last summer he told all the Upward Bound kids (who asked that is, he didn't just walk up to someone and say ""So have I told you how I started dating my girlfriend?""), and he's told all the Applebee's people he worked with, and then there are the friends from his high school, etc. etc.  It's kidna' cute.  In a masculine way that is.  *cough*  ;)  I must confess I have problems keeping my mouth shut about it.  It's just such an awesome thing that I want the whole world to know!  But I'm pretty sure that it would get on people's nerves after awhile.  Though I can't imagine why!  Hehehe.
So once again, thank you.

In other news, I've come to another crossroads.  It's a pretty big one too.  Not like the choice between giong to UK or staying at LCC.  Or the choice of what to do over the Summer.  No, this one will definitely control a big chunk of what direction my ilfe leads.  So the question is, what to do?
Well, y'all probably want to know just what it is that's rattling around in my head to cause me such dramatic statements.
College.  Work.  Life.  Which one, which one?
First off, I should say that I really like my job.  I work at a bank for those of you who didn't know, and am loving it!  I get paid a lot more than at Graeters, and I have health insurance just from working 15 hours a week.  (Actually, I'm just barely working 20, but that's because of my school schedule, not because they don't want me to work more).  So it's good.
Now the dilemma.  I've known ever since I started college, that I really hate it.  From the depths of my soul!  Thing is, at Asbury I thought it was just Asbury.  And it was, in part.  I did a lot better once I got away.  But it's still a dreaded evil thing.  For instance, last week was UK's spring break.  So what did I do?  I worked.  40 hours to be precise.  And guess what?  I loved it!  I really enjoyed working, and plus I have every Sunday off and every single evening off.  Woohoo!
(The only minus to last week was that Hunter didn't get off 'til 10PM, so I just didn't sleep very much.  Meh, who needs sleep anyway?)  Well, today was the first day back at school from the break.  And the entire time I was there I kept wishing I was at work.  Not home, work.  What does that say?  I'm happy at work.  I'm not happy at school.
See, I had only been on campus for three hours, and I was tired, stressed, bored, and depressed.  (maybe not completely depressed, but just not happy about where I was).  My first class is at 10, so I didn't have to wake up until 8:30.
Now, I go in to work at 7:30, which means waking up at 6.  I get off work no earlier than 4:45.  I get home from school at about 3:45 depending on traffic.
Another issue?  The stress factor.  I wasn't stressed last week.  At all.  Okay, maybe once, but it was Hunter's birthday and I hadn't been able to get everything done that I wanted to.  Minor thing.  So from Sunday morning to Sunday of the next week I was stress free.  STRESS FREE!
Thirty minutes after being on campus *WHAM* STRESS!  Yarg, I hate it!
Hunter and I had talked for a long time about two weeks...maybe three weeks, ago about me going to school.  The thing is, I'm not really doing it for me anymore.  Sure I am as far as Japanese goes.  No matter what, I'm going to finish my Japanese courses (which means another two classes, two different semesters)!  But as for the rest of it?  Yeah, not for me.  It's for my parents, or for Hunter, or for who knows what else.  Now, according to my darling guy me having or not having a college degree is not going to change his opinion of me in the slightest.  Unless I almost killed myself getting it and not enjoying any second of it, or I didn't get it just because I don't feel like going to school right now and I'll just let him do all the work.
The problem is that I really really really want to leave college and continue my job at the bank.  Finish my Japanese classes going part time and then be done with it.  But that's what I want to do, and so that's why I'm trying to be so cautious about this whole matter.  See, just because I want something doesn't mean I need it.  So if y'all could just be praying for good decisions, it would be greatly appreciated!
I talked to Mom today too.  If there is in fact an opportunity for advancement at the bank for someone without a degree, then she's all for me dropping out of school and working.  Mainly because she does love me and wants me to be happy.  She suggested I talk to one of the ladies at church who works at a different branch for my bank.  I could ask her if she thought I could advance without a degree etc.
Also, I need to talk to my manager or assistant manager.  Then I need to talk to my advisor about possibly changing my major to straight up Japanese and possibly graduating with that.  But I would need to know the requirements, seeing as it's a major that I would be making up.  (You can do that apparently, just have to write a 40 page paper before graduation).

So in approximately one year Hunter will be a semester and a half from graduating.  He'll also hopefully be working a good internship (that actually pays!).  So who knows?  Crazy what can happen in a year.  Or two.  Or heck, even three!  Three years ago I didn't know a Hunter Cardwell existed.  Amazing what can happen in such a short span of time, isn't it?
Goodnight."

"event","So I just found a note that my Mom had written...she had left it on top of a box of my books that still needs unpacking.
Yeah.
Who knew that she was disappointed in all three of her children?
She's blaming a lot of stuff on our apparent shortcomings.  Homeschooling, switching to Orthodoxy, mom getting sick etc.  I'm surprised she didn't blame the family genes on our mediocre looks too.
So mom and dad had received a letter from the daughter of a friend of dad's.  Inclosed in said letter was information about the daughter getting married to a nice man, being a wonderful Christian, a successful business women, etc. etc.  Now I know this girl, and she's a really nice person!  She's also very very attractive.  Now, when I had heard the news that she was getting married I was like ""That's neat.  I'm glad she's so happy!""
Not so with mom.
Mom compared this girl to her own children, and found us wanting.  That kinda' hurts.
I have spent the last few years convincing myself that mom DOES think I am pretty and DOES think I am smart and IS proud of me.  How silly of me to get my hopes up.
So now the question is, what could I have done differently?  I know that the answer won't matter.  Because it's too late.  But now I'm scared that when my kids grow up, I won't appreciate them for who they are.  I'll always be thinking ""If I had just pushed them harder in kindergarten, they would be making more money right now"" or ""If I had just made them eat their vegetables and play sports, they would be fit and attractive right now""  or  ""If I had just been in a denomination that had more active youth groups, they would have friends right now""
What's worse is that I'm happy with how I'm turning out.  I know that I'm not smart.  So what?  School isn't everything in life!  So maybe I won't be the richest woman in the world.  And maybe I'm not the best looking girl out there, heck, maybe I'm not as popular as most of the chicks at school.  guess what?  Funny thing about money, they make more everyday.  And my looks?  God made me this way for a reason.  He likes the way I look.  Heck, I like the way I look!  Maybe not everyday...but still.  And being popular?  I have friends.  I remember all of their names.  They aren't just faces that I know from a party a week ago.  No, I have friends who I love dearly, and who love me just as much.  You can't compete with that!
So why do I still feel like a worthless piece of poo?  Because I want my mom to be proud of me, and I don't think that's ever going to happen.  There's the kicker.  What it boils down to is whether I want my mom, and only my mom, to be happy, or if I want to be happy, and in turn the rest of my family and friends?
Part of me feels like it's a lose-lose situation.  Either way someone isn't going to be happy.  Both ways, I won't be completely happy, because I won't have my mom's approval.  Or, I won't have my family and friend's approval.
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go cry now."

I've been reminiscing about all sorts of things lately.  Nothing bad.  I can honestly say that I don't regret anything.  There are a few things that yes, if I had known then I would have changed my actions.  But oh well.  I'm not upset with what I did at those certain times.  Think about it, why would we feel regret over past occurences?  We didn't know things were going to turn out the way they did!  Every person that makes a decision is making the best decision that they can based on what they know to be true.  Except for those screwed up people who want bad things to happen.  (and we don't talk about them.  >_<)  I was just remembering all of the different friends I've known.  Some of them I'm still in contact with and/or remain good friends with...and others are just that, part of the past.
My first female best friend's name was Mary Blake Harbin.  I have no clue where she's living right now, or what she's doing.  We just lost touch.
Then there's Sarah Hutchinson.  She and I were really good friends for a couple of years, then we got into a fight.  It was over something that I can't even remember anymore, but we were 14 at the time, and everything is traumatic at 14.  Well, we ""made up"" but were never really close after that.  Then we lost touch.  Then reconnected our last two years of camp and became good friends again.  Then lost touch...again.
But I received an e-mail from her recently, it was just a mass e-mail saying that she was changing her e-mail address.  But I replied to it.  And she replied to my message.  I've since been invited to her wedding on June 3rd.  Crazy the way things happen.
Or what about the people that I didn't like when I first met them, and spent who knows how many years not getting along with them or liking them, and then later becoming really good friends?  My friend Kevin would fall into that category.  Heck, I even had a crush on him for about five months!  We've since become uber busy, and don't talk very often, but he's still someone I consider a good friend.  (By the by, I'm worried about him.  His lifestyle is...lacking in the spiritual department and he doesn't have anybody to be a good influence.  No role models etc.  So if y'all could pray for him, that would be much appreciated!)
Then there are the friends that the minute you meet them you can never not be friends.  Katie.  It's weird, I've never been mad at Katie.  Ever.  You know you're blessed when you have someone like that in your life.
And then there's Hunter.  *^_^*  (That's a blushing smiley face)  Yeah.  What can I say?  Y'all remember how I would always talk about how he was the one etc. etc. last year?  You know, when I thought that there would never be a chance for me?  Even then I didn't realize how right he truly is.  We fit.  Which sounds extremely corny, but that's just the way it is.  Like I told him earlier, he makes me feel right.  Like I am who I am for a reason.  Now, like I was talking about with Christina, I still have those days where I'm just like ""Oh my gosh I suck!!!"" but they don't happen very often.  Besides, I've realized that it's not someone else who can make me feel good about myself, it's my own attitude.  Yet I digress.
I don't really know how to say it without sounding like the cheesiest person in the world but...Hunter is everything that I need...and (I think) I am everything he needs.
So yeah.  :D
Geez, I think I had more thoughts that I was going to put on here, but now I can't remember.  Go me.  ;)
I have a birthday party thing to go to tonight.  *yay*  So yuppers, trying to get all that silly schoolwork done before then.  Oh well, just one of those things.
I start work this Tuesday at the bank.  Really excited!  :D
Okay, I'm gonna' go now.  BYE!"

The clouds, a voice that was shot into the holding future

The moon, a shaking heart in an unsteady mirror
The stars, gentle tears in an overflowing stream

I do so want to go,

That heart,
held within your body
In those confusing nights
I dream

The wind, its halting words are a gentle illusion
The clouds, the broken future like a distant voice

The moon, a heart flowing in the clouded mirror
The stars, broken and swaying, like tears unable to be hidden.

Isn't it beautiful, to walk together in each others hands
I do so want to go,

A soft touch,
Dissolving into morning,

*sigh*.
I have an exam tomorrow.  My first Economics exam, but we've had a 30 question quiz already...and I only got 22 questions right.  yarg.  So why am I not in bed right now and getting a good night's rest before the exam?  Because I haven't studied.  That's right, you've heard me.  I've been a terrible student and an extreme procrastinator.  In my defense, I've had other things that I've been studying for as well as other things that I've been doing.  But still.  If I had been on the ball, this wouldn't be a problem.  That is why I say again *sigh*.
I think it will be okay....well, no that's a lie.  I'm actually very worried.  So why am I writing in this instead of poring over practice problems until I know them forwards and backwards?  Because I really have no idea where to start!
Plus it brings back fond memories of staying up all night studying for something and updating this thing at least five times.  Ahhh good times, good times.
So today...yeah.  Today was interesting.  Well, I guess that's really not the right word.  I can't think of a word to describe today.  Before I go any further, I will say that the evening was very nice and I got to see Hunter which made everything better (he usually works on Tuesday nights).  Rather, makeS everything better.  And studying for the exam tonight?  Well, *shrug*  I'll do my best and pray that it works.  But this morning and early afternoon....ugh.  Bad.  just bad.
So I'm going to tell you about the bad part of my day.  Why?  Because this is a place to vent and rant, that's why.
Dad's car was due for it's routine maitenance so I had to pick him up from there.  But instead of being able to take him home so that I could finish getting all my school books together and just ready in general I had to take him to see the raiki lady.  (basically acupuncture without needles).  Well, after dropping him off, I had an hour in which I had to drive home, grab all my shtuff and then pick him back up.  Then after that he and I had to go to the lovely Cingular store because my phone was committing a very slow and painful looking suicide.  (the buttons and the front cover just sorta' fell off.  it was ugly!  But it still worked!)  The reason we had to do it right THEN was because Dad had to go with me since it's his account.  Well, that pretty much meant that we both had to not be doing something else, at the same time.  Very hard to manage with Dad and I.  So we went.  I was supposed to meet Hunter at 12:15PM on campus, which is a good 20-25 minute drive from the Cingular store.  The Cingular store is also about 20 minutes away from the raiki lady.  So I picked up Dad at 11:30.  Hmmm.....
Well, we got to the store, and got me a new phone.  I got the cheapest one available because I felt guilty for needing a new phone and then I took Dad to the house before heading towards campus.
Well, I had forgotten a minor, minor detail.  My new phone needed to be activated in order to work.  And I didn't have the PIN number to do so.  Nor could I call my Dad to find out what said PIN number was.  I also couldn't call Hunter to have him meet me somewhere else since I was going to be/was late.
So I was in a quandery as to what to do.
Well, I tried a lot of different number sequences that are fairly important to the family (none of them being the correct one) and then just drove to where I would normally pick up Hunter.  Keep in mind, I'm 30 minutes late.
Well, of course, he's not there.  By this point I had already freaked out because I had no way of contacting ANYBODY.  So I start driving around trying to find Hunter.  Couldn't find him.  Then I go to the parking lot and look for his car.  Nope.  I'm really upset by now, I feel like a wretch for being late, and I'm so sad that everything got screwed up thanks to me needing a *stupid* new phone that I couldn't even get to work.
So I just parked and started walking, hoping that I would maybe catch Hunter on the way to his car.  *sigh*  Sadly no.  So I go into the building where his two classes are on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I was ducking my head in every classroom.  It was pretty bad.
Couldn't find him.
By now I pretty much knew he had already left, and I wasn't going to see him at all today because he had to work, and I didn't know what to do.  So I decided that I would at least try to find a phone and have my parents call him to tell him how sorry I was.  Well, by this time I'm crying.  Actually, I've been crying for awhile, but now it's fairly obvious because the tears are showing and I'm just kinda' walking across campus for all the world to see.
One person.  Just one person stopped to ask if I was okay.  And he was a groundskeeper.  I was so pitiful y'all!  He just quietly asked ""are you okay?""  and I replied ""I've lost somebody!!!""  (imagine a trembling chin, tears in my eyes, and a faulty voice and that's what it was like)  He was like ""oh...I'm sorry do you need anything?""  I replied ""no...but thank you *sniff*"" and we went our seperate ways.
Continuing on, I walk to the big tower building with 18 floors because my Japanese prof's office is in it, and there are almost ALWAYS people I know in that building.  (It has a little cafe thing)
So I try to find my prof's office, and that in itself was an adventure.  Apparently the Japanese language isn't considered an ACTUAL language, but instead a mathematical department.  That's right, they put the JPN prof's offices on the math floor.  *shaky fist*  Well, I knock.  And no answer.  I'm so upset by now.  I'm to the point where all I want is a phone.  That's all!  I just want to call SOMEBODY so they can pass the message that I'm so very sorry along to Hunter.  But no.  Not happening.  I was so desperate that I knocked on Prof. Slaymaker's door to see if he would let me use his phone.  (He's the evil JPN prof I had last semester that I really didn't like)  But he wasn't in his office either. *sigh*.
So I went to class.
And felt sorry for myself.  And imagined all the terrible things that could have been avoided if I had just _____ (fill in blank with just about anything, because I was blaming myself for everything.  World War II?  Yeah, me.)
Anyways, the good news is that there was a note in my car from Hunter saying that he called in to work and that he was going to call me after class.  Only wrinkle in that was that my phone still wasn't working.  (Actually, I can't get it to.  Apparently the phone company doesn't think Dad's social security number is the same as he remembers it)  But!  He was parked next to me (he had left and come back, so no I'm not blind) and I knew that he would EVENTUALLY come to his car, so I waited.
So yay!  I did get to see him, and we ate chinese food and went walking around downtown and then watched a movie.  (groundhog day).
So all in all, it was all worth it.
But *whew* I'm tired!
Yuppers so that was my day.
Now time to get my benkyousuru on.  (studying)"

So anyhoo, I'm tired.  But I must stay awake because right now I'm playing a game.  *woohoo!*  Well, right now I'm not, because we're taking a break.  But I'm in the middle of a game.  It's an RP tabletop.  And that's why it's not a good thing that I'm so tired, because I have to make decisions thinking like another person, and I have to act like another person....blarg.  BUT!  Sustenance is on it's way, in the form of pizza, and we must start again.  So now I get to act like a foul=mouthed 32 year old red head who's a pilot of a spaceship and has a rag tag crew.  And a robot that more often then not is trying to kill me or another crew member because it feels like it.  *shaky fist*  stupid robot.
Heh.
It's fun.  Except for the foul-mouthed part.  But hey, she had been in jail for a long time, and hung out with a lot of foul-mouthed men.  What can you expect?
Okay I'm going to go now.
Oh yeah, I'm having to move back in to my parent's house...did I mention that already?  *shrug*  I'll offer more info later.
Mmmmm I have math homework due tomorrow.  Yes, I know that tomorrow is a Sunday.  Stupid math class.  Heh.

"event","So here I sit.  At my Mom's computer.  I have five other windows open.  They're all potential sources for an annotated bibliography that's due Wednesday.  But I've completely stopped understanding what they're saying, and it's only 9:30PM.  Really it's all my fault.  I'm not concentrating on my paper right now.  In fact, I'm concentrating on just about everything that's going on in my life at this moment, and I just don't have time to worry about a silly little annotated bibliography.  Especially when all 10 sources have to be relating to Accounting and Ethical Questions in the field.  You know what that means?  I'm reading what a bunch of accountants have written in journals and none of it makes sense!  Lot's of numbers though.  Not numbers in a ledger.  Just rules.  Accountants like giving everything numbers apparently.  So even rules and addendums and counter-rules and changes in rules have numbers.  It's all very confusing.  Plus they use a lot of big accountant words that don't make sense to us mere mortals.  Granted, this is my chosen field...but I they don't teach you the ""lingo"" until the night you become fully initiated into the accounting cult..I mean club.  Oops, I've already said too much.  *shhh* don't tell!

anyhoo, here I sit.  A million and one things are bouncing around in my head and I don't really want to think about any of them.  I think I'm just a little tired.  It's really nothing too serious.  I'll probably feel better Thursday 'cause I'll get to sleep in a bit.  *mmmm sleep*
Had a quiz in Japanese today.  It was a little hard.  But I only left one thing blank, and that's because I didn't know what the word for ""stay"" is.  Eh, I put hello kitty stickers on the homework that was due, so that must have been worth at least 10 bonus points.  It's in the bag.

So I'm selling all of my old Tarzan books on ebay.  They're all paperbacks, but they're like one edition away from being the ""first"" edition, so they should bring in a little bit of extra cash.  Just a little something to help get me through the months.

My brother ordered a pizza and let me have some.  And Rachel brought home a piece of pie from Ramsey's for me and one for Hunter.  That was nice of them.  I found out today that apples at UK's little cafe thing are 80 cents.

My car is at the mechanics, but it's ready to be picked up, which Nathaniel and I will do tomorrow morning.  I needed two things to be replaced...but thank the Lord that Skunder (my mechanic) was able to get one of the car parts used instead of new.  :)

I talked to Katie briefly this past Saturday.  She's doing well, and back in school.  I'm glad everything's starting to smooth out a little for her.  She has an apartment somewhere on or near campus.  I'm not quite sure I understand the actual arrangements though.

I'm probably going to wake up around 7, that way I can finish any work I still might have to do for this bib. and then NMB and I can go to get my car and then I can finish washing my uniform.  Then I'll meet Hunter for lunch and go to class.  After class I have work *YAY* nand after work I should go to sleep so that I can get up on time Wednesday.  (Gotta' get up at 6:20).  The good thing about Wednesday is that I don't have anything else due besides the bib. and I get to work again.  *YAY*  :D

Right now I kinda' wish that I could just drop school for the semester and work like 45 hours a week, then take summer classes (up to 9 in one session, or 12 the whole summer) while working around 30 hours a week, and then not work during the Fall snd just take 21 or 24 hours of school.  *sigh* that would be very nice.  But, for starters I don't have a job that could give me 45 hours (they're having a hard enough time giving me 25, and I need 28 to be able to pay for for everything) and school is too far along to drop.  i.e., I wouldn't get the full tuition back.  bleh.  So looks like I'm going to keep going to school.  Heh, oh well.

Yeah, I don't really have much else to say, and it's now 10:00.  So I should probably just go ahead and get back to work.  Goodnight everybody.  God bless!"

"event","So this is me updating because a certain someone *cough Hunter cough* requested an update.
What word would best sum up my existance for the past month or so?  Hmmm...'Busy' just about does it!  But that only tells you what I've been doing with my allotted span of 24 hours.  It doesn't describe all the emotions I've had regarding the various events that have transpired.  For instance, January 2nd (really the 1st, but I had to work the 2nd).  That was the 6 month anniversary of when Hunter and I were ""official"".  The emotions that went along with that were extreme happiness, awe, loveand contentment.
REally, that's pretty much what I've felt/experienced since...well...July 2nd.  To be honest since May.  But *shrug* the official date is 7/2, so I musn't mess with that.  :)
However, I have been stressed.  Very stressed.  What can I say?  School has started and that means that I""m going crazy.  What concerns me is that I've already started to freak out about one of my classes.  ALREADY!  It's only been a week for crying out loud!  It's my English 203 - Business Writing class.  Maybe if it weren't at 8AM I wouldn't be so worried.
Basically I don't feel like I can get all of the work done, on time and to the teacher's liking.  See, if I get a D or lower on ANY of the papers/assignments that we have...ANY of them, then I automatically fail the course.  Doesn't matter if I get 100% or even 110% on everything else.  I kinda' think that rule sucks.  But they don't really care what I think about their rules.
Anyhoo, I think if I just get started on the assignments early I should be able to finish them on time.  But then there's that whole 'not having time to do more than make up for the schoolwork that I should have done last week' thing.  *sigh*  I really do hate school.
Heh.
On the flip side I just submitted my homework assignment for Calculus (the first one that is) and I got all the answers right.  Took me two tries, but I got it!  *YAY*
Let's see, let's see...what else...
I would go into great detail about all the things that have been happening to me, but I realize that it would probably bore y'all, and plus, I have to sleep at some point this evening.  ^_^  Sorry!
Umm...Christmas went well.  Lots of family.  bleh.
New Years was much better.  No family.  In fact, I drove down to Morgantown to see Hunter, and spent the night there on the Eve of New Years.  Then we both drove up together the next day after visiting his church etc. and that's when we celebrated the whole 6 month thing.  Teehee!
I'm still giddy over him.  And you know what?  I'm hoping that never goes away!
Hunter got sick, so I spent a day with him and ""patched"" one of his shirts.  I say ""patched"" because it looks like I attacked the shirt with a pair of scissors and then randomly sewed bits and pieces of the cloth on with stitches that are too small here, and then too large there.  It's really a sad shirt.  So what does Hunter do?  He wears it.  In public.  Even though I told him not to.  *sigh*  It's cute that he wears it though...in a manly sort of way.  :)
Oh yeah, this is the shirt that I ripped last year.  Hahaha!  Yes it's taken me this long to fix it.  But it gave me an excuse to spend the day with him.  So there!
Then I got sick.
And he spent the day with me.  Teehee, awwww.  We really are, pathetic.  We do our best to hide that fact when other humans are around, but it's very sad.
Moving on...
I'll probably be working 28 hours this semester, and I'm taking 15.  I'm also going to still have tutoring, and then I'll be trying to fit in the Anime game that I just started playing in somewhere in the week.  So what free time do I have?  You ask.  To which I reply ""Hahahahahhaahahahhaahhahhahhaiheofihaoefhaiohfeoajhwoefh8a8w9uyrhfihed;auiwh3rhj29q3r8ha8uhfoiaurfa8 x^2-6x+9=0 jafoiejfa98eoa98hwi3af;oijf;ijanjnhuahgogu8hoi;jenrouaheof;hj;aoijfija nihongo no kurasu wa muzukashi sugiru to omoimasu ajmfoiewajifea gross domestic product joiawjfeoajfoeiaahwiehiehjl;iba grammar, punctuation and spelling errors jowiejfaioiaoiej seven characteristics of life ijawfeoi8ajfiaewf peanut butter chip is a peanut butter icecream with chocolate chips and peanut butter blitz is a chocolate icecream with peanut buttter cookie dough and chocolate chips ahga8uh39ia3ij4riouhfHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!""
Yeah.  Good times.  Good times.
But I really am happy underneath all the layers of stress.  I mean, if you were to catch me off guard, my main emotion would be happiness.  So that's very good!  :)
I need to call Katie and I said I would call her, but then I lost my voice.  And then I started working everyday.  So while those sound like excuses (which they are in a sense) they are nonetheless true.  *sniff*  I'm sorry Katie!
Okay, I'm falling asleep now.  So I need to go home and finish some laundry, then clean up my jewelry mess, then go to bed.  :D
GOODNIGHT!  I promise I'll update when I can!

See, I had a hard class in LCC here and there, but not every single class was totemo muzukashi shi, warui desu yo!  (Very difficult and what's more, evil!)  Oh well.  So, I got a B in Japanese.  Which on the one hand, is better than what I thought the *BEEPING* prof would give me, and on the other is so much less then I feel like I put in.

Anyhoo, I was very dizzy during the last half hour of my last final.  And I couldn't walk in a straight line afterwards.  Needless to say, I took the bus, but I was still having difficulties.  Haha, I bet people thought I was drunk.
Okay, I have to go to work now, so y'all have a wonderful evening!  I'm praying for every one of you.  Believe me on that!  And if you could still keep me in your prayers, I'm trying to pack/move this weekend, and I don't know if it's going to happen.

Yeah.  My Japanese final?  Yeah.
I don't know that evil is quite strong enough.
Let me put it this way:  I started to cry halway through and I was about ready to just give up.
But I didn't give up.  I made things up.  The only problem is that this teacher doesn't let people get away with that.
*sniff*
And overall grade in Psychology?  It's a B.  yay.  I guess I shouldn't complain.  I probably could have done better in that class, if I had just found the time to read the stinkin' online assignments.  grr.  So my GPA has already been lowered.
I figured out that even if I get A's in my other three classes I'll still have lowered my GPA.  Because PSY is a 4 credit course instead of 3.  arg.
And, yeah, I'm not getting A's in all of my other classes.  I don't know that I will even get one A this semester.
So basically, I'm upset.  and I just hate it.  Plus I still have two finals, and while I should be studying for them right now, I've been studying Economics for a solid two and a half hours.  (Doing tests/old exams)
As for Biology?  Hmmm.  Can I just say I'll be ecstatic if I pass that class with a C?
yeah.
school sucks.  But what else is new?
I'm just so worried that this means I won't be able to get into Accounting.  Then what?  I mean, I'm not good enough at anything else.  Obviously seeing as NOBODY has bought my jewelry, and I suck at math, and proper English.  Heck, I might be able to flip hamburgers the rest of my life.  woohoo.  ""would you like fries with that?""
*sigh*  Never fear children, I'll be fine in a couple of days.  Once I let myself get over school and think about Christmas.  Like I said, there are worse things in life then having a GPA of 3.0
Which brings me to my next wo.  Once I pay my car payment tomorrow, I will have a grand total of $50 to spend on presents.  At least I'm not starving, and I don't have kids.  And at least I'm not dying.

YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was sick for a very, very, very long time.  The stupid flu thingy turned into an earache.  Actually, my ears are still ringy and I'm having problems understanding what people are saying...but that's supposedly going to go away....eventually.  Heh.
They do not hurt though, which is such a blessing!  Apparently the pressure in my head (and the liquid, goo, I know) was too much, and it ""porforated"" my left ear drum.  Yup.  So the next day my ear was bleeding....fun stuff.
Anyhoo, finals week.  What great times, let me tell ya'!
I have Psychology tomorrow morning at 10:30, Japanese Thursday at 6PM, and then on Friday I have Biology at 10:30 and Economics at 1PM.
Mmmm boy.  So I'm taking a break from studying PSY right now.  (Get to go in to work at 5:30)
My plans are to stay up 'til 3-ish tonight, then 1-ish tomorrow night, then 3-ish again Thursday night.
Sleep?  What's that?  I haven't experience sleep in awhile.  I figure, hey, eventually my body will forget what it's missing.  Right?  Right.
I've started the moving process.  So I still have to pack, a lot, but I've moved the things that I'm not using right now.  Like old textbooks and schoolpapers.  Office supplies, books, movies, random things that I keep mainly because I've learned the hard way that some evil person in some evil company/school is going to want to see some random piece of paper from two years ago.
*sigh*  Why must they be so evil?  Heh.
I just finished creating my character and character's backstory for the anime game that Hunter is GM-ing sometime next year.  That was fun!  Then we had to make the ship...not so fun.  Somewhat confusing in fact.  Curse my wanting to be the pilot!  *shaky fist*  But it's all finished now.  Except the weapons...which Hunter is going to do later.  I dunno, I think the glazed eye look in my eyes gave him the hint.  ;)
Oh man, not a whole lot of new stuff has happened.  Just the same stuff is continuing on.
I'm worried about all my finals...of course.
I'm really tired, and a little stressed...naturally.
I miss Aikido so much!  I promised to myself though that someday I will get the money/time to do it again.  I don't care if I start at the beginning and work my way up again.  Just as long as I'm practicing!
I also miss singing.  Almost as much as Aikido.  But there's just not enough time.  And once again money.  Plus, I feel guilty taking lessons since I'm not doing anything with it.  If I were singing on a regular basis then yeah, that's okay.  But I don't sing.  Ever.  Which is something I wish I could do.  But how can I incorporate singing into my life?  Church?  Already do it.  What I mean is on a stage, giving a performance.  I love performing.
Oh well.
Well, I've started trying to help people more...or rather, be more helpful/caring.  It is, of course, easier with people I love.  But the main obsticle is that I just feel so small.  Intellectually I know that one person can make a difference, but I just can't get past this block in my mind that I am not someone special enough to make that difference.  So I'm still trying.  Right now, I'm gonig to focus on Rachel.  She really needs someone to watch out for her and take care of her.  I don't mean she needs someone to hold her hand or anything like that, she's very independent.  I think what I mean is that she needs a person in her life who is a good influence instead of a bad influence.  Make sense?  Most of her friends are iffy at best.
Yesterday Hunter helped me drop off some boxes at the apartment, and Rachel mentioned how the washer was still leaking, so she couldn't wash any clothes.  She was saying how she was going to have to get the landlord to fix it or something, so Hunter and I fixed it instead.
Okay, so I feel like rambling, and it will probably be on the topic of me not being enough to get everything done or something along those lines...so instead I'm going to stop typing and get ready for work.
Thanks guys."

In fact, Angela and Tanya actually SPLIT my shift this morning, which means that both of them added about 3.5 hours onto their days.  Very kind of them.  But considering that I would have just kinda' stood there and stared at the customers, it was in their best interests.  Though I didn't tell them that.
Okay, so I'm pretty ticked off right now at the owner of the store which shall not be named.  See, the paycheck that I had to pull teeth to get?  It bounced.  Which means that I have absolutely no money in my bank account.  (Which explains why my card didn't work Stina.  Heh, sorry)  The thing is, it bounced on Nov. 1st, I received the notice on the....28th I believe...not sure...anyhoo, and she has yet to REPLY to any of my phone calls or notes.
I have visited the store twice now, and both times Anne was not there.  So I asked point blank for my money and even left copies of the bounced check so she can't say I'm trying to scam her.  Obviously she and I both know (and the entire store) that the check bounced, but that't entirely beside the point.  Moving on, I left phone messages DEMANDING that she call me back, and to no avail.  I even had my parents call her today (since I can't speak above a whisper) and she didn't call back.  Evil, evil, evil woman.  All I want is my stinkin' money!
The shop clerk tried to DEFEND her the last time I went in.  She was like ""Well, I've had this happen before too, and I can say that Anne will eventually fix it.""  I said ""Eventually is not good enough.  I have bills.  In order to pay bills, I need money.  I need my money NOW.""
poopie on her head.
It doesn't help that I have missed two days of work, but I'm sure I can make up for it next week.  I'll probably be able to steal a shift or two from somebody wanting to go home early for the weekend or what have you.
I have finals in two weeks.  Actually, everybody has finals in two weeks.  Eeee!  I'm glad that the semester is almost over with, but I don't know that I'll be able to get everything done in time.  Like studying, packing, moving, and Christmas shopping.  org Christmas shopping.  I'm so excited that Christmas is coming!  But it's going to be a tight year.  A very tight year.  *sigh*.  That makes me sad.
I guess that's really all.  I'm doing this quickly, because my family is eating dinner now, and I want to join them so that they'll know I'm still alive.
Oh yeah, but really quickly, Hunter has been taking very good care of me, which has freed up my family to get all of their respective chores accomplished.  See, I still had to go to school Thursday and Friday, so Hunter took me both times (driving was pretty much out of the question for me, yeah).  It was extremely kind of him, and I feel bad because I know that he had more important things to do, but I was in no condition to argue with anybody.  So yeah, I'm very grateful for him.  ^_^
Dinner time!"

"event","Yeah, Monday is DEFINITELY my favorite day of the week!  Why?  Because I get to go to tutoring (which means that I'm actually LEARNING Japanese instead of being talked to in Japanese class), and then after that I get to go out with Hunter!  Eeeee!  See, Monday night is the only time we get to go on dates.  So we go out once a week.  *sigh*  But it's okay, because we're able to eat lunch twice a week (on Tuesdays and Thursdays).  (We both have a break in classes at the same time).  Every now and then he'll show up at Graeters and we'll go get something to eat after I get off....but that's around midnight, so not only are we extremely tired, he also has to drive back to Wilmore.  Bleh.  Oh well.
Right now I'm working about 25 hours.  So not too bad.  I work on Wednesdays (or Tuesdays, it varies), Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.  Which leaves (usually) Tuesday evening, Thursday evening, and Saturday evening for schoolwork.  But of course, I either get called into work, or there's a family thing going on, or there's something with church.  Yeah.  Fun times, let me tell ya'!
But, I am very much so looking forward to tomorrow night!  *YAY*  I figure, the best way to enjoy a busy week is to do it with people you love.  I mean, the only school I have to worry about now is a Japanese quiz, some JPN homework, and then all of my finals.  Psshhh I got this in the bag.
Oh man, Rachel is trying to get me to help her move, which I should do since she's my sister...but I can only give her Wednesday from 2:45 to 5:15, then Thursday from 12:15 to 2:15, then Friday again from 2:45 to 5:15.  School and work.  That's basically been my existence for this past semester.  Mmmm boy I'm going to enjoy next semester even more!  Working 28 hours AT LEAST, then taking 15 hours of school (instead of my current 13), AND I'll be relying completely on myself.  WOOOHOOO!  I am actually very excited.  I mean, yeah, I figured out that if I study only 2 hours per credit hour, and I only work 28 hours, then I'll have 6 hours of free time.  (that's if I get 8 hours of sleep five out of seven days a week, then 7 the other two)..........hmm....This just means I won't have enough time to spend any money!  See?  God already knew what I needed.
So last Sunday night a girl from my Japanese class e-mailed me asking if I could scan the homework problems and send them to her since she doesn't have the workbook.  (Understandable, there aren't enough workbooks for students, which is funny since there are only about 40 JPN201 students at UK right now).  The only problem is that I had already filled in the answers....so I e-mailed her back saying that I could handcopy them and then scan it.
So I did.  Actually, it was really good practice for me!  Those dang Kanji and Hiragan KILL me!  Anyhoo, so la la la la la, once I finished I noticed that she e-mailed me back saying that someone else sent the problems to her.
Huh...that's neat.  So I just laughed it off figuring that if nothing else it got my mind off of things for awhile.
Well, I brought the sheets in to class today to show her how pitiful they looked ('cause they did, oh man are they ghetto!).  Well the minute I pulled them out she shrieked, jumped out of her chair and gave me the biggest hug in the world!  I'm thinking...""woh, it's just a couple of pieces of paper lady"".  It made me feel bad, because if someone doing something small like that was such a big deal, can you imagine how little must be done for her?  So it got me thinking, how many other people do I know through class, or work, or church, or anything that doing something small for them would just make their day?  The only question that remains is, why haven't I started helping them?  The only thing I'm afraid of is that I'll do something for one person, and then someone else will wonder why I didn't do something for them.

We're passengers aboard the train.
Silent little lambs amidst the pain.
That's no longer good enough.
And when it's time to speak our faith,
We use a language no one can explain.
That's no longer good enough!
And God knows it's a shame,
'Cause if we look to pass the blame,
We are not the worthy bearers of His name!

For the world to know the truth,
There can be no greater proof,
Than to live the life, live the life.
There's no love that's quite as pure,
There's no pain we can't endure,
If we live the life, live the life!
Be a light for all to see.
For every act of love will set you free.

There's something beautiful and bold,
The power of a million human souls.
Come together as one.
And each, in turn, goes out to lead,
Another by His word, His love, His deed.
Now the circle is done.
It all comes back to one,
For it is He and He alone,
Who has lived the only perfect life we've known!

For the world to know the truth,
There can be no greater proof,
Than to live the life, live the life.
There's no love that's quite as pure,
There's no pain we can't endure,
If we live the life, live the life!
Be a light for all to see.
For every act of love will set you free.

I just wish I could be good all the time.  Wouldn't that be awesome?  I mean, then I wouldn't have to worry about...being bad...heh.  No other way to say that really.  I just, hate hate hate to see people hurt you know?  I mean, for crying out loud, that's one of the reasons I know so many people that I will never speak with.  Why?  Because I see them hurting other people.  Now, granted, I hurt people all the time.  I'm guessing that unless you're like Stina (who we all love dearly!) you're going to hurt people all the time too.  That doesn't make it right, so don't think I'm trying to say that it's not my fault.  But I am trying not to hurt them, you know?
TUTORING TIME!  WOOOOOOOO!!!!!"

"event","I got to sleep in an hour this morning because of the football game.  *YAY*  Heh.  I know that doesn't really make sense, basically Tanya opened the store, then I clocked in at 11AM (instead of 10) and worked 'til 6PM when the game ended.
It really wasn't busy though, I was somewhat surprised.  I mean, there was a fairly steady trickle of customers...but just barely.  The only bad thing was that I had to keep Mark, my crew entertained.  He's a really good kid, but if he doesn't have a job to do he starts playing with the cups, spoons, pecans, people, rags, etc.  I think the company has lost a lot of money via cups and spoons since he started working there.  But *shrug* better him than nobody.  I do like Mark, he makes me laugh.
A girl from my Japanese class e-mailed me asking me to scan the homework questions that are due this Monday for her.  She couldn't get a workbook in time.  The only problem is that I already did the homework, so I just hand copied it (since it's all kanji and kana, I can't type it).  Well, as soon as I finished and was getting ready to scan it, she e-mailed me back saying that someone else did it for her.  hahahaha.  Oh well.  Actually, it's good because not only would my poor excuse for homework pages not work to turn in, I also got the chance to practice my handwriting...a lot!  (I keep getting points taken off for my kana and kanji.)  So yay.  But still....arg.  Heh.
I watched the movie Amelie instead of packing or doing homework.  Amelie really is a good movie.  It's one of the very few movies that can cheer a person up without fail.  The soundtrack is nice too.
After getting home from work, I talked for a long while with Dad.  That was good.  Yesterday I talked a long time with Mom, she has a very calming influence when she's talking with people.  And Dad, well, Dad and I have a lot of the same personality traits.  So I enjoyed hearing him talk about how he deals with things.  It's times like these when I wish Grandpa was still alive.  While technically all I know about him is from Dad or my uncles, he still sounds like a very kind, wise man.  I would have liked spending time with him.  And Grandma for that matter.  Apparently I'm the ""spittin' image"" of her...if you were to give her blonde hair, and three inches that is.  ;)
I'm constantly learning.  Don't pee into the wind comes to mind.  Boy did I learn the hard way!  Hahaha I'm just joking.  Considering my anatomy, that would be a little difficult to do.  No, but really, there's worth in everything that happens, and there's good in everybody.  That's very hard to own up to.  I know a lot of people that I would rather say there's nothing good about them and oh look at me I'm so much better than them blah blah blah.  But then again, that's too easy.  Plus, what good would it bring?  None that I've found.  Sadly that's something easier said than done.  Maybe if I could somehow have it imprinted on my brain such that every time I formulate a thought the words ""find worth in everything, there is good in everybody"" flash in front of my eyes for ten seconds.  Sure, it may make me seem a little slow in the head when people are talking to me, but a little slow in the head is a lot better than mean, or uncaring.  Or any of those yucky adjectives.

Intelligence, Humor, Beauty, Frankness.  Those are what I found to be true.
And now, hunger and fatigue.
Goodnight, God Bless."

"event","Teehee!  Apparently I have gorgeous eyes.  But that wasn't my reason for posting, I just wanted to say that for the record it has been said, so it must be true.  ;)  *sidenote:  Hunter's eyes have this hot green-ish blue ring exactly between his pupil and the white of his eye.  It's really cool*
Anyways, so y'all wanna' know what's going on in my life?  Awesome, I'll tell you.
Rachel and I now have a duplex which I will be moving into on the 17th of December (or at least start the moving process).  As of right now we're trying to get a friend of ours named Kristin to be our third roommate (seeing as the place has three bedrooms and we would need a 3rd person to help with rent etc.), and I'm hoping that will work.  But to be quite honest, I would MUCH MUCH MUCH rather for Katie (you heard me right Kate, YOU!) to move in with us.  It's a very minor detail that she is currently living in New Hampshire...or did your parents actually move to another state?  Anyways....I think it would be just absolutely FRICKIN' AWESOME!!!!!!!  To live with my best friend and sister?
It wouldn't be hard at all to find a job, Mom and Dad have already adopted you, Kentucky still gets snow in the winter, you know me and I know you, there's an Orthodox church in town (a good one if you ask me ^_~), you can go to UK with me and major in photography (I'm pretty sure they have a good photography college, that's something worth checking out), you wouldn't have to worry about living with psycho girls who will all of a sudden freak out on you, I wouldn't have to worry about living with a psycho girl who will all of a sudden freak out on me, it would be a chance for you to be independant but still be with loved ones and have support, there are a lot of good hospitals in town, the city is small enough that it's not difficult to get around, gas prices are 1.98 right now, you would finally get to meet Hunter, there would be no wild parties for you to worry about (or for me to worry about), I understand how bad your headaches are and I would never ever roll my eyes at you or think you're faking it, I'm your best friend, Kentucky is a beautiful state, we would actually see each other more than once a year, and it would help you clear your head.  Plus, you wouldn't have to go to school if you didn't want to.  :D
*ahem*  Anyhoo....just something to think about...........please......please..........I would be your best friend forever!  oh wait......heh.....^_^
So that's awesome, my sister will be moving into the place before the 3rd because she has to vacate her current apartment by then.  She's already gotten rid of her cat which is a very good thing, and we won't have any pets or anything like that.  What's really awesome about this place is that the rent is free until January, hence the whole moving in so quickly.  I would move sooner if it weren't for school, but I just can't move and do school.  Nope sorry.
Okay so you walk in the door, straight ahead to the left are the stairs, straight to the right is the hallway.  You turn right from the hallway into the kitchen which has enough space for an eating area.  There's already a refridgerator, and the adjoining ""closet"" has a washer and dryer.  The actual objects, not just the hookups.  Through a door in the ""laundry room"" is the garage.  YES WE HAVE A GARAGE!  (one car, but still!)
If you keep walking through the hallway there's a HUG walk in closet on the left (right under the stairs) and then there's the living room.  It is really big, the width of our entire side of the duplex.  There are two backdoors leading out to a communal-like backyard.  (About ten other houses/apartments/duplexes have access to it).
Up the stairs straight ahead is the master bedroom.  It also has a walk in closet and a private bathroom.  Rachel will be getting that room because she has a queen sized bed.  (which doesn't both me at all because I just have a twin.  It's teeny-tiny like me.  TRAVEL SIZE!)  Then leaving the master bedroom both of the other rooms are on the left, while the other bathroom is straight across the hall.
The only problem is that the third room is teeny tiny.  I honestly think that it was meant to be an office.  So if we get the Kristin person to live with us, she'll get it.  But if, IF you (Katie) live with us, I would take the smaller.  Why?  Because I'm cool like that.  :)  Hehe, anyway, both rooms have nice sized closets and that's that.
Rent is $850 a month, utilities aren't included, but divided three ways it wouldn't equal that much.  Rachel and I are guessing that each person would be paying $320 a month.
So yuppers, I'm very very excited.  I finally feel FREE!  I mean, yes I won't have any money to speak of, and yes my free time will be taken up with work and school, well....what else is new?
I'm going to apply for some jobs with UK.  I figure, if they pay me 8 an hour or so, then I could work a lot less, which means more time to focus on school since I'll be taking difficult classes next semester.  Not impossible classes, but difficult nonetheless.
So news about Mom and Dad, and Nathaniel too in a way.
They're moving.  To another town.
Yup.
See, Dad is thinking about going back into surgery.  He would be working in Berea (where he currently works at the ER), but he would only be doing actual surgery, the business end would be handled by the hospital, which is good.  That's where he messed up last time, because he tried to run a surgery practice when he knows nothing about business.
See for me, it would be the exact opposite!  I wouldn't be able to cut somebody open...well...I wouldn't be able to put them back together ;)....but I feel pretty confident that once I finish school I would be able to take care of the business end.  No, I'm not saying I'm going to work for my parents.  *shudder*  That would be bad.
But either way, even if he doesn't do the whole surgery thing, they are still going to move to Berea.  They found a house, and I'll be going down to see it Friday morning at 7:30AM.  yay.  Actually, I'm excited to do so because it sounds really nice.
It's big.  That's really all I can get from the description...and it's on 10 acres worth of land.  And there's a guest house with two bedrooms, a full kitchen, and living room.  (and bathroom of course).  So guess where Nathaniel will be living?  The guest house.  Which is great for him, because he'll have ""independence"" (not really since he'll be living on his parent's property but I'm not going to point that out to him) but still be near enough for them to take care of him.  See, with the chronic fatigue he won't be working...in fact this Saturday is his last day at his current job.  So he won't be paying rent...once again, whatever.  But anyhoo, Mom, Dad, and Nathaniel will be living in Berea from now on.  Well, not NOW now, but soon.
I'm guessing that they'll be down there by Christmas, which means I'll be traveling for Christmas.  Strange.
Actually, everything that's happening is really good.  My Mom is just DELIGHTED with the new place!  Plus there will be enough room for her to get another Great Pyrenese.  She just LOVES that type of breed!  (We used to have one, her name was Bella and she was sweeter than our Liza!!  But somebody stole her.  :""(  )
So that's good.
Plus Dad is excited because he really misses surgery.  So now, the only thing they're waiting on is if the hospital will do it.  heh.
The good news is that they won't be very far away and there is room in the house for me and Rachel to visit.  The bad news is that they are far enough away that I wouldn't be able to visit them too often with school.  The summer I probably could because I won't be working very single day, but I'll be taking summer school too.  *sigh*  It's good, very good, but I know that I won't see them as much as I would like.  Because believe it or not I really do love my family.  And lately my parents have just been awesome to be around.  I think it's because they aren't worried about me anymore.  Granted, they're worried that I work too much, or take too many hours, or blah blah blah...but they're not worried about me being happy.  :)
I swear they like Hunter more than me.  ;)
Oh yeah, when Dad was telling me about the house he said, and I quote ""...and when you and Hunter get married y'all can live in the guest house!""  to which I replied ""..uuuhhh........""
Hehehe.  My Dad has already accepted that it's going to happen, which means so has Mom.  And Rachel told me yesterday that she always knew I would marry before her.
Geez people give us another three years before you start planning anything!!!!
But I do love my family.
Hmmmm what else, what else.....I think that's it.  I'll be going on a skiing trip with Hunter's family sometime during break...if all goes well as ar as the moving thing/money thing goes.
Ummm...umm...umm.....Happy Thanksgiving!!!!  (I baked a cake.  It actually turned out really well!  First time for me.  Then I decorated it with Vanilla and Chocolate icecream.  I put swirls on it.  I like decorating cakes.  ^_^)
Oh yeah!!!!!
Tanya, my boss at Graeters...the only boss that has ever cared about me...is being moved to Northern Kentucky and is being given the busiest Graeters in KY.  Wow!  So I'm definitely going to miss her.  But she's excited, though she's really, really, really, going to miss her store.  I can tell you right now she'll never get a crew as awesome as us!  But oh well.  People can't stay where they are forever, and eventually the current crew will leave, one by one.
So Angela (my roommate at Asbury) will be given a manager's job and one of the Lexington stores.  Possibly my store.  Which is much better than the other manager who would be getting it!  (Her name's Pam, I'm sure she's nice, but her store is just kinda' there.  Nothing special).  Anyways, the fact that Tanya is leaving will help free me up to leave too.  I would like to stay at Graeters, especially if I can't find a better paying job, but I don't want to be there forever.
I'm pretty sure that's really all that's going on.  You know, same ole' same ole'.  Heh.
Oh yeah, Hunter is home right now.  Yeah...I started to miss him before he had even left.
Yeah....he's going home for almost two weeks during Christmas break.  *sigh*
I'm going to be working....a lot.
:(
But, I'd much rather be missing him, then not missing someone else.  That didn't make sense.  *shrug*  Oh well.  Have I mentioned how happy I am?  I've never smiled this much...except maybe when I was a little kid.  :)

If only, I had more time,
I would take you where you wanted to go.
Japan is really nice this time of year.
If only, I had one wish,
I would want a million trillion lifetimes that I could spend with you
Falling in love with you, again and again."

"event","Okay I'm going to start this off by saying that I had a really, really, really, really fun night last night.  :D  Hunter took me to a Hafla!  (A hafla is an Arabic dance, and this one was being given by members of my church)
Both of my siblings went, Rachel and Nathaniel, and Ashleigh Graves went as my bro's date.  She is really awesome!  I will readily admit that I had my doubts about her when I was at Asbury, but now I've come to find that she just didn't know me/was shy.  It's a long story as to why she and NMB went together, suffice it to say that Hunter and I are evil.  }:^)  In any case, I had gotten the chance to hang out with Ashleigh a little when Hunter, Ashleigh, another friend of Ashleigh's and I went to see Bewitched at the dollar theater.  So that was good for me, she's a sweet, sweet girl if you get to know her.
Anyways, yeah, we all had loads of fun!  Oh yeah, Rachel ""went"" with Michael AND Timothy Gallaway.  Hehe, she's such a player.  ;)  I'm so very glad that Timmy went, though he didn't dance hardly at all, I don't think he was feeling that great.  (Tired and what not)
Where was I?  Oh yeah, fun.
So here's some pictures for y'all.  I would tell you all the wonderful details, but my guess is that most of y'all would be bored, so I'll spare ya' 'cause I'm just cool like that.  Heh.  Suffice it to say that, yeah, Hunter got his groove on with me, and he was doing very well.  :)  I'm so proud of him for dancing, I just had a blast peoples!  Keep in mind, it's not just straight up dancing, it's all Arabic dancing.  So that's a lot harder then you'd think.  But my darlin' was doing better than most of the Arab dudes.  HA!
Did I mention that I'm dating a really hot guy?  No?  Well, I am.

"event","Instead of studying for my three exams like a good little girl I decided to update this.  Why?  Because I've spent the past century studying for said three exams, and now I'm getting tired of it.  So there.
In any case, hi people!  How are y'all?  I'm doing well, thank you.  Haven't heard from y'all in awhile, but I understand it's because everyone is so freakishly busy.  Plus the fact that I rarely update/read y'alls blogs doesn't help.
Right now I'm having to try and find my English 110 papers from when I was at Asbury.  Why?  Because the English:Writing Center wants to look over them to decide whether or not my writing style is up to par with their standards.  If it is, then I get to enroll in ENG 203 (Business Writing for all those Business majors).  If it is deemed not up to par then I get to enroll in ENG 101.  Yeah.  I am...shall we say...shaky fisting the entire college network.  Both Asbury and UK.  Heck, I'll throw in LCC while I'm at it.  *shaky fist*
But wait, there's more.
UK is not going to accept the A I received in MA 109 from LCC.  Oh no, because I took that class at another college!  So I had to take a placement test.  Alright, no big deal.  I can smoke this baby!  Well...yeah.  There were only 12 questions.  I had 25 minutes.  And half of said questions were Trigonometry and Geometry.  I've never learned Trig and I barely touched on Geometry back when I was a Freshman in highschool.  The other half were College level Algebra.
So guess what happened?  I got 6 out of 12 right.  I smoked the material I knew.  The rest of it...yeah.  As of right now, I don't know what this means though.  I'm trying to get into MA 123 (Calculus).  The reason I can skip Trig and go straight to Calc is because the first half of the Calc class is Trig.  Doesn't make sense, I know.  But whatever.
Basically, I just might be adding another year onto my college career.  Which means I might, MIGHT graduate at the age of 24.  Do you have any idea just how much that sucks?  I really am ready to be done.  Finished.  No more learning!  *sigh*
I do hate college.
Oh well.
I work tonight, Friday night, Saturday afternoon, and Sunday afternoon.
I have a class Thursday night, and then have to help Mom get ready for some Sunday school thing she's doing on Friday.
I have a Japanese exam Friday, an Economics exam Tuesday, and a Psychology exam Wednesday.
weeeee.
Sorry for the sarcasm.  I'm just a little tired of exams, and grades, and professors....and college...yeah.  Heh.
So I just got off the phone with the *evil* boss lady from the hat store.  I was enquiring after my paycheck.  For the third time.  (Still haven't been paid, yeah I quit that job at the beginning of October, arg).  She told me that, ""it will be ready Friday.""
LIE!
She told me that the first time too.  Only that was a month ago.
Then I left her two messages, one that was written, and one on the phone.
She never got in touch with me.
So finally I called the shop, and she answered.
Then she started complaining about how complicated everything is, how much she misses me, and how awesome I am blah blah blah.  Then I say, ""where's my money"" (only I'm a little nicer about it.  a little).  She says that she's gone through two accountants now, and the NEW one will have it ready by friday.
Funny, the other one supposedly HAD it ready, by Friday of last month.
So...yeah.  I told her I would be at the store by 3PM on Friday.
We'll certainly see if it's there.
If it's not I'm going to start complaining.
I WANT MY EFFING MONEY YOU WITCH!
But the good news is that I'm signed up for all my classes next semester.  Even though technically I'm not supposed to be enrolled in ENG 203 and MA 123, the computer let me do it.  So I figure, hey, why not?  If nothing else, I'll hold a spot open in case I am allowed to take them.
So I'll be taking 15 hours, JPN 202, ECO 202, MA 123, ENG 203, and BIO 103.  (evil biology)  Hopefully, I'll have all but one of my classes on MWF/MW, and that way I can work on Tuesday and Thursday, Friday night, Saturday morning, and possibly Sunday night.
Because I'll be living in an apartment, and I'll need to pay rent.
weeee.
:)
But I am having a nice day.  I'm thinking I'll be okay.  Just annoyed with school, but *shrug* what else is new?  Jaa matta!  *see you later*"

"event","So I'm officially..well...official.  21 baby!  Wooo!!!!  What's funny is that I haven't had any alcohol yet.  *shrug*  So far, there's been no reason for it.
So, what's been happening in my life you ask?  Why, how kind of you to wonder.  Let me try and be brief, I have work soon.
School has now become a constant struggle of me caring, then getting my butt handed to me because of a test, then I freak out, then I stop caring for a day, then I start trying harder and start caring, then I get my butt handed to me because of a test...you get the idea.
But it's good for me, I'm doing some serious character building.  Though I'd say most of the building is coming from me trying so hard to be patient.  Oh man I cannot convey just how much I WANT school to be over.  ALL OF IT!
The saving grace of school is my Monday night Japanese tutoring group.  I've made friends with some of the people in my JPN class via the group, and I've also made friends with five of the Japanese students who are here for a year.  They're all really cool, and for some strange reason, they think I am too.  (Instead of thinking I'm loud, and obnoxious, and blonde)
Hmmm...maybe Japanese don't use the word ""blonde"" when talking about a ditz because there aren't any blondes over there...interesting.  Omoshiroi desu ne.
What else, what else.  Well, my family's realtor is selling our house...which means we're moving.  Not sure where to as of yet.  But somewhere in Lexington, so never fear.  The only problem right now is that we don't know if we're even allowed to buy a house.  Big deal with the whole bankruptcy thing.
My car is running quite well, though it had a moment of stubborness earlier this week, and my computer is also being tame.  They're plotting, I just know it!  It's been too quiet lately!  Heh.
HOPEFULLY Katie will be coming down for Thanksgiving, which would just rock the frickin' casba!  Oh man, I hope everything works out!  Then y'all could meet her and finally meet someone who's just like me...only different.  Heh.
*just as a sidenote:  Mom was watching ""the top 50 (or 100, not sure) fashion don'ts"" on some random evil, popular channel.  Yeah, I only saw ten, but I definitely break two of the rules.  Hehehe.  They don't like fishnets/stockings with patterns....but I do so :P"", they also don't like puffy shirts...which I can understand.  But I own one, and wear it quite often.  So once again, :P"" I spit upon your silly rules!  Patoo, patoo!*
Ummm...oh yeah, I have two hermit crabs now.  (Birthday present from my sister, very random, but cool nonetheless)  Herb and yasekokete iru...or yaseko for short.  (means scrawny, and he's a little guy).
Hunter has broken the mold of the conventional ""boyfriend"" by doing just about anything he can to help me with, well, everything.  i.e. waking up at 6AM on a Friday to drive me to school.  Because I had to study for an exam, and as he put it ""once I call you to wake you up, I won't go back to sleep, so why not?""  *sigh*  Have I mentioned how happy I am?  I haven't?  well, I'm extremely happy.
Teehee!
That boy has turned me into a giddy little schoolgirl DANG IT!

In any case, haven't updated for awhile, and got the sudden urge to do so while at work this evening.  Only problem is that I got of thirty minutes later than expected, and now I don't feel like it anymore.  Heh, go figure eh?  Well, just to let y'all know, tonight was my last night EVER to work at the hat store.  *does a happy dance*  I'm sooooo giddy!  :D  The owner actually gave me a hat too.  Which is kinda' weird and confusing, but oh well.  The hat she gave me is almost 300 dollars.  Yeah.  In any case, I don't see myself ever wearing it...in public.  It's kinda....strange.  *shrug*  But it was still very nice of her!  :)
From 7:30PM to 10:45PM all I did was cut paper.  You heard it right, I was cutting her business cards.  (She'll make small sizes and put like six on one page, and then copy it, so I had to cut all six out of the paper if you will).  Yeah.  It was....slightly annoying.  Mainly mind numbing.  But whatever.  I'm not really upset about it, not like it was hard labor or anything.
I worked Graeters this morning, so that's the main reason why I'm so tired.  (10AM to 11:45PM with a thirty minute ""break"" that was spent changing uniforms and driving to second job).
The good news is that yesterday was fun.  :D
Hunter and I went hiking at red river gorge.  Yeah, we never actually FOUND the trailhead, but we found some little paths that were sorta' kinda' used.  There was even some rock climbing to be done.  It was neat.  At one point I slipped and fell...but luckily the ground stopped my fall.  Heh.  On the way back to where we thought the car was we found an ITTY BITTY turtle!  It was so small and cute!  Hehe, I loved it so.  Sadly it's not one of those things you can just take home with you.  *sigh*.
Oh, and we did find the car.  Go us!
The was the first ""date"" we've been on for a long time.  And sadly it looks like we won't get to go on another one 'til New Years.  :(  Oh well, that's just part of school and work.  At least we're both working so much that we don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves.  Heh.
I'm hoping that after I finish some JPN homework and studying for my JPN exam I can e-mail my Japanese penpal, update again, and read everyone else's blogs!  Yeah, that'd be nice.

Oh, check this out, once Mom gets back from NC I will take more picture because I've made A LOT more than what's on there...but still.  It's a start, no?

www.geocities.com/nikko_designs

That's my web site.  *yay*  (given up on ecrafters)

Nope.  Still hate it!  Heh.
Actually, I'm not going to stay up too much later.  I have to read a 5 page article and then answer some questions before my 10AM tomorrow.  Which technically isn't a big deal.  But these articles are murder to get through!  They're for Biology, and this class is just full of ""Humans should die because they're killing the earth"" theories.  I hates it so!  Heh, oh well.
In any case, this particular article is on the growing economies and how transporting goods is bad and we should stop doing it.  (Because we're also transporting bugs and plants etc.)  Now don't get me wrong, I agree that it's bad to all of a sudden introduce a new species to a certain Biological community/ecosystem.  But goodness people!  It's like their solution to everything is to wipeout the human race!  Now granted, I'm exaggerrating...but just a little.  ;)
Anyhoo, gotta' finish reading this thing so I can wake up at 6AM tomorrow to type the answers.
Woohoo!
Oh yeah, in other news I have a blister the size of a big nickel on my big toe.  The top of my toe at that.  Long story, basically there was a hole in my sock and nothing I could do about it because I was walking to school from my car.  I was limping all day, which is pathetic I know.  But what can you do?  It hurt so bad!

I don't know about my biology one yet
and I didn't get a perfect score on my japanese quiz.  Though I did get 18 out of 20
so all in all, school sucks.
But what else is new with my perspective towards that are of my life?
I'm excited about this weekend because my church's festival will take place...and yes I realize that none of these sentences are arranged correctly, but I can't really figure out why.  give me a break, I just got off work and I'm sleepy.
In other news....right.  Church festival.  *yay*  It's going to be fun.  I really do like the dancing.  Though sometimes the practice gets...annoying.  Really quickly.  Heh.
I AM quitting the hat store.  My last day will be October 8th.  Why?  Because the owner just isn't that great of a boss.  I really don't like her, and I need a job where I know when I'll be working, how long, and for how much.  That way I can schedule my studying time.
Speaking of, I'm loving Japanses tutoring still!  Though I'm pretty upset with my teacher as far as normal class goes, the Japanese students are really neat.
My teacher never calls on me.  Yet he calls on other people two to three times each class period.  Which means that there is enough for everybody.  Except me apparently.  So I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.  *sigh*
I made a new set of jewelry.  Earrings, Necklace, and Bracelet/ring combo again.  I really like it.  Black wire, white beads.  It's neat.
I'm making a web site with geocities.  It's almost done, all I really need to do now is finish taking pictures of all of my new stuff and move the stuff around on my site.  Once it's finished I'll leave a link.  I'm going to get business cards in October.  Yay!
Hmmmm.......That's really all.  I saw corpse bride.  I liked it, not as good as Nightmare, but it was still really good.  Sadly the whole time I was still worrying over my bad exam grade.
Bless Hunter he wouldn't stop until he cheered me up!  :)
I have no money, but I've figured out a schedule that may in fact let me start a savings account.
If I work Tuesday and Wednesday nights as a supervisor, Friday night as a crew and Saturday morning as a supervisor I will make enough money to pay all my expenses (including gas and about $15 worth of random food etc. every two weeks) I will have about $100 every two weeks for savings/emergencies.  Now granted, some weeks I'll spend more, and some I'll work less.  But all in all this will work.  I'm not absolutely sure with taxes so I was just taking out like 8% of the Net Pay.  I'm guessing that's less than the actual taxes...but yeah.
Anyways.
I'm going to bed now.
I work at the hat store tomorrow, the owner is trying to convince me to not quit and I'm really getting sick of her.
I work Graeter's Thursday night.
I'll be dancing Saturday and Sunday.
And that's really all.  :)
Oh, my weight loss is actually due to stress more than anything else, so hopefully going back to one job will help.

I have two exams tomorrow, Biology and Psychology.  which technically means that I shouldn't really care if I do poorly on both.  But then again, this is me that's talking!  Heh.  Yeah, so I'm really nervous that I'm will get a bad grade.  *sigh*
See, I got a B on my Japanse exam.  I'm very sad about that.  Seeing as it's my major and all, I'm a little perturbed with myself for doing so terrible on that exam.  Especially since ""Japanese is my thing!""
Pssshhhh.  Oh well, I also have a JPN quiz tomorrow, so hopefully I'll do really well and that will help to make up for my poor showing.  I'll have time to study for the quiz tomorrow before the class.  *hooray for one hour lunch breaks!*
Anyways, yeah, these two exams are back-to-back.  I HATE that!  Oh well.
I'm taking a break, if you hadn't noticed.  See, I've been typing onto wordpad everything that my online textbook has been talking about.  (This is for PSY)  Why not just write down notes?  Because that takes longer.  Really, the only reason I wasn't just READING the stupid thing is because I don't really learn by reading/hearing things.  I HAVE to do them.  (That whole, kinetic learner/spatial learner thing coming into play).  So it helps me to remember textbook stuff if I type or write it out as I go.
Yuppers.
Needless to say, I'm sick of the computer, I've been sitting here since 5:30PM.  Yay.
I'm hoping that tomorrow evening I can take a small break and actually UPDATE this thing!  I mean seriously, this poor blog thinks I hate it.  (it's okay Becca-blog-thingy, I don't hate you).
Yeah, I have another exam October 4th for Economics.  Then I'll have my SECOND exam in Psychology on my BIRTHDAY!  grrrrrrr.  *shaky fist*
All in all, I really dislike the Psychology class the most.  Why?  I don't like the teacher.  He's mean.  Now granted, I don't really expect him to be all that personable with this 500 student class, but he could at least not yell at us.  :P"" to him.
Remember how my history class last semester kept me up at all hours of the night doing meaningless busy-work?  Yup.  That's Psychology this year!  Oh I can't WAIT 'til I have to stay up 'til 4AM to read/write something!  So excited about that, let me tell you.
Especially since that whole not being able to wake up/hear my alarm thing has already kicked in.  Go Becca!  yup, I've definitely missed two seperate classes already.  *sigh*  Actually, it wouldn't be half as bad if I didn't have to walk thirty to forty minutes to class in the morning, plus that whole 15 to 20 minute drive before hand!  Grrrr!!!!!  Basically, the past week I've missed the shuttle from the parking lot every morning.  Every, morning.
Oh well.
I've already lost weight from all the walking/eating of healthier food.  yay?  I dunno.  I'm hoping to replace that lost weight with muskles (I like it with a hard K sound so much better!)....eventually.
Once again I say *sigh*
In other news?  Oh that whole hat job thing?  It's doing better now, but for about two weeks there I was seriously thinking that I would have to quit.  Or that I as going to get fired, which at the time, would not have bothered me!
Ugh.
To summarize, I hadn't been paid for a month and a week (actually, AT ALL) and the day they finally paid me it was wrong.  The amount that is.
It was REALLY wrong!  First off, the amount per hour was under by a dollar, so I had to bring that to the attention of the owner.  (Though I had caught that earlier and told the person who showed me that it was wrong, and they SAID they would fix it.  USOTSUKI!)  Anyway, Secondly the amount of hours on the check were under by...oh let's see......27 hours!
So anyways....I made a copy of my pay stub for the owner, and circled everything that was wrong.  Left a very polite note, and then pulled the accounting card on her and figured out exactly how much she really owed me.  I even divided how much the amount being witheld for each tax thingy by the total amount to get the exact percentages.  Meaning, I figured that the LFUCG tax takes say 0.0220365 percent and so on and so forth.
Thus, I was able to figure out how much to take out of my new hours/pay rate total amount.
Yuppers, I had fun.
Okay I have to go now.
Oh yeah!  Meg, I did get the message, hopefully we can reschedule, I do understand though.  Where do you work?"

Eevn though I know heaven is going to be better than ANYTHING else that I could EVER dream of.......it's definitely got it's work cut out for it.
Why?
Because I just saw Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.
I kid you not, it was wonderful.  Heavenly.
Just right.
It was sad too.
Oh man how I miss Aeris!  I just....it sucks.  See, for those of you who don't know this...which would mean Katie, Meg, and Stina, she was killed in the video game.  And I never really forgave the producers/director/write for that.  But in a way, it was necessary, because even at the end when Cloud (i.e. you the gamer) beats Sephiroth (the most Bad A boss out there, he blows everybody else outta' the water!) it still doesn't keep this meteor the size of a small planet from plummeting down to the game's version of earth.
But Aeris (who is ""dead"") was the one who actually stopped it.  She couldn't have done so if she had still be alive.  See, when anything dies in this universe, they go to something called the lifestream.  It's all very hippy ""let's love the planet"", but oh well.  Anyways, Aeris, who was part of the life stream, actually made it form a protective barrier around the planet ('cause she just ROCKS like that) and strike back at the meteor.
So Aeris saved the entire planet.
and she stayed dead.
:""(
SPOILER ALERT!!!!!  (more so than the last one)
In the movie, she is in it a little, but only as flashbacks/more lifestream stuff.
I did however, get to see her face rendered in CG.

http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y201/BebopFan/AerisFace.jpg

That made me happy.
Y'all have got to understand, I am FANATICAL with anything Final Fantasy, ESPECIALLY FFVII!
*sigh*  Anyways, I enjoyed my little stroll down memory lane while watching the movie.  Such a good movie.
Can't wait to actually own the real DVD!  I'm so glad Hunter downloaded this for me though.  So very glad!  :D"

"event","So I just finished talking on the phone with one of my many bosses.  I had been scheduled to work at both Graeters and Create-A-Hat on Friday evening.  heh...yeah.  Still haven't figured out how to split myself in half, so obviously that was a problem.  Luckily I called around and finally got somebody at the hat store to take that shift.  *sigh*  Only condition is that Saturday the 24th I'll be working the night at C-A-H.  Which means that I'll be working a double that day.  (opening Graeters that morning)  bleh.
In other news, I have a Japanese exam this Friday....which is bad because I don't know ANY of the material it's covering!  I HATE being behind!  Then I have a Psychology exam the Monday after (the 19th), then a Biology exam that following Friday (23rd).  Now, somewhere thrown in that mix will be an Economics exam.  On a Tuesday or a Thursday.  Just for kicks and giggles.
I swear I'm going to die.
It's not that these are hard classes, I mean, the Japanese is a lot tougher this year than last year, but that's partially due to my having a different professor and thus, different teaching style.  My current JPN teacher expects a lot more out of us, and I can tell that he thinks we're all idiots.  But I'm working and that's cutting into my studying time.  What's worse, is if you were to look at my schedule, it wouldn't look like I'm doing all that much.  I have school Mon., Wed., Fri. from 10A to 2P, Tues. and Thurs. from 9:30A to 10:45A.  (and on Thurs. I have a lab from 3:30P to 4:50P) not that bad right?  Well, I have to be AT school BY 9AM to get a parking space.  Then I'll LEAVE school around 2:45 or 3 depending on if I ran from class to catch the bus on time.
Then on Wed. and Fri. I work at C-A-H from 4:30P to approx. 10:30 P on W, and 11:15P on F.  Also, I will *hopefully* be working Graeters on Tues. from 5:30P to 10:45P, and Sat. from 10A to 5P.  (technically I'm scheduled on Mondays at Graeters, but there's Japanese tutoring Monday nights, and since I don't have Aikido anymore I can work Tuesdays)
So basically, I'm only working 24 to 25 hours a week.  Not that bad at all right?  Right.  So why am I never home????????  Well, I might be working Sunday nights now at the hat store, but that's still only from 2:30P to 6:30P.  Just four hours.
I think the fact that I go straight from school to work, on Wed. and Fri.  And then Sunday I'm at church until 2, sometimes even 4 PM, like today.  (Dance practice lasted for 2 hours.  Did we accomplish anything?  Nope.  I was mad.  Very mad!)
Basically, if I could just make myself study after work, and then start waking up an hour and a half earlier even to study, I'll be doing alright.  I need to be studying 30 hours a week.  (Technially 26, but Japanese requires more study time)

That gives me...26 hours and fifteen minutes of studying.  That's ONLY if I adhere to this schedule for the rest of the semester.  How am I going to get another three hours and forty-five minutes???
ARG!
Okay, let's see.....that gives me 49 hours and forty-five minutes of sleep in the week....TECHNICALLY an average adult needs 56 hours.

"event","No, I'm not dead.  Just.....*sigh*...I'm going to say it....busy.
THERE I SAID IT!
Heh.
Umm....let's see....school taking up my entire life, with the occasional stint scooping icecream or making hat pins.  I'm not in Aikido anymore because an *evil* old teacher was able to do some legal something and take over the club of Ronin Bushido.  So while my current teacher opened up a new dojo in Winchester, I don't have the time to drive to Winchester every Monday/Wednesday night for three hours.  I will get back into it sometime soon, but not right now.  :(
I'm also having to drop drumming lessons.  If I'm not working on Thursday night, I'm studying.
Also, voice lessons are going to be a ""Whenever we both have a free hour of time"" deal.  I will have a lesson tomorrow RIGHT AFTER school, and RIGHT BEFORE work.  But then, we're not sure when the next lesson will be.
It's so sad!  I don't like being this busy!  Oh yeah, and my church is having it's annual heritage festival the first weekend of October (Y'all had better come and laugh!) so I'm doing dance practice every Sunday afternoon before work.  It's going to suck when they try to have an extra lesson sometime during the week!
Even though I'm cleaning my room everyday, it's still a wreck.  A sign of just how frickin' much is going on right now!  Everything that's out is stuff that I'm going to be using in the next couple of hours or so.  Blarg!
I've been invited to do a Star Wars campaign by Lance, Hunter's roommate.  I just laughed.
I think my family is expecting me to want to plan something big for my birthday.  But I honestly can't think of anything I WANT to do except relax and spend time with my fam/close friends!  Obviously I DO NOT want to go out and get drunk.  I don't really even want to drink.  It would be like I was having a drink just becuase I turned 21.  Silly reason if you ask me.  Not saying I won't EVER drink alcohol, I don't really view it as something evil.  I just don't see any real need to do so now.  Honestly, if it's not a really big event, what's the point?
The good thing about being 21 is that I can go into Karaoke bars and sing.  Teehee!
Oh, and one more thing that I'll be adding to my Fall roster:  Japanese tutoring on Monday nights from 5 to 6:30PM.  Meaning, I will be helped with my Japanese.  I might be able to help the 101 students...but I doubt that.  In any case, it'll be fun, but it's just one more thing.  sigh.
Silly languages and the extra time they require to study effectively.
And once again, the release date for Final Fantasy VII Advent children has been pushed back.  How far? you ask?  Oh....NOVEMBER FRICKING 30TH!!!!!  ARRRRRRRRRRRRRG!!!!!!!  The only reason this is so very frustrating is because the official trailer had September 14th posted.
I got my hopes up, again.
sigh.
Luckily I was able to reserve a copy at Gamestop.
Oh well.
I'm really not all that aggravated in general.  Just when that movie is brought up.  ;)
I'm trying to start a healthier eating habit.  You know, cut out the sticks of pure butter with sugar......oh and I'm going to be throwing out the bucket of lard that I use for seasoning....*joking*
No but seriously, I am going to stop eating so much fast food.  Dangerous that stuff is!  Anyhoo.....yup.  That about sums it up!
Tune in a week or so from now, and I might update again.  :)"

"event","Okay, I'm going to lay it out on the line.  I'm tired.  And while yes, I know that not only have I been saying that since I started this thing way back when and all of y'all are tired too, the statement remains true.
Friday at work sucked.  It was just bad.  I haven't had a day off for 10 days now, and I'm not going to have one for another 4 days.  Actually, to be quite honest, I about died with giddyness when I found out that I'll be having Thursday night off from both of my jobs.  I was beyond ecstatic!  I actually called me sister to tell her, and made her put my friend Timothy on the phone so I could tell him.  And I called Hunter as soon as I found out and left a voicemail saying ""I have a day off!!!! teeehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe!!!""  Though it probably sounded like some squirrel voice chittering about who knows what.
In any case, Friday night, I lost it.  Utterly and completely just could not function any longer.  Which is bad because I was at Graeters, and I was the supervisor.  Plus, I only had two crew instead of the usual three.  And while we weren't crazy busy, we were busier than I was expecting.  Well, I was serving drive-thru and just barely remembering what people were ordering.  All of a sudden I just started crying.  And I couldn't stop.  Luckily for me, the drive-thru people are so obvlivious to the fact that a human being is serving them that they didn't even notice.  But I had to get my guy Adam to take over the drive-thru, and I just tried to scoop.  Yeah, didn't work.  I had to go to the back of the store!  I actually had to leave my two boys because I couldn't handle it any longer!  I'm still really mad about doing that.  But there's just no way that you can serve a customer while you're bawling.  Not gonna' happen.
So I sat on the floor with my back to the freezer and cried.
Then I got up and got back to work.  Granted, I wasn't operating at optimum levels, but I did okay.  I was in zombie mode and couldn't really smile or chit chat.  Oh well.
The good thing is that Hunter came by and helped us close.  :)  Awwwwwwww.  I really do appreciate it when he does that, but like I've told him before, it makes me feel guilty that I can't go and help HIM close at work.  *sigh*  Oh well.  Either way, I really needed that hug.
The fact of the matter is, I'm scared.  I'm so scared that I'm not going to do well in school this year because it's a bigger campus, the classes are huge, the professors are a lot less understanding, and I already have homework piled up that I can't do.  I could technically be doing it now, but I only have five more minutes before I get to go to work, so that's not going to happen.  So after work tonight, instead of getting to go to bed, I get to do my psychology, biology, and japanese homework.  See, to get into the college of business; accounting, I'm going to have to maintain a grade point average of at LEAST 3.2.  While that may not be all that difficult for y'all, it's going to kill me.  I have no problem getting a good grade in classes that have to do with accounting.  But I'm really, really, really worried about pysch and bio.  And my Japanese class this year is killing me!  The teacher is english, so he expects a lot more from us than my previous japanese lady.  What's worse is that we're REVIEWING chapter 5 and then going on to new material.  The problem with this is that my previous class never finished chapter 4.  That's right folks.  I'm a full chapter and a half behind!  Woohoo!  Oh, I've already had a quiz, and I'm fairly certain I failed it.
I'm not getting an A in that class unless I work my butt off.  Which isn't a problem, except I'll be working my butt of for at least psych, and technically I should be spending all my energy on Economics since that's a major class.  I ONLY HAVE ONE BUTT PEOPLE!!!!!!!
man.
And the fact that I have at least 2 and a half more years.  oh wow I'm sick of it.  I'm so very sick of it and I'm trying really hard to not think about my life right now.  Because the next 2 and a half years (give or take) are 2 1/2 years that I don't want to happen.
I keep telling myself I'll get a break after that.
But I probably won't because I'll have to start working even more fulltime than I already am.
Our region's Bishop came to visit church today.  That was neat.  I really like this bishop, he's the first American/convert to be ordained.  :)  Well, anyways, in his sermon today I just found it funny that he mentioned something about how if we all saw the big picture of our life, and saw what was going to be happening to us, we wouldn't want to get out of bed.
Amen.
So his advice was to take things one step at a time.  Very good advice.  I'm trying really hard.
The hardest part tonight at work will be to not think about tomorrow.
because I'm really not looking forward to tomorrow.
or tuesday
or wednesday....
I'm sorta' looking forward to Thursday.  Because I won't have to go in to work that night after school.  I'll probably get home around 5:30.  So that'll be nice.  I'll have an entire evening to catch up on school.  :)  *yay*
okay, I have to go to work now.
It sucks that Tanya is making me come in at 4 instead of 4:30.  I'm just now realizing how much thirty minutes is.
It's always when you lose something that you start to appreciate it.  Gotta' work on that.
Don't think that I think my life is worse than y'alls.  It's not.  I've got things going pretty well in the grand cosmic scheme of things.
But that doesn't change the fact that I still want to cry.  And I'm sorry that I can't be more of a friend and pay more attention to y'all's lives."

Okay, I have to go to work in fifteen minutes, and I'm not dressed yet.  BUT!  I wanted to really quickly update and say that my first day of school went well.  I'm quite tired, and my books are heavier than last semester, but oh well.
I have two back to back classes, and then an hour long break before my last class on Mon., Wed., and Fri.  On Tues. and Thurs. I have an Economics class at 9:30, and then I will be begging the proffessor of a Business Writing class at 12:30 to let me sit in on the class until drop add.  *fingers crossed*
Either way, the Economics class is much more important, so yeah.
Setting up my e-mail account took FOREVER!  I had forgotten my password, so I had to go to the IT place and fill out a form requesting a new one.  But now it won't work.
It will let me access the account manager e-mail part, just not my actual inbox!  Hahaha.  But that's okay.  I just had it forward all my e-mails to another account.  Woopie.
I briefly saw Hunter, for about fifteen minutes.  YAY I got a hug today!  :)
I have a parking permit for the stadium parking lot....which is about a thirty to forty minute walk.  So I'll be taking the shuttle from there.  ugh.  Oh well, it could be good.  Give me a chance to breathe before starting classes.
My room is a wreck again, but what else is new.
I had to take my car to the shop this morning at 7:30.  Apparently it was smoking, and I think I need an oil change, and some plastic is scraping against the road on the front of my car.  Hehe, poor thing.
So yuppers, that's really all.
Oh, I already have a quiz to study for (Japanese, what else?) and I have a couple of assignments due Friday.  Can't wait to see what the Tuesday classes want from me!  *sigh*
In any case, like I said, I'm a little tired.  But that's okay.  Once I get into the groove of my schedule, things shouldn't be as bad.  But then again, they might be worse 'cause I'll have homework due and exams.....but then again, maybe it won't be so bad.  :)  I must try and be optimistic.
UK is frickin' HUGE!
Kentaaki Yunevaasetii wa ookii desu yo!

Translationg?  I am so tired!  So tired....sigh.
Can you tell I've been practicing Abenglabish?  Yuppers, I sure have!  Yesterday at Graeters I was mumbling to myself all day.  I think I scared my crew girl.  Heh, oh well.
Ummmm let's see.  Just got my haircut again.  Woohoo it's cute again!  :D  I also bought a new charger for my phone, seeing as my original one gave up the good fight.  *Sigh*  Bye bye money.  Thank goodness for 11 dollar haircuts!  Actually, I think I was overcharged (by like two dollars) because I had/have short hair, but I wasn't about to point that out to the person with the scissors.
*eyes shifting around room*  boy my room is a wreck!  You don't believe me?  It is.  More so than usual.  Probably because it's been about a week since I've bothered cleaning it.  Okay, so that's another thing to add to the list of things to do today.  It has been a fairly productive day though.  Mom and I went to the photographer's studio place to look at the screen print things (don't cringe Natalie and Katie, I really don't know what the proper photographer terms are.  Sorry!).  So we had to pick out about six to seven out of twenty one prints to keep.  Wasn't that hard in my opinion, but Mom was agonizing over it!  Heh, oh well.  A couple of things I've realized; I look a lot like my cousin Stacey.  Or rather, she looks like me since I'm older.  That's kidna' scary. Don't get me wrong she's not ugly, but she's.........not what I would have thought I was.  Which doesn't make sense.  Eh, in any case.  We have the same nose.  The Barrett nose.  Another thing, my left eye is smaller than my right eye.  This is especially noticable when I smile.  Why?  Because it looks like I'm cringing!  Hehehehehe.  Plus, the left side of my mouth gets wider than the right when I grin.  Hehehe, hooray for crooked faces!  :)  It adds a certain....character trait.  Well, enough about my face.
Or the pictures for that matter.
Hmmm hmmmm hmmm....what else what else?  DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHEN NATALIE IS COMING BACK TO THE WILMORE AREA?????  I tried calling her last night to see when she would arrive, and no answer.  *sigh*  I thought it was the 16th, but surely she would have called me to say she was here.  So yeah...anyways.
I really like my hat store place.  Granted, I've only worked there twice, but I will be working there tomorrow night, then Monday and Wednesday nights of next week.  ALSO I might be working Friday and/or Saturday nights this week.  Why?  Because they're having some scheduling conflicts.  Now then.  I'm opening Graeters both Fri. and Sat. this week, but I've come to the reailzation that the hat store is a very, very easy job.  The only hard part is standing for so long.  But I'll get used to it eventually.  Plus, my boss lady came out and just said that she didn't care if I studied just as long as I was there and nice to the customers.  Psshhh no problem!
Now then, some of y'all may not know, but I will be working everyday next week at Graeters.  Our other supervisor is out of town for about two weeks, which leaves me and Tanya (the manager).  So yeah, I'll be working Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  ugh.
Also, I start school on Wednesday, which means I get to register for classes on Monday.
Yuppers.
It's going to be an interesting year, I will say that much.
Oh yeah, my sister is looking for a roommate and a new place to live.  Outside of Wilmore.  Mom mentioned that she noticed a house (of all things) for rent off of some random street that I sorta' kinda' recognized the name of.  In any case, I'm not contemplating living with my sister.  Why?  Because if she doesn't find another roommate, then either way I'll be stuck living with her.  And it would be a lot easier if we were in OUR place, not our PARENTS place.  Anyhoo, I think I could live with her, as long as I got a lock for my door so that she couldn't steal my stuff.  Yup, it could work.  She and I have both matured since the last time we lived in the same building.
So that's basically all that's going on in my life right now.  And most of that happened within the past two days.  Hahaha.
Oooo oooo oooo, the Island, a good movie.  Y'all should see it.  ""Two Delta!""  Hehehehehe.  Hunter liked it too, so there you go.  You have TWO people who liked it.  :)  Unless he lied to me about liking it, which I sorta' doubt.  But then again...our whole relationship is built on a lie.  Apparently.  Least, that's what we've been told by other people.  Hehehehe.
Oh well, the good news is that we're a ""Fun couple"".  Sweet!
OH!  Random story time!
So, we went to see Unleashed Monday night.  Well, afterwards we mosied on over to the Steak N' Shake.  As soon as we walk in guess who I see looking at us?  Craig and Donnie.  Craig is the ""owner"" of Ronin Bushido, our Aikido club.  Donnie, is one of the main teachers.  great.
I don't remember telling Craig that Hunter and I were dating....well....now he knows!  Heh.  So we walk over and talk for a couple of minutes.  Then we went and hid in a booth that sorta' kept us from view.  Hahahaha!  *AWKWARD!*
The main reason I don't want Craig knowing what's going on in my personal life is that he took it upon himself a year and a half ago to meddle in it.  Without my permission or knowledge.  I'm not going into details.  Y'all don't need to know, but suffice it to say taht I would much rather he not know ANYTHING about me.  Heh.
Okay, pretty sure that's all now.  *glancing around room*  *sigh*  All that talking and my room didn't take the hint and clean itself.  GOSH!"

I have no money, yet I have two jobs.
I don't know what classes I will be taking this upcoming semester yet, and not sure how my parents will be able to pay the tuition (I have every intention of repaying them one day.  They just don't know it yet).
My car still shakes, and the gas prices are getting worse by the second.
I have now successfully angered two black women in my twenty years of existence.
The only time I'm not really tired is at 3 AM, and that's mainly because I've trained myself to be awake at that time.
My sister is going through a lot, and I mean a lot, of emotional drama.
My feet hurt from standing for 7 hours straight in heels.
Meg is the only friend who still comments, and Hunter is the only one I see.  (Katie is at camp, so I don't really blame her)
And countless other things are going on in my life.

But you know what?  I'm really, really happy.  I mean, I feel/am blessed.  And to think, just four monthes ago I would never have thought that this would happen to me so soon.  :)
Teehee

Okay, I'm literally falling asleep right now.  Time to put everything away.
yeah, you thought I was joking.  Apparently I can't come up with a coherent sentence whene tired. I just now woke up to this.

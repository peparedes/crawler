"event","So now prom will really really suck.  Good job Steph-date another socially retarded boy.  It always seems to work out so fucking well for you.  And how many cliches were used? Let's count them.  1)Its not you its me.  2) I still want to be friends and my favorite 3) dont worry I promise you will meet the boy of your dreams.  But the worst part by far is the gossip that his stupid friends are spreading.  Fucking grow up...don't you have better things to talk about in your life?

"event","Oh my goodness does prom suck big time.  OK well maybe not big time.  But at least medium-sized-time.  Now there are 24 pple in our group and our limo is $2000.  To add to the general maddness surrounding the whole dance thing, Ryan really really really wanted a Texas flag vest.  OK tacky I know, and I tried to tell him and he did the whole you knew who i was when you said yes to me blah blah you cant change me thing.  OK true.  But if I wore a clown suit to prom would he be ok with that?  Hell no.  Whatever, but secondly it would really really clash with my dress which is cream and purple.  Not a good combination with the whole red white and blue thing.  So his mother and I talk him out of it and I just know he is wanting to kill me and is really hurt that I wouldn't ""let"" him wear what he wanted.  But I tried to tell him that it wasn't that I didn't want him to be happy or even that I didn't like the whole flag idea just that it wouldn't match and that we would look really dumb.  He is still mad, and now he's gone for the rest of the weekend.  Then there's the drinking issue, and I am really mad about that.  The three buttface triplets are freaking out about us not wanting them to drink when we are around, telling Amanda that she is selfish and ruining the group.  Bullshit.  They are selfish for wanting to pull us down with them.  Stupid bitches.  And Ryan doesn't think Ashley is a slut?  Ok, I guess my definition of slut might be different...she takes her pants off for every guy she sees...usually while drunk.  And she's ""not sure"" if she's a virgin.  How can you not be sure?  Why do people change like that?"

"event","Well, everyone left on Friday, Ryan for Houston and the girls for Rockport.  OK so I have some time to kill for awhile till all of my friends get back in town.  Four straight days of dress shopping pretty much filled up that time.  But I finally got one and I love it.  If my mother and I agree on something, its gotta be good.  I have a couple talks with some people that had kinda faded out for awile.  The best one was with Andy.  He told me that even though we haven't talked in like forever and a day, he still loves me and thinks I'm one of his closest friends.  Nice to hear from anyone, but especially someone that meant so much to you.  He was really sweet about it.  Anyways, Ryan got back in town on Friday, but the others didn't get in till todayy.  So Friday we go to Dickies, his favorite restaurant ever.  Well except JC's.  Well the pants I'm wearing are totally cute, and I cant remember why I haven't worn them in awhile.  Well, once I sit down and notice that my zipper's undone I remember.  Its broken, so all night I'm like trying to keep them zipped, but it's just not working.  And I had on white lace underwear.  Not exactly like the kind that hides the shit that needs to be hiden when youre waling around in public with your pants undone.  It was interesting.  Then we go see the Hunted.  Ryan apparently missed the memo saying you don't take your girlfriend to see bloody movies.  Oh well.  Amanda hated it.  Rene loved it.  Gee.  Rene like knife fights?  Nah.  So now Ryan walks around acting out the ""six steps to killing someone with a knife"" scene.  Dork.  But it was cute, because he must have told me like eighty times how nice it was to be back.  Then he fell asleep on me.  He does this little breathing thing when hes sleeping that is so so so cute.  The next day, he decides to have a car washing party and throws a huge bucket of dirty soapy water in my face.  I'm still wondering how to get him back.  At the end of the night I'm not so gently reminded why I hate his friends, so I'm a little upset.  So he just stands there and hugs me for like ever and ever, and after awhile he goes ""of all the things we do together, just feeling you breathe is the best.""  Cute huh?  Yeah, I know.  Oh, and Andy, youll be so proud.  He didnt tuck in his shirt two days in a row!!!"

I have been the biggest bitch ever to my poor boyfriend this week, and he's still with me.  Guess that says something huh?  Poor guy.  But he won, and that was really nice.  Of course now he expects me to address him as Mr. Plano, but I don't think that will happen.  He was so cute when he was in the car with me.  He goes ""I used to think nice guys finished last in this kinda stuff, but this year has been so good to me.  I mean, I never would have thought that I would be on stage in front of people like this, and I couldn't have found someone better to share it with.  My life got so much better on November 26.""  How cute is he?  Yeah, I know.  Anyone have any V-Day suggestions?  He's really down to Earth, so if I spend a lot of money, he'll think I'm buying my way out of it.  SO I have to be cute and creative.  I'm not either one of those.  Sucks for me, I know."

But then I clicked on a link and it took over this page and my entry went bye bye.  So apparently that post wasn't meant to be.  So anyways....i just talked about rob's car, how Josh took away the last shread of dignity I had left by embarassing me in front of his parents (why are you so bitter still?), and how the movie The Next Best Thing made me thikn about the definition of family.  But now for the cute part Kate.  You'll like this one.  OK so for my one month with Ryan he decided that he would write down 31 reasons why he liked me...one for each day we'd been together.  Ok pretty cite huh?  Yeah i thought so too.  Here's a list of the good ones.  OMG he would kill me if he knew about this.  
1.  Your smile
3.  YOur hair...ok that one is a jok between Molly and I
4.  Your eyes...ok its trite but whatever
5.  My name is always safe with you...if you want an explaination jsut ask

Like I finish his sentences and I always seem to know what he's trying to say even if he doesn't.  Like the other night...actually last night he was looking at me while we were stopped at a red light.  Well first of all I can't stand it when guys look at me like that.  I know it's cute and everything, but I'm just afraid they're gonna find something wrong if they look that close.  So, not knowing how to react that, I asked him what and he goes ""Sometimes you do stuff and no matter what it is...like it could be the stupidest shit ever...I don't know it just reminds me of how cool you are.""  OK E for effort baby.  I gotcha.  Why does this seem like 10 times more real than anything else?"

I have all this other stuff happenign in my life, but when we're together it's just like all that melts away and everything is cool for an afternoon.""  I know I've heard that before, but I still thought that it was cute.  Or how about ""oh my gosh you passed the family test with flying colors.  I think you're my sister's new hero.  Oh and my mom thinks you are like the cutest thing since...well i don't know just the cutest thing.""  Aww.... Or how about ""look I know I can't say the right thing all the time or tell you how I feel but I jsut want you to know that I think nice stuff all the time.""  Ok thats my baby in a nutshell.

"event","Ok well yesterday was like official worst day ever.  It started off Ok with LIndsey's B-Day.  This meant that I got a a later curfew, which is always good.  And I was really looking forward to surprising her with the party.  Plus, I could spend time with Ryan, which is always a bonus.  Ok, so things looked good.  Well, then lunch rolled around and I did like the stupedist thing ever.  To make a long story short, my car is missing the left back corner.  Estimated cost to fix the piece of shit?  $3,616.  I can't afford that!!  And so now my insurance is going to go up, and as far as my mother is concerned I'm to live in a cage for the remainder of my life.  After crying for an hour, I went back to school, and had to explain why I looked like shit to everyone.  Ok, well I was fully expecting the oh gee it happens to everyone routine, but not from Ryan.  I had hoped that he might be slightly more comforting.  I know, I know, here I go expecting things from guys again.  My mistake...But anyways, according to the girls of the group, he cared he just didn't know what to do about it in front of all those people.  And while we were stuck in the truck durong rush hour traffic on the tollway, he was really sweet about it.  So we finally get out of the traffic, and then promptly get lost in Dallas.  I think I'm cursed to get lost every damn time I go down there.  So Ryan doesn't handle being lost very well, and was a little pissy there for a few minutes.  But we get to dinner, and Lindsay has to bring up how Rene hated me.  This puts Ryan in a bad place, becasue he wasn't supposed to tell Lindsay what Rene said.  This puts Rene in a hard place, because he hates his best friend's girl friend.  And it puts me in an interesting position for obvious reasons.  Well, being the wonderful person that he is, Ryan decides to look me in the eye and tell me that it's not true.  Not so smart on his part.  So on the way back home, I'm like why did you lie to me and he's like well I had to.  Bull shit.  If you have to lie in front of people, fine, but let me know that you're doing it, because I don't handle being lied to very well.  I'm not mad, he just used his free screw up card.  Ok so then we go take care of Soc, and the next thign I know the radio says its midnight, which means I'm really screwed--and I'll be home about 30 minutes too late.  My mother had called both my phone and his, and was wondering why I hadn't answered.  What was I supposed to say?  Umm I was busy Mom, and I wasn't really paying attention to my phone.  So when she get's home, I'm probably going to be in even more trouble.  Now I'll be living in a cage without food or water."

We weren't even really kissing, just chilling out on the floor.  I don't know why it bothered me but it did.  It's weird enough dating a boy who had the same friends as you do.  It seems like I just get a lot of crap about stuff.  Anyways tonight was fun.  I love Van Wilder.  That actor is so on the to do list.  Anybody know his name?  I think he ranks just below Ty from Trading Spaces.  And maybe behind Ben Afleck and Vin Diesel.  Anyways he's pretty hot.

Ryan and I just sat there laughing the whole time.  God he is so cute.  I told him he deserved a good girl who would bake him pies or something and he looks at me and goes ""why would I want good if I can have great?""  OK cheezy, but so cute.  I think this one actually means what he says.  He told me I was the cutest girl in the whole wide world.  Ok we'll just let him think that.  I swear one of these days he's gonna wake up and think what the hell am I doing with her?  He told me I was the only girl that he's ever stayed awake thinking about.  I just hope that I can keep fooling him into thinking I'm like the best thing since sliced bread for awhile.  I swear that smile is going to kill me one of these days!  For some odd reason, he makes me want to say cute things...which anyone who knows me will be shocked about.  I dont say nice things to boys.  'Cept this one..."

All that cam out were ""I just can't be that girl, that one who...just don't....don't.""  And he understood.  He just took my chin, and made me look at him, and I tried not to cry.  And he said, ""I promise, I won't.  You're special.""  And he kissed me.  God I hope he's telling the truth.  

I try to ask him why he thought that I was right, that the others were wrong.  And he looked at me with those eyes that just make me want stare for days, and he says ""I can't tell you in words.

God, please don't let him be another one in disguise.  Let him be the real thing, the one boy in a million that means what he says.  The one that you can think of at night, with out having to wipe the tears away.  The one whose name makes you smile for more that just the first week.  God, let him be the one whose kisses mean goodnight, not goodbye.  The one who wants to call everynight just to hear your voice.  The one who works for you, who thinks having you makes him the luckiest guy around.  The one who means it when he says he wants the love you see in the movies, and then looks at you and smiles that smile... the one that means he dreams of you at night.

1.  I had to wake up at 5 in order to get to school at 7
2.  I got to see people that I never thought I'd see again
3.  I had to freak dance in the middle of The Colony High School with a mormon boy...yeah don't ask
4.  Grant told me that his emotional attraciton to me was so strong that I was the reason he wakes up every morning.  Had he not been 100% joking (which I'm glad he was, because although dating him would be fun, he's kinda controversial and it would screw a lot of stuff up) it might have been the sweetest thing anyone had ever said to me.
5.  Ryan called me and asked me out to dinner the day after he asks some girl out.  Ok fine, I can eat dinner with him as friends.  But we talked for two hours about really serious stuff...not like the usual who won the football games that day.  He tells Lindz afterwards that he thinks it sucks that there are so many cool girls out there right now, and he kinda regrets having to choose just one.  Then he says that if Nicole and him break up, I would be really cool to date. I swear, I'm always like a day too late with that kinda stuff.
6.  I got to see Rob, which in and of itself had serious weird potential.  I tried so hard not to be mad at him for what he did, but you know he's broken three outta three promises now.  I can't beleive he could be that dumb.  But I still had fun with him as always, and to some extent that made it worse.  Especially with these circumstances.
7.  I almost stayed awake for 24 hours.  That would have been kinda cool...."

"event","I met the boy of my dreams tonight.  Ok, well I guess I've actually known him since seventh grade, but I kinda lost touch with him over hte five years I've known him.  So anyways, tonight I went out to get coffee with him after we volunteered together.  Well, first of all, he's cute.  Not like drop dead gorgeous cute.  But definately attractive: he's skinny but oh-so ripped. And he's got the bad boy image going on.  Which is why I assumed that he was kinda not a great person for me--I'm a self proclaimed goodie two shoes.  But he's the kind of boy I've always been looking for...the one's who look like bad boys but don't drink, don't smoke, and don't expect me to have sex with them.  We'll he's it.  All of his friends do the typical teenage stuff, but he says that he'd rather not put substancees like that in his body.  Definate plus there.  And he was saying how he believes in God and in heaven and hell, but isn't really a spiritual person.  Ok, well those are my sentiments exactly.  He's emotional, but doesn't feel the need to change his opinion of you every day; he has his ways, but he's not stuck in them.  He's easy to talk to--I found out so much about who he is in only 3 hours.  He's smart, but doesn't feel the need to throw that in my face all the time.  And he appreciates girls with brains.  He wants to be a politician, so do I.  And his political beliefs are the same as mine, which is weird considering that not many people share that with me.  Ok well, if you've come this far in my entry, you're probably thinking why isn't she with him.  Well, here's your answer.  The reason he felt compelled to spill all of this information to me tongiht was that he just broke up with his girlfriend of almost a year--11 months and a day.  As he put it ""I don't want your sympathy.  I just want my girlfriend back!""  He went on to tell me all the things he has done for her--the random flowers, the dinners he cooked, how he played in the rain with her, how he cried when they broke up.  He even wrote a thank you letter to her parents telling them how he's loved getting to know them ever this year.  He says that he can't stand just being friends with her, but that he knows somehow he has to stay a part of her life.  Is this not hte perfect man?  Nice, sincere, and genuine.  I think women should just clone him...wouldn't it be wonderful to be the magical girl who can get boys like that.  Guess I'm condmened to dating the moody, horny, dick head ones.  It was just really sad, because as he told me what he wants...or I guess had..in a girl he was saddest about the fact that he'd never find anohter one like that.  And I just wanted to scream at him...yes you will she's sitting right next ot you!! But I can't and I won't..and I shouldn't...his heart's broken, and I'm not very good at fixing things."

But he's so cute, and his friends are all soooo happy that someone who's not a racist hick likes him...which is also a little scary...but I don't want to have to pretend ot like steak and country music in order to be with him.  Basically, I don't want to settle, and I don't want him to either."

So I hung out with Ryan on Firday, and he didnt burn his face off this time so that's always a good thing. He is differnt than I expected after hearing all the crap from his friends...he's not like he is in class either.  But whatever.  So then tonight I went to see a movie with Kate and that was fun.  We chilled out and made our plans for UT.  Hopefully I won't get in to Rice and I can go there...I can't beleive  I just said that but after all the crap I've had to do lately the thought of working my ass off for another 4 years...it makes me wanna like hurl.  So anyways..I want to have the perfect ideal like get involved little college life and so does she so i think it will work out really well.  Cross my fingers.  Anyways, we saw Sum of all Fears, and the best part of the whole movie was when he's with his girlfriend in the morning and hes holding her and they show their feet. Ok if you haven't seen it that sounds really retarded but its cute i swear..."

Kinda werid...but theres food and Ryan so I dont see how that could be bad.  I dont know about him though...hes so closed minded and I dont know if I am going to be able to deal with that. But right aobut now..ok this sounds bad..but I'd be ok with a boy that isnt perfect for me...just to have some fun.  And hes a nice kid...it wouldnt be a waste of time.  The other Ryan is so wonderful, and if only I saw him more then life would be great.  Or better I guess.  So let's see what else...for those of you that dont have my screen name its sweetstephy1001...i have been meaning to post that for awhile now but I kept foprgetting.  I went shopping for shoes for homecoming tonight..five stores 45 minutes and no shoes.  They were all expensive so I nixed that.  I dont know what I'll do bc this weekend is gonna be a busy one.  I have my gov paper due..speaking of Aaron, you promised me sources...or at least some info on what you did.  What else..oh sara wont call me back and if the stupid junior ever wants to get a damn thing done she better pick up her phone.  Or I'm gonna do it without her.  I know shes alive....where is she.  I cant do everything for congress by myself.  I have to register to vote...geez thats such a scary thought.  Oh...Denton I dont know if you still like Man-Express, but one of my friends works there now if you want a discount.  Just a thought.  Ok im outta here...."

Grant asked me if  Iwas going to and I said that if could get the eral thing why would I need ot watch it.  I think he took me seriously for a second,c uz hte expression on his face was priceless.  Rob came into town to see me which was really nice.  We went to Pei Wei for dinner and then just talked for a long time.  It's nice to know we are still close enough to tell each other things.  I hope his life works out...I don't think he's eing honest with himself about how hurt he is, but I think that going through that shit will really help him in the long run.  He said something really sweet though.  I was talking about how I am always the i-cant-get-anyone-else-so-ill-settle-for-you girl in relationships, and he was like well if id had the balls to tell you everything in january, you wouldn't have been that girl.  I'm not sure whether or not I'm glad he didn't.  Whatever.  It was nice to see him.  I gave Christian a ride home on thursday and it was really good to talk to him again too.  He cracks me up.  On Friday, I was supposed to go to the game with Linds and Davis and Ryan (yum) but my mother wouldn't let me.  Typical.  I feel bad for her too.  Her boy had really  bad timing...right before homecoming? Bastard.  SO instead of the game I chilled with Kate and Martin which was fun.  I missed Martin..hadn't seen him in like a year or two.  Damn.  Anyways, it was fun.  Low key, but fun.  I needed a break from the horribly busy week."

"event","Hey guys! I know its been a little bit since I've posted.  Sorry.  Well its not like I have anything to say so I guess it doesn't matter.  Well, I'm in trouble again.  I was supposed to go shopping with Chris today for dress.  That didn't work.  First of all, my mom said it was gonna be a family day which basically means I'm never home and she is 'lonely' and doens't want me to have a life if she doesn't so I'm supposed to do things with her every so often.  Yeah.  SO we went to luch then my sister went out with some people so I decided to go out too.  Kate called me and since I hadn't seen her in awhile and I had blown her off last weekend bc I was sick, I figured I'd go see a movie with her.  We saw my big fat greek wedding or whatever its called.  It was anther love story about a girl who can't get a guy and then she becoems pretty by some miraculus make over and then falls in love.  I know they are supposed to be inspiring for those of us who are not blessed with beauty, but if she can only get guys AFTER she gets pretty I think it defeats the point.  Whatever.  Besides it makes me sad to be reminded that I don't have a guy.  I'm sure love is a wonderful thing, but I really wouldn't know.  Which is ok because I am only 17.  Well, almost 18, but you know.  I met the cutest guy at the football game last night.  He's in my gov class and I had always thought he was adorable, but he's funny and sweet too.  Will have to look into that one.  I guess its worth a try.  Besides he's not like the other guys I've dated...hes got the whole I'm a Texan and damn proud of it look.  The I could be a cowboy look.  But he's not quite a Wrangler kinda guy.  Does any one get what I'm trying to describe here?  In other words, hes not the punk I usually find attractive, but he doesnt wear really nasty tight jeans eihter.  And he seems a little bit..mellow-er than the last few.  Like I wouldn't have to worry aobut him being moody and randomly pissed off all the time.  That gets old.  What else did I do tonight?  Oh yeah I stopped by and saw Aaron since we were right next door at Old Navy.  We had to stop there to see Scott.  Anyways, it was nice to see him.  Kate thought he was like the hottest man alive.  But she had to go home to do homework---yeah don't ask.  So, we left.  And when I got home, I got in trouble for not calling home.  Once agian, I am grounded.  That is so god damn annoying.  They dont like me anyways so why is it such a big deal if I dont come home?  Beats me.  Oh well.   I'm gonna head out.  Night."

"event","Well, today was not too eventful.  I was kinda grounded from last night...that happens and awful lot.  My dad told me, and I quote, that I was ""goddamn stupid"" so I walked away.  I knew that was gonna piss him off, but he grounded me which I wasn't expecting.  I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna sit there and listen to somebody tell me I'm stupid.  Whatever.  So I went pc shopping today.  That was interesting.  My dad has a problem spending money if the thing he's gonna buy isn't for him.  So, obviously we didn't get anything.  I saw Aaron at Office Depot..I didn't know he worked at that one.  Anyways, he's just another person who doesn't like college, and that kinda scares me.  It doesn't seem like anyone does.  Except for Rob, who hasn't started classes yet.  He loves it because he's in a frat and he thinks that that will get him girls.  I hope that he doesn't change just to impress people.  I gotta say I'm a little worried about that.  But it was nice to see him today.  I have to admit that I really miss that kid.  He cracks me up.  Okay...I don't think anything of note happened today.  I babysat..oh la la...tons of fun...I mean it's cash, and I need that like you would not believe.  But you know, it was kinda a waste of a Saturday night, because, as my stupid curfew is 11 it's too late to go out...I don't care if no one else likes it, I'm looking forward to college..."

"event","Right now we are reading a bunch of Greek lit for English and the whole thing made me think.  The concept of fate vs freewill or whatever is kinda interesting.  It's kinda nice to think that there is some rhyme and reason to the whole scheme of things...but then agin its kinda a bummer to think that we have no control over ourselves.  Maybe there's something in the middle.  Like there is a plan set out for us...like certain things are meant to happen, and we're meant to meet certain people at certain times and stuff.  But it's the way we react to stuff that we have control over.  Because it always seems that things work out and whenever something goes really shitty it brings you to something better.  I know that's kinda optimistic, and maybe the only reason I think this is because as of right now my life is going pretty well.  And I'd like to think that it can stay that way.  But still, I mean this sounds like so cheesy, but maybe everything happens for a reason..."

"event","Ok, I offically hate teenage girls.  They betray my trust, spread stupid rumors, and are the biggest backstabbers in the world.  First of all, if you're going to repeat what I said to you (by the way I was trusting you...guess I won't do that again) at least get it right.  Don't make up stupid lies about me just to sabatoge a relationship which has been through enough crap as it is.  We're just barely on civil terms--what business is it of yours to mess with that?  Secondly, why the hell are you telling everyone that I stole your man?  I'm not even sure where this is coming from seeing as how I'm just friends with him. It's not my fault he likes me...But oh by the way, you need to have a man before someone can steal him.  Which brings me to my next point.  Why do you feel that you need a relationship to validate you?  You don't have to define yourslef as someone's girlfriend.  Why can't you just enjoy a relationship because it adds to you...not defines you...So basically, if you have a problem with me you can say it to my face bitch...its called decency...get some."

Ok, he didnt seem too comfortable around me and that is the worst feeling ever.  I never get embarassed around people, and for the most part I have the take me the way I am or leave me attitude.  But he had the I'm better than you thing or something..I don't know.  Just weird.  I just want a boy who makes me feel good about myself.  One that I can just be with..I don't want ot have ot get all dressed up or do my hair or put on makeup everytime we're together.  And I don't want to have to go out every night either.  In my experience it can be ten times more fun just to watch a movie and chill out together.  And I need a boy who is physically comfortable around me too.  The kind of guy who will kiss you just because at that moment he wanted to; you know the affectionate kinda guy.  As most of you have probbly figured out by now, I'm a touchy kind of person...I think that it just shows you care.  And you know what else would be great? A boy that can kiss..the last couple have been lacking in that department...some have booen a little too much (slobber bad) and some haven't been enough (ok you gotta actually DO something...).  Anyways, if anyone wants to find me a boy I'd be eternally grateful...it's lonely being by yourself..."

"event","So much has happened today that I don't think I can even begin to descrbie it.  But I'll try, because isn't that what this is for anyways?  Ok, well I've come to two epiphanies tonight.  I had an incredibly cleansing-doesn't that sound cheesy- convorsation tonight iwht Christine and Shivali.  I really don't think that our subject matter would be appropriate to post on this, but I can say that I just feel 100 times better knowing that people felt just the way I did.  I'm glad I'm not the only one that is easily swayed by other people's charisma.  Anyways, that brings me to my first point.  I have recently noticed that I have a big mouth and that I need to start respecting other people's thoughts and feelings.  People confide in me and I need to understand that violating that trust is a major no-no.  I can't believe how hypcritical I have been expecting others to not tell my feelings when I repeat theirs.  Ok, now to my second point.  I am convinced that marrying your best friend is the only way to make a marriage work.  Maybe I'm a little jaded for a girl of 17 but it seems to me that humans are just too flighty to fall in love and stay there.  I'm talking about the passionate love--you know that Hollywood kind of thing.  I truely believe that passion fades, but the love you have for your friends can last forever.  Don't get me wrong, affection is incredible, but you can have affection from your best friend.  I am a touchy person, but I am more physically comfortable around someone that I'm not attracted to.  And isn't the point of marriage to be comfortable with them in every situation?  I know that all those hopeless romantics out there are gonna totally disagree, and maybe if I ever fall in love, I will to.  But I just seem to think that friendship is more likely to withstand the test of time better than that passionate love--that flame that eventually flickers out.  I guess this comes from having a guy as one of my closest friends.  (That would be you Rob.)  So anyways, those are my two new discoveries.  Oh and by the way, today was my first day of school.  Wasn't bad I guess.  Oh yeah--Happy B Day Shivali!"

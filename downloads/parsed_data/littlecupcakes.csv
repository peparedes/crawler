Cheesecake with strawberries, asparagus wrapped in salmon, ham, potatoes, and too many glasses of wine. I was tired all night but now I can't get to sleep. My christmas has been wonderful except for the fact that my dog has terrible gas and is sleeping inches from me at the moment."

I got a huge bugbite on my nose. I made cupcakes. I tried to get my hair cut but all the walk in places were booked so maybe I can go on a weekday. I also got to meet the new dog I will be pet sitting next week. It weighs 3lbs and has mini everything, needless to say I am in love with it completely. I am thinking of sewing a new shirt tonight. I got some great yellow fabric and I don't want to mess it up because I am a little tired. I have been obsessed with yellow lately. I am also thinking pretty seriously about using some of my first paycheck to get a tattoo. I have wanted another one for some long. I got my first one seven years ago! I already drew out a design and I'm getting excited."

It was an interesting little shop with a loom and bags of wool everywhere. I'm going to take a few lessons and hopefully be a better spinner. She also shows how to do everything with the wool so there is no need to buy roving. I sewed and painted a bit today and started to work on some things for school. I really want to start taking more photos especially of people. I never take pictures of people and I have none. This weekend I am taking everyones picture so beware and wear something pretty. :]<br /><br />oh yeah this is a pink top I bought at the goodwill last week. I took it in a bit and added the white buttons for style. haha</p>"

Not too much has been happening. I became a volunteer at an animal shelter and get to hang out with dogs on Sunday which I'm pretty excited about. I haven't heard back from my job interview which is sad. I really wanted that job and not just for the much needed paycheck. Hope everyone is having a lovely 06-06-06 day.</p>"

"event","Today I unpacked all of my stuff from boxes and seperated into piles that slowly became divided into slightly smaller piles until I was surrounded by mini piles. It is an endless chore. I have been enjoying it a little because I really want to downsize all my belongings and own far less than I do right now. My new room is much larger than I am used to and the clost is endless. I got bored with unpacking today and made a lovely new cover for my heating pad out of cherry fabric. I also cut out some patterns in order to make some new clothes. I sewed for a little while I listened to old cds I found. I called the YMCA and it turns out that I can get a 4 month membership for only $50 which is awesome. All I need now is $50. 

ok so I have no idea where my camera is or my deordorant for that matter so I will post old photos

"event","I must say that the magic eraser is really magic. I can't believe what it can do. I would recommend it to anyone who is as messy as I am. I spilled ink everywhere today and magic eraser took care of it. I spent tonight painting and a little sewing. I finished a bunch of pins that just need a coat of sealer and they will be done. I also worked on a few more mini wood block paintings. My favorite in this bunch is the mixer.

I just ordered a pair of velcro shoes. Someday soon watermelon will be in season and I will be one happy girl. I guess that is all I have to say. I don't have a life all I do is sew and paint and go for walks. 

the pouch box is filling up

"event","Let me see...what is new with me. I have been lacking in the sleep department this week. I started to pack things in my room to kick off the super fantastic moving home activity. I have slowly but surely been making things for the show. I have been painting, learning about glues, gluing my fingers together, etc,etc. Today I purchased the wonderful E6000 industrial glue which is super cool. Very powerful stuff. My giant fluorescent light burned out in my bedroom. Since I have 12 ft ceilings I can not reach it at all. Its been driving my crazy. I only own one teeny tiny lamp to keep me from darkness and I hate the living room. I hope they come fix it tomorrow. 

What else. I wish I knew more people in this area. I have been bored lately. All I ever get invited to do is drink. eh. Why don't I ever meet people who enjoy board games and felt?

"event","I had all day to do whatever because instead of going to class I went to lunch at taco bell. opps. I have been obcessed with getting chicken gorditas which really aren't that bad for you if you just get with lettuce and salsa. yummy. I have been there at least 3 times this week. I spent today making crafts and listening to french music. I have no idea what they are saying but I really love to listen to french female singers. I have so many things I still want to make for the show. I am going to spend tomorrow painting instead of sewing. 

Tonight JAmes and I are going to go see V for Vendetta. I hope it is good. Here is a photo a set of pouches I started today because who doesn't want to store stuff in their undies.

The container is so cool. 

The only news I really have to share is that my hands are so sore. I have always been a nail biter. Which even I think is gross but have never been able to stop excpet for a month or so in 6th grade. Lately though it has been out of hand. I do it without thinking and whenever I am nervous. I guess its been a nerve wrecking week cause my nails are awful. I really need to find a way to stop this now. I have considered in the past getting those arcylic nails to break me of the habit cause I'm pretty sure I won't be able to bit through those. I really need to do something so maybe after my hands look a little better I will go to nail world place. Maybe I'll get the rhinestone ones or some airbrushing. hm

Also I have been listening to this nonstop http://www.last.fm/user/megank19/"

"event","It's all so ironic the things that you think 
You preface them all with a nod and a wink 
The clothes that you wear and the words that you speak 
You're so fucking clever, you're tongues in your cheek 
You stand on the sidelines and shit on it all 
never getting involved 'cause you might take the fall 
Your apathy hides the fact that you're scared 
of expressing opinions or showing you care 
The irony is that you totally suck 
You can look down on me and I don't give a fuck 
'Cause I hate assholes who hide behind fashion 
Who live life devoid of emotion or passion 
All style and no substance, you're flesh without bone 
Another footsoldier in an army of clones 
So fuck your snide ways and your snotty asides 
I fucking hate you and all of your kind 
You I hate you


friends only."

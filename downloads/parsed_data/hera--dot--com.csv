2/4: <b>What does the word 'love' mean to you?</b>

The Queen of the Gods looked at her perfect manicure, and smoothed her impeccable coiffure as she considered the question.

""Love,"" she said comfortably, ""for the most part, is frivolous, capricious, fickle, and shallow.  Though poets and musicians have built love up to be the be-all, end-all of human existence, if one makes note of the figures in history who have achieved the most, love played hardly any role at all.  Love will not earn you position; love will not feed your children; and love will certainly not allow you to survive.

""And love has no interest in these things.  Love's only interest is in love itself, and this is reflected in all its forms.  It wants to self-perpetuate, to have its way, to change the world to its tune.

""Unfortunately, darling, the world rarely shares love's interests, and it would behoove anyone who would like to survive and thrive in it to know that. 

""What does the word 'love' mean to me?  I suppose if I had to narrow it down to one word, I would have to say, 'Impracticality.'""

2/11: <b> Have you ever regretted a wish you made? Why/what happened?</b>

Hera looked thoughtful.

""I certainly have never regretted any wish I've made; it is my fortunate circumstance to have been born a goddess, and thereby my wishes are first most often followed, and second, do not have the repercussions of those of mortals.  

Of course, there are desires I've regretted having, but technically, that's another question.""

2/18: <b>Write a ficlette based on the word: <i>beautiful</i>.</b>

(OOC Note: Ok, I did this wrong, but Hera started talking, and I couldn't stop her!)

""Beautiful."" Hera smiled a cold smile.

""Beautiful is a versatile word, with many meanings.  The graceful slope of the finest leather, crafted by a master to fit my divine foot is beautiful.  The sharp cuts and smooth lines of custom-designed gown, of good color and superb fabric is beautiful.  

""Peacocks are beautiful, shining bright, preening, looking deceptively common until they show their feathers, revealing the wonder of what they can be.

""Marriage is similarly beautiful.  Far be it from me to pretend sentimentality or romanticism, but there is little in this world more productive, more useful, or more beautiful than the union between two people, committed to sharing a life, to sharing experiences, and to sharing family.  Marriage is an integral element of the life cycle, though it be ignored, abused, and maligned.  The fact is, it continues to exist, despite the abuse it endures, and battles are fought politically and socially to establish rights to it.  Why?  

""Because marriage is a commitment to partnership, security, and strength.  It is an agreement that two people are better together than they are apart, that you will take care of each other, protect each other, and bury each other.  The world that was created for gods and mortals alike is a harsh one; for most, the path is more difficult without help.  It is mundane.  It lacks the excitement of having a new lover every week.  But novelty fades, and so does the excitement of constantly seeking out new company.  The beauty of marriage is in the details; and even in my own, as flawed as it may be, there is beauty in the knowledge of each other, in being so familiar with another's body, mind, and soul that it might as well be your own.""

<b>What would a description of your *exact opposite* be like?</b>

""My exact opposite, darling?  Oh my.

""Well, clearly, whatever it was, it would have abysmal fashion sense.  Tasteless, over-friendly, mewling and flabby of form, mind, and spirit.

""I am nothing if not well-honed.

""Such a creature could hardly be divine, otherwise I might name a few of my associates who might fit the bill..."" 

She smirked.

""Of course, the creature would be feckless, guileless, and rather stupid, with taste in beverages as poor as its taste in shoes. It would clearly have to be ugly, as well.

""And of course, shamelessly immodest.""

The Queen of the Gods smirked almost playfully.

<lj-cut text=""Childhood Memories... Oh darling..."">

<b>Describe your funniest childhood memory.</b>

Hera looked rather nonplussed by the question.

""My funniest childhood memory?  Well, obviously, since I spent the entirety of my childhood in my father's stomach, barrel-laughs were few and far between. 

""I suppose that the most amusing point in my youth, if not my childhood, was when Zeus cut us all out of my father's gut, and watching the blood and innards pour out of the bastard. It was then that I knew I loved him.  Even if afterward he married me against my will.  Those first few years were a bit of a struggle.""

She smiled fondly.

""Ah, those were the days.""

<b>What's the furthest away you've ever been from the place you were born/created? How did you get there? Why did you go? Did you return or even want to come back to where you came from?</b>

""Hmm... well, I suppose the furthest away I've been from Olympus has been Australia, for their fashion week.  Manolo begged and begged, and had made several choice offerings at my altar, so how could I refuse him?  On top of it, there were so many homosexuals speaking English with that adorable accent, prepared to worship at my feet... how could I say no?  But of course I returned, and wanted to.  Though the fashions were interesting, none of these upstart continents could hope to compare to Europe.  Besides, no matter where I go, nowhere can hold a candle to Greece for climate or beauty, really.""

</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Happiness."">
<b>Describe what your ""happily ever after"" would be like.</b>

""My happily ever after?"" Hera smiled humorlessly.

""There are many advantages to being me, I can assure you.  I have no trouble acquiring the best shoes, the best drinks, the best places, and the best minions.

""However, happily ever after is a fictitious notion invented by the Western Europeans to fool themselves into thinking that they can surpass their lots in life.  No one gets to be happy for more than a brief moment in time - anyone who fools themselves into thinking otherwise is clearly delusional, or has enjoyed one valium too many, because he or she is dreaming.""

"event","<b>Is there any truth to the saying: keep your friends close, and your enemies closer? Do you have enemies? Do you have more friends than enemies?</b>

Hera appeared in the foyer of her temple, gracefully adjusting an arrangement of lilies in a shapely vase. 

""Well, darling,"" she began, not looking up from her work, ""what you're asking is a question of strategy.  Keeping enemies close is implicit that you should have to tolerate attacks upon your person, or dangers to yourself for any extended period of time."" 

She paused for a moment, walking gracefully to another vase, working on another arrangement, changing the colors of the petals with a touch of her fingertips.

""The fact is, in certain situations, one is forced to... endure the company of those they might not prefer.  But enmity,"" she said slyly, ""is such a strong word for those you might hold so close to you, don't you think?""

""After all,"" she said, admiring her work and conjuring a martini, ""It's important to keep things civilized whenever possible.  However,"" she took a sip of her drink,

""Should someone close to you act against you, you are in the enviable position, if prepared, to have the best knowledge possible how to... subdue them, don't you think?""

Her smile was positively shark-like.

""As for whether I have enemies... well,"" she sighed, ""the passions of the Old Days have mostly faded away - those who I once hated now seem but fuzzy annoyances on the edges of my consciousness.  Friends, on the other hand, are a luxury that few women in my position enjoy.  There is, of course, Dionysus, who I've come to know well over the years,"" her lips quirked into a smile. ""But truly, my 'friends' are few and far between."" 

""However,"" she smirked, ""I sometimes get the feeling that I am, perhaps, not quite so well-liked as certain people pretend.  But that's nonsense, don't you think?  After all, who wouldn't love their Queen?""

With an ironic chuckle, Hera finished her cocktail and sashayed out of sight.

""Ah, my weapon of choice."" The goddess ran slender fingers along the petals of a delicate lotus in her courtyard.

""Spite, of course."" A Tom Collins appeared in her hand, of which she took a sip before continuing.

""The methods are incidental - whether a rather... prolonged time in labor, giving gadflies to livestock, or,"" a nostalgic chuckle escaped her slender throat, ""throwing obstacles in the way of someone trying to complete his labors...""

A smile lit her face as she reminisced, though she sobered slightly.

""Understand, I'm not as much as an ogress as they make me out to be.""

She thought for a moment.

""Well, perhaps I am. But really, darlings, what's a woman to do when she's the personification of womanhood in a culture where love for a woman is considered laughable? I mean, honestly, there's only so much a goddess can take before something has to be done, don't you think?""

She smirked.

""Of course you do. In any case, spite has served me well over the years, both as a defense against those who have wronged me, and a reminder of who's in charge.""

"event","Hera was situated on a bench in her garden, legs crossed, watching her peacocks. She looked at her perfectly manicured fingernails before conjuring a dirty martini (two olives), then answering slowly, perhaps even thoughtfully.

""Darling, happiness is at best a pleasant delusion. It doesn't last, it doesn't accomplish anything, and it certainly isn't of much <i>use</i>.""

The Queen rose from the stone seat, and strolled through the stunning verdure. 

""Now fame has its uses... especially for a goddess. Fame often means worship, acknowledgment, perhaps fear. Those are all very heady things, and it's easy to tie your power up in them. Just thrive on all that emotion and passion and devotion. But of course,"" she paused, taking a sip of her drink, ""depending on fame is folly. Fame is also transient, and what do you do when your temples have crumbled, and your worshipers have all moved on to the newest deity of the millennium?""

Hera shook her head, and smiled down at a peacock.

""And money... well, money can't possibly count for the divine. Although,"" she noted, ""we can, and do, possess wealth. And wealth, be it in physical possessions, belief, or the importance and prominence of that over which you rule, is always, <i>always</i> linked to power.""

With that, she smiled quite coldly.

""Power, really, is the only thing worth having. Power protects, power enforces, power ensures that your will is done, and that you will always have the things that you want. Power isn't everything, of course,"" she conceded, ""but when all else fails, it certainly serves as a more than sufficient substitute.""

Sigh.

My darling children fighting, the Furies flitting about, and Priapus in town. 

Wonderful.

In order to alleviate some of the stress of my diligent nurturing, I decided to pay a visit to that lovely shoe man, <a href=""http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/catalog/catB7.jhtml?itemId=cat000209&parentId=cat000199&masterId=cat000149&navCount=21&navAction=jump"">Manolo Blahnik</a>. 

Manolo is a silly man, though far more cultured and educated than your average designer.  He recognized a woman of import when he saw one, and the design that he came up with for me was simply darling.  He put the order through on rush, of course, and said that I should have it by the end of the week.

I do so hate waiting.

And yet I must accept the limitations of these poor mortal creatures, and so long as Manolo keeps churning out these marvelous designs, he shall be forgiven.

But not a moment longer than that, I assure you.

In any case, the time has come to see the last child of mine whose temple I've yet to grace with my presence - dear <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~vulcan_dot_com"">Hephaestus</a>.

Of course, I do love my darling boy, the only fruit of my loins produced without benefit of <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~zeus_dot_com"">the Philanderer</a>, though he is a bit dull.  The poor boy was unfortunately un-graced by my beauty - though he is such a dedicated little worker.

:sigh: Why did Gaia curse me with a perpetual teenager, an ill-tempered hooligan, and a homely stick-in-the-mud as my only offspring?  Well, Eileithyia is all right, I suppose, but she's always too busy between work and attending the Fates to spend any time with the woman who gave her <i>life</i>.

:re-sigh: So ungrateful.

There are others, of course - I am the Goddess of Marriage.  But let's not even get into Typhon or the Charities.  In this day and age, there's likely to be a maternity suit on my hands if I'm not careful.

But again, no matter.  I shall go see my darling boy, and hopefully I won't fall asleep while I'm there."

"event","Well, today was just precious, really.  I spent the morning at Barney's, which was quite an endeavor, I assure you.  As of course we all know, usually I won't bother with anything <i>pret a porter</i>, however, I was a little bored, and needed time to mull over all the drama between my children.  

First of all, the service was appalling.  Of course, it's been a while since I'd been in a department store of any kind, but it was simply -dreadful-, darlings.  The clerk was a sycophantic little pederast - he reminded me of Ganymede.  Hopping to and fro like some sort of overanxious rodent, he kept showing me Donna Karan.

As though I would ever, ever wear Donna Karan, let alone off the rack.  

I half expected the nimrod to bring out a t-shirt with ""DKNY"" emblazoned on it. 

After bringing him to tears a few times, and him blubbering something about a nervous breakdown, they sent me another little homphile, this one far sassier.  He lasted a bit longer - at least an hour - before he resigned.  

Tsk.  No longevity.

Then, finally, they sent me a Queen I could deal with.  He was impeccable.  He was accomodating.  He was brilliant, and his fashion sense was unquestionable.  He had the good sense not to look at me in awe, although he would have if he hadn't had some sense of decorum.  In the end, I made a few small purchases to assist his commission, which I then recommended he incorporate into his stage show.  What use did I have for them, anyway?  In the end, I think I threw my cocktail in his face and I may have burned his Gucci shirt with my cigarette - though I can't be sure.

:shrug: Ah, well, c'est la vie, isn't it?

In any case, it's good to be back at my temple.  Mortals have no idea how to mix a proper martini - and what passes for an olive down in the New World would make my stepdaughter ill, I'm sure.

I'll have to make a note to send her a jar."

To do this you should present an aspect of your work or a specific project im which u have spent considerable time, effort and thought.  ""  so yea, 12 projects on one idea that i will make in school, but i need the idea, lol , and mr schwabb , my art teacher, suggested that i find a scifi book and illustrate it , which i think is a good idea, but i dont read books too often in the summer, ill start reading the one sara gave to me to read again, cuz i stopped reading it , oh and gabes bday, oh my ,always there is a problem, so i get up this morning and thers a paper that says ""Gabriel"" and a box underneath it, so i read the paper cuz i know gabe wouldnt care and i was curious, and it said stupid crappy shit like ""if u put effort into your goals u will be sure to achieve them ...balh blah, love dad"" and it was printed off the computer, and i opened the box and there was this gold chain , and it looked familiar, and i rememberd seeing my dad wearing it before , and i was like , u idiot dad, he doesnt want this crap, so gabe comes home and hes pissed and yelling at my dad on the phone cuz my dad wasnt at the house and my dad tells him to get out of the house and its a long yelling/phone hanging up/ loud/ stupid idiots  for a while , and then gabes crying (shhh dont tell anyone he will get angry)  and heres a big reason why ::: the necklace turned out to be the neklace that my mom had given my dad when they had gotten back togehter and we moved to san jose , so wtf was my dad thinking? so yea , idiots they are, and gabe hauked a huge lugy on the wall, its gross, im gunna act like ive neverseen it tho so i dont have to clean it up. its soooooo grosssss

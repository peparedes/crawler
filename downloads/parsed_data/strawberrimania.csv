for the last two days my ""father"" and i have been fighting...
and i'm sick of it...
i'm literally sick...
probably from all the crying...
i just want to get away from all this...
my family is getting on my nerves...
the only thing worth living for is JOE...
but anywayz...

i got my new camera for class...
it cost me over $200,
but it's worth it...
it's an awesome camera...

well, i guess that's it...
i need to go read for english...
(the most boring, long, smallest printed book ever...)
so... yea...
until next time..."

"event","Wow, it's been absolutely yonks since I last posted.  Chalk it up to Facebook.  So anyway, the year in review:

-First 3 months - finished teaching the little wet ones.  Cute, but after toilet training 20 children, I am so done.

-4-7th month (first term) - Solidified my reputation as a miracle worker.  The dance unit didn't know what hit them when I whipped them into shape.  Boss is now frothing at the mouth to put a competitive dance team out there and see what happens.  Who they gonna call...

-August - went home, lots of lunch dates out, lovely, yes.

-Sep-Dec - Very tired, Halloween was good, Christmas concert rocked out, guess what I did there?  Dancers in glow-in-the-dark skeleton suits worn backwards, dancers facing the back wall, having to do gymnastic flips and the like with the lights off (with blacklights tho) and the occasional strobe light.  Frankly, the rest of it sucked in comparison.  Christmas dinner, roast lamb by moi, with friends.  New Years will be the Brazilian Samba Contest (!) I hope.  It would be fun to shimmy on in and take the trophy off their hands.  Just my luck, there probably wont be a contest, but at least the guy I met last week will be there.  Why is it that Japanese men are scared of me?  Perhaps they read the memo I sent out.

-2008 - Term one will be developing dance music, to which I will then choreograph a mildly interesting routine.  NAH, kidding!  If I could come up with a dance which brought the crowd to their feet in about 2 hours while watching tv, imagine what I could do if I actually tried.  I will then apply to any midway-decent musician to come up with remixes of the techno persuasion.  Am thinking of releasing the music with a karaoke version (of course!  This IS Japan, after all) and a music video.


Oh, and I did the level 2 Japanese test.  Good old 2kyuu.  Hoping for a good result in February!  It wasn't so bad.  Quite reasonable, really.  Especially the listening section, which I could have napped through."

"event","Well, I've been busy.  Went on a company-paid spa trip which included shopping at the Gotemba Outlet Community or whatever it was called, then I came home and wrote reports, and before all that we had the school Tanabata Festival and yes, the kids rocked.

By which I mean that for the last month I've been teaching Japanese festival dance, called Yosakoi, to the kids to gear up for the festival.  I even spent all of Golden Week sewing the costumes.  

They were good.  I heard that a few of the parents were so happy they were crying.  Given that it was only a week ago, I have spent the entire week receiving kudos far and wide.  Now that I've finished my reports, I am very relaxed.

Took the kiddies ice skating today.  It was actually a really good place and the staff there went out of their way to teach the beginners how to move about, and by the end of the class the phrase ZOOM, ZOOM, ZOOM came to mind.

Until one of the first graders fell and smacked her head, was sent to hospital where she was throwing up.  What do you think, should a 6 year old with concussion have been sent home within a few hours of the injury?

I think not.

Monday is a holiday here.  Then 4 more days of school, the last day of which will be spent cleaning, playing cricket, and swimming.  Unless this typhoon keeps the weather bad, in which case I guess we will be playing games, painting perhaps, and such.

On with the dance!  Let joy be unconfined..."

"event","Allow me to introduce you to the world's greatest classroom pet:  Conifer!  Conifer is a long-haired white persian cat.  Meowsies!

Oh yes.  Conifer is also a toy with sensors in various places which, when activated, prompt different movements and sounds.  Purring and whatnot.  Plus after a lengthy name-choosing process with the children, other options being Kitty (ie 'Hello Kitty!'), Snowbell, and Zazu, Conifer was chosen as to its spiky and likeable nature.

So what the HELL is going on??  For the second day in a row, someone has made off with Conifer and hidden him somewhere.  It disappeared after I went home on Wednesday night, and I found it outside the toilets on a sink.  Kind of gross, yes?  Anyway, my class went on a picnic today, and it was there when we left at lunchtime.  After school we had a staff meeting, and when I went to the meeting, Conifer had gone again!  Given that there were no classes upstairs (where my classroom is) on Wednesday night, I thought it was one of the downstairs classes (the after-school ones, not the kindy kids).  But now its disappeared again, while a different group of kids were in the school. 


So who do you think did it?"

I booked my tickets home for the holidays.  Initially I was only going to have 4 weeks off, and then having to sit around at work for the last week of August even though there's no point.  But my boss seems to now have the point of view that since it is well-nigh impossible for the elementary teachers to take a day off, we can use our discretionary days to extend our holiday by a week.

SO.  I used my new JAL credit card (yippee!  mileage for shopping!) and booked the following:

Nagoya-Narita 1:55-3:00pm, Monday 23 July
Narita-Brisbane  9:30pm-7:05am Tuesday 24 July (NOTE parents, 24th!)

Brisbane-Narita 8:50am-4:45pm, Friday 31 August
Narita-Nagoya 6:30-7:45pm

Then 2 days until term 2 starts.  If I could just manage to get the parents to stop complaining about everything by then, that would be SWEET."

"event","Ahem, term begins again on Monday, so finally bit the planning bullet and did most of the gruntwork to get ready for the new year.  Spent a good portion of the school's money today on such frivolous items such as pencils, markers, and a jigsaw puzzle.

Great word, frivolous.  Also extraneous is a good word.  Likewise philanthropic.  When I was at uni I used to amuse myself during lectures (no, no point in actually listening to the lecturer) by keeping a list of quaint phrases that are more intellectual than the norm.  I always tried to include the word 'didactic', or even 'didacticism' for good measure.  How's this for fun: didactic antagonism.  Use it in a sentence, I dare you.  Comment with other delightful nuggets of wisdom, if you please.

So the concert last Saturday was beaut.  I took Sue (you've met her, mum) and it was the first night out without Noah since he was born 1+1/4 years ago.  We celebrated with meat pies afterward.  

The concert was humbly titled THE JAPAN DEBUT OF THE GENIUS CHASLIN, first name Frederic.  He really was good.  He was playing piano one-handed while looking at the orchestra and conducting with his spare hand.  Fun, yes.  And Puppy Dude over in the brass section did a good job too (I found his dog, remember?).  Here is what they played:

Claude Debussey - Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune
Maurice Ravel - Piano Concerto in G major (Allagramente, adagio assai, presto)
Hector Berlioz - Symphonie Fantastique - Episode de la vie d'un artiste, opus 14 (Reveries, un bal, scene aux champs, marche au supplice, songe d'une nuit du sabbat)

During intermission Chaslin came back out and played 'the death of love' (I'm working from the Japanese title here, ai no shin) from Tristan und Isolde.  All of these lovely things took about 2 hours, then 10 minutes of clapping.

Twas a good night.  Have spent the time since then cat-sitting, which HOPEFULLY will finish really soon as Whimsies is working my last nerve with constant whining.  Awww does Whimsie woo need cuddle?"

So.  No books for the kids yet, they haven't arrived.  Goody.  No supplies either, although I suppose I can remedy that by throwing money at the problem (let's give it up for well-heeled private schools!).

A new student joined my class last night, bringing me up to SEVEN.  Here's hoping I can survive the strain.

-- Hello Kitty. (= cute, can't talk)

"event","Ahem.  So I've been teaching Nakagawa-san for a couple of months, and we tend to look at websites.  So, last Friday we put in a joint order to The Meat Guy (guess what he sells?), thus paying half the delivery cost each, and it ARRIVED TODAY!

Oh happy, happy day!  I ordered half a freezer-ful of meat pies and sausages.  And so now, in my tradition of eating something whilst typing, I bring you...


... ONLINE MEAT PIE.

Haven't eaten a meat pie in -ages-.  So I've got a beef pie with mashed potato and tomato sauce.  Have just cut a mouthful.  Here we go...

BRILLIANT!!  My eyes closed as I ate it.  This is so marvellous I can't think of the last time something tasted this good.  Actually, it was shabu shabu at Mitsuyo's.  When did I last feel this good?  Bon Jovi concert.  Excuse me whilst I imbibe further.  Is it possible to get meat pie IVs?  Or at least, a meat pie-dispensing hat.


Oh and in work news, my boss is away for a couple of days so shall be talking to him about stuff on Thursday.  Thank you mummy for the lovely encouraging email today :) (hugs for you!)

La La!  Must eat before it gets cold."

I can't wait - first pay in 2 months.  I tried to create a poll that would have several options of how to celebrate said event, but the truth is, my pay is going towards:

a) paying 2 months of phone, cable, internet, etc.  Particularly phone.  Hi mum!
b) Japanese lessons have to be paid for.  Yay!  On Thursday we were talking Nagoya slang (dorrre!  roll the r) and so on.
c) going to the doctor (finally!) about my back.
d) buying meat from The Meat Guy.  If I could get off work before 5pm, I would traipse on over to the main store and save the delivery costs.  But hey, Mayumi and I put in a joint order, so we each pay half the delivery costs and she can take the delivery at her salon (the one next door to me :) and I pick up my share on the way home.  Hooray!  Meat pies and sausages for ME on Tuesday!!  Am looking forward to it, yes.  Considering that Tuesday is when I will be talking to my boss about recontracting, so I imagine that I will have some interesting news to relate on Tuesday."

For those who don't know, one of the worst-effected regions is where I used to live.  No worries, my friends are fine.  Talked to Hitomi in particular, she and her mum are fine, just scared about that train derailing and things like that.

Oh, and if anyone has been trying to call me, my phone has been broken for at least a week.  Sorry.  Email me or leave a comment and I'll get back to you.

Seems rather superfluous given the bad news, but my birthday present to myself arrived yesterday.  The Asuka and Rei interface hair clips.  They look awesome.

But anyway.  Sorry Sasebo.  Sasebo is near Nagasaki.  Some of the best times of my life happened in Sasebo.  Nagasaki too.  Considering all the bad stuff that happened there, the people are some of the most friendly and welcoming in the country.  Some really good people down there."

I am now looking at second-hand scooters.  I can get a nice, 2yr old Suzuki for 50,000 yen.  I might shop around, but this is at the shop right near my house so if there was a mechanical fault then I could go back in a convenient huff.

"event","So I was just watching 'Nyanko:  The Movie'.  Nyanko is a baby word for 'cat', translating more like, 'kitty!'  An hour of watching cats do cat-like things.

My favourite by far was Champon, a cat whose only activity is to lounge on the windowsill outside a Chinese restaurant in Yokohama.  Works like a charm, people lean over to play with the cat and suddenly decide to eat there.  People que up to take photos of the cat and decide that they might as well eat there.  It's a good system.

You know, I've tried to convince people at work that we need to have an AIS kitten running around the place.  The Orca class has a pet turtle, the Elementary kids have a guinea pig or some disgusting rodent, I WANT A CAT!  A cat that I can use as a neck-warmer in winter.  With a cat, one never needs toys to entertain the children.  And if the kids get rough, which happens so, so often, the kids will get a real-life lesson in that the cat will scratch them up.  A brilliant notion, no?

So what shall I call this cat?  Suggestions, please.  I am leaning towards:

- Hello
- Captain
- Bunny
- Rat
- Pookie"

"event","OK, this is my chance to rant.  Let me have a few opening remarks before rolling up my sleeves and commencing with the slaughter.

- I have a degree in teaching both English and Japanese and know precisely what I am talking about.
- I have worked all kinds of English classes, except for the upper highschool ones.
- I have connections everywhere.
- Oh, and have I mentioned that I have people queing up to get into my classes?  I wonder why.

SO.  I don't like stupid foreigners who come to Japan and act like the Japanese people, government, and culture owe them anything.  The above description is applied most often to JETs.  'Hey, did you see that pack of gaijin walking around, criticising loudly as if they owned the place?'  'Yep, they're the new JETs'.  'ooh.  Poor kids.'  Can you believe that JETs get more money than the rest of us, paid by taxpayers, and they can't even respect the country they are in?  Either find something you like, OR GO HOME!

You see, there are a few options for those who want to learn English.  For teenagers, they have weekly classes with the JETs, whose sole redeeming feature is that they are easy to push around.  Children, plus everybody else, can take after-school English classes from an assortment of companies and international schools.  Imagine a bag of liquorice allsorts.  Got it in your mind?  Well, I am the pink one.  My students can, funnily enough, *speak English*, which is more than I can say for the majority.  Some of mine do volunteer translating, and they're Year Two's!

Few JETs know what they are doing in the classroom.  Plus, few can speak Japanese.  It takes between 1 month and 1 year for JETs to learn how to plan and how to teach, and in the meantime, what have their students learned?  Substandard English lessons!

And it is unthinkable that this is the best they can come up with.

Oh, and it is crazy to hold up this program as a model to be followed.  Guess what?  I've heard that several cities are going to be scrapping the JET program and hiring proven individuals, teachers or otherwise.  Most excellent suggestion.

I once showed a video of a 4 year old from my school, who got up and sang the Aussie 12 Days of Christmas song, unaccompanied, at the school concert.  Thing is, she is one of many.

So here's a recipe for teaching English in Japan:  Hire teachers, or at least people who can teach without looking up girls' skirts (perverted gaijin everywhere!!).  Teach the kids something interesting, don't treat the kids like idiots cos they're not, and don't pay the teachers so much!!  They are supposed to be here to strengthen ties between countries, not cause resentment cos they teach approximately 4 lessons a day (what, 4 hours or so?) and get paid enough for two people.  If they really believe in all they stuff they spout at interviews and orientation, then make them take a pay cut to show that they are committed!  Or is committment what they are sadly lacking in?  Sign contracts that are longer than one year.  If this is their first trip to Japan and they arent sure if they will stay longer than a year, then dont sign them cos they will leave and then the kids get YET ANOTHER round of teachers who cant teach and take forever to find their feet.

I had 1 and a half hours to find my feet.

Winding down now.  Here's the thing:  at the award ceremony a couple of weeks back, all the teachers (mostly JETs or former JETs) were excellent.  They were an awesome bunch of people.  And here's the fun bit:  none of them matched the stereotype of JET as outlined above, ie they were not green, they loved Japan, and actually cared.  Why can't they get more like that?  Then I'd be content, nay THRILLED, to have JET as the forerunner of English instruction in this country.  As it is, 90% of the JETs I've met are not good enough.


My my my what a long rant.  I feel so much better."

"event","My story begins yesterday, Friday 21st July 2006.  I spent three and a half hours at the hairdresser, then walked in the rain with a heavy nike bag of pink clothes and other essentials.  I got the shinkansen to Tokyo, which was late due to rain.  The shink, not Tokyo.

Alas, upon arrival, there was no fanfare.  Sod.

I then begin the subway dance, heading to Azabu Juban.  You can imagine the Tokyo subway system, right?  I had to hike for 600m (so the sign said, but bet it was further) up and down stairs just to change trains.  All the while lugging my beautiful nike bag around.  It was worth it tho, because en route I discovered a miracle:

For those of you not familiar with A) Japan, 2) Insanity or D) Merchandising Principles, let me give you a tutorial.  Whereupon dragging my heavily burdened self through multiple poorly-signed passageways, I discovered a new drink.  It is marketed as 'Low Calorie, Low GI, Sports Drink'.  Now say it with me, DUH.  It is essentially WATER.  Thus, is surely low GI.  The name and image of this nectar which surely makes you lose weight ('low GI!  low GI') IS:

... ... ... ... ... THORPEDO.  I double-taked then went and bought it.  Tastes like Aquarius with mild overtones of Pocari Sweat.  I have 3 spare bottles, which I shall auction off to the highest bidder.  Commence endless rounds of empty promises.

NEXT I arrived at my hotel, the OLYMPIC INN AZABU.  I thought it pretty funny to be walking into the lobby of a hotel called Olympic when I was drinking something with Ian Thorpe's picture on it.  Like I should get points for being clever??  It is a very nice place, small yet well appointed rooms.  Everything was good EXCEPT that I learned my lesson re cheap hotel razors.  I then fought to stop the blood flow before having to leave for the Embassy, which luckily was a mere 45-second walk around the corner from the OI.

The Ceremony:  Awards for outstanding excellence in the field of excellence.  Specifically, for Australian teachers living in Japan who can write a lesson plan worthy of remembrance.  There were two main prizes (1 for an Aussie, 1 for a Japanese) and 10 runners-up prizes (5 for Aussies, 5 for Japanese) of which I received one.  The main prize winners demonstrated their stuff.  The Japanese guy is a Year 4 teacher from Shizuoka.  He was awesome!!  I can see how I can actually use his stuff in my own classes.  The Aussie guy was nice, but... his stuff was very simple.  EG he tried to explain what an ALT and a JTE was.  If I taught like him, and stuck a lorikeet puppet on my hand to talk to my second graders, they would either A) be appalled beyond speech, or B) beat me with a cricket bat.  Anyway, I got some flags, puppets, and school uniforms.  As well as a very pretty certificate.  Talked to everyone I could, handed out business cards, hinted broadly at wonting to work there.  No luck.

Now, for my rant about how dumb the JET program is.  JETs have no idea what they are doing.  They don't know how to teach English because they AREN'T TEACHERS!  The people on stage were, for the most part, qualified teachers.  No wonder the kids in this country have no clue as to English--their teachers were, by and large, too lazy/stupid/arrogant to bother taking an ESL course or something before they came.  So these people force their pathetic attempts at teaching on students who need better instruction than what they are getting.  I respect the other winners of this contest for having written something useful and helpful.  I sneer openly at the idea that someone who's only claim to teaching is to be able to read a lesson plan that someone else wrote and mimic it like a monkey.  Grr it is infuriating to hear JETs go on about their 'lesson planning' and 'theories on teaching'.  They should use some of that obscenely high paypacket that they earn to buy themselves a clue.

So afterwards I went back to my hotel, and bought cold spaghetti from a vending machine near the elevator.  How to heat it up, you ask?  When there is no microwave in my room?  It's easy.  Pull a string on the side and little fairies inside light tiny little fires for 8 minutes.  So then I kicked back, listened to techno on sourround-sound, and ate Cookies n Cream in bed, reflecting contentedly that it is possible to have your cake and eat it too.  And I looked fabulous whilst doing it.

SATURDAY JULY 22:  A day devoted to the erstwhile pursuit of SHOPPING!  I love Tokyo.  I bought:

- NERV sneakers from Blister in Shibuya.  Theis year is the 10th anniversary of EVA.
- Belts, Kitty keychains, and Milky Way bars from Don Quixote.
- 2 DVDs:  Ice Princess and Cats.  Not the musical, but rather an hour-lenght feature on cats doing cute things.
- Saw POTC 2!  I actually applauded 3 times during it.  The ending is AWESOME!  Being in the aforesaid Land of Merchandising, I left the theatre via the gift shop and bought the Captain Jack Sparrow hat.  -THE- hat.

On to Akiba (Akihabara, Electric Town).  I bought:
- 2 EVA shirts (one for me, one for Toshi at work) from AsoBit.  Also a Kitty bath doll for the daughter of Ako at work.
- The manga book of the 2 EVA movies from Animate.
- A Kitty bag for Pat, my karate instructor.
- Lastly, a new Japanese-English dictionary, one that I can use a styles to quickly input kanji for lookup.  Is very cool.

Then back to Tokyo station for a quick departure.  The end."

"event","Notice of Revocation of Independence

To the residents of the United States of America,

In view of your abject failure to elect a President and thus to govern yourselves, We give hereby Notice of the Revocation of your Independence, effective today at Five O'clock Greenwich Mean Time.

Her Britannic Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume sovereign duties forthwith over all states, commonwealths, and other territories.  Except Florida, which Shall be returned to His Illustrious Catholic Majesty, King Juan Carlos of Spain.  Your new Prime Minister (The Rt Hon Tony Blair, for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will suggest to Her Majesty a Governor-General for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded.  A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:

1.  You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up ""aluminum"".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.  Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.  Look up ""vocabulary.""  Using the same twenty-seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.  Look up ""interspersed.""

2.  There is no such thing as ""US English."" We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.

3.  You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that difficult.

4.  Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast British actors as the good guys.

5.  You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen,"" but only after fully carrying out Task 1.  We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.

6.  You should stop playing American ""football."" There is only one kind of football.  What you refer to as American ""football"" is not a very good game.  The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays ""American"" football.  You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football.  Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls.  It is a difficult game. 

Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football,"" but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour).  We are hoping to get together at least an American rugby sevens side by 2005.

7.  You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any ""merde.""  The 97.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys.

8.  July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in the British Empire.  It will be called ""Indecisive Day.""

9.  All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it is for your own good.  When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.

10.  Please tell us who killed JFK.  It's been driving us crazy."

"event","quick update.  Ha ha!  Just kidding.

Work:  so busy, is the main reason why I havent updated in ages.  Good points, bad points, lots of bad ones at the moment which I would LOVE to discuss, but wont.

Study:  Japanese class until 9pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Is a nice class, but very pricey.  Still, it's better than going to a cheap class where I would essentially end up teaching it.

Karate:  I have trophies!!!  I don't work very hard at it, and I am still quite good at it.  Maybe I should work harder at it and *really* scare people.  

Other:  I won a prize (3rd I think) in a lesson-plan-writing contest organised by the Australia Japan Foundation at the Aussie Embassy in Tokyo.  So in two weeks I will be talking to intelligent people.  I want to work for them!!!

Interesting point to the week:  Some people are idiots.  I annoyed certain people at work this week cos I don't care to celebrate the US's Independance Day.  Honestly!  Why should I even acknowledge a holiday that is so decidely contrary to that of my own country and politics?  A long time ago a bunch of people went to war when they didnt have to.  They could have just waited a few years and gotten their independence simply by asking for it.  These same people are very anti-Bush for going to war in Iraq, but hey?  'Have a nice day, nothing's changed.'

I love stirring."

Nothing, by which I mean *almost* nothing, can wreck my mood.  By which I mean that having to get out of bed for longer than what is absolutely necessary to cook food, is excruciatingly painful.  My left foot keeps swelling up so I can't bend my toes.  Incredibly annoying, since my job depends on my abilities to jump from one hoop to another.

Ever tried to wear shoes when you have a foot like that?  Reminds me of when I got my green belt a year ago and the bruise was all around the bottom joints of my toes.  Then, after a day of wearing shoes at work, the bruise MIGRATED to the ends of my toes.

At least, it's ANZAC DAY on Tuesday.  Which means that every Aussie within 200km of Nagoya will converge on the Red Rock for dinner.  Including myself, although I cant go until Japanese class finishes at 9:00pm (luckily, Jap class is only 2 blocks from the Red Rock).  

And the daughter of the owner of the Red Rock goes to my school.  Yay!!!!

In other news, I shall be celebrating a certain day in June with a tournament!  The Aichi Prefectural.  Yeah Yeah Yeah!"

"event","Ahem.  IT'S MY LIIIIIIIFE!!!!!! BON JOVI ROCKS!!! BON JOVI ROCKS!!!  

:) It was a lot of fun at the concert.  My friends were unfortunately seated about 15 rows in front of me, but it was ok anyway (I say 'seated' loosely, considering the chairs were not used for anything except standing on).  Compared to the Rolling Stones concert last week, there were really very very few foreigners there.  So when Bon Jovi wanted the audience to sing a verse of a song, well, it fell flat.

But I was having a good time over in Row 39, teaching the lyrics to the Japanese around me.

I ended up buying a tshirt and two badges, both of which are currently stuck on my school bag.

Don't even ask about how school is going.  Don't.  Even.  Ask.  I thought it rather apropos that so much bad stuff happened on Friday.  And through it all, all I wanted was to crucify the troublemakers.  

Happy Easter everyone."

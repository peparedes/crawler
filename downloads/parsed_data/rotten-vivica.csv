"event","Yesterday I was in a bit of a bad mood. I was at my mom's house and Tom had my ex boyfriend Brent, his friend David and John over. I really don't like Brent; he worships Tom and wants to be like him. Brent will only talk to me/hang out with me if Tom's around.. Other then that Brent is an ass to me. So I didn't wnat to come home until Brent was gone. I guess they all were smoking up. Brent gave me a joint so I'd like him. I smoked later on  that night. I was also happy to see that John bought me Newports. Right now I'm trying to plan out everything for the next year or so. Tom and I really want to have a baby in a year. Tom was suppose to come with me to my mom's today so he can set up his DeadJournal.. Right now I am reading ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail."" I really like the book. My thumb still hurts really bad. The other night I was feeding my cat Angelus Pizza, then he acted like he wanted to lick the oils from the pizza off my finger and he bit it; it was crazy he was trying toswallow my finger while chewing on it, my thumb reached the back of his mouth and I had to tear my finger out of his mouth. It bleed like crazy. I still have tons of comics to read! 

I really hope Tom got the job at TGI Fridays."

"event","I'm so upset that I can not go to THE SISTERS OF MERCY concert. I just don't have the money to go.Tom and I blew $250 in 3 days without paying any of our bills.This impulse to go shopping is killing us. Him and I are trying to get on our meds so we can work and get on track. My problem is I'm always too high to function. I've been getting so high lately; it fees my mind and helps my creative-ness come&nbsp;out.&nbsp; I haven't cut my self in a few months, I remember back in september I lost it and cut my self all over, really bad. I carved a lot into my legs. This being an adult thing is so hard. Tom cut himself 3 weeks ago, very deep. He did it after we got into a fight. I almost left him and he had his car parked on the side of the street and he was going to kill him self. Two weeks back we had a lot of problems even the police came. We've been togeather for 14 months and now our life is getting on track. I want to go on vacation to South Carolina this summer and hang out with Chelsea she's grown up so much now, its almost like she's a new person. Tom and I want to have a baby. We plan to get me <em>pregnant,</em> in a year or so. We have it all figured out. I'm going to be going back home soon hopefuly I'm going to get high and have fun."

I feel bad because I forgot to tell him that I love him before he left. So Tom I love you. He bit my neck, omg such a damn turn on it hurt a bit but I loved it. I was happy to jut be with him. It made me happy being with him. I just hope some of the events of today don't change anything. He's the only person I get along with. I miss him already! I think he's a good influnce on me he's just like well be nice to your mom and stuff. And he's there when I'm sad and everything! i love him! Today when I was with him I knew I was in love with him, I never felt like this with anybody else. I just don't want him to think I love him for sex or anything like that. I love him for all we have in common and for his intellengance, he's perfect. and I love him more than anybody can ever imagion."

"event","I went to school very happy today. I ran in looking for Tonya but she wasn't there. The first bell rang and she still wasn't there. I wanted to tell her about Tom and how happy I am. Finally she came like 5 minutes before school started she was going to ditch with Tony they were making out in his car. I told her all about Tom and I was so happy. 

Then at lunch I got in trouble! Well back in November Kristen was starting a lot of shit with me.. Calling my cell phone and saying that I'm a slut and shit like that. So when Tonya was over Tonya called her on my cell and left her mean messages and I think I said a few things. Kristen's mom called over winter break and attempted to yell at me. I told her that Kristen started it and all the shit Kristen did. And I thought it was settled. Well Kristen's grandma went to school told the school police and I got in so much trouble. The wanted to put me on the retarted bus. I got yelled at so much, but Tonya didn't when she was the one who did almost all of it. I took the fucking blame for her. My mom picked me up form school because I had to see doctor anwar short after. I was crying becuase the school wanted to make a police report on me and all that shit. Apperently I'm mean to kristen in school when I never talk to her.. I haven't been in school in almost a month due to hospitalization. When I seen Anwar I cried a lot and I got put on a new anti-depressent. I called tom while my mom was in walgreens getting it filled. I cried on the phone to him. I told him I was sorry for crying"

"event","Today was probably one of the worst days of my life. I wanted to die, I cried, I felt compleatly hopeless. Then I just thought of Tom and how everything would be so much better once I talked to him, but then I didn't want to tell him what was going on because I didn't want him to be like ""Oh I'm with some depressed bitch! I need to break up with her."" Ahhh thats what all guys do is break up with me because I get depressed and stuff. But I ended up calling him right after I got done crying then; I had to go and I got all sad and cried some more! lol. I missed him a lot today! I love talking to him because he listens and I can trust him. I told him almost everything, I didn't say too much about 8th grade. But I talk to him about everything he's the fucking greatest! I love him!!"

"event","Well, I really like Tom.. I fell for him. He stole my heart! He called me today around 10am. He told me he really likes this girl but he may have something still there with his ex. And he dosn't know what to do and all that.. It made me feel sad. I felt like I lost him without even having him. I didn't even want a boy-friend, I could have cared less about having one right now. But then Tom comes in my life and changes all that. I don't know why I fell for him but theres just something about him. Well I told him he should go with his heart and, then he explained to me he dosn't believe in ""dating"" and labeling somebody you're girlfriend or boyfriend and I told him I understand that.. I don't know I thoguht he just didn't like me so he was saying all that. But he ended up asking me out. I'm so happy. I know I want to spend the rest of my life with him and I will be great to him."

"event","My mom took me to the mall today to meet Tom. She let him drive me home from the mall. I was talking to Tom on his way to the mall, he got lost because he was talking to me. When he walked out of the car I seen how beautiful he was, I thought that I'm too unpretty for him. I had a bad acne break out and I didn't want him to think i'm ugly because of that. I was really shy at first. He was very respectful. When we were walking around the mall he gave me his eyeliner, I was in shock because its a lot nicer then mine. He needed something to drink but he didn't have a dollar and I did so I gave it to him. He got down on his knees and called me his goddess. It made me smile. I explained to him my social anxiety he understood that really well.When we went to the book store he pointed out the sex books so i looked at them, I guess he was shocked that I did. He kinda got close to me as he walked past me. I just wanted him to hug me or something. Its so weird becuase I feel so much emotion for him. After the mall we went to Target, we were holing hands and looking at make up. This guy passed us and said ""why's this world comming to freaks?!"".. I let go of his hand soon after he held mine, I was worried that my hand would be too sweaty. Then we went to McDonalds; I didn't get anything but he got a big mac meal, and a chicken sandwitch. I'm so mad that I had to go home at 7pm because I wanted to spend more time with him. His car is awesome. While we were driving he was playing jack off jill. My new song that makes me this of him is ""Love Song"".. Yes that will be our song. He also told me I look hot while smoking! hehe"

"event","Today my mom had therapy, she had me drive her there! I did very well. She was talking about me to her therapist, and while I was waiting for her session to be over I filled out a questioner about depression and they called me in the room with them around 10:35 a.m. and they told me that they seen I have been depressed and they want me to do a partial hospitalization, and I showed them my questioner thing that I filled out and they said ""well that's good that your not suicidal."" Because on here I marked off that I'm not suicidal, because I'm not. They said I need help and they want me to do partial hospitalization. So we went to the hospital to get me registered. The place is very nice seriously its like a damn hotel. They told me I'll be in partial hospitalization for 3-6 week or longer if needed. I don't sleep there I just go there everyday at 8 am - 3 pm. I don't go on weekends though. They said they see no reason to hospitalize me because I'm not a danger to my self or other people. We also talked about my past: cutting, bulimia and other stuff like that. I'm really going to miss my friends but I need to get my self better, actually the only friend I will miss is Tonya."

"event","I hung out with Tonya and her ex Matt. Those two are so cute, I mean when they were hugging at the end of the night! I was like Aww. I Could tell that Matt liked Tonya because he got all pissed when dudes checked her out, it was kinda funny but really cute. I seen Ron and Steve they were acting like assholes to me so fuck them. We went to a cemetary; Matt acted like a asshole.

I came up with a conclusion, I HATE Bartlett. And I'm happy I don't go to BHS. I hate the perfect little rich town that if your different you get laughed at and treated like shit. I don't go around saying I hate Cheerleaders and Jocks because your different from me; I hate them (the ones that live near me) because they made my life hell when I was in school. We were sitting on the road and these 2 jocks in a mustang drive by and one says ""Die Freaks"" and then said something about our hair, Matt said something like ""I'm gonna kick your ass or something."" And they pulled over, then left. We were also walking down a street and there with a big group of hmmm how should I put this kids that thoguht they were ""gangsta"", They said ""Its not Halloween until an hour"" and they called us ""Freaks"" and stuff. Then we were walking down Jessic Ct. and another BIG group of gangster kids start saying stuff, yeah I was a little scared of them but then after what I heared them say about us I wasn't. They sounded so stupid they were like ""OMG they are going to put a spell on you"" and just a lot of bullshit like that. It was really annoying. People just looked at us like they never seen people dressed like us, and well I guess we dressed kinda slutty so they had reason to. I was also annoying by HORNY MEN, who kept looking, beeping, saying shit out the window, and making gesters. Most had wives/girlfrineds in the car with them, it really pissed me off how they dis-respected their women. Iafter today I'm not going to fucking change my self for anybody and I don't care if I keep getting laughed at for the way I dress, I grew up dressing like it and what am I suppose to change the way I look for some social class who thinks they are better then everybody else? Well I'm not going to."

"event","Byron moved back to Chicago, I don't really care because we stopped talking about a month ago. In biology we got a new kid in the class, I've known him since 5th grade and ever since then he's been a real asshole to me. Oh yeah I'm also a ""stupid goth"" I never knew I was goth. My mom works 2 jobs now and after work everyday my step-dad goes to the bar and don't come home until 9:30. Kai still has a girlfriend and I just want him to be in love with me not her. I'm getting straight A's in school for the first time in my life, before I never got anything higher then a ""C"" and now I'm getting A's its crazy. I started cutting again last Monday, I can't take this shit. My mom constantly bitches and says well don't tell me about your problems I don't want to hear it. I hate my parents I wish they would just die. I have to deal with an alcoholic step-dad who comes home drunk at 12am and makes me get out of bed and clean the house. Dose my mom not see all the stress I'm under? And then she's like well you need to go to therapy, well fuck you. Maybe I wouldn't be so stressed right now if people would listen to what goes on at school, and if they don't stress me out at home. I really don't need it. My therapist is a fucking idiot he never wants to talk about my past, all the stuff that borthers me and I am angry about. He wants to talk about ""are you cleaning your room"".. He acts like nothing happend he never gives me the chance to tell him that I was fucking Date Raped. I don't think he's a good therapist, I had him since May and he hasn't helped one bit so I'm not going back.

I'm pissed that liz has my clothes and won't re-turn them. And I hear from Kristen that she left my Otep hoodie in the locker room at school a month ago. And yet a week ago Liz wanted to barrow one of my movies and she said to my mom ""I'm careful with other people's stuff"".. She's also going around the school telling people she's pregnant by a 22 year old, its so funny because she's starting rumors about herself and she's not really pregnant! haha!"

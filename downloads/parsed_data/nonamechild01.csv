Tainted Love Lyrics



Sometimes I feel I've got to 
Run away I've got to 
Get away 
From the pain that you drive into the heart of me 
The love we share 
Seems to go nowhere 
And I've lost my light 
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night 

(chorus) 
Once I ran to you (I ran) 
Now I'll run from you 
This tainted love you've given 
I give you all a boy could give you 
Take my tears and that's not nearly all 
Oh...tainted love 
Tainted love 

Now I know I've got to 
Run away I've got to 
Get away 
You don't really want IT any more from me 
To make things right 
You need someone to hold you tight 
And you'LL think love is to pray 
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way 

(chorus...) 

Don't touch me please 
I cannot stand the way you tease 
I love you though you hurt me so 
Now I'm going to pack my things and go 
Tainted love, tainted love (x2) 
Touch me baby, tainted love (x2) 
Tainted love (x3)

well whaddaya know that was a one hit wonder by soft cell"

MIXTAPE BUTCH WALKER
You say hello, inside I'm screaming I love you
You say goodnight, in my mind
I'm sleeping next to you
You drive away from my car crash of a heart
And I don't know

But you gave me the best mixtape I have
And even all the bad songs ain't so bad
I just wish there was so much more than that
About me and you

You talk to him, and it burns me like the sun
You talk to her, and you say that you feel like he's the one
I talk to me, but you can't hear the pain I feel
You don't know

Cause you gave me the best mixtape I have
And even all the bad songs ain't so bad
I only wish there was more than that
About me and you

(Bridge)
Oh, don't turn around and say bye again
Yeah it crushes my head when you call me
Your friend and I'm not the same person
From back in the day in the back of the class
that you thought was gay
No I can't find the words cause I lost them
The minute they fell out of my mouth
And it's love and I'm in it, so give me your lips
And just let me kiss 'em 
and let's get messed up and listen to possibly...

The best mixtape I have
And even all the bad songs ain't so bad
I just wish there was more than that
About me and you

im out guys!"

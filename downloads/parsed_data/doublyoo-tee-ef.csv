School went ok i guess, and i was SAPOSE to go with andrew to a new fucking skateshop across street from palmer hall. but the douche bag never cam and picked me up. So i sat home all day and skated and did homework and slept. so today was just one big fuckin waste of time

"event","Last night me and tylers plans got ruined like 3 times. 1st-tommy said we could come over,then we couldnt 2nd- sara hall couldnt get a car i guess or something, 3rd- ryan didnt have a car so he couldnt pick us up.
SO, me and tyler sat here and gamed all night, then we made a cd and rated these hotties on buddypic.com.
then we went to bed.

This morning was pretty fun actually. me and tyler got up at 8:30 and his dad came and picked us up and we went and worked for 3 hours or so. in between working, we played with his dog, and this thing is a damned beast if i ever saw one. i would run and this THING would be on my ass within 5 seconds. I also jumped out of a 2 story house, i didnt think that the sand under me was.....was uh... hard, but it was. anyway we both earned a heafty amount of $15. and i raked for more money and i think im gouing to chapter with andrew and tyler to get a new skateboard, im happy.

lmao, when me tyler and andrew were at chapter, we met a very friendly cop. this cop was so cool, b/c we were skating, he wrote our names down and called my mommy. we didnt get in trouble, but some crazy stalker guy called the cops lol.

well i got a new board finally, so my day went pretty good i guess.

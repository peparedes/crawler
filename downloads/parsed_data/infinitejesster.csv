Here's where I am:
It took me months to finally see that Greg and I can really do what we want, and we don't need to feel guilty about doing what we want just because the situation we are in right now is a privileged one, compared to most. There are two lessons I confuse a lot:
On one hand, I was brought up to always be aware that I was a flower in a hothouse, and  never to forget for a minute how lucky I was, how privileged. I was always in danger of being called ""spoiled"" by my Dad, it was one of the worst things he could call you, back then. These days - it's obvious - he just wants me and my sister to be happy. He thinks we are good people and thank God and his job is done. But back then, I think, he was afraid we'd turn lazy or miserable with entitlement. Entitlement was the worst thing you could be. The word always reminds me of my friend who used to stand at the copy machine at work, sighing, sneering at anyone who passed: ""I didn't go to [insert exclusive small liberal arts college] so that I could make copies."" You majored in American Studies, I felt like saying. You are lucky they consider you qualified to do that.(As an English major myself, I believe I'm  ""entitled"" to make fun of anyone's impractical major). 

At the same time,  I don't believe that means she should have stayed there, copying away the day, if it wasn't towards some higher goal. I don't think she should expect to be the only one who doesn't have to pay for their journey away from the copier and towards the corner office. But - and this is where the second lesson comes in - what if she doesn't want the corner office?  That is not so much a question of entitlement, it's a question of taking the reins on your own life, and allowing yourself to pursue FOR REAL that thing that keeps you up at night, the thing that when you do it, time gets lost, the thing that is what makes you, you. My parents taught me not to be entitled, sure, but if that were the only lesson I learned, that would be a pretty sad story. Everyone has to work, but we don't have to work at something that makes us feel less alive, less hopeful, less energetic. That is a slow march towards death if there ever was one. This may also sound like some cliched graduation speech or something, but I'm shocked at how easy these things get blurred. 

A year ago, I was full of hope and I felt like I was on the brink of doing what I've always dreamed of. Then, this year, it kind of slipped away from me. That happened for a number of reasons, and I wouldn't change anything that happened. It's been among the most important, and joy-filled- years of my life. I feel that I am what religious people call ""blessed."" But it also taught me what a total pussy I can be. And I'm not going to let that happen again. I'm not going to be afraid, or overly pessimistic. That pessimism is just a ruse anyway, an excuse to give in to laziness and a fear of taking a risk. 

The truth is that playing it safe makes it so that you not only lose the freedom of doing what you want but, after a while, you also lose the freedom of a perspective unmired in what the safe universe that you have created tells you is ""practical"" or ""smart."" Playing it safe, you start to think that that one thing that really makes you tick is an entitlement rather than the most important thing in the world. 

No more of that."

"event","THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND
By Woody Guthrie, as performed by Bob Dylan, Carnegie, 1961.

As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway,
I saw below me that golden valley,
This land was made for you and me.

This land is your land, this land is my land,
From California to the New York Island,
From the redwood forest to the gulfstream waters,
This land was made for you and me.

I roamed and rambled, and I followed my footsteps,
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
And all around me a voice came singing, 
singing, this land was made for you and me.

This land is your land, and this land is my land,
From California to the New York Island,
From the redwood forest to the gulfstream waters,
This land was made for you and me.

It was early one morning, and I was strolling,
And the wheat fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling,
As the fog was lifting, a voice comes chanting-

This land is your land, and this land is my land,
From California to the New York Island,
From the redwood forest to the gulfstream waters,
This land was made for you and me.

Nobody living can ever stop me
As I go walking my freedom highway
Nobody living can make me turn back
This land was made for you and me.

This land is your land, and this land is my land,
From California to the New York Island,
From the redwood forest to the gulfstream waters,
This land was made for you and me."

"event","I am afraid of my neighborhood. It's a new development, one that came when I learned someone got shot two Saturdays ago at 10 PM on our corner. Two doors down. I researched it on the internet and found out the incident was part of a crime spree prompted by the release of a bunch of convicts all at once and suddenly. I think they were out of space at the jail. Even in prison, real estate is real estate.  I've lived  here for 13 months, and I have never been really afraid. Hookers and thugs aren't so surprising or threatening when you see them everyday. The dude who sells crack on the bench outside his Grandma's house down the road says hi when I walk by, and gives a little nod as he smokes a skinny blunt, his fat arm draped over the chipped black iron of his front-yard fence.
 
 I like this neighborhood, in a way its the only real neighborhood I ever lived in. No high rise studio apartment buildings, no hush hush suburban solitude, just the same old ladies and the fat eccentric guy with the devil beard who knows everybody and the yuppie couple whose yorkee wears little socks from Patagonia to protect their hard wood floors from his claws. The people bustling down the sidewalk carrying grocery bags, the children loitering on their scooters, the hooded teenagers laughing loudly on their on way to 14th street, it's the everyday of an urban street: every race is here, every age is here, Grandmas living on 40 dollars a month from social security neighbor lobbyists who, each night, throw fate to the wind when they park their Audis and Saabs on the street. 

And at the same time I am aware that our neighborhood represents so much of what is wrong in the world, what has always been wrong. The relentless cycle of poverty, the gentrification that is  just the latest example of an age old practice of colonizing of the less powerless, arbitrarily deeming their homes to be worth more then then can pay to keep them. Suddenly a neighborhood - the same one where back in the eighties your Dad would have locked all the car doors when he took a wrong turn and drove through it - starts showing signs of change: whimsical paint jobs, minimalist Japanese stone gardens, brass door knockers. Here is where they are talking about in those endless articles about the real estate ""bubble."" Here you still see the early results of gentrification, the directionless stunted figures, looking lost and menacing, demanding your spare change. They are the immediate results of what happens when people move in  to turn a quick buck, get in while the getting is good, before the any stragglers are swept away to jails or to neighborhoods not yet deemed ""transitional."" Projects are emptied, gutted and rebuilt as high-end condos, the carpet torn up, the floors buffed clean as a shoeshine, the ceiling oddly accessorized with faux piping spray painted silver to mimic lofts in Tribecca, an older trend in gentrification in a whole other city. Are there any real lofts in DC?  Those who lived in the former tenaments are offered more cash then they've ever seen to get out fast - a thousand dollars for your apartment, right now. But where do they go? Up to Maryland to weave through the traffic of Piney Branch Road, a four lane road never meant for people to walk near let alone on. Or they aimlessly wander the streets, peer into the windows of the houses in the neighborhoods they used to call home.

 And now, after all these months of thinking about all this, monitoring this change the way you might watch some Pachysandra you planted grow, waiting to see  their weedy roots choke the rest of the plants in your garden, greedily soak all the nutrients from the soil until they are the only thing living there, what I feel most is abject fear. I'm afraid of what it will feel like to have a gun pointed at me. I'm afraid of the way fear turns your into a wild animal, but one with faulty instincts and ridiculously prone to trauma. I don't want to face these fears I have, and the most profound one of all: the fact that I feel like maybe I deserve it. Maybe we all do, for allowing it to go on. For being a part of the exploitation, the misery and the despair. Liberal guilt, they call this, so that they don't have to feel bad about it. Enterprise, the American way. 

I tell you, there is something wrong with this town."

"event","I like heat. I like that band Hot Hot Heat just because of their name, that's how much I like heat. But damn, DC can be depressing in summer. 
All the ladies here are  wearing these really brightly colored capri pants and they all have wedgies. People are nice here, which helps things from getting too depressing. 

Everyone says ""DC is not a nice town,"" but when they say that they are talking about powerful people, Turd Blossoms if you will, not the guy getting the turkey  wrap at Subway. That guy will smile at you if the lady asking you if you want lettuce does so rudely. Now, on some days that sort of banal, ""we're all in this thing together"" camradrie can make things worse. On a bad day, when a guy with a clip-on tie gives you a conspiratorial smile at Subway, you might react with fantasies about running into mid-day traffic. it can give you that Office Space ""case of the Mondays"" feeling. (Sorry, that movie is way overquoted. I acknowledge that I have officially become part of the problem. But keep in mind it's 6:30 on a sunday, and I had lunch at Subway. Subway!). 

But anyhow, it' s better then rudeness. Rudeness is the most depressing thing of all, because it means 1. you can't control your own anger and have lost all perspective, which generally means something really awful happened to you, the knwoledge of which  depresses me.  2. you are so uneducated/self-centered that you don't know how to be nice. Socially, they left you off at kindergarden where everyone else learned to be nice. Case in point: This beyotch at Sunway today didn't want any tomatoes on her sandwich, and the dude misunderstood her and threw some on. It was really crowded and everyone behind the counter was speaking Spanish, so you know, that's the world kind of. Deal with it. In the early 21st century in the US, commercial  food preparation generally occurs in Spanish, and overwhelmingly so. So either learn it or get ready to have to ask twice for no tomatoes now and again.  

Anyway this chick, who is likely an intern and looks like she goes to a college where every other girl has the word Juicy pasted across her ass, starts yelling. ""Uh! I said no tomatoes."" And the guy is like: ""Oh! NO tomatoes? I thought you said Tomatoes."" And she - loud now- goes ""NO!"" She was so pissed. But then all of the other office folks on the English side of the assembly line start giving her the quick look that means people are disapproving of your bratty, classist behavior and thereby disassociating from it. It was pretty cool. 

But my wrap tasted ass. Way too much mustard. How do you say ""just a little mustard"" in Spanish?"

"event","I just finished Me Talk Pretty One Day, a book of David Sedaris essays I have carefully avoided for several years due to the incredibly annoying title and overwhelming popularity. Just hearing people say ""Have you read Me Talk Pretty One Day, it's soooooooooo hilarious!"" made me feel a slight bump of nausea.  I get really frustrated at the fact that society is such that people always have to ingest the same bits of pop culture leaving the rest to graze in a field on anonymity. Why does everyone have to read the same book and see the same movies?  Why do people get so into one or two things, and why do those things always have to have such irritating titles? 'Million Dollar Baby?"" Come on. I couldn't see that movie because I could never bring myself to utter those words in public. Seriously. Now, when the same thing happened with  Pulp Fiction, I had no problem with that. I had no problem because Pulp Fiction is a great film with a perfectly lovely title and it deserved all the recognition it got. This probably makes me a hypocrite. 

Anyway, MTPOD was in the guest bedroom at my parents house and it came back to DC with me on my last visit there. I both liked and disliked it. It actually is really funny, particularly the essay with the same awful title as the book. This book describes his language class in Paris, and anyone who has ever attempted to learn a foreign language will relate to it. I also really relate to his grumpy hatred of certain words, such as using the word ""out"" as a verb referring to the exposure of someone's homosexuality. With such a sensitivity to words, he could have done something about the title though. Hrmph."

"event","On friday Greg and I went to La tomate and had one of those rare experiences where a restaurant is like some magical wonderful place or something.  We got this table on the second floor right over the mezzanine thingy so you could look down on all this stuff happening at the bar below. The food was great, the wine was great. It was awesome. Greg's fish had a head on it. It was all splayed on the plate looking up at him as if in sacrificial offering.

I saw Bright Eyes on saturday. Greg Rogove's girlfriend, Sierra, got me the tickets. She plays in Coco Rosie, who opened for Conor et al. Coco Rosie was amazing. I loved it. Sierra and her sister have these beautiful voices. I think Greg told me that Sierra was trained by an opera singer and that certainly seems to be the case. Her voice is beautiful, as is her sister's. Bianca sings in this gravely jazz voice. There is also a dude who wears an indian head dress and beatboxes. It would all seem like an elaborate joke if the culmination of the music and a screen showing watercolors and ink drawings that accompany the music are projected didn't somehow end up being so lovely. 

Tilly and the Wall was the first band and they were pretty good too, with a tap dancer used as percussion, and three vocalists: one male, two female. They all had great voices and were utterly charming. 

Conor impressed the hell out of me. I even cried during Landlocked Blues. I've since been listening to the album I'm Awake...a lot  since. Definitely a performance worth seeing. He's something alright. 
****************

Greg has moved into ole 929. It's pretty freaking great right now. I never thought I would be so lucky. I was worried because the whole live in thing can be strange when you don't move in together, but I feel  like there is some kind of apartment rebirth going on. It'll be fun when someone from out of town visits and sleeps over. 

I'm feeling like kind of a dickhead for not having done shit about the tsunami."

"event","Red Right Ankle
by The Decemberists

This is the story of your red right ankle
And how it came to meet your leg
And how the muscle, bone, and sinews tangled
And how the skin was softly shed

And how it whispered ""Oh adhere to me,
For we are bound by symmetry
And whatever differences our lives have been
We together make a limb.""
This is the story of your red right ankle.

This is the story of your gypsy uncle
You never knew 'cause he was dead
And how his face was carved and rift with wrinkles
In the picture in your head.

And remember how you found the key
To his hideout in the Pyrenees
But you wanted to keep his secret safe
So you threw the key away.
This is the story of your gypsy uncle.

This is the story of the boys who loved you
Who love you now and loved you then
Some were sweet, some were cold and snuffed you
Some just laid around in bed.

Some had crumbled you straight to your knees
Did it cruel, did it tenderly
Some had crawled their way into your heart
To rend its ventricles apart
This is the story of the boys who loved you
This is the story of your red right ankle."

"event","On New Year's Eve I got back from five days in Spain. Greg and I met Barbara in Madrid and then she drove us to Granada. She had on these rubber shoes that made her look like a funny little Spanish duck. She also had a funny car that was like a little Euro SUV. It was called a Kangoo. After about an hour of catching up with her, I was transported into a weird zombie waking-sleep and when I woke up we were almost in Granada. 

We had a world of trouble parking, Barbara kept leaping from the car and asking people directions and the like. It was very funny but also surreal enough to not be ha ha funny. I was tired. Finally we get out and realize that it is as fucking cold as una teta de bruja in Granada. Our hostel is frigid. We go out to the Albaycin for some lunch. This is the old Arab neighborhood in Granada, whose stone streets twist around a large hill. The narrow paths are filled with warmly-lit little shops selling beaded jewelty, pipes, ceramics, brightly-colored belly-dancing belts with charms hanging off, turkish coffee sets, bags of herbs, etc. They are really charming but after this christmas the very idea of shopping turned my stomach and we just walked by taking it all in. We ate lunch at a vegetarian place. We had this green soup that looked like was made from snot, but it was actually spinach, and quite tasty. 

We walked around some more, toes freezing, and then went back to the freezing hostal and had a nap. Later that night it actually snowed. I had never seen snow in Spain before. It was really kind of beautiful and magical and great, especially after the 5-odd Cruzcampos that I had tasted that evening. 

The next day we went to Alhambra. Fucking beautiful. Barbara tells me that several New Year's eve ago,s he took tabs with her amigos in Granada. They got feisty and broke into the Alhambra by scaling the hill and then a wall of one of the gardens. You have to see the place to understand that this is something impressive indeed. I mean, it was an Arab fortress. I suppose if six tripping jovenes can penetrate it, its not so mysterious why the Arabs were eventually defeated. Still, they definitely knew what they were doing asethetically. It's incredible how much more attractive the Alhambra is to me than any of the ornate Europeen palaces. The geometry of the tile and wood working, the fountains that work by gravity, the incredible gardens. It's really one of the coolest places I have ever seen. 

After two days in Granada we left Barbara and took a train to Sevilla. The weather was much better there. We walked around a whole lot. That city is so great with its tiles and its  orange trees and its weird smells. One thing I love about Andalucia is it doesn't feel like Europe exactly, but  you are aware you are still there. It's like a cultural faultline, I have always been attracted to those sorts of places.

We returned to Madrid and this is when we broke down and ate Mcdonald's. I know, I know. I don't even eat McDonald's in the U.S. But Jesus Christ ,Spanish food gets old fast. The gnarly oil, the jamon on everything, eating all kinds of foods in one sitting like cheese and tortilla and olives. It just does you in. I'd like to blame the lunch choice on Greg, but I was all for McyD's by that point. I think Spain is great and in almost every respect these people know how to live right, but I never really warmed to the food there. So I traded in my last 40 bucks and something like 12 dollars of it went into the evil transnational corporation we all love to hate. Lo siento mucho Espana. I wanted to go out in Madrid that night but we were out of money and Greg was feeling bad, so, naturally I had a fit. When that was over I apologized, finished reading Bob Dylan's Chronicles, went to bed and in the morning it was back to the USA. 

Chronicles was great. The voice feels really honest. I enjoyed every minute of it. Those of us who Bob Dylan fascinates can't help but appreciate the opporunity to hear his words, his version, his story. I have always had this weird tension being a Bob Dylan fan: I am fascinated by his life and ideas, and yet disgusted by my own curiousity since I am aware of  how much he has suffered due to the intrusions on his privacy. And yet reading the book you see how Dylan too was interested in the lives and ideas of his mentors. He went and found Woody Guthrie, for instance, read his biography. What he hated was people intruding into his house, looking through his garbage, waiting outside the door for him, staring at him like a circus freak. He was afraid for his children. He felt like it was his family against the world. He really loved his family, that much is clear.  This book really cleared all that up for me. So I have been resurecting some things I haven't listened to in a long time. I am particularly hung up right now on the first disk of the Bootleg series, which I haven't listened to for over a year. This was much to the chagrin of some party guests I had the other night. I guess it's not exactly the sort of thing you want to rock out to. 

That's all for now."

"event","I am going to keep this short and sweet because the most exciting thing going for me right now is the half cocoa/half coffee drink that Todd taught me how to make here at SMPA. Good times. Fucking finals weeks. Boo. 

Greg and I watched The Dreamers last night. It was directed by Bertolucci, the guy who brought you that sickly feeling that you get from watching Last Tango in Paris. This one involves sibilings doing it and a lot of things that feel weird watching with someone you don't know but would like to maybe spank someday,  so if it is your first date, go with something a little less sexualtensionawkward, like, say, Secretary.

 I liked it though, until the end part where they join the riots in the sixties in Paris. If it were Masterpiece Theater's production of Les Miserables, I would have been charmed by the fakery and cheesey extras. Instead I was only incredulous that this was the same universe as the Paris apartment where the three main characters had just spent the bulk of the movie titillating one another (if you saw it, you will understand why the word titilation comes to mind.  Big titillations are on screen quite much). 

Okay, back to Gelman library. Why did I go to grad school again?"

"event","Today Dave got me this <a href=""http://www.viceland.com/dosanddonts/"">book </a>  for my birthday:  
Pretty, pretty, pretty fantastic. 
As I was walking to NPR to get gifted, a man in a large truck told me to smile. Always the ""S"" in S&M, I smiled awkwardly. He seemed pleased. While Dave and I were standing outside NPR, the Donnas walked by. Per Dave, they were doing an interview at NPR. They all climbed into a van and split. Dave made an ironic comment about throngs of fans outside NPR HQ waiting for their autograph. Well taken. I thought they was supposed to be like massively popular. Don't know if the lack of fans makes DC more lame or more cool than I thought, or simply reinforces the status quo of my general estimation. 

Greg is en route to kentucky. Apparently the sweetest winds DO blow accross the South. He is pscyhed to go home for thanksgiving so that is cool but I have sort of a Gregaddiction and will probably begin the jones soon. 

Bluebottle Kiss tonight at the Velvet Lounge. Yawn. I think I'll stay up and read Chroncles 1. The weirdness of BD's prose is somehow as homey and comforting as a cigarette smoked up the familyroom fireplace at 1215 Hillcrest. 

Yes so, tomorrow is my birthday.  I will be 27. Wow.   I should probably get on that whole ""maturity"" thing. When I was a little kid I used to pout a lot on my birthday because it was right around thanksgiving and I never got all that much attention for being born. I actually still have the urge. Scott sent me a muppet e-greeting thing-y which was really nice but the message was basically ""I hope this year is better than last year since last year was so terrible since I was such an awful boyfriend."" Oh well, I can't blame him. He was a pretty awful boyfriend.
I leave tomorrow for Connecticut to go hang out with my mom's huge-ass family. One time I asked my grandma why she had so many kids and she said: ""because that's what God gave us."" I was confused. I guess I thought you got to choose. Well you do now, if you aren't Irish Catholic and prone to the sort of thinking that  results in the conclusion that God gives a shit if you use birth control. Anyway, yeah. Thanksgiving. Will miss the boys in Lancaster and the annual booze and soak in Andrew's hot tub."

"event","This is my first livejournal entry. It is written ten days after a devastating presidential election. I am trying not to get to disheartened about it, and am cheering myself up by thinking about other things, like my upcoming trip to Spain. Trying to decide whether to go to Barcelona or Sevilla. Both amazing. We only have five days...."

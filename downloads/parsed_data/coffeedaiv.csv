For a time, I wrote one haiku a day. Marketting for my studio, mostly. Then i got out of the habit (and, well, other relevant stuff).

"event","<p>If I have ever talked about this, here, I cannot find the entry. If not, well, it&#39;s probably about time.</p><p>Saw a meme on FB the other day. About Futurama, it showed a variety of tear jerking scenes, with the tag line, &quot;Says it&#39;s a comedy, then makes you cry.&quot; And, one of the tear jerking scenes is from &quot;The First Martian&quot;, which does, in fact, make me cry, every time.</p><p>Not for the obvious reason, though.

So.</p><p>It was a couple days past Christmas, three weeks and some after my wife left me. I was at my parents house, as were Joe and Julie and Max. I told Max about the old irish tale about why Manx cats (like the one my parents had) have no tails. Dad insisted, yet again, that the Isle of Man (which is where Manx cats originate) is not off the coast of Ireland, but rather &quot;a channel island&quot;. This is something we have disagreed about before. And, not trivially, this is in the time before Google, so evidence to support one position or another was not readily available.

In any case, &nbsp;I said &quot;It is just barely possible for me to right about some things, sometimes.&quot;</p><p>To which Dad replied &quot;Not to me.&quot;</p><p>So, yah. I was... heartbroken, already, and my dad decided to insult my intelligence. And be wrong about it besides.</p><p>So, I ran from the house in tears. Joe followed me, hugged me, and got me to sit in his car. And then he drove, and I cried, and talked, and cried, for the next several hours.
Eventually, we came back to parents house. &nbsp;He stayed, &nbsp;Dad apologized, Max gave me hug, I left.

Went home, alone. Turned on the TV, and saw &quot;The First Martian.&quot; Which was all about brothers, and the love they share, and how they can surprise you.</p><p>It was 15 years ago. It still gets me. Every Time.</p>"

"event","<p>Not that I am asking you that. This is LJ; I am asking myself that. </p><p>Aunt Ann. My mom&#39;s older sister. She died today, of a sudden heart attack (apparently). She has (had) lived in an assisted living facility for that last several years, since Granny (her mother) died. Though she was the older sister, ... She was, essentially, mentally retarded. Though that is not quite accuate. She had developmental issues, due to early childhood scarlet fever. She just turned 80 a couple months ago; at mom&#39;s request, I sent a bithday card. I thought about sending something more kid oriented, more fun focussed, but I didn&#39;t want to be patronizing. I thought it was one of those times when what i thought was funny would not have been. So, I sent a mature card. The kind of card an adult send to another adult. I like to think she liked it, but mom has not said anything about it. </p><p>When I was a kid, whenever we went to Kentucky to see Granny and Grandaddy, she was there. When they came to see us, in California, she was there. She liked needlepoint, we had a picture she made hanging in our house in Santa Maria. </p><p></p><p>As an adult like person, I never had much contact with her. It&#39;s ... a thing in my family, in my immdediate family, not to talk too much. And it bugs me, but my attempts to be social with my brothers have never been altogether succesful. Same with my parents, for a lot of reasons. Not least? I don&#39;t have children, or at least, as far as my parents are concerned, I don&#39;t have children. So, calling my Aunt Ann was never really a thing. But she was there, and now she is not.</p><p>So. Ann is gone. She was sweet and kind. She loved (according to mom) to watch UK basketball. There was a game on, tonight. I got the call while I was postmating, and I saw that there was a UK v Georgia game on. I watched a bit of it, thinking of her. </p><p>I don&#39;t know how to talk about it. Here&#39;s the thing. I don&#39;t know how to feel about it. Or, rather, I know how I am supposed to feel, how i am supposed to react, to mourn, to heal and move on. But... So, I had only Two aunts. Each of my parents had a sister. But I had literally about a dozen great aunts and uncles. My maternal grandparents each had 6 and 7 siblings, many of whom I got to meet and interact with when I was a kid. And, as I got older, they started passing away. And each time, I knew I was supposed to be sad (and I was), I was supposed to ... do something? Feel deeply depressed for a time? But not be too dramatic, not too demonstative (Never, in my house, too demonstrative, which is a whole bundle of stuff for another time). It is the same here. I loved my Aunt Ann. And I will miss her. But I don&#39;t know when or where or how it is going to really affect me. I am not going to force tears, or prayers or mourning. I will talke about her where I can, and deal with the consequences of her death, and the impact on my mother (who I will be calling). I will deal with it. 

When I was living with mom and dad, in Salinas while I was in college, mom told the story about how, when she was a little girl, and she got excited for Christmas. And Ann said &quot;I remember when I got excited like that&quot;. And mom said, Hmph, she&#39;s only two years older, but Oh so much more mature. </p><p>That was the first time I found out that Ann was the older sister. Oh, and her first name was, in fact, Magaret. Margaret Ann Petty (Southern naming conventions, you see). And, from there, I found out that Granny&#39;s first name was not Ruth, but Ila. Grandaddy&#39;s first name was Milton (not Earl). And so on, down through the assorted great aunts and uncles. 

So, yeah. Family stuff. That may have an impact on things closer to home, in the days and weeks ahead. </p>"

"event","<p>So, there is this episode of The West Wing, that addresses (but does not resolve) CJ&#39;s father and his issues with Alzheimers. And though I have been watchning WW, again, for the last couple weeks, I kind of avoided this one. I didn&#39;t really think about it much, I just decided to watch something else, or read, or do the dishes or feed the cat... 
See, it&#39;s my dad. The short version is, Dad had a bad couple days, a couple months ago. And in the days that followed that, as my brothers(1) and I talked about it, one of the things that came up was a list of the medication that my father is taking. Six prescriptions. Some for his heart, or related issues. Two, though, for Alzheimers. </p><p>Oh, and I was reading The Shepards Crown(2), when the accident that started all this happened.

This is what I know. Alzheimers is not readily diagnosable from direct evidence. I mean, I think that you can get a brain scan, and see that there are bits not working properly. But, mostly, it is something that is diagnosed behaviorally. Observations from the spouse, and or self reported. Also, Dad has been an alcholic for 50+ years(2). And I know that has ... likely has, some measure of impact on brain function and structure and integrity. </p><p>So, short version, for whatever reason, my dad is ... not doing as well as one could hope. Of course, given 50+ years of drinking, plus 30+ years of smoking(3), plus 75+ of just plain living, raising four young men born over the course of 10 years... etc, Dad is doing remarkably well, considering. In any case, it is something that is on my mind. I know that none of us are immortal, and it is the right and proper order of things that I will see him pass. </p><p>I just know that I don&#39;t know how. I just know that when I talk to him on the phone, a difficult conversation in the best of times, lately it has been more difficult. I don&#39;t know if that is because of the a downturn (temporary or consistent; we all of have our bad days), or if this is the new normal. I know that I am here, and they, Mom and Dad are there, in Salinas, California. Brother J is in the Bay Area, and Brother C is in San Diego. So they can each be there on relatively short notice. (Brother M lives in the Virgin Islands, so is somewhat less able to get there quickly).
When I decided to move to 207, to stay here, this was something I considered. I thought, hey, I can save up and move to San Jose, do Postmates delivery work, build a life and be there for my parents... Reconnect with friends, while maintaining and continuing and moving forward with Seattle stuff and friends and family. </p><p>Which is, of course, probably a vastly unrealistic and completely unfeasible image of how things would actually go. It is actually more expensive to live in San Jose &nbsp;than it is in Seattle. I have no idea how much I would make on my bike, there, and the fact that I might be able to get an office / desk gig for Postmates is a lot to gamble on.

Do you know what your sin is, Captain Reynolds? </p><p>I ask myself that. Do I know what my sin is? Leaving aside that, like Mal, I am pretty fond of all seven. I acutally tend to fall prey to Pride. Specifically, the pride, the arrogance that says &quot;I can do that&quot;, &quot;I can Handle that&quot;. I promise more than I can deliver, to myself, and to others. I know that, finally, and I am getting better at it. I am more willing to take a moment, and more than a moment, and look at the situation, and make an honest assessment of my abilities. Which is not say an Accurate assessment; Let&#39;s not get crazy(4)</p><p>The thing is, I am pretty sure that this is a sin, a trait, not unique to me. I am dead certain I have seen it elsewhere. One place I am ... afraid, I have seen it is in Mom. </p><p>She is the one who is taking care of Dad. She is the one, the only one, that deals with him daily. They have no social life to speak of, don&#39;t go to church or engage in hobbies. They do go to the Gym, frequenly by walking. But that is pretty much it. I mean, they go out to eat, they go to the movies, they go camping (though not, I hope, in this season). They do stuff. But they do it all alone, together. And if there is something that goes wrong, if there comes a time when Mom is not able to handle the changing and changed circumstances, I am afraid that Mom will not be able to see it or recognize it for what it is. </p><p>On the other hand, there is my Aunt Ann. Moms older(5) sister. Ann is, for all practical purposes, mentally retarded. Though not really. Though she does display some of the traits, physically and developmentally of someone with Downs syndrome, this is the result of early childhood Scarlett fever. She just turned 80, and lives in an assisted living facility in Kentucky (6). The point of which is, Mom has been dealing with this sort of thing, literally, her entire life. I am sure it is not what she wanted, but it would be the height of arrogance (hah! see what I did there?) for me to assume she cannot deal with this. That she is not prepared for it. I mean, I know that this is different, in ways I cannot even begin to imagine, and I am far from being the one who knows definitively what to do.
Which is kind of the end state. I don&#39;t know what to do. I am seeing, on the not very very distant horizon, something that looks like the end of my relationship with my living father. And it looks like it is not going to be a swift and easy end, but maybe a long and difficult one. Though swift and easy is a really, really inappropriate term. But in any case, I am here, dealing with all the stuff that I am dealing with here. And in the background, one of the things is that. </p><p>So. I watched that episode. And now I am going to get my laundry out of the dryer. Because, really, what else can I do? Right here, right now, what else can I do? </p><p>



(1) Three older brothers, plus three wives. And, in one case, an additional wife, and ... others, whose title I am not privy to. Another issue for another day. 
(2) Not just a can of worms for me but an entire bait shop, that I may or may not address here another day. This is not about me, or at least, not about that. 
(3) He quit about 25 years ago. It was quite amazing. 
(4) I also think I am funny.

(5) Until I was about 23 years old, I never knew that mom was the younger sibling. Also, I thought that Ann&#39;s first name was, well, Ann. Nope. Mom is the younger, and Ann&#39;s first name is Margaret. This revelation was followed by detailing that I did not know Mom&#39;s parents first names (Granny was, as far as I knew, Ruth Malone Petty. Her Maiden name, however, was Illa Ruth Malone. Grandaddy was not Earl Petty, he was Milton Earl Petty. I was also quizzed on each of their siblings (six for Granny, Seven for Grandaddy, though not all of them survived long enough for me to have met them), and I was nearly perfect. I actually knew Aunties full and correct name ... which, suddenly and embarrassingly, escapes me right now... Jarmin. Her last name, by marriage, was Jarmin). Alma Petty Jarmin. Which means she probably has another first name, also.</p><p>Funny Story; when oldest brother Chris was getting married, 30 odd years ago, soon to be sister in law Cathy was getting the invite list. She asked Chris what &quot;Aunties&quot; name was, and he replied &quot;Auntie&quot;. That is all we called her. Cathy ended up calling my mom, to get the correct information. I actually knew that, though for the life of me, &nbsp;I cannot tell you when or where learned hat. </p><p>(6) Where mom was also born, lived, and went to college. UK, class of &#39;58, BS Mathematics. This may go a long way towards explaining how I got this way. And why I am deeply proud of my mother. </p>"

And I have concluded, or decided, that there is nothing more obnoxious than waking up at 4 am, because I am too damned hungry to sleep. So, since I had maybe a little less dinner than my body would prefer, salad. Which, in this case, means lettuce mix with dressing. </p><p>There are days, in my not terribly distant past, when I could make a truly epic salad.

And at the same time, in my heart of hearts, I secretly wonder if my ultimate salad desire is not, in fact, Roasted Salted Sunflower seeds, Blue Cheese, and bacon. </p><p>Which is to say, not really a salad at all.

Cold. </span>
Flippant answer, perhaps. But an honest one. I am, as noted elsewhere, a student of the ways of the Polar Bear. And one of those ways is to be so covered in fat and fur that walking around in the dark and snow is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. And while I am not, biologically, able to generate the necessary fur, nor inclined to get that level of fat, I make an effort to wear excessive layers between my skin and the outside world. The trick, of course, is that I also ride a bike. And in so doing, generate a fair bit of heat. Which is the point, of course, except that I also develop the accompanying issues of sweat and such. Which are a great way of dispersing heat. And, when I am necesssarily stopped, that heat goes away, quickly. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Palatino, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(248, 248, 248);"">(2) We all set outselves up to play certain comfortable social roles.

"event","<p>So, one thing and another, I have seen a couple close friends posting on Facebook about problems they have with Bicyclists. Being that I do that... Okay, look. I am a bike courier, by trade. I spend 7-8 hours a day, riding 30+ miles (sometimes less) through the streets of Seattle. Before which, I rode where ever i lived. I did not even get a drivers license until i was 28, because I had a bike. In short, I know whereof I speak. </p><p>So, I have opinions. And let&#39;s start by saying, while I am courteous, attentive, and careful on my bike, I am unusual in that. There are a lot of us who do stupid, asinine things, and cause problems in so doing. Lets take that as a given. </p><p>However. And this is a big however. When a bike hits a car, under whatever circumstances, bike loses. Car is unlikely to significantly damaged, and the driver is very very unlikely to be injured. Pedestrians? We hit a pedestrian, we are going down. So, again, not a winning proposition for anyone. Yes, &nbsp;am sure there are exceptions, and you can find / quote / cite horror stories about how a bike messenger ran a sweet little old lady off the road, or how one knocked you over and just rode off as though nothing happened.

I am saying, however, that they are unusual by the nature of a bicycle. Most of the time, in most situations, we are as likely to be injured, as badly or worse, than anyone that we encounter. This SHOULD make bicyclists more careful, and that it doesn&#39;t is ... well, because we are, at the end of the day, we are just people. </p><p>And people do not pay attention. </p><p>Because, really, it does not matter what you drive, or do not drive. Bikes run red lights? Yes. And so do cars, so do pedestrians. How many times have you been walked into by someone who was too busy texting to watch where they were going? How many times have you seen people cross the street, in the middle of the block, completely oblivious to their surroundings or the hazards or that idiot in the car who is texting a message about dinner to his husband, instead of watching where he is driving? </p><p>People, are the problem. Blame bikes, all you want. But that&#39;s bullshit. People who do not pay attention, who are rude, who are dangerous, people who are more concerned with their own right of way than the light, the stop sign, or the flow of traffiic.... it does not matter how they get around; They are always going to be that way. </p><p>Blame the person. See the person. Not the Vehicle. </p><p></p>"

"event","<p>So, at long last, I am playing financial catchup. Specifically, turning my bank statements into a spreadsheet, so I can get a handle on my budget and spending and business expenses and such. And, yes, tax burden, since I am self employed. </p><p>And as I am doing this on a Google Spreadsheet, having given up on trying to understand how to deal with Quickbooks online (and other, open source, programs), the thing that I keep coming back to is that the interface is totally alien to me. I get where it comes from (Spreadsheets look like, and function like, check registers, and, really, the old bank / accounting registers). Colums and rows. Which is not a bad thing, and workable. The first column I set up is the Date, and I have learned to add extra rows, as needed, for multiple transactions on the same day, or other non dated rows (monthly total, and running totals). </p><p>And I cannot help but feel like... I look at that and I know what I am looking at, and I can make it do stuff (because I have Learned, yay me). And yet, it is still alien. For someone like me, a small business person, tools like Quickbooks are way too powerful. Or, rather, have a huge number of features that I simply never used, never needed (I never, not once, in my many years of self employment, needed to invoice anyone for anything; When I need jojoba oil, I order it, i paid for it, i got it, I put it in the &quot;expense&quot; column of my business account). Because of the kind of work I do, as a self employed contractor (currently, and just plain self employed previously), I have irregular pay periods. That is, in a nutshell, I get paid several times a week. </p><p>So. What I want, what I keep wanting, is a program that looks like a Calendar. So I can open it up, and say, on this date, I earned / was paid this money, and I spent this much on personal stuff, and this much on business stuff. A (optional) sidebar that has weekly or monthly or yearly running totals for business and personal expenses. And, like unto it, a budget tracker. So I can see what I am earning and spending compared to what I expect to earn and plan to spend. I want to be able to enter each days expenses and income, &nbsp;(preferably by drop down menu) and with appropriate category (corresponding to the budget I create). </p><p>And then at the end of the week, month, quarter, year, I can say, hey, this is what I owe the IRS, and City and State. Having the relevant forms autofilled or at least linked, based on plainly asked questions would be gravy. &nbsp;Also, having a mobile version would be nice, so I can track expenses and income in real time via my smartphone. 

The main thing, though, is to have a bookeeping / budget tracking program that starts out looking like a calendar, rather than looking like a check register. Is there any such thing? Could such a thing be made by me, who knows precisely no programming at all? Would anyone else, at all, find such a thing useful? </p><p>And now, back to the spreadsheet.

"event","<p>I was going to post this on FB, but somehow this seems the better place for it. 
I was sick, this weekend. It came on fast; I went down to the bodega downstairs, friday evening after work, to buy ice cream to pair with the cookies that C brought home, and when I stepped, barefoot, into cold store with the cold floor, it hit me like a truck. Chills, nausea, general tiredness. That I had riden 30 odd miles, for the 5th day in a row, as usual, may also be relevant. But it was a wierd sensation. I had been drinking water all day, I had not really eaten much but I did eat. And afterwards, I came upstairs, and told C (eventually), I was feeling off, and did not actually eat any of the ice cream I had bought (yah, I was THAT sick). </p><p>We watched TV, and Saturday, got up early ish to do Dim Sum with her dad, followed by Gelato. And then the two of us went to the park, and sat on the grass, and talked about the birds and the bees (literallly, because the swallows were flying precision manuevers, and there were at least two kinds of bees in the flowers near us), and I came home and took my book to bed. </p><p>And napped. I got up, and C determined that I was really feverish, so, after some time, I decided i needed a bath, with baking soda. </p><p>This is something my ex wife taught me, as a way to reduce fever. I have no idea why it works, or how it works. It may only be that I spend a lot of time in a very hot bath. But it does work, reliably. It got me thinking. My marriage was ... well, the fact it is over, has been over for longer than we were married, is pretty telling. And If anyone ever asks, I tell them the truth as I see it (TL:DR, it was both our faults). And at times like that, I am reminded there were good things too. And those are worth holding on to. </p><p>Fever broken, time for bed. </p>"

"event","<p>So, i am 45 years old. </p><p>I have been playing D&amp;D since i was in the ... fifth grade? Ish? Older brother Joe introduced me to it, and we played in the livingroom with our older neighbor from down the street, Robert, as the DM. Us, Richard from two house up, Joe&#39;s friend John Angelos, Mike Long (I think? he may have joined us later) Roberts little brother John... Others, I am sure. It was the neighborhood kids game. Later, we pretty much all summer (though god only knows WHICH summer, all I know for sure it was still elementary school for me), in our backyard. We set a card table flat out on the grass, played laid out on beach towels, all day in the sun. A home made module, that Robert wrote. It was a quest to become gods. I played a 30h level Ranger, 15th level magic user (that this was completely outside the rules is totally irelevant). My hit points were maxed out at 110, and I had an 18/00 strength, back when that meant something. Oh, and a -8 AC. A +1 intelligent luckblade sword (that I was completely unaware of granting wishes for about half the game), and a +2 warhammer. It was awesome. </p><p>Today, I spent all day playing Pathfinder Society game, working through The Emerald Spire. We only got through two levels. I played a Thief (well, okay, a Rogue, but with a charisma of 8 and a Dex of 18, focussed more on physical skills than on being charming, I think Thief is a more honest statement (and thank you, M, for the idea)). We started the game at Phoenix, and moved to Panera bread with the store closed. My character went from first level to third, by the end of the day. I was playing different people, than I usually play with for Sunday Pathfinder Society, so I did not get to take advantage of other people granting me a flanking bonus (no sneak attack for me, alas!). But just for a moment (that lasted about 7 hours), I was a kid again, courting sunburn and dehydration, drinking sun brewed tea, building memories that will last a lifetime.
So far. </p>"

"event","<p>I spent the morning, over and through breakfast, reading my Awesome Neice Jen&#39;s novel, &quot;BattleHealer&quot;, which she sent me an EXTREMELY advanced readers copy of (I am only the third person, after her parents, to get to read this). It was very good. Well, no. It was brilliant. However, proud uncle bias aside, it was very very good. Yes, needs some polish, and when I have digested it a bit more, I will be able to maybe offer some better, more constructive thoughts than &quot;you are aweome and this is great!&quot; &nbsp;Though she did not want detailed edit thoughts (which is good, I am not a practiced editor), I do have some post Uncle filter things, broad impresssions, I can offer. 
I spent the afternoon at Phoenix Comics, waiting on (because I arrived early) and participating in a signing by G. Willow Wilson, who writes Ms. Marvel. I got both the trades that I have signed. I am, perhaps, not exactly the &quot;target audience&quot; for this book. I am, after all, a middle aged, middle class (more or less), straight (more or less), white, man. I am, of course, also a fan and reader of comics since 1984?ish? And while this is a book about a young girl of Pakistani and muslim family who lives in New Jersey and acquires super powers (and thereafter, hilarity ensues), as far as I am concerned, that all takes a back seat to the fact that she is awesome. Her story is awesome. And G. Willow Wilson is awesome at telling it. Awesome, in my opinion, trumps everything else, in terms of what is important about a story.
The event had a lot of people there (and cupcakes, decorated with Ms. Marvels lightning bolt symbol, from Cupcake Royale, YAY!) and I got to chat with several of them about various things. I mentioned being on the massage team for PAX Enforcers, and that turned into a discussion of superhero style teams of folks with regular jobs. Which reminded me of Global Frequency, which is pretty much just that. And, appropriately, featured a story about a Parkour runner who had to sprint across London to disarm a weaponized ebola bomb, that happened to be on the London Eye. The person in question was a dark skinned (possibly of Indian) woman, who, as she scaled up the eye, inspired a little girl to say &quot;Hey, Spiderman is a girl! And she looks like me!&quot;
Good time.
Came home, read the second volume of the Ms. Marvel trade, had awesome chili for dinner thanks to C, downloaded a library book e copy of Dreaming Spies, by Laurie R. King. The lates Mary Russel and Sherlock Holmes novel. Great fun.</p><p>It has been a good day to read. </p>"

Bad things. 2 year Massage License Suspension. High School friend lost the battle with his depression and took his own life. Bike got stolen. Assorted small dramas, most of which were pretty large at the time. Or seemed that way. 

Good things. Working for Postmates, losing weight and riding bicycling A Lot. Older Step Daughter got Married. Younger step daughter started college at Evergreen. Bio Daughter gave birth to a beautiful young lady, Jamie. Oldest nephew and wife came to Seattle to visit, during Superbowl weekend (the one Seahawks won, so the important one), then, some time later, they decided to have a baby, also, and did so in good order (also in February 2015, so not strictly speaking part of this review). She is Shiny. Saw family, will be seeing more family this summer. 
Bought a new, better bike. 

Looking forward. I am learning, slowly, to stay in the moment. Mostly, my mantra is &quot;Do the thing in front of you, Daiv.&quot; Sometimes the job in front of me is a huge hill to climb (like, Denny, which no longer makes me go around it) or the feeding of the cats (as I have just been reminded).

"event","<p>So, as you probably know, I am and have been working for Postmates for 11 months now. For Reasons. As a result of this, &nbsp;I am on and active in discussions on the Facebook group for Seattle Postmates. Since i want this gig to work out and lead to other stuff, I make a point of staying positive. When I raise an issue, or have a problem, I do my best to suggest a solution. </p><p>One of the thins Postmates does is to run Promotions. For example, right now, and starting yesterday, one can get a slice of pizza (or two) with a soda free. Just pay the delivery fee, which varies quite a bit depending on where you are. For me, this worked out pretty well. I get paid a percentage of the delivery fee, plus tips. In this case, since I determine where the best place to get the pizza slice is (closest joint to the drop off point), Postmates just assumes I am going to pick up the pizza downtown. So, when the drop off point is in the U District, I get a heft fee. Yay. 
But then this happened. On Facebook, one of the other delivery folks said &quot;This promo is so retarded, I cannot deliver fountain soda so I cannot do this at all.&quot;

What I wanted to say, &quot;First off, if you ever use the term &quot;retarded&quot; as a deragatory remark in my presence again, we are going to have issues. This is not okay. Second, you are an idiot, Get a canned soda.&quot;</p><p>I am well aware that &quot;idiot&quot; is an outdated term for exactly the same thing that &quot;retarded&quot; refers to. <span style=""line-height: 1.4;""> And viewed in that light, my willingness to use idiot as a deragtory term while objecting to &quot;retard&quot; is, at best, blatant hypocrisy. 
Leaving aside my family connection to someone with (my mothers older sister) being, in a nutshell, mentally retarded (though not actually; her developmental issues are the result of damage resulting from early childhood scarlett fever). This is just something that bugs the hell out of me. And, since you know me, you probably know this. 

But the thing is, it is not my place, not my job, to correct other people about this kind of thing. Not in that public forum, anyway. As much as I would like to make an issue of it, and correct him, the high road, the right thing to do, is let it go. I think. Then again, if he called a woman a bitch, how would remaining silent be the right thing to do? If he called a black man a nigger, or a mexican person a spic, and I remain silent, how is that the high road? Am I doing the right thing, or am I just being silent, for fear of criticism? </span>

"event","<p>So, I just finished re reading &quot;Raising Steam&quot;, by Sir Terry Pratchett. Great fun (though, really, not his best work ever, still leaps and bounds better than many many other things I have seen and read). </p><p>And as one does, I am thinking about how I would adapt that story (in a nutshell, the introduction of a railroad line to a fantasy world) to an RPG. In GURPS, the mechanics are easy. Just say that this one person / group / culture has transitioned to Tech Level 5 (I think that steam engines are Tech Level 5) and Bob&#39;s your uncle. In Pathfinder, though, it is a bit more tricky. In Pathfinder, there is no such thing as the concept of Technology Levels. I mean, they kind of sort of halfway acknowledge it with the Gunslinger class, and the Alchemist, but it&#39;s not considered an important aspect of the world. Which I think is fine, except it means there is a whole plethora of stories that can be told that are not being told because there are no rules for telling them. I mean, they have Super HIgh Tech Spaceship crash city in the Inner Sea World Guide, but they do not really explore the progress and the implications of the progress between the default state and the higher (or lower) technology levels. </p><p>I think a part of that may well be that magic is so completely pervasive in the Pathfinder ruleset that technology does not need to develop. Why learn what causes diseases when the Cleric down the street can cast Cure Disease, and you are good to go? Why make a better sword, or stronger building material, when somone can case a spell that has the same effect? Technology does not progress when there is no need, and with magic (and the ever expanding spell lists), there is always going to be a magical way of doing the thing that you want to do. </p><p>So. How would one make a railway line, with existing magic? Wagons exist, in Pathfinder Cannon. So. How about a modified wagon, with the Spell Animate Object? Ah, but that only lasts for an hour per caster level. However, it can be made permanent, with a casting of Permanency. The thing is? Animate Object is a Clerical / Bard Spell. Permanency is a Wizard spell. And both are pretty high level (6 and 5, respectively). That said, though. totally doable. Build large &quot;wagon&quot;, create rails to make the way easier to travel, let it pull cargo carts and (why not) passenger cars, Bob is, once more, your Uncle. </p><p>But. Okay, this is a Clerical Spell. WHY would a Cleric cast such a spell? And hire or enlist the aid of a wizard (sorceror) in making it permanent (or, alternately, cross train to become a sufficiently competent Wizard to do so oneself)? Well, what is the impact of railway lines? Trade, of course, as well as moving people, for fun and profit, from place to place faster and safer than is otherwise possible. So, a Cleric of a Diety of Trade and Civilization (Abadar certainly fits the bill, from the existing canon), hires on a highish level wizard to cast Permanency, and then hires the PC&#39;s as trouble shooters to protect the construction crew and help negotiate the obstacles that come up while building the railway line between City and Other City. </p><p>And in the meantime, maybe someday somebody will institute rules for a given cultures understanding of technology. And, by the same token, the cultural understanding of the workings of Magic. After all, if a game allows for Tech Level (that is what the PC&#39;s have, based on their home culture, with the advantages and disadvantages to skills and circumstances), why not allow for a &quot;Thaum&quot; level, to represent a cultural understanding of Magic (and how it works)? </p><p>Oh. Oh, Dear. </p><p>One could use the Animate Object spell, directly on the lead car. One could also build in a treadmill, and populate it with slave. Or Zombies / Undead. Or apply &quot;random evil necromantic magic&quot; to animate the engine with the souls of the conquered. Train of EVIL! Does not even need Permanency.

"event","<p>The sun will, with any luck at all, rise again in just over three hours. On my beloved mothers birthday, on the first day of winter, on a day that will be a little longer (in daylight terms) than this one was. And I will be awake to see it, more or less (not counting on the weather cooperating, to say nothing of being on the western slope of the hill (and, not putting too fine of a point on it, on the West Coast). It has been a trying year, and if nothing else, staying awake all night gives me time for reflection, and rededication. </p><p>So. </p><p>My daughter, bio daughter, has decided to continue speaking to me. And two days ago, she gave birth to a little girl. To say I am overjoyed and delighted beyond all measure is understatement for lack of better terms. Let the spoiling begin. 
And like unto it, my oldest nephew and his wife are expecting, due in February. I am looking forward to meeting this one, as well, and doing my best to be a source of unconditional love, approval and support. Also spoiling, to the best of my ability. </p><p>Work. On the one hand, I have completed over 1,000 deliveries for Postmates. That took a bit over six months (would have taken less, but I did a month of driving delivery car, on a temp basis, and rode delivery bike less on that basis). I am angling for an office position, here in Seattle, when one opens up. I have alos been nominated for &quot;Postmate of the Month&quot;, which is pretty awesome. The nomination is worth a bonus, and if I win, I get a bigger bonus. More, though, it is nice to have my work and efforts recognized. 

Massage. Sigh. Short version, two (more) year suspension, plus ...stuff. Which, I admit, is better than the three years that the persecution (sic) originally wanted. But it effectively means I am not returning to the studio in any kind of reasonable basis. I will have to start all over again, and have to prove to the State that I have learned my lesson. </p><p>The slightly longer version is that this is the best settlement that could be arranged. The persecution simply would not budge on certain issues, and taking this to court, with what amounts to &quot;she said, I say&quot; testimony, would not likely work well for me. That I have endorsements and piles of postive reviews means nothing to the state, apparently. If someone says that they hate me, that is true and unbiased (regardless of the fact that those offering that said nothing to me, at the time, but talked to one another, over the course of months, before contacting the state (which was deemed irrelevant)). But those who actually like my work are clearly just my friends, and cannot be trusted. As my lawyer says, the state has a very 1950&#39;s idea of what massage is, and how it is and should be practiced is biased against men (and, as he says, Asian women (who he also represents in similar cases)). 

Still, the same day that this came down, I drew the Fool card in my daily Tarot, and I learned (via LinkedIn) of a local Massage guy who is starting a massage school and continuing education classes, and who is looking for teachers to help him. I expressed interest, mentioned my background in teaching and my masters degree in education, and experience in massage. And, in the interest of full disclosure, told him my license is currently suspended. He got back to me and said that he will be in touch. </p><p>I do not know, of course, if anything will come of it. But teaching is something I very much want to do, something I have wanted to do for a lot of years. Even if this is not that opportunity, another one will come up, and sooner or later, I will find the teaching position that suits me. Whether or not I can teach massage with a suspended license remains to be seen. 

Haiku. Years ago, I had a website called GeekHaiku.com. Basically, original haiku with an associated image (such as the one shown above). I attempted to parlay that into t-shirts and other stuff, via Cafepress and, for one christmas season, a small print shop in Berkeley when I shared studio space with Theresa. I successfully sold some T-shirts and calendars. But, honestly, did not have a clear idea of what I was doing, nor did I have the willingness to devote the time and energy to the project it required to make it worthwhile. However. Technology has wrought changes. I just tonight discovered Teespring.com, where you design your own tshirt, with uploaded art (or their library of clip art) and or text, set it on one of several different kinds of possible shirts, decide on a price point, decide how many to try to sell, and then make it a campaign of a set length. So, I decided to give it a shot. Designed the shirt (using an old, very well recieved haiku), selected and applied art, set the parameters, and launched the campaign. </p><p>I am not expecting this to be the Next Big &nbsp;Thing. Honestly, if it profits me enough to pay for a cup of coffee, I will consider it a win. I am, in any case, expecting it to take longer, be less profitable, and more work, than I think it will. But since there is no money from me up front, I have nothing to lose but time and effort. On the other hand, I expect to learn lessons, and if I make some money, and maybe make some people laugh on the way, so much the better. I have a fairly huge number of haiku I have written over the years, and some of them are even almost good. More to the point, they are perhaps T-shirt worthy. So, we shall see what happens. </p><p><a href=""http://teespring.com/TouchFusion"">http://teespring.com/TouchFusion</a> </p><p>Take a look, and if you like it, maybe share the link. 

Two and half hours, plus a bit, until sunrise. The candles still alight (both real fire and the LED in front of me). Coffee is hot. C and the cats are all asleep. And I, knowing I will not be working as much as I would like this week, decided to ride my usual delivery shifts for Monday (11-2, 4-7). Because, hey, how badly can riding 20 miles up and down hills, in winter weather and winter dark, on no sleep, go? </p><p>I fully expect to find out. </p><p></p>"

"event","<p>This has been rattling around my head for a while. What would the real impact of healing magic be, on the world? </p><p>In D&amp;D, healing magic is basically commonplace. The entire point of the Cleric is to be able to patch up the &nbsp;rest of the party after a fight. Yes, okay, Clerics can be badass, can do offensive fightery stuff, etc. And, depending of the Diety, may not even have healing magic (though that means there either needs to be a different healer in the party, or something very strange is going to happen). The thing is, as with many aspects of D&amp;D (et al), the larger impact of this seems to be ignored. What if the healer charged for his services? What if the entire church charged for their services? After all, Temples to Sarenrae will not just build themselves. They cost money, to build and maintain. Plus, all of the non adventuring clerics (because, really, they have to be there, right?) and their acolytes and support staff. They deserve a decent wage for a decent days work. 
Taken a step further, and add the concept of religious evangelism. Now, in real life, I loathe evangelism. But in the context of a game, it makes the world interesting. What if the cost of healing is labor for the church? How much healing does wiping out a tribe of Orcs get you? And if you die in the process, will they resurect you? At what cost (in a world the include the Speak with Dead, post mortem negotiations become an option). And if you go into debt to the church, well, there are always the Geas spells. 
So, really, my question is, why aren&#39;t the churches running the entire world of D&amp;D? In competition with one another, perhaps, or maybe cooperation within a given Pantheon (so, for example, a follower of Ares could go to a temple of Demeter for healing, at a better price than she could get from the temple of Frigg. </p><p>It need not even be only &quot;Evil&quot; temples that do this. There is, after all, nothing intrinsically evil about keeping your word, or about honoring a contract (though, yes, contracts are going to be a great deal more common in Lawful temples). And while it can be argued that Good includes the concept of Charity, what is the greater good; healing a fighter who keeps getting hurt by picking fights with Ogres? Or healing the farmer who broke his leg plowing the field that grows the wheat that feeds the village? Ideally, of course, the church wants to heal both, and everyone else. But that requires more people who are called to and trained in the churches service (and to convince some of the to stay and work in the temple, rather go out and help that guy beat up Ogres). And, as noted, that requires resources. Where do those resources come from? After all, is it not stated, The Gods help those who help themselves? </p><p>Why, yes, I am reading a Kobold Guide.

"event","<p>So, as of early on October 12, 2014, I officially turned 45. Yay. </p><p>As Birthdays go, this one rocked quite a lot. 
I cheated a little bit. Tradition dictates that I quit coffee/caffiene from the last Sunday in September, until the morning of my birthday. Experience has shown this makes me (and, more importatly, the people around me) miserable. So, I did a slow reduction for a week, and two full days without any caffeine at all. It was notable, though, since I was working (read, bicycling) a lot, I got through it with less difficulty than I have in previous years. And I broke the fast a day early. </p><p>Since I moved to Seattle, and thereafter discovered Pike Place Bar and Grill offers &quot;All You Can Eat&quot; waffles, it has been part of my birthday celebration to indulge in an &nbsp;&quot;inifinite&quot; number of waffles. With Coffee, orange juice and meat. This time, also with C. The waffles were Pecan with strawberry topping (the pecans are candied pecans, in the waffle batter). SO good. My infinite number was 4, this year. This followed by going to Gamma Ray lounge to puchase a &quot;Wild Talents&quot;, a superhero RPG book I have been looking at since I saw it at PAX (Since i get paid by Pax shortly before my birthday, spending that paycheck on birthday indulgences is part of the fun). And then, after hanging out at home for a bit, up to the Madisson Market Coop for the Cascadia Cheese festival.</p><p>I got there late, but they still had goats for pettng, and cheese for tasting. Delicious. I brought home some smoked jack that is just wonderful. Also, GOAT! I did not bring home a goat. 
Over pesto pizza dinner (home made, from assorted Trader Joes stuff), C and I watched Journey to the West, rented via iTunes. Neat movie, from the same folks that did Kung Fu Hustle and Shao Lin Soccer. Not as funny as I kind of expected. Not as slapstick, had a very different cultural perspective than I am used to (not just the subtitles, though that was a part of it). As C says, it is a great movie, and not one that I am certain I would recommend to everyone I know. </p><p>Sunday. As arranged, we got up and out for The Gathering of the Tribe for Dim Sum (October Birthday Edition). Sadly, due to sickness, travel and other concerns, of the 5 (known) October Birthday People, I was the only one who made it. Still, though a smaller group than we sometimes have had, I was able to indulge my gluttony to an acceptable degree. And, as ever, having time with the tribe is delightful. </p><p>Home, again. Presents presented. I now have a electric hand mixer, and a birthday card from my parents that plays Revile. Dinner was Palermo, with C. We split a Salmon salad that was really great, and I had Gnochi in a gorgonzolla sauce, and C had Raviolli (I think lobster Raviolli?). Plus a nice wine, and dessert. Home again, watched Tangled (again rented from iTunes, which is very much a living in the future thing). </p><p></p><p>Many many birthday wishes, via facebook and email, etc. Again, living in the future. Also, I shopped for, and bought, a new book (Tigerman, by Nick Harkaway) that I downloaded and installed on my Nook. Which leads me to conclude that the best part of getting older is that it means I get to live in the future. </p>"

I rode. Wind picked up and I have the areodynamic qualities of a brick. Still, made it to Ballard in good time (Via Fremont bridge), found the pickup place (On Market), parked and locked up.
Noticed a significant wobble in my rear wheel. Determined that I was missing a spoke. Not broken, gone.

"event","<p>&quot;How do you like it?&quot; 
This is the second most common question I get. For the record, yes. I work for Postmates (though as an independent contractor). And I love it. Ask me again in six months, when the snow is four inches on the ground. </p><p>That&#39;s is the short version. The long version is... well, longer. 
Some background. My massage business is on hold, while I am dealing with issues around my studio. I will be resuming practice, at some point. Though I intend to continue working with Postmates for the foreseeable future, because it is a good gig with some surprising benefits.</p><p>What Postmates is, is a delivery service. People download the app to their phones, and decide to have something (Nearly always food, from some local eartery) delivered. They order. I get a message on my phone, and I see what is being ordered, from where, and where it is being delivered to. Also, the delivery fee, of which I get a percentage. Then, ideally, Postmates customer service calls in the order, while I am on the way there. I get there, I pay for it, I pack it up and take it to the customer. They sign off, and I am off to my next delivery. On a good day, this happens about 11 times in 7 hours (My personal record, for a 7 hour shift, is 14 deliveries). 
What this really means is I am riding my bike, up and down Seattle hills, for most of 7 hours a day. I have been doing this since May, and while I do not have a scale, I would estimate that i have lost at least 30 pounds. I know my stomach bulge has gone down, and my legs are way more muscular than the used to be. I also feel more energetic, overall. And while i would be huffing and puffing to get up Pike street three months ago, I now look at Denny way and think &quot;Not a problem&quot; (except when I think, bugger that for a lark, I am going around). I also note that I eat A Lot, now. I mean, I look used to look at a 14 inch sandwich as a days worth of food. Now, I think it&#39;s lunch. With Chips. And a drink. Oh, yeah. I drink water. I drink a LOT of water. </p><p>The job pays okay. More than that, though, i feel more ... connected, more at peace. As noted previously, when I was a kid reading Greek Mythology, I always liked Hermes best. Time passed, stuff happened, I embraced (or was embraced by ...) Eris. I am, and always will be, a Discordian. And I still acknowledge others, as well, and seek wisdom and guidance where i can find it (not going into details, because it is not relevant). Starting this job, though, I added Hermes to the list. After all, I named my bicycle that (partly after the bike in Kino&#39;s Journey). 

And all of this is occurring, basically, during the summer. Summer will end, as it must, and turn to fall, and winter in turn. So, yah, I will be out there (not in a kilt, which wear for preference these days), as neither rain nor snow nor dead of night will stay me. Do not ask about big green things with teeth. Or Mrs. Cake. </p><p>Also, I am thinking about writing a parody about the bicycle community coming together to form a perfect society. Calling it Bicycle Farm (Four Wheels Bad, Two Wheels Good).

"event","<p>In D&amp;D, Dragons are big, and a big part of the setting. Dragons are Big. And Big things eat A lot. One way or another.
Imagine a Dragon at a Salmon spawning ground, where one can practically walk across the water on the fish, and never get wet. </p><p>And yet, killing a dragon is almost not a big deal. In particular, there are not game mechanical consequences for doing so (or if there are, since my reading of source material is pretty limited, I am not aware of them). Killing a dragon is removing the top predator from the ecosystem. And while the rest of the system is recovering, there is going to be a scramble of competition to replace that apex predator. So, thoughts. One, Dragons should have a huge .... support staff? in their region. Everything from entire tribes of Goblins, or Kobolds or Orcs or Elves, all the way up the CR chain to Half Dragon Giant WereBats. (Depending, of course, on the age of the Dragon in question). Dragons should be a big deal. (That Dragons do not, by default, get character class levels strikes me as a major oversight.) And at the same time, they should be very very rare. Particularly dragons of an advanced age, within a given region. They should be territorial (even the metallic / good Dragons). And within that territory, be absolute monarchs (benign or otherwise). 
Which is not to say that the Dragon a particular area is necessarily visible, or the known ruler of the region. Dragons with high levels of Stealth, supplemented by intrinsic or character class granted invisibility, and or Dragons who enact policies through front men (or whatever), seems a reasonable thing to do. 
And that begs the question (to me), what happens when a regions dragon dies? Of Natural causes, or because someone (another Dragon?) stages a Coup? 
And all of that said, if there is no Dragon in a given region... what is it that is big enough, and hardcore enough, to keep the Dragons out?

If it is at the bottom of, say, Queen Anne Hill, and you are at the top, I will, by bicycle, deliver that thing to you. And if you do not tip me for doing so, I will be sad. </p><p>I have been consistently riding 20+ miles a shift. I suspect this will please my doctor to no end. </p><p>Oh, I have a doctor. And high blood pressure / cholesterol. For the moment.
Today, I rode from Beacon Hill to Northgate. Not, i must admit, all at once, I stopped in the U district to eat bananas and drink juice. I knew this was going to be a good day when I noted the temperature, before 8 am, was 67 degrees. 
Spent the weekend in California. Saw most of my family. My oldest brother, and my sister in law, were visiting my parents, so my immediately older brother, sister in law, and their sons and I met all them down at Gordon Biersch in San Jose for Dinner. It was a lot of fun. SiL Julie announced a new job. I gave away an easter present to the boys. 
Saw and spent the night at friend D&#39;s house. D&#39;s dogs and cats were sympathetic to my massage related dilemma, and suggested that animal massage was a worthwhile thing for someone like me to pursue (there is, as it turns out, a school for that up here, that I have bookmarked for future reference; regardless of other issues and factors, it may be a good thing to branch out into).

And the not good thing. </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">My friend Matt passed away. And most probably committed suicide. I found this out, Saturday night.</span>
<span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">Matt and I went to high school together. We were in the same class. When he got a car, he started driving me to school, arriving early at my house to pick me up on the way. It was consistently early enough that I invited him to make himself at home. And watch ESPN, which he did not have access to otherwise. Over the years of getting to know one another, I learned that he was struggling with issues. I mean, I&nbsp;have issues. What Matt had were full on demons. And his stories are not mine to share. I will only add that, arrogant and self centered as I am, I never thought I could help or cure or solve his problems. I wanted to, always, but i recognized the limits of what I could offer. And i gave what I had to give, when it was there for me to give to him. 
Since those days, we grew apart, but somehow managed to keep in touch over the years. Facebook served us well. Until, i guess, it was not enough. I keep coming back to Leave Out All The Rest. Which is, i think, more about me than him. Our tastes in music were somewhat divergent. 

Things, overall, are getting better. Slowly, sporadically. I am tired, of course. Work is going to be that way, for a while. But I am, as I say, making real progress. And learning tricks of the trade. And abusing the heck out of my bike, so I need to watch out for that. </span>

"event","<p>Two cultural ... things that I am deeply fascinated by, are Voodoo and Cargo Cults. 
Of the former. I find voodoo an endlessly interesting practice and religion that I have absolutely no interest in practicing. I have done some reading, and will do more as opportunity presents itself. I think the cosmological structure, in particular, makes a lot of sense to me (though, again, I am no kind of expert, and my understanding of it is probably a reflection of my own ignorance more than anything else). And the inherently, deliberately, syncretic nature of it, the synthesis and integration of other deities and spirits into the pantheon amazes me. </p><p>And then there are Cargo Cults. For those less anthropologically aware than I (and that takes a bit of effort) &quot;Cargo Cults&quot; is a name for a ... phenomenon? that occurred on South Sea islands during World War 2. Basically, the natives saw Allied soldiers building airstrips, and then cargo planes would arrive, carrying stuff that was much more technologically advanced than what the islanders were used to. So, they took it upon themselves to build their own airstrips, in the hopes of attracting the same kind of &quot;cargo&quot; that they were seeing given the allied soldiers. More or less, in a nutshell, with a grain of salt. 

Anyway.</p><p>One of my long standing thoughts is, how to integrate Cargo Cults into a fantasy game system? More to the point, how would one make that work? <span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">And, hey, what about Voodoo? I mean, there have been some decent Voodoo base magic systems in at least a few games (GURPS comes to mind). That is the thought that just occurred to me, tonight. Voodoo and Cargo Cults. Two great tastes that taste great together. Or something. </span>

"event","<p> Massage issues. I have decided to give up my studio in Fremont / Ballard, for the time &nbsp;being. Being unable to work there, and the fact that the landlord is pretty totally unresponsive to issues (my heater had not worked, at all, since December; there are noise issues, from places downstairs, smell issues, etc), it all seems like a good idea. I expect that, when I have other stuff resolved, I will be back to Fremont. I like the area, and I want to continue working on building my client base. That said, outcall is still going to happen, and other options will be explored. 

In the meantime, I am now working for<a href=""http://wordpress.com/?ref=footer_blog""> Postmates</a> . Which means, I get to ride my bike, make some money, and have some fun. Though... My first delivery today was interesting. Person who lives right around the corner from me wanted stuff from Whole Foods. No problem. I get to WF, and find that the first three things on her list are specific brands or sizes that WF does not seem to have, and the application is telling me there is no phone number. OH, and if one is more than five feet away from the door at Westlake WF, then there is no cell phone reception or WiFi. At least on my work phone. </p><p>And, just to make things interesting, the work phone told me the battery charge was low. <span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">I figured out the phone number, got clarification on size and brand issues, &nbsp;got what she asked for, made the delivery. And then, the phone completely ran out of charge. Which made it impossible for her to sign for the stuff I just delivered. 
BUT, because she was awesome and a techie (her words), she happened to have the right kind of charger. So, plugged in, settled accounts, and finished the job. I am offline for the moment, while I am recharging the phone. 

And then there is this. My Older step daughter is getting married, in a week. My younger step daughter is moving away to college (of course, moving away actually means moving closer to me, woot!). My bio daughter is ... undergoing significant life change of a happy sort. Details when I am permitted to release details. 

I am so very very glad to be working again. Even if I am off to a rough start, this is a job I really think i will enjoy, and can do well and do good with it. 
And so, now that enough time has probably passed, I am going to get back to it. </span>

I keep thinking, I feel like I am learning to make a wheel, when it comest to marketing, advertising, running the business. Some things I learned from my brief stint at Imprint. Some of it, I figured out myself. Bits and pieces, I get from other people. Very very little of it is stuff I remember learning from my massage school days. 

A lot of that (the massage school stuff) comes from the fact that I was in School (as opposed to my apprenticeship) more than 10 years ago. And the the &quot;this is how to set up and run a business&quot; classes were not... well. Ten years ago? Facebook was not ... relevant. Groupon was non existent. Yelp took no time. No Twitter. Etc. 
And yet, the assumption was, in a nutshell, we students could step out of the school, hang a shingle, and make a good living. </p><p>So. I am thinking about my next project, about writing a book. An instructional manual about setting up and running a successful massage business. Of course, I would be well served by having a successful massage business, while I do that. And it would be useful to see that the ground I want to cover has not yet been, as it were, done to death. I mean, if there are already several shelves full of books about how to set up and run a massage business, why bother (other than, you know, having a background in Education and technical writing, and more than a few friends who might be willing to offer technical advice in exchange for a massage...). 

The more i think about it, the more it feels like a good idea. </p><p>I should, of course, make sure that the cats are fed, first. </p>"

<div style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;"">TL:DR. I am not interested in your help. 

I am not going to change my business name. I have a website, Facebook page, Google + page, Twitter account, and other online presences currently attached to this name. Further, &quot;Man In A Kilt Massage&quot; does not convey the image I want to show. 
I am working on better signage to increase visibility and make the location easier to find. However, I do not want to give the impression to people that it is okay to just walk up and walk in. That would be the exact opposite of the relaxing environment I am trying to create (and it is enough of a struggle without that additional challenge). </div><div style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;"">For that same reason, and the fact I have nothing useful to offer the Ballard and Fremont Artwalks, to say nothing of the fact that there is very little foot traffic on that part of Leary way NW, I do not see the value in trying to get time with those Artwalks. </div><div style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;"">I do need additional decorative items, it is true. However, I believe it is necessary to add both functional, massage and anatomy related prints as well as decorative. Again, as an LMP, there is a degree of clinical theme to be conveyed. </div><div style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;"">The reason &quot;unusual groups&quot; are unusual is they do not generally seek clinical massage. They especially do not seek it from men. I am abundantly aware of the challenges i face, as a male practitioner. </div><div style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;"">All that said, i have yet to see a single iota of the barest hint of a whisper of a suggestion that you, personally, have the slightest idea of how to even do any of the things you are suggesting. Sending me a postcard that is clearly left over from an art show with handwritten notes does not convey a sense of professionalism or instill confidence.
Asking to be paid in Massages (10 of them), is a nice thought, but I have a pretty good idea who would be getting the better of that deal. </div><div style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;"">So, no. Thanks. I may not be a marketing genius, and bright lady of grace knows I have made my fair share of mistakes, but your services will not be required. </div><div style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;"">-Daiv</div>"

"event","<p>No, seriously. </p><p>I just finished the first draft (final), version three of the Secret Project. Which is not so much &quot;secret&quot; as &quot;not really worth talking about&quot;. It consisted of changing an existing Massage Curriculum from one schedule to another schedule (ie, the original was three six hour days a week, the revised was three eight hour days a week). Now, part of the fun of this project was that there were, as noted, at least three versions of this revised curriculum. The client, who is a wonderful and delightful person (and the person under whom I apprenticed to get my WA state Massage License), had shifting ideas as to what she wanted, largely because she kept getting back new and contradictory information from her current class. 
So, on thing and another, I had to start over again, partway into the project. Twice. 
On the other hand, she is paying me somewhat more than I had originally requested. So, really not complaining about that. </p><p>Still. Just spent most of a beautiful sunny day in front of a computer. I mean, I took a break to eat lunch, which also involved going to the bank to deposit a check for a contract chair massage gig I did a couple weeks ago (woot), and the FLCS to pick up the seventh volume of Chew TPB (Lunchtime Reading!!). </p><p>Hours in front of the computer. I honestly do not know How one does this, all the time. I work on people who do this all the time, of course. It is what keeps me in business. But... you could not pay me enough to do this full time. And if I continue to do this even on a part time basis, regularly, I am going to have to seriously rethink my work set up. Like, either a standing desk (downside? this is also where C and I watch movies), or a kneeling desk (downside? it looks stupid, and i am not sure I can actually comfortably and ergonomically kneel for the required time). 
Still. It is done, at least in draft form. And given that my bike needs severe repair and replacement of Parts, the timing does not suck. Also? It was fun to actually dust off my Instructional Design Black Belt. Been rather a while since I have needed it, so it is nice to know I still have some idea what to do with it.

So. 
I did get stuff done. My old phone is now, officially, my clock and radio. I cleaned and organized. And I did have one client show up, and then leave happy.
But still. Who buys a massage, books a massage, and then does not show up for a massage?

This will lead, among other things, to me teaching at her school. 
This is, quite bluntly, why I went to school for nine fucking years (granted, being a freshman were three of the best years of my life). It certainly was NOT so that I could sit in a cubicle explaining to the 13h person, today, that the reason their loan docs are not printing is that they are illegally pirating our software, and therefore, no, I will not be helping them with that, have a nice day. Or to develop Due Diligence documentation for a free program that comes preinstalled on what may have been the worst computer Ever (eMachines). 
And I just got paid for it. Rather a lot, all things considered. Or maybe it just feels that way, because of other stuff.
Now, all I have to do is Earn It.

"event","<p>So, I am involved in a Dark Heresy game (roleplaying in the 40k universe, great fun). My character is a &quot;Psycker&quot;. Which means he gets to do &quot;I can kill you with my brain&quot; stuff. 
To do so, I roll a d10 and add stuff to beat a specific number. If I roll a 9 on that D10, I get to roll d100 on the &quot;Bad Stuff&quot; table. If I roll 75 or higher, I get to roll on the Very Bad Stuff table. If I roll a 100 on that, my character dies, not passing go nor collecting $200. 
By my calculations, that means that every time i try to use a power, I have a 1 in 2500 chance of dying horribly. 
I like those odds. But, have I miscalculated anything there? 
Oh but wait. As of the latest game, I roll 3d10, and if ANY of those come up 9, I roll on the horrible stuff chart (once for each 9). So, that changes the odds to something like 1 in 800, yes? 

I still like those odds.

"event","<p>Winter solstice is about keeping the light alive, about holding on to what is important (and letting go of what cannot be held...), being thankful and giving to others. Gifting, creating plenty in a time of scarcity. It is about defiance, and acceptance. It is kind of a big deal to me, though I am still figuring it out. 
Summer Solstice. Also a big deal. And one i am having more trouble defining. So, lacking a better idea, i revert to my Greek mythology roots, and refer to Apollo. God of the Sun, obviously, so today is good on Him. Also, poetry, prophecy and healing. </p><p>I wrote haiku.
I did a somewhat in depth Tarot card read (same spread I do for each solstice and equinox; this time, three sword cards and one Wands; I need to make some changes to the path I am on).
I gave four massages. Got one person to return, in a month.

If winter is the time of holding on, and letting go, then summer is the time of gathering together, building and working and accumulating.
Or so it seems to me.

"event","<p>I was in San Diego. I met my new niece (Heather, who was marrying Steve, my oldest nephew and oldest brother&#39;s (Chris) son (Background; I am the youngest of four brothers, all of whom are married and all of whom have kids (whether or not I have kids is the subject of some debate)) which was the reason for the visit). 
I originally did not intend to go; I actually declined the invite, as it was going to be an expensive trip at a financially difficult time. But Steve literally begged me, and I took a better look at my resources (and used Expedia), and was able to make it work. Got to stay at a Worldmark timeshare, because I have an awesome friend. And spent as much time as possible with my family. Decided that Niece in law sounds stupid, so Heather is my niece. She had me wrapped around her little finger when she greeted me as Uncle Daiv. I was on my best behavior, working hard to not be creepy or too over the top. I need not have worried. Steve&#39;s friends from Edinborough (he got his MS in Environmental Sciences, there; Heather lived there with him, and that is where he asked her to marry him) are all young, smart and frankly way over the top. Offending them was less of a concern than keeping up (Heather had to explain to Steve what his Uncle Joe meant by the Facebook Post &quot;I have a unicorn living in my garage&quot;; this made me laugh). 
I saw my parents. Mom had spinal and hip surgery a while ago, and is recovering nicely. Also, huge scar that she is quite happy to show off. Dad&#39;s recent announcement of Not drinking anymore seems to have been premature or at least vastly overstated.
My brother Mike was unable to attend; he teaches, and the school year had not ended for him.
Brother Joe was there, with his sons. I am constantly amazed by how much they have grown and changed. The older, Max, at 13(?) is too cool to smile, much. But I did inform him and his little brother that Tree Climber is a legitimate profession. I felt this was important information. 
Went to the San Diego Zoo. Got to see a Polar bear, lounging on the sand. Jaguars fighting over bones (feeding time). As close to a hippo as I ever expect or want to be (pretty close, actually; just the other side of the glass (I am, legitimately, deeply respectful (and terrified) of Hippos)). 
Once again, saw my potential future in my father&#39;s eyebrow. A path I do not want to go down. 
Chris&#39; best friend, of many years, told me that Chris is proud of me. Given that Chris is 9 years older than I am, and is therefore a somewhat parental ish figure (to say nothing of having saved me from choking to death on a marble, &nbsp;when I was a kid (Heimlich maneuver for the WIN!)) I was a bit overwhelmed. And a bit surprised; after all, I am pretty happy with the way my life is going, but it is, shall we say, a non standard path and career choice. Chris is very much more inclined towards more traditional choices, in many ways. I never thought he was proud of my decision to do massage. I frankly thought he thinks of it is not a real profession, not something real grown ups do. But there you go, sometimes people surprise us. 
Jenny, Steves younger sister. Had not seen her since... 2002? ish? She is at Emory university, now. Working on her Ph D in Medical Anthropology, and apparently, also needs an Masters in Public Health to be taken seriously. I find this incomprehensible, but I will take her at her word. She is pretty amazing. She told horror stories of teaching evolution in Georgia. 
Got to dance traditional Scottish dancing. At my request, a flask was thrown to me (and caught, without trouble). Good scotch. 
Jen likes to dance, ballroom and salsa. I have never seen her before this. But seeing her dance just for fun, seeing her light up, was quite a lot of fun. 
Obviously, still jumbled in thoughts. Getting back to work, getting back to Instructional Design projects. And other stuff.
Glad to be home. </p>"

"event","<p>So, the idea was... transplant the Paranoia RPG into a D&amp;D setting. </p><p>All the Gods have fallen, except Pelor. God of Life, Light and Law, He and his servants are all that remain standing before the terrible dark God. Only Mankind remains, defending the last city against the undead hordes that seek to extinguish the light. 
Or something equally pretentious and or ominous. The upshot of it being, in the last city, it is &quot;known&quot; that only humans remain (every other race has been destroyed by the Dark God and his Minions (Dark God and the Minions is my all Banjolele Apolocalyptica cover band)), and only Lawful Good Clerics are empowered and able to fight the undead hordes that are trying to destroy the city. </p><p>Of course, the party might want to play something OTHER than a LG Human Cleric. Fine. How&#39;s that Bluff Skill? Oh, and every Cleric is issued a &quot;light of Pelor&quot; which is Ioun Stone that with special abilitiies. Of course, you need to make a Use Magic &nbsp;Device check to access those abilities. And that check is more difficult for Non human, not L and/or G, non clerics (of Pelor). Also? Being caught and proven to be anything other than a Human, LG Cleric of Pelor is grounds for immediate execution. This is Paranoia, after all, and what&#39;s the point if you don&#39;t die? And, yah, yah, get resurrected (hope you learned your lesson!). Which is part of the problem. Resurrection does not change a person. Cloning does (in theory, at least, in Paranoia).
Oh. And there is no &quot;Computer&quot;. There is, however, an insanely powerful, LG Human Cleric of Pelor. Who is maybe a little fanatic. And not necessarily very smart. He does, however, bear the Hammer, the Shieild and the Light of Pelor (artifact level Mace, Shield and Ioun Stone, properties to be determined). 
I proposed this idea to my Tuesday night group. It went over like a lead baloon. 

But then it occurred to me, tonight. Why not reverse it? Instead of playing the stalwart defenders of the Last City, why not play the invading hordes? Necromancers, destroyers and corrupters, seeking to extinguish the light. All are welcome in the service of Vecna (the counter to Pelor) (or, rather, a powerful lich who possesses the Hand and the Eye and the Dagger of Vecna (artifact qualities to be determined)). Of course, it is an Evil Horde. So, backstabbing and betrayal are par for the course. The only foreseeable problem is that healing and resurrection spells are the domain of Good clerics and such. Which would be ... inconvenient.</p><p>Hmph. Maybe I should look ... I think there is a &quot;clone&quot; spell, in either 3e or Pathfinder. </p><p></p>"

"event","i think i am offically immune to tylenol pm...
i should be sleepy; i only slept 4 hrs last night...and no naps today.

this morning tim and i saw off jane.&nbsp; it's been a long time.&nbsp; why do all the people i love live so damn far away...?&nbsp; i mean really.&nbsp; this is getting sort of ridiculous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

it was wonderful to have jane for the weekend...i&nbsp;need to remember to&nbsp;be thankful for time spent and not dwell so much on the amount of time spent apart.

okee...so, not immune, per se...just takes a long ass time to kick...i guess.&nbsp; i am now sleepyish and i must make a running dash to the bed before my brain changes it's mind."

so i set out to clean the whole apt...wishful thinking i guess...
but i did make quite a bit of progress...
~i have lost count of how many loads of laundry i have done...and thus how many things i have ironed...
~i super-cleaned the kitchen...even going so far as to put faux metal contact stuff on the counter top...it doesn't want to stick to the left side-edge...but who cares...the rest of it is great. the silver really highlights my amazing coffee maker...right?  i mean, shit...it'll keep the coffee warm for almost 10 hours...with no heat source!  i love it, can you tell...
~i cleaned and organized the teeny tiny bathroom...the one and only bathroom...looks pretty good...minus the severe lack of storage space...
~i made the bed and finally finished and hung the red birdie picture that i have been staring at for over a month now...
~and i took lots and lots of pictures of my kittens...they are still not really getting along...but they also try to stay in different rooms...unfortunatly they run into eachother in passing a lot because they both seem to think that they are, in fact, of the canine species...following their owner blindly all over the house...tail wagging...tongue hanging out...it is very odd to me...i have never owned a cat that really cared what i was doing or which part of the house i was in...i am still adjusting...and trying not to step on any cute furry kittens...

"event","dinner = 1 mountain dew, 1 twix bar, 1 york peppermint patty, a handful of cheese nips, some leftover chicken and broccoli that tasted kinda funny (but i ate it anyway), two rice crispy treats (one regular and one chocolate chunk), and a couple of twizzlers...
what happened to me?!

perhaps after i finish cleaning and putting together my apartment i will decide that cooking is a good thing again.

i used to love to cook...i also used to have someone else to cook for...that is the real issue here...

have you ever tried cooking for one?  i mean, for real, is it really possible?!  answer, no.

i always end up either making way too much and trying to pawn it off on friends and neighbors or having all my vegetables turn to mush in my fridge before i get around to using them...

now just about everything i eat comes out of a can, bag, or the freezer...and i don't think i have cooked on the stove in months...(ever since i purchased a microwave...)

oh well...i will get back on the ball eventually...until then, i will enjoy my dinner of candy and snack foods..."

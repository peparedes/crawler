"event","I love my job down here it just makes me in a better mood. Everyone is so funny and friendly. Van is awesome we can talk for almost my entire shift about anything and we laugh. Mike is funny but he got me back tonight. The other night I threw a snowball at him and he got me back tonight by bringing snow in with him and sticking it to my back and putting it on my chair it was funny. I am going to miss this place when I graduate in a couple years. I love my roommates too they are the greatest and put up with so much from me. They are hard workers too they do their work and get it down. See people who dont do their work and make excuses tick me off. I use to be one in high school but coming to college I do my own work and get it done and do not make excuses if it isn't done. I have taken responsibility for myself and my work. I know people who do not do their work and make shitty and repeated excuses. And the thing that kills me is that the professors let them get a way with it. I can not believe that in 3 days I am no longer going to be a teenager do you know how scary that is. I don't know what I am going to do with myself. The said thing is that one of my roommates is not going to be here but she needs to be with her family. I just wish that I could take away her pain, I know what she is going through and it is hard. I have gone through it a couple times now. We all ask the same questions why and is this really happening. I don't believe it or can i wake up now. I know I should moving on as people tell me but you know what I am not done grieving the death of my father and it is not my fault that some people do not understand that. I will be there for someone if they need me but only if they are there for me in return. I know that doesn't sound right but I have been walked over way too many times to let it keep happening. Well I guess that is enough of my ranting. Back to homework and studying. Yay! I get to go home soon. A week from tomorrow."

"event","I love this time of year but at the same time I hate it so much. One I'm away from home, yes I know I'll be home for Christmas but not for my birthday. I miss my mom so much right now and I miss my daddy. I was doing good I wasn't thinking that much about it and then it happened. My roommate got a call on Saturday and it was her parents calling to tell her that her grandfather had an accident and didn't make it. And then later that afternoon she asked if I had checked my email recently and of course I hadn't. Well the school sent out an email telling that one of the students of Canisius had gotten into a car accident and didn't make it. So in one day I hear of two deaths oh and the girl in the car accident was a friend, not a really really close friend but a friend, and you know what the only thing that kept coming into my mind was that day that I woke up and found my father passed away. It kept replaying in my mind over and over again. I know how my roommate feels that this can't be happening. For the longest time I thought that he was going to come back and it was all a bad nightmare and that everything was going to be fine but in reality it's not and it hurts. I know it's been over a year but he was my daddy and now all the feelings are back and all I want to do is be home in the security of my home. It is all coming out now, I can't hold the tears back anymore and the hurt I don't know when it is going to go away. Everywhere I turn it seems to be dealing with death or people being lonely. I don't want to sound selfish or anything but I just dont want to hear or talk about it. Talking about things is good but you know what I just don't feel like it right now. And I called my mom and all I could do was cry and she told me not to but I miss her so much right now. Well it is time for me to go to class right now."

"event","It's been awhile since I have written in here and right now I need some place to write or say what is going on in my head. Right now I have all these feelings running through me and I don't know what ones to listen too. I also have questions going through my mind, like is everything going to work itself out? should I tell him or no? and I dont have any of the answers to any of the questions. The school had their annual semi formal dance on Friday and I had a blast but it just made me more confused on what to do. All of this would be avoidable if I could just tell a certain someone how I feel but I am scared and being scared is not a good thing. He is a really good friend and I want to get to know him more, he is one that I feel comfortable around and I just enjoy spending time with him. But I have no clue how he feels and Friday night he told me I was confusing and you know what I am and it sucks. I wish that I could just come out and say what is on my mind. Oh wait that wouldnt be such a good idea, okay not everything but a good portion of what is going on to come out. I just dont know what to do and I talked to my friend about what is going on and she told me to tell him before break but I dunno. I just need to overcome my fear and just let it out. Well it is getting late and I am starting to feel tired. Maybe I'll make an entry later on."

"event","It is so hard to believe that today is starting my 4th week here. It seems that all ive been doing is staying in my room and doing homework. Well thats not true except during the weekdays. The weekends have been pretty fun. I have been so busy but yet I seem to have time to think and work is busy cause I cant really think and then all of a sudden im thinking again. For maybe about a week or so, I barely thought about someone and my roommate made a comment cause I've been hanging out with this friend and she was like yeah you havent mentioned you know who in awhile. And they even asked what was going on between this friend and I, and I said he is just a friend nothing more. I get it nothing is going to happen as long as I am here at college, if it does then great. I so cant wait til October 5th when my mom comes to visit and the 7th when I can go home and maybe show Jen my small town. And hopefully see some of my close friends from home. Then I will come back here to Buffalo on the 11th and the cycle will begin.

Toni, sorry for confusing you, but if you need anything at all I am here for you. Your grandma may be gone but as long as you continue to love her, she will be right there with you at all times. Seriously if you need anything at all, dont care time of day or anything just call. Things will get better eventually. Love ya girl."

"event","Well i havent written in awhile so ill fill you in. I am back in Buffalo at Canisius. I have missed home alot these past couple of days. I mean dont get me wrong I love being back here but i just miss people from back home. And with the price of gas going up it is very impossible to go home without spending a lot of money. Which really sucks because I want to see my mom and my friends. Well since i have been back we have goofed off a lot and classes are going good. Lets see what has happened the first weekend back:
~I have had my ass smacked by Paul and he helped himself to my bed.
~I had sex twice in a row with Jill and Pat and then had an orgy with Pat, Jill and Jamie. (Please dont ask, just laugh)
~Seen baby Nathan and Tracy.
~Eaten shitty Chartwells food
~Went to Target and bought a trash can, clock, bean bag chair and an air freshener.
Wow what a weekend. More fun times to come. Jen's birthday is in 11 days. We are going to have a party Saturday night and then take her to breakfast Sunday. Well I think that is it. Will try and write more later."

"event","Well nothing in my personal life has changed much since the last entry. But my brother asked his girlfriend to marry him, so he is engaged, he proposed to her like 2 weeks ago and just told my mom and i two days ago about it but her family was told before us, can you say how rude? Well I decided I needed a new look for school so I permed my hair and I am going to highlight it before going back. People will not recognize, hehehe. Well I go back to good old Canisius College in 15 days. I wish I had more time here at home but at the same time I cant wait to go back and see everyone, Im so confused and cant make up my mind. It makes me want to sit down and just cry, I dont know why. 
Well I am running out of thoughts and am just making myself depressed."

"event","I use to think live journals were crazy, but now I dunno what to think. I just need a way to get my feelings out there and maybe this will help, who knows. It could be fun. I have a feeling that this is going to become like thefacebook and I'll never be off it. Well it is a way for the people I don't talk to all the time to see what is going on. This summer is going by so fast and I want to go back to school. And at the same time I don't want to. There are people here that make life easier and are shoulders for me to cry on and here I am needed by my mom and my friends. 

This past week was really difficult for me. It has been a year since my dad has passed away. All I can say is that losing a parent is the most difficult thing other than losing a child. Thursday, sucked ass so much, I spent $260 to fix the back brakes on my car. Yes, I know it isn't a lot of money to some people but to me it is almost all of my money. Why do things have to be so expensive. Then my mom and I went shopping for the party, we were having on Saturday. So Friday, my mom and I stayed home and did some yard work and relaxed, until my brother disappeared with his girlfriend. My mom and I needed him there with us but I guess guys handle things differently. Well we made it through Friday and then Saturday. I needed Saturday more then anything in the world. We had a small party at my house. Had friends from high school and a couple friends from work. Well Tom came but we couldn't get a hold of Krista. Had fun playing FOOBAR and forty lordy. Drinking games are so much fun. We went to bed around 1 and 2. Then Tom's phone went off at 3 and the dogs started barking at 6 or so. And then between 7:30 and 8, five children running around screaming woke us up, dame them. And then I spent the rest of the weekend chilling and relaxing.

Well that is it for now, more to come later..."

"event","one more day of school, yeah its a bit depressing but than again, good. Its good because i get to start over, from scratch with a new year, and all most of the East people will have on me are what they can judge, yeah hypocritical but still. So thats good, maybe it will be good. &its just great to get away from some people that i loathe. But its horrible to be seperated from my friends. I feel terrible for my brother, he spends his senior year, practically isolated from all the kids he grew up with. yeah but hes a big boy. hes got his gf anyway lol. But whatever, im not going to kill myself with it cause ill still see some of them itleast. But yeah i guess ill miss some of my teachers and stuff. &I know im going to do bad in English next year, my first honors class .. not counting my advanced class ITO. but whatever. I liked being the smart one in my little English class, and now im gonna be the dumb one in my smart English class. pldjgjf. whatever. Ive got my camera all ready for tomorrow, and such. wee this is exciting, one more day. Coolness man, im ready for this. But its so weird, in a way, i cant wait to get to HS. but then i dont want to go? blah i need to make up my mind. I wish Mike knew i liked him..well he does but he doesnt like me so whatever. hes a dumb little boy. hehe :] but hes cute. toodles loves <3

"event","yeah well today was okay, nah strike that. if it wasnt so disgustingly humid it would have been good. Music we had a review for our final but Music is soo boring i cant wait to get out of that  class. In science we got our results back from the final.. i got a 72 yeah its okay i didnt think i did well but i cant work in the heat lol, yeah excuses. wahtever. In history we reviewed for our final which is.. eh tomorrow? Amanda is showing me pictures of some kids dick and im so disgusted with her and how shes talking about wanting to do..""stuff"" with him when i think that is c ompletley unethical. ew, but in the word of timmy..whevs. Spanish final was so easy it was unbelievable, wow so that was good. Math final was a little bit diffucult but im a math-retard so what do you expect. i dont care, i just dont care anymore. The English final was pretty easy, it was vocab/lit terms. most of it was disgustingly easy but there were a few very broad vague sentences that annoyed me because i was unsure blah. wahtever. the lit terms part was kind diffucult but not really. that stupid queer Nick Velez tried to copy off me, he distinctly moved, just to copy off me. How disgusting. But it proves how much of an idiot he is because he was sitting behind Maeghan Dolan who is smarter than me, hah i found it funny.. i gave him a look and he might have stopped but then when i handed in my test he said this sucks. whatever, hes an idiot for this whole fiasco he pulled off over hte summer as a stupid joke, loser. yeah well this is long so toodles.. im probably going to see Timmy later but other than that tonigh will be lame."

I wish all guys were like him because he is the best everrr man lmao. Im hyper cause i just ate dinner? no reason for why im hyper but latley whenever im hyper im always disgusted with myself after. Even tho all i had for dinner was a really small potato i feel full and i want to throw up..itannoys me cause i drank to much water lmao. Okay im hyper. im talking to brianne and i effin love her because she is constantly asking if im okay and i love her because shes better than you weeee lmao i love you brianne NSW of course ;] hehehh. and then stephanie she just amuses me. Stephanie ballarano makes me sad. Katelynn i have to say im a bit annoyed with its confusing, i just dont feel like i can tell her stuff. Like if you were to watch me and Timmy hang out all we do is walk around and basically i talk the whole time and he adds in witty remarks hear and there. If i talk about something like.. well my situation with Thom or soemthing katelynn would just be like ohhh.. see i dont like that. is she my friend or waht? Brianne is showing me pictures of her sexy little man fan club, lmfao as i call it. its funny seeing there pictures online cause of the way Brianne talks about Damien and all the other little men..lmao.in school.

"event","eh im in a pissy mood. I dont feel like doing anything or moving at all. eh its sucky but according to some of my friends i do it to myself. or itleast thats the vibe. Im making to big of a deal out of little things. I need to talk to Timmy. I always run to him with my problems because i honestly see him as my brother. He is always there for me, and i feel disgusted with myself that ive been a bit distant to him latley? iunno. I love that kid so much, hes the only person i could honestly talk to and i know he'd understand. and he never gives me negative advice when im ticked because well, he knows ill kick his ass :) lol. But ive been thinking about it for an hour or so and i just cant believe i ever treated him that way. Whenever i need him, hes there for me. Sure he is my neighboor, 2 houses down but still. I love that kid for everything hes done for him. hes like my effing brother and i take advantage of that. Im disgusting. wow i need a drink. my leg is throbbing again cause i just kicked the keyboard thing, lmfao. toodles."

"event","i felt dead a little bit morethan usual this morning.. just really blechjfgna. i dont like it, only 4 more days of school, i want to be happy about it. Not upset. Well wahtever, this whole thing with Thom..im not sure if its ''blown over'' or wahtever..but, i told Kristie she should go outwith him, they would be cute together. I dont know whats going on but we'll hope that what is right will happen. eh well, ive been feeling a bit excited about going to East but still melancholy about it because im gonna miss them all, so much. And I cant stand the fact of ""oh we'll see eachother this summer"" and we never do, it upsets me. whatever. I just feel empty with knowing that its over and my chance is gone and stuff. Well wahtever i just want some one to love. its not to late, just for him i guess. I downloaded abunch of newsongs on Limewire yesterday so thats a good thing. I did Erikas journal before [/~coheedanderika] yeah but thats about all that is interesting in my life right now. besides the fact that my leg is throbbing because i fell down the stairs and some idiot inschool kicked me where i hurt myself. stupid effer. it effin hurts tho. oh well im done, bye loves."

"event","eh well. that was enough of an intro. this is interesting enough i suppose. well, whatever. school is ending in just five days. its unbelievable i only have to spend 30 more hours in that place. and then off to highschool. freaky, yes. well anyway, today was a eh, i just dont know whats going on with me latley. its weird. i dont like it much. i get obsessive over little things, its freaking me out. well.. im just frustrated with school ending and finals and stuff. The only final i can think/hope i did well on is English. it came easy to me all year and i want to be in honors, i want to stay in honors. I want to be with those who are mature, unlike this year. Most of the kids in our school represent the maturity of a 8 year old. Pathetic, yes. Anyway.. before i pulled the bone in my leg and, wow it hurts. usually i never have pain for more than a day or so, it eventually goes away so i wont worry about it. but the fact i cant move it without feeling pain, does suck. Life has been annoying latley, always screwing me over and im getting tired of it. Itleast i got to know how it feels to actually be rejected by someone whom i really liked. I dont want to be obsessive, i want to be friends, Thom. Thats the end of that. My knee is spazzing out cause of the way im sitting. My leg is feeling better now so that is a plus. woo, well, im glad i did pretty good on my speech. Although the before hand experience was horrible. Almost vomiting in front of 28 of your peers isnt very, well fun i guess. I was so nervous and afraid of doing bad im sure my eyes were tearing. Everyone knew i was nervous and my teacher witnessed it and sensed how i felt so i go to after school and scored a 19/20.. woo. Its hard..because English is a big deal to me. I dont care i can admit that. Im a loser. woo for me. I dont know why i was so nervous, i got a 97/96 on the research paper, and she said my grade was a 96 or higher. We got to talking and Ms. Hampel said that honors english would be good for me and i should go into it. Im just afraid im not gonna do well. But at this point in time i think English and writing is something i want to keep doing. I dont know how my essays will be compared to any of those honors kids and im intimidated already but ill try. Well im done babbling, i cant sit hear my knee is spazzing out again lmao. <b>Toodles Loves</b> <3"

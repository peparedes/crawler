"event","An interesting couple weeks.  Machina practiced and delivered two very good performances, one in Sunbury, PA and one in Boyertown, our home.

The show in Sunbury was great, about fifty kids, and most of them were into what they saw.  All the bands were intense in their own way, from the musical playfulness of the jam-punk band Perennium, to the crushing grind of Within Distance, the chaos of Waterstain Eulogy.  Sometime the atmosphere is just right.  It was that night.

Tonight in Boyertown was, well, Boyertown.  Of course everyone local who knew about the show and said they were going to come didn't, but that's to be expected around here.  There weren't many people at the show but every band turned in an A+ set.  I was surprised by Set Ablaze most of all, I haven't seen them for about a year and a half and they've gotten much better.  Spearing Jocasta surprised me as well, and Heidnik was loud, fast, and absolutely crushing.

I'm sick and that sucks, but Aleve Cold & Sinus is the best medicine EVER invented.  Everybody in my band has a cold except my bassist.  We're taking tomorrow off from practice so we can recover.  I got new heads for all my drums, so Monday the sickness begins- we start honing each song to a sharp point for the recording process.  Studio time begins October 28, and we should be done with the CD by Thanksgiving.  

Close friends will get advance copies.  You know who you are."

"event","Friday, September 5th.

The Sexy Jesus embarked on it's maiden voyage, taking Machina Infernus 2.5 hours from home to Winfield, Pennsylvania.  It was here we played our first real show.  The show we played two weeks ago wasn't really a show, per se.  This was a show, complete with other bands and a crowd.

We opened up, tearing through seven songs.  The kids there didn't leave.  Some even danced a bit.  Nick was drunk, but still, we pulled off an impressive show.  

The feeling I got is...  wow.  We're old.  And not in a bad way, but more like a slow realization that maybe we won't be able to relate to younger crowds who have never really listened to a band like us.  Is that bad or good?  I don't know.  The people there seemed to like us, and were very friendly overall.  It's really awesome to be bringing a style of music that is pretty much new to a scene, and what I hope to do is build a decent following so that when we do play in clubs we don't end up having to jump through the same beginner hoops that other new bands do.  Plus, I never want to stop playing the hall shows, because they're so much fun.  There's 75% less bullshit in hall shows than there is in clubs.  

Sunday, Sept. 7.

We played at The Why're in New Cumberland.  We were supposed to play with Age Of Ruin but they cancelled, and so did Herod.  So it was just us and two other bands, The Alarmed and one other band whose name I forget.  They did a lot of System Of A Down covers.  We played second.  

Before we played, though, the inaugural Machina Infernus BBQ took place.  We fired up the grill and fed everyone, bands and crowd alike.  We collected donations but didn't charge or anything.  It really made for a fun atmosphere.  by the time we went on, everyone was pretty festive.  I knew it was going to be electric.  It's the only way I can describe it.  Everything lined up.  Though there were only 30 or so people there, nobody was sitting down.  Everyone was on their feet and most were far from standing still.  To the left of Kovac's guitar cab stood two guys in awe of his soloing, throwing Slayers up left and right.  In front stood three kids with hair headbaning so hard they probably have whiplash today.  There were hardcore kids and metalheads moshing and even one kid climbing the rafters.  The sound was tight, everything was dead on.  We all must have perspired ten gallons of sweat onto that stage.  It was fucking brutal.  

There was one disappointment.  Nobody from my former band showed up except the drummer who is filling in for me.  Dan Jones is a good guy who has too much integrity to be playing in The Commercials.  I didn't expect to see Tony, but I did hope to see Drew, at least.  Sadly, I guess friendships forged over years living in a van aren't as important to them as they are to me.  I swalloed my hurt and my pride and drove to see them, over an hour's distance, not long after I left the band.  They couldn't drive ten minutes to come see me.  I'm sure there will be excuses given, but whatever.  It doesn't matter because I am now in a band that knows what sincerity and brotherhood is all about.  Any disappointment I felt about them didn't affect my jubilance over the show, it just made it slightly bittersweet.

I drove home on a cloud.  Nothing could touch me.  I savored every minute.  I didn't think I would feel that way again, but now I know that it's not only possible, it's pretty likely.  This is only the beginning.  Just the beginning of a fire that will burn long and bright for a long time to come."

Sometimes a song about being stabbed in the back just has to be played.  It's appropriate.

Anyway...

Machina Infernus is buying The Live Ones' van, a.k.a. the Sexy Jesus.  Today I brought it to my lifting partner's shop, painted the bumpers and took off the LINDSAY ECOWATER on the bug deflector.  Then I put in a partition so the equipment doesn't slide forward.  Gonna fix the headlight tomorrow, Rizzy put in the wrong size when he replaced it and it's not aimed right.  Next is to gear up for inspection.  I might get a new sliding door for it, the one now is rusted and dented pretty bad.  It'ss cost me a mere $40 at Harry's U-Pull It.

Listen to me, I sound like a grease monkey.

I guess I am not really that surprised that my old band is comprised of a bunch of shady, selfish, fuckwad ingrates.  Well, fine.  I'm happy I'm out of that pussified, generic emo hellhole anyway.  I'm more upset about having been such a fool that I didn't even know that Tony was plotting behind my back.  I really hope something horrible happens to that fucker.  Nobody I can think of deserves it more right now.

Off to bed, gym and work tomorrow."

"event","I just found out something tonight that really... well, it fucking hurt.  I don't know how much of it is true, but I get the feeling it is indeed, very true.

I got an IM from Dwyer tonight, just catching up.  I told him I had quit The Commercials a couple months ago, and suggested he try out for them since they still need a full-time replacement.  He said that Tony had asked him already.

In March of 2002.

I was skeptical.  I don't remember any friction with the band at that point.  We had come off a good tour, we weren't fighting, and there was relatively little stress.  The biggest thing was that a couple months prior to this, I had argued with Tony about Tooth & Nail about the gay issue, and how he had fibbed to them and said we were all Christians when if fact, I was and am not.  It didn't matter since we never signed with T&N anyway, even though we still tried to get a contract with them until Summer 2002.

Anyway, I didn't believe this at first.  But then I asked, why would Dwyer say this?  What motivation could he have?  I asked him- tell me exactly what happened, don't leave any detail out.  And he did.

We had played a couple shows with The Bitter Life Typecast around that time, one in Lebanon and one in Sassamansville.  That's how Tony became aware of him.  He's actually a very good drummer.  He told me that a girl named Janelle had approached him at a Hey Mercedes show and gave him Tony's AIM name.  This made what he said true, because Janelle is Drew's ex-girlfriend and a longtime friend of The Commercials.  Dwyer couldn't have pulled that name out of thin air.  When Dwyer talked to Tony, he was offered my spot in the band.  Dwyer declined out of respect for me.  Dwyer- had you accepted, three weeks in a van with Tony would have driven you to quit faster than you knew how to say the words.  I did not know about this until tonight.

So why am I upset?  Because everything since then has been fake.  I thought Tony was a friend of mine.  Even when I left the Commercials last June I made it a point to not be bitter, to not talk shit, to not let things go negative.  I've been down that road before and it leads to nowhere.  I'm happy with Machina Infernus.  But what pisses me off is how he could string me along for over a year and pretend that everything was fine when he really wanted to be rid of me the whole time.  He used me.  He used my creativity and my passion, he used my love for the music knowing full well he was going to replace me at the first opportunity.  I don't know how much complicity the other members have in this, I don't care.  And if they were in on it, that means I will be equally as upset with them and it doesn't diminish the hurt and betrayal I feel because of Tony.  A year and four months, he lied to my face, he made me feel as if we were friends.  I'm a trusting person and he led me along his fucked-up little deception and used me so the band could get a record deal, so the band could have stability enough to put out two albums and get ahead.  Tony Bavaria doesn't have an honest bone in his body.  He doesn't have a soul.  At best he is driven by greed and personal gain, he doesn't give one whit about who he runs over to get what he wants, because he feels it's owed to him.  He says he's so ""dedicated"" that he'll do anything to get ahead in the business.  I guess he is right.  Burning bridges and ruining friendships, lying to the guy at the record label, lying to your friends, being a general shady prick with ethics so low that lawyers and televangelists look upon them with shame...  yeah, you're a real human being.  You're a real winner.  And to think whenever people talked to me and criticized you for being shady, greedy, dishonest, and self-centered, I fucking defended you.  I stood up for you so many goddamned times.  What a fucking fool I am.  What a big fucking dunce I am, because I was suckered in by your fake sincerity, by your sales pitch about how great The Commercials were going to be.  Tony, you wouldn't know what integrity was if it jumped up and bit you on the ass.

You're less than shit, and I hope that people do to you exactly what you did to me, you worthless son of a bitch."

Sure, it's just a car show and BMX expo, there probably won't be anyone there.  But I am nervous nonetheless.  Jeff is so nervous he is currently vomiting as I type.  I am typing to prevent myself from losing my own breakfast.

From the moment I left my house to go to the gym, it seems like everything was working against me to slow me down and rob me of the time I needed to get things done.  Hitting every red light.  Getting stuck behind truck after truck going 15 MPH below the speed limit.  And then at work, people ordering pain in the ass orders that take 5 times as long as a pizza to make, while I have about 12 pizzas to make.  All night.  It was very stressful, it was hard to think, and of course, I had people nagging me with questions left and right.  Leave me alone.

The biggest thing- and I know it seems minor but I swear it pissed me off so bad...

There was a customer who ordered two pizzas.  I put the pizzas in the oven.  They called back and changed their order from a medium to a large pizza.  The person who answered the phone didn't know I had already put the pies in the oven.  I had to call the customer back, and see if it was OK if I just sent an extra slice along instead of wasting a pizza.  But, the customer didn't answer the phone, her daughter did.  She was 3.  And it wasn't her, but her voice ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE.

Who thinks this is cute?  I don't.  It's bad enough these fuckos don't pick up the goddamned phone when it rings, they have to put a toddler on the phone so YOU have to wait until she's done stumbling through a message before you can leave your message and they can decide whether or not you're worth calling back.  Fuck you, fuck your little girl, and I hope your whole family drives off a big fucking cliff.  Nothing annoys me more than parents who put their kids up to doing stupid shit like that.  These are the same kind of parents who, while I am delivering pizza, will send the kid to the door and then get angry at me when I send the kid back because the kid has no concept of tipping, and the adult is only sending the kid to avoid having to give me a tip.  Again, fuck every single one of you like that.  Quit passing the goddamned buck, answer your phone, answer your fucking door, or DON'T call my pizza shop.  I swear one of these days I am going to go on a killing spree and I am only going to target the people who do inconsiderate, annoying things day in and day out."

Now, the door and fender on the same side are green.

Why?

Well, I was etting out of my car Saturday morning- actually, I was stting in my car waiting for a break in traffic so I could get out.  I had my door ajar, but not open.  A pickup truck came by towing a trailer.  The trailer was wide.  The wheel well of the trailer caught the bottom of my door, pulled it out of my hand, and bent it forward.  It didn't rip the door off, but it definitely fucked it up pretty bad.

So, my lifting partner hapened to have a Neon sated to go to the junkyard, and he sold me the fender and door for $56.  I had to take them off the donor car, then take the ruined parts off, and then put the donor parts on.  Having never done that before I can tell you, it sucked. But not as bad as paying $500 for someone else to do it."

"event","I suppose I could take five minutes a day to update my journal, but I always forget.  It's low-priority for me.  Regardless, it's been a month and much has happened.

First, the exercise program.  It's STILL kicking.  I'm comfortable enough to say that it's now a permanent part of my life.  I've lost a total of 40 pounds, and my waist size is down to a 42.  I can now fit into some XL shirts, and wear 2X with no trouble at all.  My old 3X's are huge on me.  I'm getting a nice set of guns on me, and my shoulders are peaking like mad.  Overall strength is still climbing- I'm putting up over 300 pounds on the incline press, deadlifting over 300, and squatting close to 350.  I've learned that building muscle is a lot harder than merely losing fat, but I'm enjoying the challenge.  In four to five more months, I am going to start event training.  What events, you ask?  Strongman events.  Things like the tire flip, sled pull, car and truck pulling, farmer's walks, Conan's wheel, log press, and many more.  I've been amazed by strongman since I saw my first contest on ESPN, and I was psyched to hear that they have local and regional contests all the time.  So, I am looking forward to doing a year or so of intense training and then starting to compete.  By then I should be strong enough and conditioned well enough to hang.

Second, the band.  Machina Infernus has been practicing three times per week.  We've been writing and jamming at an exponential rate.  Our singer is out of jail and is focused and on the ball like never before.  We've finished the songs for the album, which is going to be titled ""Front Porch Armageddon"" and we're slated to record sometime within the next couple months.  We have shows now, our first being this Saturday.  We're also going to buy a van, hopefully within the next week or two.  My drumming is improving because I have to keep pushing myself to play the stuff Kovacs comes up with.  The man is sickening when he picks up his Les Paul.  He just churns out the most badass riffs, and it really challenges me to come up with drumming that fits it like no other.  Jeff is doing great at nailing the rhythm down and hitting harmonies.  Our only weak link is Brian, our bassist...  he's competent enough, but it seems like he doesn't share our enthusiasm.  He is psyched about our songs, but he doesn't really practice his instrument at home, doesn't really write anything new, doesn't tweak what he has written, and personality-wise, he's 19 and knows everything, and you can't tell him otherwise because, well, he's 19 and he knows everything.  Unfortunately, he just has to grow out of it.  I suppose we wouldn't mind his attitude as much if he actually put more effort into his bass playing.  He has the potential to be really, ridiculously good, but he's just on cruise control.  Another thing is, I think he's a little intimidated by us so he doesn't really try to be creative, because he thinks we might reject his ideas.  We seldom reject each other's ideas because me, Jeff, and Rich are like a hive mind when we jam.  Brian may not feel a part of that yet, so I guess I can understand why he's reluctant to play something beyond the basics.  But- nothing ventured, nothing gained.  We spent a lot of time rejecting and rewriting things, even entire songs.  We are our own worst critics.  So, he's just going to have to set his pride aside and jump in head-first or he will never be the full part of the band that he wants to be.  Having a part rejected isn't the end of the world, it means you try again 'till you get it.  But- for all of this said, Brian is not a bad guy.  He is a good bassist with great personality, and any flaws he may have are not really his fault, he's just young and used to being the leader among his friends, and in Machina, there is no heirarchy.  It's all or none.

Work.  Well, that is still work.  It's a pizza place.

Play.  I've been going to more shows, especially since Olympic Records has been having them.  It's a really cool store and I'm proud of Richard & Travis for making that happen.

Well, that's it.  Been too long, I'll try to get in here at least once per week."

"event","I think I've been in something like seventeen bands.  Let me see if I can remember them all.

Entity, my frist ""band"", wasn't really a band, we never practiced or anything.  In fact, it was before I even started playing drums.  I was 15 years old and envious of a friend who could play anything from Metallica's ...And Justice For All album on guitar.  I lied and said I could play drums, and he suggested we start a band.  Amazing, my whole musical career was kicked off because I told a lie.

Entity never got off the ground, though I did jam with thay guitar player (Sean) for a while.  My first actual band was Victims Of Circumstance.  I don't know what we were trying to do, musically.  We had some originals and then we covered songs by Rush and Hall & Oates (old stoner rock songs, before they got all radio friendly).  We practiced in my basement for a year and then played one show.  I quit to join a metal band with Sean.  Since my playing went from virtually nothing to being able to keep a rhythm pretty well, it worked out.  We were originally called Turmoil (not the HC band from Philly).  We later changed the name to Psychotrauma.  We were definitely a thrash band.  This lasted 9 months or so, then we broke apart.  Sean didn't get along with the other guitarist, I had my drum set repo'd, and it was just bad.

I hooked up with this band closer to home and we dubbed ourselves Bad Poetry.  This was in 1991/92, and alt-rock was at the height of it's pretentiousness.  We went to a show and saw some kid reading poetry.  My bassist heckled him, and the poet leapt offstage and choked him.  My bass player was smiling the whole time.  After a few months we changed the name to Squash and rocked on for the better part of 2 years.  We enjoyed a good amount of success locally, but it fell apart when the guitarist discovered Phish, and, well...  let's just say his next band was called ""Mr. Hummingwell and the Wonderful Opium Eater Band"".  

Sean came calling again, and we started a new band.  We went nameless for a bit, but settled on Crawldeezel.  I know, I have a history of being in bands with bad names.  We lasted only a short time until Sean moved to Florida with his girlfriend.  I haven't talked to Sean much since then, but I do miss him.  If not for him I never would have started playing drums.

I found myself on the outs with no band.  First I attempted to start a punk band called Floppycocks.  That lasted one practice.  Then I joined this metal/hardcore band called Savalas Youth.  It was kind of in the vein of S.O.D., but our songs were either about Telly Savalas or home safety and such.  We had a song about fire safety called ""Stop, Drop, and Roll"".  A song about the evils of sugar called ""White Granulated Lie"".  A song about why you should always wear your seatbelt.  I forget the name of that one.  It was a hoot, but after six weeks I got called up for another gig.

The name of the band was doug, and I had wanted in for weeks.  Finally I got my chance.  If you combined Green Day and Hum, that's kind of what we sounded like.  We really had a chance to go somewhere with it, but as usual, we made all the bad mistakes.  Lineup changes plagued us.  First we lost our lead guitarist, then we played as a three-piece.  Then we got a replacement but he was not a good player, so we booted him.  We argued a lot about what direction to go in.  We started out pop-punk and gradually shifted towards emo, I wanted to stay fast and punk  We flim-flammed quite a bit, always going back and forth.  Meanwhile, I got back together on the side with the first lead guitarist we booted and helped him write songs.  That band was $3 Depth Charge.  Nothing permanent there.

doug broke up, reformed, and broke up again.  In between I started playing guitar for a band called Some Big Bowl of Somethin'.  Playing guitar was fun.  doug reformed as Down For The Count, a sad attempt to play H2O-like hardcore that led to us deciding to reform doug and just be ourselves.  We rocked on like this before we decided to change things up:  the bassist moved to guitar and we got a new bass player.  We re-named the band Blowpop and played blisteringly fast punk a la Propagandhi and Lagwagon.  This lasted 7 months.  I was kicked out and lied to about it in the process.

Angry as hell, I formed another band called Rotzkinder.  We were a three-piece punk/ska/hardcore band.  Our bassist, however, had a commitment to another band and had to quit.  She was impossible to replace, though we tried.

I joined a hardcore band called Smackdown on guitar, but soon moved back to drums.  This band saw me put out my first CD.  After 9 months, though, I decided to move from CT to PA.

This is where I met The Commercials.  They needed a drummer to tour with them.  I had no place to live.  A perfect match.  I did the tour.  When I came home a few weeks later I had a place to stay and I got a job.  I didn't play drums for a while, though.  I did buy a set in December of 1998.  In January, the guys from doug got ahold of me and wanted me to join their new band, Small Town Hero.  Though I had reservations, I did.  It only lasted 5 months, though.  I moved back to PA.

When I came back, I started Hate Burns Cold, originally called Born Dead.  I did some fill in gigs for The Commercials here and there.  HBC lasted almost a year before falling apart, and then I joined The Commercials full-time in late 2000.

Now it's mid-2003 and I am no longer in The Commercials.

I talked to those guys yesterday, and we buried the animosity.  I was sad, because you don't spend three years living in a van with people and not miss them when it's time to say goodbye.  But, I am also happy that we finalized the parting with no bitterness and no hard feelings.  I was angry for about a week, but it's healthy to feel that way and then let it go.  we ended it on hugs and handshakes, and sincere wishes for the best all around.  

Now I have Machina Infernus, and may God help all who stand in our way.  I know what to do and what not to do now, after 15 years in this biz, I should.  And I know that nothing is going to stop this band.

So, I just want to thank:

Entity, Victims of Circumstance, Turmoil/Psychotrauma, Bad Poetry/Squash, Crawldeezel, Floppycocks, Savalas Youth, doug, $3 Depth Charge, Some Big Bowl Of Somethin', Down For The Count, Blowpop, Rotzkinder, Smackdown, Small Town Hero, Born Dead/Hate Burns Cold, and The Commercials.  You all made me what I am today, and I'm grateful for it."

"event","I just quit my band.

I got an e-mail from them in response to one I sent to Tony.  In my initial letter I said I needed some extra time off to make up some back bills and get ready for the other tours in July and August.  I requested that one show, which was 8 hours away, be cancelled, because it really wouldn't even be worth the trip to miss 2 days of work and play for 8 kids.

Well, I got this e-mail back that told me I should take the whole summer off, that called into question my dedication and willingness to sacrifice for the band, and that said I had to decide if this band was where I wanted to be.  And the funny thing is, up until I read that letter, it was.  

At first I called our label guy, and then sent back a couple e-mails addressing the points made, but then I started thinking.  They don't want me in the band, they want to change the sound and style, and I am the one who cannot adapt.  They want to play mellow music, and I'm not good at that.  So, I sent them a final e-mail which was pretty much my resignation.  I can't believe they did this to me, but it happens to guys in bands every day, so why not me?  I had a good run.  And I went out with my head held high, instead of playing their game of taking the summer off and coming back to find out that I'm not wanted anyway.

If I drank, I'd be drunk right now.  So if you guys do drink, toss one back for me."

Saturday was great, a day off, a chance to rest from tour, a chance to go and hit the gym after being away for a week.  Though I did work out on the road, it's always nice to get back to your solid routeen.  

But Sunday kicked my ass.  I don't know what I did to deserve this.

I drive to Tony's house.  Our show is in DC today.  We drive down and arrive around 2:15.  The show is a matinee at this bar called the U-turn.  It's supposed to be with a bumnch of synth-punk bands and the Daycare Swindlers are supposed to headline.  After parking a block away we check on the club to find it locked up.  Nobody is there except us and Zolof.  This looks really fucking bad.  This club is in the ghetto too.  Lots of homeless people and crackheads asking for change, smiling at me with a mouth full of broken and decayed teeth.  The sidewalks are dirty.  They're covered in a layer of ash from discarded cigarettes, littered with trash.  We decide to go to Subway, across the street.  It's clean in there.  We have some lunch and head back over.  The promoter is there, he says we're just waiting on the owner to open up the place.  

I ask the guy what time the show begins.  We were told it began at 2:30.  He says it will start around 4.  Since we're there now, we can have the first two slots.  Sounds good to me, because I'm already starting to get aggravated at this weak show and I just want to be done with it.  A few minutes later I find out that the Daycare Swindlers aren't coming.  That lowers the attendance by 4 people who came to see them.  This place is small as hell, 30 people would pack the house.  I think 20 showed up.  Then the promoter tells me that if we want to get paid we have to wait till the end of the show.  I ask if there's any way around this, because I had to work the next day, and he said no, but not to worry because all the bands are playing short sets.  

Zolof opened, we followed.  Afterwards, I hung outside for a while.  A half hour later I realize I hear no music.  The band hasn't even started.  Then, when they finally get to it they play FOREVER.  This continues to be the theme of the evening.  Half hour setups, 45 minute sets.  During this time I explore the surrounding streets.  I do anything I can to avoid going insane.  It's not worth staying for the paltry sum we're going to get.  I just want to get home.  Tony wants to stay.  We didn't get out of there until 9:30.  We got paid $30.

Of course, we hit traffic on the way out.  There were two lanes of highway on 270 for no reason whatsoever, forcing heavy three lane traffic into a 2 mile game of merge and get pissed at the assholes cutting in front of you.  It's 11:30 by the time we get to Tony's.  I leave and stop at the Turkey Hill for a quick bite.  I pull out of the parking lot and go to head home and I get pulled over.  I made an illegal left.  I am super cooperative with the policeman, I admit my mistake and hope for some mercy.  I receive none.  $104 fine.  Can't fight it because I'd have to drive to Harrisburg to do it, plus he recorded our conversation and I admitted I made the illegal turn in hopes that he wouldn't be a dick about it.  Guess I was wrong.  

I drove home with my blood boiling in my veins.  I was so pissed at that cop.  I hope that someday he has a really shitty day, and because of it, he isn't thinking clearly and he makes a mistake, and someone shows him the same amount of leniency as he showed me.  Then my anger turned on my band.  I fucking hate this band.  I fucking hate this tour.  On the way home I expressed my concerns and Tony told me to quit if I didn't like it.  I almost took him up on the offer.  Then I got mad at myself.  How could I be such a fucking idiot?  Why didn't I just go out the other way at the store?  Why didn't I just come straight home and eat when I got here?  I really wanted to drive into a tree, not to commit suicide, but just to hear something smash.  I hate feeling so fucking powerless.  I can't fucking win on the tour, can't have a show where we do well, can't get the cop that decides to give me a warning instead of a ticket, this fucking sucks.

But then I thought about the human trainwrecks I saw walking the streets of DC and I thought, man... I really shouldn't be complaining so much.  $104 isn't a lot of money, and the shows will get better.  If I quit now someone else will sit behind the kit and enjoy the fruit of all my hard work.  I'm still not happy about the situation I endured yesterday, but when I put it into perspective, my problems seem kind of small compared to the lady who sleeps in a box in an alley two feet from where she shits behind a dumpster, who has to beg for change just to buy booze because it's the only thing that helps her forget the tragedy that is her life.  I really should stop fucking complaining."

"event","So I am sitting here in North Carolina wondering just what it takes to do this.  I've been playing in bands half my life and I really love it.  I believe it was something I was meant to do.  Still, when tours end up like this, it's very demoralizing.  I didn't care about playing tonight.  I hate it when I feel that way.  I just went through the motions, played a bland set, and hoped we would soon be on our way back to PA.

Still, I don't feel bad about tour sucking.  I don't know why, because usually I am panicky and pissed.  Maybe it's because I did a better job of watching my money and I didn't spend it all.  Maybe it's because I've been regulating my diet better so hunger doesn't fuck with my head.  The exercise helps me channel my aggression.  But I just think it's because I never expected this tour to be great, so I had no hopes to be dashed.

We definitely have to have a meeting with our booking agent because this cannot happen again.  We can't go out to these clubs a thousand miles from home, play to three or four barflies, leave with no money and expect to remain a band very long.  Where was the promotion?  Why weren't the promoters who booked the shows responsible enough to even show up?  Where was the contracts we were supposed to have signed for each show?  I'm not so much blaming our agent, but it's his job not just to book the shows but to verify that they're being promoted.  

Bill @ Blackout is right.  He told us we shouldn't go out there and fall on our swords like this.  It's band suicide.  And just because we're not at each other's throats this time doesn't mean we won't- maybe it means we're just not passionate enough to even bother to be.  

Enough whining.  The PA/DC/MD shows should be better, but I am only holding out for Pottstown.  Hopefully that will be decent."

I went to the beach yesterday with Zolof and had a blast.  We went into the ocean.  It was beautiful.  Water so clear, huge rolling waves...  Me throwing TJ 10 feet into the air...  Yeah, it was good times.  

Aside of that it's been pretty ho-hum.  The workout and diet is still intact, although it's tough to get in +300 grams of protein and under 150g carbs worked in... but I get close enough and the exercise is increased, actually.

So, we played at this place called The Void, it's pretty f'n punk rock.  Lots of stickers and couches that look like bums slept on them.  No tp in the bathrooms.  Pretty run down.  But, the stage is nice and it's a big room.  Q and Not U are playing there in a couple weeks.

As usual, we don't even get to deal with the person who runs the club, he is out of town, so we get some other duder who works there.  And it's cool, I guess, but it sends up a flag in my mind, like we're just pawned off onto someone else.  My suspicions were right, the local bands didn't bother to promote, and it doesn't look like the venue did anything other than hang up the posters.  What a drag, a huge room and less than 30 people.

I guess it was for the best since Andy's throat is really fucked.  He is getting over a cold, so Tom sang the songs last night.  We only played 4 songs.  After the show we all went to some gay bar that was playing 80's goth tunes.  Then we went to Tony's girlfriend's house to sleep.

I bought the new Metallica CD today.  Call it morbid curiosity.  I can't really make a full judgment yet, but it's not awful.  It's not necessarily good...  it's like...  you know when someone has the world in their hands, someone has infinite talent, and they make a series of bad decisions?  Like Darryl Strawberry.  Now, granted, if they released him from jail and he stayed clean he would still be an awesome baseball player, but he will be forever scarred and altered due to his drug abuse... well, that's what the new Metallica is like.  You can hear the great, heavy songs wanting to be more, but the damage from 12 years of sucking has taken it's toll and the road back will not be easy.

We practiced tonight, wrote a new song.  At first I didn't like it.  Sounded too much like the Goo Goo Dolls.

Yes, I am still lifting and training, and observing my eating guidelines.  It's to the point now where I don't have to write everything down, I can eat on instinct.  My strength is improving and I'm seeing differences in the mirror.

The Commercials have finally released the CD, it came out May 20.  Independent record stores should have it, if not, you can order it from any store that buys from Lumberjack.

Strike Anywhere played our CD release show.  They were, as always, amazing.

Oh, and some schmuck who didn't have his turn signal on got rear-bumped by me yesterday too.  The road was wet, so even as slow as I was going, the brakes locked and I tapped his bumper.  He went to the hospital complaining of a sore neck.  Thanks, asshole, make my insurance go up why don't you?  I wasn't even going 5 mph when I ""hit"" him.  There isn't a dent on my car, and a very small dent on his.  In fact, the dent he had is up on the trunk lid, and I don't see how me tapping his bumper caused a dent in his trunk lid.  I smell something fishy here, and I don't like it.  I sincerely hope the guy is OK but if he is trying to get one over on me, he will not be happy with the end result.

"event","Three weeks ago, I had a revelation.  And I shared some of it with you.  I said I was going to be in pain.  And I was.  I told Rich and Travis about it, the whole scoop, but even they aren't fully aware of what I am doing to myself.  But let me start at the beginning.

There were three signs leading up to the revelation, and a couple interesting coincidences.

On my last tour I decided to quit caffeine.  I had grown sick of how the drug affected me.  I couldn't sleep through the night, I got horrible withdrawal headaches when I forgot to drink something containing it, and it was causing me to piss every 15 minutes.  My blood pressure was elevated, and I thought to myself that the tour would be a great opportunity for me to lose this albatross for good.  And so I did.  And it was hard, but I stayed with it.  This gave me the boost I needed because not only had I eliminated a vice from my life by sheer force of will, it also told me that I wasn't a slave to my impulses and that I can make changes and even adjust and be comfortable with them, given time.

Revelation 1.  Meeting Jim, an ex-WWF wrestler in the lobby of Akin's Auto was pure coincidence.  Here was this guy who stood six-four and weighed a good 320.  He was 39 years old but looked not a day over 30.  His arms were larger than most people's legs.  This was one big, strong dude.  I was attracted to him, not sexually, but out of sheer respect for his physique and size.  We talked about wrestling for a bit, and then lifting.  I mentioned my previous aborted attempts at getting in shape, and he said that he would like a steady lifting partner.  At first I was kind of scared.  I knew I wasn't strong, not at all.  Sure, I'm big, but I haven't lifted in years.  He told me to come by his shop on Monday and we could talk some more.

Revelation 2.  The show was later that night.  The opening band had played and they were having an arm wrestling challenge for free CD's.  I decided to give it a shot, hoping my looks alone would intimidate the skinny kid across the table and thus, reinforce my inflated ego.  He accepted my challenge and beat me.  Right and left handed.  Easily.  I made it seem like I let him win, but he kicked my ass.  I was so ashamed it threw me off kilter the whole evening.

I met up with Jim a few days later and he told me about dieting properly.  He said if I hoped to see any progress from working out that I had to eat certain things and avoid or eliminate others completely.  I was like, great, here comes the twigs and berries diet.  To my surprise, he gave me a diet outline that was totally liveable, so I decided right then and there to start it.  Then he said we would go to the gym the following morning.

Revelation 3.  I had been to gyms before.  I have had trainers before.  This was unlike anything I had ever experienced.  I started off with cardio and I barely got through it.  It was only ten minutes on a walker, what the hell was up with that?  When I was finished, I went on to some weight machines.  This is where I got my whole world turned around.  I got sick.  I went to the bathroom once, collected myself, and went back out.  But soon I was feeling sick again.  This time, I lost my breakfast.  I threw up in the gym toilet.  Not only was I mortified, I was angry at myself for allowing my body to get so far gone.  I couldn't even do a mild workout without hurling.  This was rock bottom for me, and I needed it.  I needed to have my ego destroyed, my pretenses shattered, and every illusion I had crafted had to be swept away by this one piercing truth.  This was me, hugging a ceramic bowl with my vomit floating in it.  Is that healthy?  Is that attractive?  Is that a sign of strength?  I had to say no.  And whose fault was it?  I had to answer, it was mine.  And what will you do now?  Quit?  Go home and put this out of your mind and give people some lame fucking excuse as to why you can't do this, or are you, for once in your life, going to take the harder road?  And that is where my anger served me well for the first time in my life.  My anger at being so out of shape, my anger at embarrassing myself, that is what made me pick myself up off of that tile floor, clean myself up, and go back out there and finish my workout.  And I finished it.  

The next few days were hell.  My legs were so knackered from doing squats that I couldn't even walk up and down the stairs.  Again, my anger pushed me to endure the pain.  I walked to and from work despite feeling every step as a stab in my legs.  Not only did I keep going to the gym, I started keeping track of everything I ate and drank.  I started looking up resources on the web for weight training and strongman events.  It helps to have goals.  I have them now.  I never cared about them before this.  Now that my body is over the shock of a cold-turkey diet change and a sudden shift from a sedentary to an active lifestyle, I can begin to pack on the muscle and infuse myself with strength, conditioning, and yes, health, like I have never known before.  

Now you know why I never mentioned it before.  I was afraid I would last a few days, maybe a week, and then quit like I have in the past, and just laugh it off like it doesn't matter.  But right now it matters to me more than anything else in my life, including my band and my relationship.  It is everything to me, and I've taken my body for granted for far too long.

I am just at a complete loss.  Oh, he says he will still support my decisions no matter what, but my parents said the same thing when I decided not to go to college.  Now the man I love, the one I've spent almost seven years of my life with, doesn't believe in what I am doing with The Commercials.

Of course he wants me to join Machina Infernus full time.  I guess that would make everything OK.  While he spent his 20's giving up his dream of playing in a rock band, I scratched and clawed for every show, any chance to be on stage.  Now, with Machina, he has his confidence back again, but he doesn't realize that confidence won't get a record deal landed.  Confidence doesn't get us shows.  Confidence doesn't get us reliable band members.  There's so much work for Machina to do, that I can't possibly quit The Commercials now just to begin from scratch with Machina.  If I were 25 years old.... sure, why not?  But now, when our CD is about to come out, when things might start happening, to have this laid on me, it hurts.  It really does, and I am so disappointed in Jeff right now.  

I can't fault him for being honest, he doesn't like the music.  I've known that for a long time.  But to say that he doesn't think we can make it... 

I don't know what to think anymore.  And I am tired of having people around me who will always believe that I will fail."

"event","I should be feeling heavenly today, but I don't.  I should feel optimistic as hell, but I don't.  I feel stressed out and tired.  

I've been playing in bands for 14 years, almost half of my life.  Last night, we opened a killer show in State College, PA.  We played with Mae, Hidden In Plain View, and The Starting Line.  It was an awesome show, and all the bands were good live, especially Mae.  Wow.  They were amazing.

I don't want to come off like I am talking shit on anyone because I am not.  I know all those bands worked hard to get where they are.  And I am not bitter about opening the show, because we played to a packed house who really dug our set.  If we played shows like that all the time I would be happy.

What I am stressed out about is the fact that all these promises and talking have been done, and I am not seeing anything come of it.  I get told to wait, it will happen, blah blah blah, but it seems to happen so much faster to everyone else except my band.  The Starting Line is a prime example.  Two years ago they opened for us- that was a good show too.  Now, they're huge and we're still struggling.  So we have a record contract.  Big deal.  That only means I am further in debt to a label now, not just to the bill collectors.  I don't make any money in this band.  Nothing.  The only thing I get is $10 for gas when I have to drive two hours to practice or meet the band for a show.  That's it.  And I am sick of it.  I'm 30 years old.  I am watching people ten years younger than me who haven't even been playing their instruments for three years get these sweet record deals, and the envy turns my blood a boiling green.  And I think, what the fuck?  We're not a terrible band.  I think we're a pretty good band, much more interesting than the dozens of cookie cutter facsimiles floating around out there.  What are we not doing right?  Why aren't we at least pulling down $500 a show?  If I could take home a hundred bucks from a show you wouldn't hear me complain, no way.  But to work for so long, two and a half years in this band, and still not take home a penny in profit, it really puts the damper on things for me.

And why?  Because I have sacrificed so much.  I work in a dead end job where I don't make a lot of money because it's the only job that will give me time off to tour and let me come back when I return.  Tony tells me to get a second job, which I just don't have time for.  I can barely make ends meet.  If I didn't have Jeff as a safety net I'd be completely fucked.  And I am just wondering, when is it going to happen?  When will it be our time to shine?  Or has it just passed us by and we don't know it yet?

I know, we have the record coming out next month, but I am plagued with doubts and lacking in motivation.  I don't seem to care about this band anymore, because I don't feel cared for.  It's not like I don't want to care, I do.  But it's so hard when I feel that the joy of playing music just doesn't balance out the fact that it's costing me so much money just to do it.

I love what I do, but I can't pay my bills with love.  I can't fix my car with love.  I need to see some results.  And yeah, I am a little bitter that other people are living my dreams without even trying while I struggle like hell just to make a glimpse of my dream a reality.  I fucking hate it.  Where do I sell out?  Because I am tired of waiting."

Now I know I am being vague, and there's a reason for it.  Because I know how I am.  I have a big mouth.

The show with Koufax tonight was so/so.  I mean, it's a Wednesday night, and Koufax, while on Vagrant, aren't really huge.  About 50 kids or so on a Wednesday is totally acceptable, and if I were on tour and I had 50 kids to play to on a Wednesday I'd be more than satisfied.  I wore earplugs today while playing for the first time in years.  I think it made me play harder, and I could hear my drums really well so my playing was also more accurate.  They weren't drowned out by the guitars.  Plus, my ears weren't ringing after the set, so hey, earplugs for me.

Considering the exertion I endured today, being able to smack out six tunes at high impact & velocity and not fuck up was pretty damned cool.

Well, I am off to bed.

Got some new CD's, here's some short reviews:

Strapping Young Lad- Self titled.  Surrealistically brutal.  Very original and chaotic, but it all ties in together nicely.

The Haunted- One Kill Wonder.  Insane and heavy.  Much better than their last CD and that one was good.

Cave In- Antenna.  I like this a lot.  Very atmospheric rock, but you can still trace back some of the guitar patterns to when they were a metal band.  Nicely done.

Black Label Society- The Blessed Hellride.  Ozzy's guitarist Zakk Wylde's band serves up a nice slice of rock & roll with a slight blues and whiskey flavor.  Might take me some getting used to because it's not as bluesy as I would like.

Old Man's Child- In Defiance Of Existence.  Black metal with a nice thrash influence.  A little keyboard heavy at times but not symphonic like Dimmu Borgir or Cradle Of Filth.  The drumming by Nicholas Barker is truly something to behold.

That's it for me.  Time to play Zelda."

I got out of work early and picked up Travis and Ryan, and drove to Eastern College near Radnor, PA.  I was going for three reasons:  mewithoutyou, distro, and A Love For Enemies.  We got there around 6:30, and we had to park so far away from the building.  We carried the distro about 1/3 mile over some jogging trail.  Guess they didn't want people taking up the residential parking.  The girl at the show Xed our hands so we got in for free.  Awesome.  I set up the table and sold three used CD's right off the bat.  One was half of a Tooth & Nail anniversary set that I had found in a pawn shop, the other was a Strongarm CD, and the last was Bolt Thrower.  All to the same guy.  First band goes on... young kids.  Don't remember their name.  Not very good.  Upper middle class 15 year olds preaching about abortion.  And who, exactly are they preaching to?  People who agree with them.  Looking down their noses at people who aren't there to offer a rebuttal.  I'd like to see them try that method of preaching to a group of poor, inner city women.  Hey, I don't have an opinion one way or another about abortion, but I'm sick of people who have no freggin' clue about it other than what they read in a Rock For Life pamphlet telling other people what to think about it.  But, they were 15, and just a little too eager.  Next band sounded promising but man, the singer couldn't stay in key.  Musically it was not bad at all, much better than the first band.  A Love For Enemies was next, during the break I sold 2 more CD's.  ALFE was very good.  I had heard an old mp3 and I was lukewarm, but they really blew up the joint.  And they were all very nice guys.  Break, sold one more CD, last of the night, and then mewithoutyou went on.  The vocal PA wasn't loud enough so the crowd did the job for Aaron.  They played really well, going through some songs off of their CD and then a couple new tunes which were very good.  I'll be honest, I don't like a lot of newer bands, and I didn't like this band when I first heard them, but after spending 10 days on the road with them through Canada last Summer, there is a bond between me and those guys which I hope never erodes.  While my band was busy tearing itself to shreds, they seemed to be the model of taking things in stride.  Their enthusiasm for what they were doing, the way they got into the music, the spirituality that flows through them when they play, it all connected with me on that tour.  Even though it seemed to rain shit on us as far as turnout, or being able to even get to the next gig, it was mewithoutyou who helped me keep my sanity.  When I say I love those guys, I really mean to emphasize the ""love"" part of it.  I've hardly ever met such genuine people in my life.  After their set, we were treated to a three song set by The Operation, which was a band that Aaron and his brother were in with a few other people prior to MWY.  They too joined us on our jaunt across Canada, and hearing those songs again brought back memories of Winnipeg, Thunder Bay, Edmonton, and Lussier Hot Springs...  I will live there in my dreams tonight.

A couple things to close out, I know this has been long, so bear with me.

1.  Distro needs more of a Christian selection.  Why?  It will sell.  And sell well.  I'm so on it.

2.  There was one kid at the show with a white shirt on with some witty anti-Evolution slogan written on it in black marker.  I pose the same thought to him as I did the band who sang about abortion:  Just who are you preaching to?  You want to be brave wear that shirt at Johns Hopkins or some other college with a kicking biology department.  Preaching to the choir is just so self serving, like you need the ego boost of a dozen nodding heads, that constant pat on the back to make you feel like one of the crowd.  

3.  Did I mention how good A Love For Enemies is?  Well I am doing it again."

Relationships suck.  If you feel the urge to commit yourself to one person forever and ever, please do yourself a favor and run.  Run far and away from everyone on this planet, because relationships are just one big compromise, wehre each person gives up what makes them happy so you can co-exist in a state of misery.  It's not worth it, people.  Friendship is great.  Sex is great.  Once you start the ""R"" word, you're done.  You've gone too far.  It's taken me six years to realize this.  I'm telling you all now.

"event","So I got to the bottom of the mysterious message on my answering machine.  That was Nick, the ex-singer of Machina Infernus.  See, he is an ex-member because he would rather do piles of drugs and screw psychotic underage runaway girls than, oh, practice, write lyrics, you know, stuff people in bands do?  While I thought his whole hesher white-trash thing was funny, it got old really fast because he couldn't ever just focus on the band, not even for the one day a week where we practiced.  It all started after the March 1st Lamb Of God show.  The night before, he was supposed to get together with Rich, Jeff, and Bryan to work on lyrics.  He called in sick.  He was lying, said that he wasn't feeling good, but he was nailing some girl.  Now, the practice wasn't really that crucial, he could have told the truth and we would have been like, cool.  But that he lied really pissed off Rich.  So at the LoG show, I saw Nick and he assured me he was coming to practice.  Monday came around and he called me, said he had a ride and I didn't need to bring him.  And he didn't show up.  We tried for a week to get ahold of him to no avail.  We didn't know if he was alive or dead.  This is a guy who will take a bottle full of painkillers and wash them down with beer and whiskey and somehow stay alive, but you never know with Nick.  He really is that self-destructive.  So we decided to try out new singers.  So far, none have really made the cut.  Anyway, the caller on the phone was Nick and he was really drunk and fucked up.  He went to a show and got beat down by the bouncers and thrown out.  I guess he knew one of them and tried to call him, but he dialed our number by mistake and hence, the message.

Work is interesting when you have sleep deprivation.  Everything seemed to exist in a white haze, like some bleached-out film sequence that is painful to the eyes.  Fortunately we weren't too busy today.  Travis stopped by to drop me off a Lumberjack sampler that had a Commercials song on it.  He got it at Macrock.  That was swell of him.  It was nice playing it in Carmelo's and watching the wiggers squirm.  I found out that the cops were looking for me last night because some dude got knocked out in front of the shop and they described the assailant as a ""big guy with tattoos and a shaved head"".  Some little kid also got hit by a car out front.  I swear every time I leave all the exciting shit happens.

I decided today that I no longer give a shit about my job.  This is a dangerous thing for me since I don't live with my parents and have nothing to fall back on if I get fired, but fuck if I am going to do everyone else's job and not get paid what I am worth.  Today, the one driver on had three things on a list to do.  Does he do any of them?  No.  He bribes his friend with free slices to fold boxes.  Now, I have no problem with this, but the fucking kid can't even take 3 minutes and fill the soda cooler.  He leaves it for me to do.  And if it were once in a while then I wouldn't mind but this shit happens every goddamned night and I am tired of taking up the slack.  Why?  Because I will get shit for not doing someone else's job, but I never get the love or even a ""thank you"" when I go that extra mile.  So fuck it.  That and I am long overdue for a raise and I'm officially protesting my lack of compensation by just doing what I need to do to get by and nothing else.  If I didn't need this job (because it gives me the time I need to tour and lets me come back) then I'd have quit a long time ago."

"event","What a day.

8:30 in the morning and my alarm is going off.  I went to bed at 4.  This is gonna suck.  I dragged myself from the bed and weakly shuffled into the shower.  After 15 minutes of letting the hot water penetrate my tired, stiff muscles, I shaved and washed up, and got dressed for my court appearance.

The whole way to the courthouse I was going over my defense.  I really couldn't prove that I wasn't speeding.  I didn't think the judge was going to buy my reasoning, and more than that, didn't think he would be happy that I put off the hearing for over a year.

I wasn't dressed all snazzy but I did wear a button down shirt and a jacket.  It was an attempt to look somewhat presentable.  First thing I noticed when I arrived is that the police station is right across from the courthouse.  Not a good sign.  I walked in and saw two cops talking to the judge.  Not a good sign.  The ticket was so long ago that I had forgotten what the cop looked like.  I sat and waited.  The cops were here for another case.  That was taken care of.  I waited again.  Another cop came out of a conference room.  Was this the one?  No, he signed a paper and left.  The judge asked me when my hearing was.  I told him 9:30 and he mumbled something.  OK, the judge hates me.  I couldn't see the clock from where I was sitting so I had no idea what time it was.  Finally, the judge motioned for me to come over.  He asked the clerks if the officer had phoned to say he was running late.  Nope, the cop didn't even work in the same town anymore.  The judge turned and said, ""Today must be your lucky day"".  He told me that they would send out the refund of my deposit on Friday.  I thanked His Honor and breathed a huge sigh of relief.  It's nice to have a clean driving record once again.

I stopped at a pawn shop and scored some sweet CD's for the distro.  Hot Water Music, Grey Area, Warzone, Good Clean Fun, Ann Beretta, Throwdown, The Stereo, The Clash...  I mean honestly, who would sell London Calling to a freggin' pawn shop?

I came home and slept.  Slept slept slept.  Then I went to work.  Work was boring and slow.  Until I decided to play a joke on Colleen, the cook who lived upstairs.  I ran up to her apartment and banged on her door.

""Just a minute!!""

""No"", I said, ""You have to get out NOW.  The building is on fire, the Fire Department is on the way"".

""Shit!"".  She burst out of the door, stopped and grabbed her coat.

""Come on, let's go!""

We hurried down the stairs and out to the street where she was greeted by a crowd of 10 Carmelo's regulars shouting ""APRIL FOOL!!"".  She slapped me about six times and stormed back upstairs, furious.  

Later... we were dead so I cleaned up early.  Of course, that means that some jackoff is going to call in and order a pain in the ass pizza that will make me have to clean up all over again and tonight was no exception.  You always hope that you can just skate by, but that rarely happens.  I still got out on time though.

Tomorrow is Machina practice, should be a good time.  We still need a singer."

"event","Last year I was scared that stores were going to stop selling Grand Theft Auto 3.  I got a line from a friend (Kev) who said he had some left at the store he worked in.  I drove down to the mall, and on the way, I got stuck behind this truck goin 40 in a 55.  As soon as I saw my chance, I dropped into 2nd and passed him.  Shortly after that was the exit for the mall, but I saw flashing lights in the mirror.

The cop said I was doing 68 in a 55.  Didn't give me a chance to ask him any questions or anything, just gave me a ticket and a $140 fine.  Pissed, I went and got my game and spent the next six hours murdering police officers.  And they say video games aren't therapeutic.

I lost the ticket.  I know it sounds like a shitty excuse but I did, and I had no idea where to go or look to get a copy.  I didn't know if it was a state cop or local or what, since it was on a highway where I got pulled over.  I figured I would wait until they sent me a nastygram in the mail and then I'd just pay the fine then.

Well, that day didn't come until 15 months later.  I had forgotten about the ticket until I open this envelope and see that they're going to suspend my license if I don't respond to the summons.  So, I sent in a deposit and requested a hearing, since I was about to leave for tour and I couldn't afford to just pay it.  So now, I have to go to court tomorrow morning (actually this morning) at 9:30.  I'm debating whether I should just change my plea and pay the fine or try and get the points knocked down.  I don't think I was going that fast but I've no way to prove I wasn't.  I can always hope that the cop doesn't show up, but they usually do, so if he does, we'll have a chat and see what we can do.

I get up, come downstairs, watch two episodes of NYPD Blue, shitshowerandshave, and then get ready for work.  On a Monday work is usually dead.  Nobody orders pizza on a Monday night.  But I still get paid, even though it's not a lot, so I do it anyway.

I wish I had something clever to say.  As verbose as I can be, sometimes I just feel like I am all out of words.  I no longer like to speak or type just to hear or read what I am saying.  I used to do that all the time.  I would write these huge columns.  Ask anyone who knows me, I have an opinion on everything.  But now I just don't have the motivation.  People have told me that I should be a writer, because I write well.  I don't have the patience.  I don't have the muse.  Every time I try to so much as write a column, I get bogged down, even if it's about issues that I feel strongly about.  Maybe I am just tired of talking.

The CD clocks in at over 80 minutes but you can listen to it the whole way through and still wish there were more songs.  The orchestra is booming on this CD.  I suggest you buy or burn it, but if you burn it then you have to cut out a couple of the symphonic parts to get all the songs to fir on a CD-R.

George is a big fan of The Commercials.  Actually, that's an understatement.  He is pretty much our biggest fan.  He even has a fan site for the band.  His twin sister Natalie is a big fan too.  So, their father approached us with an offer to play their birthday party.  He offered us $500, and we were like, OK, deal.  The place was a church and we played on the altar.  It was a small church but it was really nice inside, similar to Wayne Presbyterian but older, more rustic.  The party was fully catered with some of the best food I've ever laid eyes on.  We stuffed ourselves, played a set, and then George's dad picked up the merch tab for all the kids at the party (about 40 of them).  You can guess what ensued.  It must be nice being rich.

"event","True quote from a girl at the Bigwig show in Allentown Friday night.

What a hose beast.

When you get back from a tour, there's this feeling, almost a disappointment that settles over you.  It's disguised as relief, because you can get home and eat good food and not be broke, but it slowly dawns on you that the routeen of your life must return.  Necessity dictates that you must work to make money to climb out of the debt you amassed while you were gallivanting around the country.  So, this week I worked a lot.

Friday and Saturday night, though, something new entered my life.  The distro.  I was into the idea that Richard and Travis were making a reality.  Rich showed me the first bin of stuff.  I came home that night and sifted through a lot of my CD's and weeded out 125 of them, packaged them up, and I had a bin worth of stuff to sell.  Over the last two days, I made $100.  Fat tits, eh?

And just so you all know, I will buy your used CD's at rates comparable to what Double Decker would give you for them, so if anyone is thinking of unloading CD's, see me, don't drive to Allentown.

So, a lot of things are coming to a head.  We (The Commercials) have a booking agent now.  Our Blackout! CD comes out May 20th.  We hit the road again in June, spending three weeks touring with awesome pals Zolof The Rock & Roll Destroyer.  Our schedule will increase.  Hopefully a video will be shot for a song off the CD too, still no definite date on that, but it's something that we really want to make happen.

The show tonight was cool.  The kids from that private school were...  young.  I couldn't believe some of the dance maneuvers I saw.  Finger pointing without knowing the words to sing along to...  trying to do gang vocals without knowing the words...  Oh man...  when I was 15 did I do that?  Please tell me I didn't.

Two nights in a row eating at a diner with Travis and Richard.  I am such a fat fuck."

Just OK, you ask?  Well, it's like this.  It would have been better if some people would have done their jobs.  Most of the promoters and people at the shows were cool and on the ball, but a few were either inept or downright assholes, and it really put a damper on the good spirits.

Like... the kid from Pensacola who booked a show for the 16th, then e-mailed us and cancelled the show which he said was on the 15th, and never returned our messages when we asked for clarification.  Or the people in Georgia and Florida who didn't so much as put up a flyer.  Or the soundman at the club in Shreveport, Louisiana, who purposely made our sound crappy because the headlining band is his full time gig, and he didn't want any of the other bands to sound as good.  

But all in all, I had a good time.  I am broke, but hell, being broke ain't so bad.

Yes it is.

So many people I've talked to say that the city is dirty nd dangerous, but nothing I've ever experienced in my several times here has convinced me of that.  There's great food lots of entertainment, people are friendly and not jaded at all...  it just rocks.  I love this city.

Earlier.  The trip from Shreveport, Louisiana, to Birmingham sucked.  All nine of us (The Commercials + roadie and At A Loss) stayed at Kevin from Zack The Rookie's house.  So, there were many people crammed into a small place.  Lots of flattulence and male nudity followed suit.  The thing is, the drive was 7 hours and we had to be at the venue early, so we had to get up at 8. As Jeff from At A Loss was flapping his genitals onto his singer's face, it was 4 AM.  So... I spent the drive nodding in and out of sleep with Tony waking me up at the most inopportune times to ask for a directions update.  The thing with that is, he will want to know what exit to get off at even if it's 200 miles away, and he knows it's 200 miles away and he doesn't need to wake me up but he does anyway.  

I had never been to this place in B-ham before, a smal venue called Cave 9.  It's really cool.  A complete DIY space that is perfect for indie-level shows.  No bouncers, no ""rock club"" attitudes, just a stage, a vocal PA, and painted black walls.

This is our last show with At A Loss.  They have to go back to NYC to record.  They upstaged us by destroying their instruments, an then later, during our last song, jumping onstage naked and humping us while we played.  I guess it was sutable revenge for Tom's first prank- the first day of the trip he took a shit in a hotel room ice bucket and left it on a table in their hotel room. I will sorely miss those guys, they were great company and a great band as well.

This was the first time we drove straight there.  It was kind of fun, but after 12 hours you start going a little haywire.  Plus, since we weren't playing shows on the way, we were spending our own cash for food.  And video games.  Anything to give us a break from the numbing, repetitive reality of tractor trailers and exit signs.

South By Southwest (SXSW).  There's no way I can really explain it, but I will try.  Hundreds of bands all vying for your attention.  CD's being passed out left and right.  Record label representatives prowling the streets in droves looking for the band that they want to sign.  The schmooze factor is off the hook.  People are doing everything they can to break through.  Once in a while, as you walk the streets of Austin, you run into bands that you've played with before.  Perhaps you've crossed paths on the road, or maybe they're from your hometown too.  I ran into a guy I used to know from Connecticut that I hadn't seen for six years who now has a high company position at Hot Topic.  

Shows.  There are so many shows.  So many, in fact, that you can't really expect a big crowd, because there's just dozens of bands playing every night.  Our crowd was about 30 people, half of whom were industry people coming to see us.  We played exceptionally well, I thought.  It felt good to know that we could turn out a decent set under pressure of knowing that those industry eyes and ears were focusing on every facet of our performance.  It really makes you feel alive.  You really ought to experience something like this, as a band member or a fan of music.  There's something for everyone, every night.  Travis, especially, would lose his head in Austin.  He probably wouldn't ever go back to PA.

I don't know yet what will come of this, but it was worth the drive.  Now that I am on tour again, I feel better than I have in months.  I said it before, I live for this.  And the weather is much nicer too... PA is cold now, but it's 78 degrees in Texarkana as I write.  Wish I had brought more shorts."

May 20.  The CD will be out.  I can't even begin to explain how psyched I am about it.

I am at Ohio University right now (Not OSU, that's April 15) and the band is getting ready to head back to Bedford, PA for a Sunday afternoon show.  Weekend trips like this are a lot of fun, even though I end up getting shafted on my paychecks.  I think the show last night in Athens, Ohio was well worth it.  This was our third time here, so we were pretty well known.  I small but very energetic crowd of about 70 people were going absolutely apeshit.

I am not going to lie and say I don't love this.  Fuck, I live for this.  I don't understand it though.  I guess I am just used to people standing there and watching, maybe bobbing their heads a bit.  The last few shows we've played, the crowd has been very active.  I'm trying not to let it become my main expectation for every show, I don't want to get my hopes up and end up let down, but I can still savor this.  I can still hear their voices echoing our lyrics.  I can still see them piling up in front of Drew to shout along.  I can still see the people moving.  I live for this.

Anyway...  welcome back Travis, I knew you wouldn't stay away."

But I really want to start breaking things right now.  I spilled about 3 or 4 ounces of ginger ale on my laptop.  The screen went black.  That doesn't look good.  I turned it off, and tried to turn it back on.  Nothing.  There's soda slowly dripping from the battery compartment and the floppy drive.  Yup.  I really want to hang myself.  With my fucking luck the rope will break.

If there is one thing, just one thing I wish I could change about myself, I would not be clumsy.  Why is it that other people can go through life without knocking shit over, spilling shit all over the place, tripping and falling, I swear something or someone is out to get me.  It's not like I am never careful about what I do, I always give that extra ounce of caution.  I know what a fucking clod I can be.  And yet it still happens at least once or twice a day, I will break something, I will slip and hurt myself, I'll run into something, or on really fun days I will have chain reaction instances.  That happens when I drop something, I go to pick it up, and something else falls, and this process repeats several times.  I would gladly give up my pinky finger or a couple toes if it would mean that I would never experience this kind of clumsy shit ever again in my life.

I got a new car.  It's a 95 Neon.  My Civic was about to die for good.  Some kid wanted to put a rice rocket engine in it.  I wish him luck.  I need something that will get me to and from practice and shows reliably.  It has a more comfortable back seat too, for those Rich Burkett laser-light spectaculars on long drives.

Rich, I know I still owe you money for the laptop, oh, sorry, I mean worthless piece of plastic... once I get back from tour in mid March I'll step up those payments.  Right now, though, I feel like going out and looking for a fight."

"event","Well, take it from me.  Quit.  Right now.  Burn your instruments and go to college, because this is probably much more stressful than anything.  Ever.

Let us start with a timeline. 

September 2002:  We go to Water Music Studios in Hoboken, NJ to record for our first Blackout release.  We're pretty psyched.  We lay down the basic tracks in three to four days, and set another date to record vocals.  Now, our engineer decides after the sessions to quit the studio, but he insists on working with us through the finish of our recording. The problem?  Scheduling.  In between his new job and all of our schedules as well as the schedule of Water Music, it's a long time before they can agree upon a day to finish tracking.  So, sometime in November the vocals and the acoustic song get done, and the first attempt at a mix happens thereafter.

It sounds bad.  Our engineer is great when it comes to tracking but he is young and doesn't really have the ears to get the best sound out of the tracks.  He bows out at this point.  Bill talks about finding a producer, but none are available on short notice.  Enter Rob.  I mentioned Rob in my last long post.  He runs the studio and has years of experience doing what he does.  We set up a date with Rob to mix, but something comes up, it gets pushed back a couple weeks.  This happens two, possibly three times.  Bill is less than thrilled.  He has to push the release date back to May, it was set for April.  A month goes by, it's now mid-January and we have no idea what is going on.  I am pretty much in the dark at this time, and Tony is the one working with Bill trying to get Rob on a free day or two so we can finish this thing.  Finally, the day is set, again as I mentioned in my previous post.

Tony meets with Rob and they start the process, and it instantly grinds to a halt.  Now, I only know what Tony told me, but according to him, he didn't like the mix Rob was pushing for, and Rob was unwilling to compromise or even make adjustments and listen to it.  Rob burned a copy of the Texas Is The Reason cover and sent Tony back with it to play for us, and this brings me up to last Sunday.

I'm working a double.  The phone rings.  It's Tony.  He wants me to come to Vince's on Monday.  I show up, and he plays the song for me.  It's not bad, but not great either.  The guitars are too low in the mix, the drums are too loud, and the vocals are really loud.  Bill was, fuck it.  Bill was pissed beyond belief that the session didn't go as planned, and he really laid into Tony about it.  So, he agreed to give us go with our old engineer, Vince from Skylight.  The files had to be burned to CD and sent to Skylight, which didn't happen until Friday.  We were sitting around there on Thursday waiting and Vince said, ""Why don't you guys just retrack the songs?  That way if the files don't arrive in time we can still get a finished product to Bill and all will be good."" He added in that he wouldn't charge us for the recording, so...

We thought about it, and said, fuck it, we're here, we've played these songs for two years, this should be easy.  Bam, five songs tracked in a day and a half.  The files arrive on Friday afternoon and they have to be dumped in and converted to a different format (yay).  So, we decided to keep my drum tracks, and mix and match guitar parts.  Vocals were pretty much redone.  The acoustic song we left intact, it sounds great.  The thing is, we have not told Bill that we rerecorded anything for fear that he might get angry.  I wouldn't blame him if he did, but I feel like we got forced into this situation by Rob on a couple levels, the first being his unavailability, the second his unwillingness to even hear our input.  And Reuben quitting set us back a month too because we had to wait to find a date when we could all be there and have access to the equipment we needed.

Bill and I are in agreement on the main thing, which is that a finished CD is the most important thing right now, and all the politics and ego shit that is flying around means nothing.  I hope he keeps that in mind when I call him tomorrow and tell him that it will be finished by tomorrow night and that he will have it in his hands two hours after I leave Skylight.  And we agree on something else:  We never want to go through this shit again, which is why next album we are getting a producer and the producer might work with us, but if he decides to make his own choices, then that's the breaks.  I am not going to deal with the war of the anal retentive musician versus the anal retentive engineer ever again, I'll fucking quit before that happens.

I should have fucking gone to college anyway."

Yesterday was a long but interesting day. I had to get up at 9, which is painfully early for me, and meet the band at my guitarist's aunt's house. From there we drove to Coney Island, NY for the photo shoot for our CD. We took some shots for the cover on the boardwalk, and some band pictures in one of the alleys by Nathan's. Two things: Why do people insist of taking pictures of bands in alleys, and why does Nathan's have the worst hot dogs ever? So, after that, we drove to Hoboken, took a route through Manhattan which was fun. I hadn't even been to the WTC site since before 9/11, so driving past that giant empty space and thinking about the thousands who died there was a little unsettling. But Manhattan was Manhattan, and it was business as usual. We couldn't go through the Holland Tunnel with a trailer, so we had to go through the Lincoln. I love making Daylight references in the tunnels.

We arrive at Blackout HQ and drag Bill Will from his piles of paperwork. We go get some good foor at the Malibu Diner in Hoboken. The food here is awesome. After, we drop Bill off and go to WFMU, only to be told that we're painfully early. It's not even 7 and we're not supposed to load in till 9:30. So we wait. And wait and wait and wait. Finally we load in, set up, and soundcheck. Before we know it we're on the air. We're given a brief rundown on what to do... make sure we tell people the title of the songs, where to get them, the website, plug any shows, whatever. There will be no breaks, we're just playing a set like we would at a show. No commercial breaks (no pun intended). So, we play our songs. Usually, we play like we're trying to break our instruments into pieces, but this was more relaxed. We concentrated more on accuracy. The person doing the mix was very good, unfortunately I never got her name.

So we finished and that was it. I thought we were going to do an interview session and take some calls but we just broke down our gear and that was it. They went right to playing music afterwards. So, I am sorry if anyone called in, I thought the format was gonna be different, ike, a song or two, interview, another song or two, and so on.

Anyway, thanks again to all who tuned in, and the session is available for download or streaming at www.wfmu.org .

Played at Zern's tonight.  It was the inaugural Machina Infernus show.  Rich came out to support.  Nobody else did.  I used to be bothered when my friends decided to leave before The Commercials played but now they don't even bother to come to the show.  I guess staying home and smoking pot and getting drunk is much more fun than going to see bands.  Maybe I just need new friends.  Maybe I should quit giving a shit, after all, if these people don't have any ambition in life then why should I be shocked that they won't come see people who do?  Anyway, it's all rather moot, isn't it?  

Machina was not bad, but not great either.  I think that Nick, our singer. expected kids to go nuts right off the bat, but these were emo/punk kids, most of whom have never seen an actual metal band (I don't count metalcore, it's not really metal).  Plus we couldn't hear for shit in the building.  The sound was bouncing around like crazy.  We did our three songs and then The Commercials played.  It was pretty fun.  And I actually did make some new friends.  

Till next time...

"event","Seems like this is a recurring theme for me when it comes to my band.  Last night, we played a show in Annville, PA.  It was a great show.  Afterwards I had to catch up with Tony about band plans.

So, in the midst of our discussion, I asked if we were available for a March 8th show.  Tim from NT asked me if we would play.  He says no, we're going to be on tour.  

Tour.  Well, that's fine.  But when did we decide to go on tour?  He says he told me.  I swear to the stars, moon, and sun that he never mentioned it to me.  He says he did.  Now, where I am coming from, is that the date we're slated to leave is Feb. 22, which is barely six weeks away, and that leaves me little time to save up cash and make sure my bills are paid up before I leave.  And since this band hasn't been making enough money to send me home with anything, I need to make sure that I am squared up before I leave.  My car is facing a huge repair bill in the next few weeks, and I now have to cancel that because of the tour.

I don't mind going on tour, in fact, I am eager to go.  We'll be going out with At A Loss, playing at South By Southwest on the Revelation stage in Austin, Texas, and touring two more weeks with Digger.  Fuckin' saweet!  But give me some notice, please.  I need to make sure I have my debts in check before I leave, and I really hate being the last guy to know anything in this band.

All that crap aside, I like where I am at with the band now.  Our CD will be coming out in Springtime, and things are promising to look very good.  I can't wait to be out there playing every night.

I toured twice in 2002, once last winter and once in the summer.  I worked a lot at the pizza shop.  The Commercials signed to Blackout Records at what seemed like the bleakest time.  I hit two deer with my Integra and now I drive a shitbox.  I recorded a halfway decent metal demo with Jeff and Kovacs.  I turned 30.  I discovered Soilwork and got really into metal all over again.

2002 flew by.  So much happened, and yet I can remember so little.  I can't wait for the day when I can do music full time, I think if I didn't have all those work shifts interrupting my thought process I'd be able to remember what I did.

Feh, whatever.  Happy New Year.  A day late, like I care."

First, Goodall, thanks for what you wrote.  I know I replied to your response but I wanted to say it on the main page.  

This is a two parter.  Saturday night.

I drove down to Morrisville, PA (outside of Trenton), to meet the rest of the Commercials at Tommy T's house.  Tommy, some of you might know, was in a bad car wreck two months ago and he almost bought the farm.  He broke his hip, crushed a lung, that kind of thing.  He is moving around now, walking without crutches, so he asked to tag along to our show in Brooklyn.  I arrive first, the band later, and we are off.  As soon as we are just outside of Trenton, one of the guys at the Temple calls and is wondering where we are.  He said we were supposed to play first, but the info Tony got had us on third.  We tell him we'll be there in an hour.  An hour and ten minutes later, we show up, immediately unload, and set up in the side room.  20 minutes later, we're onstage.

There's 300 kids here.  This is our fifth time playing the Temple, so some of them even know us by now.  We rip through 8 songs.  The crowd gets more intense with each song.  What starts as a couple people moshing and ten people singing along develops into full blown chaos by the time we play ""This Is Where We Die"".  Kids are diving off the stage.  The pit has grown into a category 5 hurricane, with huge spikes of hair, fists, boots, and body parts flailing around in a maelstrom of aggression.  The emo kids are up front singing the words at the top of their lungs.  They know them.  I am amazed by it.  ""For Tuesday"" closes it out as we self-destruct over a roar of people cheering.  I stand after the throwing of the drums, China & stand raised above my head, then I spike it into the stage to put the period on the end of our set.  The lights go out and the roar is even louder.

I am not even exaggerating.

After the set, we break down our equipment and settle in for the rest of the show.  It's 90 degrees in the stage room but in the foyer it's freezing.  Outside, it's typical winter in New York City.  Punks stand on the streetcorner lofting snowballs into the intersection, cheering when they detonate against a roof or a window.  A trash truck drives by and it's like the scene in Return Of The Jedi where they concentrate all the fire on that one huge Star Destroyer.  The truck stops and the kids turn and walk towards the temple, feigning innocence.  The truck leaves.  I smile at this display.  Only in New York.

We hit a pizza place, return to the Temple, and then do a video interview for the Blackout website.  It might be up soon, it might not be.  When it is, I will let you guys know.  We return to Morrisville with smiles five wide.  It's a good night.  Politically incorrect jokes are hurled throughout the van.  Tony, the only one of us with a conscience, objects mildly but doesn't push it.  On the way home we give Vince from Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer a buzz, and he meets us at this diner called the All American Diner & Pub.  You MUST go there.  Awesome food, they serve beer, younger crowd, and excellent food.  Not bad on the price factor either.  It's in Fairless Hills.

All in all, a great night.  

Sunday.  I sleep till 2:30.  Richard and I head to the mall to do some Christmas shopping.  We eat at Friendly's after hitting a few stores.  I have to work, so I drop Rich off and head in.  

Two people were fired.

No, I wasn't one of them.

Adrienne and this cook, John.  We suspect that John has a coke habit.  At any rate, he no-showed for the third time in a week, so he is done.  My boss called Adrienne in and she flipped on him, hung up on him twice.  I mean, sure, it's her day off but she was only being asked to cover for two hours.  My boss has bent over backwards for her- lending her hundreds of dollars to get her car fixed, renting her a car when hers was in the shop, never once refusing a favor she asked of him, and she hung up in his face, dragged him over the coals...  good, glad she is gone.  More money for me.

That's the news.

Isn't my life fun."

"event","Two days ago I turned 30.  Let the jokes commence.

I never expected I would live to see 30.  Growing up, a child of the Cold War, I honestly believed that we would have nuked this planet into a new ice age by 1990.  My mother going through her psycho evangelist period didn't do much to ease my fears.  So as the 90's moved past, I took a lot of time to observe everything around me because I kept thinking to myself, I shouldn't be here.

Of course, in the last couple years, I've overcome that irrational fear of sudden global annihilation, even to the point where I am downright laughing my ass off at anyone who preaches armageddon.  Whatever.  Armageddon was fought in my mind since Reagan was president, your foolish scare tactics don't work on me now.

But here is my thing.  Yeah, I am old.  I'm 30.  Whoopee, right? I mean, it's not the most obvious thing about me, like being fat, and it's certainly not the most unusual.  The quandary I am always in is that I cannot relate to other people who are 30.  I feel so disconnected from them because they, for the most part, have families, careers, whatever, and that is the center of their lives.  My life revolves around making music and playing Vice City.  My job is something that interferes with that and is a necessary evil.  And yet... even though I act and feel younger than I am, I am still stuck in this limbo when it relates to other people.  I don't have many friends, and by that I mean people I spend time with more than once a week.  I can count them on one hand.  I have many acquaintances and I am fond of most of the people I know, but very few I would consider true friends.  None of them are really close to my age either.  So I don't get it.  Am I pathetic, refusing to grow up, hanging out with people ten years younger because I don't want to have ""responsibilities"", or am I just thinking too much about it?  I think it's the latter.  I have a lot of responsibility, and I've dedicated as much work and effort into playing music as others have put into their careers...  but something will always make me feel separated even from people I've come to be friends with.  I never existed in your world before a few years ago.  I will always be the one on the outside no matter how many times you invite me in.  I didn't stand at the bus stop with you or walk to school with you.  I didn't go through the whole system of going from child to adult with you.  No matter how much we know each other, there's no substitute for experience.  This kind of detachment is a double edged sword.  It helps to be able to disassociate, but there is true pain in knowing that you'll never really fit in, that the built-in instinct that forges friends in childhood won't manifest when you're older.

I don't have a graceful way to end this, so I will just say thanks to all my friends and people I know.  I am grateful for what I do have, because I never thought I'd see 30 and I never thought I'd have even this many friends.  Even if they call me ""dad"" and buy me presents on Father's Day.  Pathetic or not, I'll never forget you guys, nor can I thank you enough for adopting a wayward irresponsible 30 year old punk into the circle."

I do.

Anyway.  The Machina Infernus mp3.com site is finally up.  After ten days.  It can be found at http://www.mp3.com/machinainfernus

Someone who works at Relapse in the mail room heard the demo at Vince's studio, so I sent him a bunch and he passed them out.  Not a bad way to make a contact.

Things are moving along in Commercial-land as well, we're almost done with the recording for Blackout, and hopefully it will be out soon.  The Punk Rock Jukebox 3 is going to have tracks by the Foo Fighters, Good Charlotte, and American Nightmare (I refuse to acknowledge that other name).  We are *hella* psyched about that.  Foo Fighters.  Dave Grohl.  My idol.  My freaking idol.  Best drummer ever.  OK, maybe not best, but in my top five.

Speaking of that, Pudge's top five drummers:

5.  Neil Peart.  Love Rush or hate Rush, the guy is amazing.
4.  Dave Lombardo.  He taught me how to go fast and bring the pain.
3.  Dave Grohl.  Power, groove, and intensity that goes unmatched.
2.  Nicholas Barker.  Whether with Cradle or Dimmu Borgir.  Relentless speed.
1.  Henry Ranta of Soilwork.  He encompasses the styles of all the above and plays with beautiful purpose and precision.  One of the only drummers who makes the drums an emotional instrument as opposed to just a complicated metronome.

Still playing Vice City like a madman, and now there's a few other games I want-  Mortal Kombat looks decent, as does that Jango Fett game.  And Kingdom Hearts, Davis told me I should pick that up months ago.  I hate being broke.

Played a show in Lancaster tonight, playing in Baltimore tomorrow.  Get to go visit family next week, don't know if I will be online much...  

Till next time."

"event","I don't believe it...I don't fucking believe it. I finally muster up the courage to ask a girl to semi...and she said yes...BUT! She had to make sure it was ok with her parents. Me, being scatter brained at the time, forgot to give her my cellhpone number. Okay, whatever...I can wait a few days. So finally, I go to school, all in a good mood (after being told by many people not to worry...they'll probably say yes) only to hear this morning that the said no...but that we ""could still be friends"", which we ahve been anyways, so whatever...


FUCKING FUCK! Is it too much to fucking ask for to ahve a date to a dance? Is it? Apparently so. Every time I've ever asked a girl out...ever ('cept that time in seventh grade...I was forced into that) they've said no. Finally, some one says yes, only to find out later their parents won't let them. Now, I'm not mad at her...I just don't get why my luck with girls is so fucking bad...it makes no SENSE!!! Goddammit! So here we go, another dance, no date...what ever...maybe I just won't go... This seriously couldn't get any worse. It's one thing to be rejected and shit. Ok, move on and such. But ti's different...when you almost sorta kinda think/hope this particular person actually likes you back. Christ...this sucks so fucking much. Is it so much to ask for? Tell me, someone, please...is it too much to ask for?"

"event","Lately I've been doing a little fanediting on the side. For those of you who don't know:<br /><i><br />A <b>fan edit</b> is a version of a film <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing"" title=""Film editing"">modified</a> by a viewer, that removes, reorders, or adds material in order to create a new interpretation of the film. This includes the removal of scenes or dialog, replacement of audio and/or visual elements, and adding material from sources such as deleted scenes or even other films. The trend became popular when an individual calling himself the ""Phantom Editor"" (later revealed as professional editor <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_J._Nichols"" title=""Mike J. Nichols"">Mike J.

"event","So...I took a practice SAT test from Princeton Review....excuse me <b>The </b>Princeton Review. What-fucking-ever. If you can't tell already, I resent this test 120%. Seriously, you needed a fucking dictionary to do any of the vocab. Excuse me that I don't read any college level books...so let's begin my most likely profanity filled analysis of the test.<br /><br /><b>INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO READ THE SCORES</b><br /><br />Okay, not entirely useless. I suppose they have to provide some sort of key on how to read your results. Okay. No problems... Well let's see here:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Results:</b> Ok, no problems here. Just tells you how you've done on any previous tests you've taken. Cool with me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Student Info: </b>Meh, just your name and testing location.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Top Line: </b>Ok, you needed a fancy name for a section that lists <b>concepts, techniques, and strategies </b>that <b>if mastered</b> can &nbsp;&nbsp; help improve your score. Fine...maybe you may need suggestions on how to do stuff. I'll let the obvious not knowing if you did or didn't know what you were doing in this slide...Oh,&nbsp; and graphs. Yeah, just sorta tell you how you did on different sections of difficulty. Fine.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Item Analysis: Section - </b>Those bastards stole my colon. This section tells you how to read what questions you got right or wrong. Here's the example one they gave:<br /><br /><br /><table width=""500"" cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""1"" border=""1"" align="""" summary=""""><br />    <tbody><br />        <tr><br />            <td>&nbsp;</td><br />            <td>1</td><br />            <td>2</td><br />            <td>3</td><br />            <td>4</td><br />            <td>5</td><br />        </tr><br />        <tr><br />            <td>Corr</td><br />            <td>A</td><br />            <td>C</td><br />            <td>D</td><br />            <td>C</td><br />            <td>B</td><br />        </tr><br />        <tr><br />            <td>You</td><br />            <td>+</td><br />            <td>A</td><br />            <td>-</td><br />            <td>b</td><br />            <td>*</td><br />        </tr><br />        <tr><br />            <td>Cats</td><br />            <td>i</td><br />            <td>i</td><br />            <td>i</td><br />            <td>j</td><br />            <td>j</td><br />        </tr><br />    </tbody><br /></table><br /><br />Corr: tells you the right answers. You: Tells you what you answered compared to the correct answer. + means you got it right, a capital letter tells you what you answered. - means you left it blank. A lowercase letter like ""b"" indicates that you guessed wrong, and an * indicates you guessed correctly. Okay....how the fuck would they know whether you guessed or not? Fine...whatever.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Item Analysis: Section - </b>Again with the colon stealing! This basically tells you how many in a particular category you got right, wrong or blank.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>General: </b>Additional answer choice analysis (wtf?) and comments on your overall performance.<br /><br />Okay, here we go:<br /><br /><font size=""4""><b>DIAGNOSTIC SCORE REPORT <font size=""1"">(ok, you needed to use a word like ""diagnostic""? That's another rant for another day...fuckers)<br /><br /></font></b></font><b>SUBJECT: MATH (We had several 25 minute sessions for this part)<br /><br /></b>I've never been good with math, so no real surprises here. First thing fucking first: I guessed on several of these: omg! The all know <b>The </b>Princeton Review didn't know that! The first comment said ""you missed an opportunity to plug in"". What the fuck does that mean? I answered all the ""plugged in"" questions. Fine. What ever. <br /><br /><b>-PITA! Plug in the answer choices. </b>Sorry, I'm supposed to know what the fuck this means?<br /><b>-There is usually more than one way to arrange points on a line. </b>This helps me how?<br /><b>-Use the rule of 180. </b>The fuck? I'm pretty sure this has something to do with triangles...it'd be nice if they explained it.<br />-<b>Learn volume formulas. </b>I know the volume formula (singular, not prlural) so fuck you.<br /><b>-Read table and graph questions more carefully. </b>I would...but if I did I woulodn't be bale to finish the section...so excuse me for trying to finish the test. <br /><br />Now for the bottom section:<br /><b>-Eliminate Joe Bloggs answers on hard math problems. </b>What the fuck?<br /><b>-Be careful: preventing careless mistakes means increasing your score. </b>Oh really? I had no fucking idea!<br /><br /><b>Subject: Critical Reading.<br /><br /></b>Okay, English, one of my best subjects. Again, you need a fucking dictionary to answer some of these. Moving on to comments:<br /><br /><b>-Half-right is ALL wrong. </b>Wrong. Half-right is half-right. 50%, half credit, motherfucker.<br />-<b>On CR questions, common sense is a good tool to eliminate answer choices. </b>No. Shit.<br />-<b>Slow down and read carefully on Critical Reading. </b>Sorry, not enough time to slow down in read. You see, MCAS gives you enough fucking time to do this shit so you know for sure that you're getting this right.<br /><br /><b>SUBJECT: WRITING<br /><br /></b>Ok, I'm good at writing...I think. Hey, I've got an A- in Creative Writing. <br /><br />Comments worth bitching about:<br />The following comments are all the same thing, just restated:<br /><b>A singular subject agrees with a singular verb. In general, all verbs in a sentence should be in the same tense. All verbs should be in the same tense. </b>Isn't this one of those ""no shit"" things? How many fucking times can this be said?<br /><br /><b>-Avoid words ending in ""-ing"". </b>Fuck<b>ing</b>. Oh man, I'm gonna fucking die! Oh man, I said it again!<br /><br /><b>ESSAY<br /><br /></b>Okay, I like writing. However, the analysis of this pissed me off the most, which is why I saved it for last.<br /><br />We had 25 minutes to write an essay on how in society today some people don't appreciate stuff until they lose it. The prompt asked if it's possible to appreciate something before we lose it. Uh, no shit? Having only 25 minutes, I had no time to do a rough draft to revise, so I wrote whatever came to mind.<br /><br />Comments:<br />-<b>Use real, not hypothetical examples. </b>Wouldn't any example I suggest be hypothetical? How do they know that I didn't use ""real"" examples? What is ""real""?<br /><br />-<b>Your essay did not mention a clear focus. </b>I could have corrected this if I had more TIME.<br /><br /><b>-Always write a conclusion. </b>Okay, how the fuck am I supposed to write a complete essay in 25 minutes? Maybe I should have written ""Sorry there's no conclusion - I didn't have enough time"". Take that, fuckers.<br /><br />Next, there's scores for how on topic and such:<br /><br />-<b>On Topic: 6</b> - Again with stealing my colons! Okay, my fault a little...<br /><b>-Well Writen: 6 - </b>No comment on colons. So...how the fuck am I supposed to write a good essay in 25 fucking minutes? Tell me, please! You (the people at <b>The </b>Princeton Review) try writing a good essay in 25 minutes. It. Can't. Be. Done.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Maybe I'm being a little harsh, but I'm just so fucking pissed right now.<br /><br />Enjoy your weekend,<br />-Dave"

"event","Hellooo! Long time no see! It's been a long time since I've been here...so anyways, let's begin!<br /><br />School has been going great...I hope. Algebra, once again, is giving me grief. One of the many reason's why I'm considering a career in journalism - little math involved. I certainly won't lose sleep over not having to do math after college (ahem *go ask your mother* =P). Spanish is actually going rather well this year...I got recommended for HONORS (!!!!) Spanish II next year. Go me! English and History and the lot are going well. My English teacher, for at least part of the year, was my neighbor...not quite next door, but down the street. How sick is that? <br /><br />I've determined that I need to grow a better pair of balls. Why?<br /><br /><a style=""padding-left: 0px;"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/v/r9GOyle6YqA"" class=""abp-objtab""></a><a class=""abp-objtab"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/v/r9GOyle6YqA"" style=""padding-left: 0px;""></a><object width=""425"" height=""350""><param value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/r9GOyle6YqA"" name=""movie"" /><param value=""transparent"" name=""wmode"" /><embed width=""425"" height=""350"" wmode=""transparent"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/r9GOyle6YqA""></embed></object><br /><br /><br />Does that not look kick ass? Thing is: it's supposed to be gory as hell. I've already walked out of one movie this year (Ghost Rider) and I plan not to do it again.  I mean, how can this not be a kick ass movie? Thing is, it didn't do so well...barely earned over 14 mil so far, if that, and there are talks of splitting the two movies and such. If it's the length scaring people away, movie goers are quite hypocritical: they sat through Return of the King, which is a bit longer than Grindhouse. Maybe it's the style...purposely adding dirt and grime and such to the movie to give it a more grindy-house feel. <br /><br /><br /><a class=""abp-objtab"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/v/XE_iC6h-x7c"" style=""padding-left: 0px;""></a><object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/XE_iC6h-x7c"" /><param name=""wmode"" value=""transparent"" /><embed width=""425"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/XE_iC6h-x7c"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent""></embed></object><br /><br />I mean...does that not look awesome? If they do decide to do the split...I'll definitely go to at least Planet Terror...Death Proof wasn't as good, I heard. Then again, Pulp Fiction is two nad a half hours of dialogue, so yeah :P.<br /><br />It's so good to finally be on vacation. Rainy, yes, but still. I've officially sold my soul to the devil: I have purchased a 14 day trial of World of Warcraft, and I'm liking it. So much so that after report cards I may decide to invest. Some one stop me, please.<br /><br />This week I plan to head out and start looking for work. My dog walking job is great, don't get me wrong...but a little more money never killed anyone (look at Bill Gates). There are two places I'm looking at: Blockbuster Video, or the Cameo, which is a small movie theater across from my church. Both are within semi-walking distance, so I'm stoked.<br /><br />That's all I have for now, I'll get everything up-to-date by the end of the week. Promise ;)<br /><br />-Dave<br /><br />"

I honestly don't know what sickens me more: the act itsself, OR the fact that several reporters left comments on a student's LJ asking for interviews...sickening. It's scary that his happened, and it proves, more than ever: that no place is safe anymore. There are few words that can be used to describe this tragedy, truly...a tragedy...

Oh, the theme for this update will be <em>The Matrix.<br /><br />My name is NEO!<br /><br /></em>Well, so far, things at WHS have been going pretty well. Except for the fact that I have a new nickname. Since so many people think I'm so funny (heh) they decided to call me ""Dane"" Cook instead of ""Dave"" Cook. Blah. Why can't people listen?<br /><br /><em>Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why, why? Why do you keep fighting?<br /></em><br />Well, not exactly *fighting* per se, unless you call trying to get a date a *fight*. I've asked out....two girls this year, and both times *sounds of gunfire and explosions*, well, you get the idea. The first girl I wrote a note, gave to her sister (her twin, ugh) to give to her. The short of it is she wasn't interested in dating, so that never materialized into anything. The second girl, Alex(andra) I was going to ask to semi. So, after careful timing (and a hell of a lotta deodorant) I mustered up the courage to ask her in English. Here's a little transcript:<br /><br />Me: Happy Birthday Alex.<br />Alex: Thanks :)<br />Me: So...Alex, are you going to semi?<br />Alex: Yep.<br />Me: Are you, er, going with anyone.<br />Alex: Yes.<br /><br />*machine gunfire followed by multiple loud explosions* You get the idea.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Neo...wake up.<br /><br /></em>Well, I've been taking the bus lately (which you've prolly already known) which requires getting up early enough to get ready and be out in time to make it to the bus stop and not have to walk. Lately, that's been a bit of a challenge. I don't know why, it's just becoming a bitch and a half to get up.<br /><br /><em>The Matrix has you.<br /><br /></em>Eh, well it's not exactly the <em>Matrix,</em> it's mroe like the <em>Mystrix.</em> Yes, I do indeed have a MySpace. Oh, and I'm damn proud too. Check it out at: <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/daverulesyou"">http://www.myspace.com/daverulesyou</a>. Do it. Now.<br /><br /><em>Morpheus, how will I be able to get into contact with you?<br /><br /></em>For future reference:<br /><br />MSN Messenger: droidd2@hotmail.com<br />AIM: aztek463<br />E-Mail: droidd2@yahoo.com<br />&nbsp;*note - I am not on AIM very much...contact me on MSN*<br /><br /><em>So, Neo, you wanna go dancing with us tonight?<br /><br /></em>So the 9th grade semi was on Friday, the 19th. It was fun, as all school dances are. My attire consisted of a dark purple shirt, a black tie (which came off half-way through) black socks and black slip on ""lesbian"" shoes (long story. Very very long). I fast danced for most of the time, skipped out on most of the slow dances...save for the last one :D. I slow danced with this girl from my English class. He name is&nbsp; Marissa. It started off kinda...awkward, then it got easier and we got a bit more, er, comfortable. Then the song ended :(. But still, it was an expierience I won't soon forget. I'll kepp ya'll updated on how *that* goes down on a later date.<br /><br />Well, I must be going. So, until then, this is Dave saying, ""Good night""</p>"

"event","GODDAMN RAIN! Now, don't let me be misunderstood - I love rain; except when I have to be out in it. Not that I mind too much. It's just a little annoying. But at least I suck it up. There is this girl at my bus stop. She is such an annoying little bitch. She has this most annoying high pitched squeal that would make even Anhuld the governator go crazy. She's such a fucking wimp. This morning it was barely raining, the bus was coming in two minutes and she lives two houses away from the bus stop. So what does she do? She has her mother drive her and her brother to the bus stop (the brother hates her too, he's not a fag). Me and my friend Megan are standing there while she waits in her car for the bus to come. She's an attention whore, too. The other day her brother called her a ""fucking slut"" in front all of her ""friends"" (2). SO she gets on the bus, and she is trying to beat the shit out of her brother. It took two people to hold her back and someone else was protecting her brother. SO once every gets off except for me, megan, the girl and her brother, she is sitting there, giving him this evil smile. I'm telling him to be ready to run. She yells at me, ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" So we get off and and she chases her brother across the street to their house blah blah blaH! DAMMIT!

Went and saw the new Harry Potter movie the other day. It was really cool :). But, also very scary, for a Potter movie. I foresee that as the books get darker, the movie's will get an R rating. *shivers*

YEY! Revenge of the Sith is out on DVD. The movie is amazing (WIDESCREEN of course) and the special material is too. My faveorite documentary on there is ""Within a Minute"" that takes a short clip of the Obi-Wan and Anakin fight and shows you everything that went into the making of that scene. Most of the bonus material is if-youre-not-interested-you-won't-like--it type of stuff. But it's a good buy regardless :D

School has been very interesting. There was this kid in my science class who was always ""disruptive"". Well, one day, he's turned around, and that's about it, and the teacher told him to get out for being disruptive. Well, the kid says that he didn't do anything, which is right. Well, he whips a piece of paper at the teacher, and storms out of the room. Security comes up and such. My science teach has the nerve to say that the kid ""came at him"". For fuck sake, when did throwing a piece of paper become an attack? Yeah, ti can harm you, but the kid never went at him. Anyways, cause of ym teacher's lie, the kid is probably getting expelled. Life's a bitch, ain't it?


Until next time,

Good news: I have a job! I'm gonna be walking my neighbor's dog, Apollo, for 15 bucks a week (Tuesday thru Friday since I ahve film club on Mondays) He's a BIG BIG BIG dog, but a nice dog. Maybe a little bigger than Charlie ;)

School is going good. Well, except for Health Class. We just wrapped up the disturbingly vivid chapter on smoking. You see, our health teacher owns a pair of pigs lungs - a healthy one and one that smoke for 20years. Well, she takes them out. The smell a little bad but ok. then she takes out the pump. I'm like: WTF? I felt sick and sat the rest of the period in the nurses office. And this comes after one kid collapses from a movie that we were watching. Next up: SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEX!!!!!!!!11!111ONE1111!1111
This means: videos videos videos, including the allgedly icky STD video. I only have to take it until January, so I think that I can last. I think ;). 

Well, there is this girl I like, okay? But she can't date till she's 16. So now I'm not too sure what to do. There is someone else I wanna ask out, but I get all giggly and excited and nervouse and AHHHHH!!!!!!1 around girls. Oh, teh drama.

My JKA map is coming along good. I'm up to 1342 net unit count and 108 entites. It'll be done......sometime :P

"event","GREETINGS ONE AND ALL! lol, enough of the theatrics. Long time no update. Ah well, helps build suspense, ya know? ;). Anyways, now to the update:


I FINALLY saw Kill Bill. Very sweet movie. The ending of Volume 2 had a very surreally sad ending to it. However, as all movies have sad parts, this movie, had funny parts. For example, in Volume One, Elle Driver, one of the people who shoots up the bride, is standing over her in the hospital, ready to give her a leathal injection. Que Bill on the cell phone.

Bill: Elle I want you to abort the mission.
Elle: WHAT?
Bill: We owe her more than this.
Elle: OH YOU DON'T OWE HER SHIT!
Bill: Will you keep your voice down?
Elle: [whispers] You don't owe her shit!

Well, I thought it was funny.

From Volume Two:

The Bride is at Bill's hotel room. She's sitting on the couch. Now, in order not to spoil the movie, I won't tell you why theya re being so friendly to each other. Anyways, Bill wants the Bride to tell him why she is going and killing his people, and why she left him. But to do that, he shoots her with a dart filled with truth serum:

*Bill shoots the Bride in the leg with the dart. She stares at it*
The Bride: What the FUCK did you just shoot me with?

Again, I thought it was hilarious. There were so amny other funny parts, it would take forever to list them. We continue.


We had our Homecoming Dance the other night. MAN was that fun! DId alot of dancing, with myself, msotly. However, I did dance with several girls, and had a lot of fun dancing up a storm. No real big updates there.

And thanks to Miss LafatAss, I'm sucking ass (hehe, I made a funny) at History. Miss LaForgia, .!.. Thank you.


That's it, short but sweet update, I guess.

Until next time,

<P><STRONG>Old firends(?) </STRONG></P>
<P>I just got an IM from Sean. He's being an asswipe again. He was asking me about if I was passionate about Star Wars. I said enough to pre-order the DVD and d/l the bootleg. I then said he was just using our convo as entertainmetn for him and his friend. He said yes. So after some exchanges of the dirty and profane kind, I blocked him. If he IM's me again with another name, I'm gonna report him for harrassment. As far as I'm concerned, he can lick my (_!_). (This IM is the reason I chose what song I did under Current music. I've never heard the song. Just heard about it)</P>
<P><STRONG>November 1st - Revenge of the Sith DVD and Battlefront II</STRONG></P>
<P>Finally. November 1st is less than a month away. I'm sure you know about Revenge of the Sith coming out on DVD, but maybe never heard of BF2. Battlefront was the single most succesful Star Wars game of all time. It's open ended battles - so you can play thge battle of Endor and have the Rebels lose.&nbsp; This is the same idea. But now they've added Episode III maps and Space Combat. I'v been playing a BETA version for about a week. It's quite good. It took some getting used to, but I LOVE it. I'll be getting BF2 for X-Mas.</P>

"event","<P>This is the update I'm sure you've been waing for Liz: about High School. So, let us begin.</P>
<P><STRONG>Classes</STRONG></P>
<P>Pretty much all of my classes are doing very well. I've passed the first two lessons in Basic Web Design. Seriously, I migh try and HTML update at some point. It's really not that hard. History, on the other hand..... Well, it's honors History, and I thought it would be easy since I always passed all my History stuff at my last school; I was wrong. But I suppose that's what you get when your History teacher is half retarded and smells like shit *rolls eyes*. The first two tests I got a 67 and a 61 respectivley. But on this last test I got a.............................................................96! W00T! Best study habit: Take stuff in your notes that are going to be on the test and recopy them onto a seperate sheet of paper. It helps. I garentee it. In fact, if you try it and it doesn't work for you, I'll give you a full refund of....something. :p</P>
<P>Spanish is going really well. This year my teacher is alot nicer than Mrs. Baverbitch. That being said, I've gotten all in the 90's and oen 77. Not bad for a guy who only slid by in Spanish. And we actually do FUN stuff. We watch the movies about Columbia and stuff, but yesterday and Thursday last week, we watched Jimmy Neutron - in Spanish :D :D. </P>
<P>I'm also passing Geometry. It's easy, but our teacher makes sure that we understand everything before moving onto another thing. Mr. DeLuciass would never do that. Heaven forbid we spend an extra day on this! AMMAGAD! -.-</P>
<P><STRONG>Status (you know what I mean)</STRONG></P>
<P>Still single. However, I would swear one of the sophmores on ym bus is hitting on me. Why you ask? I'll tell you. Well, she's in my Spanish class. So, one morning, our bus stops at a usual place, and as it turns out she lives on our route. Ok, so she comes on and sits across from me, looks at me and says, ""Hey you're in my Spanish class""&nbsp; ""Yes"" I said. Ok no big deal? At this point I'm still kinda shy, so I didn't say much. Yeah, I'm not trying to hit on her or anything, just being friendly. Just want to make it clear before I continue. Ok, so you know, I&nbsp;sorta begin to feel more comfortable, and I start talking to&nbsp;Luke, who I guess you could call my friend. I say that some one is giving me shit. So, Luke, Danielle (another girl on the bus) and Resha (girl from&nbsp;Spanish) are teaching me how to fight. But more on that later. Any ways, they were showing me how to punch, and&nbsp;Resha was saying put a curve into it. I guees I wasn't doing it right, because like took my arm and sorta guided my hand through a punch. It was a little close for any kind of comfort, but it just sorta felt weird. Any ways, the next day at school, I'm at my locker, and I see her&nbsp;walking down the hall, so I said hi, and she punched me really hard in the shoulder. I would've thought she was trying to heat me up if she didn't keep walking and she wasn't smiling. SO I get on the bus, and I say the she punched me.&nbsp;So Danielle said that she&nbsp;[Resha] like me. O.O Yeah so that's kinda weird.</P>
<P><STRONG>Fight Lessons</STRONG></P>
<P>So, as I said before, I'm having fight lessons. It's not as hard as I thought, but after about ten minutes of punching a binder,&nbsp;my knuckles got really sore and red.&nbsp;Just to set some minds at ease, I'm not gonna go around starting fights. SOme hits me, I'll hit them back. Simple as......something. Oh, and I thought it was hilarious to hear about the girls fighting in Randolph after brusshing each other in the shouilder lol.</P>
<P><STRONG>Ummm.....</STRONG></P>
<P>That's it for this school update. I'll write another one later about everything else going on outside of school.&nbsp;Until then, stay cool...</P>

"event","DAMN! It's been so long since I've spun a post here. But alas, life has once again reared it's ugly head. Anywho, I've got a spare minute, so I'll give an update, ok?

Well, the biggest uproar has been caused by me moving. Yep, I have relocated. It's a nice big 1850's farm house. Most of the floors are orignal to the house, blah blah blah.....

The biggest part of this move is that the house is now located on a main street. While this is a big change, it is not always a good thing. Our drievay is a bitch to spot at night, and even in the say, so we stuck up two refelctors to make it easier to spot. Lo and behold, some yobs who got thrown out of school stole them...... To make thing even more funderful (funderful is copyright 2005 darth_grievous1, btw) some guys egged my dads car! And, we found a paint ball in the driveway. Oh well. 

My room is soooooo much bigger. It's bout as big as my old living room, I think to put it into perspective. I got a nice big closet, and alot of storage space for all my, well, you know :D


I'm back on the Jedi Academy gaming scene. I'm two weeks away from joining a new clan, the Vanguards of Serenity. Nice people, and no ranks OR clan matches. Very cool. The admin, Buffy, is as sweet as you can imagine. I've also taken to the modding scene, and have created a piece of duel music, but alas, PCGameMods disabled it (damn them). I'm also making a map for the *VaS* 2.5 anniversary party this october.
Clan site: http://www.vas-clan.com
Forum: http://www.vas-caln.com/forum(my screenname is *<T>*Dave, soon to change)

Oh yes, while I still use AIM, I've been using MSN messenger more. My MSN address is: droidd2@hotmail.com.

And I send a heartfelt message to all of those people who ahve been left homeless by Hurricane Katrina. I hope that everyone can stay safe until New Orleans is re-built. 

This hurrincae ahs also generated alot of, ummmmm, YTMND's. http://www.ytmnd.com. Check it out. MOST of the site are funny. None of the hurricane related ones are. In fact, they are offensive to some. Just look to see what I mean.

Well, that's about all for this update. Until next time :)

"event","Well, it certainly has been a long time since my last update. Let me start with today:

Well, to start off, we had no gym class today. At one point I wouldn't give two cents on the fact about no gym, but I am finally starting to like gym. We've been doing trig in Algebra (NOTE: Class= Algebra, current study in ALGEBRA= TRIGONOMETRY!) Yeah, makes no sense to me either.......
Our math teacher, is seriously starting to get on my nerves. Almost everyday (okay maybe not everyday) he asks some stupid question on where we are going to highschool. Okay, he has a CERTAIN amount that he is entitled to know, but there is some he has no business asking. Lets begin:

1) He asks whether or not people are going to take the Catholic Highschool placement test.

2) He asks what schools people are applying to (which is none of his business, btw)

3) Asks what kind of problems where on the test (who cares?)

4) Test results (not his business)

Then we had our Chemistry final today, since we do Chemestry and Physics this year, and 20 minutes for SS. Then we had computer.

AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Who here has heard of Mavis Beacon? Well, for those of you who do, you probably know that you can make your own lesson. Well, we had to do three lessons: Employment Tests, Correspondance, and 500 Common words. First we had to do Employment Tests. The whole freakin' thing was about the importance of record. Who gives a care? NOT ME!!!!!!!!!! The Correspondence is a letter to some people who just moved into a new house, and they sent them a letter about ther God only knows and cares furniture department. And the 500 common words? Just stupid words that you had to type. FYI, there were not 500! Not only were they badly punctuated, but they has TWO spaces between each sentance, which screwed everyone up. And we had to get a stupid percentage to move on to the next lesson. Honestly, I hate my computer teacher. Now, for our year book, one person was doing Superlatives (eg most likely to end up in jail, class flirt) and every one was being loud and noisy, and she didn't do a [insert swear word here] thing!!!!!! [insert a very long string of compund swears here]

When I was leaving school, I was talking to my friend Jake. We were talking about how stupid Ms. LaLazybutt was, ""Jake, do this, Jake do that,"" He actually said he hopes Mr. DeMathHockeyItalianTalkaboutDrinkninginReligionClass has a stroke over the vacation. But the good part is, we get out of school before our graduation, so we *should* be able to state our true feelings about them before we leave...... We can only hope.

Valentine's Day came and went, and I only sent one card, but the person seemed happy. Well, I have to go cool off, all this ranting has made me feel [insert an emotion here] 

Oh wait! I want to show you a really sad, and moving picture. Two, actually:

You've heard all this suff in the news about the priests, right? Well, I think I know who is to blame for all this: The Pope. If he would simply allow priests to get married, we wouldn't have to hear about this all the time.

"event","Good news: We got a description of the next trailer for Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith today:

(PLEASE NOTE: If you're avoiding spoilers, we advise you NOT to read on)

The trailer begins with the following exchange:

Palpatine: ""The Dark Side of the Force is the pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.""

Anakin: ""Is it possible to learn this power?""

Palpatine: ""Not from a Jedi.""

We are then introduced to the political maneuvering of Palpatine, Obi-Wan and Mace Windu. All of them actually want to use Anakin as a pawn in their game (Palpatine makes Anakin his ""personal representative on the Jedi Council"" while Obi-Wan wants him to ""report on all the Chancellor's dealings""). The first minute or so is surprisingly heavy on dialogue and consists mostly of shots of various characters speaking to each other (intercut with short glimpses of evil droids, space battles etc.). We even see how Mace Windu and three other Jedi attempt to arrest Palpatine (he grabs the lightsaber and confronts them). When Mace Windu tells Anakin ""You are on this council but we do not grant you the rank of Master"", Anakin loses it and joins the Dark Side (Sidious: ""Every single Jedi is now an enemy of the Republic""). At least that's how the trailer makes it look.

Then the more ""visual"" half starts with some very neat scenes like a low angle shot of Anakin marching in front of a Clone trooper army. We see Wookiees on some kind of war machine, the duel in the volcano field, gigantic 10-wheel military transports and actual destruction of the Senate chamber. Everything is very dramatic, several deaths are implied, Padme is seen crying loudly and music from the Emperor duel (ROTJ) is heard.

Overall, the first half of the trailer is surprisingly specific, making no sense whatsoever to people who don't know Star Wars well. The second half is very dark and dramatic, but with lots of action. Bad guys (apart from Sidious) only appear for a fraction of a second and have no lines. The final seconds consist of Obi-Wan shouting ""You were the chosen one!"", fighting Anakin while both dangle from some ropes/wires. After the closing titles, there is a bonus shot of Vader and Sidious standing side by side, accompanied by Vader's breathing.

This is a preliminary version with effects and sound not quite finalized. One part of the trailer is actually without music (either for dramatic effect or John Williams' new score will be inserted here?). The length is little under 2:30.

When further questioned about the ""evil droid"", our source confirmed that there wasn't a clear shot of General Grievous but there was one of the bodyguards:

There is some evil-looking humanoid droid with a cape around his head and torso, flanked by two classic battledroids (from Episode I). He seems to hold a lance in his hand. Later, Obi-Wan is seen swordfighting with a humanoid droid but he's only seen from back and moving quickly. (I'm 90% certain it IS Grievous, but it's extremely short and quick shot.) Anyway, both of these shots are VERY brief (about half second).

One of the shots depicts Obi-Wan being surrounded by dozens of droids. Some of them look different and wear capes, maybe one of them is Grievous. But it's very wide shot, the characters are small.

The Bad News:

It's not coming out untill March 11, with the film, ""Robots"" I suppose I could go see that on my B-Day, two days later. Although by then, I will probably already seen the trailer a thousand times (allience peeps)

The Good News:

Tomorrow is Friday!!!!!!!!!!!

The Bad News:

Progress reports tomorrow, with a possible grade for a Spanish quiz!

We got a new Mod Squad report for the JC forums today. Nothing to big. Well, The head admin banned 34 socks (for those of you unfamilar with board talk, a sock is an SN used by some one who is banned) of a very stubborn troll. Not only that, another Manager banned 98 SNs in one day, all from the same person. Talk about crazy!

Oh well. I do have plans to make plans with someone. I just don't know how I'm gonna do it though............

I'll tell you how it went in my next update.


BREAKING NEWS:

Hey people - JediOZtralia here from FOX in Sydney. GOt some groundbreaking news on the pre-production work we are doing at present on Episode III. 

Besides the Jedi Starfighter we have a new set piece design/construction. Ready for it................................. 


ROCKS............thats it people - excitement plus huh!!!! 

We have been issued a memo from pre-production saying MAKE ROCKS!!!!!! 

So off we go on monday morning to make all sorts of rocks. I dont know the colour yet but they must be different to the Geonosis rocks (light brown red ones from AOTC) because we are not usintg thoses. Me gets the impressions from the powers that be that we are making jagged broken rocks like crystal shards - nice and spikey. 

When we make one i'll take a digital snap and send it in (if I can get my camera out without anyone seeing!!!!)

"event","Finally. It's our first snow day in like four or five years. (Suspiciously the same amount of time that our math teacher and assistant principal has been at our school). Although it's a Snow day, I plan to spend part of the day studying, since I have a math test tomorrow. Not that I suck at math, oh wait, I do suck at math. Never mind. Now that I said that, I can move on.


This is Grievous, signing out, for now.

"event","Vacation was WAY too short. How can they expect you to relax for just a week and a half? Plus, once you finally start to sleep late, you have to get up early again! Not that it's a bad thing, getting up early to go to school, just, I suppose you could say, inconvenient. All you have to think is to your self is,""I only have to do thid for (fill in the blank) more years."" Does it work? Let me tell you when I find out. 

Have you ever tried to get a story published in a book? Well, I have, and it did get published. I thought it was a big achievemnet....... untill I saw some of the other stories that got published. For example, there was a story about someone's trip to FLorida. Just about every sentence started with the word, ""then."" How exciting was that? Not very. So when you get a story published, think to yourself,""Do I really want to publish a story in a book of stories, most of which were written by second graders, with bad grammar and even wrose spelling? I'm ont sure. It's probably one big scam. SOme people know what I mean ;). 

Have you ever seen a movie that you thought would be really good, then go see it, and be really dissapointed? Take Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events.  The books PWN3D just about every other book, save for Harry Potter, or Lord of the RIngs. But the movie stunk. Don't get me wrong, the movie was great. But as a movie based on a book, it STUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So I guess I could say, don't judge a movie by it's book!

Well, this is Grievous, signing off for now!

also not too sure about my psych class tomorrow either.. it'll probably go pretty bad if something which probably will.. don't really want to say too much on that now

tonight my aunt and uncle came over for dinner because it was her birthday. 
so that was nice we had a huge big dinner.. it was nice
and we had dessert too
apple/blueberry crumble.. yuumm

oh man, it's only half way through the semester and I'm craving summer and so excited for it already, this is not good.. 
it'll make the next 5 or 6 weeks go so much slower.. :(

eugh and the fact that we don't get a spring break AND didn't have a reading break (like every other university in the country!!) is terribly annoying..

because I have weds. totally free from school and work my mom and jen and I were going to go shopping in the states ..turns out I'm filling in for jordan manning's sister hannah (who was also hired with jen lately) and because they're on spring break they do 4 hour shifts so that means I have a 4 hr shift both weds so so much for that plan

that's okay though, I guess I'll go spend all my birthday moola on hollister and roxy stuff on like the 28th of march or something.

well it's a good thing I'm going to work on my essay tomorrow morning because I haven't worked on it today at all yet and looks like I may not even get to it tonight seems how it's 10 already.."

it was really nice
we hadn't actually talked in quite a long time
it was great to see her again
and hear what is/was going on in her life and such..

I've given up writing any more of my crim paper tonight.
tomorrow after work and at night it is..
and friday morning at school hopefully I can finish it

this weekend is the lose an hour of sleep weekend.. oh boy 
I'm looking forward to it being lighter at night though..and closer to summer
can't wait for summer oh man.
and that means tennis season is coming soon!
yay!

deanne's vday party is this weekend.. I wonder if I'll even know anyone there lol well except jen..and deanne of course
and leanne said she may come
are you going jimmy?

once I'm done this crim essay it's on to my psych essay, which means finding a copy of the latest DSM... oh boy won't that be fun.. I can get medical/psychology student syndrome all over again.

you have no idea how much I'm looking forward to summer .. lol no idea.. 
well okay, maybe you do.. I don't know. but seriously, I can't wait, it was so lovely today.. for like a few hours! it was awesome!!!!!!"

"event","who knows if I'm counting down right... I never know whether to count today or not..

so I'm still kind of stressing out about my crim 101 paper.  I mean it's an intro course and I'm freaking out, this is horrible.  It's so confusing.  I'm hoping to finish it by friday so I can have it printed at my dad's work and ready for next tuesday but at the rate I'm going who knows whether that'll happen.  Thankfully my friend in crim, Shane, is going to add me to msn and if I'm still stuck thursday he's going to help me out.  Hopefully I'll have a miraculous burst of knowledge or something by then though, that'd be nice.  

today was blahish.. well.. not totally I guess I shouldn't complain.  I just haven't been in the best of moods the past few days.. it's been a downish kind of past two days.  I think it's just a phase but I feel blahish and somewhat sad for some reason.  (I don't want to say depressed, because that's too extreme for what I'm feeling).. 

tomorrow should be nice, I get to sleep in and then I'm meeting ava for coffee, I haven't seen that girl in.. AGES!  It feels like it's been since like gr11 or something..

thursday is my aunt's bday so she's coming over for dinner, and.. then friday I'm going to go to school early.. be at the s-train at like 8.. as my mom needs to go to work .. that way I'll take my laptop and I'll be totally forced to work on my essay, and if I actually am able to finish it before my 12:30 class then I have the inet.. it's a brilliant plan really, except for the fact that I need to wake up at like 7:00.. yyyea, not too keen on that but hey, I'd rather get a ride to the skytrain than have to take the 312.. :S

anyways my nana stayed the night last night and she got sick so that wasn't cool but she's better now

"event","so today was a fun day off.. 
I slept in and then later leanne came over and we made the sequal to pillowman, episode 3, and also a tv interview with pillowman and pillowboy (jen helped out, playing the role of the reporter) 
it was really fun, and even though i'm sure people who don't know us would never appreciate the vids or the humour in them, we can, and that's all that matters.. 

two of the midterms marks are in. I actually did surprisingly well in abnormal psych which I didn't study for all that much.. an A- in terms of the curve they mark on in psych, so that's awesome. can't really say the same for crim however, as I didn't study really at all for it, which abnormal psych the day before and the switchfoot concert the night before.. but I passed, and I got like 70% so I guess that's not bad but I could've done better, I think he's still going to scale the marks too so it should only go up which will be better. 

kind of worried about cog. psych, at least I'm doing really really well so far in that class on the quizzes because the midterm was pretty brutal, I hope I passed.. 


I'm really liking my online course.. it's just so chill (haha can't believe I just typed that..anyways) and easier than going to a lecture and tutorial up the mtn every day and it's less work, although I'm sure the final will probably be much harder but who knows.. I wish I could do my whole 4 years online.. oh wouldn't that be lovely..avoid all the university presentations *sigh* 

I so can't wait for my birthday, you have no idea. I haven't seen people from high school in ages I can't wait to invite everyone out to a dinner or something just to get together and catch up, and plus I'll be 19!!! and even though I don't plan on drinking that's just awesome because .. well just because .. lol"

"event","so yesterday was baptisms at youth church.  8 people decided they wanted to publicly proclaim their love for Jesus and that they'd live their lives for Him. it was pretty awesome, I love witnessing baptisms, it's really encouraging and awesome to see people proclaim that and tell everyone what God has done in their lives.  

I also got two pieces of carrot cake after the baptisms.. mmmm.. 

anyways..

after the service like double the amount of people that normally go to wings went. I'd say there were like 40ish of us or something, it was an insane amount we took up half the restaurant.. and turns out I knew 3 other people in the restaurant too so it was kind of weird.. I think there were like 10 people in there I'd never seen before lol.

people from yc vancouver stopped by too and leanne was there, which was cool.  I haven't seen her in a long time so it was nice to see her.  I also talked with and met a bunch of people.. some I had met before but had forgotten names and such and some completely new people so that was good.  simon kept saying he was going to make me highland dance on the table or the bar in there because he missed my performance on the silverstar trip but we left before he remembered..so that was good lol

got home at like 11:30.. apparently my father was not happy as jen had school early this morning... ooo well, he was asleep when we got in and he seems to be okay with it now lol.

today... I had my crim tutorial and I asked a rather obvious question just for the sake of speaking in class..so that was good. got my participation marks at least and a bit of practice with public speaking.  then I finished my crim 131 readings in my break and had my 3 hour ab. psych lecture.  I left at 5 though because I was so tired and didn't want to sit through the discussion of the video.. plus it was insanely snowing when I got up there this morning so I was worried I may not get down the mtn. turns out it stopped snowing so that was good.  

that's about it I guess.."

I'm pretty confident that I'll do better on this one than the others but at the same time I don't want to be too confident as there are many complicated studies and names of researchers to know in cog. psych so it's a little nerve wracking.

tomorrow night youth church is having a Texas Games Night, with many games and a texas hold 'em poker tourney with the grand prize being an ipod!  I doubt I'll win against all the poker pros going but oh well.. I borrowed a whole bunch of cool western clothes and a cowboy hat and stuff from deen today and I tried the stuff on and I look so cute in it! so I'm going to dress western for it hopefully others do too..

"event","so yea didn't really study all that much this weekend for midterms.. that was probably not a good thing.

I worked saturday then I went to a friend's to watch a movie.. then sunday church in the morning and yc at night, plus boston pizza afterwards.. 

so I basically only studied during the week, a tiny bit for abnormal psych friday night (because who wants to study on a friday night..) and then a bit of crim and psych sunday afternoon.

I think I did okay with the psych yesterday but crim today.. who knows really.  fortunately I'm pretty sure I passed.. just it could be a almost didn't kind of midterm but oh well.. I just need to pass my courses and I'll be happy.

2 down, one more to go.  cognitive psychology friday, and tomorrow and thursday are my days off so then I can just study all day.. (haha.. yea right) annnyways.. got my 2nd cognitive psych quiz back and I got 100%!! right now I must be at like 90% in that course, unfortunately the midterm will bring me down..

speaking of cognitive psych, today I passed my prof for it in the hall and he like smiled at me and like looked like he was going to stop and talk to me but I kept walking, it was awkward because I always sit in the back so I doubt he would know I'm in his class and I've never talked to him.. so it was weird I was wondering if I had like a ""I'm in psych 221"" stick on my forehead or something.

well I guess it's about time to get ready to go to work. yay!
I don't think I'm working 5 days a week anymore though so that's good.  I'm back to 8hrs right now, which is nice, even though I liked the more money lol.

it's jen's first day today.. that should be interesting."

yea just wanted to test this out for fun, because like I would put this up on my myspace.. lol actually maybe I will I haven't decided yet, but I need something to do.. I'm not tired yet.. 

so today was good.. had 4 hours of cognitive psych.. 2 hour lecture and 2 hour midterm review session right after, oh well wasn't so bad. luckily I can sleep in saturdays now though as I work 12-4, so that's good.

deanne's vday party is cancelled tomorrow.. oh well, I guess I'll just have to actually get hitting the books for midterms

abnormal psych monday + switchfoot,... so excited!
then intro to crim tuesday and finally cog. psych friday.

totally forgot to wear red to work today.. I was the only one of the staff who didn't .. oh well, talked a lot today again, t'was weird and very good.

went to MTI college this morning, they were doing half hour presentations today.. it was alright, everyone was very nice and outgoing. I felt comfortable, and I think I could be able to do presentation in a small class like that.. only problem is I still don't know whether I want to take this course and pay 10,000 for it if it's not going to get me a worthwhile job...

"event","oh dearie me, what an exhausting weekend..

it seriously is so tiring to relax and just hang out all weekend.  no homework, no work, no sleep.. hmm no sleep..maybe that's why I'm so tired lol

silverstar was pretty amazing.  even though I didn't really do much of anything it was really awesome because I feel as if I was forced to get out of my little comfort zone a bit more, and I talked with lots of people, made some new friends, and have, maybe even, gained more confidence in myself?  I didn't have to do the jar of death, thankfully, even though the shaw brothers were totally out to get me on that.. 

I did however lose a game of crazy eight countdown (because keneisha and vicky ganged up on me..) and therefore had to highland dance on a table at lunch sunday.. not that bad really, only thing I can really do with confidence in front of a large group of people.. (only down side to is they taped it.. not looking forward to seeing it..)

we did ""speed dating"" on the bus. I always love those types of things because you're totally forced to talk to someone, it's so much easier for me.. because if it's awkward it's okay because you both feel awkward lol but most of the time it's not even awkward.

on the way home last night we watched The Guardian with kevin costner and ashton kutcher.. I absolutely loved it!  it was so good, oh man.  I think I need to rent it again lol.

one of the highlights of sat. was after dinner danica, laura and I went up to laura's room and just hung in there for awhile talking about insecurities and praying and talking about youth church and how it's affected us and what God is teaching us and yea it was just really great because we all got a chance to pray for each other and ""bond""/

oh yea, and I totally had to get over my fears friday before we even left the church because I got there and there was only me, danica, laura, and amanda standing there and then this guy I had met before at wings came and sat over by himself waiting for everyone else to get there, and I mean he has tons of friends at yc but he was just sitting there alone while we were all talking so I finally just went over and talked to him.  it was a huge thing for me because I totally freak out doing things like that but I felt led to and I thought it would be totally rude if I didn't seems how we've met before, and yea it was just crazy that I actually did it and yea.. 

today I actually wasn't that tired, and am not right now either, could be because I just had some iced tea.. but anyways.. got to school early this morning and saw briggs asleep on a bench, debated and decided to wake him up lol..

saw a few other people today too that I knew from other classes and talked with them.

today was just sort of amazing for me.. I mean in crim we played jeopardy and I ended up calling out like 15 answers in front of everyone and I didn't even care if I was getting them wrong or that I was even talking.. I think after this weekend I'm just beginning to slowly get more comfortable and confident in myself. 
I even noticed it at work today as some (I believe) mentally challenged guy came up and asked really loudly where he could find a certain book, usually I'd get embarrassed about that but it didn't even phase me, I just told him where he needed to go and yea, it's just weird, and amazing.

God is amazing."

it's going to be so weird working with my sister though, and we're apparently not allowed to go away at the same time if nobody else can cover for us lol

I think I've packed everything for this weekend. it's scary I hate packing, I always worry that I've forgotten something.  I think I've got everything though.  I hope so.  I hope it's not super cold up there because I didn't bring all that much that's super warm or anything.  I packed extreme days for the bus of course, don't know whether I'll torture everyone by making them watch it or not lol  brock brought up how pathetic and horrible it was sunday out of nowhere.. I don't care it's still my fav lol

I'm also bringing cards so we can play them and mofia.. yay! it was fun on the grad trip, we played for like.. 4 hours straight seriously, it was intense and insane!

I think I'm going to take my online course assignment up tomorrow though, it's due tomorrow and it can be mailed as long as it is postmarked today but I think I might as well save a few cents and just take it up there..

it'll only take me like an hour and fifteen minutes anyways.. 
then work 3-5..

I picked up more shifts.. mondays till they hire someone else so that means I'm working, mondays, tuesdays, wednesdays, thursdays and saturdays until they hire some more pages..

today.. I woke up sooo early to get a ride to surrey central, got to school way too early.. like an hour and a half early, finished my readings for abnormal psych, and struggled with the EASY sudoku in today's 24 hrs.. then had crim, saw ashlee gau going in again, shane was there this time so that's good, he was sick last week so at least I know he wasn't avoiding me lol..

after that I went to cog. psych, the tutorial was good, I got my quiz from last day back which I was really scared about because she said we all did pretty bad.. but I got 9/10.. so yea, I was happy.. it's hard stuff I'm really worried about that course in general.

after that I was walking to the 145 bus and ashlee was in front of me again so we bussed and skytrained it home together.  we both went to surrey central though because my mom was still there working so I waited there for a bit longer till she was done then we went home. drove her boss with the scottish accent home too.. then I went to work, work actually went pretty fast today so that's good.

I was so looking forward to sleeping in as much as I could tomorrow but oh well I have thursday and friday I guess..to prepare for the weekend.

speaking of which next wed. I don't get to sleep in either.. I have to go sit in on a class at MTI college and be there at 8.. lovely. 

on the bright side by thursday I should have all my readings for next week done so then I can study this weekend if I have the time up there, and study all next week and the week after for midterms. yay!

kim came last night and jen's friends from school, they come every once in awhile though but they haven't been in awhile so jen was pleased they were there..

and turns out melissa kuntel coaches bball at PA, so she brought her team and claire antrim was there.. crazy, so we saw mahlon after he was quite surprised to see ppl he knew.. 

after yc we went to java and hung out.. then took a detour home.. it was an accident on my part but we got a nice little scenic tour of fraser heights lol..

yesterday morning I went to church and I was with ross, mark and brock and nobody wanted to go into the service so we sat out talking, I was annoyed because I really wanted to be in there! then at the end of the service aron comes out and says he was up there by himself for like half the service.. I was like great, I thought he may have been up there but who wants to walk up there and go in and there's nobody there..so oh well good thing I have yc at nights.. 

today I didn't talk in my crim tutorail I was going to but then some girl stole what I was going to say.. I did sort of participate in the activity though so I hope I got some participation marks for this week...

during my 2 hour break I actually managed to finish my cog. psych readings for next week so I don't need to worry about that this weekend..
which reminds me I get my cog. psych quiz mark tomorrow.. I think I did pretty bad.. :S I'm scared.  

then I had my three hour abnormal psych lecture.. my gum still had flavour at the end! it was amazing.. lol nnneways..

last day of school this week tomorrow, thankfully.. I have to leave early though and get dropped off at surrey central and take the s train.. that'll be different..

I'm excited about silverstar this weekend.. a little nervous too but more excited so I hope it all goes well

 I don't think I'll have any homework, so then if I'm bored I can just study which means I will technically have two weeks to study for my midterms .. yay! lol

vicky wants me to help her study for her psych midterm up there..

there's this guy who was in my psych class last semester and he's in both of mine this semester and he reminds me so much of matt thiessen from relient k it's funny.. neways just though I'd throw that out there.. 

that's probably about it, time to go read about somatoform disorders and dissociative disorders..yay"

too much homework and stuff to do this weekend, it's overwhelming.

I have to write an essay for my online course that is on a topic that is next weeks chapter of readings, which means I need to read that chapter, and it's also on week 7 and 8's lectures.. so I need to go three weeks ahead and listen to those also to complete this. and it's due wed. lovely.

on the bright side I've mostly finished all the other stuff, just need to read two more chapters of psych and crim, then of course finish the essay.  

on the even brighter side two days of school this week.. monday and tuesday. skipping friday's class because SILVERSTARR!!!! yay! I'm excited even though I'm not boarding it should be a good chance to get away and make some new friends.  Jen can't go anymore so that's a little dissappointing.  on her bright side she has another interview at the library thursday.. 

speaking of which I was informed at work today that balvir my boss is being transfered back to south delta which means francis will be the new boss.. things are changing there in the staff quite a bit lately..

"event","wait a second isnt it like groundhog day soon or something.. or is that a different month?
annyways, it's february that's exciting.. closer to the end of this semester..and closer to my bday.

turns out there's a barn bingo luncheon at yc my bday.. I hope I can get someone to work for me that day because who wants to work on their bday..?!

today I worked, and I didn't go to MTI either.. slept in instead. now I'm taking a break from reading, watching reba, doing this and talking to meghan on msn.  multi-tasking.. yup.

so glad tomorrow is friday.. unfortunately I have to do my first online assignment which is an essay and it's due wed. so yea.. need to work hard on that this weekend. and see if garima can fill in for my next weekend.. I must remember to phone her.

other than that nothing much is exciting or worth mentioning in my life.. so yea that's it I guess."

anyways.. today was quite unthrilling.. I sat alone in my crim lecture today as it appears shane, the handkisser, wasn't there.. unless he was avoiding me..lol but I didn't see him there.. we watched a video on charles manson.. creepy.. then I had my first cognitive psych quiz. I think it went okay.. just okay.

took the skytrain all the way to king george today on the way home so that it was easier to get a ride, that was interesting..

there is so much to do at work lately, just losing one person makes a huge difference to the amount of stuff to be done!  there is still a fiction trolley and a non-fiction trolley to be done that I didn't get to today, plus they'll add stuff by the time I get there tomorrow, and I'm the first one there.. at least I don't have to worry too much because I think garima is in later at night but it's stressful whern there is a lot to do..

I was supposed to go to MTI and sit in on a class tomorrow morning but my mom is working and taking the car so I rescheduled for thursday morning at 9:30.. I'll go sit in and then ask about job salaries and whatnot I guess.. 

so yea, life is interesting.."

"event","so youth church was okay last night, melissa came and sat with jen and I.. probably because we were sitting alone in the back, but I didn't want to sit up front with everyone else.. I don't like the front..  I really must get over that though.. sitting in the back like loners isn't always fun..

so anyways.. then at the end I helped Danica put out the snacks, nachos, and then after yc we went to wings again. apparently they like go every sunday because of the special.  I don't think I could afford that lol but yea, this time there were like 25 ppl or something. I met some new people, well not new people, but people I had never formally met before.. and yea it was good.

I didn't buy anything though as I had spent like 40 dollars on dinners this weekend already so I just had a water and sat there and forced myself to talk with people a bit, it's hard when the music is so loud in there though, but oh well it wasn't too bad.

today I saw sophia (I think that's her name) from my bible study at school so we talked for a bit then I had my crim tutorial, and we did a partner activity and yea.. we had to present it to the class but me and my partner I guess we didn't really understand how in depth we had to go with the topic so she was like grilling us for answers and more info and we had no clue what we were talking about, it was embarrassing so I hope we still get all our participation marks.. 

after that I had my two hour break in which I finished my cog. psych readings and ate lunch and then I had my 3 hour abnormal psych lecture. I sat on the other side of the lecture hall in the back section this time because I didn't want to have to sit beside that 40ish man again and he went and sat where I always did.  I felt kind of bad because I'm sure he probably saw me in the back but oh well.. I didn't like sitting that close to the front anyways.. 

it's official.. I am never spending money ever again in my life.. aside from the fact that I have to pay for school.. *sigh*"

"event","yea I saw you too sara! I was like hey it's sara and dan!! so then I waved like a mad fool thinking you wouldn't see me and I'd just look crazy but you did so I was pleased lol I would have come over to say hi but then we were leaving and I didn't want to be left behind as I had no clue where everyone was going..

so it's been a crazy weekend so far.  knowing I was going to white rock with nadine saturday night (last night) to meet the guys from jubilee I wanted to go down to mission's fest friday night, so after I got home from school jen and I hopped on the 312 and as we got to the skytrain station leanne called so she decided to join us.  we had an interesting experience with 4 drunk older (like late 40ish) men who were going to the hockey game though, it was awkward and bad.. they were hitting on us when they had daughters are age and younger.. sick.. annyways.. we got down there bought tickets for the youth rally, and quickly wandered down a few of the booth rows.. then we went to go into the rally and saw randall from yc, and then sarah seage came out and like let him in so maybe he didn't have to pay or something but she said we could sit with them so we did. simon mc'd, one of the BC lions talked (and now he'll be coming to youth church sometime) and then this scottish guy talked.  he was a really good speaker, funny but at the same time.. shall I say quite inspirational? at the end of the rally I saw cheddy, I was going to wave but he looked away so I don't think he saw me.. then we saw calin (and of course I saw sara and dan) but other than that and aron's little bro and some of calin's friends.. nobody else I knew.. 

so after the rally we went upstairs to check out where the young adults rally would be saturday night, and the room was quite small compared to the halls.. I wonder if they fit everyone in there? I wish I could've gone, yc was doing worship and apparently it was awesome.  but instead I went to white rock to hang out.. more about that later.  after we checked the room out we all went for late night sushi. it was fun, then we skytrained home when I had to go to the bathroom so bad.. I hate that lol but the sushi place had horrible washrooms, they were disgusting I was standing in water and.. stuff :S  got home about 1:15 or so.. went to the bathroom lol and went to sleep.

yesterday morning (sat.) I went to work 10-2, then came home ate, showered, and nadine picked me up and we headed out to matt from the young adult's retreat's house.. at first it was a bit awkward.. well it wasn't that bad but like there was only me nadine matt and josh at first and so we just talked, then mark and ewing came and then mike and kendra came.. mike and kendra didn't go on the retreat but apparently they were on the six flags grad trip with us so that was cool.  so then once everyone was there we went to boston pizza for dinner, then after that we went back to matt's and played this flicky game which was fun, me and mark won the ""tourny"", then we went out in the backyard and roasted marshmellows and sat aruond the fire they made in matt's firepit.. then we went inside and watched the kevin costner robin hood.. it's sooo long man lol we got home at about 1:45ish or so.. it was so foggy driving home on the freeway man, there was this guy driving like 40 an hour lol maybe he didn't even know he was on the freeway, it was like impossibly to know where you were if you didn't.. lol

so anyways.. didn't end up having to do sunday school this morning so I slept in and will go to youth church tonight of course so that'll be my church for the day.  I must go do some reading..so that is all."

"event","today I went with my mom to MTI community college in whalley.  I really like it.  it's the same program that douglas has but it only takes 10 months to complete.  the classes are about 12 ppl each and there's lots of group presentations, and a few individual ones. the instructor is really nice though she said if I can't do them I can do them just in front of her, but if I did go there I think I'd want to do them in front of everyone and practice and stuff.. or at least try.  it's a lot closer than SFU and it's only from 8:15-11:45 every morning for 10 months.  apparently the instructor pays for our practicums, and sets us up with something we'd want to do too(for me I'd want to work with teen girls, like at a pregnancy center or something..) and most ppl get a job at their practicum, if not they have a person who faxes your resumee to all these jobs and looks for the jobs you want for you then helps you prepare for an interview.  it sounds really good but I really have to think about it.  is this what I want to really do? and will the salary be worthwhile and having the diploma make any difference? or could I work the same jobs without the diploma?  either way next wednesday I'm going to go and sit in on a class.. the program starts up every month so I could start whenever I wanted basically too
and only having 3 hours a day would make time for a circ assistant job if another one comes up..

as for the rest of today.. I went to work, and I watched Beauty and the Geek (skipping C&C again.. and the guest speaker) and I watched American Idol too and did some reading .. yup, that's it.

I'm so glad I don't have school tomorrow..

oh yea and somehow I ended up embarrassing myself AGAIN.. *sigh*"

"event","I'm really annoyed with myself as of late.

I seem to find everything I do so embarrassing lately and I get upset with myself for doing whatever it was.. most of which is uncontrollable, and I don't stop thinking about how embarrassed and bad I feel about it.. until another situation like it happens, then that one takes over.. I mean it's great that I have the other one out of my mind but I don't want to worry about this one anymore either. *sigh*

plus, I'm having added sleep troubles at night lately probably due to this anxiety.. grr! simon's talk was on fear sunday, I went back for prayer.. I think it helped though, I talked in my crim tutorial yesterday two times.. I would never talk at all in tutorials last semester, and even this semester I was reluctant before...

today I saw ashlee gau and actually talked to her between classes, then at the skytrain I saw her again so we rode home together, it was cool.  

then I went to work, there was sooo much to do :S and it was so messy everywhere.. eugh and I'm filling in tomorrow (and every wednesday till they hire some people) and then I work thursday too .. should be..fun

I looked into the douglas program and nancy said there is lots of group presentations, I'm thinking it won't be so bad though because you go through with about 20 of the same ppl for the whole program.. 2 years for the diploma and another two to be certified. my mom found the apparently same program at MTI across from sfu surrey and it only takes 10months apparently, they do group presentations too but 10 months? it seems too good to be true.. probably not the exact same program or way expensive. either way my mom made an appointment for me and her to go up there tomorrow before work and ask some questions.

oh yea and now I can't go to mission's fest anymore which I was super excited about at yc was going and doing the young adults rally worship, because the jubilee ppl want to get together in white rock instead.. :( oh well..*sigh*
simon and lewis were going to mc the youth one friday night.. maybe I'll just sneak into that one.. 

that's it. I guess."

but it just broke my heart and it didn't even involve me.. I just hope it's not true.. but that's all I can say on that.. but do not worry it is about no one on here so nobody need worry.. 

so matt couldn't meet this weekend so the jubilee reunion is postponed till next weekend.. poor deen was so excited for it.  as was I. oh well next weekend hopefully everyone will be able to get together.. just found out annika actually lives just down the street from aron which is weird seems how I thought she lived in white rock.

uh what happened this weekend? not too much, jen had ian shaw and emily ellis from yc over last night, and as I had to work extra early this morning decided to be lazy and do nothing.  today I worked, then went for coffee with nadine.. then we went to visit my nana and went to mcdonald's which I am still feeling.. it's gross lol..uh that's about it.. just got back..

I do nothing on weekends.. it's kind of sad but when I have work saturday mornings and church sunday mornings I really don't feel like doing much.. wed. and thursdays are more my weekends now.. like last tuesday and sushi.. it was like my friday night.  but I'm back to the not caring about how I sit at home on weekends anymore.. like I used to enjoy and not care about having no social life on weekends until I had one every weekend.. now I'm back to being content just sitting around, doing reading, etc.  I still do stuff every once in awhile but it's cool because I don't really mind when I have nothing to do and I don't' take the stuff I do do for granted anymore.

I talked to nancy at sushi about the child and youth counselling program at douglas, apparently all you do is presentations and talking, there are mostly group ones and there's only like 20 ppl in the class that you're all together for the whole 4 years but that still turns me off the program.. now I have no clue what I'll do with me life.. yup."

yesterday I got called at 9:30 in the morning and was asked to help out with sunday school as ppl were not able to make it so I went and did that.. 

then went to yc of course, and went early to set up the table but amanda pretty much already did it so then I just went and hung out with this huge group of ppl. it was good because I actually talked infront of them all.. I told them about the handkisser lol they think I should go for him.. yyyyea lol nneways..

got my pic taken a few more times for the yc album and the service was good, I went to the back as support for jen and then after we had a snowboard retreat meeting in which 3 ppl heard anything and told everyone else..

then we went home.

today.. I had my first crim 101 tutorial.. at first I was kind wondering if i'd be the only white person in the class, even my ta wasn't.. but there's another girl so at least I don't feel totally out of it or anything, it doesn't even bother me (it's not like I'm racist or anything..) it's just that at sfu certain races seem to clump together.. but we did ice breakers and group work and it was actually good 

then I spent 2 hours doing nothing.. which was pretty boring.. then I had my abnormal psych lecture.. all 3 hours of it..
it wasn't that bad but it was awkward when this like 40ish guy sat two desks away from me and during the break tried to talk to me.. because I talked a bit but then he just didnt say anything more and yea.. awkward..

then I had to fill in today because from the sounds of it someone at work was layed off. which is pretty sad for them but it may mean jen could have a job, so I guess that's a nice thing if it actually happens.. 

now I'm here, and I think I'll finish my reading and go watch the end of the golden globes..

oh and tomorrow night I was invited to go downtown for late night sushi with a whole bunch of the young adults from yc so we'll see how that goes.. a little bit nervous but excited.. and tomorrow is crim with the handkisser so we'll see how that goes too lol"

well.. slept in again, went to work 1-3, now I'm back here, doing nothing.

I'll have to read chapter 1 for my intro to crim later but other than that that's about it for today's homework.

I'm glad I only have a lecture tomorrow.. I get to sleep in again and go for 2 hours and leave before the hectic friday rush hour starts.. it's brilliant. love this schedule.

I'm a little worried about my online course though, I was supposed to have posted my online discussion question answers yesterday night but I couldn't figure out where to post it and nobody in my group has even posted a hello in our forum yet.. (only me) so I msged my tutor-marker and she hasn't gotten back to me yet.. I hope she'll be lenient for the first week if we post them a couple of days later...

apparently I have to actually talk in my tutorials this semester.. I get marks for it.. how unfortunate.. I hate participation marks.. I've decided each class I will think of a question and that way I won't have to talk talk.. just ask a question lol..

I hope I have nice ppl in my tutorials.. :S

today there was absoultely like nothing to do when I got to the library.. I did half a juvenille trolley, and then all the little trolleys and then I shelve read for an hour and a half.. it was thrilling.. and I bent back a nail doing it! ouch, it was painful.

I'm not looking forward to the commute tomorrow though, too cold and wet and snowy and long I'm sure.. 

apparently ppl were stranded up at SFU last night, that's no fun.. I'm glad I didn't have to go to school yesterday..

nadine was talking with matt from the college&career/young adults retreat last night and apparently we're all going to hang out next saturday.. me, her, him and a few of the other white rock guys, I think he said something about having a bonfire at someone's house out there.. that'd be cool..

oh and I'm so excited because switchfoot is actually playing creation this year and rk of course will also be there so I'm so going this year, yc always goes so I can go with them.. and meghan and her family will be down there, it'll be awesome!!  it'll be my.. 4th time seeing switchfoot lol"

I didn't have my psych lab today so my lecture was shortened and I got to come home early..

I think I'll listen to my first crim 131 lecture at 2 though..  then work 5-7..

I saw ashlee gau today, her class (the one I was waitlisted on) is in the same lecture hall as mine right before.. I'll have to tell her that next sunday because she didn't see me, I was too far away at the time.

I didn't go to the hospital or the doctors but sarah said she bruised one coughing before and it sounds like what I have..
it still hurts though.. :(

grimace came to church yesterday and we did communion and he's never been to a church other than youth church so he didn't know how to do communion so he took the bread and ate it right there and I was like GRIMACE! and he's like well thanks for the heads up.. it was pretty funny

I did my first setting up of the youth church tshirt/cd table.. but I didn't do much of it because I didn't know how I should set it up so next time I'll know how sarah wants it to look and stuff which is good

after yc it was java night so we went to java hut, then we got invited to go with a bunch of ppl to wings. they had a 39 cent wings deal (that they apparently have every sunday) it was cool though, I've never been there before, the wings were really good too! and it ended up being pretty affordable if you share with ppl. we ended up sitting at the end of the table which we didn't know any one at really but there was this really nice guy who talked to us the whole time which was cool, he's one of the Ellis'.. Emily's cousin. he was really nice, and Maddison sat with us too and she's always entertaining and talking and such so that was good. we didn't get home till like 11:30 last night though, which wasn't good because if my dad had known he'd be mad as it was a school night.

luckily I didn't have to wake up till like 11 today though, because I didn't have my crim tutorial this first week. so today it was just my abnormal psych lecture instead. it was pretty good, just 2 hours today.. next week it'll be the almost 3 hours.. but it doesn't sound like it'll be that boring so that's good. my prof actually used to have social anxiety and a fear of public speaking so I think he should be able to relate to me. tomorrow I don't have my cognitive psych lab just my intro to crim lecture so I get to come home much earlier before work. and hopefully veronica mars is a new one tomorrow too..

then wed and thursday are my off days, woo hoo.. I can work on my online course and go to work thursday 1-3 and then sleep in both days, oh it'll be lovely seems how I never get to sleep in on weekends anymore.

last night I got my pic taken once to be on the yc website by vicky and then randall came around and was going to take another one of us but jen apparently wasn't smiling so he had to wait for her to smile then he pressed the button and the battery died.. so I guess I only have one shot at getting a pic on the site.. hopefully that pic looked good then lol

I'm already probably behind in my readings, as profs like you to read the chapter for the week before the lecture, but unless you assume that's chapter one there's no way of knowing whether that's the one for this week because they hand out the readings lists during the first lecture.. oh well.. I'm almost through my abnormal psych readings.. just a few more pages, then half the chapter left for crim 131.. then I guess I should start on chapter 2 for abn. and probably start the first chapters in my other courses.. *sigh*

melissa kuntel can't go on the snowboarding trip anymore (she wasn't going to board) but apparently danica is going and not boarding anymore so that's good at least I know of one other person who'll be hanging in the lodge all weekend.. that'd be not cool if it was just me..

worked 4 hours thursday, and 4 hours today.. 

went to get my books wednesday, got them all and ended up spending like 320 or something on them, eugh.

I had Elizabeth and Kim Hait over last night, it was good to catch up. we talked for hours and watched the Lake House, it's not a bad movie.. Keanu Reeves isn't a good actor though lol.. oh well, I liked the plot, it was cool and made me think..

so then I came home from work today and I've had what I thought was a pulled muscle down under the bottom of my rib cage from coughing and I coughed really hard and I felt it like pop down there or something and intense pain, and I mean intense pain!!  it's been killing me since like 3 o'clock it's pretty bad, we're wondering if I cracked a rib which is possible from harsh coughing.. I may have to go for an xray if it doesn't get better soon. hopefully it's just a bruise or a pulled muscle or something.. but it's harsh pain!!!

I hope it gets better soon it hurts to breathe and move etc.

so then, I had said I would go to yc vancouver's bingo night to see leanne and contribute to their fundraiser and yea, that was alright, not many ppl there at all and because they were all the vancouver leaders I didn't realloy know them all that well so it was sort of awkward but jen and I sat with sarah stitch and lewis talked to us and kyle and leanne of course so that was cool.. we didn't win anything though, it was sad but oh well..

grimace wants to come to gracepoint tomorrow.. that should be interesting. hopefully it'll be a good service lol

grad year/starting university, it was a year of many changes for me.  I decided to try out a new youth group, my church's so that I'd have friends to sit with on sundays, turns out that was a great thing for me.  I met tons of friends who I talk to every sunday and can sit with, and the great thing is I didn't just make friends with one of the two groups in the youth group (sr. high) I made friends with both the groups, and the two actually became one for the last few months of youth, it was seriously a great thing to see everyone hang out and get along, and no clickyness between the two.  

God sure gave and took away this year however, I'd prayed during the summer for some cool guy friends, because I'd never really found any cool guys that I was actually great friends with, and suddenly I had quite a few from youth but I was always hanging out with them like every day of every weekend, even some school nights and although at the time it was really cool, God gives and takes away, and as 2006 came to an end, and the school year ended I've found I don't hang out with them so much.  I still see them however every once in awhile and so that is good, but I know that God has also began to give again, as I brang in the new year with a number of new friends at youth church and have been becoming friends with some of the guys there too.

that's another great thing about 2006.  youth church.  I am seriously so glad graham told us about it and asked jen to go that one time because I'm addicted now. it went from him, jen, me and sometimes aron to like seriously 12-14 ppl heading out every week and now we're back down to like me, and jen basically, and every once in awhile a few others, which is always super cool.  

other major highlights/and or events of 2006: grad definately (was one of the best nights of my life, so much fun to be dressed up fancy and looking really pretty and just relax and have a blast dancing with all my school friends) 
the youth church young adults/gracepoint/white rock college and career retreat-80s dance (another one of the best nights of my life.. meeting and dancing with wr guys and hanging out on the docks at night haha.. it seems lamish now but at the time it was like it was out of the movies..) 
new years eve (the rave dance, again, did not fail to be another awesome dance party, I got a chance to make a complete fool out of myself dancing like a retard, which I'm trying not to regret, and I, as at the other dance party, broke out of my comfort zone and had a blast, and talked to many people, and made some new friends) 
my 18th birthday party (painting the youth room, dinner dressed fancy at mickey d's and then having all my friends over to my house just to hang, it was fun because I've never had such a big party before..)
starting school at sfu (not a highlight, lol, but a major event, that may come to an end half way through 2007, one doesn't know for sure yet.. trusting God is the key here)
switchfoot concert (seriously, what more can be said, seeing your favourite band for the second time with a few old and new friends and getting super close to tim with amazing pics!!)
relient k concert (again, second favourite band.. and having meghan come over for it, and going with kim and victoria, and a few others.. amazing, and the rocket summer too.. just great)
equip 06 at youth church (putting on a free carnival for the people of whalley/guildford was totally awesome, it was so fun and just to see how much everyone appreciated the carnival, and the smiles on the kids faces was awesome, and spending the whole weekend learning how to reach out to others and worshipping and with sumo suits, etc was so much fun, and I met tons of great people)

I'm not afraid of change anymore after this year though. I was always so afraid of it, afraid of making new friends, of going to new schools, new youth groups, new churches, making new friends.  I would try super hard to keep things in my life safe, and unchanged, but when the changes were all forced on me this year, they turned out great, and I'm so thankful for that, it's taught me I can trust God with my life and that even when He gives and takes away, His plan is perfect."

simon talked about new year's resolutions last night, a few of these came to mind when we were praying and such..some of them are my own from before..I tried to make them specific so I can measure their success and actually do them but some of them are too general.. hopefully I'll be able to stick to all of them though."

"event","got back from gig harbor/fox island last night at about 10ish. I drove from tualip to belingham.. 120km.. fastest I've ever had to drive ..and for an hour straight, it's very tiring.. especially in the dark.

the visit was nice, we watched a couple of movies.. john tucker must die and the princess diaries 2 haha.. and we did tons of shopping.. went to tacoma mall and got hollister and american eagle stuff. then we went to ross the next day and I seriously love tacoma's ross we always find roxy, billabong, and american eagle things for cheap.  last year I found a couple of roxy tees for 6 american and this year I found a really nice roxy zip hoodie for 20..

other than shopping we pretty much just hung out but it was fun, lots of pics and stuff which was fun too.

today I went to the clinic.. the first two we went to were closed so we went to the one by blockbuster, in little india,, and everyone stared at us when we went in lol.. we felt a little awkwardly out of place.. oh well I got 3 prescriptions.. I have to take flonase.. :S and a puffer full of powdered meds and an antibiotic.  turns out this cold I've had for the past three weeks is a sinus infection and a bit of broncitis too..lovely

I think it's getting better though.

I'm looking forward to tomorrow night now, but I'm also getting pretty worried about it.. last dance was so much fun but this one will be way different..I hope it goes okay at least..."

"event","so I'm bored.. just thought I'd let you all know..

I've overeaten today, yesterday and the day before, as usual I've received WAY too much candy, and chocolate and there's still numerous amounts of cookies, pies, and other baked goods sitting in the kitchen, it seems that's all I eat.. breakfast, lunch, dinner etc. 

tomorrow we're headed to gig harbor though so I guess that'll be nice for a few days. although I'm still sick. 

my switchfoot cd didnt make it before christmas so hopefully it comes tomorrow.. I hope.

I'm so tired but not.. you know? like I'm really bored and tired but yet I still want to sit here and just do absolutely nothing but keep trying to find something to entertain me on my computer.

my little cousin samantha is so cute. I'm glad we saw them this christmas., didn't get to see my cousin jeremy and his kids though, I miss josiah and maddy.. they're so adorable.. 

christmas eve was good.. not as awkward as normal, I actually talked with cousins and their significant others more than usual.. 

christmas wasn't bad either.. my nana stayed overnight then my aunt and uncle came over. and their two dogs.. was good.. 

then my nana went home today and I watched my pride and prejudice dvd set.. 6hrs long..I got the BBC one with colin firth, I love it way more than the new one and was surprised to get it but thrilled.. I also got lots of candy, tons of chocolate, quite a few gift certificates for various things like starbucks, the beauty salon, subway, rogers, etc.. I got my switchfoot cd which like I said hasn't arrived, and I got 2 american eagle shirts, they're quite nice, I also got 50 dollars from my nana to spend when we go to washington tomorrow.. hollister clothes most likely lol.. jen got me a cool makeup kit, which I was in need of, and yea.. that's about it I think.. oh yea, socks and underwear lol.. 

yup, so I've been informed we're leaving at 9 am tomorrow.. lovely.. 

sarah called today.. why am I always so awkward on the phone? I hate phone calls.. I took jen to get a coffee for a friend and then she dropped it and a card, and gift off for him and she spilt his coffee all over me in the car, so then I didn't go into rogers with her to get the movie but she came out and said they needed an 18 year old in there to rent it.. so then I went in and because only my mom and bro have accounts I wasn't allowed to rent the video either.. it was annoying to say the least..

i still feel really sick and I'm boiling right now.. maybe this 2 week cold is turning into a flu.. gosh, if it'd just go away so I could have at least one week before school to relax and enjoy myself..

we're coming home friday, so the bright side is I don't have to work saturday.. or any other day this week for that matter.. but after new years that week I'm sure will be filled with visits up to campus to buy and exchange books.. which i'm not looking forward to but at least I only have 3 days a week to go up to campus this semester.. 

I just want summer already, actually I don't really feel like working either though, eugh, so annoying, I just feel really blah today, and lately..

I think this next week I'll have to get together with some ppl too, because I want to, and if I don't do that soon I'll run out of time.. but grr I have to work next week again.. oh well only 8 hours.. 

why does life have to be so hectic and vexing sometimes?  haha vexing, sorry I told you I watched P&P today.. 
my lips are so sore, and chapped from this cold too..ahhh

whoa I just realized it's going to be 2007 soon, 3 more years till the big 2010 olympics and technically my grad.. but if I switch to douglas for this program I'm thinking of (child and youth counselling) then it'll technically be 2011.. 4 more years.. oh well maybe some of my courses from SFU will transfer and I could do it in 3 or at least 3 and a half. that'd be nice but I highly doubt it.. :(

I guess I should head to bed now then.. 9 am will be so early.. and that means I'll have to wake up way before that as I haven't packed and will need to get ready.. grr. at least I can shop for some cool clothes while down there.."

"event","so today has been..blahish.

I didnt get to sleep till about 3 again last night because of this stupid cold.  I like couldn't breathe and yea, it wasn't fun.  Then I woke up and went to work at 10, I really wish I'd called in sick because I kept coughing and sniffling and I was so hot and it went soooooo long, and eugh, I ran out of stuff to do again so shelve reading and yea.. it was just.. not fun with this cold, but it's never super fun anyways lol.. oh well I made some moola. 

then I went home confirmed some book sales with ppl, I only need to get my psych texts now.  Then I listened to some more of Oh!Gravity, because mine hasn't come yet.. grr.. 

ttthhen, I went to get jen from her gift wrapping shift and sarah was staying for her shift by herself so we stayed and hung out with her for a bit, turns out someone stole from marks work wearhouse again tonight, someone also did when laura and I were doing our shift thursday, man this time of year I guess gets more stealing than any other.. which is sad.

tonight my plans are: help prepare the house for christmas dinners (tomorrow, and monday) it's crazy, it's never felt this much like Christmas, well not in the last few years anyways, because last year we just got back from hawaii today.. and then the last few years before we've always gone to my aunts for dinner, this year we're actually having it here and my mom is going crazy.  she wanted to do this but now she's like complaining about all the stuff we need to do lol.. it's funny.  we have to prepare all these pies and desserts, candies are already laid out and everything, and then we have the tables to set and the house to clean, and the turkey to cook (but that and the potatoes, brussell sprouts and everything will probably happen tomorrow) 

so much to do.. lol I think we may go to the morning service tomorrow at Gracepoint, but then we can't go to yc.. I don't think many ppl will be there though

then boxing day I think we're going to go to gig harbor for sure, for a few days.. which means I'll miss the wrapping volunteers party at sarah's house and the young adults games night but oh well..
I'll be back in time for the new year's eve dance rave and that'll be so fun .. they're borrowing gracepoints smoke machine, strobe lights and disco ball.. haha why our church has that stuff is unknown annnyhows.. 

It's A Wonderful Life is on in my kitchen.. my mom's already watched White Christmas this year lol.. I actually haven't seen Miracle on 34th Street since I was like 6 though.. but yea, *breaks into song* It's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas */desong* lol"

I think I may get all mine for this semester this way, and hopefully get rid of a few too :S

"event","so the two other marks are in..

I got a B- in history 204 too! I'm excited because I really honestly thought I'd fail that course, it was so hard for me.. opinions and such are not my thing.. I guess it was the writing that helped me out, I can usually fake my way through essays pretty well and make stuff up lol..

then I got a C+ in crim. that's pretty good considering it was a pretty hard course also.. good thing I was allowed to do my presentation for my TA instead of in front of class, otherwise I wouldn't have done it and I may have gotten a way worse mark :S

today, I worked 1-3, then I walked over to esquires to meet nadine for coffee.. and it was awkward because like 10 sands grads came in, and I went to elementary with all of them, but they didn't say anything to me really, and nadine was talking with them all and yea.. AWKWARDDDD!!!.. now I remember why I left sands, tanya seemed glad to see us though..

then from there I went to guildford's marks work wearhouse for another gift wrapping shift.. I was with laura, and we sat there for 3 hours, and two ppl asked us to wrap their gifts, Jason Chifan, and his friend from youth church David.. yup, and they didn't even buy them at marks work wearhouse they just came from the mall and wanted us to wrap their stuff... it was weird, I was expecting it to be really busy tonight..but no, 2 ppl and they're youth churchites..grimace was at guildford so he popped in again too.. he said he saw vicky working at AE so when I went over with laura after to get my brother's gift, and so we went in to see if she was there but we didn't see her.. :(
oooo well..

sounds like new year's will just be the leadership team and me.. and maybe a few others lol.. but they aren't anticipating too many ppl :s lol. oh well should still be really fun and cool.  I love yc's dance raves.. sooooo fun, seriously.

wow I love having the time to actually write journal entries now.. it's so refreshing.

and the fact that I have no clue what I'm doing with my life is not..

I have decided I basically have 3 choices for my life right now:
1) continue going to SFU for my psych degree, which will get me probably no job, let alone the one I want..and keep my page job at the library
2) move up at the library and quit school for awhile, and get more involved in the leadership at youth church..
or 3) apply to douglas' child and youth counselling program..and continue working, or hope to move up soon also..

I've decided whatever I decide to do it'll be after much prayer and thinking over things with God, hopefully He'll provide a direction soon because I don't want to spend money and time where I shouldn't be.. 

I have to be 19 to get into the douglas program though, so I guess I have to wait till next september anyways.. so I might as well keep this semester at sfu.

so I think they're still thinking of youth church north delta, but not any time soon because they don't have enough  ppl for it yet. but I honestly don't know whether north delta is big enough to have that work out. I can see it working out in a way but in a way I can't..

nnneways.. I don't really have much more to say about today or how I'm feeling right now.. or my life.

so yea,  that's all."

I'm really pleased with my geography because it was really tough, I'm quite surprised that I got a B-.. but I'm not that happy with my psych, and it's scary because I thought that my history class was wayyyy harder than my psych, and I got a C in psych.. so this could be really bad for history :S  It's weird though because all my individual marks are up on webct, and when I calculated it I should have gotten 70%..shouldn't they say that's a C+ then?. that sounds better than a C.. but oh well.. whatever, I guess a C is a good mark for university, it's just hard going from doing hardly anything in high school and getting As to trying really hard and getting a C :(

well.. I think I'm going on the yc snowboarding retreat..who knows if I'll be boarding though.. I'm also going to both switchfoot and relient k's concerts, this'll be interesting as I guess I'll never spend money ever again!

gift wrapping was pretty boring, we got like 3 ppl.. including grimace and his friend.. oh well me and danica got to talk which was cool.  this thursday I'm doing it again, not sure with whom though, possibly carmen or laura. 

yc is having a new year's eve dance rave, should be totally awesome, I loved their 80s dance party it was the best thing ever! I'm totally stoked for this, I may even dress up like I was going to a real dance rave... appropriately though lol.. 

I have to work everyday this week but friday and sunday, and sunday is christmas eve! already can you believe it?! man so stoked! annnd.. now that I have no school what will I do with all these free days.. I get to sleep in, that's the awesomest part. I only work nights except thursday which is great. I thiknk I'll finish my christmas gift shopping, and possibly phone vicky cause she wants to go for coffee. she sat with me and grimace came and sat with us too tonight, so that was cool. and aron was there and I haven't seen him in quite a few weeks, or talked to him at least (as I haven't gone to church for like 3 weeks :S with stuff and sickness and whatnot) 

man I haven't seen a lot of ppl in awhile. it's sad, but I've been so busy and stuff and now I have all this spare time I just realloy want to sleep and get rid of this stupid cold!! grimace had a cold too haha so I gave him one of my halls during the yc service so he wouldn't be coughing all through it.  that left two for me, but I only needed one when simon was talking so that was cgod. I hate coughing during quiet times and such.

I want to get more involved with yc. everyone on the leadership team seems so cool, like it seems like they all know each other really well and get along so well and can have fun and fellowship and just make everything exciting.  I think I'm going to join the young adults planning team though.  after the young adults retreat and the 80s dance rave, me and deen decided we wanted to get them to do a 50s dance party with root beer floats and ice cream sundaes and jive/swing dancing and the whole bit and sarah thinks that's a great idea, and they're going to do it in january.  she's going to get us to help her get it planned and set up and stuff, which is great.  so I guess I'm sort of on the planning team, and if they do end up doing a yc nd I would definately be a part of the leadership team, but as for now with school and work I guess I'm pretty busy otherwise I wouldn't mind joining the whalley S&L team, that'd be cool, or coaching a surrey school in bball would be neat too but I just don't have time, sadly.

the funner part was actually the setting up lol
first jen and I helped laura with the silent auction prizes and stuff..
we went at like 2 to help set up and I hadn't really eaten anything all day yet so then... guess who's told to do the desserts?
haha oh it was perfect! me and melissa were doing them and we're like oh no we broke one.. well that's a shame 
oh man they were good
and the turkeys and everything were awesome

then I helped set up all the tables and then I went back to help melissa and randall and danielle with the desserts, then I wandered around aimlessly for about an hour.. then I went to get changed into my formal atire, and took some pics, I also got some compliments from.. 4 guys there, and a whole wack of girls lol which made me feel better because my hair only stayed curled at the bottom and I thought it looked bad but apparently it looked great, and my dress was pretty, so that's good, made me feel better lol

then a few of us gals decided we would be greeters for all the guests coming into the banquet, so we did that for awhile, then we found our tables, because they were filling up fast.  

turned out we needed two tables as jen's friend's calin and leo came with ppl from their youth and so I moved to another table so that the other ppl coming would be able to sit with me.

the actual banquet was pretty great. the place was just candle lit and decorated so nicely it was awesome.  we ate, simon talked for a bit (the gospel message) and then keneisha and lindsey (Ithink her name is..) did a christmas carol rap/dance thing, then they had 3 regular yc ppl go up on stage and play jeopardy, and then of course there was dessert time. oo yes, gotta love them desserts.

I had my geography exam today. that was brutal. pretty sure I don't want to see my mark for that one.  I thought I'd be okay because of geography 12, geology 12, and earth science 11 but turns out I probably just passed. oh well. every one seemed to think it was hard.  

cool thing is I got to see briggs again, and take the skytrain home with him afterwards, haven't seen him since last week of classes a few weeks ago, it's weird how it feels like it was so long ago that classes ended..

wow I have to work a lot this week, filling in for garima and such :s.. then I have my crim final friday.. a dentist appointment tomorrow + work tomorrow, wed. and thursday.. plus volunteer gift wrapping thursday for yc, plus the next thursday.. hmm

I want to go on the yc snowboard trip. I think that'd be so fun. but I dont want to pay for it lol and everyone there is a pro at snowboarding so I'd probablyjust pay the half price to go and not snowboard.. but that might fill up fast, apparently they only take 20 non-snowboarders so I hope I can tdecide soon.

I'm glad I got my courses figured out for next semester. I like my schedule. wed and thursdays off.. and no classes before 11:30 in the morning.. and no classes later than 5:20.. in fact other than one class that goes till then my latest one is 2:20 so that's pretty good

I'm taking an online course though so that'll be what I'll be doing wed and thursdays but I only have one class friday from 12:30-2:20 which is cool 

HAPPY BIRTHDAY CLAREEN! if  you're reading this.. hope you had a great one!
I put it in my title so that you'd see it either way haha

wow the candy cane I just had tasted tres weird oh well..

yea, can't wait till this friday is over! I will be officially done this semester, and totally ready for my 3 week break and man, it'll be totally awesome.  I cannot wait, seriously. like I guess first semester is always tough and the hardest with getting used to it and everything so I am totally ready for it to just end. right now. which just reminds me of how bad I need to study tomorrow, wed and thursday. :S"

(rhetorical question).  it was cool though, and very nice of her to do that for me.  they wanted me to cook a turkey for sunday night. but I don't know how so I said no, now my mom wants to help by cooking one.. but I thikn it's too late.. 
I also signed up to help gift wrap at the marks' work wearhouse or whatever in guildford for yc, so hopefully that should be fun and laura or sara may be helping me so hopefully I at least now one person helping me, then I can meet some others. yay.
I seriously can't wait for christmas. it'll be so nice
because I'm working like every day the week before and not working the week after because we're probably going on a road trip to oregon, canon beach, again I can't wait for the break and the whole christmas celebration!!
and we're having the family dinner here this year.. we haven't had it here in years!  so we get to do all the christmas bakind and cooking and everything and the best part.. if I get bored I can run away to my room! haha totally kidding, but I mean it's kinda nice to have your own house sometimes when doing these big family things.. seems how I have no cuz' my age.. 

right now I'm super obsessed with nevertheless's new song ""The Real"" it's quite awesome. 
da de da.. I thikn I have to take jen to a senior boy's bball game tonight at ND so she can video tape it for the dvd yearbook at least she's getting paid that's pretty sweet.. yea, that's about it. I lead a tres boring life. the end."

"event","wow so I've been so super busy lately and somehow I always seem to forget about livejournal..

it's funny how everything in my life seems to drastically change every time I find this site again though.
last time I had a new youth group and church, and new friends and the same is sort of true of all of these again.  well I'm still at the same church but no more youth group, it's up to college and career now which is quite awesome except for the fact that I've only been able to go twice and it has only been aron and I both times but that's still cool.  I'm mad though because kevin changed it to wed nights now and I'm at school till 8 wednesdays.  how unfortunate.  I've been hanging out a lot with youth church people though now.  it's quite awesome. making new friends and stuff.  I dragged nadine along on the college and career retreat that gracepoint had with youth church and white rock community and man was that one of the funnest things ever!  I guess it would be sad to say that it was almost as fun as grad!  it was so awesome.  I love going on retreats where you only know a few ppl and you're forced to be totally outgoing. there's been two now for me and each time I've ended up making some great friends.  we had an 80s dance rave the saturday night and oh man dressing up 80s and dancing to all the old 80s hits was priceless.  I ended up highland dancing to 80s country music in the middle of the old cabin and everyone was cheering and thought it was awesome lol... it was cool because we made friends with a whole bunch of people our age from white rock community, and we hung out with them later and stuff.. fun times. and I got all their emails so it's cool, I may go to their c&c sometime, but we'll see... we also got to hang out a lot with some of the girls from yc, like sarah and carmen and laura.. which is totally awesome, and with bowling every thursday night with yc I'm starting to get to know a lot of the peeps which is cool.

I also went to leanne's new place last sat night. man that's the party house.  she moved out to fraser heights/cloverdale-ish area.  into the basement of jocelyn from her youth church vancouver team.  it's cool because they live right next door to sara and adam stitch so they're always over there, and jocelyn of course, and her brother always comes downstairs and lewis just popped in.. and lainee and yea, like everyone from yc lives over there so they just pop in and they don't even knock lol  it was cool, I taught sara some guitar, we played dutch blitz, and went over to sara's to make her potatoes.  

yc vancouver started up last night, I don't know how it went yet but I hope it went well.  a lot of yc ppl went down for the opener to support them. jen and I were going to but then we decided to go to normal whalley instead.  I'm glad we did though, the message was quite good.  ashley gau spoke about trust and randall shared about how that was relevent to him this past week, and yea it was just shall I say.. inspirational?  I don't know.. 

right now I'm taking a break from writing my psych paper because it's tough, I like to procrastinate.  I did that all weekend.  I'm regreting it now but I was totally burnt out from midterms and such.. I only got my psych midterm back so far.  I did pretty good for my first uni midterm: 77% overall. that's a B i'm happy.  seems how I didnt study much due to the retreat lol

hopefully I'll get my other marks back tomorrow or wed.

I got called in for an interview to move up to circulation assistant at the library, but I couldn't make any of the times for interviews because I had classes I needed to be at.  I was mad.  they said they'd call me next time though.  

eugh I can't wait till friday morning is over with.  I have to do my psych experiment on my psych tutorial.  I'm nervous.  I don't really even need to talk but I have to get everything ready and grr.. I just don't want to do it, my experiment is so lame.  

I can't wait till after that though because meghan's coming over sat.  and I don't have to work sat as it's rememberance day!
and then meghan is going to come to church and yc with me! I'm so excited.  I haven't seen her since.. summmer.. although I guess that's not THAT long ago. 

I can't wait for this semester to be over.  it's been a tough first one, getting into routine and everything.  I can't complain about my schedule though.. other than the 8:30 class friday morning I managed to get my earliest class as 10:30 and my latest ending at 3:20..except wed nights..but I don't have school thursdays so I don't really mind going out there for a night class it's actually kind of neat.. an experience I guess.  

the bible study I go to for campus for christ is interesting.  I like it but sometimes it can be.. a little much, but it's definately been worthwhile getting to know a few other christians on campus.  

I guess what I've been struggling most with lately is trust. Trusting God in every area of my life.  at equip 06 this year at yc, which was another highlight of the past few months..building a free community carnival for the ppl of whalley/guildford, and spending the weekend at yc... kevin snyder came and spoke and he was talking about giving up that 5% that you don't give to God and I've figure out what mine is.. except it's not 5% it's more like.. 30% of my life lol.  and it's definately tough to give it up.  I've been hurt a lot in the past few months and I've been so stressed out, and impatient and it's just hard to understand why everything happens the way it does sometimes, but I've been seeing a lot of good come out of the hard times, and God's slowly showing me that He wants me to give Him 100%, everything in my life, not just the easy stuff to give Him but every little thing that I keep really close to me too.

wow this is super long, like any one is going to read this whole thing, congrats if you do.  Im not really sure I want anyone to read the whole thing now that I think about though lol but oh well. kudos!"

"event","well, well, well.
It's been quite awhile since my last visit and journal entry on here.  I was just reading my last one and I'm amazed at how much things in my life have changed since then.  I've finally graduated from high school! and grad was really an amazing time.  The dancing at the banquet and being one of the few who wasn't drunk at dry grad lol.. good times.  I'm glad I decided to make those changes in my life that I did this year.  I've made a lot of new friends and some really, really great ones through the switch, who I know I'll be friends with for the next few years definately.  oh and then there was the youth grad trip to california.  oh man what a blast.  24 hr there and 24 hr back road trip for one day at six flags/magic mountain in LA.  next time I will bring adaquate clothing so bobby doesn't need to buy a sweater and let me where it lol.  (who knew it was going to be freezing in LA?!)  
already there's been changes in youth though.  jen and I went in hoping to bring the two seperate groups at gracepoint together, and we did(well God let us help Him do that).. for a short period in time but now it seems like the line has been drawn again, and it's sad. It would be nice to go back to the way things were back in january when no matter the number we were all hanging out and invited to go play poker or head off to youth church together.  
speaking of which.. YC! woot woot! man, the first time jason asked me to that I was looking for excuses not to go.  I didn't want to go that sounded so scary. after simon came and talked at our fall retreat graham took us with him, and I'm glad he did. it's been an amazing experience.  I love youth church so much!  it's seriously an amazing thing.  (and then the whole YC NORTH DELTA thing, and remix at ND.. oh man I'm so stoked to see what God has planned for youth church in ND in the next few years.  
and as of very very recently I've been pretty psyched about what I feel God has been putting on my heart.  it's a longish story and I don't feel like typing it all out because who even knows who reads all this stuff anyways.. but to make the long story short.. I believe that God is putting the issue of troubled teen girls and woman on my heart.  and I have been following a new ministry in Canada called Mercy Ministries for awhile and through a series of events and prayer and such a few weeks ago I've been looking into what one would need to be a counsellor at the first ever canada mercy house in surrey.  it appears you only need a psych degree or christian counselling degree which is what I will be getting.. and yes, I think helping girls like that.. prostitutes, girls with eating disorders, the abused, etc. would be a very trying but ministeriful (lol) job, and I don' tknow if that's really God's plan for me or not but we'll find out sooner or later but its a good place to aim for now.
wow.. tiredness.. time to head off."

"event","<P>Sooooo. what really happend on saturday? lol. we'll lets see. umm i woke up and waited for joanne, hung out with my cousins and grandma untill they left. Joanne came over and she wanted to hear me sing, and last time she asked i told her i was ""ok"" at singing ""im not bad...im just not good"" and then we sang for a while and she was mad because it turns out i can sing. and umm if you ask me if i can sing i guess the answer is yes? lol whatever. so we picked out all new colleges and whatnot. anyways after she left, i headed over to walgreens (WG) to do salvation army bell ringing. and oh dear. i did not know what i was getting into.</P>

<P><FONT color=#3333ff>WEDNESDAY:&nbsp; <FONT color=#000000>umm. geeze, so long ago. anyways i tried to sneak out of school during eighth hour (study hall) three times. got caught each time. i believe the dialouges went like this: </FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Mrs. Vanerdt: ""<FONT color=#ff0000>Where are you going?"" </FONT>""to the bathroom""<FONT color=#ff0000> ""You do know the bathroom is that way right?""</FONT> ""oh""</P>
<P>Smelly Hallway lady: <FONT color=#ff0000>""Do you have a pass"" </FONT><FONT color=#000000>""happy thanksgiving"" </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>""oh.........alright then"" </FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>yeah so that didnt work. wednesday night i went to mike reileys with Mike, Staisik, Stacey, and john. that was alright. All the boyz were there, traynor and whonot. you know the bunch. and after that i went and slept at staisik's.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>THURSDAY!!: </FONT><FONT color=#000000>thanksgiving. mine wasn't that great. i woke up around tweleve and went right into the shower. i got out of the shower at 12:43&nbsp;and then went to Terra Huber's to play football with the huber clan. My team won (surprise surprise) Danny started complaining once we started winning, it was funny. but mikeys&nbsp;aunt carol just freaking destoryed people. it was odd and refreshing to see an old women picking up&nbsp; 8 yards a carry ( that all stopped once i sort of&nbsp; <EM>accidentally </EM>lowered my shoulder into her). but anyways we didn't eat turkey, we didn't eat untill like 8. hahaha. whatever. Emily rizzo wooped my ass in DDR. she broke all the records we had. Phil said he really sucked but ended up beating me, subichin is still the king. That night we all went to Ryan's were i saw my beautiful love Katrina!! She's so beautiful and i love her soo much (she's standing right behind me, could you tell?) after that i picked up Tom, we played some X-men then i took him to jimmy's and i went home and went to bed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff><STRONG>FrIdAy:</STRONG><FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;<STRONG>a</STRONG>nywayZ. yesterday was friday. umm i woke up. ate some honey nut cherrios.&nbsp; and i dont remember much of the morning at all so lets just skip to about 4. i called up kelli hough to see if she wanted to go out to dinner before the tree lighting and she said call her back in an hour and i said ok. John was depressed and wanted some nacho's so we drove to the qudoba on 76th. got some nacho's and stole a soda, then we came home and watched this crazy ninja movie, believe me ephasis is on the word ""crazy"". i called kelli and she was like yeah pick me up in ten minutes and i said how about 8 minutes? and she was like fine. so i picked her up and we came back here to get some money but ended up talking to my aunt carolin and very ""jolly"" (he threw back a <EM>few)</EM> uncle mark, who kept telling me how i was a ""george washington"" of soceity and how i was going to ""lead the american people to a great economical victory"" (whhhaaattt?) but it was like 6:10 and we were on our way to the tree lighting ceremony and my friend jaime called and she was mad at me for something not visiting her because she was only in from arizona for like 3 days so i went and bought flowers for her at pick'n'save (**note to self: never buy flowers for a chick while you with another chick= not slick) hahaha, but by this time it was like 6:23 and kelli was freaking out because i guess we had to be there at 6:20 so we high tailed it to the village and go tthere around 6:30, there was no where to drive or park so we just parked at the highschool, and kelli and i ran to city with the chior already up there which was no good, but we climbed up there and sang. boy does our choir suck. holy cow.&nbsp; kim and bethany just revamped all the songs half way through so we really didn't sound that great. but after that kelli and i went and got dinner at my house, sat around untill i picked up isiah and hermes called so we picked him up and headed for liz's party, which was alright, then we left after i wooped up kim and bethany. Subichin almost beat me in armwrestling!!!! time to start lifting again......then i took kelli and hermes home and me isiah and john sat around with my aunt, i beat my grandma in gin and went to bed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=6><STRONG>SATURDAY: </STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3><STRONG>it </STRONG>didnt happen yet but heres what is <EM>going </EM>to happen i woke up at six got ready for my meeting with Joanne. burshed up some audition peices, took a nap and got ready for battle that is to take place at 6:30.&nbsp; The zulu warriors who never loose at anything played the team of 43 people and freaking destoryed them. me and phil both had two flag captures and i never stopped laying out people. it was quite glorius. after ctf i hung out with deanna. not a bad plan for a saturday i reckon.</FONT></FONT></P>

"event","Ouch. I dont exactly know what to say. i guess its easier to put it like this. you know when u put a water balloon on the end of faucet, and it gets bigger and bigger and you know that you need to stop putting water in it or it will explode? yea im like that balloon. lol i really dont want to ""explode"" in any sense of the word, that would suck. man i get so hopeless sometimes, DAMNIT. well this weekend went great for me, lol, totally fucked up with everyone i ever cared about, got the shit wooped out of me, don't trust anyone anymore. i laying on my driveway when some lady i didn't even know walked by and totally ripped me open and told me what a bad person i was.....and the sad thing is even though i didn't know who she was lol i thought it was all true. GOD WHY DONT YOU SEE IT!! man i just dont even know what to do with myself. haha. kind of funny. man have you ever wanted to get someones attention soo bad that you wish you could just put your hand right in their fricken face untill they finally see you and just tell you what they think, not blow you off, not make up some bull shit answer, have you ever wished that they respected you enough to consider you a person. i felt like that today. Like i was invisible. anyways enough of me feeling sorry for myself, lets talk abou tthe ""good"" things in me.......................wow terribly exciting isn't, an incredible list of feats indeed. well heres my question for you all: have you been honest with soemone you really need to be with today?"

"event","ok umm this is dedicated to my best friend-kind-of-sort-of. the only reason im not sure if were best friends is because we don't see much of each other anymore. but staisik (or however you spell it) is also my best friend so i guess i potentially have two best friends. which makes me a lucky guy.
reasons why phil is cool:
curly hair
loyal
hes a zulu warrior.
dependable
(i quote a female when i say) hes hott
(i quote a female when i say) he has a gianoumours penis
hes involved with everything
umm theres alot more but i dog is puking so i have to go i will continue later.. sorry phil this doesnt do you justice."

"event","i guess this is the cool thing to do only because todd garcia did it and he is a cool guy. so im a little cheesed off at people, especailly this thing. So i claimed my country of legal residence Bangladesh, and somehow the computer knew that i was lying!! (maybe its because when it asked me what state i lived in i said wisconsin) but anyways i was at the canterbury talent show, and boy was that an experience. hahaha. man you know the part in mean girls where the mom is dancing with the girls in jingle bell rock. I SAW SOMEONE DO THAT. holy gaey. anyways i tried to resolve all of my problems with this one girl, and that turned out to be a huge mess because i think were farther apart now then we were before, and now im kind of afraid to talk to her, lol. umm and then i tried to explain to my grandma why TBS isnt called TBS and its called WDJTV or something like that, and then in dance dance revoultion my freaking left arrow doesnt work because a certain african american skeeted on it (his name rhymes with I-playa Shadams) and there was a hair in my hotdog today so i took it up to the lady who insisted it wasnt hers and then she wiped it off with a napkin and the hair turned out to be pink, so if u guys see someone with pink hair putting it in peoples hotdogs, please give me a call. OH MY GOODNESS SOMETIMES THINGS ARE JUST SOO GAEY!!!"

It's been awhile since I've done an update so I thought I'd do one.  things have been going pretty good this year out at school, just the same ole stuff of school, the apartment, going home to see Kate...so not much diffrent from the past few years.  I've just been relatively bored this semester and looking for something to excite or energize me and I really havent found anything like that :-/.  o well.... but yeah, things have been going good, if a little bland lately."

I hate my life right now.

Today, for the second time I was denied for an insulin pump by my insurance.  I really need one because it would help me stabilize and keep my diabeties under control, but I guess that I'm not special enough for one...maybe if I just quit taking my insulin then I'll get sick enough to need one...blah.

I hate myself right now."

"event","Hello everyone.  

I figured i'd do a real actual update instead of just some rambling paragraph about some obsurd subject.

Things have been really great since I came home from the summer.  It's gone by really fast though and doesnt really feel like I've been home that long.

me and Kate went camping one weekend out on Lake Michigan at Silver Lake State Park.  its a very beautiful and Scenic area and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys camping in state parks.  it was fun, we went and climbed the sand dunes, cooked over a fire and we're able to relax with her snuggled up against me and just enjoy the fire.  It was nice though because in a 200-300 lot campground, there were at most 10 other lots occupied, and the final day, we were the ONLY people in that campground, so it was nice because we literally had the place all to ourselves.  but we survived that weekend without killing ourselves or each other, so it worked out.

Then I was able to start at the Henry Ford.  I just cant really say how great of a job it is.  whether I'm working in the Museum, or the Village its a whole lot of fun.  I look at it, as that I'm payed to ride my bike every day and look at the diffrent stuff that they have there.  since I love history, it cant get much better then that.  I get to see all the cool stuff going on there and since I have keys to the whole campus, I can also go behind the scenes and look at the diffrent neat things that they have in storage.  I'm also able to get people in for free, so if you ever want to go, just let me know!!

Then lastly, this past week and a half, I've been extremely bored.  Kate has been on vacation and Jeff is currently training at Fort Knox.  so I dont really have anyone to do stuff with.  so its mainly been me piddling around my house on the days that I have off, and thats bad because I dont work again until Thursday.  I dont really talk to many people anymore so I guess its pretty much my fault that I dont have many people to hang out with, but eh, its my problem...luckily Kate comes home this weekend so atleast then we'll be able to  hang out and do stuff together then.  speaking of which, in two days, (June 8th) will be mine and Kates two year anniversary.  its scary because it doesnt even feel like two years.  but so I'm planning a nice evening where I can taker her out and we can have a nice evening alone.

speaking of romance and relationships, my sisters b/f asker her to marry him, so now my sister is engaged and that leaves me as the last umarried or unengaged Matthews.....gosh I feel old now.

anyways, leave me a message to atleast know that someone reads this, and take care.

Chris"

I got to go up into the clock tower today in the museum and also I got to see all of the tunnels which run under the village.  but yeah, its a great place, so everyone reading this should come to The Henry Ford sometime this summer and see me.  its a great place to go for a date, :-P.  you can come and see the fireworks and Detroit Symphony Orchestra in July!!!!"

It was beautiful for the most part, with it only raining a bit on Saturday morning.  but it was a fun time, cooking over a grill, having a campfire and making baked potatos in the fire and sleeping out in the tent.....very much diffrent then the camping that I've become accustomed to, which is a 35ft motorhome :-P"

"event","I took off for a weekend last month
Just to try and recall the whole year.
All of the faces and all of the places,
wonderin' where they all disappeared.
I didn't ponder the question too long;
I was hungrey and went out for a bite.
Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum,
and we wound up drinkin' all night.

It's those changes in latitudes,
changes in attitudes nothing remains quite the same.
With all of our running and all of our cunning,
If we couldn't laugh, we would all go insane.

These changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes;
Nothing remains quite the same.
Through all of the islands and all of the highlands,
If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane

Reading departure signs in some big airport
Reminds me of the places I've been.
Visions of good times that brought
so much pleasue
makes me want to go back again.
If it suddenly ended tomarrow,
I could somehow adjust to the fall.
Good times and riches and son of a bitches,
I've seen more than I can recall...(to chorus)

I think about Paris when I'm high on red wine;
I wish I could jump on a plane.
And so many nights I just dream of the ocean.
God, I wish I was sailin' again.
Oh, yesturdays are over my shoulder,
So I can't look back for too long.
There's just too much to see waiting in front of me,
and I know that I just can't go wrong"

So it was decided this week by our committie that the Western Michigan Pow Wow is going to be canceled this year.  the big major reason is that UofM's is holding theres on the same weekend and we just cant compete with them.  we are usually scraping up just enough money to hold it, but since UofM switched theres this year and took our traditional dates, we just cant compete to draw dancers and vendors to ours.  they have a budget of atleast 70,000-80,000 dollars, we have a budget of maybe 15,000-20,000 so we just cant afford to give payouts to dancers and to drum groups.  this makes me really sad because it is usually a big event on campus and a large WMU tradition, but it will not be held this year.  it really sucks because this is truly something that I've been looking forward to all year and we wont be able to do it.  well, hopefully theres next year...if there is even a NASO orginazation next year, which might not happen, so this might be the death stroke for our Pow Wow"

"event","why am I feeling like this?  I dont really know how to describe it but it feels like either a panic or a nervousness.  I dont know, I'm probably just in a low mood right now.  lately I've been feeling that most of my friends that I've had in the past, I've either drifted away from or lost touch with totally and I do not like this feeling :-(.  I realize that happens in life, but I feel like I've let it happen more then it should and it scares me.  I used to have lots of people that I could go and hang out with and just have fun and it seems like there arent that many people in my life right now.  I know I've screwed up some really great friendships in the past year or two and that upsets me, what I've let slip away.  I wish that there was a way that I could go back in time and keep things the way that they were before.  I used to have alot of people that I could always talk to and now, I'm barely talking to anyone.

I dont know what it is about me, if I'm just anti-social and dont want people around me or If I push people away from me on purpose, or what, I dont know."

"event","I find it amusing how only Aviation students can find humor in aircraft crashes.  I guess its because its we'll be doing one day and we all have to have a sense of humor about our business.  today in my aviation safety class today, we watched a 40 minute movie of aviation disasters...one aircraft after another either falling apart in mid air or crashing into the ground or exploding into a mass of flames.  what they hell makes us all want to get into these things and take off into the sky at 400mph??  there was one video of an Airbus that had taken off for media demonstrations.  it made a low level pass of the field...but then it didnt apply quite enough power to climb over the trees and *BAM* hit the woods, infront of a whole slew of media people and just went right into the forest.  If your afraid of flying, you shouldnt take some of the classes I have this semester because most of my proffesors have storys about their millitary days and about diffrent things they've seen and done and about accidents that they had witnessed.  I really believe that some people would leave my classes crying because of how morbid our descriptions get sometimes...but o well, thats life.  you have to laugh and have a sense of humor about what you want to do with your life."

"event","YAY!!! so this weekend was awsome.  after looking like I might not be able to make it out to CMU this weekend, I was able to get my car fixed and I made it out there.

Friday
So I spent the morning fixing my car and pulling the bolts off of my battery just to get my car working again.  I also had an advising appointment that morning that I went to before I was able to leave K-zoo.  around 2 I was finally able to leave and to drive out to Mt. Pleasent.  the weather was so crappy and I saw so many police cars and accidents on my way to Mt Pleasent.  It seemed like I was taking forever to get there with the weather and the traffic but I finally got there, managed to find Heathers dorm and then find a parking spot.  I wandered around outside while Heather came down to find me and then she checked me into the front desk where I got to get my wonderful red wrist band that I had to wear the whole weekend.  we went up to her room and got her b/f paul and then went and ate dinner.  after that we went and hung out for a little while before going and getting Dickey and Keshian and going over to Kristina's b/f's apartment and watched a weird ass movie about cannibalistic soldiers and we got some pizza.  after that me, Paul and Heather came back to their dorm and me and we went to sleep.  at about 1am, one of Heathers roommates came back with her drunken friends and made a whole bunch of noise, then at about 5am...one of her drunken friends decided that he needed to use the bathroom so we all woke up to him pissing on the floor in the middle room at which point Heather started screaming at him.  so after that I was finally able to get some sleep.


Saturday.
we got up, got Paul and went down to breakfast.  we met up with her roommate Jamie and her b/f Mike and we all got ready and walked over to the game.  it was soooooo windy and it had to be blowing about 30-40mph.  we got to the game about 2 hours early and walked around a little, we went to where everyone was tailgating and saw how everyone was drunk and dressed up, so we went back, I ran into Dylan, I saw a few people from high school and finally the game started.  everyone kept hitting me and booing me and giving me dirty looks when ever WMU did something good.  WMU was doing pretty good and was up by 2 touchdowns, but finally the people that I was with were finally to cold so we left at the end of the 3rd quarter.  they (Kristina, Keshia, Dan and Dave) went back to Dave's apartment and I found my way back to the towers and had Heather come and get me and get back into the dorm.  we went up to Pauls room because they had h/w to do, but I ended up crashing on the couch in the main room and just watching the UofM game while listening to CMU come back and beat WMU in overtime (damn I shouldve stayed for the end). so I loafed around there watching the game and then Heather finished her h/w so we went back to her room.  Jamie and Mike were there watching the UofM game so the two girls went and got ready for going out for halloween and we watched the rest of the UofM game.  after the game was over, we went out...got our drinks for the night, heather got the wings for her costume and then we finally got ready, changed into our costumes and then went out for the night, we went and ended up at Chip village and we had fun there with everyone, I got drunk and it was just general good time.  so after that we came back, I got some pizza and we pretty much just went to bed after that.

Sunday
we all woke up, me and Keshia went over to Kristina's and we pretty much just watched movies the whole day.  Heather eventually came over and we watched a bunch of movies all day until it was finally around midnight.  I went back and got my stuff, said good bye and then left.  I like freeway driving at night so I had a nice drive to look forward to on the way home.  I eventually got back around 2am and then crashed in bed.

I had such a great time this weekend, It was great to see Heather, Kristina and Keshia again plus everyone that I met for the first time...Dave, Mike, Jamie, Paul (I never met him before this weekend) and everyone else who I happened to met....it was just a great time, I cant stress how much I enjoyed myself so Heather, Kristina, Keshia, it was great to see you all, I had a blast, I was sad when I had to go home."

Friday night I went to the symphony at Miller Auditorium and heard the Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra perform.  It was wonderful to hear them in their because I was in the top balcony and the sound just bounced off the ceiling and right into there.  Miller is the 2nd biggest auditorium in Michigan so its just a great place to go and hear music at.

Saturday, me and Matt woke up with about 10 minutes before we had to leave to go to the football game.  so we got up, went over to Ky's and then drove over to the stadium.  it was a great football game, it was just sleating and pouring the whole time and we just had to stand there in it....by the end of the game I was completely soaked.  but anyways, it was a great football game.  EMU and WMU were tied throughout most of the game and it was right down to the final minute.  even if WMU lost, it was still a good football game. so I came back and I met Kate who had come out for the weekend, we ended up hanging aroudn my apartment, I cooked a nice dinner for her and then we went over to Ky's apartment because she had gotten a keg.  after that we came back and uhhh, hung out.  the rest of the weekend was mostly just spent with Kate in my bedroom....i'll spare you the details.  but the final count was about 8 times."

"event","so this was a interesting and diffrent weekend, I had some really good things happen and also saw some really bad things happen.

Friday: so I managed to get out of Kalamazoo about 1pm, on the way home I dont know why but people would be randomly slamming on the breaks, swerving off the highway to avoid hitting others and for no apparent reason and then everyone would just resume driving like nothing happened. so I managed to make it home without dying.  when I got home no one was home because my parents were on a weekend trip with the miata and my sister was at work.  so I loafed around, submitted some h/w assignments then I took my moms ATM and got some money for that night....  then finally the good part of the day came around and I walked over to Megans at around 7:30.  I got there cause I was supposed to go to Canada with her for her 19th birthday.  so we waited till some of her friends got there,  Jess and Nate and Carrie and then we waited...and waited...and waited...and waited for ever for the other people to get there so that we could leave. finally, the other people go there around 10:30 and we argued about who was going to be the D.D's and then we FINALLY got to leave.  we took two cars to canada and  finally got across the border around 11 or 11:30.  then we spent the next hour or so chasing the diffrent groups of us around the Casino Windsor until we finally got all of us assembled at which point I needed a stiff drink so I went and got one (yay! my first legally bought drink!).  after that we left the casino and wandered over to Ouleut (sp?) street.  some people wanted to dance (I wouldve liked to) and others just wanted to get drunk at a bar, so we split up and I ended up going with the group who was heading to the bar.  we went to a karaoke bar and thats pretty much where I was for the rest of the night, just sitting at the bar drinking 7&7's and talking with everyone. then finally me, Carrie, Tess and Nate stumbled back to the car with John who was our D.D.  he was giving me, Carrie and Nate a ride home while Tess went back to the casino to find everyone else cause thats where they had gone.  so we get in and attempt to make it back through customs, which is scary to a drunk teen trying to reenter the U.S.  they were wearing their black Homeland security unifmors and doing car walk arounds and searches.  but the guy was cool, he knew we were smashed and he just told us to have a good night and not to get into trouble.  so I get home and finally climb up to bed around 4am and fall asleep.

Saturday:  I get up around 1pm, realized that I missed part of the UofM game (dammnit) and so I watched that for most of the afternoon. then I went over to Farmer Jacks to see Jeff.  I talked to him for a little bit and then I left at 6:30 to head out to Ann Arbor to pick up Kate, but on the way there I saw a humongous plume of smoke in the air from something burning to the south, but so I went out, picked up Kate and we came back and hung out for a little bit at the house.  my mom called me from traverse city at around 9pm and had said that a member of their club, Tom, who is the fire chief of the Ypsilanti fire department had been getting pages all night about the fire and that they had been getting reports that it was the Yankee Air Museum at Willow Run airport.  hearing that just made my heart drop and I had to know if It was true or not.  so me and Kate drove out to willow run and got there about 9:30pm to find the hangar fully raging on fire, just seeing that museum go up in flames just totally crushed me and made me feel horrible.  there were just cars pulled over all along Ecorse road watching the hangar burn as the 6 fire departments who responded tryed to put it out.  everyone was just standing in shock as the hangar just burned and collapsed.  they have 3 very important aircraft in their hangar from W.W.2 and I was just praying that they had gotten them out in time because those aircraft were beyond measure of how valuable they were.  so we came back home and hung out for a little bit while watching the news about the museum.  I was greatly relieved when I found out that they had rescued the 3 aircraft from the hangar.

I know its probably something that some people cant fathom, but that museum burning down affected me personally and I felt grief for it.  that museum was a gem of south-east Michigan, it was full of tons and tons of aviation artifacts and pictures depicting people who had passed on and were no longer with us.  me and Jeff drove out the next day and the ruins were still smoldering, but people  were gathering around the site, just looking at it.  I found out that when people found out that the hangar was on fire, they rushed into the burning hangar to push out the 3 aircraft by hand.  they saved the heart of the museum by pushing and pulling on the 2 bombers and the transport to save them.  this has been a tragedy but hopefully they can recover.  support has already started coming from all over the country to help them rebuild and hopefully they will perservere and continue on because it would be a truly sad thing if the museum collapsed because of this and they lost the 3 aircraft that people risked their  lives to save."

"event","this weekend was actually one of the better ones that i've had in quite awhile.  it started out Friday when I went up to campus during the afternoon to watch the ROTC when they were leaving to go on exercises to Fort Custer.  they were all assembled on the track waiting for a helicopter that was going to land there and pick some of them up.  so I went over and waited for the helicopter to land.  one of the leaders saw me and came over and talked to me for a few minutes and ended up giving me a free waterbottle.  so it was so cool when the helicopter came swooping in, circled the field and then landed.  they loaded up about 6 guys and then I watched it take off again and leave.  

after that I came back, loaded up my car and then I left to go home.

on my way home I swung by Ann Arbor and picked up Kate from her dorm and then I went over to Ypsilanti and Depot town.  I went to see if I could find my parents at the meeting for their car club but they werent there so we left.  as I was leaving depot town, I took a left hand turn a little fast and I cut off my parents as they were driving in the Miata to their meeting....so my mom called me on my cell phone and yelled at me for that. but me and Kate just went home and got somethign to eat.  while me and Kate were eating, my mom called me and asked if the two of us wanted to take my dads miata and join the club for a drive, so I  guess that my parents werent that mad at me.....but alas, we couldnt because we were meeting Jeff and Jamie at the movies so me and Kate went and did that.  we went and saw ""The Forgotten"" which by the way I wouldnt reccomend seeing.  but anyways, after that, me and Kate drove out to Ann Arbor and just hung out in her dorm room until I went home and went to bed.

the next day, I got up, watched most of the MSU game (*sniff*, they won) and then I drove out to Ann Arbor, picked up Kate and then we went to a pig roast at my friends house, we hung out there for a little while, watched the UofM game, and then we left there and drove down to Dundee to meet my sisters and other people. but they were about an hour late, so me and Kate ended up walking around Cabelas and then getting something to eat in the meantime.  we went and did the corn maze down there, it was alot of fun, running around a corn field at night, even when Kate kept taking my cornstalks away from me... :-(.  but then yeah, after that me and Kate went back to her dorm and hung out until I went home and went to bed.

then Sunday, not much happened today, I got up, moped around the house most of the day, went grocery shopping, then I went and got a chair from Matts neighbor.  then I just hung around the house tonight and then I decided to come back here at school and so I drove back tonight, which is something that I like because it was just me and the semi's on the road.

so thats all for now.  i'm gonna catch some sleep cause I have h/w to do tommorow."

<P>This is my new lj. Why, you may ask, did I make a new lj? Simply for the reason that I wanted a new beginning. Maybe a new lj will give me a new outlook on life, or new courage, or new strength...Okay, I'm not stupid. I know little computer diaries can't do that, but if I believe it can, than I can make it.</P>
<P>And I guess that explains the name foma_guided. Foma is a word from Kurt Vonnegut's <EM>Cat's Cradle</EM>, which means ""harmless untruths."" In the front of the book, there's a quote from one of the characters, ""Live by the foma that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy."" I never finished reading the book, but I think it satirizes religions, how they make people happy by telling them stories that may or may not be true. </P>
<P>I'm not going to kid myself with a foma that this lame entry will get me comments, so since I'm a comment whore, <FONT size=5><FONT color=#ccccff>comment to be added</FONT>.</FONT></P>

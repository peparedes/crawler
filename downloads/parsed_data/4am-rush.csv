"event","the best feeling ever is falling asleep holding someones hand.
knowing that through the nightmare you have her.
when the monster comes out from your bed, she's there.
when youre being chased by creatures, she's there.
when no puzzle piece fits, she's there.
even when you're abandoned, she's there."

"event","""heart beats"" 
if you find yourself back here. 
on my side of town. 
i pray that you find yourself at my door. 

she holds my heart. 
and knows what all my imperfections are. 

she said that, ""i was the brightest fire fly in her jar."" 

there are times when reality just becomes a sitcom. 
i've got to bust you out of here and see you fly away. 
i want to see your spirit and your mind. 
free and clear. 

break down. 

the next ten months will be spent in: 
classrooms. 
job sites. 
interstates. 
dorm rooms. 
road trips. 
beach fronts. 
mind sets. 
hair cuts. 
unshaven cheeks. 
first kisses. 
winter dishes. 

i am a smart, sexy, and seriously funny comedy. 

cheers, 
jared"

"event","i ache for august.
i ache for your departure.

i ache for your phone call.
i ache for your lies.

i ache for pseudo adulthood.
i ache for getting to play pretend.

i ache for the way you fake your own self confidence.
i ache for the way you wear that smile on your face.

everything about who i am as a person. is a lie.

something deep inside wants nothing more then chaos and destruction. 
something deep inside me want to just watch every single one of my best friends and love affairs have the most horrific train wrecks of lives. 

i want nothing more then to stand over you while you convulse.
i want to hold your hair back and then fucking drown you in your own vomit.

i am disgusting. 
i am dirty.
i am horrendous. 
i am everything you ever wished you could be. 
could have. 
could fuck.

i am that kid who everyone knows will never become anyone. 
who will be dead by the age of 25. 
who will never, ever fucking care for anyone.

i am that kid.

and you are that kid's dream."
